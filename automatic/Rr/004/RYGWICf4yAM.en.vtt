00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:07.040
 hello, I'm Manuel Oliveres, veterinarian 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:09.440
 the veterinary clinic olivares and of your 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.690
 vet point info today I want 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:14.120
 Tell you a little about the problems 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.710
 of sneezing in cats 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.750
 sneezing are very frequent in our 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:19.279
 animals that cats dogs have on 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.749
 everything because you have heard this 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:22.490
 they give more than once but like 

00:00:20.749 --> 00:00:24.650
 happens with us a sneeze isolated 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:27.099
 it does not matter, but when 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:30.560
 they begin to be very frequent in attacks 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:32.149
 intense very very continuous 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.040
 Well, they can be the symptom of 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:37.310
 some process that may have more or 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.960
 less seriousness according to its origin causes of 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.880
 these knots in our cats by 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.010
 example we can find ourselves good then 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.960
 Cali playing for the worst and that 'no 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.840
 some small particle yes yes benÃ­tez 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.760
 the mucosa of the nasal cavity and the 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.530
 place to appear a small 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.930
 sneeze without any importance in 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.220
 our banal knot also sometimes because 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.440
 when we use air fresheners 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.060
 cleaning products that can 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.710
 prove to be even stronger for us 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.120
 when we are good, well, animal 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.410
 just as a person can cause them 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.650
 also that irritation of the mucosa 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:08.690
 nasal and consecutive sneezing but 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.040
 that is not important 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.260
 the question is when these 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.560
 sneezing becomes more frequent than 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:17.720
 normal in continuous attacks that we 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.150
 can make you think of another kind of 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.160
 origin of the process because we can have 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.020
 infectious processes of viral type are 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.420
 frequent what is the bottom of the cat 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.490
 diseases with the other viral katy network 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.620
 can result in this affectation of the 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.990
 nasal mucosa and these sneezes good 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:34.970
 Well, they can be frequent during good 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.980
 well in the season and tend to 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.990
 chronify means that they can 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:40.610
 appear regrowth of this virus and give 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.030
 origin to good buds of these knots 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.410
 that are extending over time 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.600
 other infectious processes can be 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:50.000
 bacterial or fungal those who are 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.010
 nasal aspergillosis that are already quite 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.670
 more good processes more severe than 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:56.750
 they require a very very very treatment 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:59.510
 intensive and a pretty treatment 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.250
 good sometimes aggressive with two or three 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:04.190
 go nasal cavity action for 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:06.620
 application of treatments within the 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:10.830
 Enzyme of choice in the mucosa 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:13.440
 nasal but good these are processes that 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.840
 they occur but not as often as 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.640
 those that we have commented to part of the 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.320
 infectious processes well well also 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.210
 we have the presence of strange bodies 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.850
 it is no longer that some particle of 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:26.100
 powder or a fluff as we say in the 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.510
 nose but they can sometimes enter 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.550
 strange bodies such as spikes 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.770
 of grasses and good because you are spikes 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.780
 they will cause severe irritation of the 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.400
 mucosa are going to give rise even to your 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.380
 violation and then a 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.230
 download because in principle it will be zero 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:42.450
 zawiya that will happen to be more things and 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.820
 then you can appear in a mood with 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.820
 blood or even a mere hemorrhage of 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:49.709
 a track without nosebleed other 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.090
 causes of these knots appearing 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.370
 well, they can be processes 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:56.520
 Neoplasms at the level of the nasal cavity 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:59.130
 you can start being good because it's a 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:01.620
 Mucosal involvement but tumors 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:04.350
 at the level of quality jumps can go as 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:07.230
 eating bone causing the hostile and 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:09.840
 if from the nasal turbinates and first 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:12.120
 to place also between the presence of 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.010
 sweaty sneezing until it appears 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.950
 even a distance a hemorrhage 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:20.099
 severe apart from that they can deform the 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:22.739
 bones of the nose and ours in our 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:25.140
 then we see that the origins are very 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:26.940
 varied and therefore good because both 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.550
 the diagnosis as the treatment goes to 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.900
 vary also then for when 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.209
 our animal has a sneeze 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.220
 banal then nothing other times has no more 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:36.930
 importance when this sneeze is already 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.849
 prolongs in time if we must 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.340
 consult with our veterinarian because 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:42.870
 will require the diagnosis of 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.720
 causes that has originated is sneezing 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:47.010
 if it is a good infectious process 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.410
 you have to do the same 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:50.580
 extension you have to do smears there 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:53.880
 do cytology 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:56.130
 sometimes you have to do biopsies of the 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:58.950
 turbinates area in case there is a 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:00.930
 tumoral process cultures are made like this 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.880
 bacteria appear because if a 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.799
 fungus you have to do x-rays 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.540
 so, you have to make a series 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:08.310
 of means that many times also go to 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.079
 require even anesthesia sedation 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:13.459
 of our warm to be able to make them 

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:17.340
 with with all the security and 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:19.260
 precise sensitivity then once 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:21.000
 that we have the precise diagnosis of 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:23.790
 good problem because already put in place the 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.650
 appropriate treatment in each case 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:28.210
 remember that an isolated sneeze does not 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.290
 is more important but if you 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:31.840
 prolongs in time 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:33.510
 you should consult to get it 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.280
 solution as soon as possible because there 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:38.590
 diseases that can be serious 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:40.120
 very serious in some in some cases and 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:43.150
 if they get caught in good weather then the 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:45.180
 treatment sometimes goes to solve or 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:48.190
 the less minimize the damage produced 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:50.110
 you already know that if you have any doubt 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:51.790
