remember<00:01:46.889> if<00:01:47.130> you<00:01:47.399> watched<00:01:47.909> yesterday's

00:01:48.769 --> 00:01:48.779 
remember if you watched yesterday's

00:01:48.779 --> 00:01:51.260 
remember if you watched yesterday's
episode<00:01:48.959> how<00:01:49.469> I<00:01:49.499> mentioned<00:01:50.489> that<00:01:50.789> there's<00:01:51.029> two

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
episode how I mentioned that there's two

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.969 
episode how I mentioned that there's two
different<00:01:51.319> digitizers<00:01:52.319> on<00:01:52.529> the<00:01:52.649> samsung

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
different digitizers on the samsung

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.949 
different digitizers on the samsung
galaxy<00:01:53.009> note<00:01:53.459> 2<00:01:53.669> and<00:01:53.909> even<00:01:54.509> though<00:01:54.599> they<00:01:54.779> make

00:01:54.949 --> 00:01:54.959 
galaxy note 2 and even though they make

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:57.199 
galaxy note 2 and even though they make
it<00:01:55.079> seem<00:01:55.259> like<00:01:55.439> it's<00:01:56.159> almost<00:01:56.489> one<00:01:56.849> technology

00:01:57.199 --> 00:01:57.209 
it seem like it's almost one technology

00:01:57.209 --> 00:01:59.359 
it seem like it's almost one technology
they<00:01:57.899> are<00:01:57.929> different<00:01:58.439> so<00:01:58.649> this<00:01:58.859> is<00:01:59.069> touch

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
they are different so this is touch

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.809 
they are different so this is touch
right<00:02:00.299> for<00:02:00.569> example<00:02:01.020> if<00:02:01.229> you<00:02:01.319> took<00:02:01.529> a<00:02:01.819> s-pen

00:02:02.809 --> 00:02:02.819 
right for example if you took a s-pen

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:05.239 
right for example if you took a s-pen
right<00:02:03.689> and<00:02:03.899> you<00:02:03.989> try<00:02:04.200> to<00:02:04.259> write<00:02:04.499> on<00:02:04.679> it<00:02:04.709> it's

00:02:05.239 --> 00:02:05.249 
right and you try to write on it it's

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:08.389 
right and you try to write on it it's
only<00:02:05.520> turning<00:02:06.299> the<00:02:06.469> capacitive<00:02:07.469> touch<00:02:07.770> sensor

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
only turning the capacitive touch sensor

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.029 
only turning the capacitive touch sensor
on<00:02:08.789> here<00:02:09.030> and<00:02:09.179> to<00:02:09.750> do<00:02:09.899> this<00:02:10.140> test<00:02:10.500> you<00:02:10.709> need<00:02:10.829> to

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
on here and to do this test you need to

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.339 
on here and to do this test you need to
just<00:02:11.280> simply<00:02:11.700> just<00:02:12.659> get<00:02:12.810> all<00:02:12.959> these<00:02:13.140> little

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
just simply just get all these little

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:15.310 
just simply just get all these little
box

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
box

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.950 
box
and<00:02:16.880> try<00:02:17.880> not<00:02:18.060> lifting<00:02:18.480> your<00:02:18.600> finger<00:02:18.900> I

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
and try not lifting your finger I

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:24.380 
and try not lifting your finger I
believe<00:02:19.230> that's<00:02:19.440> important<00:02:23.060> yeah<00:02:24.060> as<00:02:24.180> you

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
believe that's important yeah as you

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.150 
believe that's important yeah as you
could<00:02:24.570> see<00:02:24.720> I<00:02:24.750> passed<00:02:25.050> the<00:02:25.230> test<00:02:25.410> the<00:02:25.950> other

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
could see I passed the test the other

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.130 
could see I passed the test the other
one<00:02:26.430> is<00:02:26.550> called<00:02:26.730> Wacom<00:02:27.210> test<00:02:27.480> this<00:02:27.690> is<00:02:27.870> for<00:02:28.080> the

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
one is called Wacom test this is for the

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.160 
one is called Wacom test this is for the
Wacom<00:02:28.530> digitizer<00:02:28.740> before<00:02:29.400> your<00:02:29.580> S<00:02:29.850> Pen<00:02:30.050> and<00:02:31.050> as

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
Wacom digitizer before your S Pen and as

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.780 
Wacom digitizer before your S Pen and as
you<00:02:31.350> could<00:02:31.800> see<00:02:31.950> your<00:02:32.160> touch<00:02:32.460> doesn't

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
you could see your touch doesn't

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.480 
you could see your touch doesn't
register<00:02:33.090> but<00:02:33.750> uh<00:02:33.780> and<00:02:34.170> make<00:02:34.860> sure<00:02:35.040> this<00:02:35.250> one

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
register but uh and make sure this one

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.700 
register but uh and make sure this one
especially<00:02:36.450> if<00:02:36.540> you're<00:02:36.690> doing<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:37.020> test<00:02:37.260> make

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
especially if you're doing the test make

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:40.640 
especially if you're doing the test make
sure<00:02:37.950> you<00:02:38.130> don't<00:02:38.430> take<00:02:38.610> your<00:02:38.870> S<00:02:39.870> Pen<00:02:39.930> off<00:02:40.440> the

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
sure you don't take your S Pen off the

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.430 
sure you don't take your S Pen off the
screen<00:02:42.290> okay

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
screen okay

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.470 
screen okay
so<00:02:43.650> for<00:02:43.920> example<00:02:44.400> if<00:02:44.940> you<00:02:45.320> do<00:02:46.320> this<00:02:46.530> it'll<00:02:46.950> fail

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
so for example if you do this it'll fail

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.100 
so for example if you do this it'll fail
okay<00:02:48.480> so<00:02:49.050> let's<00:02:49.700> keep<00:02:50.700> on<00:02:50.940> going<00:02:50.970> or<00:02:51.600> led

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
okay so let's keep on going or led

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:53.800 
okay so let's keep on going or led
that's<00:02:52.410> interesting<00:02:53.040> could<00:02:53.220> see<00:02:53.400> that<00:02:53.520> the

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
that's interesting could see that the

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.410 
that's interesting could see that the
red<00:02:54.810> LED<00:02:55.350> on<00:02:55.380> top<00:02:55.740> has<00:02:56.010> a<00:02:56.040> lit<00:02:56.520> up<00:02:56.700> and<00:02:56.910> they<00:02:57.120> all

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
red LED on top has a lit up and they all

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.130 
red LED on top has a lit up and they all
turn<00:02:57.750> green<00:02:58.020> blue<00:02:58.620> and<00:02:59.100> then<00:02:59.250> finish<00:03:00.080> okay<00:03:01.080> so

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
turn green blue and then finish okay so

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.720 
turn green blue and then finish okay so
I'll<00:03:01.740> let<00:03:01.890> you<00:03:01.950> play<00:03:02.280> with<00:03:02.340> the<00:03:02.490> rest<00:03:02.760> of<00:03:02.970> it<00:03:04.730> so

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
I'll let you play with the rest of it so

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.180 
I'll let you play with the rest of it so
let's<00:03:06.000> go<00:03:06.150> to<00:03:06.209> the<00:03:06.450> next<00:03:06.660> one<00:03:06.900> this<00:03:07.740> one<00:03:07.800> is

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
let's go to the next one this one is

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.090 
let's go to the next one this one is
called<00:03:08.660> self<00:03:09.660> test<00:03:10.020> mode<00:03:10.290> and<00:03:10.560> to<00:03:10.709> get<00:03:10.860> to<00:03:11.010> it

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
called self test mode and to get to it

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.910 
called self test mode and to get to it
you<00:03:11.160> need<00:03:11.280> to<00:03:11.430> do<00:03:11.550> this<00:03:11.700> downed<00:03:12.620> seven<00:03:13.620> three

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
you need to do this downed seven three

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:19.759 
you need to do this downed seven three
five<00:03:14.220> three<00:03:15.380> pounds<00:03:16.490> okay<00:03:17.490> and<00:03:18.769> it's

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
five three pounds okay and it's

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:21.350 
five three pounds okay and it's
interesting<00:03:20.070> when<00:03:20.340> you<00:03:20.459> go<00:03:20.640> to<00:03:20.700> the<00:03:20.940> first<00:03:21.180> one

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
interesting when you go to the first one

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.500 
interesting when you go to the first one
I'll<00:03:21.510> start<00:03:21.540> playing<00:03:22.110> this<00:03:22.290> a<00:03:22.910> kpop<00:03:23.910> I<00:03:24.239> don't

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
I'll start playing this a kpop I don't

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.449 
I'll start playing this a kpop I don't
know<00:03:24.600> if<00:03:24.870> will<00:03:25.080> be<00:03:25.230> different<00:03:25.650> for<00:03:25.800> you<00:03:26.010> but<00:03:26.430> I

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
know if will be different for you but I

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.870 
know if will be different for you but I
was<00:03:27.090> kind<00:03:27.330> of<00:03:27.390> surprised<00:03:27.840> that<00:03:28.019> happened<00:03:28.530> and

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
was kind of surprised that happened and

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.860 
was kind of surprised that happened and
there's<00:03:29.880> some<00:03:30.060> other<00:03:30.209> ones<00:03:30.450> there's<00:03:30.660> like<00:03:30.780> a

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
there's some other ones there's like a

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.770 
there's some other ones there's like a
built<00:03:31.110> in<00:03:31.260> camera<00:03:31.440> as<00:03:31.739> well<00:03:32.580> on<00:03:32.790> here<00:03:33.000> to<00:03:33.330> test

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
built in camera as well on here to test

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.420 
built in camera as well on here to test
your<00:03:33.930> camera<00:03:34.290> it's<00:03:34.440> like<00:03:34.530> a<00:03:34.830> really<00:03:35.280> basic

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
your camera it's like a really basic

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.370 
your camera it's like a really basic
camera<00:03:35.820> but<00:03:36.120> out<00:03:36.269> it<00:03:36.720> actually<00:03:36.870> takes<00:03:37.260> a

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
camera but out it actually takes a

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.820 
camera but out it actually takes a
picture<00:03:37.560> and<00:03:38.420> let's<00:03:39.420> see<00:03:39.630> what<00:03:39.780> else<00:03:39.830> there's

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
picture and let's see what else there's

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.370 
picture and let's see what else there's
some<00:03:41.010> interesting<00:03:41.310> ones<00:03:41.730> called<00:03:42.390> a<00:03:42.630> solar

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
some interesting ones called a solar

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.890 
some interesting ones called a solar
ometer<00:03:43.860> sensor<00:03:44.360> basically<00:03:45.360> points<00:03:45.690> to<00:03:45.780> the

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
ometer sensor basically points to the

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.030 
ometer sensor basically points to the
arrow<00:03:46.050> of<00:03:46.950> this<00:03:47.430> and<00:03:47.940> that's<00:03:48.450> pointing<00:03:48.840> up

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
arrow of this and that's pointing up

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.479 
arrow of this and that's pointing up
okay<00:03:50.040> and<00:03:50.780> there's<00:03:51.780> a<00:03:51.840> proximity<00:03:52.470> sensor<00:03:52.890> as

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
okay and there's a proximity sensor as

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:55.940 
okay and there's a proximity sensor as
you<00:03:53.610> can<00:03:53.730> see<00:03:53.959> I'll<00:03:54.959> just<00:03:55.019> have<00:03:55.470> my<00:03:55.650> finger

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
you can see I'll just have my finger

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.820 
you can see I'll just have my finger
over<00:03:56.100> the<00:03:56.370> proximity<00:03:56.730> sensor<00:03:57.060> and<00:03:57.830> it'll

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:58.830 
over the proximity sensor and it'll

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:00.470 
over the proximity sensor and it'll
react<00:03:59.400> there<00:03:59.670> same<00:03:59.940> thing<00:04:00.090> for<00:04:00.269> a<00:04:00.300> light

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
react there same thing for a light

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.560 
react there same thing for a light
sensor<00:04:00.840> right<00:04:01.769> just<00:04:02.220> cover<00:04:02.430> your<00:04:02.670> finger<00:04:03.090> with

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
sensor right just cover your finger with

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:07.610 
sensor right just cover your finger with
the<00:04:03.690> light<00:04:03.870> sensor<00:04:04.080> and<00:04:04.709> I'll<00:04:04.890> react<00:04:06.320> okay<00:04:07.320> and

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
the light sensor and I'll react okay and

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.560 
the light sensor and I'll react okay and
and<00:04:07.890> then<00:04:08.040> let's<00:04:08.250> go<00:04:08.400> to<00:04:08.459> the<00:04:08.640> last<00:04:09.000> test<00:04:09.360> now

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.570 
and then let's go to the last test now

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:15.080 
and then let's go to the last test now
this<00:04:10.049> one<00:04:10.549> you<00:04:11.549> will<00:04:11.730> need<00:04:12.060> a<00:04:13.549> code<00:04:14.549> for<00:04:14.940> your

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
this one you will need a code for your

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.110 
this one you will need a code for your
country<00:04:15.720> and<00:04:15.930> a<00:04:16.470> password<00:04:17.130> for<00:04:17.340> your<00:04:17.519> carrier

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
country and a password for your carrier

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.050 
country and a password for your carrier
and<00:04:18.390> I<00:04:18.870> only<00:04:19.140> have<00:04:19.470> the<00:04:19.650> one<00:04:19.830> for<00:04:20.070> Korea<00:04:20.519> and<00:04:20.880> my

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
and I only have the one for Korea and my

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.700 
and I only have the one for Korea and my
carrier<00:04:21.540> and<00:04:21.690> but<00:04:22.109> you<00:04:22.380> could<00:04:22.530> probably

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
carrier and but you could probably

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:24.590 
carrier and but you could probably
searched<00:04:23.280> the<00:04:23.520> internet<00:04:24.000> for<00:04:24.030> it

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
searched the internet for it

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.240 
searched the internet for it
so<00:04:25.169> anyway

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
so anyway

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.560 
so anyway
the<00:04:26.820> for<00:04:27.060> the<00:04:27.330> coat<00:04:27.540> for<00:04:27.780> my<00:04:27.930> phone<00:04:28.200> is<00:04:28.380> 2<00:04:28.560> 9<00:04:29.420> 7<00:04:30.420> 1

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570 
the for the coat for my phone is 2 9 7 1

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:38.590 
the for the coat for my phone is 2 9 7 1
2<00:04:30.750> 3<00:04:32.870> 5<00:04:33.870> 8<00:04:34.140> o<00:04:35.540> 8<00:04:36.540> 2<00:04:36.870> 1

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:38.600 
2 3 5 8 o 8 2 1

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.540 
2 3 5 8 o 8 2 1
so<00:04:39.600> I<00:04:39.630> saw<00:04:39.960> two<00:04:40.230> things<00:04:40.470> in<00:04:40.770> here<00:04:41.040> that<00:04:41.310> looked

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
so I saw two things in here that looked

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:44.750 
so I saw two things in here that looked
maybe<00:04:42.320> useful<00:04:43.320> I<00:04:43.350> haven't<00:04:43.800> really<00:04:44.160> tested<00:04:44.370> it

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:44.760 
maybe useful I haven't really tested it

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.150 
maybe useful I haven't really tested it
but<00:04:45.000> when<00:04:45.660> you<00:04:45.750> go<00:04:45.840> to<00:04:45.900> data<00:04:46.170> setting<00:04:46.620> and<00:04:46.770> do

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160 
but when you go to data setting and do

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.820 
but when you go to data setting and do
the<00:04:47.310> preferred<00:04:47.820> mode<00:04:48.150> you<00:04:48.930> could<00:04:49.110> select

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:49.830 
the preferred mode you could select

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:52.940 
the preferred mode you could select
either<00:04:50.010> like<00:04:50.670> LTE<00:04:51.270> only<00:04:51.930> or<00:04:52.260> maybe<00:04:52.560> if<00:04:52.740> you

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:52.950 
either like LTE only or maybe if you

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:55.820 
either like LTE only or maybe if you
wanted<00:04:53.280> to<00:04:53.660> conserve<00:04:54.660> battery<00:04:54.990> turn<00:04:55.500> off<00:04:55.650> the

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:55.830 
wanted to conserve battery turn off the

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.040 
wanted to conserve battery turn off the
LTE<00:04:56.520> radio<00:04:56.670> I<00:04:57.090> believe<00:04:57.570> you<00:04:57.720> could<00:04:57.870> select

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050 
LTE radio I believe you could select

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:03.530 
LTE radio I believe you could select
maybe<00:04:58.610> a<00:04:59.610> video<00:05:00.120> only<00:05:00.780> or<00:05:01.290> you<00:05:02.030> know<00:05:03.030> some<00:05:03.510> of

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:03.540 
maybe a video only or you know some of

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:06.620 
maybe a video only or you know some of
these<00:05:03.720> options<00:05:03.990> here<00:05:04.440> and<00:05:04.730> I'm<00:05:05.730> not<00:05:05.880> 100%<00:05:06.570> sure

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:06.630 
these options here and I'm not 100% sure

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:08.930 
these options here and I'm not 100% sure
if<00:05:06.990> it<00:05:07.170> will<00:05:07.290> turn<00:05:07.500> off<00:05:07.590> your<00:05:07.770> LTE<00:05:08.130> radio<00:05:08.250> but<00:05:08.820> I

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:08.940 
if it will turn off your LTE radio but I

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:10.850 
if it will turn off your LTE radio but I
believe<00:05:09.300> this<00:05:09.510> is<00:05:09.570> what<00:05:09.870> people<00:05:10.170> use<00:05:10.350> to<00:05:10.620> try

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860 
believe this is what people use to try

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.850 
believe this is what people use to try
to<00:05:10.890> conserve<00:05:11.400> power<00:05:11.820> with<00:05:12.690> their<00:05:12.840> LTE<00:05:13.230> radios

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:13.860 
to conserve power with their LTE radios

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:16.220 
to conserve power with their LTE radios
and<00:05:14.450> next<00:05:15.450> thing<00:05:15.570> I<00:05:15.690> saw<00:05:15.900> that<00:05:16.080> was

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:16.230 
and next thing I saw that was

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:19.400 
and next thing I saw that was
interesting<00:05:16.770> was<00:05:16.890> a<00:05:16.980> USB<00:05:17.490> setting<00:05:17.910> by<00:05:18.900> default

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:19.410 
interesting was a USB setting by default

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:22.040 
interesting was a USB setting by default
it's<00:05:19.650> set<00:05:19.770> at<00:05:20.160> MTP<00:05:21.000> which<00:05:21.300> is<00:05:21.480> probably<00:05:21.930> the

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.050 
it's set at MTP which is probably the

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:25.010 
it's set at MTP which is probably the
latest<00:05:22.940> connection<00:05:23.940> mode<00:05:24.180> to<00:05:24.390> your<00:05:24.510> computer

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.020 
latest connection mode to your computer

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:27.200 
latest connection mode to your computer
but<00:05:25.710> if<00:05:25.890> you<00:05:26.010> wanted<00:05:26.340> to<00:05:26.400> do<00:05:26.700> something<00:05:27.060> more

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.210 
but if you wanted to do something more

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:30.800 
but if you wanted to do something more
low-level<00:05:28.280> so<00:05:29.280> that<00:05:29.490> for<00:05:30.120> example<00:05:30.419> when<00:05:30.690> you

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:30.810 
low-level so that for example when you

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:34.730 
low-level so that for example when you
plug<00:05:31.080> this<00:05:31.290> phone<00:05:31.560> into<00:05:31.890> a<00:05:32.160> older<00:05:32.820> style<00:05:33.740> dock

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:34.740 
plug this phone into a older style dock

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.880 
plug this phone into a older style dock
that<00:05:35.250> tries<00:05:35.550> to<00:05:35.580> read<00:05:36.090> your<00:05:36.530> Galaxy<00:05:37.530> Note<00:05:37.560> 2

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:37.890 
that tries to read your Galaxy Note 2

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:40.700 
that tries to read your Galaxy Note 2
guys<00:05:38.040> like<00:05:38.310> a<00:05:38.630> USB<00:05:39.630> Drive<00:05:39.900> maybe<00:05:40.230> could<00:05:40.470> set

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:40.710 
guys like a USB Drive maybe could set

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:42.920 
guys like a USB Drive maybe could set
one<00:05:40.740> of<00:05:40.980> these<00:05:41.130> and<00:05:41.400> it<00:05:41.520> might<00:05:41.790> work<00:05:42.030> I<00:05:42.360> know

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:42.930 
one of these and it might work I know

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:44.690 
one of these and it might work I know
once<00:05:43.110> again<00:05:43.260> I<00:05:43.380> haven't<00:05:43.590> tested<00:05:43.830> it<00:05:44.130> so<00:05:44.340> anyway

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:44.700 
once again I haven't tested it so anyway

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:46.610 
once again I haven't tested it so anyway
that's<00:05:45.090> the<00:05:45.240> end<00:05:45.419> of<00:05:45.510> this<00:05:45.660> episode<00:05:46.200> and<00:05:46.229> I
