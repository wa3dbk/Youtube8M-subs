 Hello 

00:00:21.499 --> 00:00:25.749
 today talks about how to choose in wearing safety glasses legal rules 

00:00:25.749 --> 00:00:28.419
 for roku security are 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:32.539
 first do not withdraw while you are in business with in areas at risk 

00:00:32.539 --> 00:00:35.539
 even if it is just passing through 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.100
 approached the area place your games 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.210
 always wear glasses in perfect condition pce partly loose 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.420
 minds should not be lined up dirty or dirty 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.840
 always choose eyeglasses with anti-scratch lens 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.050
 as it ensures a much longer shelf life with the protection 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.460
 to use scratched minds that can affect your vision 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.120
 the organs must protect the entire eye area 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.900
 choose a model that fits your face better 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.840
 one option is to choose glasses with compliance settings and at 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.090
 of the arts 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.090
 helped to better accommodate the horts its easy 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.690
 always look for a safe jump 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.590
 it keeps you away from the steppe 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.590
 keeping others hanging when not in the area 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.520
 and also avoids accidents with a drop of glasses on food machinery the 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.720
 chemical 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.230
 an important tip 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:40.240
 is that the lanyard in some pots should be secured glued to the 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.250
 tie of the glasses 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.010
 it should only be docked and ready for 10 in carton 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:47.790
 in case of any hostile act 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.060
 8th 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.830
 how many slow things 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:52.360
 the rules are 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.090
 and pasted to clear indoor environments 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.490
 but can be used in outdoor environments as long as there is no 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.320
 user has access 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.610
 example are very cloudy days 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.610
 in which a dark lens may impair vision 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.879
 the composition the movie 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:13.299
 and there was adhesion to outdoor environments with less intense age. 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:14.789
 artificial' 

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:17.789
 since they are welding the infrared 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:20.189
 yellow or amparo 

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:22.779
 are for the month of March - age 

00:02:22.779 --> 00:02:27.419
 in one example is the user working at night time in earth environments 

00:02:27.419 --> 00:02:32.199
 as workers drivers there is also the minds see shoot with 

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:34.179
 infrared that 

00:02:34.179 --> 00:02:36.779
 but only specific 

00:02:36.779 --> 00:02:40.059
 out that color of teeth in another video 

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:44.129
 When selecting the security organs, the 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:45.919
 risk that the activity offers 

00:02:45.919 --> 00:02:48.269
 and the games that best fits 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:52.499
 risk areas as in activities with machines in the 

00:02:52.499 --> 00:02:53.419
 flyers 

00:02:53.419 --> 00:02:56.739
 is that he or with the larger ones as an apollo with 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:58.139
 including myself 

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:00.109
 but if the risk is very low 

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:02.309
 with a feather product separation 

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:05.569
 you can choose smaller eggs as a war 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:09.079
 any questions I spoke with the technical consultant of the dance
