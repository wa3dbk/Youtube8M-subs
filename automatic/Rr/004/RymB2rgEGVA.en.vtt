00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:06.260
 Today's video is about how to play 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:11.160
 how to play minecraft minecraft online 

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:13.010
 edit a tablet to a cell phone 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.350
 good 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:17.300
 one of the most important parts is 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:19.910
 have the same samples as me here 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.810
 I have in the tablet I have the 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.869
 minecraft pocket edition 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.580
 the 0.10 point 5 same as I have it in the 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.600
 cellular is one of the very parties 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.670
 important 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:33.340
 and also another very important part is 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:35.020
 be connected to the same network 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.990
 Wifi 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:40.900
 and after that after we're 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:45.150
 connected to the wifi network what are we going to 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:45.150
 do is put us to minecraft the two 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.090
 thereafter 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.100
 and we will create another world 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.600
 I want to put 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:10.409
 we put in the world 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:13.609
 we hope since this world 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.609
 we get into options 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.619
 we changed the name 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.720
 if we wanted in my case it will be closed 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.860
 since it is 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.500
 it is very important another part very 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:36.890
 important is to have this on 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:39.280
 to put it and that's good relationship 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.940
 we start 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.940
 we came back 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.480
 and here I get 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.660
 all 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.370
 I think the name of 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.570
 from my friend 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.570
 I put you in the world 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.860
 and here we are both to see that 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.680
 is 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:12.039
 this serves 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:12.039
