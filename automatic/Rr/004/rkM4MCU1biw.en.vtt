00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
if they get baron for like a very long

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.030 
if they get baron for like a very long
time<00:01:36.570> let's<00:01:37.079> just<00:01:37.229> try<00:01:37.320> to<00:01:37.380> get<00:01:37.500> bottom<00:01:37.799> in<00:01:37.890> him

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
time let's just try to get bottom in him

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.039 
time let's just try to get bottom in him
and<00:01:38.159> what<00:01:39.150> I'll<00:01:39.299> trying<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.630> do<00:01:39.689> there<00:01:39.840> was<00:01:39.990> I

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
and what I'll trying to do there was I

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:40.999 
and what I'll trying to do there was I
was<00:01:40.140> just<00:01:40.229> going<00:01:40.350> to<00:01:40.439> try<00:01:40.530> to<00:01:40.560> install<00:01:40.829> their

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
was just going to try to install their

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.289 
was just going to try to install their
base<00:01:41.130> while<00:01:41.369> we<00:01:41.670> could<00:01:41.820> potentially<00:01:41.909> take

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
base while we could potentially take

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.969 
base while we could potentially take
their<00:01:42.450> in<00:01:42.570> it<00:01:42.750> and<00:01:43.110> maybe<00:01:43.259> end<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.560> game<00:01:43.680> but

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
their in it and maybe end the game but

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.590 
their in it and maybe end the game but
obviously<00:01:44.189> doesn't<00:01:44.700> work<00:01:44.820> out<00:01:44.970> but<00:01:45.420> it<00:01:45.450> was<00:01:45.570> a

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
obviously doesn't work out but it was a

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.810 
obviously doesn't work out but it was a
risk<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:46.020> you<00:01:46.079> know<00:01:46.350> it<00:01:47.280> was<00:01:47.430> a<00:01:47.460> risk<00:01:47.610> I<00:01:47.700> could

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
risk and you know it was a risk I could

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.850 
risk and you know it was a risk I could
have<00:01:47.909> been<00:01:48.360> a<00:01:48.390> really<00:01:48.570> high<00:01:48.780> reward<00:01:49.140> but<00:01:49.649> at

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
have been a really high reward but at

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.590 
have been a really high reward but at
the<00:01:49.950> same<00:01:50.100> time<00:01:50.250> it<00:01:50.460> was<00:01:50.490> something<00:01:50.579> that<00:01:50.850> well

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
the same time it was something that well

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.149 
the same time it was something that well
where<00:01:51.990> we<00:01:52.110> wouldn't<00:01:52.380> be<00:01:52.530> affected<00:01:52.770> too<00:01:52.920> much

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
where we wouldn't be affected too much

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.469 
where we wouldn't be affected too much
because<00:01:53.430> we<00:01:53.460> had<00:01:53.700> complete<00:01:54.000> control<00:01:54.090> over<00:01:54.299> the

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
because we had complete control over the

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.810 
because we had complete control over the
bottom<00:01:54.689> side<00:01:55.100> then<00:01:56.100> how<00:01:56.250> does<00:01:56.310> it<00:01:56.430> feel<00:01:56.549> to<00:01:56.610> be

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
bottom side then how does it feel to be

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.459 
bottom side then how does it feel to be
back<00:01:56.850> in<00:01:57.030> mid<00:01:57.270> lane<00:01:57.420> now<00:01:57.570> that<00:01:57.750> Dexter's<00:01:58.200> here

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
back in mid lane now that Dexter's here

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.319 
back in mid lane now that Dexter's here
you<00:01:58.680> can<00:01:58.829> sit<00:01:59.070> in<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.159> mid<00:01:59.340> lane<00:01:59.549> what's<00:02:00.210> it

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
you can sit in the mid lane what's it

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.270 
you can sit in the mid lane what's it
like<00:02:00.479> knowing<00:02:00.899> that<00:02:00.930> you<00:02:01.170> know<00:02:01.200> you're<00:02:01.950> able

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
like knowing that you know you're able

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.450 
like knowing that you know you're able
to<00:02:02.399> just<00:02:02.610> kind<00:02:02.820> of<00:02:02.880> control<00:02:03.329> the<00:02:03.360> game<00:02:03.630> uh<00:02:04.460> it's

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
to just kind of control the game uh it's

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.999 
to just kind of control the game uh it's
kind<00:02:05.610> of<00:02:05.810> nice<00:02:06.810> I<00:02:07.170> guess<00:02:07.380> well<00:02:07.530> I<00:02:07.560> mean<00:02:07.770> in<00:02:07.950> a

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
kind of nice I guess well I mean in a

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.889 
kind of nice I guess well I mean in a
sense<00:02:08.280> I<00:02:08.459> feel<00:02:08.489> like<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.970> jungle<00:02:09.360> still<00:02:09.660> does

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
sense I feel like the jungle still does

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.540 
sense I feel like the jungle still does
control<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:10.379> game<00:02:10.500> it's<00:02:11.190> basically<00:02:11.430> the

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
control the game it's basically the

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.880 
control the game it's basically the
jungle<00:02:11.910> I'm<00:02:12.000> in<00:02:12.239> like<00:02:12.599> that<00:02:12.840> really<00:02:13.020> do<00:02:13.260> it

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
jungle I'm in like that really do it

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.040 
jungle I'm in like that really do it
and<00:02:13.950> I<00:02:14.069> feel<00:02:14.520> like<00:02:14.550> that<00:02:14.790> game<00:02:14.970> was<00:02:15.330> kind<00:02:15.720> of<00:02:15.840> a

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
and I feel like that game was kind of a

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.410 
and I feel like that game was kind of a
poor<00:02:16.650> performance<00:02:16.830> between<00:02:17.250> us<00:02:17.490> to<00:02:17.700> like<00:02:18.270> we

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
poor performance between us to like we

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:19.940 
poor performance between us to like we
could<00:02:18.540> have<00:02:18.569> done<00:02:18.720> a<00:02:18.780> bit<00:02:18.990> more<00:02:19.230> and<00:02:19.440> it's

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
could have done a bit more and it's

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.770 
could have done a bit more and it's
really<00:02:20.100> hard<00:02:20.340> for<00:02:20.400> us<00:02:20.640> to<00:02:20.670> work<00:02:21.660> together

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
really hard for us to work together

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.530 
really hard for us to work together
because<00:02:22.610> like<00:02:23.610> we<00:02:23.790> know<00:02:24.030> we're<00:02:24.330> still<00:02:24.480> getting

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
because like we know we're still getting

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:25.670 
because like we know we're still getting
to<00:02:24.690> know<00:02:24.900> each<00:02:24.990> other<00:02:25.230> and<00:02:25.319> we<00:02:25.410> still<00:02:25.590> have

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
to know each other and we still have

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.170 
to know each other and we still have
problems<00:02:26.069> and<00:02:26.250> we're<00:02:26.340> still<00:02:26.610> communicating

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
problems and we're still communicating

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.090 
problems and we're still communicating
and<00:02:27.300> trying<00:02:27.569> to<00:02:27.630> get<00:02:28.260> better<00:02:28.350> at<00:02:28.530> that<00:02:28.620> but<00:02:29.040> at

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
and trying to get better at that but at

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.400 
and trying to get better at that but at
the<00:02:29.130> same<00:02:29.310> time<00:02:29.490> like<00:02:29.730> our<00:02:29.880> mid<00:02:30.390> mid<00:02:30.930> game<00:02:31.140> duel

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
the same time like our mid mid game duel

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.130 
the same time like our mid mid game duel
wasn't<00:02:31.890> as<00:02:31.980> strong<00:02:32.130> as<00:02:32.550> like<00:02:33.180> something<00:02:33.990> else

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
wasn't as strong as like something else

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.530 
wasn't as strong as like something else
like<00:02:34.410> maybe<00:02:34.530> it<00:02:34.740> could<00:02:34.830> have<00:02:34.920> been<00:02:34.980> like<00:02:35.540> you

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
like maybe it could have been like you

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:37.970 
like maybe it could have been like you
know<00:02:36.570> like<00:02:36.660> viola<00:02:37.200> Blanc<00:02:37.410> or<00:02:37.500> something<00:02:37.800> right

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
know like viola Blanc or something right

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.949 
know like viola Blanc or something right
that<00:02:38.220> that'll<00:02:38.459> work<00:02:38.580> better<00:02:38.760> than<00:02:39.000> LeBlanc

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
that that'll work better than LeBlanc

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.290 
that that'll work better than LeBlanc
kha'zix<00:02:40.470> and<00:02:40.670> because<00:02:41.670> of<00:02:41.700> that<00:02:41.820> we<00:02:41.970> couldn't

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
kha'zix and because of that we couldn't

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:43.670 
kha'zix and because of that we couldn't
make<00:02:42.390> the<00:02:42.540> plays<00:02:42.720> that<00:02:42.750> we<00:02:43.020> needed<00:02:43.230> to<00:02:43.319> to

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
make the plays that we needed to to

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.710 
make the plays that we needed to to
carry<00:02:43.920> the<00:02:44.370> mid-game<00:02:44.730> and<00:02:44.970> that's<00:02:45.540> kind<00:02:45.690> of

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
carry the mid-game and that's kind of

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.320 
carry the mid-game and that's kind of
our<00:02:45.870> fault<00:02:46.050> for<00:02:46.260> picking<00:02:46.860> kind<00:02:47.040> of<00:02:47.130> poorly<00:02:47.700> but

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
our fault for picking kind of poorly but

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.510 
our fault for picking kind of poorly but

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
could win a game without getting a lot

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.640 
could win a game without getting a lot
of<00:02:56.760> kills<00:02:57.090> how<00:02:57.660> did<00:02:57.810> that<00:02:57.959> kind<00:02:58.110> of<00:02:58.200> work<00:02:58.410> what

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
of kills how did that kind of work what

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.009 
of kills how did that kind of work what
is<00:02:58.769> what<00:02:59.010> formulates<00:02:59.610> CLG<00:03:00.180> to<00:03:00.330> kind<00:03:00.510> of<00:03:00.600> get

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
is what formulates CLG to kind of get

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:03.740 
is what formulates CLG to kind of get
that<00:03:01.230> result<00:03:01.670> well<00:03:02.670> you<00:03:02.880> get<00:03:03.000> this<00:03:03.180> result<00:03:03.510> if

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
that result well you get this result if

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.570 
that result well you get this result if
you<00:03:03.870> just<00:03:04.050> simply<00:03:04.380> auto<00:03:04.709> tate<00:03:04.980> the<00:03:05.100> enemy<00:03:05.370> if

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
you just simply auto tate the enemy if

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:06.920 
you just simply auto tate the enemy if
you're<00:03:05.790> better<00:03:05.970> than<00:03:06.269> the<00:03:06.450> enemy<00:03:06.720> at

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
you're better than the enemy at

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.229 
you're better than the enemy at
rotations<00:03:07.410> then<00:03:08.040> you<00:03:08.430> set<00:03:08.610> up<00:03:08.760> something<00:03:09.030> you

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
rotations then you set up something you

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:10.520 
rotations then you set up something you
push<00:03:09.420> the<00:03:09.540> way<00:03:09.660> if<00:03:09.720> you<00:03:09.900> have<00:03:09.989> wave<00:03:10.170> control

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
push the way if you have wave control

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.920 
push the way if you have wave control
and<00:03:11.180> if<00:03:12.180> you<00:03:12.360> know<00:03:12.480> what's<00:03:12.660> going<00:03:12.840> to<00:03:12.870> happen

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
and if you know what's going to happen

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.270 
and if you know what's going to happen
in<00:03:13.230> the<00:03:13.290> next<00:03:13.380> minute<00:03:13.560> of<00:03:13.739> the<00:03:13.830> game<00:03:13.860> and<00:03:14.250> the

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
in the next minute of the game and the

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.610 
in the next minute of the game and the
open<00:03:15.180> it<00:03:15.269> doesn't<00:03:15.540> then<00:03:15.840> you<00:03:16.170> have<00:03:16.290> the<00:03:16.440> clear

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
open it doesn't then you have the clear

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.920 
open it doesn't then you have the clear
advantage<00:03:16.680> and<00:03:17.130> we<00:03:18.000> usually<00:03:18.480> just<00:03:18.510> try<00:03:18.870> to

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
advantage and we usually just try to

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.020 
advantage and we usually just try to
control<00:03:19.260> waves<00:03:19.470> and<00:03:19.860> we<00:03:20.280> always<00:03:20.519> ping<00:03:20.880> the

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
control waves and we always ping the

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.180 
control waves and we always ping the
wave<00:03:21.180> where<00:03:21.630> we<00:03:21.720> going<00:03:21.989> at<00:03:22.140> and<00:03:22.440> yeah<00:03:23.010> if<00:03:23.130> you

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
wave where we going at and yeah if you

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.240 
wave where we going at and yeah if you
have<00:03:23.280> wave<00:03:23.430> control<00:03:23.790> you<00:03:23.910> can<00:03:24.030> just<00:03:25.070> form<00:03:26.070> the

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
have wave control you can just form the

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:27.890 
have wave control you can just form the
waves<00:03:26.579> like<00:03:27.180> you<00:03:27.329> want<00:03:27.540> to<00:03:27.660> take<00:03:27.810> the

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
waves like you want to take the

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.229 
waves like you want to take the
objectives<00:03:28.350> and<00:03:28.500> yeah<00:03:29.130> if<00:03:29.400> we<00:03:29.640> have<00:03:29.760> good<00:03:29.790> junk

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
objectives and yeah if we have good junk

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.300 
objectives and yeah if we have good junk
country<00:03:30.510> like<00:03:30.660> over<00:03:30.900> the<00:03:31.019> jungle<00:03:31.799> we<00:03:32.040> have<00:03:32.160> got

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
country like over the jungle we have got

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.039 
country like over the jungle we have got
two<00:03:32.430> visions<00:03:32.700> then<00:03:32.970> we<00:03:33.120> can<00:03:33.239> just<00:03:33.390> all<00:03:33.600> take

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
two visions then we can just all take

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:35.690 
two visions then we can just all take
them<00:03:34.230> pretty<00:03:34.410> much<00:03:34.590> and<00:03:34.860> that's<00:03:35.130> how<00:03:35.370> you<00:03:35.430> can

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
them pretty much and that's how you can

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.250 
them pretty much and that's how you can
win<00:03:35.880> games<00:03:36.209> without<00:03:36.390> even<00:03:36.870> getting<00:03:36.959> killed

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
win games without even getting killed

double assessment doesn't work that well

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:11.479 
double assessment doesn't work that well
against<00:04:09.780> trip<00:04:09.930> to<00:04:10.019> the<00:04:10.079> front<00:04:10.260> line<00:04:10.410> and<00:04:10.799> we

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
against trip to the front line and we

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:12.620 
against trip to the front line and we
had<00:04:11.609> a<00:04:11.640> really<00:04:11.790> hard<00:04:11.880> time<00:04:12.000> actually<00:04:12.359> winning

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
had a really hard time actually winning

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:15.020 
had a really hard time actually winning
this<00:04:12.810> game<00:04:12.989> and<00:04:13.200> we<00:04:13.650> all<00:04:13.829> we<00:04:14.609> only<00:04:14.760> want

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
this game and we all we only want

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.090 
this game and we all we only want
because<00:04:15.209> we<00:04:15.359> all<00:04:15.480> rotated<00:04:15.840> them<00:04:15.930> and<00:04:16.140> yeah

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
because we all rotated them and yeah

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:18.319 
because we all rotated them and yeah
it's<00:04:17.340> a<00:04:17.430> rotation<00:04:17.760> with<00:04:17.880> even<00:04:18.060> better<00:04:18.209> we

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:18.329
