00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
present as well now to make the herb

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.740 
present as well now to make the herb
swags<00:01:13.530> you<00:01:13.740> want<00:01:13.920> to<00:01:14.010> cut<00:01:14.250> your<00:01:14.750> herbs

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
swags you want to cut your herbs

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.450 
swags you want to cut your herbs
whatever<00:01:16.170> you're<00:01:16.320> choose<00:01:16.560> to<00:01:16.740> use<00:01:16.950> and<00:01:17.250> I

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
whatever you're choose to use and I

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.789 
whatever you're choose to use and I
typically<00:01:17.880> start<00:01:18.360> with<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.659> longer<00:01:19.200> plants

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
typically start with the longer plants

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.640 
typically start with the longer plants
first<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.759> longer<00:01:21.180> branches<00:01:21.500> sometimes<00:01:22.500> they

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
first the longer branches sometimes they

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.219 
first the longer branches sometimes they
had<00:01:22.799> a<00:01:22.830> bit<00:01:23.280> of<00:01:23.310> a<00:01:23.490> curve<00:01:23.970> so<00:01:24.299> I<00:01:24.330> take<00:01:24.689> advantage

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
had a bit of a curve so I take advantage

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.289 
had a bit of a curve so I take advantage
of<00:01:25.380> that<00:01:25.560> curve<00:01:25.890> and<00:01:26.100> put<00:01:26.340> those<00:01:26.549> on<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.030> sides

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
of that curve and put those on the sides

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.929 
of that curve and put those on the sides
then<00:01:28.020> I<00:01:28.110> start<00:01:28.380> layering<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:29.130> shorter<00:01:29.610> things

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
then I start layering the shorter things

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.929 
then I start layering the shorter things
in<00:01:30.270> front<00:01:30.540> and<00:01:31.259> it's<00:01:31.530> very<00:01:31.799> important<00:01:32.460> to<00:01:32.549> use

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
in front and it's very important to use

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.600 
in front and it's very important to use
rubber<00:01:33.360> bands<00:01:33.810> for<00:01:34.530> assembling<00:01:35.369> these

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
rubber bands for assembling these

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.969 
rubber bands for assembling these
bundles<00:01:36.020> take<00:01:37.020> off<00:01:37.200> any<00:01:37.409> leaves<00:01:37.710> that<00:01:37.890> are

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
bundles take off any leaves that are

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.410 
bundles take off any leaves that are
going<00:01:38.159> to<00:01:38.220> be<00:01:38.400> in<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.790> area<00:01:38.970> in<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.240> rubber

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
going to be in the area in the rubber

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.929 
going to be in the area in the rubber
band<00:01:39.689> these<00:01:40.170> will<00:01:40.380> shrink<00:01:40.770> as<00:01:41.009> they<00:01:41.189> dry<00:01:41.579> so

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
band these will shrink as they dry so

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.550 
band these will shrink as they dry so
it's<00:01:42.060> important<00:01:42.540> to<00:01:42.570> have<00:01:42.780> rubber<00:01:43.079> bands<00:01:43.290> so

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
it's important to have rubber bands so

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.499 
it's important to have rubber bands so
that<00:01:43.710> they<00:01:43.829> shrink<00:01:44.220> along<00:01:44.610> with<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.210> herbs

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
that they shrink along with the herbs

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.429 
that they shrink along with the herbs
themselves<00:01:46.350> and<00:01:47.030> they<00:01:48.030> don't<00:01:48.180> fall<00:01:48.509> out<00:01:48.750> so

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
themselves and they don't fall out so

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.160 
themselves and they don't fall out so
once<00:01:50.040> you<00:01:50.189> have<00:01:50.220> your<00:01:50.670> bundle<00:01:51.119> as<00:01:51.390> thick<00:01:51.930> as

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
once you have your bundle as thick as

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.810 
once you have your bundle as thick as
you<00:01:52.290> think<00:01:52.560> you<00:01:52.710> want<00:01:52.979> now<00:01:53.159> I'll<00:01:53.310> take<00:01:53.640> these

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
you think you want now I'll take these

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.030

circulation so not a closet or an attic

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.490 
circulation so not a closet or an attic
but<00:02:54.240> it<00:02:54.330> needs<00:02:54.540> to<00:02:54.750> be<00:02:54.870> out<00:02:55.050> of<00:02:55.080> direct

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.350 
but it needs to be out of direct
sunlight<00:02:55.590> because<00:02:56.100> sunlight<00:02:56.460> will<00:02:56.820> fade<00:02:57.120> the

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.020 
colors of the leaves and the flowers and
they<00:03:01.560> will<00:03:01.830> tend<00:03:02.220> to<00:03:02.370> start<00:03:02.610> to<00:03:02.760> get<00:03:02.910> a<00:03:02.940> bit

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
they will tend to start to get a bit

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.240
