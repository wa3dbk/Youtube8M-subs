heavy<00:00:55.930> the<00:00:56.109> first<00:00:56.289> iPad<00:00:56.710> was<00:00:56.949> so<00:00:57.250> this<00:00:57.489> one<00:00:57.640> is

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:57.730 
heavy the first iPad was so this one is

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.880 
heavy the first iPad was so this one is
about<00:00:57.850> four<00:00:58.329> ounces<00:00:58.539> lighter<00:00:58.989> so<00:00:59.679> is<00:00:59.800> this

00:00:59.880 --> 00:00:59.890 
about four ounces lighter so is this

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:01.139 
about four ounces lighter so is this
easier<00:01:00.219> to<00:01:00.340> hold<00:01:00.429> for<00:01:00.609> a<00:01:00.670> long<00:01:00.760> period<00:01:00.910> of<00:01:01.090> time

00:01:01.139 --> 00:01:01.149 
easier to hold for a long period of time

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:03.990 
easier to hold for a long period of time
yeah<00:01:01.570> four<00:01:01.929> ounces<00:01:02.170> easier<00:01:02.469> it<00:01:03.280> is<00:01:03.339> which<00:01:03.730> by

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:04.000 
yeah four ounces easier it is which by

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.820 
yeah four ounces easier it is which by
the<00:01:04.059> way<00:01:04.150> is<00:01:04.210> noticeable<00:01:04.989> so<00:01:05.230> I<00:01:05.260> know<00:01:05.710> when

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:05.830 
the way is noticeable so I know when

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:07.050 
the way is noticeable so I know when
this<00:01:05.920> was<00:01:06.070> dropped<00:01:06.280> off<00:01:06.430> I<00:01:06.610> picked<00:01:06.820> it<00:01:06.880> up<00:01:06.940> and

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 
this was dropped off I picked it up and

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.820 
this was dropped off I picked it up and
went<00:01:07.210> Pope<00:01:07.360> but<00:01:07.660> holy<00:01:07.960> hell<00:01:08.080> that<00:01:08.410> is<00:01:08.440> a<00:01:08.590> little

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:08.830 
went Pope but holy hell that is a little

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:10.560 
went Pope but holy hell that is a little
bit<00:01:08.980> lighter<00:01:09.280> well<00:01:09.670> I<00:01:09.700> think<00:01:10.030> it<00:01:10.150> just<00:01:10.270> feels

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:10.570 
bit lighter well I think it just feels

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.450 
bit lighter well I think it just feels
lighter<00:01:10.840> because<00:01:11.020> it's<00:01:11.290> it's<00:01:11.560> thinner<00:01:11.860> and

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460 
lighter because it's it's thinner and

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.400 
lighter because it's it's thinner and
it's<00:01:12.610> four<00:01:12.790> ounces<00:01:13.090> lighter<00:01:13.240> I<00:01:13.660> mean<00:01:14.050> those

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:14.410 
it's four ounces lighter I mean those

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:16.050 
it's four ounces lighter I mean those
two<00:01:14.650> things<00:01:14.830> combined<00:01:15.340> make<00:01:15.490> this<00:01:15.820> feel

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.060 
two things combined make this feel

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:17.969 
two things combined make this feel
lighter<00:01:16.329> and<00:01:16.600> thinner<00:01:16.659> than<00:01:17.380> the<00:01:17.530> original

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:17.979 
lighter and thinner than the original

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:21.719 
lighter and thinner than the original
iPad<00:01:18.390> but<00:01:19.390> no<00:01:19.540> again<00:01:19.869> it<00:01:20.409> is<00:01:20.619> holding<00:01:21.460> it<00:01:21.549> for
