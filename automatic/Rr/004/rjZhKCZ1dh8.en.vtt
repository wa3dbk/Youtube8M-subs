00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
mad scientist these drums are so

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.990 
mad scientist these drums are so
revolutionary<00:03:49.080> and<00:03:49.980> they<00:03:50.160> look<00:03:50.400> so<00:03:50.790> different

anything<00:03:51.660> on<00:03:51.840> the<00:03:52.019> market<00:03:53.750> if<00:03:54.750> anybody<00:03:55.560> does

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
anything on the market if anybody does

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.600 
anything on the market if anybody does
something<00:03:56.489> using<00:03:57.030> basically<00:03:57.690> the<00:03:58.680> technology

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
something using basically the technology

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:02.000 
something using basically the technology
that<00:04:00.000> I've<00:04:00.209> developed<00:04:00.599> to<00:04:01.260> make<00:04:01.410> these<00:04:01.620> drums

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
that I've developed to make these drums

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.309 
that I've developed to make these drums
work<00:04:02.370> and<00:04:02.790> they're<00:04:03.330> gonna<00:04:03.450> be<00:04:03.690> obvious

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:04.319 
work and they're gonna be obvious

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:05.120 
work and they're gonna be obvious
knock-offs

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
knock-offs

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.729 
knock-offs
I<00:04:05.430> mean<00:04:05.930> everybody's<00:04:06.930> gonna<00:04:07.049> say<00:04:07.350> well<00:04:07.590> that's

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739 
I mean everybody's gonna say well that's

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:10.460 
I mean everybody's gonna say well that's
a<00:04:07.950> knockoff<00:04:08.430> of<00:04:08.459> a<00:04:08.850> brass<00:04:09.150> ball<00:04:09.540> break<00:04:09.989> if<00:04:10.410> you

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
a knockoff of a brass ball break if you

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.320 
a knockoff of a brass ball break if you
look<00:04:10.830> at<00:04:10.950> these<00:04:11.130> they<00:04:11.400> almost<00:04:11.640> look<00:04:12.090> like

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:12.330 
look at these they almost look like

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.580 
look at these they almost look like
they're<00:04:12.569> floating<00:04:12.930> on<00:04:13.620> the<00:04:13.980> side<00:04:14.220> of<00:04:14.370> the<00:04:14.489> drum

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
they're floating on the side of the drum

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:19.610 
they're floating on the side of the drum
so<00:04:16.590> I<00:04:17.329> don't<00:04:18.329> think<00:04:18.510> there<00:04:18.660> is<00:04:18.690> any<00:04:19.109> possible

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
so I don't think there is any possible

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.159 
so I don't think there is any possible
way<00:04:19.769> to<00:04:19.829> get<00:04:20.070> less<00:04:20.609> contact<00:04:21.419> with<00:04:21.780> the<00:04:21.930> shell

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
way to get less contact with the shell

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:25.070 
way to get less contact with the shell
than<00:04:23.130> these<00:04:23.370> lugs<00:04:23.729> if<00:04:24.030> anybody's<00:04:24.540> got<00:04:24.780> a<00:04:24.810> way

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
than these lugs if anybody's got a way

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:45.340 
than these lugs if anybody's got a way
I'd<00:04:25.290> love<00:04:25.680> to<00:04:25.919> see<00:04:26.130> it
