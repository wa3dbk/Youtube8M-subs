these exercises truly measure your

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.760 
these exercises truly measure your
strength<00:01:14.549> because<00:01:14.790> they<00:01:15.630> are<00:01:15.810> all<00:01:15.990> compound

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
strength because they are all compound

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.859 
strength because they are all compound
movements<00:01:17.430> which<00:01:18.180> means<00:01:18.479> that<00:01:18.720> they<00:01:18.840> are

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
movements which means that they are

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.039 
movements which means that they are
involving<00:01:19.500> two<00:01:19.830> or<00:01:20.189> more<00:01:20.549> body<00:01:21.240> parts<00:01:21.450> this

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
involving two or more body parts this

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.330 
involving two or more body parts this
was<00:01:22.229> actually<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.619> first<00:01:22.710> time<00:01:23.040> that<00:01:23.159> I<00:01:23.189> was

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
was actually the first time that I was

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:29.810 
was actually the first time that I was
able<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.640> do<00:01:23.909> one<00:01:24.900> full<00:01:25.590> rep<00:01:26.009> by<00:01:26.790> myself<00:01:27.560> at<00:01:28.820> 95

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
able to do one full rep by myself at 95

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.160 
able to do one full rep by myself at 95
on<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:31.320> bench<00:01:31.500> press

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.290 

and<00:01:35.409> this<00:01:35.740> is<00:01:35.890> actually<00:01:36.250> my<00:01:36.370> benchpress<00:01:36.700> setup

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:37.300 
and this is actually my benchpress setup

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.070 
and this is actually my benchpress setup
I<00:01:37.540> just<00:01:38.110> kind<00:01:38.290> of<00:01:38.350> like<00:01:38.530> push<00:01:38.979> myself<00:01:39.190> back<00:01:39.580> and

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.080 
I just kind of like push myself back and

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.550 
I just kind of like push myself back and
then<00:01:41.080> pull<00:01:42.070> forward<00:01:42.370> I<00:01:42.930> have<00:01:43.930> heard<00:01:44.229> that<00:01:44.500> that

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
then pull forward I have heard that that

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.290 
then pull forward I have heard that that
lives<00:01:44.979> are<00:01:45.369> considered<00:01:45.880> to<00:01:45.970> be<00:01:46.060> the<00:01:46.180> most

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:46.300 
lives are considered to be the most

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.560 
lives are considered to be the most
impressive<00:01:47.110> out<00:01:47.740> of<00:01:47.920> all<00:01:48.100> the<00:01:48.250> three<00:01:48.570> because

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.570 
impressive out of all the three because

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:51.960 
impressive out of all the three because
it<00:01:49.690> involves<00:01:50.260> explosive<00:01:51.160> strength<00:01:51.640> and

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:51.970 
it involves explosive strength and

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.600 
it involves explosive strength and
overall<00:01:52.240> power<00:01:52.840> so<00:01:53.380> that<00:01:54.009> just<00:01:54.250> means<00:01:54.430> that

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
overall power so that just means that

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.420 
overall power so that just means that
you're<00:01:54.759> working<00:01:55.060> your<00:01:55.210> entire<00:01:55.420> body<00:01:56.430> when

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 
you're working your entire body when

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:58.950 
you're working your entire body when
