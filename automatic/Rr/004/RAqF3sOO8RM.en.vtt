questions about the Lance camper wiring
system<00:00:15.360> and<00:00:15.839> today<00:00:16.230> we'd<00:00:16.529> like<00:00:16.680> to<00:00:16.830> talk<00:00:16.980> to

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
system and today we'd like to talk to

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.890 
system and today we'd like to talk to
you<00:00:17.220> specifically<00:00:17.760> about<00:00:17.910> why<00:00:18.390> we<00:00:18.690> use<00:00:18.869> a

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
you specifically about why we use a

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.740 
you specifically about why we use a
special<00:00:19.230> plug<00:00:19.650> to<00:00:20.430> make<00:00:20.640> your<00:00:21.000> camper<00:00:21.390> to<00:00:21.570> your

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
special plug to make your camper to your

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.769 
special plug to make your camper to your
truck<00:00:22.160> most<00:00:23.160> automobiles<00:00:23.760> today<00:00:24.090> come<00:00:24.570> with<00:00:24.600> a

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
truck most automobiles today come with a

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.550 
truck most automobiles today come with a
bargeman<00:00:25.109> plug<00:00:25.560> which<00:00:25.830> is<00:00:25.859> a<00:00:26.010> 7-way<00:00:26.820> plug<00:00:27.560> one

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
bargeman plug which is a 7-way plug one

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.070 
bargeman plug which is a 7-way plug one
thing<00:00:28.740> about<00:00:28.949> this<00:00:29.160> plug<00:00:29.490> is<00:00:29.730> that<00:00:29.939> it<00:00:30.929> only

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
thing about this plug is that it only

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.650 
thing about this plug is that it only
comes<00:00:31.349> with<00:00:31.439> a<00:00:31.560> 10<00:00:31.800> gauge<00:00:32.070> wire<00:00:32.430> on<00:00:32.940> on<00:00:33.390> the

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
comes with a 10 gauge wire on on the

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.709 
comes with a 10 gauge wire on on the
system<00:00:34.050> itself<00:00:34.610> and<00:00:35.610> with<00:00:36.000> that<00:00:36.210> system

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
system itself and with that system

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.080 
system itself and with that system
basically<00:00:37.230> in<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.440> 10<00:00:37.649> gauge<00:00:37.890> wire<00:00:38.190> as<00:00:38.790> it's

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
basically in the 10 gauge wire as it's

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.600 
basically in the 10 gauge wire as it's
clearly<00:00:39.360> stated<00:00:39.989> in<00:00:40.440> their<00:00:40.680> wiring<00:00:41.160> harness

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
clearly stated in their wiring harness

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.720 
clearly stated in their wiring harness
is<00:00:41.790> that<00:00:42.420> it<00:00:42.870> will<00:00:43.050> carry<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:44.070> load<00:00:44.340> of

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
is that it will carry the the load of

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.029 
is that it will carry the the load of
the<00:00:45.329> amperage<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.140> voltage<00:00:46.590> from<00:00:46.890> the

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
the amperage and the voltage from the

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.029 
the amperage and the voltage from the
truck<00:00:47.340> to<00:00:47.899> basically<00:00:48.899> charge<00:00:49.350> your<00:00:49.559> batteries

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
truck to basically charge your batteries

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.319 
truck to basically charge your batteries
and<00:00:50.280> have<00:00:51.059> a<00:00:51.230> 12-volt<00:00:53.329> refrigerator

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
and have a 12-volt refrigerator

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.420 
and have a 12-volt refrigerator
basically<00:00:54.930> function<00:00:55.410> so<00:00:55.770> therefore<00:00:56.219> what<00:00:56.399> we

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
basically function so therefore what we

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.650 
basically function so therefore what we
do<00:00:56.760> is<00:00:57.360> we<00:00:57.600> have<00:00:57.719> a<00:00:57.750> custom<00:00:58.350> molded<00:00:59.449> plug<00:01:00.449> that

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
do is we have a custom molded plug that

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.869 
do is we have a custom molded plug that
is<00:01:00.780> made<00:01:01.020> and<00:01:01.199> when<00:01:01.890> this<00:01:02.129> custom<00:01:02.579> mold<00:01:02.760> to

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
is made and when this custom mold to

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.719 
is made and when this custom mold to
plug<00:01:03.149> it<00:01:03.539> allows<00:01:03.870> for<00:01:04.229> an<00:01:04.470> eight<00:01:05.040> gauge<00:01:05.339> wire

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
plug it allows for an eight gauge wire

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.780 
plug it allows for an eight gauge wire
most<00:01:06.600> RVs<00:01:07.049> are<00:01:07.320> wired<00:01:07.590> with<00:01:07.890> eight<00:01:08.070> gauge<00:01:08.369> but

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
most RVs are wired with eight gauge but

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.120 
most RVs are wired with eight gauge but
if<00:01:08.880> you<00:01:09.000> put<00:01:09.210> a<00:01:09.240> 10<00:01:09.510> gauge<00:01:09.750> wire<00:01:10.110> coming<00:01:10.890> from

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
if you put a 10 gauge wire coming from

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.100 
if you put a 10 gauge wire coming from
the<00:01:11.310> truck<00:01:11.610> or<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:11.880> alternator<00:01:12.510> to<00:01:12.840> charge

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
the truck or the alternator to charge

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.929 
the truck or the alternator to charge
your<00:01:13.290> system<00:01:13.770> or<00:01:14.130> run<00:01:14.369> your<00:01:14.520> 12-volt

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
your system or run your 12-volt

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.510 
your system or run your 12-volt
refrigerator<00:01:15.720> it's<00:01:16.259> insufficient<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.280> carry

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
refrigerator it's insufficient to carry

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.850 
refrigerator it's insufficient to carry
the<00:01:17.729> load<00:01:17.939> and<00:01:18.150> still<00:01:18.720> run<00:01:19.409> everything

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
the load and still run everything

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.730 
the load and still run everything
properly<00:01:20.189> so<00:01:20.880> therefore<00:01:21.390> we<00:01:21.960> have<00:01:22.140> a<00:01:22.170> custom

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
properly so therefore we have a custom

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.920 
properly so therefore we have a custom
molded<00:01:23.130> plug<00:01:23.430> that<00:01:23.850> obviously<00:01:24.420> costs<00:01:24.780> more

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
molded plug that obviously costs more

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.469 
molded plug that obviously costs more
money<00:01:25.200> than<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.799> standard<00:01:26.159> barzmann<00:01:26.490> plug<00:01:26.939> to

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
money than the standard barzmann plug to

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.780 
money than the standard barzmann plug to
allow<00:01:27.689> for<00:01:27.960> all<00:01:28.110> of<00:01:28.259> your<00:01:28.520> appliances<00:01:29.520> and

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
allow for all of your appliances and

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.960 
allow for all of your appliances and
charge<00:01:30.329> system<00:01:30.630> to<00:01:30.930> actually<00:01:31.290> function<00:01:31.590> so<00:01:32.400> it

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
charge system to actually function so it

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.160 
charge system to actually function so it
also<00:01:33.150> allows<00:01:33.630> for<00:01:34.490> you<00:01:35.490> know<00:01:35.640> safety<00:01:36.270> along

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
also allows for you know safety along

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.899 
also allows for you know safety along
the<00:01:37.380> way<00:01:37.500> does<00:01:37.740> your<00:01:37.799> wires<00:01:38.130> won't<00:01:38.430> be<00:01:38.579> heating

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
the way does your wires won't be heating

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.940 
the way does your wires won't be heating
up<00:01:39.060> because<00:01:39.360> if<00:01:39.509> you<00:01:39.600> put<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:39.930> 10<00:01:40.409> gauge<00:01:40.680> rock

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
up because if you put the 10 gauge rock

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.030 
up because if you put the 10 gauge rock
wires<00:01:41.430> in<00:01:41.790> between<00:01:42.409> what's<00:01:43.409> going<00:01:43.590> to<00:01:43.649> happen

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
wires in between what's going to happen

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.800 
wires in between what's going to happen
there<00:01:44.189> is<00:01:44.250> a<00:01:44.310> dwyer<00:01:44.610> can<00:01:44.880> potentially<00:01:45.479> heat<00:01:45.630> up

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
there is a dwyer can potentially heat up

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.899 
there is a dwyer can potentially heat up
and<00:01:46.049> you<00:01:46.140> could<00:01:46.320> potentially<00:01:46.439> have<00:01:46.920> a<00:01:47.100> safety

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
and you could potentially have a safety

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.080 
and you could potentially have a safety
item<00:01:48.390> there<00:01:48.570> so<00:01:49.170> this<00:01:49.590> is<00:01:49.770> why<00:01:49.950> Lance<00:01:50.670> ensures

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
item there so this is why Lance ensures

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.569 
item there so this is why Lance ensures
your<00:01:51.329> safety<00:01:51.840> and<00:01:52.229> ensures<00:01:52.680> your<00:01:52.920> complete

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
your safety and ensures your complete
