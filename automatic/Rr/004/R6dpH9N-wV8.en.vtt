00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:12.870
 Welcome to the exercise film 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.160
 division of rational numbers in the following 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.310
 Let's take another look four 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.609
 Exercises to the first 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.560
 the task 1 j and this is about from 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.689
 break the text and round the 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.180
 results in two places after the 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:31.320
 comma we see here 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:35.070
 we have +28 once and we share 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.040
 this by - 07 the first thing we 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:42.420
 It is superior what the sign 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:46.079
 comes out plus - is - and now 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.840
 we can still share the 2807 we can 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.829
 this just put the chamber at 1 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.289
 move 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:57.199
 that means we actually expect 28 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.199
 through 7 and that corresponds to the 4th 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:06.510
 in the task 3g is about -48 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:09.060
 I shared - 36 we see here we 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.570
 here have two pay with the same 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:15.479
 sign - through - and - through - act 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.979
 plus and then we can still 48 through 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.759
 630 count 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.530
 and that gives four thirds how to 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.030
 maybe there will be another one 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.900
 Look at this here, that means we have 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:30.689
 48 through 36 and can accordingly 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.700
 Then cut us down there if that is you 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.549
 not immediately obvious 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.579
 either cut short with the six here 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.290
 or with the 3 or correspondingly even 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.250
 maybe you 'll catch the twelve 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.450
 with 2 on 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:47.759
 and then you come here accordingly 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.619
 24 and here on 18 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.600
 maybe now comes up with the idea 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:55.229
 6 maybe cut short otherwise 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:57.210
 times with 2 then we have the 12 and 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.280
 the new and then you come to the 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.240
 73 you could cut 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:05.670
 accordingly, then your four thirds 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:08.670
 important in this case as well and for the 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:12.450
 note that he is on the 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:14.940
 second digit after the comma 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.500
 or that here is a periodic 3 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.989
 that means she would be another three 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.700
 must come here rounded accordingly 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:25.010
 and that means paypal becomes easy 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:29.370
 cut off here and then give 1 133 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:33.989
 so at the task 5h it says +12 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:36.470
 5 6 2 by - 75 tenths evil plus 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:40.380
 through - again gives a minus 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:43.500
 and in this task come 77 45 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:49.430
 out now how do we get on it 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:53.459
 we have the 12 56 12 560 here 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:03:00.060
 multiply the 12 4 with sex and 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:03:05.069
 then add the 55 12 x 66 x 10 here 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:09.060
 and 60 62 72 72 plus the five are 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:12.450
 according to 77 sixth I write 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:15.120
 now here down there then we have 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:20.639
 all signs shared and here we have 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:26.489
 according to seven times the 10 plus here 

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:29.430
 the 75 are 75 and accordingly here 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:31.350
 tenth and we know when we two 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.970
 then we can divide fractions 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:42.139
 just multiply by the horse 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:42.139
 So then there is 77 sixth time 10 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:49.950
 75 and now we know we can be short 

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:53.670
 maybe first time with 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:59.450
 the 5 then we have a two and one here 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:04:02.519
 here with 5 are shortened accordingly 15 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:05.730
 the next thing we can do 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:08.190
 can do it again with two short ones this time 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:10.680
 Here we have here after 1 and here 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:13.290
 over there corresponding 3 and if we now 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:16.859
 77 x 1 revenge come here accordingly 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:19.600
 on 77 and with the three times 15 we come 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:22.690
 here on the 45th 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:25.870
 so at the next task 7g we have 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:29.140
 By the way, it is the same with 12 fifths 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:31.030
 - somewhere in the book or directly 

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:34.030
 here in front of it you can see it before 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:36.390
 break write divided by +8 that 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:39.100
 means - by plus yields 

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:41.860
 accordingly again - and get 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:44.110
 here on the result - three tenths 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.100
 how to figure it out i write it 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:49.920
 Here again something more detailed 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:53.380
 down to minus twelve fifths here 

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:57.700
 and we know the eight we can as 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:05:00.550
 break write as eight individual 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:02.350
 and if we share now that means 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:06.180
 multiplied by the ph value 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:09.730
 So I am writing here - 12 fifth 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:12.100
 times the cut so 1 8 

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:15.880
 and again we can cut back 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:19.150
 with two or four, I take 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:22.930
 this time here the four then the 82nd 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:25.240
 into it and into the 12 three times and 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:28.200
 we come with it three times 1 accordingly 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:31.920
 up here on our three and 5 x 2 

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:34.600
 down here on our 10 

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:36.130
 So that was the tasks I want 

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.750
 you should now want to discuss 

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:39.610
 still be if it please you ask 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:42.750
 the online support otherwise much 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:42.750
 success in the other tasks
