overpowered guns but I think when you're
in<00:02:37.250> aslam<00:02:37.610> the<00:02:37.910> the<00:02:38.360> biggest<00:02:38.660> thing<00:02:38.810> to<00:02:38.840> get

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
in aslam the the biggest thing to get

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:40.450 
in aslam the the biggest thing to get
out<00:02:39.140> of<00:02:39.170> it<00:02:39.380> is<00:02:39.560> just<00:02:39.770> to<00:02:39.920> step<00:02:40.100> away<00:02:40.220> from<00:02:40.310> the

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:40.460 
out of it is just to step away from the

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:41.800 
out of it is just to step away from the
game<00:02:40.670> for<00:02:40.880> a<00:02:40.910> little<00:02:41.000> bit<00:02:41.180> like<00:02:41.390> even<00:02:41.600> if<00:02:41.690> it's

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.070 
people go in the slump they change their
sensitivity<00:02:56.090> up<00:02:56.210> and<00:02:56.420> it<00:02:56.540> helps<00:02:56.930> them

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
sensitivity up and it helps them

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.780 
sensitivity up and it helps them
sometimes<00:02:57.890> people<00:02:58.070> just<00:02:58.250> change<00:02:58.670> the

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
sometimes people just change the

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:00.400 
sometimes people just change the
sensitivity<00:02:59.000> because<00:02:59.510> they<00:02:59.930> feel<00:03:00.140> like<00:03:00.170> they

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
sensitivity because they feel like they

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:01.780 
sensitivity because they feel like they
need<00:03:00.560> to<00:03:00.710> change<00:03:00.740> their<00:03:00.980> sensitivity<00:03:01.610> you

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
need to change their sensitivity you

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.130 
need to change their sensitivity you
know<00:03:01.880> nothing's<00:03:02.270> wrong<00:03:02.420> with<00:03:02.540> the<00:03:02.660> shot<00:03:02.900> and

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
know nothing's wrong with the shot and

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:04.900 
know nothing's wrong with the shot and
they<00:03:03.710> go<00:03:03.860> and<00:03:03.980> change<00:03:04.190> it<00:03:04.370> because<00:03:04.490> you<00:03:04.820> know

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
they go and change it because you know

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:06.640 
they go and change it because you know
maybe<00:03:05.120> someone<00:03:05.420> told<00:03:05.570> them<00:03:05.690> i<00:03:06.080> plan<00:03:06.320> on<00:03:06.350> three

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
maybe someone told them i plan on three

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.650 
maybe someone told them i plan on three
it's<00:03:06.800> so<00:03:06.920> much<00:03:07.070> better<00:03:07.220> i'm<00:03:07.490> playing<00:03:07.700> for<00:03:07.820> our

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
it's so much better i'm playing for our

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.030 
it's so much better i'm playing for our
you're<00:03:09.080> supposed<00:03:09.260> to<00:03:09.350> plant<00:03:09.560> 10<00:03:09.740> then<00:03:09.950> they

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
you're supposed to plant 10 then they

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.190 
you're supposed to plant 10 then they
change<00:03:10.340> it<00:03:10.490> and<00:03:10.640> then<00:03:10.880> that<00:03:11.750> can<00:03:11.840> affect<00:03:12.140> the

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
change it and then that can affect the

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.240 
change it and then that can affect the
game<00:03:12.440> it<00:03:12.590> might<00:03:12.680> take<00:03:12.860> them<00:03:12.950> a<00:03:13.010> little<00:03:13.160> while

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
game it might take them a little while

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.520 
game it might take them a little while
they<00:03:13.460> used<00:03:13.670> to<00:03:13.790> it<00:03:13.910> also<00:03:14.090> if<00:03:15.020> you<00:03:15.140> bought<00:03:15.320> a<00:03:15.350> new

they used to it also if you bought a new

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:16.840 
they used to it also if you bought a new
controller<00:03:15.980> sometimes<00:03:16.490> you<00:03:16.550> got<00:03:16.670> to<00:03:16.730> break

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
controller sometimes you got to break

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:18.820 
controller sometimes you got to break
those<00:03:17.060> in<00:03:17.300> and<00:03:17.510> that<00:03:17.990> can<00:03:18.140> cause<00:03:18.290> you<00:03:18.500> to<00:03:18.560> play

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:18.830 
those in and that can cause you to play

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:20.800 
those in and that can cause you to play
a<00:03:18.860> little<00:03:19.040> bit<00:03:19.250> worse<00:03:19.400> if<00:03:20.330> you<00:03:20.510> try<00:03:20.750> out

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
a little bit worse if you try out

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:22.480 
a little bit worse if you try out
something<00:03:21.080> like<00:03:21.260> a<00:03:21.290> control<00:03:21.830> freak<00:03:22.010> you<00:03:22.400> know

you<00:03:37.010> being<00:03:37.220> in<00:03:37.310> a<00:03:37.400> slump<00:03:37.640> is<00:03:37.760> all<00:03:37.850> about

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
you being in a slump is all about

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:39.430 
you being in a slump is all about
confidence<00:03:38.270> like<00:03:38.810> if<00:03:38.960> you<00:03:39.110> were<00:03:39.200> a<00:03:39.230> good

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 
confidence like if you were a good

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:40.780 
confidence like if you were a good
player<00:03:39.680> to<00:03:39.770> begin<00:03:40.010> with<00:03:40.190> and<00:03:40.400> then<00:03:40.430> you<00:03:40.580> find

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
player to begin with and then you find

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:42.430 
player to begin with and then you find
yourself<00:03:40.850> to<00:03:41.180> struggling<00:03:41.570> people<00:03:42.230> are<00:03:42.320> going

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440 
yourself to struggling people are going

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:43.840 
yourself to struggling people are going
to<00:03:42.530> get<00:03:42.620> better<00:03:42.770> and<00:03:43.070> the<00:03:43.340> teams<00:03:43.580> that<00:03:43.700> you

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:43.850 
to get better and the teams that you

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:45.310 
to get better and the teams that you
playing<00:03:44.090> could<00:03:44.300> like<00:03:44.660> they<00:03:44.900> could<00:03:45.080> be<00:03:45.200> getting

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:45.320 
playing could like they could be getting

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.230 
playing could like they could be getting
better<00:03:45.530> as<00:03:45.740> well<00:03:45.950> and<00:03:46.220> maybe<00:03:46.580> you're<00:03:46.850> at<00:03:47.090> the

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:47.240 
better as well and maybe you're at the

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.210 
better as well and maybe you're at the
learning<00:03:47.510> curve<00:03:47.660> just<00:03:47.810> not<00:03:48.020> going<00:03:48.410> up<00:03:48.650> as<00:03:48.770> like

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
learning curve just not going up as like

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.130 
learning curve just not going up as like
as<00:03:49.340> fast<00:03:49.580> as<00:03:49.730> these<00:03:49.880> other<00:03:50.030> teams<00:03:50.240> are<00:03:50.480> but<00:03:51.110> a

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.140 
as fast as these other teams are but a

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:53.260 
as fast as these other teams are but a
lot<00:03:51.320> of<00:03:51.350> it<00:03:51.530> has<00:03:51.650> to<00:03:51.680> do<00:03:51.860> with<00:03:51.980> strats<00:03:52.310> to<00:03:52.580> you

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:53.270 
lot of it has to do with strats to you

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:56.290 
lot of it has to do with strats to you
can<00:03:53.510> /<00:03:54.140> like<00:03:54.380> you<00:03:54.560> can<00:03:54.880> overextend<00:03:55.880> yourself

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:56.300 
can / like you can overextend yourself

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.270 
can / like you can overextend yourself
so<00:03:56.780> like<00:03:56.900> you're<00:03:57.080> doing<00:03:57.350> too<00:03:57.590> much<00:03:57.800> to<00:03:58.100> make

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
so like you're doing too much to make

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.040 
so like you're doing too much to make
your<00:03:58.460> team<00:03:58.700> win<00:03:58.880> a<00:03:58.910> game<00:03:59.150> I<00:03:59.450> don't<00:03:59.870> know<00:03:59.930> how
