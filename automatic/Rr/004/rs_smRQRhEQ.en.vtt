this video we wanted to give you an idea

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.800 
this video we wanted to give you an idea
of<00:00:38.340> what<00:00:38.670> it<00:00:38.760> would<00:00:38.880> be<00:00:38.940> like<00:00:39.060> to<00:00:39.240> engage<00:00:39.570> the

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:39.810 
of what it would be like to engage the

of what it would be like to engage the
enemy<00:00:40.080> in<00:00:40.470> starship<00:00:40.770> combat

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:01:04.290 

you

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:04.300 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.690 

the<00:01:04.780> most<00:01:04.990> basic<00:01:05.620> strategy<00:01:06.130> and<00:01:06.280> starship

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:06.700 
the most basic strategy and starship

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.940 
the most basic strategy and starship
combat<00:01:07.120> is<00:01:07.270> to<00:01:07.420> maneuver<00:01:07.750> your<00:01:07.870> ship<00:01:08.260> use<00:01:08.770> your

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:08.950 
combat is to maneuver your ship use your

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.610 
combat is to maneuver your ship use your
energy<00:01:09.130> weapons<00:01:09.910> to<00:01:10.060> bear<00:01:10.300> on<00:01:10.510> one<00:01:10.900> section<00:01:11.350> of

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:11.620 
energy weapons to bear on one section of

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.710 
energy weapons to bear on one section of
your<00:01:11.740> enemy<00:01:12.160> shields<00:01:12.490> not<00:01:13.120> those<00:01:13.420> shields

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:13.720 
your enemy shields not those shields

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.870 
your enemy shields not those shields
down<00:01:14.080> and<00:01:14.380> then<00:01:14.470> use<00:01:14.620> your<00:01:14.650> photon<00:01:15.250> torpedoes

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:15.880 
down and then use your photon torpedoes

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:23.280 
down and then use your photon torpedoes
on<00:01:16.090> the<00:01:16.480> exposed<00:01:16.780> hall

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.290 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.470 

so<00:01:23.830> there's<00:01:24.010> three<00:01:24.220> basic<00:01:24.610> types<00:01:24.880> of<00:01:25.300> ships

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:25.480 
so there's three basic types of ships

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.020 
so there's three basic types of ships
that<00:01:25.660> you<00:01:25.780> can<00:01:25.930> get<00:01:26.080> an<00:01:26.200> sto<00:01:26.560> the<00:01:27.280> first<00:01:27.550> one<00:01:27.820> is

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
that you can get an sto the first one is

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.990 
that you can get an sto the first one is
a<00:01:28.210> cruiser<00:01:29.040> cruisers<00:01:30.040> are<00:01:30.190> really<00:01:30.550> tough<00:01:30.760> they

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
a cruiser cruisers are really tough they

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.520 
a cruiser cruisers are really tough they
take<00:01:31.150> a<00:01:31.180> lot<00:01:31.420> of<00:01:31.480> damage<00:01:31.870> to<00:01:32.050> take<00:01:32.350> them<00:01:32.500> down

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
take a lot of damage to take them down

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.110 
take a lot of damage to take them down
they<00:01:32.890> have<00:01:32.920> a<00:01:33.010> lot<00:01:33.220> of<00:01:33.250> crew<00:01:33.610> so<00:01:33.820> they're<00:01:33.940> hard

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:34.120 
they have a lot of crew so they're hard

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.210 
they have a lot of crew so they're hard
to<00:01:34.150> disable<00:01:34.720> this<00:01:35.230> is<00:01:35.440> really<00:01:35.710> good<00:01:36.040> for

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
to disable this is really good for

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:41.310 
to disable this is really good for
tanking<00:01:38.100> second<00:01:39.100> time<00:01:39.310> is<00:01:39.610> an<00:01:40.240> escort<00:01:40.630> escorts

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 
tanking second time is an escort escorts

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:42.780 
tanking second time is an escort escorts
are<00:01:41.440> really<00:01:41.740> fast<00:01:42.010> they're<00:01:42.640> pretty

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:42.790 
are really fast they're pretty

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:44.880 
are really fast they're pretty
maneuverable<00:01:43.540> they<00:01:43.960> can<00:01:44.110> dish<00:01:44.260> out<00:01:44.350> a<00:01:44.440> lot<00:01:44.740> of

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
maneuverable they can dish out a lot of

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:46.680 
maneuverable they can dish out a lot of
damage<00:01:45.130> at<00:01:45.400> one<00:01:45.580> time<00:01:45.880> but<00:01:46.390> they're<00:01:46.540> pretty

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:46.690 
damage at one time but they're pretty

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:48.240 
damage at one time but they're pretty
weak<00:01:46.960> so<00:01:47.260> they're<00:01:47.410> a<00:01:47.440> lot<00:01:47.560> better<00:01:47.740> for<00:01:48.040> dealing

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
weak so they're a lot better for dealing

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.480 
weak so they're a lot better for dealing
DPS<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:50.140> third<00:01:50.350> type<00:01:50.620> is<00:01:50.830> a<00:01:50.920> science<00:01:51.310> ship

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
DPS the third type is a science ship

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.310 
DPS the third type is a science ship
science<00:01:52.030> ships<00:01:52.210> are<00:01:52.360> really<00:01:52.810> good<00:01:53.020> at

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 
science ships are really good at

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.990 
science ships are really good at
increasing<00:01:53.890> the<00:01:53.979> abilities<00:01:54.460> of<00:01:54.490> you<00:01:54.729> and<00:01:54.910> your

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
increasing the abilities of you and your

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.120 
increasing the abilities of you and your
teammates<00:01:55.360> or<00:01:55.840> decreasing<00:01:56.590> the<00:01:56.710> abilities<00:01:57.100> of

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
teammates or decreasing the abilities of

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:58.890 
teammates or decreasing the abilities of
the<00:01:57.250> enemy<00:01:57.610> they<00:01:58.000> do<00:01:58.119> crazy<00:01:58.360> stuff<00:01:58.780> like

00:01:58.890 --> 00:01:58.900 
the enemy they do crazy stuff like

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.570 
the enemy they do crazy stuff like
bouncing<00:01:59.350> things<00:01:59.500> off<00:01:59.710> a<00:01:59.740> deflector<00:02:00.250> dishes

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
bouncing things off a deflector dishes

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.180 
bouncing things off a deflector dishes
or<00:02:00.729> scrambling<00:02:01.270> enemy<00:02:01.570> sensors<00:02:02.020> it's<00:02:02.710> really

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:03.190 
or scrambling enemy sensors it's really

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.080 
or scrambling enemy sensors it's really
good<00:02:03.310> at<00:02:03.400> doing<00:02:03.580> support

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.419 

so<00:02:07.689> one<00:02:07.899> of<00:02:07.929> the<00:02:08.080> additional<00:02:08.649> ways<00:02:08.860> you<00:02:09.250> can

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
so one of the additional ways you can

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:11.580 
so one of the additional ways you can
customize<00:02:09.910> your<00:02:10.090> ship<00:02:10.390> instead<00:02:11.260> of<00:02:11.290> just

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
customize your ship instead of just

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.740 
customize your ship instead of just
customizing<00:02:12.459> your<00:02:12.489> crew<00:02:12.940> you<00:02:13.360> can<00:02:13.510> also

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
customizing your crew you can also

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.540 
customizing your crew you can also
customize<00:02:14.080> the<00:02:14.410> components<00:02:15.190> that<00:02:15.280> are<00:02:15.340> on

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
customize the components that are on

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.180 
customize the components that are on
your<00:02:15.760> ship<00:02:16.030> so<00:02:16.629> for<00:02:16.810> example<00:02:16.900> you<00:02:17.709> and<00:02:17.890> I<00:02:17.920> may

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
your ship so for example you and I may

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.369 
your ship so for example you and I may
both<00:02:18.430> have<00:02:18.640> the<00:02:18.790> same<00:02:18.819> class<00:02:19.360> of<00:02:19.390> ship<00:02:19.810> but<00:02:20.260> the

00:02:20.369 --> 00:02:20.379 
both have the same class of ship but the

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:22.140 
both have the same class of ship but the
items<00:02:20.800> that<00:02:20.890> I'm<00:02:21.069> going<00:02:21.280> to<00:02:21.340> put<00:02:21.550> on<00:02:21.670> my<00:02:21.700> ship

put<00:02:27.160> on<00:02:27.250> my<00:02:27.400> ship<00:02:27.670> might<00:02:27.879> impact<00:02:28.209> my<00:02:28.480> phasers

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019 
put on my ship might impact my phasers

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:31.080 
put on my ship might impact my phasers
or<00:02:29.140> Michael<00:02:29.470> pto's<00:02:29.769> there<00:02:30.400> might<00:02:30.610> even<00:02:30.640> be<00:02:30.970> a

or Michael pto's there might even be a
difference<00:02:31.480> in<00:02:31.660> our<00:02:31.780> deflector<00:02:32.260> dish<00:02:32.290> so<00:02:32.709> some

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
difference in our deflector dish so some

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.650 
difference in our deflector dish so some
