 of Valencia and we will explain a 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:35.110
 little bit how should be let's say the 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.239
 nutrition prior to a career of a 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.220
 duration of 45 minutes two hours 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:41.230
 understood after we can talk from

 etcetera forward the fruits are a 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.140
 fundamental part the diet of the 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.580
 athlete for main reasons has 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.409
 a high water content helps us to 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:55.059
 rehydrate us to get a series of 

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:56.260
 vitamins and minerals are going to have a 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:59.110
 high fiber content 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.420
 the vegetables like the fruits that 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.590
 we have commented are rich in vitamins 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.900
 They are rich in minerals 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:08.780
 which is important the vegetable subject is 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.340
 important the variety in color is 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.760
 find different types of 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:16.040
 nutrients take the vegetables in 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.970
 raw to some rationality because it 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.900
 there is if it is the way it is 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.940
 they keep mostly vitamins 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.280
 minerals the red meats what they have 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.470
 when seeing with the peculiar color is because 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.510
 they have myoglobin a protein is the one 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.010
 contains a lot of iron that 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.570
 is going to be important for nutrition 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.800
 of the athlete we have to choose a 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.200
 that has a low fat content 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.450
 Filetito determines a between the meats 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.160
 white are protein- rich meats 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.810
 has high quality has a low 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.430
 fat content the fish is another 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.259
 essential food that we have to 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.420
 have in our diet fixed fatty 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:46.130
 the fish with the most fat content that 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.530
 yes with a high fat content 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.790
 polyunsaturated very rich in omega 3 that 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.470
 they are very interesting when it comes to 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.990
 diet the sportsman we will select 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.690
 the fresh cheeses are the least arms 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.670
 but they continue to contribute is not a quantity 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.590
 important from vitamin to vitamin d and 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.899
 especially calcium we just bought 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.160
 a pair of bread loaves the bread is one of 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:05.840
 the food that is not in the base of 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.310
 the food pyramid high content 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.560
 in carbohydrates energy source 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.009
 for the athlete in the test in the 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.900
 competed 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.400
 we already have the ingredients to go 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.230
 now cook 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.030
 pre competition diet in which 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.799
 we seek is to fill the deposit 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.349
 gasoline, we're going to try to get to 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:24.900
 day of the competition the day with a 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:27.090
 level of butt deposits we are going to 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.129
 raise the diet in seven days a 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:32.129
 first phase in which we will reduce 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:33.239
 slightly the main caffeine to the 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:35.040
 time of the competition that are the 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:37.769
 carbohydrates decreasing during 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.959
 the first three days bread we have rice 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:41.549
 we have potatoes we have pasta we have 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:43.530
 cereals do not remove the buts and 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:46.680
 reduce them by a percentage on a 30 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.840
 40 50 percent maximum intake of 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.690
 the diet at a first breakfast I would 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:54.659
 would focus mainly on dairy 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:57.269
 I would focus on cheese as a unit 

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:58.680
 protein together with a small portion of 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:00.750
 carbohydrates to this little 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.159
 Toast with fresh cheese we can 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.439
 put a little bit of turkey breast for 

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:06.359
 lunch a small portion too 

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:08.819
 of carbon thanks in bread mode and 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:10.889
 along with some other protein type or 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:12.629
 non-fatty cold cuts in terms of meals and 

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:15.629
 dinners let's focus mainly 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:17.879
 in food as it shares principal that 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:20.489
 be vegetables these vegetables like 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:20.910
 we have here we can cook them from very 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:23.550
 diverse 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:26.430
 ways for the meals I would focus 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:28.230
 mainly the food coming 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.940
 of the meat take at least one or two 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.160
 portions of red meat during the 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.380
 week and the rest of white meat one or 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.910
 two portions of blue fish and another of 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.890
 white fish in the three days 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.000
 next we focus now yes on the 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:41.070
 carbohydrates now has to 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.480
 move to a 60 70 even 80 percent 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.920
 of diet this is going to mean that 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.870
 let's have breakfast eat lunch 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.400
 to snack and dine on carbohydrate rations 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.990
 carbon vale we have already done the days 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.940
 previous three days of download three days 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:52.530
 of cargo and we are facing the day 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.380
 before the test that we are going to do 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:58.140
 let's make a dinner rich in hydrates 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:00.000
 of carbon a ration of pasta a 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:01.650
 little bit of fresh cheese and a couple of 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.990
 turkey breast slices all this 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.220
 We can put it in one dish with 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:06.780
 a little bit of oregano a little bit 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.390
 olive oil let's go with it 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.800
 a small portion of vegetables not very 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:13.530
 elevated because the amount of fiber 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.120
 can be detrimental to the previous day 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:18.299
 to the race we can accompany him also 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:21.600
 with some making a potato 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:23.250
 of a rich dinner as a dessert instead of 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.600
 fruit let's focus on dairy and 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.250
 we are going to put the viewer that yes 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.350
 three hours before the 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.870
 of the competition because we need a 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:32.370
 period to have a good digestion 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.530
 important sir what usually 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.240
 we are using nothing to do 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:37.980
 experiments on the same day the 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.020
 race a dairy ration either in 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:43.110
 form of milk or yogurt a serving of 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:46.380
 cereals accompanied by a toast of 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:48.390
 bread together with fresh cheese payment both the 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:51.900
 bread like cereals is recommended 

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:54.480
 that are integral because they have 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:56.070
 let's say a lower glycemic index in the 

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.870
 source of energy will provide us 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:58.680
 for a longer long term as we add 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:00.000
 the fruit piece 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.350
 the piece fruit not to provide hydrates 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.930
 I hope that with these guidelines 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:06.240
 that I have given you, you can use them 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:08.370
 carry them out and get a 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.680
 optimal performance in your next 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:11.880
 however, I recommend you 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.860
 that you go to a nutritionist nutritionist 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:15.000
 give you the guidelines you need 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:18.440
 personally a personalized diet 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.440
 Good until next time 

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:48.919
 since we use it, we say goodbye 

00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:48.919
 next week goodbye
