 on<00:00:42.870> summers<00:00:43.350> and<00:00:43.500> it's<00:00:43.620> kinda<00:00:43.890> weird<00:00:43.980> but

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
 on summers and it's kinda weird but

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.310 
 on summers and it's kinda weird but
and<00:00:44.760> then<00:00:44.940> this<00:00:45.059> was<00:00:45.239> a<00:00:45.270> general<00:00:45.930> grievous

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
and then this was a general grievous

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:54.529

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
figure and yeah so his so i guess i

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.229 
figure and yeah so his so i guess i
could<00:00:54.660> do<00:00:55.140> articulation<00:00:55.920> anyway<00:00:56.190> I<00:00:56.219> just<00:00:56.489> well

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.840 
could do articulation anyway I just well
I<00:00:57.270> pretty<00:00:57.960> much<00:00:58.050> cut<00:00:58.500> one<00:00:58.859> side<00:00:59.129> and<00:00:59.520> then<00:00:59.579> cut

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
I pretty much cut one side and then cut

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.130 
I pretty much cut one side and then cut
the<00:00:59.969> other<00:01:00.090> side<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:00.539> then<00:01:00.660> molded<00:01:00.930> it

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
the other side and then molded it

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.780 
the other side and then molded it
together<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:01.710> i<00:01:01.770> molded<00:01:02.100> these<00:01:02.250> horns<00:01:02.550> on<00:01:03.140> and

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
together and i molded these horns on and
