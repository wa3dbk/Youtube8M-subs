 we are like it or not

 we invented for a long time she loved that we humans over 

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:12.480
 our big and very sensible and rational decision makes 

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:16.999
 But what we see that sometimes looks a bit closer 

00:00:16.999 --> 00:00:18.829
 Search action as 7 

00:00:18.829 --> 00:00:22.199
 nothing at all with the market but sometimes things make it obvious 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.259
 Different ways of doing business are different 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:26.300
 they have immediately 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.400
 an underlying pattern decodes what he knows 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.000
 he is and the bourgeoisie has to fourth before what is the meaning Berlin there 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:36.570
 "The goal was that 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:37.870
 not up 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.260
 to place on the find in the finds before coming to the office 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.470
 you can now imagine for yourself a picture of it 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:46.570
 which signal 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.970
 this customer on and is there perhaps synonymous conclusion on the force 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:50.950
 actually here 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.330
 Performance Dr 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.070
 Who determines as an experience that I had the guests 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.960
 Played what he said on God's Mies 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.170
 that also knew why that was 8 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.140
 Clear that maybe something to do with the personality of the customer 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.180
 would have 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.710
 OM then we have our lives but already finds the hard way because 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.170
 here the animal is stumbled in trusting stone 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.780
 there we have to be careful that we put an end to this code and 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.510
 suddenly fall 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:24.500
 uncomfortable customers and then decided to just realize it 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:25.730
 OK 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:28.170
 now it's work 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.630
 we have to be aware of the area 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.409
 How do I manage that is not as good as possible to adjust to this clientele 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.860
 without forbidding myself 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.860
 That is something that is exactly the experience as it is in practice outside 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.170
 why is that some customers have the presence at the node in 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.170
 In this case asks super but that's fun 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.710
 the others are there too 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.570
 the farmer's wife Emmerlich and see something real and are so humid 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.350
 only which ones 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.140
 that says once of the special color it looks like is clearer I think 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.409
 that also easily over the lips and the insight infects a short 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.950
 especially but only once again illustrate 40 

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:12.889
 what we just saw on the boards 

00:02:12.889 --> 00:02:14.839
 practically out 

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:19.079
 bad the fact that today pursue fifth off again «Barça chases

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:29.519
 People can easily be cool that body contact

 red / dpa shaking hands 

00:02:34.029 --> 00:02:36.959
 but sometimes sellers especially such customers i have even though the 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.959
 Countries are and then probably no longer arrived 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:43.179
 They do not really want to 

00:02:43.179 --> 00:02:46.409
 that's not what makes customers feel better 

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:48.539
 for the topic with knowledge of human nature 

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:50.049
 achieved more 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:53.049
 Rottweil professionals professionals on 7 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:56.430
 What specialists experience when they are again that they often deal with people 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.769
 Make mistakes that would never allow in their field of expertise 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:03.099
 as a result, mistakes are made as a result of doing business that does not have to be 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:07.680
 I also do not want to trust the Bethe I'm not sure how my customer is ticking 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.989
 How can I translate the benefit of the stupid into a value system he can 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:11.779
 understood 

00:03:11.779 --> 00:03:14.139
 whatever he buys me 

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:18.159
 The theme is crucial to everyone whose success depends on others 

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:20.039
 Convincing people 

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:23.259
 be it as a seller no matter in which industry 

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:27.369
 especially natural in areas where organic products do not touch performance 

00:03:27.369 --> 00:03:30.879
 can Haiti area financial service or even in the 

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:34.689
 Crafting and a lot of trust is necessary when placing an order 

00:03:34.689 --> 00:03:35.679
 becomes 

00:03:35.679 --> 00:03:39.349
 but of course also in areas such as guided tours 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:42.779
 how do I use the potentials and competencies that are available to teams 

00:03:42.779 --> 00:03:43.589

 because she has the fun of asking her if she enjoys music all over the day 

00:03:47.119 --> 00:03:49.389
 get and almost learn it 

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:53.449
 yes blame is a rhetorical question but many other things try 

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:56.339
 can exchange with each other and the fun may 

00:03:56.339 --> 00:04:00.289
 First of all very important in the training not to preach a method 

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:03.739
 in the sense of him doing that and it works because that would be a lie 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:07.469
 It is important to me to show in such cohesion almost to show 

00:04:07.469 --> 00:04:11.529
 5 4 do yourself to be successful the problem a bit also directly 

00:04:11.529 --> 00:04:12.349

 he is incredibly well-organized and runs great 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:21.799
