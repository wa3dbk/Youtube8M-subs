00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:10.420
 operating room 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:25.960
 It should be an excellent advertisement for winter sports 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.960
 it's nice when the Bayern Munich players were just under 150 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.489
 Interested in the cafÃ© all of the coming Peter Hauk Schwaben and 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:36.000
 Lichtspiel welcomed Roman leaves the players 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.320
 Above all, Bernd Jahn for the 13-time European champion 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.810
 he was supposed to send his class against local hero Stefan 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:46.510
 as well as prove against the luck of Mannheim already specialists Ralf Deckert 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.360
 as discipline only the new ball selected the probably fastest kind 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:55.100
 Billiards play the climber of the year 93 and German champions of 91 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.110
 the Franz Antel led against the 19-time German champion Janka one 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.920
 excellent game after a 5 to 2 lead got sand running and there it stood 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.920
 even balance and take the lead 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.850
 3d 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.570
 played relatively well at a fairly high level 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:29.020
 and protz very close match to whether the decisive Schanz at 7 6 awarded 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.390
 but on with petticoat percent made up 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.320
 for the mistake I was punished with the defeat 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.730
 so Janka finally won 9 to 7 and then had against the experienced 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.300
 Squad compete 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.700
 but the current number 4 of the European ranking was on this 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.140
 Evening clearly too strong for Janka in the team already at the beginning in the lead 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.540
 The current European Culture could indeed come up again 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.780
 but in the end Eckert defeated the 27-year-old with 9 to 7 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.590
 I was very nice here 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.730
 it was about the water and a lot of effort it was a nice 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:10.620
 Event also with the fog with the music always between the breaks 

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:11.659
 and the games 

00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:15.169
 was very nice and the people were thrilled even though Bayern the champions 

00:02:15.169 --> 00:02:18.730
 League has played and percent of Bayer a very positive summary 

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:23.989
 At the end of the audience were still affirmed in the affirmative as Eckert 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:27.570
 One of Germany's best German players is reaching deep into his box 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.570
 and shows a captivating reporter at Art Bumps 

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:50.509
 Of course we hope that we can correct the event by ad-hoc 

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:54.579
 highest level highest technical and tactical level is played 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:58.040
 the public can show what we want but athletic 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.510
 play
