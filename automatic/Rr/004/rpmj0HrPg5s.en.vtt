00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:01.619
 it was normal 

00:00:01.619 --> 00:00:05.050
 so now who goes for our second injury 

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:08.459
 and to the question that we do what was due 

00:00:08.459 --> 00:00:11.569
 and to explain what the bible people begin with the explanation of government 

00:00:11.569 --> 00:00:14.129
 with the explanation of the word 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:15.709
 the word Libya 

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:17.880
 is a word of Greek origin 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.310
 what does his heart mean in Portuguese? 

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:25.609
 the italian danilo di luca 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:29.400
 a collection of books because it is not a book of sun 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.429
 instead 

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:33.890
 of what many people can imagine 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.890
 the bible stood and 73 wounded 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.530
 are 46 from the Old Testament 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.920
 and 27 of the New Testament 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.960
 the old testament like this 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.070
 therefore 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.770
 determined number of dead 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:52.980
 the new testament in turn 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.290
 How is that? 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.050
 with the gospel of Saint Matthew 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:58.350
 and ends 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.850
 with the apocalypse of Saint John 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.510
 leaders insofar as they are not in the order in which they were written 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.160
 but this work of being another order 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.390
 but we will also be able to find out 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:12.930
 because 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.960
 He came back from the trip. 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.760
 the author of the pec 300 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.580
 this is a statement to discuss 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.120
 be taken to the Catholic 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.120
 we are obligated 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.150
 god is the true author of life 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:29.570
 now 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.159
 god did not write to these books in person. 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.230
 he uses men and women 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:39.000
 over a thousand and three hundred years 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.680
 from the time of Moses to the temple of pop rock and punctual with the title are 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:44.790
 John 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.299
 to write the book describes all the books that make up the sacred scripture 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.970
 what is the content of the bible the question that agents 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.300
 content of mp the history of salvation 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:59.970
 in fact to carry them out 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.020
 a life story of the people of israel 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.040
 after 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.040
 this month the whole salvation story of mankind 

00:02:08.909 --> 00:02:11.909
 and one last question what he can do 

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:15.099
 why is the catholic bible different from freedom? 

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:20.729
 this difference is due to the fact that 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:23.619
 was the first one formed 

00:02:23.619 --> 00:02:27.629
 when it was announced that he would go to German he will have his tongue 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:28.819
 he used 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:30.479
 the jewish bible 

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:33.819
 which was composed only with the Old Testament 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:36.609
 in fact they never accepted a new 

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:39.649
 so instead of 46 books in the Old Testament 

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:43.759
 the Jewish bible has only 39 

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:45.599
 because they do not accept 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:48.639
 some books totaling seven 

00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:50.849
 which were prescribed in Bethlehem 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:53.849
 some even off the land in Palestine 

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:58.549
 This happened around the next year after Christ 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:01.269
 we seemed to take these books away 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:03.979
 called a canonical pipoqueiro 

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:07.629
 which is tobias bauru what ecclesiastical wisdom 

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:11.809
 first and second for hair and judith 

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:13.679
 they took 

00:03:13.679 --> 00:03:16.679
 of the Hebrew Bible that had been written time 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:18.919
 criciÃºma 

00:03:18.919 --> 00:03:21.269
 a first approximation 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:24.089
 and now come to her, she also treated poliana 

00:03:24.089 --> 00:03:25.959
 sacred scripture 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:29.309
 to take a tour of the Bible and know a little more 

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:31.669
 an interesting tip he also 

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:33.289
 the intrusion 

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:36.709
 the big year and there you will find lots of information on the agenda 

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:38.019
 a big hug
