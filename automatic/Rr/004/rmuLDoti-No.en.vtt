over budget the meals were delicious

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.440 
over budget the meals were delicious
meals<00:00:11.370> Bert<00:00:11.700> but<00:00:12.000> they<00:00:12.120> weren't<00:00:12.269> the

healthiest<00:00:12.929> of<00:00:13.019> meals<00:00:13.259> and<00:00:13.530> so<00:00:13.740> I<00:00:13.920> felt<00:00:14.280> the
