00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 hello friends welcome back today 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.120
 again at the new trading tutorial and 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.700
 yes comes the team of the season and 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.690
 I would recommend with consumption 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.019
 objects to act 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.059
 I've got that a bit already 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:17.779
 focus the last few days and have me 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.410
 check out these fitness cards 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:21.990
 I say specialized 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.840
 These are the golden 30s 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.859
 fitness cards because I have the one for this 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.789
 1600 purchase as you can see 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:31.080
 how do we get to 1600 I show you 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:35.450
 I just looked like that 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:38.760
 currently lying like that and that's what you do 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.980
 Of course I fix the value first 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.309
 from the cards 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:46.739
 let's see which are currently traded 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:54.989
 the jenaer partly over 2000 gone 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:56.610
 So look for 2010 within 59 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.489
 minutes seemingly gone if it were completely 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.610
 want to have fast you need 1600 1009 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.550
 do 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:07.250
 I already play in the endless me 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.660
 I'm the 2 minute moment I'm doing 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:13.730
 every value a little hears us 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:19.160
 learn it here forever now 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:21.229
 okay here at the first 28 minute this 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.950
 means when we see how to sell 1900 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:27.659
 definitely go away 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:29.670
 Let's see in 2009 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.549
 So the 2000 then we will go too 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.729
 but it is almost a whole lot 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:38.039
 hour to go to the hollow table 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:40.079
 and it's just always a bit 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:41.280
 depending on how the market is right now so 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:45.210
 these cards have been through that too 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:48.030
 cost 2500 or 2300 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.130
 and since they are currently at 1000 each 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.340
 If I go more, I have the whole mouse 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.200
 calculated and counted him stupid 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:59.180
 So the commission is about 100 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:02.520
 coins that is 1008 buy these 4800 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:04.800
 Then I forget about plus minus zero 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.140
 wants a little something so deserve 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.680
 I've set myself a goal 290 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.440
 to earn 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:16.230
 and that's why you do not get the maximum price 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:18.090
 offer 1600 of course already one 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.680
 it will probably be offered a bit 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.680
 a bit of racing in the market already 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:28.800
 but we are still there 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:33.750
 and now I'm just offering 1600 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:35.400
 here on all these colleagues and yes it 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.850
 I'll slip through a few 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:41.120
 lose a lot and most effectively 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:43.860
 is the naturally when happy hour is 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.970
 because there are many cards put in there 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.069
 maybe could be in too 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.600
 award grab better he is on 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:51.510
 In any case, look what they are doing there 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:54.420
 So if I can see you now 1600 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.940
 increase the complicated and for 1100 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.640
 I have secure anger points 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:04.950
 or I just wait a bit 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:06.269
 Do you know how the market is going now? 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.560
 will probably develop in the 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:11.750
 not really use next days 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.310
 I'm assuming that it 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:17.190
 maybe temporarily go over 2000 times 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.760
 but usually they could 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:22.380
 probably 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:25.950
 ok now and if this happy 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:28.560
 hour will definitely come from then 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:31.320
 just how crazy these cards buy 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.549
 and then later things put though 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:32.959
 Also, I'll show you some times 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:35.850
 here 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:38.780
 you only see ten pages here but you 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:41.900
 I 've finally won here 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:45.960
 and they're all here at 1600 could be 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:47.250
 I now set all for 21 profits 

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:50.640
 and of course I have quite a few 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:52.500
 lost can always be seen here 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.680
 again forbidden where you from times times 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.330
 Commanded 1700 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.130
 yes you can of course also for 2003 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.990
 make up for it 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:03.300
 sometimes I have to be seen too 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:06.240
 The auction for 2300 so crazy 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:07.350
 There's always something he just tries 

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:09.390
 could definitely do one 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:12.800
 very effective way of friends that 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:12.800
