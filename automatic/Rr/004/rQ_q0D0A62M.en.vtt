here<00:00:01.530> is<00:00:01.650> the<00:00:01.829> 60<00:00:02.340> watt<00:00:02.490> LED<00:00:02.970> moving<00:00:03.360> head<00:00:03.570> I

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780 
here is the 60 watt LED moving head I

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.690 
here is the 60 watt LED moving head I
was<00:00:04.020> asked<00:00:04.380> to<00:00:04.410> make<00:00:04.650> another<00:00:05.009> video<00:00:05.310> of<00:00:05.580> this

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
I could add it to this light stand right

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.830 
I could add it to this light stand right
here<00:01:19.170> this<00:01:19.560> is<00:01:19.619> a<00:01:19.799> light<00:01:20.610> stand<00:01:20.880> idea<00:01:21.330> i<00:01:21.420> got

the flashlight on so you can see a

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.649 
the flashlight on so you can see a
little<00:01:49.530> bit<00:01:49.740> better<00:01:50.000> here's<00:01:51.000> all<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.270> specs

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
little bit better here's all the specs

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:52.910 
little bit better here's all the specs
on<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:51.990> back<00:01:52.140> of<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.350> light<00:01:52.530> I<00:01:52.560> don't<00:01:52.770> know<00:01:52.860> if

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
on the back of the light I don't know if

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.710 
on the back of the light I don't know if
you<00:01:52.979> can<00:01:53.100> see<00:01:53.399> that<00:01:53.640> but<00:01:53.939> it<00:01:54.090> basically<00:01:54.210> says
