 hi here your favorite polish and 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.869
 welcome to a minute with claudia and in 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.460
 this video will teach you how to do 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:25.269
 easter eggs like this one 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.269
 Market Stall 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.960
 everyone needs three things foam 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.700
 polystyrene made in egg shape 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.400
 sequins of color that you 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.460
 prefer 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.930
 and the last thing is pine pins or nails 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.300
 followed as you want to call 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.890
 but they have to be 28 millimeters 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.510
 because if I'm younger it's after 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.430
 they can leave can also use a 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.830
 marker to make your design so 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:53.340
 let's start, I'll show you the option 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:56.300
 easier you can catch the orange and what 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.300
 I put in the middle 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.300
 recording the little thing 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:09.490
 and other things 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:13.110
 Now I'll show how they have to 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:17.140
 do the other can not put it like that 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.970
 because then you are going to see the white 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:22.799
 then they have to put it as a 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.799
 little bit above the other 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.310
 i 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.060
 I already have the first layer of color and now 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.630
 I will choose another color that in case of 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.630
 wake 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.310
 I recommend you make two lines in 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:58.320
 the same color is almost going to notice better 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.320
 now we go with another yellow 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.110
 I'm going to finish this game using only 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.770
 three colors but if you want 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:16.720
 be able to use more and continue like this until down 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.720
 and something like that will remain 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.910
 easy but you can design another 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.390
 thing now I 'm going to show you other shows 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.390
 what did I do 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.920
 ah 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:44.450
