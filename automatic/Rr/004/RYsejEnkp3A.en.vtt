00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:04.350 
into your tracking code but put it

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:06.920 
into your tracking code but put it
before<00:05:04.650> striking<00:05:05.190> point<00:05:05.760> you<00:05:06.450> see<00:05:06.690> what<00:05:06.810> I

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:06.930 
before striking point you see what I

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:14.900 
before striking point you see what I
mean<00:05:06.960> but<00:05:07.710> as<00:05:08.370> I<00:05:08.669> already<00:05:09.000> said<00:05:10.070> just<00:05:11.390> hpg<00:05:13.910> you

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:14.910 
mean but as I already said just hpg you

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:19.520 
mean but as I already said just hpg you
can<00:05:15.150> put<00:05:15.540> several<00:05:15.780> console<00:05:16.560> for<00:05:18.200> now<00:05:19.200> you<00:05:19.260> need

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:19.530 
can put several console for now you need

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:24.850 
can put several console for now you need
to<00:05:19.860> seek<00:05:20.580> the<00:05:20.760> true<00:05:21.169> so<00:05:22.169> the<00:05:22.620> cube<00:05:22.860> in<00:05:23.130> the<00:05:23.160> 3d

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:24.860 
to seek the true so the cube in the 3d

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:31.499 
to seek the true so the cube in the 3d
so<00:05:27.560> your<00:05:28.560> concrete<00:05:29.100> maybe<00:05:29.460> disappear

00:05:31.499 --> 00:05:31.509 
so your concrete maybe disappear

00:05:31.509 --> 00:05:37.719 
so your concrete maybe disappear
but<00:05:32.509> not<00:05:32.990> really<00:05:33.440> a<00:05:34.120> cheeky<00:05:35.120> you<00:05:35.900> see<00:05:36.080> why<00:05:36.729> you
