00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.740
 and if we are going to decorate them with a little 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:22.730
 sown strawberries 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:24.470
 and chocolate or chocolate syrup and 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:28.360
 we have a bowl what we are going to beat 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.360
 first they are a pair of eggs 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.839
 well let's beat well the same can 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.239
 use 

00:00:33.839 --> 00:00:38.469
 all in the blender or split with a 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:41.280
 mixer 

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:41.280
 louis 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.890
 We are going to put a teaspoon of 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.890
 vanilla 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:57.330
 one- quarter cup of whole milk 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.660
 I mean that it is not recessed 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.580
 we feel good 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.760
 and now here we are going to put our 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:15.270
 flour and make 'life is a cup and good 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:18.350
 we are the same putting this in 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:22.400
 the descriptions of the video are the 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:25.240
 correct amounts 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.240
 of the ingredients 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:37.150
 well well well well beaten let's put 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.150
 a tablespoon of sugar 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:46.829
 a pinch of salt that has been a 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:48.980
 eighth of a teaspoon and a quarter of 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:51.080
 cup of water 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:53.920
 and that will give us the consistency that 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:58.350
 we want to cut 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:01.590
 since we beat it well and the well beaten 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:05.549
 we're going to let them rest about 20 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:10.020
 minutes in the refrigerator or until 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:12.430
 I will use it to be able to make 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.709
