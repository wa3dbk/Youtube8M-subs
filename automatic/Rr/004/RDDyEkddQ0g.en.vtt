00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
much in the final product that's what

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.100 
much in the final product that's what
most<00:02:24.519> of<00:02:24.670> the<00:02:24.760> videos<00:02:25.060> are<00:02:25.239> gonna<00:02:25.420> be<00:02:25.660> like<00:02:25.870> at

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
most of the videos are gonna be like at

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:27.900 
most of the videos are gonna be like at
least<00:02:26.380> it's<00:02:26.709> a<00:02:26.769> lot<00:02:27.040> of<00:02:27.160> good<00:02:27.190> content<00:02:27.700> and

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
least it's a lot of good content and

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:29.430 
least it's a lot of good content and
it's<00:02:28.209> something<00:02:28.329> different<00:02:28.599> than<00:02:28.989> you<00:02:29.319> know

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
it's something different than you know

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.920 
it's something different than you know
just<00:02:29.470> a<00:02:29.769> normal<00:02:29.920> canvases<00:02:30.519> for<00:02:30.930> jewelers

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
just a normal canvases for jewelers

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.170 
just a normal canvases for jewelers
boards<00:02:32.230> and<00:02:32.410> then<00:02:32.470> back<00:02:32.650> to<00:02:32.799> normal<00:02:33.010> videos<00:02:33.340> so

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
boards and then back to normal videos so

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.479 
boards and then back to normal videos so
I<00:02:35.019> think<00:02:35.349> that<00:02:35.500> covers<00:02:35.709> from<00:02:35.860> H<00:02:36.040> everything<00:02:36.400> in

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489 
I think that covers from H everything in

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:38.430 
I think that covers from H everything in
this<00:02:36.549> video<00:02:36.970> like<00:02:37.390> I<00:02:37.420> said<00:02:37.780> if<00:02:38.019> you<00:02:38.110> like<00:02:38.260> any
