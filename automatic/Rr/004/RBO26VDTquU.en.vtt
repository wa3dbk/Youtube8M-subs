square piece now stud place it right

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.660 
square piece now stud place it right
there

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
there

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.559

this looks like that and you'll take a 1

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:50.020 
this looks like that and you'll take a 1
by<00:02:42.600> 1<00:02:42.829> smooth<00:02:45.049> it's<00:02:46.049> also<00:02:46.260> flat

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.060 

place<00:02:50.600> it<00:02:50.840> right<00:02:50.990> there<00:02:51.050> so<00:02:51.560> it's<00:02:51.710> like<00:02:51.890> this

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.070 
place it right there so it's like this

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:58.540 
place it right there so it's like this
so<00:02:52.310> far<00:02:53.530> then<00:02:54.530> take<00:02:54.920> a<00:02:55.100> 2<00:02:55.160> by<00:02:55.460> 4<00:02:56.290> block<00:02:57.520> place<00:02:58.520> it

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550 
so far then take a 2 by 4 block place it

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:05.920 
so far then take a 2 by 4 block place it
right<00:02:58.940> there<00:03:01.660> so<00:03:02.660> looks<00:03:02.840> like<00:03:02.960> this<00:03:04.630> and<00:03:05.630> take

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
right there so looks like this and take

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.540 
right there so looks like this and take
a<00:03:06.140> 1<00:03:06.440> by<00:03:06.470> 3<00:03:06.760> is<00:03:07.760> right<00:03:08.000> there<00:03:08.560> and<00:03:09.560> a<00:03:09.920> 1<00:03:10.340> by<00:03:10.370> 2

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 
a 1 by 3 is right there and a 1 by 2

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.200 
a 1 by 3 is right there and a 1 by 2
this<00:03:11.540> is<00:03:11.600> right<00:03:11.960> there<00:03:12.290> snaps<00:03:13.160> like<00:03:13.370> this<00:03:13.610> so

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:14.210 
this is right there snaps like this so

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:16.590 
this is right there snaps like this so
far

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.620 

all<00:03:17.600> right<00:03:17.810> and<00:03:18.260> we<00:03:18.980> will<00:03:19.130> take<00:03:19.400> one<00:03:20.150> by<00:03:20.390> one

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
all right and we will take one by one

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:23.740 
all right and we will take one by one
block<00:03:20.840> a<00:03:21.140> 2<00:03:21.290> right<00:03:21.740> 1<00:03:22.070> block<00:03:22.550> place<00:03:23.480> some

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
block a 2 right 1 block place some

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:29.230 
block a 2 right 1 block place some
together<00:03:24.730> so<00:03:25.730> pi<00:03:25.910> looks<00:03:26.090> like<00:03:26.270> now<00:03:26.480> now<00:03:28.240> place

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:29.240 
together so pi looks like now now place

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:36.190 
together so pi looks like now now place
