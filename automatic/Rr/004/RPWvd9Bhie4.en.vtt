00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:12.630
 so if you get that one wing 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:15.450
 above the other here is done simply 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:19.279
 you just need one wing that is taller 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:21.840
 press down a little and 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:23.880
 align all of me here she was 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.960
 slightly taller there are literally a few 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.029
 millimeters I'm him 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.090
 pinching you can look from on this 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:34.430
 the module they all became exactly 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:38.719
 accordingly, we have even wings 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:41.840
 what to do with making neck 

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:45.180
 preparing the lower need to bounce back 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:48.950
 the front part needs with you here with us 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:51.570
 there were 2 modules at the end 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.579
 that is, now we just have an orange 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.800
 ends further on the neck will have 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.730
 orange green cyan blue 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.870
 Violet 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:04.500
 so all the workpiece we are 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:07.659
 remove and start doing neck so take 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.530
 yellow paste 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:10.530
 such gods 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:24.850
 so we continue 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.850
 we will have six two modules 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.479
 width 

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:13.500
 so we will have each color here by 5 

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:17.569
 times two three 4 5 further with us after 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.569
 yellow goes green 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:06.350
 one two three four five continue 

00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:56.149
 so here we have what turned neck 

00:04:53.019 --> 00:05:02.719
 align print not necessarily at the end 

00:04:56.149 --> 00:05:06.699
 I did so I put the blue module like this 

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:11.059
 In other words, all 4 

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:14.629
 oh well yes 4 tips two modules at once 100 

00:05:11.059 --> 00:05:18.009
 Next I put the yellow module and Darcy 

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:18.009
 left the red module 

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:29.850
 that's what we get neck now 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:32.880
 we need to leave it accordingly 

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:33.480
 place to put us to put on 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:39.060
 a place 

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:44.010
 neck is done this way we 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:46.130
 pasted like this not like everyone else 

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:49.260
 modules here in the direction and vice versa 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:56.510
 we turn it over like this 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:56.510
 way here 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:08.300
 next we need to give it a sofa shape 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:08.300
 it's like this time 

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:32.770
 Well, actually the shape you can neck 

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:36.130
 give it to you what you think 

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:39.280
 so better please do it if 

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:42.220
 you like it so much if you donâ€™t like it 

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:45.390
 make me your way I'm not here 

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:45.390
 I limit you 

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:54.980
 Currently it is now 9 falls because 

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:59.140
 wings outweighs to us 

00:06:54.980 --> 00:07:04.010
 the swan was standing on beautiful coasters and 

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:09.010
 at the same time stood steadily did not fall 

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:11.750
 we need to make a stand 

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:13.700
 our next lesson will be like 

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:17.120
 make the stand very beautiful 

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:20.360
 cute but actually such 

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:23.420
 coasters you can then apply for 

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:24.200
 Any product is optional for 

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:26.570
 swan 

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:28.780
 This stand can be useful in any 

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:28.780
 cases
