00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:08.989
 7 in an argument 

00:00:08.989 --> 00:00:14.019
 become the high veluwe for John Boehner 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:18.400
 that fine 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.410
 johnston i am the 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.189
 a clear reason 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:30.319
 ronaldo 

00:00:30.319 --> 00:00:32.710
 the consumer association 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.710
 the car market in europe home taken away 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.990
 neither 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:01.240
 Holland 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.240
 10 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.200
 for my 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.200
 local residents 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.680
 it seems as if that weigher top man 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.420
 the river cannot handle the water 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.170
 exactly where I can 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.309
 3 

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:13.309
 good grace 

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:18.359
 but look at the design of the day 

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:21.359
 i was on my homework is always made wrong 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:25.380
 yes it is not in a low place the end 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.339
 this is what I was afraid of and that's why I came 

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:30.329
 thanks create a free account 

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:31.359
 that's okay 

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:34.619
 I hope the worst case is over, I think so 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:41.549
 so to see while saving his bank 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:43.629
 it becomes a lot lighter 

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:46.629
 something for the first time this week that the rule all 

00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:56.529
 9 

00:02:56.529 --> 00:03:00.290
 but if my house took over I would not be able to owe it to a sleeping person 

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:03.289
 being able to float completely to the sentence 

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:06.979
 see you 

00:03:08.399 --> 00:03:12.979
 although the carports are european takes years but luckily that didn't happen 

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:15.799
 enjoy dad's adventures 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:18.849
 8 I think I'm too old for that kind of thing 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:20.939
 that is the biggest nonsense 

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:25.129
 age has nothing to do with it only what you feel is important 

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:27.709
 maybe you are right 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:30.849
 but adventure is not very common in normal life 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:44.239
 especially banks at the moment 

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:49.389
 9 

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:52.529
 the 

00:03:52.529 --> 00:03:54.139
 protests 

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:56.349
 That's the long-lasting look 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:59.719
 3 

00:03:59.719 --> 00:04:00.769
 the Hague 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:01.999
 the sons 

00:04:01.999 --> 00:04:04.599
 her work is beautiful 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:06.099
 mh 

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:08.749
 minister Ab Klink 

00:04:08.749 --> 00:04:10.319
 that is very exaggerated 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:13.319
 but that's how I feel 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.490
 none of that 

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:51.629
 I think he fainted 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.050
 what are we not able to see in areas 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:56.509
 I do not find you 

00:04:56.509 --> 00:04:58.930
 I don't know but he's not good 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.490
 if you are completely out of the air, two players must have happened 

00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:07.210
 he wakes up 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:10.210
 what turned out to be 

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:20.349
 I also think not to Nickerie case 

00:05:21.339 --> 00:05:24.339
 what happened 3 8 

00:05:25.339 --> 00:05:27.939
 alcohol free 

00:05:27.939 --> 00:05:29.809
 and I 

00:05:29.809 --> 00:05:32.699
 I am not me either 

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:34.879
 what happened anyway I do 

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:36.729
 every one 

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:37.870
 w 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:39.090
 I can do my house 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:41.490
 i thought i do too 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:44.770
 no kiki that has disappeared 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:49.310
 I do not look at a pedicure I hope I am right I 

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:50.189
 purchased by 

00:05:50.189 --> 00:05:52.080
 but I think I'll only be real once 

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:55.569
 mh how hard that way I didn't come 

00:05:55.569 --> 00:05:58.719
 everyone here so eager to get to the rainbow 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:03.189
 always better 9 also not easy share 

00:06:04.619 --> 00:06:09.259
 but everything works where when I fell down in my bike tactics I moved 

00:06:09.259 --> 00:06:13.329
 en route to the wings a fence the one who is not too hard on the ground 

00:06:13.329 --> 00:06:15.189
 get it 

00:06:15.189 --> 00:06:18.189
 according to even if they are unconscious 

00:06:25.499 --> 00:06:27.960
 this 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:31.020
 last year the Turks stopped 

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:33.599
 but doing that is professor paul jans 

00:06:33.599 --> 00:06:36.830
 I wish Professor Paul so Mark learned to fly more safely 

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:43.180
 the angle that the who
