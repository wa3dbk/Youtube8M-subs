while I noticed at this pop though today
I'm<00:00:39.809> probably<00:00:40.050> this<00:00:40.469> much<00:00:40.800> inside<00:00:41.489> this<00:00:42.210> is

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
the fancy covering to it think it's

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.910 
the fancy covering to it think it's
because<00:00:45.180> it<00:00:45.360> will<00:00:45.539> eventually<00:00:45.899> loosened<00:00:46.800> up

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
play with just mascara itself about

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.449

Jo<00:04:03.100> eye<00:04:03.190> serum<00:04:03.640> I<00:04:03.880> think<00:04:04.329> it<00:04:04.510> is<00:04:04.690> because

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
Jo eye serum I think it is because

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.199 
Jo eye serum I think it is because
there's<00:04:05.560> more<00:04:05.829> ingredients<00:04:06.430> in<00:04:06.579> this<00:04:06.880> than

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989 
something a lot more on the safer side

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:16.740
