shape so every time I cross the top over

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.320 
shape so every time I cross the top over
I'm<00:01:40.830> not<00:01:41.070> going<00:01:41.250> to<00:01:41.310> add<00:01:41.400> any<00:01:41.610> hair<00:01:41.850> but<00:01:42.030> when<00:01:42.300> I

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.850 
cross the bottom over and add a piece
and<00:01:47.670> just<00:01:47.970> continue<00:01:48.390> holding<00:01:48.660> it<00:01:48.780> up<00:01:48.990> for<00:01:49.590> as

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
and just continue holding it up for as

00:01:49.860 --> 00:02:08.109 
and just continue holding it up for as
long<00:01:50.580> as<00:01:50.640> far<00:01:50.880> as<00:01:50.970> you<00:01:51.090> want<00:01:51.119> it<00:01:51.330> to<00:01:51.450> go<00:01:51.570> up

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:09.999

and the hardest part of this braid is

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:15.309 
and the hardest part of this braid is
the<00:02:10.190> shaping<00:02:11.709> the<00:02:12.709> link<00:02:13.690> that<00:02:14.690> you<00:02:14.810> hold<00:02:15.050> your

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:20.050 
the shaping the link that you hold your
your<00:02:15.860> braids<00:02:16.190> out<00:02:16.690> to<00:02:17.690> determines<00:02:18.200> how<00:02:19.060> where

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
your braids out to determines how where

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.790 
your braids out to determines how where
the<00:02:20.239> braid<00:02:20.420> is<00:02:20.540> going<00:02:20.599> to<00:02:20.810> sit<00:02:20.989> basically<00:02:21.500> if

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
the braid is going to sit basically if

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.890 
the braid is going to sit basically if
that<00:02:22.010> makes<00:02:22.190> any<00:02:22.280> sense<00:02:22.430> so<00:02:25.599> when<00:02:26.599> you<00:02:26.660> want<00:02:26.840> it

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
that makes any sense so when you want it

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.350 
that makes any sense so when you want it
to<00:02:27.019> get<00:02:27.170> taller<00:02:27.470> you<00:02:28.069> let<00:02:28.489> these<00:02:28.670> sections<00:02:29.150> be

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
to get taller you let these sections be

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:36.160 
to get taller you let these sections be
a<00:02:29.390> little<00:02:29.660> bit<00:02:29.780> longer

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:43.290 

you

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:03:01.589 

you

00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:01.599 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:04.149 

you're<00:03:02.599> sections<00:03:03.110> when<00:03:03.590> you<00:03:03.709> start<00:03:03.980> noticing

00:03:04.149 --> 00:03:04.159 
you're sections when you start noticing

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:06.520 
you're sections when you start noticing
that<00:03:04.700> you're<00:03:04.849> going<00:03:04.970> to<00:03:05.060> start<00:03:05.409> needing<00:03:06.409> to

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
that you're going to start needing to

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.880 
that you're going to start needing to
run<00:03:06.680> out<00:03:06.799> of<00:03:06.830> hair<00:03:07.129> to<00:03:07.629> end<00:03:08.629> the<00:03:08.750> section<00:03:09.170> you

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
run out of hair to end the section you

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:12.039 
run out of hair to end the section you
can<00:03:10.040> start<00:03:10.340> taking<00:03:10.489> thicker<00:03:11.000> sections<00:03:11.330> you're

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:12.049 
can start taking thicker sections you're

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:13.990 
can start taking thicker sections you're
not<00:03:12.170> gonna<00:03:12.290> be<00:03:12.409> able<00:03:12.500> to<00:03:12.650> tell<00:03:12.860> in<00:03:13.670> the<00:03:13.819> long

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
not gonna be able to tell in the long

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.089 
not gonna be able to tell in the long

run and now I'm just going to finish

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:17.530 
run and now I'm just going to finish
this<00:03:16.280> off<00:03:16.489> all<00:03:16.760> the<00:03:16.879> way<00:03:16.970> the<00:03:17.120> ends<00:03:17.390> with<00:03:17.510> a

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
this off all the way the ends with a

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:28.500 
this off all the way the ends with a
three<00:03:17.840> strand<00:03:18.140> braid

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:29.850 

now<00:03:29.020> I'm<00:03:29.110> going<00:03:29.230> to<00:03:29.260> take<00:03:29.410> a<00:03:29.440> pin<00:03:29.650> and<00:03:29.800> clip

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860 
now I'm going to take a pin and clip

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:31.199 
now I'm going to take a pin and clip
this<00:03:30.129> out<00:03:30.340> of<00:03:30.430> the<00:03:30.520> way<00:03:30.640> so<00:03:30.700> that<00:03:30.879> I<00:03:30.970> can<00:03:31.120> work

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
this out of the way so that I can work

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:39.479 
this out of the way so that I can work
on<00:03:31.390> the<00:03:31.540> next<00:03:31.810> lean<00:03:32.410> section<00:03:38.129> and<00:03:39.129> clip<00:03:39.310> those

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
on the next lean section and clip those

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:42.660 
on the next lean section and clip those
up<00:03:39.700> now<00:03:40.110> this<00:03:41.110> section<00:03:41.379> is<00:03:41.769> going<00:03:42.160> to<00:03:42.310> be<00:03:42.400> very

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
up now this section is going to be very

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:44.250 
up now this section is going to be very
similar<00:03:42.940> to<00:03:43.120> the<00:03:43.420> top<00:03:43.629> except<00:03:44.080> you're<00:03:44.230> just

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
similar to the top except you're just

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.410 
similar to the top except you're just
going<00:03:44.500> to<00:03:44.590> take<00:03:44.739> smaller<00:03:45.099> sections<00:03:45.610> of<00:03:46.060> hair

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 
going to take smaller sections of hair

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.220 
going to take smaller sections of hair
when<00:03:46.630> you<00:03:46.720> add<00:03:46.870> it<00:03:47.019> in<00:03:48.900> you're<00:03:49.900> gonna<00:03:50.050> do<00:03:50.110> the

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
when you add it in you're gonna do the

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.979 
when you add it in you're gonna do the
same<00:03:50.440> thing<00:03:50.500> split<00:03:51.250> it<00:03:51.370> in<00:03:51.459> three<00:03:51.720> and<00:03:52.720> you

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989 
same thing split it in three and you

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:54.660 
same thing split it in three and you
want<00:03:53.170> to<00:03:53.230> hold<00:03:53.349> the<00:03:53.500> braid<00:03:53.680> up<00:03:53.890> as<00:03:54.160> you<00:03:54.340> go<00:03:54.459> at

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 
want to hold the braid up as you go at

00:03:54.670 --> 00:04:12.090 
want to hold the braid up as you go at
first<00:04:00.000> really<00:04:01.000> little<00:04:01.269> sections<00:04:01.720> in

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.100 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:19.160 

you

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:19.170 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:33.920 

you

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:35.880 

sections<00:04:34.930> that<00:04:35.050> I<00:04:35.170> add<00:04:35.320> in<00:04:35.440> are<00:04:35.560> going<00:04:35.710> to<00:04:35.770> get

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:35.890 
sections that I add in are going to get

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:37.200 
sections that I add in are going to get
a<00:04:35.920> little<00:04:36.130> thicker<00:04:36.310> as<00:04:36.550> I<00:04:36.670> go<00:04:36.850> because<00:04:37.030> I<00:04:37.180> can

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
a little thicker as I go because I can

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:39.510 
a little thicker as I go because I can
notice<00:04:37.630> that<00:04:37.810> I<00:04:38.050> need<00:04:38.800> to<00:04:38.920> start<00:04:39.160> running<00:04:39.310> out

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 
notice that I need to start running out

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:47.410 
notice that I need to start running out
of<00:04:39.550> hair

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:47.420 

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:50.290 

and<00:04:47.930> then<00:04:48.170> as<00:04:48.590> with<00:04:48.860> the<00:04:49.430> first<00:04:49.850> one<00:04:50.090> just

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:50.300 
and then as with the first one just

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:59.470 
and then as with the first one just
braid<00:04:50.720> all<00:04:50.900> the<00:04:50.930> way<00:04:51.080> to<00:04:51.200> the<00:04:51.380> ends

00:04:59.470 --> 00:04:59.480 

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:02.710

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:04.710 
now I'm going to go through and unclip

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:13.300 
now I'm going to go through and unclip
everything<00:05:08.629> now<00:05:09.629> is<00:05:09.870> the<00:05:10.020> fun<00:05:10.229> part

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:13.310

what<00:05:13.910> you're<00:05:14.030> gonna<00:05:14.150> do<00:05:14.420> is<00:05:14.690> take<00:05:14.960> one<00:05:15.680> of<00:05:15.770> the

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:15.830 
what you're gonna do is take one of the

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:18.850 
what you're gonna do is take one of the
bottom<00:05:16.100> sections<00:05:16.550> or<00:05:16.820> top<00:05:17.150> brother<00:05:17.860> and

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:18.860 
bottom sections or top brother and

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:22.480 
bottom sections or top brother and
you're<00:05:19.490> gonna<00:05:20.170> wind<00:05:21.170> it<00:05:21.380> around<00:05:21.530> kind<00:05:22.190> of<00:05:22.280> hold

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:22.490 
you're gonna wind it around kind of hold

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:24.220 
you're gonna wind it around kind of hold
it<00:05:22.580> out<00:05:22.670> where<00:05:22.850> you<00:05:22.910> want<00:05:23.060> it<00:05:23.120> to<00:05:23.210> sit<00:05:23.390> and<00:05:23.810> then

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:24.230 
it out where you want it to sit and then

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:26.080 
it out where you want it to sit and then
wind<00:05:24.560> the<00:05:24.680> rest<00:05:24.890> arrayed<00:05:25.250> around<00:05:25.460> the

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:26.090 
wind the rest arrayed around the

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:31.270 
wind the rest arrayed around the
ponytail<00:05:29.230> when<00:05:30.230> you<00:05:30.320> get<00:05:30.470> to<00:05:30.560> the<00:05:30.680> end<00:05:30.830> just<00:05:31.010> go

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:37.700 
ahead and pin that down and then you go

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:38.890 
ahead and pin that down and then you go
over<00:05:37.820> to<00:05:37.910> the<00:05:38.060> other<00:05:38.180> side<00:05:38.480> and<00:05:38.630> you<00:05:38.690> do<00:05:38.810> the

over to the other side and you do the

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:43.690 
over to the other side and you do the
same<00:05:39.080> thing<00:05:41.770> make<00:05:42.770> sure<00:05:42.800> it<00:05:43.040> doesn't<00:05:43.310> catch<00:05:43.490> up

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:43.700 
same thing make sure it doesn't catch up

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:48.940 
same thing make sure it doesn't catch up
to<00:05:43.880> that<00:05:44.030> one<00:05:46.750> wind<00:05:47.750> it<00:05:47.960> around<00:05:48.050> and<00:05:48.620> then<00:05:48.710> pin

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:48.950 
to that one wind it around and then pin

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:57.010 
to that one wind it around and then pin
it

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:57.020 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.040

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:00.050 
okay and now you're going to do the same

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:05.410 
okay and now you're going to do the same
thing<00:06:00.320> with<00:06:01.270> one<00:06:02.270> of<00:06:02.390> these<00:06:03.940> you<00:06:04.940> can<00:06:05.060> kind<00:06:05.330> of

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:05.420 
thing with one of these you can kind of

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:06.850 
thing with one of these you can kind of
pull<00:06:05.600> it<00:06:05.630> tighter<00:06:05.900> so<00:06:06.170> that<00:06:06.320> it<00:06:06.410> kind<00:06:06.590> of<00:06:06.620> sits

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:06.860 
pull it tighter so that it kind of sits

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:08.350 
pull it tighter so that it kind of sits
out<00:06:07.010> more<00:06:07.250> I<00:06:07.490> think<00:06:07.640> it<00:06:07.820> looks<00:06:07.970> going<00:06:08.180> pretty

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:08.360 
out more I think it looks going pretty

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:20.850 
out more I think it looks going pretty
like<00:06:08.540> that<00:06:10.900> in<00:06:11.900> it

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:20.860 

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:23.879 

and<00:06:20.949> then<00:06:21.610> with<00:06:21.819> this<00:06:22.000> one<00:06:22.710> they're<00:06:23.710> going<00:06:23.830> to

00:06:23.879 --> 00:06:23.889 
and then with this one they're going to

00:06:23.889 --> 00:06:26.820 
and then with this one they're going to
go<00:06:24.009> ahead<00:06:24.069> and<00:06:24.280> pin<00:06:24.460> it<00:06:24.580> all<00:06:24.789> the<00:06:24.909> way<00:06:25.000> down<00:06:25.830> to

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:26.830 
go ahead and pin it all the way down to

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:32.820 
go ahead and pin it all the way down to
the<00:06:26.949> bottom<00:06:27.159> of<00:06:27.460> this<00:06:27.580> whole<00:06:27.819> thing<00:06:31.500> and<00:06:32.500> pin

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:32.830 
the bottom of this whole thing and pin

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:35.850 
the bottom of this whole thing and pin
it<00:06:32.979> to<00:06:33.129> the<00:06:33.159> base<00:06:33.449> and<00:06:34.449> now<00:06:35.319> for<00:06:35.590> the<00:06:35.680> body

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:35.860 
it to the base and now for the body

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:37.230 
it to the base and now for the body
you're<00:06:36.159> going<00:06:36.310> to<00:06:36.370> take<00:06:36.550> it<00:06:36.699> all<00:06:36.849> the<00:06:36.879> way<00:06:37.000> up

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:37.240 
you're going to take it all the way up

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:41.129 
you're going to take it all the way up
and<00:06:37.889> across<00:06:38.889> and<00:06:39.629> then<00:06:40.629> you're<00:06:40.780> going<00:06:40.870> to<00:06:40.960> pin

00:06:41.129 --> 00:06:41.139 
and across and then you're going to pin

00:06:41.139 --> 00:06:43.980 
and across and then you're going to pin
it<00:06:41.169> down<00:06:41.289> up<00:06:41.979> against<00:06:42.340> the<00:06:42.520> head<00:06:42.750> up<00:06:43.750> at<00:06:43.900> the

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:43.990 
it down up against the head up at the

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:55.570 
it down up against the head up at the
top<00:06:46.500> now<00:06:47.500> unbraid<00:06:48.099> this<00:06:48.659> in

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:55.580 

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:57.790 

and<00:06:56.120> you're<00:06:56.240> gonna<00:06:56.390> split<00:06:56.690> it<00:06:56.870> in<00:06:56.960> two<00:06:57.170> to<00:06:57.410> make

00:06:57.790 --> 00:06:57.800 
and you're gonna split it in two to make

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:59.320 
and you're gonna split it in two to make
the<00:06:57.950> little<00:06:58.100> antennas<00:06:58.610> and<00:06:58.820> you<00:06:58.910> can<00:06:59.090> twist

00:06:59.320 --> 00:06:59.330 
the little antennas and you can twist

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:02.140 
the little antennas and you can twist
them<00:06:59.560> you<00:07:00.560> kind<00:07:00.770> of<00:07:00.800> arch<00:07:00.980> them<00:07:01.280> and<00:07:01.880> it<00:07:02.030> helps

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:02.150 
them you kind of arch them and it helps

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:03.580 
them you kind of arch them and it helps
to<00:07:02.480> if<00:07:02.570> you<00:07:02.660> use<00:07:02.780> a<00:07:02.810> little<00:07:02.930> bit<00:07:03.080> bit<00:07:03.560> of

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:03.590 
to if you use a little bit bit of

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:08.640 
to if you use a little bit bit of
hairspray<00:07:03.830> to<00:07:04.220> kind<00:07:04.430> of<00:07:04.460> keep<00:07:04.640> it<00:07:04.760> in<00:07:04.880> place
