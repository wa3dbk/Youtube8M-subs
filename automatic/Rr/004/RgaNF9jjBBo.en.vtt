00:00:05.294 --> 00:00:11.904
 - Their number is growing, and you go on foot. You never get to the forest alive. 

00:00:12.006 --> 00:00:15.416
 - I have an idea. We can ask for eagles. 

00:00:15.486 --> 00:00:16.726
 - Yes, eagles! 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.080
 “No, no, stand, stand with the eagles.” 

00:00:20.126 --> 00:00:22.852
 - But they solve any of our problems. 

00:00:22.872 --> 00:00:23.870
 “No more eagles.” 

00:00:23.954 --> 00:00:25.004
 - Ok, okay. 

00:00:25.204 --> 00:00:32.864
 How was to end "The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug" 

00:00:34.204 --> 00:00:37.164
 “Can't you rip me around?” I can hide anything in my pants. 

00:00:37.932 --> 00:00:41.322
 - An abomination! Do not tell me about your sexual affairs, dwarf! 

00:00:42.108 --> 00:00:46.342
 Just kidding, it turns me on like this. From this day I will always love you. 

00:00:46.965 --> 00:00:46.969
 - Yes. 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:49.850
 “Together, we will erase this petty enmity between our peoples.” 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.210
 All because you hinted at the contents of your pants. 

00:00:53.302 --> 00:00:55.680
 - Wow. So you will let me out? 

00:00:55.734 --> 00:00:57.792
 - Oh no. You're a prisoner, stay there. 

00:01:02.282 --> 00:01:03.622
 - Kill the elf girl! 

00:01:03.714 --> 00:01:05.506
 - Which one is an elf girl? 

00:01:08.082 --> 00:01:10.492
 - Hyhyh, got it? Because they all look the same. 

00:01:11.652 --> 00:01:13.492
 - We all look the same. 

00:01:18.204 --> 00:01:19.304
 - By you... 

00:01:19.494 --> 00:01:20.324
 on the face... 

00:01:20.774 --> 00:01:22.068
 bird's poo! 

00:01:23.898 --> 00:01:27.738
 “And why didn't anyone say anything?” Humiliating. 

00:01:30.216 --> 00:01:33.936
 “We woke the city because we caught these gnomes for stealing weapons.” 

00:01:35.286 --> 00:01:37.166
 - We want to regain our mountain. 

00:01:39.372 --> 00:01:41.632
 - If we succeed, we will all be rich! 

00:01:41.808 --> 00:01:42.508
 - Oh, well. 

00:01:44.258 --> 00:01:46.698
 - I need as many black arrows as you can collect. 

00:01:48.234 --> 00:01:52.854
 “Because the dragon sat in that grief, and we have just discussed how this is the only weapon that can penetrate its scales.” 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.740
 - We are not fools, right? 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:56.910
 - Nah. 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.320
 “So we can't just go in there, expecting the dragon to be friendly?” 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:05.040
 - In fact, the dragon completely wrong attitude. They are very easy to train. 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:07.510
 “I grow dragons like my children.” 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.890
 - You need to travel only with a good luck dragon. 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.956
 - Oh, okay. Then... 

00:02:14.956 --> 00:02:16.542
 - I am the last! 

00:02:16.572 --> 00:02:20.462
 - Ok, we understood. We will be friends with the dragon! 

00:02:21.662 --> 00:02:23.662
 24 hours later 

00:02:31.848 --> 00:02:33.468
 - And what do you think you're doing? 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.750
 - Friends?!? He does not want to be friends! 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.890
 - I'll show you friends! 

00:02:44.546 --> 00:02:45.716
 - What have we done? 

00:02:45.942 --> 00:02:50.180
 - I'm the flame! I... 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:51.796
 Death. 

00:02:52.686 --> 00:02:53.446
 - Black arrow. 

00:02:55.246 --> 00:02:56.796
 - Ltd! Right in ... oh my! 

00:03:02.574 --> 00:03:04.574
 - What? How? 

00:03:04.758 --> 00:03:05.628
 - I shot him. 

00:03:05.867 --> 00:03:07.924
 - But where? How? 

00:03:08.644 --> 00:03:11.924
 - I do not know. I don't even have to be in this story! 

00:03:12.314 --> 00:03:14.242
 the end 

00:03:24.172 --> 00:03:28.132
