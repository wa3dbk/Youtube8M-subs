waiting we finally got one in the shop

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.160 
waiting we finally got one in the shop
hands<00:00:19.980> on<00:00:20.130> which<00:00:20.580> is<00:00:20.699> very<00:00:20.910> exciting<00:00:21.390> this

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
hands on which is very exciting this

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.599 
hands on which is very exciting this
camera<00:00:22.529> has<00:00:22.650> caused<00:00:22.949> such<00:00:23.160> a<00:00:23.189> sensation

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
camera has caused such a sensation

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.240 
camera has caused such a sensation
because<00:00:23.910> it<00:00:24.180> has<00:00:24.420> a<00:00:24.449> brand<00:00:24.869> new<00:00:25.019> developed<00:00:25.680> 20

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
because it has a brand new developed 20

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.240 
because it has a brand new developed 20
megapixel<00:00:26.849> aps-c<00:00:27.090> size<00:00:27.930> sensor<00:00:28.099> this<00:00:29.099> is<00:00:29.220> a

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
megapixel aps-c size sensor this is a

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.130 
megapixel aps-c size sensor this is a
big<00:00:29.429> deal<00:00:29.580> because<00:00:29.760> for<00:00:30.150> years<00:00:30.480> cannot<00:00:30.990> have

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
big deal because for years cannot have

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.709 
big deal because for years cannot have
been<00:00:31.470> using<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:31.890> same<00:00:32.130> 18<00:00:32.610> megapixel<00:00:32.820> sensor

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
been using the same 18 megapixel sensor

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.110 
been using the same 18 megapixel sensor
so<00:00:34.020> this<00:00:34.170> is<00:00:34.290> really<00:00:34.530> exciting<00:00:34.980> time<00:00:35.219> it<00:00:35.969> also

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
so this is really exciting time it also

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.100 
so this is really exciting time it also
has<00:00:37.100> three<00:00:38.100> inch<00:00:38.280> touch<00:00:38.640> screen<00:00:38.989> so<00:00:39.989> you<00:00:40.020> can

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
has three inch touch screen so you can

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.619 
has three inch touch screen so you can
use<00:00:40.379> touch<00:00:40.590> to<00:00:40.770> shoot<00:00:40.950> you<00:00:41.309> also<00:00:41.730> articulate

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
use touch to shoot you also articulate

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.660 
use touch to shoot you also articulate
so<00:00:42.809> it's<00:00:42.960> very<00:00:43.200> good<00:00:43.469> for<00:00:43.530> movie<00:00:43.950> recording<00:00:44.219> on

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
so it's very good for movie recording on

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.060 
so it's very good for movie recording on
that<00:00:45.450> subject<00:00:45.690> what<00:00:46.289> makes<00:00:46.500> this<00:00:46.620> camera<00:00:46.920> so

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
that subject what makes this camera so

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.160 
that subject what makes this camera so
exciting<00:00:47.520> is<00:00:47.670> that<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.969> sensor<00:00:48.329> has<00:00:48.480> built<00:00:48.870> in

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
exciting is that the sensor has built in

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.790 
exciting is that the sensor has built in
phase<00:00:49.829> detect<00:00:50.309> autofocus<00:00:51.300> sensors<00:00:51.719> so<00:00:52.440> it

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
phase detect autofocus sensors so it

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.350 
phase detect autofocus sensors so it
means<00:00:52.980> that<00:00:53.250> basically<00:00:53.370> you<00:00:53.670> can<00:00:53.820> get<00:00:54.239> the

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
means that basically you can get the

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.660 
means that basically you can get the
same<00:00:54.570> kind<00:00:54.840> of<00:00:54.930> AF<00:00:55.260> speed<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:56.010> performance<00:00:56.129> in

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
same kind of AF speed and performance in

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.279 
same kind of AF speed and performance in
Live<00:00:56.910> View<00:00:56.940> as<00:00:57.360> you<00:00:57.510> can<00:00:57.660> get<00:00:57.840> when<00:00:57.960> using<00:00:58.230> the

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
Live View as you can get when using the

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.160 
Live View as you can get when using the
optical<00:00:58.680> viewfinder<00:00:59.219> this<00:01:00.120> makes<00:01:00.629> shooting

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
optical viewfinder this makes shooting

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.770 
optical viewfinder this makes shooting
video<00:01:01.590> a<00:01:01.890> breeze<00:01:02.520> and<00:01:02.879> it<00:01:03.030> really<00:01:03.300> opens<00:01:03.690> up

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
video a breeze and it really opens up

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.030 
video a breeze and it really opens up
the<00:01:03.899> possibilities<00:01:04.470> of<00:01:04.500> shooting<00:01:04.890> like<00:01:05.010> a

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
the possibilities of shooting like a

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.030 
the possibilities of shooting like a
camcorder<00:01:05.369> using<00:01:06.060> auto<00:01:06.330> focus<00:01:06.990> with<00:01:07.350> a<00:01:07.380> DSLR

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
camcorder using auto focus with a DSLR

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.830 
camcorder using auto focus with a DSLR
for<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.430> very<00:01:08.700> first<00:01:08.970> time<00:01:09.119> other<00:01:09.570> great

obviously<00:02:13.079> seen<00:02:13.260> on<00:02:13.409> the<00:02:13.469> 60d<00:02:13.920> as<00:02:14.040> well<00:02:14.219> but

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:14.519 
obviously seen on the 60d as well but

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:18.849 
obviously seen on the 60d as well but
this<00:02:14.700> makes<00:02:14.909> video<00:02:15.689> work<00:02:16.319> so<00:02:16.859> easy<00:02:17.069> brilliant

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:18.859 
this makes video work so easy brilliant

00:02:18.859 --> 00:02:20.989 
this makes video work so easy brilliant
let's<00:02:19.859> have<00:02:19.950> a<00:02:19.980> cue<00:02:20.189> button<00:02:20.370> which<00:02:20.849> is

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:20.999 
let's have a cue button which is

00:02:20.999 --> 00:02:22.610 
let's have a cue button which is
obviously<00:02:21.269> been<00:02:21.540> seen<00:02:21.749> on<00:02:21.930> quite<00:02:22.139> a<00:02:22.170> few<00:02:22.200> Canon

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620

obviously been seen on quite a few Canon
cameras<00:02:22.950> now<00:02:23.069> so<00:02:23.370> we<00:02:23.609> can<00:02:23.639> use<00:02:23.879> that<00:02:24.060> to<00:02:24.120> adjust

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:24.629 
cameras now so we can use that to adjust

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:26.300 
cameras now so we can use that to adjust
various<00:02:24.780> settings<00:02:25.200> but<00:02:25.950> the<00:02:26.040> good<00:02:26.280> thing
