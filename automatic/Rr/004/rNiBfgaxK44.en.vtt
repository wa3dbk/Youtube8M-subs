00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:08.890
 my state of washington and tel 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:11.620
 best coast also for jesi indica 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:14.620
 Lapland and he was born in Carbonia 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:17.319
 People are also quieter 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:20.650
 misdeed from the land near the sea 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:23.680

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:29.260
 at home to that tell you the last thing but how 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.209
 held in mind as you decided to 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.940
 move and change life to a certain one 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:37.900
 point she was 25 and getting pro 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:39.790
 because right here we are here because 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:44.290
 we went to Italy for our moons 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:47.200

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:50.260
 full of so many quantities and for us 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:52.750

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:57.250
 and nodes that s 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:03:00.549
 we found a quieter focus and 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:02.470
 we thought from here enter here a 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:06.159
 nails that we can make a vegetable garden 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:09.220

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:17.380
 this is because we are not back to the net state 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:21.400
