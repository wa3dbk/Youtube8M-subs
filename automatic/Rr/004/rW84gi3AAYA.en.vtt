peach<00:00:32.340> on<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:32.910> quacker<00:00:33.180> and<00:00:33.510> I<00:00:33.989> actually<00:00:34.410> it's

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
peach on the quacker and I actually it's

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.650 
peach on the quacker and I actually it's
funny<00:00:34.770> I<00:00:34.860> don't<00:00:35.130> think<00:00:35.760> I've<00:00:35.880> ever<00:00:36.120> played<00:00:36.480> as

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
funny I don't think I've ever played as

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.290 
funny I don't think I've ever played as
the<00:00:36.809> quacker<00:00:37.079> and<00:00:37.730> usually<00:00:38.730> I<00:00:38.790> don't<00:00:38.879> like<00:00:39.030> the

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
the quacker and usually I don't like the

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.240 
the quacker and usually I don't like the
baby<00:00:39.480> characters<00:00:39.930> so<00:00:40.440> this<00:00:40.590> will<00:00:40.739> probably<00:00:41.040> be

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
baby characters so this will probably be

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.209 
baby characters so this will probably be
pretty<00:00:41.670> interesting<00:00:42.180> I<00:00:42.300> would<00:00:42.360> say<00:00:43.040> we've<00:00:44.040> got

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
pretty interesting I would say we've got

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.100 
pretty interesting I would say we've got
to<00:00:44.309> wait<00:00:44.520> a<00:00:44.700> little<00:00:44.910> bit<00:00:45.120> for<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.510> race<00:00:45.899> to

kendo<00:01:10.320> commentaries<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.540> always<00:01:12.540> dr.<00:01:12.780> kendo

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
kendo commentaries and always dr. kendo

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.289 
kendo commentaries and always dr. kendo
the<00:01:13.530> original<00:01:13.950> channel<00:01:14.280> was<00:01:14.490> associated<00:01:15.150> with

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
the original channel was associated with

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:16.940

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
the name dr. kendo commentary so I

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.410 
the name dr. kendo commentary so I
figured<00:01:17.340> this<00:01:17.460> would<00:01:17.610> be<00:01:17.670> an<00:01:17.820> easy<00:01:18.060> change

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 
weight the question was how heavy do I

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.140 
weight the question was how heavy do I
think<00:03:51.650> he<00:03:51.799> is<00:03:51.980> so<00:03:52.250> if<00:03:52.400> I<00:03:52.519> kind<00:03:52.819> of<00:03:52.849> had<00:03:53.000> to<00:03:53.090> take

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 
daily I'm sure basically what I would

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.150 
daily I'm sure basically what I would
say<00:04:47.180> is<00:04:47.330> that<00:04:47.360> he's<00:04:47.900> got<00:04:48.080> to<00:04:48.230> be<00:04:48.290> somewhere<00:04:48.560> I

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:49.160 
say is that he's got to be somewhere I

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.900

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:52.910 
would put it around 315 pounds I would

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:55.570 
would put it around 315 pounds I would
say<00:04:53.150> that<00:04:53.600> is<00:04:53.870> that<00:04:54.830> might<00:04:55.010> be<00:04:55.130> a<00:04:55.160> conservative

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580

had 66.7% of users vote for 301 to 400

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:12.250 
had 66.7% of users vote for 301 to 400
pounds<00:05:10.220> which<00:05:10.910> is<00:05:11.060> obviously<00:05:11.390> a<00:05:11.480> huge<00:05:11.540> range

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:12.260 
pounds which is obviously a huge range

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:17.050 
pounds which is obviously a huge range
while<00:05:12.970> 33.3%<00:05:13.970> voted<00:05:14.840> for<00:05:15.050> 200<00:05:15.740> to<00:05:15.980> 300<00:05:16.700> pounds

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:18.700 
while 33.3% voted for 200 to 300 pounds
so<00:05:17.090> kind<00:05:17.570> of<00:05:17.600> on<00:05:17.720> a<00:05:17.750> lesser<00:05:18.140> scale<00:05:18.320> for<00:05:18.680> that

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:18.710 
so kind of on a lesser scale for that

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:20.800 
so kind of on a lesser scale for that
but<00:05:19.310> the<00:05:19.460> only<00:05:19.610> problem<00:05:20.030> with<00:05:20.120> this<00:05:20.300> poll<00:05:20.570> is

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:20.810 
but the only problem with this poll is

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:24.190 
but the only problem with this poll is
that<00:05:21.020> the<00:05:21.610> 66.7%<00:05:22.610> of<00:05:23.000> users<00:05:23.330> that<00:05:23.360> voted<00:05:23.840> that

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:24.200 
that the 66.7% of users that voted that

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.680 
that the 66.7% of users that voted that
was<00:05:24.290> only<00:05:24.500> two<00:05:24.680> people<00:05:24.919> and<00:05:25.310> then<00:05:25.550> the<00:05:25.820> 33.3%

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:26.690 
was only two people and then the 33.3%

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:28.690 
was only two people and then the 33.3%
that<00:05:27.139> was<00:05:27.229> only<00:05:27.350> one<00:05:27.620> person<00:05:27.830> so<00:05:28.340> obviously

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:28.700 
that was only one person so obviously

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:30.670 
that was only one person so obviously
only<00:05:28.850> three<00:05:29.210> people<00:05:29.389> voted<00:05:29.870> in<00:05:29.930> this<00:05:30.080> poll<00:05:30.350> so

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:30.680 
only three people voted in this poll so

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.340 
only three people voted in this poll so
it's<00:05:31.040> not<00:05:31.190> a<00:05:31.220> huge<00:05:31.660> population<00:05:32.660> to<00:05:33.110> get<00:05:33.260> the

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:33.350 
it's not a huge population to get the

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:35.380 
it's not a huge population to get the
data<00:05:33.560> from<00:05:33.860> but<00:05:34.430> if<00:05:34.669> you<00:05:34.910> check<00:05:35.120> in<00:05:35.270> the<00:05:35.330> back

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:35.390 
data from but if you check in the back

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:38.409 
data from but if you check in the back
of<00:05:35.720> the<00:05:35.840> wario<00:05:36.260> world<00:05:36.530> game<00:05:37.040> the<00:05:37.880> instruction

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:38.419 
of the wario world game the instruction

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:40.270 
of the wario world game the instruction
booklet<00:05:38.630> it<00:05:38.960> says<00:05:39.290> somewhere<00:05:39.590> in<00:05:39.860> there<00:05:40.070> that

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:40.280 
booklet it says somewhere in there that

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:43.360 
booklet it says somewhere in there that
Wario<00:05:40.970> it<00:05:41.660> says<00:05:41.870> that<00:05:41.990> he<00:05:42.080> weighs<00:05:42.229> 308<00:05:43.039> pounds

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:43.370 
Wario it says that he weighs 308 pounds

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:46.360 
Wario it says that he weighs 308 pounds
so<00:05:43.970> I<00:05:44.300> think<00:05:44.360> Nintendo's<00:05:45.289> you<00:05:45.650> know<00:05:45.770> official

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:46.370 
so I think Nintendo's you know official

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:49.900 
so I think Nintendo's you know official
record<00:05:46.700> there<00:05:46.970> would<00:05:47.539> have<00:05:47.630> been<00:05:48.280> 308<00:05:49.280> so<00:05:49.669> at

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:49.910 
record there would have been 308 so at

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:51.550 
record there would have been 308 so at
least<00:05:50.090> I<00:05:50.240> was<00:05:50.390> close<00:05:50.630> with<00:05:50.660> my<00:05:51.020> guests<00:05:51.320> that<00:05:51.530> I

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:51.560

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.070 
least I was close with my guests that I
