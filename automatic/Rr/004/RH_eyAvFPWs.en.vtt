ALLISON HOLKER (OFFSCREEN):
Dancing With the Stars finally

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.660
reveals their new cast.

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:10.510
Wendy Williams gets a danc
lesson from Abby Lee Miller.

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:13.340
And Cirque de Soleil dazzles
at the Oscars.

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:16.860
This is Just Dance for
March 1, 2012.

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:30.220
[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:30.810
Hey guys.

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.670
I'm Allison Holker, and I'm a
dancer choreographer from

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:35.070
right here in LA.

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.900
And I have a lot of information
to share with you

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.270
guys about the dance world
so let's jump on in.

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.150
Dancing With the Stars finally
released the new cast for

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.360
Season 14 on Good Morning,
America.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.150
Now that that list is out, we
can put all those crazy

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:48.650
casting rumors to rest.

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:49.970
Until next season anyway.

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.950
And the cast for Season 14 is
Gladys Knight and Tristan.

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:57.440
Melissa Gilbert and Maksim.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.640
Jack Wagner and Anna.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.930
Gavin DeGraw and Karina.

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.180
Donald Driver and Peta.

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.540
Roshon Fegan and Chelsie.

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.860
Katherine Jenkins and Mark.

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:10.910
William Levy and Cheryl.

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:13.470
Maria Menounos and Derek.

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.320
Martina Navratilova and Tony.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.290
Sherri Shepherd and Val.

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.150
And finally, Jaleel
White and Kym.

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.090
Now that the new cast for Season
14 has been revealed,

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.560
make sure to comment below and
let us know who you think is

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.150
taking home the mirror
ball trophy.

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:29.990
I'm betting on Urkel.

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.300
Speaking of Dancing With the
Stars, Wendy Williams competed

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:34.410
on Season 12.

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:36.220
Sadly, she didn't make
it that far and was

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:37.790
eliminated week two.

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.350
Dance Moms dictator Abby Lee
Miller stopped by the Wendy

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.120
Show and Abby decided to show
Wendy just where she went

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.355
wrong the ballroom.

00:01:44.355 --> 00:01:49.370
-Five, six, seven, eight and
knee, knee, knee, step back,

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:52.310
body, body, body, and
[INAUDIBLE] and over

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.740
and over and over.

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.790
ALLISON HOLKER: I wonder if Tony
Dovolani wished he would

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.100
have brought a pink baseball
to their rehearsals.

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.980

Miller for you, click here and

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:07.078
check Todrick's recap of
this week's Dance Moms.

00:02:07.078 --> 00:02:09.639
ALLISON HOLKER: The 84th Academy
Awards took place this

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:12.240
weekend and I want to say
congratulations to The Artist

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.070
for taking home five Oscars.

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.590
Now let's see what Qaadir
thought of the ceremony.

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:17.740
QAADIR: I love Billy Crystal.

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.520
He was amazing.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.890
He really showed us why
there was so much

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:22.980
hype around his hosting.

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.285
Because he just stepped right in
there like the pro that he

00:02:25.285 --> 00:02:26.780
is and just completely knocked
it out of the park.

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.990
Octavia Spencer, she completely
blew her speech.

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:32.830
I love-- when it comes to doing
Oscar speeches, I feel

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:33.510
like there's a mixture.

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.555
There needs to be a certain
amount of emotion and a

00:02:35.555 --> 00:02:36.870
certain amount of composure.

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:37.540
Say something meaningful.

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.360
Because you never know when
you're going to be on that

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.520
stage and get the opportunity
to do that again.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:42.820
Moving on from that.

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:44.480
The Cirque performance
with the dancers.

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.965
One thing when I see dancers,
especially that level of

00:02:46.965 --> 00:02:50.760
dancing, it's amazing
to me the amount of

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.320
focus you have to have.

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:53.590
They make it look easy.

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.174
That's the thing about
dancing, they

00:02:55.174 --> 00:02:55.470
make it look easy.

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.240
But just with the strength and
all that was going on, the

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:01.320
amount of concentration that
it must have demanded, for

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.140
them to be able to do things
that did, they were amazing.

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.710
ALLISON HOLKER: Underground
Dance Posse Kwanza Jones

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:10.350
released her new video, "Time
To Go." And if you're

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.370
unfamiliar, Kwanza Jones always
brings it with her club

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.750
beats, her crazy costumes
and her cool dancing.

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.266
And I got to sit down with her
for an exclusive interview.

00:03:20.266 --> 00:03:22.320
KWANZA JONES: "Time to Go"
is supposed to be this

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.120
futuristic, out of this
world fantasy.

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.180
ALLISON HOLKER: Your
fantasy is amazing.

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.778
The costumes are incredible
in the video.

00:03:28.778 --> 00:03:29.674
KWANZA JONES: Thank you.

00:03:29.674 --> 00:03:31.318
So you wouldn't see somebody
walking down

00:03:31.318 --> 00:03:31.790
the street that way?

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:32.670
ALLISON HOLKER: No,
not usually.

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.050
Unless Lady Gaga goes out every
day, I've never seen

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.890
something like it.

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:37.680
KWANZA JONES: OK, what I like to
do with any choreographers

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.510
I work with is just-- they're
creatives as well too, they're

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:42.780
artists as well too.

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.440
So it's this merging of my
vision with their vision and

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.760
trying to have this one--

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.370
just make it something special,
something unique.

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:51.840
ALLISON HOLKER: Kwanza, thank
you so much again for coming

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:52.630
to meet with us.

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.050
And make sure to check out
her video, "Time to Go."

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:57.330
As some of you may know, I
auditioned for So You Think

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.830
You Can Dance, here in
LA on Season Two.

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:01.570
And I made it as far
as the top eight.

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:04.100
Now that was my big break
into the dance world.

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:05.800
So make sure you don't
miss your chance.

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.760
Tomorrow, March 2 at the Orpheum
Theatre to audition

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:09.530
for the show.

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:11.920
Footloose will be out on
Blu-ray and DVD this

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.180
Tuesday, March 6.

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.300
And if you missed our last
episode, Just Dance will be

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.329
giving away free copies of
the Footloose combo pack,

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:20.709
including one signed

how to enter.

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:26.370
Universal is in pre-production
for a live-action musical

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.370
adaptation of Le Miz and the
cast is star-studded.

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:33.510
So far the cast includes Hugh
Jackman, Anne Hathaway,

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:36.590
Russell Crowe, Sacha
Baron-Cohen, Helena Bonham

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:41.130
Carter, Eddie Redmayne, Aaron
Tveit, and Amanda Seyfried.

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:43.940
After tons of news that Taylor
Swift would be portraying the

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.990
coveted role of Eponine, it was
announced that UK stage

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.170
actress Samantha Barks
was cast for the

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:50.490
vocally demanding role.

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.990
It's rumored to start filming
this month in hopes for a

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:54.120
December release.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.920
No choreographer has been
announced yet, but we can't

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.310
wait to see le moves
in Le Miz.

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:02.190
On Smash, Ivy Lynn pulls a diva
when she feels threatened

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.660
by Karen Cartwright which gets
her kicked out of multiple

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:05.870
ensemble numbers.

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:09.400
Plus a special appearance from
Nick Jonas made this episode

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:10.240
packed heat.

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:14.400
Click here for the skinny
on Smash from Luan.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.510
Justin Bieber, Selena Gomez, and
a lot of fake moustaches

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:20.270
are all over the unofficial
video for Carly Rae Jepsen's

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:23.230
song, "Call Me Maybe." If that's
not enough star power

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:25.880
for you, Ashley Tisdale
is in there as well.

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.600
The video had plenty of
popping, locking and

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:29.010
lip-syncing.

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:31.200
And I think I even saw a
conga line in there.

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:34.420
The NBA All-star game tapped
major recording artists for

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:35.340
the telecast.

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:37.952
First up, Pitbull with "Crazy,"
who was then joined

00:05:37.952 --> 00:05:41.240
by Chris Brown for their jam,
"International Love." But it

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.022
wouldn't have been complete
without a stage full of

00:05:43.022 --> 00:05:43.810
dancing women.

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:46.752
Then Chris Brown went solo for
his new single, "Turn up the

00:05:46.752 --> 00:05:50.580
Music," before being joined by
Neo and even more dancers for

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:51.110
"Everything Tonight."

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:53.890
Nicky Minaj also performed at
the All-star game and it was

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:56.220
her first live show after
the controversial Grammy

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:57.180
Performance.

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:59.650
The stage was full of dancers
for "Moment 4 Life,"

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:05.340
"Starships," and "Super
Bass." [SINGING]

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:07.130
I had so much fun here
with you guys today,

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:08.520
