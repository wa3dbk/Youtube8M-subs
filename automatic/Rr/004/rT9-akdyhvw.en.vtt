00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.280
 hello and did you get it again 

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:06.740
 with another video about it 

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:08.269
 commercials online so I would like to 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.830
 a little look at the weather 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:13.010
 system or even the new one 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:15.019
 champion system throw the veteran rings 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:16.219
 how to scroll online in this scrolls 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:17.960
 reaching the maximum level 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:19.039
 we have to climb many players 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.230
 a reason for criticism 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:22.850
 once you arrive at your 1 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.930
 makes you feel like you are against one 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:26.090
 wall would run 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:28.550
 before everything was relatively easy and 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:30.470
 even though rank one increases 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.839
 the level of difficulty is massive and one 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.550
 Alone was clearly difficult although 

00:00:32.839 --> 00:00:35.929
 You can also increase the difficulty 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.639
 as a challenge 

00:00:35.929 --> 00:00:39.559
 but for many players it was simple 

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:41.329
 and become too heavy 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:43.489
 they felt compelled to 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:44.959
 Leveling groups and compulsion is something 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:46.969
 what you play in a game and really 

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:48.379
 not wanting to see that seemingly 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:49.819
 so are the developers 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:52.010
 Veteran system will be complete 

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:53.959
 turned over the whole runs in three 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.850
 phase in phase one were the 

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:57.469
 Veteran content weakened so that 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.029
 each one alone in a position 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:00.529
 she was to be mastered 

00:00:59.029 --> 00:01:02.449
 this phase is already completed 

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:05.000
 and just wanted to start in early july 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:06.859
 implemented in phase 2 will be the 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.509
 Veteran points removed from the game 

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:10.310
 and you level it completely normal 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:12.500
 points of experience and also a high one 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.600
 Bonus if you want to continue even if 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.329
 it will continue to be close to veterans 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.219
 you reach in the third and 

00:01:17.329 --> 00:01:20.990
 last phase will be a complete 

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:22.399
 new system introduced at the 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.530
 mainly for further adjustment 

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:26.570
 development of your character 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.070
 the whole is called then champions 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.170
 system and works like that 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.810
 alternative climbs from prospective students 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.979
 cause 2 or even age of conan so far 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.140
 you have gained enough points of experience 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:38.060
 you will receive a champion point 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.499
 you can then in different 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.060
 invest passive bonuses 

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:42.649
 Here, the developers are attacking the 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.840
 on skyrim known system of 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:46.429
 star constellation back so you can 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.200
 in the future his points in things like 

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:50.479
 sound expert for more weapon damage 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.719
 with the sound of weapons or toughness 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:54.890
 for your endurance regeneration stuck 

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:56.749
 interesting is that the champion 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.759
 apply to your entire account 

00:01:56.749 --> 00:02:00.889
 but they are individual for each character 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:02.749
 others could be distributed 

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:04.700
 There are also more green games 

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:07.759
 if you have more points in a starry world 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.649
 sitting so you can, for example, invested at 10 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:11.360
 Score the bonus impatience free 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.250
 Switching determines a big bonus 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.379
 get cracked on lock gets granted 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.930
 There is also such a step up 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:20.390
 for example for 30 50 and even 100 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.189
 invested points in a tree in the 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.720
 the conversion to the champions system 

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:26.150
 will also be the armor and weapons 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.709
 Requirements are not adjusted 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.819
 longer tied to the veteran rings 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:30.920
 but on 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:32.750
 She sets the items of each 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.290
 current season relatively difficult too 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.480
 to get 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.159
 but the older the seven the easier 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.349
 it will get you things 

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:40.340
 and with that I am already at the end of the day 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:41.690
 this video 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.609
 I would like to be here, though 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.230
 predict that in the next few days 

00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:47.150
 also more videos about these 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.069
 will give because there was on the quake con 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.480
 some news I more 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:52.489
 interesting hiking and therefore with them 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.720
 you want to share but you can me 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:55.099
 In any case , ever in the children 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.230
 what do you think about that? 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:58.629
 veteran now no longer exists but 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.319
 soon to be champions with the 

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:02.720
 star constellations from skyrim 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:05.319
 otherwise thanks for watching and until 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.319
 next time
