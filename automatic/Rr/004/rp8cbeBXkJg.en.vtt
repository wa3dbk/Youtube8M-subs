00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:16.060 

instruction<00:04:09.470> manual<00:04:11.860> your<00:04:12.880> software<00:04:14.680> and<00:04:15.680> in

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
instruction manual your software and in

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.190 
instruction manual your software and in
here<00:04:16.450> you<00:04:17.450> have<00:04:17.540> this<00:04:17.660> little<00:04:17.720> thing<00:04:17.959> that

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:18.200 
here you have this little thing that

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:19.660 
here you have this little thing that
usually<00:04:18.350> comes<00:04:18.739> on<00:04:18.890> the<00:04:19.010> camera<00:04:19.280> but<00:04:19.430> I<00:04:19.459> guess

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:19.670 
usually comes on the camera but I guess

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:25.360 
usually comes on the camera but I guess
it'd<00:04:19.790> been<00:04:20.260> some<00:04:21.260> cords<00:04:23.080> more<00:04:24.080> USB<00:04:24.920> and<00:04:25.220> then

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
it'd been some cords more USB and then

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.560 
it'd been some cords more USB and then
this<00:04:25.580> is<00:04:25.730> the<00:04:25.850> charger<00:04:26.270> which<00:04:26.450> is<00:04:26.480> pretty<00:04:27.140> big

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:28.570 
this is the charger which is pretty big

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:32.620 
this is the charger which is pretty big
that's<00:04:29.570> nice<00:04:30.280> yeah<00:04:31.280> and<00:04:31.940> the<00:04:32.120> reason<00:04:32.240> I<00:04:32.450> went

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:32.630 
that's nice yeah and the reason I went

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:34.810 
that's nice yeah and the reason I went
with<00:04:32.720> point-and-shoot<00:04:33.350> is<00:04:33.470> because<00:04:33.830> it<00:04:34.670> was

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.820 
with point-and-shoot is because it was

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.500 
with point-and-shoot is because it was
less<00:04:34.970> money<00:04:35.330> but<00:04:35.800> second<00:04:36.800> of<00:04:36.860> all<00:04:37.010> I<00:04:37.070> was<00:04:37.510> more

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510 
less money but second of all I was more

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:44.470 
less money but second of all I was more
portable<00:04:39.580> which<00:04:40.580> is<00:04:40.820> really<00:04:41.450> good<00:04:43.150> as<00:04:44.150> you<00:04:44.270> can
