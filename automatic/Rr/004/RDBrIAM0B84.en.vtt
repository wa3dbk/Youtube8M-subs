00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:53.300 
trying to think maybe a multitude you

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.839 
trying to think maybe a multitude you
could<00:05:53.479> say<00:05:53.659> that<00:05:53.870> too<00:05:54.110> ah<00:05:54.580> what<00:05:55.580> if<00:05:55.699> we<00:05:55.820> just

00:05:55.839 --> 00:05:55.849 
could say that too ah what if we just

00:05:55.849 --> 00:05:58.240 
could say that too ah what if we just
storm<00:05:56.630> the<00:05:56.719> gates<00:05:57.020> is<00:05:57.710> that<00:05:57.830> another<00:05:58.130> question

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:58.250 
storm the gates is that another question

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:00.010 
storm the gates is that another question
it's<00:05:58.789> not<00:05:58.940> out<00:05:59.120> of<00:05:59.150> the<00:05:59.240> question<00:05:59.419> but<00:05:59.750> I<00:05:59.810> think

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:00.020 
it's not out of the question but I think

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:01.029 
it's not out of the question but I think
we<00:06:00.110> should<00:06:00.259> come<00:06:00.440> up<00:06:00.469> with<00:06:00.680> something<00:06:00.979> a

00:06:01.029 --> 00:06:01.039 
we should come up with something a

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:02.760 
we should come up with something a
little<00:06:01.159> bit<00:06:01.370> more<00:06:01.400> we<00:06:01.699> could<00:06:01.820> rush<00:06:02.090> the<00:06:02.270> gates

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:02.770 
little bit more we could rush the gates

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:06.550 
little bit more we could rush the gates
