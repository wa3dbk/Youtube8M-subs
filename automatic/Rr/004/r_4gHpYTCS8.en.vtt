00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 Hello everyone and everyone welcome to the 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.049
 channel today talking about the topic of 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.760
 the localized fat I received about 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.849
 how many emails asking me 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.559
 specific exercises to eliminate 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:17.990
 fat of the abdominal area of ​​the 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:20.640
 butt belts and I want 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.170
 take this video to show you the 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.390
 treatment that I am carrying out 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.240
 but I also wanted to do a few 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.150
 clarifications before telling you what to lose 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.070
 fat of a particular area of the body 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.579
 it is not possible to say when we 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.270
 we make a diet low in calories and 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:39.300
 we carry out an exercise 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.399
 cardiovascular on a regular basis we are going to 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.140
 lose fat but we're going to lose fat 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.420
 of the whole body in general is to say the 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.850
 body does not understand areas does not work 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:52.420
 nothing to say i want to do 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:54.839
 a lot of sit-ups to stand out and 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:57.370
 define abdomen to see let's tone up 

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:59.199
 the entire abdominal area but until not 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.329
 let's remove the layer of fat because it's not going to 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:04.689
 serve you because you are not going to see us 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:06.899
 so then doing that alone 

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:09.190
 abdominals will not do us any good 

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:12.729
 because it is also that the abdominals 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:14.979
 from the exercises that it is not 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:19.659
 of which more calories make us burn 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:21.399
 doing sit-ups the same goes for 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:23.800
 the challenges that I now by internet that 

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:27.009
 I see the challenge of the 100 cents dlas and things 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:29.050
 so I do not really agree with this 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:31.300
 kind of challenges because we are working 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:33.310
 every day the same muscle we are 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.409
 about training this muscle at the end 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.909
 neither tonify it nor anything what we are going to 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:40.330
 to do is lose the muscle we are going to 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:41.740
 burn and that and lose fat from that area 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:45.659
 specifically only to Squats 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:48.240
 well, it's not worth 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.250
 Now we can do 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:54.090
 something when we are a little 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.920
 stagnant and that there are areas that is that 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.420
 they are especially conflicting and where 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.399
 the fat because it costs a lot to be 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.870
 go in the case of women the area 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:05.870
 of the holsters is pretty 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:08.360
 frequent that it costs us to be 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:10.930
 let us go before you asked me to leave 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.280
 comments because I want to lose fat 

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:16.940
 that I'm very thin or what makes me 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.530
 It needs a good make clear that I am seen 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.000
 preparing to compete in the 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.930
 bikini category within the world of 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.340
 fitness and it's good that it's true that 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.080
 I have a percentage of the expense 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.420
 low but that facing competitions 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.770
 they say a pretty fat percentage 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:36.000
 smaller than I have 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:37.200
 I'm delighted with the percentage of 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.830
 fat that I have right now is to say 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.300
 aesthetically no I do not look bad is more 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.670
 the areas where it is seems to me even 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.590
 it's interesting that grease is there 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.950
 not but facing a competition 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.990
 is my criteria and right now my eyes is 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.730
 my coach to that is where I 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:56.220
 says that here we have to remove here 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.110
 we have to put ourselves once the 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.600
 competition then I'll go back to my 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:03.360
 percentage of normal spending and point but 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:05.130
 this the three creams that I'm 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.200
 using me they serve me to 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:09.720
 prepare to compete but to another 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.510
 people can come to you well to finish 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.610
 of removing localized fat to be seen 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.340
 better that area so nothing happens to you 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:19.770
 teach that one of them is in 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.400
 house that is a treatment 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:25.080
 anti-cellulite and fat reducer 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.810
 thanks to its enzymatic action also 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.390
 reaffirms the skin 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:31.280
 and how not to say is that I am 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:36.349
 mixing with two creams that are the 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:39.370
 thrombus cit strong and the both strong 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:40.959
 these two creams 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.000
 what they do is activate circulation 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:44.950
 blood are ointments that are 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.989
 Indicated for varicose veins tired legs 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.780
 when we have a bruise so that it 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:53.140
 go before combining these two creams 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:56.500
 with the fat reducing treatment what 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:04:00.519
 What we do is enhance the loss of 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:02.860
 fat of this xi and enhance the loss 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:05.349
 of fat since by activating circulation 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:07.190
 Well, the treatment is much more 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:09.350
 cash 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:10.910
 if you look on the internet you will see what is 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:13.760
 quite known above all to mix 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:16.519
 thrombosis and has a character in this 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.739
 I have been recommended to these two 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:22.190
 with last encaste I put a portion of 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:25.250
 Thymus encaste in the hand and then half 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:27.650
 of this portion of tantum and the other 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.750
 half of thrombosis I mix everything well 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:31.490
 in the hand and applied it alone 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.230
 specifically in the area 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:35.240
 indicated then in my case a little bit in 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:39.440
 the abdominal area and in the area of 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:42.320
 cartridge belts and a little bit in the area that 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:44.480
 there's between the gluteus and the femoral there 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:47.420
 this part that is difficult and complicated 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:49.670
 work it and 

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:51.980
 and nothing else applied at night with the 

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:53.930
 Clean and dry skin massage is 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:55.940
 I already explained it to you in the 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:59.000
 routine to fight cellulite 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:01.670
 down up in pressure movements 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:05.360
 as if it were a roller massaging well 

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:06.990
 to activate circulation and nothing else 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:09.000
 what 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:12.120
 to good in terms of price that is to say 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:16.620
 I want to see that this one has fallen on me 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:19.569
 last one that cost me 34 50 and the 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:24.399
 two others we have three heart 

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:27.189
 the both 590 and the thrombus cit strong 760 

00:05:24.399 --> 00:05:30.429
 In other words, everything went to me for 48 

00:05:27.189 --> 00:05:33.699
 euros and well then this tell you that here 

00:05:30.429 --> 00:05:36.520
 come 202 milliliters and the pruning comes 

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:38.740
 60 in each one, that is, we have a 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:41.510
 final are 48 euros but good is that there 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:43.820
 anti-cellulite treatments also 

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:45.710
 for that price and they come to the best 

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:47.760
 200 milliliters and with this we have 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:51.500
 quite more quantity 

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:53.820
 what else if you want to see results 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:55.680
 nothing I'm uploading every week 

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:57.840
 to twitter instagram 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:00.090
 a photo is the same photo that I send to 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:01.770
 my preparer so to go see the 

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:03.900
 progress towards competition well 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:06.930
 if you want to see if it works then nothing 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:09.750
 you just have to take a look and that 

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:12.690
 each one as this see if he was losing 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:14.730
 more things and I'm losing more less what 

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:16.380
 I say because when you read opinions 

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:19.650
 online that this treatment that's 

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:21.240
 quite well known on the internet because 

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:22.650
 people say that it works for me and 

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:24.480
 such but good is that this is very 

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:26.490
 subjective then this better to see it 

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:27.729
 week to week 

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:29.650
 i 

00:06:27.729 --> 00:06:31.029
 and nothing but I hope that the video is 

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:34.469
 already the useful video we see the 

00:06:31.029 --> 00:06:34.469
 next a little kiss chao
