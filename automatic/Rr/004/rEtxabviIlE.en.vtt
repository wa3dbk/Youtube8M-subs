00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.170
 outside to see if you are the one 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.589
 tutorial and in this video shows you 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:11.280
 So how can you do that? 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:14.250
 Duke Riva also keeps you talking 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.410
 can and it said you have 30 short 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.930
 with the tumor on shelves get money 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.189
 but it was never the same with me 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.500
 everyone was told 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.199
 that's why I just have a few more 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.210
 Auxiliary is made from round eight to 111 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.189
 The only thing left was here 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.140
 tomorrow applies 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:35.640
 and I can tell you, too 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:38.100
 as I do so 50-60 kills so come 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.050
 which you are so two three dogs and 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.180
 if that's what they did normally 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.110
 noise for me it was not so and 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.510
 I can not random them so 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.570
 I show there again rear wear 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.340
 come on ran but only if 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.860
 you did it then you go here 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:56.820
 back to extras and throw yours 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:59.190
 tomorrow in this situation and one is 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.199
 there's a leak in there and nothing more 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.809
 come back you see it right down there 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.189
 I'm plunging all the time but I can 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.530
 then do not normally use is a 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.780
 moment 100 shows the theme completely 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.000
 normal is now I'm still waiting fast 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.030
 on my three zombies because you have to 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.980
 just start the next wonder 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:23.300
 so 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:25.280
 1 and 2 down so wonderful without 12 and there 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:28.550
 the tomahawk or would he also said 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:31.250
 the bright blue and the gate 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:34.160
 that's why you have to go now 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.350
 just kill yourself 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:39.800
 So something electro box or kill 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:41.210
 So clean and then we just go 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.770
 there and then you can already the 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.270
 neck with the record 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.910
 and i can tell you the weapon is 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:50.690
 really epic for heinz so this one 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:52.370
 hit 50 to 140 what it is so good 50 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.550
 I came up now I do it 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:58.250
 again on the weekend a bit out 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:59.780
 but such a nutritional video for the 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.030
 Tomahawks I'll do one more 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.370
 separate and is not the first 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:07.100
 had time on this blue lighthouse 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:08.830
 and now it's all in the basket and there 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.660
 I just did it that way 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:14.720
 that sound should be 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:18.230
 always come when you are the definite 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:21.230
 number of kills here stop money with the 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.730
 With me, that's how it came about 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.520
 but not 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:28.160
 and we made it to 560 kills 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.360
 Both have done and then we are 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.690
 just gone over it 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.190
 toborg thrown in and both still in it 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.980
 if it was not made by the team 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.600
 go in and then come back then 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.150
 It may be that he has too few skills 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:45.860
 had and just a few more merkels 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:48.650
 also golden gate bridge one must yes then 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:51.500
 normal to start dogs again 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.910
 So the next one 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.450
 and then it is again the 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:59.610
 blue then just go back afloat 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:02.130
 and the whole thing I pick up 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.290
 can only say if you go to heinz 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.920
 I can definitely do this here 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.760
 recommend 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.740
 that's really strong as I said 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.440
 would be a separate video again 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:18.530
 Do what the Duke ever did 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:20.610
 rather suit and how is thus the 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.590
 you can cradle behavior 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.520
 yes the red gate can be alzheimer's 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.650
 charge 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.210
 So you have to hold down and that 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.190
 Blue can be charged three times 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:32.460
 I do not know if it's the strength 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:35.040
 Should it be changed for the longer 

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:36.450
 I could hold the blue and test 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.910
 because it always always recharge the first time 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:42.060
 even when did and has power at the bottom had 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:46.140
 I did not try because I have anyway 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:49.080
 thought that it was rather weak and how 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:51.180
 In any case, very money is said for 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:54.890
 marriage and something on paper and man 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.890
 looks like we are in the next video
