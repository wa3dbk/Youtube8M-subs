00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:11.280
 in short, hello everyone, my name is Alexey 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:16.500
 videos on youtube about painting like what 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:21.930
 do a lot but when I started 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:24.390
 here and took the garage to hell I have a question 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.810
 and it arose how to equip with 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:34.140
 minimum investment for a garage for 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:39.059
 car painting here is short 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:41.020
 video will tell what sex 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:46.000
 than for me 1 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:48.079
 just take off my garage here I think 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.239
 this is the minimum 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:52.660
 to give birth which is necessary for painting 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:58.300
 Here I have 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:01:01.239
 width 420 ends with two meters and 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:05.820
 I think this is the very minimum 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:09.520
 should be so immediately I ran into 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:12.790
 such a question of lighting in the garage so I 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:16.990
 myself made such coverage as it were 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:20.830
 I think itâ€™s quite enough 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:23.280
 but of course there is if there is extra finance 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:27.060
 where you can do more 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:30.970
 especially to shine on the roof of the card 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:33.660
 I bought myself a location 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:37.600
 construction awning fitted 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:42.490
 the roof because with her a lot of sawdust 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:45.880
 filed m 6 by 8 I gave for him but in 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:51.090
 around 45 dollars well and my own 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:53.950
 forces naksan new year wall 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:57.670
 when you look like that such walls 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:02:01.539
 there arises the question of how you can 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:05.800
 paint a normal car in such 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:09.179
 conditions you can I myself ofigel when 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:12.640
 I painted the dust I had well 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:15.190
 the minimum number of car will 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.640
 polish but dust minimum the most 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.180
 was sitting 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.690
 the walls I worked building bruce 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.200
 this 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:25.750
 building ground so he 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.489
 at least here these bits and pieces in 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:31.450
 no bricks flied 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:34.440
 well to have landed with time and and 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:41.640
 I 'll be a warrior painting everything washes away 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:41.640
 I pour water over it 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:50.720
 Besides 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:53.570
 here is my center as it is called me 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:56.390
 in modo on pneumatic scenes track 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:03:01.280
 In general, the thing is more convenient for me 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:03.230
 than an electric tool because 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.580
 you see that it is small and compact 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:11.210
 This is my matrix in the center of his move 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:13.010
 two and a half here but a call to 

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:17.900
 so what officer do you use 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:20.090
 Naturally there must be a very compressor 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:23.810
 good I'll show you right now we will go down 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:27.710
 the basement as I have here at the compressor 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:30.950
 I have a 100 meter receiver and 

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:37.760
 3 cylinder afternoon out there something 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:40.580
 It turns out around 600 liters 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:45.260
 primer cool bomber and pistol 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:49.040
 I took seconds for 18 dollars 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:52.570
 seconds well for priming quite quite 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.570
 and quite fit 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.580
 Well, of course I have a computer here, but 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:00.650
 anything should be a computer either 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:02.660
 radio because working in silence 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.910
 knit unbearably 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:13.340
 then it would last no more 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:16.489
 three because the roof is not right here I 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:20.750
 I will not explain something to buy from 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:23.870
 materials after this thing napkin need 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:24.680
 anyway materials this is already yours 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:33.950
 discretion 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:36.110
 you will already be prompted by other videos 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:44.380
 as for the compressor here 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:44.380
 compressor 3 cylinder receiver 100 liters 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:52.360
 cheap oil oil separator such 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:58.000
 for $ 20 but as it is not good 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:05:01.150
 the spray gun doesn't go at all 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:05.950
 I bought the hose it is good 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:09.940
 A 15-meter hose za'tar bullets at me 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:14.570
 devilbiss g pro lite 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:18.370
 scalp e10 minimum paint consumption 

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:23.690
 and for garage conditions are suitable as 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:32.620
 minimum air flow in 14 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:32.620
 I told them and I put or render, and the base and varnish here 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:40.770
 here's a hose I'm blue good hose 15 

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:43.340
 meters but me so I could not air 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:46.590
 cars dance evidence like 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:49.970
 I have a baker so this was 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:54.949
 I did not turn on the receiver 

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:57.810
 Questions are they bundled with a compressor 

00:05:54.949 --> 00:06:01.319
 I have a 380 volt compressor 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:04.620
 in my garage there was a rosette 380 

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:08.669
 already done and my friend specialist 

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:11.759
 on mounting it all made light and spent 

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:14.849
 another 380 there compressor compressor 

00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:18.509
 why did i put the compressor in the basement and 

00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:21.990
 because this is it 

00:06:18.509 --> 00:06:25.319
 if he stood there she would quickly get bored 

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:29.430
 will be a headache so he is there for me 

00:06:25.319 --> 00:06:34.050
 tract 1 almost never hear this 

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:36.180
 still wanted to say from the fact that 

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:39.210
 compressor in my basement but there 

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:42.349
 humidity of course i am after work 

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:45.509
 Krainik open all the air and descends 

00:06:42.349 --> 00:06:46.909
 some water flies out and every day I 

00:06:45.509 --> 00:06:49.949
 starting 

00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:54.030
 turning on the compressor too pumping 

00:06:49.949 --> 00:06:57.990
 air it and for the compressor the best for 

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:59.210
 we are better for painters because moisture 

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:03.270
 didn't wake up 

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:08.100
 Well, as if all other questions if 

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:10.520
 someone will be interested I will answer 

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:10.520
 fireplace
