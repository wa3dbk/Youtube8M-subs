00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.480
 watson champ is to burn him and with a 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.430
 new video and good kids after so much 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.200
 time without bringing a commented gameplay 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:17.700
 to the channel so good this time I am 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.760
 here again to tell you a 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:22.260
 authentic game and good these three 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.880
 asking good you have already seen by the 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.439
 title what is what you have in the background and 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.989
 is nothing more and nothing less kids than 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:31.349
 a nuclear triple with the vector playing 

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:33.060
 in extreme domain root map and good 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.250
 for those who arrive with support is 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.320
 very very easy if I encourage you to 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.630
 you put and I tried to remove you not 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.890
 because it's not easy to play extreme 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:43.590
 well this I will treat it a little more 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.240
 forward and good what I first wanted 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.460
 comment on this always is that if I 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.960
 you notice a little the funny voice is that I'm 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.510
 sick that's why he has not brought many 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.430
 comments lately to the channel and 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.500
 It is not that there is not enough time 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.470
 to be commenting every day 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.329
 something for the channel no and well then if not 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:02.820
 you have a bit of a bad voice that's why and 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.920
 good as far as what I said of 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.470
 play extreme kids 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.720
 if you kill a bullet that I 'm going to 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.090
 deny but the enemies to nothing and that the 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.680
 feet a bit spiteful you can come 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.810
 and burst and is also a guarantee 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.149
 it's something I want you to take into account 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.040
 and good as you see when I play 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:23.979
 extreme I love to swell to get me out of 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.539
 low strings my four hits and good 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:27.759
 Well, it does not stop me bloating and good as 

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:29.470
 you have already been the first nuclear 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:31.750
 they are cut so the first one started 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.520
 of the ruthless if they did not become very long 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.289
 temper and not because the first race is the 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.299
 you usually always cost a bit more 

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:39.250
 and good and from here the second the 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:41.679
 I start with a fourth long row fit 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:44.319
 of 5 and well a triple here 

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:45.970
 triple over there not and it's an authentic 

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:47.200
 swollen that I loved this game is 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.729
 the first game of put the vÃ­ctor 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.340
 that's why the vice without camouflage 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:53.560
 because I did not have time to get 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.390
 camouflage in the previous room and well then 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.369
 he wanted to thank the support team 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.780
 of the piece of his because he made me not me 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:02.430
 agreement of exactly two names but 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:04.230
 I know my friend was and rock what I know 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.540
 a piece of kid that always helps me 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:07.860
 in all its games and well to 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.600
 all the subjects that I was participating 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.400
 in thank you very much because good these 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.460
 gameplays and without them kids never 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.050
 would be possible not because holding there 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:17.640
 the panas and helping me get these 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.910
 starting places we take out in the bones 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.100
 also like that and well I also wanted 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.570
 comment good here is ending of 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.610
 the round of the first round of dominance 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:29.820
 which is when in extreme domain something 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.500
 that in Spain does not have anyone triples 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:33.720
 nor in normal domain nor in 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:37.820
 domains we have except deranged and 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:39.959
 I doom spain partner and well 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:41.459
 It has much merit to take you out one always 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:43.920
 nuclear domain and good here you go to 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:45.450
 it is the bench of the game 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.250
 Now when I 'm going to kill one of the 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.780
 eyes that the gun was not loaded and then 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.489
 And I shit and then I 'm starting to do 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.870
 bullets and got good finishes 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:53.970
 round since I've got you a cut up 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.110
 that the next one begins and already begins to 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.150
 kill ya and bumper 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.410
 and good the auto thing that we already commented 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.840
 of the channel is that as we have commented 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:05.470
 We have been climbing the road 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:07.150
 had the role of the street head in live and 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.460
 Well, we have already mentioned it a long time ago 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.590
 that many would not return would not know and if it is 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:13.360
 that the first three chapters of the 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.220
 racquetball audio is recorded with the 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.110
 laptop microphone or listen 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.580
 very good with the microphone and now to 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.960
 from now on the sacred already well with 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:23.110
 the microphone but he told me 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:24.580
 people who'm twice and so well that 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:26.980
 it's because I had the volume of late 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.320
 too high and good as it got off 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.400
 of the helmets that I have not said either 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.680
 had to have a little bit high for 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.810
 find out when they shoot me and everything 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.489
 Not that and well, well that you have it 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.200
 into account but not like this is a current term 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:40.750
 that I liked a lot and I 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.970
 He loves to pay the last chapter and 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:45.670
 After that, I'll try to bring you 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.410
 some nuclear with which g gold or 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.750
 of diamond and who knows that my account 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.710
 I do not know how much longer I will have left 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.420
 take out a diamond 

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:55.280
 and well , you see, I'm already on the 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.320
 third nuclear and in this nuclear I 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.240
 something happened that I do not know I did not realize 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.070
 neither me and I was left without ammunition 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:02.180
 kids in the victory is when everything 

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:04.580
 what to say to a kid who is 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:06.230
 making support that is pulled me help me 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:08.140
 because I was without ammunition and I did not have 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:11.440
 fucking idea do not 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:13.150
 and well that already commented and then 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.700
 Well I hope you liked the 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:17.680
 gameplay that this weekend we are going to 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:20.230
 try to have a couple of comments on 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.000
 important vinillo is for the channel and 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:24.370
 Well, here I am without ammunition and 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.960
 I tell the kid to help me and good 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:29.500
 since I have here a couple of minutes 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:31.780
 I still wanted to tell you guys about the 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:33.850
 road to walk the little support that has 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.740
 received by writing me the channel 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:38.169
 I will usually have more than a thousand 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:40.510
 safe visits in each video more or 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:43.060
 less a day and then now we do not arrive 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:44.560
 until 900 we arrived very scarcely 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.750
 in the last videos how did the 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.340
 ratio does not and that's why I already ask if 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:50.260
 really is enjoying the time 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:53.530
 because I do not know with the support that they are 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:55.600
 receiving and all that because I do not think 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.430
 which I'm looking very much so 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:59.830
 good if you want to continue butt 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:02.530
 the channel uploading videos practically 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:04.419
 newspapers , we would be grateful if you 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:06.610
 this video that we do about 200 likes 

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:09.870
 because they deserve a nuclear triple with 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:09.870
 a submachine gun as is the vector 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:15.329
 to finish the gameplay we have 

00:05:12.809 --> 00:05:17.039
 thought a couple of new series that 

00:05:15.329 --> 00:05:18.959
 we want to upload to our channel the 

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:21.479
 vinillo but good that I leave it for 

00:05:18.959 --> 00:05:23.579
 law camps tomorrow that Saturday I guess 

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:25.559
 that if he lets me render the computer 

00:05:23.579 --> 00:05:26.999
 the gameplays kids that already for 

00:05:25.559 --> 00:05:29.279
 finalize since I'm going to be the last 

00:05:26.999 --> 00:05:31.349
 nuclear my computer is not leaving me 

00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:33.179
 render the gameplays so there's 

00:05:31.349 --> 00:05:36.029
 times like yesterday he can not go up 

00:05:33.179 --> 00:05:37.469
 video and it's because they did not let me slide 

00:05:36.029 --> 00:05:40.139
 that is, when you can render it 

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:42.089
 look for the computer render the black the 

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:44.819
 gameplay and well I can not do 

00:05:42.089 --> 00:05:46.979
 nothing more so that kids post it wide 

00:05:44.819 --> 00:05:49.139
 when I can start and keep 

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:51.599
 games I hope you show for your 

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:53.009
 support and if we can this weekend 

00:05:51.599 --> 00:05:55.860
 we are going to upload two important videos that 

00:05:53.009 --> 00:05:58.979
 has told me to try new topics about 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:01.049
 the channel because it's going to get changes very 

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:03.389
 important on your table 'pain kids 

00:06:01.049 --> 00:06:04.799
 and how often we will upload videos 

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:06.809
 but let's hope you're there 

00:06:04.799 --> 00:06:08.339

00:06:06.809 --> 00:06:09.749
 and good talks, thank you very much everyone 

00:06:08.339 --> 00:06:10.799
 those who are always there commenting on the 

00:06:09.749 --> 00:06:13.079
 day to day that we always read 

00:06:10.799 --> 00:06:14.459
 your comments and all that 

00:06:13.079 --> 00:06:15.840
 I wish that we add good here and 

00:06:14.459 --> 00:06:17.970
 will jump triple nuclear and magician 

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:19.620
 little bit unstoppable and good we 

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:21.330
 that you want to add us kids is that 

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:23.550
 we can no longer add more people 

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:25.650
 we are very heavy accounts but 

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:27.120
 well if someday we need the 

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:28.380
 people to play with us what 

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.729
 we say by twitter that as always 

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:31.590
 is in the description that a long time ago 

00:06:29.729 --> 00:06:33.780
 that we did not do that and well here comes 

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:35.130
 already when I have amateur with some 

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:36.570
 unstoppable that in every nuclear magician 

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:39.090
 enough unstoppable I do not know if I'll get to 

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:40.500
 total about 10 hits so good 

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:41.729
 surrenders the young enemies here 

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:43.680
 the game ends I hope you have 

00:06:41.729 --> 00:06:47.570
 liked like and favorites double say with 

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:47.570
 the allies and to play shovel kids
