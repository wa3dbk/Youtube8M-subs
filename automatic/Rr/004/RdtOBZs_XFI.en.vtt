00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:07.320 
1966 and that was probably an overhang

1966 and that was probably an overhang
right<00:05:07.620> here<00:05:07.980> but<00:05:08.160> as<00:05:08.340> you<00:05:08.370> can<00:05:08.520> see<00:05:10.130> it<00:05:11.130> was

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280 
right here but as you can see it was

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.760 
right here but as you can see it was
taken<00:05:11.610> off<00:05:11.700> probably<00:05:12.120> a<00:05:12.480> storm<00:05:13.170> or<00:05:13.410> something

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:13.770 
taken off probably a storm or something

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:17.180 
taken off probably a storm or something
and<00:05:13.920> then<00:05:14.010> it<00:05:14.070> just<00:05:14.310> took<00:05:14.460> up<00:05:14.640> took<00:05:14.910> it<00:05:15.030> off
