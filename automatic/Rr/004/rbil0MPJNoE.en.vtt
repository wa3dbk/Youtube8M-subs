00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.480
 I will 

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:16.129
 Well, it is the 61st of No. 61, which is a problem concerning the digestion and absorption of nutrition. What is wrong is a slave mother 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:20.750
 The most iconic inner surface is covered with villus and helps to increase the efficiency of nutrient absorption 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:23.470
 This is correct, in order to expand the surface area of ​​the ministry 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:28.840
 It is said that villus 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:31.530
 It's not keto ek but if something like q is covered 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:38.070
 This is correct 

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:42.030
 In the large intestine , in addition to water , absorption of salt grapes and vitamins is also performed. 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:46.310
 I though I almost moisture It is so mainly Yes 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.310
 These are also absorbed 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:53.739
 i is the third 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:56.170
 Vitamin b 1 b 2 b 6 b 12 potassium etc. are produced by intestinal bacteria 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:59.890
 Enteric bacteria 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:03.660
 We've done a very important work 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.660
 I produce these things 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.850
 40,000 is the Key screens such vitamins more enzyme 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:15.340
 Various 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:17.680
 It is broken down into chambers and absorbed into the blood from the intestinal wall 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:21.370
 This is wrong 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:23.320
 mt garden and vitamins in the first place 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:27.640
 Not disassembled 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:33.800
 It is already very easy to be absorbed 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:38.660
 Please be aware that you will be absorbed even if you do not work at all in the course 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:39.830
 Yes No. No absorption of nutrients takes place 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:43.210
 Ne 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:47.700
 Yes this is also true 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:53.700
 To be precise, this is a mistake 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:55.710
 Even if it is the day, but the number is small but the amount is small but Kyushu will be held 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:01.860
 However 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:06.900
 Towards the fourth This is number four apparently funny cat problem sediment 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:12.679
 Please choose as an option A little bit of a subtle issue, though 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:12.679
 Well let's make the 4th of the wrong answer the correct answer
