00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:06.839
 animals also hear plants you 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.360
 never believe what they hear too 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.900
 but why then came to the laboratory 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.900
 musicians 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:37.000
 in the cells of the living sheet constantly 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:40.559
 protoplasm moves and now serve and 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.559
 watch carefully 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:57.170
 incredible but to the sound of music 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:58.850
 protoplasm movement accelerates as 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:04.720
 the music is just starting to sound 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:04.720
 protoplasm again activated began 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.690
 so that 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.190
 started 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.110
 what 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:01.909
 so what actually the plant really 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:05.750
 differ sharply from animals if they 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:10.209
 move and feel react to the light and 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:14.050
 there is only one way to sound 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:14.050
 here by the way of eating
