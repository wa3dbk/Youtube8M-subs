00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
the the mini map you'll see that we

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.219 
the the mini map you'll see that we
actually<00:01:56.009> left<00:01:56.460> a<00:01:56.759> we<00:01:57.180> we<00:01:57.630> got<00:01:57.780> pretty<00:01:57.990> lucky

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
actually left a we we got pretty lucky

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.469 
actually left a we we got pretty lucky
that<00:01:58.409> they<00:01:58.649> didn't<00:01:58.860> spawn<00:01:59.040> there<00:01:59.340> and<00:02:00.329> that's

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
that they didn't spawn there and that's

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.389 
that they didn't spawn there and that's
one<00:02:00.659> thing<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:01.320> mini-map<00:02:01.710> up<00:02:02.009> in<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.189> top

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
one thing the mini-map up in the top

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:03.920 
one thing the mini-map up in the top
left<00:02:02.670> that's<00:02:02.909> like<00:02:03.090> one<00:02:03.570> of<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:03.719> biggest

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
left that's like one of the biggest

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.719

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
really important to look at the mini-map

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.830 
really important to look at the mini-map
and<00:02:20.459> also<00:02:21.459> on<00:02:21.670> this<00:02:21.790> map<00:02:21.970> is<00:02:22.000> really<00:02:22.450> important

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
and also on this map is really important

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.830 
and also on this map is really important
to<00:02:22.870> hold<00:02:23.410> top<00:02:23.709> control<00:02:24.300> top<00:02:25.300> controls<00:02:25.690> that

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
to hold top control top controls that

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
people by the flag and you get three or

people by the flag and you get three or
four<00:03:29.680> down<00:03:29.889> you<00:03:30.819> know<00:03:30.910> cuz<00:03:31.150> if<00:03:31.299> you're<00:03:31.480> on<00:03:31.660> it

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
four down you know cuz if you're on it

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.360 
four down you know cuz if you're on it
solo<00:03:32.200> then<00:03:32.560> you're<00:03:32.709> not<00:03:32.769> really<00:03:32.920> going<00:03:33.130> to<00:03:33.190> get

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:37.359 
the flag you know I'm on it by myself

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:39.270 
the flag you know I'm on it by myself
you<00:03:37.930> know<00:03:38.019> I<00:03:38.049> stun<00:03:38.319> a<00:03:38.349> couple<00:03:38.650> people<00:03:38.829> but<00:03:39.130> you

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
you know I stun a couple people but you

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.470 
you know I stun a couple people but you
know<00:03:39.340> right<00:03:39.549> now<00:03:39.700> is<00:03:39.849> getting<00:03:39.970> double<00:03:40.299> teams

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
know right now is getting double teams

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.000 
know right now is getting double teams
and<00:03:40.630> I<00:03:40.660> have<00:03:40.750> no<00:03:40.870> chance<00:03:41.169> you<00:03:41.829> know<00:03:41.859> I'm<00:03:41.950> not

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:43.199 
and I have no chance you know I'm not
going<00:03:42.250> to<00:03:42.310> be<00:03:42.370> able<00:03:42.400> to<00:03:42.579> take<00:03:42.700> both<00:03:42.880> those<00:03:43.060> guys

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.209 
going to be able to take both those guys

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:45.420 
going to be able to take both those guys
out<00:03:43.650> you<00:03:44.650> know<00:03:44.739> if<00:03:44.829> we<00:03:44.919> took<00:03:45.069> three<00:03:45.250> people

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
out you know if we took three people

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.039 
out you know if we took three people
down<00:03:45.730> and<00:03:45.970> we<00:03:46.030> had<00:03:46.180> two<00:03:46.329> people<00:03:46.660> on<00:03:46.720> the<00:03:46.750> flag

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:47.049 
down and we had two people on the flag

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:49.680 
down and we had two people on the flag
then<00:03:47.799> it<00:03:47.950> only<00:03:48.040> takes<00:03:48.370> like<00:03:48.459> three<00:03:49.269> seconds<00:03:49.599> to

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
then it only takes like three seconds to

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.289 
then it only takes like three seconds to
cap<00:03:49.870> the<00:03:49.989> flag<00:03:50.019> or<00:03:50.349> something<00:03:50.560> like<00:03:50.620> that<00:03:50.680> and

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
cap the flag or something like that and

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:53.909 
cap the flag or something like that and
I<00:03:52.299> MLG<00:03:52.989> domination<00:03:53.470> is<00:03:53.560> a<00:03:53.590> little<00:03:53.799> bit

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:53.919 
I MLG domination is a little bit

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:55.890 
I MLG domination is a little bit
different<00:03:54.430> than<00:03:54.609> like<00:03:55.030> regular<00:03:55.450> just<00:03:55.630> public

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
different than like regular just public

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.020 
different than like regular just public
match<00:03:56.049> domination<00:03:56.709> because<00:03:57.099> the<00:03:57.519> flag<00:03:57.760> timer

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
match domination because the flag timer

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.930 
match domination because the flag timer
to<00:03:58.930> cap<00:03:59.109> a<00:03:59.139> flag<00:03:59.440> it<00:03:59.590> only<00:03:59.709> takes<00:03:59.919> 7.5<00:04:00.519> seconds

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940 
to cap a flag it only takes 7.5 seconds

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.099 
to cap a flag it only takes 7.5 seconds
so<00:04:01.060> you<00:04:01.120> know<00:04:01.269> if<00:04:01.359> you<00:04:01.450> have<00:04:01.540> two<00:04:01.660> people<00:04:01.989> you

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:02.109 
so you know if you have two people you

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:05.729 
so you know if you have two people you
can<00:04:02.230> kappa<00:04:02.440> phi<00:04:02.680> relatively<00:04:03.310> quick<00:04:04.590> but<00:04:05.590> it's

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:05.739 
can kappa phi relatively quick but it's

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:07.650 
can kappa phi relatively quick but it's
still<00:04:05.919> only<00:04:06.099> a<00:04:06.250> good<00:04:06.639> idea<00:04:06.910> to<00:04:07.120> go<00:04:07.239> for<00:04:07.450> a<00:04:07.480> few

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 
still only a good idea to go for a few

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.300 
still only a good idea to go for a few
cap<00:04:07.870> if<00:04:08.109> you<00:04:08.260> you<00:04:08.590> know<00:04:08.650> if<00:04:08.739> you<00:04:08.829> have<00:04:08.980> three<00:04:09.190> or

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
cap if you you know if you have three or

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.240 
cap if you you know if you have three or
four<00:04:09.489> down<00:04:09.840> maybe<00:04:10.840> if<00:04:11.230> you<00:04:11.500> like<00:04:11.950> say<00:04:12.099> if<00:04:12.160> you

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
four down maybe if you like say if you

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:13.710 
four down maybe if you like say if you
only<00:04:12.370> have<00:04:12.519> one<00:04:12.669> flag<00:04:12.910> and<00:04:13.180> you're<00:04:13.269> going<00:04:13.419> for

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720 
only have one flag and you're going for

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.529 
only have one flag and you're going for
side<00:04:14.349> flag<00:04:14.620> or<00:04:14.859> B<00:04:15.069> then<00:04:15.880> maybe<00:04:16.180> if<00:04:16.359> you<00:04:16.450> have

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:16.539 
side flag or B then maybe if you have

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:18.629 
side flag or B then maybe if you have
two<00:04:16.750> down<00:04:16.959> or<00:04:17.229> maybe<00:04:17.380> even<00:04:17.470> one<00:04:17.799> down<00:04:18.010> and<00:04:18.519> you

00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:18.639 
two down or maybe even one down and you

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:19.170 
two down or maybe even one down and you
can<00:04:18.729> try<00:04:18.909> to<00:04:18.969> get

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
can try to get

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:20.310 
can try to get
that<00:04:19.359> flag<00:04:19.570> you<00:04:19.810> know<00:04:19.900> if<00:04:19.959> you<00:04:20.049> have<00:04:20.139> three

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
that flag you know if you have three

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.770 
that flag you know if you have three
people<00:04:20.650> on<00:04:20.769> it<00:04:20.949> you<00:04:21.880> see<00:04:22.030> we<00:04:22.150> have<00:04:22.240> four<00:04:22.479> people

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
people on it you see we have four people

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.930 
people on it you see we have four people
right<00:04:22.900> here<00:04:22.930> and<00:04:23.350> so<00:04:23.500> pretty<00:04:24.310> much<00:04:24.490> all<00:04:24.699> of<00:04:24.820> us

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:24.940 
right here and so pretty much all of us

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:26.490 
right here and so pretty much all of us
we<00:04:25.150> all<00:04:25.270> just<00:04:25.419> try<00:04:25.539> to<00:04:25.600> converse<00:04:25.960> to<00:04:26.169> the<00:04:26.259> flag

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
we all just try to converse to the flag

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.499 
we all just try to converse to the flag
and<00:04:26.710> get<00:04:26.830> on<00:04:26.949> it<00:04:27.130> I<00:04:27.310> know<00:04:28.000> they're<00:04:28.240> going<00:04:28.330> to<00:04:28.389> be

red building so I get a pre Nate kill

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.939 
red building so I get a pre Nate kill
it's<00:04:34.120> very<00:04:34.389> important<00:04:35.169> to<00:04:35.229> know<00:04:35.410> where<00:04:35.740> people

00:04:35.939 --> 00:04:35.949 
it's very important to know where people

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:37.800 
it's very important to know where people
are<00:04:36.100> going<00:04:36.220> to<00:04:36.310> spawn<00:04:36.550> it<00:04:36.729> there's<00:04:37.360> only<00:04:37.479> a<00:04:37.630> few

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810 
are going to spawn it there's only a few

and now that you know they really have
like<00:05:24.789> a<00:05:24.820> little<00:05:25.030> bit<00:05:25.240> of<00:05:25.330> control<00:05:25.570> the<00:05:25.750> map

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:25.930 
like a little bit of control the map

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:27.600 
like a little bit of control the map
because<00:05:26.080> I<00:05:26.320> you<00:05:26.710> know<00:05:26.800> they<00:05:26.889> have<00:05:27.039> top<00:05:27.250> control

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:27.610 
because I you know they have top control

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:29.790 
because I you know they have top control
and<00:05:27.760> they<00:05:27.820> have<00:05:28.000> inside<00:05:28.360> the<00:05:28.539> area<00:05:28.900> and<00:05:29.110> this

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:29.800 
and they have inside the area and this

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.110 
and they have inside the area and this
is<00:05:29.979> the<00:05:30.070> main<00:05:30.220> reason<00:05:30.639> right<00:05:30.789> here<00:05:30.970> why<00:05:31.090> you

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:31.120 
is the main reason right here why you

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.029 
is the main reason right here why you

00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:33.039 
don't want to spawn today because you

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:35.370 
don't want to spawn today because you
see<00:05:33.250> I<00:05:33.520> can<00:05:33.729> I<00:05:34.060> come<00:05:34.389> the<00:05:34.510> phone<00:05:34.720> a<00:05:34.750> name<00:05:35.050> and

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:37.720 
try to land it inside be so you know I

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.170 
try to land it inside be so you know I
got<00:05:37.930> pretty<00:05:38.199> lucky<00:05:38.349> that<00:05:38.770> you<00:05:39.550> know<00:05:39.639> foreplay

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:40.180

you want to have see is because you can
land<00:05:46.330> head<00:05:46.539> like<00:05:46.750> that<00:05:46.930> pretty<00:05:47.139> much<00:05:47.349> of

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:47.470 
land head like that pretty much of

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:51.540 
land head like that pretty much of
anywhere<00:05:47.740> on<00:05:47.889> the<00:05:47.979> map<00:05:48.960> in<00:05:49.960> with<00:05:50.169> the<00:05:50.289> map<00:05:50.550> with

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:51.550 
anywhere on the map in with the map with

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:53.370 
anywhere on the map in with the map with
50<00:05:51.880> seconds<00:05:52.240> left<00:05:52.449> and<00:05:52.750> you<00:05:52.990> know<00:05:53.080> we're<00:05:53.259> up<00:05:53.349> by

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:53.380 
50 seconds left and you know we're up by

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:55.260 
50 seconds left and you know we're up by
like<00:05:53.740> 80<00:05:54.039> right<00:05:54.310> now<00:05:54.460> you<00:05:55.030> know<00:05:55.090> there's

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:55.270 
like 80 right now you know there's

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:56.550 
like 80 right now you know there's
really<00:05:55.509> no<00:05:55.720> hope<00:05:55.930> for<00:05:56.169> them<00:05:56.229> to<00:05:56.349> come<00:05:56.500> back

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:56.560 
really no hope for them to come back

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.379 
really no hope for them to come back
it's<00:05:56.889> mathematically<00:05:57.430> impossible<00:05:57.520> even<00:05:58.210> if

00:05:58.379 --> 00:05:58.389 
it's mathematically impossible even if

00:05:58.389 --> 00:06:00.390 
it's mathematically impossible even if
they<00:05:58.509> threw<00:05:58.720> catheters<00:05:59.169> so<00:05:59.889> you<00:05:59.949> know<00:06:00.220> right

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:00.400 
they threw catheters so you know right

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.159 
they threw catheters so you know right
now<00:06:00.580> we<00:06:00.639> pretty<00:06:01.030> much<00:06:01.180> have<00:06:01.479> the<00:06:01.599> wind<00:06:01.780> secured

00:06:02.159 --> 00:06:02.169 
now we pretty much have the wind secured

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:04.350 
now we pretty much have the wind secured
I<00:06:02.470> get<00:06:03.340> taken<00:06:03.639> out<00:06:03.699> right<00:06:03.880> here<00:06:03.970> from<00:06:04.150> top

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:04.360 
I get taken out right here from top

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:07.469 
I get taken out right here from top
control<00:06:04.750> we<00:06:05.530> have<00:06:05.650> three<00:06:05.830> people<00:06:06.099> down<00:06:06.479> but

00:06:07.469 --> 00:06:07.479 
control we have three people down but
