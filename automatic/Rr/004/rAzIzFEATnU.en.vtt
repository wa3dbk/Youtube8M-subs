00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:26.759 
at the moment probably the main one

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:28.880 
at the moment probably the main one
actually<00:00:27.090> is<00:00:27.210> James<00:00:27.630> Collins<00:00:28.050> from<00:00:28.410> West<00:00:28.619> Ham

yes the 31 year old is apparently linked

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.770 
yes the 31 year old is apparently linked
with<00:00:31.560> a<00:00:31.590> move<00:00:31.649> to<00:00:32.220> norwich<00:00:32.579> city<00:00:32.910> after<00:00:33.600> west

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
with a move to norwich city after west

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.630 
with a move to norwich city after west
house<00:00:33.960> just<00:00:34.290> so<00:00:34.440> I<00:00:34.470> Bona<00:00:35.040> which<00:00:35.280> means<00:00:35.489> he's

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
house just so I Bona which means he's

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.549 
house just so I Bona which means he's
gone<00:00:35.850> down<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.149> pecking<00:00:36.329> order<00:00:36.480> we<00:00:37.230> need<00:00:37.440> to

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
gone down the pecking order we need to

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.410 
gone down the pecking order we need to
set<00:00:37.739> her<00:00:37.860> back<00:00:37.980> it's<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.519> perfect<00:00:38.760> fit<00:00:39.180> to<00:00:39.329> the

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
set her back it's the perfect fit to the

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.780 
set her back it's the perfect fit to the
press<00:00:39.720> but<00:00:40.260> for<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.739> press<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:41.190> put<00:00:41.519> together

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
press but for the press to put together

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.290 
press but for the press to put together
so<00:00:42.329> James<00:00:43.110> Collins<00:00:43.640> was<00:00:44.640> probably<00:00:44.940> good<00:00:45.089> about

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
so James Collins was probably good about

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.790 
so James Collins was probably good about
five<00:00:45.600> years<00:00:45.809> ago<00:00:45.960> I<00:00:46.140> don't<00:00:46.350> think<00:00:46.559> he's<00:00:46.650> very

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
five years ago I don't think he's very

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.280 
five years ago I don't think he's very
good<00:00:47.070> now<00:00:47.250> his<00:00:47.850> best<00:00:48.210> day<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.480> God<00:00:48.870> he's<00:00:49.170> the

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:49.290 
good now his best day to God he's the

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:51.110 
good now his best day to God he's the
same<00:00:49.500> age<00:00:49.680> as<00:00:49.860> Michael<00:00:50.220> Turner<00:00:50.430> which<00:00:50.730> worries

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
same age as Michael Turner which worries

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.360 
same age as Michael Turner which worries
me<00:00:51.149> a<00:00:51.329> little<00:00:51.480> bit<00:00:51.570> he's<00:00:51.750> 31<00:00:52.320> he's<00:00:53.159> actually

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
me a little bit he's 31 he's actually

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.040 
me a little bit he's 31 he's actually
had<00:00:53.670> a<00:00:53.699> fairly<00:00:53.970> decent<00:00:54.089> career<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:54.899> his

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
had a fairly decent career and his

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.900 
had a fairly decent career and his
transfer<00:00:55.500> fees<00:00:55.710> have<00:00:55.859> come<00:00:56.070> into<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.579> region

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
transfer fees have come into the region

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.170 
transfer fees have come into the region
of<00:00:57.000> seven<00:00:57.300> half<00:00:57.449> million<00:00:57.809> across<00:00:58.230> all<00:00:58.469> of<00:00:58.500> his

00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.180 
of seven half million across all of his

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:04.880 
of seven half million across all of his
complete<00:01:00.180> clubs<00:01:01.010> so<00:01:02.010> it<00:01:02.489> seems<00:01:03.149> like<00:01:03.679> this<00:01:04.679> one

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
complete clubs so it seems like this one

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.889 
complete clubs so it seems like this one
just<00:01:04.979> doesn't<00:01:05.220> excite<00:01:05.729> me<00:01:05.789> it<00:01:06.090> really<00:01:06.330> doesn't

00:01:06.889 --> 00:01:06.899 
just doesn't excite me it really doesn't

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:08.570 
just doesn't excite me it really doesn't
we've<00:01:07.050> been<00:01:07.229> in<00:01:07.380> foot<00:01:07.679> you<00:01:08.070> know<00:01:08.160> the<00:01:08.280> likes<00:01:08.429> of

we've been in foot you know the likes of

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:09.859 
we've been in foot you know the likes of
Van<00:01:08.729> Dyke<00:01:09.060> it<00:01:09.300> was<00:01:09.420> always<00:01:09.630> going<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:09.840> be

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
Van Dyke it was always going to be

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.419 
Van Dyke it was always going to be
unrealistic<00:01:10.410> that<00:01:10.619> one<00:01:10.920> I<00:01:10.950> don't<00:01:11.220> think<00:01:11.340> it's

00:01:11.419 --> 00:01:11.429 
unrealistic that one I don't think it's

00:01:11.429 --> 00:01:12.650 
unrealistic that one I don't think it's
going<00:01:11.550> to<00:01:11.610> happen<00:01:11.759> you<00:01:12.090> might<00:01:12.210> actually<00:01:12.420> have

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:12.660 
going to happen you might actually have

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:16.160 
going to happen you might actually have
got<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.929> Southampton<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:14.869> we're<00:01:15.869> left<00:01:16.020> with

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
got the Southampton and we're left with

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.620 
got the Southampton and we're left with
James<00:01:16.410> Collins<00:01:16.740> I<00:01:17.130> don't<00:01:17.520> think<00:01:17.910> there's<00:01:18.300> much

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
James Collins I don't think there's much

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.660 
James Collins I don't think there's much
substance<00:01:19.170> in<00:01:19.380> this<00:01:19.500> I<00:01:19.679> just<00:01:19.890> think<00:01:20.070> it's<00:01:20.250> you

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
substance in this I just think it's you

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.090 
substance in this I just think it's you
know<00:01:20.789> two<00:01:20.850> clubs<00:01:21.479> us<00:01:21.690> or<00:01:21.899> be<00:01:22.350> put<00:01:22.619> together<00:01:22.740> by

00:01:25.669 --> 00:01:25.679 
the press but it's just kind of a bit

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:27.800 
the press but it's just kind of a bit
sort<00:01:26.009> of<00:01:26.039> typical<00:01:26.399> Nora<00:01:26.849> see<00:01:27.149> if<00:01:27.270> it<00:01:27.390> does<00:01:27.599> go

to<00:01:38.069> be<00:01:38.190> honest<00:01:38.489> I<00:01:38.670> think<00:01:39.270> this<00:01:39.720> is<00:01:39.869> fairly

likely<00:01:40.410> actually<00:01:40.950> it<00:01:41.039> might<00:01:41.280> happen<00:01:41.580> I<00:01:41.940> mean<00:01:42.270> I

00:01:42.559 --> 00:01:42.569 
likely actually it might happen I mean I

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:44.150 
likely actually it might happen I mean I
might<00:01:43.050> be<00:01:43.200> getting<00:01:43.410> a<00:01:43.440> bit<00:01:43.560> dude<00:01:43.739> out<00:01:43.950> about

him<00:02:12.060> at<00:02:12.150> the<00:02:12.239> moment<00:02:12.629> but<00:02:13.410> i<00:02:13.680> don't<00:02:13.980> think<00:02:14.310> i

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
him at the moment but i don't think i

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.550 
him at the moment but i don't think i
still<00:02:15.030> think<00:02:15.270> michael<00:02:15.660> turner<00:02:15.840> might<00:02:16.319> have<00:02:16.530> a

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
still think michael turner might have a

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.920 
still think michael turner might have a
place<00:02:16.890> at<00:02:17.370> this<00:02:17.760> norwich<00:02:18.090> team<00:02:18.330> I<00:02:18.510> think<00:02:18.540> he's

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
place at this norwich team I think he's

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.220 
place at this norwich team I think he's
probably<00:02:19.080> about<00:02:19.470> the<00:02:19.709> same<00:02:19.860> as<00:02:20.099> James<00:02:20.370> Collins

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
probably about the same as James Collins

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.949 
probably about the same as James Collins
but<00:02:22.230> if<00:02:22.530> I<00:02:22.709> was<00:02:22.950> Norwich<00:02:23.370> I<00:02:23.610> would<00:02:23.819> keep<00:02:24.209> if<00:02:24.510> it

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
but if I was Norwich I would keep if it

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.050 
but if I was Norwich I would keep if it
was<00:02:25.050> between<00:02:25.200> either<00:02:25.530> side<00:02:25.860> in<00:02:26.069> Collins<00:02:26.489> or

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
was between either side in Collins or

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.089 
was between either side in Collins or
and<00:02:27.480> let<00:02:27.629> in<00:02:27.780> turn<00:02:28.110> a<00:02:28.140> go<00:02:28.440> I<00:02:28.470> probably<00:02:28.800> keeps

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
and let in turn a go I probably keeps

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:30.500 
and let in turn a go I probably keeps
her<00:02:29.310> and<00:02:29.610> just<00:02:29.730> forget<00:02:29.940> about<00:02:30.000> Collins

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
her and just forget about Collins

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.630 
her and just forget about Collins
obviously<00:02:31.050> the<00:02:31.590> ideal<00:02:32.010> would<00:02:32.220> be<00:02:32.250> side<00:02:32.610> a

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
obviously the ideal would be side a

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:33.200 
obviously the ideal would be side a
better<00:02:32.880> player

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.210 
better player

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.150 
better player
James<00:02:33.480> Collins<00:02:33.750> and<00:02:33.990> let<00:02:34.080> town<00:02:34.290> ago<00:02:34.590> he's<00:02:35.040> been

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
James Collins and let town ago he's been

James Collins and let town ago he's been
a<00:02:35.220> link<00:02:35.430> of<00:02:35.520> the<00:02:35.580> move<00:02:35.730> the<00:02:35.850> Sheffield<00:02:36.300> United

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
a link of the move the Sheffield United

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.630 
a link of the move the Sheffield United
so<00:02:36.990> a<00:02:37.020> leak<00:02:37.320> one<00:02:37.680> club<00:02:38.040> which<00:02:38.190> would<00:02:38.310> be<00:02:38.430> a<00:02:38.460> big

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
so a leak one club which would be a big

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:39.830 
so a leak one club which would be a big
dropped<00:02:38.940> out<00:02:39.090> of<00:02:39.120> him<00:02:39.390> I<00:02:39.420> think<00:02:39.600> he'd<00:02:39.690> been

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
dropped out of him I think he'd been

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.300 
dropped out of him I think he'd been
awesome<00:02:40.350> defender<00:02:40.770> and<00:02:40.860> that<00:02:40.980> league<00:02:41.160> I<00:02:41.280> think

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
awesome defender and that league I think

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.090 
awesome defender and that league I think
he's<00:02:41.580> pretty<00:02:41.820> decent<00:02:42.240> anyway<00:02:42.860> but<00:02:43.860> he's<00:02:43.950> a<00:02:43.980> bit

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
he's pretty decent anyway but he's a bit

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.640 
he's pretty decent anyway but he's a bit
slow<00:02:44.370> now<00:02:44.640> you<00:02:45.480> know<00:02:45.630> yeah<00:02:46.020> would<00:02:46.380> probably

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
slow now you know yeah would probably

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:47.870 
slow now you know yeah would probably
let<00:02:46.740> him<00:02:46.860> go<00:02:47.010> i<00:02:47.040> don't<00:02:47.130> think<00:02:47.280> i'd<00:02:47.460> lose<00:02:47.640> sleep

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
let him go i don't think i'd lose sleep

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.570 
let him go i don't think i'd lose sleep
