excellent yeah and now it's just

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:21.470 
excellent yeah and now it's just
processing<00:03:16.500> a<00:03:17.090> double-sided<00:03:18.090> document<00:03:20.480> again

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
processing a double-sided document again

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.720 
processing a double-sided document again
there's<00:03:21.990> going<00:03:22.080> to<00:03:22.140> be<00:03:22.200> five<00:03:22.470> sheets<00:03:22.800> coming

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
there's going to be five sheets coming

00:03:23.730 --> 00:04:20.140 
there's going to be five sheets coming
out<00:03:23.819> of<00:03:23.970> the<00:03:24.030> machine<00:03:24.090> very<00:03:24.510> shortly

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:22.060 

okay<00:04:20.870> you'll<00:04:21.049> notice<00:04:21.500> that<00:04:21.769> it's<00:04:21.949> actually

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
okay you'll notice that it's actually

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.510 
okay you'll notice that it's actually
printing<00:04:22.639> two<00:04:22.880> pages<00:04:23.240> at<00:04:23.540> once<00:04:23.570> and<00:04:24.520> duplexing

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 
printing two pages at once and duplexing

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.000 
printing two pages at once and duplexing
one<00:04:25.699> of<00:04:25.820> the<00:04:25.910> pages<00:04:26.150> while<00:04:27.139> it<00:04:27.380> then<00:04:27.560> prints

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.010 
one of the pages while it then prints

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:29.650 
one of the pages while it then prints
the<00:04:28.310> other<00:04:28.460> page<00:04:28.729> so<00:04:29.000> it's<00:04:29.150> quite<00:04:29.389> clever

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.660 
the other page so it's quite clever

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:31.570 
the other page so it's quite clever
technique<00:04:30.320> it<00:04:30.470> just<00:04:30.650> speed<00:04:30.889> the<00:04:31.040> printing<00:04:31.460> up

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
technique it just speed the printing up

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.580 
technique it just speed the printing up
a<00:04:31.669> little<00:04:31.820> bit<00:04:32.090> there<00:04:32.900> we<00:04:32.990> go<00:04:33.080> these<00:04:33.290> were<00:04:33.470> all

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590 
a little bit there we go these were all

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.480 
a little bit there we go these were all
set<00:04:33.830> to<00:04:33.949> 200<00:04:34.400> by<00:04:34.490> travels<00:04:34.910> at<00:04:35.000> dpi<00:04:35.479> and<00:04:36.490> there's

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
set to 200 by travels at dpi and there's

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:39.640 
set to 200 by travels at dpi and there's
all<00:04:37.729> the<00:04:37.880> outputs<00:04:38.360> double-sided<00:04:39.020> if<00:04:39.380> you<00:04:39.470> want

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.650 
all the outputs double-sided if you want

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:41.290 
all the outputs double-sided if you want
to<00:04:39.770> see<00:04:39.919> them<00:04:40.130> don't<00:04:40.250> forget<00:04:40.370> to<00:04:40.729> work<00:04:41.030> it<00:04:41.210> in

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300 
to see them don't forget to work it in

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:46.750 
to see them don't forget to work it in
