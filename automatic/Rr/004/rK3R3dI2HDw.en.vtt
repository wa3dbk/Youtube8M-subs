there<00:01:46.020> are<00:01:46.170> gameplay<00:01:46.860> elements<00:01:47.220> in<00:01:47.369> there<00:01:47.700> but

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
there are gameplay elements in there but

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.819 
there are gameplay elements in there but
it<00:01:48.180> is<00:01:48.329> about<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.659> story<00:01:48.930> and<00:01:49.259> that's

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
it is about the story and that's

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.200 
it is about the story and that's
probably<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.310> most<00:01:50.399> interesting<00:01:50.939> part<00:01:51.119> of<00:01:51.149> a

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
probably the most interesting part of a

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.050 
probably the most interesting part of a
game<00:01:51.390> is<00:01:51.420> that<00:01:51.840> it's<00:01:52.710> not<00:01:52.829> just<00:01:53.070> one<00:01:53.220> story<00:01:53.520> now

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
game is that it's not just one story now

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.240 
game is that it's not just one story now

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
thousands of different endings so

made<00:02:07.049> a<00:02:07.500> potentially<00:02:08.220> game<00:02:08.399> altering<00:02:08.910> choice

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
made a potentially game altering choice

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.969 
made a potentially game altering choice
which<00:02:09.420> is<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:09.629> cool<00:02:09.899> and<00:02:10.319> the<00:02:10.739> end<00:02:10.860> of<00:02:10.920> the

which is the cool and the end of the
demo<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.910> guys<00:02:12.060> from<00:02:12.090> super<00:02:12.480> must<00:02:12.660> have<00:02:12.780> run

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
demo the guys from super must have run

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.020 
demo the guys from super must have run
us<00:02:13.050> through<00:02:13.290> and<00:02:13.500> he<00:02:13.650> was<00:02:13.800> like<00:02:13.920> so<00:02:14.550> I<00:02:14.580> picked

us through and he was like so I picked
up<00:02:15.120> this<00:02:15.239> clue<00:02:15.540> but<00:02:15.930> I<00:02:15.989> missed<00:02:16.200> this<00:02:16.349> one<00:02:16.590> I

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
up this clue but I missed this one I

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.910 
up this clue but I missed this one I
made<00:02:16.860> this<00:02:17.250> moral<00:02:18.090> decision<00:02:18.510> well<00:02:19.290> yeah<00:02:19.709> it's

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
made this moral decision well yeah it's

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.800 
made this moral decision well yeah it's
a<00:02:19.950> pretty<00:02:20.040> heavy<00:02:20.280> moral<00:02:20.580> decision<00:02:20.940> but<00:02:21.720> it

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
a pretty heavy moral decision but it

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.360 
a pretty heavy moral decision but it
affects<00:02:22.080> completely<00:02:22.500> how<00:02:22.680> your<00:02:22.980> games<00:02:23.190> gonna

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
affects completely how your games gonna

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.040 
affects completely how your games gonna
play<00:02:23.580> out<00:02:23.610> it's<00:02:23.879> not<00:02:23.970> just<00:02:24.209> picking<00:02:24.569> an<00:02:24.690> ending

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
play out it's not just picking an ending

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.309 
play out it's not just picking an ending
all<00:02:25.739> of<00:02:26.010> these<00:02:26.129> little<00:02:26.280> little<00:02:27.150> bits<00:02:27.390> come

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
all of these little little bits come

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:30.050 
all of these little little bits come
together<00:02:28.709> and<00:02:28.950> really<00:02:29.190> change<00:02:29.849> how<00:02:29.970> your

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
together and really change how your

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.160 
together and really change how your
story<00:02:30.239> plays<00:02:30.480> out<00:02:30.599> yeah<00:02:30.900> it<00:02:30.989> was<00:02:31.080> quite

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
story plays out yeah it was quite

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.869 
story plays out yeah it was quite
amazing<00:02:31.349> like<00:02:31.890> they<00:02:32.069> they<00:02:32.340> were<00:02:32.459> saying<00:02:32.700> that

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879 
amazing like they they were saying that

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:34.430 
amazing like they they were saying that
there's<00:02:33.300> thousands<00:02:33.750> of<00:02:33.780> fermentation<00:02:34.080> for

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
there's thousands of fermentation for

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.710 
there's thousands of fermentation for
the<00:02:34.500> ending<00:02:34.800> but<00:02:35.280> in<00:02:35.459> between<00:02:35.730> that<00:02:36.030> there<00:02:36.629> are

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
the ending but in between that there are

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.720 
the ending but in between that there are
actually<00:02:37.080> lots<00:02:37.349> of<00:02:37.739> little<00:02:38.010> decisions<00:02:38.550> that

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
actually lots of little decisions that

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.850 
actually lots of little decisions that
only<00:02:38.879> affect<00:02:39.330> that<00:02:39.810> individuals<00:02:40.349> story<00:02:40.620> as

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
only affect that individuals story as

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.610 
only affect that individuals story as
well<00:02:41.040> and<00:02:41.550> so<00:02:41.790> as<00:02:42.000> you're<00:02:42.780> sort<00:02:43.080> of<00:02:43.110> game<00:02:43.319> goes

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
well and so as you're sort of game goes

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.000 
well and so as you're sort of game goes
on<00:02:43.800> like<00:02:44.160> we<00:02:44.340> just<00:02:44.550> got<00:02:44.700> so<00:02:45.300> many<00:02:45.599> branches<00:02:46.010> in

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
on like we just got so many branches in

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.949 
on like we just got so many branches in
which<00:02:47.280> your<00:02:47.430> story<00:02:47.730> can<00:02:47.879> go<00:02:48.060> and<00:02:48.840> they<00:02:48.900> were

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
which your story can go and they were

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:50.570 
which your story can go and they were
saying<00:02:49.200> that<00:02:49.349> all<00:02:49.830> the<00:02:50.040> characters<00:02:50.430> in<00:02:50.519> the

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
saying that all the characters in the

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.119 
saying that all the characters in the
game<00:02:50.610> can<00:02:51.060> buy<00:02:51.209> yeah<00:02:51.780> so<00:02:52.349> no<00:02:52.530> one's<00:02:52.709> any<00:02:52.920> point

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:53.129 
game can buy yeah so no one's any point

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:54.890 
game can buy yeah so no one's any point
I<00:02:53.370> you<00:02:53.519> can<00:02:53.760> screw<00:02:53.940> that<00:02:54.060> up<00:02:54.120> totally<00:02:54.540> and<00:02:54.690> then

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
I you can screw that up totally and then

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.869 
I you can screw that up totally and then
all<00:02:55.050> be<00:02:55.170> dead<00:02:55.349> and<00:02:55.590> then<00:02:56.099> you<00:02:56.430> know<00:02:56.519> you've<00:02:56.730> got

00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:56.879 
all be dead and then you know you've got

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:58.729 
all be dead and then you know you've got
pletely<00:02:57.420> different<00:02:57.810> ending<00:02:58.080> if<00:02:58.260> I<00:02:58.379> think<00:02:58.560> is

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
pletely different ending if I think is

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:01.339 
pletely different ending if I think is
is<00:02:58.980> super<00:02:59.340> cool<00:02:59.489> but<00:03:00.060> I'm<00:03:00.209> intl<00:03:00.930> game<00:03:01.050> itself

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:01.349 
is super cool but I'm intl game itself

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:04.490 
is super cool but I'm intl game itself
we<00:03:01.560> saw<00:03:01.769> um<00:03:02.340> sort<00:03:03.180> of<00:03:03.269> a<00:03:03.420> decent<00:03:03.870> chunk<00:03:04.230> we<00:03:04.379> go

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
we saw um sort of a decent chunk we go

we saw um sort of a decent chunk we go
through<00:03:04.709> so<00:03:04.830> far<00:03:04.860> yeah<00:03:05.489> a<00:03:05.519> decent<00:03:05.940> half-hour

chunk and there were lots of there lots
of<00:03:08.700> good<00:03:08.819> scares<00:03:09.090> I<00:03:09.150> mean<00:03:09.300> certainly<00:03:09.420> in<00:03:09.599> the

00:03:09.649 --> 00:03:09.659 
of good scares I mean certainly in the

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:11.059 
of good scares I mean certainly in the
room<00:03:09.840> here<00:03:09.989> in<00:03:10.140> a<00:03:10.260> black<00:03:10.409> title<00:03:10.769> the<00:03:10.860> lights

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
room here in a black title the lights

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:13.399 
room here in a black title the lights
and<00:03:11.519> there<00:03:12.209> was<00:03:12.330> a<00:03:12.360> new<00:03:12.690> screen<00:03:12.959> there<00:03:13.290> was<00:03:13.379> a

00:03:13.399 --> 00:03:13.409 
and there was a new screen there was a

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:15.220 
and there was a new screen there was a
woman<00:03:13.530> who<00:03:13.680> screamed<00:03:14.010> yes

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
woman who screamed yes

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.619 
woman who screamed yes
no<00:03:15.830> thing<00:03:16.310> I<00:03:16.430> thought<00:03:16.580> about<00:03:16.640> it<00:03:16.849> is<00:03:17.030> and<00:03:17.300> so

00:03:17.619 --> 00:03:17.629 
no thing I thought about it is and so

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:19.119 
no thing I thought about it is and so
