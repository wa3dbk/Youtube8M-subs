00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.970
 right on the button down on the right 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:08.760
 I'm going to do up 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.620
 to the left goes to the right because 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.500

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.170
 of color you can also see that 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.420
 when volume goes up, the 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:38.349
 the orange volume bars 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:41.080
 green and orange so good that leave me 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:43.390
 what is progress 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:46.100
 There are the first ones I want from 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:51.670
 color blue 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:51.670
 the second I want them orange 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.959
 and the third ones I want them in color 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:03.330

 see how they changed me 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:08.160
 the volume bars very well now 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:09.900
 the animation as you can see I have 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.270
 animations so good here we 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:17.600
 this is the animation that comes out 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:17.600
 principle but I 'm going to put move 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:22.880
 when it's hidden I want it to come out 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:25.370
 up 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.900
 and here we can select that 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.670
 turn or not for example I'm going to put 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.530
 here the recipe and right now I'm going to 

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:33.890
 press volume to see how they are 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:35.370
 my new animations goes out there and 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:37.860
 then blue 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:40.120
 there it is if we put this going to rotate for 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:43.800
 other side 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.800
 and if we put in X 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.710
 and also so it does if we 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.840
 we want to move the animations by 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:51.160
 example now that you move from the 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:57.840
 engine 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:57.840
 and that goes up like that there goes 

00:04:58.249 --> 00:05:02.690
 and again up 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:04.730
