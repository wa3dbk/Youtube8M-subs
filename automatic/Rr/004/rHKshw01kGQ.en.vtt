thing and you recognize it as a motorcar
this<00:00:25.289> would<00:00:25.470> be<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:25.740> first<00:00:25.949> car<00:00:26.340> we've<00:00:26.820> ever

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
this would be the first car we've ever

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.580 
this would be the first car we've ever
done<00:00:27.300> that<00:00:27.510> it's<00:00:27.689> got<00:00:27.779> some<00:00:27.930> brass<00:00:28.170> on<00:00:28.410> it<00:00:30.590> I'm

done that it's got some brass on it I'm

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:32.569 
done that it's got some brass on it I'm
gonna<00:00:31.769> have<00:00:31.859> a<00:00:31.890> little<00:00:32.040> look<00:00:32.160> in<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.340> engine

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
gonna have a little look in the engine

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.490 
gonna have a little look in the engine
bay<00:00:32.700> and<00:00:33.120> what<00:00:33.239> we<00:00:33.360> expected<00:00:33.690> to<00:00:33.809> find<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:34.079> v6

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
bay and what we expected to find a v6

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.580 
bay and what we expected to find a v6
maybe<00:00:35.660> that<00:00:36.660> is<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:36.989> image<00:00:37.140> you've<00:00:37.290> got<00:00:37.410> eight

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
maybe that is the image you've got eight

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.619 
maybe that is the image you've got eight
whole<00:00:38.010> horsepower<00:00:38.700> here<00:00:39.000> you<00:00:39.239> can<00:00:39.360> recognize

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
whole horsepower here you can recognize

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.270 
whole horsepower here you can recognize
all<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:40.020> parts<00:00:40.350> you've<00:00:40.469> got<00:00:40.620> what<00:00:40.980> looks<00:00:41.129> like

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
all the parts you've got what looks like

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.979 
all the parts you've got what looks like
the<00:00:41.520> beginnings<00:00:41.910> of<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.149> sort<00:00:42.390> of<00:00:42.450> carburetor

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
the beginnings of the sort of carburetor

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.080 
the beginnings of the sort of carburetor
that<00:00:43.590> your<00:00:43.739> exhaust<00:00:44.100> system<00:00:44.219> gonna<00:00:44.670> look

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
that your exhaust system gonna look

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.760 
that your exhaust system gonna look
there's<00:00:45.539> a<00:00:45.600> spark<00:00:45.930> plug<00:00:45.960> as<00:00:46.230> a<00:00:46.289> whole<00:00:46.440> spark

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
there's a spark plug as a whole spark

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.770 
there's a spark plug as a whole spark
plug<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.190> then<00:00:47.340> I<00:00:47.550> guess<00:00:48.090> that's<00:00:48.360> actually

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
plug and then I guess that's actually

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.569 
plug and then I guess that's actually
kind<00:00:49.140> of<00:00:49.170> like<00:00:49.350> your<00:00:49.500> water<00:00:49.710> reservoir<00:00:50.340> here's

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
kind of like your water reservoir here's

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.520 
kind of like your water reservoir here's
your<00:00:50.760> radiator<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.449> we<00:00:52.110> have<00:00:52.230> a<00:00:52.260> look<00:00:52.410> what

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
your radiator and we have a look what

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.720 
your radiator and we have a look what
these<00:00:52.649> do<00:00:52.920> they<00:00:53.100> what<00:00:53.219> with<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.399> pedals<00:00:53.670> a

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
these do they what with the pedals a

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.400 
these do they what with the pedals a
little<00:00:53.910> bit<00:00:54.030> it's<00:00:54.300> got<00:00:54.570> one<00:00:54.840> on<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.079> left<00:00:55.230> one

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
little bit it's got one on the left one

girl you can actually see the kind of
this<00:01:08.070> cone<00:01:08.400> moving<00:01:08.790> in<00:01:08.880> and<00:01:09.000> out<00:01:09.060> one<00:01:09.689> looks

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
this cone moving in and out one looks

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.690 
this cone moving in and out one looks
like<00:01:09.930> a<00:01:09.960> flywheel<00:01:10.560> these<00:01:10.979> two<00:01:11.280> pedals<00:01:11.580> go

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
like a flywheel these two pedals go

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.910 
like a flywheel these two pedals go
together<00:01:12.000> there's<00:01:12.720> a<00:01:12.810> brake<00:01:13.170> on<00:01:13.680> the

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
together there's a brake on the

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.149 
together there's a brake on the
transmission<00:01:14.340> rather<00:01:14.520> like<00:01:14.729> a<00:01:14.760> Land<00:01:15.030> Rover

job it's all going to be done by hand
you're<00:01:35.700> gonna<00:01:35.820> really<00:01:36.119> think<00:01:36.450> about<00:01:36.570> how

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
you're gonna really think about how

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.929 
you're gonna really think about how
you're<00:01:37.049> driving<00:01:37.259> it<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:37.860> of<00:01:38.430> course<00:01:38.640> it's<00:01:38.820> got

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
you're driving it and of course it's got

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.300 
you're driving it and of course it's got
wooden<00:01:39.210> wheels<00:01:39.450> wooden<00:01:40.409> wheels<00:01:40.650> tend<00:01:40.950> to<00:01:41.070> dry

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
wooden wheels wooden wheels tend to dry

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.010 
wooden wheels wooden wheels tend to dry
out<00:01:41.340> they<00:01:42.119> wobble<00:01:42.570> a<00:01:42.659> bit<00:01:43.159> the<00:01:44.159> whole<00:01:44.340> thing

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
out they wobble a bit the whole thing

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.710 
out they wobble a bit the whole thing
takes<00:01:46.020> a<00:01:46.290> lot<00:01:46.619> of<00:01:46.649> concentration<00:01:46.920> to<00:01:47.520> drive<00:01:47.970> it

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
takes a lot of concentration to drive it

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.270 
takes a lot of concentration to drive it
gets<00:01:49.020> very<00:01:49.110> hot<00:01:49.560> so<00:01:49.740> you<00:01:49.799> got<00:01:49.890> to<00:01:49.979> be<00:01:50.070> careful

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
gets very hot so you got to be careful

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.930 

shudders<00:02:20.110> it<00:02:20.320> does<00:02:20.560> show<00:02:20.860> I<00:02:21.190> just<00:02:21.400> think<00:02:21.610> it's

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
shudders it does show I just think it's

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.060 
shudders it does show I just think it's
not<00:02:22.360> run<00:02:22.600> right<00:02:23.200> this<00:02:23.380> thing<00:02:23.680> hasn't<00:02:23.830> run<00:02:24.040> for

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
many many many years I think the thing
