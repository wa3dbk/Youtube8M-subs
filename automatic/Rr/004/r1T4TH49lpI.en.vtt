great marriage of customer feedback and

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.359 
great marriage of customer feedback and
engineering<00:00:15.299> so<00:00:15.870> in<00:00:16.170> terms<00:00:16.350> of<00:00:16.560> going<00:00:17.130> and

engineering so in terms of going and
speaking<00:00:17.730> to<00:00:17.820> our<00:00:17.850> customers<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:18.420> one<00:00:18.570> thing

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
speaking to our customers the one thing

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.540 
speaking to our customers the one thing
they<00:00:18.810> wanted<00:00:19.230> is<00:00:19.350> an<00:00:19.470> increased<00:00:20.039> interior

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
they wanted is an increased interior

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.179 
they wanted is an increased interior
space<00:00:21.330> so<00:00:22.020> we<00:00:22.080> were<00:00:22.230> able<00:00:22.289> to<00:00:22.590> increase<00:00:22.949> the

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
space so we were able to increase the

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.730 
space so we were able to increase the
interior<00:00:23.519> volume<00:00:23.670> by<00:00:23.939> twelve<00:00:24.210> percent<00:00:24.600> but<00:00:25.350> we

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
interior volume by twelve percent but we

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.040 
interior volume by twelve percent but we
kept<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.189> car<00:00:26.369> manageable<00:00:27.210> from<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.539> dr<00:00:27.750> it's

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
kept the car manageable from the dr it's

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.800 
kept the car manageable from the dr it's
less<00:00:28.410> 1.4<00:00:29.070> inches<00:00:29.160> longer<00:00:29.630> despite<00:00:30.630> all<00:00:30.779> that

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
less 1.4 inches longer despite all that

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.310 
less 1.4 inches longer despite all that
and<00:00:31.199> it<00:00:31.529> gains<00:00:31.949> less<00:00:32.250> than<00:00:32.430> 50<00:00:32.790> pounds<00:00:33.270> we<00:00:34.079> dead

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
and it gains less than 50 pounds we dead

percent of high-strength steel and
that's<00:00:38.879> how<00:00:39.000> you<00:00:39.120> manage<00:00:39.480> to<00:00:39.570> keep<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.930> weight

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
that's how you manage to keep the weight

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.920 
that's how you manage to keep the weight
down<00:00:40.110> but<00:00:40.710> by<00:00:40.860> improving<00:00:41.460> its<00:00:41.670> size<00:00:41.850> we've<00:00:42.750> got

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
down but by improving its size we've got

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.869
