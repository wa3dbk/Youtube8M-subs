that<00:01:10.909> it<00:01:11.060> likely<00:01:11.210> to<00:01:11.390> roll<00:01:11.570> up<00:01:11.810> of<00:01:12.020> the<00:01:12.110> edges

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
that it likely to roll up of the edges

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:19.090 
that it likely to roll up of the edges
you<00:01:13.400> know<00:01:13.600> some<00:01:14.600> biases<00:01:15.020> if<00:01:15.200> you<00:01:15.320> see<00:01:15.590> that<00:01:18.100> it

New York pulling it soon you'll write
your<00:05:22.990> app<00:05:23.170> yes<00:05:23.410> at<00:05:23.740> first<00:05:24.130> don't<00:05:24.490> worry<00:05:24.610> too

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.000 
your app yes at first don't worry too

your app yes at first don't worry too
much<00:05:25.030> about<00:05:25.180> that<00:05:25.420> worry<00:05:25.810> about<00:05:26.080> where<00:05:26.230> the

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:26.350 
much about that worry about where the

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:27.960 
much about that worry about where the
pieces<00:05:26.560> go<00:05:26.710> and<00:05:27.040> then<00:05:27.160> we'll<00:05:27.310> work<00:05:27.760> on<00:05:27.940> that

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:27.970 
pieces go and then we'll work on that

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:29.670 
pieces go and then we'll work on that
but<00:05:28.300> yes<00:05:28.540> this<00:05:28.840> is<00:05:28.900> the<00:05:29.260> piece<00:05:29.470> that<00:05:29.620> really

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:29.680 
but yes this is the piece that really

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:38.010 
but yes this is the piece that really
gets<00:05:30.100> us<00:05:30.250> to<00:05:30.400> put<00:05:30.550> out<00:05:30.760> as<00:05:36.690> will<00:05:37.690> look<00:05:37.840> a<00:05:37.870> little

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:38.020 
gets us to put out as will look a little

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:39.210 
gets us to put out as will look a little
bit<00:05:38.140> different<00:05:38.530> because<00:05:38.590> I<00:05:38.770> did<00:05:38.920> it<00:05:39.010> with<00:05:39.130> the

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:39.220 
bit different because I did it with the

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:41.130 
bit different because I did it with the
cotton<00:05:39.550> but<00:05:40.000> at<00:05:40.090> the<00:05:40.240> same<00:05:40.420> time<00:05:40.630> it's<00:05:41.050> the

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:41.140 
cotton but at the same time it's the

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:44.670 
cotton but at the same time it's the
same<00:05:41.200> concept<00:05:42.300> and<00:05:43.300> this<00:05:43.570> one<00:05:43.870> again<00:05:44.260> starts

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:44.680 
same concept and this one again starts

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:47.250 
same concept and this one again starts
on<00:05:44.800> the<00:05:44.920> inside<00:05:44.950> part<00:05:45.610> of<00:05:45.700> the<00:05:45.850> leg<00:05:46.090> so<00:05:46.870> inside

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:47.260 
on the inside part of the leg so inside

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:48.930 
on the inside part of the leg so inside
part<00:05:47.530> first<00:05:47.710> oh<00:05:47.950> wait<00:05:48.220> then<00:05:48.640> it<00:05:48.760> comes

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:48.940 
part first oh wait then it comes

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:51.990 
part first oh wait then it comes
straight<00:05:49.360> down<00:05:49.980> and<00:05:50.980> then<00:05:51.250> it<00:05:51.400> does<00:05:51.610> the<00:05:51.760> same

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:52.000 
straight down and then it does the same

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.870 
straight down and then it does the same
thing<00:05:52.300> as<00:05:52.450> that<00:05:52.690> first<00:05:52.960> piece<00:05:53.290> so<00:05:53.560> it<00:05:53.680> goes<00:05:53.920> out

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:54.880 
thing as that first piece so it goes out

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.940 
thing as that first piece so it goes out
to<00:05:55.300> the<00:05:55.420> back<00:05:55.570> part<00:05:55.840> out<00:05:56.290> that<00:05:56.560> part<00:05:56.800> of<00:05:56.860> this

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:56.950 
to the back part out that part of this

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:59.310 
to the back part out that part of this
foot<00:05:57.220> and<00:05:57.550> around<00:05:58.180> the<00:05:58.330> back<00:05:58.660> part<00:05:59.230> of<00:05:59.260> his

00:05:59.310 --> 00:05:59.320 
foot and around the back part of his

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:01.230 
foot and around the back part of his
heel<00:05:59.680> and<00:06:00.010> it<00:06:00.220> makes<00:06:00.430> like<00:06:00.610> a<00:06:00.700> little<00:06:00.910> seed

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:01.240 
heel and it makes like a little seed

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:14.450 
heel and it makes like a little seed
around<00:06:01.660> the<00:06:01.990> back<00:06:02.170> part<00:06:02.470> of<00:06:02.530> this<00:06:02.620> heel

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:14.460 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:17.700 

and<00:06:15.460> then<00:06:16.120> this<00:06:16.300> next<00:06:16.629> piece<00:06:16.990> is<00:06:17.229> what<00:06:17.410> we<00:06:17.500> call

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:17.710 
and then this next piece is what we call

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:20.219 
and then this next piece is what we call
the<00:06:17.830> high<00:06:17.979> cross<00:06:18.250> the<00:06:18.940> in<00:06:19.120> the<00:06:19.569> middle<00:06:19.870> of<00:06:20.110> the

00:06:20.219 --> 00:06:20.229
