00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:27.880 
16 and from a corner we'll head it in to

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:29.610

make<00:06:28.090> it<00:06:28.120> one<00:06:28.480> nil<00:06:28.720> I'm<00:06:28.840> not<00:06:29.020> too<00:06:29.200> sure<00:06:29.380> how<00:06:29.560> we

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:29.620 
make it one nil I'm not too sure how we

make it one nil I'm not too sure how we
won<00:06:29.860> that<00:06:29.890> header<00:06:30.280> it<00:06:30.550> seemed<00:06:30.820> like<00:06:30.940> the

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:31.090 
won that header it seemed like the

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:32.610 
won that header it seemed like the
centre-back<00:06:31.540> should<00:06:31.720> have<00:06:31.840> gotten<00:06:32.020> Adam<00:06:32.260> but

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:32.620 
centre-back should have gotten Adam but

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:34.560

it's<00:06:39.369> just<00:06:39.549> a<00:06:39.639> very<00:06:40.019> clumsy<00:06:41.019> goal<00:06:41.259> that<00:06:41.649> makes

00:06:41.849 --> 00:06:41.859 
it's just a very clumsy goal that makes

00:06:41.859 --> 00:06:43.769 
it's just a very clumsy goal that makes
it<00:06:42.099> to<00:06:42.309> know<00:06:42.549> but<00:06:43.029> we<00:06:43.149> have<00:06:43.179> a<00:06:43.299> comfortable

00:06:43.769 --> 00:06:43.779 
it to know but we have a comfortable

00:06:43.779 --> 00:06:45.599 
it to know but we have a comfortable
lead<00:06:43.869> and<00:06:44.109> we<00:06:44.289> get<00:06:44.409> another<00:06:44.679> inelastic<00:06:45.519> Oh

00:06:45.599 --> 00:06:45.609 
lead and we get another inelastic Oh

00:06:45.609 --> 00:06:47.219 
lead and we get another inelastic Oh
going<00:06:45.879> I<00:06:45.969> tried<00:06:46.269> to<00:06:46.389> complete<00:06:46.719> that<00:06:46.869> skillet

00:06:47.219 --> 00:06:47.229 
going I tried to complete that skillet

00:06:47.229 --> 00:06:50.249 
going I tried to complete that skillet
quest<00:06:47.619> but<00:06:48.189> didn't<00:06:48.579> quite<00:06:48.639> a<00:06:48.849> pull<00:06:49.239> it<00:06:49.389> off<00:06:49.659> as

00:06:50.249 --> 00:06:50.259 
quest but didn't quite a pull it off as

00:06:50.259 --> 00:06:51.929 
quest but didn't quite a pull it off as
he<00:06:50.589> would<00:06:50.739> tackle<00:06:51.039> it<00:06:51.219> away<00:06:51.369> with<00:06:51.549> chip<00:06:51.729> it<00:06:51.849> up

00:06:51.929 --> 00:06:51.939 
he would tackle it away with chip it up

00:06:51.939 --> 00:06:54.209 
he would tackle it away with chip it up
in<00:06:52.089> the<00:06:52.209> air<00:06:52.389> and<00:06:52.599> we'll<00:06:52.959> get<00:06:53.169> the<00:06:53.349> gold<00:06:53.619> in<00:06:53.859> the

00:06:54.209 --> 00:06:54.219 
in the air and we'll get the gold in the

00:06:54.219 --> 00:06:56.639 
in the air and we'll get the gold in the
end<00:06:54.429> but<00:06:54.909> again<00:06:55.359> I<00:06:55.719> wouldn't<00:06:55.899> really<00:06:56.049> say<00:06:56.349> we

00:06:56.639 --> 00:06:56.649 
end but again I wouldn't really say we

00:06:56.649 --> 00:06:58.559 
end but again I wouldn't really say we
scored<00:06:56.949> a<00:06:57.039> skill<00:06:57.309> go<00:06:57.429> with<00:06:57.609> the<00:06:57.699> na<00:06:57.999> elastico

00:06:58.559 --> 00:06:58.569 
scored a skill go with the na elastico

00:06:58.569 --> 00:06:59.939 
scored a skill go with the na elastico
because<00:06:58.899> we<00:06:59.079> popped<00:06:59.289> tackle<00:06:59.649> and<00:06:59.769> lost

00:06:59.939 --> 00:06:59.949 
because we popped tackle and lost

00:06:59.949 --> 00:07:02.099 
because we popped tackle and lost
possession<00:07:00.489> but<00:07:00.879> we<00:07:00.999> tried<00:07:01.239> out<00:07:01.389> once<00:07:01.749> again

00:07:02.099 --> 00:07:02.109 
possession but we tried out once again

00:07:02.109 --> 00:07:04.679 
possession but we tried out once again
trying<00:07:02.529> out<00:07:02.739> the<00:07:02.919> shoulder<00:07:03.309> but<00:07:03.579> it<00:07:03.759> is<00:07:03.909> saved

00:07:04.679 --> 00:07:04.689 
trying out the shoulder but it is saved

00:07:04.689 --> 00:07:06.689 
trying out the shoulder but it is saved
and<00:07:04.989> a<00:07:05.049> half<00:07:05.259> time<00:07:05.529> we're<00:07:05.739> leading<00:07:06.099> three<00:07:06.429> nil

00:07:06.689 --> 00:07:06.699 
and a half time we're leading three nil

00:07:06.699 --> 00:07:09.419 
and a half time we're leading three nil
and<00:07:06.909> my<00:07:07.629> opponent<00:07:08.199> he<00:07:08.379> did<00:07:08.649> decide<00:07:09.039> to<00:07:09.099> ace

00:07:09.419 --> 00:07:09.429 
and my opponent he did decide to ace

00:07:09.429 --> 00:07:11.249 
and my opponent he did decide to ace
could<00:07:09.669> an<00:07:09.909> half<00:07:10.119> time<00:07:10.479> and<00:07:10.749> that<00:07:10.929> is<00:07:11.079> pretty

00:07:11.249 --> 00:07:11.259 
could an half time and that is pretty

00:07:11.259 --> 00:07:12.569 
could an half time and that is pretty
much<00:07:11.379> where<00:07:11.649> we're<00:07:11.799> going<00:07:11.919> to<00:07:11.979> end<00:07:12.099> off<00:07:12.369> this
