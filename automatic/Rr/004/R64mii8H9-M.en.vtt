00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 Hi there, this is a review of the game call of duty 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.940
 voice is also the tenth part of the series which 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.460
 go out from year to year and every time 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.200
 it turns out the same thing and it seems that 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.120
 this year finally even the most blind 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.719
 opened eyes now game is scolded by all 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.059
 who is not lazy 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:18.119
 like she is worse than the previous parts so on 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.920
 but personally, I go through all the parts according to tradition 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.960
 on the level of complexity veteran me all 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.970
 parts equally annoy the hydra each 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.920
 year in turn do different studios in 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.689
 this time did infinity ward 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.099
 means their favorite is here 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.470
 reception with endless waves of enemies 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.300
 which turn the passing game on 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.309
 veteran real torture but worth 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.079
 note that this time is real 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.969
 there were not so many hard moments 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.530
 the game was held that he was calm I even 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.600
 in some places I enjoyed thanks 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.789
 interesting beautiful scenes but not 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.039
 all levels in the game are cool therefore often 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.930
 have to shoot at brown enemies 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.640
 looking out on a brown background 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.100
 it's terribly boring especially level in 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.530
 space where enemies merge very much 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.180
 with surrounding objects and it is not clear who 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.199
 of them alive ptomel and because not all 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.609
 fly through the air 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.949
 developers had to come up with something 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.470
 to interest players 10 times and 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.540
 they believed their game with a dog 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.520
 riley said it was awesome cool i 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.689
 dog she will be with you all the time I 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.030
 thought it would be some kind of 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.530
 emotional connection with the dog like a bar 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.210
 arrows or brooch 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.100
 but in the end for the whole game we are visible times 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.049
 two for five to ten minutes that is it 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.689
 what a new feature nothing 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.520
 I think that's over ten 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.930
 years since u what the first part 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.909
 and almost nothing has changed they should 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.710
 tweaked a little engine direction and 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.540
 plot but why for all these years they are neither 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.369
 never improved artificial intelligence 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.990
 I don't care about stupid enemies anyway 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.390
 find early talk with one bullet and 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.340
 spain were smarter it was harder 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.020
 why allies are so stupid why 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.700
 never shoot at enemies 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.159
 that is, imagine a typical scene from 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.770
 this game you go ahead you see in the distance 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.229
 a bunch of enemies that endlessly arrive 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.119
 kill with one bullet and besides them you 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.189
 next helicopter your mates 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.380
 which do not want anything at all 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.000
 do and i don't like say you listen 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.159
 we know it won't be easy for you now 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.689
 saving far and we're not here 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.399
 helpers you will have to be all yourself 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.840
 kill and get ahead but doggie 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.520
 they shot you don't mind her just 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.619
 shabby and we'll just see we don't 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.259
 let us drag your problems yourself 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.920
 come on and you're looking for that dog kill you 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.959
 from and 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.340
 mad and what we are taught this game because 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:17.040
 that in this life you only have to rely 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.110
 on ourselves or the fact that we are all nothingness 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.880
 scale of the cosmos or because it is necessary 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.819
 survive animals to 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.680
 this did not come to what it is all for 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:28.380
 why can't I do wager 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.300
 co-op really for the whole game main 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.580
 the hero is left alone in only one 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.920
 level basically bypass your brother 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.569
 his detachment that prevents each time 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.280
 developers add morning opportunity 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:40.410
 pass the symbol together for you not to do 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.300
 some kind of separate cooperative mode 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.730
 they are the ones who don’t give new ones 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.560
 we go through and continue to rivet stupid 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.269
 bot okay in the last parts was 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.280
 some interesting plot before the collapse 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:51.989
 first and second now some general 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.150
 buddy on going on that is enemies 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:56.280
 captured a space station which 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.940
 shot metal all over the country 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.799
 rods 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.380
 and for this kind of like apocalypse on sort 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:03.299
 how here years later dofigischa enemies 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:06.840
 dofigischa soldiers some kind of regular 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:08.760
 world war and commands the enemies dude 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.950
 whom once betrayed his now he 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.480
 wants to kill them and what is all this nonsense 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.890
 and there it is going on in the district 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.720
 I really want to go into details but 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.549
 it's some kind of crap but it was 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.630
 several large spectacular scenes and the most 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:20.790
 the main thing for which I liked the game 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.510
 still a little more than the previous one 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.329
 several pieces 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:26.190
 because they improved grafon understand 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:27.870
 when you 're playing veteran 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.579
 you have to constantly crawl steaming in 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.410
 walls and and you see someone from the goalkeeper 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:33.420
 pulls puke in this part does not pull you 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:35.370
 vomit so very nice 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.320
 look all was smooth though it is not 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.970
 nikeskin, that is, I don’t say it is necessary from young 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.370
 gena will be able not fig not index gene 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.650
 but still compared to what was 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.570
 last year it is certainly a step forward 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.310
 unless of course and put the highest 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:48.840
 settings because everything is low 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.700
 looks the same as before but here 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.739
 another problem is revealed the game is terrible 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.660
 not optimized all that single 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:56.069
 weighs 30 gigs totally unjustified 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.930
 That is absolutely I do not know what they are 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:59.579
 spent 30 gigs so another game 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.190
 manages to slow down and most importantly 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:04.290
 lag sound especially videos she 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:06.840
 loaded level and no subtitles in the game 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.740
 for some reason, in general, we end up again 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.260
 got 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:12.090
 without ideological stupid shooting but this one 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.040
 since at least there are interesting levels 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.630
 that could be beautiful there, but I don't 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.760
 I think it's all worth it. 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:20.940
 players advise multiplayer i don't 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.320
 played because I help out this one 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.360
 the game is too popular for me to play 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.590
 absolutely everything is a bunch of new students 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.390
 a bunch of kids and 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:29.460
 from the fact that you're killing you all 

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:30.690
 get to the cliffs of satisfaction 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.070
 that is bent there all 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:34.290
 demonstrated his skill 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:36.180
 not a fig like that, that is, I prefer 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:37.860
 games smarter more difficult and if you want 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.630
 still quality war that is 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.240
 stomachs 44 which for several heads 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:44.430
 higher general call of duty goust i also 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.200
 didn't begin to play survival mode that is 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:48.240
 this is again some kind of zombie motor trails 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.740
 aliens instead of zombies I always 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.050
 considered the plant in Kaluga you so 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:54.060
 wretched that even the killing floor game is better 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.920
 what does he end up with today we rate only 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:58.260
 single you because of him i can put 

00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:02.660
 seven and a half chapter 10 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:02.660
 Thank you all for your attention until the Nile until
