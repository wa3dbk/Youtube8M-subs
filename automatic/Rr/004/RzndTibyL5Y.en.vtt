today<00:00:03.360> we're<00:00:03.510> going<00:00:03.629> to<00:00:03.720> be<00:00:03.899> talking<00:00:04.200> about

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:05.060 
today we're going to be talking about

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.880 
today we're going to be talking about
some<00:00:06.060> of<00:00:06.089> the<00:00:06.240> benefits<00:00:06.779> that<00:00:06.930> pavers<00:00:07.680> have

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
some of the benefits that pavers have

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.870 
some of the benefits that pavers have
over<00:00:08.460> traditional<00:00:09.679> materials<00:00:10.679> say<00:00:11.010> like

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
over traditional materials say like

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.259 
over traditional materials say like
asphalt<00:00:12.540> or<00:00:12.780> concrete<00:00:13.340> in<00:00:14.340> terms<00:00:14.730> of

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
asphalt or concrete in terms of

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.070 
asphalt or concrete in terms of
maintenance<00:00:15.690> and<00:00:15.900> you<00:00:16.049> care<00:00:17.750> aside<00:00:18.750> from<00:00:18.960> the

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
maintenance and you care aside from the

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.759 
maintenance and you care aside from the
aesthetic<00:00:19.619> value<00:00:19.650> of<00:00:20.340> pavers<00:00:21.470> pavers<00:00:22.470> come<00:00:22.650> in

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
aesthetic value of pavers pavers come in

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.779 
aesthetic value of pavers pavers come in
all<00:00:22.890> different<00:00:22.920> shapes<00:00:23.340> sizes<00:00:25.460> forms<00:00:26.460> you<00:00:26.670> can

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
all different shapes sizes forms you can

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.509 
all different shapes sizes forms you can
get<00:00:26.939> different<00:00:27.150> textures<00:00:27.750> on<00:00:28.080> there<00:00:28.519> so

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
get different textures on there so

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.479 
get different textures on there so
there's<00:00:29.699> a<00:00:29.789> lot<00:00:29.970> of<00:00:30.210> variability<00:00:31.219> within<00:00:32.219> this

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
there's a lot of variability within this

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.160 
there's a lot of variability within this
style<00:00:32.820> that<00:00:33.090> you<00:00:33.210> want<00:00:33.239> but<00:00:33.690> today<00:00:33.960> we're

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
style that you want but today we're

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.380 
style that you want but today we're
going<00:00:34.290> to<00:00:34.380> be<00:00:34.500> focusing<00:00:35.280> on<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.850> maintenance

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
going to be focusing on the maintenance

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.979 
going to be focusing on the maintenance
of<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.660> favors<00:00:38.180> as<00:00:39.180> you<00:00:39.329> can<00:00:39.540> see<00:00:39.750> here

of the favors as you can see here

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.170 
of the favors as you can see here
there's<00:00:40.170> some<00:00:40.500> damage<00:00:40.920> to<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.100> pavers<00:00:41.640> a

this dollhouse with this Bobcat machine

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.209 
this dollhouse with this Bobcat machine
over<00:00:51.750> this<00:00:51.899> area<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.559> there's<00:00:52.739> been<00:00:53.039> some

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
over this area and there's been some

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.380 
over this area and there's been some
damage<00:00:53.430> to<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.910> pavers<00:00:54.530> and<00:00:55.530> essentially

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
damage to the pavers and essentially

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.090 
damage to the pavers and essentially
really<00:00:57.390> all<00:00:57.629> you<00:00:57.750> need<00:00:57.780> to<00:00:58.050> do<00:00:58.230> to<00:00:58.500> fix

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
really all you need to do to fix

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.920 
really all you need to do to fix
something<00:00:59.430> like<00:00:59.760> this<00:00:59.969> if<00:01:00.149> you<00:01:00.510> have<00:01:00.629> a<00:01:00.660> paver

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
something like this if you have a paver

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.210 
something like this if you have a paver
walkway<00:01:01.050> or<00:01:01.739> a<00:01:01.770> driveway<00:01:02.190> or<00:01:02.730> a<00:01:03.059> patio<00:01:04.220> it's

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
walkway or a driveway or a patio it's

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.760 
walkway or a driveway or a patio it's
just<00:01:05.430> take<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.760> pavers<00:01:06.150> up<00:01:06.330> and<00:01:06.570> replace<00:01:07.500> the

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
just take the pavers up and replace the

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.710 
just take the pavers up and replace the
based<00:01:08.340> on<00:01:08.640> underneath<00:01:08.939> of<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.299> pavers<00:01:09.689> and

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
based on underneath of the pavers and

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.500 
based on underneath of the pavers and
put<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.080> pavers<00:01:10.439> back<00:01:10.650> in<00:01:10.860> place<00:01:11.100> and<00:01:11.510> it's

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
put the pavers back in place and it's

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.179 
put the pavers back in place and it's
just<00:01:12.659> a<00:01:12.780> great<00:01:12.990> advantage<00:01:13.350> of<00:01:13.619> our<00:01:13.740> concrete

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
just a great advantage of our concrete

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.499 
just a great advantage of our concrete
because<00:01:14.490> then<00:01:14.640> you<00:01:14.729> don't<00:01:14.820> have<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:15.000> worry

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
because then you don't have to worry

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.170 
because then you don't have to worry
about<00:01:15.659> cutting<00:01:16.110> anything<00:01:16.850> cutting<00:01:17.850> into<00:01:18.090> the

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
about cutting anything cutting into the

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.749 
about cutting anything cutting into the
concrete<00:01:18.630> cutting<00:01:19.080> into<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.409> asphalt<00:01:19.890> going

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
concrete cutting into the asphalt going

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.090 
concrete cutting into the asphalt going
out<00:01:20.909> and<00:01:21.060> buying<00:01:21.330> new<00:01:21.780> materials<00:01:22.650> to<00:01:22.799> patch

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
out and buying new materials to patch

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.210 
out and buying new materials to patch
that<00:01:23.369> up<00:01:23.580> and<00:01:24.320> you<00:01:25.320> know<00:01:25.409> that<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.830> time<00:01:26.070> it

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
that up and you know that the time it

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.490 
that up and you know that the time it
takes<00:01:26.250> to<00:01:26.759> do<00:01:26.970> something<00:01:27.570> like<00:01:27.780> this<00:01:28.170> to

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
takes to do something like this to

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.340 
takes to do something like this to
repair<00:01:29.130> pavers<00:01:29.640> is<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:30.270> fraction<00:01:30.900> of<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.170> time

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
repair pavers is a fraction of the time

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.190 
repair pavers is a fraction of the time
and<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:32.040> fraction<00:01:32.490> of<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.729> cost<00:01:33.000> so<00:01:33.329> again

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
and the fraction of the cost so again

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.200 
and the fraction of the cost so again
this<00:01:34.320> is<00:01:34.500> just<00:01:34.650> one<00:01:35.840> advantage<00:01:36.840> of<00:01:37.110> pavers<00:01:37.350> has

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
this is just one advantage of pavers has

over different materials and a lot of

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.420 
over different materials and a lot of
