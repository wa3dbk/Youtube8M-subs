00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.899 
click exit then back to 3d view and
you'll<00:01:33.450> see<00:01:33.780> if<00:01:34.350> i<00:01:34.530> zoom<00:01:34.799> out<00:01:35.009> that<00:01:35.280> you've<00:01:35.700> got

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
you'll see if i zoom out that you've got

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.940 
you'll see if i zoom out that you've got
all<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.210> points<00:01:36.540> out<00:01:36.689> information<00:01:37.380> here<00:01:37.799> as

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
all the points out information here as

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.440 
all the points out information here as
well<00:01:38.909> as<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.930> camera<00:01:40.920> that<00:01:41.159> is<00:01:41.310> plotted<00:01:42.240> to

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
well as the camera that is plotted to

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.249 
well as the camera that is plotted to
the<00:01:42.540> right<00:01:42.750> place

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
the right place

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.310 
the right place
so<00:01:43.619> if<00:01:43.680> I<00:01:43.770> hit<00:01:43.890> 0<00:01:43.950> on<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.520> numeric<00:01:44.700> keypad<00:01:45.479> then

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
so if I hit 0 on the numeric keypad then

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.510 
so if I hit 0 on the numeric keypad then
we're<00:01:46.590> in<00:01:46.619> camera<00:01:47.159> view<00:01:47.189> I<00:01:47.670> go<00:01:48.540> to<00:01:48.600> view

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
we're in camera view I go to view

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:44.890 
we'll move into top view add a plane so
this<00:02:42.749> is<00:02:42.900> a<00:02:43.139> floor<00:02:43.680> plane<00:02:44.040> that<00:02:44.459> we're<00:02:44.609> adding

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
this is a floor plane that we're adding

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.679 
this is a floor plane that we're adding
move<00:02:45.900> that<00:02:46.109> forward<00:02:46.500> of<00:02:46.680> the<00:02:46.829> camera<00:02:47.540> so<00:02:48.540> that

00:02:48.679 --> 00:02:48.689 
move that forward of the camera so that

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:55.849 
move that forward of the camera so that
we<00:02:48.810> can<00:02:49.019> see<00:02:49.699> back<00:02:50.699> into<00:02:52.639> back<00:02:53.639> into<00:02:54.859> camera

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:55.859 
we can see back into back into camera

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:59.629 
we can see back into back into camera
view<00:02:56.959> and<00:02:57.959> we'll<00:02:58.139> grab<00:02:58.560> that<00:02:58.769> floor<00:02:59.069> plane<00:02:59.370> and

00:02:59.629 --> 00:02:59.639 
view and we'll grab that floor plane and

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:02.780 
view and we'll grab that floor plane and
move<00:02:59.909> it<00:03:00.120> down<00:03:01.040> so<00:03:02.040> I'm<00:03:02.159> just<00:03:02.370> doing<00:03:02.549> this

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
move it down so I'm just doing this

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.890 
move it down so I'm just doing this
pretty<00:03:03.329> roughly<00:03:03.989> obviously<00:03:04.590> you<00:03:04.709> have<00:03:04.889> to

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
pretty roughly obviously you have to

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.839 
pretty roughly obviously you have to
create<00:03:06.900> it<00:03:07.079> so<00:03:07.109> that<00:03:07.530> the<00:03:07.769> perspective<00:03:08.129> is<00:03:08.519> all

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:08.849 
create it so that the perspective is all

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:11.539 
create it so that the perspective is all
correct<00:03:09.150> in<00:03:09.569> to<00:03:10.379> make<00:03:10.530> the<00:03:10.680> photograph<00:03:11.219> and

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549 
correct in to make the photograph and

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:16.659 
correct in to make the photograph and
then<00:03:12.000> I<00:03:12.680> go<00:03:13.680> to<00:03:13.739> the<00:03:14.040> shading<00:03:14.579> button<00:03:14.819> add<00:03:15.379> new

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:16.669 
then I go to the shading button add new

00:03:16.669 --> 00:03:20.509 
then I go to the shading button add new
go<00:03:17.669> to<00:03:17.699> the<00:03:18.090> shaders<00:03:18.659> tab<00:03:19.049> and<00:03:19.379> click<00:03:20.099> only

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
go to the shaders tab and click only

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:25.429 
go to the shaders tab and click only
shared<00:03:22.699> okay<00:03:23.699> and<00:03:24.000> what<00:03:24.479> that<00:03:24.689> does<00:03:24.959> basically

00:03:25.429 --> 00:03:25.439 
shared okay and what that does basically

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:29.659 
shared okay and what that does basically
it'll<00:03:26.189> make<00:03:26.609> the<00:03:27.500> floor<00:03:28.500> only<00:03:29.220> render<00:03:29.579> the

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:29.669 
it'll make the floor only render the

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:31.580 
it'll make the floor only render the
shadow<00:03:29.939> it<00:03:30.299> won't<00:03:30.509> render<00:03:30.750> the<00:03:30.959> actual<00:03:31.319> floor

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
shadow it won't render the actual floor

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.740 
shadow it won't render the actual floor
so<00:03:31.979> you'll<00:03:32.159> get<00:03:32.340> the<00:03:32.459> shadow<00:03:32.729> falling<00:03:33.209> on<00:03:33.479> to

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
so you'll get the shadow falling on to

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.129 
so you'll get the shadow falling on to
the<00:03:33.930> photograph<00:03:34.650> quite<00:03:34.979> nicely<00:03:35.220> and<00:03:35.900> then<00:03:36.900> the

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:37.139 
the photograph quite nicely and then the

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:41.089 
the photograph quite nicely and then the
next<00:03:37.439> thing<00:03:37.590> that<00:03:37.769> we<00:03:37.859> do<00:03:38.069> is<00:03:38.629> create<00:03:39.629> a<00:03:40.290> 3d

00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:41.099 
next thing that we do is create a 3d

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:43.240 
next thing that we do is create a 3d
object<00:03:41.189> I'll<00:03:41.759> just<00:03:41.970> use<00:03:42.180> the<00:03:42.389> good-old<00:03:42.659> cube

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
object I'll just use the good-old cube

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:48.319 
object I'll just use the good-old cube
move<00:03:44.250> that<00:03:44.519> into<00:03:44.729> the<00:03:45.000> scene<00:03:45.530> again<00:03:47.329> just

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.329 
move that into the scene again just

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:55.330 
move that into the scene again just
bring<00:03:48.810> it<00:03:48.989> down<00:03:49.019> a<00:03:49.349> wee<00:03:49.799> bit<00:03:51.019> like<00:03:52.019> so

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.790 

and<00:03:56.340> then<00:03:57.030> what<00:03:57.300> I<00:03:57.330> need<00:03:57.510> to<00:03:57.750> do<00:03:57.900> is<00:03:58.170> to<00:03:58.560> create

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800 
and then what I need to do is to create

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.630 
and then what I need to do is to create
a<00:03:59.220> lamp<00:03:59.720> so<00:04:00.720> that<00:04:00.960> we<00:04:01.080> can<00:04:01.290> have<00:04:01.560> the<00:04:02.310> shadow

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
a lamp so that we can have the shadow

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.880 
a lamp so that we can have the shadow
generated<00:04:03.450> obviously<00:04:03.960> off<00:04:04.080> the<00:04:04.230> lamp<00:04:04.470> so<00:04:04.710> I'll

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
generated obviously off the lamp so I'll

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:11.710 
generated obviously off the lamp so I'll
move<00:04:05.100> there<00:04:05.400> over<00:04:06.180> the<00:04:06.300> top<00:04:06.600> of<00:04:07.340> the<00:04:09.710> cube<00:04:10.710> and

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 
move there over the top of the cube and

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.090 
move there over the top of the cube and
move<00:04:12.720> it<00:04:12.840> up<00:04:12.930> a<00:04:13.080> wee<00:04:13.230> bit<00:04:13.440> so<00:04:13.710> that<00:04:13.740> this

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100 
move it up a wee bit so that this

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.039 
move it up a wee bit so that this
imitates<00:04:14.670> basically<00:04:15.210> the<00:04:15.360> daylight<00:04:15.810> in<00:04:16.020> the

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
imitates basically the daylight in the

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:22.130 
imitates basically the daylight in the
scene<00:04:17.420> so<00:04:18.420> now<00:04:18.810> if<00:04:19.260> we<00:04:19.320> were<00:04:20.070> to<00:04:20.660> click<00:04:21.660> render

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
scene so now if we were to click render

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:30.890 
scene so now if we were to click render
current<00:04:23.070> frame<00:04:25.610> you<00:04:26.610> can<00:04:26.790> see<00:04:29.300> it's<00:04:30.300> not<00:04:30.540> quite

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
current frame you can see it's not quite

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:35.450 
current frame you can see it's not quite
there<00:04:31.200> I<00:04:32.960> didn't<00:04:33.960> actually<00:04:34.140> enable<00:04:34.860> shadows

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
there I didn't actually enable shadows

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.540 
there I didn't actually enable shadows
in<00:04:35.820> the<00:04:36.120> lamp<00:04:36.390> so<00:04:36.600> you<00:04:36.750> click<00:04:36.990> ray<00:04:37.260> shadow<00:04:37.650> the

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550 
in the lamp so you click ray shadow the

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.870 
in the lamp so you click ray shadow the
soft<00:04:38.910> size<00:04:39.210> we<00:04:39.510> want<00:04:39.690> point<00:04:40.110> five<00:04:40.500> and<00:04:41.040> the

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
soft size we want point five and the

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:48.290 
soft size we want point five and the
samples<00:04:42.680> ten<00:04:45.200> then<00:04:46.200> if<00:04:46.590> we<00:04:47.040> render<00:04:47.610> the

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 
samples ten then if we render the

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.610 
samples ten then if we render the
current<00:04:48.720> frame<00:04:50.150> you<00:04:51.150> can<00:04:51.330> see<00:04:51.630> that<00:04:52.110> the<00:04:52.260> cube

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
current frame you can see that the cube

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:58.490 
current frame you can see that the cube
is<00:04:53.130> sitting<00:04:54.260> there<00:04:55.260> and<00:04:55.680> it's<00:04:57.230> created<00:04:58.230> a<00:04:58.350> nice

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
is sitting there and it's created a nice

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:03.440 
is sitting there and it's created a nice
shadow<00:04:58.890> on<00:04:59.280> the<00:04:59.730> road<00:04:59.940> and<00:05:00.860> that's<00:05:02.450> basically

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:03.450 
shadow on the road and that's basically

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:09.290 
shadow on the road and that's basically
how<00:05:03.870> you<00:05:04.370> composite<00:05:05.370> live-action<00:05:06.180> in<00:05:06.420> blender
