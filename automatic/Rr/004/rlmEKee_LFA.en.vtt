00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:51.899 
the front of the body this can be a
little<00:01:50.319> tricky<00:01:50.740> since<00:01:50.979> the<00:01:51.189> back<00:01:51.369> is<00:01:51.579> a<00:01:51.610> little

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:51.909 
little tricky since the back is a little

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:53.819 
little tricky since the back is a little
bit<00:01:52.030> bigger<00:01:52.239> than<00:01:52.479> the<00:01:52.629> front<00:01:52.810> so<00:01:53.349> focus<00:01:53.709> on

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:53.829 
bit bigger than the front so focus on

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:56.550 
bit bigger than the front so focus on
pinning<00:01:54.219> the<00:01:54.340> sides<00:01:54.579> to<00:01:54.909> get<00:01:55.060> it<00:01:55.149> even<00:01:55.560> then

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
pinning the sides to get it even then

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.740 
pinning the sides to get it even then
gather<00:01:56.890> the<00:01:56.979> middle<00:01:57.340> and<00:01:57.520> pin<00:01:58.030> it<00:01:58.149> down<00:01:58.179> so<00:01:58.719> you

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
gather the middle and pin it down so you

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.479 
gather the middle and pin it down so you
can<00:01:58.869> easily<00:01:59.439> run<00:01:59.709> the<00:01:59.979> body<00:02:00.159> through<00:02:00.459> the

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:00.489 
can easily run the body through the

00:02:00.489 --> 00:02:05.970 
can easily run the body through the
sewing<00:02:00.789> machine

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:05.980 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.400 

here<00:02:06.640> you'll<00:02:06.910> just<00:02:07.150> be<00:02:07.330> sewing<00:02:07.690> the<00:02:07.930> left<00:02:08.170> and

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
here you'll just be sewing the left and

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.410 
here you'll just be sewing the left and
the<00:02:08.560> right<00:02:08.740> of<00:02:08.920> the<00:02:09.040> body<00:02:09.220> this<00:02:10.150> will<00:02:10.330> be

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
the right of the body this will be

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.060 
the right of the body this will be
easier<00:02:10.780> if<00:02:10.960> you<00:02:11.050> have<00:02:11.140> the<00:02:11.260> back<00:02:11.440> facing<00:02:11.890> you

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.070 
easier if you have the back facing you

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:20.400 
easier if you have the back facing you
to<00:02:12.310> see<00:02:12.490> where<00:02:12.640> to<00:02:12.730> start<00:02:12.970> and<00:02:13.060> stop<00:02:13.330> now<00:02:19.410> it's

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
to see where to start and stop now it's

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.920 
to see where to start and stop now it's
time<00:02:20.590> for<00:02:20.620> the<00:02:20.860> but<00:02:21.150> it's<00:02:22.150> easier<00:02:22.510> to<00:02:22.630> pin<00:02:22.810> the

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
time for the but it's easier to pin the

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.810 
time for the but it's easier to pin the
feet<00:02:23.140> first<00:02:23.410> so<00:02:23.800> line<00:02:24.040> up<00:02:24.070> your<00:02:24.340> pattern<00:02:24.550> and

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
feet first so line up your pattern and

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:30.030 
feet first so line up your pattern and
pin<00:02:27.390> with<00:02:28.390> that<00:02:28.630> gather<00:02:29.080> the<00:02:29.350> back<00:02:29.530> and<00:02:29.800> pin

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
pin with that gather the back and pin

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.200 
pin with that gather the back and pin
along<00:02:30.280> the<00:02:30.730> rounded<00:02:31.120> part<00:02:31.330> of<00:02:31.420> the<00:02:31.540> bottom

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.210 
along the rounded part of the bottom

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.880 
along the rounded part of the bottom
then<00:02:34.210> again<00:02:34.600> I<00:02:34.780> just<00:02:34.840> gathered<00:02:35.500> the<00:02:35.650> middle

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
then again I just gathered the middle

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.350 
then again I just gathered the middle
and<00:02:36.100> pinned<00:02:36.340> it<00:02:36.460> so<00:02:36.730> wouldn't<00:02:37.030> be<00:02:37.120> in<00:02:37.210> the<00:02:37.330> way

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
and pinned it so wouldn't be in the way

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.550 
and pinned it so wouldn't be in the way
while<00:02:37.630> sewing<00:02:39.630> you'll<00:02:40.630> sew<00:02:40.840> this<00:02:41.020> part<00:02:41.350> all

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
while sewing you'll sew this part all

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.740 
while sewing you'll sew this part all
the<00:02:41.590> way<00:02:41.950> around<00:02:42.250> no<00:02:42.550> openings<00:02:45.150> ok<00:02:46.150> set<00:02:46.600> that

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
the way around no openings ok set that

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.930 
the way around no openings ok set that
aside<00:02:46.900> and<00:02:47.290> grab<00:02:47.470> the<00:02:47.620> front<00:02:47.770> of<00:02:47.890> the<00:02:47.980> head<00:02:48.130> the

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
aside and grab the front of the head the

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.390 
aside and grab the front of the head the
one<00:02:49.090> missing<00:02:49.330> the<00:02:49.630> little<00:02:49.840> gap<00:02:50.020> at<00:02:50.200> the<00:02:50.230> top

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
one missing the little gap at the top

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.920 
one missing the little gap at the top
you'll<00:02:51.400> fold<00:02:51.700> this<00:02:51.850> in<00:02:52.030> half<00:02:52.060> and<00:02:52.480> sew<00:02:52.750> along

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
you'll fold this in half and sew along

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.490 
you'll fold this in half and sew along
that<00:02:53.290> diagonal<00:02:53.650> line<00:02:54.840> once<00:02:55.840> that's<00:02:56.110> complete

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
that diagonal line once that's complete

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.100 
that diagonal line once that's complete
put<00:02:57.010> your<00:02:57.160> machine<00:02:57.550> aside<00:02:57.940> for<00:02:58.180> a<00:02:58.210> moment<00:02:58.390> for

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
bit easier by pushing the stick into the

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.800 
bit easier by pushing the stick into the
straw<00:03:50.500> and<00:03:50.740> rolling<00:03:51.730> the<00:03:51.850> felt<00:03:52.090> down<00:03:52.420> and

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
towards the top of the chopstick this is

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.420 
towards the top of the chopstick this is
really<00:03:55.360> hard<00:03:55.600> to<00:03:55.660> explain<00:03:55.959> just<00:03:56.950> get<00:03:57.160> it<00:03:57.280> right

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430
