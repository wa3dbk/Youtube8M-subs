in<00:00:23.130> this<00:00:23.310> issue<00:00:23.519> we've<00:00:23.820> hooked<00:00:23.970> up<00:00:24.150> with<00:00:24.269> goes

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
in this issue we've hooked up with goes

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.450 
in this issue we've hooked up with goes
fast<00:00:24.840> bits<00:00:25.140> to<00:00:25.560> get<00:00:25.710> a<00:00:25.740> couple<00:00:26.010> of<00:00:26.099> goodies<00:00:26.279> to

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
fast bits to get a couple of goodies to

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.580 
fast bits to get a couple of goodies to
the<00:00:26.580> car<00:00:26.789> now<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.420> hybrid<00:00:27.869> intercooler<00:00:28.349> kit

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
the car now the hybrid intercooler kit

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.589 
the car now the hybrid intercooler kit
didn't<00:00:28.920> come<00:00:29.070> with<00:00:29.220> a<00:00:29.279> ball<00:00:29.490> valve<00:00:29.519> so<00:00:30.300> we<00:00:30.390> made

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
didn't come with a ball valve so we made

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.690 
didn't come with a ball valve so we made
sure<00:00:30.630> we<00:00:30.840> pick<00:00:31.019> one<00:00:31.230> of<00:00:31.349> those<00:00:31.470> up<00:00:31.529> we<00:00:32.219> also<00:00:32.430> got

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
sure we pick one of those up we also got

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.520 
sure we pick one of those up we also got

out<00:01:29.619> but<00:01:29.860> you<00:01:29.950> do<00:01:30.100> have<00:01:30.220> to<00:01:30.340> obviously<00:01:30.670> wire<00:01:30.910> up

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
out but you do have to obviously wire up

out but you do have to obviously wire up
the<00:01:31.149> controller<00:01:31.539> which<00:01:32.050> all<00:01:32.200> you<00:01:32.320> need<00:01:32.470> is<00:01:32.590> a

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:32.619 
the controller which all you need is a

positive and an earth so rather simple

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.350 
positive and an earth so rather simple
job<00:01:34.960> now<00:01:35.530> set<00:01:35.860> to<00:01:35.890> full<00:01:36.280> quiet<00:01:36.670> and<00:01:37.090> works

can't hear the thing at all
of<00:01:41.830> course<00:01:42.070> you<00:01:42.190> still<00:01:42.250> get<00:01:42.520> the<00:01:42.610> same<00:01:42.789> sort<00:01:42.970> of

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
of course you still get the same sort of

of course you still get the same sort of
noise<00:01:43.270> as<00:01:43.450> you<00:01:43.479> do<00:01:43.660> out<00:01:43.780> of<00:01:43.810> the<00:01:43.929> filters<00:01:44.289> if
