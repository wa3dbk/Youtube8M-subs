so<00:04:41.900> I've<00:04:42.350> actually<00:04:42.590> had<00:04:42.949> these<00:04:43.220> before<00:04:43.370> but

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:43.790 
so I've actually had these before but

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:46.330 
so I've actually had these before but
not<00:04:44.419> this<00:04:44.479> particular<00:04:45.139> brand<00:04:45.830> but<00:04:46.040> I've<00:04:46.160> had

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:46.340 
not this particular brand but I've had

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.189 
not this particular brand but I've had
the<00:04:46.490> ones<00:04:46.699> where<00:04:46.880> it's<00:04:46.910> act<00:04:47.270> like<00:04:47.570> actual<00:04:47.990> tape

00:04:48.189 --> 00:04:48.199 
the ones where it's act like actual tape

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:49.840 
the ones where it's act like actual tape
dispenser<00:04:48.680> and<00:04:48.800> just<00:04:49.010> rip<00:04:49.130> it<00:04:49.160> off<00:04:49.430> and<00:04:49.460> then

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:49.850 
dispenser and just rip it off and then

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:51.100 
dispenser and just rip it off and then
you<00:04:50.090> know<00:04:50.180> stick<00:04:50.419> it<00:04:50.540> wherever<00:04:50.690> you<00:04:50.930> need<00:04:50.960> it

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110 
you know stick it wherever you need it

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.680 
you know stick it wherever you need it
and<00:04:51.490> I<00:04:52.490> thought<00:04:52.669> that<00:04:52.729> Ross<00:04:53.150> and<00:04:53.449> those<00:04:53.570> are

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:53.690 
and I thought that Ross and those are

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:56.670 
and I thought that Ross and those are
really<00:04:53.780> cheap<00:04:54.020> and<00:04:54.199> these<00:04:54.650> it<00:04:55.010> says<00:04:55.669> its

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 
really cheap and these it says its

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.560 
really cheap and these it says its
twenty<00:04:57.680> four<00:04:57.979> strips<00:04:58.340> of<00:04:58.520> ten<00:04:58.760> dollars<00:04:59.180> and<00:04:59.479> I

00:04:59.560 --> 00:04:59.570 
twenty four strips of ten dollars and I

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:01.780 
twenty four strips of ten dollars and I
believe<00:04:59.900> that<00:04:59.930> a<00:05:00.380> whole<00:05:00.800> tape<00:05:01.340> dispenser

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:01.790 
believe that a whole tape dispenser

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:03.310 
believe that a whole tape dispenser
thing<00:05:01.910> was<00:05:02.060> only<00:05:02.300> like<00:05:02.419> three<00:05:02.900> or<00:05:03.050> something

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:03.320 
thing was only like three or something

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:06.940 
thing was only like three or something
so<00:05:03.770> I<00:05:04.010> probably<00:05:04.790> won't<00:05:05.030> buy<00:05:05.300> this<00:05:05.950> just

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:06.950 
so I probably won't buy this just

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:09.460 
so I probably won't buy this just
because<00:05:07.100> I<00:05:07.220> found<00:05:07.460> like<00:05:07.850> cheaper<00:05:08.360> stuff<00:05:09.260> that

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:09.470 
because I found like cheaper stuff that

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:12.250 
because I found like cheaper stuff that
Ross<00:05:10.330> and<00:05:11.330> then<00:05:11.479> another<00:05:11.660> thing<00:05:11.900> that<00:05:12.050> comes

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:12.260 
Ross and then another thing that comes

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.890 
Ross and then another thing that comes
