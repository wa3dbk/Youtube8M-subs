mean to had to make sure that my waist

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:57.470 
mean to had to make sure that my waist
had<00:01:56.520> baby<00:01:56.700> airs<00:01:56.909> because<00:01:57.119> it

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:57.480 
had baby airs because it

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.860 
had baby airs because it
really<00:01:57.720> do<00:01:57.840> much<00:01:58.050> it<00:01:58.350> kind<00:01:58.590> of<00:01:59.540> in<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:00.600> way

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:00.870 
really do much it kind of in the way

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.970 
really do much it kind of in the way
 is<00:02:01.440> funky<00:02:01.860> because<00:02:02.220> it<00:02:03.090> creates<00:02:03.390> this

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:03.980 
 is funky because it creates this

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:06.980 
 is funky because it creates this
freaky<00:02:04.980> look<00:02:05.220> but<00:02:05.580> whatever<00:02:06.330> but<00:02:06.570> that's<00:02:06.600> just

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
freaky look but whatever but that's just

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.350 
freaky look but whatever but that's just
like<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.350> top<00:02:07.680> of<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:07.950> wig<00:02:08.130> and<00:02:08.550> what<00:02:09.270> it

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
like the top of the wig and what it

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.170 
like the top of the wig and what it
looks<00:02:09.540> like<00:02:09.720> on<00:02:10.250> my<00:02:11.250> forehead<00:02:11.520> you<00:02:11.910> can<00:02:12.030> see

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
looks like on my forehead you can see

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.060 
looks like on my forehead you can see
the<00:02:12.270> grid<00:02:12.450> if<00:02:12.540> I<00:02:12.630> get<00:02:12.780> really<00:02:12.900> close<00:02:13.170> but<00:02:13.500> it

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.070 
the grid if I get really close but it

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.310 
the grid if I get really close but it
blends<00:02:14.400> pretty<00:02:14.670> good<00:02:14.880> with<00:02:15.000> my<00:02:15.150> hair<00:02:15.360> now<00:02:16.140> it's

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
blends pretty good with my hair now it's

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.640 
blends pretty good with my hair now it's
like<00:02:16.440> a<00:02:16.500> it's<00:02:16.860> like<00:02:17.040> a<00:02:17.130> body<00:02:17.490> wave<00:02:18.080> it's<00:02:19.080> longer

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
like a it's like a body wave it's longer

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.410 
like a it's like a body wave it's longer
much<00:02:20.130> much<00:02:20.340> longer<00:02:20.580> than<00:02:20.700> I<00:02:20.850> expected<00:02:20.970> it<00:02:21.330> to

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
much much longer than I expected it to

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.710 
much much longer than I expected it to
be<00:02:21.510> um<00:02:22.400> it<00:02:23.400> comes<00:02:23.610> like<00:02:23.730> down<00:02:24.000> past<00:02:24.270> my<00:02:24.450> chest

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
be um it comes like down past my chest

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.260 
be um it comes like down past my chest
so<00:02:24.930> I<00:02:24.960> would<00:02:25.140> say<00:02:25.170> this<00:02:25.380> is<00:02:25.440> it<00:02:25.680> maybe<00:02:26.060> 1820<00:02:27.060> I

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
so I would say this is it maybe 1820 I

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.740 
so I would say this is it maybe 1820 I
think<00:02:27.750> maybe<00:02:27.870> a<00:02:27.960> 2022<00:02:28.650> even<00:02:29.040> it's<00:02:29.940> a<00:02:30.060> very<00:02:30.300> big

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
think maybe a 2022 even it's a very big

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.720 
think maybe a 2022 even it's a very big

insert some pictures in here of when i
first<00:03:34.349> took<00:03:34.470> it<00:03:34.590> up<00:03:34.680> package<00:03:35.579> so<00:03:35.730> you<00:03:35.790> can<00:03:35.939> see

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
first took it up package so you can see

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.339 
first took it up package so you can see
what<00:03:36.150> it<00:03:36.269> looks<00:03:36.299> like<00:03:36.569> before<00:03:36.930> you<00:03:36.989> combed<00:03:37.260> it

00:03:37.339 --> 00:03:37.349 
what it looks like before you combed it

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:41.000 
what it looks like before you combed it
out<00:03:37.470> because<00:03:37.590> this<00:03:37.769> is<00:03:37.920> like<00:03:38.069> me<00:03:39.680> after<00:03:40.680> i

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
out because this is like me after i

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:48.990 
out because this is like me after i
brushed<00:03:41.340> it<00:03:42.920> so<00:03:43.920> you

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.350 

the<00:03:49.810> most<00:03:50.140> I'm<00:03:50.290> doing<00:03:50.620> a<00:03:50.680> video<00:03:51.240> when<00:03:52.240> you

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:52.360 
the most I'm doing a video when you

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:59.590 
the most I'm doing a video when you
brush<00:03:52.570> it<00:03:52.630> it<00:03:52.870> becomes<00:03:53.050> a<00:03:53.230> big<00:03:54.360> thick<00:03:55.360> body

00:03:59.590 --> 00:03:59.600 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.870 

so<00:04:00.200> when<00:04:00.620> you<00:04:00.740> brush<00:04:00.890> it<00:04:00.950> it<00:04:01.310> just<00:04:01.340> gets<00:04:01.670> really

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:01.880 
so when you brush it it just gets really

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.540 
so when you brush it it just gets really
thick<00:04:02.350> and<00:04:03.350> it<00:04:03.740> looks<00:04:03.860> like<00:04:03.980> the<00:04:04.100> curls<00:04:04.340> died

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:04.550 
thick and it looks like the curls died

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:06.460 
thick and it looks like the curls died
out<00:04:04.760> but<00:04:04.910> they<00:04:05.000> don't<00:04:05.240> they<00:04:05.570> just<00:04:05.810> bounce<00:04:06.200> back

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
out but they don't they just bounce back

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:09.070 
out but they don't they just bounce back
up<00:04:06.650> into<00:04:06.920> whatever<00:04:07.450> style<00:04:08.450> you<00:04:08.600> would<00:04:08.720> have<00:04:08.900> it

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:09.080 
up into whatever style you would have it

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.410 
up into whatever style you would have it
in<00:04:09.230> oh<00:04:09.500> yeah<00:04:10.400> and<00:04:10.610> one<00:04:10.790> thing<00:04:10.940> I<00:04:11.000> did<00:04:11.150> forget<00:04:11.360> to

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 
in oh yeah and one thing I did forget to

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.900 
in oh yeah and one thing I did forget to
mention<00:04:11.510> this<00:04:12.440> hair<00:04:12.710> has<00:04:12.860> a<00:04:12.890> tendency<00:04:13.280> to<00:04:13.490> wrap

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:13.910 
mention this hair has a tendency to wrap

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:15.430 
mention this hair has a tendency to wrap
the<00:04:14.150> curls<00:04:14.420> wrap<00:04:14.630> around<00:04:14.900> itself<00:04:15.200> so

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 
the curls wrap around itself so

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.060 
the curls wrap around itself so
whichever<00:04:15.740> way<00:04:15.920> you<00:04:15.980> do<00:04:16.250> it<00:04:16.280> it's<00:04:17.060> gonna<00:04:18.070> it's

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
whichever way you do it it's gonna it's

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:23.950 
whichever way you do it it's gonna it's
gonna<00:04:20.739> the<00:04:21.739> crows<00:04:22.010> will<00:04:22.540> even<00:04:23.540> so<00:04:23.690> it<00:04:23.780> might

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 
gonna the crows will even so it might

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.230 
gonna the crows will even so it might
