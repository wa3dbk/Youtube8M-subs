that's a little of everything for you
today<00:00:09.380> I<00:00:09.500> thought<00:00:09.860> I'd<00:00:10.040> do<00:00:10.130> a<00:00:10.160> quick<00:00:10.280> video<00:00:10.760> on

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:11.090 
today I thought I'd do a quick video on

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:15.340 
today I thought I'd do a quick video on
if<00:00:11.930> you<00:00:12.110> happen<00:00:12.380> to<00:00:12.440> have<00:00:12.620> one<00:00:13.460> of<00:00:13.550> these<00:00:14.350> that

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:15.350 
if you happen to have one of these that

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:17.980 
if you happen to have one of these that
is<00:00:15.410> a<00:00:16.010> Samsung<00:00:16.820> Galaxy<00:00:17.269> gear<00:00:17.300> this<00:00:17.720> is<00:00:17.900> the

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:17.990 
is a Samsung Galaxy gear this is the

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:20.050 
is a Samsung Galaxy gear this is the
first-generation<00:00:18.289> one<00:00:18.920> they<00:00:19.070> have<00:00:19.250> a<00:00:19.580> couple

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:20.060 
first-generation one they have a couple

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:21.460 
first-generation one they have a couple
more<00:00:20.240> after<00:00:20.600> that<00:00:20.630> but<00:00:20.900> I'm<00:00:20.990> assuming<00:00:21.200> this

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:21.470 
more after that but I'm assuming this

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.100 
more after that but I'm assuming this
will<00:00:21.590> work<00:00:21.740> for<00:00:22.100> the<00:00:22.340> new<00:00:22.490> generations<00:00:23.000> too

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:24.110 
will work for the new generations too

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:26.980 
will work for the new generations too
the<00:00:24.470> problem<00:00:24.860> that<00:00:24.890> I<00:00:25.010> had<00:00:25.330> was<00:00:26.330> I<00:00:26.510> had<00:00:26.750> I

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:26.990 
the problem that I had was I had I

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:28.390 
the problem that I had was I had I
wasn't<00:00:27.440> using<00:00:27.590> this<00:00:27.800> for<00:00:28.010> a<00:00:28.039> little<00:00:28.160> while<00:00:28.279> I

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:28.400 
wasn't using this for a little while I

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.250 
wasn't using this for a little while I
was<00:00:28.640> off<00:00:28.850> work<00:00:28.880> I<00:00:29.240> mainly<00:00:29.420> use<00:00:29.630> it<00:00:29.779> for<00:00:29.930> work<00:00:30.080> so

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:30.260 
was off work I mainly use it for work so

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:31.630 
was off work I mainly use it for work so
I<00:00:30.320> can<00:00:30.500> hear<00:00:30.680> text<00:00:30.890> messages<00:00:31.400> phone<00:00:31.580> calls

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640 
I can hear text messages phone calls

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.139 
I can hear text messages phone calls
whatever<00:00:32.180> I<00:00:32.989> was<00:00:33.829> not<00:00:34.010> charging<00:00:34.460> it<00:00:34.579> so<00:00:35.030> it

00:00:35.139 --> 00:00:35.149 
whatever I was not charging it so it

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:37.299 
whatever I was not charging it so it
when<00:00:35.359> did<00:00:35.569> I<00:00:35.870> just<00:00:36.530> assumed<00:00:36.890> when<00:00:37.069> I<00:00:37.129> was<00:00:37.219> going

00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:37.309 
when did I just assumed when I was going

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:38.680 
when did I just assumed when I was going
to<00:00:37.399> go<00:00:37.460> back<00:00:37.609> to<00:00:37.760> work<00:00:37.909> I<00:00:38.089> charge<00:00:38.390> it<00:00:38.539> back<00:00:38.629> up

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:38.690 
to go back to work I charge it back up

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:40.209 
to go back to work I charge it back up
and<00:00:39.019> everything<00:00:39.409> would<00:00:39.710> be<00:00:39.739> fine

00:00:40.209 --> 00:00:40.219 
and everything would be fine

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:42.489 
and everything would be fine
apparently<00:00:41.179> that<00:00:41.269> wasn't<00:00:41.449> the<00:00:41.629> case<00:00:41.749> when<00:00:42.440> I

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:42.499 
apparently that wasn't the case when I

00:00:42.499 --> 00:00:44.259 
apparently that wasn't the case when I
plug<00:00:43.039> it<00:00:43.159> in<00:00:43.339> I<00:00:43.460> had<00:00:43.579> to<00:00:43.670> plug<00:00:43.819> in<00:00:43.969> for<00:00:44.120> a<00:00:44.149> whole

00:00:44.259 --> 00:00:44.269 
plug it in I had to plug in for a whole

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:46.119 
plug it in I had to plug in for a whole
day<00:00:44.479> went<00:00:45.170> back<00:00:45.319> and<00:00:45.469> looked<00:00:45.589> at<00:00:45.769> it<00:00:45.920> and<00:00:46.039> the

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:46.129 
day went back and looked at it and the

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:47.860 
day went back and looked at it and the
screen<00:00:46.370> was<00:00:46.519> still<00:00:46.699> completely<00:00:47.389> blank<00:00:47.629> I

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 
screen was still completely blank I

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.259 
screen was still completely blank I
tried<00:00:48.589> a<00:00:48.620> whole<00:00:49.460> variety<00:00:49.670> of<00:00:50.089> different

00:00:50.259 --> 00:00:50.269 
tried a whole variety of different

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:52.419 
tried a whole variety of different
clicks<00:00:50.989> on<00:00:51.260> the<00:00:51.379> little<00:00:51.589> power<00:00:51.859> button<00:00:52.219> on<00:00:52.280> the

00:00:52.419 --> 00:00:52.429 
clicks on the little power button on the

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:54.489 
clicks on the little power button on the
side<00:00:52.639> nothing<00:00:53.359> would<00:00:53.659> get<00:00:53.780> it<00:00:53.899> to<00:00:53.989> come<00:00:54.139> up<00:00:54.170> so

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:54.499 
side nothing would get it to come up so

00:00:54.499 --> 00:00:57.009

tried is getting a different USB mini
USB<00:01:52.760> plug<00:01:53.330> not<00:01:54.260> the<00:01:54.380> one<00:01:54.530> that<00:01:54.650> came<00:01:54.800> with<00:01:54.830> it

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
USB plug not the one that came with it

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.870 
USB plug not the one that came with it
and<00:01:55.310> then<00:01:56.000> I<00:01:56.030> used<00:01:56.390> my<00:01:56.720> iPad<00:01:57.680> charging<00:01:58.640> block

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
and then I used my iPad charging block

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.050 
and then I used my iPad charging block
and<00:01:59.240> tried<00:01:59.840> to<00:01:59.930> charge<00:02:00.110> it<00:02:00.290> that<00:02:00.440> way<00:02:00.590> just

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
and tried to charge it that way just

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.620 
and tried to charge it that way just
plugging<00:02:02.060> it<00:02:02.150> into<00:02:02.300> the<00:02:02.390> wall

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
plugging it into the wall

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.530 
plugging it into the wall
and<00:02:02.900> that<00:02:03.440> didn't<00:02:03.680> work<00:02:03.800> either<00:02:04.100> so<00:02:04.970> the<00:02:05.360> last

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:05.540 
and that didn't work either so the last

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.309 
and that didn't work either so the last
thing<00:02:05.750> I<00:02:05.870> tried<00:02:06.170> was<00:02:06.500> just<00:02:06.860> using<00:02:07.130> a<00:02:08.110> mini<00:02:09.110> USB
