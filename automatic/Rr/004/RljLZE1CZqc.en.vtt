00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.680 
hello I'm going to be teaching you how
to<00:00:12.420> kickflip<00:00:13.080> on<00:00:13.440> a<00:00:14.040> fingerboard<00:00:14.519> I<00:00:15.000> know<00:00:15.450> that

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
to kickflip on a fingerboard I know that

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.810 
to kickflip on a fingerboard I know that
sounds<00:00:16.020> weird<00:00:16.170> to<00:00:16.320> say<00:00:16.440> that<00:00:16.820> figure

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
sounds weird to say that figure

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.340 
sounds weird to say that figure
positioning<00:00:18.420> is<00:00:18.539> really<00:00:18.810> important<00:00:19.289> because

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
positioning is really important because

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.570 
positioning is really important because
it's<00:00:19.890> not<00:00:20.460> a<00:00:20.490> skateboard<00:00:21.420> so<00:00:21.660> it's<00:00:21.810> not<00:00:21.990> like

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:22.580 
it's not a skateboard so it's not like

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:27.140 
it's not a skateboard so it's not like
really<00:00:23.580> detailed<00:00:24.199> positions<00:00:25.730> and<00:00:26.730> like

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
really detailed positions and like

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.240 
really detailed positions and like
pretty<00:00:27.869> much<00:00:27.960> every<00:00:28.349> finger<00:00:28.650> board<00:00:28.890> trick<00:00:29.099> I

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
pretty much every finger board trick I

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.160 
pretty much every finger board trick I
know<00:00:29.310> I<00:00:29.429> know<00:00:29.580> for<00:00:30.330> those<00:00:30.510> of<00:00:30.660> you<00:00:30.779> that<00:00:30.960> know<00:00:31.019> a

lot of tricks your finger positioning is

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.000 
lot of tricks your finger positioning is
very<00:00:33.630> close<00:00:33.960> to<00:00:33.989> being<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.469> same<00:00:34.710> every<00:00:34.980> time

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
very close to being the same every time

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.729 
very close to being the same every time
but<00:00:35.430> uh<00:00:36.170> what<00:00:37.170> I<00:00:37.700> would<00:00:38.700> recommend<00:00:39.440> for<00:00:40.440> help

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
but uh what I would recommend for help

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.430 
but uh what I would recommend for help
with<00:00:40.950> kickflips<00:00:41.460> is<00:00:42.079> your<00:00:43.079> finger

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
with kickflips is your finger

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:50.139 
with kickflips is your finger
positioning<00:00:44.780> be<00:00:45.780> like<00:00:45.989> this<00:00:48.440> so<00:00:49.440> basically

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:50.149 
positioning be like this so basically

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:55.340 
positioning be like this so basically
have<00:00:51.149> your<00:00:51.420> pinky<00:00:52.640> pinky<00:00:53.640> have<00:00:54.390> your<00:00:54.600> middle

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
finger right off the edge just a little

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.560 
finger right off the edge just a little
bit<00:00:59.820> I<00:01:00.620> don't<00:01:01.620> know<00:01:01.710> if<00:01:01.829> you<00:01:01.920> can<00:01:02.100> see<00:01:02.309> and<00:01:02.579> then

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
your um your index finger instead of

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.480 
your um your index finger instead of
being<00:01:06.450> like<00:01:06.510> right<00:01:06.960> here<00:01:07.320> like<00:01:07.799> as<00:01:07.979> if<00:01:08.159> it<00:01:08.310> was

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
being like right here like as if it was

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.210 
being like right here like as if it was
for<00:01:08.670> an<00:01:08.760> ollie<00:01:09.500> hang<00:01:10.500> it<00:01:10.650> off<00:01:10.770> just<00:01:11.040> a<00:01:11.189> little

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
for an ollie hang it off just a little

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.840 
for an ollie hang it off just a little
bit<00:01:11.520> so<00:01:11.970> that<00:01:12.000> that<00:01:12.270> a<00:01:12.330> crease<00:01:13.080> right<00:01:13.560> here<00:01:14.010> is

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
bit so that that a crease right here is

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.179 
bit so that that a crease right here is
hanging<00:01:15.240> off<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.600> board<00:01:16.020> few<00:01:16.650> millimeters

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
hanging off the board few millimeters

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.320 
hanging off the board few millimeters
and<00:01:18.110> then<00:01:19.110> on<00:01:19.549> that<00:01:20.549> way<00:01:20.790> when<00:01:21.000> you<00:01:21.090> try<00:01:21.299> to

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
and then on that way when you try to

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.580 
and then on that way when you try to
ollie<00:01:22.340> the<00:01:23.340> board<00:01:23.640> just<00:01:23.700> kind<00:01:24.119> of

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
ollie the board just kind of

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.039 
ollie the board just kind of
automatically<00:01:25.590> flips<00:01:26.100> I<00:01:26.460> mean<00:01:27.420> I<00:01:27.630> know<00:01:27.659> that's

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
automatically flips I mean I know that's

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:33.440 
automatically flips I mean I know that's
how<00:01:28.740> it<00:01:28.920> is<00:01:29.070> for<00:01:29.100> me<00:01:31.640> because<00:01:32.640> right<00:01:33.420> now

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
how it is for me because right now

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.510 
how it is for me because right now
having<00:01:34.020> my<00:01:34.140> fingers<00:01:34.530> like<00:01:34.770> that<00:01:34.799> I<00:01:35.220> try<00:01:35.490> to

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
having my fingers like that I try to

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.140 
having my fingers like that I try to
ollie<00:01:35.820> and<00:01:36.420> it<00:01:37.259> just<00:01:37.500> kind<00:01:37.710> of<00:01:38.150> naturally

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
ollie and it just kind of naturally

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.620 
ollie and it just kind of naturally
flipped<00:01:40.049> so<00:01:40.380> much<00:01:40.619> of<00:01:40.950> course<00:01:41.310> I<00:01:41.610> am<00:01:42.329> really

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
flipped so much of course I am really

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.440 
flipped so much of course I am really
used<00:01:42.960> to<00:01:43.110> kick<00:01:43.350> flips<00:01:43.649> I<00:01:43.890> mean<00:01:44.189> I've<00:01:44.670> known<00:01:45.240> how

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
used to kick flips I mean I've known how

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.980 
used to kick flips I mean I've known how
to<00:01:45.479> do<00:01:45.750> them<00:01:45.869> for<00:01:46.020> like<00:01:46.200> three<00:01:46.470> years<00:01:46.500> but<00:01:47.960> so<00:01:48.960> i

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
to do them for like three years but so i

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.389 
to do them for like three years but so i
guess<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.530> flick<00:01:49.799> kind<00:01:50.070> of<00:01:50.189> came<00:01:50.369> naturally

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
guess the flick kind of came naturally

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.020 
guess the flick kind of came naturally
but<00:01:51.270> um<00:01:51.710> you<00:01:52.710> don't<00:01:52.890> really<00:01:53.220> want<00:01:53.579> to<00:01:53.670> do<00:01:53.850> like

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
but um you don't really want to do like

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.660 
but um you don't really want to do like
I<00:01:54.210> know<00:01:54.299> I've<00:01:54.810> seen<00:01:55.200> some<00:01:55.530> tutorials<00:01:56.219> that<00:01:56.310> say

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
I know I've seen some tutorials that say

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.800 
I know I've seen some tutorials that say
just<00:01:57.479> uh<00:01:57.740> ollie<00:01:58.740> and<00:01:59.340> pull<00:01:59.969> your<00:02:00.090> hand<00:02:00.329> towards

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810

just uh ollie and pull your hand towards
you<00:02:00.990> and<00:02:01.110> it<00:02:01.200> should<00:02:01.439> come<00:02:02.210> because<00:02:03.210> I<00:02:03.420> know

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
you and it should come because I know

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.219 
you and it should come because I know
that's<00:02:03.899> not<00:02:04.110> how<00:02:04.320> I<00:02:04.350> learned<00:02:04.860> um<00:02:05.840> it's<00:02:06.840> kind<00:02:07.140> of

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
that's not how I learned um it's kind of

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:13.130 
that's not how I learned um it's kind of
more<00:02:07.439> of<00:02:07.500> a<00:02:07.680> forward<00:02:08.220> flick<00:02:10.099> like<00:02:11.780> I'll

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
more of a forward flick like I'll

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.010 
more of a forward flick like I'll
do<00:02:13.410> it<00:02:13.530> sitting<00:02:13.830> still<00:02:14.220> you<00:02:15.090> notice<00:02:15.450> I<00:02:15.600> kind<00:02:15.870> of

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
do it sitting still you notice I kind of

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.580 
do it sitting still you notice I kind of
pull<00:02:16.980> my<00:02:17.010> fingers<00:02:17.640> forward<00:02:18.230> for<00:02:19.230> the<00:02:19.319> flick

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
pull my fingers forward for the flick

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:20.960 
pull my fingers forward for the flick
but<00:02:19.860> you<00:02:19.950> don't<00:02:20.069> want<00:02:20.310> to<00:02:20.400> pull<00:02:20.550> it<00:02:20.760> straight

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
but you don't want to pull it straight

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.840 
but you don't want to pull it straight
forward<00:02:21.540> to<00:02:21.630> where<00:02:21.780> it<00:02:21.900> does<00:02:22.400> like<00:02:23.400> a<00:02:23.430> front

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
forward to where it does like a front

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.460 
forward to where it does like a front
impossible<00:02:24.569> or<00:02:24.630> something<00:02:25.110> I<00:02:25.170> don't<00:02:25.260> really

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
impossible or something I don't really

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.000 
impossible or something I don't really
know<00:02:25.709> but<00:02:25.740> um<00:02:27.020> it's<00:02:28.020> almost<00:02:28.410> just<00:02:28.740> like

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
know but um it's almost just like

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.240 
know but um it's almost just like
keeping<00:02:29.940> your<00:02:30.120> fingers<00:02:30.360> like<00:02:30.959> this<00:02:31.020> and<00:02:31.260> when

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
keeping your fingers like this and when
