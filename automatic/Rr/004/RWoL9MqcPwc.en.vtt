I<00:05:57.660> haven't<00:05:57.870> even<00:05:57.930> scratched<00:05:58.289> the<00:05:58.770> surface

00:05:58.879 --> 00:05:58.889 
I haven't even scratched the surface

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:02.540 
I haven't even scratched the surface
within<00:05:59.520> this<00:05:59.880> review<00:06:00.270> it<00:06:01.139> is<00:06:01.470> quite<00:06:01.860> pricey<00:06:02.250> at

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:02.550 
within this review it is quite pricey at

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:04.999 
within this review it is quite pricey at
$10<00:06:03.210> but<00:06:03.750> considering<00:06:04.199> that<00:06:04.320> the<00:06:04.470> same<00:06:04.740> game

00:06:04.999 --> 00:06:05.009 
$10 but considering that the same game

00:06:05.009 --> 00:06:08.659 
$10 but considering that the same game
would<00:06:05.340> probably<00:06:05.910> be<00:06:06.150> $30<00:06:06.900> or<00:06:07.050> more<00:06:07.470> on<00:06:07.800> another

00:06:08.659 --> 00:06:08.669 
would probably be $30 or more on another

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:12.260 
would probably be $30 or more on another
console<00:06:09.210> such<00:06:09.509> as<00:06:09.660> the<00:06:09.810> D<00:06:10.560> S<00:06:10.740> or<00:06:11.099> PSP<00:06:11.610> it<00:06:12.060> makes

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:12.270 
console such as the D S or PSP it makes

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:14.719 
console such as the D S or PSP it makes
it<00:06:12.419> feel<00:06:12.630> much<00:06:12.930> better<00:06:13.070> there<00:06:14.070> are<00:06:14.340> some

00:06:14.719 --> 00:06:14.729 
it feel much better there are some

00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:16.339 
it feel much better there are some
glitches<00:06:14.970> in<00:06:15.210> the<00:06:15.270> game<00:06:15.419> I<00:06:15.449> will<00:06:15.630> let<00:06:16.110> you<00:06:16.229> guys

00:06:16.339 --> 00:06:16.349 
glitches in the game I will let you guys

00:06:16.349 --> 00:06:18.409 
glitches in the game I will let you guys
know<00:06:16.409> there<00:06:16.949> are<00:06:17.070> some<00:06:17.280> glitches<00:06:17.460> and<00:06:17.940> you

00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:18.419 
know there are some glitches and you

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:20.870 
know there are some glitches and you
will<00:06:18.539> notice<00:06:18.720> the<00:06:19.020> very<00:06:19.050> occasional<00:06:19.919> lag<00:06:20.130> but

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:20.880 
will notice the very occasional lag but

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.689 
will notice the very occasional lag but
I<00:06:21.150> would<00:06:21.449> definitely<00:06:21.840> recommend<00:06:22.699> restarting

00:06:23.689 --> 00:06:23.699 
I would definitely recommend restarting

00:06:23.699 --> 00:06:26.719 
I would definitely recommend restarting
your<00:06:23.729> device<00:06:24.440> when<00:06:25.440> you<00:06:25.530> first<00:06:25.740> begin<00:06:26.159> I<00:06:26.460> mean

00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:26.729 
your device when you first begin I mean

00:06:26.729 --> 00:06:29.749 
your device when you first begin I mean
yeah<00:06:26.940> it'll<00:06:27.150> take<00:06:27.240> 30<00:06:27.690> seconds<00:06:28.199> but<00:06:28.830> it<00:06:29.430> really

00:06:29.749 --> 00:06:29.759 
yeah it'll take 30 seconds but it really

00:06:29.759 --> 00:06:31.219 
yeah it'll take 30 seconds but it really
does<00:06:29.940> make<00:06:30.090> a<00:06:30.150> difference<00:06:30.240> because<00:06:30.720> you<00:06:31.110> don't

00:06:31.219 --> 00:06:31.229 
does make a difference because you don't

00:06:31.229 --> 00:06:33.170 
does make a difference because you don't
want<00:06:31.440> your<00:06:31.650> you<00:06:32.280> don't<00:06:32.370> want<00:06:32.580> your<00:06:32.699> sim<00:06:32.970> you're

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:33.180 
want your you don't want your sim you're

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:35.149 
want your you don't want your sim you're
in<00:06:33.270> the<00:06:33.330> middle<00:06:33.570> of<00:06:33.659> it<00:06:33.810> you<00:06:34.560> don't<00:06:34.979> want<00:06:35.099> to

00:06:35.149 --> 00:06:35.159 
in the middle of it you don't want to

00:06:35.159 --> 00:06:37.610 
in the middle of it you don't want to
miss<00:06:35.310> it<00:06:35.520> and<00:06:35.550> it<00:06:36.180> does<00:06:36.389> it<00:06:36.630> does<00:06:36.810> you<00:06:37.080> do<00:06:37.259> it's

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:37.620 
miss it and it does it does you do it's

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:40.760 
miss it and it does it does you do it's
really<00:06:37.830> simple<00:06:37.979> to<00:06:38.130> save<00:06:39.169> so<00:06:40.169> I<00:06:40.409> mean<00:06:40.560> but<00:06:40.710> I

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:40.770 
really simple to save so I mean but I

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:42.230 
really simple to save so I mean but I
would<00:06:40.919> go<00:06:41.070> ahead<00:06:41.190> because<00:06:41.639> you<00:06:41.880> don't<00:06:42.060> want

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:42.240 
would go ahead because you don't want

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:43.760 
would go ahead because you don't want
lag<00:06:42.509> and<00:06:42.870> glitches<00:06:43.110> and<00:06:43.320> all<00:06:43.409> that<00:06:43.530> kind<00:06:43.710> of

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:43.770 
lag and glitches and all that kind of

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:47.089 
lag and glitches and all that kind of
stuff<00:06:44.659> now<00:06:45.659> while<00:06:46.110> I<00:06:46.139> really<00:06:46.620> enjoyed<00:06:46.949> this
