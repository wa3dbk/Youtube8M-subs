00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
that is it this is probably the most

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.600

simple<00:01:12.630> hair<00:01:12.960> tutorial<00:01:13.710> whatever<00:01:14.040> but<00:01:14.580> it's

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
simple hair tutorial whatever but it's

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.760 
simple hair tutorial whatever but it's
really<00:01:15.150> handy<00:01:15.479> and<00:01:15.990> it's<00:01:16.140> something<00:01:16.409> that<00:01:16.619> I

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
really handy and it's something that I

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.280 
really handy and it's something that I
use<00:01:17.159> a<00:01:17.369> lot<00:01:17.400> all<00:01:18.030> you're<00:01:18.270> going<00:01:18.540> to<00:01:18.689> do<00:01:18.960> is

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
use a lot all you're going to do is

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.090 
use a lot all you're going to do is
split<00:01:20.009> your<00:01:20.280> hair<00:01:20.640> halfway<00:01:21.150> down<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:22.049> back<00:01:22.590> so

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
split your hair halfway down the back so

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.950 
split your hair halfway down the back so
it<00:01:23.250> doesn't<00:01:23.670> have<00:01:23.939> to<00:01:24.180> be<00:01:24.210> straight<00:01:24.720> or

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
it doesn't have to be straight or

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.990 
it doesn't have to be straight or
anything<00:01:25.500> it<00:01:25.680> doesn't<00:01:25.920> really<00:01:26.220> matter<00:01:26.490> in

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
anything it doesn't really matter in

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.569 
anything it doesn't really matter in
fats<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.659> Messier<00:01:28.140> at<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.650> but<00:01:28.829> probably<00:01:29.369> the

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
fats the Messier at the but probably the

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.030 
fats the Messier at the but probably the
better<00:01:29.759> so<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.390> sections<00:01:30.930> aren't<00:01:31.320> so<00:01:31.500> even

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
better so the sections aren't so even

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.219 
better so the sections aren't so even
and<00:01:32.340> then<00:01:32.790> you<00:01:32.939> are<00:01:33.030> literally<00:01:33.270> going<00:01:33.540> to<00:01:33.810> take

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
and then you are literally going to take

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.230 
and then you are literally going to take
the<00:01:34.470> hair<00:01:34.740> off<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:35.220> you're<00:01:35.340> going<00:01:35.579> to<00:01:35.820> create

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
the hair off and you're going to create

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.800 
the hair off and you're going to create
two<00:01:36.689> little<00:01:37.500> buns<00:01:38.040> on<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:39.060> top<00:01:39.329> of<00:01:39.570> your<00:01:39.750> head

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
two little buns on the top of your head

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.200 
two little buns on the top of your head

them<00:03:27.790> in<00:03:27.970> for<00:03:28.180> like<00:03:28.300> half<00:03:28.540> an<00:03:28.810> hour<00:03:28.990> it<00:03:29.470> will

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830 
them in for like half an hour it will

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:31.890 
them in for like half an hour it will
still<00:03:30.220> have<00:03:30.670> the<00:03:30.850> same<00:03:31.030> effect<00:03:31.180> they<00:03:31.720> might

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
still have the same effect they might

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.870 
still have the same effect they might
just<00:03:32.050> drop<00:03:32.350> quicker<00:03:32.890> or<00:03:33.190> they<00:03:33.430> might<00:03:33.640> not<00:03:33.820> be

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
just drop quicker or they might not be

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.720 
just drop quicker or they might not be
as<00:03:34.210> big<00:03:34.840> so<00:03:35.410> it's<00:03:35.560> been<00:03:35.770> about<00:03:35.980> an<00:03:36.250> hour<00:03:36.340> and<00:03:36.700> a
