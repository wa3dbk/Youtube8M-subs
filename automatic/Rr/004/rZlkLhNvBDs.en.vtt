short<00:02:41.459> to<00:02:41.700> jump<00:02:41.970> up<00:02:42.120> the<00:02:42.270> wall<00:02:42.590> so<00:02:43.590> if<00:02:44.010> you<00:02:44.190> pull

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
short to jump up the wall so if you pull

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.180 
short to jump up the wall so if you pull
on<00:02:44.430> it<00:02:44.550> it's<00:02:45.360> going<00:02:45.480> to<00:02:45.570> pull<00:02:46.020> him<00:02:46.140> up<00:02:46.320> so<00:02:46.770> I

suppose<00:02:47.520> there's<00:02:47.730> a<00:02:47.820> pulley<00:02:48.030> inside<00:02:48.420> and<00:02:48.750> then

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
suppose there's a pulley inside and then

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.920 
suppose there's a pulley inside and then
that<00:02:49.470> that's<00:02:49.709> how<00:02:49.920> this<00:02:50.100> thing<00:02:50.310> works<00:02:50.930> but

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
that that's how this thing works but

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.759 
that that's how this thing works but
anyway<00:02:53.180> neat<00:02:54.180> little<00:02:54.360> gimmicky<00:02:54.959> especially

the<00:04:12.680> figure<00:04:12.950> is<00:04:12.980> really<00:04:13.520> small<00:04:13.790> and<00:04:14.440> even<00:04:15.440> if

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
the figure is really small and even if

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.460 
the figure is really small and even if
you<00:04:15.710> add<00:04:15.920> this<00:04:16.400> much<00:04:17.390> plastic<00:04:17.690> I<00:04:18.110> don't<00:04:18.380> think

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470 
you add this much plastic I don't think

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.790 
you add this much plastic I don't think
you<00:04:18.830> can<00:04:19.180> the<00:04:20.180> equal<00:04:20.959> the<00:04:21.260> amount<00:04:21.350> of<00:04:21.620> plastic

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:21.800 
you can the equal the amount of plastic

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:25.290 
you can the equal the amount of plastic
you<00:04:22.100> get<00:04:22.250> for<00:04:22.430> a<00:04:22.460> regular-sized<00:04:23.150> figure<00:04:23.570> so

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
you get for a regular-sized figure so

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.600 
you get for a regular-sized figure so
that<00:04:26.300> what<00:04:26.960> does<00:04:27.080> that<00:04:27.230> mean<00:04:27.470> it<00:04:27.830> means<00:04:27.980> that

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:28.610 
that what does that mean it means that

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:30.730

think<00:05:09.680> the<00:05:09.800> cost<00:05:10.070> implications<00:05:10.280> would<00:05:10.910> be<00:05:10.970> too

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:11.270 
think the cost implications would be too

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:14.380 
think the cost implications would be too
much<00:05:11.300> to<00:05:11.750> really<00:05:12.730> skyrocket<00:05:13.730> the<00:05:13.850> price<00:05:14.060> like

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:14.390 
much to really skyrocket the price like

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:17.610 
much to really skyrocket the price like
the<00:05:14.570> cost<00:05:14.780> on<00:05:14.960> this<00:05:15.140> guy<00:05:15.380> he's<00:05:15.770> so<00:05:15.920> small<00:05:16.250> so

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:17.620 
the cost on this guy he's so small so

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:21.010 
the cost on this guy he's so small so

articulation for this figure being small

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:29.860 
articulation for this figure being small
that<00:05:25.400> years<00:05:26.470> but<00:05:27.760> that's<00:05:28.760> just<00:05:29.270> the<00:05:29.510> way<00:05:29.630> has

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:29.870

row is they really like to scrimp on

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:37.810 
row is they really like to scrimp on
their<00:05:34.370> figures<00:05:34.730> is<00:05:34.910> but<00:05:35.060> you<00:05:35.600> know<00:05:35.630> but<00:05:36.820> i'm

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:37.820 
their figures is but you know but i'm

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:39.340 
their figures is but you know but i'm
not<00:05:38.150> complaining<00:05:38.210> too<00:05:38.720> much<00:05:38.780> because<00:05:39.080> again

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:39.350 
not complaining too much because again

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:42.070 
not complaining too much because again
as<00:05:39.440> I<00:05:39.560> said<00:05:39.590> the<00:05:39.920> sculpt<00:05:40.490> was<00:05:40.730> well<00:05:40.970> made<00:05:41.270> it's

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:42.080 
as I said the sculpt was well made it's

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.590 
as I said the sculpt was well made it's
a<00:05:42.170> wonderful<00:05:42.650> sculpt<00:05:43.070> the<00:05:43.940> figure<00:05:44.210> was<00:05:44.390> well

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:44.600 
a wonderful sculpt the figure was well

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:46.510 
a wonderful sculpt the figure was well
designed<00:05:45.020> I<00:05:45.500> think<00:05:45.740> in<00:05:45.830> terms<00:05:45.980> of<00:05:46.190> aesthetics

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:46.520 
designed I think in terms of aesthetics

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.450 
designed I think in terms of aesthetics
it's<00:05:47.240> just<00:05:47.510> that<00:05:47.630> the<00:05:47.810> joints<00:05:48.290> were<00:05:49.160> a<00:05:49.220> little

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:49.460 
it's just that the joints were a little

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:52.000 
it's just that the joints were a little
bit<00:05:49.670> lacking<00:05:50.150> in<00:05:50.420> my<00:05:50.570> opinion<00:05:51.010> considering

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:52.010 
bit lacking in my opinion considering

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:54.040 
bit lacking in my opinion considering
the<00:05:52.160> fact<00:05:52.400> that<00:05:52.520> they<00:05:53.150> could<00:05:53.270> have<00:05:53.360> added<00:05:53.510> of<00:05:53.900> a

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:54.050 
the fact that they could have added of a

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:56.740 
the fact that they could have added of a
few<00:05:54.260> more<00:05:54.500> considering<00:05:55.430> his<00:05:55.550> size<00:05:55.820> and<00:05:56.210> the

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:56.750 
few more considering his size and the

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:58.780 
few more considering his size and the
amount<00:05:56.780> of<00:05:57.050> plastic<00:05:57.200> that<00:05:57.440> amount<00:05:58.340> of<00:05:58.490> plastic

00:05:58.780 --> 00:05:58.790 
amount of plastic that amount of plastic

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:00.400 
amount of plastic that amount of plastic
that's<00:05:59.270> actually<00:05:59.570> been<00:05:59.720> used<00:05:59.930> on<00:06:00.080> the<00:06:00.260> figure

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:00.410 
that's actually been used on the figure

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:02.830 
that's actually been used on the figure
but<00:06:00.770> other<00:06:01.130> than<00:06:01.310> that<00:06:01.370> it's<00:06:02.030> a<00:06:02.180> neat<00:06:02.420> figure

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:02.840 
but other than that it's a neat figure

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.620 
but other than that it's a neat figure
if<00:06:03.230> you're<00:06:03.380> big<00:06:03.590> Clone<00:06:03.800> Wars<00:06:04.010> fan<00:06:04.630> definitely

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:05.630 
if you're big Clone Wars fan definitely

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:10.630 
if you're big Clone Wars fan definitely
a<00:06:05.660> must-have<00:06:08.410> figure<00:06:09.410> to<00:06:10.250> add<00:06:10.370> to<00:06:10.550> your

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:10.640 
a must-have figure to add to your

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:13.120 
a must-have figure to add to your
collection<00:06:10.790> especially<00:06:11.210> I<00:06:11.570> think<00:06:11.920> this<00:06:12.920> is

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:13.130 
collection especially I think this is

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:15.970 
collection especially I think this is
probably<00:06:13.490> the<00:06:13.820> last<00:06:14.120> Evan<00:06:14.600> peel<00:06:14.870> that<00:06:15.500> has<00:06:15.740> row

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:15.980 
probably the last Evan peel that has row

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:18.280 
probably the last Evan peel that has row
is<00:06:16.220> manufacturing<00:06:17.030> I<00:06:17.300> mean<00:06:17.960> can<00:06:18.050> you<00:06:18.110> believe

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:18.290 
is manufacturing I mean can you believe

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:21.330 
is manufacturing I mean can you believe
that<00:06:18.770> is<00:06:19.340> the<00:06:19.400> last<00:06:19.790> I<00:06:20.120> don't<00:06:20.270> think<00:06:20.419> the<00:06:20.479> leave

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:21.340 
that is the last I don't think the leave

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:23.890 
that is the last I don't think the leave
that's<00:06:22.340> what<00:06:22.550> they<00:06:22.640> say<00:06:22.880> you<00:06:23.180> know<00:06:23.300> so<00:06:23.630> we

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:23.900 
that's what they say you know so we

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:24.350 
that's what they say you know so we
might

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:24.360 
might

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:28.129 
might
not<00:06:24.449> get<00:06:24.659> one<00:06:24.900> for<00:06:25.289> the<00:06:26.180> vintage<00:06:27.180> line<00:06:27.569> by<00:06:27.719> I'm

00:06:28.129 --> 00:06:28.139 
not get one for the vintage line by I'm

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:30.499 
not get one for the vintage line by I'm
hoping<00:06:28.650> they<00:06:29.069> do<00:06:29.129> they<00:06:29.699> do<00:06:29.759> come<00:06:30.090> up<00:06:30.120> with<00:06:30.240> one

00:06:30.499 --> 00:06:30.509 
hoping they do they do come up with one

00:06:30.509 --> 00:06:32.149 
hoping they do they do come up with one
for<00:06:30.539> the<00:06:30.780> vintage<00:06:30.960> line<00:06:31.319> and<00:06:31.530> just<00:06:31.650> add<00:06:31.919> more
