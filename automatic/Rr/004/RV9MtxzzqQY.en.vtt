00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:51.469

 I am not from the barrillas I am a missionary 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:06.229
 married to a porteÃ±o and 13 years ago we 

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:08.539
 we live in OlavarrÃ­a and well and then 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:10.909
 of a lot of walking we decided to do this 

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:14.330
 because we used to make liqueurs 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:16.549
 we made regional sweets but there was 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:19.130
 a lot in the market then they said 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:21.259
 well there we went back to our origins 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.659
 that mine are like I'm a missionary 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:25.850
 Carve the wood 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:28.490
 we continue good now that we are more 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.920
 we already have the part that nothing that 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.289
 we are going to dedicate when we retire 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:35.750
 by face carving the carving and making 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:40.340
 for chopped we make for chopping to have 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:42.979
 pork guitarist models a 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:48.009
 it prints a lot of things and the 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:51.020
 butterflies you have empanadas you have 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:55.640
 birds of doughy mass and television 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:57.860
 shoes and good and those of the republic 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.579
 Argentina map of the province good 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.599
 airs 

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:01.599
 here you have some emissions 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.170
 that they always have if we have a 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.509
 variety not very big because neither what 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.910
 they are usually where he presents you 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.650
 It's not very big but they adapt to 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.349
 any province after then 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:19.050
 you have for example dishes like this 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:21.260
 style that I show you more 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:24.230
 without more 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.269
 the idea was that the room is here and here 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.370
 the salad so we do not fear the 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:30.950
 Asadito is also we have in 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:34.519
 different tones you have in guayubira in 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:37.860
 mar melero and you have these carvings of 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:42.700
 another craftsman asked for me 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:45.580
 Oh, what beauty and we append 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.470
 so everything is handcrafted all right 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:51.550
 artisan here you have for example a 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:55.959
 compartment for sauces also in a 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:57.700
 cypress and in the handcrafted part of 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:00.550
 ceramic makes me an artisan of 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:03.130
 the car that is everything is good and I see 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.080
 that also the pizzas to be able to cut 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:07.800
 by portions and fed up to be able to cut 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.800
 per serving 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:17.030
 well well marked so that the pizza 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:20.370
 leave immediately after you have a tartera 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:24.390
 well with the repuve that killed me the 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:26.849
 repulse that you have after you have 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.379

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.540
