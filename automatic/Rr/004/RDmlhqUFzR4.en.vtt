much<00:01:00.270> exactly<00:01:00.570> like<00:01:00.960> it<00:01:03.589> which<00:01:04.589> is<00:01:04.710> what<00:01:04.860> I<00:01:04.920> was

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
much exactly like it which is what I was

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.250 
much exactly like it which is what I was
going<00:01:05.220> for

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
going for

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.730 
going for
I<00:01:07.290> mainly<00:01:08.070> started<00:01:08.670> this<00:01:08.850> just<00:01:09.619> because<00:01:10.619> I

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
I mainly started this just because I

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.190 
I mainly started this just because I
need<00:01:11.010> another<00:01:11.340> project<00:01:11.689> to<00:01:12.689> build<00:01:12.900> something

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
need another project to build something

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.670 
need another project to build something
and<00:01:14.180> my<00:01:15.180> wife<00:01:15.360> was<00:01:15.570> getting<00:01:15.960> tired<00:01:16.259> of<00:01:16.530> me

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
and my wife was getting tired of me

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.850 
and my wife was getting tired of me
building<00:01:17.689> ar-15s<00:01:18.689> and<00:01:19.110> that<00:01:19.320> type<00:01:19.500> of<00:01:19.530> stuff

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
building ar-15s and that type of stuff

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.380 
building ar-15s and that type of stuff
so<00:01:20.130> I<00:01:21.320> figured<00:01:22.320> hey<00:01:22.740> I<00:01:23.040> make<00:01:23.790> a<00:01:23.880> base<00:01:24.030> how<00:01:24.240> can

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
so I figured hey I make a base how can

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.289 
so I figured hey I make a base how can
she<00:01:24.420> get<00:01:24.630> mad

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.179 

well<00:01:27.869> I<00:01:29.060> think<00:01:30.060> last<00:01:30.359> video<00:01:30.840> I<00:01:30.899> should<00:01:31.259> I<00:01:31.590> had

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
well I think last video I should I had

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:37.069 
well I think last video I should I had
the<00:01:32.369> body<00:01:32.869> maybe<00:01:35.119> so<00:01:36.119> I<00:01:36.479> guess<00:01:36.750> we'll<00:01:36.899> start

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
the body maybe so I guess we'll start

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:42.709 
the body maybe so I guess we'll start

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:01.490 
up right on it I had to keep tweaking
the<00:03:59.669> neck<00:03:59.909> a<00:03:59.939> little<00:04:00.329> bit<00:04:00.479> just<00:04:01.199> to<00:04:01.290> get
