00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:00.220 
and so much smaller it's just because it

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:02.010 
and so much smaller it's just because it
pulls<00:01:00.400> it<00:01:00.520> in<00:01:00.640> the<00:01:00.760> attention<00:01:01.270> goes<00:01:01.660> down<00:01:01.900> a

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:02.020

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:03.940 
little bit more and innovate so what you

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.000 
little bit more and innovate so what you
can't<00:01:04.270> tell<00:01:04.510> how<00:01:04.839> big<00:01:05.050> your<00:01:05.199> hips<00:01:05.410> are<00:01:05.590> so<00:01:05.950> I

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.010

can't tell how big your hips are so I
love<00:01:06.040> that<00:01:06.490> and<00:01:06.700> then<00:01:06.940> it<00:01:07.060> cinched<00:01:07.360> a<00:01:07.450> little

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:07.660 
love that and then it cinched a little

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:09.570 
love that and then it cinched a little
bit<00:01:07.810> and<00:01:08.050> pleated<00:01:08.350> so<00:01:08.950> it<00:01:09.130> does<00:01:09.280> make<00:01:09.460> the

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:09.580 
bit and pleated so it does make the

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.040 
bit and pleated so it does make the
skirt<00:01:09.759> go<00:01:09.940> out<00:01:10.119> of<00:01:10.240> it<00:01:10.390> there's<00:01:10.570> a<00:01:10.630> black<00:01:10.840> layer

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.070 
skirt go out of it there's a black layer
underneath<00:01:11.470> and<00:01:11.910> that<00:01:12.910> allows<00:01:13.270> the<00:01:13.630> lace<00:01:13.810> to

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.080 
underneath and that allows the lace to

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.469 
underneath and that allows the lace to
really<00:01:14.380> show<00:01:14.590> up<00:01:14.770> and<00:01:15.009> pop<00:01:15.190> and<00:01:15.430> I<00:01:15.910> did<00:01:16.300> this

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
it's a big enough pattern where you

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.279 
it's a big enough pattern where you
could<00:01:42.819> really<00:01:43.000> see<00:01:43.300> the<00:01:43.420> lace<00:01:43.600> detail<00:01:43.869> I

00:01:44.279 --> 00:01:44.289

paired<00:01:44.920> it<00:01:45.069> with<00:01:45.100> a<00:01:45.190> black<00:01:45.520> little<00:01:46.270> top<00:01:46.539> but<00:01:46.990> I

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
paired it with a black little top but I

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.600

was<00:01:47.229> gonna<00:01:47.350> do<00:01:47.560> purple<00:01:48.039> I<00:01:48.130> think<00:01:48.160> you<00:01:48.429> could

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
was gonna do purple I think you could

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.249 
was gonna do purple I think you could
really<00:01:48.640> tie<00:01:49.090> in<00:01:49.240> a<00:01:49.330> lot<00:01:49.539> of<00:01:49.569> different<00:01:49.810> colors

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:50.259 
really tie in a lot of different colors

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:51.930 
really tie in a lot of different colors
when<00:01:50.709> you're<00:01:50.890> doing<00:01:51.160> lace<00:01:51.369> especially<00:01:51.550> if

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:51.940 
when you're doing lace especially if

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.210 
when you're doing lace especially if
it's<00:01:52.060> one<00:01:52.270> solid<00:01:52.780> tone<00:01:52.929> lace<00:01:53.289> like<00:01:53.560> this<00:01:53.800> you

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220 
it's one solid tone lace like this you

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:55.620 
it's one solid tone lace like this you
could<00:01:54.340> wear<00:01:54.520> a<00:01:54.550> different<00:01:54.670> color<00:01:54.849> tops<00:01:55.240> I<00:01:55.390> just

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
could wear a different color tops I just

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:56.910 
could wear a different color tops I just
did<00:01:55.750> the<00:01:55.840> black<00:01:56.050> because<00:01:56.229> I<00:01:56.319> think<00:01:56.380> it<00:01:56.619> tied<00:01:56.800> it

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
did the black because I think it tied it

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.290 
did the black because I think it tied it
nice<00:01:57.069> with<00:01:57.220> since<00:01:57.399> up<00:01:57.520> then<00:01:57.670> of<00:01:57.789> course<00:01:57.970> I<00:01:58.119> have

nice with since up then of course I have
black<00:01:58.569> tights<00:01:58.899> on<00:01:59.080> so<00:01:59.259> I<00:01:59.289> thought<00:01:59.470> the<00:01:59.619> flacks

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 
black tights on so I thought the flacks

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:01.260 
black tights on so I thought the flacks
all<00:02:00.130> tied<00:02:00.399> in<00:02:00.550> really<00:02:00.729> well<00:02:00.880> and<00:02:00.910> if<00:02:01.090> you<00:02:01.179> guys
