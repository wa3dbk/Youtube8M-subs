00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
the top still have this opening here and

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.850 
the top still have this opening here and
there's<00:01:56.060> also<00:01:56.210> a<00:01:56.420> vent<00:01:57.200> hole<00:01:57.440> here<00:01:57.710> in<00:01:57.800> the

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
there's also a vent hole here in the

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.249 
there's also a vent hole here in the

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:00.259 
back but other than that it's it's

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:05.109 
back but other than that it's it's
pretty<00:02:00.560> well<00:02:01.869> water-resistant<00:02:02.869> and<00:02:04.119> my

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
pretty well water-resistant and my

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:06.880 
pretty well water-resistant and my
recommendation<00:02:05.930> when<00:02:06.050> using<00:02:06.259> this<00:02:06.470> is<00:02:06.619> try<00:02:06.860> to

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
recommendation when using this is try to

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.219 
recommendation when using this is try to
place<00:02:07.340> it<00:02:07.640> in<00:02:07.850> a<00:02:08.300> place<00:02:08.569> that's<00:02:08.810> not<00:02:08.989> going<00:02:09.170> to

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
place it in a place that's not going to

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.710 
place it in a place that's not going to
get<00:02:09.440> direct<00:02:09.800> rain<00:02:10.100> or<00:02:10.399> hit<00:02:10.910> by<00:02:11.120> a<00:02:11.150> sprinkler

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
get direct rain or hit by a sprinkler

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.470 
get direct rain or hit by a sprinkler
system<00:02:11.750> or<00:02:12.230> anything<00:02:12.380> like<00:02:12.620> that<00:02:12.680> so<00:02:13.390> you<00:02:14.390> know

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
system or anything like that so you know

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.930 
system or anything like that so you know
maybe<00:02:14.690> up<00:02:14.900> underneath<00:02:15.140> your<00:02:15.440> shed<00:02:15.940> something

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
maybe up underneath your shed something

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:22.240 
maybe up underneath your shed something
like<00:02:17.090> this<00:02:17.440> or<00:02:18.440> even<00:02:18.880> facing<00:02:19.880> inward<00:02:21.250> those

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
like this or even facing inward those

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.610 
like this or even facing inward those
would<00:02:22.430> all<00:02:22.519> be<00:02:22.670> good<00:02:22.850> choices<00:02:23.350> maybe<00:02:24.350> at<00:02:24.500> the

up under and Eve any of those places
where<00:02:33.530> you'll<00:02:34.370> see<00:02:34.640> a<00:02:34.670> lot<00:02:34.910> of<00:02:34.940> the<00:02:35.120> activity

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
where you'll see a lot of the activity

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.780 
where you'll see a lot of the activity
but<00:02:36.470> isn't<00:02:36.980> it<00:02:37.040> going<00:02:37.130> to<00:02:37.190> be<00:02:37.310> out<00:02:37.400> in<00:02:37.430> the<00:02:37.580> wide

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.490 
but isn't it going to be out in the wide
open<00:02:37.820> where<00:02:38.450> it's<00:02:38.630> going<00:02:38.780> to<00:02:38.840> get<00:02:39.019> completely

though this does protect it to some
degree<00:02:44.540> it's<00:02:45.140> not<00:02:45.290> going<00:02:45.440> to<00:02:45.500> be<00:02:45.560> a<00:02:45.620> hundred

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.500

percent protection from a direct heavy

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.229 
percent protection from a direct heavy
rain<00:02:47.810> so<00:02:48.739> the<00:02:48.769> better<00:02:49.160> you<00:02:49.340> protect<00:02:49.730> it<00:02:49.940> the

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
rain so the better you protect it the

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:52.000 
rain so the better you protect it the
longer<00:02:50.780> your<00:02:50.930> rat<00:02:51.080> zapper<00:02:51.110> is<00:02:51.560> going<00:02:51.709> to<00:02:51.799> last

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
longer your rat zapper is going to last

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.910 
longer your rat zapper is going to last
and<00:02:52.310> be<00:02:52.459> serviceable<00:02:53.650> next<00:02:54.650> I'm<00:02:54.739> going<00:02:54.860> to

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
and be serviceable next I'm going to

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.350 
and be serviceable next I'm going to
show<00:02:55.010> you<00:02:55.070> one<00:02:55.340> other<00:02:55.370> little<00:02:55.790> tip<00:02:56.030> that<00:02:56.060> I

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489 
like and I think would make this work

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:02.080 
like and I think would make this work
even<00:02:58.940> better<00:03:00.010> okay<00:03:01.010> the<00:03:01.160> one<00:03:01.310> last<00:03:01.489> tip<00:03:01.760> I<00:03:01.910> have

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
even better okay the one last tip I have

for you when using the rat zapper it

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.130 
for you when using the rat zapper it

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
doesn't hurt to give it a little bit of

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.009 
doesn't hurt to give it a little bit of
cover<00:03:06.400> and<00:03:07.400> I'm<00:03:07.790> folding<00:03:08.269> this<00:03:08.360> in<00:03:08.420> half<00:03:08.720> I

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
cover and I'm folding this in half I
