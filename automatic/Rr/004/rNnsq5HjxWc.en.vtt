00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
fit and I'm just going to literally drop

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
fit and I'm just going to literally drop
us<00:01:07.680> in<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.340> water<00:01:08.549> and<00:01:09.380> it<00:01:10.380> will<00:01:10.530> curl<00:01:10.860> that's

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
us in the water and it will curl that's

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.460 
us in the water and it will curl that's
what<00:01:11.549> it's<00:01:11.700> supposed<00:01:11.760> to<00:01:12.030> do<00:01:12.210> so<00:01:13.049> just<00:01:13.200> give<00:01:13.439> it

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
what it's supposed to do so just give it

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.609 
what it's supposed to do so just give it
to<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.830> 30<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.729> 60<00:01:15.090> seconds<00:01:15.479> something<00:01:16.439> like

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
to the 30 to 60 seconds something like

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:23.120 
to the 30 to 60 seconds something like
that<00:01:18.200> and<00:01:20.810> kind<00:01:21.810> of<00:01:21.990> no<00:01:22.110> one<00:01:22.290> is<00:01:22.409> ready<00:01:22.650> because

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
that and kind of no one is ready because

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.219 
that and kind of no one is ready because
you<00:01:23.310> if<00:01:23.640> you<00:01:23.820> feel<00:01:24.060> it<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.390> back<00:01:24.630> will

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
off it's easier than now trying to get

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.270 
off it's easier than now trying to get
some<00:02:13.500> scissors<00:02:13.709> and<00:02:14.340> trim<00:02:14.550> in<00:02:14.730> it<00:02:14.880> I<00:02:16.130> like<00:02:17.130> to

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
some scissors and trim in it I like to

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:23.600 
some scissors and trim in it I like to
use<00:02:17.580> a<00:02:18.620> cotton<00:02:19.620> bud<00:02:20.270> just<00:02:21.270> to<00:02:21.420> roll<00:02:21.630> over<00:02:22.610> and

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
use a cotton bud just to roll over and

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:30.170 
use a cotton bud just to roll over and
remove<00:02:23.940> any<00:02:24.540> excess<00:02:24.750> water<00:02:28.489> but<00:02:29.489> so<00:02:29.790> you<00:02:29.850> can

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
remove any excess water but so you can

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.600 
remove any excess water but so you can
use<00:02:30.390> cotton<00:02:30.810> pads<00:02:31.080> kombu<00:02:32.070> and<00:02:33.410> swabs<00:02:34.610> whatever

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
use cotton pads kombu and swabs whatever

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.540 
use cotton pads kombu and swabs whatever
you<00:02:35.760> find<00:02:35.970> easier<00:02:36.769> unless<00:02:37.769> you<00:02:37.980> can<00:02:38.190> sort<00:02:38.519> of

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
you find easier unless you can sort of

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:39.830 
you find easier unless you can sort of
play<00:02:38.700> around<00:02:38.970> with<00:02:39.150> it<00:02:39.269> the<00:02:39.390> better<00:02:39.570> because

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
play around with it the better because

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.150 
play around with it the better because
they<00:02:40.110> are<00:02:40.200> quite<00:02:40.440> fragile<00:02:40.920> and<00:02:41.400> delicate<00:02:41.459> but

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
they are quite fragile and delicate but

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.630 
they are quite fragile and delicate but
you've<00:02:44.160> got<00:02:44.280> a<00:02:44.310> bit<00:02:44.459> of<00:02:44.580> maneuver<00:02:45.480> there<00:02:45.660> so<00:02:46.640> it

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
you've got a bit of maneuver there so it

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.100 
you've got a bit of maneuver there so it
looks<00:02:47.790> quite<00:02:48.030> dull<00:02:48.239> at<00:02:48.390> the<00:02:48.450> moment<00:02:48.870> but<00:02:48.959> as

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
looks quite dull at the moment but as

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.009 
looks quite dull at the moment but as
soon<00:02:49.290> as<00:02:49.410> you<00:02:49.470> put<00:02:49.680> the<00:02:49.769> clear<00:02:50.510> varnish<00:02:51.510> over

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
soon as you put the clear varnish over

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:54.979 
soon as you put the clear varnish over
the<00:02:52.110> top<00:02:52.320> it<00:02:52.590> comes<00:02:52.800> alive<00:02:53.420> and<00:02:54.420> that's<00:02:54.600> pretty

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
the top it comes alive and that's pretty

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:56.840 
the top it comes alive and that's pretty
much<00:02:55.140> what<00:02:55.380> we<00:02:55.500> want<00:02:55.680> to<00:02:55.769> see<00:02:55.920> now<00:02:56.220> we've<00:02:56.580> taken

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
much what we want to see now we've taken

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.809 
much what we want to see now we've taken
away<00:02:57.090> I<00:02:57.420> think<00:02:57.720> most<00:02:57.930> of<00:02:58.050> the<00:02:58.170> moisture<00:02:58.819> which

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
away I think most of the moisture which

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:01.490 
away I think most of the moisture which
you<00:02:59.940> need<00:03:00.090> to<00:03:00.239> do<00:03:00.360> otherwise<00:03:00.600> it<00:03:00.900> will<00:03:00.959> crack

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
you need to do otherwise it will crack

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.830 
you need to do otherwise it will crack
up<00:03:01.709> a<00:03:01.830> little<00:03:02.040> bit<00:03:02.600> but<00:03:05.150> it's<00:03:06.150> quite<00:03:06.390> forgiving

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
up a little bit but it's quite forgiving

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:16.180 
up a little bit but it's quite forgiving
as<00:03:06.989> well<00:03:08.420> so<00:03:12.560> there's<00:03:13.560> some<00:03:13.739> clear<00:03:13.980> varnish

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
as well so there's some clear varnish

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:22.970 
as well so there's some clear varnish
and<00:03:17.190> just<00:03:17.370> put<00:03:17.549> one<00:03:17.579> coat<00:03:18.769> over<00:03:19.769> the<00:03:19.799> top<00:03:21.980> and

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
and just put one coat over the top and

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.970 
and just put one coat over the top and
that<00:03:23.220> is<00:03:23.459> going<00:03:23.700> to<00:03:23.970> fix<00:03:24.239> and<00:03:24.600> set<00:03:25.340> the<00:03:26.340> decal

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
that is going to fix and set the decal

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.420 
that is going to fix and set the decal
once<00:03:28.980> that's<00:03:29.190> dried<00:03:29.549> completely<00:03:31.040> you<00:03:32.040> can<00:03:32.220> put

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
once that's dried completely you can put

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.410 
once that's dried completely you can put
two<00:03:32.670> or<00:03:32.700> three<00:03:32.820> coats<00:03:33.060> on<00:03:33.570> and<00:03:35.060> and<00:03:36.060> it'll<00:03:36.299> last

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
two or three coats on and and it'll last

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:42.380 
two or three coats on and and it'll last
for<00:03:36.780> ages<00:03:37.519> it's<00:03:38.519> a<00:03:38.700> fantastic<00:03:39.269> effect<00:03:41.390> simple

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
for ages it's a fantastic effect simple

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.630 
for ages it's a fantastic effect simple
as<00:03:42.480> that
