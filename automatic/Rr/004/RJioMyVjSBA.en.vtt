00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.189
 then eric lombardi I told you 21 years 

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:09.840
 from the angelic rod already to see it yes 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.170
 sees that a guy with great means 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.990
 physical and athletic physical ricardo 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.630
 perfect jumper right now the 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:22.080
 difference in this in this final la 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:26.250
 will surely do the fantasy we see that 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:28.980
 is however involving one of the 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.679
 mascot of the game let's see what thing 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.820
 he invented eric let 's see what in his twenties 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:39.050
 that lombard us first crushed tries 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:41.500
 he already believes show for eric lombardi 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:44.700
 milla untapped vallone 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:48.310
 the crushed mascot to vote basket 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:50.730
 but I give him a half past nine where 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:50.730
 half 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:57.760
 amazing crushed 49 points for the 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:00.609
 first crushed and now second 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:03.180
 crushed for Europeans to be sick of gold 

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:05.710
 under 20 with the sacripanti blues 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:09.360
 started from afar he threw the ball 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:11.920
 probably if he takes it with him, it comes off 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.979
 from the free throw line 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:17.500
 this is one that flies this is one that 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:20.920
 my mom's photo flies 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:25.360
 ten of them to everything 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:31.060
 mommy mom left from afar and left 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:33.549
 really from a distance 98 points 98 points 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.479
 and here he will have to invent jake locker that 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:36.479
 one of a joke 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:38.799
 then this is the first dunk 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.100
 takes the ball from the mascot goes to 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:41.100
 crush 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.170
 this is the second time this is 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.149
 a big mashed paper mom 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:52.840
 mine was just a few away 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:54.789
 centimeters after so many centimeters after the 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.090
 the free throw line now crockett 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:59.750
 wrong the first but it was not bad 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.100
 you will try crockett again 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.170
 to respond to the smash of 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.840
 lombardi is not easy try the proof 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:09.280
 his first dunk jake locker 23 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:13.610
 years from tortona ball made bouncing 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:16.130
 also wrong the second time 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.860
 public applauds the ride and there 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.750
 try again without even thinking about it once 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:26.540
 this time he goes to crush 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:29.840
 vote 8 and a half from the middle and now you have to 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.770
 invent croquettes to find separately 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.750
 from behind 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:37.100
 part from behind and I said to try 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:43.070
 overturning 98 ready for Lombardy is not 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:45.710
 easy 45 large flattened but Lombard 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:47.840
 has already won though 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:51.560
 instead a 10 vote because if crushed 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.500
 it's a nice 9 I gave it is the name of 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:57.370
 we see but the victory of the Lombards 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:03:02.260
 because it takes 94 crockett gene 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:02.260
 and then the winner will be eric lombardi 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.440
 here is the eric view of Lombardy 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.660
 wins the crush competition 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.970
 I don't know how this direction can hurt 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.850
 never review a huge deal 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.980
 the second 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:19.800
 lombardi clearly do not want to do 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:22.290
 compare with anyone but not just the data 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.940
 at the beach to disconnect from the line, here it is 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.970
 here satisfied immediately 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:29.340
 look at it and take off this is a big one 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:33.210
 crushed gentlemen this is a super 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.890
 crush all lombardi really good 

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:37.440
 memories of those who took off from linen when 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:39.690
 crushed we are for a make comparisons 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.950
 irreverent but they say bards really 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:46.340
 a boy with athletic skills 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:49.050
 crazy awarded by claudio coldebella 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:51.360
 beautiful really a big dunk 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:53.310
 the second, perhaps the first, was Julia 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.680
 shaved broad sleeve with eric lombardi 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:59.070
 but in my opinion this is the second 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.840
 deserved award from the boy of 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:04.200
 rotor that goes to journey with 11 points of 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:07.430
 average per game and almost 4 rebounds 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:11.030
 wins the race of dunks moreover 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:13.500
 his year in biella has doubled 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:15.390
 the average points of the past year or of 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.640
 regulator that has before him not 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:21.660
 ricardo possibility of remarkable growth 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:24.740
 he was at the age of 21 in the ancient path 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:28.760
 it is physically already very ready side 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:30.860
 especially also also in the connecting rod has 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:33.590
 many minutes available 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:36.140
 and it really is 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:38.420
 gaining more and more trust in the 

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:41.240
 his coach accordingly always has 

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:43.160
 more chance to show off 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.260
 his athletic skills but not just because he is 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:48.650
 a player who really is 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:51.470
 improving year after year so it is a 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:54.100
 very interesting prospect a lot 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:54.100
 Interesting
