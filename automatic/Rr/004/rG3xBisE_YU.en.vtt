00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:48.690
 We are going to work a scarf. 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.239
 You will need this the other supreme 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.210
 aunt 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:58.559
 but the supreme rainbow of the novel in the same color 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.699
 or closely with clover needle 2.25 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.180
 mm 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:06.090
 the first step of our son is 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.729
 to hit points we will start a 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:13.350
 Come back where they start a babadinho you 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:15.060
 will cut off the previous forum is 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:20.330
 that you can do a job with 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:25.590
 beautiful finish cut here 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:28.530
 separating pointing out it's crooked 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:31.190
 now with the left or the favela 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:35.160
 We're going to burn at the base of the fire. 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:36.960
 taking care not to get 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:44.280
 black at first we go to the 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:49.009
 left on the base and let's burn a 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.009
 little here criminal wire of spinning 

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:54.939
 affecting the dots 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.920
 watch how it looks 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:07.549
 after completing the lateral closing with 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:11.000
 fire we will equip this way notes 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:15.080
 and we will introduce the needle into the threads 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.150
 Take the two sides and take the child. 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:21.620
 supreme 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:24.200
 step inside the assu one point in the 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:28.850
 same place has a low point 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:35.480
 holding your prisoner 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:38.870
 let's go ahead in the next space 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:42.819
 and here we'll make think the box 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:45.110
 the classic a low on the next 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:48.590
 next matches 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:52.190
 loop passes under a low point 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:55.640
 next step because I enter with the 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:03:00.609
 point of the city in the next losing 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:05.570
 only one wire tie with one point the team 

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:09.320
 the next confrontation of the afternoon and we will 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:18.530
 continue to observe how it is forming 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:19.760
 frill 2 next step tie the vote on 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:27.739
 next 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:30.739
 I think the forrÃ³ the next tie a point 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:34.280
 We're going to make it like the whole 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:36.380
 ball at the end you will do 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:39.579
 exactly the same consolation 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.579
 What did you do at the beginning? 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:48.460
 the last two spaces 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:52.140
 We're going back and working together. 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:59.580
 the two wires here making the low 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:59.580
 and in the corner to cast off like this 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:07.120
 reached the end of our play even 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:10.080
 way now we're going to put every piece 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.080
 to the same side 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:20.260
 doing this comes rolling up to the end 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:24.100
 here the chains with the line and the supreme 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:31.300
 faces the same side to 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:34.210
 people joined one part to another was 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:37.450
 the whole piece rolled up we'll get it 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:40.090
 tip where we started golf is in 

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:42.610
 needle at the end and you will enter 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:48.420
 in this first point and will make here a 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:48.420
 very low point closing the big circus 

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:54.370
 Now we're going to work closing the 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:05:01.000
 our part the world with a part of 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:05:03.880
 cache like the other like that make a 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:08.740
 chain inserts needle into the first 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:11.310
 point one side and the other loop defect 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:14.950
 step inside making a low 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:20.230
 next in the next low point of a 

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:24.520
 side makes the point of the area in the 

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:26.950
 close to one side and the other a point 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:28.180
 underneath we are joining a part of the 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:30.550
 scarf 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:36.910
 the ultrapar then shifting as a 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:42.720
 double scarf making it across the 

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:42.720
 extension of our part 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:47.820
 on one side and the other 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:52.530
 Watch how you sing 

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:59.200
 I got to the end already cut the wire 

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:04.150
 step inside and here we go 

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:07.260
 cast off the tip between peoples and 

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:07.260
 to carry people 

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:23.240
 Our ready piece is going to stay like this. 

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:23.240
 needs bad 

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:39.730
 the play speaks our ready piece is going to stay 

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:39.730
 so she did not go there and I stayed
