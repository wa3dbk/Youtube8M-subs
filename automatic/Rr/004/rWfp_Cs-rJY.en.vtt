00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
it's moderated and managed and at the

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.869 
it's moderated and managed and at the
moment<00:02:10.020> it<00:02:10.440> seems<00:02:10.649> to<00:02:10.860> be<00:02:10.950> one<00:02:11.160> extreme<00:02:11.610> to<00:02:11.640> the

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.170 
moment it seems to be one extreme to the
other<00:02:11.970> so<00:02:12.450> we<00:02:12.720> need<00:02:12.840> to

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180
