hey guys and gals Brandon here with
another<00:00:02.490> Church<00:00:02.790> stage<00:00:03.149> design<00:00:03.600> idea<00:00:04.020> what

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
another Church stage design idea what

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.309 
another Church stage design idea what
you<00:00:04.560> see<00:00:04.740> behind<00:00:05.130> me<00:00:05.220> we<00:00:05.970> call<00:00:06.210> a<00:00:06.240> woven<00:00:07.080> wall

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
you see behind me we call a woven wall

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.560 
you see behind me we call a woven wall
or<00:00:07.589> a<00:00:07.620> warped<00:00:08.010> wall<00:00:08.189> what<00:00:08.790> we<00:00:08.910> did<00:00:09.120> is<00:00:09.269> we<00:00:09.360> took

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
or a warped wall what we did is we took

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.280 
or a warped wall what we did is we took
some<00:00:09.840> coroplast<00:00:10.550> this<00:00:11.550> is<00:00:11.849> actually<00:00:12.540> eight

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
some coroplast this is actually eight

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.950 
some coroplast this is actually eight
four<00:00:14.099> by<00:00:14.309> eight<00:00:14.340> sheets<00:00:14.910> we<00:00:15.120> got<00:00:15.269> a<00:00:15.299> coral<00:00:15.750> claw

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
four by eight sheets we got a coral claw

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.750 
four by eight sheets we got a coral claw
it's<00:00:16.320> a<00:00:16.470> core<00:00:16.740> plastic<00:00:17.160> cutter<00:00:17.310> we<00:00:17.460> got<00:00:17.580> it<00:00:17.670> on

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
it's a core plastic cutter we got it on

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.200 
it's a core plastic cutter we got it on
Amazon<00:00:18.270> it<00:00:19.140> cuts<00:00:19.619> the<00:00:19.890> coroplast<00:00:20.460> down<00:00:21.000> the

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
Amazon it cuts the coroplast down the

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.660 
Amazon it cuts the coroplast down the
flutes<00:00:21.510> which<00:00:21.810> is<00:00:21.990> lengthwise<00:00:22.500> so<00:00:22.859> what<00:00:23.609> we

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
flutes which is lengthwise so what we

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.250 
flutes which is lengthwise so what we
did<00:00:23.760> is<00:00:23.850> we<00:00:23.880> took<00:00:24.029> a<00:00:24.150> four<00:00:24.390> by<00:00:24.510> eight<00:00:24.539> sheet<00:00:24.720> and

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
did is we took a four by eight sheet and

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.450 
did is we took a four by eight sheet and
we<00:00:25.350> cut<00:00:25.529> it<00:00:25.619> into<00:00:25.800> four<00:00:26.430> up<00:00:26.720> for<00:00:27.800> one<00:00:28.800> foot

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
we cut it into four up for one foot

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.209 
we cut it into four up for one foot
strips<00:00:30.269> that<00:00:31.080> were<00:00:31.230> eight<00:00:31.439> feet<00:00:31.710> long<00:00:31.949> and

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
strips that were eight feet long and

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.330 
strips that were eight feet long and
then<00:00:32.700> we<00:00:32.850> built<00:00:33.180> four<00:00:34.110> frames<00:00:34.559> out<00:00:34.890> of<00:00:35.010> two<00:00:35.190> by

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
then we built four frames out of two by

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.940 
then we built four frames out of two by
fours<00:00:35.640> that<00:00:36.000> are<00:00:36.210> seven<00:00:37.020> feet<00:00:37.500> six<00:00:37.829> inches

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
fours that are seven feet six inches

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.299 
fours that are seven feet six inches
tall<00:00:38.160> by<00:00:38.879> seven<00:00:39.300> foot<00:00:39.570> wide<00:00:39.860> so<00:00:40.860> then<00:00:41.010> we<00:00:41.129> took

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
tall by seven foot wide so then we took

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.760 
tall by seven foot wide so then we took
the<00:00:41.520> eight<00:00:41.820> foot<00:00:42.540> piece<00:00:42.809> of<00:00:42.930> coroplast<00:00:43.350> and<00:00:43.710> we

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
the eight foot piece of coroplast and we

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.160 
the eight foot piece of coroplast and we
stapled<00:00:44.280> it<00:00:44.399> with<00:00:45.030> crown<00:00:45.300> staples<00:00:45.870> to<00:00:46.079> the

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
stapled it with crown staples to the

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.220 
stapled it with crown staples to the
ends<00:00:46.590> of<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:47.070> seven<00:00:47.610> foot<00:00:47.940> frame<00:00:48.629> which

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
ends of the seven foot frame which

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.680 
ends of the seven foot frame which
allowed<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.920> core<00:00:50.129> Plast<00:00:50.460> to<00:00:51.120> bow<00:00:51.360> either

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
allowed the core Plast to bow either

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:52.939 
allowed the core Plast to bow either
forwards<00:00:52.170> or<00:00:52.260> backwards<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:52.710> I'll<00:00:52.770> show<00:00:52.920> you

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
forwards or backwards and I'll show you

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.500 
forwards or backwards and I'll show you
that<00:00:53.070> in<00:00:53.160> just<00:00:53.280> a<00:00:53.399> minute<00:00:53.489> it<00:00:53.699> flexes<00:00:54.149> really

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
that in just a minute it flexes really

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.240 
that in just a minute it flexes really
easily<00:00:54.809> one<00:00:55.079> way<00:00:55.230> or<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.410> other<00:00:55.440> even<00:00:55.980> after

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
easily one way or the other even after

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.639 
easily one way or the other even after
its<00:00:56.370> assembled<00:00:56.789> and<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.930> reason<00:00:58.199> we<00:00:58.320> built<00:00:58.469> a

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
its assembled and the reason we built a

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.740 
its assembled and the reason we built a
seven<00:00:59.129> and<00:00:59.370> a<00:00:59.520> half<00:00:59.550> foot<00:01:00.090> frame<00:01:00.359> instead<00:01:00.660> of

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
seven and a half foot frame instead of

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.450 
seven and a half foot frame instead of
an<00:01:00.840> eight<00:01:00.930> foot<00:01:01.109> frame<00:01:01.379> is<00:01:01.590> because<00:01:02.129> it's<00:01:02.280> home

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
an eight foot frame is because it's home

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.119 
an eight foot frame is because it's home
from<00:01:02.730> our<00:01:02.820> trust<00:01:03.149> with<00:01:03.420> bicycle<00:01:04.140> hooks<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:04.530> so

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
from our trust with bicycle hooks and so

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.980 
from our trust with bicycle hooks and so
the<00:01:05.339> extra<00:01:05.610> six<00:01:05.909> inches<00:01:06.210> actually<00:01:06.390> covers<00:01:06.900> up

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
the extra six inches actually covers up

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.480 
the extra six inches actually covers up
the<00:01:07.110> bicycle<00:01:07.260> hooks<00:01:07.740> and<00:01:07.920> so<00:01:08.010> you<00:01:08.070> don't<00:01:08.310> see

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
the bicycle hooks and so you don't see

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.149 
the bicycle hooks and so you don't see
any<00:01:08.700> of<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:08.909> attachments<00:01:09.360> up<00:01:10.049> there<00:01:10.260> we'll

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
any of the attachments up there we'll

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.859 
any of the attachments up there we'll
get<00:01:11.700> a<00:01:11.729> little<00:01:11.970> closer<00:01:12.180> and<00:01:12.330> we'll<00:01:12.630> show<00:01:12.780> you

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
get a little closer and we'll show you

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.289 
get a little closer and we'll show you
what<00:01:12.990> it<00:01:13.049> looks<00:01:13.170> like<00:01:13.320> from<00:01:14.220> there<00:01:14.400> so<00:01:15.090> this<00:01:15.210> is

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
what it looks like from there so this is

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.660 
what it looks like from there so this is
a<00:01:15.360> little<00:01:15.450> closer<00:01:15.720> look<00:01:16.020> at<00:01:16.530> our<00:01:16.590> set<00:01:17.340> design

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
a little closer look at our set design

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.060 
a little closer look at our set design
this<00:01:18.000> is<00:01:18.299> one<00:01:18.720> foot<00:01:19.020> of<00:01:19.170> coroplast<00:01:19.650> that<00:01:19.950> we

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
this is one foot of coroplast that we

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.340 
this is one foot of coroplast that we
cut<00:01:20.310> lengthwise<00:01:20.700> down<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.299> flutes<00:01:21.570> we<00:01:22.170> just

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
cut lengthwise down the flutes we just

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.960 
cut lengthwise down the flutes we just
use<00:01:22.500> some<00:01:22.650> crown<00:01:22.890> staples<00:01:23.369> right<00:01:23.430> here<00:01:23.759> on<00:01:23.880> the

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
use some crown staples right here on the

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.910 
use some crown staples right here on the
end<00:01:24.119> and<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.420> same<00:01:24.630> on<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.869> other<00:01:24.900> side<00:01:25.080> this

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
end and the same on the other side this

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.070 
end and the same on the other side this
allows<00:01:26.250> them<00:01:26.700> to<00:01:26.939> bend<00:01:27.240> really<00:01:27.570> easily<00:01:27.869> I'll

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
allows them to bend really easily I'll

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.510 
allows them to bend really easily I'll
grab<00:01:28.259> this<00:01:28.409> one<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:28.619> pull<00:01:28.860> it<00:01:28.950> forward<00:01:28.979> so<00:01:29.460> you

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
grab this one and pull it forward so you

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.490 
grab this one and pull it forward so you
can<00:01:29.729> see<00:01:29.939> and<00:01:30.750> it'll<00:01:30.930> hold<00:01:31.079> that<00:01:31.259> shape

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
can see and it'll hold that shape

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.289 
can see and it'll hold that shape
forward<00:01:32.009> so<00:01:32.220> if<00:01:32.310> you<00:01:32.430> need<00:01:32.549> it<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:32.820> stack<00:01:33.090> them

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
forward so if you need it to stack them

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.480 
forward so if you need it to stack them
and<00:01:33.360> move<00:01:33.600> them<00:01:33.630> we<00:01:34.229> move<00:01:34.439> ours<00:01:34.799> weekly<00:01:35.220> for

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
and move them we move ours weekly for

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.060 
and move them we move ours weekly for
different<00:01:35.850> services<00:01:36.299> and<00:01:37.140> so<00:01:37.530> this<00:01:37.740> has<00:01:37.890> been

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
different services and so this has been

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.340 
different services and so this has been
a<00:01:38.369> useful<00:01:38.759> part<00:01:39.210> kind<00:01:39.540> of<00:01:39.600> a<00:01:39.659> byproduct<00:01:39.840> of

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
a useful part kind of a byproduct of

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.350 
a useful part kind of a byproduct of
that<00:01:40.409> and<00:01:40.740> so<00:01:40.860> they<00:01:40.979> just<00:01:41.009> fold<00:01:41.430> forwards<00:01:42.240> or

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
that and so they just fold forwards or

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.929 
that and so they just fold forwards or
backwards<00:01:42.649> we<00:01:43.649> had<00:01:44.040> toyed<00:01:44.280> with<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.549> idea<00:01:44.579> of

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
backwards we had toyed with the idea of

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.969 
backwards we had toyed with the idea of
covering<00:01:45.420> up<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.570> staples<00:01:46.140> but<00:01:46.409> honestly<00:01:46.799> by

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
covering up the staples but honestly by

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.139 
covering up the staples but honestly by
the<00:01:47.009> time<00:01:47.250> you<00:01:47.399> get<00:01:47.520> about<00:01:47.670> ten<00:01:47.939> or<00:01:48.119> twelve

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
the time you get about ten or twelve

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.050 
the time you get about ten or twelve
feet<00:01:48.659> away<00:01:48.810> from<00:01:48.960> it<00:01:49.200> you<00:01:49.350> don't<00:01:49.500> even<00:01:49.649> see<00:01:49.860> it

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
feet away from it you don't even see it

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.490 
feet away from it you don't even see it
the<00:01:51.060> little<00:01:51.270> crown<00:01:51.479> staples<00:01:51.930> and<00:01:52.049> so<00:01:52.170> we<00:01:52.320> just

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
the little crown staples and so we just

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.940 
the little crown staples and so we just
decided<00:01:53.159> to<00:01:53.340> leave<00:01:53.549> them<00:01:53.700> like<00:01:53.909> that<00:01:54.950> an

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
decided to leave them like that an

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.190 
decided to leave them like that an
unintended<00:01:56.520> side<00:01:57.240> benefit<00:01:57.689> of<00:01:57.810> this<00:01:57.899> set<00:01:58.170> is

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
unintended side benefit of this set is

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.080 
unintended side benefit of this set is
that<00:01:58.380> this<00:01:58.979> has<00:01:59.130> also<00:01:59.310> created<00:01:59.640> a<00:01:59.850> really

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
that this has also created a really

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.090 
that this has also created a really
interesting<00:02:00.420> projection<00:02:01.170> surface<00:02:01.380> so<00:02:01.979> we

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
interesting projection surface so we

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.709 
interesting projection surface so we
have<00:02:02.250> used<00:02:02.520> our<00:02:02.670> projectors<00:02:03.240> in<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.479> rear<00:02:03.689> of
