00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.410 

I<00:01:07.619> think<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.250> reason<00:01:08.610> why<00:01:08.700> he<00:01:08.970> hit<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.240> wall

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
I think the reason why he hit the wall

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.880 
I think the reason why he hit the wall
Jeb<00:01:09.780> didn't<00:01:10.020> did<00:01:10.110> you<00:01:10.170> hear<00:01:10.380> him<00:01:10.500> try<00:01:10.650> to<00:01:10.680> get

back in the gas he had already gotten it
okay<00:01:13.200> it<00:01:13.560> was<00:01:13.799> I<00:01:15.619> think<00:01:16.619> he<00:01:16.710> tried<00:01:16.920> to<00:01:16.950> hit<00:01:17.430> the

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
okay it was I think he tried to hit the

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.430 
okay it was I think he tried to hit the

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:22.440 
gas to get it to hook up for him that's

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.910 
gas to get it to hook up for him that's
a<00:01:22.619> hard<00:01:23.899> way<00:01:24.899> that<00:01:24.930> one<00:01:25.229> maybe<00:01:25.409> even<00:01:25.560> worse

that<00:01:54.780> gas<00:01:55.050> up<00:01:55.319> to<00:01:55.470> keep<00:01:55.619> it<00:01:55.710> out<00:01:55.860> of<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:56.039> wall

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 
that gas up to keep it out of the wall

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:57.770 
that gas up to keep it out of the wall
and<00:01:56.250> it<00:01:56.520> might<00:01:56.729> actually<00:01:56.909> shot<00:01:57.420> it<00:01:57.539> in<00:01:57.600> there<00:01:57.750> a

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
and it might actually shot it in there a

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.419 
and it might actually shot it in there a
little<00:01:57.929> harder<00:01:58.350> that's<00:01:58.710> a<00:01:58.830> decision<00:01:59.130> these

00:01:59.419 --> 00:01:59.429 
little harder that's a decision these

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:00.740 
little harder that's a decision these
guys<00:01:59.610> have<00:01:59.819> to<00:01:59.940> make<00:02:00.119> they've<00:02:00.360> got<00:02:00.509> to<00:02:00.630> say

guys have to make they've got to say
well<00:02:00.899> okay<00:02:01.110> I'm<00:02:01.229> sliding<00:02:01.740> a<00:02:01.800> little<00:02:01.830> bit<00:02:02.130> can<00:02:02.970> I

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
well okay I'm sliding a little bit can I

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.309 
well okay I'm sliding a little bit can I
give<00:02:03.179> it<00:02:03.210> enough<00:02:03.479> gas<00:02:03.659> to<00:02:03.690> keep<00:02:03.929> it<00:02:04.050> out<00:02:04.140> of<00:02:04.259> the

00:02:04.309 --> 00:02:04.319 
give it enough gas to keep it out of the

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:05.779 
give it enough gas to keep it out of the
wall<00:02:04.440> do<00:02:04.619> I<00:02:04.649> give<00:02:04.800> it<00:02:04.830> all<00:02:05.069> the<00:02:05.220> gas<00:02:05.369> to<00:02:05.550> try<00:02:05.729> to

00:02:05.779 --> 00:02:05.789 
wall do I give it all the gas to try to

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:07.790 
wall do I give it all the gas to try to
spin<00:02:06.090> it<00:02:06.119> all<00:02:06.300> the<00:02:06.420> way<00:02:06.509> around<00:02:06.770> really<00:02:07.770> a

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 
spin it all the way around really a

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.940 
spin it all the way around really a
tough<00:02:08.069> decision<00:02:09.259> see<00:02:10.259> he<00:02:10.380> got<00:02:10.530> a<00:02:10.560> little<00:02:10.860> bit

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
tough decision see he got a little bit

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.319 
tough decision see he got a little bit
of<00:02:11.039> loose<00:02:11.190> and<00:02:11.220> then<00:02:11.489> by<00:02:11.610> the<00:02:11.670> time<00:02:11.910> he<00:02:12.060> caught

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:12.329 
of loose and then by the time he caught

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:14.360 
of loose and then by the time he caught
it<00:02:12.510> he<00:02:12.630> caught<00:02:12.840> it<00:02:12.989> one<00:02:13.170> time<00:02:13.470> and<00:02:13.739> then<00:02:14.130> it<00:02:14.160> had

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
it he caught it one time and then it had

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:15.830 
it he caught it one time and then it had
him<00:02:14.489> up<00:02:14.700> the<00:02:14.880> racetrack<00:02:15.060> so<00:02:15.299> he<00:02:15.510> had<00:02:15.600> a<00:02:15.630> little

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
him up the racetrack so he had a little

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.960 
him up the racetrack so he had a little
less<00:02:16.049> room<00:02:16.380> you<00:02:17.250> know<00:02:17.340> had<00:02:17.489> that<00:02:17.519> had<00:02:17.790> not

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
less room you know had that had not

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.220 
less room you know had that had not
happened<00:02:18.120> on<00:02:18.390> the<00:02:18.510> in<00:02:18.750> the<00:02:18.870> middle<00:02:19.110> of<00:02:19.170> the

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
happened on the in the middle of the

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:20.539 
happened on the in the middle of the
racetrack<00:02:19.560> but<00:02:19.590> it<00:02:19.739> happened<00:02:19.980> on<00:02:20.070> the<00:02:20.190> bottom

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:20.549 
racetrack but it happened on the bottom

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:21.890 
racetrack but it happened on the bottom
then<00:02:21.000> he<00:02:21.090> might<00:02:21.239> have<00:02:21.360> had<00:02:21.450> a<00:02:21.480> chance<00:02:21.780> of

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
then he might have had a chance of

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.240 
then he might have had a chance of
keeping<00:02:22.019> it<00:02:22.230> out<00:02:22.260> of<00:02:22.320> the<00:02:22.410> wall<00:02:22.590> you<00:02:23.010> see<00:02:23.190> he

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
keeping it out of the wall you see he

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.770 
keeping it out of the wall you see he
gets<00:02:23.340> he<00:02:23.549> Wiggles<00:02:23.880> right<00:02:24.030> here<00:02:24.180> then<00:02:24.329> chases

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
gets he Wiggles right here then chases

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.080 
gets he Wiggles right here then chases
it<00:02:24.930> and<00:02:25.560> he<00:02:25.680> chases<00:02:26.070> it<00:02:26.220> he's<00:02:26.519> already<00:02:26.790> up

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
it and he chases it he's already up

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.260 
it and he chases it he's already up
about<00:02:27.630> two<00:02:27.840> lanes

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:35.350 

becoming<00:02:32.270> a<00:02:32.420> familiar<00:02:32.900> sight<00:02:33.260> now

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
becoming a familiar sight now

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.910 
becoming a familiar sight now
poultra<00:02:36.360> had<00:02:36.510> just<00:02:36.810> done<00:02:36.989> it<00:02:37.140> before<00:02:37.319> Brendan

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
poultra had just done it before Brendan

Newberry<00:02:38.690> Michael<00:02:39.690> I<00:02:39.720> think<00:02:39.930> right<00:02:40.590> I<00:02:40.620> think

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
Newberry Michael I think right I think

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:42.649 
Newberry Michael I think right I think
that's<00:02:41.010> a<00:02:41.159> situation<00:02:41.400> where<00:02:41.909> got<00:02:42.480> in<00:02:42.599> the

00:02:42.649 --> 00:02:42.659 
that's a situation where got in the

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:45.530 
that's a situation where got in the
throttle<00:02:43.080> at<00:02:43.170> the<00:02:43.319> exact<00:02:43.620> wrong<00:02:43.860> time<00:02:44.540> the

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
throttle at the exact wrong time the

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.780 
throttle at the exact wrong time the
right<00:02:45.720> idea<00:02:46.140> just<00:02:46.650> it<00:02:46.890> was<00:02:47.010> it<00:02:47.370> was<00:02:47.489> a<00:02:47.519> little

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
right idea just it was it was a little

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.190 
right idea just it was it was a little
bit<00:02:47.879> too<00:02:48.000> far<00:02:48.209> around<00:02:48.360> when<00:02:48.750> he<00:02:48.840> jumped<00:02:49.080> in<00:02:49.170> the

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
bit too far around when he jumped in the

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.650 
bit too far around when he jumped in the
throttle
