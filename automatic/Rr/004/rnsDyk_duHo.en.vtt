just<00:01:56.680> full<00:01:57.130> of<00:01:57.340> atmosphere<00:01:58.119> and<00:01:58.299> they<00:01:59.080> capture

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
just full of atmosphere and they capture

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.100 
just full of atmosphere and they capture
that<00:01:59.710> simpler<00:02:00.310> time<00:02:00.520> in<00:02:00.729> gaming<00:02:01.090> but<00:02:01.570> with<00:02:01.900> so

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
that simpler time in gaming but with so

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.190 
that simpler time in gaming but with so
much<00:02:02.259> detail<00:02:02.590> and<00:02:03.070> so<00:02:03.670> much<00:02:03.880> kind<00:02:04.210> of<00:02:04.360> life<00:02:04.840> to

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
much detail and so much kind of life to

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.740 
much detail and so much kind of life to
them<00:02:05.439> that<00:02:05.860> it<00:02:06.100> just<00:02:06.430> drags<00:02:07.090> you<00:02:07.330> into<00:02:07.479> this

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
them that it just drags you into this

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.839 
them that it just drags you into this
world<00:02:07.810> in<00:02:08.259> a<00:02:08.319> way<00:02:08.349> that<00:02:08.679> I<00:02:08.830> haven't<00:02:09.310> really<00:02:09.549> had

00:02:09.839 --> 00:02:09.849 
world in a way that I haven't really had

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:12.690 
world in a way that I haven't really had
from<00:02:10.149> a<00:02:10.239> game<00:02:10.419> for<00:02:11.319> a<00:02:11.349> very<00:02:11.590> long<00:02:11.859> time<00:02:11.919> it's

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
from a game for a very long time it's

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.800 
from a game for a very long time it's
certainly<00:02:13.120> a<00:02:13.180> much<00:02:13.359> more<00:02:13.540> involving<00:02:14.230> game

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
certainly a much more involving game

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.140 
certainly a much more involving game
than<00:02:15.020> many<00:02:15.590> out<00:02:15.800> there<00:02:15.830> and<00:02:16.280> one<00:02:16.550> that<00:02:16.760> will

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
than many out there and one that will

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.059
