it's<00:00:57.899> still<00:00:58.140> a<00:00:58.199> go<00:00:58.469> to<00:00:58.530> I<00:00:58.949> love<00:00:59.609> it<00:00:59.789> to<00:01:00.120> use

before<00:01:00.570> I<00:01:00.840> wear<00:01:01.079> lipstick<00:01:01.440> or<00:01:01.620> something<00:01:01.980> this

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
before I wear lipstick or something this

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.870 
before I wear lipstick or something this
is<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.120> EOS<00:01:03.690> in<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.110> tube<00:01:04.379> which<00:01:05.070> I<00:01:05.400> think

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
is the EOS in the tube which I think

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.530 
is the EOS in the tube which I think
doesn't<00:01:06.180> get<00:01:06.270> enough<00:01:06.530> props<00:01:08.150> vanilla<00:01:09.150> and

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
doesn't get enough props vanilla and

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.899 
doesn't get enough props vanilla and
it's<00:01:10.530> like<00:01:10.770> butter<00:01:11.040> might<00:01:11.369> as<00:01:11.520> well<00:01:11.700> use

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
it's like butter might as well use

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.249 
it's like butter might as well use
that's<00:01:12.270> all<00:01:12.450> that's<00:01:12.600> left<00:01:12.869> in<00:01:13.140> it<00:01:14.960> it's<00:01:15.960> like

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
that's all that's left in it it's like

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.289 
that's all that's left in it it's like
butter<00:01:16.530> it<00:01:16.740> smells<00:01:17.100> very<00:01:17.340> good<00:01:17.490> when<00:01:18.270> I

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
butter it smells very good when I

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.630

compare<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.900> two<00:01:19.229> eos<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:20.100> each<00:01:20.220> other<00:01:20.430> to

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
compare the two eos to each other to

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.810 
compare the two eos to each other to

the<00:04:47.700> first<00:04:48.120> day<00:04:48.389> I<00:04:48.450> used<00:04:48.810> it<00:04:49.050> it<00:04:49.229> broke<00:04:49.680> that's

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.130 
the first day I used it it broke that's

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:53.870 
the first day I used it it broke that's
how<00:04:50.340> soft<00:04:50.669> it<00:04:50.880> is<00:04:51.800> $25<00:04:52.800> and<00:04:53.040> it's<00:04:53.400> all<00:04:53.580> jacked

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.880 
how soft it is $25 and it's all jacked

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.409 
how soft it is $25 and it's all jacked
up<00:04:54.030> that's<00:04:54.900> just<00:04:55.260> not<00:04:55.530> okay<00:04:55.560> for<00:04:55.830> me<00:04:56.240> if<00:04:57.240> this

00:04:57.409 --> 00:04:57.419 
up that's just not okay for me if this

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:02.180 
up that's just not okay for me if this
was<00:04:57.600> the<00:04:57.630> full<00:04:57.870> size<00:04:58.080> would<00:04:58.320> be<00:04:58.350> $25<00:05:00.860> it's<00:05:01.860> not

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.190 
was the full size would be $25 it's not

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:05.480 
was the full size would be $25 it's not
worth<00:05:02.460> that<00:05:02.639> much<00:05:02.820> money<00:05:03.290> five<00:05:04.290> dollars<00:05:04.800> maybe

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.490 
worth that much money five dollars maybe

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:09.409 
worth that much money five dollars maybe
but<00:05:06.240> I<00:05:06.419> would<00:05:06.660> just<00:05:06.870> get<00:05:07.640> the<00:05:08.640> soft<00:05:08.940> lips<00:05:09.270> I

be<00:05:51.450> the<00:05:51.600> lip<00:05:51.780> quench<00:05:52.110> because<00:05:52.950> I<00:05:52.979> don't<00:05:53.220> have

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:53.280 
be the lip quench because I don't have

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:55.340 
be the lip quench because I don't have
to<00:05:53.460> reapply<00:05:53.760> it<00:05:53.880> at<00:05:54.030> night<00:05:54.210> I<00:05:54.450> might<00:05:54.930> try<00:05:55.110> some

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:55.350 
to reapply it at night I might try some

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:58.370 
to reapply it at night I might try some
of<00:05:55.380> the<00:05:55.500> other<00:05:55.680> products<00:05:56.250> we<00:05:57.090> shall<00:05:57.300> see<00:05:57.570> but<00:05:58.229> I

00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:58.380 
of the other products we shall see but I

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:01.490 
of the other products we shall see but I
think<00:05:58.590> you<00:05:58.680> get<00:05:58.889> a<00:05:59.190> little<00:05:59.700> more<00:06:00.289> you<00:06:01.289> get<00:06:01.470> a

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:01.500 
think you get a little more you get a

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:03.110 
think you get a little more you get a
little<00:06:01.710> more<00:06:01.889> product<00:06:02.370> in<00:06:02.490> the<00:06:02.580> derm<00:06:02.820> store

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:03.120 
little more product in the derm store

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:06.260 
little more product in the derm store
lip<00:06:03.330> quench<00:06:03.690> but<00:06:04.470> not<00:06:05.430> enough<00:06:05.850> for<00:06:05.880> there<00:06:06.240> to

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:06.270 
lip quench but not enough for there to

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:10.219 
lip quench but not enough for there to
be<00:06:06.419> like<00:06:06.720> basically<00:06:07.650> the<00:06:07.800> pay<00:06:07.979> double<00:06:08.539> so<00:06:09.539> if<00:06:10.050> I

00:06:10.219 --> 00:06:10.229 
be like basically the pay double so if I

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:12.140 
be like basically the pay double so if I
didn't<00:06:10.500> care<00:06:10.620> about<00:06:10.680> price<00:06:11.100> I'd<00:06:11.370> say<00:06:11.610> lip

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:12.150 
didn't care about price I'd say lip

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:14.930 
didn't care about price I'd say lip

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:14.940 
quench and I'm just not going to get so

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:16.250 
quench and I'm just not going to get so
I<00:06:14.970> guess<00:06:15.180> it<00:06:15.270> would<00:06:15.390> between<00:06:15.720> these<00:06:16.020> three

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:16.260 
I guess it would between these three

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:16.970 
I guess it would between these three
