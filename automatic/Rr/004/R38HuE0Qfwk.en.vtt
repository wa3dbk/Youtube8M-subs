00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.390
 and well this year 2010 the guitar points like p the abutments the spikes 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.549
 people gathered greenhouse it looks crazy so eh ben issoudun 

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:13.820
 and suddenly what do they live more together and by points like and then 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:14.660
 to do it 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.660
 the thing that makes all cully players dream 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:20.919
 the thing here 

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:24.279
 a good day milk or to play and if you go on the sharpest 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:27.409
 and a forum on which we discuss to say to ourselves full of technical things and 

00:00:27.409 --> 00:00:28.849
 other artistic 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:31.569
 there are outright small sub-categories of es8 then wooden 

00:00:31.569 --> 00:00:34.399
 to standards as a dominican knight vegetable that we often talk about 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:35.170
 dacquois com 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.850
 and also d restorers like only with the fight club miss 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.410
 panic vehicles and tahitians 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:44.850
 there are also banjos the idea so it's a good day of the well the batteries 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.950
 makes a good turn here is very small and if a tuning fork of the well with a handle of the 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.940
 well and so it's a nice part we had already presented the year 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.769
 last the banjos pu cumulate bruno torrès 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:00:59.249
 so I'm not even telling you even the quality of the work is 

00:00:59.249 --> 00:01:02.010
 really always possible gorgeous 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.000
 whereas today there is a novelty is that there is a little more 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.340
 big so it's called soprano 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:08.710
 with a flow of six 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.970
 that's pretty accurate but it's important here 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.500
 and I was from 8 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.160
 instead the long and strong arm in the balloon in life promises the 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:16.990
 foursome the balloon in the city to do things 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:18.770
 over eight years old she also has her limitations 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.680
 this is it does not do stupidity 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.750
 So here we are, we are sure of different tuning fork 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.560
 it is like that without too much clash because otherwise bruno 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:27.660
 torrès land here 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.580
 the blues are tearing off the guys but I'm going to the top of the standings on this 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.870
 point the vehicles that wanted head level distance 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:35.649
 a little bit in swiss here 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:38.789
 so it's a concert and then the gigs we play this morning are going 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:39.320
 listen 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.439
 the difference already from his team avid two instruments 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:45.740
 to see what does it mean to have a bole of river systems 8 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.939
 to listen to that immediately for example an empty it's like that 6 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.860
 Why 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.030
 africa 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.830
 him 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:56.860
 obama 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.860
 for 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:06.999
 last year we had already tried exactly what man his 

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:12.270
 little brother then six he offered a small pc at the level of the most 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:12.919
 cumulate 

00:02:12.919 --> 00:02:14.379
 concert 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:17.830
 sir bruno torrès the one who makes the time factor plays for 

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:20.279
 not to lose playing the useful for the day 

00:02:20.279 --> 00:02:23.430
 and percent we will pay them all in the second part of our mission 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.700
 after the publicity say that the audience is rather passed it's a second 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:27.760
