00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:16.190
 until 6 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.119
 spring too good 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.160
 day 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:34.259
 conti 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.259
 it's just a stop 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.460
 so my dear ones have you in 

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:42.589
 already seen what we are today 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.379
 We do something with plaster today 

00:00:42.589 --> 00:00:48.379
 Of course, what do we need first? 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:50.329
 I have relationships very simple 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:51.500
 Construction and hobby plaster bought there you come 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:53.780
 to around two euros 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.600
 So how can you do nothing at all 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.640
 say so I have paper cups 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.710
 no plastic cups because they have no 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.600
 ugly talk but right 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.600
 partner brought and the costs also 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.530
 equal to ten pieces or so in europe 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.420
 approximately 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:12.860
 then we have a scissors a spoon 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:17.979
 Can you find my more fan with here 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:21.380
 Well then we need oh so then 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:23.090
 tealights i have s or pay attention 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.069
 that you take the tealights you 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.020
 just so easily out there 

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:29.030
 so you can swap the new one 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:33.110
 if you want my other colors or 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:36.380
 so I have one I have your goal 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.819
 Be fair taxes is exactly five liters 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.500
 Of course, you do not need a master 

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:41.840
 so big can be a very simple plaster 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.880
 I take this mug but I just do it 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.729
 like to be with the big ones because of that 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:50.000
 not so rum strobl you can too 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:52.759
 Silicone sleeve take silicone sleeve silicone 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.520
 baking dish of course so we just want 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:56.299
 start mixing 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.159
 it is not right 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:58.579
 Mixing ratio what I tell you 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:00.770
 can 

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:03.649
 I can only say he should 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.990
 Pay attention is very fluid because if he is 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:06.920
 the departure becomes too firm and you can 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.899
 then not really at all 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:15.070
 work and of course that was very 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:15.070
 it 's a pity to take a few tips 1 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:27.340
 so that should be a good deal and long 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.510
 then he just adds water only 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.510
 a bit and then just 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:34.960
 stir and then you can already see 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.860
 as the consistency should be very 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:42.870
 be fluid 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:42.870
 Nevertheless , it attracts everything beautifully and 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:58.290
 simply splashes nicely 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:03:02.530
 choose if you did that then 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:04.900
 Do you take a plastic paper yes 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.740
 of course and just filled in 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.740
 a little bit as one 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:18.569
 then take it up and drop it 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.390
 that's for the air 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:23.040
 the below plans is up comes so well 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:26.880
 You can not do that, do not worry 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:35.870
 so i feel with you a few 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:35.870
 are a bit crowded in front of me 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.640
 and again 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:53.760
 now my bucket is empty and me 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:55.070
 with the plaster you can find really nice 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:59.370
 I'll bring that aside 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:04:00.690
 super nice deco make the one therefore 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.180
 Of course you can borrow as well 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:04.590
 paint them with water color and 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:07.470
 acrylic paint or with nail polish 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:09.950
 my way and so you can completely 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:13.170
 individually his own very fast 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:14.730
 Deko are totally cool so it would have to 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:17.630
 we'll wait a bit for that 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:17.630
 just a few seconds 

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:26.910
 so you have dressed a bit now 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:30.090
 it is still very fluid so 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:32.400
 it's still pushing me but it's 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.930
 a bit already to no new 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.920
 you do not have to do it but me 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:40.470
 could not just go there 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:42.420
 I am and then just plug in 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:44.010
 that gets a bit high when you do that 

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:44.940
 you do not want to have to do it all the first 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:48.030
 press down time 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:51.390
 but that suits me very well 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:55.110
 present tealight deco from caps though 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:58.190
 it is a bit high so and now 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:02.460
 let's just dry it out and 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:04.950
 then we'll meet again soon 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:07.350
 mine is now dried back that 

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:09.270
 you also realize that it is so now 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:11.880
 staggered should be the am 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:13.620
 best again a few minutes or so 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:15.240
 even a two hours understand that 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.700
 to dry completely right now so 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:19.470
 about 10 million club and me 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:22.350
 can take that out like we did 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:26.070
 to get out of a cardboard box is quite 

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:28.520
 just take your scissors one 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:32.550
 a bit disgusting and 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:35.940
 simply cut as I know in plaster 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:38.400
 but purely that makes me be 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:39.150
 cut and then it could break 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:45.500
 tear 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:45.500
 that is a simple and around 

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:51.410
 broken job here a bit 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.410
 judge 

00:05:51.609 --> 00:05:57.559
 it works so now we have it too 

00:05:54.889 --> 00:05:59.149
 The first one is still outside 

00:05:57.559 --> 00:06:01.219
 a little fear only through 

00:05:59.149 --> 00:06:04.059
 dry and now always look up 

00:06:01.219 --> 00:06:16.989
 our silicone mold schumis are born 

00:06:04.059 --> 00:06:19.519
 get out of it three times already 

00:06:16.989 --> 00:06:21.799
 silicone mold I just should notice 

00:06:19.519 --> 00:06:23.809
 Allow to dry for longer than ten minutes 

00:06:21.799 --> 00:06:27.519
 although they are very beautiful , too , me 

00:06:23.809 --> 00:06:27.519
 have to say so I think that's totally cool 

00:06:29.949 --> 00:06:34.159
 and now we have three of them 

00:06:32.389 --> 00:06:36.289
 you see it was still very wet 

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:39.229
 from the inside so if you like silicones 

00:06:36.289 --> 00:06:40.669
 form works then let it in calmly 

00:06:39.229 --> 00:06:42.769
 a little longer through dry all-around 

00:06:40.669 --> 00:06:43.189
 longer the better he looks straight at 

00:06:42.769 --> 00:06:45.229
 me 

00:06:43.189 --> 00:06:46.549
 and although I'm cool too because of that 

00:06:45.229 --> 00:06:50.149
 She needed a little bit now 

00:06:46.549 --> 00:06:52.939
 look and as a special touch 

00:06:50.149 --> 00:06:54.499
 so that was already again 

00:06:52.939 --> 00:06:57.459
 the video of me i wanted you 

00:06:54.499 --> 00:06:59.659
 just show it as fast as that 

00:06:57.459 --> 00:07:01.209
 candlesticks can make deco elements 

00:06:59.659 --> 00:07:02.929
 you can also use test tubes 

00:07:01.209 --> 00:07:05.239
 work then you do take her 

00:07:02.929 --> 00:07:07.610
 just for example yogurt cups, the 

00:07:05.239 --> 00:07:10.189
 great yogurt cups will be great and for 

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:12.169
 the Ã¶sv with plaster and put in 

00:07:10.189 --> 00:07:15.129
 test tube rhine and with me too 

00:07:12.169 --> 00:07:16.999
 terrible could be the great flowers in it 

00:07:15.129 --> 00:07:19.669
 fold up the steps 

00:07:16.999 --> 00:07:21.199
 yes that's it from me myself 

00:07:19.669 --> 00:07:22.759
 Hope you liked the idea 

00:07:21.199 --> 00:07:27.229
 Of course I would be very happy if 

00:07:22.759 --> 00:07:27.919
 you also give me some photos of the ideas 

00:07:27.229 --> 00:07:29.689
 from me 

00:07:27.919 --> 00:07:32.839
 post on my facebook page or 

00:07:29.689 --> 00:07:36.969
 on Instagram just with me on it 

00:07:32.839 --> 00:07:40.099
 link or hashtag that would be great 

00:07:36.969 --> 00:07:42.680
 so that was mine and we'll see each other 

00:07:40.099 --> 00:07:44.830
 even at the next video on again 

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:44.830
 is
