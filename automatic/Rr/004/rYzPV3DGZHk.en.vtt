choppers<00:02:24.770> this<00:02:25.130> game<00:02:25.310> I<00:02:25.520> don't<00:02:26.150> know<00:02:26.240> but<00:02:26.420> it's

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
choppers this game I don't know but it's

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:33.040 
choppers this game I don't know but it's

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
it's ridiculous um yeah I'm basically I

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.260 
it's ridiculous um yeah I'm basically I
like<00:02:33.260> every<00:02:33.590> gun<00:02:33.800> in<00:02:33.830> this<00:02:34.070> game<00:02:34.310> honestly

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
like every gun in this game honestly

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.740 
like every gun in this game honestly
there<00:02:35.450> isn't<00:02:35.570> a<00:02:35.690> gun<00:02:35.930> that<00:02:35.960> I<00:02:36.140> do<00:02:36.230> not<00:02:36.500> like

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
there isn't a gun that I do not like

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.130 
there isn't a gun that I do not like
they<00:02:38.750> all<00:02:39.110> operate<00:02:39.350> very<00:02:40.150> tightly<00:02:41.150> and<00:02:41.720> I<00:02:41.960> like

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
they all operate very tightly and I like

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.810 
they all operate very tightly and I like
how<00:02:42.290> they<00:02:42.470> edit<00:02:42.920> you<00:02:43.070> know<00:02:43.190> a<00:02:43.400> little<00:02:43.640> bit

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:43.820 
how they edit you know a little bit

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.900 
how they edit you know a little bit
heavier<00:02:44.120> recoil<00:02:44.630> action<00:02:44.840> and<00:02:45.550> idle<00:02:46.550> sway<00:02:46.850> to

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
heavier recoil action and idle sway to

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.730 
heavier recoil action and idle sway to
the<00:02:47.090> guns<00:02:47.330> that<00:02:47.480> kind<00:02:47.690> of<00:02:47.720> made<00:02:47.930> it<00:02:48.080> a<00:02:48.520> more

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:50.740 
the guns that kind of made it a more

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:53.320 
the guns that kind of made it a more
it's<00:02:51.740> not<00:02:51.860> just<00:02:51.920> realism<00:02:52.490> it's<00:02:52.820> actually<00:02:53.210> like

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330 
it's not just realism it's actually like

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:54.670 
it's not just realism it's actually like
it's<00:02:53.480> more<00:02:53.660> of<00:02:53.750> a<00:02:53.810> balance<00:02:53.990> issue<00:02:54.290> because

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
it's more of a balance issue because

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.710 
it's more of a balance issue because
before<00:02:55.670> with<00:02:55.820> assault<00:02:56.120> rifles<00:02:56.150> you<00:02:56.600> could

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
before with assault rifles you could

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.340 
before with assault rifles you could
just<00:02:56.900> like<00:02:57.110> downrange<00:02:57.800> an<00:02:58.160> ACR<00:02:58.580> you<00:02:59.060> know

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
just like downrange an ACR you know

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:03.190 
just like downrange an ACR you know
perfectly<00:03:00.350> and<00:03:00.770> it<00:03:01.670> will<00:03:01.760> stay<00:03:01.880> laser<00:03:02.480> on<00:03:02.900> you

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
perfectly and it will stay laser on you

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.390 
perfectly and it will stay laser on you
know<00:03:03.320> one<00:03:03.890> freaking<00:03:04.640> inch<00:03:04.850> wide<00:03:05.810> of<00:03:06.110> a

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
know one freaking inch wide of a

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.660 
know one freaking inch wide of a
trajectory<00:03:07.959> but<00:03:08.959> I<00:03:09.350> think<00:03:10.100> they<00:03:10.190> did<00:03:10.340> a<00:03:10.370> very

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
trajectory but I think they did a very

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.540 
trajectory but I think they did a very
good<00:03:10.820> job<00:03:11.030> in<00:03:11.600> introducing<00:03:12.080> a<00:03:12.380> bit<00:03:12.560> better<00:03:12.739> gun

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:13.550 
good job in introducing a bit better gun

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:17.130 
good job in introducing a bit better gun
balance<00:03:14.530> with<00:03:15.530> the<00:03:15.560> exception<00:03:16.040> of<00:03:16.160> kimbos

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
balance with the exception of kimbos

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.640 
balance with the exception of kimbos
honestly<00:03:18.140> oh<00:03:19.090> very<00:03:20.090> good<00:03:20.989> job<00:03:21.320> on<00:03:21.470> them

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
honestly oh very good job on them

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.720 
honestly oh very good job on them
nerfing<00:03:22.130> new<00:03:22.310> tubes<00:03:23.680> now<00:03:24.680> regarding<00:03:24.860> maps<00:03:25.400> I

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
nerfing new tubes now regarding maps I

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.930 
nerfing new tubes now regarding maps I
do<00:03:26.000> think<00:03:26.950> most<00:03:27.950> of<00:03:28.100> them<00:03:28.250> are<00:03:28.400> a<00:03:28.430> bit<00:03:28.610> too

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
do think most of them are a bit too

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:33.580 
do think most of them are a bit too
congested<00:03:29.270> and<00:03:29.840> small<00:03:31.000> but<00:03:32.410> it's<00:03:33.410> a<00:03:33.560> thought

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
congested and small but it's a thought

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.320 
congested and small but it's a thought
on<00:03:33.860> the<00:03:34.070> internet<00:03:34.340> that<00:03:34.489> it's<00:03:34.970> a<00:03:35.030> conspiracy

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:35.330 
on the internet that it's a conspiracy

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:37.570 
on the internet that it's a conspiracy
that<00:03:35.810> they<00:03:35.959> made<00:03:36.140> all<00:03:36.290> these<00:03:36.410> like<00:03:36.739> smaller

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:37.580 
that they made all these like smaller

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:41.500 
that they made all these like smaller
kind<00:03:38.030> of<00:03:38.440> non-vertical<00:03:39.440> maps<00:03:40.270> crowded<00:03:41.270> maps

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
kind of non-vertical maps crowded maps

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.740 
kind of non-vertical maps crowded maps
so<00:03:41.780> that<00:03:41.930> they'll<00:03:42.110> be<00:03:42.500> able<00:03:43.130> to<00:03:43.459> sell<00:03:43.730> more<00:03:44.090> DLC

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
so that they'll be able to sell more DLC

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.979 
so that they'll be able to sell more DLC
maps<00:03:45.230> and<00:03:46.090> it<00:03:47.090> actually<00:03:47.330> looks<00:03:47.660> like<00:03:47.810> that

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:47.989 
maps and it actually looks like that

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:49.449 
maps and it actually looks like that
what<00:03:48.260> that<00:03:48.380> was<00:03:48.500> the<00:03:48.620> case<00:03:48.770> because<00:03:49.220> there's

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:49.459 
what that was the case because there's

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:52.050 
what that was the case because there's
very<00:03:49.850> little<00:03:50.090> variation<00:03:50.540> of<00:03:50.840> the<00:03:50.900> maps<00:03:51.140> in<00:03:51.950> the

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
very little variation of the maps in the

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.550 
very little variation of the maps in the
the<00:03:53.060> original<00:03:53.450> maps<00:03:53.630> the<00:03:53.840> vanilla<00:03:54.110> maps<00:03:54.380> that

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
the original maps the vanilla maps that

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.910 
the original maps the vanilla maps that
they<00:03:54.709> brought<00:03:55.100> out<00:03:55.130> with<00:03:55.489> the<00:03:56.420> release<00:03:56.660> here

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
they brought out with the release here

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.850 
they brought out with the release here
at<00:03:59.790> least<00:04:00.030> three<00:04:00.240> out<00:04:00.360> of<00:04:00.390> the<00:04:00.510> four<00:04:00.860> leaked

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 
at least three out of the four leaked

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:04.430 
at least three out of the four leaked
maps<00:04:02.190> that<00:04:02.400> I<00:04:02.459> saw<00:04:02.730> out<00:04:03.030> of<00:04:03.060> the<00:04:03.180> new<00:04:03.450> a<00:04:03.720> DLC

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
maps that I saw out of the new a DLC

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.260 
maps that I saw out of the new a DLC
that's<00:04:04.620> coming<00:04:04.830> out<00:04:04.920> the<00:04:05.040> first<00:04:05.250> one<00:04:05.489> actually

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:06.270 
that's coming out the first one actually

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:09.110 
that's coming out the first one actually
looks<00:04:06.770> like<00:04:07.770> just<00:04:08.340> the<00:04:08.430> screenshots<00:04:08.940> from

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
looks like just the screenshots from

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.600 
looks like just the screenshots from
each<00:04:09.300> one<00:04:09.330> make<00:04:10.230> it<00:04:10.410> seem<00:04:10.980> as<00:04:11.010> though<00:04:11.190> there

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:11.610 
each one make it seem as though there

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:18.560 
each one make it seem as though there
was<00:04:11.760> a<00:04:12.739> big<00:04:14.540> map<00:04:15.540> in<00:04:15.810> each<00:04:16.530> of<00:04:16.739> them<00:04:16.859> I<00:04:17.730> don't

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
was a big map in each of them I don't

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:19.610 
was a big map in each of them I don't
know<00:04:18.630> how<00:04:18.690> to<00:04:18.750> describe<00:04:18.870> it<00:04:19.200> but<00:04:19.350> they're

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
know how to describe it but they're

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.979
