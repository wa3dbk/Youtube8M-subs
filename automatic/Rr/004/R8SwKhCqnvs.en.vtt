00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:04.760
 a saint-Cecile music 

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:07.450
 the weekly compared to alain astruc 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:10.509
 the melody all this is already his share of blood 

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:13.509
 if it's not pompoms not yet 

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:17.240
 for us it is an adversary that the announced earlier is today 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.550
 or never say those happy happy side of smiling 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:21.980
 I grew up with rap 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.460
 since the youngest real age seducer today it's easier 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.660
 to make sure we can not do like everyone else for designers 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.190
 thank you all they are three for all his 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.150
 all of the youth district the bomb with a lyrica instinct the group that 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:40.690
 have formed it they decided to make the Somali rapper intergenerational 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.280
 in their neighborhood 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.550
 a rather daring bet he can still tell 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:47.340
 we lived 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.370
 humor understood 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.050
 what's going on around us 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:50.880
 that is why 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:51.609
 what everyone 

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:54.940
 number of young people our age older people 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.940
 and a little more young people 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.220
 we met in 2010 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:01.830
 I see that the changes 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:04.890
 Mom, you fought against the problems of children's Africa 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.480
 eat not made smile when everything went wrong for the staff and especially 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.380
 that with the skill of nothing 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.860
 that's it can give you tonight 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:13.689
 will not go 

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:18.069
 click from where my family is because it's partly artistic that his child is 

00:01:18.069 --> 00:01:21.650
 rather badly written although I heard that rap is not behind this 

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:24.649
 Facade facade that took duration accelerates 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:35.320
 after a first clip shot with the means of the edge 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.149
 install friendly record an album of 10 tracks 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:41.459
 and a second one clip that will also be shot in bombay with the good ones 

00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:44.920
 million 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.840
 anyone who divide themselves as under the gaze on society 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.120
 but again without a penny and without criticizing to criticize what is trying 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:53.490
 to bring something 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.090
 it was secretive the debate but in a positive and constructive way that 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.570
 be sustainable trucks group of young people in a screaming wood coffee maker 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.290
 which hinders people who are in the rhythm we are not in a farm 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.159
 is not in a year show people there are some people in the 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:08.269
 neighborhood and you have two young neighbors 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:12.069
 here they do things that can pass a message to listen to it from 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:13.409
 judge me 

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:16.270
 after a few sessions in the studio and the opening of a blog 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.990
 the group will sell his CV and will perform in some local festivals in the summer 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:24.180
 next unpretentious if not the withdrawal of the dialogue in a 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.530
 district
