 8th 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.790
 8th 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.790
 laughs 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:01.000
 We welcome from dvd with for 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.650
 me with a cold shower for you 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.080
 she starts with a few introductory words 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:10.750
 to the concept but it lacks the front lying 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:12.400
 make me hot coffee I know 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.140
 Of course, that's exactly what many of you do 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.479
 now out of curiosity first again 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.530
 the dvd he can have packed 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:19.540
 Do not blame me 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.490
 I am also curious what is new 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.290
 gives on the monthly fishing dvd 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:26.259
 Nevertheless, we would like to point this out 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:28.539
 that the dvd basically only as 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:29.979
 In addition to the booklet he is white 

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:33.160
 So please, please not all 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:35.170
 information on dvd and expected too 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:37.450
 one does not expect no pure 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.920
 professional work have experienced 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.240
 me if you have some wind noise too 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.550
 are hear and write the 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.410
 protest letters when you drop water 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:47.410
 the lens sticks that means of course 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:49.450
 not that my well-known mtv style the 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.710
 whole dvd will characterize I have partial 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.240
 also a pro in the boat 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.039
 Georg Baumann would be the one or 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.720
 be my page and other chapters 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:56.890
 really good shots make detail 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.509
 recordings do not make me that either 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.729
 to see synonymous in close-up 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:02.110
 dismantling etc 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.119
 but first and foremost i want to introduce you to this 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.830
 all things that cats wake up fever 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:07.660
 we want to take the water and that way 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.280
 make realistic as possible as 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:10.860
 many of you are subscribed to 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.209
 have already known that from me 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.130
 what is the target audience of this dvd 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:16.930
 Of course, a folder should be what you are 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.970
 We almost prepare a target fish group 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.190
 cards are always dealt with in this case 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.870
 Basics explain basic knowledge 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.510
 convey to beginners 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.069
 that does not mean that the freaks 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.140
 underneath you that this folder dvd 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:30.849
 have bought too short 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.709
 because I have some just that 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:35.080
 brought freaks into the boat I'm more 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:36.700
 known as europe and with this freaks 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.170
 I will also really special things 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.550
 They certainly do something to you 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.440
 and that's nice 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.390
 these right crazy these cards 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.430
 displace the participation of this dvd 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.989
 make no state secrets from 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.379
 your success recipes and I think so 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:49.770
 class 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:52.780
 a nice thank you at this point 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:54.760
 The last thing I want to say you can 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.950
 Coffee gives me the last word here 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.840
 want to say is there is a thing 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.510
 in the Carp scene, it's all mine 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.210
 stinks powerful and that's it 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.010
 English 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:06.650
 Anglicisms have us downright 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.300
 rolled over as you talk so so 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.550
 so to speak, I would pack in a tone of mine 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:12.740
 Now together and movie would be one 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:15.740
 new location visit that offered to the 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:17.030
 to catch caps yes I hate that 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.680
 I find that you are in ours 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.840
 language can express everything wonderfully 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:23.270
 that's why I'm on this dvd and 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.890
 Also in the special issue everything tries German 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:25.520
 express and if that is not possible 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.080
 is 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.090
 There are also certain names 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.500
 which are bad translatable then will 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.270
 I translate that both 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.700
 beginner can understand everything 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:36.590
 I do not even say profis as well 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.880
 Remember that one too 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.830
 everything in our German language 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.020
 wonderfully express what you can say 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:46.420
 I would like to say a lot in this sense 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:46.420
 have fun on dvd enjoy
