side start clean the average content - I

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.720 
side start clean the average content - I
guess<00:02:05.960> that<00:02:06.110> means<00:02:06.200> it's<00:02:06.350> like<00:02:06.440> two<00:02:07.160> shoes<00:02:07.520> in

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:07.730

and<00:04:22.349> then<00:04:22.560> I<00:04:22.919> don't<00:04:23.729> believe<00:04:23.939> that<00:04:23.970> meant

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
and then I don't believe that meant

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.809 
and then I don't believe that meant
midsize<00:04:25.259> any<00:04:25.530> stitching<00:04:25.979> but<00:04:26.129> if<00:04:26.219> it<00:04:26.340> would<00:04:26.550> it

00:04:26.809 --> 00:04:26.819 
midsize any stitching but if it would it

00:04:26.819 --> 00:04:34.760 
midsize any stitching but if it would it
probably<00:04:27.300> be<00:04:27.449> white<00:04:27.659> would<00:04:28.080> be<00:04:28.229> my<00:04:28.349> guess<00:04:33.770> no

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
probably be white would be my guess no

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:37.999 
probably be white would be my guess no
