00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 hey hello and welcome to infinity 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.940
 gameplay and so I'm felix and me 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.770
 I am five and we show you today how 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.719
 one also where conclusion series on the map 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.849
 raid goes the same way that we are here 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.160
 even before completion of series and bit so 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.890
 more precisely on how great today 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.529
 and yes we are played at the back at raid 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.480
 go left the waterway for a long time 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.769
 and that's pretty good at the beginning of the 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.539
 Opponents are not that fast and can 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:28.260
 right away beckham 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:30.150
 Now the next tip is right here 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.800
 high because most of the time an enemy comes here 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.450
 long and you can just fast 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.149
 It was easy to catch you knew you were 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.910
 just looking forward to that and 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.559
 You know that you 're here now next 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.870
 tip it was very tense and behind 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:46.079
 of course, right back in hollow points 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.820
 bring it to the on the on the 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.440
 lightning strike can go first now 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.210
 small tip I've got the shots 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.340
 one must not be too cool on the 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.260
 you have to be points and you have to 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.629
 be defensive and wait with it 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:01.590
 first half point and not 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:03.090
 we're going to die right now 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.140
 first on the lightning strike is also 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.780
 very easy 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.479
 da felix yes I think the lightning 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.159
 every one of you really is that 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.810
 yes, not such a high score around from 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.840
 lightning strike on the next graduation 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.659
 her from the orbital is not like that either 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.820
 hard as well as soon you will see 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:24.479
 see points in the bag because we think 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.790
 it is quiet to come but 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:30.049
 now two people around the corner and 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.979
 There you already have the orbital 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:33.810
 satellite as well as here 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.579
 that is the points difference 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.860
 between lightning and orbital 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.110
 not so high that she can not make it 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.700
 but it is relatively fast and 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.740
 that too important we have now 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.560
 of course the satellites taken so 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.700
 the orbital satellite because of you too 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.460
 still brings points if yours 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.130
 make teammates kids that way 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.420
 you also have an assistant right now 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.920
 right there 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.509
 yes and now we are just in front of how 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:02.060
 Great where I play and just the 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:05.520
 last cool doing here and is here 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.469
 this is definitely safe now 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.819
 that is secured 

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:10.709
 and now you can go to the 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.599
 go in the middle even if it's gone there 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.290
 you do not get worked up because 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:15.599
 it 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.689
 there will be a corner fight for now 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:21.810
 So what does kemptener corner and put 

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:24.239
 r with the vital now first what he 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.310
 plays exactly to the vito so only one 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.909
 relatively easy to use explains itself 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.200
 by itself 

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:30.060
 that means perhaps also for the 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.489
 beginner of you he becomes easy too 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.840
 But you have to say that you have to use them 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:36.329
 graduation years after that come 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.769
 Hundestaffel and black are clear 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:39.420
 easier to use 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:43.200
 you do not have to serve them that is 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:45.620
 thing yes she may be a beginner 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.090
 a bit too heavy 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.950
 I would like you to graduate 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.079
 series at first you simply advise 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.849
 the dog squad and the swan too 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:56.639
 use 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:59.099
 And yes, how should it be is she 

00:02:56.639 --> 00:03:02.030
 just activate and then you can 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:04.260
 you just wash extensions 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:07.709
 And most of all they help you 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:09.299
 also give you support exactly 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.590
 our class we we play 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:12.900
 has probably seen the 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.970
 ms mmc red dot silencer and 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.889
 laser pointer laser pointer easy 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.709
 That's why we look better and horny 

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:22.440
 But the hip can jump one 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:24.419
 stark situation for you yes I have the 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.030
 lightning wanted to use grad see 

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:28.859
 you still and erich change with ypsilon 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.750
 on the knife and I would have him loose 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:32.069
 that can always be done away with 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.720
 see again because I already upset 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:36.810
 pretty much because that's the whole thing 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:41.180
 conclusion series so everything destroyed 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:43.739
 and yes , well, we'll continue to play 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:46.169
 ghost hardliner raiders and 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:47.879
 fluency fluency also because 16 

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:50.159
 because we just saw it in the beginning 

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:52.650
 we were much faster at the point 

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:54.359
 must be opponents and opponents 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.329
 meet and that the most important as 

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:59.549
 to be first in order to be in 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:02.030
 to enter this danger zone and the 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:04.139
 as possible to be the first opponent 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:05.280
 Unfortunately that's why you have it 

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:07.379
 Faster on this high degree 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.229
 year old comes and plunderer hand and 

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:13.169
 also pretty much saved on the ass 

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:16.859
 because yes her childlike situation is her 

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:18.870
 have two more balls and got 50 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:21.690
 points to the conclusion series 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:25.229
 it just helps to plunder exactly 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:26.680
 then to our because of you we see 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:28.180
 Do not actually go that often 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:31.120
 the middle and for the following reason 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:34.240
 that is the danger too high in 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:36.430
 the middle one disturbs you mostly and 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.710
 so just come over the outside 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:41.350
 mostly just flank her 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:43.419
 make the points even if the way 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:44.919
 free you can go in and yes 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:48.400
 collect the brands 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:50.020
 and so that is already and also 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.330
 to our conclusion series the yes 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:54.070
 Of course, these are pretty important 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.990
 we are on our way to being vital 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:58.389
 lightning and the orbital and mine 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:00.460
 then stop in vitra simply look 

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:03.120
 because everybody actually wants him 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:06.460
 create you once in the game and the 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:08.199
 point difference around original so the way 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:10.780
 does not take long then to orbital too 

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:12.250
 Going on the orbital is natural 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:14.800
 a cool conclusion series is the 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:17.949
 opponent you have a little bit more 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:20.590
 motivation because you see the opponents stop 

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:22.599
 and you also know where you are and yours 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:24.370
 You can also get some finances 

00:05:22.599 --> 00:05:26.680
 This is what characterizes this satellite bonus 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:28.030
 as I said right now I fell 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.259
 I already have one now 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:31.810
 lightning strike now four minutes few 

00:05:29.259 --> 00:05:34.389
 points for the capital now again 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:36.220
 just unfold the lightning stroke and 

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:37.570
 yes you have to work with the map too 

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:39.659
 is just droning up and around 

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:42.370
 means because it was already possible to see here 

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:44.590
 is therefore expected to go in to the 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:45.909
 corner and I have the orbital now rather 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:50.289
 to lightning the power actually 

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:53.590
 you can also have two kids as well 

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:54.190
 These companies are hessen rocket 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:56.560
 exactly 

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:59.470
 yes and there is already the second like 

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:00.729
 Great I hope you have the video 

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:03.789
 I hope you have one 

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:07.560
 get a little better insight and 

00:06:03.789 --> 00:06:07.560
 So we are out clean 

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:46.050
 conclusion sa
