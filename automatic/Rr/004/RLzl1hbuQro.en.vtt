00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
race and and i'm pretty happy with my

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.340 
race and and i'm pretty happy with my
race<00:01:06.720> but<00:01:07.880> even<00:01:08.880> though<00:01:09.000> i<00:01:09.030> made<00:01:09.330> a<00:01:09.360> made<00:01:10.140> of<00:01:10.320> a

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
race but even though i made a made of a

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.910 
race but even though i made a made of a
forced<00:01:10.770> place<00:01:11.070> and<00:01:11.520> I<00:01:12.000> was<00:01:12.659> not<00:01:12.869> in<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.680> front

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
forced place and I was not in the front

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.710 
forced place and I was not in the front
from<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.280> beginning<00:01:14.700> of<00:01:14.790> and<00:01:15.180> I<00:01:15.330> think<00:01:15.540> that

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
from the beginning of and I think that

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.200 
from the beginning of and I think that
has<00:01:15.900> also<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.290> do<00:01:16.560> with<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.950> Cape<00:01:17.729> Epic<00:01:17.880> that

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
has also to do with the Cape Epic that

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.530 
has also to do with the Cape Epic that
you're<00:01:18.390> not<00:01:18.540> used<00:01:18.840> to<00:01:18.990> to<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.619> stance<00:01:19.920> that

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540 
you're not used to to the stance that

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.120 
you're not used to to the stance that
it's<00:01:21.540> maybe<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:21.990> little<00:01:22.049> bit<00:01:22.350> too<00:01:22.500> fast<00:01:22.799> for<00:01:23.009> me

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
it's maybe a little bit too fast for me

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.609 
it's maybe a little bit too fast for me
at<00:01:23.310> least<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.670> first<00:01:23.820> one<00:01:24.119> was<00:01:24.530> here<00:01:25.530> in

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.530 
at least the first one was here in
Norfolk<00:01:26.009> you<00:01:26.250> already<00:01:26.460> had<00:01:26.670> some<00:01:26.909> practice<00:01:27.090> on

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
Norfolk you already had some practice on

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.960 
Norfolk you already had some practice on
the<00:01:27.659> course<00:01:28.189> what<00:01:29.189> do<00:01:29.250> you<00:01:29.310> think<00:01:29.400> about<00:01:29.640> this

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
the course what do you think about this

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.560 
the course what do you think about this
course<00:01:30.829> it's<00:01:31.829> different<00:01:32.189> now<00:01:32.640> than<00:01:32.820> then<00:01:33.390> who

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
course it's different now than then who

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.850 
course it's different now than then who
feliz<00:01:33.960> course<00:01:34.799> it's<00:01:35.329> more<00:01:36.329> nervous<00:01:36.860> technical

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
feliz course it's more nervous technical

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.330 
feliz course it's more nervous technical
more<00:01:38.400> intensive<00:01:39.000> and<00:01:39.299> but<00:01:39.990> it<00:01:40.079> will<00:01:40.229> be<00:01:40.340> maybe

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
more intensive and but it will be maybe

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.010 
more intensive and but it will be maybe
even<00:01:41.640> more<00:01:41.850> interesting<00:01:42.119> for<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.630> spectators

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
even more interesting for the spectators

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.960 
even more interesting for the spectators
than<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.860> new<00:01:43.979> feliz<00:01:44.340> i<00:01:44.520> don't<00:01:44.700> know<00:01:44.759> where

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
influence on your way through yeah for

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.859 
influence on your way through yeah for
me<00:01:59.430> should<00:01:59.490> be<00:01:59.670> better<00:01:59.939> if<00:02:00.149> it's<00:02:00.329> drying<00:02:00.630> up

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
me should be better if it's drying up

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.100 
me should be better if it's drying up
because<00:02:01.430> I'm<00:02:02.430> not<00:02:02.759> such<00:02:03.060> what<00:02:03.630> is<00:02:03.750> it<00:02:03.899> much

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
because I'm not such what is it much

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.920 
because I'm not such what is it much
rider<00:02:04.409> like<00:02:05.070> for<00:02:05.520> example<00:02:05.610> like<00:02:06.090> philly<00:02:06.479> part

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
rider like for example like philly part

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.109 
rider like for example like philly part
or<00:02:07.380> hermida<00:02:08.190> they're<00:02:08.520> really<00:02:08.759> good<00:02:08.910> in<00:02:09.030> the

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
or hermida they're really good in the

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.229 
or hermida they're really good in the
math<00:02:09.300> and<00:02:10.220> yeah<00:02:11.220> for<00:02:11.520> me<00:02:11.610> should<00:02:11.670> be<00:02:11.849> better<00:02:12.120> if

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
math and yeah for me should be better if

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.440 
math and yeah for me should be better if
it<00:02:12.450> dries<00:02:12.690> up<00:02:12.870> but<00:02:13.050> it's
