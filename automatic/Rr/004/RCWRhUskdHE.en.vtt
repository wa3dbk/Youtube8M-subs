00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
fair bit of history

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.419 
fair bit of history
my<00:00:11.940> original<00:00:12.120> Cosmo<00:00:12.599> was<00:00:12.840> that<00:00:13.139> was<00:00:13.860> a<00:00:13.889> 2-liter

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
my original Cosmo was that was a 2-liter

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.180 
my original Cosmo was that was a 2-liter
piston<00:00:14.880> motor<00:00:15.230> my<00:00:16.230> initial<00:00:16.560> decision<00:00:16.920> was<00:00:17.070> to

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
piston motor my initial decision was to

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:18.769 
piston motor my initial decision was to
pull<00:00:17.369> that<00:00:17.460> motor<00:00:17.699> out<00:00:17.820> and<00:00:17.850> put<00:00:18.029> a<00:00:18.060> 12-8<00:00:18.449> turbo

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
pull that motor out and put a 12-8 turbo

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.779 
pull that motor out and put a 12-8 turbo
and<00:00:18.900> they<00:00:19.260> got<00:00:19.439> stolen<00:00:19.740> and<00:00:20.070> trashed<00:00:20.340> and<00:00:20.550> and

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
and they got stolen and trashed and and

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.429 
and they got stolen and trashed and and
a<00:00:21.300> year<00:00:21.449> later<00:00:21.480> I<00:00:21.750> decided<00:00:22.109> to<00:00:22.199> do<00:00:22.289> it<00:00:22.380> all

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
a year later I decided to do it all

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:22.730 
a year later I decided to do it all
again

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
again

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.029 
again
so<00:00:23.130> I<00:00:23.189> found<00:00:23.430> a<00:00:23.519> genuine<00:00:24.060> 12a<00:00:24.960> turbo<00:00:25.439> model<00:00:25.800> for

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
so I found a genuine 12a turbo model for

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.070 
so I found a genuine 12a turbo model for
roughly<00:00:26.400> 9,000<00:00:27.029> his<00:00:27.180> own<00:00:27.300> dollars<00:00:27.660> back<00:00:27.840> then

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
roughly 9,000 his own dollars back then

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.240 
roughly 9,000 his own dollars back then
and<00:00:28.260> 93<00:00:30.230> it's<00:00:31.230> a<00:00:31.289> nice<00:00:31.439> movie<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:31.890> motor<00:00:32.070> and

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
and 93 it's a nice movie the motor and

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.010 
and 93 it's a nice movie the motor and
that's<00:00:32.399> what<00:00:32.550> I<00:00:32.579> wanted<00:00:32.910> but<00:00:33.120> I<00:00:33.510> got<00:00:33.809> sick<00:00:33.989> of

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
that's what I wanted but I got sick of

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.660 
that's what I wanted but I got sick of
the<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.620> power<00:00:34.829> after<00:00:35.040> a<00:00:35.160> while<00:00:35.309> I<00:00:35.340> wanted

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
the the power after a while I wanted

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.319 
the the power after a while I wanted
more<00:00:35.880> I<00:00:36.920> could<00:00:37.920> have<00:00:38.040> worked<00:00:38.190> a<00:00:38.340> 13<00:00:38.670> Beall<00:00:38.879> or

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
more I could have worked a 13 Beall or

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:40.760 
more I could have worked a 13 Beall or
something<00:00:39.840> like<00:00:39.930> that<00:00:39.989> but<00:00:40.260> I<00:00:40.290> wanted

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
something like that but I wanted

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.229 
something like that but I wanted
something<00:00:41.010> different<00:00:41.100> I<00:00:41.489> wanted<00:00:42.090> something

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
something different I wanted something

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:48.610 
something different I wanted something
that<00:00:42.329> was<00:00:42.480> stood<00:00:42.719> out<00:00:42.840> from<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.680> norm<00:00:44.280> I

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.970 

always<00:00:49.620> liked<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:50.149> 91<00:00:51.149> model<00:00:51.570> Cosmo<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.739> JC

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
always liked the 91 model Cosmo the JC

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.580 
always liked the 91 model Cosmo the JC
Cosmo<00:00:53.550> and<00:00:53.780> I<00:00:54.780> just<00:00:55.020> couldn't<00:00:55.170> believe<00:00:55.289> it's

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
Cosmo and I just couldn't believe it's

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.290 
Cosmo and I just couldn't believe it's
20<00:00:55.890> B<00:00:55.980> powerplant<00:00:56.550> and<00:00:56.699> really<00:00:56.879> liked<00:00:57.030> that

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
20 B powerplant and really liked that

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.330 
20 B powerplant and really liked that
and<00:00:57.469> so<00:00:58.469> I<00:00:58.500> decided<00:00:58.620> that<00:00:58.980> would<00:00:59.160> be<00:00:59.250> the

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
and so I decided that would be the

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.160 
and so I decided that would be the
ultimate<00:00:59.430> to<00:00:59.730> stick<00:00:59.940> in<00:01:00.059> and<00:01:00.270> so<00:01:00.449> we<00:01:00.600> tracked

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
ultimate to stick in and so we tracked

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.599 
ultimate to stick in and so we tracked
one<00:01:01.350> down<00:01:01.379> and<00:01:01.710> found<00:01:02.010> someone<00:01:02.399> that<00:01:02.430> would

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
one down and found someone that would

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.609 
one down and found someone that would
actually<00:01:02.640> attempt<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:04.170> conversion

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
actually attempt the the conversion

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:10.300 
actually attempt the the conversion
because<00:01:04.769> it's<00:01:04.860> never<00:01:04.979> been<00:01:05.070> done<00:01:05.189> in<00:01:05.460> his<00:01:05.610> own

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.370 

between<00:01:10.790> a<00:01:10.850> twin<00:01:11.180> eBay<00:01:11.450> and<00:01:11.690> the<00:01:11.780> smaller<00:01:12.080> to

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
between a twin eBay and the smaller to

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:13.690 
between a twin eBay and the smaller to
Ryder<00:01:12.619> engine<00:01:13.010> is<00:01:13.130> quite<00:01:13.280> straightforward

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
Ryder engine is quite straightforward

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.730 
Ryder engine is quite straightforward
basically<00:01:14.690> it's<00:01:14.840> got<00:01:14.960> another<00:01:15.140> rotor<00:01:15.440> added

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
basically it's got another rotor added

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.830 
basically it's got another rotor added
on<00:01:15.799> the<00:01:15.890> end<00:01:16.040> of<00:01:16.100> it<00:01:16.190> what<00:01:17.150> we've<00:01:17.299> done<00:01:17.450> is<00:01:17.600> we

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
on the end of it what we've done is we

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.840 
on the end of it what we've done is we
have<00:01:18.560> taken<00:01:18.740> the<00:01:18.890> twin<00:01:19.130> turbos<00:01:19.490> off<00:01:19.640> there

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
have taken the twin turbos off there

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.690 
have taken the twin turbos off there
because<00:01:19.970> we<00:01:20.180> had<00:01:20.270> problems<00:01:20.390> with<00:01:20.690> the<00:01:21.700> twin

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
because we had problems with the twin

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.130 
because we had problems with the twin
towers<00:01:23.000> not<00:01:23.150> operating<00:01:23.600> properly<00:01:23.630> with<00:01:24.020> the

wasn't<00:01:32.060> always<00:01:32.180> the<00:01:32.360> case

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
wasn't always the case

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.200 
wasn't always the case
we've<00:01:33.830> had<00:01:34.040> some<00:01:34.310> overheating<00:01:34.880> problems

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
we've had some overheating problems

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:36.880 
we've had some overheating problems
along<00:01:35.420> the<00:01:35.570> way<00:01:35.690> of<00:01:35.720> the<00:01:35.960> build<00:01:36.200> so<00:01:36.500> we've<00:01:36.740> had

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
along the way of the build so we've had

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.389 
along the way of the build so we've had
to<00:01:37.100> incorporate<00:01:38.090> an<00:01:39.080> all-call<00:01:39.649> each<00:01:40.040> side<00:01:40.280> of

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.359 
then the need for additional fuel
injection<00:01:54.200> was<00:01:54.320> solved<00:01:54.710> by<00:01:54.860> simply<00:01:55.220> adding

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369 
injection was solved by simply adding

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:57.910 
injection was solved by simply adding
six<00:01:55.819> more<00:01:56.030> injectors<00:01:56.539> the<00:01:57.229> factory<00:01:57.770> motor

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
six more injectors the factory motor

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.100 
six more injectors the factory motor
does<00:01:58.100> come<00:01:58.310> with<00:01:58.399> six<00:01:58.610> injectors<00:01:59.030> standard<00:01:59.450> we

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
does come with six injectors standard we

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:01.990 
does come with six injectors standard we
knew<00:02:00.289> that<00:02:00.470> taking<00:02:01.100> the<00:02:01.159> twin<00:02:01.369> turbos<00:02:01.729> often

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
knew that taking the twin turbos often

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.880 
knew that taking the twin turbos often
putting<00:02:02.179> a<00:02:02.300> bigger<00:02:02.569> higher<00:02:03.140> flowing<00:02:03.560> turbo

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
putting a bigger higher flowing turbo

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.260 
putting a bigger higher flowing turbo
one<00:02:04.039> it's<00:02:04.190> gonna<00:02:04.310> be<00:02:04.399> a<00:02:04.490> lot<00:02:04.640> more<00:02:04.850> air<00:02:05.030> going

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
one it's gonna be a lot more air going

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:06.850 
one it's gonna be a lot more air going
through<00:02:05.569> it<00:02:05.690> to<00:02:05.780> the<00:02:05.869> motor<00:02:06.020> and<00:02:06.259> to

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
through it to the motor and to

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.430 
through it to the motor and to
compensate<00:02:07.369> for<00:02:08.239> that<00:02:08.300> we<00:02:09.050> just<00:02:09.170> like<00:02:09.350> to

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
compensate for that we just like to

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.259 
compensate for that we just like to
plumb<00:02:09.619> these<00:02:09.800> extra<00:02:10.069> injectors<00:02:10.429> and<00:02:10.459> one<00:02:11.150> or

00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:11.269 
plumb these extra injectors and one or

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:12.640 
plumb these extra injectors and one or
two<00:02:11.300> probably<00:02:11.870> would<00:02:11.989> have<00:02:12.080> done<00:02:12.260> the<00:02:12.319> trick

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
two probably would have done the trick

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.850 
two probably would have done the trick
but<00:02:13.570> anticipating<00:02:14.570> a<00:02:14.630> lot<00:02:14.840> more<00:02:14.989> boost<00:02:15.290> in<00:02:15.530> the

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
but anticipating a lot more boost in the

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.680 
but anticipating a lot more boost in the
future<00:02:16.250> we<00:02:16.640> wanted<00:02:16.880> to<00:02:17.000> make<00:02:17.269> sure<00:02:17.299> we<00:02:17.570> had

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
future we wanted to make sure we had

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:18.830 
future we wanted to make sure we had
enough<00:02:17.720> fuel<00:02:18.049> to<00:02:18.079> cover

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
enough fuel to cover

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
I really like the wheels here they're a

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.940 
I really like the wheels here they're a
change<00:03:04.980> to<00:03:05.190> what<00:03:05.310> I<00:03:05.340> had<00:03:05.520> before<00:03:06.920> they're<00:03:07.920> a

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
change to what I had before they're a

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.830 
change to what I had before they're a
bit<00:03:08.100> small<00:03:08.400> for<00:03:08.430> my<00:03:08.730> liking<00:03:08.970> I<00:03:09.210> want<00:03:09.570> to<00:03:09.660> check
