00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:18.300
 the retail web is open and then people from 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.880
 Quiet team here is the cricket and bringing 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.580
 them for you how to do ultimate 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.529
 fighting staff step by step 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.630
 If you still do not have it with the staff at 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.730
 Malt fire, I'll leave it in the description. 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.070
 for you also a step by step one 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.230
 previous video of how to get this one 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.070
 cold and after you have this 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.800
 staff 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.680
 You're going to go back to the 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.450
 play believer if you're going to keep this 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.239
 where he hid and in that corner where 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:48.570
 There's fire on the floor and you're going to kill 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.370
 zombies until complete and the four boxes 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.460
 This box is showing fire. 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.770
 behind me and when the glass side and 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.800
 it will complete with fire as if they are 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.699
 seeing and I have now completed three 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.050
 little boxes 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.510
 so from the moment you go 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.090
 killing a zombie there 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.830
 he collects the souls of zombies and 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.930
 fill the boxes with fire 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.390
 then this is the first step. 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.180
 for you to acquire ultimate fighting 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:18.030
 staff, we'll finish each 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.860
 Drive there to church, okay on the 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.720
 church will have these codes I'm 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.960
 leaving the code and at the moment in the 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.210
 screen for you to target better 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.450
 and these codes there means that there 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.229
 below you will have to set fire to the 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.310
 torches 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:38.280
 So for me it's 935 if I do not 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.530
 I'm wrong but not in that order and then the 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.659
 blog means enter 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.689
 So let's go out showing you in the 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:48.360
 actually the first there for me was the fifth 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:51.979
 I'll shoot you once, okay? 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:57.600
 then it's going to be 9 and in that field 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:59.880
 shooting 9 and last there in the corner the 3 and 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.430
 then for you to complete you have to 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.680
 draw and in that torch that has blood there 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.290
 up then where you're on fire 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.420
 You'll get the code there and go 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.349
 guide me by the code I left there 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.750
 for you 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.440
 now that you complete this tour 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.380
 we 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.870
 go back to part of the pec 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.940
 bridge that has one of the arches ok you go 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.880
 have to align all the arcs with the 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.490
 same as doing at the moment as the 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:29.400
 my stf is on fire I'll have to win 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:32.400
 all red colors 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.490
 Okay, so getting red konko 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.900
 You'll get down and give it a shot. 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:39.960
 exactly on that 12-ball on the ball 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:42.630
 to complete this step. 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:45.150
 and of the acts you have completed this step and 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.980
 You'll see that you're going to do these acts. 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.710
 identifying you then 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.630
 that the place is really right now 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:53.160
 we will go to the final step 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.520
 the final step you'll go 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:59.360
 again go there for public and play if 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:01.740
 where we started the 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:04.380
 ultimate fighting staff nÃ© 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:06.510
 so now you will put your make 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:09.210

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.950
 That little pebble and now we're going to kill. 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:13.800
 all the zombies there 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:16.500
 in this place to collect the souls 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:18.959
 again speaking you can make a 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.209
 one and one statue at a time 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:23.280
