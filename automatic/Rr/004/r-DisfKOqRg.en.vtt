 All of this is done simultaneously and comfortably from an integrated web site. 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.000
 So let's take a look and see how Frotcom works. 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.500
 A device located calculates the location of the vehicle from GPS satellite signals. 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
 The device then sends this information to the receiver 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 Who then passes it to the Frotcom Data Center. 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.000
 And then information is uploaded to the information holder. 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.500
 From there, it is sent to the user. 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.000
 Who can have easy access to information through their computers or SmartPhone's. 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.500
 It's really simple. 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.500
 As an example of how Frotcom can help you, let's take a look at our yellow truck. 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.500
 Without Frotcom, in no way can we know where it is and what way it is pursuing, 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.500
 And we can not predict whether it will arrive on time at its destination. 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:10.000
 If we take our blue Frotcom truck, we have access to this information quickly and easily, using the footage from Frotcom 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:16.500
 Ensuring that his path is the most efficient possible, and that it be implemented according to the plan. 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.500
 Unfortunately, sometimes delays are inevitable 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 But at least with Frotcom fleet management can alarm for delays 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
 And then pass the information to the customer. 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.500
 For any unauthorized interference, Frotcom is able to notify the fleet manager, 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.500
 For example, there is an unauthorized access to the rear door of the vehicle 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 If stolen you can find it right away 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:56.000
