too<00:00:31.109> but<00:00:31.410> i<00:00:31.439> think<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.740> bow<00:00:31.920> might<00:00:32.219> be<00:00:32.369> a

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
too but i think the bow might be a

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:33.770 
too but i think the bow might be a
little<00:00:32.579> bit<00:00:32.820> better<00:00:32.940> i'm<00:00:33.210> not<00:00:33.329> too<00:00:33.480> sure<00:00:33.510> it's

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
little bit better i'm not too sure it's

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.479 
little bit better i'm not too sure it's
personal<00:00:34.110> preference<00:00:34.320> but<00:00:34.530> i<00:00:34.860> switch<00:00:35.250> over<00:00:35.460> to

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
personal preference but i switch over to

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:36.560 
personal preference but i switch over to
the<00:00:35.610> bow<00:00:35.700> i<00:00:35.730> think<00:00:36.000> it's<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.120> best<00:00:36.239> gun<00:00:36.450> in<00:00:36.480> the

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
the bow i think it's the best gun in the

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.170 
the bow i think it's the best gun in the
game<00:00:36.690> so<00:00:36.899> what<00:00:37.079> i<00:00:37.260> have<00:00:37.290> been<00:00:37.620> running<00:00:37.770> all<00:00:38.180> my

Blass<00:01:15.299> oppressor<00:01:15.750> I<00:01:15.780> think<00:01:16.020> all<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.320> all<00:01:16.680> the

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
Blass oppressor I think all the all the

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.679 
Blass oppressor I think all the all the
good<00:01:17.159> perks<00:01:17.369> are<00:01:17.520> in<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.670> perk<00:01:17.970> 3<00:01:18.240> slot<00:01:18.479> this

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
good perks are in the perk 3 slot this

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.840 
good perks are in the perk 3 slot this
year<00:01:18.960> so<00:01:19.470> I'd<00:01:19.590> recommend<00:01:19.799> running<00:01:20.220> toughness

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
year so I'd recommend running toughness

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.780 
year so I'd recommend running toughness
with<00:01:21.000> blast<00:01:21.210> suppress<00:01:21.780> a<00:01:21.810> blast<00:01:22.350> suppressor

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
with blast suppress a blast suppressor

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:24.859 
with blast suppress a blast suppressor
and<00:01:23.790> then<00:01:23.970> if<00:01:24.150> you<00:01:24.240> think<00:01:24.450> you're<00:01:24.570> a<00:01:24.600> good<00:01:24.750> nut

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869

00:02:50.589 --> 00:02:50.599 
bombing run in the warbird you could

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:52.390 
bombing run in the warbird you could
probably<00:02:50.780> switch<00:02:51.019> out<00:02:51.170> the<00:02:51.260> warbird<00:02:51.680> for<00:02:52.130> the

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
probably switch out the warbird for the

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.210 
probably switch out the warbird for the
what<00:02:53.000> is<00:02:53.090> it<00:02:53.209> called<00:02:53.420> the<00:02:53.890> system<00:02:54.890> hack<00:02:55.069> the

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
what is it called the system hack the

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.009 
what is it called the system hack the
system<00:02:55.400> hack<00:02:55.640> is<00:02:55.760> really<00:02:55.970> good<00:02:56.150> but<00:02:56.750> so<00:02:56.959> I'm

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:57.019 
system hack is really good but so I'm

00:02:57.019 --> 00:02:59.410 
system hack is really good but so I'm
overall<00:02:57.410> I'm<00:02:57.620> digging<00:02:58.280> these<00:02:58.370> three<00:02:58.640> streaks

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
overall I'm digging these three streaks

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:00.640 
overall I'm digging these three streaks
the<00:02:59.599> bombing<00:02:59.900> run<00:03:00.019> is<00:03:00.140> probably<00:03:00.380> the<00:03:00.470> best

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
the bombing run is probably the best

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.259 
the bombing run is probably the best
kill<00:03:00.890> streak<00:03:00.920> in<00:03:01.220> the<00:03:01.310> game<00:03:01.489> it<00:03:02.030> kills

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:02.269 
kill streak in the game it kills

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:04.180 
kill streak in the game it kills
everything<00:03:02.599> if<00:03:02.989> it's<00:03:03.230> outside<00:03:03.380> it<00:03:03.980> really

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
everything if it's outside it really

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:05.530 
everything if it's outside it really
does<00:03:04.340> this<00:03:04.519> really<00:03:04.730> good<00:03:04.940> streak<00:03:05.090> it's<00:03:05.390> like<00:03:05.510> a

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
does this really good streak it's like a

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.390 
does this really good streak it's like a
stealth<00:03:05.840> bomber<00:03:05.900> it<00:03:06.470> really<00:03:06.650> is<00:03:06.829> it's<00:03:07.129> really

setups<00:04:03.410> I<00:04:03.530> could<00:04:03.950> probably<00:04:04.130> do<00:04:04.280> it<00:04:04.310> in<00:04:04.430> a

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:04.459 
setups I could probably do it in a

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:05.860 
setups I could probably do it in a
custom<00:04:04.760> match<00:04:04.880> but<00:04:05.120> it's<00:04:05.239> so<00:04:05.450> late<00:04:05.690> in<00:04:05.840> the

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870
