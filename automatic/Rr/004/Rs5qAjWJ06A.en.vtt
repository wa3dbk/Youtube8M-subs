help replenish our glycogen stores with
energy<00:00:51.559> and<00:00:51.769> we<00:00:52.460> want<00:00:52.670> to<00:00:52.729> match<00:00:52.879> these

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:53.089 
energy and we want to match these

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:56.229 
energy and we want to match these
carbohydrate<00:00:53.960> foods<00:00:54.260> with<00:00:54.710> protein<00:00:55.429> foods<00:00:55.789> to

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239 
carbohydrate foods with protein foods to

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:00.729 
carbohydrate foods with protein foods to
help<00:00:56.449> with<00:00:56.899> muscle<00:00:57.559> repair<00:00:58.010> and<00:00:58.519> synthesis<00:00:59.739> so

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:00.739 
help with muscle repair and synthesis so

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:02.979 
help with muscle repair and synthesis so
now<00:01:01.309> casal<00:01:01.670> do<00:01:01.819> you<00:01:01.909> know<00:01:01.999> any<00:01:02.179> carbohydrate

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989 
now casal do you know any carbohydrate

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:04.780 
now casal do you know any carbohydrate

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.040 
carbohydrate foods are starchy foods or

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.650 
carbohydrate foods are starchy foods or
sweet<00:01:10.400> foods<00:01:11.470> so<00:01:12.470> they're<00:01:13.280> carbohydrates<00:01:14.270> you

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:14.660 
sweet foods so they're carbohydrates you

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.080 
sweet foods so they're carbohydrates you
know<00:01:14.780> protein<00:01:15.290> food<00:01:15.620> groups<00:01:16.010> our<00:01:16.580> protein

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
know protein food groups our protein

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.180 
know protein food groups our protein
foods<00:01:17.420> are<00:01:17.630> generally<00:01:18.200> our<00:01:18.470> animal<00:01:18.890> foods

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:19.190 
foods are generally our animal foods

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.140 
foods are generally our animal foods
like<00:01:19.970> how<00:01:20.240> meets<00:01:20.720> our<00:01:21.280> chicken<00:01:22.280> our<00:01:22.430> fish<00:01:22.820> and

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150 
like how meets our chicken our fish and

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.030 
like how meets our chicken our fish and
then<00:01:23.360> we've<00:01:23.570> got<00:01:23.600> dairy<00:01:24.080> food<00:01:24.410> as<00:01:24.560> well<00:01:24.710> which

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
then we've got dairy food as well which

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.220 
then we've got dairy food as well which
is<00:01:25.070> when<00:01:25.370> people<00:01:25.610> often<00:01:26.090> forget<00:01:26.300> about<00:01:26.600> if

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:27.230 
is when people often forget about if

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:29.740 
is when people often forget about if
we're<00:01:27.470> talking<00:01:27.620> about<00:01:27.950> protein<00:01:28.580> what<00:01:29.090> so<00:01:29.510> for

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
we're talking about protein what so for

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.750 
we're talking about protein what so for
optimal<00:01:30.170> sporting<00:01:30.590> performance<00:01:30.770> we<00:01:31.490> want<00:01:31.670> to

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:31.760 
optimal sporting performance we want to

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.910 
optimal sporting performance we want to
match<00:01:31.910> those<00:01:32.210> starts<00:01:32.750> your<00:01:32.990> sweet<00:01:33.260> foods<00:01:33.560> with

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
match those starts your sweet foods with

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.580 
match those starts your sweet foods with
the<00:01:34.040> protein<00:01:34.520> food<00:01:34.820> so<00:01:35.570> most<00:01:35.840> athletes<00:01:36.350> don't

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
the protein food so most athletes don't

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.530 
the protein food so most athletes don't
feel<00:01:36.860> like<00:01:37.040> eating<00:01:37.220> a<00:01:37.430> big<00:01:37.640> meal<00:01:37.910> straight

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540 
feel like eating a big meal straight

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.040 
feel like eating a big meal straight
after<00:01:38.750> or<00:01:39.260> before<00:01:39.880> their<00:01:40.880> sporting<00:01:41.330> event<00:01:41.690> so

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.050 
after or before their sporting event so

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:43.510 
after or before their sporting event so
it's<00:01:42.080> generally<00:01:42.680> good<00:01:42.860> to<00:01:43.010> have<00:01:43.160> a<00:01:43.190> small

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
it's generally good to have a small

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.880 
it's generally good to have a small

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
snack so snacks that include both

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.000 
snack so snacks that include both
carbohydrates<00:01:46.730> and<00:01:46.940> protein<00:01:47.540> would<00:01:48.320> be<00:01:48.620> a

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:49.010 
carbohydrates and protein would be a

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.360 
carbohydrates and protein would be a
small<00:01:49.640> handful<00:01:50.120> of<00:01:50.180> nuts<00:01:50.510> and<00:01:50.930> maybe<00:01:51.409> a<00:01:51.590> tetra

milk pack something like up and go is a
good<00:01:55.100> one<00:01:55.250> or<00:01:55.940> sausage<00:01:56.330> in<00:01:56.480> the<00:01:56.540> sport<00:01:56.900> because

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
good one or sausage in the sport because

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.890 
good one or sausage in the sport because
that's<00:01:57.350> got<00:01:57.560> the<00:01:57.770> protein<00:01:58.220> in<00:01:58.370> it<00:01:58.460> otherwise<00:01:59.390> a

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 
sandwich so sandwiches eat carbohydrates

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.330 
sandwich so sandwiches eat carbohydrates
and<00:02:03.350> you<00:02:03.860> put<00:02:04.100> some<00:02:04.310> protein<00:02:04.790> in<00:02:04.820> it<00:02:04.940> like
