00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:01.310 
and halls and things like that um don't
think<00:05:00.120> that<00:05:00.300> it's<00:05:00.419> because<00:05:00.750> of<00:05:00.780> the<00:05:01.020> view

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.860 
think that it's because of the view
situation<00:05:02.070> or<00:05:02.280> subscribers<00:05:03.060> it's<00:05:03.330> just
