00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:07.919
 opel and its owner 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.870
 us general motors corporation 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.860
 had high hopes for the Russian 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.840
 car market 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.199
 who until recently promised 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.490
 become the largest in europe in 2013 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.220
 Russia for the German automotive 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.380
 the company was the third largest market 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.769
 sales after great britain and germany 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.900
 however, in 2014 opel had problems 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.730
 with sales in September the company went 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.610
 production cuts and layoffs 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.149

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:37.739
 2015 for opel in Russia became fatal 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:39.870
 we concluded that the prospects 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.030
 Russian market is not very good 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.670
 not only in the short run we are in the middle and 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.379
 long term we had to take 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:51.780
 drastic measures in Russia 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:53.460
 to protect your business reasons 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.710

 drop in demand this February 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.980
 the company was able to implement throughout 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.539
 Russia, only 912 cars and this is 86 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.540
 percent less compared to February 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.700
 last year also the problem is caused 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.740
 depreciation of the ruble and the fact that 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.240
 more than half of all opera parts 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.600

 closely watching the Russian market 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.450

 times of april or two she api like 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.470
 other automakers 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.840
 incurring heavy losses in Russia and therefore 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.670
 In Russia, the project closed the idea of ​​general 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.220
 motors was in order to 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.920
 opel take a more confident position on 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.680
 the market is now impossible to do 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.810

 cars now many understand this 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.270
 impossible as a result the company will 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.729
 try to sell these cars on 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.950
 other european markets but a real replacement 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.479

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.240
 falling demand in russia is experiencing 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.680
 almost all manufacturers

 only opel will leave the Russian market end 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.849

 St. Petersburg and terminate contracts 

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:38.349
 with local partners as a result of working 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:40.519
 places to lose more than a thousand people 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:41.900
 however, bought not the first time
