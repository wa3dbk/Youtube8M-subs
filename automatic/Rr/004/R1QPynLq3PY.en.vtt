00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:58.450
 a section of effects such as recordings 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:02:00.430
 legislation and the big deal is that 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.440
 all the trouble I can work with 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.240
 public process in order 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.700
 We'll talk a little about each one. 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.310
 beginning with the part of 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:12.610
 voice is exposed the great guarantor 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:17.350
 he puts as it is done in six patterns 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:18.790
 different voices two groups in order and

 the subclan clans overdrive or ovary 2 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.600
 today I have a pre- programmed here that 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.630
 It's the brait club I like a lot. 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:34.709
 the calm of an example for you of 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.709
 from timbu 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:58.420
 i interesting about the situation 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:01.750
 of the valves that when we work 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:04.380
 on the channel itself and changes the gain 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:08.850
 works with a form even though 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.850
 even after the yard 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:17.040
 if I raise wool and start giving

 a saturation 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:45.110

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.560
 second option of the plan that would be the man 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.540
