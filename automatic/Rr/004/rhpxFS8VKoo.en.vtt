they they disconnected we were just
tying<00:02:57.510> the<00:02:58.160> yellow<00:02:59.160> wire<00:02:59.400> on<00:02:59.700> to<00:03:00.120> you<00:03:00.420> can

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
tying the yellow wire on to you can

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.170 
tying the yellow wire on to you can
actually<00:03:00.690> still<00:03:01.110> see<00:03:01.410> the<00:03:01.890> copper<00:03:02.519> piece

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
actually still see the copper piece

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.670 
actually still see the copper piece
that's<00:03:03.510> on<00:03:03.660> there<00:03:03.810> we<00:03:04.230> were<00:03:04.350> just<00:03:04.500> running

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
because of course they did something

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:47.240 
because of course they did something
silly<00:03:45.000> with<00:03:45.239> the<00:03:45.390> wiring<00:03:45.870> and<00:03:46.019> can't<00:03:46.980> figure

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
silly with the wiring and can't figure

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.280 
silly with the wiring and can't figure
out<00:03:47.340> how<00:03:47.700> they<00:03:47.910> did<00:03:48.150> it<00:03:48.299> and<00:03:48.329> where<00:03:48.630> the<00:03:48.810> ran<00:03:49.019> to

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
out how they did it and where the ran to

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.810 
out how they did it and where the ran to
and<00:03:50.180> found<00:03:51.180> one<00:03:51.480> wire<00:03:51.720> that<00:03:51.930> it<00:03:52.049> was<00:03:52.140> just<00:03:52.410> like

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:52.820 
and found one wire that it was just like

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:55.640 
and found one wire that it was just like
electrical<00:03:53.820> taped<00:03:54.090> to<00:03:54.450> another<00:03:54.750> one<00:03:54.989> inside

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
electrical taped to another one inside

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.940 
electrical taped to another one inside
the<00:03:55.799> wall<00:03:55.980> just<00:03:56.670> in<00:03:57.269> there<00:03:57.570> that's<00:03:58.290> a<00:03:58.350> bad<00:03:58.530> idea

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
the wall just in there that's a bad idea

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.729 
the wall just in there that's a bad idea
like<00:03:59.790> of<00:04:00.540> all<00:04:00.780> the<00:04:00.840> things<00:04:01.019> that<00:04:01.440> can<00:04:01.560> cause<00:04:01.680> a

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
like of all the things that can cause a

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:04.550 
like of all the things that can cause a
fire<00:04:01.970> that's<00:04:02.970> one<00:04:03.300> of<00:04:03.450> them<00:04:03.629> so<00:04:03.900> I'm<00:04:04.019> pretty

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
fire that's one of them so I'm pretty

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:05.880 
fire that's one of them so I'm pretty
darn<00:04:04.769> glad<00:04:05.069> that<00:04:05.280> we<00:04:05.370> replace

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:05.890 
darn glad that we replace

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:09.220 
darn glad that we replace
every<00:04:06.890> single<00:04:07.220> wire<00:04:07.400> in<00:04:07.640> the<00:04:07.730> house<00:04:08.140> there's<00:04:09.140> a

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
every single wire in the house there's a

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.110 
every single wire in the house there's a
couple<00:04:09.440> of<00:04:09.680> lights<00:04:09.950> that<00:04:10.129> I'm<00:04:10.340> still<00:04:10.640> not<00:04:10.819> sure

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
couple of lights that I'm still not sure

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.809 
couple of lights that I'm still not sure
how<00:04:12.110> I'm<00:04:12.260> gonna<00:04:12.440> do<00:04:12.830> yet<00:04:13.129> as<00:04:13.310> far<00:04:13.519> as<00:04:13.640> getting

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
the wires over to the lights we're gonna
