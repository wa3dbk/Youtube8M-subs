00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:09.060
 But did you say here Yes influence there it is in Ueda City, Nagano Prefecture, local 10th Court 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:14.070
 I gave a lesson 

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:15.550
 So what did you say to me who came today is what my husband has been doing recently 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.730
 But 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:25.240
 It is not possible to say that hitting road effect is possible 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:25.779
 I did my best to improve tennis by changing my inner reaction. 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.840
 Ne 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:31.590
 There is a great success today 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:36.060
 Well that's the way too 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:38.030
 I think that you have felt the possibility of the snare by yourself, but it's still great. 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:44.539
 Yo 10 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:47.059
 Of course it's important to hit outside and it's interesting , but by changing your own way of hitting 

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:50.199
 It is great when I change tennis 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:50.199
 I wonder how smoothly 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:58.150
 You either become that way is referred to as a pull out their abilities or rather so as to move 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.630
 It is easy 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:05.040
 When the city ​​flag of how to beat is overkilled 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:05.040
 I hope I'll have 4 levels again 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.280
 I don't really know where it comes to rally, games and so on. 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.770
 In the situation 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:18.240
 Move freely 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:23.700
 In the body feels that say it remains to the ball home 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:29.610
 There is a case that can not be done Of course it depends on the person 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:35.060
 Well , one of the things I thought was really interesting today 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:35.060
 After all human beings are dragged by that past memory 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:47.130
 It responds to the situation, so let's just say something like a 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:51.000
 If you were good at forehand and not good at backhand 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:54.040
 I feel that the forehand is just hitting the ball . 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.690
 However, the moment I was able to backhand 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:02:02.210
 I say ya 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:05.000
 Well the body comes from the heart is the ne heart of the reaction of sell say body 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:09.590
 From there I get nervous 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:12.910
 Of course the behavior is going to be weird, so of course I 'm explaining this very simply 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:15.000
 That kind of reaction is 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:18.990
 You 're out in various ways 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:24.810
 Of course I myself will come out and it is natural for the general public though 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:29.319
 Looking at the reaction may not have been possible in the past memories, but I can really 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:31.500
 First of all, let me experience that you can really 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:32.390
 Get close to the production 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.810
 so 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:41.540
 Is it an image like rewriting memory? 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:46.319
 For me it's not difficult anymore, so have me understand that 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:50.700
 Understanding and supporting play by 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:53.569
 I had a great effect I did, but now this method is amazing 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:57.709
 I feel the possibility 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:03:00.889
 Well, I think it will be going in this direction as well in the future 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:02.170
 First of all, because it was interesting to do with the method of the child 

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:05.490
 a 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.490
 I tried to take a little video
