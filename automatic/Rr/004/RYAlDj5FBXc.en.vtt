00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
bombing like the graffiti guys used to

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.170 
bombing like the graffiti guys used to
do<00:00:19.800> back<00:00:20.160> in<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:20.310> day<00:00:20.369> or<00:00:20.580> still<00:00:20.820> do<00:00:21.000> I<00:00:21.029> guess

on train cars or whatever this is
non-destructive<00:00:23.730> though<00:00:24.150> we're<00:00:24.300> doing<00:00:24.480> it

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
non-destructive though we're doing it

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.970 
non-destructive though we're doing it
with<00:00:24.660> lighting<00:00:25.050> why<00:00:25.740> just<00:00:26.369> to<00:00:26.490> do<00:00:26.640> it<00:00:27.980> okay

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
with lighting why just to do it okay

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.650 
with lighting why just to do it okay
here's<00:00:29.220> our<00:00:29.369> subject<00:00:29.910> it's<00:00:30.210> this<00:00:30.390> building

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
here's our subject it's this building

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:31.669 
here's our subject it's this building
right<00:00:30.750> here<00:00:30.810> it's<00:00:31.080> already<00:00:31.289> lit<00:00:31.439> up<00:00:31.529> but<00:00:31.650> I

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
right here it's already lit up but I

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:32.870 
right here it's already lit up but I
think<00:00:31.859> we're<00:00:31.980> gonna<00:00:32.070> be<00:00:32.250> able<00:00:32.279> to<00:00:32.430> enhance<00:00:32.669> it

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
think we're gonna be able to enhance it

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.720 
think we're gonna be able to enhance it

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:36.439 
we're going to do a tree for extra

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:50.270 
we're going to do a tree for extra
credit

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.219 

so<00:01:51.280> that<00:01:51.850> was<00:01:52.120> our<00:01:52.270> light<00:01:52.540> bottom<00:01:52.840> for<00:01:52.990> tonight

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:53.229 
so that was our light bottom for tonight

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:54.690 
so that was our light bottom for tonight
we<00:01:53.260> need<00:01:53.440> to<00:01:53.590> treat<00:01:53.830> and<00:01:54.070> a<00:01:54.190> building<00:01:54.520> what<00:01:54.640> do

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
we need to treat and a building what do

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.340 
we need to treat and a building what do
you<00:01:54.820> think<00:01:55.090> there's<00:01:55.659> a<00:01:55.750> reason<00:01:56.050> I'm<00:01:56.140> showing

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
you think there's a reason I'm showing

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.170 
you think there's a reason I'm showing
you<00:01:56.500> this<00:01:56.680> is<00:01:56.920> because<00:01:57.310> maybe<00:01:57.640> in<00:01:57.790> a<00:01:57.880> few<00:01:58.030> days

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.180 
you this is because maybe in a few days

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:59.430 
you this is because maybe in a few days
there<00:01:58.330> may<00:01:58.510> or<00:01:58.600> may<00:01:58.690> not<00:01:58.720> be<00:01:58.930> a<00:01:58.960> contest

00:01:59.430 --> 00:01:59.440 
there may or may not be a contest

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.770 
there may or may not be a contest
popping<00:01:59.830> up<00:01:59.950> from<00:02:00.070> a<00:02:00.220> DJ<00:02:00.550> involving<00:02:01.330> these

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
popping up from a DJ involving these

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.680 
popping up from a DJ involving these
techniques<00:02:02.310> now<00:02:03.310> we<00:02:03.369> use<00:02:03.910> a<00:02:03.940> couple<00:02:04.510> of

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:04.690 
techniques now we use a couple of

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:08.669 
techniques now we use a couple of
products<00:02:05.380> we<00:02:06.040> use<00:02:06.070> these<00:02:06.430> all<00:02:07.390> to<00:02:07.660> go<00:02:07.840> par<00:02:08.170> 7

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 
products we use these all to go par 7

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:10.440 
products we use these all to go par 7
x's<00:02:08.950> from<00:02:09.100> a<00:02:09.160> DJ<00:02:09.429> their<00:02:09.580> battery<00:02:09.940> powers<00:02:10.330> that

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
x's from a DJ their battery powers that

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.570 
x's from a DJ their battery powers that
were<00:02:10.539> perfect<00:02:10.810> for<00:02:10.990> the<00:02:11.170> job<00:02:11.340> but<00:02:12.340> if<00:02:12.400> we<00:02:12.490> did

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
were perfect for the job but if we did

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.100 
were perfect for the job but if we did
not<00:02:12.730> have<00:02:12.790> battery<00:02:13.270> powered<00:02:13.570> lights<00:02:13.780> and<00:02:14.020> one

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
not have battery powered lights and one

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.560 
not have battery powered lights and one
of<00:02:14.200> our<00:02:14.290> lifes<00:02:14.440> was<00:02:14.650> not<00:02:14.830> battery<00:02:15.160> powered<00:02:15.570> we

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
of our lifes was not battery powered we

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.050 
of our lifes was not battery powered we
use<00:02:16.780> this<00:02:17.290> diehard<00:02:17.800> power<00:02:18.490> inverter<00:02:18.820> it's

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
use this diehard power inverter it's

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.820 
use this diehard power inverter it's
actually<00:02:19.300> a<00:02:19.330> jump<00:02:19.630> box<00:02:19.810> look<00:02:20.500> at<00:02:20.590> the<00:02:20.650> back

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
actually a jump box look at the back

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.350 
actually a jump box look at the back
you'll<00:02:21.100> see<00:02:21.130> it<00:02:21.280> has<00:02:21.310> cables<00:02:21.820> to<00:02:21.880> jumpstart<00:02:22.300> a

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
you'll see it has cables to jumpstart a

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.750 
you'll see it has cables to jumpstart a
car<00:02:22.560> it<00:02:23.560> does<00:02:23.770> a<00:02:23.800> lot<00:02:23.980> of<00:02:24.040> things<00:02:24.370> it's<00:02:24.520> a<00:02:24.580> real

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
car it does a lot of things it's a real

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.300 
car it does a lot of things it's a real
handy<00:02:25.000> tool<00:02:25.209> it's<00:02:25.810> an<00:02:26.080> LED<00:02:26.620> light<00:02:26.650> like<00:02:27.190> you

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
handy tool it's an LED light like you

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:28.380 
handy tool it's an LED light like you
need<00:02:27.430> task<00:02:27.700> light<00:02:28.000> when<00:02:28.150> you're<00:02:28.270> working

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
need task light when you're working

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.380 
need task light when you're working
outside<00:02:28.870> or<00:02:29.050> in<00:02:29.110> a<00:02:29.170> dark<00:02:29.410> area<00:02:29.620> it<00:02:29.980> is<00:02:30.520> an<00:02:30.730> air

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
outside or in a dark area it is an air

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.229 
outside or in a dark area it is an air
compressor<00:02:32.370> it's<00:02:33.370> also<00:02:33.610> a<00:02:33.760> power<00:02:34.000> converter

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
compressor it's also a power converter

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:36.720 
compressor it's also a power converter
so<00:02:35.170> our<00:02:35.350> power<00:02:35.620> inverter<00:02:36.040> rather<00:02:36.310> so<00:02:36.580> it's

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
so our power inverter rather so it's

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.670 
so our power inverter rather so it's
real<00:02:36.940> cool<00:02:37.150> if<00:02:37.330> you<00:02:37.450> want<00:02:37.600> to<00:02:37.690> power<00:02:37.810> some<00:02:38.140> low

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
real cool if you want to power some low

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.190 
real cool if you want to power some low
powered<00:02:39.010> anything<00:02:39.520> especially<00:02:39.730> lights<00:02:40.540> like

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
powered anything especially lights like

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.170 
powered anything especially lights like
the<00:02:41.920> icon<00:02:43.440> LED<00:02:44.440> gobo<00:02:45.070> projector<00:02:45.400> that<00:02:45.700> we<00:02:46.000> use

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
the icon LED gobo projector that we use

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.390 
the icon LED gobo projector that we use
to<00:02:46.300> put<00:02:46.450> the<00:02:46.540> adj<00:02:47.050> tag<00:02:47.410> on<00:02:47.709> the<00:02:48.070> building

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
to put the adj tag on the building
