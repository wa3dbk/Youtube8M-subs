so<00:00:03.360> what<00:00:03.510> we<00:00:03.629> have<00:00:03.810> behind<00:00:04.080> me<00:00:04.230> is<00:00:04.620> the<00:00:05.069> orchard

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
so what we have behind me is the orchard

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.550 
so what we have behind me is the orchard
project<00:00:06.180> this<00:00:06.480> is<00:00:06.660> a<00:00:06.690> prototype<00:00:07.109> a

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
project this is a prototype a

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.320 
project this is a prototype a
proof-of-concept<00:00:07.890> for<00:00:08.580> what<00:00:08.730> we<00:00:08.849> hope<00:00:09.030> to<00:00:09.179> be

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
proof-of-concept for what we hope to be

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.830 
proof-of-concept for what we hope to be
20<00:00:10.139> to<00:00:10.260> 30<00:00:10.530> trees<00:00:11.040> in<00:00:11.309> the<00:00:11.400> future<00:00:11.790> this<00:00:12.630> is<00:00:12.690> a

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
20 to 30 trees in the future this is a

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.570 
20 to 30 trees in the future this is a
partnership<00:00:13.230> between<00:00:13.500> genzler<00:00:14.429> and

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
partnership between genzler and

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.550 
partnership between genzler and
architecture<00:00:15.089> firm<00:00:15.330> and<00:00:15.630> chaotic<00:00:16.109> moon<00:00:16.350> to

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
architecture firm and chaotic moon to

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.310 
architecture firm and chaotic moon to
create<00:00:16.800> a<00:00:16.830> technology<00:00:17.070> studio<00:00:17.900> the<00:00:18.900> project

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
create a technology studio the project

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.670 
create a technology studio the project
was<00:00:19.439> really<00:00:19.830> a<00:00:20.420> project<00:00:21.420> for<00:00:21.840> the<00:00:22.050> city<00:00:22.230> kind

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
was really a project for the city kind

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.939 
was really a project for the city kind
of<00:00:22.800> in<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.130> city<00:00:23.340> and<00:00:24.050> with<00:00:25.050> partners<00:00:25.590> in<00:00:25.859> the

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
of in the city and with partners in the

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.250 
of in the city and with partners in the
city<00:00:26.189> so<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:27.000> prototype<00:00:27.300> tree<00:00:27.779> is<00:00:27.930> just<00:00:27.960> a

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
city so the prototype tree is just a

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.560 
city so the prototype tree is just a
single<00:00:28.560> tree<00:00:28.830> right<00:00:29.070> now<00:00:29.279> it's<00:00:30.029> it's<00:00:30.390> a

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
single tree right now it's it's a

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.470 
single tree right now it's it's a
pneumatic<00:00:31.410> structure<00:00:31.980> it's<00:00:32.250> it's<00:00:33.000> run<00:00:33.270> up<00:00:33.390> a

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
pneumatic structure it's it's run up a

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.420 
pneumatic structure it's it's run up a
small<00:00:33.780> electric<00:00:34.110> engine<00:00:34.469> it's<00:00:34.649> held<00:00:34.890> up<00:00:35.190> by

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
small electric engine it's held up by

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.060 
small electric engine it's held up by
about<00:00:35.640> 4<00:00:35.969> psi<00:00:36.450> inside<00:00:37.260> of<00:00:37.440> that<00:00:37.530> we<00:00:37.739> have<00:00:37.920> an

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
about 4 psi inside of that we have an

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.430 
about 4 psi inside of that we have an
aluminum<00:00:38.340> mast<00:00:38.850> that<00:00:39.480> holds<00:00:39.899> a<00:00:40.050> number<00:00:40.290> of

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
aluminum mast that holds a number of

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.940 
aluminum mast that holds a number of
sensors<00:00:41.030> lights<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:42.420> speakers<00:00:43.050> that<00:00:43.320> allows

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
sensors lights and speakers that allows

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.069 
sensors lights and speakers that allows
us<00:00:44.219> to<00:00:44.370> become<00:00:44.489> an<00:00:44.730> interactive<00:00:45.420> with<00:00:45.719> touch

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
us to become an interactive with touch

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.410 
us to become an interactive with touch
so<00:00:46.739> as<00:00:46.860> people<00:00:47.010> touch<00:00:47.399> it<00:00:47.610> it<00:00:47.730> it<00:00:47.879> interacts

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
so as people touch it it it interacts

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.970 
so as people touch it it it interacts
and<00:00:48.840> in<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.079> future<00:00:49.410> when<00:00:49.559> we<00:00:49.590> have<00:00:49.710> multiple

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
and in the future when we have multiple

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.770 
and in the future when we have multiple
trees<00:00:50.520> they'll<00:00:50.789> interact<00:00:51.149> with<00:00:51.420> each<00:00:51.539> other

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
trees they'll interact with each other

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.860 
trees they'll interact with each other
interact<00:00:52.260> with<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.530> public<00:00:53.000> and<00:00:54.000> it<00:00:54.510> possibly

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
interact with the public and it possibly

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.360 
interact with the public and it possibly
interact<00:00:55.230> with<00:00:55.410> other<00:00:55.559> things<00:00:55.770> like<00:00:55.920> social

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
interact with other things like social

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.459 
interact with other things like social
media<00:00:56.699> you<00:00:57.180> can<00:00:57.390> brush<00:00:57.629> it<00:00:57.660> you<00:00:58.020> can<00:00:58.199> hug<00:00:58.440> it

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
media you can brush it you can hug it

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.080 
media you can brush it you can hug it
you<00:00:58.770> can<00:00:58.920> touch<00:00:59.100> it

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
you can touch it

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.029 
you can touch it
we've<00:01:00.660> had<00:01:00.930> people<00:01:01.140> try<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:01.440> tackle<00:01:01.770> it<00:01:01.949> we

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
we've had people try to tackle it we

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.609 
we've had people try to tackle it we
don't<00:01:02.160> suggest<00:01:02.430> that<00:01:02.899> we<00:01:03.899> would<00:01:04.140> rather<00:01:04.320> that

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
don't suggest that we would rather that

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.330 
don't suggest that we would rather that
not<00:01:04.830> happen<00:01:05.390> but<00:01:06.390> yeah<00:01:07.200> it's<00:01:07.439> it's<00:01:07.619> just<00:01:08.130> fully

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
not happen but yeah it's it's just fully

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.039 
not happen but yeah it's it's just fully
interactive<00:01:09.000> it's<00:01:09.180> very<00:01:09.390> soft<00:01:09.720> and

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
interactive it's very soft and

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.440 
interactive it's very soft and
squeezable<00:01:10.740> this<00:01:11.100> is<00:01:11.280> kind<00:01:11.729> of<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.000> first

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
squeezable this is kind of the the first

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.000 
squeezable this is kind of the the first
public<00:01:12.869> unveiling<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.439> first<00:01:13.619> time<00:01:13.799> we've

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
public unveiling the first time we've

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.190 
public unveiling the first time we've
shown<00:01:14.280> it<00:01:14.400> to<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.610> public<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.180> from<00:01:15.720> from

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
shown it to the public and from from

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.050 
shown it to the public and from from
there<00:01:16.470> we're<00:01:16.799> gonna<00:01:16.890> kind<00:01:17.250> of<00:01:17.340> reach<00:01:17.520> out<00:01:17.790> to

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
there we're gonna kind of reach out to

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.219 
there we're gonna kind of reach out to
do<00:01:18.570> possible<00:01:19.170> partners<00:01:20.150> to<00:01:21.150> move<00:01:21.840> it<00:01:21.990> forward

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
do possible partners to move it forward

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.200 
do possible partners to move it forward
into<00:01:22.680> to<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.040> orchard<00:01:23.220> project<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:24.000> meaning

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
into to the orchard project and meaning

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.609 
into to the orchard project and meaning
the<00:01:24.299> name<00:01:24.450> of<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.689> project<00:01:24.840> is<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.259> orchard

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
the name of the project is the orchard

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.370 
the name of the project is the orchard
so<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.250> intention<00:01:26.759> is<00:01:26.880> always<00:01:27.170> to<00:01:28.170> build

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
so the the intention is always to build

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.190 
so the the intention is always to build
many<00:01:28.770> of<00:01:28.950> these<00:01:29.040> trees<00:01:29.490> this<00:01:30.060> is<00:01:30.119> this<00:01:30.780> is<00:01:30.990> the

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
many of these trees this is this is the

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.859 
many of these trees this is this is the
dev<00:01:31.530> one<00:01:31.829> hit<00:01:32.460> and<00:01:32.670> we'll<00:01:33.090> move<00:01:33.240> on<00:01:33.420> from<00:01:33.659> there

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
dev one hit and we'll move on from there

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.870 
dev one hit and we'll move on from there
I<00:01:34.079> think<00:01:34.259> we<00:01:34.500> put<00:01:34.680> it<00:01:34.770> up<00:01:34.860> today<00:01:34.979> in<00:01:35.369> probably

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
I think we put it up today in probably

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.810 
I think we put it up today in probably
about<00:01:36.479> 45<00:01:36.869> minutes<00:01:37.380> I<00:01:37.500> think

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
about 45 minutes I think

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.690 
about 45 minutes I think
headed<00:01:38.090> up<00:01:38.180> today<00:01:38.540> to<00:01:39.409> get<00:01:39.530> it<00:01:39.680> synced<00:01:40.400> in<00:01:40.490> with

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
headed up today to get it synced in with

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.250 
headed up today to get it synced in with
some<00:01:40.940> of<00:01:41.030> the<00:01:41.090> more<00:01:41.240> interactive<00:01:41.600> components

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:42.260 
some of the more interactive components

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.200 
some of the more interactive components
took<00:01:42.409> a<00:01:42.500> little<00:01:42.680> bit<00:01:42.890> longer<00:01:43.159> but<00:01:43.520> we've

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
took a little bit longer but we've

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:45.790 
took a little bit longer but we've
gotten<00:01:44.570> it<00:01:44.659> a<00:01:44.690> little<00:01:44.870> bit<00:01:44.990> faster<00:01:45.140> every<00:01:45.590> time

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:45.800 
gotten it a little bit faster every time

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.240 
gotten it a little bit faster every time
we<00:01:45.979> put<00:01:46.220> it<00:01:46.340> up<00:01:46.750> so<00:01:47.750> the<00:01:47.870> ideas<00:01:48.260> and<00:01:48.740> Gobekli

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
we put it up so the ideas and Gobekli
