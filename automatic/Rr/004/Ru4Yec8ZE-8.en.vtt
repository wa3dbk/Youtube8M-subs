 hi to all your kids in there 

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:17.369
 this new video we will see the unboxing 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:19.680
 dell'aca 80 and a liquid heat sink 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.020
 of the race the sink a tribute 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.939
 of the race that I thank you find the 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.890
 link to the website and the facebook page of a 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.090
 description I recommend you go to 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.380
 put like it 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.850
 we get caught shortly with unboxing 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.949
 well guys here we are with the box 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.269
 containing sink all around 

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:39.390
 as always we have various images 

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:41.190
 information on the left side we have 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.440
 in various languages ​​various specifications 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.699
 techniques in the back we have 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.739
 a table that shows us the 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:48.659
 temperatures and noise compared to 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.790
 a stock cooler down here i 

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:52.710
 compatible sockets and here we have others 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.479
 information while on the front 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.970
 we can see the image of the 

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:58.500
 heatsink and the corser logo a link 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:01.019
 software that allows us to monitor 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.909
 the fans the heat sink is the color 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:03.570
 of the corsair logo directly from 

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:07.430
 desktop 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.430
 let's move on to boxing now 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.049
 inside we find these two 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.539
 leaflets with information guarantees and the 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.700
 instruction booklet 

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:24.600
 we set aside under the cover 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.219
 we finally have access to 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.310
 heatsink that we put aside 

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:31.859
 we will see shortly and within the 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.170
 box we find the cable brackets and wind 

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:37.409
 mounting screws we see everything in the 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:41.670
 detail we have two corser fans sp 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:43.200
 120 l 220 mm with connector pin 4 then 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.659
 the fan speed will vary 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.439
 based on the temperature of the GPU 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:48.350
 the eventual will be mounted in 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.490
 push-pull configuration on the radiator 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.590
 inside the box we find a 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.659
 usb cable that will be connected to a process 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.060
 usb on the motherboard and on the side of the 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.100
 waterblock that we will see soon we have 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.929
 then the ay power cord for le 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.119
 fans with 4-pin terminations 

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:05.219
 it will also be connected to the water block 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.679
 inside the box we also find 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:09.840
 an adjustable intel socket backplate 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:12.000
 to adjust it just move the four 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.400
 hooks to adapt it to the various sockets 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.410
 remember that socket 2011 does not need 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.870
 of this backplate there are then the 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.420
 magnetic bracket for intel socket 11 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:25.610
 50 11 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:29.750
 5 11 56 13 66 2011 and the magnetic cloth 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:33.140
 for socket amd am2 am2 plus am3 am3 plus 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:35.420
 fm1 aid fm2 while here we have various 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.880
 screws and bolts for fixing we 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.650
 four double pd for socket 2011 e 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.350
 four other double screws for the others 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:45.020
 socket intel two hooks for the socket and 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:47.390
 the four bolts for fixing eight 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.130
 screws for the fans and 4 shims from 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.750
 apply was real crisis to avoid 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.459
 scratch it before moving on to 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.730
 sink I would like to applaud the 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:56.390
 Inside the box partition is really 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.400
 very resistant to avoid any 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.380
 type of damage to the content 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.780
 and here we are finally with the sink 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:06.260
 let's see some specific dimensions 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:09.650
 of the radiator height 152 mm width 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:12.799
 120 depth 38 material of the 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.970
 aluminum radiator weighs one kilo and 200 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:15.590
 grams approx 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.690
 furthermore in the front part e 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.819
 back there are four holes 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:22.250
 for mounting the two-pipe fans 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:24.200
 by 283 mm in length and lowers 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.970
 evaporation connect the radiator to the 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.010
 water block for the passage of liquid 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.450
 refrigerant water block like 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.489
 we can see has a surface of 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.859
 contact the copper with thermal paste will have 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:35.959
 applied and we can see the eight screws 

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:37.760
 which close the perfect waterblock for 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:39.380
 avoid any kind of spillage 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.480
 on the left side we have a 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:43.130
 USB connector to be connected to a process 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.840
 on the motherboard with the cable that 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:47.510
 we have seen before to make it work 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.850
 the corser link software and for those who had 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.980
 the link commander control unit instead of the 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:54.079
 usb connector can use this other 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.150
 connector the control unit can be 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:57.769
 purchased on the corser site in the 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.780
 upper part we have a cable 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:01.670
 split to y with an esata connector 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.620
 to feed the water block and a 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.540
 4 pin connector to control the 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.670
 fans will go on the board 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.590
 mother just above we have instead 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:12.440
 these two connectors to connect two 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:14.630
 y-cables to power the fans thing 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:17.209
 we can say about this heat sink with 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:19.850
 one to 52 thousand and 500 chief having blocked a 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:22.039
 4.5 gigahertz temperatures fluctuated 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:23.539
 between 57 and 60 degrees 

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:25.160
 remember however that the temperatures 

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:28.789
 they also vary depending on the temperature 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:30.349
 environmental keys order cables etc 

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:30.800
 therefore each result must be evaluated 

00:04:30.349 --> 00:04:31.909
 taking 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.770
 I also consider these factors 

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:35.449
 especially in this summer period 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.009
 where it starts to get very hot 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:39.349
 so I would say that based on these 

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:41.509
 really good dissipation factors 

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:43.250
 obviously there are negative sides to 

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:45.319
 example could have included a 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:47.150
 second y- cable to connect others 

00:04:45.319 --> 00:04:49.370
 two fans since the toilet block 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:50.629
 as we have seen it supports them and why 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.770
 not even a little thermal paste 

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:53.150
 additional 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:55.190
 another small flaw if so 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:57.530
 we can call it is the lack of 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:59.330
 disk for diskless software link 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:00.979
 in fact we will be forced to download it 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:03.169
 from the official site well guys 

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:05.030
 the unboxing of the course is 80 i 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:07.340
 ends here I want to thank 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:08.629

 I like the heat sink 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:16.250
 found online at a price is around 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:18.289
 85 euros
