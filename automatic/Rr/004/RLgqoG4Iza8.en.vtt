00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:16.859
 well let's find out if we have this 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.910
 problem as where we are good then 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.610
 we have to go in our playstation 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.860
 4 the settings menu 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:25.470
 we are going to just sound and 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.390
 screens area adjustment 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.490
 display 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.910
 and just in the corner we have to 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.739
 have if we are perfectly 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:37.110
 solved this problem all the 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.550
 little corner that is here is just 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.650
 in the corner and now if we give to 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.040
 enlarge 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:47.010
 it does not go any further if we reduce it but the 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.890
 maximum limit of the area is this we do not go 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.930
 so it keeps increasing then we will suffer 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.940
 this problem another way to detect 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.900
 this problem would be within one's own 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.400
 web browser of the play we are going to in 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.470
 Google 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:05.400
 let's google search here google thermo 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:06.270
 as you can see here is totally the 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.540
 bar 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.070
 If I had your problem then the 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.530
 bar is squadron wind no 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:17.060
 there was going to record google history 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.060
 knows half to five 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.940
 we propose the big zoom 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:28.330
 and as you can see above there is the bar 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:30.190
 and if not, if not if it were if we had 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.920
 this problem because the bar would not exist 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.300
 would be this is square is good 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.880
 to solve this is very easy 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.770
 we have to take our command of 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.170
 our TV and the first thing we have 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.660
 to know if the configuration is the 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:46.180
 correct 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:48.760
 1920 x 1080 yes we have configuration 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:51.070
 and the play is also going well then 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:53.370
 to solve this problem we have 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:57.850
 to go then to our TV menu 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:02:00.430
 in image the image mode in leisure worth 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:03.040
 and we have to go not also to the party 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:06.010
 more here below in leisure games worth 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:08.649
 depends this screen already brings by 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:11.340
 game mode defect built into 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:14.069
 screen settings 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.870
 size of the image 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:18.120
 and here you can see that we have 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.159
 variations but both of them the mode 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.170
 game is already selected on this TV 

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:25.200
 I already included it look at it the loe look at them 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:28.049
 instructions then if not back by 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.090
 default the bet as it will appear is that 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:32.459
 an option that will be a mode mode partner 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:35.969
 game video game whatever it is worth 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:39.260
 so if nothing appears, it is that 

00:02:35.969 --> 00:02:44.269
 you have perfectly configured that yes 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:47.280
 when putting in image mode in leisure mode 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:50.430
 Well, everything would be solved in 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.530

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.209
