the bottom of the chassis so here are
the<00:01:33.159> steering<00:01:33.490> bellcranks<00:01:33.640> I'm<00:01:34.300> gonna<00:01:34.450> flip

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
the steering bellcranks I'm gonna flip

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.249 
the steering bellcranks I'm gonna flip
them<00:01:34.899> upside<00:01:35.289> down<00:01:35.319> and<00:01:36.039> slide<00:01:36.789> them<00:01:37.259> onto

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:38.259 
them upside down and slide them onto

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:42.749 
them upside down and slide them onto
these<00:01:39.069> two<00:01:39.550> pegs<00:01:40.319> these<00:01:41.319> get<00:01:41.800> held<00:01:42.039> in<00:01:42.280> with

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:42.759 
these two pegs these get held in with

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:45.840 
these two pegs these get held in with
two<00:01:43.030> screws<00:01:43.830> of<00:01:44.830> course<00:01:45.069> I<00:01:45.190> have<00:01:45.280> a<00:01:45.369> washer<00:01:45.729> on

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
two screws of course I have a washer on

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:54.020 
two screws of course I have a washer on
them<00:01:47.789> one<00:01:48.789> there<00:01:49.090> and<00:01:49.509> the<00:01:49.780> other<00:01:50.280> there<00:01:51.280> and

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.310 

link<00:01:55.030> with<00:01:55.180> other<00:01:55.360> parts<00:01:55.780> of<00:01:55.899> the<00:01:55.990> steering

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320 
link with other parts of the steering

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.200 
link with other parts of the steering
bellcranks<00:01:56.500> I'm<00:01:57.219> not<00:01:57.549> going<00:01:57.729> to<00:01:57.790> tighten<00:01:58.030> the

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
bellcranks I'm not going to tighten the

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.980 
bellcranks I'm not going to tighten the
screw<00:01:58.479> all<00:01:58.810> the<00:01:58.840> way<00:02:00.299> makes<00:02:01.299> it<00:02:01.450> much<00:02:01.630> easier

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
screw all the way makes it much easier

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:07.440 
screw all the way makes it much easier
for<00:02:02.380> the<00:02:02.500> servo<00:02:02.890> if<00:02:03.250> all<00:02:03.430> this<00:02:03.640> stays<00:02:03.939> loose<00:02:06.450> so

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
for the servo if all this stays loose so

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.779 
for the servo if all this stays loose so
this<00:02:07.630> pretty<00:02:07.899> much<00:02:07.990> completes<00:02:08.709> the<00:02:09.549> front

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
this pretty much completes the front

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:13.250 
this pretty much completes the front
assembly<00:02:10.140> all<00:02:11.140> I<00:02:11.230> have<00:02:11.410> to<00:02:11.530> do<00:02:11.680> is<00:02:12.070> get<00:02:12.579> a<00:02:12.610> servo

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
assembly all I have to do is get a servo

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.729 
assembly all I have to do is get a servo
which<00:02:14.260> might<00:02:14.560> be<00:02:14.709> happening<00:02:15.359> don't<00:02:16.359> know<00:02:16.510> yet

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
which might be happening don't know yet

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:19.440 
which might be happening don't know yet
but<00:02:17.739> it<00:02:18.280> should<00:02:18.310> be<00:02:18.519> the<00:02:18.760> next<00:02:19.000> part<00:02:19.239> that<00:02:19.420> I

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
but it should be the next part that I

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.930 
but it should be the next part that I
get<00:02:20.010> and<00:02:21.840> I<00:02:22.840> got<00:02:23.049> the<00:02:23.230> front<00:02:23.440> wheels<00:02:23.769> I<00:02:24.250> got<00:02:24.760> a

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
need the pins to hold the wheels to the

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.599 
need the pins to hold the wheels to the
steering<00:02:31.120> bellcranks<00:02:31.590> tooling<00:02:32.590> yeah<00:02:32.920> not<00:02:33.489> the

steering bellcranks but the steering

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:39.620 
steering bellcranks but the steering
blocks<00:02:35.440> there<00:02:36.130> we<00:02:36.220> go<00:02:36.630> well<00:02:37.630> anyways<00:02:38.459> this

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630

these<00:02:45.160> of<00:02:45.370> course<00:02:45.580> would<00:02:45.790> go<00:02:46.030> on<00:02:46.180> to<00:02:46.360> these<00:02:46.540> two

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
these of course would go on to these two

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.660 
these of course would go on to these two
screws<00:02:49.110> but<00:02:50.110> yeah<00:02:50.260> I<00:02:50.590> am<00:02:50.650> pretty<00:02:51.100> much<00:02:51.190> done

there<00:04:33.700> really<00:04:33.880> isn't<00:04:34.180> any<00:04:34.570> room<00:04:34.810> for<00:04:34.870> me<00:04:35.200> to

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:35.350 
there really isn't any room for me to

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:38.850 
there really isn't any room for me to
put<00:04:35.680> some<00:04:35.979> into<00:04:36.669> the<00:04:36.700> body<00:04:37.289> you<00:04:38.289> know<00:04:38.440> I<00:04:38.470> could

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
put some into the body you know I could

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.370 
put some into the body you know I could
put<00:04:39.190> some<00:04:39.400> LEDs<00:04:39.820> into<00:04:40.030> the<00:04:40.450> bumper<00:04:40.900> but<00:04:41.140> I

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:41.380 
put some LEDs into the bumper but I

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:41.790

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:44.970 
like that it seems like not a good idea

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:49.350 
like that it seems like not a good idea
but<00:04:45.970> I<00:04:46.330> can<00:04:46.690> do<00:04:46.900> ground<00:04:47.200> effects<00:04:47.590> and<00:04:48.060> I<00:04:49.060> will

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
but I can do ground effects and I will

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.900 
but I can do ground effects and I will
be<00:04:49.570> doing<00:04:49.750> ground<00:04:50.110> effects<00:04:50.470> the<00:04:51.460> only<00:04:51.670> thing

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:51.910 
be doing ground effects the only thing

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:54.150 
be doing ground effects the only thing
that<00:04:52.090> I<00:04:52.120> was<00:04:52.450> wondering<00:04:52.660> for<00:04:53.290> a<00:04:53.350> long<00:04:53.440> time<00:04:53.890> is

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.160 
that I was wondering for a long time is

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.280 
that I was wondering for a long time is
what<00:04:54.370> color<00:04:54.670> is<00:04:55.120> next<00:04:55.780> it's<00:04:55.900> going<00:04:56.080> to<00:04:56.140> be

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:56.290 
what color is next it's going to be

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:58.860 
what color is next it's going to be
because<00:04:56.530> demon<00:04:57.520> my<00:04:57.700> wrestler<00:04:58.120> is<00:04:58.300> obviously

00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:58.870 
because demon my wrestler is obviously

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:02.520 
because demon my wrestler is obviously
blue<00:04:59.140> and<00:04:59.350> black<00:05:00.330> so<00:05:01.330> what<00:05:01.900> color<00:05:02.140> does<00:05:02.350> that

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:02.530 
blue and black so what color does that

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:05.190 
blue and black so what color does that
really<00:05:02.680> leave<00:05:02.950> for<00:05:03.190> this<00:05:03.310> I<00:05:03.730> could<00:05:04.570> do<00:05:04.750> green

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:05.200 
really leave for this I could do green

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:09.300 
really leave for this I could do green
but<00:05:05.980> I<00:05:07.500> don't<00:05:08.500> know<00:05:08.590> I<00:05:08.620> don't<00:05:08.890> really<00:05:09.070> like

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.310 
but I don't know I don't really like

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:13.250 
but I don't know I don't really like
green<00:05:09.660> so<00:05:10.660> I<00:05:11.140> guess<00:05:11.470> I'll<00:05:11.680> go<00:05:11.860> ahead<00:05:11.980> and<00:05:12.520> do

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:13.260 
green so I guess I'll go ahead and do

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:17.370 
green so I guess I'll go ahead and do
purple<00:05:15.150> yes<00:05:16.150> you<00:05:16.540> heard<00:05:16.720> me<00:05:16.780> right
