00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:05.780
Igor, you and I shall be at the very heart

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:08.643
of a scientific enterprise that will change the world.

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.940
We shall create a life out of death.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.940
It's...alive.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.300
You realize how significant this is...?!

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.361
Oh I have an inkling...

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.380
I'm Detective Inspector Turpin.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.980
I'm here to investigate missing body parts.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.492
Not sure what you mean, sir.

00:00:28.492 --> 00:00:32.078
Are you not afraid to challenge the natural order, Mr Frankenstein?

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.700
No.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.097
And it's FrankenSTEIN.

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.269
We shall create a man.

00:00:41.097 --> 00:00:42.457
After our own image.

00:00:44.088 --> 00:00:44.888
Questions?

00:00:44.888 --> 00:00:45.680
Um...well -

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:46.319
You're welcome!

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.480
I think it is time...

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:52.260
we met our monster.

00:00:54.525 --> 00:00:55.565
Victor, don't!

00:00:55.565 --> 00:00:56.440
Full charge!

00:01:10.904 --> 00:01:11.704
It's alive.

00:01:11.704 --> 00:01:13.404
Yes, well that's rather obvious.

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:16.900
You have the chance to be part of something -

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.340
Of what?! Being electrocuted?!

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:20.920
Chased by monsters?!

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:23.910
And hunted by the police?!

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.600
Well if you're going to concentrate on the DARK side!

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.440
Be careful, Mr Frankenstein.

00:01:33.875 --> 00:01:35.875
You toy with wrathful forces.

00:01:39.235 --> 00:01:40.915
I cannot argue with that.
