 six hours of effort in the days 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.340
 sunny summer I like to go to the 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:57.070

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.830
 when you are resting in the pool 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:32.770

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.600
 Favorite magazines are no the ebook 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.220

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.320
 a little boring 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.990
