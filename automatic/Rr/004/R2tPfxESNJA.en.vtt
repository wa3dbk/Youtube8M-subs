as opposed to the traditional way where
the<00:00:37.399> teacher<00:00:37.609> just<00:00:37.969> gives<00:00:38.210> lecture<00:00:38.719> and

00:00:38.889 --> 00:00:38.899 
the teacher just gives lecture and

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:43.570 
work at their own pace do problems and

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:45.910 
work at their own pace do problems and
the<00:00:44.570> computer<00:00:45.019> is<00:00:45.170> there<00:00:45.350> to<00:00:45.530> tell<00:00:45.710> them

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
the computer is there to tell them

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.819 
the computer is there to tell them
step-by-step<00:00:46.219> if<00:00:46.850> they<00:00:47.120> do<00:00:47.179> something<00:00:47.629> wrong

step-by-step if they do something wrong
what's<00:00:48.829> great<00:00:49.190> about<00:00:49.309> the<00:00:49.699> math<00:00:49.909> lab<00:00:50.210> is<00:00:50.569> that

00:00:50.709 --> 00:00:50.719 
what's great about the math lab is that

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:52.419 
what's great about the math lab is that
I'm<00:00:50.839> actually<00:00:51.050> doing<00:00:51.499> the<00:00:51.800> problems<00:00:52.219> myself

00:00:52.419 --> 00:00:52.429 
I'm actually doing the problems myself

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:54.880 
I'm actually doing the problems myself
in<00:00:52.940> the<00:00:53.300> lab<00:00:53.449> instead<00:00:54.229> of<00:00:54.350> just<00:00:54.469> watching<00:00:54.859> my

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 
in the lab instead of just watching my

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.680 
in the lab instead of just watching my
teacher<00:00:55.249> do<00:00:55.460> them<00:00:55.609> for<00:00:55.760> an<00:00:55.850> hour<00:00:55.909> so<00:00:56.510> when<00:00:56.629> I

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.690 
teacher do them for an hour so when I

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.119 
teacher do them for an hour so when I
get<00:00:56.780> home<00:00:57.050> it's<00:00:57.319> not<00:00:57.530> like<00:00:57.739> it's<00:00:57.979> the<00:00:58.039> first

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:58.129 
get home it's not like it's the first

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:00.579 
get home it's not like it's the first
time<00:00:58.489> I'm<00:00:58.639> tackling<00:00:59.030> them<00:00:59.469> basically<00:01:00.469> the

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:00.589 
time I'm tackling them basically the

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:02.559 
time I'm tackling them basically the
idea<00:01:00.649> is<00:01:01.010> to<00:01:01.129> get<00:01:01.519> them<00:01:01.729> doing<00:01:02.269> math<00:01:02.510> problems

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:02.569 
idea is to get them doing math problems

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:05.740 
idea is to get them doing math problems
