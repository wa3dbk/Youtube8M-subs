of just tap water so what we're gonna do
is<00:01:17.520> just<00:01:17.700> pulse<00:01:17.970> it<00:01:18.150> just<00:01:18.630> fit<00:01:18.810> by<00:01:18.930> a<00:01:18.960> bit<00:01:19.140> to

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
is just pulse it just fit by a bit to

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:25.730 
is just pulse it just fit by a bit to
break<00:01:19.530> those<00:01:19.710> arms<00:01:20.130> up

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740

so that's where you want it to be at so
I'll<00:01:29.170> just<00:01:29.290> pop<00:01:29.530> this<00:01:29.680> sort<00:01:29.950> of<00:01:30.040> makeshift<00:01:30.610> lid

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:30.940 
I'll just pop this sort of makeshift lid

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.859 
I'll just pop this sort of makeshift lid
off<00:01:31.680> and<00:01:32.680> have<00:01:32.860> a<00:01:32.920> look<00:01:33.130> yeah<00:01:34.090> it's<00:01:34.210> perfect

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
an old sort of clean t-shirt cut it into

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.460 
an old sort of clean t-shirt cut it into
a<00:01:48.759> square<00:01:49.060> and<00:01:49.270> strain<00:01:49.869> it<00:01:49.990> through<00:01:50.140> that<00:01:50.290> so

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470 
a square and strain it through that so

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:51.660 
a square and strain it through that so
what's<00:01:50.619> it's<00:01:50.830> going<00:01:50.860> to<00:01:51.009> catch<00:01:51.220> all<00:01:51.550> those

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
what's it's going to catch all those

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.280 
what's it's going to catch all those
sort<00:01:51.909> of<00:01:51.970> fine<00:01:52.149> particles<00:01:52.720> and<00:01:52.899> you're<00:01:53.140> left

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.290 
sort of fine particles and you're left
