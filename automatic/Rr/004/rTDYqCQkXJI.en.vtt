basically just show some slash commands
and<00:00:22.439> a<00:00:23.160> couple<00:00:23.550> ways<00:00:23.699> to<00:00:24.090> use<00:00:24.570> it<00:00:24.810> so<00:00:25.769> first<00:00:26.250> off

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
and a couple ways to use it so first off

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.620 
and a couple ways to use it so first off
I<00:00:26.849> will<00:00:28.519> press<00:00:29.519> on<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:29.880> first<00:00:30.150> slash<00:00:30.390> key<00:00:30.570> of

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
I will press on the first slash key of

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.950 
I will press on the first slash key of
Man<00:00:30.929> which<00:00:31.109> is<00:00:31.260> /give<00:00:31.920> @p<00:00:33.980> your<00:00:34.980> /give<00:00:35.910> @p

which is the nearest person as you may

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.270 
which is the nearest person as you may
have<00:00:39.030> known<00:00:39.600> through<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.320> previous<00:00:40.800> videos

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
have known through the previous videos

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.389 
have known through the previous videos
one<00:00:42.180> which<00:00:42.629> is<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:42.960> type<00:00:43.200> of<00:00:43.230> items<00:00:43.680> and<00:00:43.980> the

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
one which is the type of items and the

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.790 
one which is the type of items and the
twelve<00:00:45.180> which<00:00:45.840> is<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:46.110> amount<00:00:46.320> of<00:00:46.440> items

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
twelve which is the amount of items

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.430 
twelve which is the amount of items
these<00:00:47.610> items<00:00:48.120> these<00:00:48.629> numbers<00:00:49.230> could<00:00:49.379> be

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
these items these numbers could be

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.279 
these items these numbers could be
interchangeable<00:00:50.280> but<00:00:50.460> if<00:00:50.640> you<00:00:50.760> want<00:00:50.940> the

00:00:51.279 --> 00:00:51.289 
interchangeable but if you want the

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:56.299 
interchangeable but if you want the
certain<00:00:52.289> items<00:00:53.039> one<00:00:53.699> has<00:00:53.940> to<00:00:54.149> be<00:00:54.379> the<00:00:55.379> item

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
certain items one has to be the item

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.310 
certain items one has to be the item
number<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:56.850> twelve<00:00:57.390> needs<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:57.840> be<00:00:57.899> amount<00:00:58.230> you

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
number and twelve needs to be amount you

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:58.670 
number and twelve needs to be amount you
want

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
want

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.229 
want
I<00:00:58.770> believe<00:00:59.760> this<00:00:59.940> only<00:01:00.149> goes<00:01:00.420> up<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:00.750> 64<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:02.239> so

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
I believe this only goes up to 64 and so

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.410 
I believe this only goes up to 64 and so
first<00:01:03.629> off<00:01:03.840> is<00:01:04.189> slash<00:01:05.189> give<00:01:05.519> one<00:01:06.000> which<00:01:06.240> is

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
first off is slash give one which is

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.050 
first off is slash give one which is
stone<00:01:06.750> if<00:01:07.080> you<00:01:07.860> want<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.130> know<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.490> rest<00:01:08.790> of

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
stone if you want to know the rest of

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.570 
stone if you want to know the rest of
the<00:01:09.710> item<00:01:10.710> list<00:01:10.860> you<00:01:11.100> can<00:01:11.250> check<00:01:11.430> in<00:01:11.549> the

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
the item list you can check in the

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.620 
the item list you can check in the
description<00:01:11.760> below<00:01:12.270> so<00:01:12.950> for<00:01:14.000> stone<00:01:15.030> you<00:01:15.420> could

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
description below so for stone you could

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.399 
description below so for stone you could
easily<00:01:16.049> so<00:01:16.680> let's<00:01:16.890> go<00:01:17.130> back<00:01:17.159> to<00:01:18.229> survival<00:01:19.229> mode

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
easily so let's go back to survival mode

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.130 
easily so let's go back to survival mode
and<00:01:19.590> you<00:01:20.369> could<00:01:20.549> easily<00:01:20.729> make<00:01:21.360> some<00:01:21.659> fun

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
and you could easily make some fun

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.590 
and you could easily make some fun
contraptions<00:01:22.920> so<00:01:23.159> I<00:01:23.189> made<00:01:23.580> a<00:01:23.610> simple<00:01:24.000> in<00:01:24.299> here

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
contraptions so I made a simple in here

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.120 
contraptions so I made a simple in here
with<00:01:25.229> love<00:01:25.530> redstone<00:01:26.299> so<00:01:27.299> simply<00:01:27.810> you<00:01:28.049> step<00:01:28.920> in

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
with love redstone so simply you step in

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.520 
with love redstone so simply you step in
here<00:01:29.400> and<00:01:29.610> if<00:01:30.299> you<00:01:30.479> place<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.990> still<00:01:31.229> block

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
here and if you place the still block

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.140 
here and if you place the still block
here<00:01:32.119> it<00:01:33.119> opens<00:01:33.659> up<00:01:33.869> this<00:01:34.079> doorway<00:01:34.409> and

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
here it opens up this doorway and

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:40.749 
here it opens up this doorway and
through<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:37.400> Pistons<00:01:38.400> being<00:01:39.710> contraption

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:40.759 
through the Pistons being contraption

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:47.060 
through the Pistons being contraption
makes<00:01:43.040> this<00:01:44.040> redstone<00:01:44.549> go<00:01:45.119> off<00:01:45.360> which<00:01:46.170> this

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
makes this redstone go off which this

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.550 
makes this redstone go off which this
rest<00:01:47.369> don't<00:01:47.549> turn<00:01:48.090> back<00:01:48.210> on<00:01:48.479> and<00:01:49.259> makes<00:01:49.470> a

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
rest don't turn back on and makes a

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.980 
rest don't turn back on and makes a
chain<00:01:49.860> reaction<00:01:50.040> to<00:01:50.579> turn<00:01:50.850> off<00:01:51.000> this<00:01:51.390> piston

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
chain reaction to turn off this piston

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.200 
chain reaction to turn off this piston
and<00:01:52.549> also<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:53.759> piston<00:01:54.329> over

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.469 

sure<00:01:58.210> believe<00:01:58.740> yes<00:01:59.740> and<00:02:00.039> it<00:02:00.640> also<00:02:00.909> turns<00:02:01.329> off

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 
sure believe yes and it also turns off

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:05.459 
sure believe yes and it also turns off
this<00:02:01.960> piston<00:02:02.920> which<00:02:03.670> will<00:02:04.090> allow<00:02:04.780> doorway<00:02:05.409> for

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:05.469 
this piston which will allow doorway for

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:08.550 
this piston which will allow doorway for
me<00:02:05.829> to<00:02:05.950> pass<00:02:06.159> through<00:02:07.050> this<00:02:08.050> could<00:02:08.289> be<00:02:08.379> useful

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
me to pass through this could be useful

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.350 
me to pass through this could be useful
for<00:02:09.069> certain<00:02:11.010> for<00:02:12.010> certain<00:02:12.370> adventure<00:02:13.180> maps'

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
for certain for certain adventure maps'

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.360 
for certain for certain adventure maps'
you<00:02:13.629> could<00:02:13.810> have<00:02:13.989> a<00:02:14.019> soul<00:02:14.349> they<00:02:14.590> had<00:02:14.799> to<00:02:15.010> find<00:02:15.250> a

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
you could have a soul they had to find a

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.089 
you could have a soul they had to find a
button<00:02:15.640> and<00:02:16.170> if<00:02:17.170> they<00:02:17.319> press<00:02:17.560> the<00:02:17.680> button<00:02:17.920> to

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:18.099 
button and if they press the button to

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:20.220 
button and if they press the button to
get<00:02:18.250> certain<00:02:18.970> items<00:02:19.390> so<00:02:19.720> they<00:02:19.870> could<00:02:20.019> place

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
get certain items so they could place

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:27.180 
get certain items so they could place
here<00:02:20.530> and<00:02:24.930> also<00:02:25.930> I<00:02:25.959> created<00:02:26.470> this<00:02:26.650> contraption

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
here and also I created this contraption

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.430 
here and also I created this contraption
so<00:02:27.610> that<00:02:27.790> if<00:02:27.940> I<00:02:28.090> step<00:02:28.420> here<00:02:28.450> and<00:02:28.989> make<00:02:29.200> sure

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
so that if I step here and make sure

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.190 
so that if I step here and make sure
that<00:02:29.590> I<00:02:29.650> don't<00:02:30.220> just<00:02:30.519> walk<00:02:30.700> backwards<00:02:31.060> I<00:02:31.569> could

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
that I don't just walk backwards I could

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.569 
that I don't just walk backwards I could
easily<00:02:32.349> just<00:02:32.620> jump<00:02:33.040> out<00:02:33.190> of<00:02:34.380> the<00:02:35.380> next<00:02:35.769> command

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:36.579 
easily just jump out of the next command

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:40.860 
easily just jump out of the next command
is<00:02:37.470> 298<00:02:38.470> which<00:02:38.890> is<00:02:39.069> a<00:02:39.099> big<00:02:39.400> step<00:02:39.670> from<00:02:39.880> one<00:02:40.090> but

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
is 298 which is a big step from one but

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.809 
is 298 which is a big step from one but
this<00:02:41.200> basically<00:02:41.709> just<00:02:41.950> shows<00:02:42.340> that<00:02:42.370> you<00:02:42.640> could

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:42.819 
this basically just shows that you could

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:47.720 
this basically just shows that you could
give<00:02:43.000> me<00:02:43.239> items<00:02:43.690> that<00:02:44.560> you<00:02:44.680> could<00:02:44.890> wear<00:02:45.129> like

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:54.509 

this<00:02:48.730> and<00:02:50.459> if<00:02:51.459> I<00:02:51.730> do<00:02:52.079> press<00:02:53.079> this<00:02:53.379> straight<00:02:54.370> on

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519 
this and if I do press this straight on

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:57.030 
this and if I do press this straight on
like<00:02:54.700> I<00:02:54.790> usually<00:02:55.090> just<00:02:55.480> right-click<00:02:55.959> and<00:02:56.200> put

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
like I usually just right-click and put

like I usually just right-click and put
on<00:02:57.160> my<00:02:57.540> hat<00:02:58.540> and<00:02:59.549> Nyx's<00:03:01.620> slash<00:03:02.620> gift<00:03:03.630> 313<00:03:04.630> 64

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:11.580 
on my hat and Nyx's slash gift 313 64
the<00:03:06.989> 313<00:03:07.989> basically<00:03:08.769> is<00:03:08.889> diamond<00:03:09.639> boots<00:03:10.590> you

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
the 313 basically is diamond boots you

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.170 
the 313 basically is diamond boots you
could<00:03:11.799> check<00:03:11.980> in<00:03:12.099> the<00:03:12.190> description<00:03:12.670> below<00:03:12.790> for

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
could check in the description below for

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.750 
could check in the description below for
the<00:03:13.359> rest<00:03:13.599> of<00:03:13.780> the<00:03:13.840> numbers<00:03:14.260> which<00:03:14.920> may<00:03:15.579> be<00:03:15.639> a

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
the rest of the numbers which may be a

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.970 
the rest of the numbers which may be a
pretty<00:03:16.000> long<00:03:16.209> list<00:03:16.450> but<00:03:16.690> this<00:03:17.290> basically<00:03:17.709> just

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
pretty long list but this basically just

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.490 
pretty long list but this basically just
shows<00:03:18.220> that<00:03:18.250> you<00:03:18.639> give<00:03:18.849> up<00:03:19.540> to<00:03:19.870> a<00:03:19.900> full<00:03:20.170> stack

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
shows that you give up to a full stack

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.319 
shows that you give up to a full stack
of<00:03:21.180> a<00:03:22.180> certain<00:03:22.720> item<00:03:22.900> and<00:03:23.760> also<00:03:24.760> I<00:03:24.790> could<00:03:24.940> wear

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:25.329 
of a certain item and also I could wear

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:31.229 
of a certain item and also I could wear
this<00:03:25.540> all<00:03:26.760> hopefully<00:03:27.760> all<00:03:28.030> at<00:03:28.239> once<00:03:30.030> but<00:03:31.030> I

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:31.239 
this all hopefully all at once but I

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:33.930 
this all hopefully all at once but I
can't<00:03:31.630> and<00:03:31.959> it<00:03:32.470> could<00:03:32.919> be<00:03:33.069> really<00:03:33.340> useful<00:03:33.370> but

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
can't and it could be really useful but

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:35.550 
can't and it could be really useful but
it's<00:03:34.090> good<00:03:34.299> for<00:03:34.540> it<00:03:34.630> enchanting<00:03:35.260> when<00:03:35.410> you're

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560
