00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
hacking doesn't do any of you know if

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.410 
hacking doesn't do any of you know if
there's<00:01:16.680> a<00:01:16.740> way<00:01:16.920> to<00:01:16.979> get<00:01:17.159> that<00:01:17.430> new<00:01:17.909> firmware

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
there's a way to get that new firmware

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.190 
there's a way to get that new firmware
onto<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:19.409> older<00:01:19.860> ipods<00:01:20.310> I<00:01:20.640> believe<00:01:21.390> my<00:01:21.630> ipod

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
onto the older ipods I believe my ipod

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.820 
onto the older ipods I believe my ipod
it<00:01:22.380> would<00:01:22.470> be<00:01:22.619> either<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:23.070> 5<00:01:23.909> or<00:01:24.270> 5.5<00:01:24.659> in<00:01:25.560> the

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
it would be either a 5 or 5.5 in the

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.950 
it would be either a 5 or 5.5 in the
generation<00:01:26.250> line<00:01:26.670> those<00:01:27.360> new<00:01:27.570> ones<00:01:27.810> the

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
generation line those new ones the

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.660 
generation line those new ones the
classic<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.470> new<00:01:28.590> nano<00:01:28.860> i<00:01:29.009> suppose<00:01:29.460> those

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
classic the new nano i suppose those

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.969 
classic the new nano i suppose those
will<00:01:29.759> probably<00:01:29.790> be<00:01:30.119> generation<00:01:30.570> 6<00:01:30.960> from<00:01:31.860> what

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
will probably be generation 6 from what

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.890 
will probably be generation 6 from what
i<00:01:32.009> can<00:01:32.100> gather<00:01:32.479> but<00:01:33.479> anyway<00:01:33.689> that's<00:01:33.780> not

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
i can gather but anyway that's not

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.990 
i can gather but anyway that's not
really<00:01:34.110> important<00:01:34.530> what<00:01:35.340> I'm<00:01:35.520> asking<00:01:35.970> for

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
really important what I'm asking for
