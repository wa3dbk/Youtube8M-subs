as you can see I've got my drawing here
this<00:00:42.070> drawing<00:00:42.309> was<00:00:42.550> done<00:00:42.730> by<00:00:42.910> Matt<00:00:43.270> Martin

vortex<00:00:46.180> I<00:00:48.210> really<00:00:49.210> loved<00:00:49.390> inking<00:00:49.659> his<00:00:50.019> work

00:00:50.369 --> 00:00:50.379 
vortex I really loved inking his work

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:52.590 
vortex I really loved inking his work
because<00:00:50.920> his<00:00:51.309> pencils<00:00:51.820> are<00:00:51.970> very<00:00:52.239> tight

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:52.600 
because his pencils are very tight

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.700 
because his pencils are very tight
they're<00:00:53.559> very<00:00:53.769> easy<00:00:54.010> to<00:00:54.129> interpret<00:00:54.820> and

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
they're very easy to interpret and

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.430 
they're very easy to interpret and
replicate<00:00:56.710> into<00:00:57.040> a<00:00:57.309> digital<00:00:57.670> inking<00:00:58.440> vector

00:00:59.430 --> 00:00:59.440 
replicate into a digital inking vector

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.969 
replicate into a digital inking vector
basically<00:01:00.420> as<00:01:01.420> you<00:01:02.350> can<00:01:02.379> see<00:01:02.620> I've<00:01:02.739> got<00:01:02.860> the

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:02.979 
basically as you can see I've got the

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:05.430 
basically as you can see I've got the
drawing<00:01:03.250> here<00:01:03.519> in<00:01:03.610> layer<00:01:03.790> 1<00:01:03.879> a<00:01:04.510> layers<00:01:05.019> locked

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:05.440 
drawing here in layer 1 a layers locked

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.840 
drawing here in layer 1 a layers locked
so<00:01:05.979> I<00:01:06.010> can't<00:01:06.340> mistakenly<00:01:06.780> draw<00:01:07.780> in<00:01:08.049> that<00:01:08.229> layer

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
so I can't mistakenly draw in that layer

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.620 
so I can't mistakenly draw in that layer
anchor<00:01:09.850> in<00:01:10.000> layer<00:01:10.210> 2<00:01:10.860> and<00:01:11.860> I'll<00:01:11.979> make<00:01:12.130> that

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
anchor in layer 2 and I'll make that

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.510 
anchor in layer 2 and I'll make that
layer<00:01:13.630> visible<00:01:14.170> now<00:01:14.320> you<00:01:14.380> can<00:01:14.620> see<00:01:14.799> I<00:01:14.830> started

have assigned shortcut keys to one of

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:11.520 
have assigned shortcut keys to one of

zoom out and one of them is set to the

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:20.100 
zoom out and one of them is set to the
hand<00:03:18.040> tool<00:03:18.390> so<00:03:19.390> I<00:03:19.450> can<00:03:19.630> move<00:03:19.780> the<00:03:19.930> drawing

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 
hand tool so I can move the drawing

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:24.390 
hand tool so I can move the drawing
around<00:03:20.349> to<00:03:21.280> wherever<00:03:21.459> I<00:03:21.640> might<00:03:21.910> want<00:03:23.400> the

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
around to wherever I might want the

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.569 
around to wherever I might want the
other<00:03:24.640> one<00:03:24.880> is<00:03:25.120> the<00:03:25.660> undo<00:03:26.049> button<00:03:26.400> similar<00:03:27.400> to

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:27.579 
other one is the undo button similar to

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:32.360 
other one is the undo button similar to
what<00:03:27.760> control<00:03:28.329> Z<00:03:28.630> would<00:03:28.780> be<00:03:29.019> on<00:03:30.480> the<00:03:31.480> keyboard

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
what control Z would be on the keyboard

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.870 
what control Z would be on the keyboard
so<00:03:33.370> having<00:03:33.910> said<00:03:34.600> all<00:03:34.630> that<00:03:35.280> let's<00:03:36.280> get<00:03:36.459> inking

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
so having said all that let's get inking

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.069 
so having said all that let's get inking
and<00:03:37.530> you're<00:03:38.530> able<00:03:38.739> to<00:03:38.769> see<00:03:39.540> how<00:03:40.540> this<00:03:40.750> is<00:03:40.930> going

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:41.079 
and you're able to see how this is going

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:44.400 
and you're able to see how this is going
to<00:03:41.230> shape<00:03:41.440> up<00:03:42.480> as<00:03:43.480> I<00:03:43.600> mentioned<00:03:43.989> in<00:03:44.079> my<00:03:44.109> other

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
to shape up as I mentioned in my other

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:53.210 
to shape up as I mentioned in my other
tutorial<00:03:45.060> this<00:03:46.060> process<00:03:46.630> is<00:03:49.139> very<00:03:50.139> forgiving

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.280 

it<00:03:54.220> can<00:03:55.120> be<00:03:55.299> a<00:03:55.329> time-saver

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
it can be a time-saver

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:57.300 
it can be a time-saver
there's<00:03:56.500> a<00:03:56.560> little<00:03:56.650> bit<00:03:56.799> of<00:03:56.859> a<00:03:56.920> learning<00:03:57.100> curve

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
there's a little bit of a learning curve

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:03.479 
there's a little bit of a learning curve
with<00:03:57.519> it<00:03:57.910> of<00:03:58.690> course<00:03:59.700> but<00:04:02.160> it's<00:04:03.160> one<00:04:03.310> of<00:04:03.400> the

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:03.489 
with it of course but it's one of the

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:05.990 
with it of course but it's one of the
nice<00:04:03.670> things<00:04:04.000> about<00:04:04.120> digital<00:04:04.660> inking<00:04:05.079> is<00:04:05.319> that

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
nice things about digital inking is that

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.199 
nice things about digital inking is that
you<00:04:07.000> don't<00:04:07.180> have<00:04:07.239> to<00:04:07.480> worry<00:04:08.670> about<00:04:09.670> making<00:04:10.000> a

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:10.209 
you don't have to worry about making a

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:11.849 
you don't have to worry about making a
mistake<00:04:10.239> because<00:04:11.079> you<00:04:11.200> can<00:04:11.349> simply<00:04:11.680> go<00:04:11.829> over

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:11.859 
mistake because you can simply go over

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:16.860 
mistake because you can simply go over
it<00:04:12.510> or<00:04:13.510> undo<00:04:14.049> it<00:04:14.230> or<00:04:15.220> simply<00:04:15.849> select<00:04:16.209> a<00:04:16.539> stroke

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:16.870 
it or undo it or simply select a stroke

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.560 
it or undo it or simply select a stroke
that<00:04:17.079> you've<00:04:17.260> made<00:04:17.560> and<00:04:18.180> delete<00:04:19.180> it<00:04:19.329> if<00:04:19.450> you

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
that you've made and delete it if you

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:24.200 
that you've made and delete it if you
don't<00:04:19.750> like<00:04:19.930> the<00:04:20.169> line<00:04:20.380> it<00:04:20.799> makes<00:04:22.139> editing<00:04:23.139> and

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
don't like the line it makes editing and

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.800 
don't like the line it makes editing and
things<00:04:25.210> like<00:04:25.510> that<00:04:25.840> very<00:04:26.410> easy<00:04:27.090> now<00:04:28.090> it's

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
things like that very easy now it's

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.870 
things like that very easy now it's
tough<00:04:29.200> to<00:04:29.470> do<00:04:29.590> this<00:04:29.770> and<00:04:30.010> talk<00:04:30.580> at<00:04:30.760> the<00:04:30.820> same

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 
tough to do this and talk at the same

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.020 
tough to do this and talk at the same
time<00:04:31.270> and<00:04:31.570> be<00:04:31.800> 100%<00:04:32.800> accurate<00:04:33.460> with<00:04:33.820> what<00:04:34.000> I

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
time and be 100% accurate with what I

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:37.110 
time and be 100% accurate with what I
want<00:04:34.240> to<00:04:34.300> do<00:04:34.419> but<00:04:34.690> you<00:04:34.900> get<00:04:35.110> that<00:04:35.349> general<00:04:35.740> idea

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
want to do but you get that general idea

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.000 
want to do but you get that general idea
of<00:04:37.620> what's<00:04:38.620> going<00:04:38.860> on<00:04:39.130> here<00:04:39.580> and<00:04:39.730> you<00:04:39.970> can<00:04:40.000> see

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.010 
of what's going on here and you can see

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:47.250 
of what's going on here and you can see
how<00:04:42.090> the<00:04:43.090> brush<00:04:43.389> tool<00:04:43.660> itself<00:04:45.840> mimics<00:04:46.840> how<00:04:47.199> you

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:47.260 
how the brush tool itself mimics how you

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.020 
how the brush tool itself mimics how you
actually<00:04:47.650> draw<00:04:48.130> with<00:04:48.430> the<00:04:48.520> thickness<00:04:48.729> of<00:04:48.940> the

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 
actually draw with the thickness of the

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:55.020 
actually draw with the thickness of the
lines<00:04:49.300> and<00:04:50.050> and<00:04:50.940> things<00:04:51.940> like<00:04:52.210> that<00:04:53.910> like<00:04:54.910> I

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.030 
lines and and things like that like I

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:57.590 
lines and and things like that like I
mentioned<00:04:55.389> before<00:04:55.419> Matt's<00:04:56.080> work<00:04:56.410> is<00:04:56.650> very

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:57.600 
mentioned before Matt's work is very

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.450 
mentioned before Matt's work is very
tight<00:04:58.600> typically<00:04:59.590> so<00:04:59.860> it's<00:05:00.010> really<00:05:00.130> easy<00:05:00.250> to

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 
tight typically so it's really easy to

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:06.570 
tight typically so it's really easy to
interpret<00:05:02.880> what<00:05:03.880> he<00:05:04.120> was<00:05:04.300> going<00:05:04.660> for<00:05:04.900> and<00:05:05.580> the

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.580 
interpret what he was going for and the

in a minute

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:18.879 
in a minute
definitely<00:06:16.280> helps<00:06:16.490> and<00:06:17.229> trying<00:06:18.229> to<00:06:18.440> get<00:06:18.680> that

00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:18.889 
definitely helps and trying to get that

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:22.839 
definitely helps and trying to get that
as<00:06:19.520> close<00:06:19.909> to<00:06:20.860> how<00:06:21.860> you<00:06:21.919> would<00:06:22.190> actually<00:06:22.340> draw

00:06:22.839 --> 00:06:22.849 
as close to how you would actually draw

00:06:22.849 --> 00:06:31.689 
as close to how you would actually draw
on<00:06:23.270> paper<00:06:25.419> to<00:06:26.419> getting<00:06:26.690> what<00:06:26.840> you<00:06:26.990> want<00:06:30.460> as<00:06:31.460> you

00:06:31.689 --> 00:06:31.699 
on paper to getting what you want as you

00:06:31.699 --> 00:06:33.850 
on paper to getting what you want as you
can<00:06:31.849> see<00:06:32.000> the<00:06:32.150> harder<00:06:32.449> I<00:06:32.479> press<00:06:32.930> the<00:06:33.349> wider<00:06:33.590> my

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:33.860 
can see the harder I press the wider my

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:36.820 
can see the harder I press the wider my
ink<00:06:34.069> strokes<00:06:34.279> are<00:06:35.139> similar<00:06:36.139> to<00:06:36.289> using<00:06:36.409> an<00:06:36.680> ink

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:36.830

brush<00:06:45.159> zoom<00:06:46.159> out<00:06:46.310> here<00:06:46.370> so<00:06:46.879> you<00:06:46.909> can<00:06:47.180> see<00:06:47.860> the

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:48.860 
brush zoom out here so you can see the

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:52.959 
brush zoom out here so you can see the
progress<00:06:49.159> done<00:06:51.099> you<00:06:52.099> can<00:06:52.250> see<00:06:52.400> the<00:06:52.550> drawing<00:06:52.729> is

00:06:52.959 --> 00:06:52.969 
progress done you can see the drawing is

00:06:52.969 --> 00:06:56.290 
progress done you can see the drawing is
starting<00:06:53.270> to<00:06:53.360> take<00:06:53.509> shape<00:06:54.940> those<00:06:55.940> settings

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:56.300

00:07:01.629 --> 00:07:01.639 
here and you can actually assign these

per program if you would like I just

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:07.420 
per program if you would like I just

confusing<00:07:23.330> if<00:07:23.839> you're<00:07:24.560> drawing<00:07:24.860> and<00:07:25.310> you<00:07:25.400> hit

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:25.550 
confusing if you're drawing and you hit

confusing if you're drawing and you hit
the<00:07:25.669> button<00:07:25.819> with<00:07:26.599> your<00:07:26.629> finger<00:07:26.810> and<00:07:27.349> it<00:07:27.800> just

the button with your finger and it just

the button with your finger and it just
it's<00:07:29.000> just<00:07:29.210> easier<00:07:29.449> to<00:07:29.569> disable<00:07:30.020> them<00:07:30.169> and

00:07:31.559 --> 00:07:31.569 
it's just easier to disable them and

it's just easier to disable them and
that's<00:07:32.569> pretty<00:07:32.810> much<00:07:32.930> it<00:07:34.270> once<00:07:35.270> again<00:07:35.539> this

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:35.690
