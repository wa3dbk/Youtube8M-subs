tiles are designed to be mounted by

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.859 
tiles are designed to be mounted by
taking<00:00:28.500> advantage<00:00:28.619> of<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.699> magnets<00:00:30.570> that<00:00:30.660> are

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
taking advantage of the magnets that are

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.530 
taking advantage of the magnets that are
built<00:00:31.199> into<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.500> tiles<00:00:32.009> and<00:00:32.250> allow<00:00:33.120> you<00:00:33.180> to

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
built into the tiles and allow you to

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.420 
built into the tiles and allow you to
actually<00:00:33.840> mount<00:00:34.020> them<00:00:34.230> straight<00:00:34.620> on<00:00:34.800> to<00:00:35.070> metal

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
actually mount them straight on to metal

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.450 
actually mount them straight on to metal
surfaces<00:00:36.149> or<00:00:36.899> if<00:00:37.380> you<00:00:37.559> prefer<00:00:37.680> you<00:00:38.160> can<00:00:38.280> also

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
surfaces or if you prefer you can also

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.619 
surfaces or if you prefer you can also
mount<00:00:38.879> them<00:00:39.149> via<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:39.989> rear<00:00:40.739> screws<00:00:41.489> where<00:00:42.300> you

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
mount them via the rear screws where you

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.430 
mount them via the rear screws where you
can<00:00:42.870> screw<00:00:43.469> a<00:00:43.710> mount<00:00:44.610> onto<00:00:45.149> flat<00:00:45.539> surfaces<00:00:46.170> bit

timber<00:00:46.890> metal<00:00:47.399> or<00:00:47.579> otherwise<00:00:49.070> now<00:00:50.070> one<00:00:50.219> of<00:00:50.250> the

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
timber metal or otherwise now one of the

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.310 
timber metal or otherwise now one of the
beauties<00:00:50.730> of<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:51.030> tiles<00:00:51.300> are<00:00:51.690> that<00:00:52.170> they're

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
beauties of the tiles are that they're

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.580 
beauties of the tiles are that they're
designed<00:00:52.739> to<00:00:52.829> be<00:00:52.949> bent<00:00:53.850> and<00:00:54.090> flexed<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:54.960> so

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
designed to be bent and flexed and so

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.500 
designed to be bent and flexed and so
they<00:00:56.360> have<00:00:57.360> a<00:00:57.690> very<00:00:57.960> thin<00:00:58.320> profile<00:00:59.100> and<00:00:59.520> at<00:01:00.390> the

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
they have a very thin profile and at the

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.660 
they have a very thin profile and at the
same<00:01:00.719> time<00:01:01.109> you<00:01:01.559> can<00:01:01.739> wrap<00:01:02.039> them<00:01:02.250> around<00:01:02.370> a

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
same time you can wrap them around a

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.080 
same time you can wrap them around a
curved<00:01:02.910> surface<00:01:03.300> and<00:01:04.489> they<00:01:05.489> will<00:01:05.729> stay<00:01:05.970> in

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
curved surface and they will stay in

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.510 
curved surface and they will stay in
position<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:06.780> of<00:01:07.290> course<00:01:07.560> not<00:01:08.100> just<00:01:08.340> using

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
position and of course not just using

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.270 
position and of course not just using
one<00:01:08.850> top<00:01:09.150> but<00:01:09.479> a<00:01:09.570> whole<00:01:09.720> series<00:01:10.020> of<00:01:10.170> tiles<00:01:10.560> now

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
one top but a whole series of tiles now

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.880 
one top but a whole series of tiles now
I<00:01:11.310> don't<00:01:11.580> want<00:01:11.880> to<00:01:12.000> show<00:01:12.270> you<00:01:12.330> is<00:01:12.780> how<00:01:13.530> we<00:01:13.590> can

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
I don't want to show you is how we can

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:21.380 
I don't want to show you is how we can
use<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.729> magnetic<00:01:15.450> tile<00:01:17.030> on<00:01:18.030> a<00:01:18.630> sheet<00:01:19.020> of<00:01:20.390> this

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
use the magnetic tile on a sheet of this

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.499 
use the magnetic tile on a sheet of this
case<00:01:21.689> of<00:01:21.930> galvanized<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.909> sheet<00:01:23.909> of<00:01:24.030> Steel

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
case of galvanized the sheet of Steel

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.719 
case of galvanized the sheet of Steel
what<00:01:24.920> okay<00:01:26.960> so<00:01:27.960> what<00:01:28.140> we<00:01:28.290> have<00:01:28.320> is<00:01:28.829> some<00:01:29.280> tiles

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
what okay so what we have is some tiles

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.179 
what okay so what we have is some tiles
here<00:01:30.000> and<00:01:30.960> we<00:01:31.110> simply<00:01:31.439> just<00:01:31.560> need<00:01:31.770> to<00:01:31.950> align

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
here and we simply just need to align

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:38.450 
here and we simply just need to align
like<00:01:32.460> so<00:01:32.610> let's<00:01:32.790> just<00:01:33.060> start<00:01:33.659> here

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:54.450 

you'll<00:01:39.460> notice<00:01:39.990> now<00:01:48.509> lined<00:01:49.509> up<00:01:52.500> and<00:01:53.500> if<00:01:54.069> there

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
you'll notice now lined up and if there

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.550 
you'll notice now lined up and if there
we<00:01:54.579> have<00:01:54.789> it<00:01:54.909> now<00:01:55.090> I<00:01:55.810> just<00:01:56.439> turn<00:01:56.619> it<00:01:56.770> over

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
we have it now I just turn it over

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.830 
we have it now I just turn it over
you'll<00:01:59.560> be<00:01:59.649> able<00:01:59.799> to<00:01:59.920> see<00:02:00.130> here<00:02:00.689> obviously<00:02:01.689> no

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
you'll be able to see here obviously no

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.090 
you'll be able to see here obviously no
holes<00:02:02.079> or<00:02:02.710> anything<00:02:03.159> hold<00:02:03.549> in<00:02:03.819> it<00:02:03.969> and<00:02:05.100> it's

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
holes or anything hold in it and it's

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.930 
holes or anything hold in it and it's
stained<00:02:06.369> and<00:02:06.670> placed<00:02:07.149> by<00:02:07.569> its<00:02:08.019> own<00:02:08.200> magnets

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
stained and placed by its own magnets

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.020 
stained and placed by its own magnets
around<00:02:09.940> here<00:02:11.099> obviously<00:02:12.099> we<00:02:12.250> haven't<00:02:12.459> done<00:02:12.790> it

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
around here obviously we haven't done it

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.509 
around here obviously we haven't done it
wholly<00:02:13.510> alcohol<00:02:13.989> capable<00:02:14.620> cabling<00:02:15.130> and

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:15.519 
wholly alcohol capable cabling and

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:22.620 
wholly alcohol capable cabling and
that's<00:02:15.760> all<00:02:19.470> very<00:02:20.470> possible<00:02:21.220> so<00:02:22.000> here<00:02:22.329> we<00:02:22.450> have

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
that's all very possible so here we have

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:29.580 
that's all very possible so here we have
it<00:02:23.099> on<00:02:24.099> a<00:02:24.160> sheet<00:02:24.630> and<00:02:25.630> we<00:02:26.049> can<00:02:26.200> flex<00:02:26.470> it<00:02:28.230> so<00:02:29.230> now

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
it on a sheet and we can flex it so now

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.370 
it on a sheet and we can flex it so now
obviously<00:02:29.790> see<00:02:30.790> slightly<00:02:31.540> move<00:02:31.930> because

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
obviously see slightly move because

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:33.780 
obviously see slightly move because
we've<00:02:32.560> just<00:02:32.739> placed<00:02:33.010> them<00:02:33.250> on<00:02:33.370> there<00:02:33.610> and

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
we've just placed them on there and

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.720 
we've just placed them on there and
we're<00:02:33.970> twisting<00:02:34.780> the<00:02:34.900> substrate<00:02:35.470> and<00:02:35.829> it's

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
we're twisting the substrate and it's

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.330 
we're twisting the substrate and it's
not<00:02:37.299> compensating<00:02:38.019> for<00:02:38.200> us<00:02:38.319> very<00:02:38.530> thin

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
not compensating for us very thin

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.289 
not compensating for us very thin
profile<00:02:39.880> thickness<00:02:41.310> nevertheless<00:02:42.310> as<00:02:43.150> you

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:43.299 
profile thickness nevertheless as you

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:46.650 
profile thickness nevertheless as you
can<00:02:43.450> see<00:02:43.739> simply<00:02:44.739> holding<00:02:45.370> our<00:02:45.519> place<00:02:45.790> upside

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
can see simply holding our place upside

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:52.610 
can see simply holding our place upside
down<00:02:46.690> and<00:02:50.370> that's<00:02:51.370> what<00:02:51.519> we<00:02:51.639> want<00:02:51.790> to<00:02:51.880> show<00:02:52.060> you

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
down and that's what we want to show you

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.830 
down and that's what we want to show you
so<00:02:53.620> in<00:02:53.769> this<00:02:53.950> next<00:02:54.579> sequence<00:02:55.209> we<00:02:55.389> want<00:02:55.600> to<00:02:55.690> show

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
so in this next sequence we want to show

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.910 
so in this next sequence we want to show
how<00:02:56.079> mercedes-benz<00:02:56.670> use<00:02:57.670> the<00:02:58.090> LED<00:02:58.510> tiles<00:02:58.989> to

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
how mercedes-benz use the LED tiles to

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.050 
how mercedes-benz use the LED tiles to
wrap<00:03:00.790> one<00:03:01.209> side<00:03:01.660> of<00:03:01.959> a<00:03:02.260> vehicle<00:03:02.889> to<00:03:03.700> promote

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
wrap one side of a vehicle to promote

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.170 
wrap one side of a vehicle to promote
their<00:03:04.299> new<00:03:04.329> if<00:03:04.840> cell<00:03:05.350> hydrogen<00:03:06.180> technology

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
their new if cell hydrogen technology

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.590 
their new if cell hydrogen technology
and<00:03:07.389> so<00:03:08.290> as<00:03:08.620> you<00:03:09.010> can<00:03:09.130> see<00:03:09.190> if<00:03:09.700> you<00:03:10.180> feel<00:03:10.420> the

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
and so as you can see if you feel the

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.129
