00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
to lose so it I think it's a cool idea

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.400 
to lose so it I think it's a cool idea
you<00:01:00.270> guys<00:01:00.390> like<00:01:00.719> seeing<00:01:01.020> these<00:01:01.109> really

competitive<00:01:01.739> games<00:01:02.129> in<00:01:02.309> Division<00:01:02.670> one<00:01:02.699> and

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.010 
competitive games in Division one and

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.740 
competitive games in Division one and
like<00:01:05.010> I<00:01:05.129> said<00:01:05.189> division<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:05.939> division<00:01:06.360> one

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
like I said division the division one

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.780 
like I said division the division one
was<00:01:06.900> probably<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.260> most<00:01:07.380> popular<00:01:08.280> series<00:01:08.549> on

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
was probably the most popular series on

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.850 
was probably the most popular series on
my<00:01:08.970> channel<00:01:09.000> ever<00:01:09.570> in<00:01:09.840> my<00:01:09.960> in<00:01:10.110> my<00:01:10.439> channels

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
my channel ever in my in my channels

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.190 
my channel ever in my in my channels
history<00:01:11.189> so<00:01:11.640> I<00:01:11.670> wanted<00:01:11.939> to<00:01:12.000> continue<00:01:12.299> it<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:12.780> I

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
history so I wanted to continue it and I

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.990 
history so I wanted to continue it and I
think<00:01:13.500> this<00:01:13.560> is<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.830> best<00:01:13.979> way<00:01:14.250> of<00:01:14.280> doing<00:01:14.490> it

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
think this is the best way of doing it

think this is the best way of doing it
going<00:01:15.600> for<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:15.840> dominance<00:01:16.320> aspect<00:01:16.860> and

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
going for the dominance aspect and

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.700 
going for the dominance aspect and
trying<00:01:17.369> to<00:01:17.490> win<00:01:17.640> as<00:01:17.880> much<00:01:18.090> as<00:01:18.270> possible<00:01:18.439> so<00:01:19.439> in

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
anyway if it's a complete loss

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:18.470 
anyway if it's a complete loss
you're<00:03:17.610> not<00:03:17.700> gonna<00:03:17.790> learn<00:03:17.880> anything<00:03:17.970> from<00:03:18.239> it

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
you're not gonna learn anything from it

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.569

but most of the time a loss will teach

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:22.759 
but most of the time a loss will teach
you<00:03:20.730> something<00:03:20.940> new<00:03:21.090> and<00:03:21.450> that<00:03:22.170> loss<00:03:22.500> just

you something new and that loss just

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:24.319 
you something new and that loss just
taught<00:03:23.010> me<00:03:23.130> something<00:03:23.340> completely<00:03:23.940> new<00:03:23.970> which

taught me something completely new which

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:26.390 
taught me something completely new which
is<00:03:24.570> watch<00:03:25.170> out<00:03:25.380> for<00:03:25.560> build<00:03:25.739> up<00:03:25.890> play<00:03:26.040> in<00:03:26.280> the

it's the 343 or the 3421 because they
play<00:03:32.970> similar<00:03:33.359> to<00:03:34.049> those<00:03:34.200> and<00:03:34.530> this<00:03:34.709> is

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829 
play similar to those and this is

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:36.259 
play similar to those and this is
actually<00:03:34.920> my<00:03:35.160> second<00:03:35.489> penalty<00:03:35.640> of<00:03:35.910> the<00:03:36.090> game

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
actually my second penalty of the game

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:38.360 
actually my second penalty of the game
my<00:03:36.660> first<00:03:36.900> one<00:03:37.140> he<00:03:37.260> defended<00:03:37.709> beautifully<00:03:38.160> and

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
my first one he defended beautifully and

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.970 
my first one he defended beautifully and
it<00:03:38.459> was<00:03:38.549> in<00:03:38.640> a<00:03:38.700> great<00:03:38.880> location<00:03:38.940> but<00:03:39.829> we<00:03:40.829> went

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
it was in a great location but we went

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.349 
it was in a great location but we went
right<00:03:41.250> in<00:03:41.370> our<00:03:41.459> first<00:03:41.670> penalty<00:03:41.970> and<00:03:42.209> the

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:42.359 
right in our first penalty and the

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:43.699 
right in our first penalty and the
second<00:03:42.660> one<00:03:42.750> we<00:03:42.840> decided<00:03:43.200> to<00:03:43.260> go<00:03:43.350> to<00:03:43.410> the<00:03:43.530> left

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
second one we decided to go to the left

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:45.229 
second one we decided to go to the left
side<00:03:43.890> he<00:03:44.070> guessed<00:03:44.310> right<00:03:44.579> but<00:03:44.820> he<00:03:44.970> was<00:03:45.090> a

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
side he guessed right but he was a

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:48.259 
side he guessed right but he was a
little<00:03:45.570> too<00:03:45.810> late<00:03:46.280> so<00:03:47.280> we<00:03:47.850> were<00:03:47.970> doing<00:03:48.180> pretty

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
little too late so we were doing pretty

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:49.400 
little too late so we were doing pretty
well<00:03:48.390> in<00:03:48.510> this<00:03:48.630> game<00:03:48.810> actually<00:03:48.989> we<00:03:49.260> were

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
well in this game actually we were

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.229 
well in this game actually we were
definitely<00:03:49.950> controlling<00:03:50.670> it<00:03:50.790> but<00:03:50.940> in<00:03:51.090> the

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
definitely controlling it but in the

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:53.810 
definitely controlling it but in the
69th<00:03:51.780> minute<00:03:52.049> off<00:03:52.590> of<00:03:52.920> a<00:03:53.010> corner<00:03:53.549> he's<00:03:53.700> gonna

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
69th minute off of a corner he's gonna

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.550 
69th minute off of a corner he's gonna
score<00:03:54.120> one<00:03:54.299> with<00:03:54.450> Jerome<00:03:54.660> Boateng<00:03:54.840> and<00:03:55.260> that

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
score one with Jerome Boateng and that

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.080 
score one with Jerome Boateng and that
was<00:03:55.739> a<00:03:55.769> frustrating<00:03:56.549> goal<00:03:56.700> to<00:03:56.819> give<00:03:56.970> up

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
was a frustrating goal to give up

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:58.780 
was a frustrating goal to give up
because<00:03:57.269> the<00:03:57.810> goalie<00:03:58.049> was<00:03:58.109> watching<00:03:58.650> it

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
because the goalie was watching it

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:00.860 
because the goalie was watching it
obviously<00:03:59.790> if<00:03:59.880> I<00:03:59.970> pressed<00:04:00.209> why<00:04:00.420> it<00:04:00.480> wouldn't

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
obviously if I pressed why it wouldn't

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.319 
obviously if I pressed why it wouldn't
have<00:04:00.959> happened<00:04:01.319> but<00:04:02.010> you<00:04:02.670> you<00:04:02.880> would<00:04:03.030> assume

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:03.329 
have happened but you you would assume

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:04.910 
have happened but you you would assume
from<00:04:03.600> that<00:04:03.660> range<00:04:03.989> they'll<00:04:04.319> automatically

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
from that range they'll automatically

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.380 
from that range they'll automatically
come<00:04:05.250> out<00:04:05.400> for<00:04:05.700> you<00:04:05.880> and<00:04:06.030> that's<00:04:06.090> what<00:04:06.329> he

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
come out for you and that's what he

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:07.250 
come out for you and that's what he
should<00:04:06.540> have<00:04:06.569> done<00:04:06.660> but<00:04:06.840> I'm<00:04:06.959> not<00:04:07.079> going<00:04:07.200> to

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
should have done but I'm not going to

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.289

playing<00:04:45.450> extremely<00:04:46.010> extremely<00:04:47.010> offensive<00:04:47.850> at

so<00:04:51.270> it<00:04:51.330> could<00:04:51.480> have<00:04:51.510> been<00:04:51.630> worse<00:04:51.810> but<00:04:51.870> he<00:04:52.410> was

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 
so it could have been worse but he was

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.430 
so it could have been worse but he was
able<00:04:52.890> to<00:04:53.330> stop<00:04:54.330> me<00:04:54.540> from<00:04:54.720> going<00:04:55.020> on<00:04:55.260> and

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
able to stop me from going on and

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.590 
able to stop me from going on and
scoring<00:04:55.650> a<00:04:55.800> ton<00:04:56.100> so<00:04:56.340> we<00:04:56.730> start<00:04:56.970> out<00:04:57.150> two<00:04:57.450> and

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:57.600

00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 
one in Division one and hopefully we

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:00.680 
one in Division one and hopefully we
could<00:04:59.670> keep<00:04:59.790> winning<00:05:00.120> so<00:05:00.210> we<00:05:00.270> could<00:05:00.390> keep<00:05:00.510> this

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690 
could keep winning so we could keep this

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:02.330 
could keep winning so we could keep this
