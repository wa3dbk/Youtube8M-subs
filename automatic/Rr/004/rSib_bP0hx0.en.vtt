00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:11.580
 hello girls so today I 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.580
 come back with a new video for 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.700
 introduce you to a trick 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:20.220
 gold to remove the capsules so there I 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:23.250
 capsules with permanent varnish 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.070
 on it so you'll need a little 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.140
 stick like these make it the only one 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.480
 ambulance enough for all the cuticles 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.059
 but that it may very well be 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.780
 to scratch the varnish semi people 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:43.070
 so this an island to a dab so 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:46.350
 big preferably a polisher block 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:50.150
 a guillotine so to cut the 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:57.330
 capsules to make our job easier 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:01:05.580
 cottons indicating to dissolve 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:08.909
 semi- permanent varnish of aluminum paper and 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.549
 a little stick so I leave you 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.659
 watch the video 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:17.189
 so first of all i'll start with 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:18.990
 cut my capsule so that is a 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.620
 avoiding torque and my angle of course 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.620
 so we pay attention 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.770
 then we will take a big 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.630
 bankruptcy like that and we will limit the 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.170
 surface of the water so we will remove the 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.690
 part 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.210
 nothing so the code rate of the virus but 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.490
 permanent for after leads to cotton and 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:31.830
 our god him to a nail polish so that 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:33.330
 will remove more easily so we do 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.370
 reached on a power supply not too much 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.810
 the angle it will heat up and we'll have 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.530
 attacked the pulpit goes from the shade so 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:43.320
 it's not what we want then I'll 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:47.660
 cut my time to make a small 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.660
 square the size of my fingernail 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:59.020
 I'm going to bib and fund products 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:28.070
 cut a piece I'm going to cut a 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:46.070
 piece of aluminum I pose my boyfriend of my 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:50.510
 product and I have a role and the age reaches 

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:53.330
 10 minutes so a switch removal to 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:57.680
 foot him and you see that it screwed up 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:04:01.850
 so we're just scratching to remove the 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:04.090
 varnish it's not good and the remains of 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:04.090
 Bell 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:05:04.380
 then I take my blog polisher 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:05:06.000
 so peggy wise I'm going to climate and 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:09.620
 then I go to a cost of 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.620
 degreasing on the straps
