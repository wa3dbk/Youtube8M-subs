more of a rubbery material and basically

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
what that does is stops the wind

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.059 
what that does is stops the wind
penetrating<00:02:18.989> the<00:02:19.049> suit<00:02:19.290> and<00:02:19.410> making<00:02:19.739> you<00:02:19.799> cold

obviously the fundamental difference

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:25.070 
obviously the fundamental difference
between<00:02:24.060> this<00:02:24.180> suit<00:02:24.390> in<00:02:24.480> the<00:02:24.569> back<00:02:24.720> seat<00:02:24.870> is

the entry system chest zip entry system

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.390 
the entry system chest zip entry system
becoming<00:02:27.690> more<00:02:27.959> and<00:02:28.049> more<00:02:28.170> popular<00:02:28.400> with

people that want more flexibility from a
wetsuit<00:02:31.519> basically<00:02:32.519> the<00:02:32.819> chest<00:02:33.090> zip<00:02:33.180> system

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599 
wetsuit basically the chest zip system

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:35.180 
wetsuit basically the chest zip system
against<00:02:33.989> the<00:02:34.170> reason<00:02:34.470> to<00:02:34.560> have<00:02:34.680> as<00:02:34.799> if<00:02:34.980> is<00:02:35.099> it

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
against the reason to have as if is it

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.770 
against the reason to have as if is it
on<00:02:35.310> the<00:02:35.400> back<00:02:35.549> which<00:02:36.090> then<00:02:36.330> gives<00:02:36.510> you<00:02:36.629> more

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
flexibility in the back of the suit

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:39.890 
flexibility in the back of the suit
which<00:02:38.580> is<00:02:38.730> especially<00:02:39.269> useful<00:02:39.450> when<00:02:39.690> you're

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
which is especially useful when you're

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.020 
which is especially useful when you're
paddling<00:02:40.079> okay<00:02:40.860> so<00:02:40.920> frees<00:02:41.370> up<00:02:41.549> the<00:02:41.579> back<00:02:41.790> panel

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
paddling okay so frees up the back panel

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.000 
paddling okay so frees up the back panel
there<00:02:42.299> so<00:02:42.930> so<00:02:43.200> quite<00:02:43.500> good<00:02:43.650> at<00:02:43.739> keeping<00:02:43.829> out

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
there so so quite good at keeping out

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.380 
there so so quite good at keeping out
water<00:02:44.220> because<00:02:44.700> you've<00:02:44.819> got<00:02:44.970> an<00:02:45.060> unbroken

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
water because you've got an unbroken

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.900 
water because you've got an unbroken
seam<00:02:45.870> around<00:02:46.049> the<00:02:46.290> collar<00:02:46.670> whereas<00:02:47.670> you<00:02:47.760> do

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
seam around the collar whereas you do

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.400 
seam around the collar whereas you do
with<00:02:48.120> the<00:02:48.180> back<00:02:48.299> zip<00:02:48.480> obviously<00:02:48.840> it<00:02:48.900> breaks<00:02:49.170> it

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
with the back zip obviously it breaks it

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:50.930 
with the back zip obviously it breaks it
and<00:02:49.560> although<00:02:49.769> the<00:02:49.980> velcro<00:02:50.129> systems<00:02:50.670> are<00:02:50.790> very

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
and although the velcro systems are very

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.729 
and although the velcro systems are very
good<00:02:51.239> sort<00:02:51.780> of<00:02:51.810> creating<00:02:52.170> a<00:02:52.230> good<00:02:52.379> seal<00:02:52.590> around

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
good sort of creating a good seal around

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.740 
good sort of creating a good seal around
the<00:02:52.890> neck<00:02:53.069> obviously<00:02:53.879> and<00:02:54.180> in<00:02:54.329> one<00:02:54.510> piece

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
the neck obviously and in one piece

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:55.970 
the neck obviously and in one piece
isn't<00:02:55.049> it's<00:02:55.410> going<00:02:55.560> to<00:02:55.620> make<00:02:55.709> it<00:02:55.860> more

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
isn't it's going to make it more

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.009 
isn't it's going to make it more

essentially<00:03:02.010> sewn<00:03:02.250> over<00:03:02.579> the<00:03:02.670> inside<00:03:02.970> of<00:03:03.030> the

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
essentially sewn over the inside of the

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.650 
essentially sewn over the inside of the
wetsuit<00:03:03.510> and<00:03:04.040> what<00:03:05.040> you<00:03:05.160> get<00:03:05.340> this<00:03:06.299> panel

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
wetsuit and what you get this panel

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.319 
wetsuit and what you get this panel
attached<00:03:07.349> on<00:03:07.530> the<00:03:07.620> back<00:03:07.769> here<00:03:08.000> the<00:03:09.000> inside<00:03:09.299> of

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:09.329 
attached on the back here the inside of

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:11.569 
attached on the back here the inside of
the<00:03:09.480> suit<00:03:09.690> is<00:03:09.840> brought<00:03:10.019> up<00:03:10.170> nice<00:03:10.410> and<00:03:10.440> high<00:03:10.680> so

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:11.579 
the suit is brought up nice and high so

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:14.660 
the suit is brought up nice and high so
that<00:03:11.910> when<00:03:12.239> this<00:03:12.450> is<00:03:12.660> pulled<00:03:12.900> up<00:03:13.049> over<00:03:13.670> it

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
that when this is pulled up over it

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.759 
that when this is pulled up over it
creates<00:03:15.000> a<00:03:15.090> seam<00:03:15.329> around<00:03:15.540> assian<00:03:16.290> around<00:03:16.560> here

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
creates a seam around assian around here

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:19.009 
creates a seam around assian around here
so<00:03:16.980> no<00:03:17.099> water<00:03:17.310> can<00:03:17.579> get<00:03:17.730> through<00:03:17.790> then<00:03:18.720> the<00:03:18.750> zip

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
so no water can get through then the zip

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:21.020 
so no water can get through then the zip
comes<00:03:19.260> across<00:03:19.470> the<00:03:19.709> front<00:03:19.950> and<00:03:20.370> clips<00:03:20.760> down

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
comes across the front and clips down

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.150 
comes across the front and clips down
and<00:03:21.299> so<00:03:21.810> basically<00:03:21.959> any<00:03:22.440> water<00:03:22.739> is<00:03:22.919> not<00:03:23.040> going

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
and so basically any water is not going

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.530 
and so basically any water is not going
to<00:03:23.220> come<00:03:23.400> up<00:03:23.519> through<00:03:23.730> here<00:03:23.910> into<00:03:24.090> the<00:03:24.329> collar

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
to come up through here into the collar

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.349 
to come up through here into the collar
and<00:03:24.810> any<00:03:25.500> water<00:03:25.709> that<00:03:25.889> does<00:03:26.160> come<00:03:26.430> through<00:03:26.760> is

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:27.359 
and any water that does come through is

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:28.759 
and any water that does come through is
met<00:03:27.660> with<00:03:27.750> these<00:03:27.930> panels<00:03:28.349> which<00:03:28.500> are<00:03:28.590> brought

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
met with these panels which are brought

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:30.830 
met with these panels which are brought
up<00:03:28.889> nice<00:03:29.069> and<00:03:29.099> high<00:03:29.310> and<00:03:29.639> then<00:03:30.150> drain<00:03:30.480> down<00:03:30.660> the

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
up nice and high and then drain down the

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.589 
up nice and high and then drain down the
side<00:03:31.049> of<00:03:31.319> the<00:03:32.030> side<00:03:33.030> of<00:03:33.060> the<00:03:33.239> chest<00:03:33.419> tube

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:33.599 
side of the side of the chest tube

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:35.390 
side of the side of the chest tube
system<00:03:33.959> here<00:03:34.169> or<00:03:34.319> through<00:03:34.829> the<00:03:34.980> drain<00:03:35.160> holes

system here or through the drain holes

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.819 
system here or through the drain holes
on<00:03:35.579> the<00:03:35.639> front<00:03:35.849> there<00:03:36.440> they<00:03:37.440> dip<00:03:37.650> this

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:37.829 
on the front there they dip this

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:39.349 
on the front there they dip this
sentiment<00:03:38.459> sense<00:03:38.669> reception<00:03:39.120> around<00:03:39.209> the

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:39.359 
sentiment sense reception around the

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:40.520 
sentiment sense reception around the
back<00:03:39.510> as<00:03:39.690> well<00:03:39.720> just<00:03:40.109> to<00:03:40.200> give<00:03:40.319> you<00:03:40.410> more

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
back as well just to give you more

back as well just to give you more
flexibility<00:03:41.190> in<00:03:41.489> the<00:03:41.880> back<00:03:42.060> there<00:03:42.299> as<00:03:42.450> well<00:03:42.630> so

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:43.169 
flexibility in the back there as well so

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:44.569 
flexibility in the back there as well so

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579 
you give lots of stretch properties in

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:46.460 
you give lots of stretch properties in
the<00:03:44.639> back<00:03:44.790> there<00:03:44.970> bring<00:03:45.930> this<00:03:46.019> up<00:03:46.169> and<00:03:46.290> over

the back there bring this up and over
the<00:03:46.560> head<00:03:46.590> a<00:03:47.040> lot<00:03:47.970> of<00:03:48.000> people<00:03:48.150> have<00:03:48.480> sort<00:03:49.230> of

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:49.319 
the head a lot of people have sort of

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:50.720 
the head a lot of people have sort of
reservations<00:03:49.859> with<00:03:50.010> chess<00:03:50.220> it's<00:03:50.459> because

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
reservations with chess it's because

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.909 
reservations with chess it's because
they're<00:03:50.880> harder<00:03:51.269> to<00:03:51.480> get<00:03:51.630> on<00:03:51.780> and<00:03:51.930> off<00:03:52.019> having

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:52.919 
they're harder to get on and off having

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:54.620 
they're harder to get on and off having
said<00:03:53.099> that<00:03:53.130> with<00:03:53.940> this<00:03:54.030> particular<00:03:54.329> system

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
said that with this particular system

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.390 
said that with this particular system
because<00:03:55.109> it's<00:03:55.260> only<00:03:55.769> locked<00:03:55.950> on<00:03:56.130> the<00:03:56.220> back

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
because it's only locked on the back

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.339 
because it's only locked on the back
that<00:03:56.430> allows<00:03:56.910> you<00:03:57.090> to<00:03:57.150> open<00:03:57.690> up<00:03:58.019> the<00:03:58.139> suit

that allows you to open up the suit

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:00.770 
that allows you to open up the suit
really<00:03:58.859> really<00:03:59.010> wide<00:03:59.250> again<00:03:59.579> and<00:03:59.910> so

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
really really wide again and so

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.140 
really really wide again and so
effectively<00:04:01.440> but<00:04:01.859> a<00:04:01.889> nice<00:04:02.040> big<00:04:02.310> emphasis

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
effectively but a nice big emphasis

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.990 
effectively but a nice big emphasis
they're<00:04:03.409> what<00:04:04.409> you<00:04:04.650> can<00:04:04.829> do<00:04:05.040> as<00:04:05.159> well<00:04:05.340> you<00:04:05.849> can

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
they're what you can do as well you can

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.690 
they're what you can do as well you can
turn<00:04:06.209> the<00:04:06.329> suit<00:04:06.540> inside<00:04:06.989> out<00:04:07.200> halfway<00:04:08.040> down<00:04:08.400> so

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
turn the suit inside out halfway down so

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.009 
turn the suit inside out halfway down so
you<00:04:08.790> can<00:04:08.879> just<00:04:08.909> slip<00:04:09.269> it<00:04:09.390> on<00:04:09.510> like<00:04:09.659> a<00:04:09.689> pair<00:04:09.930> of
