00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:03.070 
middle and what you do is you dragged
down<00:05:01.250> the<00:05:01.280> black<00:05:01.790> ace<00:05:02.060> which<00:05:02.660> is<00:05:02.780> the<00:05:02.870> gimmick

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080 
down the black ace which is the gimmick

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.070 
down the black ace which is the gimmick
and<00:05:03.440> then<00:05:03.890> just<00:05:04.100> pulling<00:05:04.490> up<00:05:04.610> the<00:05:04.850> ace<00:05:05.080> which

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080 
and then just pulling up the ace which

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.380 
and then just pulling up the ace which
comes<00:05:06.380> out<00:05:06.560> from<00:05:06.770> here<00:05:07.040> so<00:05:07.700> technically

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:08.390 
comes out from here so technically

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:09.850 
comes out from here so technically
you're<00:05:08.690> not<00:05:08.780> putting<00:05:09.080> the<00:05:09.230> black<00:05:09.440> case<00:05:09.650> down

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:09.860 
you're not putting the black case down

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.370 
you're not putting the black case down
on<00:05:10.010> the<00:05:10.130> table<00:05:10.310> or<00:05:10.580> the<00:05:10.640> flow<00:05:11.110> I'm<00:05:12.110> actually

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:12.380 
on the table or the flow I'm actually

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:14.230 
on the table or the flow I'm actually
putting<00:05:12.650> the<00:05:12.860> red<00:05:13.040> edge<00:05:13.220> which<00:05:13.580> is<00:05:13.700> behind<00:05:13.880> it

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:14.240 
putting the red edge which is behind it

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.030 
putting the red edge which is behind it
that's<00:05:14.570> why<00:05:14.870> you're<00:05:15.140> supposed<00:05:15.350> to<00:05:15.680> alternate

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:16.040 
that's why you're supposed to alternate

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:19.930 
that's why you're supposed to alternate
the<00:05:16.070> colors<00:05:16.690> so<00:05:17.830> the<00:05:18.830> black<00:05:19.070> is<00:05:19.340> I'm<00:05:19.670> gonna<00:05:19.760> put
