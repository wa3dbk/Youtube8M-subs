I'm using a Sonia Kashuk 1/16 brush and

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.430 
I'm using a Sonia Kashuk 1/16 brush and
I'm<00:02:19.209> just<00:02:19.450> going<00:02:19.690> to<00:02:19.989> Pat<00:02:20.799> it<00:02:21.599> kind<00:02:22.599> of<00:02:22.750> onto

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
I'm just going to Pat it kind of onto

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.530 
I'm just going to Pat it kind of onto
the<00:02:23.560> outer<00:02:23.769> third<00:02:24.459> of<00:02:24.519> the<00:02:24.700> eye<00:02:27.239> just<00:02:28.239> kind<00:02:28.480> of

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
the outer third of the eye just kind of

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.240 
the outer third of the eye just kind of
lightly<00:02:28.810> diffusing<00:02:29.410> it<00:02:29.500> towards<00:02:29.799> the<00:02:29.860> center

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
lightly diffusing it towards the center

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.850 
lightly diffusing it towards the center
so<00:02:31.049> basically<00:02:32.049> you<00:02:32.200> want<00:02:32.349> to<00:02:32.410> apply<00:02:32.650> your

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.430 
so basically you want to apply your
brush<00:02:33.099> where<00:02:33.489> you<00:02:33.580> want<00:02:33.760> the<00:02:34.060> most<00:02:34.440> product

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
brush where you want the most product

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.250 
brush where you want the most product

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
and then blend it in words instead of

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.199 
and then blend it in words instead of
you<00:02:38.349> know<00:02:38.379> like<00:02:38.620> placing<00:02:39.040> it<00:02:39.160> right<00:02:39.579> here<00:02:40.060> and

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
you know like placing it right here and

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:41.699 
you know like placing it right here and
then<00:02:40.450> you'll<00:02:40.569> have<00:02:40.720> the<00:02:40.870> most<00:02:41.049> deposit<00:02:41.590> right

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
then you'll have the most deposit right

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:43.530 
then you'll have the most deposit right
there<00:02:41.980> place<00:02:42.760> it<00:02:42.879> more<00:02:43.030> towards<00:02:43.299> the<00:02:43.329> outer

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
there place it more towards the outer

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.410 
there place it more towards the outer
corner<00:02:43.629> of<00:02:43.959> the<00:02:44.049> eye<00:02:44.079> and<00:02:44.640> then<00:02:45.640> start<00:02:45.970> to<00:02:46.180> kind

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
corner of the eye and then start to kind

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.210 
corner of the eye and then start to kind
of<00:02:46.480> work<00:02:46.750> inwards<00:02:47.230> when<00:02:47.470> your<00:02:47.650> brush<00:02:47.920> has<00:02:48.190> a

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
of work inwards when your brush has a

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.059 
of work inwards when your brush has a
little<00:02:48.430> bit<00:02:48.489> less<00:02:48.640> product<00:02:49.120> on<00:02:49.239> it<00:02:49.390> and<00:02:50.069> then

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:51.069 
little bit less product on it and then

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:52.589 
little bit less product on it and then
I'm<00:02:51.160> also<00:02:51.340> going<00:02:51.579> to<00:02:51.670> place<00:02:51.819> this<00:02:52.060> on<00:02:52.299> the
