00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
choose to approach this D load week a

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.330 
choose to approach this D load week a
little<00:00:29.939> bit<00:00:30.029> differently<00:00:30.449> and<00:00:31.009> I've<00:00:32.009> done

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
little bit differently and I've done

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.520 
little bit differently and I've done
basically<00:00:32.790> having<00:00:33.210> some<00:00:33.630> odd<00:00:33.840> pains<00:00:34.230> and

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
basically having some odd pains and

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:35.810 
basically having some odd pains and
issues<00:00:34.920> that<00:00:34.950> I<00:00:35.219> haven't<00:00:35.430> had<00:00:35.579> in<00:00:35.670> a<00:00:35.790> really

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
issues that I haven't had in a really

issues that I haven't had in a really
long<00:00:36.090> time<00:00:36.300> and<00:00:36.989> I<00:00:37.469> think<00:00:37.739> this<00:00:38.340> is<00:00:38.399> partially

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
long time and I think this is partially

long time and I think this is partially
just<00:00:39.329> student<00:00:39.809> finishing<00:00:40.500> up<00:00:40.649> school<00:00:40.829> and<00:00:41.010> not

really taking the time to take care of
my<00:00:43.110> body<00:00:43.290> like<00:00:43.649> I<00:00:43.890> normally<00:00:44.010> do<00:00:44.640> so<00:00:45.329> I<00:00:45.360> haven't

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
to address this I musical to step back

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.730 
to address this I musical to step back
and<00:01:32.460> look<00:01:33.390> at<00:01:33.630> what<00:01:33.660> my<00:01:33.930> workouts<00:01:34.410> and<00:01:34.590> then

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
and look at what my workouts and then

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.590 
and look at what my workouts and then
like<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.070> past<00:01:35.310> month<00:01:35.610> and<00:01:35.759> everything<00:01:36.450> else

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
like the past month and everything else

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.330 
like the past month and everything else
and<00:01:36.780> basically<00:01:37.140> tried<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.560> pinpoint<00:01:37.800> what's

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
and basically tried to pinpoint what's

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.630 
and basically tried to pinpoint what's
changed<00:01:38.970> because<00:01:39.890> my<00:01:40.890> shoulder<00:01:41.250> theme<00:01:41.460> was

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
changed because my shoulder theme was

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.670 
changed because my shoulder theme was
very<00:01:41.880> sudden<00:01:42.210> and<00:01:42.570> there's<00:01:43.170> got<00:01:43.410> to<00:01:43.560> be<00:01:43.590> a

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
very sudden and there's got to be a

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.490 
very sudden and there's got to be a
specific<00:01:44.250> cause<00:01:44.430> for<00:01:44.850> it<00:01:44.970> so<00:01:45.270> my<00:01:45.930> best<00:01:46.229> guess

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
specific cause for it so my best guess

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.889 
specific cause for it so my best guess
at<00:01:46.710> this<00:01:46.800> point<00:01:46.860> it's<00:01:47.460> actually<00:01:48.030> roller<00:01:48.450> squad

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
at this point it's actually roller squad

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.040 
at this point it's actually roller squad
was<00:01:49.289> causing<00:01:49.740> my<00:01:49.890> pain<00:01:50.130> so<00:01:50.970> if<00:01:51.780> you<00:01:51.960> guys

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.050 
was causing my pain so if you guys

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.620 
was causing my pain so if you guys
happen<00:01:52.500> to<00:01:52.680> notice<00:01:52.920> in<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.460> first<00:01:53.729> two<00:01:54.300> Clips

would like to point out my butt wink by
the<00:02:02.729> way<00:02:02.970> I'm<00:02:03.090> trying<00:02:03.300> to<00:02:03.420> fix<00:02:03.600> that<00:02:03.780> as<00:02:03.930> well

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
the way I'm trying to fix that as well

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.800 
the way I'm trying to fix that as well
but<00:02:04.320> anyhow<00:02:04.740> I<00:02:05.070> switched<00:02:05.850> back<00:02:06.090> to<00:02:06.119> high<00:02:06.539> bar

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
but anyhow I switched back to high bar

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.770 
but anyhow I switched back to high bar
to<00:02:07.170> kind<00:02:08.160> of<00:02:08.250> try<00:02:08.519> to<00:02:08.580> see<00:02:08.880> if<00:02:09.000> that<00:02:09.179> alleviates

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
to kind of try to see if that alleviates

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.320 
to kind of try to see if that alleviates
most<00:02:10.019> my<00:02:10.259> shoulder<00:02:10.649> pain<00:02:10.920> and<00:02:11.190> on<00:02:11.850> top<00:02:12.090> of<00:02:12.150> that

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
most my shoulder pain and on top of that

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.680 
most my shoulder pain and on top of that
I<00:02:12.660> added<00:02:13.200> my<00:02:13.350> old<00:02:13.560> physical<00:02:14.130> therapy

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
I added my old physical therapy

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.000 
I added my old physical therapy
exercises<00:02:15.690> for<00:02:16.110> my<00:02:16.230> shoulders<00:02:16.620> to<00:02:16.830> hopefully

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
exercises for my shoulders to hopefully

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.800 
exercises for my shoulders to hopefully
tighten<00:02:17.549> them<00:02:17.640> up<00:02:17.760> and<00:02:18.000> that's<00:02:18.150> mostly<00:02:18.480> band

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
tighten them up and that's mostly band

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.039 
tighten them up and that's mostly band
work<00:02:19.549> it<00:02:20.549> really<00:02:20.790> sucks<00:02:21.209> in<00:02:21.390> a<00:02:21.450> way<00:02:21.480> having<00:02:21.930> to

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:22.049 
work it really sucks in a way having to

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:23.990 
work it really sucks in a way having to
go<00:02:22.170> back<00:02:22.200> to<00:02:22.560> those<00:02:22.709> exercises<00:02:23.430> but<00:02:23.850> the

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
go back to those exercises but the

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.449 
go back to those exercises but the
reality<00:02:24.480> is<00:02:24.510> it's<00:02:25.350> really<00:02:25.739> important<00:02:26.400> to

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
reality is it's really important to

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:29.330 
reality is it's really important to
address<00:02:26.760> the<00:02:27.030> most<00:02:27.269> basic<00:02:27.570> issues<00:02:28.230> first<00:02:28.590> this

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
address the most basic issues first this

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.340 
address the most basic issues first this
week<00:02:29.549> I<00:02:29.700> really<00:02:30.000> had<00:02:30.150> to<00:02:30.180> remind<00:02:30.540> myself<00:02:30.690> why

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
week I really had to remind myself why

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.020 
week I really had to remind myself why
am<00:02:31.380> I<00:02:31.590> even<00:02:31.620> doing<00:02:31.769> this<00:02:32.160> lime<00:02:32.489> in<00:02:32.700> the<00:02:32.820> gym

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
am I even doing this lime in the gym

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.470 
am I even doing this lime in the gym
what<00:02:33.900> my<00:02:34.049> personal<00:02:34.530> goals<00:02:34.799> are<00:02:35.160> and<00:02:35.459> for<00:02:36.299> me

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
what my personal goals are and for me

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.420 
what my personal goals are and for me
it's<00:02:36.630> just<00:02:36.870> to<00:02:36.989> keep<00:02:37.110> my<00:02:37.290> body<00:02:37.530> strong<00:02:38.160> and

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
it's just to keep my body strong and

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.750 
it's just to keep my body strong and
healthy<00:02:38.910> so<00:02:39.690> the<00:02:40.290> reality<00:02:40.530> is<00:02:40.920> these<00:02:41.220> basic

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
healthy so the reality is these basic

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.940 
healthy so the reality is these basic
things<00:02:41.790> for<00:02:42.510> me<00:02:42.660> and<00:02:42.810> probably<00:02:43.110> most<00:02:43.620> of<00:02:43.890> you

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
things for me and probably most of you

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.460 
things for me and probably most of you
that<00:02:44.820> may<00:02:45.030> be<00:02:45.090> tempting<00:02:45.720> to<00:02:45.750> not<00:02:45.870> address

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
that may be tempting to not address

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.530 
that may be tempting to not address
because<00:02:46.920> they<00:02:47.100> are<00:02:47.280> so<00:02:47.549> simple<00:02:47.850> or<00:02:48.299> maybe

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
because they are so simple or maybe

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.770 
because they are so simple or maybe
embarrassing<00:02:49.260> for<00:02:49.500> you<00:02:49.620> to<00:02:50.090> step<00:02:51.090> back<00:02:51.150> and<00:02:51.600> do

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
embarrassing for you to step back and do

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.690 
embarrassing for you to step back and do
maybe<00:02:52.079> because<00:02:52.530> it's<00:02:52.890> a<00:02:53.010> very<00:02:53.040> light<00:02:53.489> weight

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
maybe because it's a very light weight

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.930 
maybe because it's a very light weight
or<00:02:54.120> just<00:02:54.660> very<00:02:54.870> simple<00:02:55.320> are<00:02:56.070> the<00:02:56.400> things<00:02:56.730> that

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
or just very simple are the things that

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.460 
or just very simple are the things that
can<00:02:57.180> make<00:02:57.239> the<00:02:57.480> difference<00:02:57.510> between<00:02:58.290> you

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
can make the difference between you

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.620 
can make the difference between you
being<00:02:58.500> successful<00:02:59.459> in<00:02:59.640> your<00:02:59.880> personal<00:03:00.420> and

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
spine I've been doing them multiple

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.030 
spine I've been doing them multiple
times<00:03:09.209> a<00:03:09.600> day<00:03:09.630> and<00:03:09.989> resetting<00:03:10.620> my<00:03:10.739> spine

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
times a day and resetting my spine

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.850 
times a day and resetting my spine
basically<00:03:11.610> every<00:03:12.030> time<00:03:12.350> anyhow<00:03:13.350> though<00:03:13.590> I

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
basically every time anyhow though I

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.879 
basically every time anyhow though I
know<00:03:14.370> these<00:03:14.940> are<00:03:15.180> really<00:03:15.449> basic<00:03:16.260> silly<00:03:16.560> things

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:16.889 
know these are really basic silly things

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:19.640 
know these are really basic silly things
and<00:03:17.160> they<00:03:17.220> do<00:03:17.280> take<00:03:17.699> time<00:03:17.780> but<00:03:18.780> I<00:03:19.019> think<00:03:19.470> a<00:03:19.620> lot

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
and they do take time but I think a lot

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.800 
and they do take time but I think a lot
of<00:03:19.889> people<00:03:20.070> neglect<00:03:20.639> this<00:03:21.030> we<00:03:21.299> have<00:03:21.480> a<00:03:21.510> lot

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
of people neglect this we have a lot

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.349 
of people neglect this we have a lot
better<00:03:21.959> performance<00:03:22.709> as<00:03:23.130> kind<00:03:23.790> of<00:03:23.880> remind<00:03:24.239> you

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:24.359 
better performance as kind of remind you

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:26.300 
better performance as kind of remind you
of<00:03:24.419> how<00:03:24.660> important<00:03:25.169> they<00:03:25.260> were<00:03:25.410> just<00:03:25.709> from

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
of how important they were just from

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.000 
of how important they were just from
high<00:03:26.639> fell<00:03:27.090> after<00:03:27.449> a<00:03:27.660> couple<00:03:27.930> weeks<00:03:28.199> not<00:03:28.650> doing

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
high fell after a couple weeks not doing

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.890 
high fell after a couple weeks not doing
these<00:03:29.160> types<00:03:29.459> of<00:03:29.609> things<00:03:29.690> like<00:03:30.690> I've

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
these types of things like I've

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.400 
these types of things like I've
literally<00:03:31.799> been<00:03:31.949> getting<00:03:32.370> hip<00:03:32.579> spasms

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410

literally been getting hip spasms
probably<00:03:34.410> two<00:03:34.980> to<00:03:35.190> three<00:03:35.220> times<00:03:35.430> and

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
probably two to three times and

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.599 
probably two to three times and
consistently<00:03:36.930> and<00:03:37.680> since<00:03:37.949> I<00:03:38.070> spend<00:03:38.340> it<00:03:38.430> all

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:38.609 
consistently and since I spend it all

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:40.460 
consistently and since I spend it all
this<00:03:38.820> stuff<00:03:39.060> a<00:03:39.090> couple<00:03:39.269> days<00:03:39.570> ago<00:03:39.600> those<00:03:40.169> are

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
this stuff a couple days ago those are

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.500

pretty<00:03:40.739> much<00:03:40.980> went<00:03:41.190> away<00:03:41.250> so<00:03:42.000> the<00:03:42.150> moral<00:03:42.389> of

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
pretty much went away so the moral of

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.629 
pretty much went away so the moral of
this<00:03:42.690> workout<00:03:43.109> vlog<00:03:43.470> basically<00:03:44.130> is<00:03:44.250> don't
