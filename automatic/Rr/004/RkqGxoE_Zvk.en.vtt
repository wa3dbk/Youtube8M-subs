then<00:02:57.700> at<00:02:58.000> that<00:02:58.120> point<00:02:58.180> you<00:02:58.990> know<00:02:59.080> you<00:02:59.410> either

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
then at that point you know you either

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.920 
then at that point you know you either
would<00:02:59.770> do<00:02:59.980> two<00:03:00.310> bars<00:03:00.520> one<00:03:00.850> again<00:03:01.120> or<00:03:01.390> have<00:03:01.750> the

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
would do two bars one again or have the

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.240 
would do two bars one again or have the
turnaround<00:03:02.410> in<00:03:02.560> this<00:03:02.650> case<00:03:02.860> we're<00:03:03.100> going<00:03:03.190> to

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
turnaround in this case we're going to

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.030 
turnaround in this case we're going to
have<00:03:03.310> a<00:03:03.430> turnaround<00:03:04.110> alright<00:03:05.110> so<00:03:05.440> for<00:03:05.860> the

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
have a turnaround alright so for the

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:19.610 
have a turnaround alright so for the
first<00:03:06.250> four<00:03:06.700> bars<00:03:06.880> of<00:03:07.060> the<00:03:07.300> one<00:03:07.480> chord

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.570 

right<00:03:20.620> now<00:03:20.800> we're<00:03:20.920> ready<00:03:21.069> to<00:03:21.159> move<00:03:21.280> to<00:03:21.340> the

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:21.580 
right now we're ready to move to the

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.539 
right now we're ready to move to the
four<00:03:21.790> chord<00:03:22.090> which<00:03:22.269> is<00:03:22.300> a<00:03:22.980> now<00:03:23.980> this<00:03:24.159> is<00:03:24.310> really

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:24.549 
four chord which is a now this is really

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:26.250 
four chord which is a now this is really
easy<00:03:24.580> all<00:03:25.060> you<00:03:25.090> do<00:03:25.450> is<00:03:25.780> you<00:03:25.900> just<00:03:26.080> move<00:03:26.230> your

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
easy all you do is you just move your

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.250 
easy all you do is you just move your
first<00:03:26.620> finger<00:03:27.010> from<00:03:27.250> the<00:03:27.400> fifth<00:03:27.700> string<00:03:28.260> to

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
first finger from the fifth string to

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.440 
first finger from the fifth string to
the<00:03:29.620> fourth<00:03:29.860> string<00:03:30.190> and<00:03:30.430> you<00:03:30.549> play<00:03:30.760> the<00:03:30.909> exact

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
the fourth string and you play the exact

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.930 
the fourth string and you play the exact
same<00:03:31.780> frets<00:03:32.590> but<00:03:32.950> now<00:03:33.129> you're<00:03:33.370> doing<00:03:33.400> it<00:03:33.730> based

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
same frets but now you're doing it based

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:35.460 
same frets but now you're doing it based
on<00:03:34.209> the<00:03:34.360> fifth<00:03:34.629> and<00:03:34.870> the<00:03:34.930> fourth<00:03:35.170> string

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
on the fifth and the fourth string

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:36.990 
on the fifth and the fourth string
instead<00:03:35.799> of<00:03:35.890> the<00:03:35.950> sixth<00:03:36.400> in<00:03:36.640> the<00:03:36.760> fourth

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
instead of the sixth in the fourth

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.199 
instead of the sixth in the fourth
string<00:03:37.290> so<00:03:41.519> just<00:03:42.519> like<00:03:42.700> that<00:03:42.730> it's<00:03:43.060> one

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.209 
string so just like that it's one

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:45.240 
string so just like that it's one
measure<00:03:43.450> so<00:03:43.690> we're<00:03:43.780> gonna<00:03:43.870> do<00:03:44.019> that<00:03:44.140> twice<00:03:44.379> for

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
measure so we're gonna do that twice for

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:51.910 
measure so we're gonna do that twice for
the<00:03:45.340> two<00:03:45.489> bars<00:03:45.700> of<00:03:45.910> four

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.760 

and<00:03:52.430> then<00:03:53.090> we're<00:03:53.240> going<00:03:53.390> to<00:03:53.480> move<00:03:53.630> back<00:03:53.740> to<00:03:54.740> our

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:54.770 
and then we're going to move back to our

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:56.800 
and then we're going to move back to our
original<00:03:55.010> position<00:03:55.700> for<00:03:55.940> two<00:03:56.150> more<00:03:56.330> bars<00:03:56.569> of

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
original position for two more bars of

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:03.960 
original position for two more bars of
one

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:08.290 

all<00:04:04.970> right<00:04:05.180> so<00:04:06.040> from<00:04:07.040> there<00:04:07.310> we're<00:04:07.790> going<00:04:08.000> to

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:08.300 
all right so from there we're going to

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:11.080 
all right so from there we're going to
go<00:04:08.450> to<00:04:08.510> the<00:04:08.870> five<00:04:09.110> chord<00:04:09.500> which<00:04:09.740> is<00:04:09.920> B<00:04:10.220> and<00:04:10.520> this

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 
go to the five chord which is B and this

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.810 
go to the five chord which is B and this
is<00:04:11.150> where<00:04:11.420> things<00:04:12.070> change<00:04:13.070> up<00:04:13.340> a<00:04:13.460> little<00:04:13.640> bit

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:13.820 
is where things change up a little bit

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:16.350 
is where things change up a little bit
it<00:04:13.940> gets<00:04:14.030> slightly<00:04:14.570> more<00:04:14.780> complicated<00:04:15.680> so

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:16.360 
it gets slightly more complicated so

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:20.350 
it gets slightly more complicated so
first<00:04:17.360> finger<00:04:17.720> is<00:04:17.960> on<00:04:18.290> the<00:04:18.790> the<00:04:19.790> second<00:04:20.210> fret

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:20.360 
first finger is on the the second fret

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:22.120 
first finger is on the the second fret
of<00:04:20.450> the<00:04:20.480> fifth<00:04:20.750> string<00:04:20.840> and<00:04:21.140> our<00:04:21.530> third<00:04:21.739> finger

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.130 
of the fifth string and our third finger

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:23.620 
of the fifth string and our third finger
is<00:04:22.160> on<00:04:22.400> the<00:04:22.460> fourth<00:04:22.910> fret<00:04:23.180> of<00:04:23.240> the<00:04:23.360> fourth

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
is on the fourth fret of the fourth

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:27.570 
is on the fourth fret of the fourth
string<00:04:24.130> so

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.580 

now<00:04:28.120> we're<00:04:28.240> gonna<00:04:28.330> take<00:04:28.539> your<00:04:28.690> fourth<00:04:29.080> finger

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
now we're gonna take your fourth finger

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:32.610 
now we're gonna take your fourth finger
and<00:04:29.710> move<00:04:30.370> it<00:04:30.580> to<00:04:30.970> the<00:04:31.569> fifth<00:04:31.990> fret<00:04:32.229> of<00:04:32.590> the

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
and move it to the fifth fret of the

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:38.909 
and move it to the fifth fret of the
fifth<00:04:33.009> string<00:04:34.199> and<00:04:37.229> then<00:04:38.229> slide<00:04:38.530> that<00:04:38.680> up<00:04:38.830> a

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:38.919 
fifth string and then slide that up a

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:45.360 
fifth string and then slide that up a
half-step<00:04:39.180> so<00:04:43.590> then<00:04:44.590> you<00:04:44.740> take<00:04:44.889> your<00:04:45.099> first

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370

finger<00:04:45.520> and<00:04:46.360> you<00:04:46.479> bar<00:04:46.750> it<00:04:46.930> across<00:04:47.319> the<00:04:47.800> fourth

00:04:48.089 --> 00:04:48.099 
finger and you bar it across the fourth

00:04:48.099 --> 00:04:57.990 
finger and you bar it across the fourth
and<00:04:48.370> third<00:04:48.580> string<00:04:49.000> on<00:04:49.150> the<00:04:49.419> 4th<00:04:49.629> fret<00:04:57.000> then

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:10.260 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.890 

that's<00:05:11.260> one<00:05:11.980> bar<00:05:12.700> of<00:05:13.150> five<00:05:13.390> now<00:05:13.660> we're<00:05:13.810> gonna

00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:21.199 

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:23.050 

and<00:05:21.680> then<00:05:21.919> back<00:05:22.219> to<00:05:22.460> the<00:05:22.580> original<00:05:22.610> position

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:23.060 
and then back to the original position

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:26.769 
and then back to the original position
of<00:05:23.560> that<00:05:24.909> first<00:05:25.909> finger<00:05:26.120> on<00:05:26.300> the<00:05:26.389> second<00:05:26.749> fret

00:05:26.769 --> 00:05:26.779 
of that first finger on the second fret

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:28.209 
of that first finger on the second fret
of<00:05:26.900> the<00:05:26.990> fifth<00:05:27.229> string<00:05:27.289> and<00:05:27.710> you're<00:05:28.069> going<00:05:28.189> to

00:05:28.209 --> 00:05:28.219 
of the fifth string and you're going to

00:05:28.219 --> 00:05:38.710 
of the fifth string and you're going to
do<00:05:28.310> that<00:05:28.430> twice<00:05:29.529> so<00:05:30.529> that<00:05:30.770> whole<00:05:30.949> sequence

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.970 

all<00:05:39.720> right<00:05:39.840> and<00:05:40.020> then<00:05:40.110> from<00:05:40.320> there<00:05:40.530> it<00:05:40.800> would

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:40.980 
all right and then from there it would

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:44.990 
all right and then from there it would
go<00:05:41.190> into<00:05:41.780> the<00:05:42.780> turnaround<00:05:43.640> so<00:05:44.640> be<00:05:44.820> sure<00:05:44.850> to

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:45.000 
go into the turnaround so be sure to

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.870 
go into the turnaround so be sure to
watch<00:05:45.270> for<00:05:45.320> the<00:05:46.320> second<00:05:46.830> half<00:05:47.010> of<00:05:47.280> this<00:05:47.610> lesson

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:47.880 
watch for the second half of this lesson

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.840 
watch for the second half of this lesson
so<00:05:48.360> you<00:05:48.450> can<00:05:48.750> get<00:05:49.110> that<00:05:49.290> part<00:05:49.560> of<00:05:49.650> it<00:05:49.770> any<00:05:50.700> hope

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:50.850 
so you can get that part of it any hope

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:52.430 
so you can get that part of it any hope
