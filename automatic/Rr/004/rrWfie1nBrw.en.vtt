was<00:04:40.410> a<00:04:40.500> bad<00:04:40.680> idea<00:04:40.710> because<00:04:41.070> I<00:04:41.280> had<00:04:41.430> a<00:04:41.460> bunch<00:04:41.790> of

was a bad idea because I had a bunch of

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.900 
was a bad idea because I had a bunch of
wizards<00:04:42.180> that<00:04:42.690> came<00:04:43.230> out<00:04:43.440> in<00:04:43.680> I<00:04:44.280> had<00:04:44.460> a<00:04:44.520> giant

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.150 
bomb that just blew up those giants and

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.900 
bomb that just blew up those giants and
then<00:04:48.360> the<00:04:48.510> wizard<00:04:48.810> just<00:04:49.020> finished<00:04:49.350> him<00:04:49.470> off<00:04:49.910> he

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:50.910 
then the wizard just finished him off he

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:53.570 
then the wizard just finished him off he
sent<00:04:51.150> out<00:04:51.210> a<00:04:51.270> level<00:04:51.600> 4<00:04:51.870> dragon<00:04:52.230> from<00:04:52.800> this<00:04:53.010> clan
