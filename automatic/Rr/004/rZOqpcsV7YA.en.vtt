a to come back to it I would say that
even<00:01:17.729> in<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.000> New<00:01:18.180> Testament<00:01:18.210> not<00:01:18.869> just<00:01:19.170> the

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
even in the New Testament not just the

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.310 
even in the New Testament not just the
Old<00:01:19.470> Testament<00:01:20.040> sometimes<00:01:21.030> I<00:01:21.390> think<00:01:21.659> there

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
Old Testament sometimes I think there

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.490 
Old Testament sometimes I think there
are<00:01:22.400> there<00:01:23.400> are<00:01:23.430> in<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.330> light<00:01:24.630> of<00:01:24.659> who<00:01:25.049> Jesus

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
are there are in the light of who Jesus

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.859 
are there are in the light of who Jesus
is<00:01:25.650> and<00:01:25.950> how<00:01:26.700> Jesus<00:01:26.939> lived<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:27.630> what<00:01:27.750> he

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
is and how Jesus lived and what he

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.200 
is and how Jesus lived and what he
taught<00:01:28.110> there<00:01:28.650> are<00:01:29.000> misrepresentations<00:01:30.000> so

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
taught there are misrepresentations so

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.539 
taught there are misrepresentations so
take<00:01:30.450> another<00:01:30.720> one<00:01:30.930> say<00:01:31.650> take<00:01:32.040> another<00:01:32.340> one

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
take another one say take another one

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.270 
take another one say take another one
and<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:33.299> writer<00:01:33.509> of<00:01:33.780> 1<00:01:33.960> Timothy<00:01:34.200> says<00:01:35.130> that

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
and the writer of 1 Timothy says that

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.210 
and the writer of 1 Timothy says that
women<00:01:35.490> shouldn't<00:01:36.210> speak<00:01:36.540> in<00:01:36.780> a<00:01:36.869> church

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
women shouldn't speak in a church

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:42.380 
women shouldn't speak in a church
because<00:01:38.659> Adam<00:01:39.659> was<00:01:40.200> created<00:01:40.229> before<00:01:40.860> Eve<00:01:41.390> so

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
because Adam was created before Eve so

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.719 
because Adam was created before Eve so
she<00:01:42.450> should<00:01:42.780> go<00:01:42.930> now<00:01:43.350> I<00:01:43.500> think<00:01:44.100> that<00:01:44.490> the

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
she should go now I think that the

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.639 
she should go now I think that the
writer<00:01:44.970> to<00:01:45.270> Timothy<00:01:45.659> was<00:01:45.840> probably<00:01:46.140> not<00:01:46.380> Paul

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
writer to Timothy was probably not Paul

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.710 
writer to Timothy was probably not Paul
may<00:01:47.220> have<00:01:47.340> been<00:01:47.549> Paul<00:01:48.680> it's<00:01:49.680> just<00:01:50.130> not

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
may have been Paul it's just not

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.850 
may have been Paul it's just not
