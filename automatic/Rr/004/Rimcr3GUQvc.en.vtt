00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:24.049 
redstone yet a 3 volt battery and if I

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:26.410 
redstone yet a 3 volt battery and if I
take<00:02:24.319> 3<00:02:24.890> volt<00:02:25.129> battery<00:02:25.519> meetings<00:02:25.879> with<00:02:26.209> some

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
take 3 volt battery meetings with some

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.979 
take 3 volt battery meetings with some
redstone<00:02:26.599> get<00:02:27.439> a<00:02:27.470> 5<00:02:27.680> volt<00:02:27.709> battery<00:02:28.489> and<00:02:28.780> so<00:02:29.780> on

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
redstone get a 5 volt battery and so on

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:33.610 
redstone get a 5 volt battery and so on
seven<00:02:30.680> volts<00:02:30.860> what<00:02:31.280> I'm<00:02:31.970> sure<00:02:32.290> until<00:02:33.290> you<00:02:33.349> get

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
seven volts what I'm sure until you get

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.449 
seven volts what I'm sure until you get
a<00:02:33.739> nine<00:02:33.950> volt<00:02:33.980> battery<00:02:35.440> so<00:02:36.440> this<00:02:36.950> nine<00:02:37.159> volt

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
a nine volt battery so this nine volt

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:41.819 
a nine volt battery so this nine volt
battery<00:02:37.940> will<00:02:38.180> need<00:02:38.390> in<00:02:38.540> a<00:02:38.599> minute<00:02:39.700> redstone

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:41.829 
battery will need in a minute redstone

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:45.309 
battery will need in a minute redstone
so<00:02:42.829> the<00:02:43.340> next<00:02:43.730> thing<00:02:43.939> obviously<00:02:44.720> you<00:02:44.959> need<00:02:45.200> to
