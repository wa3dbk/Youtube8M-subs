00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:12.059
 after his success on the lawn of istres 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.490
 simulating a throw in a position 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.830
 very favorable in case of victory against 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.350
 brest the climb will be validated for 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.199
 blood and gold a team lensoise printed 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.180
 helped lady diana and martial ljuboja 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.859
 is the only important absent side 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.990
 Brest 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:29.279
 brest did a great comeback is reassembled 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.810
 up to 8th place 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.300
 but it's too late to play 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.100
 rise of the Brestois who want when 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.840
 even to finish well to play the 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.370
 climb next season 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.700
 lens on its side clings to its 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.500
 third place a draw could 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.250
 suffice to thanks to the difference in goals 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.690
 for the lensois 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.399
 but the goal of the game is still 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.710
 to win at the bollaert stadium 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.719
 and celebrate the climb with the public 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.870
 the first opportunity is still 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:57.239
 Brest, mistrust because the Bretons are 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.440
 come to play that's what he shows 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.120
 since the beginning of the match 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:06.270
 another opportunity to open the score 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:07.560
 is still not successful and lensois 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.299
 remain on five matches without defeat 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.140
 but have conceded a lot of matches 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.140
 void at home 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:18.040
 the whistle of jérôme miguelgorry 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:21.550
 for this fault on the queen named 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:23.140
 john harry but no penalty and brest 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.480
 who continue to be threatening with this 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.310
 recovered balloon in good position 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:31.750
 the possibility of hitting the ball 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:33.070
 captured by alphonse areola team 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.950
 northerner who really is not 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.750
 still in this game yet lens 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.250
 even though there were a lot of points 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.720
 conceded at home we only lost one 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:46.750
 only once on his court this season 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:49.360
 it was facing istres at halftime 0 to 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:55.960
 0 antoine kombouaré and his players 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:57.940
 are not completely reassured in seconds 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.310
 period the lensois that accelerates for 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.200
 mark that goal that would change everything with 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.630
 yohann touzghar to give the ball in 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.030
 removing the balloon that is deflected and that 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.040
 misses 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.530
 a ball deflected by arms according to 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:14.230
 lensois 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:16.260
 jérôme miguelgorry does not grant 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.260
 penalty 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:24.460
 which would not have been necessarily 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:26.710
 outrageous considering the action but we forget 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:29.620
 quickly this action to have others 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:31.620
 opportunities and in particular this penalty 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.700
 this time he is well whistling 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.190
 the referee did not hesitate 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:41.440
 the fault in the penalty area 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:43.750
 on an adamo coulibaly is perhaps the 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:47.980
 goal of the climb in league 1 yoann 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:50.320
 touzghar face alexis thebaux and alexis 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.990
 the thorns that pops up and which starts from the good 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.640
 side to save this balloon we stay at 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:56.470
 0-0 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.390
 it's a very hard blow on the head of 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.959
 lensois who was in doubt since the 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.550
 kick-off 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:02.820
 but who plays better in the second 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:02.820
 period 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:10.700
 brest continues to try his luck in 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:14.370
 a very open match 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:16.319
 it goes deep with the hook 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.959
 and the victorious strike for jonathan 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:22.140
 the Togolese international has opened the 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:24.269
 score in the 79th minute sixth goal of 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.370
 the season for ayité and the disaster 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:31.830
 for lens who did not expect maybe 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:33.349
 not that because the 0-0 we were 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.970
 finally not such a bad result 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:37.200
 for lonsois with a ball the 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.000
 better goal difference than their 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:44.849
 pursuers 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:46.620
 but this goal changes any lens that insists 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:49.140
 to try to equalize with the latter 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.220
 corner s is saved by alexis thebal the 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.739
 match is over 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:55.560
 prestige win for brest 1-0 at 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:57.629
 bollaert lens will have to wait for 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.250
 validate his rise in league 1 and play at 

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:01.430
 to be scared until the end of 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.430
 championship
