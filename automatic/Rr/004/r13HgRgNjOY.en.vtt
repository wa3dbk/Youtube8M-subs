 today I am very happy about you 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.079
 find to present you the tutorials 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.640
 evolution on the new as soon as 

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:25.500
 final series bows out 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.970
 precisely today it is 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.360
 really very very happy about you 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.399
 find 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.619
 this is the case you also do not hesitate to 

00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:32.820
 tell me in the comment space in 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.670
 any case in this video i'm going to you 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.390
 present the evolution of operations in 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.010
 tin 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.790
 that's how it's called 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.960
 or operation flocks all the evolution 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.240
 on this map 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.560
 it's a bit the same thing as on the 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.320
 china dlc to beijing 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:51.930
 it's a bomber that's only on 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.390
 this map on operations and all so 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.960
 to activate the rendezvous bomber 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.270
 on the point f in wide conquest so he 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.030
 will be enough to climb on the small 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.799
 submarine to the surface once 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.520
 you will capture and therefore the flag 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:10.440
 for your own camp show you on 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.360
 the submarine is at the top as one 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.580
 can see it you will have a hatch 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.250
 once the flag is in your possession 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.049
 it only remains to enter the 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.210
 submarine which serves as the post of 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.490
 control for the bomber and that's it 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.520
 with a little animation after you 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:29.520
 will have partial control let's say the 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.200
 bomber because you will only be able to 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.159
 slightly turn left and right 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.750
 and zoom in and let go of theirs but 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.880
 here you can not control 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.220
 totally the bomber and it's rather 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.570
 not bad at worst if you aim for nothing 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.729
 does not hurt a lot of damage 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.250
 finally we must aim really pile hair 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.830
 the missile on the on the type but hey 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.890
 that's after then you'll have four 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.600
 attracted missiles that you can shoot 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.939
 really twice if you do it 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.890
 at his rates for the first salvo is the 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.159
 second so towards the end of the map 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.110
 you will interest a second salvo 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:07.450
 is at the level of the big evolution 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.849
 on this map it's already finished 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.080
 to that a big evolution on 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:12.640
 bleeding is not bad 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.800
 after you have other small 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.930
 interactions as we are used to 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.970
 see now on 24 as the opening 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.680
 doors closing doors 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.120
 besides if you stay in the middle of 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.160
 the closing of the doors you will take 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.030
 delegations one of the novelties of this 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.980
 final stands 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.810
 in short I hope this short video 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.010
 you will have liked if it is the case as 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.959
 usually do not hesitate to do it 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.030
 know in the commentary space in 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:36.160
 sharing your opinion leave a 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.660
 little I like to share as usual

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.370
