00:00:01.099 --> 00:00:08.509
 Hello, how are we doing today when our kids are harvesting? 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:15.440
 Interesting and fun 

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:18.800
 Let's take a look at how you can do this without giving up. 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:23.779
 Math is a fundamental discipline of all disciplines 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:28.399
 So the kids who are good at mathematics are good at all the other subjects they have in common . 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:33.649
 And then there's a lot of math. 

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:37.489
 There are many areas, among them the fact that they occupy the position of the book 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:44.690
 That's right about the number . 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:47.809
 So I calculated from the number of positive operational today hwanggyeongsik fountain piece that essay 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:55.100
 Function diagram 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:57.579
 The main system and how to make a run at the first linkage whether the description 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.579
 I will. 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.070
 4 First 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:06.490
 Through computation 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:11.800
 We must develop diversity of thought. 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:17.979
 And do not look at a single issue from a single point of view. 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:22.330
 Doegoyo should be trained by watching and how to simplify a complex problem, which seems to 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:26.530
 We'll see if we can solve it. 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:33.300
 Let's see this problem first. 457 - 374 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:33.300
 What do you think? Most of you have this idea. 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:44.860
 The urge to get up so early, release soon do you have to write 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:49.869
 Yet another may be so when a large number of enemies in the room was very sudden 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:54.430
 I'm not very happy about this part. You have to do something. 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:57.430
 Here's the way to simplify complex Degas geteupnida security issues 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:03.310
 How do you do it? 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:09.759
 Something I wrote on both sides of 310. 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:14.250
 The answer is the same. The phone looks simple. It looks easy. 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.250
 Then let's watch for simplicity. 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:23.730
 I think it's very easy to get flesh out of the room. 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:31.500
 So eventually this is 205 rooms 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:32.880
 It's a simple addition to March, 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.390
 It was. 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:44.100
 So eventually this 150 - 70 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:50.070
 Ie 25 - Simply 7 I do this tower is not easy to get Sam 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:55.980
 So, with this simple count, 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:58.470
 What our kids one problem through the diversity of the many different visual thinking 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:03.530
 Let's see if we can see it. 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:03.530
 First of all, we have to do this vertically in general. 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.180
 It 's time for the ocean to fall. 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:12.150
 right 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:16.450
 I'll see you the second time 15 - 7 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:19.680
 This sample also I much 10 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.680
 It's time to pay. 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:28.440
 And add five. 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.440
 So this is three, 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.939
 Here is another way COMMIT 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:40.080
 There's a big number behind you when you compared the second base seat - because of the strength. 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:45.420
 So now 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:46.770
 2 - 7 is misaligned first , subtract 5, then subtract it 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:52.830
 It's giving. 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:58.200
 How much geuraetdeoni's right to 10a degradable 8 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:04:01.980
 Let's try to think of it again . 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:06.480
 So close to ten. 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:09.480
 I do not subtract seeds from 15, but eleven 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:13.470
 It will only make sense. 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:18.100
 So give me the fly. 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:23.230
 The other party to think 15 times the banner 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:27.190
 sm is the sum of this value from this value. 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:31.450
 The goal is to make 15 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:34.390
 So I write three. 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:39.820
 Our goal is to make 15 goals 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:41.380
 So plus plus three books on the rise 5 may be answered that the arm 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:45.070
 I have it 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:49.470
 Now, another thought . 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:49.470
 It's close to the clock of seven. 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:56.880
 + 30 days south 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:05:00.110
 Expression did see recreated 18 110 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.110
 It was a semi-shore . 

00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:08.960
 So this is a simple auction - have you tried a variety of ways to relieve yourself seven times ? 

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:12.800
 There are many other ways 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:17.450
 Well , let's try to be a little complicated. 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:20.300
 143 - 78 What method should I use here? 

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:23.570
 Here's the fifth method 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:27.740
 So, in this 78 

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:30.590
 It 's my goal to make 143 by adding this. 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:35.669
 So if you add a little at 78 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:39.840
 What do you make on the 21st of the day , making 100? 

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:43.319
 Then, because our goal is 143 Compiling a goal 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:46.789
 43 is added, 

00:05:43.319 --> 00:05:46.789
 You can read these answers 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:56.440
 Itjyo What else can also be just the way we look at one party to sixth methods 

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:56.440
 78 is a bag for 20 days. 

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:04.600
 So what if you add 22 on both sides? 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:10.300
 Yes, I become 165 

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:13.600
 So this is 100, so 165 is subtracted from 100 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:19.090
 So you can do the same with 65. 

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:24.670
 So we do not see a problem as a rock, 

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:27.000
 We should try to approach diversity of thinking by trying 

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:27.000
 It is.
