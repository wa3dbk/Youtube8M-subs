00:02:24.149 --> 00:02:24.159 
when I read it I thought oh god I've got

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:25.679 
when I read it I thought oh god I've got
to<00:02:24.250> do<00:02:24.340> that<00:02:24.489> you<00:02:24.760> know<00:02:24.879> as<00:02:25.030> an<00:02:25.150> actor<00:02:25.420> I've<00:02:25.540> got
