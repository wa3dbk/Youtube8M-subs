into the glitch at hand for this glitch

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.750 
into the glitch at hand for this glitch
you'll<00:01:00.809> simply<00:01:01.109> need<00:01:01.320> to<00:01:01.469> do<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.859> wall<00:01:02.520> breach

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
you'll simply need to do the wall breach

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.299 
you'll simply need to do the wall breach
with<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.420> trampled<00:01:04.019> steamer<00:01:04.229> which<00:01:05.040> I<00:01:05.159> show

with the trampled steamer which I show
in<00:01:05.430> a<00:01:05.489> previous<00:01:05.729> video<00:01:06.060> where<00:01:06.930> you<00:01:06.990> angle<00:01:07.439> it

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
in a previous video where you angle it

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.859 
in a previous video where you angle it
and<00:01:07.710> then<00:01:07.890> you<00:01:08.010> can<00:01:08.159> go<00:01:08.250> into<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.970> wall<00:01:09.180> now

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
and then you can go into the wall now

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.200 
and then you can go into the wall now
all<00:01:10.080> you<00:01:10.170> want<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.380> do<00:01:10.560> is<00:01:10.799> have<00:01:11.760> a<00:01:11.820> trample

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.609 
all you want to do is have a trample
steam<00:01:12.270> while<00:01:12.720> you're<00:01:12.990> in<00:01:13.049> that<00:01:13.200> wall<00:01:13.380> breach

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
steam while you're in that wall breach

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.880 
steam while you're in that wall breach
and<00:01:13.950> then<00:01:14.810> just<00:01:15.810> place<00:01:15.990> it<00:01:16.049> and<00:01:16.439> if<00:01:16.740> done

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
and then just place it and if done

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.380 
and then just place it and if done
incorrectly<00:01:17.009> you<00:01:17.549> should<00:01:17.729> just<00:01:17.759> walbrzych

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
incorrectly you should just walbrzych

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.010 
incorrectly you should just walbrzych
you<00:01:18.720> into<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.350> roof<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:19.939> then<00:01:20.939> there<00:01:21.450> from

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
you into the roof and then there from

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.940 
you into the roof and then there from
there<00:01:22.200> you're<00:01:22.409> going<00:01:22.439> to<00:01:22.619> need<00:01:22.830> another

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
there you're going to need another

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.530 
there you're going to need another
trample<00:01:23.549> steamer<00:01:23.759> so<00:01:24.180> you're<00:01:24.360> going<00:01:24.479> to

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
trample steamer so you're going to

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.120 
trample steamer so you're going to
probably<00:01:24.780> need<00:01:24.960> three<00:01:25.290> or<00:01:25.320> four<00:01:25.560> players<00:01:25.830> do

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
probably need three or four players do

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.310 
probably need three or four players do
this<00:01:26.280> and<00:01:26.549> then<00:01:27.180> from<00:01:27.330> there<00:01:27.420> when<00:01:27.780> your<00:01:27.930> wall

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
this and then from there when your wall

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.499 
this and then from there when your wall
breaching<00:01:28.770> through<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.280> roof<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.759> simply

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
breaching through the roof to simply

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.300 
breaching through the roof to simply
place<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.869> trampled<00:01:31.290> stammer<00:01:31.470> on<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:32.100> roof

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
place the trampled stammer on the roof

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.210 
place the trampled stammer on the roof
like<00:01:32.610> I<00:01:32.759> did<00:01:33.350> angling<00:01:34.350> towards<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.799> wall<00:01:34.979> and

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
like I did angling towards the wall and

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.480 
like I did angling towards the wall and
if<00:01:35.909> done<00:01:36.060> correctly<00:01:36.090> you<00:01:36.630> should<00:01:36.689> um<00:01:37.490> balance

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
if done correctly you should um balance

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.490 
if done correctly you should um balance
towards<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.790> wall<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.150> now<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.750> tricky<00:01:40.290> part

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
towards the wall and now the tricky part

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.200 
towards the wall and now the tricky part
about<00:01:40.560> this<00:01:40.829> is<00:01:40.890> you're<00:01:41.189> going<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:41.430> need<00:01:42.180> to

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
about this is you're going to need to

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.539 
about this is you're going to need to
move<00:01:42.450> forward<00:01:42.840> because<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.860> entire<00:01:44.189> roof

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
move forward because the entire roof

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.670 
move forward because the entire roof
does<00:01:44.939> have<00:01:45.090> a<00:01:45.119> death<00:01:45.329> barrier<00:01:45.720> but<00:01:46.020> this<00:01:46.259> saw

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
does have a death barrier but this saw

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.520 
does have a death barrier but this saw
this<00:01:47.340> wall<00:01:47.640> doesn't<00:01:48.110> so<00:01:49.110> you're<00:01:49.350> gonna<00:01:49.470> have

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
this wall doesn't so you're gonna have
