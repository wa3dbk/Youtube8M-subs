what<00:00:25.560> that<00:00:25.740> means<00:00:25.949> is<00:00:26.220> we<00:00:26.939> want<00:00:27.480> to<00:00:27.570> get<00:00:27.720> the

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
what that means is we want to get the

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.599 
what that means is we want to get the
puck<00:00:28.080> to<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.470> guy<00:00:28.619> who<00:00:29.130> is<00:00:29.220> going<00:00:29.400> to<00:00:29.519> be

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
puck to the guy who is going to be

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.060 
puck to the guy who is going to be
entering<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.029> zone<00:00:30.060> first<00:00:30.650> so<00:00:31.650> in<00:00:31.740> this<00:00:31.830> case

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
entering the zone first so in this case

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.770 
entering the zone first so in this case
if<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.550> center<00:00:32.820> for<00:00:33.030> example<00:00:33.090> has<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.600> puck

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
if the center for example has the puck

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.630 
if the center for example has the puck
if<00:00:34.050> he's<00:00:34.320> open<00:00:34.500> we<00:00:34.890> want<00:00:35.070> to<00:00:35.190> get<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.430> puck

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
if he's open we want to get the puck

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.220 
if he's open we want to get the puck
over<00:00:35.820> to<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.090> winger<00:00:36.390> because<00:00:36.809> he's<00:00:36.960> entering

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
over to the winger because he's entering

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.780 
over to the winger because he's entering
the<00:00:37.350> zone<00:00:37.380> first<00:00:37.770> what<00:00:38.190> happens<00:00:38.430> if<00:00:38.550> we<00:00:38.670> don't

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
the zone first what happens if we don't

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.990 
the zone first what happens if we don't
do<00:00:39.000> that<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.600> winger<00:00:39.870> has<00:00:40.050> to<00:00:40.320> wait<00:00:40.890> stop<00:00:41.640> at

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
do that the winger has to wait stop at

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.060 
do that the winger has to wait stop at
the<00:00:42.239> blue<00:00:42.420> line<00:00:42.450> for<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.500> center<00:00:43.800> to<00:00:43.890> come

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
the blue line for the center to come

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.369 
the blue line for the center to come
through<00:00:44.370> and<00:00:44.610> then<00:00:44.969> our<00:00:45.270> momentum<00:00:45.780> is<00:00:45.899> down<00:00:46.110> to

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
through and then our momentum is down to

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.229 
through and then our momentum is down to
just<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.039> center<00:00:47.370> and<00:00:47.520> perhaps<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.940> winger

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
just the center and perhaps the winger

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.049 
just the center and perhaps the winger
whereas<00:00:48.809> we<00:00:49.020> can<00:00:49.050> keep<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.680> momentum<00:00:49.800> by<00:00:50.550> and

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
whereas we can keep the momentum by and

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.520 
whereas we can keep the momentum by and
Manning<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.600> puck<00:00:51.780> and<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.079> winger<00:00:52.320> can

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
Manning the puck and the winger can

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.410 
Manning the puck and the winger can
continue<00:00:52.949> in<00:00:53.160> and<00:00:53.489> then<00:00:53.699> we<00:00:53.820> have<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.149> winger

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
continue in and then we have the winger

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.090 
continue in and then we have the winger
coming<00:00:54.750> in<00:00:54.870> and<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.260> center<00:00:55.590> and<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.980> other

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
coming in and the center and the other

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.599 
coming in and the center and the other
way<00:00:57.170> so<00:00:58.170> we'll<00:00:58.350> have<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.859> momentum<00:00:59.219> left

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
way so we'll have the momentum left

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.240 
way so we'll have the momentum left
three<00:00:59.850> players<00:01:00.199> well<00:01:01.199> ideally<00:01:01.680> all<00:01:01.949> five

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
three players well ideally all five

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.329 
three players well ideally all five
players<00:01:02.609> moving<00:01:02.969> in<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.539> attack<00:01:03.840> at<00:01:04.019> once

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
players moving in to attack at once

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:06.859 
players moving in to attack at once
rather<00:01:05.339> than<00:01:05.670> having<00:01:05.880> one<00:01:06.360> of<00:01:06.390> our<00:01:06.570> players

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
rather than having one of our players

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.350 
rather than having one of our players
have<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.320> stop<00:01:07.979> completely<00:01:08.790> come<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.180> dead

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
and for a pass a lot of times you can

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.649 
and for a pass a lot of times you can
have<00:01:27.390> a<00:01:27.420> situation<00:01:27.689> where<00:01:28.579> we<00:01:29.579> give<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.240> puck

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659

to<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:30.900> head<00:01:31.110> man<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:32.009> defenders<00:01:32.579> turn<00:01:33.119> their

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
to the head man the defenders turn their

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.480 
to the head man the defenders turn their
attention<00:01:33.840> and<00:01:34.049> maybe<00:01:34.619> even<00:01:34.829> skate<00:01:35.189> towards

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
attention and maybe even skate towards

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.420 
attention and maybe even skate towards
that<00:01:35.640> guy<00:01:35.820> and<00:01:36.090> an<00:01:36.210> immediate<00:01:36.600> return<00:01:36.990> pass

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
that guy and an immediate return pass

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.950 
that guy and an immediate return pass
works<00:01:38.430> out<00:01:38.640> really<00:01:38.850> well<00:01:39.150> and<00:01:39.450> that<00:01:39.659> winger

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
works out really well and that winger

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.020 
works out really well and that winger
can<00:01:40.170> continue<00:01:40.770> indeed<00:01:41.100> because<00:01:41.490> he's<00:01:41.700> come

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
can continue indeed because he's come

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.270 
can continue indeed because he's come
into<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.329> blue<00:01:42.479> line<00:01:42.689> that<00:01:43.079> way<00:01:43.290> we<00:01:43.500> can<00:01:43.770> work

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
into the blue line that way we can work

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.370 
into the blue line that way we can work
together<00:01:44.490> to<00:01:44.970> bring<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.659> puck<00:01:45.840> into<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.200> zone

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
together to bring the puck into the zone

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.710 
together to bring the puck into the zone
so<00:01:46.950> ed<00:01:47.310> Manning<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.729> puck<00:01:47.880> get<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.240> fur<00:01:48.420> the

over<00:03:34.780> here<00:03:34.930> to<00:03:35.020> the<00:03:35.110> boards<00:03:35.440> that's<00:03:36.400> common

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
over here to the boards that's common

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.699 
over here to the boards that's common
scenario<00:03:37.480> so<00:03:37.660> now<00:03:37.810> this<00:03:37.959> defender<00:03:38.380> has<00:03:38.530> to

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
scenario so now this defender has to

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:40.650 
scenario so now this defender has to
decide<00:03:39.040> whether<00:03:39.610> he's<00:03:39.820> gonna<00:03:39.970> pitch<00:03:40.240> in<00:03:40.480> and

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660 
decide whether he's gonna pitch in and

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.570 
decide whether he's gonna pitch in and
try<00:03:40.810> to<00:03:40.870> keep<00:03:41.080> the<00:03:41.260> puck<00:03:41.440> in<00:03:41.650> or<00:03:42.070> whether<00:03:42.370> he's

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:42.580 
try to keep the puck in or whether he's

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.730 
try to keep the puck in or whether he's
gonna<00:03:42.730> start<00:03:43.450> the<00:03:43.570> cushion<00:03:43.959> because<00:03:44.500> the

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:44.740 
gonna start the cushion because the

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:45.960 
gonna start the cushion because the
other<00:03:44.860> team's<00:03:45.100> gonna<00:03:45.250> get<00:03:45.430> there<00:03:45.550> first

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
other team's gonna get there first

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.630 
other team's gonna get there first
I<00:03:46.090> want<00:03:46.540> this<00:03:46.690> defender<00:03:47.380> to<00:03:47.530> feel<00:03:47.860> free<00:03:48.160> to

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:48.640 
I want this defender to feel free to

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.060 
I want this defender to feel free to
make<00:03:48.820> the<00:03:49.300> choice<00:03:49.540> that<00:03:49.840> he<00:03:50.050> thinks<00:03:50.470> is<00:03:50.770> his

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:51.070 
make the choice that he thinks is his

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:54.000 
make the choice that he thinks is his
best<00:03:51.489> and<00:03:51.790> if<00:03:51.970> he<00:03:52.120> decides<00:03:52.239> to<00:03:52.900> pinch<00:03:53.320> in<00:03:53.530> you

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
best and if he decides to pinch in you

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:54.960 
best and if he decides to pinch in you
know<00:03:54.100> hopefully<00:03:54.310> he's<00:03:54.550> gonna<00:03:54.640> get<00:03:54.820> there

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
know hopefully he's gonna get there

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:55.440 
know hopefully he's gonna get there
first

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
first

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.479 
first
what<00:03:55.690> is<00:03:55.870> a<00:03:55.959> great<00:03:56.350> way<00:03:56.530> to<00:03:56.560> support<00:03:57.130> this

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:57.489 
what is a great way to support this

00:03:57.489 --> 00:03:59.940 
what is a great way to support this
decision<00:03:57.790> is<00:03:58.300> if<00:03:58.570> the<00:03:58.690> winger<00:03:59.050> is<00:03:59.230> already

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950 
decision is if the winger is already

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.100 
decision is if the winger is already
seeing<00:04:00.580> the<00:04:00.760> situation<00:04:01.330> and<00:04:01.420> reacting<00:04:01.870> to<00:04:01.900> it

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:02.110 
seeing the situation and reacting to it

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:05.100 
seeing the situation and reacting to it
and<00:04:02.290> moving<00:04:03.100> that<00:04:03.520> way<00:04:03.790> moving<00:04:04.570> to<00:04:04.810> take<00:04:04.959> the

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.110 
and moving that way moving to take the

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:07.020 
and moving that way moving to take the
defender<00:04:05.470> spot<00:04:05.770> so<00:04:06.130> you<00:04:06.190> have<00:04:06.459> the<00:04:06.580> defender

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
defender spot so you have the defender

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.810 
defender spot so you have the defender
moving<00:04:07.330> in<00:04:07.989> deeper<00:04:08.650> pitching<00:04:09.130> and<00:04:09.280> the<00:04:09.340> winger

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:09.820 
moving in deeper pitching and the winger

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:11.520 
moving in deeper pitching and the winger
moving<00:04:10.239> to<00:04:10.480> take<00:04:10.660> his<00:04:10.870> position

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530 
moving to take his position

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:13.710 
moving to take his position
so<00:04:11.620> hopefully<00:04:11.800> the<00:04:12.100> the<00:04:12.370> defensive<00:04:13.000> player

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720 
so hopefully the the defensive player

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.409 
so hopefully the the defensive player
can<00:04:14.050> win<00:04:14.080> the<00:04:14.470> puck<00:04:14.680> carry<00:04:15.610> it<00:04:15.790> or<00:04:15.940> push<00:04:16.150> it<00:04:16.180> in

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:16.419 
can win the puck carry it or push it in

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:18.509 
can win the puck carry it or push it in
deeper<00:04:16.810> and<00:04:16.989> the<00:04:17.560> winger<00:04:17.829> coming<00:04:18.160> back<00:04:18.310> out

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 
deeper and the winger coming back out

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:20.490 
deeper and the winger coming back out
here<00:04:18.549> to<00:04:18.820> take<00:04:19.000> his<00:04:19.180> spot<00:04:19.299> okay<00:04:19.870> know<00:04:20.169> the

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
here to take his spot okay know the

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.980 
here to take his spot okay know the
senator<00:04:20.890> seeing<00:04:21.280> this<00:04:21.459> might<00:04:22.030> react<00:04:22.390> by

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:22.990 
senator seeing this might react by

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:25.620 
senator seeing this might react by
moving<00:04:23.620> in<00:04:23.890> deep<00:04:24.100> for<00:04:24.460> a<00:04:24.490> pass<00:04:24.729> down<00:04:25.030> here<00:04:25.450> if

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630 
moving in deep for a pass down here if

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:28.230 
moving in deep for a pass down here if
the<00:04:26.440> defenders<00:04:27.220> best<00:04:27.430> option<00:04:27.760> is<00:04:27.820> to<00:04:27.850> dump<00:04:28.120> the

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:28.240 
the defenders best option is to dump the

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.719 
the defenders best option is to dump the
puck<00:04:28.450> then<00:04:29.350> move<00:04:29.590> in<00:04:29.740> for<00:04:29.950> the<00:04:29.979> pass<00:04:30.340> if<00:04:30.610> the

00:04:30.719 --> 00:04:30.729 
puck then move in for the pass if the

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:32.940 
puck then move in for the pass if the
defenders<00:04:31.150> carry<00:04:31.419> maybe<00:04:31.930> staying<00:04:32.620> here<00:04:32.890> in

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:32.950 
defenders carry maybe staying here in

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:34.409 
defenders carry maybe staying here in
the<00:04:33.010> middle<00:04:33.280> is<00:04:33.430> the<00:04:33.700> best<00:04:33.910> thing<00:04:34.090> you<00:04:34.150> looking

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:34.419 
the middle is the best thing you looking

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:37.710 
the middle is the best thing you looking
for<00:04:34.600> a<00:04:34.630> crossing<00:04:35.290> pass<00:04:35.650> okay<00:04:36.490> so<00:04:37.210> those

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720 
for a crossing pass okay so those

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.620 
for a crossing pass okay so those
decisions<00:04:38.370> you<00:04:39.370> can<00:04:39.550> support<00:04:39.910> the<00:04:40.210> defender

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 
decisions you can support the defender

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:44.940 
decisions you can support the defender
pitching<00:04:41.100> wingers<00:04:42.100> by<00:04:43.169> being<00:04:44.169> already<00:04:44.680> moving

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:44.950 
pitching wingers by being already moving

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:47.580 
pitching wingers by being already moving
in<00:04:45.310> that<00:04:45.520> direction<00:04:45.580> when<00:04:46.330> the<00:04:46.510> puck<00:04:46.750> becomes

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590 
in that direction when the puck becomes

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.590 
in that direction when the puck becomes
a<00:04:47.710> 50/50<00:04:48.250> puck<00:04:48.460> along<00:04:48.700> the<00:04:48.820> boards<00:04:49.120> okay

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:49.600 
a 50/50 puck along the boards okay

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.010 
a 50/50 puck along the boards okay
that's<00:04:50.470> what<00:04:50.620> I<00:04:50.650> mean<00:04:50.860> by<00:04:51.240> d-wing<00:04:52.240> rotation

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
that's what I mean by d-wing rotation

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:56.729 
that's what I mean by d-wing rotation
same<00:04:53.440> thing<00:04:53.680> on<00:04:53.800> the<00:04:53.890> other<00:04:53.919> side<00:04:54.100> okay
