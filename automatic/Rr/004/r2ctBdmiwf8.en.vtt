 we connect others presentation free professional training 

00:00:09.109 --> 00:00:13.809
 More responsibilities at www point commented that because of the little injury 

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:18.689
 sponsored can lead to advertising 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:33.870
 welcome to the north of london where we will explain how we can apply 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.170
 an image in texture form 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.850
 we have a document created and what we are going to do is work with the cube 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:41.610
 which comes by default 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.380
 if we go to the materials button and work inside the 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:49.170
 textures button we will be able to add a new texture to yourself 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.390
 from here, we could select different textures that 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.650
 they come by default another go down with magic kingfisher 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:59.650
 in loach image we are going to select where we have located 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.440
 our texture in this case we have it on the desk 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.700
 it's called texture 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.500
 and I tell him he's burned 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.360
 already applied in my texture 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.230
 yes i learn sbs 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:12.420
 I can see 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.630
 like on one of the sides' you're throwing this texture at me and it does not look like 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:17.520
 should 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.680
 this happens because it motivates you to fla 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.560
 if we go back to the materials button and work within the 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.320
 window in mapimÃ­ booth 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.780
 we will see that by default we activate the function of flat in the preview 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.840
 we can see how they behave of that texture 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.730
 if we work with the different options that appear for example cube 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:38.400
 I had a fair voice 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.640
 yes applied body 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.750
 if they do not apply the texture without ming unite of training as it continues to work 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:44.780
 form 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.770
 squares could work if it were masters would apply the wait function 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.180
 and the texture would not punish us and inform 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.180
 this case chairs work the function of cube fancy 12 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.970
 I can see how now if the texture is not applied the soldiers without 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:02.590
 form the investigated 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.510
 in the previous crash we already explained how we could apply a material ob 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:09.079
 a texture in this case 

00:02:09.079 --> 00:02:12.079
 on each of the faces independently 

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:18.829
 next we will explain another method that will be very useful to us 

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:19.489
 time of 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:24.379
 Textured objects had working with images the different faces 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:27.199
 for this we have a document created with a cube 

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:30.379
 and the first thing we're going to do is enter the start mode 

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:34.089
 we will have to make certain cuts in our game 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:39.209
 so that as if it were a paper image we could stretch the 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:40.040
 and put 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.849
 ten-t images 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:45.480
 let's work with the function of these lists we will press the key 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.439
 ap to remove the selection and define where we want to cut 

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:52.560
 for example the potato we are going to cut here because here 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.509
 And here 

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:58.479
 we leave one of the sides that is going to join us more to figure and it is not going to 

00:02:58.479 --> 00:03:00.599
 be all separated 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:03.979
 down we will do the same thing we select 

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:06.859
 these three edges 

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:10.580
 and we are going to make a cut in the ctera 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.669
 for example I'm here 

00:03:12.669 --> 00:03:16.079
 once we have said to the hoisting the cuts we are going to press the combination 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:18.089
 of keys control 

00:03:18.089 --> 00:03:21.089
 ia select the function too 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:24.150
 let's go to screen in two 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.119
 scriptory right button 

00:03:26.119 --> 00:03:29.209
 and we will use the function of an image editors 

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:35.010
 once done that we selected everything to us figure for and we pressed once the 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.519
 key to remove the selection and again to select it all twice the 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:40.919
 key 

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:43.380
 once done this we press the uu key 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.259
 and we select the function of a wall 

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:49.629
 from here we see that we have to define our figure 

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:54.869
 as if we see it cut out and spread on a piece of paper if we are going to play 

00:03:54.869 --> 00:03:55.899
 is 

00:03:55.899 --> 00:03:56.980
 written 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.599
 zabell v face layout 

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:03.729
 will allow us place we will figure in very high to be able to define the 

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:05.549
 thickness of the lines 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:07.119
 we say or what 

00:04:07.119 --> 00:04:11.199
 and we will address in a site easy to locate for example on the desk 

00:04:13.679 --> 00:04:15.329
 we have three years left 

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:16.430
 spy thorium 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.430
 and from here we're going to love it coffee 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:23.669
 6 yo 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.520
 we have done that if we go to photoshop 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:29.479
 let's go to yourself 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:32.559
 open and we're going to look for our guys 

00:04:32.559 --> 00:04:34.300
 box covers tejera 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.099
 we are going to open it 

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:40.319
 We will see what will allow us to texturize insert images within 

00:04:40.319 --> 00:04:43.699
 each of the sides to make it fast we go only 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.300
 draw a different color dot on each side 

00:04:48.029 --> 00:04:50.159
 we create a new stage 

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:53.289
 and we start for example a black one here 

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:54.990
 let's change the colors 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:57.990
 we leave with the red 

00:05:17.249 --> 00:05:20.539
 once this is done we can experience the layer backgrounds and we want it 

00:05:21.689 --> 00:05:24.709
 We were going to keep our figures controls 

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:26.990
 doubt where we want to save 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:30.950
 we will look for the tejeda format so that we keep selecting the same 

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:32.370
 equality file 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:35.629
 asks us if we want to overwrite we say yes 

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:37.189
 and because 

00:05:37.189 --> 00:05:40.520
 well we have already saved can we talk about it again 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:42.300
 from here we in image 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.469
 we will be able to open 

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:46.020
 open the texture 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:49.020
 let's find it we have it on the desk 

00:05:51.949 --> 00:05:54.289
 it's called cube tejeda box 

00:05:54.289 --> 00:05:56.169
 why not 

00:05:56.169 --> 00:06:00.199
 we can see that we apply to image even if we work in the 

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:03.630
 texture mode and we will be able to preview how it does not apply 

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:06.309
 from here and if we modify 

00:06:06.309 --> 00:06:09.309
 the novel vertices for example so far we are going to 

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:15.499
 with the g key 

00:06:15.499 --> 00:06:17.650
 and we are going to place it here 

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:21.000
 we can see how he has automatically made the same modification 

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:24.979
 in the figure keeping as we have defined 

00:06:24.979 --> 00:06:28.149
 that we want it to be or are located at the corner 

00:06:28.999 --> 00:06:31.999
 let's put it back in its place more or less around here 

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:35.979
 and let's see how we could launch and our image 

00:06:35.979 --> 00:06:39.289
 for this we should go to see materials button 

00:06:39.289 --> 00:06:43.240
 within textures we will work with an image texture 

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:47.390
 and the oaci we press to be the little arrows we will see that we already have the loaded image 

00:06:47.389 --> 00:06:49.999
 cube box 

00:06:49.999 --> 00:06:54.430
 one is that we load the image we must work on the texture of matter in the 

00:06:54.429 --> 00:06:55.819
 material button 

00:06:55.819 --> 00:06:57.180
 and that of Martin Booth 

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:01.410
 let's define that I work with v so that I take the coordinates that I love 

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:02.860
 defined us here 

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:06.469
 if we now tighten f12 we can see as automatic to more applied minds 

00:07:07.159 --> 00:07:08.569
 our texture 

00:07:08.569 --> 00:07:11.919
 to our game as well as we are defined from photoshop 

00:07:11.919 --> 00:07:15.720
 so until this tutorial I hope you find it useful, thank you very much 

00:07:15.719 --> 00:07:17.260
 for attention and until the next
