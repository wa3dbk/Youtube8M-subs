00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.290
 hello to all today I you 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:08.280
 found to show you an enarque 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:10.110
 ultra simple but very very pretty for 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.509
 start here are the products you 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.519
 are going to need a glass filled with water 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.719
 at room temperature varnishes 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.760
 references as many info trees and 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.390
 some Kurds have a roll of tape 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.980
 could also be useful 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.630
 firstly start by putting a 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.490
 first coat of varnish for me 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.750
 I chose the light blue and then 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.320
 house a second 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.320
 once that is 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.540
 put some tape around your finger 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.070
 it's really something that I you 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.750
 advise otherwise you will spend 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.530
 hours to remove the varnish that is going to 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.530
 drop on the skin 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.180
 in your glass of water at temperature 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:47.800
 ambient put a few drops of 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.280
 varnish alternating the colors of 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.280
 your choice 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.530
 when the circles do not spread out 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:56.269
 take a toothpick and rub the 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:00.050
 controller him towards you go see that 

00:00:56.269 --> 00:01:01.280
 will immediately fix the problem there 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.449
 is important to be fast enough 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.739
 when you put your drops of 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:05.360
 varnish in the water I would say it 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:06.830
 do not exceed 2 minutes otherwise the 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.500
 varnish will dry and you will not be able 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.180
 do your nail art with regards 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.680
 circles I advise you at least 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.940
 to have a good ten since the 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.530
 first we've done are going 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.530
 to dry will not be usable 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.679
 then take a toothpick from the 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.420
 center and come plotting some lines 

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:31.090
 as I do it is what will define 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.979
 renÃ© allard note that it is important 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.240
 disappointed and your toothpick every time 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:35.950
 that you dive them into the water otherwise 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.399
 it's not completely lit the surface 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.399
 of your nail polish 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.110
 put your finger in the water while going 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.850
 horizontally then blow on the 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.780
 surface of the water and come with a 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:52.800
 toothpick reap the old polish 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.800
 moods here is the result 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.260
 wait a few moments that the varnish 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.860
 be dry then you can come back 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.860
 the Scotch 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.179
 then with a brush soaked in 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.509
 dissolving I come clean up the 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:10.509
 contours 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.680
 last step very important it is 

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:17.269
 the application of a top coat for me 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.500
 it comes from and I bourjois 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:23.030
 likes a lot because he gives a lot 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.900
 of shine and one was young and that's it 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.939
 the final result 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.560
 I hope you did not like that 

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:28.849
 did you help him because for me 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.170
 it's the only one that I succeed 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:32.170
 suitably lease
