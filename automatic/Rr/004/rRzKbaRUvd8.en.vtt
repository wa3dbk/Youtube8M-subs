00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
looks a little bit weird but I think it

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.510 
looks a little bit weird but I think it
still<00:01:02.700> looks<00:01:02.880> good<00:01:03.090> but<00:01:04.010> as<00:01:05.010> you<00:01:05.190> can<00:01:05.280> see<00:01:05.339> they

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:05.520 
still looks good but as you can see they

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.400 
still looks good but as you can see they
have<00:01:05.640> that<00:01:05.790> little<00:01:06.240> backpack<00:01:06.750> thing<00:01:07.050> in<00:01:07.320> the

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:07.410
