00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.880 
runners is they don't have a ton of hit
points<00:01:38.540> so<00:01:39.540> when<00:01:39.630> they<00:01:39.750> try<00:01:39.900> to<00:01:39.960> actually<00:01:40.170> get

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
points so when they try to actually get

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.980 
points so when they try to actually get
up<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:41.130> these<00:01:41.280> these<00:01:41.670> uh<00:01:41.730> I<00:01:42.120> mean<00:01:42.240> gunfighters

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
up to these these uh I mean gunfighters

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.840 
up to these these uh I mean gunfighters
up<00:01:43.140> here<00:01:43.350> they'll<00:01:43.979> just<00:01:44.160> die<00:01:44.340> before<00:01:44.550> they<00:01:44.729> can

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
up here they'll just die before they can

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.760 
up here they'll just die before they can
get<00:01:44.940> through<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.180> wall<00:01:45.560> so<00:01:46.560> we<00:01:46.590> have

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
get through the wall so we have

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.350 
get through the wall so we have
different<00:01:46.860> units<00:01:47.280> we<00:01:47.370> can<00:01:47.490> use<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:47.670> do<00:01:47.940> that<00:01:48.120> to

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
different units we can use to do that to

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.850 
different units we can use to do that to
handle<00:01:48.810> them<00:01:48.930> so<00:01:49.170> these<00:01:49.290> are<00:01:49.350> spinners

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
handle them so these are spinners

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.730 
handle them so these are spinners
experience<00:01:50.850> will<00:01:50.940> spit<00:01:51.180> over<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.570> wall<00:01:51.750> at

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
experience will spit over the wall at

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.580 
experience will spit over the wall at
the<00:01:53.040> at<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.310> gun<00:01:53.550> fires<00:01:53.760> behind<00:01:54.090> it<00:01:54.500> so<00:01:55.500> the

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
the at the gun fires behind it so the

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.740 
the at the gun fires behind it so the
next<00:01:55.620> unit<00:01:55.920> I<00:01:56.040> can<00:01:56.100> get<00:01:56.340> is<00:01:56.520> a<00:01:56.550> proof<00:01:57.270> and<00:01:57.600> what

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
next unit I can get is a proof and what

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.660 
next unit I can get is a proof and what
brutes<00:01:57.960> will<00:01:58.110> do<00:01:58.259> is<00:01:58.410> brutal<00:01:58.890> will<00:01:59.190> push<00:01:59.460> their

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
brutes will do is brutal will push their

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:00.740 
brutes will do is brutal will push their
way<00:01:59.700> to<00:01:59.790> the<00:01:59.940> front<00:02:00.090> of<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.330> Horde<00:02:00.540> and

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
way to the front of the Horde and

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.390 
way to the front of the Horde and
they're<00:02:01.229> really<00:02:01.470> great<00:02:01.560> at<00:02:01.770> destroying<00:02:02.130> like

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:02.400 
they're really great at destroying like

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.510 
they're really great at destroying like
walls<00:02:02.670> and<00:02:02.970> buildings

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.040 

now<00:02:07.390> we're<00:02:07.479> getting<00:02:07.539> close<00:02:07.780> for<00:02:07.960> the<00:02:08.019> first

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
now we're getting close for the first

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.680 
now we're getting close for the first
hospital<00:02:08.649> and<00:02:08.979> the<00:02:09.519> hospital<00:02:09.550> is<00:02:10.119> full<00:02:10.420> of

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
hospital and the hospital is full of

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.330 
hospital and the hospital is full of
humans<00:02:11.050> which<00:02:11.230> is<00:02:11.379> great<00:02:11.590> for<00:02:11.620> us<00:02:11.830> as<00:02:12.010> zombies

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
humans which is great for us as zombies

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:13.770 
humans which is great for us as zombies
because<00:02:12.459> we<00:02:12.610> can<00:02:12.730> actually<00:02:12.879> convert<00:02:13.360> all<00:02:13.629> of

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
because we can actually convert all of

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.070 
because we can actually convert all of
them<00:02:13.930> into<00:02:14.319> more<00:02:14.530> zombies<00:02:15.900> so<00:02:16.900> what<00:02:16.989> will

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
them into more zombies so what will

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.570 
them into more zombies so what will
happen<00:02:17.110> here<00:02:17.530> is<00:02:17.620> once<00:02:17.830> the<00:02:18.040> once<00:02:18.489> the

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
happen here is once the once the

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.550 
happen here is once the once the
hospital<00:02:18.940> goes<00:02:19.090> down<00:02:19.330> I<00:02:19.660> can<00:02:20.230> putting<00:02:20.440> some

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
hospital goes down I can putting some

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.330 
hospital goes down I can putting some
infected<00:02:21.040> as<00:02:21.819> in<00:02:21.970> vectors<00:02:22.830> go<00:02:23.830> go<00:02:23.980> over<00:02:24.099> to<00:02:24.190> all

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
infected as in vectors go go over to all

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.640 
infected as in vectors go go over to all
the<00:02:24.580> dead<00:02:24.790> humans<00:02:25.209> and<00:02:25.959> just<00:02:26.170> convert<00:02:26.500> them

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
the dead humans and just convert them

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.710 
the dead humans and just convert them
into<00:02:26.739> more<00:02:27.040> zombies<00:02:27.459> to<00:02:27.940> grow<00:02:28.120> the<00:02:28.299> horde<00:02:28.510> even

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
into more zombies to grow the horde even

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.080 
into more zombies to grow the horde even
bigger<00:02:29.160> so<00:02:30.160> some<00:02:30.430> of<00:02:30.459> the<00:02:30.549> basically<00:02:30.970> the

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
bigger so some of the basically the

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.330 
bigger so some of the basically the
strategy<00:02:31.540> is<00:02:31.620> deciding<00:02:32.620> what<00:02:32.739> units<00:02:33.069> to<00:02:33.160> bring

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
strategy is deciding what units to bring

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:34.860 
strategy is deciding what units to bring
in<00:02:33.430> on<00:02:33.549> the<00:02:33.670> mission<00:02:34.000> and<00:02:34.120> then<00:02:34.330> when<00:02:34.510> to<00:02:34.690> use

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
in on the mission and then when to use

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.800 
in on the mission and then when to use
them<00:02:34.900> throughout<00:02:35.379> the<00:02:35.620> mission<00:02:35.860> time<00:02:36.660> we<00:02:37.660> try

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
them throughout the mission time we try

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.120 
them throughout the mission time we try
to<00:02:37.870> keep<00:02:38.019> missions<00:02:38.319> relatively<00:02:38.769> short

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
to keep missions relatively short

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.850 
to keep missions relatively short
between<00:02:39.519> three<00:02:39.730> to<00:02:39.760> five<00:02:39.849> minutes<00:02:40.329> and<00:02:41.290> they

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
between three to five minutes and they

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.009 
between three to five minutes and they
vary<00:02:42.099> depending<00:02:42.549> on<00:02:42.549> the<00:02:42.670> type<00:02:42.940> of<00:02:43.019> objectives

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:44.019 
vary depending on the type of objectives

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:45.120 
vary depending on the type of objectives
for<00:02:44.110> each<00:02:44.170> one<00:02:44.440> but<00:02:44.650> this<00:02:44.799> one<00:02:44.860> is<00:02:45.099> a

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
for each one but this one is a

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.220 
for each one but this one is a
destruction<00:02:45.519> Lucy<00:02:46.510> we're<00:02:46.630> coming<00:02:46.840> up<00:02:46.900> to<00:02:46.930> sort

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
destruction Lucy we're coming up to sort

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.009 
destruction Lucy we're coming up to sort
of<00:02:47.290> the<00:02:47.380> last<00:02:47.560> stand<00:02:47.860> of<00:02:48.010> the<00:02:48.480> other<00:02:49.480> survivors

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
of the last stand of the other survivors

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:51.900 
of the last stand of the other survivors
there's<00:02:50.709> a<00:02:50.739> couple<00:02:50.950> of<00:02:51.010> special<00:02:51.370> survivors<00:02:51.790> in

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
there's a couple of special survivors in

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:53.250 
there's a couple of special survivors in
here<00:02:52.030> with<00:02:52.150> chainsaws<00:02:52.599> you<00:02:53.019> have<00:02:53.140> to<00:02:53.200> be

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
here with chainsaws you have to be

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:54.479 
here with chainsaws you have to be
careful<00:02:53.440> of<00:02:53.680> them<00:02:53.799> because<00:02:54.069> they<00:02:54.220> can<00:02:54.370> do<00:02:54.459> a

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
careful of them because they can do a

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:57.000 
careful of them because they can do a
lot<00:02:54.760> of<00:02:54.790> damage<00:02:55.090> to<00:02:55.239> any<00:02:55.480> meal<00:02:55.750> zombies<00:02:56.260> but

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
lot of damage to any meal zombies but

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.259 
lot of damage to any meal zombies but
luckily<00:02:57.190> we<00:02:57.400> have<00:02:57.489> some<00:02:57.670> spinners<00:02:58.000> and<00:02:58.150> some

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269 
luckily we have some spinners and some

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:02.530 
luckily we have some spinners and some
other<00:02:58.360> guys<00:02:58.540> who<00:02:58.660> can<00:02:58.780> take<00:02:58.930> them<00:02:59.079> out

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.300 

so<00:03:03.140> now<00:03:03.230> all<00:03:03.260> we<00:03:03.409> have<00:03:03.590> to<00:03:03.620> do<00:03:03.799> is<00:03:03.920> finish<00:03:04.069> off

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
so now all we have to do is finish off

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:05.679 
so now all we have to do is finish off
their<00:03:04.459> meeting<00:03:04.790> survivors<00:03:05.390> the<00:03:05.510> poor

00:03:05.679 --> 00:03:05.689 
their meeting survivors the poor

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:08.289 
their meeting survivors the poor
citizens<00:03:05.930> that<00:03:06.230> will<00:03:06.319> be<00:03:06.439> left<00:03:06.590> in<00:03:06.799> here<00:03:07.299> we

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:08.299 
citizens that will be left in here we

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:10.240 
citizens that will be left in here we
use<00:03:08.329> some<00:03:08.629> runners<00:03:08.810> to<00:03:09.049> just<00:03:09.230> run<00:03:09.409> so<00:03:10.099> at<00:03:10.159> the

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
use some runners to just run so at the

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.849 
use some runners to just run so at the
end<00:03:10.280> of<00:03:10.459> every<00:03:10.670> mission<00:03:11.170> you<00:03:12.170> get<00:03:12.319> a<00:03:12.349> new<00:03:12.409> unit

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:12.859 
end of every mission you get a new unit

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:14.170 
end of every mission you get a new unit
you<00:03:13.010> either<00:03:13.159> infect<00:03:13.730> them<00:03:13.849> if<00:03:13.969> you're<00:03:14.090> the

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
you either infect them if you're the
