00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.670
 Personal speech beauty here is the babu and yes 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:14.849
 my pc arrived arrived yesterday a day later 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:18.840
 The birthday was on day 4 and it's very good 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:23.430
 if the computer one and we go to the 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:25.289
 settings is very much too much 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.500
 very different from my 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:34.230
 my other computer is a difference 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:37.920
 brutal of more than double of triple 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.930
 smaller frames better than other 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.960
 very very very much very very much 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:46.800
 much much better even 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:51.899
 so let's start windows windows ed 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:56.309
 chan windows 7 premium home that is not the 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:01:00.030
 better than the ultimate is the best but the 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.800
 climate is very good very good even 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.930
 I think this is that in addition to the two 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.200
 ultimate oppress 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:11.909
 I did not see any difference I think 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:14.880
 import is 64-bit or 32-bit 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.490
 It makes a difference but the rest will not 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.950
 interfere with anything performance 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:24.180
 then you who are in doubt and can 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:28.640
 pick up the premium home that is ball show 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:35.070
