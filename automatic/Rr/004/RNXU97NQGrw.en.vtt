spots<00:01:42.869> man<00:01:43.110> argus<00:01:43.979> genius<00:01:44.490> but<00:01:44.729> it<00:01:44.880> still<00:01:45.119> goes

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
spots man argus genius but it still goes

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:46.880 
spots man argus genius but it still goes
with<00:01:45.750> why<00:01:45.899> I<00:01:45.930> said<00:01:46.170> before<00:01:46.290> you<00:01:46.560> know<00:01:46.710> that

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
with why I said before you know that

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.800 
with why I said before you know that
it's<00:01:47.040> like<00:01:47.220> you<00:01:47.850> don't<00:01:48.060> really<00:01:48.210> look<00:01:48.450> up<00:01:48.630> that

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
it's like you don't really look up that

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.240 
it's like you don't really look up that
often<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:49.320> it's<00:01:49.439> highly<00:01:49.590> likely<00:01:49.710> they<00:01:50.189> were

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
often and it's highly likely they were

00:01:50.250 --> 00:02:03.950 
often and it's highly likely they were
above<00:01:50.549> us<00:02:01.820> again<00:02:02.820> eighty-seven<00:02:03.450> percent<00:02:03.479> I

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
above us again eighty-seven percent I

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.359 
above us again eighty-seven percent I
got<00:02:04.110> hit<00:02:04.229> by<00:02:04.350> a<00:02:04.380> flashbang<00:02:04.890> which<00:02:05.039> means<00:02:05.250> they

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
got hit by a flashbang which means they

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.130 
got hit by a flashbang which means they
are<00:02:05.549> in<00:02:05.789> the<00:02:05.939> area<00:02:07.190> there<00:02:08.190> somewhere<00:02:08.700> near<00:02:09.140> not

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
are in the area there somewhere near not

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.650 
are in the area there somewhere near not
sure<00:02:10.410> where<00:02:10.709> but<00:02:11.269> obviously<00:02:12.269> I<00:02:12.330> guess<00:02:12.450> it<00:02:12.569> hit

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
sure where but obviously I guess it hit

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.970 
sure where but obviously I guess it hit
directly<00:02:12.930> with<00:02:13.200> a<00:02:13.230> flashbang<00:02:13.739> and<00:02:13.920> they

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
directly with a flashbang and they

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.759 
directly with a flashbang and they
managed<00:02:14.220> to<00:02:14.250> kill<00:02:14.610> me<00:02:14.790> and<00:02:15.410> they<00:02:16.410> got<00:02:16.620> the

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:16.769 
managed to kill me and they got the

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:24.050 
managed to kill me and they got the
point<00:02:20.720> those<00:02:21.720> flash<00:02:21.989> bangs<00:02:22.319> are<00:02:23.060> pretty

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
point those flash bangs are pretty

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:31.759 
point those flash bangs are pretty
strong<00:02:30.080> so<00:02:31.080> they're<00:02:31.230> probably<00:02:31.260> going<00:02:31.560> to<00:02:31.650> go

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
strong so they're probably going to go

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:33.800 
strong so they're probably going to go
for<00:02:31.950> point<00:02:32.190> a<00:02:32.370> because<00:02:33.269> it's<00:02:33.450> the<00:02:33.510> furthest

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
for point a because it's the furthest

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.720 
for point a because it's the furthest
away<00:02:33.959> from<00:02:34.110> us<00:02:34.530> but<00:02:34.739> it<00:02:34.980> could<00:02:35.130> go<00:02:35.220> to<00:02:35.340> point<00:02:35.580> B

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
away from us but it could go to point B

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.910 
away from us but it could go to point B
to<00:02:38.510> all<00:02:39.510> right<00:02:39.780> way<00:02:39.959> definitely<00:02:40.440> limpa<00:02:40.650> point

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
to all right way definitely limpa point

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.500 
to all right way definitely limpa point
B<00:02:41.130> as<00:02:41.900> kpop<00:02:42.900> gets<00:02:43.200> gunned<00:02:43.470> down<00:02:43.760> kind<00:02:44.760> of<00:02:44.880> half

terminals are in go but eyes open for
spooks<00:03:05.740> and<00:03:06.740> that<00:03:07.370> would<00:03:07.580> be<00:03:07.610> where<00:03:08.030> kpop<00:03:08.570> was

fortunately<00:03:17.210> though<00:03:17.540> at<00:03:17.960> this<00:03:18.500> point<00:03:18.620> we've

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
fortunately though at this point we've

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.550 
fortunately though at this point we've
figured<00:03:19.190> out<00:03:19.400> a<00:03:19.460> good<00:03:19.820> strategy<00:03:20.150> is<00:03:20.660> to<00:03:21.260> put

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
figured out a good strategy is to put

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.730 
figured out a good strategy is to put
down<00:03:21.680> at<00:03:21.800> least<00:03:21.920> one<00:03:22.130> proximity<00:03:22.760> mine<00:03:22.970> on<00:03:23.740> the

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:24.740 
down at least one proximity mine on the

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:28.150 
down at least one proximity mine on the
hacking<00:03:25.370> point<00:03:26.110> and<00:03:27.110> so<00:03:27.740> if<00:03:27.800> somebody<00:03:28.070> goes

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
hacking point and so if somebody goes

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.130 
hacking point and so if somebody goes
the<00:03:28.280> Hackett<00:03:28.670> they<00:03:29.210> almost<00:03:29.390> guaranteed<00:03:29.960> run

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
the Hackett they almost guaranteed run

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:31.810 
the Hackett they almost guaranteed run
right<00:03:30.320> into<00:03:30.350> and<00:03:30.680> die<00:03:30.890> and<00:03:31.250> while<00:03:31.610> there<00:03:31.790> are

right into and die and while there are

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.640 
right into and die and while there are
ways<00:03:32.300> to<00:03:32.330> get<00:03:32.660> rid<00:03:32.720> of<00:03:32.870> the<00:03:33.020> mind<00:03:33.260> you<00:03:33.500> can

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
ways to get rid of the mind you can

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.470 
ways to get rid of the mind you can
shoot<00:03:33.860> them<00:03:34.130> you<00:03:34.610> get<00:03:34.730> thrown<00:03:34.940> something<00:03:35.300> else

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
shoot them you get thrown something else

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.680 
shoot them you get thrown something else
I<00:03:35.570> can<00:03:35.690> amp<00:03:35.870> Renee<00:03:36.080> to<00:03:36.140> get<00:03:36.290> rid<00:03:36.410> of<00:03:36.440> them<00:03:36.620> etc

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 
I can amp Renee to get rid of them etc

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:40.210 
I can amp Renee to get rid of them etc
they<00:03:38.690> are<00:03:39.080> generally<00:03:39.740> not<00:03:39.800> something<00:03:40.160> you

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
they are generally not something you

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:41.470 
they are generally not something you
really<00:03:40.370> think<00:03:40.550> about<00:03:40.730> when<00:03:40.850> you're<00:03:40.970> rushing

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
really think about when you're rushing

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.540 
really think about when you're rushing
in<00:03:42.020> to<00:03:42.080> try<00:03:42.440> and<00:03:42.470> hack<00:03:42.680> the<00:03:42.830> point<00:03:43.040> as<00:03:43.160> fast<00:03:43.370> as

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:43.550 
in to try and hack the point as fast as

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:45.610 
in to try and hack the point as fast as
possible<00:03:43.790> and<00:03:44.240> so<00:03:44.690> people<00:03:44.840> eat<00:03:45.140> it<00:03:45.290> on<00:03:45.380> them

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
possible and so people eat it on them

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.700 
possible and so people eat it on them
pretty<00:03:46.000> continually<00:03:47.050> so<00:03:48.050> we're<00:03:48.200> in<00:03:48.320> point<00:03:48.560> a

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:48.710 
pretty continually so we're in point a

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:51.280 
pretty continually so we're in point a
right<00:03:49.010> now<00:03:49.540> trying<00:03:50.540> to<00:03:50.630> find<00:03:50.840> out<00:03:51.050> where<00:03:51.140> they

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
right now trying to find out where they

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.830 
right now trying to find out where they
could<00:03:51.440> possibly<00:03:51.770> be<00:03:51.980> I<00:03:52.340> just<00:03:53.090> literally<00:03:53.660> blew

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
could possibly be I just literally blew

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.450 
could possibly be I just literally blew
myself<00:03:54.020> up<00:03:54.290> with<00:03:54.350> my<00:03:54.440> own<00:03:54.650> grenade<00:03:54.980> because

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:55.460 
myself up with my own grenade because

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:57.640 
myself up with my own grenade because
that's<00:03:55.700> totally<00:03:55.940> a<00:03:56.180> gameplay<00:03:57.110> tactic<00:03:57.530> that's

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
that's totally a gameplay tactic that's

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:59.950 
that's totally a gameplay tactic that's
completely<00:03:58.280> intentional<00:03:58.610> you<00:03:59.090> know<00:03:59.210> well

00:03:59.950 --> 00:03:59.960 
completely intentional you know well

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:02.530 
completely intentional you know well
yourself<00:04:00.260> while<00:04:00.380> you're<00:04:00.500> on<00:04:00.650> your<00:04:00.800> name<00:04:01.540> then

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
yourself while you're on your name then

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.190 
yourself while you're on your name then
that<00:04:02.720> just<00:04:02.900> I<00:04:04.720> don't<00:04:05.720> know<00:04:05.870> why<00:04:06.140> I<00:04:06.170> just

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:06.200 
that just I don't know why I just

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.120 
that just I don't know why I just
thought<00:04:06.740> of<00:04:07.070> a<00:04:07.459> fail<00:04:08.060> whale<00:04:08.360> but<00:04:09.200> that's<00:04:09.890> why

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.130 
thought of a fail whale but that's why

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:15.960 
thought of a fail whale but that's why
there<00:04:11.120> you<00:04:11.270> go<00:04:11.560> one<00:04:12.560> of<00:04:12.650> my<00:04:14.290> friends<00:04:15.290> I

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.330 
hope of doing that

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.149 
hope of doing that
and<00:04:41.810> by<00:04:42.229> the<00:04:42.289> way<00:04:42.500> because<00:04:42.770> people<00:04:43.099> always
