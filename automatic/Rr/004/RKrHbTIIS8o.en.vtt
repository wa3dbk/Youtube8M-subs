another it's a really easy process and

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.350 
another it's a really easy process and
basically<00:00:08.010> designed<00:00:08.639> to<00:00:08.760> fill<00:00:08.940> up<00:00:09.030> a<00:00:09.150> little

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
basically designed to fill up a little

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.390 
basically designed to fill up a little
pocket<00:00:09.630> can<00:00:09.960> such<00:00:10.200> as<00:00:10.349> this<00:00:10.530> little<00:00:11.010> freebie<00:00:11.370> I

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
pocket can such as this little freebie I

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.780 
pocket can such as this little freebie I
got<00:00:11.700> but<00:00:12.330> uh<00:00:12.360> first<00:00:13.170> off<00:00:13.349> you<00:00:13.530> can<00:00:13.769> use<00:00:13.799> female

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
got but uh first off you can use female

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.779 
got but uh first off you can use female
cans<00:00:15.210> two<00:00:15.750> male<00:00:15.900> cans<00:00:16.340> like<00:00:17.340> painters<00:00:17.640> touch

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
cans two male cans like painters touch

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.160 
cans two male cans like painters touch
and<00:00:17.970> stuff<00:00:18.150> like<00:00:18.270> that<00:00:18.480> but<00:00:18.840> that<00:00:18.990> doesn't

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
and stuff like that but that doesn't

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.320 
and stuff like that but that doesn't
really<00:00:19.289> work<00:00:19.529> as<00:00:19.710> well<00:00:19.920> I've<00:00:20.910> also<00:00:21.090> seen

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
really work as well I've also seen

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:22.820 
really work as well I've also seen
people<00:00:21.390> use<00:00:21.750> like<00:00:21.869> sec<00:00:22.140> Kappa<00:00:22.380> doctors

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
people use like sec Kappa doctors

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.460 
people use like sec Kappa doctors
between<00:00:23.250> cans<00:00:23.820> to<00:00:24.449> get<00:00:24.900> them<00:00:25.050> to<00:00:25.140> work<00:00:25.230> like

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
between cans to get them to work like

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.529 
between cans to get them to work like
that<00:00:25.500> but<00:00:26.070> this<00:00:26.189> is<00:00:26.369> a<00:00:26.400> pretty<00:00:26.640> sure<00:00:27.300> proof

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
that but this is a pretty sure proof

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.710 
that but this is a pretty sure proof
method<00:00:28.019> and<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:29.310> best<00:00:29.519> way<00:00:29.670> I've<00:00:29.820> found<00:00:29.849> so<00:00:30.689> I

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
method and the best way I've found so I

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.900 
method and the best way I've found so I
just<00:00:31.140> want<00:00:31.320> to<00:00:31.380> get<00:00:31.470> to<00:00:31.529> needle<00:00:32.189> caps<00:00:32.399> and<00:00:32.730> they

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
just want to get to needle caps and they

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.190 
just want to get to needle caps and they
can<00:00:33.059> actually<00:00:33.270> be<00:00:33.480> punched<00:00:34.110> together<00:00:34.850> into<00:00:35.850> a

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:36.200 
can actually be punched together into a

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.240 
can actually be punched together into a
one<00:00:37.200> kind<00:00:37.440> of<00:00:37.500> cap<00:00:37.710> system

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
one kind of cap system

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.610 
one kind of cap system
I've<00:00:38.430> seen<00:00:38.879> this<00:00:39.000> tried<00:00:39.329> with<00:00:39.570> like<00:00:39.719> wd-40<00:00:40.500> uh

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
I've seen this tried with like wd-40 uh

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.880 
I've seen this tried with like wd-40 uh
like<00:00:41.280> paint<00:00:42.000> cans<00:00:42.239> because<00:00:42.660> uh<00:00:42.690> just<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.680> tips

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
like paint cans because uh just the tips

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.799 
like paint cans because uh just the tips
of<00:00:44.040> those<00:00:44.129> have<00:00:44.370> like<00:00:44.520> a<00:00:44.640> straw<00:00:44.969> on<00:00:45.149> it<00:00:45.300> but

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
of those have like a straw on it but

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.479 
of those have like a straw on it but
this<00:00:46.170> is<00:00:46.320> definitely<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.770> best<00:00:46.950> method<00:00:47.340> I've

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
this is definitely the best method I've

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.330 
this is definitely the best method I've
found<00:00:48.270> when<00:00:48.600> working<00:00:48.899> with<00:00:49.020> it<00:00:49.170> so<00:00:49.680> basically

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
found when working with it so basically

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.810 
found when working with it so basically
just<00:00:50.550> pop<00:00:50.850> one<00:00:51.090> into<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:51.930> other<00:00:51.960> and<00:00:52.820> then

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
just pop one into the other and then

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.160 
just pop one into the other and then
onto<00:00:54.090> your<00:00:54.420> can<00:00:54.860> you<00:00:55.860> can<00:00:56.190> put<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.969> one<00:00:57.930> can

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
onto your can you can put the one can

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.810 
onto your can you can put the one can
that<00:00:58.379> you<00:00:58.469> want<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.829> paint<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.100> go<00:00:59.250> into<00:00:59.520> so<00:00:59.699> in

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
that you want the paint to go into so in

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.490 
that you want the paint to go into so in
this<00:00:59.910> case<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.270> pocket<00:01:00.600> can<00:01:00.780> into<00:01:01.170> like<00:01:01.469> a

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
this case the pocket can into like a

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.959 
this case the pocket can into like a
freezer<00:01:01.829> or<00:01:01.980> something<00:01:02.430> if<00:01:02.550> it<00:01:02.699> has<00:01:02.730> some

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
freezer or something if it has some

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.210 
freezer or something if it has some
paint<00:01:03.180> in<00:01:03.300> it<00:01:03.420> so<00:01:03.840> that<00:01:03.960> way<00:01:04.110> it<00:01:04.350> is<00:01:04.500> a<00:01:04.680> lot<00:01:04.949> more

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
paint in it so that way it is a lot more

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.899 
paint in it so that way it is a lot more
low-pressure<00:01:05.729> than<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.210> other<00:01:06.390> can<00:01:07.490> so<00:01:08.490> the

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
low-pressure than the other can so the

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.910 
low-pressure than the other can so the
paint<00:01:09.150> wants<00:01:09.479> to<00:01:09.600> mix<00:01:09.780> to<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:09.990> right<00:01:10.200> one<00:01:10.409> so

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
paint wants to mix to the right one so

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.859 
paint wants to mix to the right one so
basically<00:01:11.280> make<00:01:11.549> sure<00:01:11.580> both<00:01:11.850> cancer<00:01:12.240> well

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
basically make sure both cancer well

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.270 
basically make sure both cancer well
this<00:01:13.260> can't<00:01:13.470> doesn't<00:01:13.680> have<00:01:13.770> any<00:01:13.860> paint<00:01:14.040> in<00:01:14.189> it

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
this can't doesn't have any paint in it

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.649 
this can't doesn't have any paint in it
but<00:01:14.490> make<00:01:14.760> sure<00:01:14.880> your<00:01:15.060> can<00:01:15.330> that<00:01:15.570> you're

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
but make sure your can that you're

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:21.109 
but make sure your can that you're
mixing<00:01:15.990> from<00:01:16.590> is<00:01:17.430> all<00:01:17.580> shaken<00:01:17.970> up<00:01:18.530> and<00:01:20.119> once

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
mixing from is all shaken up and once

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.149 
mixing from is all shaken up and once
that<00:01:21.210> make<00:01:21.780> sure<00:01:21.930> you<00:01:22.110> screw<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.770> tip<00:01:22.979> on

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
that make sure you screw the tip on

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.670 
that make sure you screw the tip on
really<00:01:23.970> tight<00:01:24.150> make<00:01:24.840> sure<00:01:24.869> it's<00:01:25.140> good<00:01:25.530> to<00:01:25.560> go

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
really tight make sure it's good to go

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.260 
really tight make sure it's good to go
and<00:01:25.979> then<00:01:26.430> you're<00:01:26.640> going<00:01:26.759> to<00:01:26.850> want<00:01:27.030> to<00:01:27.060> press

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
and then you're going to want to press

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.749 
and then you're going to want to press
down<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.860> can<00:01:28.860> you<00:01:29.040> want<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.340> paint<00:01:29.549> to<00:01:29.579> go

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
down the can you want the paint to go

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.640 
down the can you want the paint to go
into<00:01:30.090> first<00:01:30.390> I<00:01:30.600> like<00:01:30.750> to<00:01:30.780> put<00:01:30.960> mine<00:01:31.110> on<00:01:31.140> top<00:01:31.470> as

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
into first I like to put mine on top as

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.380 
into first I like to put mine on top as
well<00:01:31.680> so<00:01:32.009> this<00:01:32.130> one's<00:01:32.340> feeding<00:01:32.790> up<00:01:32.939> into<00:01:33.240> it

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
well so this one's feeding up into it

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.420 
well so this one's feeding up into it
because<00:01:33.840> if<00:01:34.110> you<00:01:34.259> off<00:01:34.470> flip<00:01:34.680> this<00:01:34.829> can<00:01:35.100> over

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
because if you off flip this can over

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.890 
because if you off flip this can over
the<00:01:35.909> straw<00:01:36.299> is<00:01:36.680> on<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:38.100> bottom<00:01:38.400> of<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.549> can

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900 
the straw is on the bottom of the can

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.929 
the straw is on the bottom of the can
which<00:01:39.900> now<00:01:40.229> doesn't<00:01:41.220> have<00:01:41.310> any<00:01:41.430> paint<00:01:41.700> around

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
which now doesn't have any paint around

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.249 
which now doesn't have any paint around

until you know I get a good good sense
in<00:02:20.370> there<00:02:20.520> and<00:02:20.730> then<00:02:20.820> it<00:02:21.030> kind<00:02:21.570> of<00:02:21.630> pops<00:02:21.840> off

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
in there and then it kind of pops off

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.250

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.490 
sure to spray that out with um you know
just<00:02:30.660> another<00:02:30.930> can<00:02:31.310> to<00:02:32.310> ensure<00:02:32.640> that<00:02:32.670> it's<00:02:33.090> not

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
just another can to ensure that it's not

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.720 
just another can to ensure that it's not
going<00:02:34.500> to<00:02:34.560> get<00:02:34.650> clogged<00:02:34.920> up<00:02:35.130> because<00:02:35.430> I've<00:02:35.580> had

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
going to get clogged up because I've had

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.250 
going to get clogged up because I've had
the<00:02:35.850> stems<00:02:36.090> of<00:02:36.270> those<00:02:36.390> get<00:02:36.630> clogged<00:02:36.870> up<00:02:37.050> pretty

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
the stems of those get clogged up pretty

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.050 
the stems of those get clogged up pretty
easily<00:02:37.560> so<00:02:38.520> I'm<00:02:38.580> just<00:02:38.670> going<00:02:38.820> to<00:02:38.850> grab<00:02:39.030> another

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
easily so I'm just going to grab another

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:54.770 
easily so I'm just going to grab another
cap<00:02:39.570> and<00:02:39.870> test<00:02:40.590> this<00:02:40.710> out

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.600 

so<00:02:55.440> there<00:02:55.560> you<00:02:55.620> have<00:02:55.680> it<00:02:55.800> you<00:02:55.980> can<00:02:56.010> kind<00:02:56.310> of<00:02:56.430> see

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
so there you have it you can kind of see

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.160 
so there you have it you can kind of see
that<00:02:56.730> it's<00:02:56.910> definitely<00:02:57.090> not<00:02:57.330> the<00:02:57.480> same<00:02:57.870> color

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
that it's definitely not the same color

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.040 
that it's definitely not the same color
as<00:02:58.440> this<00:02:59.370> exact<00:02:59.760> can<00:03:00.000> so<00:03:00.630> I'll<00:03:00.690> just<00:03:00.810> throw<00:03:00.900> a

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
as this exact can so I'll just throw a

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:02.840 
as this exact can so I'll just throw a
cap<00:03:01.230> on<00:03:01.380> this<00:03:01.560> one<00:03:01.740> sheet<00:03:01.920> to<00:03:02.130> show<00:03:02.490> you<00:03:02.550> the

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
cap on this one sheet to show you the

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:06.770 
cap on this one sheet to show you the
kind<00:03:03.660> of<00:03:03.720> difference<00:03:04.080> because<00:03:05.180> you<00:03:06.180> can<00:03:06.330> see<00:03:06.570> I

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
kind of difference because you can see I

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.300 
kind of difference because you can see I
had<00:03:07.170> some<00:03:07.380> other<00:03:07.530> color<00:03:07.770> in<00:03:07.920> there<00:03:08.040> so<00:03:08.190> this

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
had some other color in there so this

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:09.830 
had some other color in there so this
can<00:03:08.490> actually<00:03:08.610> work<00:03:08.790> to<00:03:09.060> mix<00:03:09.270> your<00:03:09.390> own<00:03:09.450> paint

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840
