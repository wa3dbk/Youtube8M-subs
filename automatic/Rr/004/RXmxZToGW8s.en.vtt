 do not make the contributions 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:07.189
 that by law must perform 

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:10.920
 any citizen in our country not only the products 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:12.339
 so 

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:16.179
 bad we can cut the route demand rule of law 

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:21.759
 and not have any civil liability violating block corresponds that is like 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:23.460

 must be registered in April for you to see participate but Peruvian cabinet 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:32.169
 will donate loved is the content of what the proper 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.130
 should be given to the content to this explanation because the society that 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.300
 is watching and listening 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.080
 speak of number speak of blow speak of d 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.260
 ayala and of course seven no no to the house a lot to envy 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.510
 not in a football symbol values ​​emergency services spoke of 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.980
 blow I think it's a metaphor in the sense that you're acting 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.270
 outside the framework of the law and not necessarily the increase in unemployment 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.640
 the valence did not lose him of strong blow 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.610
 the president of the cne concretely by itself or by not 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.880
 the concept of tax withholding by the government for nothing is 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.970
 min is a system in and solidary that will benefit the group of 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:16.780
 Argentines 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.370
 churches 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:21.270
 the previous one at the same time as you that I can answer 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.380
 quickly 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.130
 Toronto time 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:26.090
 the oil 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.010
 or we talked about maintenance murcia the pressure of no time that I 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.649
 of place 

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:32.090
 says oligarchy 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.500
 and its vaccine oligarchy only hurt the country are coup plotters is an expression 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.540
 and respect for what they have missed 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.140
 he just enjoyed the generosity of repeating out loud 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.490
 therefore the president of all Argentines 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.730
 with another mood it was settled with one thing less respect of the laws 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:50.330
 the power to audit rights 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:51.710
 it's not news the ce 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.740
 was retentions that are export duties is conceived by the 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.310
 national constitution and the laws somewhat less 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.789
 the rally was transferred through the superpowers to the executive branch 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.579
 configuring what the national film constitution in an article like 

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:08.299
 constant pressure to peace 

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:09.330
 says that the 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.179
 the parliamentarians that of the inputs 

00:02:12.179 --> 00:02:16.069
 seven goals in the executive world chau fienza our from xalapa that his body 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:17.829
 when her boyfriend does not 

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:21.009
 There is no consequence of this lack of institutional respect and respect for 

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:22.529
 constitution laws 

00:02:22.529 --> 00:02:26.140
 has been disastrous for the country because a conflict is actually mounted 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.219
 it is a very bad measurement taken 

00:02:29.219 --> 00:02:32.209
 also an expert as part of the field and captured a month 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:33.309
 dialoguing 

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:35.169
 with the president 

00:02:35.169 --> 00:02:38.579
 they were chatting without the central theme of the conflict being touched 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:42.509
 just the last day and in a very didactic way and that's when there was no margin 

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:43.529
 for something else 

00:02:43.529 --> 00:02:47.539
 and now again the president has asked for extradition we will not talk to 

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:48.749
 the field of debt 

00:02:48.749 --> 00:02:52.749
 has lifted for now they have everything hopefully they must pay a 

00:02:52.749 --> 00:02:56.109
 concrete proposal the problems of the people but there is one more point 

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:57.989
 hence, it seems important to me to touch 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:01.229
 in front of a representative the works 

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:03.050
 he who has the responsibility 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:06.440
 about the case both the work in black is a problem not of the field in all the 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.650
 argentina according to the official statistics of the indec de moreno there is more 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.619
 40% of workers in black 

00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:16.289
 there is no one responsible for your government that the clouds five years ago 

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:19.289
 the sum of political power that has a majority in both houses 

00:03:19.839 --> 00:03:23.509
 everything what the oficialismo does in favor of the same the red and black skate the 

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:27.629
 position said parliamentary and civic coalition policy the 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:30.989
 government has to take its responsible but unload the person responsible for the 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:34.169
 work in black and control what the government and five years ago are there 

00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:37.169
 and I'll pass it as long as it has gotten 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:42.299
 talking five children an opposition government d the redistribution of the 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:43.869
 wealth in terms of robinho 

00:03:43.869 --> 00:03:48.139
 when what he says we take away from the rich for which the mind establishes the 

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:50.049
 first explanation to the rich 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:52.529
 what I do 

00:03:52.529 --> 00:03:53.910
 the million homes 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:58.050
 the ipax ions in bonds in a fixed term nyse ual gain of between two months 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:59.819
 even when paying taxes 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:02.439
 in Argentina 

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:05.839
 if I put it in the field he paid 35 percent retention 

00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:08.749
 now with the modification 44% 

00:04:08.749 --> 00:04:12.219
 but now the rich remove it they do not liquidate Cristóbal lópez the one who 

00:04:12.219 --> 00:04:15.379
 has the Palermo slot machine who has even been 15 to 

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:16.000
 fifteen 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.099
 will renew 

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:21.189
 before leaving the presidency the term of the concession until the year 2032 

00:04:21.189 --> 00:04:22.180
 that message 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.920
 Perez clarified rifles ak the field that that most advanced productive sector of the 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:26.410
 country 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:29.569
 composed mostly by small groups 

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:32.810
 And it is a lie also to the poor with serenity to the poor 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:36.969
 the Argentine would not have an index of indigence today that superior 

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:40.779
 to the record of the decade of the '70 this does not say it I say it the indec de morena the 

00:04:40.779 --> 00:04:43.250
 record of the vega 77 points 7 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:45.919
 by its primigenia be because we are above 8% 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:47.569
 I did the indec de Moreno 

00:04:47.569 --> 00:04:48.689
 we would not have 

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:49.930
 neither 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:54.740
 one of his band a gap between the 10% who send 10% kemp that those who 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:55.710
 do in Argentina 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:58.949
 it's still around a 28 1 as a precondition 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:02.710
 and we would not have what we have in recent months 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:04.240
 galloping inflation 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.870
 and has said that last year Argentina has the sad rector of 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:11.839
 have a Chinese-type growth of the clock around 8 9% 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:16.130
 an increase in poverty and indigence and tango by the first above the 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:17.710
 30% when computing 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:21.979
 real inflation that is higher than 20% then they do not take away from the rich my 

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:23.819
 league help the poor 

00:05:23.819 --> 00:05:27.319
 We are honored with the presence of the presence, although it has to achieve the coverage of 

00:05:27.319 --> 00:05:30.360
 the proof for that reason the field proposal and for use 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:34.259
 in the seismic collision we are supporting the one that does not seem reasonable by 

00:05:34.259 --> 00:05:39.009
 now it goes until the remaining 6 united experts of the next word what 

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:39.870
 so
