00:00:16.033 --> 00:00:18.867
The Boo in the Shoe

00:00:18.867 --> 00:00:24.950
By Kuzhali Manickavel

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:29.367
Have you ever seen boos?

00:00:29.367 --> 00:00:31.867
They are playful creatures

00:00:31.867 --> 00:00:35.617
you think you see

00:00:35.617 --> 00:00:37.617
under your bed at night.

00:00:37.617 --> 00:00:39.033
Some

00:00:39.033 --> 00:00:43.367
look like orange zebras,

00:00:43.367 --> 00:00:47.617
others like flying snails.

00:00:47.617 --> 00:00:49.950
They can tease

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.700
or make you sneeze -

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.200
they can even make chocolates appear in empty pockets!

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.367
Puzzle the boo

00:00:59.367 --> 00:01:02.033
looked a bit like an elephant,

00:01:02.033 --> 00:01:05.533
only he was purple

00:01:05.533 --> 00:01:10.117
most of the time and the size of a mouse.

00:01:10.117 --> 00:01:11.950
Meera stumbled upon him

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.200
one morning by accident.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.533
There he was, sniffing and moaning,

00:01:18.533 --> 00:01:22.450
his backside firmly wedged

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.950
inside her shoe.

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.033
“I must be dreaming,”

00:01:29.033 --> 00:01:30.950
she thought.

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.617
She poked him to see

00:01:33.617 --> 00:01:36.367
what would happen.

00:01:36.367 --> 00:01:38.867
“Ouch!” howled Puzzle.

00:01:38.867 --> 00:01:40.867
“Oh! I’m very sorry,”

00:01:40.867 --> 00:01:46.700
she apologised.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.700
“I’m stuck!” he bawled.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:51.533
In fact,

00:01:51.533 --> 00:01:55.617
he had been stuck there all night

00:01:55.617 --> 00:02:03.617
and had given up hope of ever getting free.

00:02:03.617 --> 00:02:10.033
Meera examined him closely.

00:02:10.033 --> 00:02:14.533
“Let me see if I can help,” she said,

00:02:14.533 --> 00:02:20.783
pulling him by the legs.

00:02:20.783 --> 00:02:24.867
She pushed him from behind.

00:02:24.867 --> 00:02:33.617
She even banged the shoe on the floor.

00:02:33.617 --> 00:02:37.783
“I could put you in soapy water,”

00:02:37.783 --> 00:02:40.783
she suggested.

00:02:40.783 --> 00:02:42.533
No,

00:02:42.533 --> 00:02:48.033
Puzzle was scared of bubbles.

00:02:48.033 --> 00:02:50.867
“What if I poured oil on you?”

00:02:50.867 --> 00:02:53.200
she asked.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.783
Puzzle began to squeak and sob.

00:02:56.783 --> 00:02:58.867
He certainly didn’t want

00:02:58.867 --> 00:03:05.783
oil poured on him!

00:03:05.783 --> 00:03:08.200
“I know how to stop

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.367
you from crying!”

00:03:10.367 --> 00:03:15.867
Meera shouted merrily.

00:03:15.867 --> 00:03:20.117
She started to tickle Puzzle.

00:03:20.117 --> 00:03:23.033
Boos are very ticklish

00:03:23.033 --> 00:03:26.783
and soon he was squirming and giggling.

00:03:26.783 --> 00:03:30.117
The more Meera tickled him,

00:03:30.117 --> 00:03:32.450
the more he squirmed

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.783
until suddenly...

00:03:36.783 --> 00:03:39.700
“Look! You’re unstuck!”

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.367
cried Meera excitedly, clapping her hands.

00:03:44.367 --> 00:03:47.617
Puzzle blinked.

00:03:47.617 --> 00:03:50.367
He wiggled his legs.

00:03:50.367 --> 00:03:52.867
He wiggled his tail.

00:03:52.867 --> 00:03:56.867
Then he wiggled his whole self,

00:03:56.867 --> 00:04:00.617
just to make sure.

00:04:00.617 --> 00:04:03.783
“Yay! I’m free!”

00:04:03.783 --> 00:04:09.950
he trumpeted as he bounced around the room.

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:15.783
He bounced onto her hand and smiled,

00:04:15.783 --> 00:04:19.533
“What would you like before I go?

00:04:19.533 --> 00:04:22.033
Chocolates?

00:04:22.033 --> 00:04:27.033
Shall I make your school disappear?”

00:04:27.033 --> 00:04:29.950
“Do you have to go?”

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:34.283
asked Meera sadly.

00:04:34.283 --> 00:04:37.700
“I wish you could stay.

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:42.617
We could be friends!”

00:04:42.617 --> 00:04:46.283
Boos don’t have human friends.

00:04:46.283 --> 00:04:50.533
“That’s a great idea!” he squeaked,

00:04:50.533 --> 00:04:53.117
“Just say

00:04:53.117 --> 00:04:54.617
‘Puzzle the boo I want to see you’

00:04:54.617 --> 00:04:57.783
and I’ll come!”

00:04:57.783 --> 00:05:00.700
“Promise?” she asked.

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:05.117
“I promise!” winked Puzzle.

00:05:05.117 --> 00:05:09.700
The school bus honked loudly.

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:13.450
“Okay, we’ll play after school.

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:18.283
See you later!” she said as she rushed outside.

00:05:18.283 --> 00:05:20.117
After school,

00:05:20.117 --> 00:05:25.367
Meera went to the garden;

00:05:25.367 --> 00:05:35.117
she shut her eyes and murmured the magic words.

00:05:35.117 --> 00:05:38.283
There was a humming sound

00:05:38.283 --> 00:05:44.783
and Puzzle appeared in a flash!

00:05:44.783 --> 00:05:47.033
They laughed

00:05:47.033 --> 00:05:50.867
and played until sunset.

00:05:50.867 --> 00:05:53.200
And from that day on,

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:57.783
Meera and Puzzle became best friends.
