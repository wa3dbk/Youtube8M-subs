theatrical<00:00:27.150> ones<00:00:27.660> released<00:00:28.019> and<00:00:28.230> then<00:00:28.320> we

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
theatrical ones released and then we

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.839 
theatrical ones released and then we

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
started thinking about what are we going

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.250 
started thinking about what are we going
to<00:00:29.910> do<00:00:29.970> next<00:00:30.119> well<00:00:30.390> we<00:00:30.420> also<00:00:30.630> needed<00:00:30.960> something

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
to do next well we also needed something

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.659 
to do next well we also needed something
to<00:00:31.380> get<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.679> taste<00:00:31.890> out<00:00:32.040> of<00:00:32.099> our<00:00:32.279> mouths<00:00:32.430> from

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
to get the taste out of our mouths from

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.150 
to get the taste out of our mouths from
Superman<00:00:33.149> 3<00:00:33.540> &amp;<00:00:33.840> 4<00:00:34.110> in<00:00:34.170> some<00:00:34.649> extensive

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
Superman 3 &amp; 4 in some extensive

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.799 
Superman 3 &amp; 4 in some extensive
remember<00:00:35.430> terms<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:36.210> funny<00:00:36.450> thing<00:00:36.660> is<00:00:36.780> about

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
remember terms the funny thing is about

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.619 
remember terms the funny thing is about
doomsday<00:00:37.500> is<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:38.640> cartoon<00:00:38.969> yeah<00:00:39.390> there<00:00:39.570> are

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
doomsday is the cartoon yeah there are

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.750 
doomsday is the cartoon yeah there are
tons<00:00:39.870> of<00:00:40.010> cartoons<00:00:41.010> so<00:00:41.100> I<00:00:41.129> think<00:00:41.250> that<00:00:41.640> are

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
tons of cartoons so I think that are

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.150 
tons of cartoons so I think that are
better<00:00:42.149> than<00:00:42.719> this<00:00:43.020> one<00:00:43.320> but<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.829> reason<00:00:44.129> that

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
better than this one but the reason that

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.799 
better than this one but the reason that
I<00:00:44.309> think<00:00:44.579> that<00:00:44.700> we're<00:00:44.789> doing<00:00:44.820> is<00:00:45.090> because<00:00:45.420> you

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
I think that we're doing is because you

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.240 
I think that we're doing is because you
it's<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.200> only<00:00:46.230> time<00:00:46.620> you<00:00:46.739> actually<00:00:47.160> really

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
it's the only time you actually really

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.150 
it's the only time you actually really
get<00:00:47.399> to<00:00:47.579> see<00:00:48.000> this<00:00:48.660> legendary<00:00:49.500> character<00:00:50.039> that

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:00.260 
very disappointed with this animated

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.350 
very disappointed with this animated
version<00:05:00.590> they<00:05:00.710> really<00:05:01.070> did<00:05:01.310> no<00:05:01.640> justice<00:05:02.210> to

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.360 
version they really did no justice to

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.120 
version they really did no justice to
the<00:05:02.450> comic<00:05:02.840> really<00:05:03.170> I<00:05:03.200> mean<00:05:03.590> it<00:05:03.800> doesn't

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:04.130 
the comic really I mean it doesn't

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:06.040 
the comic really I mean it doesn't
follow<00:05:04.280> the<00:05:04.520> storyline<00:05:04.850> even<00:05:05.330> remotely<00:05:05.720> I

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.050 
follow the storyline even remotely I

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:07.600 
follow the storyline even remotely I
mean<00:05:06.260> I<00:05:06.290> guess<00:05:06.530> the<00:05:06.680> closest<00:05:07.070> thing<00:05:07.250> is<00:05:07.400> that

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:07.610 
mean I guess the closest thing is that

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:10.240 
mean I guess the closest thing is that
Superman<00:05:08.060> and<00:05:08.480> doomsday<00:05:08.930> do<00:05:09.170> fight<00:05:09.530> that

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:10.250 
Superman and doomsday do fight that

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:12.820 
Superman and doomsday do fight that
Superman<00:05:10.850> does<00:05:11.180> fall<00:05:11.570> by<00:05:11.840> Doomsday's<00:05:12.410> hand

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:12.830 
Superman does fall by Doomsday's hand

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:14.620 
Superman does fall by Doomsday's hand
and<00:05:13.100> that<00:05:13.430> later<00:05:13.640> in<00:05:13.880> the<00:05:14.000> film<00:05:14.180> Superman

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:14.630

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:17.050 
and that later in the film Superman
comes<00:05:15.110> back<00:05:15.380> and<00:05:15.650> has<00:05:15.740> like<00:05:15.980> a<00:05:16.010> black<00:05:16.400> suit<00:05:16.820> on

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:26.860 
didn't really enjoy that much I thought
that<00:06:25.940> it<00:06:26.030> could<00:06:26.060> have<00:06:26.270> been<00:06:26.300> a<00:06:26.390> lot<00:06:26.630> better

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:26.870
