00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.499
 good morning friends from youtube 

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:06.080
 welcome to a new video video by 

00:00:03.499 --> 00:00:08.560
 Rachid ground 28 in this new video 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:12.010
 will teach you how 

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:14.950
 download and use pokemon red fire 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:17.220
 this game is very funny is very 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:20.680
 catching the truth that I'm playing 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.750
 although good is played most 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.320
 of time I'm on the pc because the 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.250
 truth attracts you a lot and is a vice 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.009
 Well, the first thing we are going to do is 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.090
 download in the red pokemon game alone 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:33.079
 leave the download link in the 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:35.940
 video description 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:41.180
 from this folder 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:43.850
 this was announced winrar once 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:49.760
 surely downloaded this folder 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:51.620
 extracted forgiveness and with these with these 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.640
 add-ons that are the files for 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:59.079
 that the game 'not about a folder for 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:02.289
 the games that flavors 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:03.190
 good once everything we found 

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:05.290
 Discharged 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:09.659
 what we are going to do is start the 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.659
 visual or emulator is 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.939
 here we give file open 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:18.939
 and we're going to have to open the pokemon 

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:19.570
 red fire point gba this file for 

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:21.510
 what game 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:25.500
 perfectly 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:26.820
 we enter does not matter if this changes 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:31.300
 the colors of the bar and so on 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:33.920
 it's normal 7 windows 7 good now 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:37.920
 we are going to give it 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:42.810
 press room and just to 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:45.390
 hit him with the zeta so we move on to 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.380
 that we go accepting with the X for 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.509
 back but as you see 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.110
 with space we accelerate the game so that 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:53.110
 walk faster 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.650
 okay 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:03.270
 good and good here we have to go 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:04.829
 putting our name and progressing 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.649
 I will also teach you how to do it 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:10.019
 so that we can load our own 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:13.950
 game if we play I'm going down a 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:16.620
 long time and we do not know how to save 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.170
 this is going to be a problem because all 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:22.170
 the progress we have made is not going to 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:25.500
 be more and we will not be able to load the 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.300
 since many have not shown how 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.630
 does what we have to do is say 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:34.920
 here we start squeezing in the game the 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:38.250
 window we give you file we give to safe and 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:41.730
 we keep on the tele barack to put one 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:44.569
 to prove to put a number 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:48.380
 any this the number would serve to 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:48.380
 to show why 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.250
 that we are going more advanced we are not going to 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.830
 save 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.180
 let's try now 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:03.900
 we open the emulator again 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:03.900
 we go to fire and now we open the box 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:12.519
 as i said this is normal 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.519
 perfect 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:19.680
 now we give a file and we just came out 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:21.629
 As you see here, it appears to me 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.980
 happened many times this that he could not 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:26.110
 find where 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:29.049
 I did not know directly how it was kept 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:32.410
 well the thing is this you have to do this 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:34.890
 and now they must show where I'm going 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:37.160
 file 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:39.290
 I do 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:43.010
 I would tell him to believe in a folder and 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:45.330
 like in 1 2 and 3 this to go well and 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:48.590
 well I was here 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.590
 I do not know why she read me 

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:53.430
 well now I will explain more or 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:57.130
 less what we have to do 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:59.710
 basically in the pokemon we have what 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:02.550
 to work because we do not have to go 

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:06.490
 releasing them and making them more and more 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:09.170
 strong to be winning medals and so 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:11.410
 no progresses 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:13.810
 we can change pokemon we can 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:17.970
 add more powers 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:17.970
 and so on until 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:27.110
 until we become a werder the puddle good 

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:28.470
 this is all is simple I hope that you 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:33.020
 like 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:33.020
 and good again in the next video chao
