00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:04.370 

from<00:00:01.589> the<00:00:01.680> very<00:00:01.770> beginning<00:00:02.449> the<00:00:03.449> iPad<00:00:04.200> was

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
from the very beginning the iPad was

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.559 
from the very beginning the iPad was
designed<00:00:04.830> to<00:00:05.069> be<00:00:05.279> very<00:00:05.359> powerful<00:00:06.359> very

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
designed to be very powerful very

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.790 
designed to be very powerful very
capable<00:00:07.460> but<00:00:08.460> also<00:00:09.170> remarkably<00:00:10.170> simple<00:00:10.500> to

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
capable but also remarkably simple to

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.589 
capable but also remarkably simple to
use<00:00:12.799> so<00:00:13.799> our<00:00:13.950> goal<00:00:14.280> was<00:00:14.880> to<00:00:15.089> take<00:00:15.240> all<00:00:15.420> the

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599

use so our goal was to take all the
amazing<00:00:15.990> things<00:00:16.289> that<00:00:17.070> you<00:00:17.250> can<00:00:17.430> do<00:00:17.580> the

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
amazing things that you can do the

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.090 
amazing things that you can do the
full-size<00:00:18.210> iPad<00:00:18.720> but<00:00:19.289> pack<00:00:19.590> them<00:00:19.800> into<00:00:19.920> a

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
full-size iPad but pack them into a

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.540 
full-size iPad but pack them into a
product<00:00:20.430> that<00:00:20.640> is<00:00:20.789> so<00:00:21.240> much<00:00:21.510> smaller<00:00:21.869> and

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:22.550 
product that is so much smaller and

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.460 
product that is so much smaller and
that's<00:00:23.550> what<00:00:23.789> we<00:00:23.910> did<00:00:23.939> with<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:24.840> new<00:00:25.080> iPad

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.830 
went back to the very beginning and we
took<00:02:06.620> the<00:02:06.830> time<00:02:07.160> to<00:02:07.790> design<00:02:08.119> a<00:02:08.179> product<00:02:08.600> that

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
took the time to design a product that

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.890 
took the time to design a product that
was<00:02:09.229> a<00:02:09.429> concentration<00:02:10.429> of<00:02:10.550> not<00:02:11.180> a<00:02:11.210> reduction

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
was a concentration of not a reduction

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.550 
was a concentration of not a reduction
of<00:02:11.990> the<00:02:12.050> original<00:02:13.360> we<00:02:14.360> felt<00:02:14.660> strongly<00:02:15.080> that

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
of the original we felt strongly that

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.640 
of the original we felt strongly that
seven<00:02:16.370> point<00:02:16.640> nine<00:02:16.700> inches<00:02:17.300> was<00:02:17.959> exactly<00:02:18.530> the

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
seven point nine inches was exactly the

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.640 
seven point nine inches was exactly the
right<00:02:18.830> display<00:02:19.310> size<00:02:19.720> but<00:02:20.720> it<00:02:20.840> became<00:02:21.140> clear

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
right display size but it became clear

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.190 
right display size but it became clear
that<00:02:22.010> we<00:02:22.520> had<00:02:22.700> to<00:02:22.820> reduce<00:02:22.940> the<00:02:23.360> width<00:02:23.660> of<00:02:23.959> the

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
that we had to reduce the width of the

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.770 
that we had to reduce the width of the
borders<00:02:24.620> so<00:02:25.160> you<00:02:25.489> can<00:02:25.730> still<00:02:26.060> pick<00:02:26.300> it<00:02:26.450> up<00:02:26.600> and

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
borders so you can still pick it up and

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.060 
borders so you can still pick it up and
easily<00:02:27.170> use<00:02:27.380> it<00:02:27.560> with<00:02:27.709> one<00:02:27.860> hand<00:02:30.040> we<00:02:31.040> have
