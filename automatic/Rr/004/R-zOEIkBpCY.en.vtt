00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:11.770
 four runners are lazy dogs 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.490
 always make the same weather 

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:14.710
 put 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:17.200
 There are experts who say you can 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:19.480
 on the way also very simple things 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.470
 make the cost nothing that are too 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.510
 not bad but they bring 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.640
 unbelievably much with dr matthias 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:26.050
 marquardt the run pope if I am now 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.789
 sometimes three such exercises show the 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:31.890
 You can at every park bench in the world 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:31.890
 make and marco if I can do it 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:35.730
 the first exercise I show you 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.010
 would like the park bench exercise with it 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.840
 trains the buttocks and become 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.670
 faster but im running and already 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.699
 all your knee joint was not sitting that way 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.829
 I'll give you that to achim 

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:50.640
 Deputy demonstrate his left foot 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.500
 on the park bench whole foot area is 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.970
 on the pad here but quiet 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.220
 with the edge to it he wanted 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:59.280
 if the left knee is up he is 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:01.320
 last poverty and the left gibbs back 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.909
 and if you go up now, you take 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.930
 but with and moves the poor or too 

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:07.710
 Big looks like this 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:10.140
 yes ten times up and down and 8 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.600
 ghz and 8 on the pointed elbows 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.490
 angle pointed elbows and 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.649
 enforce when you come up completely 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.720
 up he wants and call that 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:20.160
 right knee with the right knee with 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.000
 yes, yes 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:27.179
 and now the poor but top so again 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:32.420
 It's pretty good, I'm satisfied 

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:32.420
 So he can carry on next exercise 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.130
 The second exercise is for the imprint 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.290
 gates for abducting the hip joint 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.090
 The areas are extremely important because you 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.590
 thus a basin within the 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.600
 stabilized running and if that 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.370
 Bag is not stable lurking injury 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.330
 in the area of ​​the knee joint and the 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:51.310
 lumbar spine 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.310
 I'll show you that anarchy again 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.220
 Alright, I'll make you short on Achim 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.450
 form a long line you stand up 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.790
 the foot is on and can hold outside edge 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.670
 Here with a poor elbow 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:11.360
 is minimally bent and now left 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:14.600
 leg left arm spread from it maximum 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.190
 ten pieces exactly is very important 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.380
 you stay stable here in the hip and 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.760
 does not move up but someone 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.150
 rest all wee bit again 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:25.880
 that's the only way you really have those 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:29.209
 This is the training for the agreement 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.890
 Oars for ours at more for the lower one 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:32.840
 as the upper one is sometimes already 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.340
 pretty good, which would be even better if 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:38.950
 you really a nice clean line 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.950
 I would not make out this way 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:45.190
 I like it very much you can do that 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.780
 we come to the third and last exercise 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.430
 of the three power exercises from the motto 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.410
 running program and that is the exercise 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.570
 on the curbside so you yours 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.010
 were to strengthen the achilles tendons 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.850
 and quickly from the ground again 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.460
 to be pressed 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:04.260
 I'll show you the anarchy we catch 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:06.960
 with the basic position at basic position 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:09.180
 is you standing with a half foot length 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:10.680
 in front of the curb or at the 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.780
 third stage you can take both 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.490
 take the arms up so that the 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.570
 forearms ground parallel are approximately 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:17.130
 move in belly 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:19.170
 There's a little bit on the spot 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:26.460
 build up tension and then you jump 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:29.610
 up there and back down exactly short 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:32.400
 contact and got up again 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:33.930
 parallel and that is not the 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.490
 curb that is moving 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.220
 you try close to the edge 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:39.750
 stay and really direct 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:44.280
 to land in front of the edge and back on it 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:45.200
 to jump and see that again 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.000
 pretty good 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:50.340
 so four times everyday you want a 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.870
 natural eccentric training for 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.400
 the car gets faster off the ground 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.350
 back away and stabilize the 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.360
 Achilles tendon and when that's a hundred years 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:01.340
 long does because here as quickly as we 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.340
 sometimes can happen
