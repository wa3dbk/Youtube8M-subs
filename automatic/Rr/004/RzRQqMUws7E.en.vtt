about either 200 or 300 k XP an hour
which<00:01:47.189> it<00:01:47.310> sounds<00:01:47.460> very<00:01:47.700> necessarily<00:01:48.540> the

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
which it sounds very necessarily the

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.899 
which it sounds very necessarily the
best<00:01:48.780> one<00:01:49.170> it's<00:01:49.380> a<00:01:49.530> decent<00:01:50.130> on<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.460> number<00:01:50.880> of

best one it's a decent on the number of
XP<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:51.630> I<00:01:51.960> guess<00:01:52.140> it's<00:01:52.320> something<00:01:52.590> that<00:01:52.710> you

combat XP which in one way it's kind of

combat XP which in one way it's kind of
fortunate<00:03:13.830> seeing<00:03:14.220> that<00:03:14.610> it<00:03:14.940> kind<00:03:15.090> of<00:03:15.120> takes

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
it was supposed to be done but skill

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.750 
it was supposed to be done but skill
issues<00:03:19.680> over<00:03:19.860> able<00:03:20.190> to<00:03:20.280> get<00:03:20.489> the<00:03:20.580> resources

issues over able to get the resources

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.150 
issues over able to get the resources
and<00:03:21.300> run<00:03:21.390> around<00:03:21.510> and<00:03:21.840> do<00:03:21.959> whatever<00:03:22.170> so<00:03:22.890> that's

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
and run around and do whatever so that's

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.100 
and run around and do whatever so that's
gonna<00:03:23.280> be<00:03:23.400> quite<00:03:23.580> exciting<00:03:24.060> to<00:03:24.209> see<00:03:24.660> how<00:03:24.930> it

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
gonna be quite exciting to see how it

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.010 
gonna be quite exciting to see how it
works<00:03:25.350> I<00:03:25.650> think<00:03:25.950> some<00:03:26.160> people<00:03:26.750> probably<00:03:27.750> will

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:28.020 
works I think some people probably will

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:29.360 
works I think some people probably will
accidentally<00:03:28.560> hit<00:03:28.709> each<00:03:28.830> other<00:03:28.980> with<00:03:29.160> stuff

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
accidentally hit each other with stuff

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.640 
accidentally hit each other with stuff
like<00:03:29.520> that<00:03:29.730> which<00:03:29.940> is<00:03:29.970> kind<00:03:30.840> of<00:03:30.989> fortunate<00:03:31.440> I'm

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
like that which is kind of fortunate I'm

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:32.780 
like that which is kind of fortunate I'm
not<00:03:31.770> really<00:03:31.920> sure<00:03:32.190> if<00:03:32.340> you<00:03:32.430> get<00:03:32.550> experience

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
not really sure if you get experience

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.190 
not really sure if you get experience
straight<00:03:33.150> away<00:03:33.360> like<00:03:33.570> you<00:03:33.750> used<00:03:33.930> to<00:03:34.020> do<00:03:34.170> before

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
straight away like you used to do before

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.890 
straight away like you used to do before
the<00:03:34.650> EUC<00:03:34.890> or<00:03:35.310> if<00:03:35.700> you<00:03:35.820> actually<00:03:35.970> have<00:03:36.510> to<00:03:36.660> kill

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
the EUC or if you actually have to kill

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.750 
the EUC or if you actually have to kill
them<00:03:37.080> like<00:03:37.860> photo<00:03:38.070> killed<00:03:38.340> them<00:03:38.459> in<00:03:38.520> order<00:03:38.640> to

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
them like photo killed them in order to

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.699 
them like photo killed them in order to
get<00:03:38.880> the<00:03:38.970> XP<00:03:39.270> but<00:03:39.840> I<00:03:39.900> guess<00:03:40.170> that's<00:03:40.410> something

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
get the XP but I guess that's something

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:43.040 
get the XP but I guess that's something
we'll<00:03:40.950> figure<00:03:41.130> out<00:03:41.310> eventually<00:03:42.090> as<00:03:42.510> well<00:03:42.810> and

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 
we'll figure out eventually as well and

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:44.570 
we'll figure out eventually as well and
also<00:03:43.170> how<00:03:43.500> much<00:03:43.680> explain<00:03:44.040> you<00:03:44.130> will<00:03:44.220> get<00:03:44.370> as<00:03:44.550> I

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.580 
also how much explain you will get as I

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.400 
also how much explain you will get as I
said<00:03:44.820> in<00:03:44.940> the<00:03:45.000> beginning<00:03:45.060> only<00:03:45.540> the<00:03:45.780> sixteen

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
said in the beginning only the sixteen

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.670 
said in the beginning only the sixteen
people<00:03:46.739> who<00:03:47.459> get<00:03:47.640> the<00:03:47.820> well<00:03:48.690> who<00:03:48.900> pick<00:03:49.470> you

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
people who get the well who pick you

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.800 
people who get the well who pick you
pretty<00:03:49.920> much<00:03:50.040> you<00:03:50.190> get<00:03:50.310> the<00:03:50.459> XP<00:03:50.760> so<00:03:51.269> how<00:03:51.480> that

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
pretty much you get the XP so how that

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.660 
pretty much you get the XP so how that
experien<00:03:52.800> it<00:03:52.920> out<00:03:53.070> there<00:03:53.190> is<00:03:53.280> something<00:03:53.580> I

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
experien it out there is something I

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.009 
experien it out there is something I
don't<00:03:53.880> really<00:03:54.000> know<00:03:54.209> but<00:03:54.630> that<00:03:54.810> could<00:03:54.959> be

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
don't really know but that could be

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:56.449 
don't really know but that could be
quite<00:03:55.170> exciting<00:03:55.650> to<00:03:55.739> figure<00:03:56.040> out<00:03:56.130> as<00:03:56.280> well<00:03:56.430> I

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
quite exciting to figure out as well I

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:58.430 
quite exciting to figure out as well I
didn't<00:03:56.760> really<00:03:56.940> look<00:03:57.480> it<00:03:57.630> up<00:03:57.720> too<00:03:57.900> much<00:03:57.930> before

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
didn't really look it up too much before

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.470 
didn't really look it up too much before
recording<00:03:58.860> this<00:03:58.950> video<00:03:59.130> as<00:03:59.400> I<00:03:59.790> said<00:04:00.000> I'm<00:04:00.180> well

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820 
I am a scaler I can't do any PvP so it's

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.060 
I am a scaler I can't do any PvP so it's

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.070 
not real very much of that I can do to

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:06.979 
not real very much of that I can do to

hopefully some of you will still find
this<00:04:10.170> quite<00:04:10.470> entertaining<00:04:10.920> as<00:04:11.220> I<00:04:11.250> said<00:04:11.519> I

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:11.550 
this quite entertaining as I said I

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:13.370 
this quite entertaining as I said I
really<00:04:11.820> hope<00:04:11.970> minigames<00:04:12.480> to<00:04:12.570> be<00:04:12.750> revived

but at the moment I can't really do that

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:36.110
