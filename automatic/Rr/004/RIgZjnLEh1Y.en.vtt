00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
going to win who's going to tough it out

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.699 
going to win who's going to tough it out
now<00:03:12.940> you're<00:03:13.060> going<00:03:13.180> to<00:03:13.239> get<00:03:13.300> power<00:03:13.540> from<00:03:14.350> Venus

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
now you're going to get power from Venus

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:16.170 
now you're going to get power from Venus
and<00:03:14.980> you<00:03:15.100> know<00:03:15.220> from<00:03:15.400> ankov<00:03:15.760> it<00:03:15.880> she's<00:03:16.060> going

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
and you know from ankov it she's going

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:17.460 
and you know from ankov it she's going
to<00:03:16.239> get<00:03:16.360> so<00:03:16.569> many<00:03:16.660> balls<00:03:16.930> back

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
to get so many balls back

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.260 
to get so many balls back
I<00:03:17.500> actually<00:03:17.860> think<00:03:18.160> Venus<00:03:18.489> is<00:03:18.610> going<00:03:18.760> to<00:03:18.819> win<00:03:19.000> I

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:19.270 
I actually think Venus is going to win I

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:21.690 
I actually think Venus is going to win I
might<00:03:19.840> be<00:03:19.989> wrong<00:03:20.170> but<00:03:20.500> I<00:03:20.860> just<00:03:20.920> think<00:03:21.280> Venus<00:03:21.580> is

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
might be wrong but I just think Venus is

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.790 
might be wrong but I just think Venus is
playing<00:03:21.970> so<00:03:22.269> well<00:03:22.510> and<00:03:22.780> to<00:03:23.080> me<00:03:23.230> she<00:03:23.410> seems<00:03:23.650> so

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:23.800 
playing so well and to me she seems so

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.860 
playing so well and to me she seems so
hungry

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.740 

three<00:03:29.470> sets<00:03:29.769> later<00:03:29.980> Venus<00:03:30.970> powers<00:03:31.360> onto<00:03:31.599> her

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
three sets later Venus powers onto her

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:38.729 
three sets later Venus powers onto her

mental best I think she's as wise as
she's<00:06:10.189> ever<00:06:10.399> been<00:06:10.490> I<00:06:10.990> think<00:06:11.990> that<00:06:12.289> wisdom

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:12.830 
she's ever been I think that wisdom

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:14.649 
she's ever been I think that wisdom
allows<00:06:13.369> her<00:06:13.610> to<00:06:13.759> really<00:06:13.939> maximize<00:06:14.209> the

performance<00:06:14.809> on<00:06:15.289> the<00:06:15.439> court<00:06:15.619> so<00:06:15.919> I<00:06:16.159> think

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:16.669 
performance on the court so I think

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:18.040 
performance on the court so I think
we're<00:06:16.759> going<00:06:16.849> to<00:06:16.939> have<00:06:17.089> several<00:06:17.419> more<00:06:17.689> years

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:18.050
