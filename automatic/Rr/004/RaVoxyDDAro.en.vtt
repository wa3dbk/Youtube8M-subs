00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 also youtube the good here we have the 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:06.720
 samsung galaxy young the reference s 63 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.570
 10 in this violence how to eliminate 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.309
 applications today with the new 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.860
 application the updates of the 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.199
 applications a majority of those footprints 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.150
 that have store that is the micro sd 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.460
 soul on the phone 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.770
 we can see that when we have 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.289
 uninstall the applications we will see that 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:27.060
 are stored in the church of 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.110
 manuel the phone so there are already many 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.380
 applications that do not need to be 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:33.720
 removed to look for more space 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.860
 internal storage then there are three 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.620
 options to uninstall applications 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.030
 The first is to enter the screen of 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.100
 applications and is the screen 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.320
 beginning to animate completely is to the 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.110
 home screen is to love the screen of 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.269
 applications here are on the screen 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.159
 application in what we do is click 

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:52.440
 here in configuration and then 

00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:54.360
 uninstall when you give the option to 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.940
 uninstall will not show us all the 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.519
 icons and only those that have a 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.199
 minus sign are the ones we can say 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:04.799
 install as they are what we have 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.240
 previously installed all this is all 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.000
 this for example and whatsapp instagram 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.729
 facebook twitter all these applications 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.049
 we see ourselves from installed like this 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.729
 that we can uninstall it 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.189
 we simply click on the minus 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.650
 the more accepts to accept where we 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.110
 question I have headquarters and installed we are going to 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.150
 to accept 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.510
 let's say we just installed also in 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:28.790
 In this messenger we click on the 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:30.350
 less and accept this the first method 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.240
 to do is install or remove 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.800
 applications the second method is to 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.080
 through the configuration option of 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.030
 phone we retired completely 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.710
 here we are the home screen what 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.630
 we do either by the option of 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.060
 notifications here is the little symbol of 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.760
 configuration and we look for the 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.990
 application manager here is 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.270
 the application manager 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.670
 we enter him and in that first option 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.440
 we can see everything we have 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.630
 downloaded very important was not 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.490
 uninstall google play or your 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.530
 updates and very important a lot 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.869
 less than installing the google place to 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.090
 cuplÃ© vote but the play was not us 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:07.160
 conditioning correctly then we go 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.170
 to find what application we are going to install 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.700
 let's say we're going to uninstall bieber 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.030
 because we want more space for the 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.610
 phone 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.800
 here is the option to install 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:21.160
 and simply what we do is give it 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:25.150
 click on it and uninstall accept 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:28.560
 immediately they have uninstalled 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:31.000
 let's install let's say the sky ping 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:34.880
 we click on 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:38.239
 uninstall accept and automatically 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:41.300
 that bar is installing alone and accept or 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:43.250
 removed two apps and we're going to 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.500
 move on to the third method to align 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.209
 applications we got out of here and the 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.940
 third method is 0 through 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:52.819
 place thor we enter the play store 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:55.280
 bamac and applications configuration play 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:58.100
 store and being here in the play store 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.290
 we go to configuration and we give you my 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.989
 applications will show all the 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.160
 applications that I have installed 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:06.080
 first show me the ones that require 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.000
 update is one that requires the 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.920
 update and those that were already 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.180
 updated 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.549
 then we look for the one we want soon 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:16.970
 uninstall let's uninstall 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:19.489
 twitter click on it and here we have 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.750
 two options open you can install something 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:23.790
 which is installed 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.070
 that is, in the same way as 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.100
 we install by the play store we can 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:31.750
 install let's find another out there 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:34.130
 how to install online 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.590
 click on uninstall 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:38.630
 in this way I have shown you three 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:41.030
 ways to eliminate applications that 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.470
 suddenly they are already using or in case 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.420
 they require more space 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:46.250
 internal storage of the phone and 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:47.750
