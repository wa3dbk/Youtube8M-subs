00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 the half-year balance sheet for many 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.960
 elements field downright devastating 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.620
 since the beginning of the year platinum has a good 15 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.219
 lost value 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:14.759
 in gold, it is already 26 percent and 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.470
 silver has a whopping 37 percent 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.220
 in the past six months worth 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.900
 lost 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.340
 where it comes from and if we are here 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.449
 maybe even from a crash 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.500
 I would like to speak today 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.230
 know of thorsten proettel 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.849
 Raw material analyst at the Landesbank Baden 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.439
 seasoning 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:30.269
 Mr. Bradl I mean we will not come 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.309
 around here from a circle too 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.690
 speak or is in any case 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.270
 crash on the stock exchange, there are the 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.520
 usually if any worth its shares 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.840
 raw material fell more than 20 percent 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.030
 then we speak of one 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.370
 bear market with gold and silver is 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.450
 In any case, the case because this best 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.670
 he has not only since the other 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.930
 started already last year so 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.300
 strich in the months of december and 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.739
 november we had an award to 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.969
 so they saw their award before 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.989
 background can be quite one of 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.969
 speak crash 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.050
 these are actually the reasons for 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.239
 vote for this crash this year 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.039
 have seen it was particularly blatant 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.110
 Of course the speech of Ben Bernanke 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.299
 some time in which he has announced 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.220
 so that the us central bank is his home 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.570
 Not so much money in the future 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.710
 print will be like in the past 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.479
 the case has been 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.040
 when I get that much money printed 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.170
 may be the topic of inflation 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.030
 no longer cooked and eaten so hot 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.070
 as it is currently a stock exchange 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.270
 had done before the 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.070
 background maybe falls 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.259
 this motive protects this in these 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.970
 safe harbor gold needs away but me 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.950
 must clearly say the thing the 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.600
 US central bank just makes it a factor 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.400
 Much more important for me since 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.320
 some time the economies of the us 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.850
 very well run that is the 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.170
 Stock markets are rising 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.920
 do not necessarily need the 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.840
 safe harbor 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.189
 they separate themselves from gold and it comes 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.290
 Add a second important point 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.590
 in asia, things are not going so well in terms of the economy 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.390
 round 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.740
 China is currently experiencing a drought in growth 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.840
 in india it does not look good 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.479
 and these two countries are from the 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.369
 Gold market incredibly important considering 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.020
 the recent massive losses of the 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.189
 we are already with many elements 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.780
 many investors have been asking questions 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.820
 how far can they go after them too 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.500
 go down how much air we have 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.659
 still down with silver or gold 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.399
 So no preference which precious metal with us 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.740
 Of course everyone can still watch 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.869
 There are no price limits 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.789
 that are safe 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.989
 with all metals can practically on 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.909
 Zero, which of course does not happen 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:16.129
 will happen because there is a certain 

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:17.750
 Useful gold can be just like silver 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:19.700
 also used in electrical industry 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.349
 are called instead of copper that is 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.150
 lower than the copper price would be the 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:24.650
 not fall but otherwise 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.310
 Of course aim first down 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.220
 open 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:31.340
 the gold price comes from about 250 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:33.349
 US dollar dropped us there in the year 2001 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.269
 in front of me 19 80 was already considered 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:37.400
 and 50 us dollars in the high 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:39.769
 this price drop by 60 dollars 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.690
 within those 20 years yes shows that 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:43.700
 because a lot is possible that is 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.140
 we have no limits at the moment 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.260
 the gold price and 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.340
 silver price to support the other prices 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.230
 again and again you hear the most 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.849
 past or lately that 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.370
 the cost of a natural 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:56.720
 they would be self- limiting 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.430
 say that's just not like that anymore 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.440
 The tools that support him are the costs 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:03.440
 would be due for the precious metals 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:05.090
 why now promotional costs would like 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.099
 passed around as a kind of natural 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.450
 price cap that has a certain 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:10.400
 wise from an authority 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.470
 we imagine the price it falls 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.120
 falls below the cost of the metal 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.950
 then it would mean that 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.669
 Mining company he no longer profitable 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:18.349
 work 

00:03:16.669 --> 00:03:20.239
 so maybe sooner or later 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:22.130
 the offer will go broke 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:24.019
 then lower it would go down 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.730
 and if the offer sinks then the 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:27.470
 price someday also rise again 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.060
 insofar the little one is passed around 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.430
 as a natural border but there are 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.989
 I am a little careful because many mines 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.489
 Chefs are currently watching this 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:36.530
 price erosion does not believe so 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:38.030
 sustainable is that is they limit 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:40.250
 The promotion does not do that at first 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.569
 offer remains the same on the other 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.579
 It would also be quite possible that 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:46.310
 the demand falls faster 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:47.750
 gold demand as the offer if the 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.430
 mine shafter yet again we think 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:51.079
 now have to restrict the promotion 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.760
 and against the background it would be quite 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:54.620
 conceivable that the price longer time 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.349
 falls and also falls under the 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:59.269
 we are currently seeing this 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:01.010
 first half as before over the balance sheet 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:02.569
 the elemental is devastating 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.910
 What can investor for the second 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:06.859
 half-year so expect platinum 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:08.989
 I'm optimistic both of you 

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:10.910
 Precious metals benefit from that 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:13.099
 the automotive industry above all things the 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:14.709
 usa but also in asia around one runs 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:17.120
 must know that platinum palladium 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:18.190
 catalytic converters for vehicles 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.500
 be used 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.750
 and they can not be substituted 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.610
 therefore need platinum-palladium at 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:26.980
 Silver is there so demand 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:29.110
 fall from electrical industry also comes 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:30.370
 it does not look that bad 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.510
 equal to my must say that the 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.530
 boom maybe this year 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.580
 more so round is still on 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.730
 beginning of the year expected 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:38.470
 my expectation with 32 growth of 

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:40.360
 global trouble when product the 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:42.070
 does not mean quite quite fishish 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.720
 meat but at least a little more 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:45.640
 Demand should be there should be the price 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.020
 but where it is very bad 

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.480
 it looks like in my opinion 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:51.490
 gold we are looking forward to a sale 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:53.470
 especially investors in the usa in particular 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:55.300
 as already mentioned the separate from 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:57.310
 gold probably more than 60 this year 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.780
 tons of gold sold by investors 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:01.090
 worldwide, if this trend in 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.260
 second half should continue 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:04.420
 I will give you even lower prices here 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:06.970
 see thorsten proettel commodity analyst 

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:09.060
 Thanks a lot from lbbw for that 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:09.060
 conversation
