00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.879
 hello to all and who manufactures off for 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:03.300
 a new special triplet of world of 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:05.069
 tanks 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.290
 so we did this little video for 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:11.509
 thank you for being 2000 subscribers having 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:13.980
 joined the chain and so to celebrate 

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:15.929
 well we redid a reflection where we are 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.330
 who play there in this case so it's 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.430
 kieffer and I who play with a ring 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.490
 to our usual platoon colleagues 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.439
 trolls of the woods and so we took the 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.910
 kavé 220 is what you can do a 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.560
 small representation of this charming 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.670
 little brother mike had 220 all 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.750
 just to make it a premium 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.759
 two thirds 5 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.899
 it's basically a cellar and one with the 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.649
 body armor of a tea 150 and 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:39.300
 how would I say a turret less 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.950
 sick and that of kavé 1 when 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.420
 is fully assembled all modules 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.190
 and a cannon him as well less 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.050
 powerful than the barrel to which the kavé 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.489
 abnormally right so basically it 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.890
 gains armor that loses power 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.969
 fire at the canvas level because 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.649
 I think the turret is still 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.160
 slightly more fragile than that 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.210
 of a hack had a full up okay so 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.710
 on the other hand yes it is true that there is a 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.030
 very very good rate of fire he has a 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.800
 gift we see pralines very 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.090
 quickly the problem of the gun being 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.650
 also the penetration that is enough 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.880
 limited like billy game very often to 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.960
 use the gold 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.659
 in any case when the course fell against 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.150
 a coffee one or bigger is 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.920
 really galley yes knowing that the tank 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.540
 at a slightly improved matchmaking seen 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.600
 that they fall maximum one- third account 6 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.070
 but even good account of 5 shots can 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.210
 really hard to penetrate so worth 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.770
 better carried off a few passes all that 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.950
 it's a premium so it does not cost much 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.990
 expensive 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.630
 oh yes you destroy decors at the 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.799
 I 'm going to be at the gold 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.390
 Belgian shit had loaded the fingers 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.770
 in provisions and a half yes no this 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.180
 kind of two vans there she me 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.259
 drunk every time when i'm in 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.549
 more to thirds generally I am 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.619
 obliged to put a shot in this daube 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.240
 so here I do it we listen again that's 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.369
 not not seen the price that it costs a 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.490
 gaulle trick of spies cuvettes at jay 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.979
 brunet not clearly so there you 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.119
 start to attack but the enemies 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.590
 who are in the main street 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.729
 there is ideal in addition to the enemies on 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.229
 our left did not push at all 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.430
 so we can take half of 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.430
 their blank team kindly 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.340
 it goes of course the aria the inhabitants 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.759
 it's going to be hanged on the cock and not so much 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.149
 it up 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.500
 not like a goose all and shot touches 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.700
 what's the matter but it's last year and 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.689
 both sides and the corsican and the side of 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.550
 the turret that we touch necessarily 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.630
 it's easier we would have had the box 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.239
 it would have been a lot more tense when 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.970
 even just pretty gorgeous the number of 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:16.050
 shots that ricochet go yeah bah I 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.209
 stayed motionless for a moment 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.440
 but as I know no damage I 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.750
 was a diversion for others if this 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.830
 is not worse 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.690
 looking for it basically who takes dear in 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.800
 the Web 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.230
 yeah but so what do we do in 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.360
 the shoulder exchanges and we ourselves 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:34.080
 in sundries td in the street and me 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.280
 on the place and we reversed the 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.100
 fim had the best player on their team 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.030
 who is getting expensive and 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.130
 still three beds in the buttocks 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.430
 for a quarter of an hour that makes no 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.560
 damage 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:51.660
 luckily the troll behind everything 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:52.680
 short so we 're really going there the 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.660
 power of the tank in this 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.130
 configuration there the resilience of the 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.540
 beast besides what is good is that 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.970
 on a mild case usually people 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.590
 aims is hull because for example 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.660
 aside the hull is still pretty 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.570
 easy to penetrate as long as one has a 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.650
 canon no normal penetration and there in 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.640
 did they continue both aimed 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.870
 the cash while that is precisely 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.549
 the most armored place of the tank then 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.200
 that I think in my opinion the the sides 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:15.359
 turrets or even the turret sale in 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.400
 trying to avoid the canon mask his 

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:18.930
 meaning much easier to penetrate 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.190
 so it's nice of them that they 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.359
 just avoid and then who gets 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.310
 focuses on areas that are golden 

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:24.600
 more shielded than on a caviar with low 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:31.380
 makes it look a lot like a cellar 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:33.430
 is a not bad tea 34 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:35.860
 sir case nothing that is not happy 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.390
 he is right but the reason that 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:39.310
 will find with a low tank 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:43.810
 penetration against the cavs and 220 that me 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:45.070
 drunk but a little bit I read fire 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.630
 of the title in four years we depopulated 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:48.550
 the opposing team already 12 shots 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:50.620
 it's going quietly now 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:52.330
 is not to die I look at my 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.080
 tank with its 17 points of life it's going 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:57.400
 be tense yes at the same time 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.510
 luckily we did it 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.680
 that he passes that the rest of the team 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.300
 was still frankly tomatoes 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.560
 yeah he had a colorful bow team 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.240
 in the sky in phase so with good and 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.740
 the less good ours ours by cons 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.280
 time out of the platoon it was a small 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:10.980
 little deluge 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.980
 these tests and red red red yeah 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:18.100
 so to water and down to earth even though the 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.660
 shielding and not phenomenal the fact of the 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.880
 hardly weak cannon penetration anymore 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:24.900
 the shielding language of the target 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:27.370
 it was a little tense enough distance 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.540
 they were 49 in a position all to 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:31.540
 helpful to his team he still 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:33.040
 managed to do quiet but I know 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:34.570
 not if he has evolved a lot 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.680
 the party and if it stayed there it did not 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:37.210
 not been very useful 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.980
 normal that the test the month over 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.270
 in the village I think in default 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:41.290
 to bring the victory to his team there 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:42.390
 may even have a laptop and 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:46.720
 holidays 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:48.820
 and here's the ter a little shell 360 that to 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.169
 penetrate as in butter and tea 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:50.740
 49 it's not shielding its quality 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:52.180
 primary 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.919
 good then after we'll be honest the 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.570
 kavé 220 it was on sale during 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:57.790
 few days in the shop we do not 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:05:00.610
 did not buy it was a gift that has
