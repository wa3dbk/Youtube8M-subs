00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:17.810
 It is from the needs of yes . 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:24.590
 Ring max bus 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:28.400
 Well I think this will be understood if you look at it, but it is quite that 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:31.070
 It is a worm that can be used for one almighty , for example 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:36.410
 Dattari jig head 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:41.480
 I'd of course be able to respond to light specific killing Carolina rig so kind of I Dig 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:44.660
 I think I can use a ticket for this almighty, but I would like to use it by all means 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:50.019
 I want to use it in a heavy down shot 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:50.019
 So what big say if this is the root of the riff 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:01:01.940
 There is a lot of high specific gravity of worms but this does not contain white 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:02.390
 Day-to-day bullets a little by more that buoyancy is high buoyancy is increased by that does not contain 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.270
 Well 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.540
 In a 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:13.170
 Slowly to 1 after a new conversation 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:15.990
 This hot It is the same has become very easy to use by Tteyuu fall 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:22.380
 By the rib shape 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:27.930
 I'm putting out a very strong hard, even if it is a cloudy field of water 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:35.429
 If it has become a very usable worm that it be amazing appeal I water 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:35.980
 When stabbed action adopted a flat body to a more denominations of it only after Otsuki 

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:39.520
 According to 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:45.600
 It's like hitting water strongly 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:47.860
 This is the feature of the ring max bus After that day when I used visa for a while 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:52.780
 The sinker is co-be 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:58.479
 In order to put that sharp of strength from the roots from there 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:02:00.580
 This tail in the case of a freefall no sinker state after falling to 1's fall after evolution 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:02.310
 Does not move 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:06.930
 This is hey 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.890
 I think normally I think it seems to you that it is not possible to catch the tail movement 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:14.040
 Is it 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:19.170
 Moving the sparkling glitter and curly tail when the more it has been the fall in evolution Gane 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:23.189
 Firmly stopped by Wow of the de ring is when you got there 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:27.390
 It is a slide fall loss, but this movement is 

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:31.610
 Crustacean shrimp or ice 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:38.450
 Similar to movement and more fishing 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:44.819
 After this ring There are 4 types of sizes for max bus from 3 inches 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:49.889
 5.3 Come Come with you offers a wide sleep a wide range of sizes up to inch 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:54.989
 Of course according to the use purpose I would like you to use mainly Hebidan mainly 

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:58.829
 For example , if it is used in Lake Biwa, this 5.3-inch heavy down shot 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:03:01.710
 I am i is also how to use Tteyuu plus can be written 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:08.190
 Do the Dene Well really 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:12.210
 It's a seemingly orthodox type of ring-shaped worm but it's in detail 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:17.210
 It is a worm that I made so much 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:17.210
 This ring Max path thank you in Leeds
