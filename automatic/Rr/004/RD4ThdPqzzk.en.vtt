00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:10.640
 gear france how do we do this 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.530
 program 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.970
 well, we made top gear france with 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.009
 pretty ways as you can see 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.560
 we have a very nice plateau that has been 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:20.030
 actually installed in the shed which is 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.310
 right next to the track on which we 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.420
 built our circuit then on the 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.939
 plateau for the shot it's means 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.759
 techniques in classic quotation marks of 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:31.850
 tv sets we shoot in xdcam we have 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:33.890
 so a telescopic crane that makes 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.000
 here are some plans all the time to 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.830
 inside cars 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.030
 it's a camera that we developed 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:41.750
 same who works very very well 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:43.010
 super stability super image that catches up 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.840
 the ten children permanently end it's 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:45.860
 really good stuff obviously a little 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.060
 of light also inside for 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.680
 able to illuminate the phases because 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.420
 the inter of a car is that they 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.040
 complicating movie and we saw in this 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.799
 part a bit a version we already have 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.570
 already shot there is a car governed actually 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:57.170
 behind the one in which you few 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.130
 firm weather 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.470
 what is happening concretely 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.940
 because it fuse me I just could see 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.560
 some exchanges between fuse thou art 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.750
 team it goes very fast 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.369
 very well stalled we went on a 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.140
 little coach because we wanted 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:10.759
 really here is having this proximity 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.650
 between us to avoid that it fuse 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:14.090
 because we still have two broadcasts 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.680
 was waiting by day where the English 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.180
 only wants to turn one a day with 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.409
 this prod post just next 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.010
 actually still in the link of 

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:20.989
 proximity 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.840
 louis there for once there we have a tent 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:25.040
 next door in which there are indeed two 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.230
 mounting benches to be able to mount in 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.090
 parallel of the first trays the 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.500
 stars tours because the stars are 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.970
 on the track they go around the stars 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.310
 we get the rucks we get it 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.680

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.150

 interesting on our side we're going 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.080
 now join the track since 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.820
 there is actually a personality that 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.210
 approach a dacia sandero to try to 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:55.710
 beating a checkpoint chrono 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:57.270
 obligatory when invited 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:59.370

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.780
 track here a special guest a bit 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.830
 since it's about françois fillon who 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.090
 is trying to beat his 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.090
 record aboard a dacia sandero 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:38.830

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:39.970

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:44.560
 will see the times I do not know so often 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:45.760
 then to the snow that comes here it's all 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.050

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.300
 pleasure because I'm a fan of 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:51.280
