recipe we're going to be using three

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.500 
recipe we're going to be using three
eggs<00:02:49.620> and<00:02:49.950> we<00:02:50.040> do<00:02:50.220> need<00:02:50.370> to<00:02:50.430> separate<00:02:51.269> them

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
eggs and we do need to separate them

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.050 
eggs and we do need to separate them
we're<00:02:52.049> going<00:02:52.140> to<00:02:52.200> be<00:02:52.380> using<00:02:52.829> the<00:02:53.010> yolks<00:02:53.370> in<00:02:53.790> the

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
we're going to be using the yolks in the

we're going to be using the yolks in the
main<00:02:54.239> part<00:02:54.600> of<00:02:54.750> the<00:02:54.870> batter<00:02:55.079> and<00:02:55.500> then<00:02:55.650> we're

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
main part of the batter and then we're

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:57.650 
main part of the batter and then we're
going<00:02:55.920> to<00:02:56.010> be<00:02:56.190> beating<00:02:56.579> the<00:02:56.730> whites<00:02:57.030> to<00:02:57.390> help

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
going to be beating the whites to help

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.380 
going to be beating the whites to help
lighten<00:02:58.290> the<00:02:58.409> batter<00:02:58.620> so<00:02:59.370> to<00:02:59.459> start<00:02:59.909> I've<00:03:00.150> got

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.880 
lighten the batter so to start I've got
three<00:03:00.810> bowls<00:03:01.110> out<00:03:01.590> and<00:03:01.890> I'm<00:03:02.489> going

bowl for my yolks and then one bowl for
my<00:03:15.790> whites<00:03:16.120> now<00:03:17.110> we're<00:03:17.260> going<00:03:17.350> to<00:03:17.410> start<00:03:17.709> by

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
my whites now we're going to start by

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.300 
my whites now we're going to start by
beating<00:03:18.490> our<00:03:18.910> egg<00:03:19.270> white<00:03:19.690> so<00:03:20.170> in<00:03:20.440> a<00:03:20.560> mixer<00:03:21.070> with

a whisk attachment I'm going to put

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:25.710 
a whisk attachment I'm going to put
those<00:03:23.290> into<00:03:23.680> a<00:03:23.920> clean<00:03:24.340> bowl<00:03:24.640> and<00:03:24.970> I'm<00:03:25.510> going<00:03:25.540> to

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
mix these on high speed until I get soft

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:32.610 
mix these on high speed until I get soft
peaks<00:03:29.820> now<00:03:30.820> if<00:03:30.880> you<00:03:31.000> remember<00:03:31.150> a<00:03:31.480> soft<00:03:31.900> peak<00:03:32.350> is

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
peaks now if you remember a soft peak is

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.940 
peaks now if you remember a soft peak is
when<00:03:32.890> the<00:03:33.540> tip<00:03:34.540> of<00:03:34.810> the<00:03:35.110> egg<00:03:35.290> white<00:03:35.530> just<00:03:35.560> kind

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
when the tip of the egg white just kind

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:37.860 
when the tip of the egg white just kind
of<00:03:36.040> flops<00:03:36.310> over<00:03:36.640> like<00:03:37.000> that<00:03:37.180> that's<00:03:37.480> perfect

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
of flops over like that that's perfect

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.680 
of flops over like that that's perfect
now<00:03:38.830> I'm<00:03:39.070> going<00:03:39.310> to<00:03:39.370> remove<00:03:39.550> these<00:03:40.270> egg<00:03:40.630> whites
