dependent on time waste as any other
game<00:03:05.459> event<00:03:05.760> this<00:03:06.360> means<00:03:06.629> that<00:03:06.780> if<00:03:06.900> you<00:03:06.930> don't

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
game event this means that if you don't

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.229 
game event this means that if you don't
select<00:03:07.379> units<00:03:07.860> to<00:03:08.010> be<00:03:08.040> kron<00:03:08.280> aborted<00:03:08.670> you<00:03:09.090> will

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
select units to be kron aborted you will

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:10.940 
select units to be kron aborted you will
not<00:03:09.360> follow<00:03:09.569> them<00:03:09.840> through<00:03:09.989> time<00:03:10.170> and<00:03:10.470> so<00:03:10.829> the

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
not follow them through time and so the

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.470 
not follow them through time and so the
arrival<00:03:11.280> will<00:03:11.430> not<00:03:11.640> show<00:03:11.819> up<00:03:11.970> until<00:03:12.239> the<00:03:12.299> time

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
arrival will not show up until the time

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.690 
arrival will not show up until the time
wave<00:03:12.690> passes<00:03:13.140> the<00:03:13.260> arrival<00:03:13.590> time<00:03:13.739> similarly

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
wave passes the arrival time similarly

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.309 
wave passes the arrival time similarly
if<00:03:15.120> you<00:03:15.269> move<00:03:15.420> away<00:03:15.569> from<00:03:15.720> the<00:03:15.930> departure

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 
if you move away from the departure

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:18.259 
if you move away from the departure
after<00:03:16.650> ordering<00:03:17.040> it<00:03:17.190> the<00:03:17.579> departure<00:03:17.940> will<00:03:18.090> not

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
after ordering it the departure will not

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:19.940 
after ordering it the departure will not
show<00:03:18.450> up<00:03:18.630> until<00:03:18.750> the<00:03:19.019> time<00:03:19.170> wave<00:03:19.380> passes<00:03:19.829> its

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
show up until the time wave passes its

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.979 
show up until the time wave passes its
time<00:03:20.190> this<00:03:20.910> allows<00:03:21.180> for<00:03:21.239> Crona<00:03:21.569> boarding<00:03:21.900> to

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
time this allows for Crona boarding to

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:23.210 
time this allows for Crona boarding to
occur<00:03:22.230> without<00:03:22.590> tipping<00:03:22.799> off<00:03:22.950> an<00:03:23.130> opponent

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
occur without tipping off an opponent

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.069 
occur without tipping off an opponent
though<00:03:23.760> it<00:03:23.850> is<00:03:23.940> much<00:03:24.150> harder<00:03:24.180> to<00:03:24.480> pull<00:03:24.690> off<00:03:24.810> I

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
though it is much harder to pull off I

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:26.509 
though it is much harder to pull off I
hope<00:03:25.560> this<00:03:25.709> tutorial<00:03:25.829> helped<00:03:26.340> you<00:03:26.430> to

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
hope this tutorial helped you to

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:27.890 
hope this tutorial helped you to
understand<00:03:26.880> aprons<00:03:27.269> time<00:03:27.450> travel<00:03:27.690> again

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
understand aprons time travel again

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.569 
understand aprons time travel again
thanks<00:03:28.500> for<00:03:28.530> watching<00:03:28.620> and<00:03:29.010> have<00:03:29.280> fun<00:03:29.310> in<00:03:29.519> the
