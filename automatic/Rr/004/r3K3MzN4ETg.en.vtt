00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:13.150
 That's how she beamed at us five years ago 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:15.670
 the pc games hardware 11 2004 where 3d 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:18.700
 fx voodoo a hefty price in one 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:20.580
 currency called dm and a cd rom instead 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:24.670
 dvd that's the darkest middle ages 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.590
 and certainly not the year 2004 altogether 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.410
 quite the pc games hardware celebrates 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:30.730
 this month your ninth birthday 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.260
 and therefore I do not allow myself like that 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.320
 usually five years to travel back 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:37.090
 but back to every issue he becomes 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:41.649
 Everything started then 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:44.370
 this is the pc games hardware 11 2001 

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:47.460
 document of historical significance the 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:50.260
 first edition of your favorite magazine 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.690
 one in advance the layout that I have him here 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:55.360
 show is not completely identical to the 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:57.489
 of the printed folder that has technical 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:00.010
 reasons for the files are from then 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:02.230
 not easily readable today 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.940
 I had to do everything with colored pencils roughly 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.009
 please trace this to me 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.810
 to apologize 

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:10.420
 But let's take a look 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.280
 on page 3 explains a teenager 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.170
 thilo bayer the idea behind the 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.690
 brand new folder namely the 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:19.209
 merging of the topics hardware and 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:22.270
 actually play obvious at that time 

00:01:19.209 --> 00:01:25.030
 but revolutionary is the theme of consoles 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.500
 By the way, not part of the booklet concept too 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.530
 if left below out of the way 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.220
 start from a device called xbox the 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.440
 speech is 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.330
 of course it should also be about software 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.580
 Subjects go from case to case 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.349
 player so we turned the reader on 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.090
 two pages in front of a new windows 

00:01:38.349 --> 00:01:42.009
 version called m 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.289
 This camouflaged itself with pretty colorful ones 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:46.450
 colors as especially multimedia and 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:49.569
 friendly games but based on how 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:52.330
 on the ancient 16 bit kernel of pc 

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:53.530
 chalk time in the reason so that with 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.840
 few colorful colors 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.819
 that's about like a cadaver with 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.470
 colorful sprinkles on it looks delicious 

00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:03.039
 but tastes like a used one 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:04.989
 Doormat whatsoever windows m was 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:07.390
 replaced by xp after a few months 

00:02:04.989 --> 00:02:09.149
 and disappeared deservedly fast 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.650
 from the picture surface 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.659
 But enough of the software which 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.360
 employed the hardware world in the year 

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:18.280
 2000, for example, this topic ten 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.319
 years after the end of the ddr she was 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.969
 suddenly again 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:22.590
 though not as fun 

00:02:20.969 --> 00:02:25.379
 socialist states experiment 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.939
 but as new memory standard the 

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:29.359
 first manufacturer announced then 

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:32.790
 mainboards with ddr ram benches 

00:02:29.359 --> 00:02:34.799
 including names like i want or abid of 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.530
 which one does not hear so much today 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:40.109
 and what do you throw except memory latch 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.090
 still on a mainboard processors 

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:43.109
 in the past, as today, a central topic is the 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.139
 pc games hardware 

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:48.060
 At that time ds athlon was just starting 

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:50.400
 the race against the pentium 3 around the 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.530
 won first gigahertz processor and 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.239
 Intel's hopes rested on the 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.090
 next generation the the 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:58.829
 fabled pentium 4 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.620
 As we know today, he became a 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:04.409
 He reached the pits instead of ten 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.870
 only 3.8 gigahertz and wore with his 

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:11.010
 Excessive waste heat powerful for climate change 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:12.689
 at least intel has survived and that can 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.120
 from another company 

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:19.680
 Unfortunately, at the time, they did not claim 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:21.870
 3d fx 3d graphic pioneer tried 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.650
 against nvidia's geforce lost ground 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.810
 atone 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.269
 and there with a graphics chip not 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.609
 you just grabbed four of the 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:33.180
 vs a100 on a board 

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:34.709
 out came the voodoo 5 6000 we 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.470
 were allowed to test exclusively 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:39.479
 a monstrous piece of engineering that be 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.979
 own power supply with brought for the 

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:43.590
 power requirement of the four chips was 

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:45.000
 colossal should be a nuclear power plant 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.470
 However, despite corresponding rumors 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.159
 not included 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:53.879
 I should say because the 6000 never came 

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:55.560
 on the market, who is surprised 3d synonymous 

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:57.959
 fx itself was obviously not very 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.729
 convinced of the new product in the interview 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:02.370
 the product manager admitted candidly 

00:03:59.729 --> 00:04:04.919
 that the vs 100 chip came too late and 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:07.019
 nvidia chips are much better 

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:09.180
 the next generation with code names 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:10.489
 However, rampage should be all over again 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.530
 to convince 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:15.769
 interesting marketing to the rampage 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:18.900
 Unfortunately it did not come anymore 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:22.109
 the future is not so good anyway 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:23.729
 for 3d fx the new andri engine 2 the 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:26.039
 devoted a separate article to the world 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:28.919
 should the 3d fx interface glide 

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:30.360
 no longer support but fully open 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:32.910
 put direct3d 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:35.280
 that definitely meant that for 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:38.790
 briatore interfaces and for one 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:41.820
 big advantage of the voodoo cards directx 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:44.430
 then current version 7 belonged to the 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:46.650
 future and the competition for 3d fx 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:49.350
 was getting stronger in the form of 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:50.730
 new geforce 2 ultra we in one 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:54.420
 vorschauten 

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:56.730
 The card should be fabulous 1200 mark 

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:59.340
 costs and new records of performance 

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:01.710
 set up with just a graphics chip 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:05.220
 without own interface and without 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:07.230
 own nuclear power plant yes nvidia was 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:09.750
 at that time leader and so landed the 

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:11.730
 geforce 2 g / t it too on the first one 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:14.550
 place in the first graphics card 

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:18.390
 Comparative test of pcgh history 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:20.070
 radeon 256 and voodoo 5 for this 

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:22.580
 by the way, thilo bayer has made an impact 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:25.620
 personally disguised as seven of nine 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:27.750
 and who can not do it for a geforce 2 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:29.760
 wanted to spend that we showed in 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:32.010
 our first overclocking article like 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:34.160
 one from deep within 1 per clock from a 

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:36.660
 increase a geforce 2 could do 

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:38.820
 that this is also much easier 

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:41.280
 Nvidia proved herself a few years ago 

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:43.700
 later than we deeply eight easy 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:46.050
 renamed to geforce 9 

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:47.730
 but there was time in the Stone Age 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:50.190
 not just processors and graphics cards 

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:53.520
 another focus of issue 11 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:55.380
 00 were input devices and thus were 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.790
 not as usual today mice and 

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:58.860
 keyboards meant no 

00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:02.640
 at that time there were still games 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:05.640
 which one steered with such a thing or also 

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:06.900
 with this strange device they ask 

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:08.630
 I do not want to work like that 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:10.890
 because that is not known 

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:12.360
 interpret cave paintings from this period 

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:14.220
 but point out that I am using these 

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:16.290
 look naughty the bludgeon 

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:18.630
 actually let games control 

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:21.390
 by picking up the stick and 

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:24.300
 slightly to the side so tended about how 

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:25.350
 a fixed melancholy more accurate 

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.610
 But I can not do that to him any more 

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:29.310
 they have to say theirs already 

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:31.650
 grandparents ask at the test of 

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:33.540
 current steering wheel generation we picked 

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:36.510
 us celebrity support 

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:38.460
 smudo from the fantastic four rapper 

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:40.860
 and a passionate race driver on the 

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:41.790
 race track and the pc helped us with the 

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:44.520
 rating 

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:49.080
 and what steering wheels did he and we find 

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:53.100
 it's best that they understand that there 

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:54.990
 that was a song from and what was left out 

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:58.140
 still played by nine 

00:06:54.990 --> 00:07:01.710
 years one of the few good star trek 

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:03.750
 games boccia elite force yes it likes 

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:06.510
 Today's view was ugly look 

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:09.090
 but then as technically timely and 

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:11.040
 honestly it does not look so scary 

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:13.050
 and eyes are as exciting as hemorrhoids 

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:15.720
 this program for us on two 

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:18.620
 Pages tuning tips gave a boy 

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:21.330
 half-life mod called counter strike 

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:22.740
 before I give them two particularly bad ones 

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:25.320
 Pictures from this article in the 

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:27.270
 show close up I say goodbye 

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:29.370
 Me rather than that I can say 

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:32.280
 poor eyes really do not do it 

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:35.870
 So see you next time 

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:35.870
 from the year 2004
