00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
than just like it's a really great

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:57.740 
than just like it's a really great
exchange<00:02:56.340> and<00:02:56.940> I<00:02:57.030> think<00:02:57.270> the<00:02:57.360> City<00:02:57.540> of<00:02:57.600> Toronto

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
exchange and I think the City of Toronto

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.000 
exchange and I think the City of Toronto
is<00:02:57.960> really<00:02:58.170> lucky<00:02:58.350> to<00:02:58.470> have<00:02:58.560> an<00:02:58.680> event<00:02:58.770> like

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
is really lucky to have an event like

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.370 
is really lucky to have an event like
this<00:02:59.160> because
