because<00:02:52.920> let's<00:02:53.130> say<00:02:53.250> he<00:02:53.520> opens<00:02:53.790> up<00:02:53.880> a<00:02:54.000> legend

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
because let's say he opens up a legend

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.900 
because let's say he opens up a legend
and<00:02:54.510> inform<00:02:54.960> or<00:02:55.290> Ronaldo<00:02:56.220> that<00:02:56.430> means<00:02:56.670> he

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
and inform or Ronaldo that means he

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.180 
and inform or Ronaldo that means he

and<00:06:03.720> we're<00:06:04.530> going<00:06:04.650> to<00:06:04.680> skip<00:06:04.950> this<00:06:05.040> one<00:06:05.250> I'm

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:05.580 
and we're going to skip this one I'm

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:06.920 
and we're going to skip this one I'm
gonna<00:06:05.790> do<00:06:06.030> it<00:06:06.120> for<00:06:06.300> good<00:06:06.540> luck<00:06:06.570> because

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:06.930 
gonna do it for good luck because

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:09.440 
gonna do it for good luck because
sometimes<00:06:07.440> you<00:06:07.620> get<00:06:07.740> good<00:06:07.920> players<00:06:08.040> but<00:06:08.450> that

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:09.450
