00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:17.970 

you

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.240 

I<00:02:19.140> was<00:02:20.140> gonna<00:02:20.230> do<00:02:20.409> we're<00:02:20.560> leaning<00:02:20.709> on<00:02:20.980> the<00:02:21.099> B

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
I was gonna do we're leaning on the B

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.050 
I was gonna do we're leaning on the B
but<00:02:21.730> i<00:02:22.090> don't<00:02:22.540> think<00:02:22.690> i'll<00:02:22.780> have<00:02:22.900> enough<00:02:23.200> room

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
but i don't think i'll have enough room

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:33.119 
but i don't think i'll have enough room
ok<00:02:25.319> so<00:02:26.319> that<00:02:26.500> is<00:02:26.530> my<00:02:27.129> Annie<00:02:31.319> so<00:02:32.319> that<00:02:32.650> was<00:02:32.830> fun

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:33.129 
ok so that is my Annie so that was fun

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:35.699 
ok so that is my Annie so that was fun
but<00:02:33.730> I<00:02:33.790> think<00:02:34.209> it<00:02:34.330> would<00:02:34.450> be<00:02:34.480> more<00:02:34.840> fun<00:02:34.870> if<00:02:35.500> I

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
but I think it would be more fun if I

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:38.369 
but I think it would be more fun if I
did<00:02:35.920> it<00:02:36.090> blindfolded<00:02:37.090> watch<00:02:37.720> the<00:02:37.959> show<00:02:38.230> i'm
