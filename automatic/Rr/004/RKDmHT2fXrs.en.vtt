the<00:00:18.270> spec<00:00:18.570> ops<00:00:18.779> and<00:00:18.990> I<00:00:19.650> really<00:00:19.859> enjoyed<00:00:20.130> this

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
the spec ops and I really enjoyed this

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.590 
the spec ops and I really enjoyed this
mission<00:00:20.609> when<00:00:20.730> I<00:00:20.760> did<00:00:21.000> it<00:00:21.029> I<00:00:21.180> just<00:00:21.420> thought<00:00:21.510> I'd

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
mission when I did it I just thought I'd

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.689 
mission when I did it I just thought I'd
play<00:00:21.810> it<00:00:21.840> again<00:00:22.140> so<00:00:22.619> I<00:00:22.650> whacked<00:00:22.949> it<00:00:23.100> on<00:00:23.220> veteran

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
play it again so I whacked it on veteran

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.000 
play it again so I whacked it on veteran
difficulty<00:00:24.090> and<00:00:24.600> it<00:00:25.109> reminded<00:00:25.380> me<00:00:25.439> of<00:00:25.500> ghosts

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
difficulty and it reminded me of ghosts

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.620 
difficulty and it reminded me of ghosts
a<00:00:26.070> bit<00:00:26.220> so<00:00:26.460> you<00:00:26.519> know<00:00:26.820> it's<00:00:27.000> a<00:00:27.029> really<00:00:27.240> stealthy

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
a bit so you know it's a really stealthy

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:28.910 
a bit so you know it's a really stealthy
mission<00:00:27.900> I<00:00:27.990> really<00:00:28.230> enjoyed<00:00:28.500> it<00:00:28.619> so<00:00:28.710> I<00:00:28.740> hope

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
mission I really enjoyed it so I hope

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.769

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
event has actually happened at the start

event has actually happened at the start
of<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.610> start<00:01:05.880> of<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.090> campaign<00:01:06.210> you

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
of the start of the campaign you

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.240 
of the start of the campaign you
actually<00:01:06.869> see<00:01:07.049> it<00:01:07.140> happening<00:01:07.500> and<00:01:07.830> what<00:01:08.010> it<00:01:08.130> is

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
actually see it happening and what it is

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.250 
actually see it happening and what it is
is<00:01:08.430> that<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.700> US<00:01:09.000> has<00:01:09.030> this<00:01:09.420> Odin<00:01:09.689> space

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
is that the US has this Odin space

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.170 
is that the US has this Odin space
station<00:01:10.770> open<00:01:11.310> space<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:11.880> I<00:01:11.939> can<00:01:12.119> only

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
station open space and I can only

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.090 
station open space and I can only
presume<00:01:12.540> that's<00:01:12.750> forum<00:01:13.290> normal<00:01:13.830> surveillance

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
presume that's forum normal surveillance

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.160 
presume that's forum normal surveillance
and<00:01:14.580> also<00:01:15.119> for<00:01:15.299> self<00:01:15.570> defense<00:01:15.600> as<00:01:16.020> well

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
and also for self defense as well

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.749 
and also for self defense as well
because<00:01:16.439> in<00:01:16.680> this<00:01:17.040> space<00:01:17.280> station<00:01:17.430> have

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
because in this space station have

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.399 
because in this space station have
actually<00:01:18.090> got<00:01:18.240> these<00:01:18.390> rods<00:01:18.720> this<00:01:18.990> kinetic

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
actually got these rods this kinetic

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.410 
actually got these rods this kinetic
rods<00:01:20.040> that<00:01:20.310> are<00:01:20.369> actually<00:01:20.549> highly<00:01:21.000> highly

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
rods that are actually highly highly

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.510 
rods that are actually highly highly

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
big skyscraper which is it seems to be

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.840 
big skyscraper which is it seems to be
the<00:02:50.290> target<00:02:50.530> the<00:02:50.800> central<00:02:51.280> point<00:02:51.430> of<00:02:51.640> this

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
the target the central point of this

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:53.310 
the target the central point of this
mission<00:02:52.300> anyway<00:02:52.720> the<00:02:52.870> point<00:02:53.020> that<00:02:53.200> I'm

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
mission anyway the point that I'm

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:54.870 
mission anyway the point that I'm
getting<00:02:53.470> to<00:02:53.710> is<00:02:53.860> the<00:02:54.070> location<00:02:54.400> of<00:02:54.730> the

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
getting to is the location of the

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.090 
getting to is the location of the
mission<00:02:55.240> and<00:02:55.390> it's<00:02:56.170> not<00:02:56.320> just<00:02:56.380> coincidence

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
mission and it's not just coincidence

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.010 
mission and it's not just coincidence
but<00:02:57.160> the<00:02:57.400> enemy<00:02:57.550> are<00:02:58.060> actually<00:02:58.480> some<00:02:58.690> South

00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.020 
but the enemy are actually some South

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.110
