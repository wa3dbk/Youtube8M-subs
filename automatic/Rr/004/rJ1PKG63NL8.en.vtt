00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
is something that just drove home to me

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.340 
is something that just drove home to me
because<00:01:56.450> everybody<00:01:57.450> can<00:01:57.540> relate<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:57.960> somebody

because everybody can relate to somebody

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.870 
because everybody can relate to somebody
in<00:01:58.590> their<00:01:58.710> life<00:01:58.890> telling<00:01:59.250> them<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.700> way<00:01:59.850> they

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880

should be living it and the dreams they
want<00:02:02.640> to<00:02:02.729> pursue<00:02:02.880> may<00:02:03.390> conflict<00:02:03.840> and<00:02:04.290> so<00:02:04.829> I

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
want to pursue may conflict and so I

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.469 
want to pursue may conflict and so I
love<00:02:05.399> that<00:02:05.549> we're<00:02:05.700> getting<00:02:05.880> a<00:02:05.939> sense<00:02:06.180> of<00:02:06.299> that

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
love that we're getting a sense of that

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.660 
love that we're getting a sense of that
and<00:02:06.810> more<00:02:06.840> so<00:02:07.710> toward<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.099> end<00:02:08.250> I<00:02:08.340> love<00:02:08.550> that

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670

we hear from the man himself a sort of

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.520 
we hear from the man himself a sort of
you<00:02:11.910> know<00:02:11.940> a<00:02:12.209> question<00:02:12.750> that<00:02:12.900> I<00:02:12.930> don't<00:02:13.140> think

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
you know a question that I don't think

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.140 
you know a question that I don't think
fits<00:02:13.770> within<00:02:13.950> the<00:02:14.069> confines<00:02:14.340> of<00:02:14.610> the<00:02:14.880> film

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
fits within the confines of the film

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.990 
fits within the confines of the film
itself<00:02:15.330> but<00:02:16.110> perhaps<00:02:16.319> the<00:02:17.220> fandom<00:02:17.640> at<00:02:17.760> large
