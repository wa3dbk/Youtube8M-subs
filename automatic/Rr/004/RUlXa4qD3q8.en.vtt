my<00:01:14.290> case<00:01:14.530> it's<00:01:14.740> for<00:01:15.009> psi<00:01:15.490> but<00:01:15.790> if<00:01:15.880> you<00:01:16.840> wanted

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.110 
my case it's for psi but if you wanted

to only function as this manometer for
most<00:01:19.840> part<00:01:19.990> you<00:01:20.350> could<00:01:20.500> set<00:01:20.710> that<00:01:20.740> value<00:01:21.190> much

most part you could set that value much

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:23.520 
most part you could set that value much
higher<00:01:21.640> so<00:01:21.970> that<00:01:22.000> it<00:01:22.210> only<00:01:22.330> happens<00:01:22.750> that<00:01:22.900> at

higher so that it only happens that at

higher so that it only happens that at

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 
high boost levels conversely you can set

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:27.810 
high boost levels conversely you can set
it<00:01:26.140> to<00:01:26.290> take<00:01:26.530> over<00:01:26.680> low<00:01:27.130> boost<00:01:27.400> levels<00:01:27.610> that

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:27.820 
it to take over low boost levels that

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.969 
it to take over low boost levels that
you<00:01:27.970> wanted<00:01:28.270> the<00:01:28.500> smelter<00:01:29.500> to<00:01:29.590> function<00:01:29.950> more
