that's going to create mass which is

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.200 
that's going to create mass which is
going<00:00:10.290> to<00:00:10.349> help<00:00:10.530> keep<00:00:10.980> the<00:00:11.250> temperature<00:00:11.969> and

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
going to help keep the temperature and

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.100 
guys is put your incubator in the closet
where<00:00:39.610> I<00:00:39.640> live<00:00:40.000> I<00:00:40.210> live<00:00:40.450> in<00:00:40.570> a<00:00:40.630> really<00:00:40.870> small

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:41.110 
where I live I live in a really small

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.700 
where I live I live in a really small
house<00:00:41.320> and<00:00:41.760> it's<00:00:42.760> very<00:00:42.940> difficult<00:00:43.690> for<00:00:44.470> me<00:00:44.680> to

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:44.710 
house and it's very difficult for me to

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.790 
house and it's very difficult for me to
maintain<00:00:45.400> a<00:00:45.610> stable<00:00:46.330> temperature<00:00:46.690> in<00:00:47.230> my

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:47.800 
maintain a stable temperature in my

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.010 
maintain a stable temperature in my
house<00:00:48.010> because<00:00:48.970> I<00:00:49.180> have<00:00:49.270> really<00:00:49.600> bad

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:50.020 
house because I have really bad

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.190 
house because I have really bad
insulation<00:00:51.210> so<00:00:52.210> I<00:00:52.270> found<00:00:52.630> that<00:00:52.780> keeping<00:00:53.170> your

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:53.200 
insulation so I found that keeping your

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.979 
insulation so I found that keeping your
incubator<00:00:53.980> in<00:00:54.070> the<00:00:54.160> closet<00:00:54.690> helps<00:00:55.690> to<00:00:55.840> keep

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:55.989 
incubator in the closet helps to keep

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:58.740 
incubator in the closet helps to keep
the<00:00:56.290> temperature<00:00:56.800> more<00:00:57.370> stable<00:00:57.940> which<00:00:58.150> is<00:00:58.330> key

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:58.750 
the temperature more stable which is key

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.390 
the temperature more stable which is key
in<00:00:59.280> getting<00:01:00.280> a<00:01:00.370> successful<00:01:00.670> hatch<00:01:01.660> rate<00:01:01.930> if

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:02.400 
in getting a successful hatch rate if

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.560 
in getting a successful hatch rate if
you<00:01:03.400> don't<00:01:03.820> want<00:01:03.970> to<00:01:04.030> do<00:01:04.150> this<00:01:04.270> you<00:01:04.449> can

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
you don't want to do this you can

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.650 
you don't want to do this you can
alternatively<00:01:05.259> put<00:01:06.040> your<00:01:06.160> incubator<00:01:06.660> inside

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:07.660 
alternatively put your incubator inside

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:11.430 
alternatively put your incubator inside
of<00:01:07.810> a<00:01:07.869> box<00:01:08.110> and<00:01:09.390> like<00:01:10.390> a<00:01:10.420> cardboard<00:01:10.780> box<00:01:11.080> and

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140 
close it up and that should provide the

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.109 
close it up and that should provide the
same<00:01:14.490> effect<00:01:15.490> as<00:01:15.729> putting<00:01:16.000> it<00:01:16.150> in<00:01:16.240> the<00:01:16.330> closet

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
same effect as putting it in the closet

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.160 
same effect as putting it in the closet
tip<00:01:19.119> number<00:01:19.330> three<00:01:19.720> is<00:01:21.360> cover<00:01:22.360> your<00:01:22.600> incubator

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.170 
tip number three is cover your incubator

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.499 
tip number three is cover your incubator
with<00:01:23.410> a<00:01:23.440> towel<00:01:23.800> I<00:01:24.160> know<00:01:24.640> it<00:01:25.000> might<00:01:25.180> not<00:01:25.360> seem

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:25.509 
with a towel I know it might not seem

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:27.690 
with a towel I know it might not seem
like<00:01:25.570> much<00:01:25.930> but<00:01:26.229> sometimes<00:01:27.190> when<00:01:27.369> I<00:01:27.430> wake<00:01:27.550> up

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 
like much but sometimes when I wake up

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.359 
like much but sometimes when I wake up
in<00:01:27.850> the<00:01:27.910> morning<00:01:28.210> it<00:01:28.720> would<00:01:28.960> be<00:01:29.140> the<00:01:29.920> temps<00:01:30.220> in

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:30.369 
in the morning it would be the temps in

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:31.770 
in the morning it would be the temps in
the<00:01:30.460> incubator<00:01:30.670> would<00:01:30.970> be<00:01:31.060> a<00:01:31.090> lot<00:01:31.330> cooler<00:01:31.630> than

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
the incubator would be a lot cooler than

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.410 
the incubator would be a lot cooler than
I<00:01:31.990> like<00:01:32.259> so<00:01:33.100> I<00:01:33.130> found<00:01:33.610> it<00:01:33.729> by<00:01:33.850> putting<00:01:34.060> a<00:01:34.210> towel

over the incubator at nights before I
went<00:01:36.700> to<00:01:36.790> bed<00:01:37.380> definitely<00:01:38.380> helps<00:01:38.920> keep<00:01:39.909> the

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
went to bed definitely helps keep the

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:46.020 
went to bed definitely helps keep the
incubator<00:01:40.900> warm<00:01:41.200> at<00:01:41.350> night<00:01:44.520> tip<00:01:45.520> number<00:01:45.729> four

so that I won't have to open it and
manually<00:02:11.390> turn<00:02:11.629> the<00:02:11.660> eggs<00:02:12.080> one<00:02:12.560> by<00:02:12.620> one<00:02:15.129> so<00:02:16.129> as

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
manually turn the eggs one by one so as

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.430 
manually turn the eggs one by one so as
you<00:02:16.489> can<00:02:16.610> see<00:02:16.670> here<00:02:17.000> I've<00:02:17.090> placed<00:02:17.390> the<00:02:18.200> two

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
you can see here I've placed the two

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.530 
you can see here I've placed the two
pieces<00:02:18.769> two<00:02:18.920> by<00:02:19.069> four<00:02:19.310> underneath<00:02:20.239> the<00:02:20.390> right

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
pieces two by four underneath the right

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.770 
pieces two by four underneath the right
side<00:02:20.810> and<00:02:21.430> what<00:02:22.430> I'm<00:02:22.549> going<00:02:22.730> to<00:02:22.819> do<00:02:23.000> is<00:02:23.239> switch

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
side and what I'm going to do is switch

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:30.490 
side and what I'm going to do is switch
that<00:02:24.019> over<00:02:24.200> to<00:02:24.650> the<00:02:24.769> other<00:02:24.830> side<00:02:25.160> just<00:02:29.470> like<00:02:30.470> a

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
that over to the other side just like a

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.880 
that over to the other side just like a
so

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.730 

and<00:02:36.810> that's<00:02:37.810> how<00:02:37.990> you<00:02:38.050> turn<00:02:38.350> your<00:02:38.560> eggs

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:38.740 
and that's how you turn your eggs

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.980 
and that's how you turn your eggs
without<00:02:39.040> having<00:02:39.640> to<00:02:39.820> open<00:02:40.120> the<00:02:40.390> incubator<00:02:40.870> if

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:40.990 
without having to open the incubator if

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:43.230 
without having to open the incubator if
you<00:02:41.080> don't<00:02:41.230> have<00:02:41.350> a<00:02:41.380> fancy-schmancy<00:02:41.860> our<00:02:42.430> egg

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:43.240 
you don't have a fancy-schmancy our egg

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.520 
you don't have a fancy-schmancy our egg
donor<00:02:45.300> so<00:02:46.300> before<00:02:46.750> I<00:02:46.780> get<00:02:46.930> into<00:02:46.990> tip<00:02:47.380> number

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
donor so before I get into tip number

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:48.750 
donor so before I get into tip number
five<00:02:47.830> I'm<00:02:48.070> going<00:02:48.190> to<00:02:48.280> show<00:02:48.370> you<00:02:48.460> guys<00:02:48.580> what

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
I've done here I've removed the eggs

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.070 
I've done here I've removed the eggs
from<00:02:51.460> the<00:02:51.490> egg<00:02:51.820> carton<00:02:52.120> and<00:02:52.540> I've<00:02:52.660> just<00:02:52.810> laid

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
from the egg carton and I've just laid

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.170 
from the egg carton and I've just laid
them<00:02:53.230> on<00:02:53.320> their<00:02:53.470> sides<00:02:53.710> and<00:02:54.580> make<00:02:54.850> sure<00:02:55.030> my

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
them on their sides and make sure my

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.730 
them on their sides and make sure my
incubator<00:02:55.600> is<00:02:55.750> laying<00:02:55.930> flat<00:02:56.200> on<00:02:56.260> the<00:02:56.500> ground

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:56.740

incubator is laying flat on the ground
I've<00:02:57.580> rearranged<00:02:58.390> all<00:02:58.570> of<00:02:58.960> my<00:02:59.140> water<00:02:59.350> bottle

00:02:59.730 --> 00:02:59.740 
I've rearranged all of my water bottle

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:05.040 
I've rearranged all of my water bottle
so<00:03:00.010> that<00:03:00.160> they're<00:03:00.340> all<00:03:00.550> on<00:03:00.580> one<00:03:00.880> side<00:03:01.120> and<00:03:04.050> okay

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
you increase the humidity in the

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.190 
you increase the humidity in the
incubator<00:03:14.820> because<00:03:15.820> that<00:03:16.150> is<00:03:16.330> really<00:03:17.020> really

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
incubator because that is really really

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.490 
incubator because that is really really
important<00:03:17.800> for<00:03:18.180> chickens<00:03:19.180> on<00:03:19.420> day<00:03:19.630> 18<00:03:19.870> is<00:03:20.320> when

way<00:04:10.030> way<00:04:10.299> up<00:04:10.480> as<00:04:10.720> you<00:04:11.470> can<00:04:11.620> see<00:04:11.860> I'm<00:04:12.069> trying<00:04:12.370> to

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:12.519 
way way up as you can see I'm trying to

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:14.940 
way way up as you can see I'm trying to
open<00:04:12.640> it<00:04:13.090> as<00:04:13.269> much<00:04:13.510> as<00:04:13.659> I<00:04:13.750> can<00:04:13.810> so<00:04:14.650> I'm<00:04:14.739> laying

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:14.950 
open it as much as I can so I'm laying

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:17.219 
open it as much as I can so I'm laying
most<00:04:15.760> of<00:04:15.940> the<00:04:16.090> wash<00:04:16.269> part<00:04:16.660> of<00:04:16.720> the<00:04:16.780> washcloth

00:04:17.219 --> 00:04:17.229 
most of the wash part of the washcloth

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:21.629 
most of the wash part of the washcloth
on<00:04:17.470> the<00:04:18.400> water<00:04:18.579> bottles<00:04:18.970> and<00:04:20.250> with<00:04:21.250> that<00:04:21.400> Stoke

00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:21.639 
on the water bottles and with that Stoke

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:23.700 
on the water bottles and with that Stoke
is<00:04:21.790> creating<00:04:22.120> a<00:04:22.180> bigger<00:04:22.419> surface<00:04:22.720> because<00:04:23.590> the

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:23.710 
is creating a bigger surface because the

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.830 
is creating a bigger surface because the
bigger<00:04:23.919> surface<00:04:24.370> you<00:04:24.520> have<00:04:24.570> the<00:04:25.570> more

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
bigger surface you have the more

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.060 
bigger surface you have the more
humidity<00:04:26.169> you're<00:04:26.530> going<00:04:26.650> to<00:04:26.740> have<00:04:26.860> in<00:04:27.040> your

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
humidity you're going to have in your

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.760 
humidity you're going to have in your
incubator<00:04:27.600> by<00:04:28.600> using<00:04:28.810> this<00:04:29.080> method<00:04:29.320> I've

managed<00:04:30.280> to<00:04:30.370> get<00:04:30.580> the<00:04:30.760> incubator<00:04:31.300> up<00:04:32.289> to<00:04:32.800> 84

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
managed to get the incubator up to 84

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:38.189 
managed to get the incubator up to 84
percent<00:04:33.400> humidity<00:04:34.500> during<00:04:35.500> lockdown<00:04:36.360> and<00:04:37.360> now

00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:38.199 
percent humidity during lockdown and now

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:40.500 
percent humidity during lockdown and now
what<00:04:38.350> I'm<00:04:38.440> doing<00:04:38.500> is<00:04:38.910> making<00:04:39.910> sure<00:04:40.120> that<00:04:40.240> I<00:04:40.419> can

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.090 
see my eggs and my thermometer

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:46.110 
see my eggs and my thermometer
hydrometer<00:04:43.930> which<00:04:44.110> is<00:04:44.430> right<00:04:45.430> above<00:04:45.729> the<00:04:45.970> eggs

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120 
hydrometer which is right above the eggs

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:50.010 
hydrometer which is right above the eggs
as<00:04:46.740> you<00:04:47.740> can<00:04:47.949> see<00:04:48.310> it's<00:04:49.210> a<00:04:49.270> little<00:04:49.539> dark<00:04:49.780> so

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
so that I can see the temp and humidity

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:06.230 
so that I can see the temp and humidity
easier<00:05:00.660> and<00:05:02.729> this<00:05:03.729> clip<00:05:04.270> here<00:05:04.510> that<00:05:04.539> I<00:05:04.720> have<00:05:04.990> is
