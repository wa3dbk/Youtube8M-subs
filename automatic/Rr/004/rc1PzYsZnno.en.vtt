going with it so much he's waiting to
see<00:01:09.659> if<00:01:09.899> other<00:01:10.049> ice<00:01:10.289> cubes<00:01:10.619> are<00:01:10.710> gonna<00:01:10.799> fall

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
see if other ice cubes are gonna fall

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:19.760

out<00:01:11.100> of<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.490> a<00:01:17.479> little<00:01:18.479> tiny<00:01:18.840> but<00:01:19.109> I<00:01:19.140> spit<00:01:19.740> out

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
out of the a little tiny but I spit out

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.830 
out of the a little tiny but I spit out
and<00:01:20.039> that's<00:01:20.159> why<00:01:20.280> I<00:01:20.310> got<00:01:20.579> down<00:01:23.539> anyway<00:01:24.539> he

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
makes so much noise with the bucket that

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.830 
makes so much noise with the bucket that
it<00:01:27.630> also<00:01:27.780> entertains<00:01:28.490> Charlamagne<00:01:29.630> like<00:01:30.630> he's

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840

do with the ice it's like well you're

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.349 
do with the ice it's like well you're
usually<00:02:00.929> not<00:02:01.109> in<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.560> room<00:02:01.740> anymore<00:02:02.359> you're

00:02:03.349 --> 00:02:03.359

usually not in the room anymore you're
gone<00:02:03.689> and<00:02:04.499> then<00:02:04.619> just<00:02:04.859> play<00:02:05.100> with<00:02:05.219> ice<00:02:05.459> cubes

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:15.019 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:19.339 

trig<00:02:16.019> plays<00:02:16.260> a<00:02:16.290> lot<00:02:16.620> better<00:02:17.360> unsupervised<00:02:18.360> he

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
trig plays a lot better unsupervised he

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:23.920 
trig plays a lot better unsupervised he
gets<00:02:19.590> like<00:02:19.769> way<00:02:21.170> way<00:02:22.170> into<00:02:22.530> it<00:02:22.650> unsupervised

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
gets like way way into it unsupervised

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.059 
gets like way way into it unsupervised
but<00:02:24.930> I<00:02:24.959> might<00:02:25.260> have<00:02:25.349> to<00:02:25.409> pull<00:02:25.590> you<00:02:25.739> away<00:02:25.890> so

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
but I might have to pull you away so

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:29.030 
but I might have to pull you away so
Chile<00:02:26.519> will<00:02:26.700> play<00:02:27.260> once<00:02:28.260> the<00:02:28.379> Ice<00:02:28.500> Cube's<00:02:28.829> melt

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
Chile will play once the Ice Cube's melt

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.399 
Chile will play once the Ice Cube's melt
enough<00:02:29.400> and<00:02:30.299> they<00:02:30.599> kind<00:02:30.780> of<00:02:30.840> stick<00:02:31.110> to<00:02:31.290> the

00:02:31.399 --> 00:02:31.409 
enough and they kind of stick to the

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:33.830 
enough and they kind of stick to the
bottom<00:02:31.709> of<00:02:31.860> the<00:02:31.980> bucket<00:02:32.190> then<00:02:33.150> trigger<00:02:33.569> stops

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
bottom of the bucket then trigger stops

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:49.970 
bottom of the bucket then trigger stops
playing<00:02:34.140> but<00:02:46.940> if<00:02:47.940> I<00:02:48.180> had<00:02:48.420> like<00:02:48.629> a<00:02:48.690> huge<00:02:49.260> tub<00:02:49.769> to

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
playing but if I had like a huge tub to

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.670 
playing but if I had like a huge tub to
put<00:02:50.160> these<00:02:50.340> in<00:02:50.720> which<00:02:51.720> I<00:02:51.930> guess<00:02:52.200> I<00:02:52.319> could<00:02:52.470> clean

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
put these in which I guess I could clean

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.289 
put these in which I guess I could clean
out<00:02:52.709> one<00:02:52.950> of<00:02:52.980> the<00:02:53.190> litter<00:02:53.430> boxes<00:02:53.849> and<00:02:54.030> do<00:02:54.150> that

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:54.299 
out one of the litter boxes and do that

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:58.099 
out one of the litter boxes and do that
they<00:02:55.290> would<00:02:55.590> like<00:02:56.430> it<00:02:56.640> I<00:02:56.879> actually<00:02:57.720> have<00:02:58.049> a

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:58.109

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:10.910 
I actually have a video of them playing
in<00:03:05.370> a<00:03:05.790> laundry<00:03:06.150> basket<00:03:06.180> with<00:03:06.840> a<00:03:09.349> cap<00:03:10.349> off<00:03:10.620> of<00:03:10.799> a

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
in a laundry basket with a cap off of a

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.300 
in a laundry basket with a cap off of a
water<00:03:11.159> bottle<00:03:11.359> when<00:03:12.359> there<00:03:12.510> are<00:03:12.569> kittens

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
water bottle when there are kittens

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.979 
water bottle when there are kittens
laundry<00:03:14.310> basket<00:03:14.669> wouldn't<00:03:14.910> work<00:03:15.060> with<00:03:15.389> ice

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
laundry basket wouldn't work with ice

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:21.559
