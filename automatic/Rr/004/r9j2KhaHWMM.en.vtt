00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:43.520 
change into another gear this time I'm

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.190 
change into another gear this time I'm
going<00:00:43.610> to<00:00:43.700> hook<00:00:43.820> it<00:00:44.000> into<00:00:44.180> second<00:00:44.840> gear<00:00:44.990> which

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:45.200 
going to hook it into second gear which

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.050 
going to hook it into second gear which
is<00:00:45.350> up<00:00:45.530> all<00:00:45.800> the<00:00:45.920> way<00:00:46.040> up<00:00:46.220> and<00:00:46.430> then<00:00:46.490> clicks

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:47.060 
is up all the way up and then clicks

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:49.120 
is up all the way up and then clicks
into<00:00:47.240> second<00:00:47.690> gear<00:00:47.840> no<00:00:48.350> need<00:00:48.560> to<00:00:48.590> use<00:00:48.829> a<00:00:48.860> clutch

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:49.130 
into second gear no need to use a clutch

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:50.800 
into second gear no need to use a clutch
on<00:00:49.280> this<00:00:49.400> point<00:00:49.640> because<00:00:49.850> it's<00:00:50.180> a<00:00:50.329> motocross

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:50.810 
on this point because it's a motocross

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:52.300 
on this point because it's a motocross
bike<00:00:51.079> you<00:00:51.320> don't<00:00:51.530> need<00:00:51.620> to<00:00:51.739> use<00:00:51.890> the<00:00:51.920> putts<00:00:52.190> for

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:52.310 
bike you don't need to use the putts for

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:54.790 
bike you don't need to use the putts for
changing<00:00:52.730> gear<00:00:52.970> and<00:00:53.630> off<00:00:53.750> you<00:00:53.930> go<00:00:53.989> accelerate

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 
changing gear and off you go accelerate

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.979 
changing gear and off you go accelerate
bit<00:00:55.430> more<00:00:55.640> speed<00:00:55.940> you<00:00:56.360> want<00:00:56.570> to<00:00:56.630> go<00:00:56.750> a<00:00:56.780> bit

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
bit more speed you want to go a bit

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:00.280 
bit more speed you want to go a bit
faster<00:00:57.560> change<00:00:58.340> gear<00:00:58.670> again<00:00:58.790> up<00:00:59.690> gear<00:01:00.110> again

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:00.290 
faster change gear again up gear again

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:02.740 
faster change gear again up gear again
now<00:01:00.890> we're<00:01:01.100> into<00:01:01.280> third<00:01:01.610> gear<00:01:01.640> and<00:01:02.210> this<00:01:02.510> time

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:02.750 
now we're into third gear and this time

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.859 
now we're into third gear and this time
we<00:01:02.899> should<00:01:02.960> be<00:01:03.170> moving<00:01:03.320> along<00:01:03.590> quite<00:01:03.950> nicely

00:01:04.859 --> 00:01:04.869 
we should be moving along quite nicely

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:07.600 
we should be moving along quite nicely
do<00:01:05.869> now<00:01:06.049> come<00:01:06.290> up<00:01:06.380> to<00:01:06.530> a<00:01:06.590> corner<00:01:07.040> you're<00:01:07.430> going

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
do now come up to a corner you're going

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.609 
do now come up to a corner you're going
to<00:01:07.670> need<00:01:07.820> to<00:01:07.909> change<00:01:08.210> back<00:01:08.450> down<00:01:08.810> the<00:01:09.079> gears<00:01:09.320> so

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:09.619 
to need to change back down the gears so

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:11.230 
to need to change back down the gears so
instead<00:01:09.890> of<00:01:09.950> going<00:01:10.100> up<00:01:10.340> this<00:01:10.490> time<00:01:10.790> we<00:01:10.969> need<00:01:11.119> to

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
instead of going up this time we need to

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.350 
instead of going up this time we need to
go<00:01:11.390> down<00:01:12.130> crap<00:01:13.130> down<00:01:13.399> again<00:01:13.820> if<00:01:13.969> you<00:01:14.090> need<00:01:14.119> to

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
go down crap down again if you need to

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.469 
go down crap down again if you need to
slow<00:01:14.540> down<00:01:14.570> a<00:01:14.810> little<00:01:15.110> bit<00:01:15.290> more<00:01:16.330> around<00:01:17.330> the

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 
slow down a little bit more around the

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:19.810 
slow down a little bit more around the
corner<00:01:17.990> and<00:01:18.979> then<00:01:19.100> start<00:01:19.400> to<00:01:19.549> accelerate

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
corner and then start to accelerate

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.480 
corner and then start to accelerate
again<00:01:20.270> start<00:01:21.020> to<00:01:21.110> accelerate<00:01:21.470> will<00:01:22.040> use<00:01:22.159> use

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
again start to accelerate will use use

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.280 
again start to accelerate will use use
of<00:01:22.700> the<00:01:22.820> throttle<00:01:23.240> twisting<00:01:23.659> the<00:01:23.780> throttle<00:01:23.810> as

of the throttle twisting the throttle as

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.000 
of the throttle twisting the throttle as
we<00:01:24.409> go<00:01:24.820> let<00:01:25.820> go<00:01:25.970> of<00:01:26.000> the<00:01:26.180> throttle<00:01:26.270> slightly

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.010 
we go let go of the throttle slightly

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:29.740 
we go let go of the throttle slightly
change<00:01:28.010> up<00:01:28.220> the<00:01:28.310> gear<00:01:28.549> back<00:01:29.119> on<00:01:29.150> the<00:01:29.540> throttle

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
change up the gear back on the throttle

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.660 
change up the gear back on the throttle
this<00:01:30.140> you've<00:01:30.440> made<00:01:30.590> a<00:01:30.619> beautiful<00:01:30.860> gear<00:01:31.340> change

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
this you've made a beautiful gear change

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:38.700 
this you've made a beautiful gear change
you're<00:01:32.180> going<00:01:32.450> faster<00:01:32.930> and<00:01:32.990> faster

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710
