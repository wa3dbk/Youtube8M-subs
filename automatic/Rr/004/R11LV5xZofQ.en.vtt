we were learning a lot teaching

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.620 
we were learning a lot teaching
ourselves<00:00:33.270> alive<00:00:34.790> and<00:00:35.790> a<00:00:35.820> lot<00:00:36.149> of<00:00:36.270> that<00:00:36.420> came

ourselves alive and a lot of that came

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.930 
ourselves alive and a lot of that came
from<00:00:36.870> just<00:00:37.110> having<00:00:37.170> you<00:00:37.829> know<00:00:38.700> pretty

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
from just having you know pretty

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.990 
from just having you know pretty
experimental<00:00:39.600> attitude<00:00:40.230> of<00:00:40.879> what<00:00:41.879> would

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
experimental attitude of what would

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.119 
experimental attitude of what would
happen<00:00:42.390> if<00:00:42.480> we<00:00:42.629> did<00:00:42.809> this<00:00:43.020> litter<00:00:43.620> than<00:00:43.829> what

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
happen if we did this litter than what

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.920 
happen if we did this litter than what
are<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.370> you<00:00:45.030> know<00:00:45.149> what<00:00:45.300> are<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.510> limits<00:00:45.840> of

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
are the you know what are the limits of

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.250 
are the you know what are the limits of
this<00:00:46.079> material<00:00:46.230> how<00:00:46.590> far<00:00:46.829> can<00:00:46.950> we<00:00:47.100> push<00:00:47.129> it<00:00:48.260> so

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
this material how far can we push it so

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.650 
this material how far can we push it so
this<00:00:49.440> shelf<00:00:49.739> up<00:00:50.010> here<00:00:50.309> is<00:00:50.610> built<00:00:50.940> using<00:00:51.239> a

this shelf up here is built using a

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.439 
this shelf up here is built using a
technique<00:00:52.050> called<00:00:52.110> corbel<00:00:52.890> in<00:00:53.120> it's<00:00:54.120> made

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
extra strong and that was a technique

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.950 
extra strong and that was a technique
that<00:01:01.920> we<00:01:02.219> came<00:01:02.460> up<00:01:02.520> with<00:01:02.820> while<00:01:03.270> working<00:01:03.809> on

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
that we came up with while working on

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.230 
that we came up with while working on
that<00:01:04.110> heart<00:01:04.409> house<00:01:04.619> when<00:01:05.189> it<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.820> a<00:01:05.850> second

that heart house when it to a second

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.130 
that heart house when it to a second
house<00:01:06.619> we<00:01:07.619> built<00:01:07.920> a<00:01:08.189> shelf<00:01:08.490> like<00:01:08.880> this<00:01:09.299> for<00:01:10.110> a

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
house we built a shelf like this for a

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.760 
house we built a shelf like this for a
bookshelf<00:01:11.360> never<00:01:12.360> having<00:01:12.659> done<00:01:12.780> it<00:01:12.960> before<00:01:13.470> or

seen it done or heard of it and I don't
I<00:01:16.380> know<00:01:16.979> I'm<00:01:17.189> not<00:01:17.220> clear<00:01:17.580> exactly<00:01:17.700> where<00:01:18.330> the

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
I know I'm not clear exactly where the

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.690 
I know I'm not clear exactly where the
where<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.049> idea<00:01:19.290> came<00:01:19.680> from<00:01:19.740> I<00:01:20.159> presume<00:01:20.580> it

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
where the idea came from I presume it

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.940 
where the idea came from I presume it
was<00:01:20.820> probably<00:01:21.180> yontiff<00:01:22.820> invention<00:01:24.590> but<00:01:25.590> as

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
was probably yontiff invention but as

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.850 
was probably yontiff invention but as
the<00:01:26.729> wall<00:01:27.000> continue<00:01:27.630> to<00:01:27.750> go<00:01:27.960> up<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.439> cob<00:01:28.619> wall

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
the wall continue to go up the cob wall

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.010 
the wall continue to go up the cob wall
continue<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.430> get<00:01:29.579> love<00:01:29.759> we<00:01:30.600> needed<00:01:30.930> a

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
continue to get love we needed a

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.830 
continue to get love we needed a
scaffolding<00:01:31.860> to<00:01:32.130> access<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.909> topic<00:01:33.270> wall<00:01:33.600> for

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
scaffolding to access the topic wall for

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.069 
scaffolding to access the topic wall for
building<00:01:34.290> and<00:01:34.500> I<00:01:35.250> remember<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:36.570> day<00:01:36.780> that<00:01:36.810> I

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
building and I remember the day that I

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.170 
building and I remember the day that I
found<00:01:37.350> myself<00:01:37.470> sort<00:01:38.100> of<00:01:38.159> hesitantly<00:01:38.759> putting

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
found myself sort of hesitantly putting

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.359 
found myself sort of hesitantly putting
my<00:01:39.360> foot<00:01:39.960> in<00:01:40.079> one<00:01:40.320> foot<00:01:40.350> and<00:01:40.950> then<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.250> other

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
my foot in one foot and then the other

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.819 
my foot in one foot and then the other
foot<00:01:41.880> onto<00:01:42.150> this<00:01:42.479> cog<00:01:42.750> shelf<00:01:43.170> to<00:01:43.380> see<00:01:43.560> whether

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
foot onto this cog shelf to see whether

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.340 
foot onto this cog shelf to see whether
it<00:01:44.040> would<00:01:44.159> support<00:01:44.610> me<00:01:44.820> and<00:01:45.149> kind<00:01:46.020> of<00:01:46.140> half

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
it would support me and kind of half

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.749 
it would support me and kind of half
thinking<00:01:46.829> that<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.100> whole<00:01:47.130> thing<00:01:47.250> was<00:01:47.549> going

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
thinking that the whole thing was going

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.100 
thinking that the whole thing was going
to<00:01:47.880> collapse<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.299> I<00:01:48.390> was<00:01:48.540> going<00:01:48.720> to<00:01:48.780> end<00:01:48.899> up<00:01:48.960> on

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
to collapse and I was going to end up on

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.490 
to collapse and I was going to end up on
the<00:01:49.259> ground<00:01:49.500> that<00:01:49.799> didn't<00:01:50.759> happen<00:01:51.180> and<00:01:51.500> pretty

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
the ground that didn't happen and pretty

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.190 
the ground that didn't happen and pretty
soon<00:01:52.710> we<00:01:52.920> had<00:01:53.070> four<00:01:53.399> or<00:01:53.520> five<00:01:53.729> people

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
soon we had four or five people

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.539 
soon we had four or five people
extending<00:01:55.200> on<00:01:55.320> a<00:01:55.350> shelf<00:01:55.649> about<00:01:56.009> like<00:01:56.280> this

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
extending on a shelf about like this

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.660 
extending on a shelf about like this
continuing<00:01:57.210> to<00:01:57.329> call<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:58.409> wall<00:01:58.619> up<00:01:58.829> over

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
continuing to call the wall up over

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.959 
continuing to call the wall up over
items<00:02:00.320> they<00:02:01.320> were<00:02:01.350> and<00:02:02.040> during<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.460> process

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
items they were and during the process

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.690 
items they were and during the process
there<00:02:03.600> was<00:02:03.689> a<00:02:03.780> very<00:02:04.020> magical<00:02:04.710> process<00:02:05.310> of

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
there was a very magical process of

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.669 
there was a very magical process of
building<00:02:05.939> that<00:02:06.299> structure<00:02:07.310> things<00:02:08.310> kept<00:02:08.759> like

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.160 
building that structure things kept like
materials<00:02:10.679> kept<00:02:10.979> showing<00:02:11.280> up<00:02:11.520> for<00:02:11.640> us<00:02:12.360> in

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
materials kept showing up for us in

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.390 
materials kept showing up for us in
very<00:02:13.349> kind<00:02:13.680> of<00:02:13.860> magical<00:02:14.400> way<00:02:15.170> that<00:02:16.170> we<00:02:16.920> were

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
very kind of magical way that we were

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.000 
very kind of magical way that we were
giving<00:02:17.760> some<00:02:18.120> thought<00:02:18.150> in<00:02:18.780> some<00:02:19.050> attention<00:02:19.709> to

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
giving some thought in some attention to

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.040 
giving some thought in some attention to
things<00:02:20.370> like<00:02:20.700> where's<00:02:21.030> the<00:02:21.150> light<00:02:21.480> in<00:02:21.720> the<00:02:21.840> Sun

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
things like where's the light in the Sun

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.660 
things like where's the light in the Sun
can<00:02:22.260> it<00:02:22.380> be<00:02:22.530> on<00:02:22.739> the<00:02:22.860> solstices<00:02:23.430> and<00:02:23.610> the

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
can it be on the solstices and the

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.780 
can it be on the solstices and the
equinoxes<00:02:24.420> and<00:02:24.480> that<00:02:24.750> sort<00:02:25.050> of<00:02:25.110> thing<00:02:25.580> but<00:02:26.580> the

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
equinoxes and that sort of thing but the

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.890 
equinoxes and that sort of thing but the
actual<00:02:27.440> manifestation<00:02:28.440> of<00:02:28.620> how<00:02:29.340> those<00:02:29.610> things

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
actual manifestation of how those things

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.800 
actual manifestation of how those things
interact<00:02:30.900> within<00:02:31.170> that<00:02:31.470> building<00:02:32.810> we're

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
interact within that building we're

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.040 
interact within that building we're
partially<00:02:34.319> serendipitous<00:02:35.100> also<00:02:35.810> so<00:02:36.810> there's

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
partially serendipitous also so there's

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.479 
partially serendipitous also so there's
a<00:02:37.110> circumstance<00:02:37.800> for<00:02:37.920> example<00:02:40.010> where<00:02:41.010> at

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
a circumstance for example where at

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:45.770 
a circumstance for example where at
sunrise<00:02:42.209> on<00:02:42.900> the<00:02:42.959> summer<00:02:43.709> solstice<00:02:43.830> the<00:02:44.780> sun

like 30,000 books so I'm fairly sure
there's<00:07:05.030> hundreds<00:07:05.510> of<00:07:05.630> thousands<00:07:06.170> of<00:07:06.230> people

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:06.410 
there's hundreds of thousands of people

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:09.640 
there's hundreds of thousands of people
at<00:07:06.680> least<00:07:07.180> possibly<00:07:08.180> more<00:07:08.480> possibly<00:07:09.440> millions

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:09.650 
at least possibly more possibly millions

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:12.550 
at least possibly more possibly millions

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:12.560 
at this point who if you took if you

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.860

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:18.350 
what most people who've never heard of

what most people who've never heard of
it<00:07:18.440> before<00:07:18.620> think<00:07:19.100> and<00:07:19.510> that's<00:07:20.510> pretty<00:07:21.290> rapid

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:22.100 
it before think and that's pretty rapid

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:32.960 
to be so at least in a certain segment

predisposed to pay attention to this

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:44.410 
predisposed to pay attention to this
kind<00:07:38.870> of<00:07:39.050> stuff<00:07:40.180> the<00:07:41.620> the<00:07:42.730> technique<00:07:43.730> has<00:07:44.000> made
