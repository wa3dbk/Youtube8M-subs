00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
far off I was there was a very difficult

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.910 
far off I was there was a very difficult
position<00:00:53.160> also<00:00:53.640> for<00:00:53.910> him<00:00:54.030> yes<00:00:54.960> but<00:00:55.320> he<00:00:55.469> has<00:00:55.649> to

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
position also for him yes but he has to

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.279

you<00:00:56.340> know<00:00:56.460> he<00:00:56.579> has<00:00:56.730> to<00:00:56.879> calculate<00:00:57.329> a<00:00:57.660> few<00:00:57.960> lines

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
you know he has to calculate a few lines

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.529
