portal<00:01:34.439> for<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:35.009> end<00:01:35.280> gateway<00:01:35.820> I've<00:01:36.240> set<00:01:36.780> to<00:01:37.290> a

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
portal for the end gateway I've set to a

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.469 
portal for the end gateway I've set to a
very<00:01:37.710> very<00:01:37.979> specific<00:01:38.549> point<00:01:38.820> now<00:01:39.210> what<00:01:39.360> seems

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
very very specific point now what seems

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.390 
very very specific point now what seems
to<00:01:39.630> happen<00:01:39.840> is<00:01:40.049> it<00:01:40.229> doesn't<00:01:40.470> always<00:01:40.710> spawn

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
to happen is it doesn't always spawn

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.219 
to happen is it doesn't always spawn
exactly<00:01:41.939> at<00:01:42.060> that<00:01:42.299> point<00:01:42.570> now<00:01:42.689> don't<00:01:42.960> know<00:01:43.140> if

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
exactly at that point now don't know if

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.080 
exactly at that point now don't know if
that's<00:01:43.409> intended<00:01:43.799> or<00:01:44.070> that<00:01:44.340> is<00:01:44.460> actually<00:01:44.850> part

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
that's intended or that is actually part

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.210 
that's intended or that is actually part
of<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.780> way<00:01:45.930> that<00:01:46.140> they<00:01:46.259> will<00:01:46.439> function<00:01:46.619> but

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
of the way that they will function but

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.880 
of the way that they will function but
they<00:01:47.340> kind<00:01:47.579> of<00:01:48.110> approximately<00:01:49.110> go<00:01:49.530> to<00:01:49.590> that

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
they kind of approximately go to that

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.950 
they kind of approximately go to that
spot<00:01:50.220> so<00:01:50.460> these<00:01:50.610> are<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.090> two<00:01:51.270> spots<00:01:51.720> that

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
spot so these are the two spots that

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.920 
spot so these are the two spots that
they<00:01:52.229> go<00:01:52.409> to<00:01:53.149> the<00:01:54.149> reason<00:01:54.509> of<00:01:54.600> good<00:01:54.720> legs

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
they go to the reason of good legs

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.219 
they go to the reason of good legs
because<00:01:55.320> I'm<00:01:55.439> just<00:01:55.670> busy<00:01:56.670> rendering<00:01:57.240> the

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
command block that I threw in for storm

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.390 
command block that I threw in for storm
source<00:02:16.930> so<00:02:17.470> basically<00:02:17.709> what<00:02:17.860> happens<00:02:18.160> is<00:02:18.250> when

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
source so basically what happens is when

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.160 
source so basically what happens is when
I<00:02:18.490> chuck<00:02:18.760> it<00:02:18.910> so<00:02:19.150> you<00:02:19.209> can<00:02:19.420> also<00:02:19.540> see<00:02:19.780> it<00:02:19.840> over

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 
here if you have a look at those two

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:24.480 
here if you have a look at those two
lamps<00:02:22.170> one<00:02:23.170> of<00:02:23.260> these<00:02:23.380> is<00:02:23.530> mine<00:02:23.740> so<00:02:24.190> I<00:02:24.220> can<00:02:24.400> add

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
lamps one of these is mine so I can add

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:26.910 
lamps one of these is mine so I can add
any<00:02:24.730> amount<00:02:24.940> of<00:02:25.450> these<00:02:25.720> blocks<00:02:26.080> anywhere<00:02:26.740> in

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
any amount of these blocks anywhere in

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.830 
any amount of these blocks anywhere in
the<00:02:27.069> world<00:02:27.310> and<00:02:27.550> the<00:02:28.000> moment<00:02:28.300> I<00:02:28.360> chuck<00:02:28.690> them

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
the world and the moment I chuck them

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.640 
the world and the moment I chuck them
into<00:02:29.290> it<00:02:29.410> you<00:02:29.950> will<00:02:29.980> see<00:02:30.310> that<00:02:30.520> a<00:02:30.580> roll<00:02:31.180> then

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
into it you will see that a roll then

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.400 
into it you will see that a roll then
drop<00:02:32.650> it<00:02:32.800> to<00:02:33.220> the<00:02:33.520> appropriate<00:02:34.290> mailbox<00:02:35.290> so

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
drop it to the appropriate mailbox so

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:36.900 
drop it to the appropriate mailbox so
there<00:02:35.530> you<00:02:35.590> can<00:02:35.650> see<00:02:35.739> it<00:02:35.950> lets<00:02:36.459> up<00:02:36.640> that<00:02:36.790> one

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
there you can see it lets up that one

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.640 
there you can see it lets up that one
over<00:02:37.150> there<00:02:37.300> and<00:02:37.569> if<00:02:37.660> I<00:02:37.780> then<00:02:37.810> chuck<00:02:38.319> it<00:02:38.470> in

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
over there and if I then chuck it in

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.640 
over there and if I then chuck it in
here<00:02:38.950> let's<00:02:39.880> see<00:02:40.060> and<00:02:40.390> you'll<00:02:40.690> see<00:02:40.900> it<00:02:41.170> lifts

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
here let's see and you'll see it lifts

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.680 
here let's see and you'll see it lifts
it<00:02:41.709> up<00:02:41.860> over<00:02:42.069> there<00:02:42.370> so<00:02:42.910> I<00:02:42.940> can<00:02:43.150> copy<00:02:43.330> these

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
it up over there so I can copy these

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.780 
it up over there so I can copy these
blocks<00:02:44.050> to<00:02:44.200> anywhere<00:02:44.950> in<00:02:45.190> the<00:02:45.340> world<00:02:45.550> and<00:02:45.760> I

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
blocks to anywhere in the world and I

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.670 
blocks to anywhere in the world and I
can<00:02:45.970> have<00:02:46.090> any<00:02:46.360> amount<00:02:46.810> of<00:02:47.080> them<00:02:47.230> anywhere<00:02:47.620> in

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
can have any amount of them anywhere in

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.530 
can have any amount of them anywhere in
the<00:02:47.800> world<00:02:47.980> and<00:02:48.130> people<00:02:49.090> could<00:02:49.209> just<00:02:49.300> drop

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
the world and people could just drop

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.660 
the world and people could just drop
things<00:02:49.840> in<00:02:49.989> and<00:02:50.170> post<00:02:50.500> them<00:02:50.739> to<00:02:50.769> me<00:02:51.070> at<00:02:51.400> the

things in and post them to me at the

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.430 
things in and post them to me at the
moment<00:02:51.700> this<00:02:52.060> is<00:02:52.239> in<00:02:52.570> the<00:02:52.810> actual<00:02:52.989> spawn

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
moment this is in the actual spawn

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.770 
moment this is in the actual spawn
chunks<00:02:53.709> so<00:02:53.860> these<00:02:54.040> are<00:02:54.220> always<00:02:54.489> loaded<00:02:54.780> I'm

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
chunks so these are always loaded I'm

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.660 
chunks so these are always loaded I'm
having<00:02:56.140> issues<00:02:56.440> making<00:02:56.830> this<00:02:56.920> work<00:02:57.190> in<00:02:57.459> the

having issues making this work in the
low<00:02:58.030> chunk<00:02:58.540> loader<00:02:58.810> that<00:02:58.840> I<00:02:58.959> feel<00:02:59.290> that<00:02:59.440> I

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
low chunk loader that I feel that I

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.350 
low chunk loader that I feel that I
showed<00:02:59.769> you<00:02:59.800> guys<00:02:59.920> but<00:03:00.610> I<00:03:00.640> mean<00:03:00.790> for<00:03:01.090> now<00:03:01.180> this

showed you guys but I mean for now this
is<00:03:01.420> a<00:03:01.600> cool<00:03:01.900> concept<00:03:02.110> that<00:03:02.410> does<00:03:03.069> need

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
is a cool concept that does need

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.030 
is a cool concept that does need
refining<00:03:04.350> nothing<00:03:05.350> much<00:03:05.500> I<00:03:05.590> can<00:03:05.620> explain

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
hoppers that feed into this hopper that

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.000
