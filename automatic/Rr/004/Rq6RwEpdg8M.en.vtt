00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.670 
through so much of it let's see if we
can<00:04:28.150> get<00:04:28.240> that<00:04:28.360> last<00:04:28.570> mile<00:04:28.870> before<00:04:29.259> we<00:04:29.380> finish

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
can get that last mile before we finish

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:30.450 
can get that last mile before we finish
up<00:04:29.830> oh<00:04:30.039> here<00:04:30.220> we<00:04:30.310> go

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
up oh here we go

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:37.439 
up oh here we go
so<00:04:31.120> let<00:04:31.330> 9<00:04:31.870> 9<00:04:32.289> so<00:04:33.190> the<00:04:33.310> line<00:04:33.520> here<00:04:34.030> and<00:04:36.449> there's

00:04:37.439 --> 00:04:37.449 
so let 9 9 so the line here and there's

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:40.350 
so let 9 9 so the line here and there's
one<00:04:37.690> last<00:04:37.930> 9<00:04:38.280> and<00:04:39.280> it<00:04:39.370> doesn't<00:04:39.729> go<00:04:39.850> here<00:04:40.120> so

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:40.360 
one last 9 and it doesn't go here so

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:46.800 
one last 9 and it doesn't go here so
that<00:04:40.630> means<00:04:40.870> that<00:04:43.470> and<00:04:45.240> the<00:04:46.240> line<00:04:46.449> will<00:04:46.630> go

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
that means that and the line will go

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:50.879 
that means that and the line will go
here<00:04:47.380> and<00:04:48.280> now<00:04:48.910> our<00:04:49.060> knives<00:04:49.330> are<00:04:49.509> completed<00:04:50.050> ok

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:50.889 
here and now our knives are completed ok

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:58.950 
here and now our knives are completed ok
and<00:04:52.229> maybe<00:04:53.229> not<00:04:56.580> with<00:04:57.580> one<00:04:57.760> last<00:04:57.970> line<00:04:58.240> in<00:04:58.600> that

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 
and maybe not with one last line in that

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:03.360 
and maybe not with one last line in that
line<00:04:59.610> what<00:05:00.610> justice<00:05:01.210> puzzle<00:05:01.570> here<00:05:02.039> this<00:05:03.039> 9

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:03.370 
line what justice puzzle here this 9

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:08.760 
line what justice puzzle here this 9
goes<00:05:04.199> here<00:05:05.199> and<00:05:06.360> this<00:05:07.360> line<00:05:07.660> should<00:05:08.080> be<00:05:08.139> erased

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:08.770 
goes here and this line should be erased

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:13.920 
goes here and this line should be erased
I<00:05:09.250> have<00:05:10.150> a<00:05:10.180> little<00:05:10.419> menu<00:05:12.300> this<00:05:13.300> is<00:05:13.360> the<00:05:13.510> media

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:13.930 
I have a little menu this is the media

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:16.100 
I have a little menu this is the media
button<00:05:14.139> right<00:05:14.410> here<00:05:14.470> that's<00:05:15.070> not<00:05:15.220> like<00:05:15.430> this

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110 
button right here that's not like this

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:19.790 
button right here that's not like this
so<00:05:17.110> you<00:05:17.229> guess<00:05:17.710> you<00:05:17.860> can't<00:05:18.099> really<00:05:18.250> erase<00:05:18.610> a

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
so you guess you can't really erase a

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:23.129 
so you guess you can't really erase a
number<00:05:21.150> yeah<00:05:22.150> for<00:05:22.360> just<00:05:22.509> put<00:05:22.720> a<00:05:22.750> new<00:05:22.930> one<00:05:23.080> in

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:23.139 
number yeah for just put a new one in

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:25.670 
number yeah for just put a new one in
here<00:05:23.500> so<00:05:23.770> that<00:05:23.800> one<00:05:24.099> obviously<00:05:24.310> is<00:05:24.610> incorrect

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:25.680 
here so that one obviously is incorrect

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.230 
here so that one obviously is incorrect
but<00:05:26.680> our<00:05:26.830> last<00:05:27.070> 9<00:05:27.340> would<00:05:27.520> actually<00:05:27.880> go<00:05:28.060> right

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.240 
but our last 9 would actually go right

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:33.330 
but our last 9 would actually go right
here<00:05:30.630> yeah<00:05:31.630> this<00:05:31.780> is<00:05:31.960> this<00:05:32.860> is<00:05:32.949> a<00:05:32.979> little<00:05:33.160> weird

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:33.340 
here yeah this is this is a little weird

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:35.100 
here yeah this is this is a little weird
because<00:05:33.789> you<00:05:34.060> have<00:05:34.180> these<00:05:34.330> dark<00:05:34.599> squares<00:05:34.900> down

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:35.110 
because you have these dark squares down

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:38.399 
because you have these dark squares down
here<00:05:35.349> but<00:05:35.530> they<00:05:35.680> don't<00:05:35.940> actually<00:05:37.349> show<00:05:38.349> you

00:05:38.399 --> 00:05:38.409 
here but they don't actually show you

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:43.469 
here but they don't actually show you
the<00:05:38.530> numbers<00:05:39.039> and<00:05:39.419> then<00:05:41.849> yeah<00:05:42.849> I<00:05:43.120> want<00:05:43.389> to

00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:43.479 
the numbers and then yeah I want to

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:45.540 
the numbers and then yeah I want to
thought<00:05:43.630> that<00:05:43.840> when<00:05:43.990> you<00:05:44.110> finish<00:05:44.500> it<00:05:45.190> was<00:05:45.340> the

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:45.550 
thought that when you finish it was the

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:47.399 
thought that when you finish it was the
number<00:05:45.789> will<00:05:45.909> show<00:05:46.090> up<00:05:46.270> I<00:05:46.570> think<00:05:47.260> maybe

00:05:47.399 --> 00:05:47.409 
number will show up I think maybe

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:48.950 
number will show up I think maybe
because<00:05:47.500> the<00:05:47.770> wrong<00:05:47.919> numbers<00:05:48.220> in<00:05:48.340> here<00:05:48.520> though

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960 
because the wrong numbers in here though

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:54.480 
because the wrong numbers in here though
but<00:05:49.960> anyway<00:05:50.260> that<00:05:50.620> is<00:05:50.650> Sudoku<00:05:51.400> and<00:05:53.340> for<00:05:54.340> some

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:54.490 
but anyway that is Sudoku and for some

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:56.879 
but anyway that is Sudoku and for some
reason<00:05:54.820> this<00:05:55.030> menu<00:05:55.810> button<00:05:56.530> is<00:05:56.650> not<00:05:56.830> working

00:05:56.879 --> 00:05:56.889 
reason this menu button is not working

00:05:56.889 --> 00:06:00.659 
reason this menu button is not working
oh<00:05:58.560> there's<00:05:59.560> another<00:05:59.650> option<00:06:00.039> here<00:06:00.400> where<00:06:00.580> you

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:00.669 
oh there's another option here where you

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:03.779 
oh there's another option here where you
can<00:06:00.789> actually<00:06:01.800> you<00:06:02.800> can<00:06:02.949> put<00:06:03.190> possible

00:06:03.779 --> 00:06:03.789 
can actually you can put possible

00:06:03.789 --> 00:06:05.850 
can actually you can put possible
numbers<00:06:04.120> in<00:06:04.360> that<00:06:04.539> square<00:06:04.870> that's<00:06:05.620> pretty

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:05.860
