00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:10.450 

hi<00:00:07.340> guys<00:00:07.550> so<00:00:07.580> this<00:00:07.880> is<00:00:08.090> my<00:00:08.830> first<00:00:09.830> nutritional

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:10.460 
hi guys so this is my first nutritional

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:12.670 
hi guys so this is my first nutritional
serious<00:00:10.790> video<00:00:11.059> and<00:00:11.389> this<00:00:12.020> is<00:00:12.080> going<00:00:12.230> to<00:00:12.410> be<00:00:12.530> on

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:12.680 
serious video and this is going to be on

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:13.550 
serious video and this is going to be on
why

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:13.560 
why

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.800 
why
diets<00:00:14.040> don't<00:00:14.550> work<00:00:14.760> or<00:00:16.130> about<00:00:17.130> glycogen

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:17.810 
diets don't work or about glycogen

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.650 
diets don't work or about glycogen
synthesis<00:00:18.810> so<00:00:19.380> we<00:00:20.070> have<00:00:20.160> 120<00:00:20.850> grams<00:00:21.119> of

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
synthesis so we have 120 grams of

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.060 
synthesis so we have 120 grams of
glycogen<00:00:22.560> and<00:00:23.010> our<00:00:23.939> liver<00:00:24.240> and<00:00:24.480> 500<00:00:25.320> grams<00:00:25.349> and

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
glycogen and our liver and 500 grams and

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.030 
glycogen and our liver and 500 grams and
our<00:00:26.759> muscle<00:00:27.150> okay<00:00:27.930> so<00:00:27.990> what<00:00:28.290> is<00:00:28.410> glycogen

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:29.040 
our muscle okay so what is glycogen

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.810 
our muscle okay so what is glycogen
glycogen<00:00:29.340> is<00:00:30.859> carbohydrates<00:00:31.859> stored<00:00:32.460> in<00:00:32.730> the

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
glycogen is carbohydrates stored in the

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.280 
glycogen is carbohydrates stored in the
muscle<00:00:33.000> and<00:00:33.510> in<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:34.050> liver<00:00:35.600> now<00:00:36.600> we<00:00:37.050> have

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
muscle and in the liver now we have

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.490 
muscle and in the liver now we have
three<00:00:38.010> grams<00:00:38.280> of<00:00:38.489> water<00:00:39.300> per<00:00:39.840> gram<00:00:40.199> of

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
three grams of water per gram of

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.290 
three grams of water per gram of
glycogen<00:00:40.949> so<00:00:41.519> you<00:00:41.580> can<00:00:41.699> see<00:00:41.850> here<00:00:42.090> we'll<00:00:42.210> go

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
glycogen so you can see here we'll go

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.960 
glycogen so you can see here we'll go
500<00:00:42.690> grams<00:00:42.930> 120<00:00:43.739> grams<00:00:43.980> so<00:00:44.519> we<00:00:44.670> just<00:00:44.820> do<00:00:44.940> a

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:44.970 
500 grams 120 grams so we just do a

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:46.280 
500 grams 120 grams so we just do a
quick<00:00:45.269> calculation

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:46.290 
quick calculation

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.930 
quick calculation
we've<00:00:47.010> got<00:00:47.780> 120<00:00:48.780> grams<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:49.320> liver<00:00:49.530> plus<00:00:50.040> 500

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
we've got 120 grams and liver plus 500

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.380 
we've got 120 grams and liver plus 500
grams<00:00:51.149> in<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.469> muscles<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.280> of<00:00:53.760> course<00:00:54.000> the

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
grams in the muscles and of course the

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.420 
grams in the muscles and of course the
amount<00:00:54.989> in<00:00:55.140> your<00:00:55.170> muscles<00:00:55.680> will<00:00:55.950> vary<00:00:56.190> from

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
amount in your muscles will vary from

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.020 
amount in your muscles will vary from
person<00:00:56.730> to<00:00:57.000> person<00:00:57.210> as<00:00:57.600> more<00:00:58.500> people<00:00:59.030> people

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
person to person as more people people

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.510 
person to person as more people people
with<00:01:00.270> high<00:01:00.870> muscle<00:01:01.379> masses<00:01:01.590> will<00:01:02.100> probably

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
with high muscle masses will probably

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.529 
with high muscle masses will probably
have<00:01:02.730> more<00:01:02.969> stored<00:01:03.979> glycogen<00:01:04.979> so<00:01:05.640> we<00:01:05.940> have<00:01:06.060> 600

00:01:06.529 --> 00:01:06.539 
have more stored glycogen so we have 600

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:09.109 
have more stored glycogen so we have 600
20<00:01:06.810> grams<00:01:07.080> of<00:01:07.470> glycogen<00:01:08.220> all<00:01:08.460> together<00:01:08.789> in<00:01:09.000> our

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
20 grams of glycogen all together in our

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.600 
20 grams of glycogen all together in our
body<00:01:09.420> we<00:01:10.050> times<00:01:10.320> that<00:01:10.590> by<00:01:10.830> three<00:01:12.020> and<00:01:13.369> we<00:01:14.369> get

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
body we times that by three and we get

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.780 
body we times that by three and we get
one<00:01:15.539> point<00:01:15.810> eight<00:01:16.050> six<00:01:16.350> kilos<00:01:16.950> so<00:01:17.399> we<00:01:17.490> have<00:01:17.640> one

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
one point eight six kilos so we have one

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.929 
one point eight six kilos so we have one
point<00:01:18.030> eight<00:01:18.180> six<00:01:18.360> kilos<00:01:18.900> of<00:01:19.549> water<00:01:20.549> and

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
point eight six kilos of water and

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.469 
point eight six kilos of water and
glycogen<00:01:22.250> stored<00:01:23.250> in<00:01:23.369> our<00:01:23.490> body<00:01:23.700> now<00:01:24.420> the

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
glycogen stored in our body now the

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.230 
glycogen stored in our body now the
reason<00:01:25.110> why<00:01:25.229> a<00:01:25.260> low<00:01:25.560> carbohydrate<00:01:25.950> diets<00:01:26.790> work

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
reason why a low carbohydrate diets work

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.280 
reason why a low carbohydrate diets work
and<00:01:28.070> people<00:01:29.210> will<00:01:30.210> they<00:01:30.479> think<00:01:30.540> that<00:01:30.960> it<00:01:31.049> works

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
and people will they think that it works

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.240 
and people will they think that it works
is<00:01:31.729> the<00:01:32.729> fact<00:01:32.939> that<00:01:33.030> they<00:01:33.240> lose<00:01:33.479> weight<00:01:34.250> now

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
is the fact that they lose weight now

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.160 
is the fact that they lose weight now
that<00:01:36.030> way<00:01:36.299> it<00:01:36.360> may<00:01:37.100> well<00:01:38.100> is<00:01:38.340> not<00:01:38.640> fat<00:01:39.180> it<00:01:39.990> will

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
that way it may well is not fat it will

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.200 
that way it may well is not fat it will
not<00:01:40.409> be<00:01:40.560> fat<00:01:40.799> it<00:01:41.040> might<00:01:41.189> be<00:01:41.400> a<00:01:41.430> bit<00:01:41.729> because<00:01:41.970> you

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
not be fat it might be a bit because you

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.830 
not be fat it might be a bit because you
might<00:01:42.390> be<00:01:42.570> Kelly<00:01:42.840> restricting<00:01:43.530> but<00:01:44.840> the

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
might be Kelly restricting but the

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.929 
might be Kelly restricting but the
majority<00:01:46.140> of<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.530> weight<00:01:46.740> will<00:01:47.670> initially

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
majority of the weight will initially

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.990 
majority of the weight will initially
come<00:01:48.450> from<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:49.320> three<00:01:49.740> grams<00:01:50.009> of<00:01:50.280> water<00:01:50.520> per

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
come from the three grams of water per

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.469 
come from the three grams of water per
gram<00:01:51.420> of<00:01:51.689> glycogen<00:01:52.140> so<00:01:52.829> you<00:01:53.220> lose<00:01:53.490> two<00:01:53.820> kilos

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
gram of glycogen so you lose two kilos

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.990 
gram of glycogen so you lose two kilos
that's<00:01:54.930> just<00:01:55.110> for<00:01:55.439> an<00:01:55.500> average<00:01:55.650> person<00:01:56.310> if<00:01:56.850> you

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
that's just for an average person if you

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.460 
that's just for an average person if you
have<00:01:57.060> a<00:01:57.149> lot<00:01:57.329> of<00:01:57.420> muscle<00:01:57.720> mass<00:01:57.750> you<00:01:58.020> might<00:01:58.200> lose

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
have a lot of muscle mass you might lose

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.999 
have a lot of muscle mass you might lose
say<00:01:58.829> four<00:01:59.610> or<00:01:59.640> five<00:01:59.759> kilos<00:02:00.619> and<00:02:01.619> probably<00:02:01.950> not

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
say four or five kilos and probably not

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.920 
say four or five kilos and probably not
that<00:02:02.159> much<00:02:02.369> but<00:02:02.670> you<00:02:02.700> lose<00:02:03.000> you<00:02:03.360> lose<00:02:03.390> a<00:02:03.600> lot<00:02:03.869> of

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
that much but you lose you lose a lot of

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.410 
that much but you lose you lose a lot of
water<00:02:04.320> weight<00:02:04.590> and<00:02:04.950> a<00:02:05.759> lot<00:02:05.909> of<00:02:05.939> glycogen

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
water weight and a lot of glycogen

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.100 
water weight and a lot of glycogen
storage<00:02:07.399> so<00:02:08.399> that's<00:02:08.610> why<00:02:08.790> low<00:02:09.420> carbohydrate

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
storage so that's why low carbohydrate

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.520 
storage so that's why low carbohydrate
diets<00:02:10.470> don't<00:02:10.619> work<00:02:10.970> and<00:02:12.890> what's<00:02:13.890> better<00:02:14.340> is

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
diets don't work and what's better is

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.569 
diets don't work and what's better is
moderating<00:02:16.530> your<00:02:16.560> or<00:02:17.420> monitoring<00:02:18.420> your

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:19.579 
moderating your or monitoring your

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:23.030 
moderating your or monitoring your
energy<00:02:20.579> density<00:02:21.060> or<00:02:21.090> the<00:02:22.080> amount<00:02:22.650> of<00:02:22.770> calories

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
energy density or the amount of calories

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.970 
energy density or the amount of calories
you<00:02:23.280> consume<00:02:23.520> every<00:02:24.000> day<00:02:24.030> and<00:02:24.739> trying<00:02:25.739> to<00:02:25.830> get
