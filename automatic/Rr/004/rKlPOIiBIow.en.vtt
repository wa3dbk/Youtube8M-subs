00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:19.189
 maybe nobody night means stupid well so 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:22.140
 there is a very expensive balcony 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:25.230
 despite the fact that he is no video yet, and 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:28.070
 I don't see the image on 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:31.610
 the screen when I connect to the motherboard 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:34.500
 wires and take off or displayport 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:35.969
 Yes, you might think that here you have 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.309
 no video card you are you fool 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.320
 include wires in the motherboard and 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.120
 try to turn on without a video card 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:47.850
 no image i'm not stupid 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:51.539
 4770 processor which has in itself 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:54.899
 integrated video card no rocks 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.820
 video card near video chip from intel intel hd 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:01.079
 graphics 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:03.300
 graphics from intel shorter than 4006 4600 should 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.830
 work that is according to the idea when we 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.640
 we insert a wire behind 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:11.220
 namely here in one of the connectors 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:13.710
 hdmi evanusom hours focusing sorry that 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:20.610
 my hands are shaking with Dima 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:22.909
 or here displayport is inserted in general 2 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:26.189
 hd may and 1 displayport 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:28.500
 I insert everything when enabled 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.060
 computer and I have no image 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:35.509
 not shown except 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:37.829
 no signal let me turn on right now 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:39.740
 developed a green all pretty 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:47.610
 and 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:50.100
 here's a post for a cat I have a60 and 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:54.270
 charm is likely but because it is not 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:56.670
 similar to 6 this b &amp; b everything turns all 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:01.440
 everything goes well everything works according to 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:05.930
 scott b both switches belson on 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:11.489
 twos stand as they were 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:14.280
 reset the BIOS settings I already did everything 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:18.569
 I'm kind of okay, everything is inserted. 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:25.700
 need all the wires need no drive 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:28.319
 there seems to be no general, everything should work 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:34.160
 video quality will not be very good 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:37.040
 because he did not want atticus 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:41.190
 no matter in general help than you can 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:45.440
 why video may not work for me 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:49.410
 there because here now look i 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:51.769
 displayport and this adapter hdmi and 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.769
 displayport 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:03:01.070
 Here and again I try to put the insert 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:08.579
 so bank critic displayport I don't know 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:12.900
 how well I can see 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:19.230
 put in all the clothes I press my son 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:22.410
 should have been there and in short nothing 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:25.519
 unfortunately nothing happens 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:31.799
 there is no 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:34.500
 there is such a mode, and if there's a 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:38.340
 look but by virtue of new and new dima 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:42.580
 there is no signal though here here is busy 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:47.349
 everything is connected where you need here are the keys 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:49.540
 new dima and the entrance is very everything 

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:52.480
 connected but nichrome not working i'm without 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:58.500
 concepts why let's try 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:58.500
 pull out displayport and connect 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:06.640
 connect standard standard shoot 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:08.129
 here's the cable and take off any of the connectors 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:14.110
 on the computer 

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:18.820
 so here I am the first to insert here and here 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:20.669
 that there is no signal we have no signal why 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:27.160
 I have no idea 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:30.040
 insert the shaft 2 so here are the bottom 2 removing 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:37.320
 became the top of the bottom insert here 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:39.120
 I put and here we have a 5 and there is no signal 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:49.030
 cable with dima 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:51.460
 works i'm pretty sure it works here 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:54.460
 this monitor works because it's on 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:59.470
 in fact, it is there 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:05:00.700
 inside and all this disk and fire in it 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:02.440
 everything inside is built in we need 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:04.840
 you can use it as a monitor 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.320
 and here I am planning to use as long as 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.120

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:08.860

 I beg you what options are there 

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:22.120
 maybe without buying a video card that 

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:24.270
