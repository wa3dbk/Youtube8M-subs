 which is because it was super and accepted 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.330

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.560
 it was very interesting to me 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.570
 it was to prove myself because it was gone 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.210

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.100
 travel and at least live for 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.740

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:29.790

 to convey to people the information that is 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:46.260
 a business that is an option well beyond 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:48.060

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.239

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.739
