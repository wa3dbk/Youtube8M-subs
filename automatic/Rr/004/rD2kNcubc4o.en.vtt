00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:06.640
 hello welcome and today what are we going 

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:10.809
 to do is let's isolate a wall 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:14.590
 typical elevated exterior using this 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:19.900
 product the rocks or worth 23 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:22.630
 comfort but good is a product that is 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:26.769
 easy to use when you have the walls 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:29.079
 exteriors that are almost always 2 x 6 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:31.329
 this product comes from five and a half already 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:33.610
 then it fits perfectly in 

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:35.710
 any of these cavities then 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:38.770
 it's a matter of putting them in the trained 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:41.730
 grab this product let's grab the 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:41.730
 scale k 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:49.980
 and put it in and as always 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.820
 place 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.820
 to tighten 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:01:03.470
 and drop I have a list and how they see 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:06.650
 it is tight 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:08.810
 and this product does not come out because it's 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.890
 rigid 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:15.500
 good after 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.500
 the other one easily 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:25.320
 and it's the same thing is to place 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.320
 to tighten 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:33.310
 and drop good 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:35.770
 you do not always have a space of 2 x 6 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:39.550
 many times in an old house one 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:44.560
 has the trained 2 x 4 and it's there 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:48.430
 when one has to use the rock r15 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:51.040
 soul comfort bad but in one in a 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:56.979
 wall of 2 x 6 one can use the 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:59.290
 network 23 now if one wants to use in the r 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:03.100
 23 and have more value 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:06.270
 r is good to use the 2 x 4 to put a 2 x 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:10.530
 2 above and there you have created 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:12.209
 the interspersed 2 x 6 and you can have more 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.830
 r value 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:17.410
 and that what we want to create many times 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:20.890
 to save the energy 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:25.840
 well many times also one gets to 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:29.260
 a space that is not 16 to the center 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:31.870
 and here what is there is less than 16 centers 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:34.629
 and we are going to measure 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:37.450
 here we have 9 because there is a room 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:39.849
 then you can easily cut this 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.590
 product and always when it is cut there 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:44.170
 to use these knives that are like a 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:48.120
 knife to cut bread because this you 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:50.190
 going to give a cleaner cut 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.640
 and easily one can cut this 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.640
 product 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:58.409
 let's swallow now yeah let's look at it is not a 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.290
 we'll cut it a little bit more 

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:04.290
 a half inch to an inch more so that 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:07.349
 be right in the trained that 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:10.760
 we are using this from north we are going to 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:10.760
 use let's cut to 10 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.820
 there is 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:31.540
 on the scale to get back to the 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:36.430
 space that we need we put it 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:39.269
 and as we are seeing it is always to place 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.269
 to tighten 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:46.860
 and drop 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:49.799
 there we are now again we are 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:53.000
 ready to put the plastic barrier 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:53.000
 for the steam 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:04:00.520
 well again here we are and we have already 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:02.020
 installed our comfort but r23 in the 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:05.410
 wall and 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:07.570
 the plastic barrier has been placed against 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:09.430
 the steam then what needs to be done 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:12.670
 now it is to make sure that they are always 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:17.440
 one over the other at least two 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:20.470
 inches between one plastic the other for 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.500
 that really create a barrier against 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:25.800
 the steam 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:30.510
 you use this this is the red tape 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:33.440
 it's called tactile and making sure it's 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.440
 capture 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:37.250
 ah 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:49.260
 and there it is 

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:52.020
 we have created a vapor barrier 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:54.690
 always worrying that the air 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:56.570
 hot that is inside your house not 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:05:00.630
 mix with the air the outside 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:04.710
 and creating humidity inside the wall 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:07.410
 that can bring proliferation 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:09.330
 mojo and mushrooms and that's what we're 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:11.310
 trying to prevent with this then 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:14.990
 we are ready, we have already created the 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:14.990
 generation barrier
