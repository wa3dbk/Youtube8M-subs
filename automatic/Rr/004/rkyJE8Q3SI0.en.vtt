is a difference between the cars used in
rocket<00:00:06.960> League<00:00:07.230> so<00:00:07.740> I'm<00:00:08.010> going<00:00:08.189> to<00:00:08.220> take<00:00:08.400> a

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
rocket League so I'm going to take a

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.580 
rocket League so I'm going to take a
look<00:00:08.730> at<00:00:08.849> the<00:00:08.970> five<00:00:09.269> most<00:00:09.540> commonly<00:00:09.900> used<00:00:10.200> cars

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
look at the five most commonly used cars

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.980 
look at the five most commonly used cars
online<00:00:11.130> including<00:00:11.820> the<00:00:12.150> biggest<00:00:12.450> in<00:00:12.690> a<00:00:12.780> small

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
online including the biggest in a small

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.959 
online including the biggest in a small
list<00:00:13.170> and<00:00:13.349> see<00:00:13.769> how<00:00:13.920> their<00:00:14.099> hitbox<00:00:14.460> is<00:00:14.639> alter

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
list and see how their hitbox is alter

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.430 
list and see how their hitbox is alter
the<00:00:15.059> way<00:00:15.210> they<00:00:15.389> hit<00:00:15.570> the<00:00:15.660> ball<00:00:15.780> from<00:00:16.080> kickoff

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
the way they hit the ball from kickoff

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.830 
the way they hit the ball from kickoff
I'll<00:00:17.190> be<00:00:17.340> doing<00:00:17.580> this<00:00:17.699> using<00:00:17.940> a<00:00:18.270> diagram<00:00:18.779> of

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
I'll be doing this using a diagram of

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.689 
I'll be doing this using a diagram of
the<00:00:19.020> stadium<00:00:19.500> and<00:00:19.619> marking<00:00:20.130> on<00:00:20.250> it<00:00:20.279> where<00:00:20.580> the

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
the stadium and marking on it where the

00:00:20.699 --> 00:01:30.580 
the stadium and marking on it where the
ball<00:00:20.880> lands<00:00:21.300> after<00:00:21.510> it's<00:00:21.779> been<00:00:21.900> kicked

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.960 

so<00:01:31.590> as<00:01:31.740> you<00:01:31.890> just<00:01:31.920> saw<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.280> ball<00:01:32.520> landed<00:01:32.790> in

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
so as you just saw the ball landed in

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.490 
so as you just saw the ball landed in
such<00:01:33.180> tight<00:01:33.540> grouping<00:01:33.960> there's<00:01:34.140> very<00:01:34.350> little

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
such tight grouping there's very little

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.230 
such tight grouping there's very little
to<00:01:34.770> differentiate<00:01:35.370> between<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.790> cars<00:01:36.000> when

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
to differentiate between the cars when

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.450 
to differentiate between the cars when
you<00:01:36.360> kick<00:01:36.540> off<00:01:36.690> without<00:01:36.900> boost<00:01:37.370> depending<00:01:38.370> on

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
you kick off without boost depending on

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.650 
you kick off without boost depending on
your<00:01:38.580> level<00:01:38.730> of<00:01:38.880> play<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.210> results<00:01:39.540> could

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:39.660 
your level of play the results could

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:40.910 
your level of play the results could
still<00:01:39.870> be<00:01:39.960> important<00:01:40.410> so<00:01:40.470> it's<00:01:40.710> worth

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
still be important so it's worth

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.260 
still be important so it's worth
mentioning<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.370> breakout<00:01:41.790> on<00:01:41.940> the<00:01:42.030> Merc<00:01:42.240> with

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
mentioning the breakout on the Merc with

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.390 
mentioning the breakout on the Merc with
the<00:01:42.540> outliers<00:01:42.900> their<00:01:43.410> shots<00:01:43.680> both<00:01:43.920> landed

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:44.400 
the outliers their shots both landed

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.980 
the outliers their shots both landed
further<00:01:44.610> away<00:01:44.940> from<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.240> goal<00:01:45.420> and<00:01:45.570> the

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
further away from the goal and the

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.750 
further away from the goal and the
Paladin<00:01:46.410> had<00:01:46.560> slightly<00:01:46.950> more<00:01:47.100> airtime<00:01:47.430> before

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:47.760 
Paladin had slightly more airtime before

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.880 
Paladin had slightly more airtime before
the<00:01:47.850> ball<00:01:48.000> landed<00:01:48.360> when<00:01:49.290> you<00:01:49.380> use<00:01:49.590> boosts

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
the ball landed when you use boosts

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.110 
the ball landed when you use boosts
though<00:01:50.160> there<00:01:50.490> is<00:01:50.610> one<00:01:50.760> very<00:01:51.000> obvious

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:51.120 
though there is one very obvious

00:01:51.120 --> 00:02:55.420 
though there is one very obvious
difference

this is the only difference between the

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.670 
this is the only difference between the
cars<00:03:15.240> that<00:03:15.450> I'd<00:03:15.570> say<00:03:15.780> every<00:03:16.050> player<00:03:16.320> has<00:03:16.530> to

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
cars that I'd say every player has to

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.500 
cars that I'd say every player has to
look<00:03:16.800> out<00:03:17.010> for<00:03:17.250> and<00:03:17.520> it's<00:03:18.030> probably<00:03:18.270> the

look out for and it's probably the

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.000

reason<00:03:18.660> why<00:03:18.930> so<00:03:19.170> many<00:03:19.200> people<00:03:19.470> in<00:03:19.830> ranked

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010
