you them what I've done so far I'll be
adding<00:00:36.000> some<00:00:36.210> other<00:00:36.450> stuff<00:00:36.690> on<00:00:36.870> my<00:00:37.050> screen

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:38.420 
adding some other stuff on my screen

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.510 
adding some other stuff on my screen
staff<00:00:39.420> and<00:00:39.690> some<00:00:39.840> more<00:00:40.070> pickups<00:00:41.070> like<00:00:41.280> herbs

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520

staff and some more pickups like herbs
and<00:00:41.850> stuff<00:00:41.910> like<00:00:42.090> that<00:00:42.149> and<00:00:42.300> another<00:00:43.170> bits<00:00:43.440> and

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
and stuff like that and another bits and

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:44.930 
and stuff like that and another bits and
bobs<00:00:43.739> but<00:00:43.980> it's<00:00:44.129> not<00:00:44.280> anything<00:00:44.460> special<00:00:44.700> at

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
bobs but it's not anything special at

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.310 
bobs but it's not anything special at
the<00:00:45.000> moment<00:00:45.360> but<00:00:45.510> it's<00:00:45.690> just<00:00:45.870> a<00:00:45.960> proof<00:00:46.200> of

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
the moment but it's just a proof of

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.720 
the moment but it's just a proof of
concept<00:00:46.500> to<00:00:46.890> prove<00:00:47.100> that<00:00:47.219> it's<00:00:47.370> going<00:00:47.460> to<00:00:47.550> work

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
concept to prove that it's going to work

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:57.939 
concept to prove that it's going to work
like<00:00:47.969> so<00:00:48.239> here<00:00:49.079> we<00:00:49.170> go<00:00:55.850> as<00:00:56.850> you<00:00:56.969> can<00:00:57.090> see
