middle of all of a sudden you'll realize

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.690 
middle of all of a sudden you'll realize
I<00:01:41.210> don't<00:01:41.479> have<00:01:41.869> half<00:01:42.170> a<00:01:42.290> haircut<00:01:42.680> left<00:01:42.979> I<00:01:43.250> don't

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
I don't have half a haircut left I don't

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.570 
I don't have half a haircut left I don't
even<00:01:43.820> have<00:01:44.060> 40%<00:01:44.630> left<00:01:45.290> I<00:01:45.500> would<00:01:45.920> argue<00:01:46.100> at<00:01:46.400> that

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:46.580 
even have 40% left I would argue at that

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.330 
even have 40% left I would argue at that
point<00:01:46.880> you'll<00:01:47.060> have<00:01:47.090> about<00:01:47.509> 15%<00:01:48.350> of<00:01:48.860> a<00:01:48.920> haircut

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
point you'll have about 15% of a haircut

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:54.280 
point you'll have about 15% of a haircut
remaining<00:01:50.090> which<00:01:50.869> will<00:01:51.110> finish<00:01:51.350> at<00:01:52.180> 75%<00:01:53.290> which

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
remaining which will finish at 75% which

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.030 
remaining which will finish at 75% which
will<00:01:54.530> bring<00:01:54.799> you<00:01:55.100> to<00:01:55.310> the<00:01:55.400> finish<00:01:55.610> line

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:57.040 
will bring you to the finish line

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.609 
will bring you to the finish line
25%<00:01:58.040> sooner<00:01:58.970> that's<00:01:59.450> the<00:01:59.750> power<00:01:59.960> of<00:02:00.140> lining

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 
25% sooner that's the power of lining

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:02.380 
25% sooner that's the power of lining
and<00:02:00.740> edging<00:02:00.920> a<00:02:00.979> haircut<00:02:01.310> never<00:02:01.640> looks<00:02:02.030> done

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
and edging a haircut never looks done

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.630 
and edging a haircut never looks done
until<00:02:03.380> it's<00:02:03.560> lying<00:02:03.829> at<00:02:04.009> edge<00:02:04.130> but<00:02:04.340> I<00:02:04.369> would

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
until it's lying at edge but I would

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.090 
until it's lying at edge but I would
argue<00:02:04.670> a<00:02:05.329> haircut<00:02:05.930> will<00:02:06.140> look<00:02:06.439> done<00:02:07.070> err

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
argue a haircut will look done err

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.669 
argue a haircut will look done err
sooner<00:02:08.060> forgive<00:02:08.750> me<00:02:08.899> for<00:02:09.049> making<00:02:09.200> up<00:02:09.440> a<00:02:09.500> word

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
but it helps me make my point

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.819 
but it helps me make my point
look<00:02:11.420> at<00:02:11.510> my<00:02:11.600> mannequin<00:02:12.079> here<00:02:12.260> we've<00:02:12.650> only

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
done about half the haircut that haircut

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.990 
done about half the haircut that haircut
doesn't<00:02:14.989> look<00:02:15.290> done<00:02:15.560> on<00:02:16.100> the<00:02:16.220> opposite<00:02:16.730> side

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
doesn't look done on the opposite side

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.330 
doesn't look done on the opposite side
of<00:02:17.030> the<00:02:17.209> haircut<00:02:17.660> I<00:02:17.870> lined<00:02:18.620> and<00:02:18.769> edged<00:02:18.919> it<00:02:19.160> and

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
of the haircut I lined and edged it and

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:20.470 
of the haircut I lined and edged it and
look<00:02:19.609> how<00:02:19.910> much

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
look how much

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.960 
look how much
closer<00:02:20.930> to<00:02:20.989> finish<00:02:21.379> this<00:02:21.620> side<00:02:21.890> looks<00:02:22.280> just

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
closer to finish this side looks just

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.460 
closer to finish this side looks just
because<00:02:23.450> the<00:02:23.599> lining<00:02:23.810> and<00:02:23.959> edging<00:02:24.230> has<00:02:24.319> been

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
because the lining and edging has been
