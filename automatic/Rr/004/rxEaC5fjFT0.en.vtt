00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
partially peel it like this if you'd

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.120 
partially peel it like this if you'd
like<00:00:27.660> you<00:00:27.869> can<00:00:28.019> peel<00:00:28.199> it<00:00:28.349> all<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.560> way<00:00:28.680> it's<00:00:29.010> up

like you can peel it all the way it's up

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.429 
like you can peel it all the way it's up
to<00:00:29.310> you<00:00:29.490> I<00:00:29.760> like<00:00:30.240> a<00:00:30.269> little<00:00:30.510> bit<00:00:30.779> of<00:00:30.810> green<00:00:31.140> and

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
to you I like a little bit of green and

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.770 
to you I like a little bit of green and
then<00:00:32.099> what<00:00:32.430> I'll<00:00:32.520> do<00:00:32.730> is<00:00:32.759> I'm<00:00:33.270> going<00:00:33.420> to<00:00:33.510> split

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
then what I'll do is I'm going to split

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.180 
then what I'll do is I'm going to split
this<00:00:33.899> in<00:00:34.079> half<00:00:34.260> and<00:00:34.790> I'm<00:00:35.790> gonna<00:00:35.940> seed<00:00:36.390> it<00:00:36.660> and

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.190 
this in half and I'm gonna seed it and

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.790 
this in half and I'm gonna seed it and
my<00:00:38.190> favorite<00:00:38.399> way<00:00:38.730> of<00:00:38.760> seeding<00:00:39.360> it<00:00:39.540> is<00:00:39.719> using<00:00:40.530> a

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
my favorite way of seeding it is using a

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.940 
my favorite way of seeding it is using a
spoon<00:00:41.670> just<00:00:42.360> goes<00:00:42.540> in<00:00:42.750> nice<00:00:42.899> and<00:00:43.230> smooth<00:00:43.530> and

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
spoon just goes in nice and smooth and

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.279 
spoon just goes in nice and smooth and
you<00:00:44.789> don't<00:00:44.969> need<00:00:45.149> to<00:00:45.210> do<00:00:45.510> this<00:00:45.719> step<00:00:45.899> but<00:00:46.260> I

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
you don't need to do this step but I

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.950 
you don't need to do this step but I
prefer<00:00:46.800> it<00:00:46.980> so<00:00:47.700> we're<00:00:47.820> gonna<00:00:47.879> see<00:00:48.210> that<00:00:48.510> and

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
prefer it so we're gonna see that and

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.889 
prefer it so we're gonna see that and
with<00:00:49.950> both<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.430> cucumber<00:00:50.969> and<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.210> onion<00:00:51.690> I'm

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
going to show you another step which

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.479 
going to show you another step which

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
bottom off of that okay

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.170 
bottom off of that okay
then<00:02:03.850> we'll<00:02:04.240> move<00:02:04.420> over<00:02:04.630> to<00:02:04.810> the<00:02:05.229> mozzarella

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:30.519 
how to stack this for the great

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:32.820 
how to stack this for the great
presentation<00:02:31.209> so<00:02:31.750> I'm<00:02:31.840> going<00:02:32.019> to<00:02:32.140> start<00:02:32.470> by

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
presentation so I'm going to start by

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.460 
presentation so I'm going to start by
putting<00:02:33.580> some<00:02:33.730> olive<00:02:34.360> oil<00:02:34.540> and<00:02:34.959> a<00:02:35.260> balsamic

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
putting some olive oil and a balsamic

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.000 
putting some olive oil and a balsamic
glaze<00:02:36.370> on<00:02:36.819> the<00:02:37.060> plate<00:02:37.330> so<00:02:37.630> balsamic<00:02:38.500> glaze<00:02:38.739> is

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
glaze on the plate so balsamic glaze is

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.070 
glaze on the plate so balsamic glaze is
a<00:02:39.040> balsamic<00:02:39.489> that's<00:02:39.910> been<00:02:40.120> cooked<00:02:40.420> down<00:02:40.540> and

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
a balsamic that's been cooked down and

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.770 
a balsamic that's been cooked down and
you'll<00:02:42.040> see<00:02:42.100> that<00:02:42.400> it's<00:02:42.549> quite<00:02:43.269> a<00:02:43.299> bit<00:02:43.510> thicker

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
you'll see that it's quite a bit thicker

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.850 
you'll see that it's quite a bit thicker
than<00:02:45.750> you<00:02:46.750> know<00:02:46.870> just<00:02:46.900> the<00:02:47.290> regular<00:02:47.440> balsamic

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
than you know just the regular balsamic

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.370

vinegar<00:02:48.610> and<00:02:48.819> that<00:02:49.180> gives<00:02:49.390> me<00:02:49.540> a<00:02:49.569> nice<00:02:49.810> place

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
vinegar and that gives me a nice place

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.320 
vinegar and that gives me a nice place
to<00:02:50.410> start<00:02:50.830> plating<00:02:51.190> I'm<00:02:51.849> going<00:02:52.030> to<00:02:52.120> take<00:02:52.299> a

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
to start plating I'm going to take a

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.380 
to start plating I'm going to take a
little<00:02:52.540> bit<00:02:52.720> of<00:02:52.780> this<00:02:53.190> cucumber<00:02:54.239> and<00:02:55.239> it's

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
little bit of this cucumber and it's

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.390 
little bit of this cucumber and it's
nice<00:02:55.569> and<00:02:55.780> cured<00:02:56.110> see<00:02:56.530> so<00:02:56.920> it's<00:02:57.040> not<00:02:57.160> going<00:02:57.340> to

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
nice and cured see so it's not going to

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.699 
nice and cured see so it's not going to
repeat<00:02:57.760> on<00:02:57.819> you<00:02:58.209> it's<00:02:58.480> kind<00:02:58.720> of<00:02:58.780> good<00:02:58.959> that<00:02:58.989> way

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
building then I'm gonna start with a

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.039 
building then I'm gonna start with a
smaller<00:03:08.290> piece<00:03:08.680> of<00:03:08.829> the<00:03:08.950> tomato<00:03:09.390> just<00:03:10.390> anchor

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:11.049 
smaller piece of the tomato just anchor

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:13.979 
smaller piece of the tomato just anchor
that<00:03:11.200> in<00:03:11.470> there<00:03:11.739> and<00:03:12.070> I<00:03:12.790> always<00:03:12.940> like<00:03:13.239> to<00:03:13.269> do<00:03:13.630> a

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:30.579 
little bit of a fun building process

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:33.870 
little bit of a fun building process
I'll<00:03:31.090> go<00:03:31.450> with<00:03:31.600> the<00:03:31.720> next<00:03:31.959> size<00:03:32.579> right<00:03:33.579> there

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
I'll go with the next size right there
