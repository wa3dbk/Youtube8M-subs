it okay I will say this is not musically
necessary<00:02:10.649> although<00:02:10.860> any<00:02:11.250> time<00:02:11.430> you<00:02:11.520> play

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
necessary although any time you play

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.760 
necessary although any time you play
open-handed<00:02:12.330> it

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
open-handed it

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.530 
open-handed it
ends<00:02:12.860> up<00:02:13.010> other<00:02:13.220> voices<00:02:13.520> to<00:02:13.880> that<00:02:14.150> wouldn't

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
ends up other voices to that wouldn't

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.540 
ends up other voices to that wouldn't
normally<00:02:15.080> and<00:02:15.560> stickings<00:02:16.070> that<00:02:16.190> you<00:02:16.280> wouldn't

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
normally and stickings that you wouldn't

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.100 
normally and stickings that you wouldn't
normally<00:02:16.670> think<00:02:16.910> of<00:02:17.210> so<00:02:17.420> don't<00:02:17.630> discount<00:02:18.020> it

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
normally think of so don't discount it

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.140 
normally think of so don't discount it
just<00:02:18.290> because<00:02:18.530> it's<00:02:18.650> a<00:02:18.710> little<00:02:18.920> showy<00:02:19.150> now

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
just because it's a little showy now

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
just because it's a little showy now
essentially<00:02:20.630> we're<00:02:20.720> going<00:02:20.840> to<00:02:20.900> do<00:02:20.960> two

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
essentially we're going to do two

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.590 
essentially we're going to do two
stickings<00:02:21.620> foot<00:02:22.430> foot<00:02:22.730> right<00:02:22.970> left<00:02:23.270> is<00:02:23.450> going

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
stickings foot foot right left is going

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.020 
stickings foot foot right left is going
to<00:02:23.660> be<00:02:23.750> sticking<00:02:24.170> number<00:02:24.410> one<00:02:24.760> foot<00:02:25.760> foot

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
to be sticking number one foot foot

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.940 
to be sticking number one foot foot
right<00:02:26.390> left<00:02:26.660> right<00:02:26.900> left<00:02:26.960> is<00:02:27.560> going<00:02:27.800> to<00:02:27.860> be

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
right left right left is going to be

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.980 
right left right left is going to be
sticking<00:02:28.340> number<00:02:28.580> two<00:02:28.790> so<00:02:29.150> for<00:02:29.450> sticking<00:02:29.840> and

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:29.990 
sticking number two so for sticking and

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:32.410 
sticking number two so for sticking and
a<00:02:30.350> six<00:02:30.620> notes<00:02:30.860> ticking<00:02:31.250> okay<00:02:31.670> now<00:02:32.120> we're<00:02:32.330> going

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
a six notes ticking okay now we're going

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.600 
a six notes ticking okay now we're going
to<00:02:32.510> use<00:02:32.720> those<00:02:32.930> with<00:02:33.200> sextuplets<00:02:33.710> we<00:02:34.340> all<00:02:34.460> know

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
to use those with sextuplets we all know

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.190 
to use those with sextuplets we all know
that<00:02:34.640> there's<00:02:34.940> six<00:02:35.210> notes<00:02:35.480> in<00:02:35.750> a<00:02:35.840> quarter<00:02:36.170> note

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
that there's six notes in a quarter note

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.410 
that there's six notes in a quarter note
and<00:02:36.530> if<00:02:36.620> we<00:02:36.680> were<00:02:36.830> in<00:02:36.920> a<00:02:36.980> bar<00:02:37.190> for<00:02:37.550> four<00:02:37.850> how

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
and if we were in a bar for four how

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.420 
and if we were in a bar for four how
many<00:02:38.660> quarter<00:02:39.080> notes<00:02:39.290> are<00:02:39.470> in<00:02:39.590> there<00:02:39.800> four<00:02:40.310> of

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
many quarter notes are in there four of

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.120 
many quarter notes are in there four of
them<00:02:40.490> so<00:02:41.030> we've<00:02:41.240> got<00:02:41.420> how<00:02:41.870> many<00:02:41.930> sextuplets<00:02:42.680> d

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
them so we've got how many sextuplets d

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.700 
them so we've got how many sextuplets d
four<00:02:43.400> times<00:02:43.610> it's<00:02:43.940> math<00:02:44.300> is<00:02:44.540> 24<00:02:45.140> right<00:02:45.380> we<00:02:45.590> got

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:45.710 
four times it's math is 24 right we got

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:49.450 
four times it's math is 24 right we got
24<00:02:46.250> so<00:02:46.640> 6<00:02:46.850> plus<00:02:46.970> 6<00:02:47.030> plus<00:02:47.270> 6<00:02:47.390> plus<00:02:47.600> 6<00:02:47.750> is<00:02:48.140> 24<00:02:48.830> now

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:49.460 
24 so 6 plus 6 plus 6 plus 6 is 24 now

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:50.770 
24 so 6 plus 6 plus 6 plus 6 is 24 now
let's<00:02:49.730> take<00:02:49.880> those<00:02:50.090> stickings<00:02:50.480> how<00:02:50.600> many

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
let's take those stickings how many

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.090 
let's take those stickings how many
times<00:02:51.020> could<00:02:51.170> we<00:02:51.320> repeat<00:02:51.590> those<00:02:51.740> stickings

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
times could we repeat those stickings

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.500 
times could we repeat those stickings
and<00:02:52.220> come<00:02:52.370> out<00:02:52.460> with<00:02:52.490> 24<00:02:52.970> notes<00:02:53.090> and<00:02:53.300> come<00:02:53.420> out

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
and come out with 24 notes and come out

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.030 
and come out with 24 notes and come out
on<00:02:53.540> one<00:02:53.840> well<00:02:54.230> we<00:02:54.470> could<00:02:54.590> take<00:02:54.710> the<00:02:54.860> one

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
on one well we could take the one

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.550 
on one well we could take the one
sticking<00:02:55.400> the<00:02:55.790> foot<00:02:56.300> foot<00:02:56.540> right<00:02:56.720> left<00:02:56.990> we

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
sticking the foot foot right left we

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:58.990 
sticking the foot foot right left we
play<00:02:57.710> at<00:02:57.740> three<00:02:58.100> times<00:02:58.340> and<00:02:58.640> we<00:02:58.730> could<00:02:58.850> play

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
play at three times and we could play

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.160 
play at three times and we could play
the<00:02:59.120> foot<00:02:59.330> foot<00:02:59.510> right<00:02:59.720> left<00:02:59.930> right<00:03:00.110> left

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
the foot foot right left right left

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:05.260 
the foot foot right left right left
twice<00:03:00.890> and<00:03:01.280> that<00:03:02.060> would<00:03:02.270> be<00:03:03.730> 24<00:03:04.730> notes<00:03:04.850> right

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:05.270 
twice and that would be 24 notes right

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:06.700 
twice and that would be 24 notes right
right<00:03:05.600> I'm<00:03:05.810> winning<00:03:06.080> it's<00:03:06.230> like<00:03:06.380> Blue's<00:03:06.620> Clues

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:06.710 
right I'm winning it's like Blue's Clues

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:08.280 
right I'm winning it's like Blue's Clues
I'm<00:03:06.980> waiting<00:03:07.280> for<00:03:07.310> you<00:03:07.550> to<00:03:07.580> respond<00:03:08.060> right

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
I'm waiting for you to respond right

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.650 
I'm waiting for you to respond right
it's<00:03:09.290> been<00:03:09.440> way<00:03:09.590> too<00:03:09.620> much<00:03:09.860> time<00:03:10.100> with<00:03:10.220> my<00:03:10.310> kids

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
it's been way too much time with my kids

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.420 
it's been way too much time with my kids
so<00:03:11.660> if<00:03:11.960> we<00:03:12.230> were<00:03:12.320> to<00:03:12.380> take<00:03:12.560> that<00:03:12.710> now<00:03:12.860> that<00:03:13.190> that

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
so if we were to take that now that that

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:14.590 
so if we were to take that now that that
doesn't<00:03:13.610> sound<00:03:13.880> interesting<00:03:13.940> to<00:03:14.300> me<00:03:14.390> but

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
doesn't sound interesting to me but

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.220 
doesn't sound interesting to me but
maybe<00:03:15.110> we<00:03:15.320> do<00:03:15.500> one<00:03:16.130> two<00:03:16.550> one<00:03:17.000> two<00:03:17.060> one<00:03:17.600> when<00:03:18.140> it

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
maybe we do one two one two one when it

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:19.360 
maybe we do one two one two one when it
comes<00:03:18.380> to<00:03:18.500> the<00:03:18.590> sticking<00:03:18.950> so<00:03:19.040> that's<00:03:19.190> what

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
comes to the sticking so that's what

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:36.100 
comes to the sticking so that's what
this<00:03:19.490> is<00:03:19.940> what<00:03:20.060> that<00:03:20.209> would<00:03:20.360> sound<00:03:20.390> like

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.110 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:38.119 

which<00:03:37.110> in<00:03:37.260> and<00:03:37.349> of<00:03:37.440> itself<00:03:37.590> not<00:03:37.920> that

00:03:38.119 --> 00:03:38.129 
which in and of itself not that

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:39.440 
which in and of itself not that
interesting<00:03:38.550> on<00:03:38.640> the<00:03:38.700> snare<00:03:38.879> drum<00:03:39.090> but<00:03:39.300> now

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
interesting on the snare drum but now

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.059 
interesting on the snare drum but now
let's<00:03:39.629> take<00:03:39.870> the<00:03:40.050> hands<00:03:40.319> and<00:03:40.590> cross<00:03:40.830> them

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:41.069 
let's take the hands and cross them

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:42.559 
let's take the hands and cross them
remember<00:03:41.519> that<00:03:41.640> magical<00:03:42.030> cross<00:03:42.239> that<00:03:42.390> makes

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:42.569 
remember that magical cross that makes

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:44.270 
remember that magical cross that makes
people<00:03:42.690> go<00:03:42.870> nuts<00:03:43.170> we're<00:03:43.860> going<00:03:43.980> to<00:03:44.040> cross

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
people go nuts we're going to cross

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.550 
people go nuts we're going to cross
these<00:03:44.640> and<00:03:45.000> then<00:03:45.810> we're<00:03:46.170> going<00:03:46.260> to<00:03:46.349> play<00:03:46.530> this

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
these and then we're going to play this

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.440 
these and then we're going to play this
pattern<00:03:47.069> so<00:03:47.220> every<00:03:47.549> time<00:03:47.580> we<00:03:47.910> play<00:03:48.090> the<00:03:48.269> one

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
pattern so every time we play the one

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:49.970 
pattern so every time we play the one
pattern<00:03:48.720> our<00:03:48.989> hands<00:03:49.170> will<00:03:49.319> be<00:03:49.440> here<00:03:49.709> then<00:03:49.860> when

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
pattern our hands will be here then when

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.740 
pattern our hands will be here then when
we<00:03:50.099> go<00:03:50.220> to<00:03:50.250> to<00:03:50.489> pattern<00:03:50.879> we're<00:03:51.360> going<00:03:51.480> to<00:03:51.540> cross

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
we go to to pattern we're going to cross

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.020 
we go to to pattern we're going to cross
back<00:03:52.140> to<00:03:52.349> one<00:03:52.500> pattern<00:03:52.769> will<00:03:53.280> cross<00:03:53.580> back<00:03:53.910> to

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
back to one pattern will cross back to

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.030 
back to one pattern will cross back to
the<00:03:54.120> two<00:03:54.269> pattern<00:03:54.629> cross<00:03:54.959> back<00:03:55.620> to<00:03:55.769> the<00:03:55.890> one

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
the two pattern cross back to the one

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.800 
the two pattern cross back to the one
pattern<00:03:56.310> then<00:03:56.880> we're<00:03:57.000> out<00:03:57.120> of<00:03:57.150> bar<00:03:57.420> one<00:03:57.630> if

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
pattern then we're out of bar one if

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.059 
pattern then we're out of bar one if
we're<00:03:58.019> in<00:03:58.079> bar<00:03:58.260> two<00:03:58.440> and<00:03:58.560> we<00:03:58.620> go<00:03:58.739> back<00:03:58.769> to<00:03:58.920> the

00:03:59.059 --> 00:03:59.069 
we're in bar two and we go back to the

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:00.620 
we're in bar two and we go back to the
one<00:03:59.190> pattern<00:03:59.430> we<00:03:59.700> cross<00:03:59.970> again<00:04:00.299> right<00:04:00.480> so

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
one pattern we cross again right so

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:01.819 
one pattern we cross again right so
every<00:04:00.810> time<00:04:00.840> you<00:04:01.049> start<00:04:01.290> a<00:04:01.410> one<00:04:01.620> or<00:04:01.739> a<00:04:01.799> two

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:01.829 
every time you start a one or a two

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:03.620 
every time you start a one or a two
you're<00:04:02.220> crossing<00:04:02.640> your<00:04:02.670> hands<00:04:03.090> so<00:04:03.599> that

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
you're crossing your hands so that

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:07.370 
you're crossing your hands so that
pattern<00:04:04.200> one<00:04:04.590> two<00:04:04.860> one<00:04:05.160> two<00:04:05.220> one<00:04:05.459> in<00:04:06.090> 1<00:04:06.599> mar<00:04:06.870> we

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
pattern one two one two one in 1 mar we

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:49.260 
pattern one two one two one in 1 mar we
look<00:04:07.590> like<00:04:07.620> this

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:51.790 

two<00:04:50.270> simple<00:04:50.660> stickings<00:04:51.080> put<00:04:51.290> together<00:04:51.620> to

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:51.800 
two simple stickings put together to

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.440 
two simple stickings put together to
sound<00:04:52.130> a<00:04:52.310> little<00:04:52.490> bit<00:04:52.700> more<00:04:52.850> complicated<00:04:53.120> than

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:53.450 
sound a little bit more complicated than

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:54.940 
sound a little bit more complicated than
when<00:04:53.600> they<00:04:53.990> are<00:04:54.080> now<00:04:54.230> I<00:04:54.260> don't<00:04:54.440> want<00:04:54.680> to<00:04:54.740> stop

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:54.950 
when they are now I don't want to stop

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:56.260 
when they are now I don't want to stop
there<00:04:55.130> I<00:04:55.160> want<00:04:55.310> to<00:04:55.400> give<00:04:55.520> you<00:04:55.550> more<00:04:55.760> let's<00:04:56.120> do

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.270 
there I want to give you more let's do

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.330 
there I want to give you more let's do
more<00:04:56.480> right<00:04:56.720> let's<00:04:57.470> take<00:04:57.680> those<00:04:57.830> stickings

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340 
more right let's take those stickings

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:59.320 
more right let's take those stickings
and<00:04:58.490> break<00:04:58.640> them<00:04:58.790> out<00:04:58.850> a<00:04:58.910> little<00:04:59.000> bit<00:04:59.150> further

00:04:59.320 --> 00:04:59.330 
and break them out a little bit further

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:00.670 
and break them out a little bit further
this<00:04:59.510> is<00:04:59.630> what<00:04:59.780> i<00:04:59.810> love<00:05:00.050> doing<00:05:00.080> with<00:05:00.350> linear

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:00.680 
this is what i love doing with linear

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.320 
this is what i love doing with linear
patterns<00:05:01.040> especially<00:05:01.220> in<00:05:01.520> the<00:05:01.640> lessons<00:05:02.300> that

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:02.330 
patterns especially in the lessons that

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.180 
patterns especially in the lessons that
we<00:05:02.510> do<00:05:02.630> is<00:05:02.750> I<00:05:02.840> teach<00:05:03.020> you<00:05:03.200> how<00:05:03.650> to<00:05:03.710> break<00:05:04.160> a

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:04.190 
we do is I teach you how to break a

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:06.040 
we do is I teach you how to break a
linear<00:05:04.610> pattern<00:05:05.000> out<00:05:05.120> and<00:05:05.360> use<00:05:05.690> it<00:05:05.870> not<00:05:05.990> just

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.050 
linear pattern out and use it not just

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:07.930 
linear pattern out and use it not just
use<00:05:06.530> it<00:05:06.680> in<00:05:06.770> the<00:05:06.860> way<00:05:06.980> that<00:05:07.010> it's<00:05:07.250> written<00:05:07.490> but

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:07.940 
use it in the way that it's written but

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:09.700 
use it in the way that it's written but
take<00:05:08.120> those<00:05:08.300> simple<00:05:08.690> pieces<00:05:08.930> or<00:05:09.200> words<00:05:09.470> and

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:09.710 
take those simple pieces or words and

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:12.040 
take those simple pieces or words and
arrange<00:05:09.980> them<00:05:10.070> into<00:05:10.430> different<00:05:11.060> phrases<00:05:11.870> all

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.050 
arrange them into different phrases all

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:13.300 
arrange them into different phrases all
right<00:05:12.200> so<00:05:12.350> let's<00:05:12.440> take<00:05:12.650> that<00:05:12.890> number<00:05:13.040> one

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:13.310 
right so let's take that number one

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:14.680 
right so let's take that number one
sticking<00:05:13.580> number<00:05:13.880> two<00:05:14.060> sticking<00:05:14.420> we<00:05:14.540> know

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:14.690 
sticking number two sticking we know

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:15.910 
sticking number two sticking we know
that<00:05:14.810> we<00:05:14.900> need<00:05:14.990> to<00:05:15.080> play<00:05:15.230> three<00:05:15.470> number<00:05:15.710> ones

and now you have different combinations

00:06:34.929 --> 00:06:36.869 
and now you have different combinations
it's<00:06:35.049> not<00:06:35.229> just<00:06:35.439> but<00:06:35.679> it's<00:06:36.279> not<00:06:36.369> just<00:06:36.459> the<00:06:36.669> same

thing<00:06:37.059> over<00:06:37.149> and<00:06:37.299> over<00:06:37.389> now<00:06:37.719> you're<00:06:37.899> doing

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:38.110 
thing over and over now you're doing

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:39.479 
thing over and over now you're doing
different<00:06:38.409> combinations<00:06:38.949> that<00:06:39.009> makes<00:06:39.339> it

00:06:39.479 --> 00:06:39.489 
different combinations that makes it

00:06:39.489 --> 00:06:41.729 
different combinations that makes it
look<00:06:39.699> like<00:06:39.729> at<00:06:40.119> irregular<00:06:40.899> intervals<00:06:41.019> you're

00:06:41.729 --> 00:06:41.739 
look like at irregular intervals you're

00:06:41.739 --> 00:06:43.350 
look like at irregular intervals you're
crossing<00:06:42.189> your<00:06:42.219> arms<00:06:42.339> which<00:06:42.789> makes<00:06:43.029> it<00:06:43.149> look

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:43.360 
crossing your arms which makes it look

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:44.789 
crossing your arms which makes it look
more<00:06:43.569> complicated<00:06:44.019> it<00:06:44.169> is<00:06:44.259> but<00:06:44.469> you<00:06:44.499> and<00:06:44.739> I

00:06:44.789 --> 00:06:44.799 
more complicated it is but you and I

00:06:44.799 --> 00:06:46.859 
more complicated it is but you and I
both<00:06:44.829> know<00:06:45.039> what<00:06:45.429> it's<00:06:46.089> just<00:06:46.299> two<00:06:46.419> stickings

00:06:46.859 --> 00:06:46.869 
both know what it's just two stickings

00:06:46.869 --> 00:06:48.629 
both know what it's just two stickings
it's<00:06:47.229> very<00:06:47.529> simple<00:06:47.799> it's<00:06:47.889> just<00:06:48.069> two<00:06:48.219> stickings

00:06:48.629 --> 00:06:48.639 
it's very simple it's just two stickings

00:06:48.639 --> 00:06:50.249 
it's very simple it's just two stickings
alright<00:06:48.939> so<00:06:49.360> if<00:06:49.479> we<00:06:49.569> were<00:06:49.659> take<00:06:49.869> them<00:06:50.049> and<00:06:50.139> kind

00:06:50.249 --> 00:06:50.259 
alright so if we were take them and kind

00:06:50.259 --> 00:06:51.869 
alright so if we were take them and kind
of<00:06:50.379> mix<00:06:50.559> them<00:06:50.739> up<00:06:50.889> it<00:06:51.129> gets<00:06:51.399> to<00:06:51.489> sounding<00:06:51.789> like

00:06:51.869 --> 00:06:51.879 
of mix them up it gets to sounding like

00:06:51.879 --> 00:07:10.620 
of mix them up it gets to sounding like
this

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:10.630 

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:12.520 

that's<00:07:11.630> what<00:07:11.780> I<00:07:11.810> love<00:07:12.050> about<00:07:12.080> drumming

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:12.530 
that's what I love about drumming

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:14.350 
that's what I love about drumming
something<00:07:12.860> so<00:07:13.010> simple<00:07:13.310> can<00:07:13.610> be<00:07:13.880> taken<00:07:14.240> to

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:14.360 
something so simple can be taken to

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:16.000 
something so simple can be taken to
another<00:07:14.540> level<00:07:14.660> and<00:07:15.020> look<00:07:15.350> more<00:07:15.500> complicated

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:16.010 
another level and look more complicated

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:17.230 
another level and look more complicated
and<00:07:16.160> sound<00:07:16.400> more<00:07:16.550> complicated<00:07:17.030> than<00:07:17.180> it

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:17.240 
and sound more complicated than it

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:18.490 
and sound more complicated than it
really<00:07:17.360> is<00:07:17.540> it's<00:07:17.750> really<00:07:17.960> just<00:07:18.080> two<00:07:18.260> very

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:18.500 
really is it's really just two very

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:20.620 
really is it's really just two very
simple<00:07:18.800> stickings<00:07:19.250> that<00:07:19.700> was<00:07:19.790> more<00:07:19.970> like<00:07:20.090> half

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:20.630 
simple stickings that was more like half

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:23.280 
simple stickings that was more like half
five<00:07:20.960> it's<00:07:21.440> more<00:07:21.620> like<00:07:21.770> two<00:07:21.980> simple<00:07:22.580> stickings

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:23.290 
five it's more like two simple stickings

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:25.420 
five it's more like two simple stickings
combined<00:07:24.290> together<00:07:24.410> in<00:07:24.650> different<00:07:24.770> forms<00:07:25.280> so

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:25.430 
combined together in different forms so

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:27.160 
combined together in different forms so
don't<00:07:25.700> forget<00:07:25.820> April<00:07:26.330> second<00:07:26.660> Ronnie<00:07:26.840> Ted<00:07:27.080> is

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:27.170 
don't forget April second Ronnie Ted is
