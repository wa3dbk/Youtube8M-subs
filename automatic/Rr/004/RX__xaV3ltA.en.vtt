00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:25.960 
to be very cheap compared to its

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.230 
to be very cheap compared to its
predecessors<00:02:26.710> these<00:02:27.430> features<00:02:27.850> make<00:02:27.880> it

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240 
predecessors these features make it

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.420 
predecessors these features make it
worth<00:02:28.420> waiting<00:02:28.900> for<00:02:28.930> watch<00:02:29.800> out<00:02:30.130> for<00:02:30.370> the

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
worth waiting for watch out for the

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.850 
worth waiting for watch out for the
iphone<00:02:30.790> 5<00:02:31.060> nano<00:02:31.480> which<00:02:31.990> is<00:02:32.170> expected<00:02:32.680> to<00:02:32.770> be

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
iphone 5 nano which is expected to be

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.970 
iphone 5 nano which is expected to be
released<00:02:32.890> in<00:02:33.430> june<00:02:33.730> so<00:02:34.180> basically<00:02:35.110> this<00:02:35.590> will

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
released in june so basically this will

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.070 
released in june so basically this will
actually<00:02:36.310> definitely<00:02:37.270> revolutionize

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
actually definitely revolutionize

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.250 
actually definitely revolutionize
thing's<00:02:38.530> for<00:02:38.800> sure<00:02:39.120> so<00:02:40.120> what<00:02:40.510> my<00:02:40.690> thoughts<00:02:41.020> on

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
thing's for sure so what my thoughts on

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.840 
thing's for sure so what my thoughts on
it<00:02:41.290> are<00:02:41.530> is<00:02:41.680> that<00:02:41.710> it's<00:02:41.980> going<00:02:42.130> to<00:02:42.190> be<00:02:42.310> cheaper

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
it are is that it's going to be cheaper

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.420 
it are is that it's going to be cheaper
because<00:02:43.390> it's<00:02:43.900> going<00:02:44.080> to<00:02:44.260> be<00:02:44.380> smaller<00:02:44.440> it<00:02:45.160> most

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
because it's going to be smaller it most

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.700 
because it's going to be smaller it most
likely<00:02:45.520> will<00:02:46.060> not<00:02:46.120> feature<00:02:46.570> a<00:02:46.780> Retina<00:02:47.290> display

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:47.710 
likely will not feature a Retina display

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:49.860 
likely will not feature a Retina display
but<00:02:48.040> at<00:02:48.160> that<00:02:48.190> size<00:02:48.670> anyway<00:02:49.300> everything's

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
but at that size anyway everything's

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.680 
but at that size anyway everything's
probably<00:02:50.140> going<00:02:50.770> to<00:02:50.890> look<00:02:51.070> good<00:02:51.310> because<00:02:51.690> in

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
probably going to look good because in

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.050 
probably going to look good because in
my<00:02:52.900> other<00:02:53.170> article<00:02:53.800> I<00:02:53.950> actually<00:02:54.160> said<00:02:54.640> that<00:02:54.910> it

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
my other article I actually said that it

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.540 
my other article I actually said that it
is<00:02:55.240> rumored<00:02:55.690> to<00:02:55.720> be<00:02:55.960> one-third<00:02:56.860> the<00:02:56.890> size<00:02:57.280> of

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550 
is rumored to be one-third the size of

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.750 
is rumored to be one-third the size of
the<00:02:57.670> original<00:02:57.940> iphone<00:02:58.720> 4<00:02:59.140> and<00:02:59.350> I<00:03:00.250> said<00:03:00.580> it<00:03:00.670> was

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
the original iphone 4 and I said it was

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.430 
the original iphone 4 and I said it was
going<00:03:00.910> to<00:03:01.060> be<00:03:01.180> modeled<00:03:01.540> after<00:03:01.690> the<00:03:01.840> iphone<00:03:02.230> 4

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
going to be modeled after the iphone 4

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.740 
going to be modeled after the iphone 4
however<00:03:02.830> it<00:03:03.130> may<00:03:03.370> have<00:03:03.640> an<00:03:03.820> entirely<00:03:04.270> new<00:03:04.540> form

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
however it may have an entirely new form

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.280 
however it may have an entirely new form
factor<00:03:05.680> with<00:03:06.640> these<00:03:06.970> new<00:03:07.480> bits<00:03:07.870> of<00:03:08.050> news<00:03:08.230> that

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
factor with these new bits of news that

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.220 
factor with these new bits of news that
have<00:03:08.620> been<00:03:08.770> released<00:03:08.980> about<00:03:09.370> it<00:03:09.730> and<00:03:09.910> also<00:03:10.750> I

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
have been released about it and also I

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:12.690 
have been released about it and also I
don't<00:03:11.530> know<00:03:11.770> if<00:03:11.950> it's<00:03:12.070> going<00:03:12.190> to<00:03:12.280> have<00:03:12.430> face

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
don't know if it's going to have face

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.370 
don't know if it's going to have face
recognition<00:03:12.970> software<00:03:13.390> I<00:03:13.780> think<00:03:14.140> that<00:03:14.290> would

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
recognition software I think that would

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.650 
recognition software I think that would
be<00:03:14.440> absolutely<00:03:14.950> amazing<00:03:15.760> like<00:03:16.420> for<00:03:16.630> instance

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
be absolutely amazing like for instance

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.960 
be absolutely amazing like for instance
you<00:03:17.260> slide<00:03:17.620> to<00:03:17.830> unlock<00:03:17.860> and<00:03:18.489> then<00:03:18.610> it<00:03:18.760> actually

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
you slide to unlock and then it actually

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.150 
you slide to unlock and then it actually
scans<00:03:19.600> your<00:03:19.840> face<00:03:20.140> or<00:03:20.350> it<00:03:20.440> looks<00:03:20.650> at<00:03:20.800> your<00:03:20.920> face

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
scans your face or it looks at your face

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.670 
scans your face or it looks at your face
similar<00:03:21.550> to<00:03:21.700> what<00:03:22.090> the<00:03:22.239> Kinect<00:03:22.630> does<00:03:22.959> when<00:03:23.530> it

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
similar to what the Kinect does when it

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.949 
similar to what the Kinect does when it
automatically<00:03:24.250> selects<00:03:24.760> your<00:03:25.030> new<00:03:25.360> avatar

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
automatically selects your new avatar

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:28.020 
automatically selects your new avatar
when<00:03:26.170> you<00:03:26.260> step<00:03:26.620> in<00:03:26.860> it<00:03:27.040> would<00:03:27.700> have<00:03:27.850> to<00:03:28.000> be

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
when you step in it would have to be

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.540 
when you step in it would have to be
something<00:03:28.420> similar<00:03:28.930> to<00:03:28.959> that<00:03:29.170> so<00:03:30.100> I<00:03:30.459> think

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:30.550 
something similar to that so I think

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:32.550 
something similar to that so I think
that<00:03:30.760> would<00:03:30.970> actually<00:03:31.000> be<00:03:31.660> really<00:03:31.690> amazing

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
that would actually be really amazing

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.070 
that would actually be really amazing
and<00:03:32.950> I<00:03:33.459> know<00:03:33.520> someone<00:03:33.940> who<00:03:34.090> got<00:03:34.510> their<00:03:34.660> iphone

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.080 
and I know someone who got their iphone

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.229 
and I know someone who got their iphone
stolen<00:03:35.709> and<00:03:35.920> that<00:03:36.700> would<00:03:36.850> have<00:03:37.000> actually

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
stolen and that would have actually

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:38.760 
stolen and that would have actually
really<00:03:37.750> helped<00:03:38.080> because<00:03:38.170> if<00:03:38.500> they<00:03:38.620> actually

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:38.770 
really helped because if they actually

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:40.680 
really helped because if they actually
implement<00:03:39.400> this<00:03:39.520> right<00:03:39.820> then<00:03:40.209> the<00:03:40.420> theft

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
implement this right then the theft

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.479 
implement this right then the theft
won't<00:03:41.020> even<00:03:41.200> be<00:03:41.380> able<00:03:41.470> to<00:03:41.620> restore<00:03:42.130> the<00:03:42.340> iphone

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:42.489 
won't even be able to restore the iphone

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:44.520 
won't even be able to restore the iphone
they'll<00:03:42.940> just<00:03:43.120> be<00:03:43.300> stuck<00:03:43.720> with<00:03:43.959> it<00:03:43.989> the<00:03:44.230> way<00:03:44.380> it

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
they'll just be stuck with it the way it

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.650 
they'll just be stuck with it the way it
is<00:03:44.560> and<00:03:44.980> they'll<00:03:45.640> never<00:03:45.820> be<00:03:46.060> able<00:03:46.150> to<00:03:46.300> get<00:03:46.510> it

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
is and they'll never be able to get it

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.810 
is and they'll never be able to get it
unlocked<00:03:47.110> or<00:03:47.380> anything<00:03:47.830> like<00:03:47.860> that<00:03:48.100> so

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:48.820 
unlocked or anything like that so

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.340 
unlocked or anything like that so
hopefully<00:03:49.269> Apple<00:03:49.600> does<00:03:49.720> a<00:03:49.750> really<00:03:50.080> good<00:03:50.290> job

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:50.350 
hopefully Apple does a really good job

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:52.710 
hopefully Apple does a really good job
of<00:03:50.590> implementing<00:03:51.250> that<00:03:51.519> and<00:03:51.880> they<00:03:52.360> make<00:03:52.540> it

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
of implementing that and they make it

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.240 
of implementing that and they make it
super<00:03:53.050> secure<00:03:53.910> but<00:03:54.910> I<00:03:55.980> don't<00:03:56.980> know<00:03:57.070> if<00:03:57.130> this

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
super secure but I don't know if this

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.160 
super secure but I don't know if this
actually<00:03:57.519> will<00:03:58.000> be<00:03:58.180> released<00:03:58.570> or<00:03:58.750> not<00:03:58.900> but<00:03:59.140> I

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
actually will be released or not but I

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.199 
actually will be released or not but I
think<00:03:59.560> it<00:03:59.680> would<00:03:59.830> be<00:03:59.950> super<00:04:00.340> awesome<00:04:00.640> if<00:04:01.090> it

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 
think it would be super awesome if it

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:03.180 
think it would be super awesome if it
was<00:04:01.360> released<00:04:01.720> I<00:04:01.900> would<00:04:02.410> actually<00:04:02.560> get<00:04:03.010> the

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
was released I would actually get the

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.820 
was released I would actually get the
iphone<00:04:03.400> 5<00:04:03.880> and<00:04:03.910> the<00:04:04.330> iphone<00:04:04.720> 5<00:04:04.959> nano<00:04:05.320> just<00:04:05.709> for

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:05.830 
iphone 5 and the iphone 5 nano just for

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:07.770 
iphone 5 and the iphone 5 nano just for
the<00:04:05.920> heck<00:04:06.100> of<00:04:06.130> it<00:04:06.340> and<00:04:06.519> just<00:04:07.180> because<00:04:07.540> it<00:04:07.660> would

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
the heck of it and just because it would

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.840 
the heck of it and just because it would
also<00:04:07.930> be<00:04:08.170> really<00:04:08.560> nice<00:04:08.860> to<00:04:08.890> take<00:04:09.280> on<00:04:09.459> a<00:04:09.489> trip

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:09.850 
also be really nice to take on a trip

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:11.880 
also be really nice to take on a trip
somewhere<00:04:10.330> or<00:04:10.570> to<00:04:11.260> actually<00:04:11.709> take

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
somewhere or to actually take

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.250 
somewhere or to actually take
snowboarding<00:04:12.550> or<00:04:13.000> on<00:04:13.420> my<00:04:13.600> longboard<00:04:14.080> or

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
snowboarding or on my longboard or

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.860 
snowboarding or on my longboard or
something<00:04:14.620> like<00:04:14.709> that<00:04:14.769> because<00:04:15.459> as<00:04:16.209> i<00:04:16.390> said<00:04:16.419> it

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:16.870 
something like that because as i said it

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.530 
something like that because as i said it
probably<00:04:17.320> will<00:04:17.919> have<00:04:18.250> a<00:04:18.310> shatter<00:04:18.880> resistant

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:19.540 
probably will have a shatter resistant

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:21.210 
probably will have a shatter resistant
and<00:04:19.660> scratch<00:04:20.019> resistant<00:04:20.620> screen<00:04:20.919> which<00:04:21.070> would

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:21.220 
and scratch resistant screen which would

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.440 
and scratch resistant screen which would
be<00:04:21.340> really<00:04:21.580> nice<00:04:21.850> if<00:04:21.910> you<00:04:22.240> dropped<00:04:22.570> it

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:23.450
