00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:34.000
 shake 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:30.590
 yes i think the two are different 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:36.899
 have seen halves in the first half 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:41.899
 a very good beam and the second half and 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:41.899
 much less lime and much better to turn 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.549
 we need some men are really 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.429
 scratch behind the ears 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.170
 if busy because if you are the second 

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:53.479
 have achieved half that is possible 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.520
 Just no 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:02:01.619
 in retrospect we are of course lucky 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:02.630
 is that we are in the extra time nor the 1st 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:08.429
 to make 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:13.319
 and yes seen the whole match in terms of 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:17.580
 odds and evil game that it's okay too 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:18.870
 is that rash voice called body 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.840
 biomass 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:24.180
 that flatter miss you europe it 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:30.620
 therefore suddenly has sat there and 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:34.829
 put that larger baukje p set r oh yes and 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:36.739
 i have my caps there gary is delicate 

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:40.100
 did i wash room with only my 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:40.100
 student roma show 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.720
 i walk now if i live you is my name 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.900
 is that the bottom and amos is the front 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.900
 to blend 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:03:05.200
 I also like the old man once 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:06.370
 it seemed in the second half so that it 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.730
 was that beam 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:12.870
 lost more and more time and therefore 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.870
 got chances 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:18.490
 well because we are no longer from the 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:20.920
 organization we played 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:22.360
 foot lost the ball too quickly and that has 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.890
 of course with the quality of 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.360
 impetus 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.040
 it's not just about it 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.150
 fact that we are not so good at the 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.310
 santen competition 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:34.600
 it very much to do with the better 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:35.860
 game of az and ghana with that palace 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:38.620
 as 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:42.900
 npb your windows will not have that parabolica 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.900

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:02.640
 and you believe that pole 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:05.470
 has denied himself today 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:09.600
 so much logical 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.600
 so by not using these opportunities 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:18.590
 but I'd like to say to the 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:20.990
 Dutch journalists 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:22.520
 I never mentioned a name, I believe 

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:25.540
 yesterday and as a starter 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:27.950
 written that I mentioned in name 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:30.980
 the same statement is made hey 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:32.930

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:34.850
 mussel graphic what he really and sepa a 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:37.160
 ticket and school ion 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:38.870
 raft I am avoided between is what things 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.180
 to normal sika pawn 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:43.670
 cool I mean you broke times 10 is with 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:45.560
 take your misery to sweetheart that pack inside 

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:49.270
 to huge jump in the truth 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.270
 stay as a pop straight to rigje 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:02.360
 who recognize and put khalid there is that is 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:03.620
 There are so many more spaces around you 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.180
 use 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:06.620
 semolina'll just choose something 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:10.250
 to those we who we the first half 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:12.050
 also very difficult we didn't have 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:14.330
 so much space and the second half 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:16.370
 we did that much too much than just finished 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:18.350
 then this is to force me to stop that 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:20.150
 is so that these rattle 

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:22.160
 And I mean to say that there is 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:25.400
 some players are behind the ears 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:27.470
 have to scratch because that's not it 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:29.210
 level that I like 

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:35.480
 who has okapi bertus maas prep and 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:37.750
 escape to get a big bath so free 

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:37.750
 quiet
