00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:08.590 
tuned a semitone lower than that so I'm

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:11.999

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:30.850 
you've got to do a part bar with your

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:45.130 
you've got to do a part bar with your
first<00:00:31.120> finger<00:00:31.510> I'll<00:00:31.990> show<00:00:32.680> you<00:00:32.740> in<00:00:32.920> closer

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:01:01.000 

I'll<00:00:46.140> show<00:00:46.410> you<00:00:46.470> that<00:00:46.560> again<00:00:46.680> slowly

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.460 

as<00:01:02.010> you<00:01:02.280> can<00:01:02.460> see<00:01:02.790> the<00:01:03.030> first<00:01:03.300> finger<00:01:03.720> here<00:01:03.930> is

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
as you can see the first finger here is

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.340 
as you can see the first finger here is
tucked<00:01:05.040> behind<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.640> second<00:01:06.120> finger<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:06.780> is

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
tucked behind the second finger and is

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.910 
tucked behind the second finger and is
covering<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:08.490> sixth<00:01:09.360> 5th<00:01:09.750> and<00:01:10.050> 4th<00:01:10.470> strings

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
covering the sixth 5th and 4th strings

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.790 
covering the sixth 5th and 4th strings
it's<00:01:11.790> a<00:01:11.970> bit<00:01:12.150> of<00:01:12.270> a<00:01:12.360> stretch<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:13.260> I<00:01:13.380> must<00:01:13.650> admit

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:13.800 
it's a bit of a stretch and I must admit

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.070 
it's a bit of a stretch and I must admit
the<00:01:14.159> first<00:01:14.400> time<00:01:14.759> I<00:01:14.940> tried<00:01:15.270> it<00:01:15.300> I<00:01:15.540> couldn't<00:01:15.869> do

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
the first time I tried it I couldn't do

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.520 
the first time I tried it I couldn't do
it<00:01:16.229> I<00:01:16.380> had<00:01:16.590> to<00:01:16.650> practice<00:01:17.220> it<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:17.610> I'm

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
it I had to practice it and I'm

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.230 
it I had to practice it and I'm
expecting<00:01:19.530> you<00:01:19.560> will<00:01:19.890> have<00:01:20.070> to<00:01:20.280> as<00:01:20.460> well<00:01:20.670> it's

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
expecting you will have to as well it's

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.600 
expecting you will have to as well it's
not<00:01:21.570> difficult<00:01:21.840> it<00:01:22.380> just<00:01:22.680> calls<00:01:22.950> for<00:01:23.280> a<00:01:23.310> lot<00:01:23.490> of

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
not difficult it just calls for a lot of

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.210 
not difficult it just calls for a lot of
flexibility<00:01:24.360> in<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.780> first<00:01:25.020> finger<00:01:25.590> so

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
flexibility in the first finger so

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.609 
flexibility in the first finger so
persevere<00:01:27.000> and<00:01:27.240> please<00:01:27.840> don't<00:01:28.140> put<00:01:28.290> yourself

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
persevere and please don't put yourself

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.790 
persevere and please don't put yourself
in<00:01:28.710> casualty<00:01:29.310> on<00:01:29.430> my<00:01:29.610> account<00:01:30.350> the<00:01:31.350> next<00:01:31.530> thing

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:31.800 
in casualty on my account the next thing

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.469 
in casualty on my account the next thing
you<00:01:31.920> might<00:01:31.950> find<00:01:32.399> a<00:01:32.580> little<00:01:32.610> bit<00:01:32.940> problematic

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
you might find a little bit problematic

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.680 
you might find a little bit problematic
is<00:01:33.869> it<00:01:34.320> crops<00:01:34.560> up<00:01:34.710> in<00:01:34.800> bar<00:01:35.039> 5<00:01:35.490> it's<00:01:36.270> not

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:36.690 
is it crops up in bar 5 it's not

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:38.779 
is it crops up in bar 5 it's not
particularly<00:01:37.289> difficult<00:01:37.440> it's<00:01:38.190> just<00:01:38.430> a<00:01:38.550> long

00:01:38.779 --> 00:01:38.789 
particularly difficult it's just a long

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:48.819 
particularly difficult it's just a long
stretch<00:01:39.270> for<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.660> left<00:01:39.869> hand<00:01:40.020> I'll<00:01:40.500> show<00:01:41.070> you

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:48.829 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:02:00.090 

and<00:01:49.829> once<00:01:50.189> again<00:01:50.399> slowly

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.800 

now<00:02:01.100> as<00:02:01.250> you<00:02:01.399> can<00:02:01.520> see<00:02:01.579> the<00:02:02.000> gap<00:02:02.240> between<00:02:02.479> the

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
now as you can see the gap between the

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.950 
now as you can see the gap between the
first<00:02:02.840> of<00:02:03.289> the<00:02:03.380> fourth<00:02:03.649> fingers<00:02:04.189> is<00:02:04.609> quite<00:02:05.539> big

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
first of the fourth fingers is quite big

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.809 
first of the fourth fingers is quite big
it's<00:02:06.320> not<00:02:06.530> the<00:02:06.679> biggest<00:02:07.070> stretch<00:02:07.369> you're<00:02:07.640> ever

00:02:07.809 --> 00:02:07.819 
it's not the biggest stretch you're ever

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:09.550 
it's not the biggest stretch you're ever
going<00:02:08.090> to<00:02:08.179> come<00:02:08.390> up<00:02:08.539> against<00:02:08.959> on<00:02:09.110> the<00:02:09.140> guitar

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
going to come up against on the guitar

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.800 
going to come up against on the guitar
but<00:02:09.830> it's<00:02:10.099> quite<00:02:10.700> big<00:02:10.940> if<00:02:11.120> you're<00:02:11.269> not<00:02:11.420> used<00:02:11.660> to

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
but it's quite big if you're not used to

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.949 
but it's quite big if you're not used to
this<00:02:11.959> kind<00:02:12.290> of<00:02:12.379> fret<00:02:13.280> work<00:02:13.550> and<00:02:13.940> you<00:02:14.750> might

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
this kind of fret work and you might

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:16.660 
this kind of fret work and you might
find<00:02:15.290> that<00:02:15.470> if<00:02:15.650> you're<00:02:15.799> not<00:02:15.830> used<00:02:16.220> to<00:02:16.430> it<00:02:16.519> the

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
find that if you're not used to it the

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.430 
find that if you're not used to it the
pressure<00:02:16.940> on<00:02:17.209> the<00:02:17.390> fourth<00:02:17.720> finger<00:02:18.290> is<00:02:18.319> a

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
pressure on the fourth finger is a

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.280 
pressure on the fourth finger is a
little<00:02:18.920> bit<00:02:19.099> difficult<00:02:19.370> to<00:02:19.730> maintain<00:02:20.290> enough

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
little bit difficult to maintain enough

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.960 
little bit difficult to maintain enough
to<00:02:21.500> give<00:02:21.709> you<00:02:21.890> a<00:02:21.920> nice<00:02:22.459> clean<00:02:22.489> note<00:02:24.970> but

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
to give you a nice clean note but

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.250 
to give you a nice clean note but
there's<00:02:26.269> nothing<00:02:26.629> here<00:02:26.810> that<00:02:26.989> a<00:02:27.019> bit<00:02:27.170> of

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
there's nothing here that a bit of

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.550 
there's nothing here that a bit of
practice<00:02:27.680> mine<00:02:27.920> sort<00:02:28.250> out<00:02:29.080> the<00:02:30.080> next<00:02:30.379> one<00:02:30.530> I

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
want to talk about is in bar 12 this is

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.220 
want to talk about is in bar 12 this is
after<00:02:34.250> you've<00:02:34.400> played<00:02:34.700> the<00:02:34.970> verse<00:02:35.239> twice<00:02:35.810> it

on that chord you play right at the

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.910 
on that chord you play right at the
beginning<00:03:02.180> only<00:03:02.810> it<00:03:03.049> doesn't<00:03:03.410> involve<00:03:03.650> that

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
the part bar the first finger is

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.210
