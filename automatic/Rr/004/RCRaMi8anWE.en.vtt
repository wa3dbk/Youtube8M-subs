and<00:02:31.230> it's<00:02:31.410> getting<00:02:31.770> curly<00:02:32.220> as<00:02:32.340> I<00:02:32.490> run<00:02:32.640> my

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
and it's getting curly as I run my

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.960 
and it's getting curly as I run my
fingers<00:02:32.820> through<00:02:33.210> it<00:02:33.570> so<00:02:34.350> um<00:02:34.950> the<00:02:35.550> hair<00:02:35.760> is

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
fingers through it so um the hair is

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.140 
fingers through it so um the hair is
different<00:02:36.240> compared<00:02:36.930> to<00:02:37.580> proving<00:02:38.580> here<00:02:38.880> in

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
different compared to proving here in

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.740 
different compared to proving here in
that<00:02:39.480> it's<00:02:39.720> not<00:02:40.410> as<00:02:40.890> silky<00:02:41.880> as<00:02:42.060> a<00:02:42.090> Peruvian

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
that it's not as silky as a Peruvian

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.560 
that it's not as silky as a Peruvian
here<00:02:43.080> but<00:02:43.440> it<00:02:43.560> also<00:02:43.770> feels<00:02:44.280> close<00:02:44.730> to<00:02:45.210> the

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
here but it also feels close to the

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.720 
here but it also feels close to the
Brazilian<00:02:46.110> here<00:02:46.320> where<00:02:46.830> it's<00:02:47.010> like<00:02:47.190> a<00:02:47.340> little

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
Brazilian here where it's like a little

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:53.750 
Brazilian here where it's like a little
coarse<00:02:48.830> and<00:02:50.660> it's<00:02:51.660> not<00:02:52.200> as<00:02:52.380> light<00:02:52.650> as<00:02:52.890> proving

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
coarse and it's not as light as proving

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.510 
coarse and it's not as light as proving
here<00:02:54.150> it<00:02:54.960> kind<00:02:55.230> of<00:02:55.320> feels<00:02:55.590> like<00:02:55.800> the<00:02:55.860> person<00:02:56.400> in

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
here it kind of feels like the person in

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.940 
here it kind of feels like the person in
here<00:02:56.760> where<00:02:56.970> it<00:02:57.360> has<00:02:57.390> a<00:02:57.870> little<00:02:58.350> weight<00:02:58.590> to<00:02:58.620> it

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
here where it has a little weight to it

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:06.800 
here where it has a little weight to it
so<00:03:00.230> I<00:03:01.230> run<00:03:01.590> my<00:03:01.770> fingers<00:03:01.800> through<00:03:02.280> it<00:03:04.250> and<00:03:05.810> I

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
so I run my fingers through it and I

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.570 
so I run my fingers through it and I
have<00:03:07.260> not<00:03:07.500> pulled<00:03:07.920> out<00:03:08.160> any<00:03:08.400> strings<00:03:09.360> at<00:03:09.870> all

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580 
have not pulled out any strings at all

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.040 
have not pulled out any strings at all
but<00:03:11.580> this<00:03:11.760> is<00:03:11.940> what<00:03:12.120> it<00:03:12.239> looks<00:03:12.450> like<00:03:12.630> so<00:03:12.900> it's

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
but this is what it looks like so it's

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.830 
but this is what it looks like so it's
really<00:03:13.260> nice<00:03:13.590> you<00:03:13.620> lose<00:03:13.980> weight<00:03:14.250> and<00:03:14.690> this<00:03:15.690> is

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
really nice you lose weight and this is

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.540 
really nice you lose weight and this is
what<00:03:16.050> the<00:03:16.200> bundle<00:03:16.620> looks<00:03:16.800> like<00:03:17.130> so<00:03:17.430> the

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550 
what the bundle looks like so the

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.449 
what the bundle looks like so the
construction<00:03:18.030> is<00:03:18.739> decent<00:03:19.739> compared<00:03:20.160> to<00:03:20.310> all

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
construction is decent compared to all

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:23.870 
construction is decent compared to all
the<00:03:20.640> other<00:03:20.970> construction<00:03:22.280> that<00:03:23.280> I<00:03:23.310> have<00:03:23.550> seen

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
the other construction that I have seen

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:32.270 
the other construction that I have seen
so<00:03:24.870> nothing<00:03:25.230> is<00:03:25.440> dangling<00:03:25.890> out

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.220 

and<00:03:32.760> what<00:03:32.940> I<00:03:32.970> really<00:03:33.390> like<00:03:33.570> about<00:03:33.630> it<00:03:33.930> is<00:03:34.170> that

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
and what I really like about it is that

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.080 
and what I really like about it is that
the<00:03:34.680> sleeve<00:03:35.040> the<00:03:36.290> sleeve<00:03:37.290> doesn't<00:03:37.920> have

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
the sleeve the sleeve doesn't have

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.330 
the sleeve the sleeve doesn't have
inches<00:03:39.090> on<00:03:39.270> it<00:03:39.450> the<00:03:39.990> tag<00:03:40.350> has<00:03:40.680> the<00:03:40.800> inches<00:03:41.190> on

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
inches on it the tag has the inches on

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.040 
inches on it the tag has the inches on
it<00:03:41.490> because<00:03:41.850> usually<00:03:42.330> once<00:03:42.510> you<00:03:42.630> take<00:03:42.840> it<00:03:42.960> out

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 
it because usually once you take it out

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:45.050 
it because usually once you take it out
of<00:03:43.080> the<00:03:43.320> sleeve<00:03:43.590> you<00:03:44.070> might<00:03:44.250> forget<00:03:44.580> what<00:03:44.640> kind

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
of the sleeve you might forget what kind

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.720 
of the sleeve you might forget what kind
of<00:03:45.180> arm<00:03:45.450> inches<00:03:46.140> it<00:03:46.290> is<00:03:46.500> so<00:03:46.830> by<00:03:47.010> having<00:03:47.190> the<00:03:47.460> tag

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
of arm inches it is so by having the tag

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.610 
of arm inches it is so by having the tag
on<00:03:47.970> it<00:03:48.000> I<00:03:48.270> don't<00:03:48.600> have<00:03:48.720> to<00:03:48.870> worry<00:03:49.140> about<00:03:49.230> mixing

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
on it I don't have to worry about mixing

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.470 
on it I don't have to worry about mixing
up<00:03:49.860> the<00:03:50.040> bundles<00:03:50.490> so<00:03:51.060> this<00:03:51.390> is<00:03:51.540> a<00:03:51.570> sixteen<00:03:53.480> and

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
up the bundles so this is a sixteen and

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.650 
up the bundles so this is a sixteen and
I'm<00:03:55.200> running<00:03:55.410> my<00:03:55.620> fingers<00:03:56.040> through<00:03:56.070> it<00:03:56.459> and<00:03:56.820> it

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
I'm running my fingers through it and it

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.330 
I'm running my fingers through it and it
gets<00:03:57.810> curly<00:03:58.320> as<00:03:58.530> I<00:03:58.560> run<00:03:58.800> my<00:03:58.950> fingers<00:03:59.310> through

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
gets curly as I run my fingers through

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:06.080 
gets curly as I run my fingers through
it<00:04:00.620> and<00:04:03.590> it<00:04:04.590> doesn't<00:04:04.950> have<00:04:05.100> a<00:04:05.130> strong<00:04:05.550> smell

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
it and it doesn't have a strong smell

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.600 
it and it doesn't have a strong smell
but<00:04:06.420> it<00:04:06.510> does<00:04:06.750> have<00:04:06.989> like<00:04:07.400> like<00:04:08.400> a<00:04:08.430> hair<00:04:08.820> smell

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:10.610 
but it does have like like a hair smell

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:13.370 
but it does have like like a hair smell
nothing<00:04:11.610> strong<00:04:12.120> or<00:04:12.450> overwhelming<00:04:13.170> or

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
nothing strong or overwhelming or

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.240 
nothing strong or overwhelming or
chemically<00:04:14.600> it<00:04:15.600> smells<00:04:15.870> pretty<00:04:16.109> good<00:04:16.560> and<00:04:16.980> the

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
chemically it smells pretty good and the

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.360 
chemically it smells pretty good and the
label<00:04:17.640> is<00:04:17.760> Cambodian<00:04:18.209> around<00:04:18.810> it<00:04:19.160> so<00:04:20.160> this<00:04:20.250> is

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
label is Cambodian around it so this is

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:31.790 
label is Cambodian around it so this is
the<00:04:20.489> sixteen<00:04:27.350> and<00:04:28.350> this<00:04:28.620> is<00:04:28.830> the<00:04:29.040> 18<00:04:29.760> and<00:04:30.800> this

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
the sixteen and this is the 18 and this

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.550 
the sixteen and this is the 18 and this
is<00:04:31.860> also<00:04:32.280> what<00:04:32.880> the<00:04:33.120> US<00:04:33.600> looks<00:04:33.930> like<00:04:34.200> so<00:04:34.500> this

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
is also what the US looks like so this

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:46.190 
is also what the US looks like so this
is<00:04:35.180> 16<00:04:36.180> 18<00:04:36.870> and<00:04:41.390> 20<00:04:42.710> so<00:04:43.710> the<00:04:44.669> 18<00:04:45.270> seems<00:04:45.780> to<00:04:45.990> be

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:46.200 
is 16 18 and 20 so the 18 seems to be

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:52.310 
is 16 18 and 20 so the 18 seems to be
the<00:04:47.060> biggest<00:04:48.060> bundle<00:04:48.450> and<00:04:48.900> then<00:04:50.660> yeah<00:04:51.660> the<00:04:51.900> 18

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 
the biggest bundle and then yeah the 18

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.670 
the biggest bundle and then yeah the 18
seems<00:04:52.620> like<00:04:52.770> it's<00:04:52.950> a<00:04:53.070> little<00:04:53.250> bit<00:04:53.430> bigger<00:04:54.680> than

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 
seems like it's a little bit bigger than

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.120 
seems like it's a little bit bigger than
the<00:04:56.310> 16<00:04:57.120> but<00:04:57.990> then<00:04:58.110> the<00:04:58.260> 20<00:04:58.620> is<00:04:58.710> a<00:04:58.740> little<00:04:59.010> bit

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.130 
the 16 but then the 20 is a little bit

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:03.830 
the 16 but then the 20 is a little bit
smaller<00:05:00.290> so<00:05:01.580> this<00:05:02.580> is<00:05:02.760> what<00:05:02.940> both<00:05:03.300> Altrincham

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 
smaller so this is what both Altrincham

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.790 
smaller so this is what both Altrincham
looks<00:05:04.320> like<00:05:04.590> and<00:05:05.630> then<00:05:06.630> what<00:05:07.470> about<00:05:07.500> my

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:07.800 
looks like and then what about my

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:13.100 
looks like and then what about my
fingers<00:05:08.160> through<00:05:08.520> this<00:05:09.450> 18<00:05:10.460> and<00:05:11.750> this<00:05:12.750> feels

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.110 
fingers through this 18 and this feels

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:18.680 
fingers through this 18 and this feels
really<00:05:13.530> nice<00:05:13.890> and<00:05:14.130> saw<00:05:16.610> really<00:05:17.610> nice<00:05:18.210> loose

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:18.690 
really nice and saw really nice loose

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:27.170 
really nice and saw really nice loose
wave<00:05:18.960> and<00:05:19.320> again<00:05:20.130> no<00:05:20.580> shedding<00:05:20.850> at<00:05:21.120> all
