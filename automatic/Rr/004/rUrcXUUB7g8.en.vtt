tiles and you have regular tiles now the

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:56.940 
tiles and you have regular tiles now the
next<00:01:55.090> thing<00:01:55.209> is<00:01:55.420> that<00:01:55.450> these<00:01:56.259> tiles<00:01:56.709> are

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
next thing is that these tiles are

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.180 
next thing is that these tiles are
grouped<00:01:57.399> together<00:01:57.580> in<00:01:58.170> groups<00:01:59.170> so<00:01:59.440> what<00:02:00.099> you

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:00.190 
grouped together in groups so what you

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:01.740 
grouped together in groups so what you
see<00:02:00.340> here<00:02:00.550> is<00:02:00.610> that<00:02:00.670> I<00:02:00.849> have<00:02:00.970> one<00:02:01.330> group<00:02:01.509> here

see here is that I have one group here

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.630 
see here is that I have one group here
on<00:02:01.840> my<00:02:01.929> left<00:02:02.110> hand<00:02:02.229> side<00:02:02.470> I<00:02:02.739> have<00:02:03.220> one<00:02:03.459> group

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
on my left hand side I have one group

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.490 
on my left hand side I have one group
here<00:02:03.880> in<00:02:04.119> the<00:02:04.149> middle<00:02:04.569> and<00:02:04.780> then<00:02:05.259> I<00:02:05.289> have

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
here in the middle and then I have

was another thing you can do is

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.970 
was another thing you can do is
rearrange<00:03:01.420> tiles<00:03:01.870> within<00:03:02.290> their<00:03:02.470> own<00:03:02.650> group

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
rearrange tiles within their own group

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.740 
rearrange tiles within their own group
so<00:03:03.280> you<00:03:03.310> can<00:03:03.700> take<00:03:03.910> let's<00:03:04.390> say<00:03:04.480> there's

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
so you can take let's say there's

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.020 
so you can take let's say there's
Mozilla<00:03:05.049> Firefox<00:03:05.200> tile<00:03:05.769> and<00:03:06.190> I<00:03:06.670> want<00:03:06.850> to<00:03:06.910> move

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
Mozilla Firefox tile and I want to move

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:08.370 
Mozilla Firefox tile and I want to move
it<00:03:07.180> to<00:03:07.480> the<00:03:07.600> right<00:03:07.750> side<00:03:07.989> because<00:03:08.170> I<00:03:08.230> don't

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
it to the right side because I don't

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:09.660 
it to the right side because I don't
like<00:03:08.530> it<00:03:08.709> to<00:03:08.799> the<00:03:08.890> left<00:03:09.130> of<00:03:09.250> Google<00:03:09.549> Chrome

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
like it to the left of Google Chrome

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.550 
like it to the left of Google Chrome
just<00:03:09.970> I'm<00:03:10.600> a<00:03:10.660> little<00:03:10.690> weird<00:03:11.049> about<00:03:11.110> it<00:03:11.380> so

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
just I'm a little weird about it so

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.710 
just I'm a little weird about it so
let's<00:03:12.370> move<00:03:12.580> it<00:03:12.730> okay<00:03:13.000> that<00:03:13.269> makes<00:03:13.450> me<00:03:13.540> feel<00:03:13.690> a

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
let's move it okay that makes me feel a

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.330 
let's move it okay that makes me feel a
lot<00:03:13.930> better<00:03:14.049> so<00:03:14.680> as<00:03:14.739> you<00:03:14.830> can<00:03:14.920> see<00:03:15.069> you<00:03:15.190> can

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
lot better so as you can see you can

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:16.920 
lot better so as you can see you can
rearrange<00:03:15.580> the<00:03:15.940> tiles<00:03:16.120> within<00:03:16.600> their<00:03:16.750> own

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
rearrange the tiles within their own

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.009 
rearrange the tiles within their own
group<00:03:17.230> let's<00:03:17.560> just<00:03:17.709> take<00:03:18.160> Excel<00:03:18.910> I<00:03:19.180> don't<00:03:19.930> like

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019 
group let's just take Excel I don't like

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:22.559 
group let's just take Excel I don't like
it<00:03:20.049> next<00:03:20.380> to<00:03:20.530> word<00:03:21.190> which<00:03:21.430> is<00:03:21.549> blue<00:03:21.819> 3<00:03:22.269> and<00:03:22.420> blue

00:03:22.559 --> 00:03:22.569 
it next to word which is blue 3 and blue

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:24.660 
it next to word which is blue 3 and blue
just<00:03:22.720> don't<00:03:22.930> look<00:03:23.049> right<00:03:23.230> so<00:03:23.920> I'll<00:03:24.370> put<00:03:24.580> it

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
just don't look right so I'll put it

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.400 
just don't look right so I'll put it
down<00:03:24.700> here<00:03:24.819> now<00:03:25.239> we<00:03:25.299> have<00:03:25.420> PowerPoint<00:03:25.989> word

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
down here now we have PowerPoint word

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:28.860 
down here now we have PowerPoint word
actually<00:03:27.400> they're<00:03:27.549> still<00:03:27.700> together<00:03:27.820> that<00:03:28.720> was

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
actually they're still together that was

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:29.340 
actually they're still together that was
my<00:03:29.019> fault

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
my fault

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:32.630 
my fault
there<00:03:30.070> we<00:03:30.220> go<00:03:30.420> so<00:03:31.420> we<00:03:31.510> have<00:03:31.540> two<00:03:31.930> green<00:03:32.290> ones

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
there we go so we have two green ones

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.920 
there we go so we have two green ones
but<00:03:33.640> we<00:03:33.760> have<00:03:33.850> publisher<00:03:34.269> and<00:03:34.359> Excel<00:03:34.630> close<00:03:34.840> to

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
but we have publisher and Excel close to

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:36.000 
but we have publisher and Excel close to
each<00:03:34.989> other<00:03:35.200> and<00:03:35.320> then<00:03:35.410> we<00:03:35.470> have<00:03:35.560> a<00:03:35.620> purple<00:03:35.890> one

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:13.329 
drop it to the right of that bar now I

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:15.090

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410 
I have this big spacing in between the

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:19.229 
I have this big spacing in between the
other<00:04:17.440> group<00:04:17.739> that<00:04:17.919> it<00:04:18.010> was<00:04:18.130> just<00:04:18.340> in<00:04:18.489> so<00:04:19.120> have

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
other group that it was just in so have

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:21.900 
other group that it was just in so have
big<00:04:19.419> space<00:04:19.600> here<00:04:19.989> big<00:04:20.620> space<00:04:20.859> here<00:04:20.889> big<00:04:21.700> space

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.910 
big space here big space here big space

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.090 
big space here big space here big space
here<00:04:22.180> so<00:04:22.330> now<00:04:22.900> you<00:04:22.960> can<00:04:23.139> see<00:04:23.320> that<00:04:23.500> I<00:04:23.560> have<00:04:23.830> one

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:24.100 
here so now you can see that I have one

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:25.710 
here so now you can see that I have one
two<00:04:24.310> three<00:04:24.340> four<00:04:24.669> groups<00:04:25.120> across<00:04:25.330> my<00:04:25.570> screen

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
two three four groups across my screen

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.960 
two three four groups across my screen
and<00:04:26.560> let's<00:04:26.919> just<00:04:27.039> put<00:04:27.250> PowerPoint<00:04:27.669> over<00:04:27.850> there

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
and let's just put PowerPoint over there
