represent the surface world in the
nether<00:00:33.030> and<00:00:33.239> I'm<00:00:33.719> guessing<00:00:33.899> level<00:00:34.320> 2<00:00:34.500> is<00:00:34.680> now

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829

pit<00:01:27.659> as<00:01:27.780> I<00:01:27.900> saw<00:01:28.049> in<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.259> distance<00:01:28.790> that

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
pit as I saw in the distance that

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.840 
pit as I saw in the distance that
there's<00:01:30.090> some<00:01:30.329> more<00:01:30.570> diamonds<00:01:30.930> generation

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
there's some more diamonds generation

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.609 
there's some more diamonds generation

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
so awful and hits so awesome at the same

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.080 
so awful and hits so awesome at the same
time<00:01:36.840> I<00:01:37.140> mean<00:01:37.710> look<00:01:37.890> at<00:01:37.979> it<00:01:38.189> Skylands

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
time I mean look at it Skylands

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.630 
time I mean look at it Skylands
awesomeness<00:01:39.810> I<00:01:40.079> mean<00:01:40.860> yeah<00:01:40.979> may<00:01:41.250> seem<00:01:41.460> like<00:01:41.579> a

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
awesomeness I mean yeah may seem like a

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.429 
awesomeness I mean yeah may seem like a
basic<00:01:42.030> generation<00:01:42.509> nothing<00:01:42.810> like<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.049> afer

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
basic generation nothing like the afer

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.499 
basic generation nothing like the afer
but<00:01:43.649> I<00:01:43.860> think<00:01:44.399> it's<00:01:44.520> quite<00:01:44.670> a<00:01:44.790> nice<00:01:44.970> addition

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
but I think it's quite a nice addition

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.480 
but I think it's quite a nice addition
that<00:01:45.600> hasn't<00:01:46.170> actually<00:01:46.350> been<00:01:46.590> added<00:01:47.369> yet

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
that hasn't actually been added yet

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.520 
that hasn't actually been added yet
supposedly<00:01:48.180> and<00:01:48.390> it's<00:01:48.750> still<00:01:48.930> generating<00:01:49.320> as

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
supposedly and it's still generating as

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.770 
supposedly and it's still generating as
I've<00:01:49.619> only<00:01:49.740> just<00:01:49.829> got<00:01:49.979> here<00:01:50.159> so<00:01:50.610> you<00:01:50.670> know<00:01:50.850> you

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
I've only just got here so you know you

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.569 
I've only just got here so you know you
can<00:01:51.899> expect<00:01:52.439> it<00:01:52.590> to<00:01:52.680> only<00:01:52.770> just<00:01:52.890> be<00:01:53.100> generating

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
can expect it to only just be generating

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.569 
can expect it to only just be generating
but<00:01:54.180> yeah<00:01:54.950> really<00:01:55.950> they're<00:01:56.100> always<00:01:56.310> that
