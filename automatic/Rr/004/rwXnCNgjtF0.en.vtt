00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 that all of this all we end up on a 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.450
 video of the string stands four 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.840
 of them both for a watch two 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:16.379
 super special a video for them 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:19.800
 baltham so here is tristan even or 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.699
 so has the chain of the blow she will take 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.199
 a new start 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:30.449
 So we will have videos to 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:33.480
 Bantam experiences and games 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.559
 just as usual so here we go 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.680
 start by learning 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.989
 your positions then me personally 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.570
 I class like that so it's regular 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.239
 we with tristan and regula we place 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.379
 like that but we have a 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.600
 little problem to not do a 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.730
 problem but it's weird that he he 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.860
 is wrong that I did and I am regulated 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.750
 and he right-handed he is also regulated 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.730
 but I think it's according to how we have 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.960
 learned to skateboard here you go 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:06.240
 and so and to make goofy so that's 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:08.040
 in the sense with like that so there like 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.439
 we look at me tristan we see two 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.290
 left feet to regularize them will be at 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:15.420
 the back and ottawa 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.210
 your right foot it will be up front then 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.100
 if you goofy things your foot 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.990
 left will have in front your right foot 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.810
 will be the back 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:28.049
 so here we learn the basics 1 so 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:32.990
 after to advance the already seen the morning 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:35.549
 here to advance already there are several 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:38.070
 Walloon ways that we put our foot in 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.390
 before good like that up front with our 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:49.860
 country at the back recalled funeral 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:52.280
 it takes good and flex on people who 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.790
 grow well before 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.070
 personally I would see this not 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:03.490
 so that gives that and only two 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:05.140
 writings - that's it for turning one goes 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.050
 always be well flex on his legs 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.840
 and it's not our body that will go to 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:13.120
 side another is our feet 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:16.060
 for example there to turn left on 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.910
 press if you are regular you press 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:23.770
 on the chest so the time you 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:26.730
 push to turn or we learned 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:32.110
 on the heel turn right 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:33.610
 this is how it is so you do not have to 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.709
 neither is it too hard the emmental 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.810
 it must be because it happened 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:39.700
 to make figures made to roll 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.740
 to make descents we will be able to 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.740
 in December to roll it is a little 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:47.620
 like a longboard but a little so I 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:49.720
 so you personally advise so 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.160
 me it's benjamin and behind the camera 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.980
 and restaurants remain present and 1 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:57.120
 so me it's benjamin you do not have 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:59.050
 never seen our heads and tristan bah lo 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:03.610
 so normally I'm not wearing my hair 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:05.709
 like that but that's so tristan she 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:09.310
 is a bit stiff I find but she 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:13.330
 still runs well so pretty much 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:15.519
 lives it's a little bit more 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.630
 down that screw finally for me 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:18.489
 personally it's a little lower 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.680
 that the screw must move a little 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:22.150
 still when we could follow so 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.450
 for the wheels also they are more 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:29.470
 soft that skates English 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:33.580
 pretty much finished so for them 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:35.350
 for the tutorial number so in fact it will do 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:38.320
 the first it will be the beginnings so 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:40.920
 how to move forward and every second 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.780
 second is a little as soon as you have 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:50.459
 not too technical but a little bit 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:51.750
 legs defend my third so the 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:54.270
 second it will be a little tricks 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:59.880
 business are small rice here and 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:04:01.910
 the third would be a little low 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:05.430
 will all the other stuff be there again 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:06.420
