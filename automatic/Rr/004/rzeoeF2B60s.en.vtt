00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:20.700
RUBICK: Missed me!

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.000
Ha ha ha ho ho!

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.500
Aw...

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.000
INVOKER: Quas Wex Exort!

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.500
ENIGMA: That blast was deafening!

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.500
Oh...

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.100
Not again. I mean, oink!

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.100
INVOKER: And now upon you a Chaos Meteor!

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.500
BB: Take this!

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.000
And that!

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.600
Bollocks...

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.000
BOTH: Hahahahaha!

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.400
ENIGMA: Haha you're getting stunned, like, a lot,
it's funny.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.000
Uh oh, if there's one thing Pudge is good
at, it's killing himself!

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.000
Can someone get him?

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.200
RUBICK: I'ma comin'!

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:30.600
ENIGMA: Yeah!

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:34.500
Double Kill!

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.200
GYRO: Die die die die die!

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:43.500
BB: That'll do.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.200
Double Kill!

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.500
BB: No, hey!

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.500
Hey you, focus on me!

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.500
RUBICK: Get back, Gyrocopter! Retreat!

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.400
Wait a second...

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:05.889
INVOKER: This standoff could last for ages.

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:10.300
RUBICK: I have a feeling it won't, Spectre's Aegis
will expire soon.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.000
RUBICK: Woohoo.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.800
GYRO: Woohoo, that fight got me enough gold to finish
my Manta Style!

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.200
NIGEL: Congrats, Gyrocopter.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.430
GYRO: We just need an Ultimate Orb, and the recipe.

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:25.620
NIGEL: Oh I've seen this before.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.690
And I suppose you now headbutt it and it magically
becomes a Manta Style.

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.770
GYRO: Hah, don't be silly, that's not how you make
a Manta Style.

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.200
NIGEL: Oh, well then how do you assemble it?

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.500
GYRO: First you take all the pieces and gather them
like this, that's good,

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.800
and then,

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.900
YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.100
And there you go.
