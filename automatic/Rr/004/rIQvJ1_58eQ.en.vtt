00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
versus the wet so let's just start

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.859 
versus the wet so let's just start
adding<00:00:16.410> a<00:00:16.650> color<00:00:16.859> on<00:00:17.160> here<00:00:17.449> you<00:00:18.449> notice<00:00:18.720> it

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
adding a color on here you notice it

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.320

foams<00:00:19.170> up<00:00:19.410> a<00:00:19.560> little<00:00:19.740> bit<00:00:19.949> doesn't<00:00:20.160> it<00:00:20.369> yeah<00:00:20.670> so

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
foams up a little bit doesn't it yeah so

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.509 
foams up a little bit doesn't it yeah so
I<00:00:21.750> understand<00:00:22.320> Helen<00:00:22.710> Frankenthaler<00:00:22.890> use

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
I understand Helen Frankenthaler use

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.460 
I understand Helen Frankenthaler use
some<00:00:23.730> kind<00:00:23.939> of<00:00:24.090> detergent<00:00:24.480> to<00:00:25.170> do<00:00:25.320> this

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
some kind of detergent to do this

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.050 
some kind of detergent to do this
because<00:00:25.710> they<00:00:25.890> didn't<00:00:26.099> have<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.369> flow<00:00:26.580> a<00:00:29.060> pair

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
because they didn't have the flow a pair

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.540 
because they didn't have the flow a pair
of<00:00:30.090> face<00:00:30.470> exactly<00:00:31.470> which<00:00:31.650> open<00:00:32.009> ways<00:00:32.250> or

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.479 
thing is the reason I have the cuffs
here<00:02:36.239> is<00:02:36.450> so<00:02:36.720> that<00:02:36.870> we<00:02:36.989> can<00:02:37.019> mix<00:02:37.470> up<00:02:37.739> our<00:02:38.100> EM

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
here is so that we can mix up our EM

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:43.640 
here is so that we can mix up our EM
more<00:02:38.730> cups<00:02:38.970> should<00:02:39.600> get<00:02:39.720> more<00:02:39.870> cups<00:02:40.109> sure<00:02:42.650> so

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
more cups should get more cups sure so

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.530 
more cups should get more cups sure so
I'm<00:02:43.950> gonna<00:02:44.160> mix<00:02:44.370> up<00:02:44.930> and<00:02:46.760> adding<00:02:47.760> flow<00:02:48.120> Eden

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
I'm gonna mix up and adding flow Eden

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.580 
I'm gonna mix up and adding flow Eden
really<00:02:49.010> helps<00:02:50.010> the<00:02:50.519> color<00:02:50.730> bleed<00:02:51.470> but<00:02:52.470> it's

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
really helps the color bleed but it's

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:53.780 
really helps the color bleed but it's
the<00:02:52.709> kind<00:02:52.920> of<00:02:52.980> thing<00:02:53.160> that<00:02:53.190> you'd<00:02:53.430> want<00:02:53.670> to

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
the kind of thing that you'd want to

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.970 
the kind of thing that you'd want to
experiment<00:02:54.239> with<00:02:54.450> some<00:02:55.019> flowing<00:02:55.440> and<00:02:55.799> not

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
experiment with some flowing and not

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:02.319 
experiment with some flowing and not
flowy

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:02.329 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:05.149 

see<00:03:03.329> that<00:03:03.510> that's<00:03:03.930> a<00:03:04.079> little<00:03:04.260> thicker<00:03:04.650> so<00:03:05.010> I

00:03:05.149 --> 00:03:05.159 
see that that's a little thicker so I

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:06.619 
see that that's a little thicker so I
kind<00:03:05.489> of<00:03:05.549> like<00:03:05.700> that<00:03:05.909> effect<00:03:06.060> when<00:03:06.450> there's

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:06.629 
kind of like that effect when there's

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:08.000 
kind of like that effect when there's
actually<00:03:06.959> some<00:03:07.170> pigment<00:03:07.590> that's<00:03:07.769> not

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
actually some pigment that's not

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.630 
actually some pigment that's not
perfectly<00:03:08.819> dispersed
