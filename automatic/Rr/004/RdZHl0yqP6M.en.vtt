term for though you put things through
the<00:01:34.229> problem<00:01:34.560> hole<00:01:34.710> and<00:01:34.860> they<00:01:34.920> end<00:01:35.100> up<00:01:35.189> in<00:01:35.310> the

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
the problem hole and they end up in the

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.130 
the problem hole and they end up in the
problem<00:01:35.610> gene<00:01:35.759> you<00:01:36.420> feed<00:01:36.659> something<00:01:36.960> in<00:01:37.049> the

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
problem gene you feed something in the

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.289 
problem gene you feed something in the
problem<00:01:37.439> hole<00:01:37.619> is<00:01:38.250> that<00:01:38.310> right<00:01:38.670> Carl<00:01:38.939> it<00:01:39.119> goes

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
problem hole is that right Carl it goes

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.850 
problem hole is that right Carl it goes
through<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.570> pollen<00:01:39.869> tube<00:01:40.110> into<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.470> problem

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
through the pollen tube into the problem

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.530 
through the pollen tube into the problem
gene<00:01:41.040> okay<00:01:41.790> so<00:01:41.850> it's<00:01:42.090> down<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.299> problem

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
gene okay so it's down the problem

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.719 
gene okay so it's down the problem
conduit<00:01:42.960> okay<00:01:43.140> corner<00:01:43.439> right<00:01:43.680> so<00:01:44.280> it's<00:01:44.549> better

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
conduit okay corner right so it's better

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.010

could<00:04:12.680> feel<00:04:12.890> the<00:04:13.070> problem<00:04:13.460> balls<00:04:13.670> but<00:04:14.210> you'd

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:14.330 
could feel the problem balls but you'd

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:15.850 
could feel the problem balls but you'd
have<00:04:14.360> to<00:04:14.540> insert<00:04:15.140> his<00:04:15.260> finger<00:04:15.500> in<00:04:15.560> the<00:04:15.590> bottom

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:15.860 
have to insert his finger in the bottom

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:18.550 
have to insert his finger in the bottom
hole<00:04:15.980> wouldn't<00:04:16.250> he<00:04:16.310> right<00:04:16.580> okay<00:04:17.090> so<00:04:17.260> so<00:04:18.260> Karl

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 
hole wouldn't he right okay so so Karl

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.970 
hole wouldn't he right okay so so Karl
gone<00:04:18.860> then<00:04:19.100> I<00:04:19.220> was<00:04:19.370> getting<00:04:19.550> a<00:04:19.730> tank
