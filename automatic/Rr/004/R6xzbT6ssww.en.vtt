I'm going to talk about sniping to you

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.560 
I'm going to talk about sniping to you
guys<00:00:50.250> because<00:00:50.430> I<00:00:50.610> know<00:00:50.670> a<00:00:50.969> lot<00:00:51.300> of<00:00:51.480> people

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
guys because I know a lot of people

guys because I know a lot of people
don't<00:00:52.020> like<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.260> sniping<00:00:52.590> in<00:00:52.739> this<00:00:52.829> game<00:00:53.010> they

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
don't like the sniping in this game they

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.319 
don't like the sniping in this game they
think<00:00:53.340> it's<00:00:53.460> all<00:00:53.520> been<00:00:53.699> ruined<00:00:54.000> because<00:00:54.120> you

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
think it's all been ruined because you

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.450 
think it's all been ruined because you
can<00:00:54.480> no<00:00:54.570> longer<00:00:54.780> quick<00:00:55.110> scope<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:55.710> all<00:00:56.340> the

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
can no longer quick scope and all the

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.189 
can no longer quick scope and all the
little<00:00:56.520> gimmicks<00:00:57.000> that<00:00:57.180> track<00:00:57.719> are<00:00:57.930> put<00:00:58.079> in

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
little gimmicks that track are put in

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.380 
little gimmicks that track are put in
like<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:59.160> sway<00:00:59.430> when<00:00:59.670> you<00:00:59.760> first<00:01:00.000> scrape<00:01:00.239> into

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
like the sway when you first scrape into

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.810 
like the sway when you first scrape into
your<00:01:00.629> sniper<00:01:00.899> and<00:01:01.260> they're<00:01:02.070> like<00:01:02.219> what<00:01:02.609> me<00:01:02.789> and

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
your sniper and they're like what me and

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.219 
your sniper and they're like what me and
my<00:01:02.940> friends<00:01:03.149> like<00:01:03.210> to<00:01:03.359> call<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.629> two-second

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
my friends like to call the two-second

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.780 
my friends like to call the two-second
rule<00:01:04.260> I<00:01:04.530> think<00:01:04.920> it's<00:01:05.010> quite<00:01:05.100> two<00:01:05.280> seconds<00:01:05.700> but

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
rule I think it's quite two seconds but

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.730 
rule I think it's quite two seconds but
for<00:01:06.420> those<00:01:06.510> of<00:01:06.570> you<00:01:06.750> who<00:01:06.869> don't<00:01:06.960> know<00:01:07.080> for<00:01:07.409> the

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
for those of you who don't know for the

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.609 
for those of you who don't know for the
first<00:01:08.210> second<00:01:09.210> second<00:01:09.689> and<00:01:09.780> a<00:01:09.810> half<00:01:09.840> I<00:01:10.229> don't

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
first second second and a half I don't

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.980 
first second second and a half I don't
know<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.890> exact<00:01:11.220> time<00:01:11.310> or<00:01:11.729> anything<00:01:12.090> but<00:01:12.630> for

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
know the exact time or anything but for

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.420 
know the exact time or anything but for
a<00:01:13.020> very<00:01:13.380> short<00:01:13.500> period<00:01:13.740> that<00:01:14.159> you<00:01:14.220> skipped

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
a very short period that you skipped

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.910 
a very short period that you skipped
into<00:01:14.670> your<00:01:14.790> sniper<00:01:15.060> when<00:01:15.869> you<00:01:16.020> shoot<00:01:16.619> where

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
into your sniper when you shoot where

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.800 
into your sniper when you shoot where
your<00:01:17.040> crosshairs<00:01:17.460> are<00:01:17.580> aimed<00:01:17.759> your<00:01:18.540> bullet

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
your crosshairs are aimed your bullet

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.320 
your crosshairs are aimed your bullet
will<00:01:18.900> not<00:01:19.020> go<00:01:19.170> there<00:01:19.580> so<00:01:20.580> obviously<00:01:21.000> it<00:01:21.240> makes

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
will not go there so obviously it makes

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.850 
will not go there so obviously it makes
quick<00:01:21.630> skipping<00:01:21.960> near<00:01:22.110> impossible<00:01:22.290> and<00:01:22.680> most

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
quick skipping near impossible and most

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.780 
quick skipping near impossible and most
quick<00:01:23.100> scopes<00:01:23.430> are<00:01:24.470> luck<00:01:25.470> I<00:01:25.710> guess<00:01:25.740> that's<00:01:26.610> why

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
quick scopes are luck I guess that's why

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.520 
quick scopes are luck I guess that's why
as<00:01:27.119> you<00:01:27.390> can<00:01:27.509> see<00:01:27.720> like<00:01:27.900> beginning<00:01:28.200> each<00:01:28.320> game

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
as you can see like beginning each game

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.980 
as you can see like beginning each game
or<00:01:28.710> using<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:28.950> variable<00:01:29.250> zoom<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:29.820> a<00:01:30.689> tip<00:01:30.900> I

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
or using the variable zoom and a tip I

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.960 
or using the variable zoom and a tip I
learnt<00:01:31.170> from<00:01:31.350> object<00:01:31.650> predator<00:01:32.009> in<00:01:32.220> one<00:01:32.939> of

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
learnt from object predator in one of

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.359 
learnt from object predator in one of
those<00:01:33.090> videos<00:01:33.420> if<00:01:33.750> you<00:01:33.900> stay<00:01:34.200> into<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:34.890> second

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
those videos if you stay into the second

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.789 
those videos if you stay into the second
zoom<00:01:35.549> of<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:36.150> variable<00:01:37.110> zoom<00:01:37.229> because<00:01:37.500> the

zoom of the variable zoom because the

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.109 
zoom of the variable zoom because the
variable<00:01:38.070> zooms<00:01:38.250> got<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.520> one<00:01:38.640> you<00:01:38.729> start<00:01:39.000> on

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
variable zooms got the one you start on

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.030 
variable zooms got the one you start on
the<00:01:39.329> second<00:01:39.630> one<00:01:39.750> and<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.079> third<00:01:40.110> one<00:01:40.290> you

send a second one which is probably the

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.460 
send a second one which is probably the

best medium anyway you scope in I have a

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.679 
best medium anyway you scope in I have a
slightly<00:01:46.710> quicker<00:01:46.920> or<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:48.149> bullet<00:01:48.360> goes<00:01:48.659> a

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
slightly quicker or the bullet goes a

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.960 
slightly quicker or the bullet goes a
bit<00:01:48.869> more<00:01:49.020> straight<00:01:49.409> so<00:01:49.979> you<00:01:50.040> can<00:01:50.220> quick<00:01:50.700> scope

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
bit more straight so you can quick scope

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.990 
bit more straight so you can quick scope
in<00:01:51.149> a<00:01:51.240> sense<00:01:51.659> because<00:01:52.320> I<00:01:52.649> guess<00:01:53.280> you<00:01:53.520> can<00:01:53.700> click

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
in a sense because I guess you can click

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.719 
in a sense because I guess you can click
skip<00:01:54.180> I<00:01:54.299> guess<00:01:54.509> but<00:01:55.110> like<00:01:55.290> also<00:01:55.649> now<00:01:56.130> like<00:01:56.399> wait

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
skip I guess but like also now like wait

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.219 
skip I guess but like also now like wait
as<00:01:56.909> you<00:01:57.030> go<00:01:57.119> to<00:01:57.180> scope<00:01:57.420> in<00:01:57.600> it<00:01:57.810> takes<00:01:57.990> up<00:01:58.140> the

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
as you go to scope in it takes up the

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.539 
as you go to scope in it takes up the
whole<00:01:58.259> screen<00:01:58.619> straight<00:01:58.979> away<00:01:59.159> instead<00:01:59.430> of

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
whole screen straight away instead of

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.219 
whole screen straight away instead of
waiting<00:02:00.000> to<00:02:00.210> follow<00:02:00.360> into<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:00.780> lens<00:02:00.930> of<00:02:01.140> the

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
waiting to follow into the lens of the

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.660 
waiting to follow into the lens of the
sniper<00:02:01.469> scope<00:02:01.770> so<00:02:01.979> it<00:02:02.070> makes<00:02:02.219> a<00:02:02.310> quick<00:02:02.399> scope

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
sniper scope so it makes a quick scope

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.280 
sniper scope so it makes a quick scope
something<00:02:02.880> look<00:02:02.969> it's<00:02:03.119> nice<00:02:03.240> game<00:02:04.110> winning

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
something look it's nice game winning

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.810 
something look it's nice game winning
kills<00:02:04.560> when<00:02:04.860> they're<00:02:04.979> quick<00:02:05.159> scopes<00:02:05.430> is<00:02:05.640> still

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
kills when they're quick scopes is still

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.789 
kills when they're quick scopes is still
don't<00:02:05.969> look<00:02:06.119> that<00:02:06.240> great<00:02:06.420> so<00:02:06.810> spit<00:02:07.649> of<00:02:07.740> a

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
don't look that great so spit of a

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.490 
don't look that great so spit of a
turn-off<00:02:08.129> really<00:02:08.580> but<00:02:09.179> I<00:02:09.479> thought<00:02:10.289> think

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
turn-off really but I thought think

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.320 
turn-off really but I thought think
sniping<00:02:10.890> in<00:02:10.979> this<00:02:11.069> game<00:02:11.250> hasn't<00:02:11.520> been

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
sniping in this game hasn't been

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.550 
sniping in this game hasn't been
that<00:02:12.510> much<00:02:12.660> because<00:02:12.840> otherwise<00:02:13.110> I<00:02:13.410> wouldn't

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
that much because otherwise I wouldn't

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.190 
that much because otherwise I wouldn't
have<00:02:13.620> to<00:02:13.740> do<00:02:13.890> half<00:02:14.070> decent<00:02:14.250> with<00:02:14.520> one<00:02:14.700> because

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
have to do half decent with one because

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.540 
have to do half decent with one because
