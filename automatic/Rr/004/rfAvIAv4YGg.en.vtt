00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
through the race and we looked at a lot

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.650 
through the race and we looked at a lot
of<00:00:48.930> competitive<00:00:49.590> shoes<00:00:49.920> in<00:00:50.250> this<00:00:50.730> that<00:00:51.329> people

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
of competitive shoes in this that people

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.209 
of competitive shoes in this that people
are<00:00:51.750> using<00:00:51.930> for<00:00:52.230> ultra<00:00:52.530> running<00:00:52.739> and<00:00:53.100> we

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
are using for ultra running and we

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.130 
are using for ultra running and we
noticed<00:00:53.520> one<00:00:53.760> major<00:00:54.059> thing<00:00:54.239> like<00:00:54.750> none<00:00:55.020> of

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
noticed one major thing like none of

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.590 
noticed one major thing like none of
these<00:00:55.260> shoes<00:00:55.620> are<00:00:56.489> designed<00:00:56.670> from<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.270> inside

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
these shoes are designed from the inside

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.410 
these shoes are designed from the inside
out<00:00:57.629> if<00:00:58.320> you<00:00:58.620> think<00:00:58.800> about<00:00:59.129> what<00:01:00.059> your<00:01:00.239> foot

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
out if you think about what your foot

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.110 
out if you think about what your foot
goes<00:01:00.660> through<00:01:01.020> anywhere<00:01:01.859> from<00:01:02.010> 50<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.520> 100

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
goes through anywhere from 50 to 100

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.939 
goes through anywhere from 50 to 100
miles<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.750> inside<00:01:04.140> of<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.290> shoe<00:01:04.530> should<00:01:04.589> be

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
miles the inside of the shoe should be

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.859 
miles the inside of the shoe should be
super<00:01:05.489> seamless<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:06.210> should<00:01:06.420> feel<00:01:06.630> really

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
super seamless and should feel really

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.480 
super seamless and should feel really
good<00:01:06.990> but<00:01:07.439> when<00:01:07.619> we<00:01:07.710> started<00:01:08.100> cutting<00:01:08.369> these

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
good but when we started cutting these

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.030 
good but when we started cutting these
shoes<00:01:08.760> open<00:01:09.180> there's<00:01:09.930> like<00:01:10.200> materials

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
shoes open there's like materials

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.880 
shoes open there's like materials
everywhere<00:01:11.580> seems<00:01:12.390> everywhere<00:01:12.930> random

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
everywhere seems everywhere random

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.600 
everywhere seems everywhere random
stitches<00:01:14.460> so<00:01:15.150> what<00:01:15.600> we<00:01:15.720> really<00:01:16.049> did<00:01:16.290> is

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
stitches so what we really did is

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.830 
stitches so what we really did is
started<00:01:17.610> thinking<00:01:17.970> about<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.299> shoe<00:01:18.479> from<00:01:18.689> the

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
started thinking about the shoe from the

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.039 
started thinking about the shoe from the
inside<00:01:19.200> out<00:01:19.229> and<00:01:19.740> I<00:01:20.700> worked<00:01:21.240> here<00:01:21.509> in<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.840> room

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
inside out and I worked here in the room

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.200 
inside out and I worked here in the room
on<00:01:22.229> I'm<00:01:22.470> currently<00:01:23.220> in<00:01:23.280> which<00:01:23.700> is<00:01:23.850> our<00:01:24.000> little

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
on I'm currently in which is our little

on I'm currently in which is our little
proto<00:01:24.570> shop<00:01:24.900> where<00:01:25.470> we<00:01:25.619> pretty<00:01:26.340> much<00:01:26.430> tinker

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
proto shop where we pretty much tinker

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.200 
proto shop where we pretty much tinker
and<00:01:27.560> figure<00:01:28.560> out<00:01:28.619> solutions<00:01:29.040> for<00:01:29.700> how<00:01:30.150> we

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
and figure out solutions for how we

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.230 
and figure out solutions for how we

these little paper experiments just

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.660 
these little paper experiments just
trying<00:01:41.729> to<00:01:41.820> figure<00:01:42.030> out<00:01:42.210> how<00:01:43.200> i<00:01:43.229> would

reappropriation

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:56.690 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:58.870 

a<00:01:56.750> ton<00:01:57.110> gusset<00:01:57.620> be<00:01:57.890> one<00:01:58.280> single<00:01:58.550> material

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
a ton gusset be one single material

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.870 
a ton gusset be one single material
across<00:01:59.480> the<00:01:59.810> foot<00:02:00.080> so<00:02:00.680> the<00:02:01.370> inside<00:02:01.730> of<00:02:01.760> the

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
across the foot so the inside of the

across the foot so the inside of the
shoe<00:02:02.120> doesn't<00:02:02.540> have<00:02:02.750> all<00:02:03.020> that<00:02:03.380> unnecessary

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.150 
shoe doesn't have all that unnecessary

shoe doesn't have all that unnecessary
stuff<00:02:05.150> in<00:02:05.360> it<00:02:05.540> and<00:02:05.890> the<00:02:06.890> final<00:02:07.100> result<00:02:07.640> was

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
guys can all take a look at on the 12 10

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:20.370 
guys can all take a look at on the 12 10
and<00:02:14.470> try<00:02:15.470> it<00:02:15.530> out<00:02:15.710> because<00:02:16.960> it's<00:02:17.960> really<00:02:18.200> cool

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
and try it out because it's really cool

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.870 
and try it out because it's really cool
in<00:02:21.380> the<00:02:21.590> studio<00:02:21.830> group<00:02:22.280> a<00:02:22.430> really<00:02:22.700> unique

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
in the studio group a really unique

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.850 
in the studio group a really unique
thing<00:02:23.240> we<00:02:23.390> do<00:02:23.600> is<00:02:23.810> we<00:02:23.960> take<00:02:24.110> a<00:02:24.170> look<00:02:24.470> at<00:02:24.620> outside

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
thing we do is we take a look at outside

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.730 
thing we do is we take a look at outside
industries<00:02:25.700> of<00:02:25.970> footwear<00:02:26.420> so<00:02:26.720> we<00:02:27.380> look<00:02:27.620> a<00:02:27.710> lot

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
industries of footwear so we look a lot

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:31.150 
industries of footwear so we look a lot
towards<00:02:28.780> technical<00:02:29.780> outerwear<00:02:30.320> in<00:02:30.590> this<00:02:30.920> case

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
towards technical outerwear in this case

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.880 
towards technical outerwear in this case
you<00:02:31.460> have<00:02:31.640> like<00:02:32.120> a<00:02:32.150> really<00:02:32.750> technical<00:02:33.110> jacket

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
you have like a really technical jacket

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.460 
you have like a really technical jacket
and<00:02:34.070> stuff<00:02:34.430> like<00:02:34.640> this<00:02:34.820> can<00:02:35.090> go<00:02:35.930> a<00:02:35.960> long<00:02:36.230> way

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
and stuff like this can go a long way

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.850 
and stuff like this can go a long way
and<00:02:36.680> inspiring<00:02:37.130> how<00:02:37.580> we<00:02:37.640> look<00:02:38.000> at<00:02:38.860> patterning

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
and inspiring how we look at patterning

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.830 
and inspiring how we look at patterning
in<00:02:40.010> material<00:02:40.520> and<00:02:40.640> process<00:02:41.060> on<00:02:41.330> a<00:02:41.360> lot<00:02:41.600> of<00:02:41.720> our

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
in material and process on a lot of our

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.720 
in material and process on a lot of our
shoes<00:02:42.140> if<00:02:42.500> you<00:02:42.740> look<00:02:42.920> at<00:02:43.070> the<00:02:43.100> 1210

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
shoes if you look at the 1210

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.020 
shoes if you look at the 1210
construction<00:02:44.630> a<00:02:45.190> lot<00:02:46.190> of<00:02:46.340> that<00:02:46.460> stuff<00:02:46.820> is

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
construction a lot of that stuff is

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.500 
construction a lot of that stuff is
highly<00:02:47.870> inspired<00:02:48.560> by<00:02:49.040> what<00:02:49.550> we<00:02:49.700> see<00:02:49.730> going<00:02:50.000> on

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
highly inspired by what we see going on

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.750 
highly inspired by what we see going on
in<00:02:50.750> other<00:02:51.230> industries<00:02:51.530> that<00:02:52.310> are<00:02:52.370> a<00:02:52.520> little

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
in other industries that are a little

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.840 
in other industries that are a little
bit<00:02:52.970> further<00:02:53.210> ahead<00:02:53.510> in<00:02:53.870> this<00:02:54.650> in<00:02:54.920> this<00:02:55.580> kind

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
bit further ahead in this in this kind

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.340 
bit further ahead in this in this kind
of<00:02:55.940> stuff<00:02:56.210> so<00:02:57.070> you<00:02:58.070> have<00:02:58.220> seamless

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
of stuff so you have seamless

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.400 
of stuff so you have seamless
constructions<00:03:00.610> really<00:03:01.610> well-thought-out

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
constructions really well-thought-out

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.520 
constructions really well-thought-out
patterning<00:03:03.580> and<00:03:04.690> you<00:03:05.690> can<00:03:05.840> start<00:03:06.110> thinking

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
patterning and you can start thinking

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.530 
patterning and you can start thinking
about<00:03:06.650> things<00:03:07.040> designed<00:03:07.820> from<00:03:08.060> the<00:03:08.209> inside

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
about things designed from the inside

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.960 
about things designed from the inside
out<00:03:08.570> and<00:03:09.080> wear<00:03:09.560> your<00:03:09.709> body<00:03:10.070> actually

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
out and wear your body actually

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.150 
out and wear your body actually
interacts<00:03:11.780> with<00:03:11.810> the<00:03:11.989> product<00:03:12.440> is<00:03:12.620> inside<00:03:13.010> the

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
interacts with the product is inside the
