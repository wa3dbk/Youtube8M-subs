00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
been able to do that with just a little

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.050 
been able to do that with just a little
practice<00:03:59.549> time<00:04:00.049> well<00:04:01.100> again<00:04:02.100> we<00:04:02.430> try<00:04:02.850> to<00:04:02.880> keep

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
practice time well again we try to keep

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:03.860 
practice time well again we try to keep
it<00:04:03.180> simple<00:04:03.329> and

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
it simple and

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.800 
it simple and
we<00:04:04.319> don't<00:04:04.500> have<00:04:04.680> a<00:04:04.709> hard<00:04:05.420> you<00:04:06.420> know<00:04:06.510> I<00:04:06.569> think

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
we don't have a hard you know I think

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.420 
we don't have a hard you know I think
the<00:04:07.049> concepts<00:04:07.560> pretty<00:04:07.799> is<00:04:07.920> what<00:04:08.129> we're<00:04:08.280> trying

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
the concepts pretty is what we're trying

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.199 
the concepts pretty is what we're trying
to<00:04:08.610> do<00:04:08.760> but<00:04:09.180> it's<00:04:09.599> sometimes<00:04:10.319> hard<00:04:10.799> to<00:04:11.209> play

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
to do but it's sometimes hard to play

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:13.699 
to do but it's sometimes hard to play
that<00:04:12.450> way<00:04:12.599> because<00:04:12.900> it's<00:04:13.260> a<00:04:13.379> little<00:04:13.590> bit

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
that way because it's a little bit

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:16.099 
that way because it's a little bit
different<00:04:14.129> and<00:04:14.250> but<00:04:14.970> he<00:04:15.150> has<00:04:15.390> an<00:04:15.599> attacking

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
different and but he has an attacking

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:18.080 
different and but he has an attacking
mentality<00:04:16.290> and<00:04:16.889> he<00:04:17.040> can<00:04:17.340> get<00:04:17.489> into<00:04:17.729> the<00:04:17.850> paint

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
mentality and he can get into the paint

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.000 
mentality and he can get into the paint
and<00:04:18.269> we<00:04:18.479> spread<00:04:18.780> the<00:04:18.870> floor<00:04:19.109> and<00:04:19.440> he<00:04:19.650> moved<00:04:19.889> to

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
and we spread the floor and he moved to

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.560 
and we spread the floor and he moved to
the<00:04:20.100> ball<00:04:20.250> and<00:04:20.459> there's<00:04:20.669> no<00:04:20.820> selfishness<00:04:21.299> and

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
the ball and there's no selfishness and

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.240 
the ball and there's no selfishness and
he's<00:04:21.690> just<00:04:21.810> trying<00:04:21.959> to<00:04:22.139> read<00:04:22.290> each<00:04:22.440> play<00:04:22.740> and

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
he's just trying to read each play and

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.939 
he's just trying to read each play and
he's<00:04:23.729> a<00:04:23.760> point<00:04:23.970> guard<00:04:24.090> and<00:04:24.419> those<00:04:25.380> guys<00:04:25.650> you

00:04:25.939 --> 00:04:25.949 
he's a point guard and those guys you

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:27.950 
he's a point guard and those guys you
know<00:04:26.280> I<00:04:26.370> think<00:04:26.880> he'll<00:04:27.030> get<00:04:27.150> better<00:04:27.360> and

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
know I think he'll get better and

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.530 
know I think he'll get better and
definitely<00:04:28.110> get<00:04:28.380> better<00:04:28.500> and<00:04:29.060> but<00:04:30.060> he<00:04:30.180> has<00:04:30.330> an

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:30.540 
definitely get better and but he has an

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.780 
definitely get better and but he has an
innate<00:04:30.840> ability<00:04:31.500> to<00:04:31.680> be<00:04:31.800> able<00:04:31.979> to<00:04:32.220> see<00:04:32.580> guys

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:32.790 
innate ability to be able to see guys

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:34.490 
innate ability to be able to see guys
and<00:04:33.150> to<00:04:33.240> understand<00:04:33.630> guys<00:04:33.780> one<00:04:34.050> time<00:04:34.229> there

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
and to understand guys one time there

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.890 
and to understand guys one time there
was<00:04:34.620> a<00:04:34.710> play<00:04:34.889> where<00:04:35.190> I<00:04:35.430> think<00:04:35.820> chomp<00:04:36.419> was<00:04:36.720> in

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.080 
was a play where I think chomp was in
front<00:04:37.169> of<00:04:37.320> novak<00:04:37.830> both<00:04:38.520> of<00:04:38.639> them<00:04:38.760> were<00:04:38.820> kind<00:04:38.970> of

shooter<00:04:45.720> and<00:04:46.199> just<00:04:46.500> little<00:04:46.740> things<00:04:46.800> like<00:04:47.010> that

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.130 
shooter and just little things like that

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:50.210 
shooter and just little things like that
that<00:04:47.490> you<00:04:48.090> can't<00:04:48.539> explain<00:04:48.960> the<00:04:49.020> game<00:04:49.470> all<00:04:50.160> the

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
that you can't explain the game all the

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.400 
that you can't explain the game all the
time<00:04:50.460> and<00:04:50.940> he<00:04:51.300> doesn't<00:04:51.539> need<00:04:51.750> to<00:04:51.810> explain<00:04:52.199> he

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.410 
time and he doesn't need to explain he

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:55.400 
time and he doesn't need to explain he
knows<00:04:52.590> the<00:04:52.830> game<00:04:52.949> so<00:04:53.810> like<00:04:54.810> you<00:04:54.930> have<00:04:54.960> any<00:04:55.139> idea

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.410 
knows the game so like you have any idea

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:57.439 
knows the game so like you have any idea
on<00:04:55.470> the<00:04:55.620> extent<00:04:55.949> of<00:04:56.220> the<00:04:56.340> injury<00:04:56.580> to<00:04:56.699> Carmelo<00:04:57.060> I

00:04:57.439 --> 00:04:57.449 
on the extent of the injury to Carmelo I

00:04:57.449 --> 00:04:59.300 
on the extent of the injury to Carmelo I
think<00:04:57.840> it's<00:04:57.990> just<00:04:58.110> a<00:04:58.260> string<00:04:58.620> growing<00:04:59.039> and

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
think it's just a string growing and

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:00.950 
think it's just a string growing and
they<00:04:59.820> probably<00:05:00.060> day-to-day<00:05:00.690> they'll

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 
they probably day-to-day they'll

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.290 
they probably day-to-day they'll
evaluate<00:05:01.590> tomorrow<00:05:02.190> though<00:05:02.430> because<00:05:02.850> usually

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:03.300 
evaluate tomorrow though because usually

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:04.879 
evaluate tomorrow though because usually
a<00:05:03.330> day<00:05:03.479> or<00:05:03.600> two<00:05:03.720> after<00:05:03.900> that<00:05:04.199> you<00:05:04.289> feel<00:05:04.620> you

plays<00:06:13.440> but<00:06:13.710> he<00:06:13.770> has<00:06:13.860> a<00:06:13.890> burst<00:06:14.159> of<00:06:14.370> speed<00:06:14.460> that

00:06:14.839 --> 00:06:14.849 
plays but he has a burst of speed that

00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:15.830
