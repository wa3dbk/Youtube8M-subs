anything about fire fighting it was

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:38.430 
anything about fire fighting it was
interesting<00:00:37.149> to<00:00:37.210> see<00:00:37.269> the<00:00:37.390> tactics<00:00:37.960> used<00:00:38.199> when

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:38.440 
interesting to see the tactics used when

dealing with forest fires fire breaks is

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.090 
dealing with forest fires fire breaks is
a<00:00:40.539> technique<00:00:41.019> for<00:00:41.229> digging<00:00:41.559> the<00:00:41.649> grass<00:00:41.859> out

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:42.100 
a technique for digging the grass out

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.860 
a technique for digging the grass out
and<00:00:42.249> leaving<00:00:42.519> a<00:00:42.579> dirt<00:00:42.789> trail<00:00:43.089> since<00:00:43.629> dirt

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:43.870 
and leaving a dirt trail since dirt

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:45.479 
and leaving a dirt trail since dirt
doesn't<00:00:44.199> catch<00:00:44.319> fire<00:00:44.350> it's<00:00:44.859> a<00:00:44.979> pretty<00:00:45.190> handy

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:45.489 
doesn't catch fire it's a pretty handy

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:47.669 
doesn't catch fire it's a pretty handy
trick<00:00:45.699> for<00:00:45.879> control<00:00:46.389> cutting<00:00:47.170> down<00:00:47.319> trees<00:00:47.469> is

00:00:47.669 --> 00:00:47.679 
trick for control cutting down trees is

00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:49.229 
trick for control cutting down trees is
another<00:00:47.979> method<00:00:48.190> not<00:00:48.489> only<00:00:48.549> does<00:00:48.909> it<00:00:48.940> stop

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:49.239 
another method not only does it stop

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:50.669 
another method not only does it stop
fire<00:00:49.449> from<00:00:49.659> spreading<00:00:49.809> but<00:00:50.260> you<00:00:50.350> can<00:00:50.499> clear

00:00:50.669 --> 00:00:50.679 
fire from spreading but you can clear

00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:52.319 
fire from spreading but you can clear
paths<00:00:50.979> for<00:00:51.219> your<00:00:51.249> vehicles<00:00:51.729> to<00:00:51.850> drive<00:00:52.059> through

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.010 
now of course you have your classes of

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.919 
now of course you have your classes of
fire<00:00:54.190> fighters<00:00:54.579> and<00:00:54.609> vehicles<00:00:55.149> grunts<00:00:55.719> can

point six seven you know it seems a

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.849 
point six seven you know it seems a
little<00:01:44.969> strange<00:01:45.240> but<00:01:45.780> by<00:01:45.899> penalizing<00:01:46.439> you<00:01:46.649> so

00:01:46.849 --> 00:01:46.859 
little strange but by penalizing you so

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:48.649 
little strange but by penalizing you so
severely<00:01:47.280> it's<00:01:47.610> almost<00:01:47.939> like<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.299> game<00:01:48.450> is

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
severely it's almost like the game is
