 talking maybe you lost the thread 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:51.020
 of this news after several 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:54.440
 decades of a judicial process in the year 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:57.500
 2011 two years ago a court of justice 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:00.830
 Ecuador gave a ruling sentenced to 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:03.949
 payment of a million dollar fine against 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:06.830
 of chevron to alleviate all cases 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:08.570
 the environmental damage that caused several 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.420
 indigenous communities in the Amazon 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.070
 Ecuadorian during the years that it operated 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:17.030
 the united states company chevron 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:19.070
 I worked there between 1964 and 1990 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:22.220
 but the sequel was devastating 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:24.229
 environmental justice now in 2011 is 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.390
 more chevron condemned to pay for 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:29.479
 what he did but then came a 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.399
 arbitration court of the beech 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:33.740
 he ordered the opposite told him to 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:36.530
 Ecuador that prevents the execution of the 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:39.380
 judicial ruling issued by a judgment 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:42.020
 national is to say when ecuador also 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.790
 talk about being very careful with those 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.310
 international arbitrations 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.900
 we talk about cases like this in particular 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.990
 justice after a process 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:52.790
 very long had achieved justice for 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.530
 the communities affected by the 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.810
 environmental devastation of the ebro but 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:00.650
 clear they always find twists 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:02.030
 who pay millions in the 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:03.500
 defense now the campaign is against 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.410
 ecuador cristian rooms with us 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.450
 cristian I remember the moment when 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:10.429

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.160
 because he had come to justice 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:17.740
 after decades of process without 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:20.420
 However, the one who has more money spends 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.650
 millionaire figures in campaign and now the 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.340
 discrediting is against all the people 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.340
 Ecuadorian 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:29.420
 greetings for you for the audience good 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:31.910
 as you said and as he said 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.730
 also the defense front of 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:37.040
 affected by the company chevron the 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.890
 company prefers to spend innumerable 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:42.430
 amount of money in discrediting the 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:45.380
 country and evading its responsibility 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.960
 regarding the contamination that there is in 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:50.180
 the one that incurred to pay the defendants 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:52.250
 president rafael belt and has 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.380
 manifested that these attacks that 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:58.360
 they are giving to the country they are going to do 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.950
 assumed with full responsibility and 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.140
 sovereignty and the will to face 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.970
 this is what the president has said 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.070
 rafael strap as you mentioned 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:09.189
 also the company that but here in the 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:13.909
 Ecuador since 1900 

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:15.400
 64 up to 1990 generated an incalculable 

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:18.530
 series of environmental damages 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.840
 especially in damages that are still 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.489
 they give in the health of the settlers who live 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.319
 in the Amazon and that's why the 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:26.840
 front of Amazonian defense has 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:30.170
 undertaken this titanic struggle could be 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:32.689
 say where the national court the 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:36.569
 Provincial Court of Succumbios ruled 

00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:39.540
 that chevron pays the transit 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:41.939
 and also apologize for not doing it 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:44.280
 is his and this figure doubled and now 

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:46.439
 they must cancel 19,000 million 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.510
 dollars which they do not want to do and 

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:51.689
 now this is already managed in an instance 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:54.180
 international in the court of the beech such 

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:56.189
 as you say it court instance 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.349
 international that has also been put 

00:03:56.189 --> 00:04:00.870
 questioned by the government 

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:02.489
 national with respect to flawed interests 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.549
 that are handled not only in these 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:07.799
 but in other international instances 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:09.840
 good now that campaign in the government 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:12.000
 that elected as brutal this campaign is not 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.849
 of loss of prestige but they are also 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.829
 talking about hiring lawyers there 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:20.310
 in the equator 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:22.650
 publicly manifested as 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:24.240
 contrary to any type of change or 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.099
 citizen revolution for example 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.469
 we talk about the newspaper the universe what 

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:30.659
 happen with those links from that right 

00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:33.350
 Ecuadorian with the American 

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:35.960
 petroleum chevron 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:37.520
 well is lourdes good the president 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.890
 rafael strap what you mentioned is 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:42.950
 that has data where they are most used 

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:46.100
 of 400 million dollars financing 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:47.720
 a media campaign against the country 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:50.260
 and in which media are linked 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.260
 communication 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:56.680
 and also with opponents of the government that 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:58.570
 they are working and they have already worked 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.970
 with other oil companies like for example 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:04.480
 with the ocs and providing advice for 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:06.850
 harming the state according to the front of 

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:08.680
 defense of the Amazon what it claims 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:10.570
 the chevron to see itself already lost is 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.490
 link to the Ecuadorian state in a 

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:15.400
 judicial process that would come to be 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:16.930
 independent this legal process that 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:19.960
 has undertaken the defense front and that 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:21.610
 It has been about 20 years of struggle 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:25.150
 process of the settlers of the 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:27.400
 harmed from the front of the people 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.900
 that are on the defense front without 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.280
 However chevron according to them what 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:33.160
 pretend is that the Ecuadorian state 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:35.440
 assume that responsibility and make it the 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:37.600
 Ecuadorian state who pays these 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:40.000
 damages caused by the company 

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:41.890
 oil and for that just as well 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.110
 is making use of people who are 

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:45.490
 opposing the president who 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:48.010
 they are linked to the means of 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:50.050
 communication and that the foot serves them 

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:52.150
 make a media attack not 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:54.580
 only internationally doing 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:56.920
 political lobby but also in a way 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:59.320
 internal systematizing 

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:01.630
 attacks that go against this 

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:03.550

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:09.220
 been the one that pays a pollution 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:11.350
 an environmental devastation of decades of 

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:12.910
 work of the chevron you say you are 

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:13.890

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:16.890
 demand in which they finally won 

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:16.890
