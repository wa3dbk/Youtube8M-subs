00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.370 
version every three or four days but
it's<00:01:15.060> still<00:01:15.240> really<00:01:15.689> nice<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:16.080> have<00:01:16.200> that

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
the code more efficient keep in mind

CyanogenMod<00:02:50.290> is<00:02:50.560> its<00:02:50.919> features<00:02:51.310> and<00:02:51.579> that's

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
CyanogenMod is its features and that's

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.159 
CyanogenMod is its features and that's
kind<00:02:51.970> of<00:02:52.030> what<00:02:52.180> its<00:02:52.299> most<00:02:52.480> notorious<00:02:52.989> for

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:53.169 
kind of what its most notorious for

00:02:53.169 --> 00:02:55.500 
kind of what its most notorious for
anyways<00:02:53.590> so<00:02:54.159> I<00:02:54.489> guess<00:02:54.700> the<00:02:55.060> best<00:02:55.269> place<00:02:55.480> to

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
anyways so I guess the best place to

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.629 
anyways so I guess the best place to
start<00:02:55.870> concerning<00:02:56.500> features<00:02:56.859> is<00:02:57.129> the<00:02:57.459> theme

00:02:57.629 --> 00:02:57.639 
start concerning features is the theme

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:00.240 
start concerning features is the theme
store<00:02:58.030> it's<00:02:58.599> back<00:02:58.900> from<00:02:59.139> CyanogenMod<00:02:59.739> 11<00:03:00.099> and

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
store it's back from CyanogenMod 11 and

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.429 
store it's back from CyanogenMod 11 and
it's<00:03:00.370> pretty<00:03:00.790> awesome<00:03:01.030> right<00:03:01.930> now<00:03:02.079> every

00:03:02.429 --> 00:03:02.439 
it's pretty awesome right now every

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:04.500 
it's pretty awesome right now every
theme<00:03:02.650> only<00:03:02.919> changes<00:03:03.340> the<00:03:03.459> colors<00:03:03.849> associated

with material where before the themes

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:08.339 
with material where before the themes
could<00:03:06.730> change<00:03:06.939> the<00:03:07.150> entire<00:03:07.450> look<00:03:07.510> of<00:03:07.989> the<00:03:08.169> apps

00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:08.349 
could change the entire look of the apps

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:10.619 
could change the entire look of the apps
and<00:03:08.680> the<00:03:08.859> drop-down<00:03:09.219> menus<00:03:09.609> but<00:03:10.150> it's<00:03:10.389> still

and the drop-down menus but it's still

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:12.539 
and the drop-down menus but it's still
in<00:03:10.780> beta<00:03:10.810> and<00:03:11.169> I<00:03:11.409> expect<00:03:11.769> developers<00:03:12.189> to<00:03:12.340> start

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:12.549
