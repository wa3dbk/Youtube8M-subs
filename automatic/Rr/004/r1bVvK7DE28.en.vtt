00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
need to get another one really because

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.390 
need to get another one really because
you<00:01:12.869> had<00:01:13.020> these<00:01:13.170> used<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:14.010> have<00:01:14.100> these<00:01:14.159> little

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
pads on the side which used to make it

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.410 
pads on the side which used to make it
really<00:01:16.710> comfortable<00:01:16.920> for<00:01:17.189> using<00:01:17.640> and<00:01:17.759> they

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
really comfortable for using and they

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.230 
really comfortable for using and they
fell<00:01:18.689> off<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:19.020> glue<00:01:19.200> just<00:01:19.439> sort<00:01:19.590> of<00:01:19.710> I<00:01:20.490> don't

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
fell off the glue just sort of I don't

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.760 
fell off the glue just sort of I don't
know<00:01:21.420> disintegrate<00:01:22.170> and<00:01:22.350> they<00:01:22.409> kept<00:01:22.560> falling

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
know disintegrate and they kept falling

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.910 
know disintegrate and they kept falling
off<00:01:23.040> but<00:01:23.850> yeah<00:01:24.420> it's<00:01:25.080> a<00:01:25.200> good<00:01:25.320> Mouse<00:01:25.500> except

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
off but yeah it's a good Mouse except

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.800 
off but yeah it's a good Mouse except
for<00:01:26.070> that<00:01:26.159> it's<00:01:26.670> few<00:01:26.970> years<00:01:27.210> old<00:01:27.360> now<00:01:27.509> so<00:01:27.540> it

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
for that it's few years old now so it

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.420 
for that it's few years old now so it
probably<00:01:28.110> could<00:01:28.229> do<00:01:28.350> it<00:01:28.439> replacing<00:01:28.860> very

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
probably could do it replacing very

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.100 
probably could do it replacing very

USB<00:01:53.280> so<00:01:54.149> that<00:01:54.329> is<00:01:54.479> a<00:01:54.780> really<00:01:55.200> really<00:01:55.619> nice

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
USB so that is a really really nice

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.280 
USB so that is a really really nice
microphone<00:01:56.340> high<00:01:56.909> quality<00:01:57.360> very<00:01:57.719> expensive

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
microphone high quality very expensive

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.910 
microphone high quality very expensive
and<00:01:58.469> it's<00:01:59.100> in<00:01:59.250> this<00:01:59.399> sort<00:01:59.700> of<00:01:59.820> suspended<00:02:00.920> shock

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
and it's in this sort of suspended shock

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.850 
and it's in this sort of suspended shock
mount<00:02:02.159> which<00:02:02.430> stops<00:02:03.420> any<00:02:03.649> vibration<00:02:04.649> off<00:02:04.740> the

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
mount which stops any vibration off the

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:05.990 
mount which stops any vibration off the
desk<00:02:05.070> if<00:02:05.219> I<00:02:05.280> hit<00:02:05.430> the<00:02:05.520> desk<00:02:05.670> for<00:02:05.880> whatever

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
desk if I hit the desk for whatever

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.510 
desk if I hit the desk for whatever
reason<00:02:06.390> or<00:02:07.290> just<00:02:07.469> nudge<00:02:07.649> it<00:02:07.860> then<00:02:08.280> it<00:02:08.489> should

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
reason or just nudge it then it should

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.210 
reason or just nudge it then it should
absorb<00:02:09.179> any<00:02:09.479> shock<00:02:09.750> and<00:02:09.989> that<00:02:10.039> obviously<00:02:11.039> runs

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
absorb any shock and that obviously runs

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.090 
absorb any shock and that obviously runs
straight<00:02:11.819> down<00:02:12.000> the<00:02:12.090> back<00:02:12.379> down<00:02:13.379> underneath

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
straight down the back down underneath

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.800 
straight down the back down underneath
to<00:02:14.220> my<00:02:14.430> computer<00:02:14.970> which<00:02:15.090> is<00:02:15.210> just<00:02:15.360> here<00:02:15.570> and

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
to my computer which is just here and

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.100 
to my computer which is just here and
this<00:02:16.020> actually<00:02:16.530> moves<00:02:16.790> all<00:02:17.790> the<00:02:17.850> way<00:02:18.180> from

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
this actually moves all the way from

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.650 
this actually moves all the way from
each<00:02:19.200> side<00:02:19.470> up<00:02:20.100> and<00:02:20.280> down<00:02:20.370> so<00:02:21.210> I<00:02:21.240> can<00:02:21.390> put<00:02:21.570> it

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
each side up and down so I can put it

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.050 
each side up and down so I can put it
wherever<00:02:21.810> I<00:02:21.960> want<00:02:22.190> as<00:02:23.190> close<00:02:23.460> to<00:02:23.610> me<00:02:23.700> as<00:02:23.790> I<00:02:23.880> want

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
wherever I want as close to me as I want

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.570 
wherever I want as close to me as I want
or<00:02:24.210> as<00:02:24.300> far<00:02:24.510> as<00:02:24.630> away<00:02:24.810> as<00:02:25.140> I<00:02:25.620> want<00:02:25.830> it<00:02:26.040> to<00:02:26.190> so

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
or as far as away as I want it to so

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.420 
or as far as away as I want it to so
yeah<00:02:26.820> very<00:02:27.000> nice<00:02:27.330> I<00:02:28.130> don't<00:02:29.130> know<00:02:29.190> what<00:02:29.310> I<00:02:29.340> do

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
yeah very nice I don't know what I do

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.340 
yeah very nice I don't know what I do
that<00:02:29.700> I<00:02:29.730> really<00:02:30.090> because<00:02:30.360> otherwise<00:02:31.050> it'd<00:02:31.260> be

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
that I really because otherwise it'd be

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.740 
that I really because otherwise it'd be
on<00:02:31.470> this<00:02:31.590> little<00:02:31.740> desk<00:02:32.070> microphones<00:02:32.790> and<00:02:33.060> it

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
on this little desk microphones and it

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.030 
on this little desk microphones and it
always<00:02:33.930> beginning<00:02:34.290> the<00:02:34.410> way<00:02:34.560> so<00:02:34.620> that's<00:02:34.860> very

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
always beginning the way so that's very

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.100 
always beginning the way so that's very
handy<00:02:35.250> now<00:02:35.970> you<00:02:36.420> may<00:02:36.540> be<00:02:36.570> wondering<00:02:36.930> what<00:02:36.990> this

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
handy now you may be wondering what this

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.510 
handy now you may be wondering what this
whiteboard<00:02:37.620> is<00:02:38.130> around<00:02:39.000> my<00:02:39.930> steering<00:02:40.350> wheel

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:40.520 
whiteboard is around my steering wheel

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.640 
whiteboard is around my steering wheel
basically<00:02:41.520> because<00:02:42.210> my<00:02:42.480> desk<00:02:43.020> here<00:02:43.260> is<00:02:43.440> like

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
basically because my desk here is like

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.890 
basically because my desk here is like
it's<00:02:44.250> got<00:02:44.430> this<00:02:44.550> curve<00:02:45.390> on<00:02:45.630> it

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
it's got this curve on it

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.660 
it's got this curve on it
I<00:02:45.930> can't<00:02:46.830> attach<00:02:47.100> the<00:02:47.280> steering<00:02:47.550> wheel

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
I can't attach the steering wheel

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.730 
I can't attach the steering wheel
without<00:02:47.790> it<00:02:48.030> falling<00:02:48.270> off<00:02:48.480> so<00:02:49.320> I<00:02:49.350> have<00:02:49.500> to<00:02:49.590> put

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
without it falling off so I have to put

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.410 
without it falling off so I have to put
that<00:02:49.860> on<00:02:49.920> there<00:02:50.130> to<00:02:50.310> just<00:02:50.490> sort<00:02:50.610> of<00:02:50.700> make<00:02:50.880> it<00:02:51.060> a

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
that on there to just sort of make it a

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.480 
that on there to just sort of make it a
90<00:02:51.960> degree<00:02:52.230> angle<00:02:52.910> rather<00:02:53.910> than<00:02:54.210> this<00:02:54.690> curve

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:55.490 
90 degree angle rather than this curve

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:57.890 
90 degree angle rather than this curve
stops<00:02:56.490> it<00:02:56.640> from<00:02:56.760> falling<00:02:56.940> off<00:02:57.180> so<00:02:57.480> that<00:02:57.660> is<00:02:57.780> the

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
stops it from falling off so that is the

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.750 
stops it from falling off so that is the
only<00:02:58.020> reason<00:02:58.290> for<00:02:58.440> that<00:02:58.680> so<00:02:59.370> I<00:02:59.430> just<00:02:59.580> quickly

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
only reason for that so I just quickly

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.040 
only reason for that so I just quickly
turn<00:03:00.060> the<00:03:00.150> lights<00:03:00.300> off<00:03:00.450> just<00:03:00.510> so<00:03:00.750> you<00:03:00.780> can<00:03:00.900> see

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
turn the lights off just so you can see

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.710 
turn the lights off just so you can see
the<00:03:01.140> case<00:03:01.320> in<00:03:01.470> the<00:03:01.560> dark<00:03:01.910> clearly<00:03:02.910> quite<00:03:03.660> a

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
the case in the dark clearly quite a

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.410 
the case in the dark clearly quite a
green<00:03:03.960> case<00:03:04.340> I<00:03:05.340> think<00:03:05.820> this<00:03:05.910> is<00:03:06.000> pretty<00:03:06.240> much<00:03:06.330> a

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
green case I think this is pretty much a

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.800 
green case I think this is pretty much a
budget<00:03:06.870> PC<00:03:07.350> gaming<00:03:07.620> case<00:03:08.010> I<00:03:08.540> would<00:03:09.540> like<00:03:09.570> to

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
budget PC gaming case I would like to

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.630 
budget PC gaming case I would like to
change<00:03:09.930> it<00:03:10.080> at<00:03:10.170> some<00:03:10.320> point<00:03:10.370> now<00:03:11.370> I've<00:03:11.490> also

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
change it at some point now I've also

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.930 
change it at some point now I've also
got<00:03:11.910> this<00:03:12.150> arrow<00:03:12.420> call<00:03:12.900> touch<00:03:13.410> 2000<00:03:14.160> and<00:03:14.340> it's

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
got this arrow call touch 2000 and it's

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.880 
got this arrow call touch 2000 and it's
basically<00:03:15.300> like<00:03:15.510> a<00:03:15.570> control<00:03:16.140> center<00:03:16.560> for<00:03:16.590> all

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
basically like a control center for all

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.850 
basically like a control center for all
of<00:03:17.040> the<00:03:17.130> cooling<00:03:17.490> fans<00:03:17.700> built<00:03:17.970> into<00:03:18.240> the<00:03:18.360> case

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
of the cooling fans built into the case

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.190 
of the cooling fans built into the case
so<00:03:19.860> you<00:03:19.920> can<00:03:20.100> click<00:03:20.610> on<00:03:20.730> each<00:03:20.820> one<00:03:20.850> it's<00:03:21.450> only<00:03:21.660> 3

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
so you can click on each one it's only 3

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:22.790 
so you can click on each one it's only 3

or<00:03:39.390> a<00:03:40.080> very<00:03:40.560> CPU<00:03:41.400> intensive<00:03:41.520> game<00:03:42.410> then<00:03:43.410> I<00:03:43.530> can

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:43.770 
or a very CPU intensive game then I can

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:45.320 
or a very CPU intensive game then I can
increase<00:03:43.980> the<00:03:44.280> speed<00:03:44.490> of<00:03:44.640> those<00:03:44.760> case<00:03:45.060> fans

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
increase the speed of those case fans

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.270 
increase the speed of those case fans
just<00:03:45.600> to<00:03:45.750> clear<00:03:46.440> the<00:03:46.560> system<00:03:46.860> through<00:03:47.010> and

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
just to clear the system through and

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.740 
just to clear the system through and
cool<00:03:48.210> it<00:03:48.330> down<00:03:48.450> a<00:03:48.510> bit

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:04.880 
a game which requires a steering wheel

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.249 
a game which requires a steering wheel
so<00:05:05.880> you<00:05:05.940> can<00:05:06.060> have<00:05:06.150> these<00:05:06.330> as<00:05:06.389> hiring<00:05:06.990> and

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:19.410 
so that can be all programmable and

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:22.370 
so that can be all programmable and
