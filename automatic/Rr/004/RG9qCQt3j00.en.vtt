00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.910
 moin moin and hello I'm the akg and 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.910
 would like to bid you welcome 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.559
 to my very first let's play and in 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.940
 i want this very first let's play 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.889
 you play the beautiful 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.889
 introduce mechwarrior online 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.730
 it is still in the 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.680
 closed beta and the ndr was canceled 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.800
 which allows me this beautiful 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.949
 can make video and big can 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:35.579
 It is said to be very similar to tanks 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:37.110
 then play free to play and like that 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.250
 name in principle says plays 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:43.140
 huge max fighting robot alike 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.420
 the match begins I'll explain that for short 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.610
 interface 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:50.940
 There we have our own downstairs 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:53.640
 First of all, our cockpit here 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.739
 by the way and on the left and see the screen 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.989
 we have our own mac and its 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.920
 plating 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:00.510
 when we get up later in the game 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.370
 you will still see 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.650
 which is negotiating yellow orange red 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.330
 and nothing there where the power of 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.900
 jenna ran so that's my left 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:13.850
 leg now thank you very much money 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:17.080
 in the middle we have a minimap 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:20.390
 the speed indicator and right 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:23.750
 I would like to have the management 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:26.930
 say the hit indicator which indicates how 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:31.149
 many civilian currently quasi on our 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:33.289
 account have slash produce 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:38.360
 right in the picture we see ours 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:40.610
 Armament divided into the calculation 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:46.550
 with the circle and the crosshairs as you like 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:48.080
 also in the middle of the weapons in the 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:51.200
 group with the circular and its weapons 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:57.770
 installed low-weapons are in the crosshairs 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:59.750
 are consumed in the house and pay 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.830
 the same hotfix you can use these weapons 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.450
 Group and different weapons 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.310
 group together because all at once 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.330
 Departing would make little sense and he 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:10.160
 is overheating very quickly 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:12.010
 In that case, a catapult tax 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:17.000
 is a heavy me and have on board 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:18.980
 two long hauls four medium hauls 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.030
 laser 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.030
 [Music] 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.129
 I'm trying here now 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.040
 to target a bit of a few targeted 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:35.319
 So my case with long-range missiles 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:38.900
 I am very dependent on scouts 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:40.189
 crime and I deliver goals in that 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.430
 case it does not work right now 

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:42.430
 so good 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:51.650
 okay as our passion attacked 

00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:54.459
 I will be back and 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.459
 look what's going on there 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.320
 otherwise you have to say it 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.690
 offers many possibilities the mac 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:08.320
 to configure what I like very much 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.760
 everybody finds it interesting 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.020
 certain options on weapons you 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.890
 you can install the armor 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.890
 decrease or increase 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.090
 you can increase the heat exchangers and 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.800
 decrease depending on which weapons you use 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.190
 just a bread makes sense or less 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.470
 sense 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:31.460
 I thought it would be a victory 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:34.910
 Of course the basis for the real 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:38.300
 configuration I say yes later the mum 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:41.330
 we again something there is also one 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:45.790
 what you can and must explain 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:48.320
 also should one with it at all 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:50.920
 playable max does not have that immediately 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.920
 overheat 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:56.079
 or stop at enemy contact pretty straightforward 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:56.079
 burst 

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:06.489
 at least we managed to do that now 

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:06.489
 is and says to expel here 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.760
 then I went back to the 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:15.740
 looking for long-range missile target 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.740
 this again other tech okay 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:40.320
 that's the singer back 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:43.380
 I say I should go to the wall here 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.380
 [Music] 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:52.500
 the skin 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:06.210
 Yes 

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:18.030
 ok as you can see here very nice 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:19.400
 is that the light next heavy 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:22.990
 indeed 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.990
 maneuver out very quickly 

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:37.870
 and help one sees also that one now 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:40.800
 in fact the rear a little bit 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:40.800
 has battered 

00:06:22.279 --> 00:06:26.399
 I'm just wondering 

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:29.149
 why I win as one which 

00:06:26.399 --> 00:06:29.149
 defended 

00:06:32.419 --> 00:06:35.689
 players believe the 

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:40.329
 [Music] 

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:47.220
 That's it 

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:51.360
 [Music] 

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:57.520
 Here we see in the case that we 

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:59.410
 lost and how much so 

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:01.030
 ingame money earned neat 

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:03.160
 much experience has warred 

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:05.260
 what better way for our pilot 

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:07.360
 can where boni then gives it up 

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:10.180
 certain attributes and in the end effect 

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:12.820
 our magazines are improving because of us 

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:17.100
 for example, move faster faster 

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:17.100
 can turn etc
