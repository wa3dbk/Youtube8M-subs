00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:16.689
 Andrade speaks there people create and bring 

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:20.619
 you more gameplay 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:24.369
 this time the game plex ai 2 what is free 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:26.080
 to play steam totally for free and it's 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:30.160
 the same producer of the same 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:32.529
 dsi developer and online universe 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:35.860
 until the charging screen is 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:37.390
 same style is one and same time 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.699
 that for you today just to have you 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.890
 an idea within how the game is because 

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:44.260
 The game is great because we want to 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.600
 download our to you how 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:50.289
 It works more or less what I understood 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:52.840
 it's a bit complicated has a curve 

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:56.829
 learning in quite large 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:58.960
 the maps are very large then requires 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:02.679
 there a little patience of the player is 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:06.250
 arriving the first time but I think 

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:10.030
 that it will be worth you to play it is a 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:12.790
 mm or is a schutter but is a mmo is a 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:16.000
 first-person shooter game and much 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.710
 open and very very big, I 'm 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.299
 recording that now the entire ramp 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.670
 playing live because I had a 

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:26.650
 problem to write this video 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:29.229
 I recorded it with the functionality that 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:31.869
 There is a game you can do live. 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:37.360
 free streaming tv or can record 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:40.270
 and then chat youtube to your gameplay 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:43.000
 so this greatly facilitates the group 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.979
 It's very cool, I 'm playing here 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.560
 and I'm going to show you the 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:50.380
 map was on the map and appears to be small 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.570
 not even though I 've walked a lot more 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:56.259
 Let's go to you, that's not all. 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:59.289
 size of this map that happens in this 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:00.670
 game there are three factions not disputing 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:04.030
 a planet 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:06.340
 the purple blue and the pumpkin color do not remember 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.470
 Now what are the names of these factions? 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:12.340
 but each one is one each with its own 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.569
 characteristics and then you have to 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.209
 win 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:18.040
 Everyone is watching there. 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:21.129
 territory has a color you have to 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:23.200
 conquer then it's rolling it's shot it's 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:26.290
 rolling with part and all these 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.989
 territories and are flashing and where 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:33.159
 is deploy is where I can is to give a 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:35.469
 where we can be there or 

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:39.659
 Where is someone from our team? 

00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:42.700
 or the leader our team played unb with 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:45.069
 responds or where they built 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:48.669
 structures called surrender some 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:52.120
 That's the way to go. 

00:02:48.669 --> 00:02:55.030
 also the squad leader can play a 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:57.280
 every five minutes 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:00.400
 and then the problem is easier, I found 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.359
 is in the game is a communication club with 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.819
 this picture 

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:06.340
 the game was made to be quite is 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:08.680
 I spoke quite a lot because 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.109
 depends on strategy is to 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.629
 because otherwise it gets complicated 

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:17.230
 so I 'll show you here it is 

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:23.790
 I will give a plastic and then 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:27.750
 in that revertec that is rolling then a 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:30.819
 fight there and how he is one is better 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:33.220
 You come into the game and I'm not 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:34.750
 probably because the guy put 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.319
 a bunny just did not have a structure 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:40.509
 physics had no building 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:43.449
 and we are taking can be 

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:46.060
 can not is not rolling a fight nor 

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:50.019
 we are taking this area and 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.409
 difficult and the structures are very 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:54.790
 big ones 

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:56.939
 the text does not say but I think it depends 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:59.680
 much of the team's communication to a 

00:03:56.939 --> 00:04:02.919
 someone in this picture is too far from 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:05.349
 Suddenly so fighting in a place full of 

00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:07.000
 people we can take and have someone 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:08.650
 walking on the other corner of the map. 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.939
 combat is lost practically né 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:14.739
 So , how do you say it's better then always? 

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:17.320
 You enter the game the combat is 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:19.509
 rolling thalamus world is not going away you 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:23.380
 chooses a world map in fact a 

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:24.849
 server and then he plays you not every time 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.530
 You enter you back on this map. 

00:04:24.849 --> 00:04:29.170
 within your team 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.850
 and is progressing ne and will help our 

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:33.180
 team to take a day defending their 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:36.790
 part of the world I'm going to show you 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:38.889
 is where showing that actually how much 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:41.260
 on randon we took that basis she 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:42.700
 turned it turned red and now I'm going to 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:46.870
 another place 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:50.410
 and then he gives it to me and it's a response to time 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:54.990
 is in the corner is left below there is a 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:57.910
 The time that I have but someone killed me 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:05:00.730
 ugly, and then I will not be able to get in 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:02.440
 will give the condom again to be able to be 

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:11.470
 released there but will not give'll have 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:13.540
 that in the window but the game has got 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:16.060
 potential to be a good match 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:17.620
 he is with some bugs you will see there 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:21.460
 I had an aggravated problem because of 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:25.060
 of this bug he caught a screen in it 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:27.850
 weird but I think if you have 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:29.710
 a team and I think in the future these 

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:32.110
 things start smoking alone 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:34.419
 people will create teams and will stay 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:37.900
 the most organized thing in this sense and 

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:39.690
 more strategic and will stay cool 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:43.060
 and then you can upgrade your 

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:45.820
 class are those things all play and 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:48.460
 better cold, you can buy 

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:51.910
 the dots to buy new things and 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:53.220
 and customizing your character your weapon and 

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:56.160
 etc 

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:59.350
 but then I think I can not 

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:01.960
 kill anyone in this game play but it's not 

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:05.289
 this was the was no such intention 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:09.070
 The intention was to show you only the 

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:11.680
 game objective for what you go there 

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:14.919
 under the extinction of address and another 

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:17.620
 Thing this game has vehicles have three 

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:22.690
 aircraft for each faction an expensive sun 

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:26.590
 of the faction can pilot and 37 32 tanks 

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:28.990
 something like that with a little airplane 

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:32.919
 aerial battle has even tank and 

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:36.010
 depending on each map of each region and 

00:06:32.919 --> 00:06:37.990
 I think five or six classes of the 

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:40.070
 different soldier each responsible 

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:43.350
 for practically one thing 

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:45.870
 this is a generator you have to fix this 

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:47.550
 to repair the base shell that are 

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:50.820
 trying to drink né 

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:53.729
 I am an engineer has a corzinha 40 in 

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:57.270
 front fail and gun diogo 

00:06:53.729 --> 00:06:58.650
 but in the tower, but that's what I do not 

00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:00.570
 It's just for you, this is going to be a problem. 

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:03.750
 You'll see soon enough. 

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:06.449
 so I wanted to thank you if you saw 

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:08.220
 until now and then you leave your 

00:07:06.449 --> 00:07:09.930
 Favorite book if you liked the video. 

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:11.850
 is not subscribed to register the channel is 

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:14.460
 Do you want more gameplay of plants you know? 

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:16.979
 2000 and I said I swallow that for people 

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:19.560
 and if you want to play you also say that 

00:07:16.979 --> 00:07:23.130
 people play together then people i 

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:26.250
