it's easy to use and offers a safe

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:35.770 
it's easy to use and offers a safe

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:35.780 
method of access when working at high

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.290 
method of access when working at high
low<00:04:36.710> way<00:04:36.919> and<00:04:37.160> a<00:04:37.190> powerful<00:04:37.430> four-wheel<00:04:38.000> drive

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:38.300 
low way and a powerful four-wheel drive

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.150 
low way and a powerful four-wheel drive
system<00:04:38.690> added<00:04:39.169> to<00:04:39.260> the<00:04:39.350> already<00:04:39.500> versatile

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 
system added to the already versatile

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.040 
system added to the already versatile
height<00:04:40.400> right<00:04:40.580> at<00:04:40.700> 12<00:04:40.910> chassis<00:04:41.360> makes<00:04:41.810> this

height right at 12 chassis makes this

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:43.840 
height right at 12 chassis makes this
one<00:04:42.260> of<00:04:42.290> the<00:04:42.410> most<00:04:42.560> complete<00:04:42.919> machines<00:04:43.430> in<00:04:43.669> its

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:43.850 
one of the most complete machines in its
