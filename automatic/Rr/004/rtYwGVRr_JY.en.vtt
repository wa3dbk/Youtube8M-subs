00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.330 
of that foot sound so don't think
professional<00:02:30.030> professional<00:02:30.960> p<00:02:31.290> I<00:02:31.560> really

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
professional professional p I really

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.510 
professional professional p I really
think<00:02:32.520> that's<00:02:32.760> kind<00:02:33.030> of<00:02:33.060> what<00:02:33.210> the<00:02:33.330> dial<00:02:33.540> means

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
think that's kind of what the dial means

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.010 
think that's kind of what the dial means
other<00:02:35.520> people<00:02:35.880> say<00:02:36.030> its<00:02:36.180> program<00:02:36.600> I<00:02:36.780> think

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
other people say its program I think

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.330 
other people say its program I think
it's<00:02:37.110> for<00:02:37.260> professional<00:02:37.770> because<00:02:37.950> you<00:02:38.160> just

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
it's for professional because you just

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.570 
it's for professional because you just
have<00:02:38.490> to<00:02:38.640> turn<00:02:38.820> it<00:02:39.030> and<00:02:39.210> the<00:02:39.990> camera<00:02:40.500> looks<00:02:41.400> at

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
have to turn it and the camera looks at

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.000 
have to turn it and the camera looks at
everything<00:02:41.790> you're<00:02:42.060> photographing<00:02:42.270> and<00:02:43.010> come

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
everything you're photographing and come

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.990 
everything you're photographing and come
it<00:02:44.370> makes<00:02:45.210> the<00:02:45.510> decision<00:02:45.990> for<00:02:46.260> you<00:02:46.440> and<00:02:46.830> so<00:02:47.760> it

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
it makes the decision for you and so it

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.520 
it makes the decision for you and so it
will<00:02:48.470> expose<00:02:49.520> how<00:02:50.520> it<00:02:50.730> sees<00:02:51.000> fit<00:02:51.030> so<00:02:51.570> I<00:02:51.810> mean

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
will expose how it sees fit so I mean

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.980 
will expose how it sees fit so I mean
you<00:02:52.680> could<00:02:52.830> spend<00:02:53.160> a<00:02:53.430> lot<00:02:53.670> of<00:02:53.700> time<00:02:53.850> going<00:02:54.600> over

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
you could spend a lot of time going over

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:58.820 
you could spend a lot of time going over
things<00:02:55.890> like<00:02:56.130> light<00:02:56.940> exposure<00:02:57.510> but<00:02:58.440> I<00:02:58.650> don't

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
things like light exposure but I don't

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.040 
things like light exposure but I don't
really<00:02:59.010> think<00:02:59.250> it's<00:02:59.430> necessary<00:02:59.870> let<00:03:00.870> the

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
really think it's necessary let the

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:04.190 
really think it's necessary let the
camera<00:03:01.500> do<00:03:01.830> the<00:03:01.860> work<00:03:02.190> for<00:03:02.220> you<00:03:03.000> and<00:03:03.390> you'll<00:03:04.020> be

trying to do is render everything at an
18-percent<00:05:29.310> gray<00:05:29.820> it's<00:05:30.420> smart<00:05:31.320> but<00:05:31.770> it's<00:05:31.950> not

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:32.130 
18-percent gray it's smart but it's not

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:34.520 
18-percent gray it's smart but it's not
that<00:05:32.400> smart<00:05:32.700> so<00:05:33.300> what<00:05:33.480> it's<00:05:33.630> doing<00:05:33.990> is<00:05:34.200> saying

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:34.530 
that smart so what it's doing is saying

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:35.840 
that smart so what it's doing is saying
there's<00:05:34.830> not<00:05:34.980> enough<00:05:35.250> light<00:05:35.430> in<00:05:35.490> this<00:05:35.730> room

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:35.850 
there's not enough light in this room

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:37.640

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:46.530 
flat light with a high f-stop so there's

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:49.220 
flat light with a high f-stop so there's
no<00:05:46.710> depth<00:05:47.010> of<00:05:47.160> field<00:05:47.400> whatsoever<00:05:48.030> now<00:05:48.750> me

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:51.240 
knowing what kind of lighting we're

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.870 
knowing what kind of lighting we're
dealing<00:05:51.600> with<00:05:51.770> dropped<00:05:52.770> the<00:05:53.010> f-stop<00:05:53.460> dropped

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:53.880 
dealing with dropped the f-stop dropped

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:56.090 
dealing with dropped the f-stop dropped
the<00:05:54.180> shutter<00:05:54.450> speed<00:05:54.780> and<00:05:55.020> used<00:05:55.260> the<00:05:55.560> natural

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:56.100 
the shutter speed and used the natural

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.070 
the shutter speed and used the natural
light<00:05:56.250> we've<00:05:56.460> got<00:05:56.640> this<00:05:56.790> window<00:05:57.180> up<00:05:57.360> here<00:05:57.660> that

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 
light we've got this window up here that

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.750 
light we've got this window up here that
has<00:05:58.260> nice<00:05:58.530> diffused<00:05:59.010> light<00:05:59.340> coming<00:05:59.730> through

00:05:59.750 --> 00:05:59.760 
has nice diffused light coming through

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:02.870 
has nice diffused light coming through
so<00:06:00.630> I<00:06:00.660> drop<00:06:01.080> those<00:06:01.350> down<00:06:01.620> and<00:06:01.920> drop<00:06:02.310> the<00:06:02.430> ISO

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:02.880 
so I drop those down and drop the ISO

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.790 
so I drop those down and drop the ISO
down<00:06:03.120> so<00:06:03.390> that<00:06:03.420> we<00:06:03.660> could<00:06:03.810> get<00:06:03.990> a<00:06:04.050> nice<00:06:04.410> clean
