00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:51.630 
air well anyway so now once we get to

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:53.390 
air well anyway so now once we get to
this<00:05:51.810> point<00:05:52.020> what<00:05:52.860> we're<00:05:53.010> going<00:05:53.100> to<00:05:53.190> do<00:05:53.280> is

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:53.400
