00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:05.160
 Tell me, guys, what 's the name of Brazil? My name is. 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:06.810
 is serginho here is the channel of 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.880
 university that the penalty was already 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.440
 longing to record video for you already do 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.300
 about a month when I recorded 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.679
 No video but now I'm back in 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.020
 summary we have several in october comes 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.420
 making videos with the tag 50 facts about 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.890
 me and not about me but about them but 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.140
 much more interesting than my 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.510
 Little life is university life so without 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.400
 we'll go to the 50's later on the 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.689
 college we separated first fact 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.519
 that college is not like us 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.439
 imagined before entering the truth 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.000
 go easy is difficult to go out and you will 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.590
 discovering that you do the same is the 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.180
 compared to what you will suffer in the 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.649
 such as trotting 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.940
 some people receive others no more 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.950
 this does not matter because the 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.600
 college itself is already a trot this 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.129
 because it's no use if you are 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.780
 smart or good grades . 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.039
 high school one hour or another you go 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.230
 take a bad note and you will find 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.620
 also that sometimes 15 is not a note 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.940
 bad 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.370
 You'll actually take notes with this. 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.719
 in fact as 21 and sometimes 0 and in these 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.219
 hours you will feel like an ass that 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.719
 wondering if you choose the 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.520
 course until the time comes for you to 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.350
 Do you think about giving up on switching to the top? 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.329
 but you find out that the other courses 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.949
 people also get bad grades 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.229
 because your note does not only depend on 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.400
 You, but several things like 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.680
 example of your colleagues 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.330
 there are good colleagues in bad fellow 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.040
 good colleagues saw great friends who 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.390
 Do you live incredible stories with them? 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.520
 but it's good that the stories died 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.170
 between you and sometimes even already 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.180
 Being in college you and your friends 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.860
 will do some children's things like 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.820
 play little plane you will instead 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.680
 to discover that only one faculty 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.470
 hard school book extension sometimes 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.909
 You'll even write in reviewing. 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.799
 Bad news of bad colleagues 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.329
 who often say they want to help 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.400
 the class but in fact they want 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.020
 help themselves and will always have 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.579
 those boring who will vote against 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.200
 things like for example to change the 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.939
 work date college work 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.320
 really live up to the name because 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.180
 some jobs are laborious 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.380
 a lot of work unless you copy and 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.630
 Everyone has already bought a 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.280
 college tell me about it at work 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.990
 because you will discover 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.460
 what work in a group means work 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.990
 individual and if you do not want to 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.310
 You'll have to do the part of the game. 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.290
 but as I said this the new one does not 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.880
 it only depends on you, your note depends 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.950
 also of what happened the week before 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.689
 of proof and another factual fact is that 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.310
 in the test week everything contributes to 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.810
 that you do not studio if your computer 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.670
 have to break it will break in 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.410
 test week things end in 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.110
 test week 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:15.830
 I finish the coffee, the desire to 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:17.870
 study maternal grandmother's name and 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.550
 show the party the best parts 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.260
 happens on the test week when you 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.970
 You can not go but when you have no proof and 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.410
 You can go for money, the 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.360
 money ends because in college you 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.460
 spend a lot more with xerox because you 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.110
 I would like and what you imagined 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.160
 possible to spend on it but it's not just 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.810
 That's why you spend your money. 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.100
 You discover that in college the food 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.600
 sometimes it has gold price and in most 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.670
 of times the food in college is not 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.620
 Good and do not starve yourself. 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.540
 have to cook and in those hours you will 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.950
 to miss the mother you see a 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.540
 specialist in fast 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.890
 today that today will be the best 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.020
 thing in the world you will realize that 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.460
 little things a college makes 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.630
 difference such as finding 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:52.730
 money in your pocket 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.590
 even if it's 10 cents to face 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.240
 make them the difference so let's go ten 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.500
 minutes of sleep also make the difference 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:00.860
 because during college you go 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.330
 sleep very very little and very well ill 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.400
 that means you 're going to sleep 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.530
 too much sleep and sometimes you go to sleep 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.140
 during class and lose some of the material 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.730
 but do not worry losing is part of the 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.530
 university life whether you want it or not 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.910
 someday you will miss the call to the 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.290
 Rubber chair will always lose 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:17.030
 studying not to fall on the test will 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.500
 miss the bus and sometimes by a tenth 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.120
 second to find that a tenth 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.980
 can be the difference between heaven and 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.870
 hell especially if it's a tenth 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.000
 in your note and as I said in your note 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:29.330
 does not only depend on you but also on 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.430
 teachers but we have already reached number 51 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:32.150
 last fact is that teachers are so 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.770
 special 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.440
 so we want for ours that they 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:37.100
 deserve a video and a list only for 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.780
 they 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.400
 then wait for the next videos and 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.410
 steps of teachers if you want 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.810
 contribute leave your comment below 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.400
 If you liked this video, you should be there. 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.660
 which is very important to me on the channel 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.290
 to know if you are liking or 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.000
 of course not 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:51.620
 and also share with your friends the 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.170
 college also their colleagues and 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:58.630
 Also the teachers there that hug 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:58.630
 until the next video we'll see such
