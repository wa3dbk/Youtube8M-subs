00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
variety to do blocks and I came across

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.280 
variety to do blocks and I came across
this<00:03:01.230> it's<00:03:01.980> just<00:03:02.220> an<00:03:02.370> empty<00:03:02.700> room<00:03:02.879> I<00:03:03.150> was<00:03:03.870> kind

this it's just an empty room I was kind
of<00:03:04.349> hoping<00:03:06.620> this<00:03:07.620> was<00:03:07.799> gonna<00:03:07.950> be<00:03:08.190> done<00:03:08.430> because

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
of hoping this was gonna be done because

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.110 
of hoping this was gonna be done because
this<00:03:08.849> is<00:03:09.000> the<00:03:09.150> biggest<00:03:09.420> room<00:03:10.640> or<00:03:11.640> the<00:03:11.790> biggest

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
this is the biggest room or the biggest

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.240 
this is the biggest room or the biggest
interiors<00:03:12.540> that<00:03:12.569> could<00:03:12.930> have<00:03:13.049> been<00:03:13.260> done<00:03:13.530> but

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
interiors that could have been done but

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:15.710 
interiors that could have been done but
the<00:03:14.370> rest<00:03:14.579> of<00:03:14.730> the<00:03:14.819> interiors<00:03:15.239> are<00:03:15.329> done<00:03:15.540> which

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
the rest of the interiors are done which

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.599 
the rest of the interiors are done which
is<00:03:15.900> kind<00:03:16.379> of<00:03:16.410> weird<00:03:16.620> that<00:03:16.829> he<00:03:17.069> missed<00:03:17.280> out<00:03:17.430> the

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:17.609 
is kind of weird that he missed out the

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:19.610 
is kind of weird that he missed out the
biggest<00:03:17.790> one<00:03:18.060> which<00:03:18.780> I<00:03:18.959> would<00:03:19.079> assume<00:03:19.440> would

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
biggest one which I would assume would

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.740 
biggest one which I would assume would
be<00:03:19.680> that<00:03:19.950> big<00:03:20.190> not<00:03:21.120> the<00:03:21.209> biggest<00:03:21.510> but<00:03:21.660> the

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
be that big not the biggest but the

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.000 
be that big not the biggest but the
easiest<00:03:23.420> same<00:03:24.420> with<00:03:24.660> this<00:03:24.840> one<00:03:24.900> it's<00:03:25.470> somewhat

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
easiest same with this one it's somewhat

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.229 
easiest same with this one it's somewhat
empty<00:03:27.500> let<00:03:28.500> me<00:03:28.590> just<00:03:28.829> go<00:03:29.010> back<00:03:29.040> downstairs<00:03:29.970> and

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
empty let me just go back downstairs and

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:33.830 
empty let me just go back downstairs and
I<00:03:30.359> can<00:03:30.540> show<00:03:30.750> you<00:03:31.129> the<00:03:32.129> little<00:03:32.370> mine<00:03:32.940> that<00:03:33.599> he

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
I can show you the little mine that he

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:39.259 
I can show you the little mine that he
has<00:03:34.459> or<00:03:35.459> she<00:03:36.090> I<00:03:36.329> don't<00:03:36.930> know<00:03:37.730> but<00:03:38.730> since<00:03:38.910> it's<00:03:39.180> a

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
has or she I don't know but since it's a

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:42.860 
has or she I don't know but since it's a
king<00:03:39.540> I'm<00:03:39.720> assuming<00:03:40.200> so<00:03:40.500> he<00:03:41.060> so<00:03:42.060> I<00:03:42.419> don't<00:03:42.690> think

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
king I'm assuming so he so I don't think

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.050 
king I'm assuming so he so I don't think
there's<00:03:43.019> a<00:03:43.109> real<00:03:43.530> path<00:03:43.919> going<00:03:44.489> to<00:03:44.639> this<00:03:44.760> but

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
there's a real path going to this but

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.400 
there's a real path going to this but
basically<00:03:45.209> here<00:03:45.750> you've<00:03:45.930> got<00:03:46.109> like<00:03:46.139> a<00:03:46.290> little

somewhat<00:04:19.560> original<00:04:20.160> so<00:04:20.820> you've<00:04:20.940> got<00:04:21.120> little

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:21.389 
somewhat original so you've got little

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:24.710 
somewhat original so you've got little
water<00:04:21.780> wheel<00:04:22.169> here<00:04:22.770> for<00:04:23.099> the<00:04:23.190> crops

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
water wheel here for the crops

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.219 
water wheel here for the crops
is<00:04:25.410> there<00:04:25.680> anything<00:04:25.860> through<00:04:26.370> here<00:04:26.580> no

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
doesn't seem like it and there is a

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.890 
doesn't seem like it and there is a
mixture<00:04:31.710> of<00:04:31.889> pine<00:04:32.460> trees<00:04:32.490> and<00:04:32.880> just<00:04:33.150> oak<00:04:33.510> trees

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
mixture of pine trees and just oak trees

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.650 
mixture of pine trees and just oak trees
which<00:04:34.199> is<00:04:34.229> quite<00:04:34.560> nice<00:04:34.940> it's<00:04:35.940> not<00:04:36.120> only<00:04:36.330> one

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
which is quite nice it's not only one

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.100 
which is quite nice it's not only one
type<00:04:36.690> of<00:04:37.020> trees

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
type of trees

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:42.899 
type of trees
I've<00:04:38.530> become<00:04:38.979> appear<00:04:39.580> oh<00:04:40.080> that's<00:04:41.909> there's

00:04:42.899 --> 00:04:42.909 
I've become appear oh that's there's

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:45.689 
I've become appear oh that's there's
either<00:04:43.120> something<00:04:43.509> missing<00:04:44.169> here<00:04:44.470> or<00:04:44.650> this<00:04:45.550> is

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:45.699 
either something missing here or this is

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:48.510 
either something missing here or this is
a<00:04:46.000> glitch<00:04:46.750> I'm<00:04:47.080> assuming<00:04:47.710> it's<00:04:47.860> a<00:04:47.949> glitch<00:04:48.219> I

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.520 
a glitch I'm assuming it's a glitch I

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.570 
a glitch I'm assuming it's a glitch I
would<00:04:49.479> just<00:04:49.629> roll<00:04:49.840> over<00:04:50.280> so<00:04:51.280> you've<00:04:51.400> got
