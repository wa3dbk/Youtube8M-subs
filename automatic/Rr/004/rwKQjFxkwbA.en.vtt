00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:10.820
 hello to all nine outfits like 

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:13.879
 see the devolving bang situation 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:16.430
 it undergoes metamorphosis and I am 

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:18.590
 beginning to try to bring her back to 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.780
 side and this is not satisfied with 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.840
 this thing anyway new video of 

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:25.400
 outfits we start with makeup because they are 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.120
 really satisfied the trick I have 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.980
 realized 

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:30.110
 apart from that I have a flashy 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.450
 register apart that I have marked 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:34.370
 with the mascara the eyelid 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.780
 for a change, because I did n't follow 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.390
 the advice to lire the hall there 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:41.210
 I was there for a long time 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.010
 does the part again as a test 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.720
 edition if I'm not mistaken or that 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.160
 advised to put his head like this 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.570
 when applying to the mascara mind 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:51.079
 look in the front mirror 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:53.750
 put her a head I add back in 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:55.370
 so way with going brush measures 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.520
 there is no risk of touching the 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:01.010
 eyelid actually is right 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:03.500
 however to makeup we see this trick 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.500
 simple simple i used colors 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.180
 trend of the moment because I found for 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.950
 the first time last night the new one 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:14.659
 snow make up collection called 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.920
 imaginary are a great look from 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:17.900
 torino and in any case should be called 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.909
 imagine that it also contains a goal e 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.119
 a green inside that then 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:24.770
 used that emerald green 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:27.920
 beautiful on like the eyeliner line 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:30.260
 and then the purple which 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.610
 the illuminant that is in here is me 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.170
 forgotten there was an illuminated one 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:37.190
 in the collection then used the 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:39.410
 my star classic mine 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.630
 classic of the pupa stick to which 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:45.790
 I'm doing the hole for as long as I am 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:50.420
 using and therefore an enlightened one and that 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:53.690
 what here at valentina 004 then with 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:57.410
 this pencil which is called oil ho 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:59.510
 made by the eyeliner line e 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:02.000
 this my life here really beautiful me 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:03.950
 I find these colors 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.830
 on the brown eyes they really are 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:10.970
 really well and looks back from it with 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:13.280
 Montebello This eye shadow pixie thyrsos 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.200
 umbreto I love powder eye shadow 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.390
 free I like them because obviously 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.300
 this in shine this in 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.970
 wonderful detail 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.540
 then up towards for intense this thing does 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:29.090
 just struggling to focus 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.980
 ok and apply it wetting it with fog 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.600
 fixing and then I passed the 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.670
 pencil 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.320
 then or shaded the colors above 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.690
 they are two as elegant as usual 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.519
 regarding the lion instead are 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:43.489
 actually two purple 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:45.799
 this here I say that I debuted not not 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:47.239
 I remember more the number that is actually 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:49.370
 one of these three is true though 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:50.660
 practically one day I fell 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.200
 so all the waffles are 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.610
 removed I do not know more than that colorism 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.209
 what we give some numbers can 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:01.040
 lisbon which is obviously above why 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:03.560
 he wants to kiko is very very me 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.390
 pigmented then take it immediately above 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.400
 instead I went with live chicken and it is 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.370
 a little this example of this 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.230
 imaginary correction a little more tenuous 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:14.390
 it's not that many colors and it's called 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.110
 free jumaine jones and therefore has it 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.610
 used for 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:20.140
 to continue to blend the purple one 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.790
 in short, without making an effect 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.560
 eye yeast eye punch 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.970
 what is on the cheeks instead today 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.530
 using another arm of the 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:30.340
 collection or the clearest one that 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:36.790
 it was called fairy say not bad had 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:38.440
 this here not only good to see I have to 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.930
 to say no is not evil on the lips 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:43.239
 instead I tried to put some 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:46.450
 I also tried lipstick with only lo 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:47.950
 exhausted of essen I hope I did not like e 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.269
 so I only put cocoa butter 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.140
 and then let's move on to the version 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:52.510
 whole wheat 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.890
 here we are at tonight I have only one 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:58.299
 accessory 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:04:00.370
 however it is beautiful strong in my sense 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:02.980
 super super super tarina bracelet 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:07.000
 tarantino that not everyone likes to admit 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:09.790
 not everyone likes it but I like it active and 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.830

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:14.830

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:21.010
 half a rose what you have 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.080

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:37.960
 detail that you want to the hands I have 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.669
 done in this way then with the 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.470
 right that you can also open the zip e 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:42.640
 the sleeve goes down longer than bombs 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:44.470
 of embracing also to say also the 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:46.810
 Colonel in with the version but me 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:52.180

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:54.669
 the sleeve is drawn above this 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:56.229
 This handbag is here because the number 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:57.880
 He not gave it a boy then 

00:04:56.229 --> 00:04:59.950
 I like to go crazy for that too 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:02.070
 because of course it's side 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:04.780
 affective stoned that it is beautiful 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:08.050
 under simple simple shooting this 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:09.820
 insect crisis of the Chinese is under this 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:11.260
 shoe that I had taken last year 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:16.169
 so for those who follow me a little from the will 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:18.750
 very high view that green fuchsia and 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:20.460
 yellow and therefore with 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:22.440
 the idea of let's make a little taken 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:24.060
 from this shoe with the green port has 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:26.070
 won miners of or saw him standing 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:27.870
 going these shoes a lot here though 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:28.890
 they are weak Chinese and they are not 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:30.930
 uncomfortable 

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:32.940
 I remember going there last summer 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:35.130
 even to dance quietly throughout 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:36.690
 night didn't hurt my feet seen 

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:37.920
 that the evening is still a little German 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:42.270
 above are year to put this 

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:45.450
 jacket here easy and simple badge 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:47.550
 this is says I had n't taken it though 

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:50.790
 last spring with his hands bent over 

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:52.380
 they come in three quarters and like strength 

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:54.450
 use in last purchase that was 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:56.220
 that of armani and his writing 

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:57.990
 I didn't think so much about this bag 

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:59.970
 instead I bought it a week ago and 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:02.490
 this week I used it 

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:06.390
 every day i really am 

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:09.390
 exploiting as much as he used to say then 

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:10.380
 this is this bag here and this l 

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:13.380
 output for tonight 

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:15.210
 and with this it's all I'm happy with 

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:17.370
 made that under the last 20 of outfits 

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:19.650
 some girls are writing me that 

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:22.500
 according to them I am a bit better at 

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:25.860
 in dressing in short, combining them 

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:28.800
 I've always said that I'm not 

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:30.780
 in short, a genius is not carla gozzi 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:33.020
 of the situation 

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:35.539
 obviously though 

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:39.080
 I mean the rental video more like 

00:06:35.539 --> 00:06:40.940
 let's say a chat 

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:43.370
 maybe if I like it I like to serve 

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:45.379
 outfit also because maybe I see I don't know 

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:48.159
 an accessory that I like then 

00:06:45.379 --> 00:06:50.330
 look for a particular t-shirt a 

00:06:48.159 --> 00:06:52.580
 so it's not like I'm really watching 

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:53.960
 all the combination in short for 

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:57.190
 me is also a way to get to know better 

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:59.960
 the person who is making the video 

00:06:57.190 --> 00:07:05.889
 boh I like it here so it's not 

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:08.270
 which I consider to be clothing because 

00:07:05.889 --> 00:07:10.069
 I don't do them like that because maybe 

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:11.990
 It has often happened that some girls do 

00:07:10.069 --> 00:07:13.639
 they gave advice on how to pair 

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:15.050
 things because there are of course 

00:07:13.639 --> 00:07:17.990
 girls the ones who follow me a little more 

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:19.310
 of time they also remember maybe that 

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:21.259
 certain chief he had purchased 

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:23.300
 that I had worn some cars said 

00:07:21.259 --> 00:07:25.639
 for rim announce maybe there would be 

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:27.199
 that was better then i think but 

00:07:25.639 --> 00:07:29.110
 even a tip no 

00:07:27.199 --> 00:07:32.270
 I build my output videos 

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:34.849
 we say that I do them with in this 

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:36.469
 sense therefore not wanting to be 

00:07:34.849 --> 00:07:39.949
 fashion teacher 

00:07:36.469 --> 00:07:41.630
 let alone so nothing with this is 

00:07:39.949 --> 00:07:45.460
 all I send a kiss and there 

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:45.460
 we were video bye
