big successful it doesn't happen like

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.429 
big successful it doesn't happen like
that<00:01:38.850> or<00:01:39.210> at<00:01:39.450> least<00:01:39.659> it<00:01:39.780> shouldn't<00:01:39.990> it<00:01:40.229> you

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
that or at least it shouldn't it you

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.050 
that or at least it shouldn't it you
should<00:01:40.650> have<00:01:40.680> to<00:01:40.950> work<00:01:41.130> at<00:01:41.310> it<00:01:41.340> teaches<00:01:41.880> you<00:01:42.030> a

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
should have to work at it teaches you a

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.870 
should have to work at it teaches you a
work<00:01:42.360> ethic<00:01:42.509> so<00:01:43.470> that's<00:01:43.680> really<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.040> basis<00:01:44.759> I

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
work ethic so that's really the basis I

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.940 
work ethic so that's really the basis I
think<00:01:45.060> if<00:01:45.119> everybody<00:01:45.329> success<00:01:45.810> is<00:01:46.020> you<00:01:46.770> work

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
think if everybody success is you work

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.800 
think if everybody success is you work
hard<00:01:47.280> you're<00:01:47.759> committed<00:01:48.299> and<00:01:48.420> you're

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
hard you're committed and you're

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.929 
hard you're committed and you're
consistent<00:01:49.320> consistency<00:01:49.890> is<00:01:49.920> also<00:01:50.280> a<00:01:50.310> huge

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
consistent consistency is also a huge

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.999 
consistent consistency is also a huge
key<00:01:51.210> to<00:01:51.479> anything<00:01:52.140> you<00:01:52.350> do<00:01:52.439> in<00:01:52.560> life<00:01:52.590> the

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
key to anything you do in life the

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.410 
key to anything you do in life the
relationships<00:01:53.700> with<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:53.970> other<00:01:54.090> women<00:01:54.240> were

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
relationships with the other women were

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.389 
relationships with the other women were
huge<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:55.320> me<00:01:55.350> because<00:01:55.619> so<00:01:55.920> many<00:01:55.979> of<00:01:56.100> my<00:01:56.159> friends

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
huge to me because so many of my friends

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.480 
huge to me because so many of my friends
have<00:01:56.850> moved<00:01:57.719> away<00:01:57.869> from<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.229> area<00:01:58.409> or<00:01:58.979> got

the<00:02:01.770> most<00:02:01.979> satisfying<00:02:02.490> thing<00:02:02.790> is<00:02:02.939> probably

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
the most satisfying thing is probably

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.100 
the most satisfying thing is probably
seeing<00:02:03.659> a<00:02:03.990> girl<00:02:04.530> self<00:02:04.860> esteem<00:02:05.009> grow<00:02:06.110> just

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
seeing a girl self esteem grow just

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.210 
seeing a girl self esteem grow just
because<00:02:07.320> she<00:02:07.469> sees<00:02:07.649> that<00:02:07.770> she<00:02:07.950> can<00:02:08.069> do

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
because she sees that she can do

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.949 
because she sees that she can do
something<00:02:08.459> maybe<00:02:09.450> she's<00:02:09.690> never<00:02:09.840> worked

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
something maybe she's never worked

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:10.900 
something maybe she's never worked
