00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.670
 hello and welcome youtube 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.860
 here at another video on my 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.660
 Channel bands apps are available today 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:23.600
 Again trading tips I have a whole 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.770
 small tripp the trick becomes the video 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.900
 today a bit shorter than that 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.400
 a relatively easy to explain trick 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.570
 and indeed go first to the 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.770
 transferliste i'll show you now 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.910
 what happened I have one 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:37.280
 Martinsville sold just under 37,000 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:41.960
 that martinz has one in the form of 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:43.519
 inform price is so at 37,000 me 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.010
 just have him for the price in form 

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:47.510
 put on something cheaper and there 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.489
 are just people waiting for the sooner 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.440
 cheaper can then strike directly 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:54.769
 the eighth only on the contracts or on 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:57.859
 the fitness no idea and then hit 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:59.870
 right there the coins on it and then 

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:00.969
 you notice that's not in 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.480
 shape 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:08.090
 these stupidities or mistakes of the 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:09.290
 now call them players 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.020
 we of course benefit 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:14.000
 I had him for four days ago 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.320
 900 coins bought now has four days 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.700
 I took them to the then 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.250
 Again and again, many hours are sold 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.690
 I put it over the night 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.040
 then changed twelve hours 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.690
 so I set up the next day 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.040
 can put every hour on the mood 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:28.250
 is best for the holidays 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.690
 I have at the moment so yes there are missing 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.590
 You can actually do the same with everyone 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:35.300
 make in the form of relatively popular it 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.340
 For example, Martins was that pace 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:40.400
 and the five stars on the weak 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.770
 foot turn time still ben attia I have 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:45.470
 viewed at other youtube that 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.210
 also works relatively well and then 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:51.110
 you can stop the whole pace we want 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.790
 still next bmw hermann also with the rooster 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.680
 it should have been relatively well already 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.210
 many people among other videos 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.540
 written that works relatively well 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:01.840
 I was only skeptical if that will work 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.920
 because I was not sure if that 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.660
 anyone so stupid is us one 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.490
 player bought too expensive but you notice 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.569
 very much here you will definitely succeed 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.509
 Unfortunately, it was one of those now 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:13.480
 cheaper in form 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:15.760
 but I mean 37,000 just like that 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.040
 hand is quite hot most of today 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.750
 has looked at my mobile phone tomorrow 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.730
 then 50,000 have now for 10,000 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:26.280
 a new team is built soon 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:28.629
 a gameplay to the trick and we 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:32.349
 We'll do it now 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:35.950
 on at or food at and look there 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:39.790
 team of the week teams of the week 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.799
 last ten of the last week 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.329
 weeks on 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:46.930
 So here we go to all fifa 15 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:48.549
 team of the week then you can here 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.930
 just look up which player 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:51.099
 here could be so interesting to 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.629
 example is the first team of the week 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:55.109
 very popular that others too 

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:59.440
 that's why it costs so around the 

00:02:55.109 --> 00:03:01.750
 15,000 or 500,000 I mean that can 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.950
 You stop by and enter 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.889
 Player on so important is one 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.959
 interesting league just any 

00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:10.799
 special features such as pace and 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:13.930
 really horny shot no idea and 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:15.400
 normal price would be pretty low we would 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.079
 now preferably the company 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.290
 because huntelaars relatively cheap and the 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:21.849
 Being in shape is relatively popular 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.500
 We're just fit for dog leashes 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:25.480
 to look at how expensive because that the 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:29.739
 normal and how expensive is in shape 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:32.290
 because in the form of what are 50,000 and the 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:33.940
 normal costs 1200 we can do that 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.269
 We have made it to buy a normal market 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:41.010
 fast here 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:41.010
 klaas jan huntelaar five-thousanders 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:49.280
 I know, for example, cheaper 2100 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.280
 Of course , you have to look there 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:54.349
 Of course, look again what the 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.209
 Fitness says and everything is free there 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:58.849
 the people on it when the greeks in 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:00.260
 to lay shape want now 

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:03.049
 we had read somewhere that 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:05.859
 in the form of around 54,000 us 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:07.760
 in now at 53,000 

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:13.660
 the best go a flies 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:18.910
 faster 52,000 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:21.610
 picture storm then we would the so 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:24.220
 put it in and every hour now 

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:25.930
 can repeat yes simply more 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.190
 put in and hope that he leaves 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.180
 Now you can do all this again 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:28.960
 They are doing well that they are watching 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.090
 have expired 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:39.070
 Although we now have has its 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:40.630
 One of the first in form are 220,000 degrees 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.500
 that means we always do it for one 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:42.970
 a little less pure 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:51.270
 maybe someone is looking for you 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:52.930
 Now we are looking at Gritzmann 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:54.220
 pointed moor and whatever 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.990
 it is pronounced he already has 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:58.260
 two naturally pump at the expensive 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:00.640
 Of course, they want more money 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:02.110
 I do not know if that necessarily 

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:04.740
 even more expensive can be that one 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:08.020
 bit cheaper 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:11.730
 but I mean 200,000 quite 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.730
 interesting for us there are only a few 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:17.350
 in form 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:19.120
 84,000 of the sway extremely in the price 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:23.340
 yesterday you could buy the still 470 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:28.920
 Now he is back at around 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:28.920
 80,000 and still the hermann 

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:37.830
 patrick herrmann 39,000 make me that 

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:39.569
 five degrees 39,000 purely then that fits the 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:42.539
 we simply lay back inside 

00:05:39.569 --> 00:05:45.810
 even at 600,000 but easy 

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:48.449
 on top of that yes he also carries seeds 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:50.610
 is works only takes extremely long 

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:53.999
 long but the yield is then 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:55.409
 what happens is extremely high there are people 

00:05:53.999 --> 00:05:57.150
 Jan already has over two million 

00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:59.099
 made because they stop the whole 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:59.749
 transfer list full of such players 

00:05:59.099 --> 00:06:01.469
 to have 

00:05:59.749 --> 00:06:03.029
 I did not have that yet 

00:06:01.469 --> 00:06:04.560
 ambition momentarily fair list permanently 

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:06.060
 I fully agree with that 

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:07.860
 do the second page now 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:10.110
 and then shows you in the next video 

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:13.050
 which players have been sold yet 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:15.719
 which does not last until then 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:18.169
 your gate clean like stunt show event in 

00:06:15.719 --> 00:06:18.169
