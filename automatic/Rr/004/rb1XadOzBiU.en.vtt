good at the end but if you practice a

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.630 
good at the end but if you practice a
lot<00:01:19.259> it<00:01:19.530> you<00:01:19.860> can<00:01:20.040> probably<00:01:20.250> become<00:01:20.610> pretty

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640

them picture here and it's not straight
but<00:01:48.899> of<00:01:49.049> course<00:01:49.229> you<00:01:49.290> have<00:01:49.439> to<00:01:49.470> make<00:01:49.740> it

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
but of course you have to make it

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.710 
but of course you have to make it
straight<00:01:50.130> and<00:01:50.340> if<00:01:50.520> you<00:01:50.640> do<00:01:50.790> that<00:01:50.820> then<00:01:51.240> it

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
straight and if you do that then it

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.440 
straight and if you do that then it
doesn't<00:01:52.079> it<00:01:52.710> or<00:01:53.009> it<00:01:53.280> does<00:01:53.430> become<00:01:53.729> a<00:01:53.939> pretty

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
doesn't it or it does become a pretty

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.870 
doesn't it or it does become a pretty
good<00:01:54.659> looking<00:01:54.960> picture<00:01:55.460> and<00:01:56.460> then<00:01:56.670> of<00:01:56.850> course

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
good looking picture and then of course

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.090 
good looking picture and then of course
we<00:01:57.210> do<00:01:57.299> have<00:01:57.479> a<00:01:57.509> normal<00:01:57.960> video<00:01:58.259> mode<00:01:58.619> here<00:01:58.920> a

we do have a normal video mode here a
video<00:01:59.850> record<00:02:00.509> mode<00:02:00.780> basically<00:02:01.110> and<00:02:01.700> of

video record mode basically and of

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.069 
video record mode basically and of
course<00:02:02.729> let's<00:02:03.360> see<00:02:03.450> here<00:02:03.630> if<00:02:03.719> you<00:02:03.810> will<00:02:03.930> have

an<00:02:04.170> autofocus<00:02:05.719> interesting<00:02:06.719> okay<00:02:07.020> so<00:02:07.079> it

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
an autofocus interesting okay so it

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.339 
an autofocus interesting okay so it
doesn't<00:02:08.009> seem<00:02:08.160> like<00:02:08.190> it's<00:02:08.670> like<00:02:09.629> like<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.229> app

like far away to to get a good focus
which<00:02:45.670> definitely<00:02:45.940> could<00:02:46.209> be<00:02:46.239> a<00:02:46.360> little<00:02:46.540> bit

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660

balance so if you are in daylight a
cloudy<00:03:06.340> and<00:03:07.260> let's<00:03:08.260> try<00:03:08.500> that<00:03:08.680> one<00:03:09.269> you<00:03:10.269> can

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
cloudy and let's try that one you can

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.449 
cloudy and let's try that one you can
see<00:03:10.540> it<00:03:10.750> do<00:03:11.290> becomes<00:03:11.709> a<00:03:11.950> little<00:03:12.040> bit<00:03:12.220> more

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
see it do becomes a little bit more

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:15.030 
see it do becomes a little bit more
yellowish<00:03:12.879> when<00:03:13.329> you<00:03:13.450> do<00:03:13.629> use<00:03:13.840> up<00:03:14.079> one<00:03:14.319> if<00:03:14.890> you

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
yellowish when you do use up one if you

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.020 
yellowish when you do use up one if you
check<00:03:15.430> out<00:03:15.549> like<00:03:16.000> floor<00:03:16.389> cents<00:03:17.730> you<00:03:18.730> can<00:03:18.819> see

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
check out like floor cents you can see

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.520 
check out like floor cents you can see
it's<00:03:19.180> a<00:03:19.269> little<00:03:19.450> bit<00:03:19.540> more<00:03:19.780> like<00:03:19.989> flourish<00:03:21.299> in

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
it's a little bit more like flourish in

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.559 
it's a little bit more like flourish in
what<00:03:23.530> is<00:03:23.680> this<00:03:23.859> this<00:03:24.849> one<00:03:25.060> was<00:03:25.180> a<00:03:25.209> little<00:03:25.299> bit

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:25.569 
what is this this one was a little bit

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:27.870 
what is this this one was a little bit
more<00:03:25.810> bluish<00:03:26.200> if<00:03:26.620> you<00:03:26.709> don't<00:03:26.889> know<00:03:27.099> about<00:03:27.639> the

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
more bluish if you don't know about the

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.670 
more bluish if you don't know about the
right<00:03:28.030> but<00:03:28.239> white<00:03:28.480> balance<00:03:28.840> you<00:03:28.900> probably<00:03:29.410> go

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
right but white balance you probably go

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.920 
right but white balance you probably go
into<00:03:30.010> the<00:03:30.130> auto<00:03:30.340> mode<00:03:30.639> because<00:03:31.180> usually<00:03:31.480> that

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
into the auto mode because usually that

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.259 
into the auto mode because usually that
is<00:03:32.230> the<00:03:32.560> right<00:03:32.980> one<00:03:33.340> but<00:03:33.549> if<00:03:33.700> you<00:03:33.790> look<00:03:33.940> super

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:34.269 
is the right one but if you look super

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:36.270 
is the right one but if you look super
weird<00:03:34.510> maybe<00:03:34.720> you<00:03:35.019> can<00:03:35.500> try<00:03:35.650> out<00:03:35.859> one<00:03:36.040> of<00:03:36.099> these

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
weird maybe you can try out one of these

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.479 
weird maybe you can try out one of these
like<00:03:36.609> daylight<00:03:37.060> or<00:03:37.359> something<00:03:38.160> let's<00:03:39.160> just<00:03:39.280> go

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
like daylight or something let's just go

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:44.190 
like daylight or something let's just go
back<00:03:39.700> to<00:03:39.730> Otto<00:03:40.450> and<00:03:42.209> then<00:03:43.209> also<00:03:43.480> we<00:03:43.750> do<00:03:43.870> have

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
back to Otto and then also we do have

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.460 
back to Otto and then also we do have
some<00:03:44.919> more<00:03:45.099> settings<00:03:45.489> in<00:03:45.639> here<00:03:45.930> we<00:03:46.930> can<00:03:47.230> of

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
some more settings in here we can of

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.009 
some more settings in here we can of
course<00:03:47.500> change<00:03:48.040> to<00:03:48.579> a<00:03:48.849> high<00:03:49.090> resolution<00:03:49.419> and

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
course change to a high resolution and

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:52.409 
course change to a high resolution and
they<00:03:50.530> have<00:03:50.620> for<00:03:51.250> three<00:03:51.609> different<00:03:51.730> modes<00:03:52.030> not

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:52.419 
they have for three different modes not

00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:57.470 
they have for three different modes not
360p<00:03:53.169> here<00:03:53.380> but<00:03:53.700> 720p<00:03:54.700> 480<00:03:55.120> and<00:03:55.510> 1080<00:03:56.079> so

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
360p here but 720p 480 and 1080 so

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.240 
360p here but 720p 480 and 1080 so
usually<00:03:58.480> it's<00:03:58.599> 720p<00:03:59.139> in<00:03:59.379> 1080<00:03:59.799> you<00:03:59.980> can<00:04:00.129> see<00:04:00.220> a

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
usually it's 720p in 1080 you can see a

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.159 
usually it's 720p in 1080 you can see a
little<00:04:00.489> bit<00:04:00.639> of<00:04:00.700> difference<00:04:00.910> but<00:04:01.389> most<00:04:01.989> of<00:04:02.109> the

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:02.169 
little bit of difference but most of the

00:04:02.169 --> 00:04:04.259 
little bit of difference but most of the
times<00:04:02.379> it's<00:04:02.650> not<00:04:02.799> so<00:04:03.040> super<00:04:03.400> huge<00:04:03.790> difference

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:04.269 
times it's not so super huge difference

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:07.349 
times it's not so super huge difference
at<00:04:04.560> time<00:04:05.560> lapse<00:04:05.829> time<00:04:06.160> lapse<00:04:06.519> features<00:04:07.150> off

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:07.359 
at time lapse time lapse features off

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:11.300 
at time lapse time lapse features off
turn<00:04:07.629> on<00:04:07.810> sat<00:04:08.049> time<00:04:08.349> into<00:04:08.620> that<00:04:08.650> into<00:04:09.549> wall<00:04:09.840> ok

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
turn on sat time into that into wall ok

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.280 
turn on sat time into that into wall ok
let's<00:04:12.310> say<00:04:12.760> store<00:04:13.329> location<00:04:13.840> so<00:04:14.019> you<00:04:14.109> can

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
let's say store location so you can

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:17.640 
let's say store location so you can
store<00:04:14.590> location<00:04:15.220> if<00:04:15.340> you<00:04:15.489> want<00:04:15.790> that<00:04:16.590> also<00:04:17.590> of

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
store location if you want that also of

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:19.620 
store location if you want that also of
course<00:04:17.859> you<00:04:18.099> can<00:04:18.310> change<00:04:18.729> your<00:04:19.000> immediately

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
course you can change your immediately

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:20.400 
course you can change your immediately
to

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.410 
to

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:22.650 
to
the<00:04:20.800> front<00:04:21.010> facing<00:04:21.310> camera<00:04:21.730> if<00:04:21.880> you<00:04:22.420> would

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:22.660 
the front facing camera if you would

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:29.250 
the front facing camera if you would
like<00:04:22.930> to<00:04:23.200> do<00:04:23.350> so<00:04:25.860> and<00:04:27.810> then<00:04:28.810> it<00:04:29.050> immediately

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260 
like to do so and then it immediately

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.220 
like to do so and then it immediately
goes<00:04:29.800> back<00:04:30.130> there<00:04:30.430> and<00:04:30.760> then<00:04:31.720> also<00:04:31.900> you<00:04:32.050> do

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:32.230 
goes back there and then also you do

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:34.520 
goes back there and then also you do
have<00:04:32.350> flash<00:04:32.620> mode<00:04:32.860> enable<00:04:33.580> and<00:04:33.670> disable<00:04:33.790> flash

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
have flash mode enable and disable flash

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:37.080 
have flash mode enable and disable flash
I'm<00:04:35.530> sure<00:04:35.770> though<00:04:35.950> if<00:04:35.980> you<00:04:36.220> do<00:04:36.340> use<00:04:36.580> that<00:04:36.790> in<00:04:37.030> a

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
I'm sure though if you do use that in a

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.830 
I'm sure though if you do use that in a
normal<00:04:37.450> mode<00:04:37.990> there<00:04:38.290> for<00:04:38.850> video<00:04:39.850> and<00:04:40.150> then<00:04:40.690> of

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840 
normal mode there for video and then of

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.660 
normal mode there for video and then of
course<00:04:41.050> we<00:04:41.200> do<00:04:41.290> have<00:04:41.530> the<00:04:41.650> normal<00:04:41.830> picture

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:42.670 
course we do have the normal picture

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:45.690 
course we do have the normal picture
mode<00:04:42.880> here<00:04:43.380> and<00:04:44.380> you<00:04:44.800> can<00:04:44.950> see<00:04:45.130> here<00:04:45.340> that<00:04:45.370> at

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:45.700 
mode here and you can see here that at

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.040 
mode here and you can see here that at
least<00:04:45.850> the<00:04:46.000> picture<00:04:46.390> mode<00:04:46.570> when<00:04:46.900> you're

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
least the picture mode when you're

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:56.280 
least the picture mode when you're
closed<00:04:47.530> in<00:04:47.830> you<00:04:48.670> can<00:04:49.000> get<00:04:49.330> a<00:04:49.360> good<00:04:49.570> focus<00:04:55.290> it

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:56.290 
closed in you can get a good focus it

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:58.080 
closed in you can get a good focus it
also<00:04:56.530> seemed<00:04:56.770> like<00:04:56.950> you<00:04:57.010> can<00:04:57.160> spam<00:04:57.610> textures

normal galaxy s4 with like TouchWiz it

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:07.320 
normal galaxy s4 with like TouchWiz it
doesn't<00:05:06.310> seem<00:05:06.430> like<00:05:06.610> you<00:05:06.730> have<00:05:06.760> that<00:05:07.060> option

people saying that they get get get
great<00:05:16.510> results<00:05:16.750> and<00:05:17.170> generate<00:05:17.410> grip<00:05:17.770> and

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:18.280 
great results and generate grip and

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.610 
great results and generate grip and
greater<00:05:18.580> looking<00:05:18.970> pictures<00:05:19.270> with<00:05:19.510> it<00:05:19.620> and

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:20.620 
greater looking pictures with it and

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:21.960 
greater looking pictures with it and
then<00:05:20.800> we<00:05:20.950> do<00:05:21.070> have<00:05:21.280> their<00:05:21.430> normal<00:05:21.640> exposure

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:21.970 
then we do have their normal exposure

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:24.420 
then we do have their normal exposure
mode<00:05:22.300> here<00:05:22.540> that<00:05:22.690> we<00:05:22.780> can<00:05:22.810> change<00:05:23.220> so<00:05:24.220> you<00:05:24.280> can

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:24.430 
mode here that we can change so you can

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:27.230 
mode here that we can change so you can
make<00:05:24.520> it<00:05:24.580> brighter<00:05:24.940> if<00:05:25.180> you<00:05:25.360> would<00:05:25.540> like<00:05:25.720> or

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 
make it brighter if you would like or

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.780 
make it brighter if you would like or
also<00:05:28.240> of<00:05:28.300> course<00:05:28.510> like<00:05:28.840> darker<00:05:29.550> you<00:05:30.550> can

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:30.790 
also of course like darker you can

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:35.580 
also of course like darker you can
really<00:05:31.000> see<00:05:31.390> the<00:05:31.420> difference<00:05:31.480> there<00:05:32.850> and<00:05:34.590> then

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:35.590 
really see the difference there and then

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:37.980 
really see the difference there and then
we<00:05:36.070> also<00:05:36.340> do<00:05:36.640> have<00:05:36.970> more<00:05:37.270> options<00:05:37.480> here

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:37.990 
we also do have more options here

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:40.310 
we also do have more options here
