hi<00:00:00.840> my<00:00:01.680> name<00:00:01.829> is<00:00:01.920> John<00:00:02.129> Sewall<00:00:02.399> and<00:00:02.760> in<00:00:02.850> this

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:03.000 
hi my name is John Sewall and in this

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.999 
hi my name is John Sewall and in this
video<00:00:03.330> I<00:00:03.629> want<00:00:03.840> to<00:00:03.899> quickly<00:00:04.140> talk<00:00:04.500> about<00:00:04.560> the

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
video I want to quickly talk about the

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.270 
video I want to quickly talk about the
new<00:00:05.190> Windows<00:00:05.850> Azure<00:00:06.089> Express<00:00:06.839> rail<00:00:07.280> now

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
new Windows Azure Express rail now

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:09.549 
new Windows Azure Express rail now
traditionally<00:00:08.940> when<00:00:09.150> we<00:00:09.179> think<00:00:09.420> about

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:09.559 
traditionally when we think about

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:12.379 
traditionally when we think about
networking<00:00:10.559> and<00:00:11.010> connectivity<00:00:11.490> from<00:00:12.030> Windows

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
networking and connectivity from Windows

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.169 
networking and connectivity from Windows
Azure<00:00:12.630> to<00:00:13.110> our<00:00:13.500> on-premise<00:00:14.250> we<00:00:14.730> think<00:00:14.969> about

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
Azure to our on-premise we think about

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.180 
Azure to our on-premise we think about
the<00:00:15.330> site-to-site<00:00:15.780> Virtual<00:00:16.500> Private<00:00:16.680> Network

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
the site-to-site Virtual Private Network

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.720 
the site-to-site Virtual Private Network
and<00:00:17.490> this<00:00:18.449> really<00:00:18.750> looks<00:00:19.050> like<00:00:19.199> the<00:00:19.439> following

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:19.730 
and this really looks like the following

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.269 
and this really looks like the following
so<00:00:20.730> we<00:00:20.880> have<00:00:21.119> our<00:00:21.920> Windows<00:00:22.920> Azure

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
so we have our Windows Azure

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.480 
so we have our Windows Azure
subscription<00:00:23.689> in<00:00:24.859> here<00:00:25.859> we<00:00:26.039> create<00:00:26.369> an

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
subscription in here we create an

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.339 
subscription in here we create an
affinity<00:00:26.760> group<00:00:27.029> which<00:00:27.779> is<00:00:27.900> linked<00:00:28.230> to<00:00:28.320> a

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
affinity group which is linked to a

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.550 
affinity group which is linked to a
certain<00:00:28.859> region<00:00:29.099> in<00:00:29.429> Windows<00:00:29.760> Azure<00:00:30.560> within

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
certain region in Windows Azure within

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.270 
certain region in Windows Azure within
that<00:00:31.740> affinity<00:00:32.399> group<00:00:32.780> we<00:00:33.780> create<00:00:34.170> a<00:00:34.350> virtual

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
that affinity group we create a virtual

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.010 
that affinity group we create a virtual
network<00:00:35.930> and<00:00:37.160> this<00:00:38.160> enables<00:00:38.700> us<00:00:38.910> to<00:00:39.030> define

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
network and this enables us to define

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.440 
network and this enables us to define
certain<00:00:40.620> IP<00:00:40.739> ranges<00:00:41.550> we<00:00:41.700> want<00:00:41.910> to<00:00:42.000> use<00:00:42.210> and

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
certain IP ranges we want to use and

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.260 
certain IP ranges we want to use and
then<00:00:42.809> virtual<00:00:43.290> subnets<00:00:43.770> within<00:00:44.129> that<00:00:44.370> into

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
then virtual subnets within that into

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.410 
then virtual subnets within that into
which<00:00:45.480> we<00:00:45.750> create<00:00:46.110> virtual<00:00:46.800> machines<00:00:47.420> now

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
which we create virtual machines now

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.080 
which we create virtual machines now
within<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.870> virtual<00:00:49.020> network<00:00:49.760> we<00:00:50.760> create<00:00:51.059> a

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
within the virtual network we create a

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.930 
within the virtual network we create a
number<00:00:51.449> of<00:00:51.570> cloud<00:00:51.840> services<00:00:52.649> so<00:00:53.640> I<00:00:53.699> can<00:00:53.850> have

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
number of cloud services so I can have

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.750 
number of cloud services so I can have
multiple<00:00:54.329> cloud<00:00:54.750> services<00:00:55.500> within<00:00:56.399> a

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
multiple cloud services within a

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.490 
multiple cloud services within a
specific<00:00:56.969> virtual<00:00:57.690> networking<00:00:58.020> Windows

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
specific virtual networking Windows

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.220 
specific virtual networking Windows
Azure<00:00:58.800> and<00:00:59.250> then<00:00:59.820> within<00:00:59.969> those<00:01:00.359> that's<00:01:00.989> why<00:01:01.199> I

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
Azure and then within those that's why I

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.179 
Azure and then within those that's why I
create<00:01:01.680> my<00:01:02.550> various<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.270> ends<00:01:03.600> so<00:01:04.070> I<00:01:05.070> have

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
create my various the ends so I have

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.030 
create my various the ends so I have
different<00:01:05.400> virtual<00:01:06.030> machines<00:01:06.830> running<00:01:07.830> in

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
different virtual machines running in

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.890 
different virtual machines running in
those<00:01:08.159> cloud<00:01:08.460> services<00:01:09.119> running<00:01:09.630> in<00:01:09.720> Windows

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
those cloud services running in Windows

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.320 
those cloud services running in Windows
Azure<00:01:10.430> that's<00:01:11.430> sitting<00:01:11.820> inside<00:01:11.970> that

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
Azure that's sitting inside that

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.050 
Azure that's sitting inside that
affinity<00:01:12.780> group<00:01:12.960> which<00:01:13.080> is<00:01:13.200> region<00:01:13.850> within<00:01:14.850> my

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
affinity group which is region within my

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.390 
affinity group which is region within my
cloud<00:01:15.509> subscription<00:01:16.759> but<00:01:17.759> then<00:01:17.880> also<00:01:18.060> I<00:01:19.400> have

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
cloud subscription but then also I have

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.210 
cloud subscription but then also I have
some<00:01:20.700> on<00:01:21.110> premise<00:01:22.110> infrastructure<00:01:22.770> and

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
some on premise infrastructure and

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.620 
some on premise infrastructure and
within<00:01:24.090> there

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
within there

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.440 
within there
I<00:01:24.810> have<00:01:25.229> virtual<00:01:26.070> machines<00:01:26.100> I<00:01:26.700> have<00:01:26.820> physical

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
I have virtual machines I have physical

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.280 
I have virtual machines I have physical
servers<00:01:27.990> and<00:01:28.920> I<00:01:29.700> want<00:01:30.390> connectivity<00:01:31.110> between

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
servers and I want connectivity between

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.030 
servers and I want connectivity between
them<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:32.090> the<00:01:33.090> way<00:01:33.210> this<00:01:33.390> works

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.040 
them and the way this works

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.980 
them and the way this works
traditionally<00:01:35.040> is<00:01:35.280> I<00:01:36.000> use<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.450> winners<00:01:36.720> as<00:01:36.960> a

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
traditionally is I use the winners as a

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.380 
traditionally is I use the winners as a
site-to-site<00:01:37.409> Virtual<00:01:38.250> Private<00:01:38.430> Network<00:01:38.970> and

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
site-to-site Virtual Private Network and

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.560 
site-to-site Virtual Private Network and
what<00:01:40.170> it<00:01:40.290> actually<00:01:40.430> consists<00:01:41.430> of<00:01:41.549> is<00:01:42.090> in

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
what it actually consists of is in

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.929 
what it actually consists of is in
Windows<00:01:42.899> Azure<00:01:43.110> at<00:01:43.710> a<00:01:43.829> virtual<00:01:44.310> network<00:01:44.460> level

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
Windows Azure at a virtual network level

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.249 
Windows Azure at a virtual network level
I<00:01:45.590> create<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.920> gateway<00:01:47.750> component<00:01:48.750> this<00:01:49.079> is<00:01:49.229> a

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
I create the gateway component this is a

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.050 
I create the gateway component this is a
gateway<00:01:49.560> I<00:01:50.030> also<00:01:51.030> on<00:01:51.570> my<00:01:51.720> on-prem<00:01:52.470> I<00:01:52.820> have<00:01:53.820> a

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
gateway I also on my on-prem I have a

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.560 
gateway I also on my on-prem I have a
gateway<00:01:54.390> now<00:01:55.049> this<00:01:55.229> could<00:01:55.530> be<00:01:56.360> remote<00:01:57.360> access

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
gateway now this could be remote access

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.230 
gateway now this could be remote access
services<00:01:58.290> Windows<00:01:58.590> Server<00:01:58.829> 2012<00:01:59.250> it<00:01:59.729> could<00:02:00.090> be

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
services Windows Server 2012 it could be

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.120 
services Windows Server 2012 it could be
a<00:02:00.270> hardware<00:02:00.780> gateway<00:02:01.320> appliance<00:02:01.439> and

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
a hardware gateway appliance and

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.030 
a hardware gateway appliance and
effectively<00:02:03.000> what<00:02:03.210> happens<00:02:03.780> is<00:02:03.990> we<00:02:04.590> get<00:02:04.799> a

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
effectively what happens is we get a

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.320 
effectively what happens is we get a
site-to-site<00:02:05.490> VPN<00:02:06.590> bi-directional<00:02:08.209> so<00:02:09.209> this

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
site-to-site VPN bi-directional so this

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.140 
site-to-site VPN bi-directional so this
enables<00:02:09.869> IP<00:02:10.200> routing<00:02:10.709> between<00:02:10.979> my<00:02:11.280> on<00:02:11.520> premise

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
enables IP routing between my on premise

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.240 
enables IP routing between my on premise
structure<00:02:12.599> and<00:02:12.840> my<00:02:13.349> Windows<00:02:13.739> Azure<00:02:14.040> virtual

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
structure and my Windows Azure virtual

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.360 
structure and my Windows Azure virtual
private<00:02:14.819> network<00:02:15.329> and<00:02:15.799> that's<00:02:16.799> great

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
private network and that's great

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.670 
private network and that's great
but<00:02:18.180> I<00:02:18.390> kind<00:02:18.659> of<00:02:18.720> get<00:02:18.810> limited<00:02:19.200> in<00:02:19.319> terms<00:02:19.470> of

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
but I kind of get limited in terms of

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.979 
but I kind of get limited in terms of
speeds<00:02:20.010> so<00:02:20.760> this<00:02:20.879> may<00:02:21.030> be<00:02:21.060> a<00:02:21.180> hundred<00:02:21.390> megabits

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
speeds so this may be a hundred megabits

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:25.069

per<00:02:22.140> second<00:02:22.650> I'm<00:02:23.090> traveling<00:02:24.090> over<00:02:24.540> the<00:02:24.659> public

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:25.079 
per second I'm traveling over the public

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:27.199 
per second I'm traveling over the public
Internet<00:02:25.650> so<00:02:26.250> even<00:02:26.549> though<00:02:26.670> this<00:02:26.819> is

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
Internet so even though this is

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.349 
Internet so even though this is
encrypted<00:02:28.110> with<00:02:28.379> IPSec<00:02:28.849> that<00:02:29.849> can<00:02:30.150> be

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:30.359 
encrypted with IPSec that can be

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:33.800 
encrypted with IPSec that can be
off-putting<00:02:30.689> to<00:02:31.200> some<00:02:31.349> customers<00:02:32.069> also<00:02:33.000> as<00:02:33.569> it

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
off-putting to some customers also as it

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.110 
off-putting to some customers also as it
stands<00:02:34.140> today<00:02:34.349> as<00:02:34.620> I<00:02:34.739> record<00:02:35.099> this<00:02:35.220> I<00:02:35.579> can<00:02:36.000> only

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
stands today as I record this I can only

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.199 
stands today as I record this I can only
have<00:02:36.390> one<00:02:36.720> site-to-site<00:02:37.319> VPN<00:02:37.549> connection<00:02:38.549> so

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
have one site-to-site VPN connection so

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:42.679 
have one site-to-site VPN connection so
if<00:02:39.299> I<00:02:39.420> had<00:02:39.689> a<00:02:39.720> second<00:02:40.680> or<00:02:40.890> a<00:02:40.980> third<00:02:41.689> on-premise

00:02:42.679 --> 00:02:42.689 
if I had a second or a third on-premise

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:45.589 
if I had a second or a third on-premise
location<00:02:43.319> I<00:02:43.700> can't<00:02:44.700> connect<00:02:45.030> it<00:02:45.180> directly<00:02:45.269> to

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 
location I can't connect it directly to

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:47.720 
location I can't connect it directly to
that<00:02:45.720> virtual<00:02:45.930> network<00:02:46.470> the<00:02:47.220> only<00:02:47.430> way<00:02:47.549> I<00:02:47.579> can

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
that virtual network the only way I can

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.759 
that virtual network the only way I can
get<00:02:47.970> traffic<00:02:48.269> to<00:02:48.480> route<00:02:48.810> is<00:02:49.139> the<00:02:49.470> traffic

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
get traffic to route is the traffic

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:52.220 
get traffic to route is the traffic
would<00:02:50.069> actually<00:02:50.579> have<00:02:50.819> to<00:02:50.970> route<00:02:51.180> into<00:02:51.840> like

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
would actually have to route into like

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.069 
would actually have to route into like
this<00:02:52.530> on-premise<00:02:53.459> data<00:02:53.609> center<00:02:54.180> which<00:02:54.870> could

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:55.079 
this on-premise data center which could

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:57.080 
this on-premise data center which could
then<00:02:55.109> route<00:02:55.560> it<00:02:55.799> through<00:02:55.829> into<00:02:56.549> Windows<00:02:56.849> Azure

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
then route it through into Windows Azure

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.559 
then route it through into Windows Azure
so<00:02:57.959> that<00:02:58.079> Dr<00:02:58.639> scenario<00:02:59.639> I<00:02:59.909> would<00:03:00.150> have<00:03:00.269> to<00:03:00.389> buy

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
so that Dr scenario I would have to buy

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:02.390 
so that Dr scenario I would have to buy
some<00:03:00.810> PowerShell<00:03:01.349> to<00:03:01.379> move<00:03:01.739> the<00:03:01.920> gateway

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
some PowerShell to move the gateway

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.990 
some PowerShell to move the gateway
between<00:03:02.730> my<00:03:03.540> various<00:03:03.870> on-premise<00:03:04.349> locations

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
between my various on-premise locations

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.920 
between my various on-premise locations
and<00:03:06.000> so<00:03:06.090> while<00:03:06.269> this<00:03:06.359> works<00:03:06.659> or<00:03:06.810> there's

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
and so while this works or there's

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.629 
and so while this works or there's
continued<00:03:07.349> improvement<00:03:08.010> in<00:03:08.099> this<00:03:08.280> there's

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:08.639 
continued improvement in this there's

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:10.910 
continued improvement in this there's
changes<00:03:09.239> coming<00:03:09.269> I<00:03:09.780> mean<00:03:10.079> they're<00:03:10.409> looking<00:03:10.739> to

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
changes coming I mean they're looking to

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.339 
changes coming I mean they're looking to
add<00:03:11.129> multiple<00:03:11.639> gateways<00:03:11.970> to<00:03:12.209> fix<00:03:12.629> this<00:03:12.810> this

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:13.349 
add multiple gateways to fix this this

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:16.280 
add multiple gateways to fix this this
is<00:03:13.409> still<00:03:13.769> not<00:03:13.950> an<00:03:14.069> ideal<00:03:14.370> scenario<00:03:15.290> so

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
is still not an ideal scenario so

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.409 
is still not an ideal scenario so
Microsoft<00:03:16.560> have<00:03:16.949> announced<00:03:17.699> Express<00:03:18.150> rail

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:18.419 
Microsoft have announced Express rail

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:20.539 
Microsoft have announced Express rail
which<00:03:18.660> is<00:03:18.780> in<00:03:18.900> preview<00:03:19.319> right<00:03:19.500> now<00:03:19.680> Pleven<00:03:20.069> go

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 
which is in preview right now Pleven go

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:23.949 
which is in preview right now Pleven go
ga<00:03:20.819> and<00:03:21.209> this<00:03:22.169> changes<00:03:22.680> things

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 
ga and this changes things

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:28.009 
ga and this changes things
so<00:03:24.959> the<00:03:25.079> Express<00:03:25.410> route<00:03:25.709> I<00:03:26.480> still<00:03:27.480> have<00:03:27.750> my

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
so the Express route I still have my

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:32.000 
so the Express route I still have my
Windows<00:03:28.409> Azure<00:03:28.680> subscription<00:03:29.359> I'm<00:03:31.010> still

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
Windows Azure subscription I'm still

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.240 
Windows Azure subscription I'm still
going<00:03:32.190> to<00:03:32.220> create<00:03:33.230> virtual<00:03:34.230> networks<00:03:34.889> or<00:03:35.099> vote

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
going to create virtual networks or vote

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.099 
going to create virtual networks or vote
two<00:03:35.459> more<00:03:36.030> of<00:03:36.180> them<00:03:36.329> I've<00:03:36.419> never<00:03:36.599> wanna<00:03:36.930> pet

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:37.109 
two more of them I've never wanna pet

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:38.809 
two more of them I've never wanna pet
multiple<00:03:37.530> and<00:03:38.010> I'm<00:03:38.280> still<00:03:38.459> going<00:03:38.579> to<00:03:38.669> create

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:38.819 
multiple and I'm still going to create

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:42.080 
multiple and I'm still going to create
my<00:03:38.970> VMs<00:03:39.389> in<00:03:39.510> this<00:03:39.629> thing<00:03:40.430> then<00:03:41.430> there's<00:03:41.669> two

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
my VMs in this thing then there's two

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.110 
my VMs in this thing then there's two
routes<00:03:42.510> to<00:03:42.840> use<00:03:43.079> this<00:03:43.430> so<00:03:44.430> let's<00:03:44.609> say<00:03:44.760> I<00:03:44.849> still

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
routes to use this so let's say I still

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.839 
routes to use this so let's say I still
have<00:03:45.359> my<00:03:45.540> own<00:03:45.659> premise<00:03:46.049> over<00:03:46.919> here<00:03:47.159> maybe<00:03:47.790> I

00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:47.849 
have my own premise over here maybe I

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:51.080 
have my own premise over here maybe I
have<00:03:47.940> multiple<00:03:48.389> on-premises<00:03:49.019> and<00:03:49.639> I<00:03:50.639> have<00:03:50.970> my

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
have multiple on-premises and I have my

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.000 
have multiple on-premises and I have my
virtual<00:03:51.299> machines<00:03:51.810> so<00:03:52.290> it<00:03:52.379> might<00:03:52.530> be<00:03:52.680> a<00:03:52.739> mess

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
virtual machines so it might be a mess

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.289 
virtual machines so it might be a mess
I've<00:03:53.400> lots<00:03:53.639> of<00:03:53.790> them<00:03:55.459> so<00:03:56.459> there's<00:03:56.609> two<00:03:56.940> modes

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 
I've lots of them so there's two modes

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:01.009 
I've lots of them so there's two modes
in<00:03:57.629> which<00:03:57.750> Express<00:03:58.229> ramp<00:03:58.530> is<00:03:58.650> gonna<00:03:58.829> work<00:04:00.019> one

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.019 
in which Express ramp is gonna work one

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:04.610 
in which Express ramp is gonna work one
of<00:04:01.169> them<00:04:01.349> is<00:04:02.010> we<00:04:02.280> use<00:04:02.430> an<00:04:02.579> IXP<00:04:03.060> an<00:04:03.620> internet

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
of them is we use an IXP an internet

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.699 
of them is we use an IXP an internet
exchange<00:04:04.769> provider<00:04:05.489> and<00:04:05.879> this<00:04:06.659> could<00:04:06.959> be<00:04:07.169> some

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
exchange provider and this could be some

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:09.469 
exchange provider and this could be some
like<00:04:07.829> an<00:04:07.949> equinox<00:04:08.430> this<00:04:08.879> is<00:04:09.030> one<00:04:09.180> the<00:04:09.269> major

00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:09.479 
like an equinox this is one the major

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:11.809 
like an equinox this is one the major
ones<00:04:09.780> that's<00:04:09.959> going<00:04:10.290> with<00:04:10.409> initially<00:04:10.919> I<00:04:11.129> think

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:11.819 
ones that's going with initially I think

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:16.390 
ones that's going with initially I think
this<00:04:12.060> is<00:04:12.180> a<00:04:12.209> fiber<00:04:12.810> hotel<00:04:13.470> this<00:04:14.310> is<00:04:14.519> a<00:04:14.729> location

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
this is a fiber hotel this is a location

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.509 
this is a fiber hotel this is a location
this<00:04:17.400> is<00:04:17.699> the<00:04:17.820> ISP<00:04:18.449> and<00:04:19.279> essentially<00:04:20.279> their

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
this is the ISP and essentially their

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:23.240 
this is the ISP and essentially their
connectivity<00:04:21.450> to<00:04:21.630> all<00:04:21.779> the<00:04:22.019> major<00:04:22.229> ISPs<00:04:22.950> over

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
connectivity to all the major ISPs over

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.560 
connectivity to all the major ISPs over
the<00:04:23.550> Comcast<00:04:24.150> of<00:04:24.479> rise<00:04:24.779> ins

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
the Comcast of rise ins

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:29.010 
the Comcast of rise ins
they<00:04:25.870> all<00:04:25.990> connect<00:04:26.290> into<00:04:26.590> this<00:04:27.030> and<00:04:28.030> Microsoft

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
they all connect into this and Microsoft

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:30.120 
they all connect into this and Microsoft
are<00:04:29.110> going<00:04:29.260> to<00:04:29.320> connect<00:04:29.530> into<00:04:29.710> them<00:04:29.950> so

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.130 
are going to connect into them so

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:31.860 
are going to connect into them so
directly<00:04:30.520> in<00:04:30.610> their<00:04:30.760> out<00:04:30.970> of<00:04:31.150> data<00:04:31.300> centers

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870 
directly in their out of data centers

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:33.840 
directly in their out of data centers
are<00:04:32.020> now<00:04:32.350> going<00:04:32.530> to<00:04:32.590> connect<00:04:32.950> in<00:04:33.160> great<00:04:33.610> big

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:33.850 
are now going to connect in great big

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:37.680 
are now going to connect in great big
fat<00:04:34.150> pipes<00:04:34.650> connecting<00:04:35.650> into<00:04:35.920> this<00:04:36.070> IXP<00:04:36.730> so

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
fat pipes connecting into this IXP so

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:39.420 
fat pipes connecting into this IXP so
now<00:04:37.810> it's<00:04:38.020> an<00:04:38.110> organization<00:04:38.890> you<00:04:38.980> have<00:04:39.100> two

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
now it's an organization you have two

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.360 
now it's an organization you have two
ways<00:04:39.700> to<00:04:39.760> use<00:04:40.210> this<00:04:40.420> either<00:04:41.140> you<00:04:42.070> can<00:04:42.220> actually

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370 
ways to use this either you can actually

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.030 
ways to use this either you can actually
in<00:04:42.670> host<00:04:42.970> your<00:04:43.600> infrastructure<00:04:44.290> at<00:04:44.590> one<00:04:44.920> of

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:45.040 
in host your infrastructure at one of

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.610 
in host your infrastructure at one of
these<00:04:45.100> IXP<00:04:45.700> points<00:04:46.120> so<00:04:46.900> I<00:04:46.960> actually<00:04:47.110> host<00:04:47.410> my

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:47.620 
these IXP points so I actually host my

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.100 
these IXP points so I actually host my
servers<00:04:48.040> might<00:04:48.190> be<00:04:48.340> end<00:04:48.520> inside<00:04:49.330> that<00:04:49.630> partner

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
servers might be end inside that partner

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.640 
servers might be end inside that partner
so<00:04:51.100> I<00:04:51.130> get<00:04:51.400> very<00:04:51.760> fast<00:04:52.120> productivity<00:04:52.930> the

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:53.650 
so I get very fast productivity the

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:56.340 
so I get very fast productivity the
other<00:04:53.890> option<00:04:54.370> is<00:04:54.520> I<00:04:54.790> get<00:04:55.420> private<00:04:56.080> fiber

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:56.350 
other option is I get private fiber

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:59.040 
other option is I get private fiber
connections<00:04:57.040> from<00:04:57.280> my<00:04:57.490> premise<00:04:57.910> into<00:04:58.750> that<00:04:58.870> by

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
connections from my premise into that by

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:02.580 
connections from my premise into that by
XP<00:04:59.500> and<00:05:00.310> then<00:05:00.910> they<00:05:01.120> all<00:05:01.360> handle<00:05:01.960> the<00:05:02.050> routing

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590 
XP and then they all handle the routing

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:05.640 
XP and then they all handle the routing
into<00:05:03.070> Windows<00:05:03.370> Azure<00:05:03.670> and<00:05:04.320> I<00:05:05.320> can<00:05:05.440> actually

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:05.650 
into Windows Azure and I can actually

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:07.350 
into Windows Azure and I can actually
have<00:05:05.770> the<00:05:05.920> 10<00:05:06.160> gigabits<00:05:06.580> per<00:05:06.700> second<00:05:07.120> here<00:05:07.270> so

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 
have the 10 gigabits per second here so

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:08.700 
have the 10 gigabits per second here so
I've<00:05:07.480> gone<00:05:07.570> from<00:05:07.630> that<00:05:07.870> hundred<00:05:08.260> megabits<00:05:08.590> per

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:08.710 
I've gone from that hundred megabits per

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:11.580 
I've gone from that hundred megabits per
second<00:05:09.190> with<00:05:09.280> a<00:05:09.370> site-to-site<00:05:09.610> VPN<00:05:10.290> to<00:05:11.290> 10

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:11.590

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:13.290 
second with a site-to-site VPN to 10
gigabits<00:05:12.130> per<00:05:12.250> second<00:05:12.640> now<00:05:12.730> I'm<00:05:12.880> gonna<00:05:13.000> play

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:13.300 
gigabits per second now I'm gonna play

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.600 
gigabits per second now I'm gonna play
there's<00:05:13.840> different<00:05:14.230> rates<00:05:14.920> you<00:05:15.190> can<00:05:15.400> select

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:15.610 
there's different rates you can select

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:17.250 
there's different rates you can select
obviously<00:05:16.180> the<00:05:16.270> faster<00:05:16.630> the<00:05:16.720> speed<00:05:16.810> the<00:05:17.080> more

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:17.260 
obviously the faster the speed the more

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.820 
obviously the faster the speed the more
you're<00:05:17.350> gonna<00:05:17.470> pay<00:05:17.910> but<00:05:18.910> now<00:05:19.440> this<00:05:20.440> is<00:05:20.620> not

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:20.830 
you're gonna pay but now this is not

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:22.380 
you're gonna pay but now this is not
going<00:05:21.010> over<00:05:21.220> the<00:05:21.400> internet<00:05:21.730> this<00:05:21.940> is<00:05:22.120> going

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:22.390 
going over the internet this is going

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:24.000 
going over the internet this is going
over<00:05:22.600> the<00:05:22.660> private<00:05:22.900> network<00:05:23.200> so<00:05:23.650> I'm<00:05:23.740> going

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:24.010 
over the private network so I'm going

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:26.580 
over the private network so I'm going
via<00:05:24.370> this<00:05:24.550> IXP<00:05:25.300> so<00:05:25.990> it's<00:05:26.080> a<00:05:26.140> great<00:05:26.320> solution

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:26.590 
via this IXP so it's a great solution

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:28.860 
via this IXP so it's a great solution
that's<00:05:27.250> from<00:05:27.610> my<00:05:27.820> entire<00:05:28.270> Azure<00:05:28.750> cloud

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:28.870 
that's from my entire Azure cloud

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:31.080 
that's from my entire Azure cloud
subscription<00:05:29.200> and<00:05:29.770> I<00:05:30.100> pick<00:05:30.430> which<00:05:30.640> virtual

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:31.090 
subscription and I pick which virtual

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:32.820 
subscription and I pick which virtual
next<00:05:31.390> work<00:05:31.810> should<00:05:32.020> be<00:05:32.110> included<00:05:32.530> in<00:05:32.590> that

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:32.830 
next work should be included in that

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:35.130 
next work should be included in that
so<00:05:33.580> my<00:05:33.730> on-premise<00:05:34.300> locations<00:05:34.870> this<00:05:35.020> is

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:35.140 
so my on-premise locations this is

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:39.060 
so my on-premise locations this is
expressed<00:05:35.560> as<00:05:35.740> is<00:05:35.920> one<00:05:36.190> of<00:05:36.310> the<00:05:36.430> options<00:05:38.070> the

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:39.070 
expressed as is one of the options the

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:40.880 
expressed as is one of the options the
other<00:05:39.220> option

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:40.890 
other option

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:43.830 
other option
once<00:05:41.890> again<00:05:42.070> I<00:05:42.460> have<00:05:42.820> my<00:05:42.970> Windows<00:05:43.300> Azure<00:05:43.570> cloud

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:43.840 
once again I have my Windows Azure cloud

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:49.080 
once again I have my Windows Azure cloud
service<00:05:44.440> I<00:05:45.030> have<00:05:46.030> my<00:05:46.180> virtual<00:05:46.600> network<00:05:46.900> and<00:05:48.090> I

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:49.090 
service I have my virtual network and I

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:53.940 
service I have my virtual network and I
have<00:05:49.270> my<00:05:49.390> own<00:05:49.420> premises<00:05:51.120> but<00:05:52.120> maybe<00:05:52.330> today<00:05:52.950> I'm

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:53.950 
have my own premises but maybe today I'm

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:57.630 
have my own premises but maybe today I'm
using<00:05:54.310> my<00:05:54.700> curve<00:05:55.030> an<00:05:55.330> att<00:05:55.990> a<00:05:56.200> VPN<00:05:56.800> an<00:05:56.980> MPLS

00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:57.640 
using my curve an att a VPN an MPLS

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:00.720 
using my curve an att a VPN an MPLS
cloud<00:05:57.970> so<00:05:58.720> actually<00:05:59.020> what<00:05:59.200> happens<00:05:59.710> is<00:05:59.860> I<00:06:00.250> have

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:00.730 
cloud so actually what happens is I have

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:06.290 
cloud so actually what happens is I have
this<00:06:00.880> big<00:06:01.210> MPLS<00:06:02.170> cloud<00:06:02.820> that<00:06:03.820> count<00:06:04.090> yun<00:06:04.330> using

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:06.300 
this big MPLS cloud that count yun using

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:08.820 
this big MPLS cloud that count yun using
which<00:06:07.300> all<00:06:07.570> my<00:06:07.810> different<00:06:08.140> locations<00:06:08.650> just

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:08.830 
which all my different locations just

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:11.820 
which all my different locations just
connect<00:06:09.220> to<00:06:09.400> from<00:06:09.610> this<00:06:09.760> MPLS<00:06:10.620> windows<00:06:11.620> azure

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:11.830 
connect to from this MPLS windows azure

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:15.300 
connect to from this MPLS windows azure
can<00:06:12.280> now<00:06:12.400> participate<00:06:12.700> in<00:06:13.420> their<00:06:13.780> MPLS<00:06:14.410> so

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:15.310 
can now participate in their MPLS so

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:16.650 
can now participate in their MPLS so
what<00:06:15.400> this<00:06:15.520> now<00:06:15.730> means<00:06:16.060> is<00:06:16.270> I<00:06:16.300> don't<00:06:16.540> really

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:16.660 
what this now means is I don't really

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:17.820 
what this now means is I don't really
have<00:06:16.780> to<00:06:16.870> change<00:06:17.080> anything

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:17.830 
have to change anything

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:20.640 
have to change anything
all<00:06:18.130> of<00:06:18.370> a<00:06:18.430> sudden<00:06:18.460> Windows<00:06:19.210> Azure<00:06:19.570> is<00:06:20.290> just

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:20.650 
all of a sudden Windows Azure is just

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:22.830 
all of a sudden Windows Azure is just
going<00:06:20.830> to<00:06:20.920> become<00:06:21.340> part<00:06:21.700> of<00:06:21.850> the<00:06:21.970> MPLS<00:06:22.630> I'm

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:22.840 
going to become part of the MPLS I'm

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:25.350 
going to become part of the MPLS I'm
already<00:06:23.110> using<00:06:23.650> so<00:06:24.190> AT&amp;T<00:06:24.790> is<00:06:24.910> the<00:06:25.030> partner

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:25.360 
already using so AT&amp;T is the partner

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:26.940 
already using so AT&amp;T is the partner
initially<00:06:25.780> but<00:06:25.990> again<00:06:26.170> that<00:06:26.350> will<00:06:26.500> grow<00:06:26.680> over

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:26.950 
initially but again that will grow over

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:29.940 
initially but again that will grow over
time<00:06:27.300> so<00:06:28.300> now<00:06:28.480> my<00:06:28.720> on-premise<00:06:29.290> locations

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:29.950 
time so now my on-premise locations

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:31.620 
time so now my on-premise locations
through<00:06:30.250> that<00:06:30.430> that<00:06:30.880> match<00:06:31.180> they<00:06:31.360> can<00:06:31.510> just

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:31.630 
through that that match they can just

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:34.409 
through that that match they can just
all<00:06:31.810> communicate<00:06:32.320> anyway<00:06:33.000> will<00:06:34.000> now<00:06:34.150> extend

00:06:34.409 --> 00:06:34.419 
all communicate anyway will now extend

00:06:34.419 --> 00:06:36.990 
all communicate anyway will now extend
into<00:06:34.930> Windows<00:06:35.380> Azure<00:06:35.650> and<00:06:36.220> kind<00:06:36.850> of<00:06:36.910> thing

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:37.000 
into Windows Azure and kind of thing

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.610 
into Windows Azure and kind of thing
that's<00:06:37.150> up<00:06:37.240> to<00:06:37.360> 1<00:06:37.540> gigabit<00:06:37.570> per<00:06:38.140> second<00:06:38.410> again

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:38.620 
that's up to 1 gigabit per second again

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:39.990 
that's up to 1 gigabit per second again
these<00:06:38.740> numbers<00:06:38.979> will<00:06:39.100> all<00:06:39.160> change<00:06:39.460> over<00:06:39.790> time

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:40.000 
these numbers will all change over time

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.090 
these numbers will all change over time
and<00:06:40.240> I<00:06:40.570> can<00:06:40.930> do<00:06:41.020> different<00:06:41.169> increments<00:06:41.740> of

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:42.100 
and I can do different increments of

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:44.430 
and I can do different increments of
speed<00:06:42.400> I<00:06:42.430> obviously<00:06:42.880> pay<00:06:43.210> more<00:06:43.570> for<00:06:43.840> the

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:44.440 
speed I obviously pay more for the

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:48.270 
speed I obviously pay more for the
faster<00:06:44.860> the<00:06:44.979> speed<00:06:46.350> but<00:06:47.350> this<00:06:47.470> is<00:06:47.620> the<00:06:47.770> second

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:48.280 
faster the speed but this is the second

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:49.590 
faster the speed but this is the second
way<00:06:48.430> of<00:06:48.460> using<00:06:48.790> the<00:06:49.030> Express<00:06:49.360> route

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:49.600 
way of using the Express route

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:53.189 
way of using the Express route
technology<00:06:50.260> so<00:06:50.410> again<00:06:50.680> I<00:06:50.889> can<00:06:51.520> use<00:06:51.550> an<00:06:51.729> IXP<00:06:52.199> so

00:06:53.189 --> 00:06:53.199 
technology so again I can use an IXP so

00:06:53.199 --> 00:06:54.150 
technology so again I can use an IXP so
I<00:06:53.290> see<00:06:53.410> I'm<00:06:53.530> going<00:06:53.620> to<00:06:53.680> have<00:06:53.770> a<00:06:53.860> fiber

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:54.160 
I see I'm going to have a fiber

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:57.000 
I see I'm going to have a fiber

about that connectivity and what I've

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:32.520 
about that connectivity and what I've

some frequently asked questions around
this<00:07:37.240> and<00:07:37.510> more<00:07:38.139> details<00:07:38.560> on<00:07:38.740> the<00:07:38.830> pricing<00:07:39.370> so

00:07:39.689 --> 00:07:39.699 
this and more details on the pricing so

00:07:39.699 --> 00:07:40.890 
this and more details on the pricing so
you<00:07:39.760> can<00:07:39.880> go<00:07:39.970> and<00:07:40.150> actually<00:07:40.330> get<00:07:40.660> that<00:07:40.810> for

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:40.900 
you can go and actually get that for

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:42.870 
you can go and actually get that for
yourselves<00:07:41.199> so<00:07:41.560> I<00:07:42.490> hope<00:07:42.610> this<00:07:42.700> was<00:07:42.820> useful

hopefully<00:07:43.690> you<00:07:43.810> see<00:07:43.960> how<00:07:43.990> Express<00:07:44.680> route<00:07:44.860> is

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:45.010 
hopefully you see how Express route is

00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:46.320 
hopefully you see how Express route is
kind<00:07:45.220> of<00:07:45.310> fitting<00:07:45.520> into<00:07:45.760> that<00:07:45.940> connectivity

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:46.330 
kind of fitting into that connectivity

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:48.600 
kind of fitting into that connectivity
and<00:07:46.750> I<00:07:47.530> appreciate<00:07:47.950> your<00:07:48.039> time<00:07:48.160> thank<00:07:48.370> you
