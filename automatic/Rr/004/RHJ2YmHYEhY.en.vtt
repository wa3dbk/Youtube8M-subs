00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.560
 have a theme and has mainz has 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.029
 challenged me did not say 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:41.399
 I have not heard of the arguments 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:01:02.280
 This was somehow arm wrestling music 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:01:06.470
 shit is off the chair the chair is on 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.470
 we are sitting here on the ring 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:14.900
 you can never opel co2 what are you doing 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:22.680
 slips but it remains easy I have 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:25.860
 you pulled here nico nico lose 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:37.040
 I mean rather to surf can I 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:40.470
 really think now left comes now 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:44.670
 The question is how is it going to get behind 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.960
 itself as well as the comic I'm doing is 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:57.180
 I Carry slowly speak the shoulder 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:02:00.380
 otherwise that's just there you are it too 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.380
 Will be well taken care of if you have this 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:05.390
 I would like that mechanism 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.220
 bring shoulder 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.869
 You see, it's a really bad one 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.910
 here is no recognized and his 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.740
 it's only the camera's fault 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.330
 I turned to them that was just 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.709
 myself with me around here now 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.910
 You can not try and think 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:18.950
 Last time I can do that strong 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.140
 slowly you cant do it i did 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.910
 with nobody with half strength simply 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.130
 june this time with half strength 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.140
 I said yes I am myself look 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:31.610
 if I sat down here now 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:33.770
 people that people here 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:37.310
 I have to turn me here now 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:38.530
 on the left I have to do something like that and 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.450
 it is very hard for me 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:45.560
 now nico did not squeeze me 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:47.600
 maybe it could win but the 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.790
 thing is people moving in is very 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.500
 important that here opposite each other 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.720
 sit if you fool your opponent 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.300
 as well as having just done that 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.860
 so that could not defeat me nico 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:01.250
 we can do that now too 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:03.410
 but if ever someone does 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.300
 we start winning well then uses 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.100
 this trick and understand the whole 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.180
 understands correctly and does one thing 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.310
 you had won 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:14.709
 Come on, let me just come here for a while 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:19.250
 even then the whole thing has moment 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:20.660
 hand and foot what do I ask questions 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:38.239
 yes actually that here in the official 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:39.530
 cards were left with I can 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:40.760
 do not put pressure on him always a lot 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.709
 you can see 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.030
 that is i have not serious enough me 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:45.800
 did not want to embarrass 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.700
 I do not know if you can see that mounted 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:51.200
 the 22 screws 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.790
 Well people until then if you still 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.080
 want to have more other tips other 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.150

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.370

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:00.080
 fair relationship fair conditions 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:03.380
 Framework conditions made want 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:04.940
 we have before I kick and here 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:08.300
 around head and collar 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:12.560

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:13.970
 Whole time shopping and we have 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.519
 We bought a few things here 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:18.919
 nico who would like to be with it 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:20.980

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:27.110
 bought drinks 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.940
 The calories I have almost always there 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.710
 I'm in favor if you do something 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:32.300
 then I always have to do it myself 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.370
 assemble that always means yourself 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.440
 mix together that means when I buy 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:39.100

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.100
