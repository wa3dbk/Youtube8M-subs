00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
probably some kind of driver issue not

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.010 
probably some kind of driver issue not
totally<00:00:17.340> sure<00:00:17.400> but<00:00:17.820> I<00:00:18.000> do<00:00:18.060> know<00:00:18.270> how<00:00:18.539> to<00:00:18.600> fix<00:00:18.810> it

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
totally sure but I do know how to fix it

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.679 
totally sure but I do know how to fix it
so<00:00:19.560> as<00:00:20.460> far<00:00:20.640> as<00:00:20.760> I<00:00:20.850> know<00:00:20.910> this<00:00:21.210> will<00:00:21.359> work<00:00:21.539> on

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
so as far as I know this will work on

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.290 
so as far as I know this will work on
Ubuntu<00:00:22.170> and<00:00:22.439> other<00:00:23.160> distributions<00:00:23.850> based<00:00:24.060> on

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
Ubuntu and other distributions based on

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.109 
Ubuntu and other distributions based on
Ubuntu<00:00:24.480> so<00:00:25.380> I<00:00:25.800> can't<00:00:26.189> back<00:00:26.490> that<00:00:26.699> up<00:00:26.789> a<00:00:26.880> hundred

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
Ubuntu so I can't back that up a hundred

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.320 
Ubuntu so I can't back that up a hundred
percent<00:00:27.769> so<00:00:28.769> it's<00:00:29.160> worth<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.400> shot<00:00:29.730> I'll<00:00:30.179> give

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
percent so it's worth the shot I'll give

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.840 
percent so it's worth the shot I'll give
it<00:00:30.420> a<00:00:30.480> try<00:00:30.660> and<00:00:30.900> if<00:00:30.990> you<00:00:31.080> don't<00:00:31.230> have<00:00:31.399> and<00:00:32.399> just

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.490 
it a try and if you don't have and just
drill<00:00:33.030> like<00:00:33.180> that<00:00:33.360> just<00:00:33.600> give<00:00:34.230> it<00:00:34.320> a<00:00:34.410> try

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
drill like that just give it a try

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.590 
drill like that just give it a try

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
um I got this one here because it works

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.810 
um I got this one here because it works
that's<00:01:19.500> why<00:01:19.740> I<00:01:19.770> didn't<00:01:20.040> get<00:01:20.130> this<00:01:20.310> one<00:01:20.520> so

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
that's why I didn't get this one so

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.670 
that's why I didn't get this one so
that's<00:01:21.060> pretty<00:01:21.330> good<00:01:21.630> reason<00:01:21.960> right<00:01:22.110> um<00:01:22.380> so
