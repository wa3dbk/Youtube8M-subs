00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
hello my name is angel richards and

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:06.980 
hello my name is angel richards and
today<00:00:05.819> i'm<00:00:06.120> gonna<00:00:06.210> be<00:00:06.300> talking<00:00:06.359> a<00:00:06.689> little<00:00:06.779> bit

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
today i'm gonna be talking a little bit

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.070 
today i'm gonna be talking a little bit
about<00:00:07.080> how<00:00:07.769> you<00:00:08.010> select<00:00:08.490> the<00:00:08.849> basic<00:00:09.080> different

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
about how you select the basic different

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.840 
about how you select the basic different
types<00:00:10.260> of<00:00:10.410> implant<00:00:10.740> which<00:00:11.130> rather<00:00:11.310> rounding

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:11.850 
types of implant which rather rounding

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:13.640 
types of implant which rather rounding
Palast<00:00:12.120> or<00:00:12.450> teardrop<00:00:12.750> shape<00:00:13.140> to<00:00:13.320> implants

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
Palast or teardrop shape to implants

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.550 
Palast or teardrop shape to implants
okay<00:00:14.309> so<00:00:14.760> this<00:00:15.090> is<00:00:15.240> a<00:00:15.269> round<00:00:15.540> implant<00:00:16.109> you<00:00:16.379> can

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
okay so this is a round implant you can

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.250 
okay so this is a round implant you can
see<00:00:16.769> from<00:00:17.189> the<00:00:17.359> cross-section<00:00:18.359> this<00:00:18.810> bit<00:00:19.019> goes

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
see from the cross-section this bit goes

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.420 
see from the cross-section this bit goes
against<00:00:19.619> the<00:00:19.710> chest<00:00:19.890> of<00:00:20.010> all<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.220> flat

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
against the chest of all the flat

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.730 
against the chest of all the flat
section<00:00:20.730> and<00:00:21.150> then<00:00:21.630> from<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:22.020> cross<00:00:22.410> section

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
section and then from the cross section

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.950 
section and then from the cross section
you<00:00:22.770> can<00:00:22.949> see<00:00:23.100> around<00:00:23.190> in<00:00:23.610> blood<00:00:23.850> is<00:00:24.539> sort<00:00:24.869> of

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
you can see around in blood is sort of

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.160 
you can see around in blood is sort of
curved<00:00:25.260> dome<00:00:25.680> shaped<00:00:26.130> up<00:00:26.940> so<00:00:27.420> in<00:00:27.600> any<00:00:27.900> way<00:00:28.109> you

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
curved dome shaped up so in any way you

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.209 
curved dome shaped up so in any way you
turn<00:00:28.470> it<00:00:28.680> it<00:00:28.859> will<00:00:29.039> so<00:00:29.279> be<00:00:29.310> domed<00:00:30.170> okay

00:00:31.209 --> 00:00:31.219 
turn it it will so be domed okay

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:33.709 
turn it it will so be domed okay
teardrop<00:00:32.219> showed<00:00:32.579> him<00:00:33.090> a<00:00:33.120> lot<00:00:33.239> on<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.660> other

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
teardrop showed him a lot on the other

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.080 
teardrop showed him a lot on the other
hand<00:00:34.140> is<00:00:34.649> this<00:00:35.190> is<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.430> obviously<00:00:35.760> up<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:35.940> bit

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
hand is this is the obviously up a bit

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.299 
hand is this is the obviously up a bit
facing<00:00:36.540> your<00:00:36.690> chin<00:00:37.290> this<00:00:37.710> is<00:00:37.890> a<00:00:37.920> little<00:00:38.190> bit

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
facing your chin this is a little bit

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.580 
facing your chin this is a little bit
facing<00:00:38.730> your<00:00:38.790> tummy<00:00:39.030> button<00:00:39.300> is<00:00:39.660> sort<00:00:40.410> of<00:00:40.500> a

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
facing your tummy button is sort of a

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.459 
facing your tummy button is sort of a
much<00:00:40.770> flatter<00:00:41.250> in<00:00:41.730> this<00:00:41.940> part<00:00:42.270> portion<00:00:42.540> here

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
much flatter in this part portion here

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.520 
much flatter in this part portion here
and<00:00:43.620> much<00:00:44.130> more<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:45.180> simulate<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.840> natural

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
and much more to simulate the natural

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.119 
and much more to simulate the natural
appearance<00:00:46.980> of<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.450> breast<00:00:48.450> okay<00:00:49.200> so<00:00:49.710> both

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
appearance of the breast okay so both

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.000 
appearance of the breast okay so both
implants<00:00:50.790> have<00:00:50.910> a<00:00:50.940> lot<00:00:51.090> of<00:00:51.590> similarities<00:00:52.590> both

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
implants have a lot of similarities both

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.979 
implants have a lot of similarities both
the<00:00:53.219> textures<00:00:53.820> that<00:00:53.969> means<00:00:54.239> s<00:00:54.360> slightly<00:00:54.539> furry

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
the textures that means s slightly furry

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.590 
the textures that means s slightly furry
the<00:00:55.620> reason<00:00:55.920> we<00:00:56.010> use<00:00:56.039> that<00:00:56.219> textured<00:00:57.090> implants

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
the reason we use that textured implants

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.090 
the reason we use that textured implants
that<00:00:57.750> is<00:00:57.809> because<00:00:58.140> they've<00:00:58.289> been<00:00:58.410> shown<00:00:58.620> to<00:00:59.039> a

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
that is because they've been shown to a

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.830 
that is because they've been shown to a
much<00:00:59.280> lower<00:00:59.489> rate<00:00:59.760> of<00:00:59.789> capsular<00:01:00.329> contracture

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
much lower rate of capsular contracture

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.630 
much lower rate of capsular contracture
than<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.530> smooth<00:01:01.739> implants<00:01:02.219> which<00:01:02.340> we<00:01:02.460> used

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
than the smooth implants which we used

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.939 
than the smooth implants which we used
20<00:01:02.969> years<00:01:03.180> ago<00:01:03.439> capsular<00:01:04.439> contracture<00:01:04.799> is

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
20 years ago capsular contracture is

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.590 
20 years ago capsular contracture is
when<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.129> body<00:01:05.280> sort<00:01:05.850> of<00:01:05.939> falls<00:01:06.119> off<00:01:06.420> the

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
when the body sort of falls off the

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.690 
when the body sort of falls off the
implant<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:07.200> they<00:01:07.590> think<00:01:07.979> you<00:01:08.069> go<00:01:08.219> hard<00:01:08.249> which

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
implant and they think you go hard which

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.539 
implant and they think you go hard which
occurs<00:01:08.969> in<00:01:09.119> about<00:01:09.499> less<00:01:10.499> than<00:01:10.709> 30<00:01:11.249> percent<00:01:11.310> of

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
occurs in about less than 30 percent of

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.340 
occurs in about less than 30 percent of
cases<00:01:11.700> with<00:01:12.060> these<00:01:12.209> latest<00:01:12.630> texture<00:01:13.139> didn't

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
cases with these latest texture didn't

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:13.699 
cases with these latest texture didn't
last

00:01:13.699 --> 00:01:13.709 
last

00:01:13.709 --> 00:01:17.510 
last
okay<00:01:14.340> so<00:01:14.789> we've<00:01:14.969> got<00:01:14.999> a<00:01:15.450> shaped<00:01:16.380> implant<00:01:16.829> round

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
okay so we've got a shaped implant round

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.249 
okay so we've got a shaped implant round
inclined<00:01:17.969> now<00:01:18.329> how<00:01:18.719> do<00:01:18.779> you<00:01:18.899> choose<00:01:19.079> which

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
inclined now how do you choose which

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.679 
inclined now how do you choose which
one's<00:01:19.499> best<00:01:19.709> for<00:01:19.889> you<00:01:20.039> well<00:01:20.310> basically<00:01:20.909> shaped

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
one's best for you well basically shaped

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.569 
one's best for you well basically shaped
implants<00:01:22.170> tend<00:01:22.679> to<00:01:22.740> be<00:01:22.829> used<00:01:23.009> on<00:01:23.159> people<00:01:23.340> with

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:23.579 
implants tend to be used on people with

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:26.239 
implants tend to be used on people with
less<00:01:23.789> natural<00:01:24.270> breast<00:01:24.509> tissue<00:01:24.749> okay<00:01:25.619> so<00:01:26.130> the

00:01:26.239 --> 00:01:26.249 
less natural breast tissue okay so the

00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:28.639 
less natural breast tissue okay so the
test<00:01:26.520> is<00:01:26.729> again<00:01:26.999> the<00:01:27.149> camera<00:01:27.450> test<00:01:27.810> and<00:01:28.439> what

00:01:28.639 --> 00:01:28.649 
test is again the camera test and what

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:31.190 
test is again the camera test and what
you<00:01:28.770> need<00:01:28.920> to<00:01:29.069> do<00:01:29.249> is<00:01:29.579> measure<00:01:29.969> the<00:01:30.179> amount<00:01:31.079> of

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
you need to do is measure the amount of

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.349 
you need to do is measure the amount of
natural<00:01:31.590> breast<00:01:31.799> tissue<00:01:32.009> you've<00:01:32.369> got<00:01:32.669> okay<00:01:33.299> so

00:01:33.349 --> 00:01:33.359 
natural breast tissue you've got okay so

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:35.599 
natural breast tissue you've got okay so
we<00:01:33.569> do<00:01:33.689> this<00:01:33.869> with<00:01:34.049> a<00:01:34.079> caliper<00:01:34.499> measuring<00:01:35.459> your

00:01:35.599 --> 00:01:35.609 
we do this with a caliper measuring your

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:37.879 
we do this with a caliper measuring your
natural<00:01:35.999> breast<00:01:36.179> tissue<00:01:36.419> in<00:01:37.109> the<00:01:37.289> back<00:01:37.529> part

00:01:37.879 --> 00:01:37.889 
natural breast tissue in the back part

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:40.190 
natural breast tissue in the back part
of<00:01:38.099> the<00:01:38.189> breast<00:01:38.429> okay<00:01:38.999> so<00:01:39.630> when<00:01:39.810> we<00:01:39.929> measure

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
of the breast okay so when we measure

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.289 
of the breast okay so when we measure
that<00:01:40.560> we're<00:01:40.889> actually<00:01:41.009> taking<00:01:41.340> in<00:01:41.639> two<00:01:41.909> skin

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
that we're actually taking in two skin

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.870 
that we're actually taking in two skin
thicknesses<00:01:42.840> so<00:01:43.049> two<00:01:43.459> thicknesses<00:01:44.459> of<00:01:44.849> the

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
thicknesses so two thicknesses of the

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.940 
thicknesses so two thicknesses of the
breast<00:01:45.179> tissue<00:01:45.389> so<00:01:46.139> if<00:01:46.200> we<00:01:46.319> measure<00:01:46.529> this<00:01:46.709> is

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
breast tissue so if we measure this is

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.849 
breast tissue so if we measure this is
and<00:01:47.099> over<00:01:47.789> two<00:01:47.969> centimeters<00:01:48.749> that<00:01:49.259> means<00:01:49.319> that

00:01:49.849 --> 00:01:49.859 
and over two centimeters that means that

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:52.039 
and over two centimeters that means that
you've<00:01:50.009> got<00:01:50.279> one<00:01:50.789> centimeter<00:01:51.419> from<00:01:51.569> natural

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
you've got one centimeter from natural

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.229 
you've got one centimeter from natural
breast<00:01:52.229> tissue<00:01:52.439> covering<00:01:53.069> the<00:01:53.219> implant<00:01:53.579> okay

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:54.239 
breast tissue covering the implant okay

00:01:54.239 --> 00:01:57.559 
breast tissue covering the implant okay
so<00:01:54.840> if<00:01:55.109> your<00:01:55.770> pinch<00:01:56.009> is<00:01:56.279> over<00:01:56.729> two<00:01:56.880> centimeters

00:01:57.559 --> 00:01:57.569 
so if your pinch is over two centimeters

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:00.529 
so if your pinch is over two centimeters
we<00:01:57.899> tend<00:01:58.200> to<00:01:58.289> think<00:01:58.729> long<00:01:59.729> lines<00:01:59.969> and<00:02:00.119> around

00:02:00.529 --> 00:02:00.539 
we tend to think long lines and around

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:03.499 
we tend to think long lines and around
in<00:02:00.899> blood<00:02:01.349> okay<00:02:02.159> if<00:02:02.429> you've<00:02:02.849> got<00:02:02.999> under<00:02:03.209> two

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
in blood okay if you've got under two

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.479 
in blood okay if you've got under two
centimetres<00:02:04.229> of<00:02:04.289> natural<00:02:04.709> breast<00:02:04.950> tissue<00:02:05.159> I

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:05.489 
centimetres of natural breast tissue I

00:02:05.489 --> 00:02:06.679 
centimetres of natural breast tissue I
tend<00:02:05.939> to<00:02:06.029> think

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
tend to think

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.919 
tend to think
the<00:02:06.960> lines<00:02:07.499> of<00:02:07.799> a<00:02:07.950> shaped<00:02:08.310> implant<00:02:08.789> now<00:02:09.330> what's

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
the lines of a shaped implant now what's

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.420 
the lines of a shaped implant now what's
the<00:02:10.080> reason<00:02:10.470> for<00:02:10.500> that<00:02:10.649> the<00:02:10.920> reason<00:02:11.009> to<00:02:11.340> that

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
the reason for that the reason to that

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.430 
the reason for that the reason to that
is<00:02:11.610> if<00:02:11.879> you've<00:02:12.030> got<00:02:12.060> over<00:02:12.569> two<00:02:12.840> centimeters<00:02:13.379> of

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
is if you've got over two centimeters of

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.949 
is if you've got over two centimeters of
natural<00:02:13.830> pinch<00:02:14.190> that's<00:02:14.849> one<00:02:15.180> centimeter<00:02:15.720> of

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
natural pinch that's one centimeter of

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.650 
natural pinch that's one centimeter of
natural<00:02:16.500> breast<00:02:16.860> tissue<00:02:17.400> you've<00:02:18.060> already<00:02:18.239> got

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
natural breast tissue you've already got

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.839 
natural breast tissue you've already got
a<00:02:18.810> reasonable<00:02:19.230> breast<00:02:19.470> volume<00:02:19.680> and<00:02:20.160> probably

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
a reasonable breast volume and probably

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:22.670 
a reasonable breast volume and probably
a<00:02:20.879> reason<00:02:21.209> with<00:02:21.330> brush<00:02:21.510> shapes<00:02:21.810> all<00:02:22.080> they<00:02:22.500> need

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
a reason with brush shapes all they need

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.130 
a reason with brush shapes all they need
to<00:02:22.709> do<00:02:22.950> is<00:02:23.190> augment<00:02:23.670> what<00:02:24.000> you've<00:02:24.330> got<00:02:24.599> to

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
to do is augment what you've got to

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.110 
to do is augment what you've got to
pretend<00:02:25.440> to<00:02:25.560> use<00:02:25.709> around<00:02:25.980> implant<00:02:26.610> which

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
pretend to use around implant which

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.420 
pretend to use around implant which
actually<00:02:27.660> when<00:02:27.870> you<00:02:28.080> sit<00:02:28.830> out<00:02:28.860> when<00:02:29.310> you're

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
actually when you sit out when you're

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.039 
actually when you sit out when you're
vertical<00:02:30.030> does<00:02:30.330> tend<00:02:30.569> to<00:02:30.599> go<00:02:30.750> Sparky

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:31.049 
vertical does tend to go Sparky

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:33.949 
vertical does tend to go Sparky
teardrop-shaped<00:02:31.590> anyway<00:02:32.580> the<00:02:33.299> reasons<00:02:33.780> and

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
teardrop-shaped anyway the reasons and

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.440 
teardrop-shaped anyway the reasons and
advantages<00:02:34.530> of<00:02:34.560> a<00:02:34.890> round<00:02:35.160> implant<00:02:35.670> is<00:02:35.849> as<00:02:36.269> much

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
advantages of a round implant is as much

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.539 
advantages of a round implant is as much
there's<00:02:36.660> no<00:02:36.810> real<00:02:37.110> risk<00:02:37.260> of<00:02:37.500> implant<00:02:37.920> rotation

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:38.549 
there's no real risk of implant rotation

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:41.000 
there's no real risk of implant rotation
because<00:02:39.360> even<00:02:39.900> if<00:02:39.989> the<00:02:40.110> implant<00:02:40.470> ro<00:02:40.620> takes<00:02:40.890> a

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
because even if the implant ro takes a

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.690 
because even if the implant ro takes a
little<00:02:41.220> bit<00:02:42.920> you<00:02:43.920> don't<00:02:44.129> the<00:02:44.220> cause<00:02:44.370> a<00:02:44.400> problem

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
little bit you don't the cause a problem

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.380 
little bit you don't the cause a problem
with<00:02:45.060> the<00:02:45.180> shape<00:02:45.690> of<00:02:45.810> the<00:02:45.900> breast<00:02:46.220> okay<00:02:47.220> now<00:02:48.120> a

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
with the shape of the breast okay now a

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.539 
with the shape of the breast okay now a
teardrop<00:02:48.989> shaped<00:02:49.349> implant<00:02:49.860> as<00:02:50.069> I<00:02:50.099> said<00:02:50.370> is

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:50.549 
teardrop shaped implant as I said is

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:51.979 
teardrop shaped implant as I said is
using<00:02:50.879> people<00:02:51.150> with<00:02:51.239> less<00:02:51.450> breast<00:02:51.720> tissue

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
using people with less breast tissue

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.860 
using people with less breast tissue
with<00:02:52.650> under<00:02:53.040> two<00:02:53.190> centimeters<00:02:53.879> of<00:02:54.060> thickness

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
with under two centimeters of thickness

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.440 
with under two centimeters of thickness
from<00:02:55.769> the<00:02:55.890> reason<00:02:56.190> for<00:02:56.310> that<00:02:56.370> is<00:02:56.640> that<00:02:56.790> what<00:02:57.360> we

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
from the reason for that is that what we

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.030 
from the reason for that is that what we
need<00:02:57.480> to<00:02:57.660> do<00:02:57.750> in<00:02:57.870> that<00:02:57.900> case<00:02:58.170> is<00:02:58.349> really<00:02:58.530> create

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
need to do in that case is really create

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.729 
need to do in that case is really create
the<00:02:59.430> admit<00:02:59.730> the<00:03:00.090> breast<00:03:00.390> shape<00:03:00.599> so<00:03:01.470> for<00:03:01.650> that

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
the admit the breast shape so for that

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:04.190 
the admit the breast shape so for that
in<00:03:02.700> that<00:03:02.970> scenario<00:03:03.269> would<00:03:03.750> use<00:03:03.900> a<00:03:03.930> shape

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
in that scenario would use a shape

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.960 
in that scenario would use a shape
implant<00:03:04.650> which<00:03:05.190> gives<00:03:05.430> us<00:03:05.579> the<00:03:05.760> full

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
implant which gives us the full

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.449 
implant which gives us the full
appearance<00:03:06.780> of<00:03:07.019> the<00:03:07.440> breast<00:03:07.680> now<00:03:08.160> there<00:03:08.310> is<00:03:08.430> a

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
appearance of the breast now there is a

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:10.520 
appearance of the breast now there is a
slightly<00:03:08.819> increased<00:03:09.060> risk<00:03:09.599> of<00:03:09.780> rotation<00:03:10.440> of

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
slightly increased risk of rotation of

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.319 
slightly increased risk of rotation of
the<00:03:10.709> implant<00:03:11.130> so<00:03:11.579> you<00:03:11.639> can<00:03:11.849> see<00:03:12.000> that<00:03:12.209> the

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:12.329 
the implant so you can see that the

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:14.569 
the implant so you can see that the
implant<00:03:12.630> if<00:03:12.900> it<00:03:13.049> rotates<00:03:13.470> a<00:03:13.650> little<00:03:13.920> bit<00:03:14.069> can

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:14.579 
implant if it rotates a little bit can

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:16.849 
implant if it rotates a little bit can
distort<00:03:15.000> the<00:03:15.930> appearance<00:03:16.230> of<00:03:16.290> the<00:03:16.380> breast<00:03:16.620> and

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:16.859 
distort the appearance of the breast and

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:20.089 
distort the appearance of the breast and
this<00:03:17.280> is<00:03:17.430> fortunately<00:03:18.000> very<00:03:18.120> rare<00:03:18.859> but<00:03:19.859> it<00:03:20.069> can

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:20.099 
this is fortunately very rare but it can

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:20.690 
this is fortunately very rare but it can
happen

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
happen

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.220 
happen
so<00:03:21.180> again<00:03:21.660> just<00:03:22.290> to<00:03:22.380> summarize<00:03:22.530> both<00:03:23.340> implants
