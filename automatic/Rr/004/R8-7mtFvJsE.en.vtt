00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:47.180 
tape around the top and it just kind of

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.690 
tape around the top and it just kind of
pulls<00:00:47.420> it<00:00:47.600> together<00:00:47.750> to<00:00:48.200> make<00:00:48.350> a<00:00:48.379> point<00:00:48.739> and

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:49.700 
pulls it together to make a point and

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.850 
pulls it together to make a point and
this<00:00:49.850> is<00:00:49.910> going<00:00:50.210> to<00:00:50.270> be<00:00:50.480> the<00:00:50.660> top<00:00:50.930> of<00:00:50.960> our<00:00:51.320> tree

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:51.860 
this is going to be the top of our tree

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.250 
this is going to be the top of our tree
it's<00:00:52.789> actually<00:00:53.270> the<00:00:53.450> bottom<00:00:53.840> of<00:00:53.989> the<00:00:54.110> tomato

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
it's actually the bottom of the tomato

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.410 
it's actually the bottom of the tomato
planter<00:00:55.010> but<00:00:55.280> it's<00:00:55.460> going<00:00:55.579> to<00:00:55.640> be<00:00:55.760> the<00:00:55.910> top<00:00:56.149> of

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
planter but it's going to be the top of

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.619 
planter but it's going to be the top of
our<00:00:56.629> tree<00:00:56.930> so<00:00:57.910> just<00:00:58.910> wrap<00:00:59.120> some<00:00:59.360> duct<00:00:59.539> tape

00:00:59.619 --> 00:00:59.629 
our tree so just wrap some duct tape

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:02.650 
our tree so just wrap some duct tape
around<00:01:00.050> it<00:01:00.260> to<00:01:00.980> make<00:01:01.010> sure<00:01:01.280> it<00:01:01.460> holds<00:01:01.699> well<00:01:02.149> and

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:02.660 
around it to make sure it holds well and

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:12.340 
around it to make sure it holds well and
that<00:01:02.840> it<00:01:02.930> won't<00:01:03.140> come<00:01:04.009> undone

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.020 

and<00:01:13.350> I<00:01:13.440> guess<00:01:13.650> I<00:01:13.770> should<00:01:13.980> be<00:01:14.160> using<00:01:14.340> green<00:01:14.640> duct

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
and I guess I should be using green duct

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.540 
and I guess I should be using green duct
tape<00:01:15.270> but<00:01:15.720> I<00:01:16.170> really<00:01:16.860> like<00:01:17.040> this<00:01:17.280> pretty

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:17.550 
tape but I really like this pretty

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:24.350 
tape but I really like this pretty
silver<00:01:18.090> duct<00:01:18.270> tape<00:01:22.880> so<00:01:23.880> next<00:01:24.180> you're<00:01:24.300> gonna

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
silver duct tape so next you're gonna

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.690 
silver duct tape so next you're gonna
take<00:01:24.690> your<00:01:24.870> light<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:25.800> you're<00:01:26.310> going<00:01:26.640> to

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
take your light and you're going to

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.300 
take your light and you're going to
figure<00:01:26.970> out<00:01:27.060> which<00:01:27.240> end<00:01:27.540> you<00:01:28.020> need<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.260> use<00:01:28.560> so

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
figure out which end you need to use so

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.480 
figure out which end you need to use so
if<00:01:30.120> you<00:01:30.330> are<00:01:30.720> using<00:01:31.080> an<00:01:31.500> extension<00:01:31.890> cord<00:01:32.340> that

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
if you are using an extension cord that

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.190 
if you are using an extension cord that
you<00:01:32.760> need<00:01:32.940> to<00:01:33.000> figure<00:01:33.150> out<00:01:33.330> which<00:01:33.570> end<00:01:33.750> you

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
you need to figure out which end you

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.570 
you need to figure out which end you
need<00:01:34.560> to<00:01:34.680> plug<00:01:34.890> into<00:01:35.100> your<00:01:35.280> extension<00:01:35.730> cord<00:01:35.940> so

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:37.580 
need to plug into your extension cord so

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.820 
need to plug into your extension cord so
my<00:01:38.580> extension<00:01:39.090> cord<00:01:39.420> has<00:01:39.780> a<00:01:39.810> plug<00:01:40.260> at<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.560> end

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:40.830 
my extension cord has a plug at the end

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.770 
my extension cord has a plug at the end
of<00:01:41.010> it<00:01:41.130> so<00:01:41.340> I'll<00:01:41.580> be<00:01:41.730> using<00:01:41.940> the<00:01:42.600> whole<00:01:43.350> end<00:01:44.780> so

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
of it so I'll be using the whole end so

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.570 
of it so I'll be using the whole end so
you<00:01:45.840> take<00:01:46.200> your<00:01:46.229> lights<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:46.860> you<00:01:47.370> just

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:47.580 
you take your lights and you just

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:53.240 
you take your lights and you just
stretch<00:01:48.000> them<00:01:48.300> up<00:01:49.140> and<00:01:49.590> over<00:01:50.250> and<00:01:51.090> then<00:01:52.250> bring

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
stretch them up and over and then bring

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.770 
stretch them up and over and then bring
them<00:01:53.340> all<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.550> way<00:01:53.640> down<00:01:53.790> to<00:01:53.910> the<00:01:54.030> bottom<00:01:54.180> wrap

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
them all the way down to the bottom wrap

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.200 
them all the way down to the bottom wrap
them<00:01:55.050> around<00:01:55.350> and<00:01:55.710> then<00:01:55.950> come<00:01:55.979> back<00:01:56.310> up<00:01:56.760> and

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
them around and then come back up and

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.140 
them around and then come back up and
over<00:01:57.660> it's<00:01:58.440> a<00:01:58.590> pretty<00:01:58.860> simple<00:01:59.160> process<00:01:59.610> it

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:00.150 
over it's a pretty simple process it

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.340 
over it's a pretty simple process it
just<00:02:00.180> goes<00:02:00.600> up<00:02:00.810> and<00:02:01.229> down<00:02:01.380> up<00:02:01.979> and<00:02:02.400> down<00:02:02.490> and

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
just goes up and down up and down and

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.170 
just goes up and down up and down and
once<00:02:04.350> you<00:02:04.470> run<00:02:04.740> out<00:02:04.920> of<00:02:04.950> your<00:02:05.550> first<00:02:05.880> set<00:02:06.150> of

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
once you run out of your first set of

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.690 
once you run out of your first set of
light<00:02:06.570> you're<00:02:07.290> going<00:02:07.350> to<00:02:07.710> plug<00:02:08.010> in<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.399> next

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
light you're going to plug in the next

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:14.480 
light you're going to plug in the next
set<00:02:08.820> of<00:02:08.850> lights<00:02:09.179> and<00:02:09.479> do<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:09.929> same<00:02:10.140> thing<00:02:13.490> some

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
set of lights and do the same thing some

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.060 
set of lights and do the same thing some
people<00:02:14.520> think<00:02:15.450> it's<00:02:15.660> better<00:02:15.930> to<00:02:16.260> go<00:02:16.410> round<00:02:16.800> and

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
people think it's better to go round and

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.000 
people think it's better to go round and
around<00:02:17.190> and<00:02:17.580> around<00:02:17.910> the<00:02:18.390> tomato<00:02:18.570> planner<00:02:19.170> but

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
around and around the tomato planner but

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.820 
around and around the tomato planner but
I<00:02:20.070> feel<00:02:20.520> like<00:02:20.850> this<00:02:21.270> way<00:02:21.570> it<00:02:21.930> looks<00:02:22.260> a<00:02:22.470> lot

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
I feel like this way it looks a lot
