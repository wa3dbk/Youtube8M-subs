00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:18.739 
resume so we are we have a little bit of

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:20.740 
resume so we are we have a little bit of
a<00:02:18.830> chip<00:02:19.069> on<00:02:19.310> our<00:02:19.400> shoulder<00:02:19.670> and<00:02:20.269> we're<00:02:20.569> ready

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:44.090 
at and then and then layering in you

at and then and then layering in you
know<00:05:44.210> things<00:05:44.360> that<00:05:44.480> you<00:05:44.630> could<00:05:44.780> work<00:05:44.930> at<00:05:45.170> so

know things that you could work at so

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:47.350 
know things that you could work at so

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:47.360 
she should never forget about what makes

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.260 
she should never forget about what makes
her<00:05:47.510> different<00:05:47.540> and<00:05:48.080> special<00:05:48.200> and<00:05:49.150> you<00:05:50.150> know

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:50.270 
her different and special and you know

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:55.840 
her different and special and you know
especially<00:05:51.400> at<00:05:52.400> UNC<00:05:53.330> and<00:05:53.690> and<00:05:54.050> all<00:05:54.410> over<00:05:54.850> the

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:55.850 
especially at UNC and and all over the

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:57.280 
especially at UNC and and all over the
nation<00:05:56.030> I<00:05:56.330> think<00:05:56.360> that<00:05:56.660> it's<00:05:56.810> just<00:05:56.990> about

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:57.290 
nation I think that it's just about

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:59.530 
nation I think that it's just about
getting<00:05:57.650> into<00:05:58.640> the<00:05:58.760> groove<00:05:58.940> early<00:05:59.150> as<00:05:59.510> a

00:05:59.530 --> 00:05:59.540 
getting into the groove early as a

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:02.470 
getting into the groove early as a
freshman<00:06:00.110> and<00:06:00.320> you<00:06:01.280> know<00:06:01.610> college<00:06:01.970> life<00:06:02.270> is<00:06:02.300> a

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:02.480 
freshman and you know college life is a

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.180 
freshman and you know college life is a
lot<00:06:02.660> different<00:06:02.810> than<00:06:03.140> and<00:06:03.560> then<00:06:03.740> high<00:06:03.920> school

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:04.190 
lot different than and then high school

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:07.030 
lot different than and then high school
as<00:06:04.310> we<00:06:04.460> know<00:06:04.610> so<00:06:05.110> you<00:06:06.110> know<00:06:06.140> just<00:06:06.440> going<00:06:06.620> into

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:07.040 
as we know so you know just going into

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:09.640 
as we know so you know just going into
preseason<00:06:07.640> fit<00:06:08.120> I<00:06:08.360> think<00:06:08.630> that<00:06:08.780> it's<00:06:09.080> very

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:09.650 
preseason fit I think that it's very

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:11.230 
preseason fit I think that it's very
important<00:06:10.130> because<00:06:10.160> that<00:06:10.490> just<00:06:10.520> sort<00:06:11.150> of

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:11.240 
important because that just sort of

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.690 
important because that just sort of
starts<00:06:11.630> off<00:06:11.750> your<00:06:11.960> entire<00:06:12.200> career<00:06:12.500> on<00:06:12.920> a<00:06:13.010> high

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:13.700 
starts off your entire career on a high

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:15.460 
starts off your entire career on a high
note<00:06:13.730> and<00:06:14.000> and<00:06:14.510> you<00:06:14.690> don't<00:06:14.870> want<00:06:14.990> fitness<00:06:15.350> to

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:15.470 
note and and you don't want fitness to

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:16.780 
note and and you don't want fitness to
be<00:06:15.590> something<00:06:15.800> that<00:06:16.100> lets<00:06:16.310> you<00:06:16.400> down<00:06:16.580> because

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:16.790 
be something that lets you down because

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:18.340 
be something that lets you down because
in<00:06:17.060> my<00:06:17.180> opinion<00:06:17.330> that's<00:06:17.690> something<00:06:18.080> that<00:06:18.110> you

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:18.350 
in my opinion that's something that you

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:22.150 
in my opinion that's something that you
can<00:06:18.530> control<00:06:18.920> and<00:06:19.250> is<00:06:20.060> a<00:06:20.090> decision<00:06:20.830> so<00:06:21.830> I<00:06:21.860> would

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:22.160 
can control and is a decision so I would

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.600 
can control and is a decision so I would
tell<00:06:22.340> her<00:06:22.460> to<00:06:22.610> go<00:06:23.390> and<00:06:23.510> fit<00:06:23.780> and<00:06:24.460> respect<00:06:25.460> your

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:25.610 
tell her to go and fit and respect your

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:28.360 
tell her to go and fit and respect your
elders<00:06:26.030> I<00:06:26.360> guess<00:06:26.720> even<00:06:26.960> though<00:06:27.380> UNC<00:06:27.890> is<00:06:28.070> a<00:06:28.100> very

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:28.370 
elders I guess even though UNC is a very

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:31.240 
elders I guess even though UNC is a very
welcoming<00:06:29.300> place<00:06:29.570> it's<00:06:30.530> always<00:06:30.830> helpful<00:06:30.950> to

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:31.250 
welcoming place it's always helpful to

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:34.120 
welcoming place it's always helpful to
respect<00:06:32.180> your<00:06:32.300> elders<00:06:32.360> a<00:06:32.690> little<00:06:33.020> bit<00:06:33.200> and<00:06:33.530> and

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:34.130 
respect your elders a little bit and and

played a full strength US Men's National
Team<00:06:49.580> it<00:06:50.389> would<00:06:50.540> win<00:06:50.750> and<00:06:50.990> what<00:06:51.260> would<00:06:51.380> be<00:06:51.410> the

Team it would win and what would be the
score<00:06:51.860> I<00:06:54.280> mean<00:06:55.360> we<00:06:56.360> can<00:06:56.600> dream<00:06:57.110> that<00:06:57.530> we<00:06:57.680> can

00:06:57.850 --> 00:06:57.860 
score I mean we can dream that we can

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:00.879 
score I mean we can dream that we can
hang<00:06:58.040> with<00:06:58.070> the<00:06:58.280> guys<00:06:58.520> I<00:06:59.650> think<00:07:00.650> that<00:07:00.680> we<00:07:00.830> would

00:07:00.879 --> 00:07:00.889 
hang with the guys I think that we would

00:07:00.889 --> 00:07:02.170 
hang with the guys I think that we would
have<00:07:00.950> a<00:07:01.070> lot<00:07:01.190> of<00:07:01.250> fun<00:07:01.460> out<00:07:01.639> there<00:07:01.669> playing

have a lot of fun out there playing

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:05.800 
have a lot of fun out there playing
against<00:07:02.540> each<00:07:02.600> other<00:07:02.840> but<00:07:03.710> I<00:07:04.030> think<00:07:05.030> that<00:07:05.090> you

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:05.810 
against each other but I think that you

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:08.290 
against each other but I think that you
know<00:07:05.930> the<00:07:06.290> men's<00:07:06.530> team<00:07:06.830> is<00:07:07.100> is<00:07:07.400> quite<00:07:07.970> a<00:07:08.000> bit

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:08.300 
know the men's team is is quite a bit

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:11.800 
know the men's team is is quite a bit
faster<00:07:08.810> and<00:07:09.020> stronger<00:07:09.320> than<00:07:09.620> us<00:07:09.800> um<00:07:10.360> so<00:07:11.360> in<00:07:11.750> a

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:11.810 
faster and stronger than us um so in a

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:13.360 
faster and stronger than us um so in a
full<00:07:12.050> field<00:07:12.260> match<00:07:12.560> I<00:07:12.830> would<00:07:12.860> probably<00:07:13.100> have

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:13.370 
full field match I would probably have

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:15.909 
full field match I would probably have
to<00:07:13.490> give<00:07:13.639> them<00:07:13.790> the<00:07:13.910> upper<00:07:14.030> hand<00:07:14.260> but<00:07:15.260> uh<00:07:15.320> I

00:07:15.909 --> 00:07:15.919 
to give them the upper hand but uh I

00:07:15.919 --> 00:07:17.469 
to give them the upper hand but uh I
think<00:07:16.130> that<00:07:16.400> if<00:07:16.460> we<00:07:16.520> did<00:07:16.760> some<00:07:16.970> kind<00:07:17.180> of<00:07:17.270> like

00:07:17.469 --> 00:07:17.479 
think that if we did some kind of like

00:07:17.479 --> 00:07:20.920 
think that if we did some kind of like
fun<00:07:17.810> like<00:07:18.110> soccer<00:07:18.979> tennis<00:07:19.310> or<00:07:19.880> some<00:07:20.419> technical

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:20.930 
fun like soccer tennis or some technical

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:22.510 
fun like soccer tennis or some technical
games<00:07:21.320> or<00:07:21.620> something<00:07:21.710> like<00:07:21.919> that<00:07:22.010> that<00:07:22.130> we<00:07:22.340> can

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:22.520 
games or something like that that we can

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:24.580 
games or something like that that we can
definitely<00:07:22.700> hold<00:07:23.030> around<00:07:23.240> but<00:07:23.690> i<00:07:23.930> think<00:07:24.470> the

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:24.590 
definitely hold around but i think the

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:27.370 
definitely hold around but i think the
speed<00:07:24.919> and<00:07:25.100> strength<00:07:25.340> is<00:07:26.180> tough<00:07:26.810> too<00:07:26.930> tough<00:07:27.229> to

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:27.380 
speed and strength is tough too tough to

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:30.250 
speed and strength is tough too tough to
compete<00:07:27.680> with<00:07:27.889> for<00:07:28.100> sure
