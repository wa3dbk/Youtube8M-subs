maybe they're a little bit too long like
width<00:00:52.410> wise<00:00:52.680> but<00:00:53.250> I<00:00:53.309> you<00:00:53.730> know<00:00:53.760> it's<00:00:53.940> hard<00:00:54.090> to

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
width wise but I you know it's hard to

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.819 
width wise but I you know it's hard to
telex<00:00:54.449> you<00:00:54.510> have<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:54.690> pick<00:00:54.899> out<00:00:55.289> of<00:00:55.620> all<00:00:55.710> these

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
telex you have to pick out of all these

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.920 
telex you have to pick out of all these
different<00:00:56.010> shapes<00:00:56.730> online<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:57.750> they<00:00:57.809> have

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
different shapes online and they have

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.209 
different shapes online and they have
like<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.260> measurements<00:00:58.770> it's<00:00:58.890> really<00:00:59.070> hard

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
like the measurements it's really hard

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.279 
like the measurements it's really hard
to<00:00:59.309> tell<00:00:59.660> which<00:01:00.660> one<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:00.930> get

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
to tell which one to get

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.139 
to tell which one to get

glasses<00:01:32.820> just<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.509> clearer<00:01:33.840> you<00:01:34.740> can<00:01:34.860> see

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040

these were just the middle index lenses
which<00:01:37.860> I<00:01:38.159> actually<00:01:38.490> could<00:01:39.030> use<00:01:39.180> high<00:01:39.360> index

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
which I actually could use high index

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.179 
which I actually could use high index
because<00:01:40.020> my<00:01:40.170> prescription<00:01:40.740> is<00:01:40.860> high<00:01:40.979> it's

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
because my prescription is high it's

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.760 
because my prescription is high it's
like<00:01:41.310> negative<00:01:41.640> 4.25<00:01:42.479> with<00:01:43.140> a<00:01:43.170> slight

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
like negative 4.25 with a slight

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.740 
like negative 4.25 with a slight
astigmatism<00:01:44.240> but<00:01:45.240> I<00:01:45.270> mean<00:01:45.450> they're<00:01:45.540> still

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
astigmatism but I mean they're still

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.889 
astigmatism but I mean they're still
pretty<00:01:46.049> thin<00:01:46.380> and<00:01:47.450> this<00:01:48.450> has<00:01:48.689> the

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
pretty thin and this has the

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.660 
pretty thin and this has the
anti-reflective<00:01:49.530> coating<00:01:50.189> which<00:01:50.310> actually

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
anti-reflective coating which actually

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.359 
anti-reflective coating which actually
makes<00:01:50.850> a<00:01:50.939> huge<00:01:51.119> difference<00:01:51.149> now<00:01:52.110> I<00:01:52.649> went<00:01:53.280> on

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
makes a huge difference now I went on

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:54.889 
makes a huge difference now I went on
there<00:01:53.579> to<00:01:53.880> look<00:01:54.000> at<00:01:54.149> glasses<00:01:54.540> and<00:01:54.659> they<00:01:54.720> have

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
there to look at glasses and they have

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.609 
there to look at glasses and they have
new<00:01:55.280> anti<00:01:56.280> coatings<00:01:57.119> I<00:01:57.270> have<00:01:57.420> they<00:01:58.170> have<00:01:58.320> three

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
new anti coatings I have they have three

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.230 
new anti coatings I have they have three
different<00:01:58.770> types<00:01:59.159> you<00:01:59.280> can<00:01:59.430> get<00:01:59.640> the<00:02:00.060> regular

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
different types you can get the regular

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.959 
different types you can get the regular
with<00:02:00.659> no<00:02:00.899> coating<00:02:01.560> on<00:02:01.680> it<00:02:01.710> which<00:02:02.399> is<00:02:02.430> just<00:02:02.790> the

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
with no coating on it which is just the

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.090 
with no coating on it which is just the
fingerprint<00:02:03.810> or<00:02:03.990> I'm<00:02:04.110> sorry<00:02:04.350> scratch

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.679 
fingerprint or I'm sorry scratch
resistant<00:02:05.700> but<00:02:05.850> then<00:02:05.939> they<00:02:06.030> also<00:02:06.210> have<00:02:06.509> the

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
resistant but then they also have the

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.119 
resistant but then they also have the
regular<00:02:07.049> anti<00:02:07.350> reflective<00:02:07.649> but<00:02:07.890> then<00:02:07.979> there's

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
regular anti reflective but then there's

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.650 
regular anti reflective but then there's
an<00:02:08.220> extra<00:02:08.340> one<00:02:08.759> I<00:02:08.789> think<00:02:09.000> there<00:02:09.149> must<00:02:09.330> be<00:02:09.509> two

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
an extra one I think there must be two

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.559 
an extra one I think there must be two
extra<00:02:09.989> ones<00:02:10.080> there's<00:02:10.649> a<00:02:11.330> water-resistant<00:02:12.330> and

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
extra ones there's a water-resistant and

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.730 
extra ones there's a water-resistant and
then<00:02:13.050> there's<00:02:13.230> a

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
then there's a

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.850 
then there's a
water-resistant<00:02:13.980> plus<00:02:14.790> oil<00:02:15.360> and

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
water-resistant plus oil and

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.990 
water-resistant plus oil and
fingerprint-resistant<00:02:16.860> one<00:02:17.010> and<00:02:17.280> that's<00:02:17.850> an

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
fingerprint-resistant one and that's an

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.510 
fingerprint-resistant one and that's an
only<00:02:18.150> extra<00:02:18.810> $14<00:02:19.800> if<00:02:19.950> you<00:02:20.010> get<00:02:20.160> the<00:02:20.280> full

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
only extra $14 if you get the full

only extra $14 if you get the full

coating<00:02:23.010> oil<00:02:23.750> fingerprint<00:02:24.750> I<00:02:24.810> guess<00:02:24.990> when<00:02:25.170> you

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
coating oil fingerprint I guess when you

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.050 
coating oil fingerprint I guess when you
wash<00:02:25.440> your<00:02:25.680> glasses<00:02:25.920> it<00:02:26.220> is<00:02:26.370> so<00:02:26.670> easy<00:02:26.910> that

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
wash your glasses it is so easy that

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.540 
wash your glasses it is so easy that
they<00:02:27.390> don't<00:02:27.570> get<00:02:27.690> dirty<00:02:27.990> I<00:02:28.290> mean<00:02:28.620> I<00:02:28.890> can't<00:02:29.400> wait

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
they don't get dirty I mean I can't wait

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.430 
they don't get dirty I mean I can't wait
to<00:02:29.670> try<00:02:29.790> it<00:02:29.910> I'll<00:02:30.210> do<00:02:30.510> a<00:02:30.540> review<00:02:30.720> immediately

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
to try it I'll do a review immediately

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.340 
to try it I'll do a review immediately
when<00:02:31.710> I<00:02:31.800> try<00:02:32.100> the<00:02:32.160> new<00:02:32.370> coating<00:02:33.030> ok<00:02:33.570> so<00:02:33.630> back<00:02:34.170> to

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
when I try the new coating ok so back to

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:35.060 
when I try the new coating ok so back to
what<00:02:34.440> I<00:02:34.500> was<00:02:34.530> doing

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
what I was doing

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.160 
what I was doing
remember<00:02:35.850> the<00:02:36.060> these<00:02:36.510> ones<00:02:36.750> that<00:02:36.870> I<00:02:36.990> had

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
remember the these ones that I had

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.950 
remember the these ones that I had
another<00:02:37.470> review<00:02:37.800> that<00:02:37.980> I<00:02:38.010> did<00:02:38.220> I<00:02:38.840> still<00:02:39.840> have

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
another review that I did I still have

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.620 
another review that I did I still have
these<00:02:40.340> two<00:02:41.340> really<00:02:41.490> these<00:02:41.910> ones<00:02:42.180> I<00:02:42.300> have<00:02:42.420> no

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
these two really these ones I have no

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:43.970 
these two really these ones I have no
anti-reflective<00:02:43.170> coating<00:02:43.530> and<00:02:43.590> you<00:02:43.680> can<00:02:43.800> kind

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
anti-reflective coating and you can kind

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.880 
anti-reflective coating and you can kind
of<00:02:44.040> tell<00:02:44.220> and<00:02:45.290> these<00:02:46.290> were<00:02:46.410> like<00:02:46.470> the<00:02:46.680> six

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
of tell and these were like the six

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:54.320 
of tell and these were like the six
dollar<00:02:47.100> ones<00:02:51.290> and<00:02:52.430> you<00:02:53.430> know<00:02:53.550> as<00:02:53.760> you<00:02:53.970> can<00:02:54.000> see

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
dollar ones and you know as you can see

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.520 
dollar ones and you know as you can see
looks<00:02:55.230> like<00:02:55.290> my<00:02:55.470> dog<00:02:55.680> got<00:02:56.490> ahold<00:02:56.700> of<00:02:56.820> them

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
looks like my dog got ahold of them

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.300 
looks like my dog got ahold of them
yeah<00:02:58.530> right<00:02:58.740> there<00:02:59.960> and<00:03:00.960> she<00:03:01.890> kind<00:03:02.070> of<00:03:02.130> chewed

on<00:03:02.430> him<00:03:02.610> a<00:03:02.670> little<00:03:02.880> bit<00:03:03.000> and<00:03:03.060> they<00:03:03.300> she<00:03:03.720> bid<00:03:04.050> on

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
on him a little bit and they she bid on

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.540 
on him a little bit and they she bid on
them<00:03:04.410> there's<00:03:04.590> like<00:03:04.680> little<00:03:04.860> bite<00:03:05.070> marks<00:03:05.400> all

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
them there's like little bite marks all

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.250 
them there's like little bite marks all
over<00:03:05.580> the<00:03:05.850> place<00:03:06.060> but<00:03:06.390> I<00:03:06.570> don't<00:03:06.720> even<00:03:06.810> care<00:03:07.080> I

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
over the place but I don't even care I

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.050 
over the place but I don't even care I
got<00:03:07.590> these<00:03:07.800> only<00:03:08.160> because<00:03:08.490> I<00:03:08.550> wanted<00:03:08.760> to<00:03:08.850> see

Blake<00:03:16.110> black<00:03:16.580> so<00:03:17.580> yeah<00:03:17.730> these<00:03:17.880> are<00:03:18.030> still<00:03:18.330> in

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
Blake black so yeah these are still in

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.930 
Blake black so yeah these are still in
good<00:03:18.570> condition<00:03:19.130> for<00:03:20.130> being<00:03:20.280> a<00:03:20.310> year<00:03:20.490> old<00:03:20.700> or

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
good condition for being a year old or

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
over a year old and then my other ones

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:25.070 
over a year old and then my other ones
which<00:03:23.820> I<00:03:23.940> head<00:03:24.180> on<00:03:24.210> in<00:03:24.510> the<00:03:24.600> beginning<00:03:24.930> of<00:03:24.990> the

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
which I head on in the beginning of the

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.710

one thing about these is I don't like so

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:22.130 
one thing about these is I don't like so
that's<00:04:20.880> why<00:04:21.030> I<00:04:21.060> kind<00:04:21.270> of<00:04:21.390> stick<00:04:21.600> to<00:04:21.720> these<00:04:21.870> ones

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.590 
I've ended up that's all I have now the
other<00:04:35.140> pair<00:04:35.410> I<00:04:35.440> think<00:04:35.740> I<00:04:35.830> ended<00:04:36.070> up<00:04:36.160> losing<00:04:37.030> the

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:37.600 
other pair I think I ended up losing the

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.500 
other pair I think I ended up losing the
ones<00:04:38.290> with<00:04:38.470> the<00:04:38.560> little<00:04:38.650> gem<00:04:38.920> on<00:04:39.040> the<00:04:39.130> side<00:04:39.510> the

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:40.510 
ones with the little gem on the side the

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:42.600 
ones with the little gem on the side the
one<00:04:40.660> with<00:04:40.840> the<00:04:41.140> weird<00:04:41.320> other<00:04:41.890> ones<00:04:42.160> like<00:04:42.340> these

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
one with the weird other ones like these

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:45.510 
one with the weird other ones like these
they<00:04:42.970> had<00:04:43.120> like<00:04:43.300> that<00:04:43.510> metal<00:04:44.260> thing<00:04:45.250> there<00:04:45.490> I

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 
they had like that metal thing there I

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.430 
they had like that metal thing there I
got<00:04:46.060> rid<00:04:46.210> of<00:04:46.270> those<00:04:46.420> because<00:04:46.810> like<00:04:47.020> they<00:04:47.410> I

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
got rid of those because like they I

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:48.780 
got rid of those because like they I
couldn't<00:04:47.800> really<00:04:47.890> use<00:04:48.250> on<00:04:48.400> they<00:04:48.490> were<00:04:48.610> just

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:48.790 
couldn't really use on they were just

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:52.740 
couldn't really use on they were just
pointless<00:04:49.570> and<00:04:51.120> another<00:04:52.120> pair<00:04:52.360> that<00:04:52.390> just

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:52.750 
pointless and another pair that just

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:54.180 
pointless and another pair that just
weren't<00:04:52.900> the<00:04:53.140> first<00:04:53.350> pair<00:04:53.560> I<00:04:53.590> ever<00:04:53.830> ordered

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.190 
weren't the first pair I ever ordered

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:55.530 
weren't the first pair I ever ordered
they<00:04:54.460> weren't<00:04:54.670> the<00:04:54.760> correct<00:04:54.970> prescription

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:55.540 
they weren't the correct prescription

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:56.400 
they weren't the correct prescription
just<00:04:55.570> because<00:04:55.930> I<00:04:55.990> didn't<00:04:56.140> know<00:04:56.200> what<00:04:56.260> I<00:04:56.320> was

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:56.410 
just because I didn't know what I was

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:58.200 
just because I didn't know what I was
doing<00:04:56.740> so<00:04:57.310> I<00:04:57.370> ended<00:04:57.520> up<00:04:57.610> getting<00:04:57.790> rid<00:04:58.000> of<00:04:58.060> those

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.210 
doing so I ended up getting rid of those
