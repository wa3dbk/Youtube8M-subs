here is the inside of the box quite a
quite<00:00:47.489> a<00:00:47.520> decent<00:00:47.879> amount<00:00:47.940> of<00:00:48.210> styrofoam<00:00:48.750> in

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
quite a decent amount of styrofoam in

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.619 
quite a decent amount of styrofoam in
there<00:00:49.410> I<00:00:50.070> know<00:00:50.550> a<00:00:50.940> lot<00:00:51.149> of<00:00:51.180> these<00:00:51.360> companies

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
there I know a lot of these companies

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.229 
there I know a lot of these companies
need<00:00:51.989> to<00:00:52.230> ship<00:00:52.469> with<00:00:52.620> styrofoam<00:00:52.890> but<00:00:53.460> these

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
need to ship with styrofoam but these

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.760 
need to ship with styrofoam but these
days<00:00:54.480> I<00:00:54.690> got<00:00:54.840> to<00:00:54.960> think<00:00:55.140> there's<00:00:55.289> a<00:00:55.379> better<00:00:55.559> way

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
days I got to think there's a better way

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.709 
days I got to think there's a better way
to<00:00:55.829> ship<00:00:56.190> there's<00:00:56.850> got<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.300> be<00:00:57.329> some<00:00:57.539> other

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
to ship there's got to be some other

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.360 
to ship there's got to be some other
material<00:00:58.170> these<00:00:58.230> companies<00:00:58.590> can<00:00:58.829> use<00:00:59.070> it's<00:00:59.280> a

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
material these companies can use it's a

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.380 
material these companies can use it's a
little<00:00:59.579> greener<00:01:01.940> so<00:01:02.940> here<00:01:03.120> we're<00:01:03.239> going<00:01:03.270> to

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
little greener so here we're going to

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.130 
little greener so here we're going to
start<00:01:03.510> pulling<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.619> tape<00:01:04.830> off<00:01:05.420> there's<00:01:06.420> a<00:01:06.600> ton

start pulling the tape off there's a ton
of<00:01:07.170> tape<00:01:07.439> on<00:01:07.590> this<00:01:07.770> machine<00:01:08.270> helps<00:01:09.270> keep<00:01:09.450> it

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
of tape on this machine helps keep it

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.500 
of tape on this machine helps keep it
still<00:01:10.020> and<00:01:10.290> from<00:01:10.890> getting<00:01:11.850> jostled<00:01:12.180> around

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
still and from getting jostled around

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.160 
still and from getting jostled around
during<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.049> shipping<00:01:14.540> make<00:01:15.540> sure<00:01:15.750> you<00:01:15.900> get<00:01:16.020> it

machine so the cost per page on this

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.179 
machine so the cost per page on this
device<00:01:36.659> for<00:01:36.930> black<00:01:37.200> is<00:01:37.409> a<00:01:37.439> bit<00:01:37.650> high<00:01:37.829> at<00:01:38.040> two

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
device for black is a bit high at two

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.340 
device for black is a bit high at two
and<00:01:38.340> a<00:01:38.369> half<00:01:38.460> cents<00:01:38.759> a<00:01:38.880> page<00:01:39.090> it's<00:01:39.780> a<00:01:39.930> good<00:01:40.110> cost

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
and a half cents a page it's a good cost

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.569 
and a half cents a page it's a good cost
per<00:01:40.560> page<00:01:40.770> though<00:01:40.979> if<00:01:41.100> you're<00:01:41.250> printing<00:01:41.430> a<00:01:41.549> lot

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
per page though if you're printing a lot

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
inexpensive color printer like this you

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.069 
inexpensive color printer like this you
wind<00:01:47.369> up<00:01:47.520> paying<00:01:47.700> quite<00:01:48.030> a<00:01:48.060> bit<00:01:48.270> more<00:01:48.509> for

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
wind up paying quite a bit more for

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.580 
wind up paying quite a bit more for
those<00:01:49.259> color<00:01:49.590> prints<00:01:50.659> but<00:01:51.659> with<00:01:52.049> this<00:01:52.229> oki

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
those color prints but with this oki

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.530 
those color prints but with this oki
product<00:01:53.399> that's<00:01:53.640> not<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:54.000> case<00:01:54.180> color

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
product that's not the case color

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.500 
product that's not the case color
printing<00:01:54.869> is<00:01:55.020> actually<00:01:55.200> very<00:01:55.740> inexpensive

00:01:59.500 --> 00:01:59.510 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:03.080 

so<00:02:00.510> we're<00:02:00.720> just<00:02:00.750> about<00:02:00.990> done<00:02:01.700> go<00:02:02.700> a<00:02:02.730> little<00:02:02.910> bit

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
so we're just about done go a little bit

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.510 
so we're just about done go a little bit
more<00:02:03.120> tape<00:02:03.510> off<00:02:03.750> and<00:02:03.780> you're<00:02:04.110> gonna<00:02:04.260> make<00:02:05.250> sure

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
more tape off and you're gonna make sure

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.560 
more tape off and you're gonna make sure
that<00:02:05.550> you<00:02:06.440> shift<00:02:07.440> those<00:02:07.710> blue<00:02:08.070> pieces<00:02:08.790> to<00:02:09.420> the

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:09.570 
that you shift those blue pieces to the

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:12.830 
that you shift those blue pieces to the
side<00:02:09.780> to<00:02:10.080> lock<00:02:10.260> those<00:02:11.120> print<00:02:12.120> cartridges<00:02:12.570> in

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
side to lock those print cartridges in

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.340 
side to lock those print cartridges in
those<00:02:13.200> are<00:02:13.380> the<00:02:13.470> toner<00:02:13.710> cartridges<00:02:14.220> a<00:02:15.350> little

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
those are the toner cartridges a little

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:21.920 
those are the toner cartridges a little
bit<00:02:16.440> more<00:02:16.590> tape<00:02:16.830> inside<00:02:17.190> here<00:02:20.630> so<00:02:21.630> now<00:02:21.780> it's

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
bit more tape inside here so now it's

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:28.010 
bit more tape inside here so now it's
all<00:02:22.050> set<00:02:22.380> I'm<00:02:22.710> going<00:02:22.860> to<00:02:22.920> shut<00:02:23.130> this<00:02:25.250> and<00:02:27.020> all

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
all set I'm going to shut this and all

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.420 
all set I'm going to shut this and all
that's<00:02:28.290> left<00:02:28.530> is<00:02:28.680> to<00:02:28.740> load<00:02:28.980> it<00:02:29.130> with<00:02:29.250> some

that's left is to load it with some
paper<00:02:30.800> turn<00:02:31.800> it<00:02:31.890> on<00:02:32.750> you<00:02:33.750> can<00:02:33.900> see<00:02:34.080> right<00:02:34.260> there

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
paper turn it on you can see right there

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.450 
paper turn it on you can see right there
there's<00:02:35.700> a<00:02:35.850> USB<00:02:36.780> port<00:02:37.530> where<00:02:37.740> you<00:02:37.800> can<00:02:37.920> plug<00:02:38.070> in
