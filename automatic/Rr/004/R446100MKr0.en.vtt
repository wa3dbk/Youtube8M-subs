 channel and I'm very happy that the audience 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.460
 Our channel is constantly growing as 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.719

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.530
 I would like to say thank you to everyone 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.269

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.369
 the administrator of the VKontakte group on the game 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.289
 injustice and of course to people who have 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.910
 directly channel relationship but what 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.400
 friends now let's get down to the game 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.350
 who gathered us all here 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.150
 as the name implies 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.160
 today's issue will be dedicated to bad 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.750
 girl Cassandra Cain it can be 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.610
 get after going through the network 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.320
 trials and most likely through one or 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.840
 two network tests will reappear 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.850
 Such a possibility but in a bad girl it looks like 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.559
 much cooler than the old outside 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.899
 her changes are completely different 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.920
 animation she looks cooler she 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.309
 moves steeper 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.020
 she she generally just wow the developers 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.879
 awarded a new bad girl interesting 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.219
 passive when entering into battle Cassandra 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.230
 Kane blows 25 percent with one blow 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.809
 current health is exactly current 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.609
 health they are common if you use b2 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.930
 in the company of sar persons it will be possible 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.329
 quite often terrorize 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.080
 rivals like chip talk about 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.780
 special tricks 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.170
 1 special reception art has not changed 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.180
 cheating 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:13.409
 really worth noting that cassandra 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:15.530
 new betarangs 2 special reception draw 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.530
 land 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:26.510
 well, the third receiver is also particularly familiar 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.510
 in the balance 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.000
 to correctly use passive 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.010
 cassandra cay need to use it in 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.660
 combined with arnica but as well as she 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:45.370
 I am far from the seventh rank 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.080
 add miracle woman to team 600 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:48.810
 thanks to which women's damage 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.220
 characters increase by 30 percent 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.890
 according to the old format you can already 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.930
 finish the video but no talk about 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.190
 Outfitting for Cassandras use 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.870
 native gear increases 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.000
 maximum health helps to put 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:03.520
 critical damage on first special attack 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.510
 4 star lesser races al ghul enhances 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.160
 damage main attacks 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.110
 exhausts the opponent's strength at the end 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.009
 combinations and adds one strip 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.660
 started forces 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.489
 add to this pumped equipment 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:16.350
 which restores health and 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:16.350
 we get a super cool bad girl 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.920
