00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.150
 beautiful that you are seeing me today 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:09.269
 I am very happy with this 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.250
 video because I already decided girls and I decided 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.500
 that I'm going to make them more healthy videos 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.870
 at least a week at least some 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.010
 weeks and a week not but I have to 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.140
 do it because we have to 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.730
 commit and make changes for 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.890
 we and I know that you have given them to me 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.650
 asked so much so in this video 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.960
 let's talk about how to stay 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.910
 how motivated accept that we 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.189
 changing lifestyle and then 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.380
 You give us advice to keep us 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.940
 within a routine and how to create a 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.160
 new routine so if you want to learn 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.770
 a little more on the subject keep looking 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.870
 this video first of all girls what 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.239
 what is the word diet what is the 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.860
 sacrifice word all those things 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.160
 we have to erase them from our 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.140
 vocabulary and start accepting this 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.270
 as a lifestyle and not as something 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.850
 what we do only for a week or 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.980
 every time we go fat we do 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.899
 that is, we can not do this kind of 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.460
 things because honestly we're not going to 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.570
 doing well in our body is not going to 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.090
 accept will not accept it as 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.530
 nice as something good as something with 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.640
 that you feel good first thing 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.229
 we have to make girls is 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.000
 mentalizing that will be a 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:15.640
 change of which we are going to enter now to 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.140
 this routine to this new life to this 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.630
 new lifestyle that is life 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.310
 healthy that you're not just going to look good 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.140
 otherwise you'll feel good that that's the 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.610
 important part so that 's what 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.259
 first girls there has to be a change 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.000
 because if there is no change of something there is no 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:29.680
 result if we do exactly what 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.930
 same we will have exactly the 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.880
 same results so to be able to 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:36.070
 change to be able to see each other better and 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.560
 feel more energized we have to 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.780
 change certain things one thing with the 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.149
 that we all fight and there really is not 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:46.240
 one that is not saved or one that is not 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:48.340
 save is the motivation the motivation is 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.990
 often it loses sometimes we start 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:53.110
 do something with encouragement that we start to 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:55.660
 exercise and suddenly we do not know 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:58.690
 what happened but let's say everything and 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:00.250
 we went back to our routine as I 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.229
 I learned this girl if I say it with my 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.869
 own experience and I feel that my 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:06.550
 mind wants what you see so if you 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:08.590
 you're seeing good things that's what 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:09.970
 you will want if you are seeing bodies 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.020
 cute if you're watching people doing 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.240
 exercise 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.580
 it looks healthy that's what more or 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.190
 unless your mind is going to want to do the same 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:21.220
 if you see this great healthy recipes and 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:23.080
 things like that then your body and you are going to 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.940
 want to try those new things and 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.670
 then it's a good way to 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.770
 keep them motivated other things girls 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:33.550

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:36.610
 flame pump up there is a sensitive camera 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:39.540
 is focusing as because it is new but 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:41.790
 this application is called com 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.159
 for me girls this application is a 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.810
 community is like a social network of 

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:48.030
 fitness that helps inspire you 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.159
 find super good ideas about what 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.109
 eat about what to do and people who are 

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:54.629

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.099

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.959
 bananas with some bananas and some strawberries 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:44.730

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:47.400

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:04.830
 and I find it super super interesting but 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:06.480
 this is my name in the application and the 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:09.000
 light so if you want to follow me we're going to 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:11.160
 start a nice community and also 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.220
 You can share the exercises that 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:17.940
 you do and this page has here this 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:20.820
 option to start an exercise and 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:22.770
 simply you create your exercise and here 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:26.580
 tells you it's 25 minutes and that I 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:28.860
 think it's 76 calories and if you give it to 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.580
 start right there and tell you what 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.560
 do 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:35.169
 how are we talking about your mind 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.909
 He wants what he sees also your body 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:39.250
 he wants to eat what you have in the fridge 

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:40.810
 and another way to stay motivated is 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:42.520
 having pure healthy things in the 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:44.590
 refrigerator and change everything what are the 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:48.159
 cookies and the things baked by 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:49.870
 fruits or for a yogurt a diego yogurt 

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:52.030
 without sugar and these you can add a 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:53.919
 little agave or honey or make a 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:56.050
 natural port jam I feel 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:58.180
 that the more natural everything is 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:02.710
 while more natural as well as that of 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:04.780
 the earth to the human better our body 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:06.580
 he accepts it and we have better results 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.800
 in how we feel and the energy that 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:10.780
 we have and in how we see each other sincerely 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.430
 we can not lie that we do not want 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:14.680
 look good because this deserves 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.840
 important aspect and it helps a lot 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:19.300
 your self-esteem I want to tell you that when 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:22.150
 you begin to see results is 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:24.639
 an incredible way of motivation when 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:26.289
 you see results is to say as I look 

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:29.319
 I got the pants that I did not have 

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:31.689
 or I had a headache and now I do not 

00:05:29.319 --> 00:05:33.430
 I have before or look tired on 

00:05:31.689 --> 00:05:35.740
 the stairs and now I can upload them and 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:37.210
 go down a thousand times you will want to do 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:38.770
 that and you will not want to stop 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:40.990
 that is simply something that feels 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:44.139
 nice and you feel good and it's nice that 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:45.699
 we share all these ideas and 

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:48.759
 also if you have ideas of what to do 

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:50.590
 and some snacks leave them down here or 

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:52.750
 you can in the application or in my networks 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:54.639
 social because I feel that it is super 

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:57.280
 important that we have this 

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:59.110
 support and there are times that it costs a little 

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:01.270
 if we live in a people in a family 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:03.849
 a big house that everyone puts on 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:05.710
 the same lifestyle then it 

00:06:03.849 --> 00:06:07.419
 wants to have girls, we are going to have this 

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:08.710
 small section again and seriously not 

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:10.360
 I'm going to abandon them 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:12.220
 I will be putting videos all the 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:14.199
 weeks or a few weeks and a week not 

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:16.270
 because sometimes I'll honestly have another 

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:17.680
 content that you want to put but this is 

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:19.449
 an introductory video where I want 

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:21.070
 start and tell you that I'm going to 

00:06:19.449 --> 00:06:22.810
 go back to making healthy videos if you 

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:25.030
 Interested give me a little hand up 

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:26.710
 because if I'm going to know what you want 

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:28.030
 see more videos like this and that's going to 

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:29.650
 do with a lot of love 

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:32.320
 I'm planning to grab a new camera 

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:34.270
 I do not know if you can see it in this in this 

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:36.699
 video always receive something different and 

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:38.530
 I'm trying it I do not know yet how it looks 

00:06:36.699 --> 00:06:40.360
 because it does not have the little screen that 

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:42.139
 I look so I hope there is 

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:44.360
 the video was good 

00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:45.830

00:06:48.379 --> 00:06:52.249
 Now it's changing all the things that 

00:06:50.539 --> 00:06:55.039
 all cookies are baked and all 

00:06:52.249 --> 00:06:57.650
 the sweets and all the leaves and juices 

00:06:55.039 --> 00:06:59.330
 for natural things we are going to do this 

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:01.430
 let's remove all these cookies and 

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:05.870
 let's change them for bananas fruits 

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:07.669
 apples strawberries and things like that I feel 

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:09.800
 country you find me at least in the 

00:07:07.669 --> 00:07:11.960
 almond milk from oatmeal 

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:13.969
 and all those things that is to change to 

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:16.069
