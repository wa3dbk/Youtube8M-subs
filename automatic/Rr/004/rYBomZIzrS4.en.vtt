okay<00:00:00.420> so<00:00:00.480> in<00:00:00.630> this<00:00:00.750> video<00:00:00.900> we're<00:00:01.290> going<00:00:01.469> to

00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:01.680 
okay so in this video we're going to

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:03.889 
okay so in this video we're going to
look<00:00:01.890> at<00:00:02.159> an<00:00:02.429> effective<00:00:02.730> way<00:00:03.179> of<00:00:03.480> preventing

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899 
look at an effective way of preventing

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.960 
look at an effective way of preventing
form<00:00:04.890> spam<00:00:05.370> so<00:00:06.120> any<00:00:06.450> automated<00:00:07.670> messages<00:00:08.670> that

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
form spam so any automated messages that

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.129 
form spam so any automated messages that
are<00:00:09.830> received<00:00:10.830> as<00:00:11.250> part<00:00:11.700> of<00:00:12.000> a<00:00:12.179> form<00:00:12.509> based<00:00:12.900> on

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
are received as part of a form based on

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.860 
are received as part of a form based on
your<00:00:13.380> website<00:00:13.889> and<00:00:14.880> personally<00:00:15.420> I've<00:00:15.570> used

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
your website and personally I've used

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.540 
your website and personally I've used
this<00:00:16.049> and<00:00:16.320> it's<00:00:16.500> been<00:00:16.680> extremely<00:00:17.250> effective

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
this and it's been extremely effective

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.730 
this and it's been extremely effective
for<00:00:18.480> example<00:00:19.350> going<00:00:19.949> to<00:00:20.340> perhaps<00:00:20.820> 100<00:00:21.740> emails

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
for example going to perhaps 100 emails

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.970 
for example going to perhaps 100 emails
or<00:00:23.039> automated<00:00:23.400> emails<00:00:23.970> a<00:00:24.210> day<00:00:24.260> via<00:00:25.260> a<00:00:25.380> contact

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
or automated emails a day via a contact

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.019 
or automated emails a day via a contact
form<00:00:26.310> to<00:00:27.349> probably<00:00:28.349> not<00:00:28.619> even<00:00:28.740> one<00:00:29.070> a<00:00:29.099> week<00:00:29.400> so

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
form to probably not even one a week so

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.749 
form to probably not even one a week so
this<00:00:30.179> could<00:00:30.840> still<00:00:31.140> let<00:00:31.460> spam<00:00:32.460> through

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
this could still let spam through

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.150 
this could still let spam through
depending<00:00:33.690> on<00:00:33.780> how<00:00:34.050> your<00:00:34.410> site<00:00:34.770> is<00:00:34.950> being

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
depending on how your site is being

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.389 
depending on how your site is being
targeted<00:00:35.960> this<00:00:36.960> will<00:00:37.260> determine<00:00:37.649> obviously

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
targeted this will determine obviously

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.420 
targeted this will determine obviously
how<00:00:38.489> effective<00:00:39.000> is<00:00:39.180> but<00:00:39.870> it's<00:00:40.469> such<00:00:40.860> a<00:00:40.890> simple

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
how effective is but it's such a simple

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.880 
how effective is but it's such a simple
change<00:00:41.809> in<00:00:42.809> whatever<00:00:43.110> language<00:00:43.500> you're

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
change in whatever language you're

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.299 
change in whatever language you're
working<00:00:44.430> in<00:00:44.550> that<00:00:44.730> is<00:00:45.660> worth<00:00:45.899> giving<00:00:46.170> a<00:00:46.350> go<00:00:46.620> so

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
working in that is worth giving a go so

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.160 
working in that is worth giving a go so
I'm<00:00:47.579> working<00:00:47.820> in<00:00:48.030> PHP<00:00:48.270> I'm<00:00:48.930> going<00:00:49.110> to

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
I'm working in PHP I'm going to

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.229 
I'm working in PHP I'm going to
demonstrate<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.980> functionality<00:00:50.309> of<00:00:51.059> this

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
demonstrate the functionality of this

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.229 
demonstrate the functionality of this
and<00:00:51.510> how<00:00:51.660> to<00:00:51.719> prevent<00:00:52.399> this<00:00:53.399> this<00:00:53.850> kind<00:00:54.120> of

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
and how to prevent this this kind of

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.319 
and how to prevent this this kind of
form<00:00:54.750> spam<00:00:55.170> with<00:00:55.739> PHP<00:00:56.250> but<00:00:56.760> whatever<00:00:57.149> language

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
form spam with PHP but whatever language

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:58.910 
form spam with PHP but whatever language
you're<00:00:57.629> working<00:00:57.989> with<00:00:58.140> it<00:00:58.379> doesn't<00:00:58.710> matter

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
you're working with it doesn't matter

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.910 
you're working with it doesn't matter
the<00:00:59.370> theory<00:01:00.239> is<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.420> same<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:01.079> it's<00:01:01.469> equally

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
the theory is the same and it's equally

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.640 
the theory is the same and it's equally
as<00:01:02.070> easy<00:01:02.370> to<00:01:02.489> implement<00:01:02.879> with<00:01:03.780> any<00:01:03.930> web-based

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
as easy to implement with any web-based

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.280 
as easy to implement with any web-based
technologies<00:01:05.309> so<00:01:06.150> here<00:01:06.570> you<00:01:06.689> can<00:01:06.780> see<00:01:06.990> we<00:01:07.110> have

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
technologies so here you can see we have

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.140 
technologies so here you can see we have
a<00:01:07.320> contact<00:01:07.950> form<00:01:08.150> relatively

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
a contact form relatively

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.789 
a contact form relatively
straightforward<00:01:09.930> we<00:01:10.080> have<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.350> ability<00:01:10.710> to

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
straightforward we have the ability to

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.530 
straightforward we have the ability to
enter<00:01:11.070> a<00:01:11.100> name<00:01:11.340> email<00:01:11.760> address<00:01:11.909> and<00:01:12.090> a<00:01:12.240> query

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
enter a name email address and a query

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.750 
enter a name email address and a query
and<00:01:12.869> you<00:01:13.830> can<00:01:13.979> see<00:01:14.159> on<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.369> right<00:01:14.549> I've<00:01:14.729> just

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
and you can see on the right I've just

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.359 
and you can see on the right I've just
got<00:01:15.090> my<00:01:15.240> element<00:01:15.869> inspector<00:01:16.110> open<00:01:16.710> and<00:01:16.920> I<00:01:17.220> can

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
got my element inspector open and I can

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.280 
got my element inspector open and I can
just<00:01:17.520> have<00:01:17.640> a<00:01:17.700> look<00:01:17.880> at<00:01:18.090> what<00:01:18.659> we<00:01:18.780> have<00:01:18.960> in<00:01:19.080> the

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
just have a look at what we have in the

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.960 
just have a look at what we have in the
in<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.590> mark-up<00:01:20.040> because<00:01:20.369> we're<00:01:20.790> going<00:01:20.909> to

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
in the mark-up because we're going to

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.760 
in the mark-up because we're going to
make<00:01:21.090> some<00:01:21.270> sort<00:01:21.689> of<00:01:21.750> fundamental<00:01:22.350> changes<00:01:22.710> to

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
make some sort of fundamental changes to

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.390 
make some sort of fundamental changes to
the<00:01:22.920> mark-up<00:01:23.460> which<00:01:24.090> don't<00:01:24.390> affect<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.869> user

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 
the mark-up which don't affect the user

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.340 
the mark-up which don't affect the user
but<00:01:26.400> do<00:01:26.670> actually<00:01:27.030> affect<00:01:27.420> automated

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
but do actually affect automated

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.219 
but do actually affect automated
submission<00:01:29.340> of<00:01:29.430> this<00:01:29.579> form<00:01:29.909> so<00:01:30.150> we're<00:01:31.140> going

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
submission of this form so we're going

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.920 
submission of this form so we're going
to<00:01:31.290> consider<00:01:32.090> making<00:01:33.090> this<00:01:33.329> change<00:01:33.630> we're

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
to consider making this change we're

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.319 
to consider making this change we're
going<00:01:34.020> to<00:01:34.079> give<00:01:34.439> this<00:01:34.590> a<00:01:34.650> little<00:01:34.740> test<00:01:35.159> out<00:01:35.400> so

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
going to give this a little test out so

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:37.640 
going to give this a little test out so
at<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.540> moment<00:01:36.689> what's<00:01:37.020> going<00:01:37.200> to<00:01:37.229> happen<00:01:37.530> is

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
at the moment what's going to happen is

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.410 
at the moment what's going to happen is
I<00:01:37.860> can<00:01:38.009> go<00:01:38.130> ahead<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:38.369> enter<00:01:38.790> a<00:01:38.820> name<00:01:39.150> and

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
I can go ahead and enter a name and

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.350 
I can go ahead and enter a name and
email<00:01:39.810> address<00:01:40.079> and<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.770> query<00:01:41.130> and<00:01:41.430> by

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
email address and the query and by

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.480 
email address and the query and by
hitting<00:01:42.540> send<00:01:42.960> this<00:01:43.200> basically<00:01:43.649> pulls<00:01:44.250> us

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
hitting send this basically pulls us

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.690 
hitting send this basically pulls us
over<00:01:44.640> to<00:01:45.000> contact<00:01:45.630> PHP<00:01:46.409> detects<00:01:47.280> that<00:01:47.430> these

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
over to contact PHP detects that these

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.660 
over to contact PHP detects that these
fields<00:01:48.090> are<00:01:48.770> available<00:01:49.770> have<00:01:49.950> been<00:01:50.130> submitted

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
fields are available have been submitted

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.940 
fields are available have been submitted
to<00:01:50.700> us<00:01:50.880> and<00:01:51.299> then<00:01:51.840> just<00:01:51.869> outputs<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.590> text

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
to us and then just outputs the text

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.710 
to us and then just outputs the text
sends<00:01:53.250> us<00:01:53.340> an<00:01:53.460> email<00:01:53.820> we'd<00:01:54.030> actually<00:01:54.210> have<00:01:54.479> any

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
sends us an email we'd actually have any

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.899 
sends us an email we'd actually have any
functionality<00:01:55.290> working<00:01:56.130> in<00:01:56.250> this<00:01:56.369> instance

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
functionality working in this instance

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.880 
functionality working in this instance
now<00:01:57.600> let's<00:01:57.810> just<00:01:57.990> take<00:01:58.170> a<00:01:58.200> look<00:01:58.409> at<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.619> code

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
now let's just take a look at the code

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.639 
now let's just take a look at the code
here<00:01:59.820> we<00:01:59.969> can<00:02:00.090> see<00:02:00.329> that<00:02:00.450> we've<00:02:00.600> basically<00:02:01.200> got

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
here we can see that we've basically got

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:07.280 
here we can see that we've basically got
a<00:02:01.680> form<00:02:02.479> 3<00:02:03.479> field<00:02:04.259> so<00:02:04.950> for<00:02:05.700> a<00:02:05.729> name<00:02:06.030> email<00:02:06.630> and<00:02:06.930> a

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
a form 3 field so for a name email and a

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.559 
a form 3 field so for a name email and a
text<00:02:07.320> area<00:02:07.829> for<00:02:08.099> the<00:02:08.190> query<00:02:08.550> and<00:02:08.789> a<00:02:09.090> submit

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
text area for the query and a submit

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.420 
text area for the query and a submit
button<00:02:09.830> so<00:02:10.830> this<00:02:11.039> is<00:02:11.220> how<00:02:11.430> a

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
button so this is how a

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.880 
button so this is how a
but<00:02:12.579> would<00:02:12.849> see<00:02:13.180> your<00:02:13.719> code<00:02:14.019> and<00:02:14.319> it<00:02:14.709> would

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
but would see your code and it would

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.179 
but would see your code and it would
pick<00:02:15.609> up<00:02:15.640> on<00:02:15.879> the<00:02:16.000> fact<00:02:16.180> that<00:02:16.359> you<00:02:16.540> had<00:02:16.689> three

00:02:17.179 --> 00:02:17.189 
pick up on the fact that you had three

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:20.190 
pick up on the fact that you had three
input<00:02:18.189> fields<00:02:18.579> essentially<00:02:19.359> obviously

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
input fields essentially obviously

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.369 
input fields essentially obviously
textarea<00:02:20.920> isn't<00:02:21.519> an<00:02:21.640> input<00:02:22.269> element<00:02:23.019> but<00:02:23.230> it's

00:02:23.369 --> 00:02:23.379 
textarea isn't an input element but it's

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:26.670 
textarea isn't an input element but it's
still<00:02:24.329> you<00:02:25.329> know<00:02:25.359> an<00:02:25.870> element<00:02:26.290> that<00:02:26.349> you<00:02:26.500> would

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
still you know an element that you would

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.619 
still you know an element that you would
input<00:02:26.859> data<00:02:27.280> into<00:02:27.549> and<00:02:27.939> then<00:02:28.269> it<00:02:28.359> would<00:02:28.480> go

00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:28.629 
input data into and then it would go

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:31.020 
input data into and then it would go
ahead<00:02:28.750> fill<00:02:29.530> these<00:02:29.799> in<00:02:29.829> the<00:02:30.280> values<00:02:30.760> so

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
ahead fill these in the values so

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.740 
ahead fill these in the values so
something<00:02:31.480> like<00:02:31.510> value<00:02:32.079> equals<00:02:32.969> baat<00:02:33.969> or

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
something like value equals baat or

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.740 
something like value equals baat or
whatever<00:02:35.439> they<00:02:35.680> the<00:02:36.370> value<00:02:36.670> of<00:02:36.760> that<00:02:36.849> input<00:02:37.060> it

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
whatever they the value of that input it

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.179 
whatever they the value of that input it
would<00:02:37.900> do<00:02:37.989> the<00:02:38.109> same<00:02:38.260> for<00:02:38.439> the<00:02:38.530> other<00:02:38.680> two<00:02:38.769> and

00:02:39.179 --> 00:02:39.189 
would do the same for the other two and

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:41.789 
would do the same for the other two and
then<00:02:39.430> it<00:02:39.549> would<00:02:39.670> submit<00:02:40.030> this<00:02:40.180> form<00:02:40.799> now

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:41.799 
then it would submit this form now

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:46.890 
then it would submit this form now
there's<00:02:42.219> a<00:02:42.310> small<00:02:43.650> workaround<00:02:44.650> to<00:02:45.510> your<00:02:46.510> form

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
there's a small workaround to your form

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.690 
there's a small workaround to your form
adding<00:02:47.530> a<00:02:47.620> little<00:02:47.799> bit<00:02:47.919> more<00:02:48.040> markup<00:02:48.579> to

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
adding a little bit more markup to

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:49.979 
adding a little bit more markup to
protect<00:02:49.000> against<00:02:49.269> this<00:02:49.450> so<00:02:49.599> let's<00:02:49.750> go<00:02:49.810> ahead

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
protect against this so let's go ahead

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:51.839 
protect against this so let's go ahead
and<00:02:50.079> do<00:02:50.290> this<00:02:50.470> so<00:02:50.919> if<00:02:51.220> we<00:02:51.430> think<00:02:51.579> carefully

00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:51.849 
and do this so if we think carefully

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:54.210 
and do this so if we think carefully
about<00:02:52.150> this<00:02:52.419> you're<00:02:53.019> the<00:02:53.379> bot<00:02:53.799> filling<00:02:53.980> out

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
about this you're the bot filling out

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.940 
about this you're the bot filling out
the<00:02:54.340> form<00:02:54.669> isn't<00:02:55.389> probably<00:02:56.109> isn't<00:02:56.439> half<00:02:56.799> as

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
the form isn't probably isn't half as

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.309 
the form isn't probably isn't half as
intelligent<00:02:57.519> as<00:02:57.669> you<00:02:57.819> think<00:02:58.060> it<00:02:58.180> is<00:02:58.239> so<00:02:59.079> if<00:02:59.169> we

00:02:59.309 --> 00:02:59.319 
intelligent as you think it is so if we

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:00.690 
intelligent as you think it is so if we
were<00:02:59.409> to<00:02:59.530> go<00:02:59.650> ahead<00:02:59.829> and<00:02:59.950> introduce<00:03:00.189> another

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
were to go ahead and introduce another

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.629 
were to go ahead and introduce another
input<00:03:01.359> here<00:03:01.709> that<00:03:02.709> bot<00:03:02.980> would<00:03:03.159> probably

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:03.639 
input here that bot would probably

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:06.059 
input here that bot would probably
automatically<00:03:04.239> fill<00:03:04.510> that<00:03:04.689> in<00:03:04.930> so<00:03:05.650> let's<00:03:05.950> go

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:06.069 
automatically fill that in so let's go

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:08.039 
automatically fill that in so let's go
ahead<00:03:06.159> and<00:03:06.280> just<00:03:06.519> introduce<00:03:07.090> a<00:03:07.239> new<00:03:07.629> form

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:08.049 
ahead and just introduce a new form

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:10.379 
ahead and just introduce a new form
field<00:03:08.439> here<00:03:08.799> this<00:03:09.700> is<00:03:09.879> just<00:03:09.969> going<00:03:10.150> to<00:03:10.209> be<00:03:10.299> the

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:10.389 
field here this is just going to be the

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:13.020 
field here this is just going to be the
type<00:03:10.629> of<00:03:10.659> text<00:03:11.290> and<00:03:12.189> we'll<00:03:12.340> give<00:03:12.459> this<00:03:12.579> a<00:03:12.760> name

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
type of text and we'll give this a name

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.649 
type of text and we'll give this a name
and<00:03:13.269> let's<00:03:13.840> just<00:03:13.930> say<00:03:14.400> phone<00:03:15.400> for<00:03:15.819> example<00:03:15.909> or

00:03:16.649 --> 00:03:16.659 
and let's just say phone for example or

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:18.199 
and let's just say phone for example or
we<00:03:16.900> could<00:03:17.079> just<00:03:17.109> say<00:03:17.349> something<00:03:17.620> like<00:03:17.680> title

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
we could just say something like title

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:21.119 
we could just say something like title
so<00:03:19.209> what's<00:03:19.959> going<00:03:20.109> to<00:03:20.139> happen<00:03:20.440> now<00:03:20.680> is<00:03:20.919> we've

00:03:21.119 --> 00:03:21.129 
so what's going to happen now is we've

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:23.250 
so what's going to happen now is we've
introduced<00:03:21.549> a<00:03:21.699> new<00:03:21.909> form<00:03:22.150> onto<00:03:22.479> our<00:03:22.599> page<00:03:22.870> and

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
introduced a new form onto our page and

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:24.809 
introduced a new form onto our page and
when<00:03:23.530> we<00:03:23.680> refresh<00:03:23.949> we<00:03:24.069> can<00:03:24.280> see<00:03:24.549> that<00:03:24.669> that

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:24.819 
when we refresh we can see that that

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:28.770 
when we refresh we can see that that
form<00:03:25.150> is<00:03:25.389> in<00:03:25.840> fact<00:03:26.159> on<00:03:27.159> in<00:03:27.790> within<00:03:28.419> our<00:03:28.540> field

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
form is in fact on in within our field

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.770 
form is in fact on in within our field
set<00:03:29.199> now<00:03:29.799> the<00:03:30.579> reason<00:03:30.970> for<00:03:31.060> this<00:03:31.180> is<00:03:31.239> that<00:03:31.599> when

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
set now the reason for this is that when

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.179 
set now the reason for this is that when
a<00:03:32.430> bot<00:03:33.430> sort<00:03:33.729> of<00:03:33.790> hits<00:03:34.060> your<00:03:34.470> site<00:03:35.470> it's<00:03:36.099> going

00:03:36.179 --> 00:03:36.189 
a bot sort of hits your site it's going

00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:38.159 
a bot sort of hits your site it's going
to<00:03:36.340> fill<00:03:36.549> this<00:03:36.699> in<00:03:36.760> but<00:03:37.299> what<00:03:37.449> we<00:03:37.569> can<00:03:37.689> do<00:03:37.840> is<00:03:37.959> we

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:38.169 
to fill this in but what we can do is we

00:03:38.169 --> 00:03:39.689 
to fill this in but what we can do is we
know<00:03:38.500> that<00:03:38.739> we<00:03:38.859> don't<00:03:39.099> want<00:03:39.310> this<00:03:39.430> to<00:03:39.489> be

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:39.699 
know that we don't want this to be

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:42.089 
know that we don't want this to be
filled<00:03:39.970> in<00:03:40.120> it's<00:03:40.329> not<00:03:40.540> useful<00:03:40.780> to<00:03:41.019> us<00:03:41.199> so<00:03:41.979> we

00:03:42.089 --> 00:03:42.099 
filled in it's not useful to us so we

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:43.890 
filled in it's not useful to us so we
can<00:03:42.189> actually<00:03:42.340> detect<00:03:42.879> if<00:03:43.120> it<00:03:43.299> has<00:03:43.599> been

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
can actually detect if it has been

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.080 
can actually detect if it has been
filled<00:03:44.229> in<00:03:44.470> and<00:03:44.889> if<00:03:44.979> it<00:03:45.099> has<00:03:45.310> been<00:03:45.340> filled<00:03:45.879> in

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
filled in and if it has been filled in

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:47.939 
filled in and if it has been filled in
we<00:03:46.299> can<00:03:46.449> go<00:03:46.569> ahead<00:03:46.659> and<00:03:46.870> kill<00:03:47.229> our<00:03:47.409> page<00:03:47.680> or

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:47.949 
we can go ahead and kill our page or

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:50.009 
we can go ahead and kill our page or
something<00:03:48.250> like<00:03:48.370> that<00:03:48.430> so<00:03:49.359> let's<00:03:49.810> go<00:03:49.930> ahead

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
something like that so let's go ahead

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:52.020 
something like that so let's go ahead
and<00:03:50.109> first<00:03:50.319> of<00:03:50.560> all<00:03:50.650> hide<00:03:50.979> this<00:03:51.340> now<00:03:51.609> in<00:03:51.849> mice

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
and first of all hide this now in mice

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.749 
and first of all hide this now in mice
in<00:03:52.389> my<00:03:52.449> stylesheet<00:03:53.199> I<00:03:53.500> have<00:03:53.650> a<00:03:53.680> hidden<00:03:54.430> class

00:03:54.749 --> 00:03:54.759 
in my stylesheet I have a hidden class

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:56.550 
in my stylesheet I have a hidden class
which<00:03:55.479> basically<00:03:55.810> has<00:03:56.079> display:none

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
which basically has display:none

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.399 
which basically has display:none
visibility<00:03:57.549> hidden<00:03:57.900> I'm<00:03:58.900> using<00:03:59.109> both

00:03:59.399 --> 00:03:59.409 
visibility hidden I'm using both

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:01.289 
visibility hidden I'm using both
properties<00:03:59.729> purely<00:04:00.729> for<00:04:00.879> the<00:04:00.970> fact<00:04:01.000> that

00:04:01.289 --> 00:04:01.299 
properties purely for the fact that

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:04.170 
properties purely for the fact that
screen<00:04:01.840> readers<00:04:02.290> might<00:04:03.099> read<00:04:03.519> this<00:04:03.699> content

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
screen readers might read this content

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:05.909 
screen readers might read this content
out<00:04:04.389> if<00:04:04.599> it<00:04:04.750> still<00:04:05.139> has<00:04:05.379> if<00:04:05.590> it<00:04:05.739> has

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:05.919 
out if it still has if it has

00:04:05.919 --> 00:04:09.210 
out if it still has if it has
display:none<00:04:06.340> so<00:04:07.239> using<00:04:07.599> both<00:04:07.769> just<00:04:08.769> ensures

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
display:none so using both just ensures

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.249 
display:none so using both just ensures
that<00:04:09.250> the<00:04:09.879> majority<00:04:10.479> at<00:04:10.599> least<00:04:10.780> of<00:04:10.959> screen

00:04:11.249 --> 00:04:11.259 
that the majority at least of screen

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:14.219 
that the majority at least of screen
readers<00:04:11.709> for<00:04:11.889> visual<00:04:12.879> impaired<00:04:13.269> users<00:04:13.870> won't

00:04:14.219 --> 00:04:14.229 
readers for visual impaired users won't

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:17.039 
readers for visual impaired users won't
read<00:04:14.530> this<00:04:14.859> field<00:04:15.489> out<00:04:15.720> because<00:04:16.720> that<00:04:16.900> would

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 
read this field out because that would

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:19.170 
read this field out because that would
be<00:04:17.139> detrimental<00:04:17.380> to<00:04:17.799> their<00:04:18.250> experience<00:04:18.970> of

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
be detrimental to their experience of

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:20.729 
be detrimental to their experience of
using<00:04:19.359> your<00:04:19.599> site<00:04:19.870> they<00:04:20.079> might<00:04:20.289> think<00:04:20.529> that

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
using your site they might think that

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:23.430 
using your site they might think that
you<00:04:21.279> know<00:04:21.430> having<00:04:22.270> to<00:04:22.570> fill<00:04:22.750> out<00:04:22.900> this<00:04:23.110> field

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
you know having to fill out this field

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:24.650 
you know having to fill out this field
is<00:04:23.770> it's

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
is it's

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.410 
is it's
necessary<00:04:25.170> so<00:04:25.800> in<00:04:26.610> that<00:04:26.790> case<00:04:27.030> we<00:04:27.210> want<00:04:27.390> to

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:27.420 
necessary so in that case we want to

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.870 
necessary so in that case we want to
make<00:04:27.570> sure<00:04:27.600> it's<00:04:27.990> definitely<00:04:28.440> hidden<00:04:28.880> there

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
make sure it's definitely hidden there

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.060 
make sure it's definitely hidden there
might<00:04:30.480> be<00:04:30.510> some<00:04:31.020> situations<00:04:31.230> where<00:04:31.650> screen

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:32.070 
might be some situations where screen

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:34.670 
might be some situations where screen

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
readers will read this out but you know

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.920 
readers will read this out but you know
the<00:04:34.860> research<00:04:35.220> can<00:04:35.670> be<00:04:35.760> done<00:04:36.000> to<00:04:36.360> to<00:04:36.630> prevent

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
the research can be done to to prevent

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:38.990 
the research can be done to to prevent
this<00:04:37.140> go<00:04:37.350> ahead<00:04:37.440> and<00:04:37.590> and<00:04:37.860> check<00:04:38.430> which<00:04:38.610> screen

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
this go ahead and and check which screen

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.910 
this go ahead and and check which screen
readers<00:04:39.360> will<00:04:39.660> or<00:04:39.930> won't<00:04:40.110> read<00:04:40.380> this<00:04:40.530> out<00:04:40.740> or

readers will or won't read this out or

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.970 
readers will or won't read this out or
just<00:04:41.130> test<00:04:41.340> it<00:04:41.460> yourself<00:04:41.870> so<00:04:42.870> we<00:04:43.620> can<00:04:43.770> apply

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:43.980 
just test it yourself so we can apply

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:47.470 
just test it yourself so we can apply
the<00:04:44.420> hidden<00:04:45.420> class<00:04:45.780> to<00:04:46.050> this<00:04:46.170> element<00:04:46.530> and

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:47.480 
the hidden class to this element and

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.540 
the hidden class to this element and
let's<00:04:48.480> jump<00:04:48.870> back<00:04:48.990> over<00:04:49.710> to<00:04:49.830> our<00:04:49.860> actual<00:04:50.340> page

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
let's jump back over to our actual page

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.880 
let's jump back over to our actual page

we'll go ahead and just introduce a
little<00:05:03.960> bit<00:05:04.110> more<00:05:04.320> code<00:05:04.680> into<00:05:05.100> our<00:05:05.130> contact

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:05.790 
little bit more code into our contact

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:09.770 
little bit more code into our contact
PHP<00:05:06.510> page<00:05:06.750> now<00:05:08.270> basically<00:05:09.270> all<00:05:09.360> this<00:05:09.480> code

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:09.780 
PHP page now basically all this code

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:12.050 
PHP page now basically all this code
does<00:05:10.050> is<00:05:10.350> it<00:05:10.380> checks<00:05:10.740> if<00:05:10.980> the<00:05:11.100> name<00:05:11.370> email<00:05:11.880> and

does is it checks if the name email and
query<00:05:12.420> have<00:05:12.720> been<00:05:12.900> set<00:05:13.260> so<00:05:13.560> the<00:05:13.680> required

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:14.100 
query have been set so the required

query have been set so the required
fields<00:05:14.550> have<00:05:14.580> been<00:05:14.820> set<00:05:15.150> and<00:05:15.360> then<00:05:15.870> it<00:05:15.960> goes

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 
fields have been set and then it goes

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.870 
fields have been set and then it goes
ahead<00:05:16.200> and<00:05:16.320> echoes<00:05:16.860> this<00:05:17.100> send<00:05:17.400> us<00:05:17.550> an<00:05:17.700> email

ahead and echoes this send us an email

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.600 
ahead and echoes this send us an email
string<00:05:18.660> now<00:05:19.320> what<00:05:19.530> we<00:05:19.620> want<00:05:19.800> to<00:05:19.950> do<00:05:20.130> is<00:05:20.310> we<00:05:20.460> want

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:20.610 
string now what we want to do is we want

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:22.610 
string now what we want to do is we want
to<00:05:20.670> introduce<00:05:21.180> another<00:05:21.330> check<00:05:21.960> in<00:05:22.170> here<00:05:22.410> and

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:22.620 
to introduce another check in here and

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:24.470 
to introduce another check in here and
again<00:05:22.770> whichever<00:05:23.460> language<00:05:23.970> you're<00:05:24.120> working

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:24.480 
again whichever language you're working

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:26.870 
again whichever language you're working
with<00:05:24.660> it<00:05:25.020> doesn't<00:05:25.350> matter<00:05:25.670> we<00:05:26.670> want<00:05:26.820> to

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:26.880 
with it doesn't matter we want to

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:30.260 
with it doesn't matter we want to
introduce<00:05:27.060> another<00:05:28.520> check<00:05:29.520> to<00:05:29.790> basically

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:30.270 
introduce another check to basically

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:33.860 
introduce another check to basically
just<00:05:30.570> say<00:05:30.810> if<00:05:31.290> this<00:05:32.010> form<00:05:32.520> field<00:05:33.270> that<00:05:33.720> we

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:33.870 
just say if this form field that we

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:36.530 
just say if this form field that we
don't<00:05:34.740> want<00:05:34.980> to<00:05:35.040> be<00:05:35.190> filled<00:05:35.490> in<00:05:35.640> is<00:05:35.880> set<00:05:36.210> so

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:36.540 
don't want to be filled in is set so

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:39.590 
don't want to be filled in is set so
title<00:05:37.220> and<00:05:38.220> we<00:05:38.340> also<00:05:38.490> want<00:05:38.790> to<00:05:38.820> check<00:05:39.210> if<00:05:39.420> it's

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:39.600 
title and we also want to check if it's

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:45.370 
title and we also want to check if it's
not<00:05:40.050> empty

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:45.380 

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:48.830 

so<00:05:46.380> basically<00:05:46.950> has<00:05:47.580> this<00:05:47.850> field<00:05:48.210> been<00:05:48.540> filled

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:48.840 
so basically has this field been filled

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.380 
so basically has this field been filled
in<00:05:49.110> if<00:05:49.560> it<00:05:49.740> has<00:05:49.980> then<00:05:50.340> in<00:05:50.700> my<00:05:50.910> case<00:05:50.940> I'm<00:05:51.360> going

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:51.390 
in if it has then in my case I'm going

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:54.230 
in if it has then in my case I'm going
to<00:05:51.570> use<00:05:51.720> the<00:05:51.930> PHP<00:05:52.650> Die<00:05:52.980> function<00:05:53.700> which<00:05:54.120> will

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:54.240 
to use the PHP Die function which will

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.030 
to use the PHP Die function which will
basically<00:05:54.360> kill<00:05:55.080> the<00:05:55.260> page<00:05:55.470> and<00:05:55.740> it<00:05:55.800> won't

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:56.040 
basically kill the page and it won't

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:59.930 
basically kill the page and it won't
allow<00:05:56.400> any<00:05:56.669> further<00:05:57.500> any<00:05:58.500> further<00:05:58.940> execution

00:05:59.930 --> 00:05:59.940 
allow any further any further execution

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:03.230 
allow any further any further execution
if<00:06:00.060> you<00:06:00.180> like<00:06:00.330> or<00:06:01.160> anything<00:06:02.160> passed<00:06:02.880> this<00:06:03.090> to

if you like or anything passed this to

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:06.110 
if you like or anything passed this to
be<00:06:03.360> run<00:06:03.570> so<00:06:04.530> now<00:06:04.710> what<00:06:04.890> we<00:06:05.010> do<00:06:05.160> is<00:06:05.310> we<00:06:05.490> can<00:06:05.640> still

just going to add say mr. so if this
field<00:06:26.370> has<00:06:26.640> been<00:06:26.880> filled<00:06:27.240> out<00:06:27.950> by<00:06:28.950> looking<00:06:29.160> at

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:29.370 
field has been filled out by looking at

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:31.940 
field has been filled out by looking at
the<00:06:29.430> source<00:06:29.730> our<00:06:30.090> bot<00:06:30.300> by<00:06:30.630> BOTS<00:06:31.560> looking<00:06:31.860> at

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:31.950 
the source our bot by BOTS looking at

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:34.279 
the source our bot by BOTS looking at
the<00:06:32.040> source<00:06:32.310> when<00:06:33.240> we<00:06:33.330> hit<00:06:33.479> send<00:06:33.870> nothing

00:06:34.279 --> 00:06:34.289 
the source when we hit send nothing

00:06:34.289 --> 00:06:37.100 
the source when we hit send nothing
happened<00:06:34.770> so<00:06:34.950> what's<00:06:35.789> happened<00:06:36.210> now<00:06:36.240> is<00:06:36.390> bot

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:37.110 
happened so what's happened now is bot

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:37.959 
happened so what's happened now is bot
has<00:06:37.260> come<00:06:37.470> along

00:06:37.959 --> 00:06:37.969 
has come along

00:06:37.969 --> 00:06:40.359 
has come along
seen<00:06:38.389> these<00:06:38.629> four<00:06:38.929> fields<00:06:39.499> filled<00:06:39.889> out<00:06:40.159> off

00:06:40.359 --> 00:06:40.369 
seen these four fields filled out off

00:06:40.369 --> 00:06:42.789 
seen these four fields filled out off
all<00:06:40.669> four<00:06:41.149> fields<00:06:41.659> but<00:06:42.139> we<00:06:42.169> as<00:06:42.589> developers

00:06:42.789 --> 00:06:42.799 
all four fields but we as developers

00:06:42.799 --> 00:06:45.279 
all four fields but we as developers
know<00:06:43.459> that<00:06:43.879> that<00:06:44.089> field<00:06:44.479> shouldn't<00:06:45.019> have<00:06:45.110> been

00:06:45.279 --> 00:06:45.289 
know that that field shouldn't have been

00:06:45.289 --> 00:06:47.109 
know that that field shouldn't have been
filled<00:06:45.559> out<00:06:45.799> and<00:06:46.069> therefore<00:06:46.699> we<00:06:46.789> can<00:06:46.939> just

00:06:47.109 --> 00:06:47.119 
filled out and therefore we can just

00:06:47.119 --> 00:06:49.509 
filled out and therefore we can just
kill<00:06:47.329> the<00:06:47.449> page<00:06:47.559> so<00:06:48.559> what<00:06:48.679> we've<00:06:48.799> now<00:06:48.829> done<00:06:49.099> is

00:06:49.509 --> 00:06:49.519 
kill the page so what we've now done is

00:06:49.519 --> 00:06:52.389 
kill the page so what we've now done is
and<00:06:49.909> that<00:06:50.569> is<00:06:50.749> it<00:06:50.989> we've<00:06:51.709> implemented<00:06:52.129> a

00:06:52.389 --> 00:06:52.399 
and that is it we've implemented a

00:06:52.399 --> 00:06:55.479 
and that is it we've implemented a
simple<00:06:52.699> solution<00:06:53.209> to<00:06:53.739> basically<00:06:54.739> kill<00:06:55.129> a<00:06:55.159> page

00:06:55.479 --> 00:06:55.489 
simple solution to basically kill a page

00:06:55.489 --> 00:06:58.209 
simple solution to basically kill a page
if<00:06:55.909> a<00:06:56.599> hidden<00:06:56.899> field<00:06:57.229> has<00:06:57.529> been<00:06:57.709> filled<00:06:58.009> out

00:06:58.209 --> 00:06:58.219 
if a hidden field has been filled out

00:06:58.219 --> 00:07:01.809 
if a hidden field has been filled out
which<00:06:58.849> obviously<00:06:59.599> we<00:07:00.110> don't<00:07:00.319> require<00:07:00.819> and

00:07:01.809 --> 00:07:01.819 
which obviously we don't require and

00:07:01.819 --> 00:07:05.709 
which obviously we don't require and
that<00:07:01.849> is<00:07:02.299> it<00:07:02.889> as<00:07:03.889> I<00:07:04.339> said<00:07:04.579> I've<00:07:04.879> used<00:07:05.209> this<00:07:05.419> and

00:07:05.709 --> 00:07:05.719 
that is it as I said I've used this and

00:07:05.719 --> 00:07:09.279 
that is it as I said I've used this and
it's<00:07:06.439> been<00:07:06.799> extremely<00:07:07.429> effective<00:07:07.899> so<00:07:08.899> you

00:07:09.279 --> 00:07:09.289 
it's been extremely effective so you

00:07:09.289 --> 00:07:11.079 
it's been extremely effective so you
know<00:07:09.799> if<00:07:09.979> you<00:07:10.189> are<00:07:10.339> suffering<00:07:10.699> with<00:07:10.759> the<00:07:10.909> same

00:07:11.079 --> 00:07:11.089 
know if you are suffering with the same

00:07:11.089 --> 00:07:13.499 
know if you are suffering with the same
problem<00:07:11.509> go<00:07:11.659> ahead<00:07:11.779> and<00:07:11.989> implement<00:07:12.259> it<00:07:12.679> and

00:07:13.499 --> 00:07:13.509 
problem go ahead and implement it and

00:07:13.509 --> 00:07:18.279 
problem go ahead and implement it and
hopefully<00:07:14.509> it<00:07:14.929> will<00:07:15.079> be<00:07:15.139> as<00:07:15.499> effective
