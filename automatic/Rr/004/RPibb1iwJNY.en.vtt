more<00:02:31.519> aggressive<00:02:33.730> besides<00:02:34.730> of<00:02:34.880> being<00:02:35.060> a

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
more aggressive besides of being a

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:37.090 
more aggressive besides of being a
little<00:02:35.450> more<00:02:35.540> aggressive<00:02:36.019> but<00:02:36.650> they<00:02:36.800> still

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
retain a lot of like the basic quality

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:41.770 
retain a lot of like the basic quality
qualities<00:02:40.489> of<00:02:40.519> these<00:02:40.790> wonderful<00:02:41.150> instruments

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
qualities of these wonderful instruments

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.970 
qualities of these wonderful instruments
they<00:02:42.320> have<00:02:43.420> transparency<00:02:44.420> they<00:02:45.019> have<00:02:45.170> fatness

they have transparency they have fatness

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.020 
they have transparency they have fatness
and<00:02:46.510> they<00:02:47.510> have<00:02:47.690> a<00:02:47.950> lot<00:02:48.950> of<00:02:49.030> articulation

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
and they have a lot of articulation

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
and they have a lot of articulation
which<00:02:50.570> is<00:02:51.040> hard<00:02:52.040> to<00:02:52.250> show<00:02:52.519> with<00:02:53.120> a<00:02:53.420> power<00:02:53.810> soap

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
which is hard to show with a power soap

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.080 
which is hard to show with a power soap
I<00:02:54.410> mean<00:02:54.680> that<00:02:55.010> it<00:02:55.310> does<00:02:55.459> a<00:02:55.489> very<00:02:55.580> good<00:02:55.820> job

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
I mean that it does a very good job

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.330 
I mean that it does a very good job
otherwise<00:02:56.810> we<00:02:57.050> probably<00:02:57.320> commit<00:02:57.890> suicide

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
otherwise we probably commit suicide

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.130 
otherwise we probably commit suicide
over<00:02:58.519> here<00:02:58.730> because<00:02:58.970> of<00:02:59.090> the<00:02:59.180> volume<00:02:59.570> because

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
over here because of the volume because

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.590 
over here because of the volume because
ease<00:03:00.320> of<00:03:00.530> really<00:03:00.830> loud<00:03:01.010> amps<00:03:01.340> but<00:03:01.820> if<00:03:02.209> you<00:03:02.390> play

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
ease of really loud amps but if you play

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.470 
ease of really loud amps but if you play
in<00:03:02.750> a<00:03:02.840> full<00:03:03.320> volume<00:03:03.620> the<00:03:04.430> guitar<00:03:04.760> offers<00:03:05.150> a<00:03:05.180> lot

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
in a full volume the guitar offers a lot

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.229 
in a full volume the guitar offers a lot
of<00:03:05.510> different<00:03:05.989> colors<00:03:06.320> it's<00:03:07.190> very<00:03:07.400> sensitive

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
of different colors it's very sensitive

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:10.960 
of different colors it's very sensitive
to<00:03:08.540> what<00:03:08.780> you<00:03:09.739> do<00:03:09.890> with<00:03:10.100> the<00:03:10.280> volume<00:03:10.610> control
