for the next step so what I like to do

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:51.849 
for the next step so what I like to do
is<00:02:50.030> I<00:02:50.450> don't<00:02:50.900> really<00:02:51.019> use<00:02:51.170> my<00:02:51.200> sim<00:02:51.620> tool<00:02:51.829> I

should<00:03:13.489> read<00:03:13.700> it<00:03:13.730> in<00:03:14.330> a<00:03:14.420> second<00:03:16.690> we<00:03:17.690> can

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
should read it in a second we can

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.750 
should read it in a second we can
probably<00:03:18.200> actually<00:03:18.530> begin<00:03:18.980> activation<00:03:19.550> here

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
probably actually begin activation here

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.259 
probably actually begin activation here
as<00:03:19.880> well<00:03:20.090> it's<00:03:20.989> a<00:03:21.110> setting<00:03:21.380> language<00:03:22.090> you<00:03:23.090> can

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:23.269 
as well it's a setting language you can

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:25.000 
as well it's a setting language you can
change<00:03:23.569> this<00:03:23.840> later<00:03:24.080> inside<00:03:24.410> of<00:03:24.560> settings<00:03:24.860> if

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
change this later inside of settings if

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:30.990 
change this later inside of settings if
you<00:03:25.160> so<00:03:25.400> desire

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.520 

and<00:03:31.510> I<00:03:31.570> don't<00:03:31.690> know<00:03:31.810> if<00:03:31.870> you<00:03:31.930> guys<00:03:32.050> can<00:03:32.230> see<00:03:32.260> pit

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
in the background it is actually in the

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.420 
in the background it is actually in the
process<00:03:34.450> of<00:03:34.900> activating<00:03:35.080> i<00:03:35.620> believe<00:03:35.860> so

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
process of activating i believe so

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.820 
process of activating i believe so
that's<00:03:36.640> good<00:03:37.110> so<00:03:38.110> here<00:03:38.410> we<00:03:38.560> have<00:03:38.590> our

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:38.830

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:42.270 
that's good so here we have our
selectors<00:03:39.550> and<00:03:39.640> everything<00:03:40.860> so<00:03:41.860> that<00:03:41.890> I<00:03:42.040> don't
