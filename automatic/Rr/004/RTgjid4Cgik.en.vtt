00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:34.400 
so I'll start off we're going to put the

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.800 
so I'll start off we're going to put the
cheapest<00:00:34.670> ingredients<00:00:34.820> in<00:00:35.180> first<00:00:35.360> one<00:00:35.600> to<00:00:35.660> put

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:35.810 
cheapest ingredients in first one to put

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:37.870 
cheapest ingredients in first one to put
in<00:00:35.870> the<00:00:35.930> meaning<00:00:36.170> the<00:00:36.530> cucumber<00:00:37.010> and<00:00:37.220> put<00:00:37.760> in

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:37.880 
in the meaning the cucumber and put in

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.479 
in the meaning the cucumber and put in
the<00:00:38.210> language<00:00:38.630> sugar<00:00:39.110> as<00:00:39.230> well<00:00:39.260> I<00:00:39.650> like<00:00:40.190> I<00:00:40.280> said

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:40.489 
the language sugar as well I like I said

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:41.830 
the language sugar as well I like I said
that<00:00:40.700> the<00:00:40.879> makeup<00:00:41.210> of<00:00:41.330> the<00:00:41.420> drink<00:00:41.690> is

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:41.840 
that the makeup of the drink is

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.780 
that the makeup of the drink is
essentially<00:00:42.410> a<00:00:42.440> daiquiri<00:00:42.800> so<00:00:43.309> you've<00:00:43.430> got<00:00:43.640> the

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:43.790 
essentially a daiquiri so you've got the

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.450 
essentially a daiquiri so you've got the
caddy<00:00:44.150> superior<00:00:44.660> landing<00:00:45.379> sugar<00:00:45.620> you've<00:00:46.280> then

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 
caddy superior landing sugar you've then

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.720 
caddy superior landing sugar you've then
got<00:00:46.700> the<00:00:46.940> addition<00:00:47.480> of<00:00:47.540> a<00:00:47.660> fruit<00:00:47.930> cucumber<00:00:48.860> and

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730 
got the addition of a fruit cucumber and

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.000 
got the addition of a fruit cucumber and
then<00:00:49.879> a<00:00:49.910> herb<00:00:50.210> in<00:00:50.510> this<00:00:50.690> case<00:00:50.900> means<00:00:51.230> the<00:00:51.860> whole

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010 
then a herb in this case means the whole

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:53.680 
then a herb in this case means the whole
thing<00:00:52.190> shaken<00:00:52.580> together<00:00:52.700> and<00:00:53.120> they<00:00:53.300> double

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 
thing shaken together and they double

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:54.820 
thing shaken together and they double
straighten<00:00:53.960> it<00:00:54.020> and<00:00:54.050> compare<00:00:54.500> which<00:00:54.710> is

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:54.830 
straighten it and compare which is

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:58.420 
straighten it and compare which is
rinsed<00:00:55.129> with<00:00:55.190> absinthe<00:00:55.699> with<00:00:56.150> a<00:00:56.239> spatula<00:00:57.430> so

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:58.430 
rinsed with absinthe with a spatula so

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.330 
rinsed with absinthe with a spatula so

views so I would say and then the hero
or<00:02:01.010> the<00:02:01.160> drink

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:10.930 

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:14.440 

this<00:02:11.930> is<00:02:12.110> ice<00:02:12.370> that<00:02:13.370> we<00:02:13.489> get<00:02:13.670> in<00:02:13.819> every<00:02:14.180> day<00:02:14.330> we

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
this is ice that we get in every day we

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.119 
this is ice that we get in every day we
get<00:02:14.629> huge<00:02:14.810> block<00:02:15.080> of<00:02:15.110> it<00:02:15.379> which<00:02:15.739> is<00:02:15.920> all-aware

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:16.129 
get huge block of it which is all-aware

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:17.440 
get huge block of it which is all-aware
there<00:02:16.459> so<00:02:16.760> I'm<00:02:16.849> going<00:02:16.940> to<00:02:17.030> share<00:02:17.209> it<00:02:17.269> with<00:02:17.420> a

there so I'm going to share it with a

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:34.440 
there so I'm going to share it with a
big<00:02:17.660> piece

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.580 

I'm<00:02:35.450> going<00:02:35.750> to<00:02:35.810> check<00:02:35.990> it<00:02:36.140> for<00:02:36.290> a<00:02:36.320> couple<00:02:36.530> of

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
I'm going to check it for a couple of

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:37.810 
I'm going to check it for a couple of
seconds<00:02:36.920> because<00:02:37.130> again<00:02:37.520> there's<00:02:37.670> going<00:02:37.760> to

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:37.820 
seconds because again there's going to

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.480 
seconds because again there's going to
be<00:02:37.910> a<00:02:38.380> another<00:02:39.380> dilution<00:02:39.890> element<00:02:40.370> in

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:40.490 
be a another dilution element in

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:42.550 
be a another dilution element in
templates<00:02:40.940> order<00:02:41.330> the<00:02:41.780> spritz<00:02:42.110> that's<00:02:42.350> going

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560

00:02:42.560 --> 00:03:04.820 
templates order the spritz that's going
on<00:02:42.620> top<00:02:42.800> of<00:02:42.860> it

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.839 

this<00:03:05.610> is<00:03:05.730> the<00:03:05.850> Absinthe<00:03:06.180> pan

00:03:07.839 --> 00:03:07.849 
this is the Absinthe pan

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:12.140 
this is the Absinthe pan
so<00:03:08.360> just<00:03:08.540> around<00:03:08.780> the<00:03:08.900> glass

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150
