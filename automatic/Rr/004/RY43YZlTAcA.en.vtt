00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:07.680
 and we are in a new me of minecraft and 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.030
 as I said in my last video of 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.050
 minecraft that the truth is that it makes 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.360
 time of that 

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:14.860
 it's going to be a very, very short video because 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.760
 The only thing I want to show you is that 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:21.700
 look to the left below as it puts 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.100
 8.1 alpha minecraft pocket edition and 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.860
 good 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.080
 the truth is that they do not experience many 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:30.600
 changes and it has been a surprise 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.120
 totally since nobody expected it 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.950
 but the only thing is that the real 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.460
 that used to not work now 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.050
 They work perfectly because for 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.750
 example if it did not integrate when you affirm 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:46.870
 that was a video got into my world 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:49.530
 and it seemed another different world with 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:52.230
 mine with what was on the map and 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.629
 and with another mixed it was a very strange river 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.170
 and well that's settled then 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.350
 as well 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:01.720
 right here then also not before 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.879
 I could not even write 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:08.030
 OK 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:12.700
 before it could not be described and now it 's a 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:14.829
 put it perfectly 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:18.130
 for example before if you were going to create a 

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:20.289
 world or something good I was trying 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.509
 determine the server as a boy 

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:26.260
 he asked me to give me to play 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:29.950
 with him and have not worked it 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:31.930
 I wrote and I got nothing came in 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.360
 the writing screen in the block 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:36.220
 let's say writing and when I gave it 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.530
 because because my mobile phone has 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.790
 corrector because I put down what I 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.250
 I was writing at that time and what 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:45.580
 I could see but when you gave him to accept 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:47.390
 to put it then I put that not that no 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.600
 it worked 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:54.470
 so good simply to what you 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:57.470
 I will leave the link of the definition is valid and 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:02:00.610
 Well I hope you liked your video 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.610
 listen to him in his life 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:09.619
 I liked the last videos 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:11.800
 consumed and well then that until 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:11.800
 then 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.349
 to see if we do not have how much the hose to 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.349
 God
