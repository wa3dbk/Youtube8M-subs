00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:20.859 
and they're going to be sparse from now

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:23.370 
and they're going to be sparse from now
this<00:04:21.790> is<00:04:21.910> a<00:04:21.940> kind<00:04:22.210> of<00:04:22.300> second<00:04:22.720> recording<00:04:23.170> out

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
this is a kind of second recording out

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:24.900 
this is a kind of second recording out
of<00:04:23.530> three<00:04:23.800> though<00:04:23.950> our<00:04:24.100> fat<00:04:24.310> so<00:04:24.580> kind<00:04:24.790> of

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910 
of three though our fat so kind of

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:27.270 
of three though our fat so kind of
cramping<00:04:25.570> very<00:04:26.290> quickly<00:04:26.620> which<00:04:26.890> means<00:04:27.160> i

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
cramping very quickly which means i
