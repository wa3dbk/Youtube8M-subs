00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
fire resistance will kick in and stop

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.740 
fire resistance will kick in and stop
the<00:01:43.950> flames<00:01:44.250> you<00:01:44.520> can<00:01:44.909> also<00:01:45.060> fill<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.450> bucket

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
the flames you can also fill the bucket

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.690 
the flames you can also fill the bucket
up<00:01:45.869> with<00:01:45.899> water<00:01:46.320> or<00:01:46.560> lava<00:01:46.680> in<00:01:47.009> between<00:01:47.399> finding

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
up with water or lava in between finding

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.420 
up with water or lava in between finding
milk<00:01:48.060> teas<00:01:48.360> that<00:01:48.390> in<00:01:48.810> combat<00:01:49.200> as<00:01:49.320> well<00:01:49.350> and<00:01:49.860> I

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
milk teas that in combat as well and I

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.310 
milk teas that in combat as well and I
recommend<00:01:50.970> using<00:01:51.149> this<00:01:51.450> if<00:01:51.689> you<00:01:51.960> have<00:01:52.079> a<00:01:52.110> cow

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
recommend using this if you have a cow

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.469 
recommend using this if you have a cow
nearby<00:01:52.680> you<00:01:52.740> can<00:01:53.100> drink<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.549> milk<00:01:53.729> then<00:01:54.299> you

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
nearby you can drink the milk then you

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.359 
nearby you can drink the milk then you
can<00:01:54.659> fill<00:01:54.899> up<00:01:55.079> on<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.590> cow<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:55.979> you<00:01:56.040> can<00:01:56.250> go

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
can fill up on the cow and you can go

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.429 
can fill up on the cow and you can go
attack<00:01:56.700> somebody<00:01:57.180> I<00:01:57.329> also<00:01:57.600> recommend<00:01:57.990> at<00:01:58.229> some

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
attack somebody I also recommend at some

00:01:58.439 --> 00:01:59.660 
attack somebody I also recommend at some
point<00:01:58.619> during<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:58.920> game<00:01:59.070> if<00:01:59.250> you<00:01:59.280> happen<00:01:59.640> to

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
point during the game if you happen to

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.249 
point during the game if you happen to
come<00:01:59.880> across<00:02:00.000> account<00:02:00.570> that<00:02:00.780> you<00:02:00.869> don't<00:02:01.079> need

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
come across account that you don't need

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.080 
come across account that you don't need
for<00:02:01.469> food<00:02:01.649> you<00:02:01.860> can<00:02:02.009> push<00:02:02.219> it<00:02:02.369> into<00:02:02.520> a<00:02:02.670> hole<00:02:02.909> and

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
for food you can push it into a hole and

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.020 
for food you can push it into a hole and
you<00:02:03.180> can<00:02:03.750> use<00:02:03.930> it<00:02:04.079> for<00:02:04.350> a<00:02:04.530> milk<00:02:05.100> refill<00:02:05.790> later

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
you can use it for a milk refill later

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.940 
you can use it for a milk refill later
on<00:02:06.240> when<00:02:06.689> you<00:02:06.780> can't<00:02:07.020> find<00:02:07.229> any<00:02:07.380> cows<00:02:07.619> on<00:02:07.860> the

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
on when you can't find any cows on the

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.290 
on when you can't find any cows on the
map<00:02:08.129> because<00:02:08.340> they've<00:02:08.640> been<00:02:08.759> killed<00:02:09.030> by<00:02:09.179> other

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
map because they've been killed by other

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.699 
map because they've been killed by other
players<00:02:09.569> just<00:02:09.660> write<00:02:10.140> down<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.440> coordinates

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
players just write down the coordinates

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:11.420 
players just write down the coordinates
of<00:02:11.039> the<00:02:11.129> cow

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
of the cow

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.250 
of the cow
you<00:02:11.489> push<00:02:11.700> into<00:02:11.879> the<00:02:12.060> hole<00:02:12.239> what<00:02:12.780> I<00:02:12.810> don't<00:02:13.079> like

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
you push into the hole what I don't like

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.380 
you push into the hole what I don't like
most<00:02:13.560> about<00:02:13.799> the<00:02:14.010> milkman<00:02:14.400> kit<00:02:14.730> is<00:02:14.969> the<00:02:15.180> fact

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
most about the milkman kit is the fact

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.149 
most about the milkman kit is the fact
that<00:02:15.480> it<00:02:15.689> says<00:02:15.989> that<00:02:16.260> you're<00:02:16.409> a<00:02:16.439> milkman<00:02:16.890> to

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:17.159 
that it says that you're a milkman to

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:18.860 
that it says that you're a milkman to
the<00:02:17.280> whole<00:02:17.549> server<00:02:17.909> so<00:02:18.269> once<00:02:18.480> you<00:02:18.599> use<00:02:18.840> it

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
the whole server so once you use it

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.720 
the whole server so once you use it
everybody<00:02:19.590> on<00:02:19.709> the<00:02:19.829> server<00:02:20.040> knows<00:02:20.310> what<00:02:20.609> you

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
everybody on the server knows what you

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.670 
everybody on the server knows what you
are<00:02:20.879> and<00:02:21.090> they<00:02:21.420> can<00:02:21.480> plan<00:02:21.810> to<00:02:21.870> counter<00:02:22.200> against

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
are and they can plan to counter against

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:23.509 
are and they can plan to counter against
you<00:02:22.799> accordingly

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
you accordingly

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:25.039 
you accordingly
I<00:02:23.549> also<00:02:23.879> don't<00:02:24.150> like<00:02:24.269> the<00:02:24.450> fact<00:02:24.659> that<00:02:24.780> you<00:02:24.930> only

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:25.049 
I also don't like the fact that you only

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:26.869 
I also don't like the fact that you only
have<00:02:25.230> five<00:02:25.409> uses<00:02:25.680> for<00:02:26.040> this<00:02:26.189> kit<00:02:26.430> I<00:02:26.579> think<00:02:26.790> it

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:26.879 
have five uses for this kit I think it

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:28.459 
have five uses for this kit I think it
helps<00:02:27.180> level<00:02:27.390> off<00:02:27.569> the<00:02:27.719> power<00:02:27.959> a<00:02:28.049> little<00:02:28.349> bit

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:28.469 
helps level off the power a little bit

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:30.440 
helps level off the power a little bit
but<00:02:28.680> it<00:02:28.799> also<00:02:28.980> makes<00:02:29.280> this<00:02:29.519> kit<00:02:29.760> difficult<00:02:30.359> to

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
but it also makes this kit difficult to

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.959 
but it also makes this kit difficult to
use<00:02:30.599> after<00:02:31.379> you've<00:02:31.590> used<00:02:32.069> it<00:02:32.280> five<00:02:32.489> times<00:02:32.700> you

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:32.969 
use after you've used it five times you

00:02:32.969 --> 00:02:34.940 
use after you've used it five times you
can't<00:02:33.209> use<00:02:33.389> it<00:02:33.420> again<00:02:33.780> and<00:02:33.930> then<00:02:34.500> you<00:02:34.709> are

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
can't use it again and then you are

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.860 
can't use it again and then you are
stuck<00:02:35.219> just<00:02:35.459> using<00:02:35.849> the<00:02:35.939> bucket<00:02:36.060> for<00:02:36.359> lava<00:02:36.569> or

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
stuck just using the bucket for lava or

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.990 
stuck just using the bucket for lava or
something<00:02:37.260> can<00:02:37.859> also<00:02:38.040> be<00:02:38.310> a<00:02:38.340> challenge<00:02:38.790> if<00:02:38.969> you

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
something can also be a challenge if you

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.119 
something can also be a challenge if you
don't<00:02:39.329> have<00:02:39.480> a<00:02:39.510> cowl<00:02:39.780> nearby<00:02:40.230> to<00:02:40.290> refill<00:02:40.859> up<00:02:40.980> on

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:41.129 
don't have a cowl nearby to refill up on

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:43.640 
don't have a cowl nearby to refill up on
milk<00:02:41.400> teas<00:02:41.639> the<00:02:41.939> kit<00:02:42.150> even<00:02:43.109> with<00:02:43.290> the<00:02:43.439> five

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
milk teas the kit even with the five

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.559 
milk teas the kit even with the five
years<00:02:43.889> limit<00:02:44.280> this<00:02:44.579> is<00:02:44.669> a<00:02:44.730> very<00:02:44.970> good<00:02:45.180> kit<00:02:45.450> and

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
years limit this is a very good kit and

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:47.390 
years limit this is a very good kit and
you<00:02:45.629> can<00:02:45.810> save<00:02:46.049> the<00:02:46.230> uses<00:02:46.560> to<00:02:46.769> the<00:02:46.889> feast<00:02:47.159> which

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
you can save the uses to the feast which

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.190 
you can save the uses to the feast which
I<00:02:47.519> recommend<00:02:47.700> having<00:02:48.120> a<00:02:48.359> couple<00:02:48.689> stacked<00:02:48.989> up

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
I recommend having a couple stacked up

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.140 
I recommend having a couple stacked up
till<00:02:49.620> then<00:02:49.769> you<00:02:50.189> need<00:02:50.340> also<00:02:50.609> collect<00:02:50.909> other

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
till then you need also collect other

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.240 
till then you need also collect other
buckets<00:02:51.629> and<00:02:51.810> keep<00:02:52.019> multiple<00:02:52.530> buckets<00:02:53.129> of

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
buckets and keep multiple buckets of

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.460 
buckets and keep multiple buckets of
milk<00:02:53.519> which<00:02:53.790> you<00:02:53.939> can<00:02:54.150> use<00:02:54.359> to<00:02:54.569> activate<00:02:55.049> this

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
milk which you can use to activate this

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.409 
milk which you can use to activate this
kit<00:02:55.680> as<00:02:55.769> well<00:02:55.799> this<00:02:56.370> is<00:02:56.519> a<00:02:56.609> very<00:02:56.849> good<00:02:57.060> kit<00:02:57.269> and
