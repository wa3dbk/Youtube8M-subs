00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:11.880
 good first criterion for achieving 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:16.320
 playing tennis is able to solve the 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:19.310
 delays that are caused by the ball 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:22.410
 The ball comes fast to live in distant 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:25.470
 then worry at first be like 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:29.789
 stroke technique is to catch the problem 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.679
 on the wrong side that needs the land of 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:36.120
 priority form 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:38.969
 agents simply call a position 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.820
 expectation of a ship position 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:44.010
 We will think only in the legs for 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:54.360
 while how it should be 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:01:09.180
 these legs on the shoulders knees and 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:14.880
 usually crouched on the other the opposition 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:16.520
 fundamentally, those behind the 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:23.479
 ball 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:27.439
 the second situation the dynamic stance 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:27.439
 player is playing 

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:44.040
 this enables one player to 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:46.950
 moment and another will hit this again 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:50.610
 posture is distanced the knees 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:54.420
 I put flexed to slightly 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:57.930
 front if you play the exchange then the 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:02.149
 point when the player will start sawing 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:05.689
 a little more dominating at the discretion 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:05.689
 point value 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:12.250
 the notion of the point soon obliges the player to 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.760
 solve 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:19.410
 precisely the delays that the ball is going to 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.410
 to provoke to the player
