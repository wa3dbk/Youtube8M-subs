00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
perfect for solo q so he has a ton of

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.080 
perfect for solo q so he has a ton of
crowd<00:03:06.500> control<00:03:06.740> with<00:03:07.130> his<00:03:07.250> Q<00:03:07.580> and<00:03:07.730> especially

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
his ultimate but he also does a lot of

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.490 
his ultimate but he also does a lot of
damage<00:03:10.460> while<00:03:10.820> still<00:03:11.120> building<00:03:11.420> tanky<00:03:11.930> I<00:03:12.170> kids

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
damage while still building tanky I kids

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.100 
damage while still building tanky I kids
w<00:03:12.950> and<00:03:13.160> is<00:03:13.250> a<00:03:13.520> have<00:03:13.760> really<00:03:14.180> high<00:03:14.360> base<00:03:14.630> values

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110 
w and is a have really high base values

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:16.690 
w and is a have really high base values
which<00:03:15.320> means<00:03:15.590> that<00:03:15.709> even<00:03:15.950> if<00:03:16.190> you<00:03:16.280> just<00:03:16.310> build

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
which means that even if you just build

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.250 
which means that even if you just build
straight<00:03:17.060> tang<00:03:17.360> you're<00:03:17.600> still<00:03:17.930> going<00:03:18.110> to<00:03:18.170> be

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
straight tang you're still going to be

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.560 
straight tang you're still going to be
doing<00:03:18.410> a<00:03:18.620> huge<00:03:18.920> amount<00:03:19.220> of<00:03:19.340> AOE<00:03:19.640> damage<00:03:19.730> the

doing a huge amount of AOE damage the
other<00:03:20.660> really<00:03:20.870> good<00:03:21.050> thing<00:03:21.260> about<00:03:21.350> him<00:03:21.709> is

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
other really good thing about him is

good at team fighting as well so there's

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:28.750 
good at team fighting as well so there's
pretty<00:03:27.230> much<00:03:27.290> no<00:03:27.739> point<00:03:28.100> in<00:03:28.220> the<00:03:28.340> game<00:03:28.370> when

pretty much no point in the game when
you're<00:03:28.880> going<00:03:29.000> to<00:03:29.090> be<00:03:29.180> useless<00:03:29.540> the<00:03:30.260> way<00:03:30.380> I

wani I guess he has a huge AoE ultimate
he's<00:03:36.770> a<00:03:36.830> lot<00:03:37.100> of<00:03:37.190> innate<00:03:37.430> damage<00:03:37.850> and<00:03:38.120> he<00:03:38.209> also

he's a lot of innate damage and he also

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:40.810 
he's a lot of innate damage and he also
as<00:03:38.570> a<00:03:38.600> stun<00:03:38.900> on<00:03:39.020> his<00:03:39.170> Q<00:03:39.470> as<00:03:39.620> well<00:03:39.860> a<00:03:40.190> movie<00:03:40.610> is

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:40.820 
as a stun on his Q as well a movie is

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:42.520 
as a stun on his Q as well a movie is
definitely<00:03:41.300> underrated<00:03:41.570> he's<00:03:42.019> pretty<00:03:42.380> much

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
definitely underrated he's pretty much

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.259 
definitely underrated he's pretty much
never<00:03:42.769> banned<00:03:43.100> he's<00:03:43.400> hardly<00:03:43.790> played<00:03:44.060> as<00:03:44.239> well

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:44.269 
never banned he's hardly played as well

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:46.120 
never banned he's hardly played as well
but<00:03:44.630> he's<00:03:44.780> a<00:03:44.810> really<00:03:45.230> good<00:03:45.410> pic<00:03:45.590> right<00:03:45.739> now<00:03:45.980> and

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.130 
but he's a really good pic right now and

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:47.830 
but he's a really good pic right now and
I<00:03:46.220> actually<00:03:46.370> recommend<00:03:46.730> you<00:03:47.060> do<00:03:47.269> go<00:03:47.450> and<00:03:47.570> try

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
I actually recommend you do go and try

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.170 
I actually recommend you do go and try
them<00:03:48.050> so<00:03:48.709> if<00:03:48.800> you<00:03:48.890> move<00:03:49.070> on<00:03:49.310> to<00:03:49.459> the<00:03:49.550> ad<00:03:49.700> carries

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
them so if you move on to the ad carries

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:51.820 
them so if you move on to the ad carries
this<00:03:50.330> is<00:03:50.480> where<00:03:50.630> it<00:03:50.720> kind<00:03:50.900> of<00:03:51.019> gets<00:03:51.140> weird<00:03:51.530> okay

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:51.830 
this is where it kind of gets weird okay

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:54.009 
this is where it kind of gets weird okay
because<00:03:52.130> no<00:03:52.400> one<00:03:52.580> really<00:03:52.610> bands<00:03:53.150> ad<00:03:53.480> carries

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:54.019

think that if you pay a right you can

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.320 
think that if you pay a right you can
play<00:04:55.800> it<00:04:55.830> as<00:04:56.130> a<00:04:56.160> lame<00:04:56.460> bully<00:04:56.790> you<00:04:56.940> push<00:04:57.180> your

play it as a lame bully you push your
laning<00:04:57.720> constantly<00:04:58.230> and<00:04:58.380> then<00:04:58.470> poke<00:04:58.740> with

00:04:58.910 --> 00:04:58.920 
laning constantly and then poke with

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:00.710 
laning constantly and then poke with
your<00:04:59.070> key<00:04:59.280> once<00:04:59.550> all<00:04:59.790> the<00:04:59.910> minions<00:05:00.210> are<00:05:00.510> dead

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 
your key once all the minions are dead

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.120 
your key once all the minions are dead
and<00:05:00.960> you<00:05:01.110> can<00:05:01.230> actually<00:05:01.350> have<00:05:01.590> a<00:05:01.620> really<00:05:01.980> good

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:03.890 
and you can actually have a really good
lane<00:05:02.370> phase<00:05:02.640> which<00:05:02.880> turns<00:05:03.180> into<00:05:03.330> an<00:05:03.570> even

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900

alive and making them kill everyone
instead<00:05:33.150> a<00:05:33.510> chances<00:05:34.140> are<00:05:34.320> the<00:05:34.530> biggest

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:34.740 
instead a chances are the biggest

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.370 
instead a chances are the biggest
weakness<00:05:35.250> of<00:05:35.430> most<00:05:35.700> lower<00:05:35.970> lotd<00:05:36.570> carries<00:05:37.140> are

weakness of most lower lotd carries are

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:39.230 
weakness of most lower lotd carries are
the<00:05:37.620> composition<00:05:38.400> property<00:05:38.790> and<00:05:38.940> they<00:05:39.030> keep

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:39.240 
the composition property and they keep

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.240 
the composition property and they keep
getting<00:05:39.420> caught<00:05:39.870> and<00:05:40.170> basically<00:05:40.620> as<00:05:40.890> Johnny

getting caught and basically as Johnny

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:42.860

you<00:05:41.490> make<00:05:41.700> up<00:05:41.880> for<00:05:42.060> that<00:05:42.150> weakness<00:05:42.450> you

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:42.870 
you make up for that weakness you

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:45.050 
you make up for that weakness you
protect<00:05:43.260> them<00:05:43.440> and<00:05:43.680> you<00:05:43.800> keep<00:05:43.980> them<00:05:44.190> alive<00:05:44.310> if

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:45.060 
protect them and you keep them alive if

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:46.700 
protect them and you keep them alive if
you<00:05:45.240> want<00:05:45.420> something<00:05:45.480> more<00:05:45.840> aggressive<00:05:46.260> that
