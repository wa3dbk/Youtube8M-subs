00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
board thank you I'm trying to be a

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.130 
board thank you I'm trying to be a
little<00:00:43.860> bit<00:00:44.010> more<00:00:44.129> aggressive<00:00:44.670> I<00:00:45.360> did<00:00:45.960> have<00:00:46.079> a

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
little bit more aggressive I did have a

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.799 
little bit more aggressive I did have a
red<00:00:46.320> dot<00:00:46.559> on<00:00:46.680> this<00:00:46.800> gun<00:00:47.039> but<00:00:47.370> I<00:00:47.730> realize<00:00:48.600> at<00:00:48.719> the

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
red dot on this gun but I realize at the

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.270 
red dot on this gun but I realize at the
ESPY<00:00:49.200> of<00:00:49.289> science<00:00:49.649> it<00:00:49.739> would<00:00:49.829> definitely<00:00:49.980> work

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
ESPY of science it would definitely work

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.360 
ESPY of science it would definitely work
better<00:00:50.520> for<00:00:50.700> that<00:00:50.850> so<00:00:51.920> I'm<00:00:52.920> try<00:00:53.129> and<00:00:53.219> sneak

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370
