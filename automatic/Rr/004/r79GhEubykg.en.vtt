 beautiful welcome to the channel the day of 

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:07.209
 Today I bring you this makeup that is 

00:00:04.359 --> 00:00:09.100
 very feminine pink tones for an exit 

00:00:07.209 --> 00:00:11.920
 with the friends with the husband with the 

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:13.480
 boyfriend to drive very very good and 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.760
 Well, after the absence of 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:18.100
 one week I went on vacation and already 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.660
 they know typical return no more tired of 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.539
 what went away but thank god 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:24.160
 we are back sharing this 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:26.110
 makeup that I hope it's your 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.150
 I like it so if you want to recreate it in 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:30.850
 you please join me in this 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.619
 tutorial I will start by applying a 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:35.350
 prebase of shadows I'm occupying the 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:37.120
 of multiple cosmetics that is my 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.579
 favorite but instead if not the 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.440
 have they can occupy one more corrector 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:42.999
 Clarito skin tone apply it with 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.390
 fingers and seal it with dust 

00:00:42.999 --> 00:00:45.390
 translucent 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.250
 then I will occupy this new palette 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.130
 of the to face brand that is the semi sweet 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.250
 chocolate ballet bar and I will use 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:58.800
 the shadow coconut cream to illuminate the 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.840
 Eyebrow bone for my taste this 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.300
 palette is much better than the first 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.729
 It has more pigmentation and more colors 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.250
 It has the color black and blue after 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.860
 I'm going to use the shadow pinet water 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.450
 to blur the in the crease of the eye 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.759
 as my transition color but it's going to 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.259
 be the only one that I'll occupy there like that 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:19.880
 that it does not matter, you just have to 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.880
 blur it perfectly 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.610
 then I'm going to occupy this shadow that is 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:27.350
 lazio game that is a half-matte coffee and 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.810
 I will use it only to not 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.750
 lose the dimension in the eyelid and 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:35.000
 external part of the upper eyelid and 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.430
 I will also use it to blur it 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.200
 in the inner socket of the eye I am 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.780
 using because my eyes are somewhat 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.000
 separated and I like to put them together but if 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.250
 you have them together rather 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.750
 skip this step after I go to 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:51.670
 use this brand pigment 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:56.270
 English which is 86 is a reddish pink 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:57.920
 with many brightness that is tornasol 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.740
 because also when it gives light as 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.380
 that has golden brown tones 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.759
 It's very beautiful I'm compacted in 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.520
 the mobile eyelid with the brush 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:11.360
 moistened afterwards also with a brush 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:13.370
 moistened but spiky as you can see 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.459
 these taking this new pigment from the 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:19.850
 mark humanity hong and that of the 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:21.830
 Mark forgiveness is worth it and I'm using it to 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.560
 illuminate the lacrimal 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:27.230
 and integrate this tonality to the eyelid 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.060
 mobile like upper lashes I'm 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.090
 applying the norms king of house or 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:35.570
 flashes and I'm using your glue 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:38.450
 own brand that you already know is super 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:40.400
 super super great because it does not fall 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.010
 it lasts all night and only with 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.960
 two medium ones can be removed 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:47.810
 then I want to present this pencil 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:51.200
 online of the tar cosmetics brand that 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:53.360
 it is in black it is against water and 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.980
 truth is super intense as they can 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.170
 see and I'll use it to delineate 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:00.700
 the lower lashes 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:03.140
 and long and lengthen the wing out 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.959
 then I will use the same shadow 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:09.200
 red to blur the below 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:11.450
 this delineated and in the mask of 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.490
 eyelashes I am occupying the see in dance 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:16.870
 also from your face at the top 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:20.510
 and lower apply false eyelashes 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:22.820
 down are the suites of house of glass 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.069
 jazz and that is the result for the 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:26.469
 eyes 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:28.870
 in this shot I'm not using copy glasses 

00:03:26.469 --> 00:03:30.879
 it is with the eyes towards the natural as 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:34.299
 can see they look very parents these 

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:37.540
 tonalities with our brown eyes and 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:39.249
 you can stop the rest the rest of the 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.739

 with a fan brush and I'm 

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:55.329
 applying at discretion 

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:56.799
 in several passes so that it takes a lot 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:59.829
 intensity and as you can see in the 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:01.510
 photos if it shows much later I'm 

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:04.870
