00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:03.959 
my guys in the previous episode I

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:09.110 
my guys in the previous episode I
assembled<00:00:04.589> this<00:00:04.770> little<00:00:05.960> Meccano<00:00:06.960> clone<00:00:08.120> toy

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
assembled this little Meccano clone toy

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.200 
assembled this little Meccano clone toy
car<00:00:09.599> I<00:00:09.929> said<00:00:10.800> I'll<00:00:10.889> to<00:00:11.040> see<00:00:11.160> if<00:00:11.219> I<00:00:11.309> could<00:00:11.460> put<00:00:12.150> an

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
car I said I'll to see if I could put an

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:19.599 
car I said I'll to see if I could put an
electric<00:00:12.660> motor<00:00:12.870> on<00:00:13.080> it<00:00:16.789> there<00:00:17.789> we<00:00:17.940> are

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:19.609 
electric motor on it there we are

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:35.150 
electric motor on it there we are
electric<00:00:20.609> motor<00:00:22.310> battery<00:00:33.710> better<00:00:34.710> just<00:00:34.980> go

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
electric motor battery better just go

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.380 
electric motor battery better just go
through<00:00:35.430> what<00:00:35.579> I<00:00:35.610> had<00:00:35.820> to<00:00:35.940> do<00:00:38.149> obviously<00:00:39.149> I

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
through what I had to do obviously I

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.920 
through what I had to do obviously I
fitted<00:00:39.660> in<00:00:39.840> an<00:00:39.899> electric<00:00:40.290> motor<00:00:41.629> that's<00:00:42.629> just

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
fitted in an electric motor that's just

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:49.990 
fitted in an electric motor that's just
hot<00:00:43.379> glued<00:00:45.020> to<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.140> chassis<00:00:46.379> I<00:00:48.320> got<00:00:49.320> a<00:00:49.350> pack<00:00:49.739> of

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.000 
hot glued to the chassis I got a pack of

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.540 
hot glued to the chassis I got a pack of
miscellaneous<00:00:51.000> gear<00:00:51.690> wheels<00:00:52.199> so<00:00:53.190> a<00:00:53.219> little

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
miscellaneous gear wheels so a little

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.420 
miscellaneous gear wheels so a little
sort<00:00:53.850> through<00:00:54.120> there<00:00:54.649> to<00:00:55.649> find<00:00:55.949> what<00:00:56.129> I<00:00:56.160> could

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
sort through there to find what I could

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.920 
sort through there to find what I could
use<00:00:57.890> that<00:00:58.890> one's<00:00:59.100> called<00:00:59.309> a<00:00:59.489> crown<00:00:59.940> gear<00:01:00.660> wheel

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
use that one's called a crown gear wheel

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.820 
use that one's called a crown gear wheel
cuz<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.500> teeth<00:01:02.100> stick<00:01:02.460> out<00:01:02.609> sideways<00:01:03.710> so<00:01:04.710> if

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
cuz the teeth stick out sideways so if

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.660 
cuz the teeth stick out sideways so if
you're<00:01:04.979> not<00:01:05.159> familiar<00:01:05.400> with<00:01:07.400> gear<00:01:08.400> wheels

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
you're not familiar with gear wheels

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:15.679 
you're not familiar with gear wheels
that's<00:01:09.510> what<00:01:09.689> it<00:01:09.780> is<00:01:09.990> I<00:01:12.890> had<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:14.130> bend<00:01:14.850> the

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
that's what it is I had to bend the

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.950 
that's what it is I had to bend the
metal<00:01:15.720> plates<00:01:16.320> quite<00:01:16.830> significantly<00:01:17.810> to<00:01:18.810> give

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
metal plates quite significantly to give

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.719 
metal plates quite significantly to give
us<00:01:19.049> enough<00:01:19.290> space<00:01:19.650> to<00:01:19.680> get<00:01:20.009> that<00:01:20.189> gear<00:01:20.460> wheel

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
us enough space to get that gear wheel

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.490 
us enough space to get that gear wheel
in<00:01:22.820> the<00:01:23.820> original<00:01:24.240> wheels<00:01:24.450> were<00:01:24.689> just<00:01:24.930> screwed

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
in the original wheels were just screwed

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.399 
in the original wheels were just screwed
onto<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.310> ends<00:01:26.580> of<00:01:26.670> these<00:01:26.790> metal<00:01:27.270> plates<00:01:29.240> I've

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
onto the ends of these metal plates I've

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:33.670 
onto the ends of these metal plates I've
got<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:31.439> bicycle<00:01:31.950> spoke<00:01:32.220> for<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.759> axle<00:01:32.790> there

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 
got a bicycle spoke for the axle there

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.219 
got a bicycle spoke for the axle there
so<00:01:34.680> that's<00:01:34.860> going<00:01:35.100> straight<00:01:35.340> through<00:01:36.229> we've

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
so that's going straight through we've

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.679 
so that's going straight through we've
padded<00:01:37.650> out<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:38.070> actual<00:01:38.430> holes<00:01:39.000> there<00:01:39.450> with

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
padded out the actual holes there with

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.660 
padded out the actual holes there with
little<00:01:39.960> plastic<00:01:40.409> tubes<00:01:40.829> so<00:01:41.250> that<00:01:41.280> we've<00:01:41.520> got<00:01:41.640> a

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
little plastic tubes so that we've got a

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:48.319 
little plastic tubes so that we've got a
nice<00:01:45.229> fixed<00:01:46.229> mounting<00:01:46.740> main<00:01:47.460> fixed<00:01:47.939> mounting

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
nice fixed mounting main fixed mounting

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.020 
nice fixed mounting main fixed mounting
so<00:01:49.290> we<00:01:49.380> don't<00:01:49.560> slop<00:01:49.860> around<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.399> front<00:01:50.640> ones<00:01:50.880> I

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
so we don't slop around the front ones I

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.700 
so we don't slop around the front ones I
haven't<00:01:51.329> put<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.570> plastic<00:01:51.990> tubes<00:01:52.259> in<00:01:52.500> and<00:01:52.649> you

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
haven't put the plastic tubes in and you

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.789 
haven't put the plastic tubes in and you
can<00:01:52.829> see<00:01:53.009> they<00:01:53.189> slop<00:01:53.700> around<00:01:53.729> quite<00:01:54.270> a<00:01:54.299> lot

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:54.799 
can see they slop around quite a lot

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:58.850 
can see they slop around quite a lot
still<00:01:55.799> had<00:01:55.950> to<00:01:57.110> bend<00:01:58.110> it<00:01:58.350> to<00:01:58.469> give<00:01:58.619> us<00:01:58.710> the

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
still had to bend it to give us the

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:05.790 
still had to bend it to give us the
clearance<00:01:59.159> and<00:02:00.000> that's<00:02:00.329> also<00:02:00.509> to<00:02:00.750> align<00:02:01.439> them

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:05.800 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.580 

but<00:02:06.800> that's<00:02:07.550> it<00:02:07.730> really<00:02:07.970> I<00:02:08.420> couldn't<00:02:09.290> see<00:02:09.440> much

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
but that's it really I couldn't see much

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.470 
but that's it really I couldn't see much
point<00:02:09.830> in<00:02:09.950> actually<00:02:10.280> videoing<00:02:10.820> myself<00:02:11.180> doing

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
point in actually videoing myself doing

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.210 
point in actually videoing myself doing
it<00:02:11.750> because<00:02:11.960> it's<00:02:12.140> a<00:02:12.230> bit<00:02:12.380> fiddly<00:02:12.680> in<00:02:12.890> me<00:02:13.010> hands

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
it because it's a bit fiddly in me hands

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:14.770 
it because it's a bit fiddly in me hands
just<00:02:13.550> get<00:02:13.700> in<00:02:13.790> the<00:02:13.940> way<00:02:14.060> so<00:02:14.120> I<00:02:14.450> thought<00:02:14.630> I'd

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
just get in the way so I thought I'd

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.600 
just get in the way so I thought I'd
just<00:02:14.930> show<00:02:15.200> you<00:02:15.260> when<00:02:15.800> it<00:02:15.890> was<00:02:15.980> finished<00:02:16.190> oh

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
just show you when it was finished oh

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.190 
just show you when it was finished oh
and<00:02:19.610> the<00:02:19.700> battery<00:02:20.180> that's<00:02:20.570> just<00:02:20.840> one<00:02:20.990> of<00:02:21.020> my

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
and the battery that's just one of my

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.790 
and the battery that's just one of my
rechargeable<00:02:22.010> batteries<00:02:23.140> the<00:02:24.140> wires<00:02:24.380> that<00:02:24.740> go

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
rechargeable batteries the wires that go

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.600 
rechargeable batteries the wires that go
to<00:02:25.070> the<00:02:25.400> motor<00:02:26.350> I've<00:02:27.350> got<00:02:27.530> little<00:02:27.710> neodymium

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
to the motor I've got little neodymium

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.080 
to the motor I've got little neodymium
magnets<00:02:29.110> on<00:02:30.110> the<00:02:30.350> end<00:02:30.670> so<00:02:31.670> I<00:02:31.700> said<00:02:31.880> if<00:02:32.000> I'm

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
magnets on the end so I said if I'm

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:37.200 
magnets on the end so I said if I'm
gonna<00:02:32.240> on-off<00:02:32.570> switch<00:02:33.730> just<00:02:34.840> allow<00:02:35.840> them<00:02:36.110> to

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.210 
gonna on-off switch just allow them to

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:41.340 
gonna on-off switch just allow them to
clip<00:02:38.210> onto<00:02:38.420> the<00:02:38.780> terminals<00:02:39.560> on<00:02:39.680> the<00:02:39.710> battery

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
clip onto the terminals on the battery

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.260 
clip onto the terminals on the battery
not<00:02:42.350> all<00:02:42.710> batteries<00:02:43.340> have<00:02:43.640> got<00:02:43.850> the<00:02:44.150> right

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.270 
not all batteries have got the right

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:47.950 
not all batteries have got the right
sort<00:02:44.540> of<00:02:44.690> metal<00:02:45.020> there<00:02:45.370> for<00:02:46.370> magnets<00:02:46.910> to<00:02:47.510> clip

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:47.960 
sort of metal there for magnets to clip

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.010 
sort of metal there for magnets to clip
onto<00:02:48.550> but<00:02:49.550> these<00:02:49.700> particular<00:02:49.850> ones<00:02:50.450> have<00:02:50.750> got

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.020 
onto but these particular ones have got

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:55.570 
onto but these particular ones have got
some<00:02:51.950> sort<00:02:52.190> of<00:02:52.220> ferrous<00:02:53.320> terminals<00:02:54.370> so<00:02:55.370> the

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
some sort of ferrous terminals so the

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:15.740 
some sort of ferrous terminals so the
neodymium<00:02:55.970> magnets<00:02:56.690> fit<00:02:56.900> on<00:02:57.020> easily

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:26.420 

works<00:03:16.750> absolutely<00:03:17.110> fine

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.269
