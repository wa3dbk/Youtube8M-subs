00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
wheels is the fact that they're center

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.389 
wheels is the fact that they're center
set<00:00:36.780> each<00:00:37.230> side<00:00:37.559> looks<00:00:37.860> exactly<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.340> same

but once you start to cone on this side

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.549 
but once you start to cone on this side
you<00:00:44.940> can<00:00:45.329> just<00:00:45.629> around<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:46.230> start<00:00:46.469> to

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
progression from the wheel I had before

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.950 
progression from the wheel I had before
um<00:01:49.470> using<00:01:50.470> this<00:01:50.850> after<00:01:51.850> that<00:01:52.030> wheel<00:01:52.240> you<00:01:52.810> can

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:56.410 
totally feel the quality change and

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:00.000 
totally feel the quality change and
these<00:01:57.250> are<00:01:57.400> a<00:01:57.430> super<00:01:57.850> buttery<00:01:58.710> slide<00:01:59.710> really

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.010

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
really well especially when you have

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.490 
really well especially when you have
bearing<00:02:04.750> spacers<00:02:05.290> that<00:02:05.530> go<00:02:05.980> right<00:02:06.310> in<00:02:06.550> between

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
bearing spacers that go right in between

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.260 
bearing spacers that go right in between
the<00:02:08.500> two<00:02:08.679> bearings<00:02:09.130> that<00:02:09.550> way<00:02:09.729> you<00:02:09.790> can<00:02:09.970> take

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
the two bearings that way you can take

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.450 
the two bearings that way you can take
on<00:02:10.509> your<00:02:11.310> nut<00:02:12.310> all<00:02:12.520> the<00:02:12.820> way<00:02:12.940> and<00:02:13.540> that

on your nut all the way and that

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.550 
on your nut all the way and that
provides<00:02:15.460> a<00:02:15.670> really<00:02:15.910> nice<00:02:16.090> buttery<00:02:16.720> it's<00:02:17.410> not

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
it back the other way uh and once i do

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.080 
it back the other way uh and once i do
that<00:02:41.260> will<00:02:41.620> be<00:02:41.650> even<00:02:41.890> again<00:02:42.310> and<00:02:42.610> they'll<00:02:42.970> be

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
that will be even again and they'll be

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:44.580 
that will be even again and they'll be
like<00:02:43.120> new<00:02:43.480> just<00:02:43.989> a<00:02:44.050> little<00:02:44.170> bit<00:02:44.350> smaller

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
like new just a little bit smaller

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.210 
like new just a little bit smaller
that's<00:02:45.280> basically<00:02:45.940> it<00:02:46.300> the<00:02:47.140> only<00:02:47.470> downside<00:02:47.769> to

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
that's basically it the only downside to

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.220 
that's basically it the only downside to
these<00:02:48.340> wheels<00:02:48.640> is<00:02:48.940> the<00:02:49.360> fact<00:02:49.660> that<00:02:49.900> they're<00:02:50.200> a

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
these wheels is the fact that they're a

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:51.690 
these wheels is the fact that they're a
little<00:02:50.410> bit<00:02:50.620> icy<00:02:51.010> and<00:02:51.190> they<00:02:51.250> can<00:02:51.400> slide<00:02:51.670> out

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
little bit icy and they can slide out

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.970 
little bit icy and they can slide out
when<00:02:52.030> you<00:02:52.120> don't<00:02:52.300> want<00:02:52.390> them<00:02:52.540> to<00:02:52.720> but<00:02:52.930> I<00:02:53.140> mean

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980
