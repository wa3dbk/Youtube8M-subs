00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:14.180 
pop out of it no there's still a little

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:17.740 
pop out of it no there's still a little
bit<00:06:15.099> when<00:06:16.099> you<00:06:16.250> tap<00:06:16.550> it<00:06:16.759> into<00:06:16.970> the<00:06:17.180> container

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:17.750 
bit when you tap it into the container

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:22.120 
bit when you tap it into the container
obviously<00:06:18.620> some<00:06:18.889> of<00:06:19.340> the<00:06:19.789> mixture<00:06:20.979> some<00:06:21.979> of

obviously some of the mixture some of
the<00:06:22.220> mixture<00:06:22.580> comes<00:06:23.150> out<00:06:23.419> of<00:06:23.660> the<00:06:24.610> bottle<00:06:25.610> into

the mixture comes out of the bottle into
the<00:06:26.449> base<00:06:26.720> so<00:06:27.110> you<00:06:27.169> just<00:06:27.320> scoop<00:06:27.979> it<00:06:28.160> back<00:06:28.220> wall

00:06:28.629 --> 00:06:28.639 
the base so you just scoop it back wall

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:33.249 
the base so you just scoop it back wall
and<00:06:28.849> pop<00:06:29.240> it<00:06:29.270> back<00:06:29.479> in<00:06:29.960> and<00:06:31.660> then<00:06:32.660> public
