00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.110
 an explorer said they are not the 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.110
 people be extraordinary 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:22.210
 but their works I could finally 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.840
 leave the mark 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.840
 will start to respect 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.619
 published last year on pc 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:32.119
 playstation 3 and xbox 360 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:34.040
 tomb raider represented a 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.629
 attempt by square enix of 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.730
 relaunch the character of lara croft 

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:38.660
 and rejuvenate one of the most popular series 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.430
 ever 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.199
 the last adventure of the beauty 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.970
 archaeologist has been revived on 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:46.070
 console next gen with tomb raider 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:48.110
 defining edition and for the occasion 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.059
 we decided to play the title on 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.710
 different platforms to understand which ones 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:53.330
 are actually the steps taken in 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.610
 ahead of the original game 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:57.769
 many of the heavy graphic innovations in 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.510
 Defined tomb raiders see shows are not 

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:00.979
 the same ones already seen in the pc version 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.409
 of the original game 

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:05.239
 starting obviously from the ciex fex la 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:07.610
 technology that manages to the hair of 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:10.010
 lara to make the behavior of the 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.930
 much more realistic hair every single one 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.280
 hair reacts independently 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.590
 to the physics of the game 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.720
 moving in a credible way according to 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.030
 wind or the player's movements 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.830
 as you can see, some are not missing 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.600
 uncertainty and some problems with 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.350
 interpenetration but improvement is 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.689
 evident 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.729
 with the final of shaun of tomb 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:31.399
 raider huge attentions have been 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:32.869
 looking at the appearance of lara the model 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:35.090
 facial was completely 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:37.520
 redesigned and made even more realistic 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.289
 the face mash can now count on one 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.359
 higher density on a large number of 

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:42.920
 extra polygons is even if someone 

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:44.210
 may prefer the old lara 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.999
 this next gen version 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:49.070
 it is definitely more expressive as in the 

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:51.649
 pc version la body tells about 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:54.619
 Higher resolution texture rendering 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:56.420
 more obvious details and wounds in this 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:58.600
 shaun developers definitive 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.979
 however, they have made extensive use of subsurface 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.259
 catering a technique thanks to which 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:05.240
 the light passes through the skin of the 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:07.130
 protagonist and spreads under the 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.679
 surface in a more pleasant way 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.240
 another gem is represented by 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.520
 new web maps 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.860
 an effect that slides or dries in 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.840
 credible way rain and blood mud 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.580
 on lara skin than on 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.740
 when the protagonist is tired or 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.000
 under stress 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:25.370
 close the discussion on the model of 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.680
 lara talking about his equipment a 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.930
 unlike the original version 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.850
 this time, pistol, pic, bow and arrows 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.800
 they are all subject to physics 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.410
 they sway as the player runs 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.630
 or the restyling work is climbed 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.180
 he was not limited to the protagonist but 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.490
 to the whole island of yamatai la 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.070
 vegetation is richer and less static 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:47.840
 moves as the characters pass o 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:50.390
 to the action of the wind now 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.940
 completely dynamic the flames of 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.890
 torch fires are more alive and lit. 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.690
 compared to before and massive use 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.480
 of particle and much more evident 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.950
 in the sequence of the burned village 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.830
 similar speech for the management of 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:06.020
 fog that on playstation 3 xbox 360 was 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:09.170
 only simulated while on consoles 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:11.150
 next gen and particle rare rope 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.530
 stop to admire the landscape 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.420
 also because the developers have 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.940
 worked even more on the depth 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.890
 field objects closer to the 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.960
 camera tend to blur while the 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.970
 visual distance is increased compared to 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.890
 Original tomb raider showing many 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.550
 details that were previously hidden 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:28.340
 from the fog 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:31.040
 xbox one and playstation 4 versions 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:33.020
 they run at a resolution of 1080p 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.490
 native and do not present large 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:36.590
 differences in that and effects 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:39.260
 placing itself well or badly on it 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:41.240
 visual level same thing cannot be done 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.370
 say instead for the network brakes that if up 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:44.360
 xbox one is locked at 30 frames per 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.240
 second 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.890
 on the sony console and at 60 the two 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:51.350
 versions were edited by two 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:53.450
 several groups that xbox was 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:55.430
 entrusted to united front games 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.380
 the team behind sleeping dogs while 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.940
 that playstation years csis 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:01.070
 the developer already involved last 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.240
 year on with pc and playstation versions 

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:05.630
 3 of tomb raiders 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:08.360
 it should however be said one thing about playstation 4 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:10.550
 laden and had disce maintains a frame 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.950
 line clearly superior to the xbox line 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:14.780
 one but at the same time it is even more 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:17.030
 unstable falling more or less 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:19.480
 evident in richer sequences and 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:19.480
 graphically 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:22.239
 now caught in a trap 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:26.949
 the sound
