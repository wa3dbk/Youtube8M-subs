00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.090
 very good of all today we are going to see how 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:13.869
 make a kind of optical inferno with 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:15.789
 a letter that is called the hyper letter the 

00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:18.390
 hyper letter this one is made of this 

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:21.520
 way in this curious way 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.160
 it's a kind of optical illusion 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.810
 or whatever you want to call or at least a 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.230
 very curious object to see especially 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.230
 this 

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:33.840
 until I have my hand is now made 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:36.710
 with a double back letter 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.239
 and this is made with a normal letter 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.800
 and we see that it has a form 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:41.449
 quite quite peculiar and quite 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.800
 impossible good to make it unique 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:48.490
 what we will need is to take a letter 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:51.130
 anyone for example is not worth it 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:52.330
 and we will need a pair of scissors is very 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.100
 simple what we have to do what 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:56.830
 we have to do only three 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.130
 cuts and llos the first cut in the 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:02.329
 right part more or less in this area 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:04.769
 and we'll cut halfway 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:07.000
 more or less 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.180
 up to here it's worth 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.400
 and the second cut we will do more or 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.700
 less at the same distance but the part 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.280
 left 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.220
 now 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.600
 and also up to half of 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.850
 this way we are left like this in both 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.460
 cuts and the third cut we will do in 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:27.330
 this part of here right in the middle 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.330
 Up to the middle 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:34.180
 so for me 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:36.750
 so now what we have to do 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:41.590
 it's on the right side we rotate it 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:45.070
 so we try to align the 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:48.300
 side this side with this 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:50.880
 and we make a fold here 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:54.479
 and we do 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.729
 a fold here like this already 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.409
 we will have completed the hyper letter we see 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.619
 how it was it is important that 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.000
 aligned to the barÃ§a as flat to the ground 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.950
 that is to say that no 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.020
 side to make the effect 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.119
 of continuity of the side that's what 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.400
 that produces the impossibility effect 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.530
 because automatically the view is created 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.470
 which is like the same letter 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.450
 and then it 's the beauty of this illusion 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.990
 optics that looks like it was an object 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.990
 very impossible 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:26.530
 it is something that you can put of object 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.780
 decorative in any in your 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.939
 where you want or especially 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.519
 I tell you the double back is very very 

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:35.040
 cool this is something that they published in the 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:37.930
 vice page and that a while ago and 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.609
 that he had always wanted to do 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.889
 a kind of tutorial in Spanish for 

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:43.599
 that at least you have it because it's a 

00:02:41.889 --> 00:02:46.000
 Nice object, and it's very easy to do 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:47.799
 and very fast as you have seen so 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.010
 Well I hope you liked it and even 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:50.010
 the next
