fantastic so we're watching them they're
active<00:00:46.469> mostly<00:00:47.340> when<00:00:47.789> are<00:00:48.030> they<00:00:48.149> active

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
active mostly when are they active

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.090 
active mostly when are they active
during<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.780> day<00:00:48.840> active<00:00:49.500> at<00:00:49.590> night<00:00:49.620> active

during the day active at night active

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.889 
during the day active at night active
throughout<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.460> day<00:00:50.640> well<00:00:51.270> initially<00:00:51.600> they

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
throughout the day well initially they

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.360 
throughout the day well initially they
were<00:00:51.960> primarily<00:00:52.410> active<00:00:52.680> at<00:00:52.890> night<00:00:52.949> and

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
were primarily active at night and

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.430 
were primarily active at night and
that's<00:00:53.640> why<00:00:53.879> we<00:00:54.090> engaged<00:00:54.930> this<00:00:55.199> in<00:00:55.350> the

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
that's why we engaged this in the

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.260 
that's why we engaged this in the
process<00:00:55.829> this<00:00:55.949> is<00:00:56.129> a<00:00:56.160> camera<00:00:56.579> trap<00:00:56.789> and<00:00:57.090> what

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
process this is a camera trap and what

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.360 
process this is a camera trap and what
it<00:00:57.420> does<00:00:57.629> is<00:00:57.989> if<00:00:58.350> there<00:00:58.530> was<00:00:58.649> motion<00:00:59.070> from<00:00:59.280> the

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
it does is if there was motion from the

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.130 
it does is if there was motion from the
camera<00:00:59.789> it<00:00:59.969> will<00:01:00.149> take<00:01:00.390> images<00:01:00.570> this

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
camera it will take images this

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.049 
camera it will take images this
particular<00:01:01.500> camera<00:01:01.949> trap<00:01:02.160> will<00:01:02.550> take<00:01:02.730> video

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
particular camera trap will take video

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.390 
particular camera trap will take video
we<00:01:03.930> saw<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.229> babies<00:01:04.589> were<00:01:04.769> growing<00:01:05.040> we<00:01:05.189> saw

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
we saw the babies were growing we saw

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.090 
we saw the babies were growing we saw
how<00:01:05.820> active<00:01:06.390> they<00:01:06.600> were<00:01:06.659> in<00:01:07.049> their<00:01:07.380> den<00:01:07.560> box<00:01:07.799> so

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
how active they were in their den box so

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.530 
how active they were in their den box so
we<00:01:08.250> thought<00:01:08.400> they<00:01:08.610> had<00:01:08.850> to<00:01:08.970> be<00:01:09.060> getting<00:01:09.180> out<00:01:09.390> at

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
we thought they had to be getting out at

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:10.789 
we thought they had to be getting out at
some<00:01:09.689> point<00:01:09.930> but<00:01:10.020> we<00:01:10.080> weren't<00:01:10.439> seeing<00:01:10.619> them

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
some point but we weren't seeing them

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.190 
some point but we weren't seeing them
during<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.130> day<00:01:11.310> when<00:01:12.150> we<00:01:12.330> put<00:01:12.659> this<00:01:12.810> in<00:01:13.020> some

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
during the day when we put this in some

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.870 
during the day when we put this in some
of<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.380> images<00:01:13.710> we<00:01:13.890> got<00:01:14.040> really<00:01:14.310> surprised<00:01:14.670> us

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
of the images we got really surprised us

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.490 
of the images we got really surprised us

we saw that these babies were up and

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.080 
we saw that these babies were up and
down<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.770> trees<00:01:17.040> and<00:01:17.490> running<00:01:17.850> in<00:01:17.939> circles

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
down the trees and running in circles

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.149 
down the trees and running in circles
around<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.659> yard<00:01:18.900> playing<00:01:19.290> with<00:01:19.500> so<00:01:19.920> how<00:01:20.040> does

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
around the yard playing with so how does

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.710 
around the yard playing with so how does
it<00:01:20.310> work<00:01:20.430> then<00:01:20.580> it's<00:01:20.880> gonna<00:01:21.000> take<00:01:21.270> it<00:01:21.390> through

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
it work then it's gonna take it through

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.600 
it work then it's gonna take it through
motion<00:01:22.170> it<00:01:22.619> will<00:01:22.770> take<00:01:22.950> it<00:01:23.070> through<00:01:23.250> motion

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
motion it will take it through motion

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.340 
motion it will take it through motion
there<00:01:23.880> are<00:01:24.030> camera<00:01:24.420> traps<00:01:24.659> that<00:01:24.900> work<00:01:25.110> with

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
there are camera traps that work with

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.320 
there are camera traps that work with
body<00:01:25.590> temperature<00:01:26.070> okay<00:01:26.369> to<00:01:26.640> make<00:01:26.850> sure<00:01:27.060> that

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
body temperature okay to make sure that

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.030 
body temperature okay to make sure that
