00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.400 
at all now what's interesting is that
you<00:03:01.030> actually<00:03:01.360> control<00:03:01.540> the<00:03:01.810> pace<00:03:01.989> of<00:03:02.170> the<00:03:02.230> car

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
you actually control the pace of the car

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.140 
you actually control the pace of the car
by<00:03:02.590> the<00:03:02.620> cruise<00:03:02.980> control<00:03:03.010> rather<00:03:03.940> than

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
by the cruise control rather than

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:05.729 
by the cruise control rather than
touching<00:03:04.360> the<00:03:04.570> gas<00:03:04.690> or<00:03:04.959> the<00:03:04.989> brake<00:03:05.230> and<00:03:05.410> doing

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
touching the gas or the brake and doing

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:06.990 
touching the gas or the brake and doing
something<00:03:05.980> that<00:03:06.040> could<00:03:06.190> upset<00:03:06.280> the<00:03:06.610> car<00:03:06.820> the

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
something that could upset the car the

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.760 
something that could upset the car the
car<00:03:07.209> just<00:03:07.390> interprets<00:03:08.050> that<00:03:08.200> control<00:03:08.560> is

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:08.770 
car just interprets that control is

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:10.260 
car just interprets that control is
saying<00:03:08.980> all<00:03:09.370> we<00:03:09.520> do<00:03:09.640> want<00:03:09.820> to<00:03:09.880> go<00:03:09.940> a<00:03:09.970> little<00:03:10.120> bit

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:10.270 
saying all we do want to go a little bit

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:12.390 
saying all we do want to go a little bit
faster<00:03:10.660> we<00:03:11.230> can<00:03:11.320> do<00:03:11.440> that<00:03:11.620> in<00:03:11.800> a<00:03:11.890> safe<00:03:12.100> and

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
faster we can do that in a safe and

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.190 
faster we can do that in a safe and

this one can it's not a regular SUV Ford
as<00:04:19.220> it<00:04:19.340> pains<00:04:19.610> to<00:04:19.880> point<00:04:20.060> out<00:04:20.299> this<00:04:20.900> is<00:04:20.959> a<00:04:21.110> model

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
as it pains to point out this is a model

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.040 
as it pains to point out this is a model
that<00:04:21.470> is<00:04:21.620> capable<00:04:21.950> of<00:04:22.310> far<00:04:22.700> more<00:04:22.730> than<00:04:23.180> what

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
that is capable of far more than what

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.110 
that is capable of far more than what
your<00:04:24.230> regular<00:04:25.100> family<00:04:25.430> car<00:04:25.640> can<00:04:25.820> do<00:04:25.940> and

your regular family car can do and

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.300 
your regular family car can do and
that's<00:04:26.360> that's<00:04:26.960> a<00:04:27.140> good<00:04:27.320> thing<00:04:27.500> because<00:04:27.590> a<00:04:27.890> lot

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310
