00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:18.490 
that they didn't think it was a good

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:20.070

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
not really that good of a shot but I'll

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.270 
not really that good of a shot but I'll
take<00:03:25.420> it<00:03:25.630> later<00:03:25.930> though<00:03:26.200> I<00:03:26.230> put<00:03:26.530> the<00:03:26.740> clips

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
take it later though I put the clips

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.520 
take it later though I put the clips
together<00:03:27.520> with<00:03:28.000> a<00:03:28.030> little<00:03:28.330> edit<00:03:28.630> I<00:03:28.810> did<00:03:29.080> and

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
together with a little edit I did and

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.380 
together with a little edit I did and
used<00:03:30.010> the<00:03:30.190> songs<00:03:30.490> that<00:03:30.700> we<00:03:30.790> were<00:03:30.910> gonna<00:03:31.000> use

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
used the songs that we were gonna use

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:33.720 
used the songs that we were gonna use
and<00:03:31.750> Matt<00:03:32.200> still<00:03:32.590> didn't<00:03:32.950> like<00:03:33.040> it<00:03:33.280> so<00:03:33.520> then<00:03:33.700> I

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
and Matt still didn't like it so then I

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.480 
and Matt still didn't like it so then I
said<00:03:33.970> whatever<00:03:34.420> and<00:03:34.960> I<00:03:35.320> just<00:03:35.350> left<00:03:35.830> honestly

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:36.490 
said whatever and I just left honestly

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:37.680 
said whatever and I just left honestly
it<00:03:36.580> would<00:03:36.670> have<00:03:36.760> been<00:03:36.850> much<00:03:37.030> different<00:03:37.060> if

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 
it would have been much different if

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:40.050 
it would have been much different if
Dave<00:03:37.960> would<00:03:38.230> have<00:03:38.320> just<00:03:38.620> said<00:03:38.950> he<00:03:39.190> didn't<00:03:39.520> want

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
Dave would have just said he didn't want

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.270 
Dave would have just said he didn't want
to<00:03:40.570> do<00:03:40.690> the<00:03:40.840> ps3<00:03:41.230> only<00:03:41.350> chapter<00:03:41.770> like<00:03:41.980> right

people won't wash shit like that and

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.200 
people won't wash shit like that and
these<00:04:26.800> are<00:04:27.009> words<00:04:27.190> that<00:04:27.370> they<00:04:27.490> have<00:04:27.580> said<00:04:27.820> but

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 
these are words that they have said but

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.180 
these are words that they have said but
the<00:04:28.300> only<00:04:28.570> thing<00:04:28.780> that<00:04:28.990> I<00:04:29.199> really<00:04:29.710> hate<00:04:29.919> is

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
the only thing that I really hate is

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:31.650 
the only thing that I really hate is
working<00:04:30.639> hard<00:04:30.910> on<00:04:31.060> something<00:04:31.300> and<00:04:31.570> then

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:31.660 
working hard on something and then

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.659 
working hard on something and then
ending<00:04:31.960> up<00:04:32.110> with<00:04:32.289> no<00:04:32.650> result<00:04:33.130> at<00:04:33.280> all<00:04:33.430> and

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:33.669 
ending up with no result at all and

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:36.090 
ending up with no result at all and
there<00:04:34.150> won't<00:04:34.419> be<00:04:34.479> a<00:04:34.600> ps3<00:04:34.990> only<00:04:35.289> chapter<00:04:35.590> so

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:36.100 
there won't be a ps3 only chapter so

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:37.560 
there won't be a ps3 only chapter so
it's<00:04:36.610> all<00:04:36.759> good<00:04:36.940> though<00:04:36.970> I've<00:04:37.330> been<00:04:37.479> in

how<00:05:19.419> the<00:05:19.630> ps3<00:05:20.139> chapter<00:05:20.530> would<00:05:20.680> have<00:05:20.830> looked

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:21.310 
how the ps3 chapter would have looked

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:23.219 
how the ps3 chapter would have looked
for<00:05:21.729> you<00:05:21.789> guys<00:05:21.970> obviously<00:05:22.360> it<00:05:22.810> wasn't<00:05:22.960> done

Xbox there's players and ps3
now<00:06:21.550> that's<00:06:21.729> probably<00:06:21.939> because<00:06:22.029> Xbox<00:06:22.509> gets

00:06:22.739 --> 00:06:22.749 
now that's probably because Xbox gets

00:06:22.749 --> 00:06:24.390 
now that's probably because Xbox gets
better<00:06:22.960> shots<00:06:23.289> but<00:06:23.529> that<00:06:23.860> doesn't<00:06:24.189> mean<00:06:24.279> that

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:24.400 
better shots but that doesn't mean that

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.159 
better shots but that doesn't mean that
we<00:06:24.520> should<00:06:24.669> just<00:06:24.789> ignore<00:06:25.240> the<00:06:25.419> ps3<00:06:25.900> players

00:06:26.159 --> 00:06:26.169
