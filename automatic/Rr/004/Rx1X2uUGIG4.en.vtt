00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:11.880
 how we attack our cakes 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:14.130
 then we take the gelatin in sheets e 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:21.150
 200 ml of warm water 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:38.120
 we are inside two sheets 1 and 2 of 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:38.120
 jelly pieces waiting for you to 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:45.809
 soften up a bit inside the 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.270
 which to have divided into in command 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:54.390
 we put it in when it softens 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:55.170
 a little over we are in a small saucepan a 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.829
 appeal 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.829
 let's talk 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:34.390
 once the agency is dissolved 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:37.690
 expect it to cool a little earlier 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:40.900
 to leave it on our cake there 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:50.850
 gelatine sinti is over this point la 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:50.850
 I'm going to press on my cake 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:00.860
 should serve to do you that good 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.860
 the host 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:12.780
 here's the wafer now a little more 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.780
 great respect 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:30.720
 and the face directs well so then there is 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:34.489
 towards the remaining gelatin also above 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.489
 to give a shiny effect 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:51.490
 here is our ready superheroes put 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:51.490
 a bit of colored cream with the coral 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.620
