00:00:05.379 --> 00:00:12.549
 hello friends we have here near 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:16.359
 buildings in where our office is 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:21.820
 worth such a bekin now saw him 

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:27.920
 This picket is carried out by union members. 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:31.940
 construction workers and they are not happy 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:36.110
 so that the organization which is in 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:38.060
 in our building one of the offices is occupied by this 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:41.470
 arranging on him someone there 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:46.700
 do some construction work and 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:50.450
 hired for such an organization building 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:55.190
 which does not make contributions there in some 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:56.690
 a fund, that is, there is a certain fund, and if 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.670
 you hire for example some kind of there 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:03.649
 organization where employees are members 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:05.630
 of the trade union then money is paid and if 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:07.520
 here you took someone to the left then they 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.920
 may contribute may not contribute ie 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.409
 the law does not oblige them to do so 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.689
 the law allows not to make but further 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:17.270
 there is, as it were, illegal, there are trade unions 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:19.909
 who expose their conditions not 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:24.380
 so that in Silicon Valley was a lot 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:26.600
 union work but there is well first 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.090
 government officials are all right 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:32.420
 government officials summit 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:35.990
 here it is employees and federal level 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.670
 and there state and city 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.390
 municipalities as a result of all 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:43.759
 trade union so they have good pensions 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:48.770
 big because there deductions go 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:51.140
 big retired and so their job 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.520
 expensive because that's all 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.729
 paid by other people 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:58.240
 accordingly if you hire someone 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:02:00.350
 Well, the organization that corresponds 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.630
 requirements of trade unions accordingly 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.459
 it will cost you more because well 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.000
 they will make some money there 

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:07.399
 funds 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.269
 there are attacks in the market in general 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:15.920
 and not necessarily trade unions composed 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:16.549
 in short these trade union people they came out but 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.220
 they have a peak 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:23.090
 that is, there are always two such 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:26.000
 bearded dates more man large 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:28.340
 such strong guys in helmets there in 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.640
 orange jackets and 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:34.340
 they have such a poster deployed where they 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:38.720
 explain their claims there 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:41.000
 I can't say this institution 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:44.269
 teachers and me someone but most likely 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.040
 it's about psychological pressure here 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:48.019
 on this organization but not every time 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.830
 lead and must think that probably now 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:52.110
 everything 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.630
 who sees this picket think oh oh oh 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:59.160
 what bad people wanted money 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:04.410
 save but I'm walking past both walk 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:06.660
 office marriage means got one 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:10.080
 everyone 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:14.040
 so I read it carefully and make sense 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:16.410
 this flyer is that those who 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:19.380
 conducts construction work must 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:23.280
 pay money because they 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:25.080
 construction workers their families want 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.360
 receive this money that is a joke to us 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.190
 this money is needed but it is not because 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.850
 we have families because we have that 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.840
 pores all 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:36.870
 that is, how to say organized 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:39.480
 Here in this organization, she seems to be wrong 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.610
 that criminal on the law is allowed i 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:45.210
 she is economically criminal that is they 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:49.500
 actually create conditions for themselves 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:53.730
 no other people have me 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:57.700
 recently talked to us have a gardener 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:04:03.580
 who works on our site 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:06.230
 plus one and the same there was no number and he 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:09.099
 union member here these there 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:13.660
 garden workers there 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:16.660
 public services for example if here 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:19.090
 this is a city and here we go up we see 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:21.880
 trees go around trees there 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:23.560
 some kind of pavements this whole farm is 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.840
 everything is served and 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:28.240
 it belongs to all of the city so that's 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:32.350
 the city in order that it will serve not 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:34.750
 can hire a service organization in 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:36.930
 which workers are not with grandfather 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:38.280
 trade union that is how would state 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:41.320
 supports 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:43.690
 trade union so that all the work that 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:47.560
 she herself holds in front of people from 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:49.390
 union so everything turns out 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.710
 more and more expensive more and more expensive so here 

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:53.170
 we talk to a man who 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:55.420
 being a member of such a union performs 

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:58.750
 such works are there for gardening there 

00:04:55.420 --> 00:05:02.170
 by such a simple one 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:04.630
 beautification of streets and light so 

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:07.900

 mentioned that he came out now on 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:13.540
 retirement but so as if ahead of time 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:15.430
