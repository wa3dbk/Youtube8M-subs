00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.389
 alone 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:19.850
 but it was not even known that the person who donated the 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:22.769
 my heart was called betina 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:25.199

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.840
 I always told the giver and now I 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:31.619
 I told the person 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.989
 Pain is such an impersonal thing, right? 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:38.340
 it seems that the person really existed and 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:41.700

 I do not know a bad feeling one will be 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:15.330

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:17.490
 woman named paloma bianchi from a 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.640
 time to bury the dead once 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.070

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.400
 I knew how empty I feel. 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.920

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:32.880

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.299
 soothing to you want to suffer 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.970
 everything again does not lead to anything 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.250

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:49.049

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:58.979
 that seeing this girl is imperative for 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:02:00.649
 me even if it is by far I have to 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:04.939

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:40.950
 I do not know, I feel 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:43.410

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.269

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.829
 lots of things to enjoy a lot of 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:53.910
 things I did not like before I did not 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:56.760
 could imagine type by type type juca 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.769
 for example his responsibility 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.590
 going from one side to the other to 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:03.989
 Looking for a job, do not you think? 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:07.100

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:10.620
 I do not know 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:12.540
 it 's funny because because before I 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.810
 I think I was going to fight him. 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:18.150
 I leaned against the wall 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:20.220
 Nowadays, no, and I think. 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.930

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.780
 his responsibility 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:27.690
 I think it's good, I think it's great that you stay 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:30.269
 less radical - collector but without 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.180
 exaggeration, your juca does not know 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:35.850
 pleasing with this malandragem of the 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:41.160
 woman is that the name has always been the 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:43.380

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:47.000
 I was charging everybody 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:47.000
 charging myself 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:53.850
 does 

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:56.690
 that the fact that the pt has changed the heart 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:56.690
 had any influence 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:04.140

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:06.450

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:08.190
