00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:12.340

 what do you think of the atmosphere in the stadium 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:17.200
 well that is that is excellent 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:19.029
 it has also been a good choice because 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.439
 in this field what the seeds just do 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:22.419
 big enough 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:23.890
 so it's nice and full of atmosphere 

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:25.480
 excellent 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.099
 I think the promotion of dynamic 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.890
 athlete excellent 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:31.779
 what do you find attractive about hockey? 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.750
 it's the team red it's a ball sport 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:36.040
 it is it responds quickly is delivers 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.200
 is technology 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.540
 things like this because the story 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:43.210
 innovation and new rules that go whole 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.320
 fast in hockey 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.790
 You will also find it interesting for it 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.600
 football there are things that you coupe 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:48.430
 if we want to see 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.770
 well you have to look at it very specifically 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:54.250
 football is a pin of mistakes 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:55.989
 so many that it is also one 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.910
 and physical sports 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:03.010
 here if you so you have the difference 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:05.199
 see between so the other one 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.689
 because it is a bad sport that you have the 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.640
 gradually changing rain is not possible 

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:11.170
 amazed with op 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.240
 well you have in the middle of the cell 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.759
 Easter that's not what is here in the 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.130
 become a football 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:20.469
 yes I also think that it is fast and 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:23.499
 act of certain things before 

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:25.959
 for example, the rules must be 

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:28.209
 pretty simple here so you grab the ball 

00:01:25.959 --> 00:01:29.619
 play area office goes to soccer 

00:01:28.209 --> 00:01:32.770
 natural looks certainly someone 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:35.049
 stand that is what a difficult one 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.149
 situation but it is for both sides 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:38.829
 always learn photo we have here 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:40.719
 of course the hockey world cup and have 

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:42.700
 Welcome to Brazil at night 

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:43.810
 that gives me a better chance of that 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.329
 take the cup home 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.549
 Well normally hockey ladies 

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:51.009
 there are long eternity above her 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:52.970
 sit inside almost everything and mr 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:55.880
 almost always with the first 4 th 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:58.040
 you are always title candidate and at it 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.140
 You play football there because football 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:03.410
 is therefore a different situation 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:06.830
 we were tools the pool system if you 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:08.810
 ending up being super heavy is a moment 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.220
 the biggest opponent sisters I think 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.570
 Australia 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.790
 because you think you won over it 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:16.190
 but you have not yet and where he 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:20.080
 stralia points after that is immediately that 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:22.350
 13 as well and they beat out 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.350
 he was
