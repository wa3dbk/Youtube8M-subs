00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.200
 Hello 

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:05.200
 OK 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:09.990
 yes 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:11.879
 hi girls how are you today 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.590
 let's make a super romantic land 

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:16.290
 super nest to go out with the boyfriend with 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.630
 the friends to go out to where it is already 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:21.090
 you know first hydrate super super live 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.770
 your face and emery try and now I proceed 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.289
 to put me in my first eye for 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:27.720
 that the makeup remains for all 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.000
 the day if you did not have eyes first you do not 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.210
 worry because you can use a base or 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.949
 a corrector and you will go great already 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.309
 They know how to blur the super super good 

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:41.220
 Now, I'm going to proceed with that 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.970
 pink color vito coralito that I think that 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:46.350
 goes according to this special day 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:49.940
 placing it in the eye socket 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.940
 blurring the super live 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.830
 and I always end the blur with 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:59.610
 the little fingers equally in the other eye in 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:03.030
 the basin blurring the super good with 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.030
 soft pasadita 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:14.619
 and now I'm going to grab my jumbo pencil 

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:17.530
 bronze color of saiz and I'll place it 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:22.080
 on my mobile eyelid this is going to serve 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.080
 as a basis for the next step 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.439
 obviously blurring something very well with 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.710
 the fingers to stay in all the 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.710
 eyelid 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.580
 as I said the next step is 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.890
 grab this color I need it 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.110
 this bronze shadow and place it to 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:44.010
 touches on the eyelid so that it 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.010
 impregnate well 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:52.370
 and always giving it the fade 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.500
 necessary 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:57.230
 and now to make a transition between 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:00.670
 this makeup and keep putting this 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:04.070
 brown shadow appointment in the corner of the eye 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:06.140
 towards the middle that's so there's a 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.540
 harmony between the colors and look a lot 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.470
 more beautiful and like much more 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:12.090
 professional 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.220
 Now you know that I love the 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.450
 simple makeup with eyebrows 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.090
 supermarkets is that less penalties 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.770
 I paint always giving in the original form 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.830
 of my eyebrows only laughed at the 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:25.020
 holes and obviously unmissable gel 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:29.160
 of saiz although it super fascinates me because 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:30.810
 leave my eyebrows intact and I do it and 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.910
 now let's light up the look and 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.370
 will sound from this planet shadow 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.230
 placing it in tongue quoted from the eyebrow and 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.910
 in the German 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.880
 this is to give you already know light to the 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:46.230
 look plays good to win the color 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:48.420
 with the tail now the color 2 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.630
 coral milestone and I will be placed under 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.630
 my 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.730
 infaltable our black pencil 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:59.130
 obviously to frame super good 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:02.430
 our look so he placed it in the 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:04.770
 eye water line and to seal it 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:08.570
 that bold shadow so he stays 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.570
 all 10 makeup 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.470
 and now we make our super delineated 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:17.100
 in this case I do not want to make a 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:20.840
 delineated very exaggerated so what super 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:24.200
 subtle and obviously eyebrows 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:26.330
 the eyebrows forgive the eyelashes can not 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:29.110
 missing the eyelashes so we pray 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:31.930
 super good lashes 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:35.190
 and we give our special touch with 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.190
 our favorite mask 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.430
 now let's clean up the whole disaster 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:45.000
 that we had in our face if it fell 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.620
 some makeup with this concealer what 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.599
 placed under the eyes and we're going to 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:51.420
 blur very very well that you wanted 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:53.940
 it looks super clear but at the time of 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:56.300
 smoking what is not going to be noticed as well as 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:58.760
 they are watching it right now 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:00.680
 we blur it super super well too 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.980
 in any imperfection that we have 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:06.010
 They already know how to be English 3 but right now 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:09.160
 to be perfect 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:11.560
 the trick is in the blur 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:13.840
 I think it stays 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:17.079
 super well our makeup I'm 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:21.079
 grabbing this powder something more subtle and 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:25.310
 must place in the area t of the face 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:29.110
 and obviously you already know the bronzer 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:29.110
 to outline the face 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:37.580
 we illuminate a little is illuminated me 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:40.309
 really love is a shadow but use 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:42.860
 as the illuminate and nothing perfect 

00:04:40.309 --> 00:04:44.990
 I put some hair something subtle something 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:48.399
 super soft because it is a 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:48.399
 more makeup to say 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:55.030
 and now you can draw my lips with a 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:55.030
 pencil 

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:02.960
 and to give it a little more brightness I'm going to 

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:06.589
 grab this baby link and see how it is 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:08.089
 super cute makeup super subtle and 

00:05:06.589 --> 00:05:10.029
 now the hairstyle 

00:05:08.089 --> 00:05:12.949
 for the hairstyle what I'm doing is 

00:05:10.029 --> 00:05:16.210
 a braid and is giving you the address 

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:19.529
 that I want in this case back 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:22.349
 equally on the other side 

00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:24.829
 are the three quotes impurities not so 

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:24.829
 thin 

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:31.090
 and we do not highlight backwards it's something 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:32.729
 super simple anybody can 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:35.759
 do 

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:37.190
 but still gives that romantic touch that 

00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:40.520
 We are looking for 

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:42.290

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:44.510
