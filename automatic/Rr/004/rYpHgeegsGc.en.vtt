on top of be flag and you just throw it

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.590 
on top of be flag and you just throw it
straight<00:02:36.200> up<00:02:36.230> to<00:02:36.500> a<00:02:36.640> that'll<00:02:37.640> also<00:02:37.880> hit<00:02:38.180> a<00:02:38.330> flag

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
straight up to a that'll also hit a flag

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.750 
straight up to a that'll also hit a flag
and<00:02:38.930> didn't<00:02:39.830> include<00:02:40.070> that<00:02:40.190> one<00:02:40.460> in<00:02:40.610> here

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
and didn't include that one in here

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.790 
and didn't include that one in here
though<00:02:40.970> here's<00:02:41.720> another<00:02:41.960> one<00:02:42.230> to<00:02:42.320> see<00:02:42.500> and<00:02:42.710> as

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
you can see we got another double spot

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.560 
you can see we got another double spot
earlier<00:02:45.440> you<00:02:45.590> saw<00:02:45.830> this<00:02:46.010> hit<00:02:46.220> and<00:02:46.340> B<00:02:46.520> flag<00:02:46.820> put

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570 
earlier you saw this hit and B flag put

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:49.180 
earlier you saw this hit and B flag put
yourself<00:02:47.930> up<00:02:48.110> in<00:02:48.230> these<00:02:48.320> stairs<00:02:48.680> again<00:02:48.830> you

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
yourself up in these stairs again you

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.030 
yourself up in these stairs again you
can<00:02:49.340> also<00:02:49.520> hit<00:02:49.820> C<00:02:50.120> flag<00:02:50.480> so<00:02:50.720> once<00:02:50.930> again<00:02:51.110> we

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
can also hit C flag so once again we

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.650 
can also hit C flag so once again we
really<00:02:52.250> tried<00:02:52.520> to<00:02:52.640> take<00:02:52.820> a<00:02:52.850> lot<00:02:53.060> of<00:02:53.120> time<00:02:53.210> do

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
really tried to take a lot of time do

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.720 
really tried to take a lot of time do
something<00:02:54.080> different<00:02:54.500> and<00:02:54.650> find<00:02:55.400> double
