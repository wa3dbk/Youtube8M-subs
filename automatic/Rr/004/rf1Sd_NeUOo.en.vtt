00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:14.410
 today we will make the recipe 

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:17.160
 ham endives for this purpose 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:19.560
 slices of ham 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.760
 you are rap and we will need a 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.490
 amount of butter 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.950
 we will also do a béchamel so 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.310
 as usual for béchamel du 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:31.529
 butter from the flour of the salt 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.870
 pepper and nutmeg and then we'll have 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:38.550
 also need this butter because we're going 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:40.769
 bring back our our endive we go the 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.230
 to braising in fact we have instead of 

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:45.210
 use them as they are or the 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.559
 boil as I can see from 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.210
 from time to time or leave them as is 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.190
 roll them he's baked and 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.079
 leave forty minutes leather 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.480
 she jamblon me what I do 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.280
 is that I cut them in two or in 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.350
 four and I 'm going to brown them 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.649
 in butter and then I 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.120
 will add a little water so 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.770
 the braised aisles they are 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.170
 soft and then I'll use them 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:08.869
 to just do the chicory 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.149
 ham so roll them in ham 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:15.090
 pass béchamel cover them 

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:17.220
 two counties and send them to the oven and there 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.430
 it's going to be something else 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:23.450
 all this for cut noting from yves 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:26.160
 saleswoman simply 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:29.640
 so of course I have already washed them and 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:31.880
 clean and rid of leaves that 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.830
 are not useful for presentation 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:40.020
 in a hot skillet 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:42.229
 we will put about 25 members at 30 g 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.229
 of butter 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:55.530
 and we saw the endives face cut 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:57.210
 to the pan and return the 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.610
 regularly forget about leaving it's from the 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:03.149
 to brown like those one on all 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:05.039
 the faces they are well braised so 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.080
 ball pretty well gone where are we going 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:09.110
 continue a little bit further 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.430
 returning regularly number of hours 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:14.519
 we will get something very 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.590
 tasty and dealing indices 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:19.440
 are well braised away are well colored 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.569
 on all sides and starts to be 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.010
 to tend towards is so what I forgot 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:25.319
 to show you just now in the 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:28.380
 presentation that's it is that I have a 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:29.640
 remains of foot poultry so it's 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.069
 chicken broth I made myself 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.299
 it's completely optional 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.950
 because I leave if I had not 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:36.720
 I would have just put water 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.090
 that he's here as I leave I'm going 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.720
 use it and so I'm going to wet a 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:46.730
 little endive with and I'm going 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:50.010
 lower the chicory absorb this broth 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:53.100
 until bale is absorbed into 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.480
 part at least is so good it's going us 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.610
 allow to have chicory that goes 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:00.120
 to be very mellow endive thater his 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:02.250
 braised and poaching actually exactly in 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.410
 chicken broth or in water 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.970
 I will reserve them on a plate 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:10.920
 and now we will focus on 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:12.910
 bechamel we will pass on the video 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:18.400

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:20.140

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.460

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:24.610

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:30.030

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:32.490
 put in the oven for just 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:36.790

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:40.520
