I<00:01:30.979> want<00:01:31.100> to<00:01:31.130> say<00:01:31.310> flak<00:01:32.030> jacket<00:01:32.390> if<00:01:32.479> you<00:01:32.570> do<00:01:32.720> not

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
I want to say flak jacket if you do not

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.450 
I want to say flak jacket if you do not
know<00:01:33.020> it's<00:01:33.229> basically<00:01:33.590> the<00:01:33.680> same<00:01:33.829> thing<00:01:34.220> and

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
know it's basically the same thing and

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.810 
know it's basically the same thing and
as<00:01:34.759> in<00:01:35.509> the<00:01:35.689> original<00:01:35.840> black<00:01:36.259> ops<00:01:36.500> you<00:01:37.280> get<00:01:37.460> you

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
as in the original black ops you get you

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.770 
as in the original black ops you get you
take<00:01:38.000> less<00:01:38.210> damage<00:01:38.240> from<00:01:38.990> explosives<00:01:40.030> so<00:01:41.030> the

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
take less damage from explosives so the

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.179 
take less damage from explosives so the
reason<00:01:41.960> why<00:01:42.229> I<00:01:42.259> think<00:01:42.649> this<00:01:42.740> is<00:01:42.860> going<00:01:43.009> to<00:01:43.070> be

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:43.189 
reason why I think this is going to be

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:44.830 
reason why I think this is going to be
the<00:01:43.280> best<00:01:43.430> perk<00:01:43.670> in<00:01:43.880> the<00:01:43.970> game<00:01:44.119> right<00:01:44.509> off<00:01:44.689> the

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
the best perk in the game right off the

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
don't i don't know if it's going to be

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:49.450 
don't i don't know if it's going to be
the<00:01:48.110> best<00:01:48.259> perk<00:01:48.500> through<00:01:48.740> the<00:01:48.860> entirety<00:01:49.219> of

the best perk through the entirety of

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.280 
the best perk through the entirety of
the<00:01:49.610> game<00:01:49.759> but<00:01:50.149> right<00:01:50.299> off<00:01:50.360> the<00:01:50.540> bat<00:01:50.689> is<00:01:50.869> going

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:51.290 
the game but right off the bat is going

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.200 
the game but right off the bat is going
to<00:01:51.380> be<00:01:51.469> very<00:01:51.619> useful<00:01:51.770> and<00:01:52.310> it<00:01:52.610> is<00:01:52.729> going<00:01:52.909> to<00:01:53.090> be

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
to be very useful and it is going to be

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.810 
to be very useful and it is going to be
one<00:01:53.420> of<00:01:53.450> your<00:01:53.600> best<00:01:53.630> perks<00:01:54.229> that<00:01:54.740> they<00:01:55.399> see<00:01:55.460> it

one of your best perks that they see it

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.520 
one of your best perks that they see it
hopefully<00:01:56.090> doesn't<00:01:56.390> turn<00:01:56.719> into<00:01:56.840> a<00:01:57.049> must-have

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
hopefully doesn't turn into a must-have

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:58.810 
hopefully doesn't turn into a must-have
perk<00:01:57.799> and<00:01:57.950> I<00:01:58.009> don't<00:01:58.189> think<00:01:58.369> it<00:01:58.430> will<00:01:58.579> but<00:01:58.759> right

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
perk and I don't think it will but right

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.359 
perk and I don't think it will but right
off<00:01:58.939> the<00:01:59.149> bat<00:01:59.329> like<00:02:00.170> I<00:02:00.289> said<00:02:00.350> it's<00:02:00.799> going<00:02:01.130> to<00:02:01.250> be

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
off the bat like I said it's going to be

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:02.859 
off the bat like I said it's going to be
the<00:02:01.520> best<00:02:01.670> park<00:02:01.909> in<00:02:02.030> the<00:02:02.119> game<00:02:02.270> and<00:02:02.479> the<00:02:02.750> reason

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
the best park in the game and the reason

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:04.749 
the best park in the game and the reason
why<00:02:03.110> if<00:02:03.380> we<00:02:03.680> look<00:02:03.829> at<00:02:03.950> the<00:02:04.039> score<00:02:04.280> streaks<00:02:04.549> here

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 
why if we look at the score streaks here

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:07.450 
why if we look at the score streaks here
we<00:02:05.420> see<00:02:05.570> the<00:02:05.600> rc-xd<00:02:06.079> as<00:02:06.590> the<00:02:06.920> lowest<00:02:07.130> score

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
we see the rc-xd as the lowest score

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.570 
we see the rc-xd as the lowest score
streak<00:02:07.759> at<00:02:07.939> 235<00:02:08.930> points<00:02:09.170> moving<00:02:10.039> on<00:02:10.130> up<00:02:10.280> we<00:02:10.430> see

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
streak at 235 points moving on up we see

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.250 
streak at 235 points moving on up we see
the<00:02:10.700> hunter<00:02:10.970> killer<00:02:11.180> drone<00:02:11.270> at<00:02:11.540> 400<00:02:12.080> points

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
the hunter killer drone at 400 points

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.460 
the hunter killer drone at 400 points
and<00:02:13.000> even<00:02:14.000> a<00:02:14.060> little<00:02:14.210> farther<00:02:14.540> you<00:02:14.780> see<00:02:14.990> the

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
and even a little farther you see the

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.890 
and even a little farther you see the
hellstorm<00:02:16.010> missile<00:02:16.040> which<00:02:16.460> is<00:02:16.580> basically<00:02:16.970> a

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
hellstorm missile which is basically a

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.259 
hellstorm missile which is basically a
predator<00:02:18.319> on<00:02:18.349> steroids<00:02:19.040> it's<00:02:19.430> it's<00:02:19.790> an<00:02:20.000> even

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:20.269 
predator on steroids it's it's an even

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:22.569 
predator on steroids it's it's an even
better<00:02:20.450> than<00:02:20.629> predator<00:02:21.110> at<00:02:21.200> 525<00:02:22.010> points<00:02:22.280> and

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:22.579 
better than predator at 525 points and

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:24.610 
better than predator at 525 points and
then<00:02:22.970> the<00:02:23.090> lightning<00:02:23.390> strike<00:02:23.629> at<00:02:23.780> 550<00:02:24.470> points

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
then the lightning strike at 550 points

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.580 
then the lightning strike at 550 points
now<00:02:25.099> all<00:02:25.340> of<00:02:25.519> these<00:02:25.640> score<00:02:25.909> streaks<00:02:26.209> are<00:02:26.590> going

hell<00:03:00.260> strong<00:03:00.440> muscle<00:03:00.739> is<00:03:00.829> lightning<00:03:01.190> strike

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
hell strong muscle is lightning strike

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.490 
hell strong muscle is lightning strike
is<00:03:01.700> is<00:03:02.000> basically<00:03:02.599> the<00:03:02.959> mortar<00:03:03.230> team<00:03:03.379> from

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
is is basically the mortar team from

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.199 
is is basically the mortar team from
black<00:03:03.709> ops<00:03:03.950> so<00:03:04.250> that's<00:03:04.730> a<00:03:04.819> whole<00:03:04.970> bunch<00:03:05.150> of

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
black ops so that's a whole bunch of

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:06.670 
black ops so that's a whole bunch of
explosives<00:03:05.780> that<00:03:05.840> are<00:03:05.989> very<00:03:06.139> easy<00:03:06.379> to<00:03:06.500> get

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
explosives that are very easy to get

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.190 
explosives that are very easy to get

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:11.269 
streaks and flak jacket is going to help

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:12.879 
streaks and flak jacket is going to help
with<00:03:11.389> all<00:03:11.510> those<00:03:11.720> i've<00:03:12.349> been<00:03:12.500> playing<00:03:12.650> call<00:03:12.859> of

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:12.889 
with all those i've been playing call of

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:14.410 
with all those i've been playing call of
duty<00:03:12.980> for<00:03:13.340> five<00:03:13.519> years<00:03:13.639> like<00:03:13.879> i've<00:03:14.000> said<00:03:14.030> and

duty for five years like i've said and

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.390 
duty for five years like i've said and
the<00:03:14.750> pattern<00:03:15.139> is<00:03:15.290> always<00:03:15.560> the<00:03:15.680> same<00:03:15.889> guys<00:03:16.189> to

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
the pattern is always the same guys to

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.280 
the pattern is always the same guys to
use<00:03:16.579> the<00:03:17.030> low<00:03:17.269> score<00:03:17.599> streaks<00:03:17.870> right<00:03:18.079> in<00:03:18.200> the

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
use the low score streaks right in the

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:19.929 
use the low score streaks right in the
game<00:03:18.470> comes<00:03:18.769> out<00:03:18.889> or<00:03:19.069> point<00:03:19.340> streaks<00:03:19.639> or<00:03:19.790> kill

those<00:03:21.859> low<00:03:22.099> killstreaks<00:03:22.669> partly<00:03:23.299> because

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:23.449 
those low killstreaks partly because

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:25.509 
those low killstreaks partly because
that's<00:03:23.810> all<00:03:23.959> they<00:03:24.079> have<00:03:24.199> access<00:03:24.560> to<00:03:24.769> in<00:03:24.980> most

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:25.519 
that's all they have access to in most

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:27.039 
that's all they have access to in most
of<00:03:25.699> the<00:03:25.760> call<00:03:25.910> of<00:03:26.030> duty's<00:03:26.269> but<00:03:26.629> partly<00:03:26.870> because

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:27.049 
of the call of duty's but partly because

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:29.140 
of the call of duty's but partly because
they're<00:03:27.410> also<00:03:27.560> easy<00:03:27.680> to<00:03:27.980> get<00:03:28.220> and<00:03:28.400> they<00:03:28.970> are

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
they're also easy to get and they are

with<00:03:33.199> low<00:03:33.440> kill<00:03:33.680> streaks<00:03:34.040> and<00:03:34.250> here's<00:03:34.879> a<00:03:34.970> class

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
with low kill streaks and here's a class

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:36.879 
with low kill streaks and here's a class
that<00:03:35.480> I<00:03:35.569> created<00:03:35.900> in<00:03:36.139> this<00:03:36.230> black<00:03:36.500> ops<00:03:36.680> 2

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:36.889 
that I created in this black ops 2

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:39.069 
that I created in this black ops 2
simulator<00:03:37.430> here<00:03:37.760> obviously<00:03:38.449> I<00:03:38.690> got<00:03:38.840> flak

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:39.079 
simulator here obviously I got flak

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:40.659 
simulator here obviously I got flak
jacket<00:03:39.440> on<00:03:39.530> there<00:03:39.709> and<00:03:39.829> then<00:03:39.949> I<00:03:39.980> doubled<00:03:40.370> up<00:03:40.519> on

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:40.669 
jacket on there and then I doubled up on

00:03:40.669 --> 00:03:42.039 
jacket on there and then I doubled up on
ghost<00:03:41.090> because<00:03:41.359> there's<00:03:41.690> going<00:03:41.780> to<00:03:41.870> be<00:03:41.900> lots

00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:42.049 
ghost because there's going to be lots

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:44.289 
ghost because there's going to be lots
of<00:03:42.230> UAVs<00:03:42.590> at<00:03:42.859> the<00:03:42.949> start<00:03:43.190> of<00:03:43.459> black<00:03:43.940> ops<00:03:44.090> 2

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:44.299 
of UAVs at the start of black ops 2

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:45.939 
of UAVs at the start of black ops 2
there<00:03:44.480> always<00:03:44.690> is<00:03:44.840> at<00:03:45.169> the<00:03:45.260> start<00:03:45.470> up<00:03:45.530> any<00:03:45.709> call

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:45.949 
there always is at the start up any call

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:48.030 
there always is at the start up any call
of<00:03:46.010> duty<00:03:46.250> game<00:03:46.430> like<00:03:47.150> I<00:03:47.269> was<00:03:47.389> saying<00:03:47.569> before

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
of duty game like I was saying before

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.039 
of duty game like I was saying before
especially<00:03:49.040> in<00:03:49.220> this<00:03:49.370> game<00:03:49.699> black<00:03:49.940> ops<00:03:50.060> 2<00:03:50.389> you

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:51.049 
especially in this game black ops 2 you

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:53.199 
especially in this game black ops 2 you
get<00:03:51.169> UAV<00:03:51.650> assists<00:03:52.129> every<00:03:52.459> time<00:03:52.669> one<00:03:53.030> of<00:03:53.090> your

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:53.209 
get UAV assists every time one of your

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:55.119 
get UAV assists every time one of your
teammates<00:03:53.479> gets<00:03:53.780> a<00:03:53.870> kill<00:03:54.079> while<00:03:54.319> your<00:03:54.620> UAV<00:03:54.919> is

00:03:55.119 --> 00:03:55.129 
teammates gets a kill while your UAV is

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:56.740 
teammates gets a kill while your UAV is
up<00:03:55.280> in<00:03:55.370> the<00:03:55.400> air<00:03:55.579> so<00:03:55.819> it<00:03:55.849> actually<00:03:56.120> is<00:03:56.419> even

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
up in the air so it actually is even

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.869 
up in the air so it actually is even
better<00:03:56.900> in<00:03:57.229> terms<00:03:57.889> of<00:03:58.129> building<00:03:58.489> up<00:03:58.699> your

00:03:58.869 --> 00:03:58.879 
better in terms of building up your

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:01.420 
better in terms of building up your
score<00:03:59.090> streak<00:03:59.329> in<00:03:59.479> black<00:03:59.690> ops<00:03:59.840> 2<00:03:59.959> but<00:04:00.769> if<00:04:01.040> you

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.430 
score streak in black ops 2 but if you

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.039 
score streak in black ops 2 but if you
guys<00:04:01.549> don't<00:04:01.790> know<00:04:01.970> they<00:04:02.180> took<00:04:02.389> the<00:04:02.599> ghost<00:04:02.840> pert

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:03.049 
guys don't know they took the ghost pert

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:04.599 
guys don't know they took the ghost pert
from<00:04:03.139> black<00:04:03.440> ops<00:04:03.680> and<00:04:03.919> they<00:04:04.099> broke<00:04:04.280> it<00:04:04.430> up<00:04:04.489> into

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:04.609 
from black ops and they broke it up into

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:06.490 
from black ops and they broke it up into
three<00:04:04.940> different<00:04:05.090> perch<00:04:05.389> so<00:04:05.629> hopefully<00:04:06.379> it's

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
three different perch so hopefully it's

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.379 
three different perch so hopefully it's
not<00:04:06.620> me<00:04:06.799> overpowered<00:04:07.400> I<00:04:07.549> don't<00:04:08.060> think<00:04:08.239> it'll

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:08.389 
not me overpowered I don't think it'll

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:11.800 
not me overpowered I don't think it'll
be<00:04:08.479> too<00:04:08.569> overpowered<00:04:09.260> in<00:04:09.379> this<00:04:09.560> game<00:04:09.769> and<00:04:10.810> for

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.810 
be too overpowered in this game and for

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:13.509 
be too overpowered in this game and for
the<00:04:11.870> ghost<00:04:12.199> perk<00:04:12.500> to<00:04:12.650> actually<00:04:12.949> work<00:04:13.190> to

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:13.519 
the ghost perk to actually work to

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:16.210 
the ghost perk to actually work to
actually<00:04:13.790> not<00:04:14.750> be<00:04:14.900> seen<00:04:15.139> on<00:04:15.379> the<00:04:15.709> enemy<00:04:15.859> UAV

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
actually not be seen on the enemy UAV

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:17.949 
actually not be seen on the enemy UAV
you<00:04:16.849> actually<00:04:17.120> have<00:04:17.209> to<00:04:17.269> be<00:04:17.329> moving<00:04:17.690> so

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
you actually have to be moving so

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:19.629 
you actually have to be moving so
hopefully<00:04:18.709> it's<00:04:18.829> not<00:04:18.949> going<00:04:19.070> to<00:04:19.159> be<00:04:19.250> a

00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:19.639 
hopefully it's not going to be a

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:21.550 
hopefully it's not going to be a
nuisance<00:04:20.180> like<00:04:20.539> it<00:04:20.659> wasn't<00:04:20.840> black<00:04:21.109> ops<00:04:21.349> and

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 
nuisance like it wasn't black ops and

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.219 
nuisance like it wasn't black ops and
then<00:04:22.430> the<00:04:22.699> rest<00:04:22.849> of<00:04:22.970> the<00:04:23.030> class<00:04:23.240> from<00:04:24.020> there

00:04:24.219 --> 00:04:24.229 
then the rest of the class from there

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:26.200 
then the rest of the class from there
you<00:04:24.470> can<00:04:24.500> kind<00:04:24.949> of<00:04:25.039> mix<00:04:25.520> and<00:04:25.760> match<00:04:25.880> and<00:04:26.090> go

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220 
I'm very interested to see how the

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.130 
I'm very interested to see how the
combination<00:04:37.880> of<00:04:37.970> those<00:04:38.090> two<00:04:38.150> perks<00:04:38.600> work<00:04:38.870> and

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:39.140 
combination of those two perks work and

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:41.140 
combination of those two perks work and
whether<00:04:39.830> you<00:04:40.220> know<00:04:40.430> one's<00:04:40.730> better<00:04:40.940> than<00:04:41.030> the

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
whether you know one's better than the

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.240 
whether you know one's better than the
other<00:04:41.390> and<00:04:41.510> whether<00:04:42.140> doubling<00:04:42.620> up<00:04:42.740> is<00:04:42.920> really

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.250 
other and whether doubling up is really

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:45.700 
other and whether doubling up is really
that<00:04:43.430> more<00:04:43.730> has<00:04:44.600> that<00:04:44.780> big<00:04:44.960> of<00:04:45.050> a<00:04:45.140> difference

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:45.710 
that more has that big of a difference

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:47.110 
that more has that big of a difference
rather<00:04:46.100> than<00:04:46.250> just<00:04:46.460> having<00:04:46.640> one<00:04:46.850> so<00:04:47.030> I'm

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 
rather than just having one so I'm

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.000 
rather than just having one so I'm
really<00:04:47.240> interested<00:04:47.510> in<00:04:47.780> that<00:04:47.930> and<00:04:48.170> then<00:04:48.230> like

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.010 
really interested in that and then like

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:50.200 
really interested in that and then like
I<00:04:49.100> said<00:04:49.160> the<00:04:49.370> rest<00:04:49.490> of<00:04:49.610> class<00:04:49.700> isn't<00:04:50.180> that
