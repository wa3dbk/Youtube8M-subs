at<00:04:39.690> about<00:04:40.190> 5,700<00:04:41.190> revs<00:04:41.729> which<00:04:42.479> gives<00:04:42.810> you

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
at about 5,700 revs which gives you

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.560 
at about 5,700 revs which gives you
another<00:04:43.380> genuine<00:04:44.039> power<00:04:44.550> back<00:04:44.880> all<00:04:45.240> the<00:04:45.539> way

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:13.140 
so what has Honda really been up to the

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:15.050 
so what has Honda really been up to the
integra<00:05:13.620> range<00:05:13.860> has<00:05:14.100> been<00:05:14.250> going<00:05:14.580> in<00:05:14.700> Japan

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:15.060 
integra range has been going in Japan

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:18.020 
integra range has been going in Japan
for<00:05:15.450> around<00:05:15.960> 12<00:05:16.350> years<00:05:16.440> and<00:05:17.010> is<00:05:17.430> really<00:05:17.610> just<00:05:17.940> a

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.030 
for around 12 years and is really just a

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:20.030 
for around 12 years and is really just a
domestic<00:05:18.180> range<00:05:18.990> of<00:05:19.140> cars<00:05:19.380> there's<00:05:19.680> nothing

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:20.040 
domestic range of cars there's nothing

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.970 
domestic range of cars there's nothing
important<00:05:20.460> about<00:05:20.640> them<00:05:20.820> at<00:05:20.910> all<00:05:21.090> this<00:05:22.080> is<00:05:22.440> the

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:22.980 
important about them at all this is the

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:25.730 
important about them at all this is the
top<00:05:23.160> of<00:05:23.190> the<00:05:23.340> range<00:05:23.580> for<00:05:24.330> Japan<00:05:24.780> and<00:05:25.020> again<00:05:25.470> has

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:25.740 
top of the range for Japan and again has
