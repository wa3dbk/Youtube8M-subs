pushing the button on the side and you
know<00:02:08.610> obviously<00:02:09.119> one<00:02:09.420> would<00:02:10.140> be<00:02:10.259> up<00:02:10.379> to<00:02:10.500> 25%<00:02:10.920> 2

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
know obviously one would be up to 25% 2

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
four would be up to a hundred when you

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.050 
four would be up to a hundred when you
get<00:02:16.170> those<00:02:16.260> LEDs<00:02:16.740> they<00:02:17.190> do<00:02:17.250> timeout<00:02:17.760> after

get those LEDs they do timeout after

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.580 
get those LEDs they do timeout after
about<00:02:18.240> ten<00:02:18.480> seconds<00:02:18.900> so<00:02:19.020> they're<00:02:19.200> not<00:02:19.290> drawing

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
about ten seconds so they're not drawing

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.620 
about ten seconds so they're not drawing
any<00:02:19.770> extra<00:02:20.220> power<00:02:20.400> now<00:02:20.970> you<00:02:21.000> can<00:02:21.240> charge<00:02:21.420> your

side that will check that so if you want
to<00:05:04.409> check<00:05:04.590> it<00:05:04.740> it'll<00:05:05.159> come<00:05:05.280> up<00:05:05.340> we're<00:05:05.580> working

00:05:05.899 --> 00:05:05.909 
to check it it'll come up we're working

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:08.510 
to check it it'll come up we're working
it<00:05:06.030> right<00:05:06.270> about<00:05:06.500> 75%<00:05:07.500> or<00:05:07.680> so<00:05:07.919> in<00:05:08.190> battery

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520 
it right about 75% or so in battery

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.189 
it right about 75% or so in battery
because<00:05:08.759> we've<00:05:08.879> got<00:05:09.060> three<00:05:09.300> out<00:05:09.389> of<00:05:09.419> four<00:05:09.719> LEDs

00:05:10.189 --> 00:05:10.199 
because we've got three out of four LEDs

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:11.749 
because we've got three out of four LEDs
and<00:05:10.440> this<00:05:10.800> whole<00:05:10.949> time<00:05:11.099> out<00:05:11.280> in<00:05:11.370> about<00:05:11.550> 10

00:05:11.749 --> 00:05:11.759 
and this whole time out in about 10

00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:15.230 
and this whole time out in about 10
seconds<00:05:12.120> and<00:05:12.210> go<00:05:12.389> off<00:05:13.099> again<00:05:14.099> when<00:05:14.909> you<00:05:14.969> plug

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 
seconds and go off again when you plug

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.760 
seconds and go off again when you plug
something<00:05:15.270> into<00:05:15.870> this<00:05:16.110> this<00:05:16.379> will<00:05:16.529> come<00:05:16.740> up

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:16.770 
something into this this will come up

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.769 
something into this this will come up
and<00:05:17.069> be<00:05:17.460> running<00:05:17.819> so<00:05:18.270> that<00:05:18.300> you<00:05:18.449> know<00:05:18.569> how<00:05:18.719> much

00:05:18.769 --> 00:05:18.779 
and be running so that you know how much

00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:20.420 
and be running so that you know how much
you<00:05:19.020> have<00:05:19.169> left<00:05:19.379> while<00:05:19.800> you're<00:05:20.009> charging

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:20.430 
you have left while you're charging

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:21.740 
you have left while you're charging
something<00:05:20.789> too<00:05:20.940> so<00:05:21.120> that's<00:05:21.300> good<00:05:21.479> that<00:05:21.629> they

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:21.750 
something too so that's good that they

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:23.420 
something too so that's good that they
did<00:05:21.810> that<00:05:22.139> on<00:05:22.529> this<00:05:22.979> side<00:05:23.159> you<00:05:23.279> have<00:05:23.400> your

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:23.430 
did that on this side you have your

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:26.029 
did that on this side you have your
input<00:05:23.520> this<00:05:23.969> is<00:05:24.120> that<00:05:24.300> five<00:05:24.539> volt<00:05:24.810> 2<00:05:25.050> amp<00:05:25.259> micro

00:05:26.029 --> 00:05:26.039 
input this is that five volt 2 amp micro

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:29.959 
input this is that five volt 2 amp micro
USB<00:05:26.460> input<00:05:26.490> and<00:05:27.120> then<00:05:27.479> you<00:05:27.599> have<00:05:27.750> your<00:05:27.870> IQ<00:05:28.969> dual

00:05:29.959 --> 00:05:29.969 
USB input and then you have your IQ dual

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:32.869 
USB input and then you have your IQ dual
outputs<00:05:30.539> of<00:05:31.020> up<00:05:31.259> to<00:05:31.289> 2.4<00:05:31.979> HAMP's<00:05:32.340> apiece<00:05:32.669> and

00:05:32.869 --> 00:05:32.879 
outputs of up to 2.4 HAMP's apiece and

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:34.820 
outputs of up to 2.4 HAMP's apiece and
the<00:05:33.300> IQ<00:05:33.449> basically<00:05:34.110> stands<00:05:34.379> for<00:05:34.560> if<00:05:34.650> I<00:05:34.740> have

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:34.830 
the IQ basically stands for if I have

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:36.170 
the IQ basically stands for if I have
something<00:05:35.190> that<00:05:35.400> I<00:05:35.430> want<00:05:35.610> to<00:05:35.669> plug<00:05:35.819> in<00:05:36.000> here

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:36.180 
something that I want to plug in here

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.350 
something that I want to plug in here
that<00:05:36.629> will<00:05:36.779> only<00:05:36.990> be<00:05:37.729> that<00:05:38.729> will<00:05:38.849> only<00:05:38.969> support

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360 
that will only be that will only support

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.809 
that will only be that will only support
one<00:05:39.719> amp<00:05:40.020> it<00:05:40.319> will<00:05:40.589> actually<00:05:41.310> only<00:05:41.430> push<00:05:41.789> one

00:05:41.809 --> 00:05:41.819 
one amp it will actually only push one

00:05:41.819 --> 00:05:44.420 
one amp it will actually only push one
amp<00:05:42.210> it<00:05:42.330> won't<00:05:42.479> try<00:05:42.659> to<00:05:42.719> push<00:05:42.900> 2.4<00:05:43.529> amps<00:05:43.860> into<00:05:44.279> a

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:44.430 
amp it won't try to push 2.4 amps into a

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:46.369 
amp it won't try to push 2.4 amps into a
device<00:05:44.699> that<00:05:44.879> only<00:05:44.909> supports<00:05:45.389> one<00:05:45.419> amp<00:05:45.779> so

00:05:46.369 --> 00:05:46.379 
device that only supports one amp so

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:48.980 
device that only supports one amp so
let's<00:05:46.620> give<00:05:47.219> a<00:05:47.430> quick<00:05:47.460> charge<00:05:48.210> demo<00:05:48.719> here

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:14.250 
you can see on the device the capacity

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:15.619 
you can see on the device the capacity
meter<00:06:14.460> does<00:06:14.759> come<00:06:15.000> up<00:06:15.029> while<00:06:15.330> you're<00:06:15.449> charging

00:06:15.619 --> 00:06:15.629 
meter does come up while you're charging

meter does come up while you're charging
and<00:06:16.110> every<00:06:16.409> once<00:06:16.560> in<00:06:16.650> a<00:06:16.710> while<00:06:16.860> will<00:06:17.789> blink<00:06:18.060> a

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:18.150 
and every once in a while will blink a

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:19.459 
and every once in a while will blink a
little<00:06:18.389> bit<00:06:18.509> there<00:06:18.690> to<00:06:18.719> let<00:06:19.020> you<00:06:19.110> know<00:06:19.229> how

00:06:19.459 --> 00:06:19.469 
little bit there to let you know how

00:06:19.469 --> 00:06:22.189 
little bit there to let you know how
much<00:06:19.650> capacity<00:06:20.639> you<00:06:21.180> have<00:06:21.210> left<00:06:21.659> in<00:06:21.900> your

00:06:22.189 --> 00:06:22.199 
much capacity you have left in your

00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:23.839 
much capacity you have left in your
power<00:06:22.589> bank<00:06:22.800> as<00:06:22.979> you're<00:06:23.219> charging<00:06:23.550> a<00:06:23.610> device
