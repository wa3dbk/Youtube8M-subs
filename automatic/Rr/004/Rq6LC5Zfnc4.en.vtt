00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:10.330
 the big question is what does the hawk have 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:13.539
 pilgrim that allows him to be a 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:16.570
 such efficient predator is so lethal and 

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:18.820
 so extremely fast in flight and not only 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:21.160
 that and how he faces the difficulties of 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:23.679
 such extreme speed because these 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:26.109
 birds reach 320 kilometers by 

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:28.119
 time as they support it I do not know why 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:30.130
 own experience that force you 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:31.779
 same to jump off that ledge is itself 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.490
 a challenge to death 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:35.740
 I do not talk about managing the fall 

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:38.050
 free however alcohol does it 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:39.940
 As if nothing has not yet figured out 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.130
 but I'm going to do it although I think the 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.590
 secret what has this bird of prey is 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:46.750
 fantastic bird of prey 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.460
 so let me do a review 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.070
 of the physical characteristics that 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:54.310
 turn this bird into a torpedo 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:57.309
 with wings and throw feathers name number 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:01:01.070
 1 look in the eyes 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:03.230
 big dark fixed and tucked towards 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.780
 back is to face the wind and 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:08.210
 the speed you can see it has the 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.399
 eyebrows very pronounced on the eyes and 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.860
 that kind of ridge acts like the 

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:16.460
 spoiler of a car very in friction 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:18.409
 of wind number 2 and equal 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.299
 important is that the eyes do not 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:22.460
 nostrils 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:25.700
 those holes that you see on the peak are 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.140
 the nostrils and the interesting thing is what 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.390
 what's inside them 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:33.950
 you will see that it has some yellow cones and 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:36.530
 fleshy in the cones is breaking the 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.750
 wind that hits the animal's face is 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:42.140
 when it reaches those speeds of 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:44.659
 vertigo without those cones that would explode 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.030
 the lungs but with them it can break 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:48.649
 the wind does not this technology does not 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.600
 limits to the peregrine falcons of 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:53.539
 fact has been adopted for the flight 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.759
 commercial is the same structure that is 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:57.800
 Go to the front of a jet engine 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:03.330
 front wide date 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:06.240
 number 3 your physical shape your body and your 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:08.040
 wings when this creature falls down 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.160
 during the flight when chasing a 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:13.650
 dam becomes practically a 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.730
 tear with feathers extremely 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:20.530
 efficient and aerodynamic when flying 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:23.980
 slip and fall 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:26.440
 towards the animal that wants to kill 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.569
 basically it's like a torpedo that 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:33.400
 it takes the life of a blow to the prey that 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:35.260
 is hunting in this case I think that 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.540
 that means it's time to try 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.430
 again and one of these lists are not 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.469
 we go cypecad for all 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:47.269
 ok she can not delay it anymore 

00:02:42.469 --> 00:02:48.850
 let's go back to the bridge let's go back to the jump 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:52.240
 agreement 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.240
 second try 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:03.040
 if I'm happy not a little bit 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.040
 nervous 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:17.230
 the bird is in position and I also 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:20.270
 the things that I came to do for you 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:22.160
 this is for the guys of the men and 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:24.260
 makes you change the white slips and 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.240
 tight-fitting or underwear for 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.220
 incontinence 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:31.170
 to which in attention everything begins the 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:34.110
 countdown wait 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:36.890
 wait 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:39.750
 wait 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:43.190
 white wait 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:46.120
 cool wait 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:46.120
 cool wait 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:53.240
 I have prepared , I have seen 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:18.100
 but no 

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:04.050
 wow 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:07.610
 good friends it has been amazing what has 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.610
 done spectacularly well 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:16.760
 the rush I'm falling almost to 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:20.510
 terminal velocity and suddenly as a 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:24.050
 combat fighter appears she disappears 

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:26.810
 the bait and with the greatest ease 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:29.330
 it's flying the piece of meat from that 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:34.270
 it was about action and speed at a level 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:34.270
 pilgrim end 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:41.460
 very well take this for you 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:47.979
 not that you can not eat it not though 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.539
 for us it is just a bag 

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:53.710
 full of brightly colored beans 

00:05:49.539 --> 00:05:55.770
 to show off is a prey the instinct 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:59.110
 it takes to plummet for it 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:03.509
 quick as a bullet and kill it in full 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:03.509
 flight has done it spectacularly 

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:07.800
 ready, Set, Go 

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:14.040
 It has been incredible as if it appeared 

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:14.040
 the nothing 

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:23.510
 or 

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:26.690
 and he has grabbed it as not also has 

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:29.930
 grabbed a little bit at me without wanting her 

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:32.450
 he knows that I 'm not part of his diet 

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:36.170
 its food chain but it is that it is 

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:38.960
 so involved in his role as a hunter and has 

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:41.090
 been an incredible journey an adventure 

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:43.970
 formidable in which we have studied 

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:46.870
 how animals use speed 

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:46.870
 to survive
