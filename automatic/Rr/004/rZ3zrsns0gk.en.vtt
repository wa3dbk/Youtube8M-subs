00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:07.200
 today we will learn how to install 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:11.429
 a minecraft server with or without bug 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.269
 who you are with hamachi good we will have 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.929
 three methods 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.640
 so first we'll see the method 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:19.890
 which is completely free is 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.359
 completely easy you go on the 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.279
 Serbian 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:24.060
 ww minecraft net point official slash 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.180
 download 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.340
 after you go download in aude 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.399
 minecraft that reigns down server points 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.930
 ex including 2,800 kb that I already have 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.300
 download as we can see 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.390
 right here 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:40.379
 here are more downloaded after that 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.000
 you do it you will create a 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.000
 folder new folder 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:53.039
 I know I 'm not created my kind 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:55.820
 hello to his games can rewrite to 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.320
 legs but I do not know how to write after 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:01.020
 what are you going to do? 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.789
 finally you will send the server you 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.880
 have uploaded to the folder 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.770
 you have to rename it in 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:09.479
 you're going to be famous for that but no 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.750
 you do not have to name it and then in 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.979
 does that throw it so that's fine 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.850
 do more a game so I 'm going to you 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.049
 explain what needs to be changed 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.329
 pec what it takes to change 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.250
 so while it's happening we take the 

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:22.289
 thing his ride ipes so that's the 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.549
 people who were betting paris p that 

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:26.069
 it's people who were born 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:29.189
 because of the water the opc the people who 

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:31.920
 are admitted to the administrators or 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:35.670
 modos and that's enough for log 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.409
 so that's the log of the server and its 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.750
 crate who knows he must lauper either with 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.819
 the notepad or be with our no 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.009
 more more than I advise you 

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:46.289
 Hollow notebook is simpler so 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.759
 that's what it's all about 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:50.569
 properties this is the configuration of the ca 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.890
 so what's going to change 

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:54.479
 that must be changed if you have a 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.869
 collection that is not good at all 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:01.860
 so that's the nether so if we can or 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:03.450
 not activate the breeder otherwise it must 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.489
 change his stuffed animal is not affected 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.719
 touched not panic his kids because 

00:02:05.489 --> 00:02:10.350
 that otherwise people will leave my 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:12.510
 theft is otherwise whitelist the sessions 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.920
 crazy this because finally it does not depend 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.420
 as a symbol of a video and you 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.380
 do you want to drive with anyone and that 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.010
 nobody needs to connect 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.840
 then you change the folk to choo and 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.150
 then you change the file that is there 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.769
 and you add the pseudo milk if we 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:31.340
 can directly do it from 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:33.739
 dc did had white list and and you put 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.280
 pseudo hacker fashion is when we 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:37.909
 logs 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:40.519
 we have some good so pvp what is it 

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:43.220
 these pv this pv player vs player 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:44.629
 so if you want friends 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.750
 kill each other I can kill you down 

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:48.829
 to leave you 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:52.239
 otherwise what does it really take 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:56.239
 change that's it I'm going to find 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:59.239
 here is online mode so everything must be left 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:02.420
 finally must the palace is actually so 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:03.859
 and play in crack like me must 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.840
 let's finally have to format it this 

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:08.269
 because if you leave it underneath 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.790
 it's the people who have the truth 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:12.379
 minecraft finally they bought they 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:16.519
 can easily connect its 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:22.299
 confession m usa not unique premium in itself the 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:22.299
 proof can modify dtf mode e messages 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:29.329
 that's why I did that to you and you 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.680
 save 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:33.500
 that's all that has changed not need 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:36.199
 of wire after to modify the same steals 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:38.000
 so after if you do not install a 

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:41.150
 internet dunks sign for you 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.919
 just change world by the name of the map 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.919
 and you put the name of the drive 

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:48.290
 so much the record here that's all so the 

00:03:45.919 --> 00:03:50.799
 flavors and young people so made having 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:53.629
 all the commands by typing right here 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:56.269
 all orders so you explain 

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:57.440
 not he marks in English and then if you 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:00.230
 do not understand 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.860
 google is your friend otherwise it's the 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:02.750
 mother of method 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:07.490
 so I will show you by testing 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:09.320
 directly I will go directly 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:12.220
 surely it's okay so how she and her 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:14.150
 so we have several choices 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:19.660
 firstly we can either use 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:23.410
 hamachi hamachi so here it is 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:27.650
 you download a hash so looked 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:29.240
 as you download hamachi I 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:32.930
 download hamachi I want to restore the 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:34.880
 thing is so it's going to make a network so 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.830
 the network can just make network created 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.210
 a network you download the pins you 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:40.400
 to the idea of not fashion network 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:42.350
 network and it's good to give it to your 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.690
 friends and then you can do it after 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:46.760
 for friends if you are not you have to 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:48.590
 have the ipv4 address copied to you 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.720
 give more can connect to 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:53.360
 condition that they are on the network so 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:55.280
 here you download it's free 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.380
 that's fine or else you will have to 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:00.230
 you not so there I let you look 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:01.639
 year earlier but just for you 

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:03.499
 help 

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:06.650
 if you have a box look first 

00:05:03.499 --> 00:05:07.849
 boxing there are marked ip and then you 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:10.969
 enter the pc 81 

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:12.740
 I do not know how much and after you 

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:14.990
 identify everything is marked below 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:17.400
 boxing or at worst if you have 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:22.290
 keep the manual 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:24.300
 it works too and them if not for 

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:26.310
 extend the knowledge you have to do this top 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:27.509
 but I will not do it again because 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:29.070
 that I'm going to show you that it works 

00:05:27.509 --> 00:05:32.280
 so the calvados 

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:32.669
 and that was still it's a 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:37.680
 other man 

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:41.130
 so you see it works the kallist to 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:43.680
 bg because in fact these releases I knew 

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:46.310
 keep but actually when you when 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:48.690
 you do that you always have to 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:49.949
 not a little hard to do but I had 

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:50.850
 already lens before I have to 

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:57.060
 raise for changes 

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:57.990
 be registered here it is good I 

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:01.289
 do not know why he created a new 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:03.620
 folder him that duplaix quickly and 

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:03.620
 tweetdeck 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:13.410
 it's ok 

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:13.410
 I'm standing here that's good there I tend 

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:24.569
 here 

00:06:18.689 --> 00:06:30.979
 I update I update this is localhost 

00:06:24.569 --> 00:06:35.039
 I run fucking angry that fucking 

00:06:30.979 --> 00:06:38.549
 sorry but that's my thing it's my 

00:06:35.039 --> 00:06:41.159
 ordi bugs like a foot if i can say 

00:06:38.549 --> 00:06:42.449
 his voice the ongoing densification and 

00:06:41.159 --> 00:06:45.599
 I managed to connect 

00:06:42.449 --> 00:06:49.699
 so if you would make me weird and I'm 

00:06:45.599 --> 00:06:51.959
 Too much I punctured, however, I have water 

00:06:49.699 --> 00:06:54.539
 so just to show you that already 

00:06:51.959 --> 00:06:58.289
 walk so as I wanted said it must 

00:06:54.539 --> 00:07:02.219
 just do it when I told you so 

00:06:58.289 --> 00:07:04.469
 what is system abdou throw this map 

00:07:02.219 --> 00:07:06.300
 so here's to show you who's walking 

00:07:04.469 --> 00:07:08.129
 and that of course the thing what I did 

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:11.849
 they walk looked at it works 

00:07:08.129 --> 00:07:13.800
 So here we are going to stop that and we're going 

00:07:11.849 --> 00:07:17.369
 already go to step 

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:18.659
 finally the stage of good for the stage of this 

00:07:17.369 --> 00:07:19.049
 would be in the second part of 

00:07:18.659 --> 00:07:21.119
 videos 

00:07:19.049 --> 00:07:24.029
 so there will be two wickets to 

00:07:21.119 --> 00:07:25.919
 minecraft words and minecraft down so mo 

00:07:24.029 --> 00:07:28.349
 for the version that I do not show you 

00:07:25.919 --> 00:07:30.329
 and beats for version 2 so leaves 

00:07:28.349 --> 00:07:32.459
 go to the in the other video 

00:07:30.329 --> 00:07:37.550
