a pencil brush from Sigma right into my
and<00:02:11.170> then<00:02:11.770> I'm<00:02:11.980> going<00:02:12.310> to<00:02:12.340> blend<00:02:12.730> out<00:02:13.390> those

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
and then I'm going to blend out those

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.030 
and then I'm going to blend out those
eyeshadows<00:02:16.080> using<00:02:17.080> the<00:02:17.200> lighter<00:02:17.410> color<00:02:17.709> first

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
eyeshadows using the lighter color first

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.729 
eyeshadows using the lighter color first
helps<00:02:18.640> you<00:02:18.819> with<00:02:19.060> your<00:02:19.239> blending<00:02:19.720> because<00:02:20.170> it

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
helps you with your blending because it

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:24.300 
helps you with your blending because it
just<00:02:21.400> gives<00:02:21.970> that<00:02:22.180> false<00:02:22.810> impression<00:02:23.709> of<00:02:23.860> what

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
just gives that false impression of what

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.729 
just gives that false impression of what
it<00:02:24.459> would<00:02:24.580> look<00:02:24.819> like<00:02:24.930> blend<00:02:25.930> it<00:02:26.080> out<00:02:26.230> anyway

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
it would look like blend it out anyway

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:28.680 
it would look like blend it out anyway
so<00:02:26.770> it<00:02:27.190> just<00:02:27.400> kind<00:02:27.790> of<00:02:27.849> helps<00:02:28.000> out<00:02:28.300> with<00:02:28.569> the

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
so it just kind of helps out with the

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:34.620 
so it just kind of helps out with the
whole<00:02:28.870> blending<00:02:29.380> process<00:02:31.380> and<00:02:33.269> this<00:02:34.269> is<00:02:34.330> what

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
whole blending process and this is what

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.930 
whole blending process and this is what
you<00:02:34.810> should<00:02:35.050> have<00:02:35.290> at<00:02:35.440> the<00:02:35.560> end<00:02:35.830> so<00:02:36.550> now<00:02:36.760> we're

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
you should have at the end so now we're

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.390 
you should have at the end so now we're
going<00:02:37.120> to<00:02:37.239> move<00:02:37.510> into<00:02:37.780> our<00:02:38.200> inner<00:02:38.739> corners<00:02:39.220> and
