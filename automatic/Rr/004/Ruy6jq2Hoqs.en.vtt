more in-depth manual of everything um
here's<00:02:20.670> the<00:02:20.730> firewire<00:02:21.660> 800<00:02:22.110> to<00:02:22.530> 400<00:02:22.770> cord<00:02:23.370> so

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
here's the firewire 800 to 400 cord so

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.410 
here's the firewire 800 to 400 cord so
if<00:02:24.480> you<00:02:24.780> don't<00:02:25.110> like<00:02:25.260> on<00:02:25.650> Mike<00:02:26.040> my<00:02:26.490> macbook<00:02:27.000> it

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
if you don't like on Mike my macbook it

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.230 
if you don't like on Mike my macbook it
only<00:02:27.630> has<00:02:27.840> a<00:02:27.870> firewire<00:02:28.410> 400<00:02:29.220> port<00:02:29.700> here's<00:02:30.180> the

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
only has a firewire 400 port here's the

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.590 
only has a firewire 400 port here's the
400<00:02:30.810> part<00:02:31.050> here's<00:02:31.620> 800<00:02:32.190> on<00:02:32.550> the<00:02:32.910> actual<00:02:33.210> device

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
400 part here's 800 on the actual device

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.030 
400 part here's 800 on the actual device
it<00:02:34.020> has<00:02:35.060> the<00:02:36.060> firewire<00:02:36.420> 800<00:02:36.660> port<00:02:37.260> so<00:02:37.710> that's

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
it has the firewire 800 port so that's

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.070 
it has the firewire 800 port so that's
why<00:02:38.190> the<00:02:38.250> cable<00:02:38.580> goes<00:02:38.730> from<00:02:38.880> 800<00:02:39.360> to<00:02:39.420> 400<00:02:39.660> and

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
why the cable goes from 800 to 400 and

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.980 
why the cable goes from 800 to 400 and
then<00:02:40.410> you<00:02:40.500> have<00:02:40.650> your<00:02:40.680> mini<00:02:41.100> USB<00:02:41.510> right<00:02:42.510> here

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
then you have your mini USB right here

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:44.930 
then you have your mini USB right here
is<00:02:43.140> where<00:02:43.170> the<00:02:43.590> illuminated<00:02:44.280> lights<00:02:44.459> are<00:02:44.640> and

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
is where the illuminated lights are and

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.370 
is where the illuminated lights are and
this<00:02:45.120> slides<00:02:45.480> over<00:02:45.840> to<00:02:45.959> protect<00:02:46.530> the

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
this slides over to protect the

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:55.220 
this slides over to protect the
protectee<00:02:52.400> ports<00:02:53.660> it's<00:02:54.660> kind<00:02:54.900> of<00:02:54.990> hard<00:02:55.200> to

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
protectee ports it's kind of hard to

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.070 
protectee ports it's kind of hard to
slide<00:02:55.620> right<00:02:56.370> now<00:02:56.760> I<00:02:56.790> don't<00:02:56.910> have<00:02:57.120> like<00:02:57.330> really

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
use so there's no AC power so you can

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.190 
use so there's no AC power so you can
take<00:04:35.730> this<00:04:35.880> like<00:04:36.090> on<00:04:36.360> an<00:04:36.510> airplane<00:04:36.840> and<00:04:36.930> you

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:37.200 
take this like on an airplane and you

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.260 
take this like on an airplane and you
don't<00:04:37.380> have<00:04:37.560> to<00:04:37.710> have<00:04:37.830> that<00:04:38.010> adapter<00:04:38.580> which<00:04:39.090> is

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
little comparison of size and i'm going

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:50.630 
little comparison of size and i'm going
to<00:04:47.250> show<00:04:47.550> you<00:04:47.750> here's<00:04:48.750> the<00:04:49.190> western<00:04:50.190> digital

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:01.230 
samsung alias phone so if you want to

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:04.040 
samsung alias phone so if you want to
compare<00:05:01.380> this<00:05:01.650> in<00:05:01.800> thickness<00:05:02.280> which<00:05:02.940> it<00:05:03.240> is<00:05:03.900> a

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
compare this in thickness which it is a

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:05.930 
compare this in thickness which it is a
fair<00:05:04.320> comparison<00:05:04.650> because<00:05:05.010> this<00:05:05.220> is<00:05:05.400> 500

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940 
fair comparison because this is 500

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.600 
fair comparison because this is 500
gigabytes<00:05:06.330> and<00:05:06.480> this<00:05:06.780> is<00:05:06.930> 500<00:05:07.380> gigabytes<00:05:07.770> so

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:08.610 
gigabytes and this is 500 gigabytes so

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.150 
gigabytes and this is 500 gigabytes so
it's<00:05:08.940> not<00:05:09.120> like<00:05:09.470> it's<00:05:10.470> that<00:05:10.590> big<00:05:11.010> of<00:05:11.070> a

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:11.160 
it's not like it's that big of a

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.940 
it's not like it's that big of a
difference<00:05:12.020> but<00:05:13.020> yeah<00:05:13.170> this<00:05:13.380> is<00:05:13.470> incredibly

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:13.950 
difference but yeah this is incredibly

it's about the same thickness as a

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:01.220 
it's about the same thickness as a
regular<00:05:58.110> flip<00:05:58.410> phone<00:05:59.150> but<00:06:00.150> yeah<00:06:00.330> and<00:06:00.570> so<00:06:01.200> now

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:11.640 
here if i were to rate the my passport

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:15.680 
here if i were to rate the my passport
studio<00:06:12.120> i<00:06:12.690> think<00:06:13.500> i'd<00:06:13.590> give<00:06:13.830> it<00:06:13.860> may<00:06:14.130> be<00:06:14.210> a<00:06:15.210> 4

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:15.690 
studio i think i'd give it may be a 4

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:18.650 
studio i think i'd give it may be a 4
out<00:06:15.810> of<00:06:15.840> 5<00:06:16.080> I<00:06:16.380> think<00:06:16.760> that's<00:06:17.760> fair<00:06:18.030> because<00:06:18.240> it

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:18.660 
out of 5 I think that's fair because it

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:20.900 
out of 5 I think that's fair because it
doesn't<00:06:18.930> have<00:06:18.960> any<00:06:19.260> like<00:06:19.770> good<00:06:20.430> software

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:20.910 
doesn't have any like good software

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:22.370 
doesn't have any like good software
because<00:06:21.210> I'd<00:06:21.360> really<00:06:21.630> love<00:06:21.870> to<00:06:21.930> have<00:06:22.170> the

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:22.380 
because I'd really love to have the

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:25.520 
because I'd really love to have the
remote<00:06:22.680> access<00:06:23.340> and<00:06:23.610> the<00:06:23.720> backup<00:06:24.720> in<00:06:25.170> the<00:06:25.290> sink

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:25.530 
remote access and the backup in the sink

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:28.130 
remote access and the backup in the sink
and<00:06:25.620> encryption<00:06:26.240> that'd<00:06:27.240> be<00:06:27.270> great<00:06:27.660> features

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:28.140 
and encryption that'd be great features

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:30.560 
and encryption that'd be great features
to<00:06:28.260> have<00:06:28.470> on<00:06:28.680> it<00:06:28.860> because<00:06:29.640> I'm<00:06:29.790> paying<00:06:30.090> even

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:30.570 
to have on it because I'm paying even

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:32.420 
to have on it because I'm paying even
more<00:06:30.960> than<00:06:31.080> the<00:06:31.230> live<00:06:31.500> version<00:06:31.710> but<00:06:32.070> it<00:06:32.220> does

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:32.430 
more than the live version but it does

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:35.090 
more than the live version but it does
