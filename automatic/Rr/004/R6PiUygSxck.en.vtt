00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
balls I think it's a such a good skill

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.649 
balls I think it's a such a good skill
to<00:01:17.130> be<00:01:17.400> able<00:01:17.460> to<00:01:17.580> take<00:01:17.700> a<00:01:17.729> ball<00:01:17.970> in<00:01:18.150> there<00:01:18.360> and

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
to be able to take a ball in there and

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.990 
to be able to take a ball in there and
they're<00:01:19.140> very<00:01:19.170> brave<00:01:19.500> I<00:01:19.680> was<00:01:19.770> suing<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.189> you

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
they're very brave I was suing the you

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.240 
they're very brave I was suing the you
know<00:01:21.060> but<00:01:21.270> collisions<00:01:21.689> is<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:22.020> no<00:01:24.259> I<00:01:25.259> think

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
know but collisions is the no I think

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.920 
know but collisions is the no I think
it's<00:01:26.820> one<00:01:26.939> of<00:01:27.000> those<00:01:27.060> things<00:01:27.270> it's<00:01:27.390> crumbling

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
it's one of those things it's crumbling
