that later okay so let's get started one
end<00:00:23.070> off<00:00:23.279> and<00:00:23.730> the<00:00:24.029> other<00:00:24.180> end<00:00:24.480> off<00:00:24.689> and<00:00:25.050> then

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
end off and the other end off and then

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.679 
end off and the other end off and then
you<00:00:26.099> have<00:00:26.250> to<00:00:26.400> make<00:00:26.580> a<00:00:26.609> shallow<00:00:27.029> cut<00:00:27.210> right

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
you have to make a shallow cut right

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.950 
you have to make a shallow cut right
along<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:28.170> ridge<00:00:28.410> like<00:00:28.980> so<00:00:29.279> right<00:00:29.519> here

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:29.960 
along the ridge like so right here

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.359 
along the ridge like so right here
here's<00:00:30.960> another<00:00:31.050> Ridge<00:00:31.560> right<00:00:31.830> here<00:00:31.890> reach

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
here's another Ridge right here reach

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.970 
here's another Ridge right here reach
number<00:00:32.730> two<00:00:32.940> and<00:00:33.930> finally<00:00:34.290> rich<00:00:35.010> number<00:00:35.460> three

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:36.980 
number two and finally rich number three

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.150 
number two and finally rich number three
so<00:00:37.980> let's<00:00:38.489> cut<00:00:38.760> off<00:00:39.320> one<00:00:40.320> end<00:00:40.350> with<00:00:40.739> a<00:00:40.770> small

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
so let's cut off one end with a small

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.450 
so let's cut off one end with a small
knife<00:00:41.430> like<00:00:42.059> so

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460

put<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.210> other<00:00:45.360> end<00:00:45.480> off<00:00:45.899> now<00:00:47.750> and<00:00:48.750> then<00:00:48.870> take

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
put the other end off now and then take

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.959 
put the other end off now and then take
the<00:00:49.290> point<00:00:49.500> of<00:00:49.680> your<00:00:49.770> knife<00:00:49.829> and<00:00:50.309> hold<00:00:50.579> it<00:00:50.760> to

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
one of the ridges like so being very

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.850 
one of the ridges like so being very
careful<00:00:57.570> not<00:00:57.870> to<00:00:57.930> cut<00:00:58.079> yourself

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.220 
okay here goes the next Ridge fold the

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.470 
okay here goes the next Ridge fold the
point<00:01:04.520> down<00:01:05.500> okay<00:01:06.730> making<00:01:07.730> a<00:01:07.970> very<00:01:08.150> shallow

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:08.480 
point down okay making a very shallow

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.460 
point down okay making a very shallow

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
little bit more until finally the panel

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.660 
little bit more until finally the panel
is<00:01:33.590> going<00:01:34.340> to<00:01:34.430> come<00:01:34.640> off<00:01:34.850> just<00:01:34.880> like<00:01:35.450> that<00:01:35.720> see

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
is going to come off just like that see

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.030 
is going to come off just like that see
okay<00:01:37.670> let's<00:01:37.880> let's<00:01:38.240> do<00:01:38.390> another<00:01:38.540> panel<00:01:39.140> we

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 
okay let's let's do another panel we

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.970 
okay let's let's do another panel we
find<00:01:40.070> a<00:01:40.430> little<00:01:40.580> opening<00:01:41.150> get<00:01:41.930> the<00:01:42.110> finger<00:01:42.830> in

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:42.980 
find a little opening get the finger in

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:43.840 
find a little opening get the finger in
there<00:01:43.220> a<00:01:43.250> little<00:01:43.430> bit

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
there a little bit

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.030 
there a little bit
and<00:01:43.940> then<00:01:44.690> just<00:01:44.960> run<00:01:45.170> your<00:01:45.320> finger<00:01:45.619> back<00:01:45.800> and

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
forth like so each time going a little

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.460 
forth like so each time going a little
bit<00:01:49.190> deeper<00:01:49.250> and<00:01:49.700> a<00:01:50.030> little<00:01:50.060> bit<00:01:50.420> deeper<00:01:50.810> don't

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
bit deeper and a little bit deeper don't

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.620 
bit deeper and a little bit deeper don't
try<00:01:51.680> to<00:01:51.740> get<00:01:51.979> too<00:01:52.280> much<00:01:52.490> at<00:01:52.760> one<00:01:53.030> time<00:01:53.060> and

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
try to get too much at one time and

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.560 
try to get too much at one time and
there<00:01:54.380> you<00:01:54.530> go<00:01:54.740> see<00:01:55.070> there's<00:01:55.760> a<00:01:55.880> panel<00:01:56.360> and

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
there you go see there's a panel and

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.070 
there you go see there's a panel and
let's<00:01:57.229> go<00:01:57.410> for<00:01:57.680> the<00:01:57.770> last<00:01:57.979> one<00:01:58.280> now<00:01:58.600> see<00:01:59.600> back

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.080 
let's go for the last one now see back

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.830 
let's go for the last one now see back
and<00:02:00.350> forth<00:02:00.619> just<00:02:01.430> a<00:02:01.580> little<00:02:01.910> just<00:02:02.270> a<00:02:02.479> little

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
and forth just a little just a little

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.190 
and forth just a little just a little
not<00:02:03.259> too<00:02:03.530> much<00:02:04.000> they<00:02:05.000> won't<00:02:05.240> break<00:02:05.600> if<00:02:05.869> you<00:02:05.900> do

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
not too much they won't break if you do

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.010 
not too much they won't break if you do
that<00:02:06.410> and<00:02:07.160> there<00:02:07.430> it<00:02:07.550> is<00:02:07.610> now<00:02:08.540> depending<00:02:08.959> on

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 
that and there it is now depending on
