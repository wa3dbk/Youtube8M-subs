well<00:00:49.690> I<00:00:49.870> mean<00:00:50.110> that<00:00:51.010> was<00:00:51.129> it<00:00:51.280> really<00:00:51.580> actually

00:00:51.689 --> 00:00:51.699 
well I mean that was it really actually

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:54.140 
well I mean that was it really actually
I<00:00:52.150> kind<00:00:52.839> of<00:00:52.900> liked<00:00:53.110> the<00:00:53.290> idea<00:00:53.379> of<00:00:53.559> playing<00:00:53.860> a

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:54.150 
I kind of liked the idea of playing a

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.270 
I kind of liked the idea of playing a
mafia<00:00:55.150> gangster<00:00:55.449> guy<00:00:55.809> okay<00:00:56.320> I<00:00:56.559> just<00:00:57.040> wasn't

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:57.280 
mafia gangster guy okay I just wasn't

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.490 
mafia gangster guy okay I just wasn't
sure<00:00:57.430> whether<00:00:57.790> I<00:00:57.909> could<00:00:58.030> do<00:00:58.360> a<00:00:58.390> Mumbai<00:00:59.049> version

00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.500 
sure whether I could do a Mumbai version

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.380 
sure whether I could do a Mumbai version
because<00:00:59.979> it's<00:01:00.519> something<00:01:00.670> that<00:01:00.879> concerns<00:01:01.299> me

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.390 
because it's something that concerns me

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.350 
because it's something that concerns me
slightly<00:01:01.659> of<00:01:01.989> playing<00:01:02.619> like<00:01:02.890> a<00:01:02.920> top<00:01:03.820> or<00:01:03.970> a<00:01:04.030> type

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
slightly of playing like a top or a type

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.149 
slightly of playing like a top or a type
right<00:01:04.720> I<00:01:04.960> don't<00:01:05.409> think<00:01:05.470> that'd<00:01:05.740> be<00:01:05.890> greater

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:06.159 
right I don't think that'd be greater

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:08.670 
right I don't think that'd be greater
that<00:01:06.400> even<00:01:06.670> though<00:01:07.200> that's<00:01:08.200> what<00:01:08.350> acting<00:01:08.650> is

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680 
that even though that's what acting is

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.200 
that even though that's what acting is
meant<00:01:08.920> to<00:01:09.010> be<00:01:09.040> lucky<00:01:09.520> to<00:01:09.640> challenge<00:01:10.090> yourself

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.210 
meant to be lucky to challenge yourself

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.890 
meant to be lucky to challenge yourself

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:13.900 
but a northern dialect somehow seemed

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.470

but it's not that every time i've done
it<00:01:58.090> is<00:01:58.210> great<00:01:58.390> i<00:01:58.420> think<00:01:58.690> the<00:01:58.750> only<00:01:58.870> other<00:01:59.080> time

00:01:59.250 --> 00:01:59.260 
it is great i think the only other time

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.140 
it is great i think the only other time
I've<00:01:59.470> really<00:01:59.500> done<00:01:59.860> it<00:02:00.040> is<00:02:00.159> is<00:02:00.340> in<00:02:00.700> home<00:02:00.850> cara

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:03.190 
right but this is different because this

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.460
