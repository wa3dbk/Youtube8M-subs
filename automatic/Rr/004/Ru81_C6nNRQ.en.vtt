00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 At first we decided the podium 

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:07.510
 And this time it's strange 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.349
 Kaori Hatsuzawa 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:35.810
 Old Calendar 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.070
 For the first victory in two years 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.070
 Kim Younga's free performance starts 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.890
 Nisshin Maru crew 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.590
 Becoming a ball in the program 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.780
 A man living in a rural area invades 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:17.980
 next 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:20.980
 2225 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.040
 First half 9 minutes 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.040
 0703 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.980
 I am really looking forward to it 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.240
 Maruyama University ranked 76th 

00:02:39.889 --> 00:02:42.889
 I am a senator 

00:02:58.839 --> 00:02:59.919
 Avian influenza 

00:02:59.919 --> 00:03:01.759
 Anyway disk 

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:04.759
 People of the people too 

00:03:07.809 --> 00:03:11.609
 I have divided the tourists for many years now 

00:05:19.089 --> 00:05:22.089
 Public finance is becoming severe 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:29.860
 Even so, diastolic blood pressure is established 

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:34.659
 There was not 

00:05:47.599 --> 00:05:50.129
 pc2007- 

00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:53.400
 It is not too difficult to continue 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:56.900
 We are thinking of contributing to the realization of Chongqing City 

00:05:58.229 --> 00:05:59.520
 By having gone the other day 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:02.520
 I'm here 

00:06:05.619 --> 00:06:07.150
 Yes 

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:08.960
 Did not cool 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:10.430
 Next spring center exam 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:12.309
 I have left as a prefecture 

00:06:12.309 --> 00:06:13.289
 I was at a stretch 

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:16.289
 I want to go to the poll 

00:06:17.309 --> 00:06:18.460
 This season's plan is also 

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:21.319
 Mr. Arakawa also mentioned later, but making a mistake here 

00:06:21.319 --> 00:06:25.160
 If you think of the Olympics as a real show 

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.050
 It may be a good thing 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:31.740
 It is moved to the same facility, and it is mixed wave of employee's welfare radio wave 75

 Koranji's Takai taxi modernization 

00:06:35.069 --> 00:06:38.069
 I think it will be a good experience 

00:06:40.969 --> 00:06:42.989
 Why does the Olympic Games come on a regular basis? 

00:06:42.989 --> 00:06:45.990
 It's not so I concentrate on when I can't connect in a day 

00:06:45.989 --> 00:06:49.289
 I will do everything I can to do 

00:06:49.289 --> 00:06:51.379
 In 2007 

00:06:51.379 --> 00:06:54.389
 Such an impression that it was a step before the Olympics 

00:06:54.389 --> 00:06:57.800
 There is, but this does not understand a little 

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:00.800
 It is now decided 18 days 

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:07.189

 Called 258 Horie, the main player in France 

00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:14.639
 It is said that we have marked the world's highest score 

00:07:15.449 --> 00:07:16.729
 It is this problem 

00:07:16.729 --> 00:07:19.990
 I was unable to show my perfect performance, and I went up for 21 days 

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:21.619
 The first few days ago 

00:07:21.619 --> 00:07:25.529
 Naturally every time you move about, you're at a loss 

00:07:25.529 --> 00:07:28.529
 Only one game 

00:07:33.969 --> 00:07:37.430
 Since 

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:38.830
 Until that time 

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:41.830
 One question one answer 

00:07:52.559 --> 00:07:53.789
 US frb chairman 

00:07:53.789 --> 00:07:54.729
 Flat 

00:07:54.729 --> 00:07:57.099
 There is only one person left 

00:07:57.099 --> 00:07:59.469
 I do not know yet what kind of result will be
