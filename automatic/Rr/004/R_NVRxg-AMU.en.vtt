00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:15.619
 following design we will make magnolia 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:19.320
 magnolia that blooms in full bloom 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:20.789
 means how does a similar background 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.330
 tv and newbie under painting 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:27.650
 detailed on the disk 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:31.800
 art painting step 2 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:34.100
 so first before drawing 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.890
 Magnolias we need to label 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:40.950
 branches drove that is where we will have 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:45.750
 arranged themselves flowers for twigs 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:52.340
 we take black paint naturally 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:56.879
 Well dilute it with water to 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:58.230
 we have a little paint and draw 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.859
 directly themselves 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:09.210
 twigs twig we start from the edge 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:11.970
 tips on all these branches we will have 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:15.890
 each twig florets 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.890
 out of the previous 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:58.570
 these are the branches we have on 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:02:02.560
 our background further we draw magician 000 and 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:07.060
 usually in principle on white and pink 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:12.730
 white purple white we will draw 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:16.200
 so white violet means therefore to us 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.200
 need white paint 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.770
 and 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.980
 dark purple like this
