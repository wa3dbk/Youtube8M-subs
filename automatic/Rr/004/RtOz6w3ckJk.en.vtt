00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
points to where they could rank up to be

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.180 
points to where they could rank up to be
class<00:03:03.120> and<00:03:03.330> so<00:03:03.450> forth<00:03:03.690> so<00:03:03.900> on<00:03:04.110> we<00:03:04.530> also<00:03:04.560> find

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
class and so forth so on we also find

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:06.920 
class and so forth so on we also find
out<00:03:05.430> that<00:03:05.459> other<00:03:05.850> classes<00:03:06.209> can<00:03:06.630> you<00:03:06.750> know<00:03:06.870> try

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
out that other classes can you know try

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.509 
out that other classes can you know try
to<00:03:07.140> go<00:03:07.320> into<00:03:07.500> the<00:03:07.590> SI<00:03:07.800> rankings<00:03:08.250> but<00:03:08.400> they

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
to go into the SI rankings but they

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:10.370 
to go into the SI rankings but they
cannot<00:03:08.820> fight<00:03:09.120> for<00:03:09.150> points<00:03:09.720> they<00:03:10.050> can<00:03:10.230> use

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
cannot fight for points they can use

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.979 
cannot fight for points they can use
this<00:03:10.590> system<00:03:10.860> for<00:03:11.310> practice<00:03:12.209> test<00:03:12.510> and<00:03:12.720> stuff

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
this system for practice test and stuff

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:13.699 
this system for practice test and stuff
like<00:03:13.200> that

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
like that

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:16.040 
like that
so<00:03:14.010> to<00:03:14.070> see<00:03:14.370> how<00:03:14.580> we<00:03:14.640> have<00:03:15.030> battles<00:03:15.720> with<00:03:15.930> these

so to see how we have battles with these

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:17.630 
so to see how we have battles with these
other<00:03:16.230> classes<00:03:16.800> and<00:03:16.980> stuff<00:03:17.130> like<00:03:17.310> that<00:03:17.489> it's

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.569 
off at the beginning part of this
episode<00:03:39.870> but<00:03:40.620> that's<00:03:40.829> pretty<00:03:41.130> much<00:03:41.370> the

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
episode but that's pretty much the

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:44.150 
episode but that's pretty much the
episode<00:03:42.030> like<00:03:42.209> the<00:03:42.329> episode<00:03:42.780> is<00:03:43.019> very<00:03:43.160> simple
