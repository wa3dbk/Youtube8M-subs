00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:01.499 
the steps so that it makes it difficult
for<00:01:59.979> enemies<00:02:00.429> to<00:02:00.579> kill<00:02:00.789> you<00:02:00.999> then<00:02:01.389> I'll

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.509 
for enemies to kill you then I'll

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:03.330 
for enemies to kill you then I'll
quickly<00:02:01.689> check<00:02:02.109> the<00:02:02.229> spawns<00:02:02.560> I<00:02:02.799> just<00:02:03.130> showed

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
quickly check the spawns I just showed

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.149 
quickly check the spawns I just showed
you<00:02:03.369> yes<00:02:04.119> they<00:02:04.389> will<00:02:04.659> spawn<00:02:05.229> by<00:02:05.469> hot<00:02:05.679> dog<00:02:05.889> most

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159 
you yes they will spawn by hot dog most

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:07.980 
you yes they will spawn by hot dog most
likely<00:02:06.639> in<00:02:06.819> free-for-all<00:02:07.329> so<00:02:07.569> always<00:02:07.810> check

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
likely in free-for-all so always check

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:09.779 
likely in free-for-all so always check
your<00:02:08.319> back<00:02:08.500> every<00:02:08.890> time<00:02:09.100> you<00:02:09.250> see<00:02:09.429> someone

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
your back every time you see someone

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:12.240 
your back every time you see someone
down<00:02:09.910> your<00:02:10.179> kill<00:02:10.390> feed<00:02:10.630> this<00:02:10.990> is<00:02:11.250> important

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
down your kill feed this is important

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.400 
down your kill feed this is important
and<00:02:12.459> this<00:02:12.910> is<00:02:12.970> also<00:02:13.510> the<00:02:13.810> same<00:02:14.050> for<00:02:14.080> when

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
and this is also the same for when

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.440

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
the kill feed and then check every

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.670 
the kill feed and then check every

the<00:02:46.920> C<00:02:47.160> flag<00:02:47.490> then<00:02:47.700> you<00:02:47.820> would<00:02:47.970> hold<00:02:48.180> down

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
the C flag then you would hold down

is<00:03:40.560> easy<00:03:41.040> to<00:03:41.280> do<00:03:41.489> if<00:03:41.730> they're<00:03:41.940> noobs<00:03:42.239> because

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
is easy to do if they're noobs because

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.449 
is easy to do if they're noobs because
they<00:03:42.870> won't<00:03:43.110> expect<00:03:43.380> enemies<00:03:43.950> to<00:03:44.100> come<00:03:44.310> from
