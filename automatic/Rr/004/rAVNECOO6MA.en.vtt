road<00:00:21.810> now<00:00:22.619> right<00:00:22.859> now<00:00:22.980> have<00:00:23.160> my<00:00:23.310> air<00:00:23.430> condition

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
road now right now have my air condition

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.400 
road now right now have my air condition
turned<00:00:23.970> on<00:00:24.150> and<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.630> reason<00:00:24.750> why<00:00:24.990> I<00:00:25.019> mentioned

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
turned on and the reason why I mentioned

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.570 
turned on and the reason why I mentioned
the<00:00:25.500> air<00:00:25.619> condition<00:00:25.980> is<00:00:26.070> because<00:00:26.340> it<00:00:26.430> does

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
the air condition is because it does

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.189 
the air condition is because it does
make<00:00:26.820> a<00:00:26.849> difference<00:00:27.300> on<00:00:27.539> your<00:00:27.930> miles<00:00:28.109> per

vehicle's calculations right now we're

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.459 
vehicle's calculations right now we're
at<00:00:32.219> about<00:00:32.279> 51<00:00:33.000> miles<00:00:33.239> to<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.510> gallon<00:00:33.690> 52<00:00:34.260> or

at about 51 miles to the gallon 52 or
before<00:00:34.829> heading<00:00:35.070> or<00:00:35.309> staying<00:00:35.880> pretty<00:00:36.090> steady

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
before heading or staying pretty steady

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.540 
before heading or staying pretty steady
at<00:00:36.450> that<00:00:36.630> I'm<00:00:37.079> going<00:00:37.380> to<00:00:37.410> turn<00:00:38.100> off<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.430> air

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
at that I'm going to turn off the air

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.520 
at that I'm going to turn off the air
condition<00:00:38.969> right<00:00:39.510> now<00:00:39.570> my<00:00:39.809> chest<00:00:40.079> turned<00:00:40.410> it

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
condition right now my chest turned it

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.160 
condition right now my chest turned it
off<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:40.950> we<00:00:41.489> should<00:00:41.670> see<00:00:41.820> that<00:00:41.850> number<00:00:42.180> change

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
off and we should see that number change

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.709 
off and we should see that number change
and<00:00:43.500> not<00:00:43.649> for<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.040> better<00:00:44.160> of<00:00:44.340> course<00:00:44.719> right

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
and not for the better of course right

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.720 
and not for the better of course right
now<00:00:45.840> where<00:00:46.079> it's<00:00:46.200> more<00:00:46.649> at<00:00:46.739> 58<00:00:47.219> miles<00:00:47.460> to<00:00:47.670> the

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
now where it's more at 58 miles to the

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.729 
now where it's more at 58 miles to the
gallon<00:00:48.050> the<00:00:49.050> only<00:00:49.200> thing<00:00:49.289> is<00:00:49.379> right<00:00:49.530> now<00:00:49.680> we

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
gallon the only thing is right now we

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.840 
gallon the only thing is right now we
are<00:00:50.010> on<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.280> turn<00:00:51.649> I'm<00:00:52.649> gonna<00:00:52.860> let<00:00:53.010> this<00:00:53.190> turn

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
are on a turn I'm gonna let this turn

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.970 
are on a turn I'm gonna let this turn
kind<00:00:54.090> of<00:00:54.149> go<00:00:54.270> up<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.719> road<00:00:54.899> still<00:00:55.170> is<00:00:55.350> flat<00:00:55.680> but

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
kind of go up the road still is flat but

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.340 
kind of go up the road still is flat but
we<00:00:56.219> still<00:00:56.579> should<00:00:56.850> see<00:00:57.120> an<00:00:57.719> improvement<00:00:58.199> on

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
we still should see an improvement on

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.450 
we still should see an improvement on
the<00:00:58.410> miles<00:00:58.620> per<00:00:58.800> gallon<00:00:59.100> with<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.340> air

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
the miles per gallon with the air

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.220 
the miles per gallon with the air
condition<00:00:59.820> turned<00:01:00.000> off<00:01:00.180> and<00:01:00.480> at<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.989> same

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
condition turned off and at the same

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:10.219 
condition turned off and at the same
speed

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.170 

so<00:01:10.799> right<00:01:10.920> here<00:01:11.009> we're<00:01:11.189> holding<00:01:12.030> pretty

so right here we're holding pretty
steady<00:01:12.270> at<00:01:12.539> about<00:01:12.630> 65<00:01:13.350> 70<00:01:13.770> and<00:01:14.630> again<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:16.049> road

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
steady at about 65 70 and again the road

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.760 
steady at about 65 70 and again the road

turned off I do have a turn coming up so
just<00:01:58.240> give<00:01:58.420> me<00:01:58.540> a<00:01:58.650> brief<00:01:59.650> second<00:02:00.100> here<00:02:01.380> should

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
just give me a brief second here should

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:08.960 
just give me a brief second here should
be<00:02:02.530> no<00:02:02.650> more<00:02:02.830> than<00:02:02.920> 15<00:02:03.250> seconds

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.190 

and<00:02:09.240> we're<00:02:09.479> just<00:02:09.540> gonna<00:02:09.720> climb<00:02:09.900> up<00:02:09.960> to<00:02:10.170> a

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
and we're just gonna climb up to a

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.660 
and we're just gonna climb up to a
higher<00:02:10.440> rate

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
higher rate

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.830 
higher rate
and<00:02:12.150> I<00:02:12.210> set<00:02:12.390> our<00:02:12.480> cruise<00:02:12.630> control<00:02:12.930> at<00:02:13.050> 55<00:02:14.840> here

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
and I set our cruise control at 55 here

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.130 
and I set our cruise control at 55 here
we<00:02:15.930> go

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
we go

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.350 
we go
so<00:02:17.680> the<00:02:17.830> road<00:02:17.980> is<00:02:18.010> flat<00:02:18.370> we're<00:02:18.760> at<00:02:18.820> about<00:02:18.910> 56

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
so the road is flat we're at about 56

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.900 
so the road is flat we're at about 56
miles<00:02:19.570> per<00:02:19.690> hour<00:02:19.900> to<00:02:20.170> see<00:02:20.380> how<00:02:20.830> our<00:02:21.130> miles<00:02:21.700> per

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
miles per hour to see how our miles per

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.590 
miles per hour to see how our miles per
gallon<00:02:22.180> performance<00:02:22.600> works<00:02:24.240> we're<00:02:25.240> still<00:02:25.510> at

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
gallon performance works we're still at

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:30.600 
gallon performance works we're still at
about<00:02:25.810> 70<00:02:26.350> miles<00:02:26.500> to<00:02:26.680> the<00:02:26.770> gallon

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.200 

going<00:02:31.300> down<00:02:31.450> just<00:02:31.720> slightly<00:02:32.790> but<00:02:33.790> as<00:02:34.000> you

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.210 
going down just slightly but as you

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:36.300 
going down just slightly but as you
notice<00:02:34.570> we<00:02:34.750> are<00:02:34.960> still<00:02:35.140> on<00:02:35.230> the<00:02:35.350> flat<00:02:35.530> road<00:02:35.770> the

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
notice we are still on the flat road the

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.839 
notice we are still on the flat road the
road<00:02:36.490> has<00:02:36.670> not<00:02:36.820> changed

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:45.110 

and<00:02:42.260> if<00:02:43.260> you're<00:02:44.040> concerned<00:02:44.760> about<00:02:44.969> the

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
and if you're concerned about the

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.910 
and if you're concerned about the
weather<00:02:45.269> it's<00:02:45.840> about<00:02:46.019> 90<00:02:46.349> degrees<00:02:46.530> outside

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
weather it's about 90 degrees outside

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.610 
weather it's about 90 degrees outside
this<00:02:47.430> is<00:02:47.579> Deep<00:02:47.760> South<00:02:47.969> Texas

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
this is Deep South Texas

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.569 
this is Deep South Texas
humidity<00:02:49.620> is<00:02:49.650> relatively<00:02:50.010> higher<00:02:50.280> at<00:02:50.400> about

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:50.579 
humidity is relatively higher at about

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:54.170 
humidity is relatively higher at about
70%<00:02:51.469> but<00:02:52.469> weather<00:02:52.920> does<00:02:53.280> make<00:02:53.489> a<00:02:53.519> big

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
70% but weather does make a big

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.239 
70% but weather does make a big
difference<00:02:54.299> and<00:02:54.870> on<00:02:55.019> a<00:02:55.379> much<00:02:55.680> colder<00:02:55.950> day

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:56.249 
difference and on a much colder day

00:02:56.249 --> 00:02:58.009 
difference and on a much colder day
these<00:02:56.549> numbers<00:02:57.359> are<00:02:57.480> actually<00:02:57.629> better

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
these numbers are actually better

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:02.149 
these numbers are actually better
because<00:02:58.469> there<00:02:58.769> is<00:02:58.889> more<00:02:59.750> oxygen<00:03:00.750> and<00:03:01.159> cold

00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:02.159 
because there is more oxygen and cold

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:03.289 
because there is more oxygen and cold
it's<00:03:02.310> more<00:03:02.489> dense<00:03:02.760> and<00:03:02.939> the<00:03:03.060> colder

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:03.299 
it's more dense and the colder

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:05.360 
it's more dense and the colder
temperature<00:03:03.689> so<00:03:04.530> I'm<00:03:04.590> going<00:03:04.739> to<00:03:04.799> increase<00:03:05.069> the

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
temperature so I'm going to increase the

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:06.800 
temperature so I'm going to increase the
miles<00:03:05.760> per<00:03:06.030> gallon<00:03:06.269> here<00:03:06.389> because<00:03:06.629> we<00:03:06.780> are

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
miles per gallon here because we are

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.360 
miles per gallon here because we are
kind<00:03:07.139> of<00:03:07.200> at<00:03:07.319> an<00:03:07.379> edited<00:03:07.709> clip<00:03:07.829> I<00:03:08.040> want<00:03:08.159> you<00:03:08.310> to

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
kind of at an edited clip I want you to

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.839 
kind of at an edited clip I want you to
see<00:03:08.549> how<00:03:09.359> this<00:03:09.540> vehicle<00:03:09.900> performs<00:03:10.650> at<00:03:11.249> 65

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:11.849 
see how this vehicle performs at 65

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:17.600 
see how this vehicle performs at 65
miles<00:03:12.090> per<00:03:12.329> hour

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.760 

here<00:03:18.120> we<00:03:18.210> are<00:03:18.240> set<00:03:18.630> cruise<00:03:18.960> control<00:03:19.260> at<00:03:19.350> 66

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:19.770 
here we are set cruise control at 66

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:22.310 
here we are set cruise control at 66
miles<00:03:19.980> per<00:03:20.640> hour<00:03:20.790> just<00:03:21.120> look<00:03:21.840> at<00:03:21.930> our<00:03:21.960> miles<00:03:22.200> to

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
miles per hour just look at our miles to

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:26.320 
miles per hour just look at our miles to
the<00:03:22.410> gallon

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.330 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:27.790 

and<00:03:26.810> of<00:03:26.930> course<00:03:27.140> now<00:03:27.320> we're<00:03:27.500> at<00:03:27.560> a<00:03:27.620> much<00:03:27.770> higher

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:27.800 
and of course now we're at a much higher

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.010 
and of course now we're at a much higher
RPM<00:03:28.550> we<00:03:28.760> are<00:03:28.880> on<00:03:29.000> the<00:03:29.090> top<00:03:29.270> here<00:03:29.510> sixth<00:03:29.810> gear

about<00:03:33.770> 45<00:03:34.370> miles<00:03:34.550> to<00:03:34.700> the<00:03:34.820> gallon<00:03:35.000> which<00:03:35.360> is

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
about 45 miles to the gallon which is

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:40.090 
about 45 miles to the gallon which is

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100 
just about normal that concludes this
