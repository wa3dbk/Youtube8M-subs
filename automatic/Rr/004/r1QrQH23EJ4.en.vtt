legal of people came to ram field today
with<00:00:12.719> the<00:00:12.980> thought<00:00:13.980> that<00:00:14.009> perhaps<00:00:14.339> it<00:00:15.089> would

00:00:15.319 --> 00:00:15.329 
with the thought that perhaps it would

00:00:15.329 --> 00:00:17.630 
with the thought that perhaps it would
be<00:00:15.360> more<00:00:15.480> win<00:00:16.020> than<00:00:16.049> the<00:00:16.440> Lawson's<00:00:17.430> to<00:00:17.490> see

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640

them<00:00:17.790> will<00:00:18.000> get<00:00:18.090> off<00:00:18.210> to<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:18.360> start<00:00:18.450> that<00:00:18.840> they

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
them will get off to the start that they

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.850 
them will get off to the start that they
did<00:00:19.260> I<00:00:19.500> think<00:00:20.040> ultimately<00:00:21.500> proved<00:00:22.500> a<00:00:22.620> little

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:22.860 
did I think ultimately proved a little

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.700 
did I think ultimately proved a little
bit<00:00:23.150> too<00:00:24.150> much<00:00:24.360> I<00:00:24.630> thought<00:00:25.260> perhaps<00:00:25.380> it<00:00:25.620> might

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
bit too much I thought perhaps it might

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:26.930 
bit too much I thought perhaps it might
have<00:00:25.860> been<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:25.980> wake<00:00:26.220> up<00:00:26.370> call<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.670> middle

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:26.940 
have been the wake up call the middle

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:29.000 
have been the wake up call the middle
needed<00:00:27.270> but<00:00:27.390> it<00:00:27.510> didn't<00:00:28.380> work<00:00:28.560> out<00:00:28.680> that<00:00:28.740> way

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
needed but it didn't work out that way

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.390 
needed but it didn't work out that way
pelipper<00:00:29.640> went<00:00:29.820> from<00:00:29.910> bad<00:00:30.090> to<00:00:30.150> worse<00:00:30.450> I<00:00:31.400> I

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:32.400 
pelipper went from bad to worse I I

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.190 
pelipper went from bad to worse I I
thought<00:00:32.759> West<00:00:32.970> Ham<00:00:33.180> played<00:00:33.450> really<00:00:33.720> well<00:00:33.840> I

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
thought West Ham played really well I

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.010 
thought West Ham played really well I
thought<00:00:34.470> they<00:00:34.680> got<00:00:34.890> men<00:00:35.130> behind<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.579> ball

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.020 
thought they got men behind the ball

thought they got men behind the ball
Liverpool<00:00:37.020> were<00:00:37.170> probably<00:00:37.410> a<00:00:37.950> little<00:00:38.700> bit

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
Liverpool were probably a little bit

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000 
Liverpool were probably a little bit
slow<00:00:39.690> in<00:00:39.720> getting<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.260> moving<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:40.860> ball

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
slow in getting the moving the ball

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.970 
slow in getting the moving the ball
forward<00:00:41.960> benteke<00:00:42.960> didn't<00:00:43.440> get<00:00:43.560> much<00:00:43.710> service

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
forward benteke didn't get much service

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.760 
forward benteke didn't get much service
at<00:00:44.520> that<00:00:44.579> particular<00:00:44.940> time<00:00:45.300> but<00:00:45.870> take<00:00:46.470> nothing

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
at that particular time but take nothing

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.080 
at that particular time but take nothing
away<00:00:46.829> from<00:00:47.010> Western<00:00:47.550> I<00:00:47.579> thought<00:00:47.850> they<00:00:48.030> were

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
away from Western I thought they were

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.790 
away from Western I thought they were
excellent<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:48.930> I<00:00:49.079> thought<00:00:49.260> they<00:00:49.500> approach

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
excellent and I thought they approach

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.920 
excellent and I thought they approach
the<00:00:50.010> game<00:00:50.149> slightly<00:00:51.149> better<00:00:51.360> in<00:00:51.540> the<00:00:51.690> first

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
the game slightly better in the first

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.900 
the game slightly better in the first
half<00:00:52.140> got<00:00:52.470> the<00:00:52.590> two<00:00:52.770> goal<00:00:53.040> lead<00:00:53.070> by<00:00:53.850> two

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
half got the two goal lead by two

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.700 
half got the two goal lead by two
mistakes<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:54.780> then<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.079> rest<00:00:55.230> of<00:00:55.410> it<00:00:55.530> was

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
mistakes and then the rest of it was

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.250 
mistakes and then the rest of it was
catchable<00:00:56.160> but<00:00:56.690> you<00:00:57.690> know<00:00:57.780> I<00:00:57.809> have<00:00:57.930> to<00:00:58.050> say
