00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 The important thing to ask yourself 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.720
 clarify any doubts with your 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.389
 doctor before making any decision 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.320
 really the best medicine is 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.960
 information 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.150
 and as information it never hurts to live 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.130
 well went to the diagnostic core for 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.410
 show how a 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.720
 magnetic resonance imaging which is now one of 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.039
 exams used by doctors 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.830
 because it is able to show 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:29.340
 images in any 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.470
 organ from any angle of our door. 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.890
 cameras can not get past this 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:39.090
 room has a huge magnetic field it is 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:41.700
 a magnetic field that does the translation 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.460
 to images on your computer by 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.899
 wave or electromagnetic waves through the 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.340
 radio frequency 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.219
 to get an idea of ​​the magnetic field 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:53.430
 of a resonance device is 30 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.050
 50 thousand times the earth's magnetic field 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.940
 the patients who come here beyond 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.920
 need to be fasting 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.320
 you have to get rid of all objects 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.449
 after all, they can disrupt the 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.030
 exam with everything prepared 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.340
 You can start during the exam. 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.229
 depending on the region evaluated the patient 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.689
 has multiple positions 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.180
 the patient is lying down or on the stomach 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.189
 down or up by entering the 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.049
 feet or else coming in with the head 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.939
 inside the resonance apparatus 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.890
 that is a tube 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:26.070
 people are very afraid of being a 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.650
 tube and tells you that the tube is closed but 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.530
 open at both ends and the patient 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.780
 lies motionless and can not move 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.150
 during the entire exam for the exams 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.369
 well done to the image the doctor is clear 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.790
 for the radiologist to give a 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.920
 100% real diagnosis people with 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.439
 claustrophobia may need up to 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.259
 sedation of our unity of our 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:52.530
 clinical patients having with the trophy 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.310
 bia is we always guide before the 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.229
 exam 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.110
 life our unity and see our 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:01.170
 machine is the patient tries to make a 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.390
 attempt to do without sedation 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.220
 if the patient can not do it 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.230
 an 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:09.020
 in progress with sedation the patient has 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:11.810
 that coming with us makes a bad 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:14.510
 Symmetry in the patient we give the whole 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.790
 support in the chat goes to see high blood pressure 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:20.180
 if you have hypertension or not and 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:23.000
 people do prass control and give that 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.970
 this patient is sedated in our 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.550
 drive and relax and relax is not in this 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.180
 day he gets very relaxed and tries to do 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.030
 the exam 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:35.380
 result delivered well the rest of the 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.380
 Work stays with your doctor.
