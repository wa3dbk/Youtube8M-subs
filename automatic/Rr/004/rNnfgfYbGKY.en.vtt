like<00:03:30.320> this<00:03:30.700> take<00:03:31.700> a<00:03:31.760> bobby<00:03:31.940> pin<00:03:32.060> and<00:03:33.400> just

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
like this take a bobby pin and just

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.550 
like this take a bobby pin and just
secure<00:03:34.580> that<00:03:35.000> so<00:03:35.960> it<00:03:36.020> doesn't<00:03:36.080> go<00:03:36.350> anywhere

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
just take that and create a second loop

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.450 
just take that and create a second loop
like<00:03:45.920> this<00:03:46.160> take<00:03:46.640> your<00:03:46.760> bobby<00:03:46.940> pin<00:03:47.180> and<00:03:48.460> just
