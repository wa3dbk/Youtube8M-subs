00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
on Brady Quinn I think it's the other

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.330 
on Brady Quinn I think it's the other
side<00:02:36.200> of<00:02:36.319> the<00:02:36.379> ball<00:02:36.560> that<00:02:36.590> we've<00:02:36.859> seen<00:02:37.129> Notre

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
side of the ball that we've seen Notre

against<00:02:39.260> teams<00:02:39.500> that<00:02:39.650> can<00:02:39.739> run<00:02:39.950> and<00:02:40.220> and<00:02:40.909> I

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
against teams that can run and and I

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:43.119 
against teams that can run and and I
believe<00:02:41.750> when<00:02:42.109> you<00:02:42.140> look<00:02:42.409> at<00:02:42.560> the<00:02:42.680> group<00:02:42.920> of

00:02:43.119 --> 00:02:43.129 
believe when you look at the group of

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:45.160 
believe when you look at the group of
wide<00:02:43.340> receivers<00:02:43.519> that<00:02:44.030> JaMarcus<00:02:44.540> Russell<00:02:44.629> has

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
wide receivers that JaMarcus Russell has

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.170 
wide receivers that JaMarcus Russell has
top<00:02:45.980> to<00:02:46.190> bottom<00:02:46.370> you<00:02:46.639> look<00:02:46.760> at<00:02:46.819> those<00:02:46.909> top

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
top to bottom you look at those top

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.210 
top to bottom you look at those top
three<00:02:47.209> or<00:02:47.540> four<00:02:47.569> may<00:02:48.230> be<00:02:48.290> as<00:02:48.500> good<00:02:48.739> as<00:02:48.859> there<00:02:49.069> is

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
three or four may be as good as there is

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.759 
three or four may be as good as there is
not<00:02:49.549> only<00:02:49.700> in<00:02:49.819> the<00:02:49.879> SEC<00:02:50.450> but<00:02:50.989> in<00:02:51.079> the<00:02:51.230> country

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
not only in the SEC but in the country

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:53.680 
not only in the SEC but in the country
and<00:02:51.950> the<00:02:52.099> secondary<00:02:52.730> of<00:02:52.819> Notre<00:02:53.090> get<00:02:53.389> Notre

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
and the secondary of Notre get Notre

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.569 
and the secondary of Notre get Notre
Dame<00:02:53.900> kind<00:02:54.409> of<00:02:54.470> the<00:02:54.530> Achilles<00:02:55.040> heel<00:02:55.069> for<00:02:55.459> that

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:55.579 
Dame kind of the Achilles heel for that

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:57.720 
Dame kind of the Achilles heel for that
defense<00:02:55.790> I<00:02:56.239> think<00:02:56.510> will<00:02:56.780> struggle<00:02:57.139> mightily

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730
