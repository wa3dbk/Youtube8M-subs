00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:06.089
 Hi, welcome to tv hbr. 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.389
 Brazil. To show her today by doing 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.710
 coverage of the leadership event is 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.309
 going on here in sao paulo here to 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.620
 my side 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.470
 marcelo demarzo who is professor of 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.750
 university of São Paulo and that 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.420
 was the mediator of our first panel 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.890
 All right, Marcelo, welcome, thank you. 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.990
 marcelo for you, what were the 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.010
 highlights of this first panel where 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.510
 talked about awareness about may funes 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:32.040
 I think the first highlight is power 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.649
 bring this subject to the world 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.290
 Corporate is a subject that in the states 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.809
 united and in europe is enough 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:42.120
 recently discussed a cover of the 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.280
 commented on this theme of May was and 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.930
 not only in the corporate world but 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.969
 world of health and education 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.190
 yes so I think this is unprecedented is 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.239
 bring this theme in brazil to the world 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.059
 corporate 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.520
 I think it's already a novelty this 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.530
 event and be able to bring 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.050
 international and national reference 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.730
 also in the subject the teacher helen langer 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.530
 the professor josé roberto leite marcelo 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.630
 you thought about the participation 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.540
 of them in the first ellen she made a 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.460
 explanation on our panel to her. 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.770
 is an international reference in the 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.500
 has two great references the game 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.680
 finish yes and there lander who has several in 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.210
 My mother is the mother talking about my father and 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.580
 She would be the mother then there are two 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.170
 international scholars who are 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.689
 pioneers even bring that theme 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.920
 for the area of ​​health education and also the 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.869
 corporate world 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.570
 so I think you have it between the 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:36.780
 speakers is already a great gain and she 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:39.450
 brought the vision is she brought the 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.460
 contradiction between the 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.579
 view of not being present in the mind 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.200
 of vacancy and mind and mind 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.540
 that 's what we're looking for with more fans 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.820
 I think this was the strong point of 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.399
 Her lecture where and what it 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.479
 implies in our lives not being attentive 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.729
 I will be attentive and what are the 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.619
 benefits of being aware of the harmful effects 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.079
 not to be aware I think that was the 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:03.119
 fundamental point then we always 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:06.210
 josé roberto also speaking a little 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.780
 about meditation practices and everything 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.640
 more 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.319
 we had the marcelo cardoso that even 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.140
 make the beginning of his presentation 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:16.980
 There are things about Buddhism and everything else. 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.900
 this is not too ethereal for the world of 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:24.360
 I still work today, not only for the 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:26.430
 novelty but for the to be not so 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.800
 measurable but I wish it were 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.900
 Truth pretty much measurable today 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.910
 This is interesting. Understand more happily. 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.920
 in a context it is actually a term 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.230
 umbrella has one is one has one 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.700
 polysemic connotation when people 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.160
 speak weaker is talking about a 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.739
 mental state and mindfulness or 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.940
 intentionally present in the 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:46.530
 activity that I am that I am 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.959
 doing in this moment so here 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.300
 talking to you and I am present in the 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:54.750
 conversation equivalent to the state of 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.550
 flow or not or nelson has to do with 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.260
 So, for me to be in the flu I have 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.269
 that being present right? 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.209
 but I'm not happy anymore, there are several others 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:05.580
 connotations then first thing that is 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.560
 a mental state the psychological state 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.780
 where are you present your attention 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.390
 is regulated for the phenomenon that is 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.190
 happening right now, this is it 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.650
 Do you have a series of exercises that 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:19.200
 you can use them to train this 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.970
 state of May and the most 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.500
 known and recognized in the world 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.590
 that develops this 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.730
 ability or this ability to 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.140
 bring attention to what is 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.420
 happening right now are the tests 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.700
 techniques that are derived from meditation 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.620
 That's when we talk more 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.390
 cold sometimes people think and 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.950
 meditation but does not necessarily want to 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.959
 say that means more 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.420
 this psychological state that I can 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:44.670
 develop with meditative techniques 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.829
 and what is different is what joão 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.410
 cabacinha was ireland and several others 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:50.070
 English authors are Canadian in Brazil 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.440
 also 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:54.060
 thus being developed what is 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.100
 different here these techniques 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:59.760
 have been incorporated into the 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:01.500
 in measurable structured programs 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.930
 which are applied both in the health area 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:06.660
 and in the area of ​​education in the world 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.640
 corporate a way to treat more 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:11.459
 leaves is so you treat transforms 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:14.310
 these techniques and more just techniques 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:16.590
 cognitive behavioral programs 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:19.280
 but structured analysis has been applied 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.600
 different environments and one of them 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:22.700
 the corporate world from then on 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:24.260
 from there you can search and 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:26.780
 skirt what he was talking about the 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:28.850
 esoterism exactly the pre- concept that 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:31.370
 we have on these practices very 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:33.470
 well you got you had or 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:34.700
 found a highlight in each one's speech 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:36.980
 I think they will join us already. 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:38.900
 I talked to you about José Roberto and 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:41.450
 marcelo cardoso something that you would highlight 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.669
 is falling in the speech of gold zé roberto 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:45.919
 him and bring you a program 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:48.200
 structured then how do I do this 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:50.419
 because it is an issue is one understood that the 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:51.919
 mother was in this I agree it seems that 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:54.140
 here is an interesting thing but how 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:55.550
 I do it to vote blank day to day 

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:57.230
 in my company but I think he 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:00.500
 brought an example of a program 

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:02.000
 how to incorporate this and other 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:04.430
 interesting factor that he brought that 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.710
 then he measured it as a 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:08.960
 scientist he researched applied scales 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:10.940
 applied scientific methodology to 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.530
 if that works, he did not check it 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:14.390
 works in that program as there are 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:16.280
 various other scientific articles 

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:19.160
 speaking of several other programs that 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:20.630
 I can analyze and apply in the environment 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:23.390
 corporate right 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:24.650
 Marcelo, I think he brought a 

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:26.660
 very great wealth in experience 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:28.190
 staff in something else in a clinic in which 

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:31.100
 it was the personal path after 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:31.550
 professional to enter happier 

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.979
 huh 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:35.810
 the first one always in mine on mine 

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:39.260
 life and then how can I pass? 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:41.450
 that to me the corporation to the 

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:44.090
 my collaborators for you what is the 

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:44.930
 new is not only the consciousness in your 

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:47.390
 life 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:49.280
 I work with this idea of ​​state 

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:51.100
 mental state then I 

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:53.900
 I also practice techniques and exercises 

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:55.910
 are only legislative techniques develop 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:58.370
 more leaves today we even have 

00:05:55.910 --> 00:06:00.620
 a research in this area physical exercise 

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:03.530
 Do you know that then you make a run 

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:04.729
 Do you exercise with mindfulness? 

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:07.520
 different from the one in the gym 

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:10.340
 doing exercise reading watching TV 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:12.169
 reading a book we his real and looking 

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:13.880
 also use when you make a 

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:15.229
 exercise with attention to the 

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:18.440
 movements in body sensations 

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:20.180
 also May 1 technique but it was 

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:22.820
 it may be you develop this state 

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:24.529
 So it's for me to bring the 

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:25.669
 problems that work with mother 

00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:27.679
 The idea is to bring this into my day to 

00:06:25.669 --> 00:06:29.449
 day and this is the most important are the 

00:06:27.679 --> 00:06:30.949
 techniques allow me to develop this 

00:06:29.449 --> 00:06:32.199
 state so I can bring my 

00:06:30.949 --> 00:06:34.909
 day to day so that I can bring a 

00:06:32.199 --> 00:06:36.559
 interview so I can bring it to 

00:06:34.909 --> 00:06:38.599
 a relationship with the patient as 

00:06:36.559 --> 00:06:40.879
 So students so that I can 

00:06:38.599 --> 00:06:41.329
 to actually incorporate this into my day. 

00:06:40.879 --> 00:06:43.729
 day 

00:06:41.329 --> 00:06:46.369
 then I would appeal to me, I understood then I 

00:06:43.729 --> 00:06:49.039
 I was here, I enjoy my hours of 

00:06:46.369 --> 00:06:50.179
 academy to listen to the audio books I 

00:06:49.039 --> 00:06:52.279
 I have to stop it, I 'm not 

00:06:50.179 --> 00:06:53.839
 taking advantage of both or any other right 

00:06:52.279 --> 00:06:55.159
 depends on your purpose you can 

00:06:53.839 --> 00:06:56.989
 enjoy it 

00:06:55.159 --> 00:06:58.639
 but if you want to develop more 

00:06:56.989 --> 00:07:00.349
 influence has to do a task for 

00:06:58.639 --> 00:07:03.559
 Now, people are not much anymore. 

00:07:00.349 --> 00:07:05.269
 multitasking but attention is because the 

00:07:03.559 --> 00:07:07.669
 people can not get attention and 

00:07:05.269 --> 00:07:09.229
 selective is but if you want 

00:07:07.669 --> 00:07:10.849
 developing the state of mindfulness is 

00:07:09.229 --> 00:07:12.229
 It's interesting that you do a task. 

00:07:10.849 --> 00:07:13.969
 at time then if you are doing 

00:07:12.229 --> 00:07:15.469
 exercise does physical exercise 

00:07:13.969 --> 00:07:17.059
 be present 

00:07:15.469 --> 00:07:18.769
 if you are taking a shower be so 

00:07:17.059 --> 00:07:20.299
 that is present in the bath you are 

00:07:18.769 --> 00:07:22.339
 Talking be present, you are 

00:07:20.299 --> 00:07:23.989
 reading a book is present in the 

00:07:22.339 --> 00:07:26.209
 activity so you develop the two 

00:07:23.989 --> 00:07:29.149
 things at once very well very
