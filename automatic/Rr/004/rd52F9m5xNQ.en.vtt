00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:15.969
 hello everyone speaking 991 and today 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.110
 I bring this video about the threw and 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:18.970
 is that the best way to start 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:20.500
 play the call of duty that goes into the 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.660
 first part and when you have not yet 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.420
 seen no enemy launch a 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.849
 thrown crossing the map like this 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.500
 to end up making the truth diana 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:30.849
 is that after a milestone like this one promises 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.130
 According to DÃ­az regarding the call of duty 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:34.600
 perfect but good I think it 's that 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:36.250
 we also have a little undervalued to 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.110
 the red vice is that my opinion in hands 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.210
 of an inspired soldier can be lethal 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.880
 I dare say that the most 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.230
 junk of all you see that you kill 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.330
 short distance but as you have seen 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:49.390
 just it stays there and I'll kill you now 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:50.770
 middle distance another one that infected and 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.750
 is that I already say in this infected part 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:54.940
 been inspired by the desire to infect 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.740
 everyone who will find me ahead and 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.660
 I already say that when you are inspired not 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:00.040
 there is nothing like the throwing or the time 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.960
 or anything you need is a blast with 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.730
 the type here already with a good thrower 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.799
 in this case I'm not very inspired but 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.049
 thankfully I recover and I already say with a 

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:10.119
 throw at any distance and kill 

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:11.829
 ankle to the chest to the back 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:14.110
 you can see that I did not see any 

00:01:11.829 --> 00:01:15.729
 another that infect and now peeped at 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.630
 someone in the background I throw the red 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:19.960
 difficult that when 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:21.369
 everything goes the same but also that 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.200
 this is still not going to end here because 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:25.450
 they are going to kill me good after this 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.820
 throwing moment I have to follow 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.110
 infecting I'm going to go to that area and I'm going to 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.850
 load the last one part left 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.100
 quite strange infected in which 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:36.220
 he killed much more being infected than without 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.990
 be and here I am going to charge others and 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.909
 well now we go to outputs to see 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.170
 another throwing throwing cross 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:42.399
 the world that good I think that this was 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.770
 the first across map that I made in the 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:46.539
 modern warfare 3 are the first days and 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.819
 there you see how he launched to finish again 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:51.670
 doing and now but eye does not blink is 

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:53.560
 because you're going to lose it takes 360 but 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.880
 well let's go to the clear demonstration 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.799
 that this is the quietest weapon in 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.599
 all and you see that when you do 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:59.920
 haymarket when you do not give one when the 

00:01:58.599 --> 00:02:01.929
 red made bad spears but you finish 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.610
 also making a target and is that the 

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:05.709
 Red says is responsible for correcting your 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.799
 own mistakes you see you have to change the 

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:11.230
 trajectory to end up in the belly of 

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:12.430
 an enemy that I had not even seen and 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.140
 it's good I hope you liked it 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.670
 this video about throwing this weapon 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.670
 so small but so lethal
