00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.800
 I heard there was a prophecy about me. 

00:00:11.401 --> 00:00:15.101
 It would seem that the prophecy refers to our annihilation. 

00:00:22.002 --> 00:00:22.702
 Our home... 

00:00:23.703 --> 00:00:25.003
 ... has been attacked. 

00:00:25.404 --> 00:00:26.404
 Who would do this? 

00:00:27.905 --> 00:00:28.405
 Luke? 

00:00:28.706 --> 00:00:31.606
 It turns out that you are not the only demigod difficult to kill. 

00:00:33.807 --> 00:00:36.207
 The only thing that has the power to save our home ... 

00:00:36.708 --> 00:00:37.808
 ... is the Golden Fleece. 

00:00:39.409 --> 00:00:40.809
 It is located in the Sea of ​​Monsters. 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:43.510
 What humans call The Bermuda Triangle. 

00:00:45.611 --> 00:00:48.511
 A mission only for our best heroes. 

00:00:50.912 --> 00:00:51.712
 This is a bad idea. 

00:00:51.713 --> 00:00:53.013
 You do not even know what I'm going to say. 

00:00:53.214 --> 00:00:55.014
 You're going to tell me you're going to go for the Golden Fleece. 

00:00:55.015 --> 00:00:56.515
 In fact, I was going to say we should go. 

00:01:02.516 --> 00:01:03.316
 Hold on to something. 

00:01:13.517 --> 00:01:14.117
 That was... 

00:01:14.518 --> 00:01:15.418
 Cool! 

00:01:15.819 --> 00:01:17.319
 Excuse me, we are looking for Hermes. 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.820
 A little insulting that you did not recognize me. 

00:01:22.121 --> 00:01:24.621
 We need your help, and we do not have much time. 

00:01:24.622 --> 00:01:28.022
 Unscrew the top of this and you will release the winds from the four corners of the world. 

00:01:28.323 --> 00:01:29.723
 No no! Not here! 

00:01:30.224 --> 00:01:31.224
 Not here. 

00:01:31.325 --> 00:01:33.125
 ON AUGUST 7 

00:01:33.726 --> 00:01:35.026
 Tell me you are not sharks. 

00:01:36.027 --> 00:01:37.127
 They are not sharks. 

00:01:46.028 --> 00:01:48.328
 If there is something that I have learned, it is that you can not abandon the family. 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:50.129
 THE GREATEST ADVENTURE OF THE EARTH 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:55.630
 BEGINS AT THE SEA 

00:02:14.331 --> 00:02:17.431
