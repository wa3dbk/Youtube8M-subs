00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
in the vascular plants now we will

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.549 
in the vascular plants now we will
discuss<00:01:02.969> them<00:01:03.180> one<00:01:03.359> by<00:01:03.539> one<00:01:03.570> first<00:01:04.260> as<00:01:04.530> the

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
discuss them one by one first as the

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.520 
discuss them one by one first as the
xylem<00:01:05.400> tissue<00:01:05.610> xylem<00:01:06.299> word<00:01:06.540> is<00:01:06.840> derived<00:01:07.110> from

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
xylem tissue xylem word is derived from

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:13.210 
xylem tissue xylem word is derived from
the<00:01:07.740> Greek<00:01:08.100> word<00:01:08.630> xylose<00:01:10.549> which<00:01:11.549> means<00:01:12.020> would

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
the Greek word xylose which means would

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.280 
the Greek word xylose which means would
therefore<00:01:14.220> xylem<00:01:15.000> is<00:01:15.150> also<00:01:15.570> commonly<00:01:15.960> known

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
therefore xylem is also commonly known

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.510 
therefore xylem is also commonly known
as<00:01:16.530> they<00:01:17.220> would<00:01:17.430> it<00:01:17.790> forms<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:19.080> bulk<00:01:19.439> of<00:01:19.740> 10

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
as they would it forms the bulk of 10

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.640 
as they would it forms the bulk of 10
and<00:01:21.979> roots<00:01:22.979> and<00:01:23.430> it<00:01:24.150> forms<00:01:24.689> a<00:01:24.869> continuous
