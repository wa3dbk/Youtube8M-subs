there's<00:01:10.770> a<00:01:10.830> connection<00:01:11.189> that's<00:01:11.490> underneath

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
there's a connection that's underneath

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.420

right<00:01:12.990> over<00:01:13.409> here<00:01:13.860> that's<00:01:14.040> a<00:01:14.130> little<00:01:14.250> bit

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
right over here that's a little bit

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.100

you're having problems pulling it apart

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.190 
you're having problems pulling it apart
it<00:01:17.880> is<00:01:18.030> one<00:01:18.180> of<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.330> connectors<00:01:18.780> I<00:01:18.900> have<00:01:19.049> the

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200

it is one of the connectors I have the
clip<00:01:19.409> on<00:01:19.590> it<00:01:19.619> that<00:01:19.830> you<00:01:19.890> have<00:01:20.070> to<00:01:20.280> clip<00:01:21.240> oh<00:01:21.390> and

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
then push this thing to pull it out I

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.990 
then push this thing to pull it out I
something<00:01:25.770> similar<00:01:26.100> to<00:01:26.310> that<00:01:26.340> bad<00:01:26.759> boy<00:01:26.970> right

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
something similar to that bad boy right

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.090 
something similar to that bad boy right
there<00:01:27.479> at<00:01:27.990> any<00:01:28.110> rate<00:01:28.350> I<00:01:28.380> wasn't<00:01:28.740> sure<00:01:28.860> I<00:01:28.890> had<00:01:29.070> a

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
there at any rate I wasn't sure I had a

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.380 
there at any rate I wasn't sure I had a
little<00:01:29.310> fought<00:01:29.579> without<00:01:29.700> for<00:01:30.030> a<00:01:30.060> little<00:01:30.270> bit

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
little fought without for a little bit

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.050 
little fought without for a little bit
time<00:01:30.600> but<00:01:31.290> then<00:01:31.439> again<00:01:31.530> I'm<00:01:31.740> no<00:01:31.920> mechanic<00:01:32.070> this

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
time but then again I'm no mechanic this

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.310 
time but then again I'm no mechanic this
I<00:01:33.240> right<00:01:33.420> here<00:01:33.570> was<00:01:33.750> a<00:01:33.780> little<00:01:34.049> more<00:01:34.140> difficult

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
I right here was a little more difficult

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.649 
I right here was a little more difficult
the<00:01:34.770> EGR<00:01:35.250> cooler<00:01:35.340> itself<00:01:35.909> was<00:01:36.119> kind<00:01:36.329> of<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.479> pain

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
the EGR cooler itself was kind of a pain

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.010 
the EGR cooler itself was kind of a pain
in<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:36.810> butt<00:01:36.990> to<00:01:37.470> get<00:01:37.590> out<00:01:38.420> the<00:01:39.420> front<00:01:39.600> wasn't

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
in the butt to get out the front wasn't

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.889 
in the butt to get out the front wasn't
too<00:01:40.170> bad<00:01:40.729> the<00:01:41.729> back<00:01:41.939> was<00:01:42.180> pretty<00:01:42.390> tough<00:01:42.600> to<00:01:42.630> get

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
too bad the back was pretty tough to get

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.380 
too bad the back was pretty tough to get
out<00:01:43.049> but<00:01:43.259> I<00:01:43.409> did<00:01:43.649> eventually<00:01:43.770> get<00:01:44.250> at<00:01:44.460> it<00:01:44.640> now

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
out but I did eventually get at it now

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.760 
out but I did eventually get at it now
as<00:01:45.630> you<00:01:45.750> guys<00:01:45.869> probably<00:01:45.899> know<00:01:46.320> with<00:01:46.560> all<00:01:46.680> the

out there some of them block off the
coolant<00:01:54.689> line<00:01:55.040> that<00:01:56.040> goes<00:01:56.219> to<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.149> block

and some of them run a-holes I chose to

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.700 
and some of them run a-holes I chose to
run<00:02:00.480> a-holes<00:02:00.750> even<00:02:01.020> though<00:02:01.110> this<00:02:01.260> kid<00:02:01.530> that<00:02:01.680> I

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
run a-holes even though this kid that I

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.800 
run a-holes even though this kid that I

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.470 
had at the block off there and the block
off<00:02:04.050> right<00:02:04.290> here<00:02:04.670> you<00:02:05.670> just<00:02:05.850> plug<00:02:06.030> it<00:02:06.060> up<00:02:06.240> there

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:06.480

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:07.820 
off right here you just plug it up there
and<00:02:06.630> plug<00:02:06.780> it<00:02:06.900> up<00:02:06.960> over<00:02:07.140> there<00:02:07.380> I<00:02:07.410> decide<00:02:07.800> to

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
and plug it up over there I decide to

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.280 
and plug it up over there I decide to
run<00:02:08.040> the<00:02:08.360> holes<00:02:09.360> there<00:02:09.570> just<00:02:09.780> for<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:09.930> fact<00:02:10.110> I

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:10.290 
run the holes there just for the fact I

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:12.830 
run the holes there just for the fact I
heard<00:02:10.560> that<00:02:11.120> it's<00:02:12.120> supposed<00:02:12.360> to<00:02:12.450> give<00:02:12.660> you<00:02:12.690> a

heard that it's supposed to give you a

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.180 
heard that it's supposed to give you a
little<00:02:13.110> more<00:02:13.230> consistent<00:02:13.590> coolant

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190

temperatures<00:02:14.640> inside<00:02:15.180> there<00:02:15.510> I've<00:02:16.080> heard

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
temperatures inside there I've heard

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.980 
temperatures inside there I've heard
some<00:02:16.530> stories<00:02:17.310> regarding<00:02:17.900> cracking<00:02:18.900> the

some stories regarding cracking the

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.260 
some stories regarding cracking the
heads<00:02:19.200> because<00:02:19.950> the<00:02:20.100> coolants<00:02:20.550> not<00:02:20.730> cooling

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270

there<00:02:23.870> also<00:02:24.870> when<00:02:25.170> you<00:02:25.260> do<00:02:25.410> do<00:02:26.040> the<00:02:26.430> delete<00:02:26.820> you

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
there also when you do do the delete you

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.280 
there also when you do do the delete you
lose<00:02:27.990> your<00:02:28.350> transmission<00:02:28.980> mount<00:02:30.170> because<00:02:31.170> it

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
lose your transmission mount because it

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.470 
lose your transmission mount because it
was<00:02:31.410> attached<00:02:31.680> to<00:02:31.800> the<00:02:31.920> cooler<00:02:32.130> before<00:02:32.550> so<00:02:32.880> we

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
was attached to the cooler before so we

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.710 
was attached to the cooler before so we
built<00:02:33.690> a<00:02:33.780> bracket<00:02:35.060> there's<00:02:36.060> a<00:02:36.180> bracket<00:02:36.570> right

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
built a bracket there's a bracket right

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.800 
built a bracket there's a bracket right
there<00:02:37.910> heated<00:02:38.910> it<00:02:39.000> up<00:02:39.120> a<00:02:39.240> little<00:02:39.360> bit<00:02:39.570> on<00:02:39.690> this

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
there heated it up a little bit on this

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.680 
there heated it up a little bit on this
side<00:02:39.870> that's<00:02:40.320> some<00:02:40.500> bending<00:02:40.920> and<00:02:41.340> voila<00:02:42.330> I

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
side that's some bending and voila I

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.080 
side that's some bending and voila I
have<00:02:43.320> a<00:02:43.350> bracket<00:02:43.800> I'm<00:02:44.520> pretty<00:02:44.700> happy<00:02:44.910> with

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090
