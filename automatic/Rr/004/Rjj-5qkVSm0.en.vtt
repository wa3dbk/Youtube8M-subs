glass<00:02:18.760> and<00:02:19.060> electronics<00:02:19.659> is<00:02:19.870> much<00:02:20.260> more<00:02:20.470> pair

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
glass and electronics is much more pair

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:22.380 
glass and electronics is much more pair

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.390 
intensive than just moving around bits
of<00:02:22.569> lens<00:02:22.780> and<00:02:23.080> it's<00:02:23.470> just<00:02:23.680> the<00:02:23.769> physics<00:02:24.129> of<00:02:24.280> it

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
of lens and it's just the physics of it

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.339 
of lens and it's just the physics of it
but<00:02:24.459> I<00:02:24.849> asked<00:02:25.420> them<00:02:25.510> about<00:02:25.569> it<00:02:25.870> and<00:02:25.959> I<00:02:26.080> was<00:02:26.200> told

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:26.349 
but I asked them about it and I was told

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:28.110 
but I asked them about it and I was told
very<00:02:26.470> confidently<00:02:27.280> that<00:02:27.519> they've<00:02:27.970> worked

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
very confidently that they've worked

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.209 
very confidently that they've worked
very<00:02:28.450> hard<00:02:28.510> at<00:02:28.840> optimizing<00:02:29.499> the<00:02:29.590> system<00:02:29.889> so<00:02:30.069> it

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:30.219 
very hard at optimizing the system so it

00:02:30.219 --> 00:02:31.890 
very hard at optimizing the system so it
doesn't<00:02:30.730> kick<00:02:30.999> the<00:02:31.180> hell<00:02:31.329> out<00:02:31.450> of<00:02:31.480> you<00:02:31.599> battery

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
doesn't kick the hell out of you battery

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.479 
doesn't kick the hell out of you battery
life<00:02:32.109> and<00:02:32.319> personally<00:02:32.980> I<00:02:33.069> find<00:02:33.279> it<00:02:33.430> very

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
life and personally I find it very

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:34.110 
life and personally I find it very
exciting

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
exciting

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.850 
exciting
to<00:02:34.209> see<00:02:34.390> the<00:02:34.510> Sony's<00:02:34.840> not<00:02:35.080> resting<00:02:35.650> on<00:02:35.709> its

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
to see the Sony's not resting on its

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.410 
to see the Sony's not resting on its
laurels<00:02:35.920> when<00:02:36.430> it<00:02:36.519> comes<00:02:36.700> to<00:02:36.849> keeping<00:02:37.060> their

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
laurels when it comes to keeping their

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
edge and their lead in this tack it's

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:41.460 
edge and their lead in this tack it's
got<00:02:40.239> to<00:02:40.330> be<00:02:40.390> a<00:02:40.420> fun<00:02:40.659> day<00:02:40.690> of<00:02:40.959> testing<00:02:41.319> when<00:02:41.440> I

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
got to be a fun day of testing when I

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:42.630 
got to be a fun day of testing when I
get<00:02:41.620> hands-on<00:02:42.010> with<00:02:42.159> one<00:02:42.310> of<00:02:42.370> these<00:02:42.459> new

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
get hands-on with one of these new

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.399 
get hands-on with one of these new
cameras<00:02:43.060> featuring<00:02:43.510> this<00:02:43.599> new<00:02:43.780> system<00:02:44.170> I<00:02:44.260> can

00:02:44.399 --> 00:02:44.409 
cameras featuring this new system I can

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:46.860 
cameras featuring this new system I can
already<00:02:44.560> tell<00:02:44.799> you<00:02:44.920> that<00:02:45.129> more<00:02:45.909> CES<00:02:46.390> discovers

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
already tell you that more CES discovers

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.270 
already tell you that more CES discovers
to<00:02:46.989> come<00:02:47.170> but<00:02:47.319> for<00:02:47.379> now<00:02:47.530> thanks<00:02:47.890> for<00:02:47.920> watching
