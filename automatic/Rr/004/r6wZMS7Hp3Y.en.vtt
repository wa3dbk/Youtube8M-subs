00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.530
 we have a new video every Thursday 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.719
 before ending with this video of all 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.910
 those tips for the return to class 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.430
 I want to send a very special greeting 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.250

 All the love that you give me in your 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.990
 Real comments that without you 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.699
 this would be absolutely nothing and for 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.349
 It is very important for me to know what story 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.660
 with each one of you because they are 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.430
 very special little people that all the 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.590
 days to deliver a little bit of your time 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.450
 to see these videos and the truth that I 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.879
 I value it very much I would love it 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.040
 know each one of you so 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.840
 can you leave me in the comments which 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.550
 It's your name and where are you from? 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.649
 so that I can know them 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.780
 much better now, let's start 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.670
 with the video and that is that when I was in 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.530
 the back- to-school series many of 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.510
 you asked me to give you tips 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.640
 to study then I thought that 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.320
 It would be better if I started studying 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.030
 see what things I do in my life 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.769
 student to share with 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.790
 you for me first and foremost 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.250
 important 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.050
 plan everything I plan from the book 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.690
 more voluminous that I have to read 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.580
 until what time will I fix even 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.470
 why always something with me a 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.450
 glider per week to go putting 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.550
 every day that I have to do but when 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.560
 I write things in my glider what 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:24.810
 I make by colors and to each matter I 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.520
 assigned a color for example geopolitics 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.990
 is so blue meta disclosed images the 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.729
 I threaten public good in red journalism 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.260
 blue communication and my culture 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.450
 powerful and everything that has to do with 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:36.000
 fashion compass is so fuchsia and what 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.009
 that is personal I put it with black like that 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.960
 when I looked all the glider and have 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.820
 memorized in the colors will be more 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.490
 easy to identify what I have to do 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.560
 each day according to each thing and then in what 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.660
 day I would have to do more things about 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.759
 certain matter next to each 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.500
 activity I make a square so that 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.270
 there is a checklist that 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.340
 when I do all the activities of the 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.440
 day and I can mark that says it they do not know 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.000
 the satisfaction so great that they feel 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.369
 I have all told them I study 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.229
 social communication and journalism and in my 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.940
 career they can read us a lot 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.310
 then for example for this semester 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:11.650
 they get heller four books the truth is 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.959
 that if you look at it like I have 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.760
 I'm going to get stressed and I do not know which one I'm going to 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:18.099
 read the first and the truth that that 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.900
 believer is super agile to read but I 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:23.640
 I'm more visual and I do not like that 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.640
 impose that I have to read but good 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:30.189
 when they said that I had to read 

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:31.810
 four books then like that you 

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:33.519
 you want to collapse that suddenly we 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.590
 start reading all at the same time and 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:37.510
 set is one character and the other 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.849
 history already and definitely the best 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.250
 option is to start reading a book 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:44.530
 deliver the work of that book read 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.299
 another deliver the work and so when you 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.069
 you're going to confuse when, for example, 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:50.230
 first book that I had to have read 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:52.959
 was this then what I did was look 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:55.480
 how many pages did this book have and 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:57.459
 how many days did they have but two or three 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.650
 days of advantage so in those days 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:01.450
 could do the reading report or the 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.220
 activity that I was asked for from the book 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:06.040
 doing accounts approximately half 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.629
 25 pages per day here I did the same 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.790
 with the other books either as 

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:11.980
 I delivered this work yesterday that was 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.109
 Wednesday today I start with a new book 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.970
 I also know that I have to read 13 

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:17.069
 daily pages and that's super good 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.109
 because this way every day 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:21.450
 you work your goal and then you're not 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:22.889
 so super stressed that it took the day of 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.329
 delivery and you have not read it free and 

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:28.859
 you have to lose the whole weekend 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:30.510
 nailed in the house and just all 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:32.579
 the days you know you have to make a 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.959
 little bit and then already at the moment 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:35.730
 you have to deliver that, come out super 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:37.739
 easy too some of you me 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.810
 they asked how he handled my ipad to the 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:41.879
 time to write because as I told you 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.439
 that's where he took note I have a 

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:45.239
 application that is called in class and the 

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:46.859
 super useful because you can store the 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:49.709
 database of all your teachers 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:52.620
 you can take note by notebooks then 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:55.620
 is very very useful you can also organize 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:58.260
 your tasks and prioritize if it is 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.359
 medium or low high priority and you can 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.489
 put an alarm so you know when 

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:03.959
 you have to do the homework there is something else 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:05.969
 that I forgot in the glider and 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:07.439
 now I only put the day where I have 

00:04:05.969 --> 00:04:09.780
 that deliver the activity but that 

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:11.459
 he also drew me a day to do it for 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.469
 example I know that for within 15 days 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:15.780
 I have to deliver a reading report 

00:04:13.469 --> 00:04:17.310
 but not only I leave it there like in 15 days 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:20.220
 I have to deliver a reading report 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.609
 I do not also say this week I'm going to do 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.830
 the reading report 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:25.810
 what specific day will I do it 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.849
 for me Sunday is a super day 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:29.740
 important because it 's when I feel 

00:04:27.849 --> 00:04:32.139
 in view of everything I have to 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:34.150
 deliver for certain time and what 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:35.800
 I'm going to organize in my glider according to 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:38.199
 what I will do every day of the 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.939
 next week something super super 

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:42.099
 important is to trace the objectives 

00:04:39.939 --> 00:04:43.840
 close measuring priorities is 

00:04:42.099 --> 00:04:45.430
 fundamental most times we 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.319
 we do everything at once and 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.000
 there are really tasks that have more 

00:04:47.319 --> 00:04:50.830
 priority than others because we have them 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.080
 to deliver first because simply 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.240
 they are much longer then when 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.159
 we plan all that school life we ​​have 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.169
 to worry about knowing that there is 

00:04:57.159 --> 00:05:01.029
 deliver first to give you more 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:03.129
 priority to this task and already when 

00:05:01.029 --> 00:05:05.379
 we are studying for example I that the 

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:07.300
 most of my time spending 

00:05:05.379 --> 00:05:09.849
 reading, I already know that if I have to 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:12.039
 read 20 pages then I fulfill my 

00:05:09.849 --> 00:05:14.169
 objective and then I give myself as a prize 

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:15.729
 suppose the end of reading the 20 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:18.310
 pages of the book that I had to read 

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:20.919
 so when it ends like something 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:22.389
 I put facebook to Instagram to YouTube 

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:24.639
 see the comments that you 

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:26.889
 write I pause for more or less 

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:28.539
 10 minutes and continue with the activity 

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:31.330
 what do I need because our brain 

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:34.300
 needs to rest the games we reject 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:35.889
 walk and enjoy things but that 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:39.129
 we also have to take breaks for 

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:41.439
 take a breath is throw and rest 

00:05:39.129 --> 00:05:43.330
 and finally for the exams I am 

00:05:41.439 --> 00:05:45.789
 Super visual as I had already told you 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:48.009
 then I study everything with cartoons 

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:49.719
 Here in this part I am going to leave you my 

00:05:48.009 --> 00:05:51.490
 drawings of my notebook that the truth I 

00:05:49.719 --> 00:05:53.979
 I know that they will not understand them and they are super 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:55.719
 confused and it looks messy but for 

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:57.400
 me is very important and for example if I 

00:05:55.719 --> 00:05:59.560
 I have to study history and I have to 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:01.300
 study america history first thing 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:03.279
 that comes to mind with the 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:05.800
 history of america is the color yellow 

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:07.930
 I do not know why but I relate it and 

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:09.610
 I have to study in Europe, I do not know either 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:11.500
 why but it comes to my mind 

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:14.650
 blue then draw and indigenous 

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:16.779
 fruit crowns swords I do not know things like that and 

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:19.060
 I do the same with europe at the moment of 

00:06:16.779 --> 00:06:21.129
 examination for the attention that produces us 

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:23.379
 this kind of situations many times 

00:06:21.129 --> 00:06:25.150
 we tend to confuse the concepts but 

00:06:23.379 --> 00:06:27.460
 I for example know that if I have a 

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:29.710
 confusion but I remember the drawing and the 

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:32.280
 color that I had right there I can assimilate 

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:34.170
 super easy what topic am I talking about 

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:35.430
 so there are thousands of ways to 

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:37.560
 study and that all people 

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:38.190
 we understand and study in ways 

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.990
 different 

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:41.550
 cappa I am sharing what to me 

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:43.169
 has served me and if you put it in 

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:45.150
 practice and also serves him I'm going to 

00:06:43.169 --> 00:06:47.010
 make super happy and another thing that I 

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:48.930
 super useful when it comes to studying 

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:51.060
 explain to a person everything that 

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:52.740
 study during the day there they say that 

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:54.540
 the best way to check that 

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:56.730
 you learned is when you can explain it 

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:58.230
 to the other in a simpler way because 

00:06:56.730 --> 00:07:00.510
 for example when I explain to 

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:02.790
 another person I know in what I have doubts 

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:04.980
 that the other person did not understand me in
