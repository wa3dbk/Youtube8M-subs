00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.030
 who understands consumer law

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:45.360
 careful not to suffer this type of 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.910
 on the back to the court he 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.250
 Seminole car has charmed the family of 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.960
 as soon as it was presented by the 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.149
 salesman at a dealership 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.010
 the automatic transmission was a 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.449
 buyer's requirement as per 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.520
 health reasons 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.379
 his wife can only run this type 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.660
 currently vehicle what the 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.210
 commercial representative did not know was 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.820
 that the panel indicated at least 10,000 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.770
 miles less than the original 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.479
 the way you discovered this fraud 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.260
 It was when we needed it in a hospital. 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.540
 in jaú 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.369
 My wife is sick and I went 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.159
 look for a provincial manual as well 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.810
 it rained I noticed that the subway 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.380
 was consuming more than 45 thousand 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.450
 miles in a car manual and hit the 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.670
 eye was so something wrong I 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.549
 had in the car with 39 thousand and 600 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.400
 kilometers and a manual with 45 thousand 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.710
 where he encountered the problem he had 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.049
 rogério sought the concessionaire but 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.979
 According to him the company did not 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.380
 adulteration 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.689
 the blow can only be proven because 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.030
 in addition to the manual revision stamps 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.220
 from the owner he found the old one 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.820
 car owner can not remember more or less 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:56.460
 when it was over almost 58 years 40 and 59 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.079
 fifteen hundred and fifty-seven thousand I asked 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.299
 Sir, give a statement of this. 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.240
 That's right, but it will not complicate me. 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.740
 I just want to verify my safety. 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.290
 imagine your child taking the road with 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.929
 the car he looks miles is not 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.670
 hit is not correct and only by granting 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.349
 suspension brake problem 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.599
 with this mechanic who buys a car 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:19.180
 so it may have good surprises 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:21.370
 unpleasant and even standing in the 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.140
 road during a trip if you do not 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.330
 a good review on the vehicle 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.860
 you may have an engine loss with the 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.340
 cogwheel break 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:34.560
 you may have a burning 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:37.870
 Injection by bad candles you can have at 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.100
 hand a series of defense provides for 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.200
 mileage round 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.930
 according to experts the practice is 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.180
 more common than we can imagine and 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.760
 Legal implications vary according to 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.920
 the type of consumption relationship but 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.110
 a negotiation between individuals 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.090
 involving the company practice 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:58.090
 can be easily detected 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.980
 the particular that adultery and sells the 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.660
 vehicle which has been tampered with 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.069
 relation to mileage is a practice 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.380
 which has been verified with more 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:06.489
 frequency it can be framed in the 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.440
 penal code 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:10.299
 Even when you talk about supplier 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.140
 delivering an adulterated product to the 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:14.100
 consumer 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:16.450
 it can be framed in the law 8137/90 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:19.840
 which deals with crimes against 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.700

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.750
 traders you can have the protection of 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:27.670
 civil code and especially in 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:29.290
 consumer relations will validate the code 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.850
 consumer protection to try to 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.280
 reimburse the consumer who has 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:35.410
 loss on account of this change 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.049
 The mechanic's point is to be attentive to 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:40.329
 details such as steering wheel wear and 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:42.910
 brake and clutch pedals and 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:44.739
 accelerator for example is furthermore 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.780
 important is to always trust 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:48.910
 mileage indicated on the dashboard 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.459
 the only way to ensure that the car 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.980
 is in good condition is making a 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:55.840
 general review general hill buildings in 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:59.049
 Let's take a look at everything we have to 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:01.540
 to be done analyzed peace budget of the 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:02.920
 customer and we will follow the history 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.630
 car from now on we 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.640
 We need to put a stop to this. 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:08.560
 have to do what is right if the car had 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.959
 with 200 thousand kilometers I was interested 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.630
 I would have bought it is not because of 20 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:15.280
 30 40 thousand less important is my 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:17.320
