chorus<00:03:55.150> oversight

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:17.480 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:22.510 

I<00:04:19.000> get<00:04:20.000> back<00:04:20.120> into<00:04:20.330> the<00:04:20.780> verse<00:04:21.340> 2nd<00:04:22.340> verse

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 
I get back into the verse 2nd verse

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:31.310 
I get back into the verse 2nd verse
which<00:04:22.790> is<00:04:22.820> just<00:04:23.150> a

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:35.550 

that's<00:04:32.320> away<00:04:33.180> exactly<00:04:34.180> and<00:04:34.479> the<00:04:34.600> chords<00:04:35.410> is

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
that's away exactly and the chords is

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.560 
that's away exactly and the chords is
verse<00:04:35.800> one

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 
verse one

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:42.320 
verse one
so<00:04:37.960> it's<00:04:38.139> chorus<00:04:38.560> to<00:04:38.800> sort<00:04:39.370> of<00:04:39.400> verse<00:04:40.360> free<00:04:40.780> and

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
so it's chorus to sort of verse free and

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.390 
so it's chorus to sort of verse free and
chorus<00:04:43.330> free<00:04:43.600> is<00:04:43.810> the<00:04:43.900> same<00:04:44.139> again<00:04:44.470> and<00:04:44.800> the

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 
chorus free is the same again and the

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.969 
chorus free is the same again and the
color<00:04:45.669> which<00:04:46.150> is<00:04:46.300> yellow<00:04:46.479> is<00:04:47.110> where<00:04:47.530> Jones<00:04:47.830> is

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:47.979 
color which is yellow is where Jones is

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:58.460 
color which is yellow is where Jones is
shouting<00:04:48.250> all<00:04:48.669> right<00:04:49.290> is<00:04:50.290> a<00:04:54.180> D<00:04:55.180> and<00:04:56.910> then<00:04:57.910> the

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470 
shouting all right is a D and then the

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:05.500 
shouting all right is a D and then the
velocity<00:04:59.470> is<00:04:59.530> just

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:05.510 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:10.110 

so<00:05:06.510> easily

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:10.120 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:17.710 

b-flat<00:05:11.919> it's<00:05:12.919> in<00:05:13.479> 4/3<00:05:14.479> a<00:05:14.509> secretary<00:05:16.330> and<00:05:17.330> an<00:05:17.539> to

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:17.720 
b-flat it's in 4/3 a secretary and an to

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:28.890 
b-flat it's in 4/3 a secretary and an to
ear

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:28.900 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:58.159 

so<00:05:29.900> the<00:05:30.830> outro<00:05:31.190> chorus<00:05:31.880> sounds<00:05:32.150> Irish

00:05:58.159 --> 00:05:58.169 

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:02.089 

and<00:05:59.169> that's<00:05:59.499> all<00:05:59.740> accord<00:06:00.340> you<00:06:00.400> need<00:06:00.580> for<00:06:00.789> it<00:06:00.879> I

00:06:02.089 --> 00:06:02.099 
and that's all accord you need for it I

00:06:02.099 --> 00:06:04.200 
and that's all accord you need for it I
probably<00:06:03.099> met<00:06:03.310> a<00:06:03.340> complete<00:06:03.729> balls<00:06:03.969> obviously

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:04.210 
probably met a complete balls obviously

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:05.969 
probably met a complete balls obviously
first<00:06:04.930> lesson<00:06:05.289> we're<00:06:05.409> not<00:06:05.560> actually<00:06:05.680> gets
