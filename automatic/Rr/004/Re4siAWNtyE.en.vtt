00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:05.950
 for girls today I'm going to 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:09.280
 teach this super fast routine 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:10.920
 so that it is so super fast will be 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:14.139
 in the morning you know is this makeup 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.820
 you want to stop and you do not want 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:17.529
 fix so much but you do not want either 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.349
 see as well as I think and I just got up 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:22.930
 and it's not like you need it the other one 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:24.460
 is applied to someone who does not know what 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:27.070
 is saying how of but you do not need 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.509
 put on makeup and me if I told him 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.000
 I do not, I do not, because I think that 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:32.680
 I need but because I like to do it or 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.940
 it is not like I can not leave without 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.770
 makeup of course of the post 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.230
 Christino here since I do not care but 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:40.690
 I like that as your moment in the 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.250
 tomorrow when you stop and get ready 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.930
 like that has a lot to do also with 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.940
 how do you feel all day like that 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.650
 good to me it happens to me that you serve as 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.760
 with more desire when you know that like that 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:52.160
 you put effort in you 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.859
 unlike if it only comes out super 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:58.190
 with the hurry and those are not summoned to 

00:00:54.859 --> 00:01:00.920
 I like how you started your day, but not 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:04.950
 good because I went astray so this is 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:07.600
 the tutorial for this 

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:10.119
 and yes, this is my little routine that 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.359
 I do the mornings lately that is like 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:15.520
 the autumn edition of my quick version 

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:18.340
 in the morning he runs to work runs to 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.810
 Where do you have to go this and well I hope 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.579
 that they like that they find me in the 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.319
 comments what are your routines in the 

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:26.049
 tomorrow that is with the skin can not leave 

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:27.570
 from your house if you do not get it and well let's 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:29.909
 start 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.190
 The first thing I'm going to do is put my 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.770
 favorite bicrim that is this meat and 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.910
 I'm going to put it with a brush because if 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.950
 I put it on with my hands again 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:40.680
 then I would have to wash my hands 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.570
 so in the couple is in rub 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.120
 so I prefer to apply it with a 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.830
 brush this one at a time and it is similar 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:51.010
 at 80 stigma 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:53.460
 then I will distribute it for all my 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.460
 face 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.530
 this will help us see a tone 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:00.750
 much more even in all the skin 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.570
 once without touch and once you have 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.790
 the statute a little more even you already see 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.459
 as more arranged as everything looks more 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:11.160
 in place since I applied that what 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.080
 next I do are and eyebrows with a 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.200
 transparent gel I'm going to comb my 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.450
 daughters are pretty simple are like 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.550
 bushy and dark 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.940
 then I really could only 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.130
 leave them like this 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.790
 and you can leave but when I have a 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.790
 little bit more time 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:33.590
 as I have a little more time I forget 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.010
 the rocha where she is animated wants 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.720
 my god puts a lot of makeup on my 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.340
 eyes prepares you I will define a 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.390
 little bit so they do not look like that either 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.390
 like the super eyebrows 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:50.750
 only fill the edges that is 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:52.610
 where it has to be a little clearer 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.760
 that surely only I see it 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:59.120
 someone else perform it as 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:02.409
 you know how we are after I'm going to take 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.409
 a little bit of base to amaze 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.580
 that's why I've done lately is 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.890
 use this shadow of the naked 3 that 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.380
 it is called a mole that is like purple 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:16.190
 and coffee 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:18.820
 and it roughly saturates it in my part 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.820
 eyelid mobile 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:25.760
 and then blurring up this is 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:28.270
 a super super loose brush is 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.270
 blur 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:34.290
 and it is already the only shadow that used this 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.209
 it's like 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.549
 the different ones because normally 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:39.959
 always, even if it's a natural look 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:41.400
 I use one clearer and no more obscure 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:43.290
 for the basin but lately about 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.909
 I been doing this and I really like 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.859
 as you see everything leaving the eyeliner 

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:49.620
 lately at night like that has 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:51.660
 liked that look a bit more as it is not 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.850
 less intense in the eyes 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:56.100
 and well I do it like this sometimes 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:58.200
 I even put on mascara and you 'll let me 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:02.190
 Well, my eyelashes are full and normal 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:03.240
 They are long and dense, so it's like 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:06.030
 I feel comfortable with my eyelashes 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:07.980
 increase but still if I want to give 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.840
 like a little bit more he just applied it 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.450
 on the banks 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:15.800
 this is the coex link of mobile and only 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.800
 I start by the shore 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.760
 and then we do not want him to stay 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.920
 like short eyelashes and then a super 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:25.770
 long then you activate two or three 

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:27.540
 layers and then nothing else I give a little 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:31.050
 more here so that it goes away that it is done thus 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:33.470
 as a volume gradient so that 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:36.890
 literary 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:39.530
 those that are to the center of my 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:41.330
 eyes those were not even enough that the 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:43.220
 first and below I do not wear anything 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:45.889
 later he used this blogs that I 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.240
 love for this season they are and they 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:49.759
 classic flame problems but equal the 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:52.340
 tows I know all the geos that 

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:54.740
 that's how coffee is, this is a 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:57.169
 little bit more orange like more brick 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:59.249
 and I really like the tone that they give to the 

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:01.300
 skin as very 

00:04:59.249 --> 00:05:04.150
 Charles 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:06.460
 and this I just put it not exactly 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:08.979
 like to outline or like blogs and not 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:10.500
 just to give it a little bit of color 

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:12.120
 to the face 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:14.400
 finally for the lips that is my 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:17.820
 favorite part depends sometimes I get 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:20.910
 a red lipstick when you're probably going 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:21.300
 to leave or something like this but this diary 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:25.210
 daily 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:29.319
 now been using this 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:31.260
 nix eyeliner that color is not pink and 

00:05:29.319 --> 00:05:35.160
 it's like in rosita 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:37.650
 like between rose and peach 

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:41.160
 martino is very strange but I 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:43.020
 I really like the color with that what I do 

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:45.240
 what I'm going to do is outline and 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:47.160
 fill all the lips 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:49.080
 this is going to help that elliptical that 

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.639
 I'm going to put in after I last longer so 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:53.660
 besides changing the color a little bit 

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:53.660
 just how I like it 

00:05:54.289 --> 00:05:57.139
 of line and queen and minister use 

00:05:56.149 --> 00:06:00.649
 this one that has become my 

00:05:57.139 --> 00:06:04.460
 favorites are called more than average of ten 

00:06:00.649 --> 00:06:07.009
 the sensation and maybelline colors 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:09.529
 pictures sensation and is this also like 

00:06:07.009 --> 00:06:12.680
 Mallow is among blackberry ready among pink 

00:06:09.529 --> 00:06:15.969
 but as I do not know I love this color 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.969
 it's perfect 

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:27.550
 and there it looked more pink 

00:06:25.449 --> 00:06:30.370
 but in person it looks like more moral 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:32.889
 everything looks at us like a little bit of this 

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:35.879
 like water spray or my fix plus 

00:06:32.889 --> 00:06:35.879
 to seal everything 

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:42.380
 and it lasts me all day and you look fixed 

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:44.720
 but it's not like I took years 

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:46.550
 in doing this now because I am 

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:49.090
 explaining but yes in the morning I 

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:51.310
 It will take six minutes to do it 

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:53.980
 and I really like how it looks then 

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:55.510
 I hope you liked this video and 

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:57.130

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:58.510
