00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
you guys coming to you with a quick tip

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.450 
you guys coming to you with a quick tip
today<00:00:03.540> in<00:00:04.290> identifying<00:00:04.890> the<00:00:05.160> difference

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
today in identifying the difference

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.059 
today in identifying the difference
between<00:00:05.549> a<00:00:06.060> reference<00:00:07.049> and<00:00:07.290> a<00:00:07.410> non<00:00:07.649> reference

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
between a reference and a non reference

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.839 
between a reference and a non reference

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
five six and seven series as far as I'm

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.869 
five six and seven series as far as I'm
aware<00:00:54.680> then<00:00:55.680> there's<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.160> non<00:00:56.550> reference

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
aware then there's the non reference

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.660 
aware then there's the non reference
cards<00:00:57.180> as<00:00:57.300> you<00:00:57.420> see<00:00:57.629> on<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.960> left<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:59.070> these

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
cards as you see on the left and these

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.520 
cards as you see on the left and these
are<00:00:59.910> produced<00:01:00.420> by<00:01:00.570> other<00:01:00.719> brands<00:01:00.989> such<00:01:01.170> as<00:01:01.230> X

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
are produced by other brands such as X

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:08.330 
are produced by other brands such as X
yes<00:01:02.359> so<00:01:03.359> XFX<00:01:04.129> set<00:01:05.129> by<00:01:05.309> Cuba<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.950> many<00:01:07.950> others

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
yes so XFX set by Cuba and many others

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.109 
yes so XFX set by Cuba and many others
and<00:01:09.320> these<00:01:10.320> companies<00:01:10.740> look<00:01:10.920> to<00:01:10.950> improve<00:01:11.640> on

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
and these companies look to improve on

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.200 
and these companies look to improve on
the<00:01:12.330> edge<00:01:12.570> their<00:01:12.840> products<00:01:13.200> often<00:01:13.950> so<00:01:14.909> use<00:01:15.090> of

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
the edge their products often so use of

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.550 
the edge their products often so use of
different<00:01:15.450> colors<00:01:15.869> and<00:01:15.900> different<00:01:16.080> clock

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
different colors and different clock

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.880 
different colors and different clock
speeds<00:01:16.920> and<00:01:17.540> whatnot<00:01:18.540> just<00:01:19.380> generally

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
speeds and whatnot just generally

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.770 
speeds and whatnot just generally
looking<00:01:20.130> to<00:01:20.280> improve<00:01:20.700> it<00:01:20.909> in<00:01:21.090> as<00:01:21.360> many<00:01:21.509> ways<00:01:21.720> as

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
looking to improve it in as many ways as

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.310 
looking to improve it in as many ways as
possible<00:01:23.180> so<00:01:24.180> you<00:01:24.210> can<00:01:24.299> often<00:01:24.659> identify<00:01:24.869> this

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
possible so you can often identify this

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.980 
possible so you can often identify this
by<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.650> different<00:01:26.100> cool<00:01:26.670> obviously<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:27.750> if

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
by the different cool obviously and if

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:34.249 
by the different cool obviously and if
you<00:01:28.110> bring<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.729> brand<00:01:29.729> name<00:01:32.750> in<00:01:33.750> terms<00:01:34.049> of

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
you bring the brand name in terms of

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.130 
you bring the brand name in terms of
price<00:01:34.829> when<00:01:35.130> you're<00:01:35.250> buying<00:01:35.430> it<00:01:35.700> these<00:01:36.540> are

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
price when you're buying it these are

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.749 
price when you're buying it these are
non<00:01:37.320> reference<00:01:37.650> cars<00:01:37.860> often<00:01:38.220> going<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:38.670> be

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
non reference cars often going to be

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.550 
non reference cars often going to be
more<00:01:38.909> expensive<00:01:38.970> because<00:01:39.570> they<00:01:39.900> can<00:01:40.079> often

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
more expensive because they can often

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.630 
more expensive because they can often
perform<00:01:40.920> better

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
perform better

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.110 
perform better
terms<00:01:42.790> of<00:01:43.000> both<00:01:43.240> clock<00:01:43.960> speeds<00:01:44.290> and<00:01:44.530> cool<00:01:45.130> car

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:46.120 
terms of both clock speeds and cool car

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:51.000 
terms of both clock speeds and cool car
interlink<00:01:47.100> together<00:01:49.530> there<00:01:50.530> for<00:01:50.740> something

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.010 
interlink together there for something

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.040 
interlink together there for something
like<00:01:51.130> bitcoin<00:01:51.580> light<00:01:51.790> or<00:01:52.270> light<00:01:52.510> brown<00:01:52.720> line

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.050 
like bitcoin light or light brown line

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:54.750 
like bitcoin light or light brown line
you're<00:01:54.010> probably<00:01:54.190> going<00:01:54.369> to<00:01:54.430> get<00:01:54.520> a<00:01:54.580> better

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:54.760 
you're probably going to get a better

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.460 
you're probably going to get a better
performance<00:01:55.300> from<00:01:55.330> the<00:01:55.690> new<00:01:55.810> reference<00:01:56.140> cards

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.470 
performance from the new reference cards

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.530 
performance from the new reference cards
however<00:01:57.040> the<00:01:57.159> reference<00:01:57.490> cards<00:01:57.880> too<00:02:00.540> so

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:01.540 
however the reference cards too so

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.050 
however the reference cards too so
that's<00:02:01.690> the<00:02:02.080> Texas<00:02:02.740> today<00:02:02.920> I<00:02:03.040> hope<00:02:03.280> hope<00:02:03.910> you

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
that's the Texas today I hope hope you

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.970 
that's the Texas today I hope hope you
learn<00:02:04.240> something<00:02:05.700> see<00:02:06.700> you<00:02:06.759> later
