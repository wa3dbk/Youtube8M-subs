00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 hello everyone how are you 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.310
 redistribute them more days and runes of 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.140
 etxerat that had not entered 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.550
 more trias and runes but I do not forget about 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.860
 this section that dry like and you 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.059
 it helped a lot of you so nothing 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.309
 Today I bring you the masters of etxerat 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.780
 because you gave me a little bit this is 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.600
 a character that can be used the 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.119
 half only a cigar is butt seen 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.160
 but they have not served anything and it has 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.539
 very much very much very much useful and 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.490
 a pretty high damage when it swells 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.689
 a little bit so nothing eating a little 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.220
 the three more that we save the ones that we have 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.109
 over here and you're going to see that it's a 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.090
 great character we started with 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.100
 attack is a 21 we put one in doubles 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.719
 faced the edge since as was the 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.219
 be at a distance and having so much 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.629
 rank with most of your skills 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.219
 is not going to get close to the enemies 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.410
 do not suffer much therefore this does not see 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.180
 very very good to do more damage all the 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.399
 ape roll is witchcraft force 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.690
 closest mental and archi magician this 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.280
 we have more cooling in everything 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.870
 this we have do more damage 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.129
 a butcher point to make them do 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.129
 more harm than basic attacks and 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.300
 executor spells and dangerous game for 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.800
 do more damage than the 50 game by 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.840
 cent to heal us when we kill and 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.500
 Arcane blade to do magic damage 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.330
 with our powers to the basic arts 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.730
 two devastating cup points and one 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.780
 Havoc simply advances year this 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:10.790
 what to provoke with chehade is that 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.410
 let's do a lot of damage a lot 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.780
 very much damage we can burst the 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:15.830
 enemies enough easily enough 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.090
 on the part of the utility we are not going to 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.470
 put nothing in defense because of the fact 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.000
 who wants has so much rank that in 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.250
 theory if you play well with him you are going to 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.810
 touch little you will kill yourself but count 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.580
 with a tank or quite pretty well 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.770
 how can you shoot from so far 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.990
 he has the air he shoots from his house 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.910
 and of the roll because it is not necessary that 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.800
 let's put things in defense good but 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:35.390
 utility because it was going better we lose 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.979
 three points in a thousand feet to get 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.290
 before to move faster so 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:40.970
 so much we can go the base and get before 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.860
 that line have more present in the line 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.590
 meditation for the sister because it will be 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.960
 consume bad as a condemned yes as 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.550
 the manager or drink directly a 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.470
 Fortress fired for the generation 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.060
 of life in case the flies an application 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.530
 invoker by the typical uy ten 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.110
 seconds for flash and 5 to learn 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.149
 widgets for the barrier by the typical and 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.340
 a point of aronic so that the blue us 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:02.750
 last longer on the part of the wheels as 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.729
 we see here we have red debugging 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.410
 magic to do more damage yellow from 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:08.269
 mana regeneration because we put 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:09.280
 these as I said he consumes mana like 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:12.430
 a miserable 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:15.550
 and if we combine is with this we will have 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.170
 a lot of extra blue manna mante 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.400
 after opening where more damage 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.260
 quintessence of probability to do 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.610
 even more damage so nothing you guys are 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.990
 they are the masters they serve a light 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.800
 I hope you liked the video and 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.800
 until next time
