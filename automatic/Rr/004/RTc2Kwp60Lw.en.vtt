00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:26.300 
the app it is about this point this guy

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.850 
the app it is about this point this guy
would<00:01:26.600> have<00:01:26.720> been<00:01:26.900> on<00:01:27.050> here<00:01:27.380> concealer<00:01:27.800> to

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
would have been on here concealer to

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.240 
would have been on here concealer to
slow<00:01:28.040> down<00:01:28.370> to<00:01:29.150> the<00:01:29.270> point<00:01:29.600> and<00:01:29.980> pull<00:01:30.980> either

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
slow down to the point and pull either

slow down to the point and pull either
that<00:01:31.310> or<00:01:31.490> the<00:01:31.970> safety<00:01:32.240> over<00:01:32.720> here<00:01:33.020> which<00:01:33.980> i

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
that or the safety over here which i

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.760 
that or the safety over here which i
think<00:01:34.190> is<00:01:34.580> an<00:01:34.700> expanding<00:01:35.330> or<00:01:35.600> no<00:01:36.110> Clark<00:01:36.470> my<00:01:36.620> bag

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.850 
think is an expanding or no Clark my bag
family<00:01:37.220> 19<00:01:37.640> which<00:01:38.210> is<00:01:38.330> Clark<00:01:38.600> on<00:01:39.410> would<00:01:39.770> have

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
family 19 which is Clark on would have

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:41.980 
family 19 which is Clark on would have
got<00:01:40.130> up<00:01:40.370> here<00:01:40.580> closer<00:01:40.850> cuz<00:01:41.270> Alexia<00:01:41.630> to<00:01:41.750> slow

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
got up here closer cuz Alexia to slow

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.110 
got up here closer cuz Alexia to slow
down<00:01:42.260> and<00:01:42.830> would<00:01:43.070> hit<00:01:43.280> them<00:01:43.400> and<00:01:43.550> pop<00:01:43.760> the<00:01:43.910> ball

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:44.120
