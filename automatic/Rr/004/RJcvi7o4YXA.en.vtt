00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.819 
many years with a pair of rabbits my
rabbits<00:01:39.000> got<00:01:39.119> so<00:01:39.540> used<00:01:39.840> to<00:01:39.990> my<00:01:40.200> habit<00:01:40.650> of

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
rabbits got so used to my habit of

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.620 
rabbits got so used to my habit of
rattling<00:01:41.280> their<00:01:41.490> pellets<00:01:41.909> and<00:01:42.060> then<00:01:42.210> serving

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
rattling their pellets and then serving

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.469 
rattling their pellets and then serving
them<00:01:42.750> right<00:01:42.930> after<00:01:43.290> that<00:01:43.979> if<00:01:44.340> I<00:01:44.549> didn't<00:01:45.000> appear

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
them right after that if I didn't appear

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.569 
them right after that if I didn't appear
at<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:45.899> right<00:01:46.079> time<00:01:46.380> they<00:01:46.860> would<00:01:47.100> jump<00:01:47.340> into

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
at the right time they would jump into

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.429 
at the right time they would jump into
their<00:01:47.729> cage<00:01:47.939> spontaneously<00:01:48.810> on<00:01:49.049> their<00:01:49.290> own

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
their cage spontaneously on their own

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.560 
their cage spontaneously on their own
and<00:01:49.710> then<00:01:50.189> lean<00:01:50.490> their<00:01:50.700> little<00:01:50.909> heads<00:01:51.119> out<00:01:51.360> as

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
and then lean their little heads out as

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.719 
and then lean their little heads out as
if<00:01:51.869> to<00:01:52.020> say<00:01:52.200> to<00:01:52.259> me<00:01:52.439> we're<00:01:52.710> here<00:01:53.009> where<00:01:53.340> are<00:01:53.520> you

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
if to say to me we're here where are you

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.420 
if to say to me we're here where are you
in<00:01:54.390> other<00:01:54.630> words<00:01:54.869> I<00:01:55.049> no<00:01:55.170> longer<00:01:55.500> had<00:01:55.860> to<00:01:55.890> rattle

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
in other words I no longer had to rattle

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.920 
in other words I no longer had to rattle
them<00:01:56.549> after<00:01:56.880> a<00:01:56.909> while<00:01:57.090> because<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.570> rabbits

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
them after a while because the rabbits

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.719 
them after a while because the rabbits
were<00:01:58.049> so<00:01:58.350> used<00:01:58.590> to<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.860> schedule<00:01:59.310> they<00:01:59.490> knew

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
were so used to the schedule they knew

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.609 
were so used to the schedule they knew
ahead<00:02:00.000> of<00:02:00.210> time<00:02:00.540> when<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.110> rattling<00:02:01.439> was

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
ahead of time when the rattling was

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.109 
ahead of time when the rattling was
supposed<00:02:01.890> to<00:02:01.950> happen<00:02:02.130> and<00:02:02.399> they<00:02:02.610> would<00:02:02.790> remind

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
supposed to happen and they would remind

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.510 
supposed to happen and they would remind
me<00:02:03.329> it<00:02:03.810> was<00:02:04.020> very<00:02:04.200> funny<00:02:04.530> but<00:02:05.040> this<00:02:05.189> is<00:02:05.340> a<00:02:05.369> good

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
me it was very funny but this is a good

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.130 
me it was very funny but this is a good
way<00:02:05.670> to<00:02:05.700> get<00:02:05.909> a<00:02:05.939> rabbit<00:02:06.119> back<00:02:06.420> into<00:02:06.659> a<00:02:06.689> cage<00:02:06.899> any

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
way to get a rabbit back into a cage any

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.080
