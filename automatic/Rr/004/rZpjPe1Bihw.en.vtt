these<00:01:56.040> bad<00:01:56.280> fats<00:01:56.579> if<00:01:56.790> you<00:01:56.880> like<00:01:57.000> in<00:01:57.149> our<00:01:57.270> diet

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
these bad fats if you like in our diet

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.539 
these bad fats if you like in our diet
because<00:01:57.840> these<00:01:58.380> are<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:58.680> fats<00:01:58.920> that<00:01:59.159> actually

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
because these are the fats that actually

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.139 
because these are the fats that actually
store<00:02:00.240> fat<00:02:00.479> on<00:02:00.630> your<00:02:00.750> body<00:02:01.020> okay<00:02:01.409> and<00:02:02.149> the

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
store fat on your body okay and the

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.999 
store fat on your body okay and the
reason<00:02:03.479> why<00:02:03.600> coconut<00:02:04.229> oil<00:02:04.380> is<00:02:04.500> so<00:02:04.680> good

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
reason why coconut oil is so good

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.520 
reason why coconut oil is so good
despite<00:02:06.000> what<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.479> the<00:02:06.930> vegetable<00:02:07.380> oil

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
despite what the the vegetable oil

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.160 
despite what the the vegetable oil
industry<00:02:07.979> would<00:02:08.160> claim<00:02:08.340> it<00:02:08.399> is<00:02:08.869> due<00:02:09.869> to<00:02:10.020> its

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
industry would claim it is due to its

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.670 
industry would claim it is due to its
chemical<00:02:10.649> structure<00:02:11.120> all<00:02:12.120> fats<00:02:12.690> are<00:02:12.900> actually

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
chemical structure all fats are actually

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.679 
chemical structure all fats are actually
made<00:02:13.890> up<00:02:14.040> of<00:02:14.159> fatty<00:02:14.430> acids<00:02:14.879> okay<00:02:15.239> so<00:02:15.299> whether

00:02:15.679 --> 00:02:15.689 
made up of fatty acids okay so whether

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:18.229 
made up of fatty acids okay so whether
it's<00:02:15.930> Lord<00:02:16.290> whether<00:02:16.980> it's<00:02:17.189> oils<00:02:17.760> whether<00:02:18.030> it's

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
it's Lord whether it's oils whether it's

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:20.420 
it's Lord whether it's oils whether it's
hard<00:02:18.510> at<00:02:18.689> room<00:02:18.870> temperature<00:02:19.439> or<00:02:19.650> liquid<00:02:20.310> at

what<00:02:23.430> we<00:02:23.549> call<00:02:23.760> fatty<00:02:24.060> acids<00:02:24.510> and<00:02:24.799> the<00:02:25.799> fatty

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
what we call fatty acids and the fatty

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.399 
what we call fatty acids and the fatty
acids<00:02:26.459> are<00:02:26.609> also<00:02:26.760> comprised<00:02:27.480> of<00:02:27.750> something

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:28.409 
acids are also comprised of something

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:30.979 
acids are also comprised of something
what<00:02:28.560> we<00:02:28.680> call<00:02:28.890> triglycerides<00:02:29.879> of<00:02:30.090> key<00:02:30.269> and

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
what we call triglycerides of key and

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:34.429 
what we call triglycerides of key and
what<00:02:31.349> this<00:02:31.469> basically<00:02:31.680> means<00:02:32.159> is<00:02:32.629> how<00:02:33.629> the

00:02:34.429 --> 00:02:34.439 
what this basically means is how the

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:37.629 
what this basically means is how the
structure<00:02:34.799> of<00:02:35.159> the<00:02:35.909> fatty<00:02:36.209> acid<00:02:36.569> is<00:02:36.689> comprised

structure of the fatty acid is comprised

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:40.009 
structure of the fatty acid is comprised
determines<00:02:38.639> exactly<00:02:38.790> how<00:02:39.389> your<00:02:39.629> body<00:02:39.870> will

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
determines exactly how your body will

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:41.089 
determines exactly how your body will
deal<00:02:40.200> with<00:02:40.230> that<00:02:40.560> fat

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
deal with that fat

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:45.500 
deal with that fat
for<00:02:41.760> example<00:02:42.980> vegetable<00:02:43.980> oils<00:02:44.280> so<00:02:45.060> that<00:02:45.389> the

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
for example vegetable oils so that the

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.440 
for example vegetable oils so that the
fat<00:02:45.689> storing<00:02:46.139> ones<00:02:46.349> are<00:02:47.000> comprised<00:02:48.000> of<00:02:48.209> what

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
fat storing ones are comprised of what

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.280 
fat storing ones are comprised of what
we<00:02:48.599> call<00:02:48.810> long<00:02:49.139> chain<00:02:49.500> triglycerides<00:02:50.459> and

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
we call long chain triglycerides and

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.659 
we call long chain triglycerides and
what<00:02:52.290> this<00:02:52.470> actually<00:02:52.680> does<00:02:52.889> when<00:02:53.340> you<00:02:53.430> body

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:53.669 
what this actually does when you body

00:02:53.669 --> 00:02:55.640 
what this actually does when you body
consumes<00:02:54.329> it<00:02:54.659> actually<00:02:54.989> takes<00:02:55.200> a<00:02:55.409> long<00:02:55.620> time

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
consumes it actually takes a long time

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.399 
consumes it actually takes a long time
to<00:02:56.040> digest<00:02:56.459> okay<00:02:57.329> and<00:02:57.450> we<00:02:57.540> take<00:02:57.750> a<00:02:57.780> long<00:02:58.109> time

00:02:58.399 --> 00:02:58.409 
to digest okay and we take a long time

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:00.890 
to digest okay and we take a long time
to<00:02:58.590> metabolize<00:02:58.950> these<00:02:59.430> due<00:03:00.180> to<00:03:00.359> the<00:03:00.450> chemical

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
to metabolize these due to the chemical

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.709 
to metabolize these due to the chemical
structure<00:03:01.349> okay<00:03:01.799> do<00:03:02.069> the<00:03:02.280> length<00:03:02.489> of<00:03:02.700> the<00:03:03.689> the

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:03.719 
structure okay do the length of the the

00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:08.539 
structure okay do the length of the the
fatty<00:03:04.079> acids<00:03:05.480> contain<00:03:06.480> within<00:03:06.750> so<00:03:07.560> what<00:03:08.400> your

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 
fatty acids contain within so what your

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:10.580 
fatty acids contain within so what your
body<00:03:08.730> does<00:03:08.849> if<00:03:09.180> it<00:03:09.299> can't<00:03:09.590> metabolize

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
body does if it can't metabolize

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.490 
body does if it can't metabolize
something<00:03:11.159> quickly<00:03:11.430> you<00:03:11.969> know<00:03:12.120> and<00:03:12.349> digest<00:03:13.349> it

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
something quickly you know and digest it

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.770 
something quickly you know and digest it
then<00:03:13.650> I'll<00:03:13.769> just<00:03:13.980> store<00:03:14.189> any<00:03:14.430> fat<00:03:14.669> stores<00:03:15.030> so

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
then I'll just store any fat stores so

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.330 
then I'll just store any fat stores so
if<00:03:15.840> you<00:03:15.959> keep<00:03:16.109> eating<00:03:16.260> this<00:03:16.530> bad<00:03:16.739> vegetable

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
if you keep eating this bad vegetable

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.280 
if you keep eating this bad vegetable
oil<00:03:17.489> then<00:03:18.060> you're<00:03:18.540> just<00:03:18.629> gonna<00:03:18.840> keep<00:03:19.049> putting

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
oil then you're just gonna keep putting

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:20.750 
oil then you're just gonna keep putting
fat<00:03:19.620> and<00:03:19.739> your<00:03:19.829> fat<00:03:20.010> stores<00:03:20.159> all<00:03:20.489> the<00:03:20.519> time

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
fat and your fat stores all the time

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.119 
fat and your fat stores all the time
okay<00:03:21.329> so<00:03:21.989> what<00:03:22.109> we<00:03:22.229> need<00:03:22.349> to<00:03:22.379> do<00:03:22.560> is<00:03:22.709> take<00:03:22.919> out

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:23.129 
okay so what we need to do is take out

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:25.099 
okay so what we need to do is take out
your<00:03:23.250> veg<00:03:23.430> blood<00:03:23.790> completely<00:03:24.419> yeah

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:25.109 
your veg blood completely yeah

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:26.780 
your veg blood completely yeah
even<00:03:25.379> olive<00:03:25.590> oil<00:03:25.799> get<00:03:25.949> too<00:03:26.099> toxic<00:03:26.310> at<00:03:26.639> high

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
even olive oil get too toxic at high

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.009 
even olive oil get too toxic at high
temperatures<00:03:27.359> and<00:03:27.680> it<00:03:28.680> doesn't<00:03:29.010> contain<00:03:29.430> the

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:30.019 
temperatures and it doesn't contain the

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:32.539 
temperatures and it doesn't contain the
sort<00:03:31.019> of<00:03:31.109> the<00:03:31.349> fatty<00:03:31.560> acid<00:03:31.919> content<00:03:32.159> that

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
sort of the fatty acid content that

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:34.099 
sort of the fatty acid content that
would<00:03:32.639> give<00:03:32.819> you<00:03:32.939> sufficient<00:03:33.299> fat<00:03:33.930> loss

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:34.109 
would give you sufficient fat loss

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:36.830 
would give you sufficient fat loss
benefits<00:03:34.400> so<00:03:35.400> you<00:03:36.120> need<00:03:36.269> to<00:03:36.359> get<00:03:36.479> rid<00:03:36.629> of<00:03:36.659> all

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
benefits so you need to get rid of all

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.830 
benefits so you need to get rid of all
of<00:03:36.870> them<00:03:37.139> from<00:03:37.470> the<00:03:37.530> teat<00:03:37.769> okay<00:03:38.069> and<00:03:38.689> start<00:03:39.689> and

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
of them from the teat okay and start and

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.229 
of them from the teat okay and start and
use<00:03:39.989> coconut<00:03:40.290> oil<00:03:40.530> and<00:03:41.040> the<00:03:41.489> reason<00:03:41.790> coconut

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
use coconut oil and the reason coconut

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:44.960 
use coconut oil and the reason coconut
oil<00:03:42.359> is<00:03:42.419> so<00:03:42.629> good<00:03:42.900> is<00:03:43.139> as<00:03:43.650> we<00:03:44.250> said<00:03:44.430> vegetable

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
oil is so good is as we said vegetable

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.629 
oil is so good is as we said vegetable
oils<00:03:45.209> are<00:03:45.299> actually<00:03:45.659> comprised<00:03:46.530> of<00:03:46.769> long

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:47.639 
oils are actually comprised of long

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:49.849 
oils are actually comprised of long
chain<00:03:47.909> triglycerides<00:03:48.409> okay<00:03:49.409> so<00:03:49.470> they've<00:03:49.739> got

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:49.859 
chain triglycerides okay so they've got

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:51.770 
chain triglycerides okay so they've got
quite<00:03:50.069> long<00:03:50.370> chemical<00:03:51.239> structure<00:03:51.629> if<00:03:51.720> you

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
quite long chemical structure if you

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.619 
quite long chemical structure if you
like<00:03:51.989> and<00:03:52.970> coconut<00:03:53.970> oil<00:03:54.030> on<00:03:54.180> the<00:03:54.299> other<00:03:54.329> hand

00:03:54.619 --> 00:03:54.629 
like and coconut oil on the other hand

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:57.050 
like and coconut oil on the other hand
it's<00:03:54.810> actually<00:03:54.959> comprised<00:03:55.620> of<00:03:55.889> medium<00:03:56.819> and

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
it's actually comprised of medium and

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.140 
it's actually comprised of medium and
short<00:03:57.090> chain<00:03:57.930> triglycerides<00:03:58.909> so<00:03:59.909> what<00:04:00.030> this

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
short chain triglycerides so what this

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.629 
short chain triglycerides so what this
means<00:04:00.209> is<00:04:00.659> that<00:04:01.049> our<00:04:01.259> body<00:04:01.650> metabolizes<00:04:02.340> this

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:02.639 
means is that our body metabolizes this

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:04.759 
means is that our body metabolizes this
much<00:04:02.909> quicker<00:04:03.180> and<00:04:03.479> we<00:04:03.840> digest<00:04:04.349> this<00:04:04.530> much

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
much quicker and we digest this much

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:07.369 
much quicker and we digest this much
quicker<00:04:05.040> and<00:04:05.599> instead<00:04:06.599> of<00:04:06.720> swimming<00:04:07.290> around

00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:07.379 
quicker and instead of swimming around

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:08.990 
quicker and instead of swimming around
and<00:04:07.709> certainly<00:04:07.949> and<00:04:08.340> then<00:04:08.430> you<00:04:08.519> bloodstream

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
and certainly and then you bloodstream

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.539 
and certainly and then you bloodstream
packed<00:04:09.870> in<00:04:10.049> the<00:04:10.139> lipoproteins<00:04:11.040> like<00:04:11.370> your

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:11.549 
packed in the lipoproteins like your

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:13.909 
packed in the lipoproteins like your
vegetable<00:04:11.939> oils<00:04:12.180> do<00:04:12.379> coconut<00:04:13.379> oils<00:04:13.590> actually

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:13.919 
vegetable oils do coconut oils actually

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:15.800 
vegetable oils do coconut oils actually
send<00:04:14.129> straight<00:04:14.489> in<00:04:14.579> the<00:04:14.699> eleven<00:04:15.030> and<00:04:15.180> you<00:04:15.239> live

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
send straight in the eleven and you live

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.569 
send straight in the eleven and you live
actually<00:04:16.019> converted<00:04:16.829> into<00:04:16.979> a<00:04:17.159> carbohydrate

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 
actually converted into a carbohydrate

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:20.899 
actually converted into a carbohydrate
like<00:04:18.440> substance<00:04:19.440> if<00:04:19.799> you<00:04:19.919> like<00:04:20.070> to<00:04:20.340> be<00:04:20.459> used<00:04:20.699> as

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:20.909 
like substance if you like to be used as

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:23.450 
like substance if you like to be used as
energy<00:04:21.329> however<00:04:22.139> it<00:04:22.680> has<00:04:22.950> a<00:04:22.979> negligible

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
energy however it has a negligible

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.540 
energy however it has a negligible
effect<00:04:24.240> on<00:04:24.389> your<00:04:24.539> blood<00:04:24.630> sugar

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
effect on your blood sugar

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.270 
effect on your blood sugar
so<00:04:26.060> what<00:04:26.960> that<00:04:26.990> basically<00:04:27.139> means<00:04:27.590> is<00:04:27.860> you<00:04:28.039> need

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
so what that basically means is you need

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.640 
so what that basically means is you need
a<00:04:28.340> lot<00:04:28.580> of<00:04:28.729> coconut<00:04:29.150> oil<00:04:29.240> and<00:04:29.539> you'll<00:04:30.440> get<00:04:30.590> a

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
a lot of coconut oil and you'll get a

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.980 
a lot of coconut oil and you'll get a
lot<00:04:31.009> of<00:04:31.129> benefits<00:04:31.610> with<00:04:31.819> the<00:04:31.940> energy<00:04:32.270> okay<00:04:32.930> so

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:32.990 
lot of benefits with the energy okay so

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:35.290 
lot of benefits with the energy okay so
the<00:04:33.229> more<00:04:33.410> the<00:04:33.770> more<00:04:33.919> you<00:04:33.979> eat<00:04:34.300> technically

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
the more the more you eat technically

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:36.939 
the more the more you eat technically
the<00:04:35.569> bad<00:04:35.720> energy<00:04:35.900> but<00:04:36.319> again<00:04:36.530> because<00:04:36.770> you're

00:04:36.939 --> 00:04:36.949 
the bad energy but again because you're

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:38.680 
the bad energy but again because you're
going<00:04:37.129> to<00:04:37.190> be<00:04:37.280> getting<00:04:37.460> extra<00:04:38.240> energy<00:04:38.360> not

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:38.690 
going to be getting extra energy not

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:40.240 
going to be getting extra energy not
only<00:04:38.750> from<00:04:39.139> your<00:04:39.229> carbohydrates<00:04:39.949> that<00:04:40.129> you

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.250 
only from your carbohydrates that you

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:42.070 
only from your carbohydrates that you
use<00:04:40.400> them<00:04:40.550> you<00:04:40.759> know<00:04:41.180> all<00:04:41.330> day<00:04:41.539> and<00:04:41.659> every<00:04:41.870> food

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
use them you know all day and every food

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.330 
use them you know all day and every food
anyway<00:04:42.440> we're<00:04:42.620> also<00:04:42.770> going<00:04:43.069> to<00:04:43.129> be<00:04:43.220> getting

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
anyway we're also going to be getting

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.939 
anyway we're also going to be getting
this<00:04:43.520> good<00:04:43.789> fat<00:04:44.060> which<00:04:44.599> your<00:04:44.750> body's<00:04:45.020> treats

00:04:45.939 --> 00:04:45.949 
this good fat which your body's treats

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:48.010 
this good fat which your body's treats
like<00:04:46.220> a<00:04:46.250> carbohydrate<00:04:46.970> or<00:04:47.389> like<00:04:47.539> an<00:04:47.690> energy

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020 
like a carbohydrate or like an energy

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.350 
like a carbohydrate or like an energy
source<00:04:48.259> because<00:04:49.159> it<00:04:49.280> metabolizes<00:04:49.610> are<00:04:50.150> very

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 
source because it metabolizes are very

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.469 
source because it metabolizes are very
quickly<00:04:50.629> okay<00:04:51.110> so<00:04:52.120> what<00:04:53.120> this<00:04:53.300> basically

00:04:53.469 --> 00:04:53.479 
quickly okay so what this basically

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:56.200 
quickly okay so what this basically
means<00:04:53.840> is<00:04:54.169> that<00:04:54.229> if<00:04:54.590> you<00:04:55.370> start<00:04:55.430> using<00:04:55.819> coconut

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.210 
means is that if you start using coconut

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:58.120 
means is that if you start using coconut
oil<00:04:56.479> now<00:04:56.750> and<00:04:57.050> you<00:04:57.349> remove<00:04:57.710> all<00:04:57.979> the

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.130 
oil now and you remove all the

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:00.309 
oil now and you remove all the
vegetables<00:04:58.849> then<00:04:59.360> you're<00:04:59.930> going<00:05:00.050> to<00:05:00.110> boost

00:05:00.309 --> 00:05:00.319 
vegetables then you're going to boost

00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:01.689 
vegetables then you're going to boost
your<00:05:00.470> metabolism<00:05:00.530> on<00:05:01.190> average<00:05:01.490> by<00:05:01.669> about

00:05:01.689 --> 00:05:01.699 
your metabolism on average by about

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:04.510 
your metabolism on average by about
forty<00:05:02.330> percent<00:05:02.680> which<00:05:03.680> basically<00:05:04.099> means<00:05:04.400> that

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:04.520 
forty percent which basically means that

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:05.770 
forty percent which basically means that
you're<00:05:04.669> going<00:05:04.849> to<00:05:04.909> be<00:05:05.000> burning<00:05:05.389> calories<00:05:05.419> I

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:05.780 
you're going to be burning calories I

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:07.839 
you're going to be burning calories I
had<00:05:06.080> to<00:05:06.169> create<00:05:06.409> an<00:05:06.590> efficiency<00:05:07.190> okay<00:05:07.490> which

00:05:07.839 --> 00:05:07.849 
had to create an efficiency okay which

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:10.899 
had to create an efficiency okay which
means<00:05:07.880> you're<00:05:08.330> gonna<00:05:08.479> lose<00:05:08.690> fat<00:05:08.990> and<00:05:09.699> you<00:05:10.699> can

00:05:10.899 --> 00:05:10.909 
means you're gonna lose fat and you can

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:13.330 
means you're gonna lose fat and you can
eat<00:05:11.120> an<00:05:11.389> awful<00:05:11.599> lot<00:05:11.900> of<00:05:11.930> coconut<00:05:12.440> oil<00:05:12.530> and<00:05:12.830> it's

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:13.340 
eat an awful lot of coconut oil and it's

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:15.399 
eat an awful lot of coconut oil and it's
seldom<00:05:13.639> ends<00:05:13.940> up<00:05:14.150> and<00:05:14.270> your<00:05:14.360> fats<00:05:14.569> gone<00:05:14.810> so<00:05:15.139> it

00:05:15.399 --> 00:05:15.409 
seldom ends up and your fats gone so it

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:17.110 
seldom ends up and your fats gone so it
very<00:05:15.680> rarely<00:05:15.979> ends<00:05:16.370> up<00:05:16.580> in<00:05:16.699> your<00:05:16.729> fat<00:05:16.969> stores

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.120 
very rarely ends up in your fat stores

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.260 
very rarely ends up in your fat stores
so<00:05:17.810> start<00:05:18.710> using<00:05:18.889> it<00:05:19.130> a<00:05:19.219> day<00:05:19.400> start<00:05:19.759> hammer<00:05:20.030> net
