00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:10.299
 Hello everyone in this video, I will show you how 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:13.150
 determine whether collapsible or not you should 

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:15.750
 shock absorber I'll show it on shot 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:19.990
 Racks here I have two shock absorbers 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:24.360
 all this can be done by car not 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:27.520
 taking off the rack there is learn collapsible no 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:33.420
 no need to take a stand for us 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:36.180
 you need to whip this protective nut 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:41.290
 in order to bring it down it is necessary 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:45.460
 screwdriver or something like that 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:54.480
 her under this nut and gavel 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:54.480
 we knock and as you see on it easily slazit 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:00.540
 this shock absorber is no longer valid 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.810
 Wipe that was all the more evident 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.810
 visually 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.430
 as seen 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:45.250
 there is no nut here 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:48.820
 specifically that could shut off 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.410
 here everything is rolled and that is this 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.640
 non-separable shock absorber 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:58.270
 it certainly can be disassembled spiller 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:01.840
 Bulgarian and 10 then thread do making 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:04.720
 then nut so you can tighten but this 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:07.780
 as if going non-separable, that is, there is no 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:16.750
 no nuts here everything is rolled up and go 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:20.350
 further will be less obvious because 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:23.370
 Rack did not begin to disassemble the principle of all but 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:37.330
 everything will also be seen 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:45.130
 beat the protective nut drank and and look 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:47.400
 here I hope there will be seen here as 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.400
 you see 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:03:02.690
 there is such a nut for specials 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:06.800
 key with dredging 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:08.930
 and an internal thread is inserted here 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.480
 keys and floor and turns 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:14.150
 the nut for unscrewing the shock can 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.220
 will disassemble this shock absorber 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:22.490
 collapsible i.e. it can be disassembled 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:28.760
 fix pump up principle still again 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:34.480
 let's see if you have these grooves 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:39.500
 nothing like that means you 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:42.640
 damper molded as you can see this 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.640
 can be disassembled 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:52.500
 these two racks from the car were removed from 1 1 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:54.930
 turned out folding another nonseparable 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:04:02.599
 maybe one of these maybe one of 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:07.580
 these shock absorbers changed everything 

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:07.580
 I think someone will be useful to all for now
