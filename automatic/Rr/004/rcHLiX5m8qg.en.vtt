00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:09.090
 we are going to have a strong experience 

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:13.449
 first test 

00:00:13.449 --> 00:00:15.429
 I love her so much 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:17.159
 so often 

00:00:17.159 --> 00:00:19.009
 when you have a foot 

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:22.419
 those who make the most use of rallies do what is called 

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:24.189
 weapons to fight 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:27.579
 which for example the first policeman 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:30.810
 what are the possible outcomes I can have 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.790
 or red 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.790
 or blue 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.980
 so he gets there 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:41.830
 with regard to the red 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:45.200
 I red cross on four who are red at the same chance to shoot 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.790
 any of his balls so the probability of pulling 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:51.940
 But where is the problem 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.450
 the probability of shooting the blues them both a father 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.320
 censorship 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.500
 letting go when it looks like the meeting makes me write 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.100
 country products 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.100
 second round once I did I was pulling 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:07.220
 The ball 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:08.970
 I will put it 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.370
 in the wheel and I want to look at what sector I count in everything there is 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.280
 two points to four five six six sectors 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.370
 what are the possible outcomes 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:20.450
 I can come across a black sector 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.470
 since 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.830
 good if I look 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:31.500
 what is the probability of falling on a month reducing to 2 sec of seventh 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.500
 the probability of falling on a slippage of 3 7th 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.240
 the probability of falling on inverted thereby 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.070
 this way 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.060
 no there 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.690
 therefore, 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.000
 Grey 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.560
 3 cm 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.580
 breeders 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.580
 of those he loves 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.260
 so here in the situation that is there 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:05.380
 judge 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.440
 a red ball things have changed for me 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.660
 here a left and then I came across the sector it 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.519
 he follows a mouth but on the banking sector 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:19.349
 here if I look at a blue ball 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:22.349
 and I came across a black sector 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.649
 I came across the public sector 

00:02:26.649 --> 00:02:28.100
 and a double-fault 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.529
 and then I came across a sector 

00:02:30.529 --> 00:02:33.099
 France had a meaning 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:36.099
 if I want to know for example the probability 

00:02:37.279 --> 00:02:40.359
 to have elected a red ball 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:43.139
 he fell back then follow 

00:02:43.139 --> 00:02:45.669
 the whole sector me 

00:02:45.669 --> 00:02:49.069
 well I'm the branches 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:52.139
 and I want him the probabilities 

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:54.649
 to find the probability here and here 

00:02:54.649 --> 00:02:56.239
 three cases 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:58.809
 Once 

00:02:58.809 --> 00:03:00.629
 of this bitch 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:02.529
 I can simplified here 

00:03:02.529 --> 00:03:03.949
 by 22 

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:05.799
 only 3 3 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:06.949
 surely 

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:09.799
 14 three 14th 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:12.129
 the probability of seeing it 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:15.959
 a left fell on a sector months c 3 14 

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:21.469
 then we could calculate the probability of gucht at kisumu 

00:03:22.339 --> 00:03:25.089
 here we have three 14th 

00:03:25.089 --> 00:03:31.759
 for ppr m we did not remember the 14th so let's see now here I and husband 

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:34.759
 Ehlinger 

00:03:35.679 --> 00:03:38.679
 three-fourths 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:44.519
 three chords once at 3 7 cm that makes me but nine 28th 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:48.419
 to try to find them 

00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:52.109
 that is to say a red ball is not a green sector that makes me 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:54.310
 6 hours 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:55.700
 only the money 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.289
 3 

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:59.529
 14th 

00:03:59.529 --> 00:04:01.659
 in parallel 

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:04.359
 the probability of seeing 

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:05.909
 a rougier 

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:09.319
 to fall on a less area then here now 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:10.309
 p 

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:12.929
 of bns even gave what 

00:04:12.929 --> 00:04:15.389
 a 7th wade case 

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:18.389
 that is to say 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:22.610
 the lessons that girls do not do a 14th 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.610
 one thing out of 14 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.720
 and and maintenance bgl say having the balls 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.960
 blue it happened 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.860
 at the station is 3 7e busy 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.759
 three 28th 

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:40.580
 and then finally 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.649
 the probability of having a blue ball 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.539
 an open sector 

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:50.539
 it makes us alain 

00:04:51.319 --> 00:04:54.009
 because what of this devil of simplify 

00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:57.009
 1 14 

00:04:59.249 --> 00:05:01.259
 if I add here 

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:03.610
 all probabilities 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:05.279
 of all the issues 

00:05:05.279 --> 00:05:06.589
 I have to get 1
