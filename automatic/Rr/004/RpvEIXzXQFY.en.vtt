00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.299
 hello girls branches how are you today 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.700
 glock moans and good I bring you the 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.770
 recommendations about fish I'm not 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.029
 very supporter of the hp brand but good 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.470
 I'm going to put them because there are people who 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.060
 will have good experiences and I have to 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.520
 adapt me a bit to what we think 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.310
 all do not give us something that they think so 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.050
 well I will recommend from lowest to highest 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.519
 can you tell which is the one that 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.710
 I would give you several options 

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:36.930
 so you can choose but I clear by 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.510
 Of course I'm going to tell him the sky 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.129
 laptop 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:44.149
 so well let's start first 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:47.780
 that would be this hp pavilion g6 2,262 that 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:49.820
 it's a 4 gb a4 dtm processor 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:53.390
 medium ranking hard disk memory 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:56.839
 and a 7,420 graphics card is worth a 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:59.390
 15.6 inch screen length 

00:00:56.839 --> 00:01:02.239
 the European price would be 397 euros on 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:05.630
 Mexican price would be 6 thousand 239 77 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:10.270
 mexican pesos and in argentina would be 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.270
 in 2 thousand 707 Argentine pesos 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.759
 the next computer that elected this 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:16.429
 I like it more than the previous one 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:20.869
 I prefer toshiba without a doubt this 

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:23.929
 chosen case is l 955 of 108 com 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:27.850
 amd processor a6 of 4 gb of amd 

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:29.620
 640 ram memory of the hard disk and 15.6 of 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.500
 inches of 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:34.950
 in this case another one of 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.570
 graphic controller one m radio hd 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.340
 7500 g how good that inside 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.320
 laptops are very well we do not know 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.300
 I fix the video game theme, I'm not 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.620
 talking about playing in ultra or anything 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.560
 the style but to make us the solution of 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:50.050
 we want to throw some game for something 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.280
 that we like will not move but we're going 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.470
 I tell you that I do not think they move them in 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.990
 high but everything can be 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:58.480
 I can not rectify to insure it because 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.940
 by not having access to this these 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.590
 laptops I can not say 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:05.110
 and well, the price would be hovering 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:08.290
 the 500 euros in Mexico would be seven 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:11.800
 thousand 893 pesos and in Argentina it would be 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:14.830
 three thousand 403 pesos worth we pass to 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.690
 next computer in this case I 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.490
 like the toshiba more, but let's go 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.130
 go to hp I told you that for likes 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:25.330
 colors and this in this case we have a 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:29.860
 hp pavilion g6 2.357 s with a processor 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:31.990
 to 8 8 gb of ram hard disk toe 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:35.710
 a graphics card 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:38.110
 h of 7,670 m and a screen length 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:39.500
 15.6 inches 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:43.850
 OK 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:46.970
 in this case we have found 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:53.060
 more graphic for more for more detail 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:56.360
 to tell you radio hd 7000 67 thousand 670 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:59.690
 m of 2gb and well you see that it is a good 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:02.540
 laptop is 555 euros to the currency 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:06.260
 European the Mexican currency would be in the 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:10.170
 price of eight thousand 779 pesos is currency 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:12.000
 Argentina would be in three thousand 785 pesos 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.530
 good for the next one this is the 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.239
 that I would recommend that I would stay 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.770
 who would call me and my house if I had 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:18.720
 money if you need a laptop 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:21.080
 this is the channel I like this case 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:30.080
 choose a toshiba satellite 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:35.620
 satellite alphabet l 851 l 7 have a 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:35.620
 processor and 53 thousand 210 m 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:44.320
 good 6 gb ram 50 gb hard drive 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:46.600
 a graphic card hd 7.670 m which is 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:49.330
 other people had the measure that the 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:53.020
 technology turbo cache have 2 thousand 70 39 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:57.190
 you get a dedicated gigabyte ddr3 plus a thousand 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:58.990
 735 shared megabytes would have connection 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:02.020
 vga and hdmi 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:04.180
 in this case this computer is in 639 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:07.510
 euros in the Mexican currency would be in 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:11.560
 10 thousand 740 pesos and argentinas had 4 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:13.000
 thousand 630 Argentine pesos look at last 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.890
 computer that this for people who have 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.300
 more budget that has more money or 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.010

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:23.890
 it would be a portable gaming and what 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.080
 I would call good gaming because we are going to 

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:27.820
 see for this price really the amount 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.190
 a pretty big enough tower 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:32.260
 powerful that would be a gaming computer 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.030
 but inside in what would 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:36.520
 portable work classification of 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:39.760
 portable laptop situation game vale 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:42.340
 in this case it is one more brand and they are 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:45.490
 the high-end computers in theme of 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:48.610
 laptops I repeat the model is the gx 60 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:50.680

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:55.770
 of the processors' air 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:59.590

 970 m with a screen length of 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:10.120
 15,6 this would already be a higher price 

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:13.420
 vale would be at 1,074 euros in currency 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:17.140
