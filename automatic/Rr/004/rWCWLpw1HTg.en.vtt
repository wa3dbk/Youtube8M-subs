00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:28.540
 generosity and solidarity of the 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:30.850
 Spaniards at a time as difficult as 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.670
 this one that we are living thanks to the 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:37.210
 ribbon I think the coordination between 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:39.530
 two administrations has been exemplary 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:41.870
 thank you very much 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.340
 I want to tell you that at this moment 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.709
 they are carrying out two 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:48.110
 investigations that are as is logical 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:51.560
 coordinated one is the investigation 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:53.330
 judicial and another is the investigation of 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.220
 the commission of investigation of 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:58.010
 railway accidents that depends on the 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:00.440
 development ministry the objective is to 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:02.569
 as quickly as possible and for 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.370
 course approaching fully in the 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:07.160
 diagnosis you can know which ones have 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:09.830
 been exactly the causes of this 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.150
 very serious railway accident I want 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:13.760
 tell them also that I have given 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:15.709
 instructions to the promotion ministry 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.900
 and its services that to the greatest 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:21.019
 possible speed recover the 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:23.780
 normality in rail traffic and 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:26.210
 I hope this can be done 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:28.760
 naturally also subject to the 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:29.240
 decisions that can take power 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.910
 judicial 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.169
 I insist I hope it can be carried 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.560
 out of this 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:37.610
 instruction as quickly as possible 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:40.279
 right now 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:42.259
 a capital challenge a very important challenge 

00:04:40.279 --> 00:04:45.590
 because we already have experiences of these 

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:49.190
 matters in spain 'which is to identify 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:52.070
 the people who have passed away 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:55.730
 do you know that this 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:58.010
 Unfortunately, many times it is not 

00:04:55.730 --> 00:05:02.360
 easy but we are fully aware 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:04.700
 that families can not live in 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:06.920
 a situation of uncertainty in this 

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:08.990
 moment under the direction of the 

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:11.630
 corresponding judicial authority 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:14.270
 public officials who deal 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:15.980
 of this subject are working already there 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:18.560
 some people who have been 

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:20.930
 identified in some cases are 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:23.990
 is communicating to his family and 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:26.900
 let's hope that all this under the 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:28.670
 address I insist on the authority 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:31.280
 judicial can be absorbed into the greater 

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:33.830
 haste 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:36.710
 I want to tell you also that today I am going to 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:38.240
 sign a decree of the presidency of the 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:42.980
 government declaring three days of mourning 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:45.169
 official in all of spain the next I want 

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:48.590
 finish this intervention by giving the 

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:51.710
 thanks to the political groups of 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:53.790
 our country that have been interested in 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:56.610
 the government charged 

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:59.760
 tragic event I want to thank

 informing Spanish society of a 

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:24.170
 issue that obviously does not 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:26.020
 You would have to report never or 

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:30.060
