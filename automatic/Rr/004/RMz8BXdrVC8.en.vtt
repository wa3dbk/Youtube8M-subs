00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
off this is the Famicom that I picked up

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.490 
off this is the Famicom that I picked up
it's<00:00:11.550> got<00:00:11.700> the<00:00:11.910> split<00:00:12.840> down<00:00:13.019> here<00:00:13.349> in<00:00:13.410> the

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
it's got the split down here in the

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:19.370 
it's got the split down here in the
center<00:00:13.860> for<00:00:14.370> the<00:00:14.570> ejection<00:00:15.570> button<00:00:17.210> but<00:00:18.380> yeah

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
center for the ejection button but yeah

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.340 
center for the ejection button but yeah
it's<00:00:20.160> still<00:00:21.090> a<00:00:21.330> bit<00:00:21.539> dirty<00:00:21.720> I<00:00:21.990> know<00:00:22.140> it

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
it's still a bit dirty I know it

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.230 
it's still a bit dirty I know it
probably<00:00:22.470> picks<00:00:22.830> up<00:00:22.980> really<00:00:23.279> white<00:00:23.550> with<00:00:24.029> the

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
probably picks up really white with the

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.900 
probably picks up really white with the
the<00:00:24.840> camera<00:00:25.260> but<00:00:25.949> it's<00:00:26.099> still<00:00:27.090> really<00:00:27.480> dirty

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:28.910 
the camera but it's still really dirty

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.150 
the camera but it's still really dirty
but<00:00:29.910> it<00:00:30.210> does<00:00:30.449> play<00:00:30.660> it<00:00:31.199> takes<00:00:31.410> quite<00:00:31.710> a<00:00:31.800> few

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
but it does play it takes quite a few

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.650 
but it does play it takes quite a few
pushes<00:00:33.120> in<00:00:33.480> in<00:00:33.870> order<00:00:34.320> to<00:00:34.440> get<00:00:34.559> it<00:00:34.649> to<00:00:34.739> work<00:00:34.920> but

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:35.660 
pushes in in order to get it to work but

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.369 
pushes in in order to get it to work but
yeah<00:00:36.660> it<00:00:36.989> it<00:00:37.739> plays<00:00:37.980> so<00:00:38.820> I<00:00:39.270> might<00:00:39.719> have<00:00:39.750> to<00:00:39.899> try

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
yeah it it plays so I might have to try

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:01.879 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:10.149 

start<00:01:02.879> buttons<00:01:03.210> pretty

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:15.539 

and<00:01:10.249> the<00:01:10.939> directional<00:01:11.450> pads<00:01:11.659> not<00:01:12.590> moving<00:01:13.490> down

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:15.549 
and the directional pads not moving down

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:23.190 
and the directional pads not moving down
hit<00:01:17.469> it<00:01:18.469> goes<00:01:18.619> up<00:01:18.829> goes<00:01:19.490> left<00:01:19.850> and<00:01:20.270> that's<00:01:21.020> it

up and left alright so the directional
pads<00:01:26.479> pretty<00:01:26.810> shot<00:01:27.109> have<00:01:27.920> to<00:01:28.039> replace<00:01:28.310> up<00:01:28.640> I

00:01:28.959 --> 00:01:28.969 
pads pretty shot have to replace up I

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:31.389 
pads pretty shot have to replace up I
know<00:01:29.689> this<00:01:29.840> controller<00:01:30.229> looks<00:01:30.500> pretty<00:01:31.069> rough

00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:31.399 
know this controller looks pretty rough

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:34.419 
know this controller looks pretty rough
around<00:01:31.549> here<00:01:31.880> but<00:01:32.329> I'll<00:01:33.289> uh<00:01:33.349> I'll<00:01:33.829> find<00:01:34.219> some

00:01:34.419 --> 00:01:34.429 
around here but I'll uh I'll find some

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:36.580 
around here but I'll uh I'll find some
way<00:01:34.459> to<00:01:34.609> polish<00:01:35.420> it<00:01:35.659> up<00:01:35.750> I<00:01:36.049> was<00:01:36.409> already

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
way to polish it up I was already

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.199 
way to polish it up I was already
looking<00:01:36.770> through<00:01:37.069> my<00:01:37.219> stuff<00:01:37.490> and<00:01:37.700> found<00:01:37.969> some

looking through my stuff and found some
extra<00:01:38.509> parts<00:01:38.719> here<00:01:39.020> so<00:01:39.289> we'll<00:01:39.979> use<00:01:40.159> the<00:01:40.369> switch

00:01:41.669 --> 00:01:41.679 
extra parts here so we'll use the switch

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:45.789 
extra parts here so we'll use the switch
target<00:01:42.679> place<00:01:42.860> this<00:01:43.039> one<00:01:44.170> just<00:01:45.170> pop<00:01:45.469> that<00:01:45.679> on

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
there and what uh one problem fixed so

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.789 
there and what uh one problem fixed so
that<00:01:50.170> definitely<00:01:51.170> gonna<00:01:51.289> have<00:01:51.439> to<00:01:51.500> take<00:01:51.679> this

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:51.799 
that definitely gonna have to take this

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:56.969 
that definitely gonna have to take this
thing<00:01:51.860> apart<00:01:52.069> and<00:01:52.429> clean<00:01:52.640> it<00:01:54.819> not<00:01:55.819> working

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979 
thing apart and clean it not working

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:58.209 
thing apart and clean it not working
perfectly

00:01:58.209 --> 00:01:58.219 
perfectly

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:01.899 
perfectly
and<00:01:58.689> then<00:01:59.689> there's<00:01:59.929> the<00:02:00.549> superfamily<00:02:01.549> that<00:02:01.879> I

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 
and then there's the superfamily that I

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:04.059 
and then there's the superfamily that I
picked<00:02:02.179> up<00:02:02.359> and<00:02:02.780> this<00:02:03.439> one<00:02:03.590> too<00:02:03.770> probably

00:02:04.059 --> 00:02:04.069 
picked up and this one too probably

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:07.089 
picked up and this one too probably
looks<00:02:04.340> really<00:02:04.700> sharp<00:02:04.939> through<00:02:05.689> the<00:02:05.869> eye<00:02:06.590> of

00:02:07.089 --> 00:02:07.099 
looks really sharp through the eye of

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:09.940 
looks really sharp through the eye of
the<00:02:07.429> camera<00:02:08.390> but<00:02:08.959> the<00:02:09.289> camera<00:02:09.319> doesn't<00:02:09.799> pick

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
the camera but the camera doesn't pick

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.259 
the camera but the camera doesn't pick
up<00:02:10.129> all<00:02:10.700> of<00:02:10.940> the<00:02:11.090> very<00:02:11.299> small<00:02:11.739> dirt<00:02:12.739> spots<00:02:13.269> but

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:14.269 
up all of the very small dirt spots but

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:16.449 
up all of the very small dirt spots but
yeah<00:02:14.599> I<00:02:14.900> haven't<00:02:15.290> tested<00:02:15.530> this<00:02:15.799> one<00:02:15.980> out<00:02:16.130> so<00:02:16.160> I

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
yeah I haven't tested this one out so I

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:18.250 
yeah I haven't tested this one out so I
figured<00:02:16.819> we'll<00:02:16.970> check<00:02:17.660> this<00:02:17.780> one<00:02:17.930> out<00:02:18.079> of<00:02:18.139> here

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
figured we'll check this one out of here

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.970 
figured we'll check this one out of here
together<00:02:18.730> and<00:02:19.730> grab<00:02:20.060> up<00:02:20.269> the<00:02:20.750> cords<00:02:21.590> here<00:02:21.769> from

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
together and grab up the cords here from

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:35.020 
together and grab up the cords here from
my<00:02:22.750> super<00:02:23.750> nose<00:02:32.139> in<00:02:33.139> front<00:02:33.169> of<00:02:33.380> the<00:02:33.440> Marty<00:02:34.030> or

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
my super nose in front of the Marty or

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:52.460 
my super nose in front of the Marty or
the<00:02:35.150> FM<00:02:35.450> towns<00:02:35.630> my<00:02:36.169> bad

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:59.330 

so<00:02:54.180> got<00:02:55.180> our<00:02:55.300> cords<00:02:55.630> plugged<00:02:55.930> in<00:02:56.140> here<00:02:56.470> and

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.430 

didn't<00:03:00.340> we'll<00:03:00.430> do<00:03:00.550> this<00:03:00.700> old-school<00:03:01.170> top<00:03:02.170> that
