00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.970
 it is known that blue roses in nature do not 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:11.200
 there is a rose simply 

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:13.270
 no pigment 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.310
 dolphin din who paints flowers 

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:17.439
 in all sorts of shades of blue 

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:19.630
 artificial attempts to transplant rosa 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:22.450
 gene responsible for the presence of dolphin dyne 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:24.850
 and another flower failed but 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:27.130
 nature can be tricked into a rose garden 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:30.190
 white roses are transformed by hand 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:33.010
 in 7 purple or rainbow need 

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:35.589
 pigment vases water syringe and of course themselves 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:38.679
 roses than fresh flowers and the better for us 

00:00:35.589 --> 00:00:41.050
 it is necessary that the part of the stem that 

00:00:38.679 --> 00:00:42.879
 will be in the water that is to say there 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.729
 there were no leaves there were no spines that is 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:47.350
 we will clean them up if possible now 

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:49.600
 the paint will move from the lower vessels 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.149
 to bud it is therefore necessary to remove both 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.159
 can be more leaves so paint in full 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:56.469
 volume will flow to the bud they 

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:58.389
 paint the excess leaves after all 

00:00:56.469 --> 00:00:59.709
 roses prepared need to do 

00:00:58.389 --> 00:01:01.940
 shears cut 

00:00:59.709 --> 00:01:05.299
 it is desirable to make this light 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:08.110
 in under the running water that you are capillaries 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:10.759
 did not get air there 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.770
 wear gloves to protect hands from 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:14.479
 paint at home you can 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.520
 use any food coloring 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:19.009
 here is concentrated powder 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.799
 dutch made water better 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:24.549
 use warm as she is faster 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:27.020
 will move through the vessels and 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:28.850
 Respectively faster will pass 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.340
 the process of staining the solution should 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.850
 get quite saturated in our 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.050
 color case 2 magenta and blue 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:39.080
 now just enough to lower these 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:43.460
 roses in these vases and during the day you 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:44.569
 You will watch as the white rose so 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.420
 will change 

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:51.189
 then I will show you how to do 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:55.840
 change the white rose to make of it 

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:58.060
 rosy that is there will be a combination 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.789
 four colors yes that is in this 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:03.340
 The case here is a separate rose in each 

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:05.820
 light up in its here here we will do 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.890
 that is, 4 colors we get the so-called 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.869
 rainbow rose is like a lab 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.790
 test tubes with dye prepared them 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.860
 in advance now gently pour in 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.110
 each tube of water in the end we have 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.840
 get petals of four colors it 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:23.380
 yellow blue red and purple 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.510
 that is, each petal is painted in its 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.860
 Colour 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.799
 clerical knife cut the stem on 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.510
 4 parts and on each piece about 20 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:33.700
 centimeters let what 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:38.610
 each half of this quarter 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.610
 you must lower your color 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:46.160
 there is nothing more 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.100
 attractive than impossible and already 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.540
 in a day you can see perfectly 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:53.180
 unusual roses and arch autumn 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:57.010
 saturated corals you rainbow every 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.010
 petal your color is it not a miracle
