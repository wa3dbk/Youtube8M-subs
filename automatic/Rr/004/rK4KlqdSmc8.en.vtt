00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.330 
in one channel mode and we're going to
use<00:02:41.140> a<00:02:41.550> 10<00:02:42.550> 10<00:02:42.820> 7<00:02:43.269> or<00:02:44.050> 10<00:02:44.200> seconds<00:02:44.650> on<00:02:44.769> 10

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
use a 10 10 7 or 10 seconds on 10

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.160 
use a 10 10 7 or 10 seconds on 10
seconds<00:02:45.760> off<00:02:46.290> slide<00:02:47.290> the<00:02:47.470> cover<00:02:47.650> up<00:02:47.920> and<00:02:49.170> then

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
seconds off slide the cover up and then

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.840 
seconds off slide the cover up and then
we're<00:02:50.380> going<00:02:50.470> to<00:02:50.530> turn<00:02:50.769> the<00:02:50.980> device<00:02:51.100> on<00:02:51.459> with

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
we're going to turn the device on with

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.560 
we're going to turn the device on with
the<00:02:51.970> amplitude<00:02:52.510> until<00:02:53.080> you<00:02:53.170> hear<00:02:53.350> a<00:02:53.380> click<00:02:53.440> and

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
the amplitude until you hear a click and

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.720 
the amplitude until you hear a click and
we're<00:02:55.570> gonna<00:02:55.660> set<00:02:56.019> the<00:02:56.170> pulse<00:02:56.380> rate<00:02:56.730> at

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
we're gonna set the pulse rate at

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:02.759 
we're gonna set the pulse rate at
between<00:02:58.600> 70<00:02:59.440> and<00:03:01.019> zero<00:03:02.019> so<00:03:02.410> I'm<00:03:02.470> going<00:03:02.650> to<00:03:02.709> go

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:02.769 
between 70 and zero so I'm going to go

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:06.330 
between 70 and zero so I'm going to go
to<00:03:02.860> the<00:03:03.040> midpoint<00:03:03.220> of<00:03:04.030> about<00:03:04.420> 35<00:03:05.320> then<00:03:06.190> I'm

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
to the midpoint of about 35 then I'm

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.550 
to the midpoint of about 35 then I'm
going<00:03:06.489> to<00:03:06.579> turn<00:03:06.730> up<00:03:06.790> the<00:03:06.940> amplitude

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.640 

and<00:03:11.709> remember<00:03:12.640> that<00:03:13.450> this<00:03:13.780> is<00:03:13.840> ten<00:03:14.140> seconds<00:03:14.530> on

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
and remember that this is ten seconds on

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.479 
and remember that this is ten seconds on
in<00:03:14.830> ten<00:03:15.010> seconds<00:03:15.370> off<00:03:16.349> so<00:03:17.349> we<00:03:18.099> want<00:03:18.310> to<00:03:18.370> make

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
in ten seconds off so we want to make

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:21.390 
in ten seconds off so we want to make
sure<00:03:18.730> that<00:03:19.510> we're<00:03:19.900> not<00:03:19.930> turning<00:03:20.470> it<00:03:20.590> up<00:03:21.130> too

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
sure that we're not turning it up too

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.309 
sure that we're not turning it up too
high<00:03:21.480> until<00:03:22.480> we<00:03:22.569> start<00:03:22.840> to<00:03:22.870> feel<00:03:23.080> some

00:03:23.309 --> 00:03:23.319 
high until we start to feel some

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:25.470 
high until we start to feel some
stimulation<00:03:23.790> once<00:03:24.790> you<00:03:24.940> start<00:03:25.209> to<00:03:25.330> feel

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
stimulation once you start to feel

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.740 
stimulation once you start to feel
stimulation<00:03:26.110> within<00:03:26.410> that<00:03:26.560> ten<00:03:27.099> seconds<00:03:27.550> on

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
stimulation within that ten seconds on

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:33.660 
stimulation within that ten seconds on
then<00:03:28.750> you'll<00:03:29.590> want<00:03:29.830> to<00:03:29.920> adjust<00:03:30.910> it<00:03:32.340> until<00:03:33.340> it's

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
then you'll want to adjust it until it's

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:39.390 
then you'll want to adjust it until it's
comfortable<00:03:34.349> and<00:03:36.870> usually

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
comfortable and usually

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.160 
comfortable and usually
you<00:03:40.400> would<00:03:40.550> do<00:03:40.670> this<00:03:40.850> treatment<00:03:41.060> depending<00:03:42.050> on

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.170 
you would do this treatment depending on

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:44.290 
you would do this treatment depending on
how<00:03:42.860> long<00:03:43.040> your<00:03:43.250> doctor<00:03:43.640> or<00:03:43.730> therapist<00:03:44.120> told

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:44.300 
how long your doctor or therapist told

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.420 
how long your doctor or therapist told
you<00:03:44.770> generally<00:03:45.770> these<00:03:45.920> treatments<00:03:46.370> are

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
you generally these treatments are

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.080 
you generally these treatments are
between<00:03:46.820> 10<00:03:47.270> and<00:03:47.300> 15<00:03:47.750> minutes<00:03:48.730> you<00:03:49.730> can<00:03:49.760> also

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
between 10 and 15 minutes you can also

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.000 
between 10 and 15 minutes you can also
do<00:03:50.330> something<00:03:50.600> called<00:03:50.720> Co<00:03:51.140> contraction<00:03:51.860> with

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
do something called Co contraction with

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.580 
do something called Co contraction with
this<00:03:52.190> so<00:03:52.850> when<00:03:53.360> it's<00:03:53.510> in<00:03:53.660> the<00:03:53.750> on<00:03:53.900> mode<00:03:54.260> and

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
this so when it's in the on mode and

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:56.710 
this so when it's in the on mode and
you're<00:03:55.130> feeling<00:03:55.490> your<00:03:55.820> muscles<00:03:56.240> stimulate

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
you're feeling your muscles stimulate

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.150 
you're feeling your muscles stimulate
you<00:03:57.110> can<00:03:57.290> actually<00:03:57.590> actively<00:03:59.980> contract<00:04:00.980> your

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.160 
you can actually actively contract your

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.330 
you can actually actively contract your
muscle<00:04:01.490> and<00:04:01.790> then<00:04:02.390> relax<00:04:02.720> it<00:04:03.020> rhythmically<00:04:03.860> as

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 
muscle and then relax it rhythmically as

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.180 
muscle and then relax it rhythmically as
this<00:04:04.670> unit<00:04:05.000> is<00:04:05.060> turning<00:04:05.420> on<00:04:05.570> and<00:04:05.750> off<00:04:06.190> when

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
this unit is turning on and off when

this unit is turning on and off when
your<00:04:07.760> treatment<00:04:07.970> duration<00:04:08.930> is<00:04:09.050> finished<00:04:09.650> you

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
your treatment duration is finished you

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.970 
your treatment duration is finished you
will<00:04:10.370> then<00:04:10.600> turn<00:04:11.600> the<00:04:11.780> device<00:04:11.930> off<00:04:12.410> and<00:04:13.630> then

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980
