a<00:03:07.650> lot<00:03:07.770> longer<00:03:07.830> and<00:03:08.190> obviously<00:03:08.580> make<00:03:08.760> sure

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
a lot longer and obviously make sure

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.060 
a lot longer and obviously make sure
that<00:03:09.090> no<00:03:09.240> water<00:03:09.450> gets<00:03:09.810> through<00:03:10.110> but<00:03:10.650> it<00:03:10.800> might

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
that no water gets through but it might

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:12.830 
that no water gets through but it might
restrict<00:03:11.400> the<00:03:11.550> flex<00:03:11.820> a<00:03:11.940> little<00:03:12.090> bit<00:03:12.360> but<00:03:12.630> then

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
restrict the flex a little bit but then

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.000 
restrict the flex a little bit but then
having<00:03:13.230> said<00:03:13.350> that<00:03:13.380> I<00:03:13.500> haven't<00:03:13.650> tried<00:03:13.770> the

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
having said that I haven't tried the

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.860 
having said that I haven't tried the
suit<00:03:14.190> so<00:03:14.490> one<00:03:15.000> thing<00:03:15.180> they<00:03:15.300> have<00:03:15.480> done<00:03:15.510> is

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
suit so one thing they have done is

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.000 
suit so one thing they have done is
similar<00:03:16.200> to<00:03:16.290> the<00:03:16.380> revolution<00:03:16.860> they've

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
similar to the revolution they've

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.949 
similar to the revolution they've
dropped<00:03:17.280> the<00:03:17.670> liquid<00:03:18.150> taping<00:03:18.360> on<00:03:18.600> the<00:03:18.720> scenes

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
dropped the liquid taping on the scenes

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:20.780 
dropped the liquid taping on the scenes
around<00:03:19.260> the<00:03:19.530> arms<00:03:19.800> well<00:03:20.010> so<00:03:20.250> you've<00:03:20.459> got<00:03:20.490> a

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
around the arms well so you've got a

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.120 
around the arms well so you've got a
huge<00:03:21.630> amount<00:03:21.930> of<00:03:21.959> flex<00:03:22.170> around<00:03:22.470> there<00:03:22.680> so<00:03:22.890> you

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
huge amount of flex around there so you

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.470 
huge amount of flex around there so you
don't<00:03:23.310> really<00:03:23.459> need<00:03:23.790> it<00:03:23.940> and<00:03:24.060> they<00:03:24.120> go<00:03:24.239> back<00:03:24.450> to

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
don't really need it and they go back to

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.030 
don't really need it and they go back to
the<00:03:24.660> standard<00:03:25.020> gluten<00:03:25.380> blonde<00:03:25.560> stitching

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
the standard gluten blonde stitching

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.920 
the standard gluten blonde stitching
there<00:03:26.220> the<00:03:26.760> whole<00:03:26.880> suit<00:03:27.120> is<00:03:27.270> gluten<00:03:27.600> monster

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
there the whole suit is gluten monster

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.390 
there the whole suit is gluten monster
chain<00:03:28.140> link<00:03:28.380> they<00:03:28.590> can<00:03:28.739> obviously<00:03:28.920> liquid

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
chain link they can obviously liquid

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.330 
chain link they can obviously liquid
taped<00:03:29.640> to<00:03:30.030> a<00:03:30.560> stop<00:03:31.560> any<00:03:31.739> water<00:03:31.920> and<00:03:32.130> make<00:03:32.220> it

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
taped to a stop any water and make it

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.040 
taped to a stop any water and make it
really<00:03:32.430> robust<00:03:32.880> as<00:03:33.120> you<00:03:33.270> can<00:03:33.420> see<00:03:33.540> on<00:03:33.630> the<00:03:33.720> arms

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 
really robust as you can see on the arms

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.140 
really robust as you can see on the arms
you've<00:03:34.530> got<00:03:34.739> the<00:03:35.370> standard<00:03:35.760> sort<00:03:35.880> of<00:03:35.970> like

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
you've got the standard sort of like

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.090 
you've got the standard sort of like
liquid<00:03:36.420> taping<00:03:36.630> on<00:03:36.900> the<00:03:37.320> inside<00:03:37.680> of<00:03:37.709> the<00:03:37.920> suit

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
liquid taping on the inside of the suit

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.840 
liquid taping on the inside of the suit
and<00:03:38.880> that<00:03:39.060> runs<00:03:40.250> that<00:03:41.250> does<00:03:41.430> run<00:03:41.610> the<00:03:41.700> whole

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
and that runs that does run the whole

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.760 
and that runs that does run the whole
way<00:03:41.880> up<00:03:42.150> so<00:03:42.510> the<00:03:42.780> liquid<00:03:43.080> take<00:03:43.230> on<00:03:43.410> the<00:03:43.500> inside

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:43.770 
way up so the liquid take on the inside

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:45.680 
way up so the liquid take on the inside
here<00:03:44.100> a<00:03:44.280> little<00:03:44.550> bit<00:03:44.700> thinner<00:03:44.970> just<00:03:45.570> to<00:03:45.660> make

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
here a little bit thinner just to make

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.210 
here a little bit thinner just to make
sure<00:03:45.840> you've<00:03:46.170> got<00:03:46.200> more<00:03:46.410> flexibility<00:03:47.040> on<00:03:47.190> the

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
sure you've got more flexibility on the

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.180 
sure you've got more flexibility on the
arm<00:03:47.810> so<00:03:48.810> as<00:03:49.080> I<00:03:49.350> said<00:03:49.560> before<00:03:49.590> a<00:03:49.980> real

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
arm so as I said before a real

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:51.800 
arm so as I said before a real
performance<00:03:50.610> wet<00:03:50.880> too<00:03:51.060> very<00:03:51.300> stripped<00:03:51.600> down

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
performance wet too very stripped down

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.810 
performance wet too very stripped down
it's<00:03:52.650> got<00:03:52.739> the<00:03:52.830> chest<00:03:53.040> zip<00:03:53.130> system<00:03:53.610> on<00:03:53.700> it

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
it's got the chest zip system on it

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.820 
it's got the chest zip system on it
chest<00:03:54.360> it<00:03:54.510> goes<00:03:54.720> from<00:03:54.870> int'l<00:03:55.320> out<00:03:55.440> so<00:03:55.680> it's<00:03:55.800> a

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
chest it goes from int'l out so it's a

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.640 
chest it goes from int'l out so it's a
bit<00:03:55.950> easier<00:03:56.310> to<00:03:56.459> get<00:03:56.580> on<00:03:56.730> off<00:03:57.440> click<00:03:58.440> around

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
bit easier to get on off click around

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.590 
bit easier to get on off click around
zip<00:03:58.920> too<00:03:59.100> much<00:03:59.310> on<00:03:59.520> the<00:03:59.640> inside<00:03:59.970> you've<00:04:00.480> got

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
zip too much on the inside you've got

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:01.750 
zip too much on the inside you've got
the<00:04:00.690> dry<00:04:00.870> max<00:04:01.140> and

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760

system<00:04:02.090> here<00:04:02.239> basically<00:04:02.480> which<00:04:02.930> is<00:04:03.049> a

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:03.080 
system here basically which is a

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.380 
system here basically which is a
slightly<00:04:03.799> different<00:04:04.069> quadricep<00:04:04.970> system

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:05.390 
slightly different quadricep system

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:07.690 
slightly different quadricep system
allows<00:04:06.379> it<00:04:06.560> to<00:04:06.590> be<00:04:06.709> easier<00:04:07.099> to<00:04:07.189> get<00:04:07.340> in<00:04:07.489> and<00:04:07.579> out

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
allows it to be easier to get in and out

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.640

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:36.490 
and wide the two pieces of neoprene
there<00:04:34.160> so<00:04:34.430> it's<00:04:35.060> a<00:04:35.330> less<00:04:35.990> difficult<00:04:36.410> to

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.500 
there so it's a less difficult to

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.040 
there so it's a less difficult to
actually<00:04:36.590> get<00:04:36.830> into<00:04:36.979> ok<00:04:37.820> if<00:04:38.510> i<00:04:38.660> reach<00:04:38.840> inside

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050 
actually get into ok if i reach inside

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:40.719 
actually get into ok if i reach inside
the<00:04:39.199> thing<00:04:39.470> which<00:04:39.919> i<00:04:40.070> do<00:04:40.130> when<00:04:40.430> you're<00:04:40.550> still

through<00:05:19.280> is<00:05:19.580> the<00:05:19.820> other<00:05:19.910> way<00:05:20.090> so<00:05:20.150> i<00:05:20.270> think<00:05:20.360> it

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:20.510 
through is the other way so i think it

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:22.420 
through is the other way so i think it
all<00:05:20.599> is<00:05:20.870> actually<00:05:21.080> i<00:05:21.410> don't<00:05:21.740> know<00:05:21.979> what<00:05:22.130> a<00:05:22.160> top

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:22.430

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:28.160 
of the suit which gives more flexibility
