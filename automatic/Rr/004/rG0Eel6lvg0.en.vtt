00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 everyone knows who we are 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.290
 found for a new video and 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:05.759
 this time I wanted to talk to you 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.950
 of a game that has been controversial since 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.780
 few days in the media especially 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.490
 because man is too much 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.559
 violent that it has no purpose that it does not 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:18.949
 should not exist and that's the game 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.949
 ritual called my name is not your leg 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:33.000
 I play you this main character 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.380
 who is tired of everything and everything 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.510
 world who decides to go out on the streets 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.980
 and kill people in the way the 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.649
 more violent every time 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.500
 man police woman anything 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.450
 just first in the streets seen from above 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.940
 with a gone in the hands you all the 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.170
 world and ultimo die in fact alone 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.760
 objective of the character is said I have 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.590
 tired I want to die I'll go out I 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.800
 I'll kill everyone with me it's 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:58.230
 true that it's quite daring as a scenario 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.660
 moved away from moving too I can the 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.800
 understand but most people 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.090
 who talks about it at least most of 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.559
 media that I saw these are media 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.240
 who do not really know the game 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.290
 video of people who do not know this 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.340
 that it's a video game are not 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.840
 played in themselves so I told myself 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.830
 that I was going to make a video for it 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.600
 talk to people like me 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.220
 ie you gamer all 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.580
 just have your feedback your feedback 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.080
 etc. 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.299
 I also found myself doing 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.530
 the devil's advocate because giza or 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.070
 but that's okay after I say that 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.390
 it's serious 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.140
 I can not make up my mind 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.250
 see after a while i'm going 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.140
 start saying anything because 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.840
 that I'm not really decided about 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.329
 of this game on one side I tell myself that remains 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.430
 a video game either to embody 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.579
 bloodthirsty murderer who wants to kill everything 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:38.159
 the world or else super heroes or a 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.619
 robber or criminal like in gta 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.670
 or a completely crazy guy who 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.360
 use cats as silent 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.500
 in post it's still video games I 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.170
 do not know present think about the one of 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.060
 call of duty 4 or where the 5th si mu is 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.470
 the 4th or 5th in the airport where we 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.299
 was having fun killing all the civilians 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.159
 because it was the contract that 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.719
 asked to go to the airport in 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.340
 take an army in sir all the 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.659
 world lying at the airport that had made 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.579
 controversial but what everyone is 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.009
 became a psychopath playing this 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.840
 part of the game is what everyone 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:08.670
 was sagre and to have played that I 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.200
 do not think no and that's where it is 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.930
 the argument that often comes down is that 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.239
 we have games just as violent as that 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.310
 the counter argument is that his other 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:19.680
 games there like gta for example without 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.019
 often satire of humor with a 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.219
 very specific social context so any 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:25.260
 this violence is somewhere 

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:27.650
 justified if we can say that like that 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.549
 that's it against argument the argument 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.219
 now I do not know where to place myself in 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:33.780
 all this personally this is how I 

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:36.389
 you told him for me it's still a game 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.980
 what I'm shocked by the fact that 

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:39.120
 can embody a character who has for 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.769
 purpose of killing everyone on the streets 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.530
 for no apparent reason just his 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:47.669
 hate no absolutely no I find the 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:49.409
 commonplace concept and I would say that I am 

00:02:47.669 --> 00:02:51.000
 no passion that the game goes out all for there 

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:54.450
 play co-op it's me it's just a 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.230
 game like another and to and here it is 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.159
 for that I did not ask you 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.409
 actually translates it maybe for 

00:02:56.159 --> 00:03:00.060
 better place myself in there and see where 

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:02.969
 you are in all his 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.219
 opinions but I do not think it's 

00:03:02.969 --> 00:03:06.930
 a game that is uncommon to 

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:08.730
 something completely outrageous 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.590
 because somewhere the best 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.000
 satire is the satire that we have the 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.480
 more trouble to look at the magnifying glass 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.159
 more trouble to capture I mean I 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.449
 knew very well that this is a game that 

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:21.690
 really take themselves seriously 

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:23.310
 jean-louis we just want you to kill 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.949
 everyone like passing that where gta 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.720
 we have fun taking cars is there 

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:29.310
 who has not already done anything 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.629
 the world in the sidewalks killing 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.189
 cops 

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:35.840
 what else call of duty the lady 

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:38.340
 similar post do not know dia ago 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.650
 this big difference you'll be 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.090
 this big contrast between real via 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.090
 this contrast between real life and games 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.799
 video that really no relation and me 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.689
 I do not mind a game 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:50.569
 like this one exists or so I want 

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:53.489
 to say freedom 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:55.590
 after that will probably happen as a 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:56.519
 like several games for example postal 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.729
 as I said earlier who 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:02.129
 will be who was clean probably he 

00:03:59.729 --> 00:04:04.139
 is still a way censored in France the 

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:06.569
 postal 2 or the 3 I know more which one 

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:07.979
 some there some mailing were 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:09.419
 censored fragile in France judge 

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:11.040
 because the parent of you without 

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:13.979
 french messaoud also been censored in 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.810
 full of countries yet that's all in 

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:18.389
 do I talk about it to have a little bit 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.859
 your opinion on the subject what you 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:22.079
 also you were completely shocked 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:24.090
 you find that completely outrageous 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:25.440
 and too violent or like me 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.720
 you are completely indifferent 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.460
 or even you like the concept and you 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.630
 want to play it anytime 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.150
 you are free to think what you 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:35.130
 want because it's still a video game 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.900
 and I would like to have your opinion on it 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:38.820
 just before finishing I want to do 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:41.100
 a great dedication to vincent 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.810
