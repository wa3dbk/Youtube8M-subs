so<00:00:09.330> here<00:00:09.510> we're<00:00:09.599> gonna<00:00:09.690> take<00:00:09.960> a<00:00:09.990> look<00:00:10.380> at<00:00:10.590> doing

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
so here we're gonna take a look at doing

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.370 
so here we're gonna take a look at doing
some<00:00:11.340> reach<00:00:11.550> apology<00:00:12.240> using<00:00:12.750> some<00:00:12.990> of<00:00:13.019> the<00:00:13.230> new

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
some reach apology using some of the new

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.840 
some reach apology using some of the new
tools<00:00:13.620> in<00:00:14.040> 3ds<00:00:14.670> Max<00:00:15.059> and<00:00:15.240> 3ds<00:00:15.630> max<00:00:16.020> design

specifically<00:00:17.850> we're<00:00:18.570> going<00:00:18.869> to<00:00:18.990> be<00:00:19.080> looking

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
specifically we're going to be looking

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.650 
specifically we're going to be looking
at<00:00:19.529> the<00:00:19.619> conform<00:00:20.010> tool<00:00:20.250> here's<00:00:20.880> our<00:00:21.240> model

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
at the conform tool here's our model

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.179 
at the conform tool here's our model
that<00:00:21.689> we're<00:00:21.900> working<00:00:22.080> on<00:00:22.380> you<00:00:22.529> can<00:00:22.590> see<00:00:22.920> it's<00:00:23.070> a

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
that we're working on you can see it's a

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.370 
that we're working on you can see it's a
pretty<00:00:23.400> it's<00:00:23.880> a<00:00:23.970> legacy<00:00:24.180> piece<00:00:24.660> of<00:00:24.810> geometry

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
pretty it's a legacy piece of geometry

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.349 
pretty it's a legacy piece of geometry
that<00:00:25.410> we<00:00:25.560> need<00:00:25.800> to<00:00:25.890> update<00:00:26.039> into<00:00:26.640> quads<00:00:26.910> it's<00:00:27.180> a

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
that we need to update into quads it's a

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.210 
that we need to update into quads it's a
it's<00:00:27.539> a<00:00:27.630> heavily<00:00:27.810> triangulated<00:00:28.590> model<00:00:29.070> and

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
it's a heavily triangulated model and

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.490 
it's a heavily triangulated model and
it's<00:00:29.970> fairly<00:00:30.330> low<00:00:30.570> res<00:00:30.840> we<00:00:31.109> need<00:00:31.289> to<00:00:31.470> uh

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
it's fairly low res we need to uh

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.740 
it's fairly low res we need to uh
present<00:00:31.920> and<00:00:32.369> we<00:00:32.550> need<00:00:32.730> to<00:00:32.940> basically<00:00:33.570> read

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
present and we need to basically read

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.209 
present and we need to basically read
apologize<00:00:34.320> it<00:00:34.469> so<00:00:34.590> we're<00:00:34.680> gonna<00:00:34.770> be<00:00:34.950> looking

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
apologize it so we're gonna be looking

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.220 
apologize it so we're gonna be looking
at<00:00:35.280> some<00:00:35.489> of<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.700> topology<00:00:35.969> tools<00:00:36.390> so<00:00:36.600> let<00:00:37.140> me

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
at some of the topology tools so let me

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.660 
at some of the topology tools so let me
go<00:00:37.350> ahead<00:00:37.440> and<00:00:37.620> exit<00:00:37.920> isolation<00:00:38.430> button<00:00:38.610> you

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
go ahead and exit isolation button you

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.880 
go ahead and exit isolation button you
can<00:00:38.760> see<00:00:38.910> I've<00:00:39.000> already<00:00:39.320> completed<00:00:40.320> pretty

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
can see I've already completed pretty

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.580 
can see I've already completed pretty
much<00:00:41.100> a<00:00:41.129> proxy<00:00:42.000> model<00:00:42.420> um<00:00:42.570> over<00:00:42.930> top<00:00:43.290> of<00:00:43.320> the

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
much a proxy model um over top of the

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.490 
much a proxy model um over top of the
surface<00:00:44.010> of<00:00:44.360> this<00:00:45.360> and<00:00:45.660> but<00:00:46.050> it's<00:00:46.200> a<00:00:46.289> very

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
surface of this and but it's a very

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.410 
surface of this and but it's a very
loose<00:00:46.770> what<00:00:47.129> I<00:00:47.160> call<00:00:47.370> a<00:00:47.399> loose<00:00:47.640> fitting<00:00:48.030> model

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
loose what I call a loose fitting model

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.160 
loose what I call a loose fitting model
in<00:00:48.600> that<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.430> geometry<00:00:50.460> although<00:00:50.940> mimics<00:00:51.870> the

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
in that the geometry although mimics the

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.470 
in that the geometry although mimics the
volume<00:00:52.739> doesn't<00:00:53.190> necessarily<00:00:53.879> represent<00:00:54.030> the

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
volume doesn't necessarily represent the

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.110 
volume doesn't necessarily represent the
form<00:00:54.870> so<00:00:55.079> we're<00:00:55.230> gonna<00:00:55.320> be<00:00:55.469> taking<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:55.860> look<00:00:56.010> at

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
form so we're gonna be taking a look at

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.540 
form so we're gonna be taking a look at
two<00:00:57.120> different<00:00:57.230> tools<00:00:58.230> here<00:00:58.559> so<00:00:58.829> I'm<00:00:59.280> gonna<00:00:59.460> go

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
two different tools here so I'm gonna go

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.160 
two different tools here so I'm gonna go
ahead<00:00:59.670> and<00:00:59.820> open<00:01:00.210> up<00:01:00.270> my<00:01:00.329> graphite<00:01:00.780> modeling

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
ahead and open up my graphite modeling

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.049 
ahead and open up my graphite modeling
tools<00:01:01.379> and<00:01:01.530> you<00:01:01.590> can<00:01:01.649> see<00:01:01.920> that<00:01:02.160> a<00:01:02.309> lot<00:01:02.760> of<00:01:02.879> the

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
tools and you can see that a lot of the

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.600 
tools and you can see that a lot of the
interface<00:01:03.960> has<00:01:04.199> been<00:01:04.260> refreshed<00:01:05.129> with<00:01:05.369> new

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
interface has been refreshed with new

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.039 
interface has been refreshed with new
icons<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:06.270> things<00:01:06.450> like<00:01:06.570> that<00:01:06.750> to<00:01:06.900> make<00:01:06.990> it

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
icons and things like that to make it

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.140 
icons and things like that to make it
look<00:01:07.350> a<00:01:07.500> little<00:01:07.619> easier<00:01:08.100> to<00:01:08.220> work<00:01:08.250> with<00:01:08.430> we're

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
look a little easier to work with we're

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.820 
look a little easier to work with we're
gonna<00:01:09.240> be<00:01:09.390> looking<00:01:09.780> at<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.170> freeform<00:01:10.560> tools

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
gonna be looking at the freeform tools

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.090 
gonna be looking at the freeform tools
to<00:01:11.100> start<00:01:11.900> I've<00:01:12.900> already<00:01:13.200> set<00:01:13.439> it<00:01:13.470> up<00:01:13.680> so<00:01:13.890> that

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
to start I've already set it up so that

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.649 
to start I've already set it up so that
we're<00:01:14.280> actually<00:01:14.700> drawing<00:01:14.970> on<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.299> surface

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
we're actually drawing on the surface

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.080 
we're actually drawing on the surface
underneath<00:01:15.990> it<00:01:16.320> so<00:01:16.500> for<00:01:16.710> example<00:01:17.100> I<00:01:17.220> have<00:01:17.250> draw

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
underneath it so for example I have draw

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.469 
underneath it so for example I have draw
on<00:01:18.299> surface<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:19.049> I<00:01:19.950> have<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.490> bottom<00:01:21.000> surface

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
on surface and I have the bottom surface

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.960 
on surface and I have the bottom surface
selected<00:01:22.170> and<00:01:22.350> what<00:01:23.009> this<00:01:23.220> is<00:01:23.369> going<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:23.759> allow

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
selected and what this is going to allow

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.640 
selected and what this is going to allow
us<00:01:24.119> to<00:01:24.150> do<00:01:24.420> is<00:01:24.570> allow<00:01:24.840> us<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:25.080> paint<00:01:25.290> directly

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
us to do is allow us to paint directly

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.359 
us to do is allow us to paint directly
on<00:01:26.159> our<00:01:26.900> volume<00:01:27.900> here<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:28.560> it<00:01:28.740> will<00:01:28.860> conform

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
on our volume here and it will conform

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.760 
on our volume here and it will conform
to<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:30.090> surface<00:01:30.509> underneath<00:01:30.930> it<00:01:31.259> so<00:01:31.470> we<00:01:31.590> have

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
to the surface underneath it so we have

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.580 
to the surface underneath it so we have
some<00:01:32.009> new<00:01:32.130> tools<00:01:32.340> here<00:01:32.810> called<00:01:33.810> conform<00:01:34.380> and

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
some new tools here called conform and

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.289 
some new tools here called conform and
we<00:01:34.680> have<00:01:34.860> several<00:01:35.159> different<00:01:35.310> tools<00:01:35.820> we<00:01:36.119> have

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
we have several different tools we have

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.620 
we have several different tools we have
move<00:01:36.990> rotate<00:01:37.710> and<00:01:37.979> scale<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.880> topology<00:01:39.420> and

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
move rotate and scale the topology and

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.510 
move rotate and scale the topology and
relax<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.140> topology<00:01:40.409> but<00:01:40.920> we'll<00:01:41.340> come<00:01:41.490> to

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
relax the topology but we'll come to

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.460 
relax the topology but we'll come to
those<00:01:41.729> in<00:01:41.880> a<00:01:41.939> minute<00:01:42.030> but<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.780> main<00:01:42.960> tool<00:01:43.170> here

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
those in a minute but the main tool here

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.139 
those in a minute but the main tool here
is<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.890> conform<00:01:44.310> tool<00:01:44.549> so<00:01:44.729> I'll<00:01:44.820> go<00:01:44.939> ahead<00:01:45.000> and

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
is the conform tool so I'll go ahead and

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.960 
is the conform tool so I'll go ahead and
open<00:01:45.180> this<00:01:45.540> up<00:01:45.750> and<00:01:45.960> I'll<00:01:46.740> set<00:01:47.040> my<00:01:47.189> strength

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
open this up and I'll set my strength

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.530 
open this up and I'll set my strength
value<00:01:48.299> about<00:01:48.450> 15<00:01:48.930> I<00:01:49.520> will<00:01:50.520> set<00:01:50.820> my<00:01:50.939> offset<00:01:51.360> to

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
value about 15 I will set my offset to

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.429 
value about 15 I will set my offset to
be<00:01:51.689> about<00:01:52.020> 1<00:01:52.380> our<00:01:53.299> fall-off<00:01:54.299> in<00:01:54.600> and<00:01:54.990> full

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
be about 1 our fall-off in and full

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:56.600 
be about 1 our fall-off in and full
strength<00:01:55.710> are<00:01:55.890> right<00:01:56.040> there<00:01:56.189> those<00:01:56.399> are<00:01:56.520> of

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
strength are right there those are of

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.010 
strength are right there those are of
course<00:01:56.640> controlled<00:01:57.329> you<00:01:57.600> know<00:01:57.719> with<00:01:57.899> the

course controlled you know with the

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.740 
course controlled you know with the
mouse<00:01:58.290> at<00:01:58.530> regularly<00:01:59.520> so<00:01:59.700> we<00:02:00.240> can<00:02:00.420> just<00:02:00.570> begin

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
mouse at regularly so we can just begin

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.510 
mouse at regularly so we can just begin
painting<00:02:01.200> and<00:02:01.500> what's<00:02:01.649> happening<00:02:02.009> now<00:02:02.070> is<00:02:02.369> I'm

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
painting and what's happening now is I'm

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.749 
painting and what's happening now is I'm
actually<00:02:02.549> painting<00:02:03.390> this<00:02:03.990> topology<00:02:04.549> right<00:02:05.549> on

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
actually painting this topology right on

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.449 
actually painting this topology right on
top<00:02:06.090> of<00:02:06.329> our<00:02:06.719> underlying<00:02:07.229> topology<00:02:08.009> so<00:02:08.220> as<00:02:08.340> I

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
top of our underlying topology so as I

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.790 
top of our underlying topology so as I
paint<00:02:08.670> on<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:08.910> arms<00:02:09.360> as<00:02:09.569> I<00:02:10.170> paint<00:02:10.379> on<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.619> back

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
paint on the arms as I paint on the back

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.410 
paint on the arms as I paint on the back
you<00:02:11.129> can<00:02:11.250> see<00:02:11.400> I'll<00:02:11.520> open<00:02:11.819> up<00:02:11.910> the<00:02:11.970> strength<00:02:12.330> a

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
you can see I'll open up the strength a

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.610 
you can see I'll open up the strength a
little<00:02:12.660> bit<00:02:12.780> I<00:02:12.810> can<00:02:13.050> really<00:02:13.260> kind<00:02:13.470> of

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
little bit I can really kind of

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.680 
little bit I can really kind of
accelerate<00:02:14.040> this<00:02:14.190> process<00:02:14.730> a<00:02:14.760> little<00:02:14.970> bit<00:02:15.180> and

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
accelerate this process a little bit and

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.100 
accelerate this process a little bit and
we<00:02:15.959> can<00:02:16.110> see<00:02:16.319> that<00:02:16.560> the<00:02:17.360> form<00:02:18.360> is<00:02:18.569> beginning<00:02:18.989> to

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
we can see that the form is beginning to

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.789 
we can see that the form is beginning to
take<00:02:19.319> place<00:02:19.610> on<00:02:20.610> our<00:02:20.849> on<00:02:21.120> our<00:02:21.349> volume<00:02:22.349> here<00:02:22.590> as

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:22.799 
take place on our on our volume here as

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:25.309 
take place on our on our volume here as
we<00:02:23.040> get<00:02:23.190> closer<00:02:23.459> now<00:02:23.730> once<00:02:24.480> we<00:02:24.810> get<00:02:25.019> a<00:02:25.049> little

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
we get closer now once we get a little

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:26.750 
we get closer now once we get a little
bit<00:02:25.470> closer<00:02:25.709> to<00:02:25.950> the<00:02:26.040> volume<00:02:26.370> that<00:02:26.400> we<00:02:26.519> needed

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
bit closer to the volume that we needed

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.610 
bit closer to the volume that we needed
to<00:02:26.879> be<00:02:27.090> I'll<00:02:27.209> probably<00:02:27.450> go<00:02:27.780> ahead<00:02:28.140> in<00:02:28.290> and<00:02:28.440> add

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
to be I'll probably go ahead in and add

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.800 
to be I'll probably go ahead in and add
some<00:02:28.650> topology<00:02:29.459> so<00:02:29.640> go<00:02:29.970> underneath<00:02:30.329> here<00:02:30.629> and

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
some topology so go underneath here and

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.960 
some topology so go underneath here and
you<00:02:31.409> can<00:02:31.560> see<00:02:31.769> that<00:02:31.980> the<00:02:32.069> conform<00:02:32.489> tool<00:02:32.760> is

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
you can see that the conform tool is

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.449 
you can see that the conform tool is
really<00:02:33.769> adhering<00:02:34.769> to<00:02:34.799> the<00:02:35.069> underlying

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
really adhering to the underlying

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.319 
really adhering to the underlying
surface<00:02:35.970> quite<00:02:36.239> well<00:02:36.920> now<00:02:37.920> that<00:02:38.099> we<00:02:38.190> have<00:02:38.400> some

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:39.329 
surface quite well now that we have some

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:42.470 
surface quite well now that we have some
of<00:02:39.390> our<00:02:39.720> conformed<00:02:40.709> geometry<00:02:41.489> on<00:02:41.670> there<00:02:41.970> we

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
of our conformed geometry on there we

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.089 
of our conformed geometry on there we
can<00:02:42.629> use<00:02:42.659> some<00:02:42.959> of<00:02:42.989> the<00:02:43.200> other<00:02:43.230> conform<00:02:43.829> tools

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 
can use some of the other conform tools

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:47.449 
can use some of the other conform tools
so<00:02:44.280> for<00:02:44.489> example<00:02:44.970> I<00:02:45.150> can<00:02:45.959> use<00:02:46.109> relax<00:02:46.620> and<00:02:46.980> what

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
so for example I can use relax and what

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.839 
so for example I can use relax and what
I<00:02:47.489> can<00:02:47.670> do<00:02:47.790> is<00:02:47.910> I<00:02:48.090> can<00:02:48.150> relax<00:02:48.660> the<00:02:48.959> geometry

00:02:49.839 --> 00:02:49.849 
I can do is I can relax the geometry

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:52.849 
I can do is I can relax the geometry
just<00:02:50.849> like<00:02:51.000> the<00:02:51.150> relaxed<00:02:51.480> tool<00:02:51.780> the<00:02:52.680> other

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:52.859 
just like the relaxed tool the other

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:54.530 
just like the relaxed tool the other
relaxed<00:02:53.370> tool<00:02:53.519> in<00:02:53.640> freeform<00:02:54.120> mode<00:02:54.180> but<00:02:54.480> the

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
relaxed tool in freeform mode but the

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.900 
relaxed tool in freeform mode but the
difference<00:02:54.959> here<00:02:55.049> is<00:02:55.349> it's<00:02:56.160> conforming<00:02:56.790> to

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
difference here is it's conforming to

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.899 
difference here is it's conforming to
the<00:02:57.030> underlying<00:02:57.510> surface<00:02:58.140> so<00:02:58.829> as<00:02:58.859> I<00:02:59.159> go<00:02:59.340> around

00:02:59.899 --> 00:02:59.909 
the underlying surface so as I go around

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:02.660 
the underlying surface so as I go around
it'll<00:03:00.329> conform<00:03:00.900> to<00:03:01.140> that<00:03:01.290> and<00:03:01.560> it'll<00:03:02.280> just

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
it'll conform to that and it'll just

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.460 
it'll conform to that and it'll just
allow<00:03:02.940> me<00:03:03.150> again<00:03:03.659> to<00:03:03.870> consider<00:03:04.260> the

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
allow me again to consider the

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.630 
allow me again to consider the
underlying<00:03:04.650> geometry<00:03:05.370> and<00:03:06.349> conform<00:03:07.349> or<00:03:07.890> in

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
underlying geometry and conform or in

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.149 
underlying geometry and conform or in
this<00:03:08.760> case<00:03:08.970> relaxed<00:03:09.420> to<00:03:09.629> conform<00:03:10.129> to<00:03:11.129> that

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:11.159 
this case relaxed to conform to that

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:13.300 
this case relaxed to conform to that
geometry

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
geometry

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.520 
geometry
we<00:03:13.970> can<00:03:14.090> also<00:03:14.209> scale<00:03:14.660> some<00:03:14.990> of<00:03:15.140> our<00:03:15.290> our

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
we can also scale some of our our

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.170 
we can also scale some of our our
geometry<00:03:16.190> so<00:03:16.400> I'll<00:03:16.640> just<00:03:16.819> kind<00:03:17.030> of<00:03:17.060> adjust

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
geometry so I'll just kind of adjust

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:18.580 
geometry so I'll just kind of adjust
some<00:03:17.480> of<00:03:17.540> the<00:03:17.660> scale<00:03:17.900> up<00:03:18.200> here<00:03:18.410> in<00:03:18.500> the

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
some of the scale up here in the

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.920 
some of the scale up here in the
pinching<00:03:19.010> perhaps<00:03:19.760> we<00:03:19.970> you<00:03:20.300> know<00:03:20.420> we<00:03:20.630> if<00:03:20.780> we

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
pinching perhaps we you know we if we

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.559 
pinching perhaps we you know we if we
need<00:03:21.080> to<00:03:21.110> rotate<00:03:21.700> we<00:03:22.700> can<00:03:22.850> rotate<00:03:23.090> the

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:23.569 
need to rotate we can rotate the

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:25.390 
need to rotate we can rotate the
geometry<00:03:24.080> as<00:03:24.170> well<00:03:24.350> to<00:03:24.560> adjust<00:03:24.920> some<00:03:25.160> of<00:03:25.280> it

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
geometry as well to adjust some of it

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.240 
geometry as well to adjust some of it
there<00:03:25.640> maybe<00:03:26.030> adjust<00:03:26.990> some<00:03:27.200> of<00:03:27.230> the<00:03:27.470> rotation

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
there maybe adjust some of the rotation

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.140 
there maybe adjust some of the rotation
of<00:03:28.340> the<00:03:28.520> topology<00:03:29.300> in<00:03:30.080> the<00:03:30.260> arm<00:03:30.470> area<00:03:30.980> and<00:03:31.190> if

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
of the topology in the arm area and if

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:33.640 
of the topology in the arm area and if
we<00:03:32.300> need<00:03:32.510> to<00:03:32.690> move<00:03:32.840> it<00:03:33.020> as<00:03:33.140> well<00:03:33.319> we<00:03:33.440> can<00:03:33.560> do

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
we need to move it as well we can do

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:34.570 
we need to move it as well we can do
that<00:03:33.770> and<00:03:33.890> you<00:03:33.950> can<00:03:34.069> see<00:03:34.190> I've<00:03:34.280> moved<00:03:34.489> it

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:34.580 
that and you can see I've moved it

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.699 
that and you can see I've moved it
around<00:03:34.700> a<00:03:34.940> little<00:03:35.030> bit<00:03:35.180> so<00:03:35.870> we'll<00:03:36.020> just<00:03:36.260> pop<00:03:36.470> in

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:36.709 
around a little bit so we'll just pop in

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:39.610 
around a little bit so we'll just pop in
and<00:03:36.950> get<00:03:37.160> our<00:03:37.370> relaxed<00:03:37.940> tool<00:03:38.090> and<00:03:38.360> relax<00:03:39.319> all

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
and get our relaxed tool and relax all

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.610 
and get our relaxed tool and relax all
the<00:03:39.680> geometry<00:03:40.010> back<00:03:40.520> into<00:03:40.880> there<00:03:41.350> that's<00:03:42.350> the

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
the geometry back into there that's the

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.410 
the geometry back into there that's the
main<00:03:42.920> conform<00:03:43.610> tool<00:03:43.850> there<00:03:44.000> are<00:03:44.060> a<00:03:44.120> couple<00:03:44.270> of

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
main conform tool there are a couple of

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:45.940 
main conform tool there are a couple of
other<00:03:44.600> interesting<00:03:44.870> things<00:03:45.200> that<00:03:45.440> we<00:03:45.650> can<00:03:45.800> do

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
other interesting things that we can do

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:47.650 
other interesting things that we can do
with<00:03:46.100> conform<00:03:46.550> and<00:03:46.700> it<00:03:46.820> has<00:03:47.060> to<00:03:47.209> do<00:03:47.330> with<00:03:47.360> over

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
with conform and it has to do with over

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.780 
with conform and it has to do with over
here<00:03:47.840> on<00:03:47.959> the<00:03:48.080> legs<00:03:48.350> the<00:03:48.920> conform<00:03:49.310> tools<00:03:49.550> work

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
here on the legs the conform tools work

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:51.400 
here on the legs the conform tools work
really<00:03:50.060> well<00:03:50.300> when<00:03:50.510> we<00:03:50.660> actually<00:03:50.810> have<00:03:51.230> to

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
really well when we actually have to

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.320 
really well when we actually have to
extend<00:03:51.800> geometry<00:03:52.580> and<00:03:52.760> continue<00:03:53.209> the

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:53.330 
extend geometry and continue the

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.509 
extend geometry and continue the
topology<00:03:53.630> process<00:03:54.320> so<00:03:54.560> I'm<00:03:55.010> gonna<00:03:55.190> be<00:03:55.310> using

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519 
topology process so I'm gonna be using

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:57.310 
topology process so I'm gonna be using
another<00:03:56.120> feature<00:03:56.360> here<00:03:56.630> called<00:03:56.660> extend

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:57.320 
another feature here called extend

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.460 
another feature here called extend
extend<00:03:57.590> isn't<00:03:58.069> new<00:03:58.250> to<00:03:58.780> 2011<00:03:59.780> it<00:03:59.930> was<00:04:00.050> actually

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
extend isn't new to 2011 it was actually

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.680 
extend isn't new to 2011 it was actually
in<00:04:00.620> 2010<00:04:01.340> it's<00:04:01.519> one<00:04:01.640> of<00:04:01.760> my<00:04:01.850> most<00:04:02.330> favorite

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:02.690 
in 2010 it's one of my most favorite

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:05.020 
in 2010 it's one of my most favorite
underrated<00:04:03.170> tools<00:04:03.410> and<00:04:04.340> you'll<00:04:04.489> see<00:04:04.670> why<00:04:04.819> here

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 
underrated tools and you'll see why here

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:06.940 
underrated tools and you'll see why here
in<00:04:05.090> a<00:04:05.150> minute<00:04:05.269> so<00:04:05.540> again<00:04:05.840> just<00:04:06.050> to<00:04:06.560> remind<00:04:06.680> you

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:06.950 
in a minute so again just to remind you

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:08.800 
in a minute so again just to remind you
I<00:04:07.040> have<00:04:07.069> surface<00:04:07.700> selected<00:04:08.120> and<00:04:08.269> I'm<00:04:08.360> using

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810 
I have surface selected and I'm using

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.040 
I have surface selected and I'm using
the<00:04:09.050> underlying<00:04:09.470> surface<00:04:09.980> as<00:04:10.510> my<00:04:11.510> template

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:12.050 
the underlying surface as my template

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:13.390 
the underlying surface as my template
and<00:04:12.260> I'm<00:04:12.440> gonna<00:04:12.560> go<00:04:12.800> ahead<00:04:12.890> and<00:04:13.010> use<00:04:13.250> the

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 
and I'm gonna go ahead and use the

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.420 
and I'm gonna go ahead and use the
extend<00:04:13.790> tool<00:04:14.000> now<00:04:14.630> with<00:04:14.810> extend<00:04:15.260> if<00:04:15.530> I<00:04:16.130> just

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
extend tool now with extend if I just

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.740 
extend tool now with extend if I just
hold<00:04:16.700> down<00:04:16.989> the<00:04:18.760> if<00:04:19.760> I<00:04:19.880> just<00:04:20.030> drag<00:04:20.239> a<00:04:20.269> polygon

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
hold down the if I just drag a polygon

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.200 
hold down the if I just drag a polygon
this<00:04:20.870> allows<00:04:21.140> me<00:04:21.320> to<00:04:21.350> drag<00:04:21.799> polygons<00:04:22.490> directly

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
this allows me to drag polygons directly

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.659 
this allows me to drag polygons directly
on<00:04:23.330> this<00:04:23.450> onto<00:04:24.020> that<00:04:24.200> underlying<00:04:24.650> surface<00:04:24.890> but

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:25.669 
on this onto that underlying surface but

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:27.430 
on this onto that underlying surface but
I<00:04:25.729> don't<00:04:26.000> want<00:04:26.150> to<00:04:26.210> do<00:04:26.330> grow<00:04:26.960> I<00:04:26.990> don't<00:04:27.200> want<00:04:27.380> to

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
I don't want to do grow I don't want to

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.920 
I don't want to do grow I don't want to
grow<00:04:27.620> that<00:04:27.890> ring<00:04:28.310> one<00:04:28.970> polygon<00:04:29.450> at<00:04:29.570> a<00:04:29.600> time<00:04:29.900> I

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:29.930 
grow that ring one polygon at a time I

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:32.500 
grow that ring one polygon at a time I
actually<00:04:30.200> want<00:04:30.500> to<00:04:31.030> continue<00:04:32.030> the<00:04:32.180> topology

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:32.510 
actually want to continue the topology

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:35.830 
actually want to continue the topology
with<00:04:33.229> the<00:04:33.350> entire<00:04:33.650> ring<00:04:33.950> so<00:04:34.280> using<00:04:35.060> ctrl<00:04:35.419> +<00:04:35.570> alt

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840 
with the entire ring so using ctrl + alt

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.380 
with the entire ring so using ctrl + alt
I<00:04:36.169> can<00:04:36.770> just<00:04:36.979> continue<00:04:37.490> to<00:04:37.550> grow<00:04:37.820> the<00:04:38.060> topology

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:38.390 
I can just continue to grow the topology

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:40.540 
I can just continue to grow the topology
down<00:04:38.810> there<00:04:38.990> you'll<00:04:39.140> see<00:04:39.320> once<00:04:39.979> it<00:04:40.130> starts<00:04:40.430> to

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
down there you'll see once it starts to

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:45.650 
down there you'll see once it starts to
hit<00:04:40.729> the<00:04:41.440> bend<00:04:42.440> in<00:04:42.800> the<00:04:42.830> leg<00:04:43.190> the<00:04:43.729> geometry

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660 
hit the bend in the leg the geometry

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.580 
hit the bend in the leg the geometry
kind<00:04:46.660> of<00:04:46.720> spreads<00:04:46.990> out<00:04:47.110> a<00:04:47.169> little<00:04:47.349> bit<00:04:47.560> so

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590 
kind of spreads out a little bit so

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.279 
kind of spreads out a little bit so
we'll<00:04:48.190> go<00:04:48.340> ahead<00:04:48.370> and<00:04:48.819> do<00:04:49.780> that<00:04:49.930> again<00:04:50.259> and

00:04:50.279 --> 00:04:50.289 
we'll go ahead and do that again and

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:53.040 
we'll go ahead and do that again and
I'll<00:04:50.770> just<00:04:50.979> keep<00:04:51.160> doing<00:04:51.490> it

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.050 
I'll just keep doing it

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.080 
I'll just keep doing it
so<00:04:53.680> we're<00:04:53.860> a<00:04:53.889> little<00:04:53.949> farther<00:04:54.340> down<00:04:54.639> the

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.090 
so we're a little farther down the

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:56.640 
so we're a little farther down the
process<00:04:55.479> a<00:04:55.750> little<00:04:55.900> bit<00:04:56.110> you<00:04:56.259> can<00:04:56.379> see<00:04:56.410> I've

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:56.650 
process a little bit you can see I've

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:58.529 
process a little bit you can see I've
started<00:04:56.680> to<00:04:57.160> round<00:04:57.460> the<00:04:57.610> corner<00:04:58.030> here<00:04:58.330> on<00:04:58.449> the

00:04:58.529 --> 00:04:58.539 
started to round the corner here on the

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:00.629 
started to round the corner here on the
inside<00:04:58.900> of<00:04:58.990> the<00:04:59.080> ankle<00:04:59.410> so<00:05:00.069> I'll<00:05:00.160> go<00:05:00.280> ahead<00:05:00.340> and

00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:00.639 
inside of the ankle so I'll go ahead and

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:02.369 
inside of the ankle so I'll go ahead and
just<00:05:00.849> kind<00:05:01.030> of<00:05:01.090> use<00:05:01.270> relax<00:05:01.629> a<00:05:01.780> little<00:05:01.870> bit<00:05:02.050> here

00:05:02.369 --> 00:05:02.379 
just kind of use relax a little bit here

00:05:02.379 --> 00:05:05.610 
just kind of use relax a little bit here
and<00:05:02.500> then<00:05:03.099> I'll<00:05:03.430> use<00:05:03.940> my<00:05:04.300> conform<00:05:04.870> move<00:05:05.199> this

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:05.620 
and then I'll use my conform move this

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:07.860 
and then I'll use my conform move this
allows<00:05:05.889> me<00:05:06.159> to<00:05:06.400> do<00:05:06.550> transform<00:05:07.180> adjustments

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:07.870 
allows me to do transform adjustments

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:13.290 
allows me to do transform adjustments
based<00:05:08.110> on<00:05:08.729> the<00:05:09.729> underlying<00:05:10.740> topology<00:05:12.180> and<00:05:13.180> I

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:13.300 
based on the underlying topology and I

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:14.999 
based on the underlying topology and I
can<00:05:13.479> fix<00:05:13.690> that<00:05:13.870> now<00:05:14.080> we<00:05:14.139> also<00:05:14.500> probably<00:05:14.860> need

00:05:14.999 --> 00:05:15.009 
can fix that now we also probably need

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:17.969 
can fix that now we also probably need
to<00:05:15.099> start<00:05:15.310> rotating<00:05:15.550> the<00:05:15.940> topology<00:05:16.629> to<00:05:17.440> start

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:17.979 
to start rotating the topology to start

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:19.320 
to start rotating the topology to start
coming<00:05:18.190> around<00:05:18.340> the<00:05:18.669> back<00:05:18.849> of<00:05:19.030> the<00:05:19.120> ankle

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:19.330 
coming around the back of the ankle

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:20.879 
coming around the back of the ankle
there<00:05:19.780> so<00:05:19.930> I'm<00:05:20.020> going<00:05:20.139> to<00:05:20.229> increase<00:05:20.440> the<00:05:20.560> size

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:20.889 
there so I'm going to increase the size

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:23.490 
there so I'm going to increase the size
a<00:05:20.919> little<00:05:21.099> bit<00:05:21.430> and<00:05:21.750> I<00:05:22.750> can<00:05:22.780> start<00:05:23.289> rotating

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:23.500 
a little bit and I can start rotating

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:28.629 
a little bit and I can start rotating
and<00:05:24.990> I'll<00:05:25.990> go<00:05:26.289> ahead<00:05:26.349> and<00:05:26.770> move

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:28.639 
and I'll go ahead and move

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:33.100 
and I'll go ahead and move
I'll<00:05:29.330> move<00:05:29.539> this<00:05:29.719> up

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:33.110 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:35.080 

and<00:05:33.259> you<00:05:33.349> can<00:05:33.500> see<00:05:33.710> that<00:05:33.919> I'm<00:05:34.039> you<00:05:34.669> know<00:05:34.759> again

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:35.090 
and you can see that I'm you know again

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:37.020 
and you can see that I'm you know again
basically<00:05:35.569> just<00:05:35.810> sculpting<00:05:36.470> around

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:37.030 
basically just sculpting around

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:39.969 
basically just sculpting around
sculpting<00:05:38.030> around<00:05:38.330> the<00:05:38.479> model<00:05:38.800> around<00:05:39.800> the

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:39.979 
sculpting around the model around the

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:41.860 
sculpting around the model around the
underlying<00:05:40.340> model<00:05:40.699> that<00:05:40.819> is<00:05:40.970> no<00:05:41.150> use<00:05:41.360> relax<00:05:41.659> to

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:41.870 
underlying model that is no use relax to

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:44.040 
underlying model that is no use relax to
kind<00:05:42.080> of<00:05:42.139> clean<00:05:42.319> it<00:05:42.349> up

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:44.050 
kind of clean it up

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:46.659 
kind of clean it up
so<00:05:45.050> I've<00:05:45.289> jumped<00:05:45.560> ahead<00:05:45.680> to<00:05:45.919> show<00:05:46.099> the<00:05:46.280> final

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:46.669 
so I've jumped ahead to show the final

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:49.719 
so I've jumped ahead to show the final
model<00:05:46.849> here<00:05:47.330> and<00:05:47.599> you<00:05:48.379> can<00:05:48.530> see<00:05:48.770> that<00:05:49.039> using

00:05:49.719 --> 00:05:49.729 
model here and you can see that using

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:53.200 
model here and you can see that using
this<00:05:49.909> workflow<00:05:50.270> of<00:05:51.219> extend<00:05:52.219> and<00:05:52.580> conform

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:53.210 
this workflow of extend and conform

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:55.990 
this workflow of extend and conform
we're<00:05:54.050> able<00:05:54.110> to<00:05:54.409> quickly<00:05:54.620> reach<00:05:55.039> apologize<00:05:55.699> a

we're able to quickly reach apologize a

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.379 
we're able to quickly reach apologize a
