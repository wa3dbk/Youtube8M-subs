one I find really really difficult let's

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.740 
one I find really really difficult let's
do<00:02:38.220> an<00:02:38.340> easy<00:02:38.460> one<00:02:38.730> so<00:02:38.910> basically<00:02:39.360> this<00:02:39.420> one<00:02:39.630> we

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
do an easy one so basically this one we

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.720 
do an easy one so basically this one we
slide<00:02:40.140> the<00:02:40.320> Box<00:02:40.500> blocks<00:02:40.950> around<00:02:41.130> just<00:02:41.580> to

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
slide the Box blocks around just to

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.460 
slide the Box blocks around just to
complete<00:02:42.210> this<00:02:42.360> circuit<00:02:42.780> and<00:02:42.960> this<00:02:43.110> one<00:02:43.290> is<00:02:43.440> a

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
complete this circuit and this one is a

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.990 
complete this circuit and this one is a
such<00:02:43.920> as<00:02:44.070> the<00:02:44.190> first<00:02:44.370> love<00:02:44.550> was<00:02:44.640> pretty<00:02:44.850> easy
