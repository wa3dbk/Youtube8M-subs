00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.250
 hello in this class we will learn to 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.259
 solve first degree equations the 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.630
 process of manipulating the 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.509
 first degree is simple is similar to 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:15.030
 process of solving an equation 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.190
 the difference here in an equation instead 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.699
 of having an inequality signal 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.769
 we have a sign of equality in this 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.630
 in case we have an equation of the first 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.240
 degree 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:28.410
 changing this equality by a sign of 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.320
 bigger 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.329
 the less we will have an inadequacy 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.510
 in this case a major signal then I am 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.489
 stating that the left theme inspection 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.149
 left is greater than the expression at 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.940
 right 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.760
 our goal here will be to discover the 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.550
 values of x satisfying this 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.940
 information, or this inequality 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.640
 Okay so come on it's the first thing that 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.219
 we must remember at the time of 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.320
 solve a first-degree equation is 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.500
 the next that when we multiply 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:04.619
 an equation for the negative value 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.080
 sign of inequality changes for example 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:11.549
 if I multiply this whole equation 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:15.210
 put - 1 then the situation will stay the 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:20.280
 next form will get less 2 x here 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:24.119
 because more 2 x 2 - 1 - 2 x + 1 time - 1 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.530
 - 1 and the signal that is greater becomes 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.939
 smaller 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:32.250
 and here until 3x becomes less 3 x 1 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.229
 then we must observe this fact that 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.220
 occurs in the resolution of an equation 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.040
 first degree 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:42.360
 Okay, let's solve this first one 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:45.479
 example here you will observe how it is 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:48.780
 process to solve this problem. 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:51.000
 equation we must isolate the x 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.040
 so we will take everything that 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.869
 all themes you have x and put 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.500
 all on the left side then will get to 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:01.259
 as follows 2 x 1 here I have 13 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:04.079
 x on the right side then it will come by 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:07.700
 to the left side with operation and see 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:11.060
 as it is positive and light with negative 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:13.800
 How is he adding up, will he come here? 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.990
 subtracting 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:24.220
 solving the first part we have 2 x 1 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:25.390
 - 3 x 1 x will be less right most equal to 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.270
 -1 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:31.390
 Notice we owe this to the xv who has 1 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:33.220
 - x then what do I do to stay 1 x 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.390
 positive I need to multiply by 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.610
 one less 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.950
 so let's go multiplying all the 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:41.770
 equation for minus one will not change the 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.840
 equation is not what goes until what goes 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.920
 happen to the - says to stay positive 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:50.100
 so it will stay this way 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:52.480
 - x times - 1 - with less gives more stays x 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.700
 greater when we multiply by a 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:58.959
 negative number it reverses and becomes 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:03.310
 be less and less 1 time less 11 becomes 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:05.080
 be another primes solve this 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.239
 lecture first equation and this 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:10.000
 means that the packet any values 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:12.489
 of x smaller than the rest of the population 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.280
 They said that is satisfied it is 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:17.410
 pressure will be greater than this is the other 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.350
 is the solution can also be described from 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:23.350
 next way solution will be who will 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:25.390
 be all x belonging to the real 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:29.260
 means that it can be any number 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:32.140
 provided that it is satisfied that the 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:37.570
 This condition, that is, oo, has to be 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:44.140
 more less than we do a close 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:46.120
 example b example b 3 x over two more 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.620
 3 greater than a text we should 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.260
 find out what the different values are 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:52.239
 which will satisfy this equation to 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.250
 solve this equation is interesting to 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:58.030
 eliminate the denominators of these 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:59.920
 fractions okay will look similar to the example 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.530
 and then we can solve it quietly 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:05.019
 to eliminate the denominators 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.840
 we need to find the common mime show 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:14.650
 of 2 and 3 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:16.510
 the m mc of 2 and 3 in c 6 ok they are 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.289
 cousins ​​then multiply times three 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.630
 of six 

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:23.010
 then we re-enter this equation of 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:23.010
 The next way is going to stay 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:36.800
 the following form governors is that 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:43.880
 we will get as follows 6/23 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:46.430
 times 39 x 6 divided by the governor of 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:50.150
 3 determined 31 because he has not 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:53.980
 Fear not take it anymore and 16/1 is six 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:53.980
 times three 18 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:05:03.050
 that this side 6/3 22 times 12 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:05.120
 ok this equation can be represented 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:07.610
 this way because we did it because 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:09.590
 now we can eliminate 16 on this side of the 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:11.420
 six - sided because because if 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:14.030
 multiplied in the equation by a number 

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:20.570
 positive animation notes she then gets 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:23.660
 multiply this action by six goes 

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:25.730
 appear here by multiplying everything and 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:28.070
 It will appear about three here explaining 2 

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:31.820
 with these feats when she meets 6 and 

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:38.900
 6 0 2 6 and we have the following equation 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:40.880
 to solve 9 x + 18 greater than two 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:44.000
 and then it will get easier to solve 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:46.880
 9 x let's isolate here will get 9 x 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.160
 greater than two states right side 

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:51.350
 continues on the right 18 is on the side 

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:53.750
 left will move to the other side 

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:59.090
 with less 18 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:06:05.890
 then we have that 9x is greater than 2 - 

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:12.410
 18 is equal to minus 16 and we have to 

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:19.790
 do in the front and x will be bigger than 

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:21.800
 less 16/91 rock the new one is 

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:24.320
 multiplying x so he comes here 

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:28.370
 dividing with operation instead of an x goes 

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:30.380
 be greater than less 16 on 91 rock 

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:33.650
 Let's take another example there for 

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:34.940
 terminate example 63 greater than or equal to 7 

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:36.830
 x 1 - 1 

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:38.810
 Let's solve it Let's find out what are 

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:39.670
 paulo de x that will satisfy this 

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:41.900
 high 

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:42.860
 Let's spend the time we have for the 

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:44.449
 left side 

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:50.059
 I have seven more 

00:06:44.449 --> 00:06:52.789
 I came as less 7x larger 

00:06:50.059 --> 00:06:55.729
 The train is on the left side. 

00:06:52.789 --> 00:06:57.680
 move to the right side as - 31 - 

00:06:55.729 --> 00:06:59.900
 one is on the right side and remains 

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:01.939
 on the right with at least one 

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:04.849
 note that the term that has x it is 

00:07:01.939 --> 00:07:06.379
 negative we have here - 7 x then we should 

00:07:04.849 --> 00:07:08.659
 multiply with at least one 

00:07:06.379 --> 00:07:09.669
 multiplying the whole equation by less 

00:07:08.659 --> 00:07:16.520
 one 

00:07:09.669 --> 00:07:24.099
 we will have 7 x the signal of greater equal 

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:27.560
 becomes less equal - 3 - 1 - 4 

00:07:24.099 --> 00:07:30.289
 isolating x we have that x will be smaller 

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:30.770
 even the set is multiplying comes to 

00:07:30.289 --> 00:07:33.680
 here 

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:36.409
 dividing xix must be less than or equal 

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:39.319
 at least four sub 17 

00:07:36.409 --> 00:07:42.050
 I hope to help you in the next class we 

00:07:39.319 --> 00:07:45.680
 let's work with is inadequacy 

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:48.339
 product and conscious inequation then 

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:48.339
 it was worth it
