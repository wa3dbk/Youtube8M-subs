really wet we like it very wet that's
why<00:01:47.490> you<00:01:47.549> never<00:01:47.820> put<00:01:48.149> these<00:01:48.270> runs<00:01:48.630> in<00:01:48.899> your

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
or at least where we live that means

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.680 
or at least where we live that means
you've<00:01:58.460> got<00:01:58.610> to<00:01:58.730> keep<00:01:58.850> them<00:01:58.970> in<00:01:59.150> a<00:01:59.180> special<00:02:00.040> bin

you give them too much at one time this
starts<00:02:36.530> to<00:02:36.620> heat<00:02:36.830> up<00:02:36.860> like<00:02:37.010> a<00:02:37.220> compost<00:02:37.670> pile

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
starts to heat up like a compost pile

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.030 
starts to heat up like a compost pile
the<00:02:38.750> worms<00:02:38.960> don't<00:02:39.140> like<00:02:39.440> it<00:02:39.620> they<00:02:39.740> like<00:02:39.890> to

the worms don't like it they like to
stay<00:02:40.250> cool<00:02:40.580> and<00:02:41.230> moist<00:02:42.230> so<00:02:42.740> in<00:02:43.250> here<00:02:43.550> yeah<00:02:43.970> at

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.330 
yeah yeah lots of worms now this was the
proverbial<00:03:05.720> handful<00:03:06.500> that<00:03:06.680> I<00:03:06.770> started<00:03:07.160> out

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
proverbial handful that I started out

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.090 
proverbial handful that I started out
with<00:03:07.690> not<00:03:08.690> these<00:03:08.900> exact<00:03:09.260> worms<00:03:09.530> but<00:03:09.950> this

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
with not these exact worms but this

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.570 
with not these exact worms but this
amount<00:03:10.370> of<00:03:10.550> worms<00:03:10.820> and<00:03:11.410> they<00:03:12.410> just<00:03:12.739> as<00:03:13.220> long<00:03:13.489> as

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.580 
amount of worms and they just as long as

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.150 
amount of worms and they just as long as
you<00:03:13.700> feed<00:03:13.970> them<00:03:14.209> and<00:03:14.450> keep<00:03:14.630> them<00:03:14.780> in<00:03:14.930> these

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
you feed them and keep them in these

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.520 
you feed them and keep them in these
conditions<00:03:16.160> they<00:03:16.970> are<00:03:17.540> faster<00:03:18.230> than<00:03:18.320> rabbits

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
conditions they are faster than rabbits

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.009 
conditions they are faster than rabbits
and<00:03:19.270> before<00:03:20.270> you<00:03:20.330> know<00:03:20.480> it<00:03:20.600> you've<00:03:20.720> got<00:03:20.840> lots

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:22.570 
and before you know it you've got lots
of<00:03:21.170> worms<00:03:21.350> and<00:03:21.650> you<00:03:21.709> can<00:03:21.830> give<00:03:21.980> some<00:03:22.160> or<00:03:22.310> employ

of worms and you can give some or employ

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.930 
of worms and you can give some or employ
other<00:03:22.910> people<00:03:23.330> and<00:03:24.340> they<00:03:25.340> can<00:03:25.519> start<00:03:25.730> their

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
other people and they can start their

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:27.339 
other people and they can start their
own<00:03:26.000> worm<00:03:26.390> bin

00:03:27.339 --> 00:03:27.349 
own worm bin

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:31.629 
own worm bin
they<00:03:28.280> make<00:03:28.489> great<00:03:29.920> we<00:03:30.920> don't<00:03:31.040> really<00:03:31.249> call<00:03:31.489> it

they make great we don't really call it

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:33.039 
they make great we don't really call it
dirt<00:03:31.909> because<00:03:32.269> we<00:03:32.389> don't<00:03:32.540> use<00:03:32.689> it<00:03:32.840> in<00:03:32.930> the

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:33.049 
dirt because we don't use it in the

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:37.479 
dirt because we don't use it in the
garden<00:03:33.409> we<00:03:33.620> only<00:03:33.859> use<00:03:34.219> what<00:03:34.939> they<00:03:35.120> produce<00:03:36.489> to

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:37.489 
garden we only use what they produce to

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:39.910 
garden we only use what they produce to
grow<00:03:37.760> special<00:03:38.510> seeds<00:03:38.810> and<00:03:39.139> seedlings<00:03:39.439> and

grow special seeds and seedlings and

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.890 
grow special seeds and seedlings and
cuttings<00:03:40.280> in<00:03:40.489> that<00:03:41.389> way<00:03:41.599> we<00:03:41.780> know<00:03:42.049> that<00:03:43.900> the

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
cuttings in that way we know that the

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.959 
cuttings in that way we know that the
seeds<00:03:45.200> are<00:03:45.379> going<00:03:45.469> to<00:03:45.530> germinate<00:03:45.849> look<00:03:46.849> at

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:46.969 
seeds are going to germinate look at

00:03:46.969 --> 00:03:50.830 
seeds are going to germinate look at
this<00:03:47.060> so<00:03:47.299> rich<00:03:47.540> that<00:03:47.780> is<00:03:48.849> that's<00:03:49.849> that's<00:03:50.359> just

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
this so rich that is that's that's just

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.009 
this so rich that is that's that's just
what<00:03:51.019> they<00:03:51.139> turn<00:03:51.379> all<00:03:51.560> this<00:03:51.680> stuff<00:03:51.950> into

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:53.019 
what they turn all this stuff into

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:55.709 
what they turn all this stuff into
doesn't<00:03:54.019> smell

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:55.719 
doesn't smell

00:03:55.719 --> 00:03:59.500 
doesn't smell
it's<00:03:56.719> just<00:03:56.959> neutral<00:03:57.760> and<00:03:58.760> if<00:03:58.909> you<00:03:59.090> mix<00:03:59.329> this

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 
it's just neutral and if you mix this

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:02.740 
it's just neutral and if you mix this
half-and-half<00:04:00.049> with<00:04:00.590> peat<00:04:00.829> moss<00:04:01.540> it's<00:04:02.540> the

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:02.750 
half-and-half with peat moss it's the

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:04.690 
half-and-half with peat moss it's the
perfect<00:04:03.260> medium<00:04:03.799> for<00:04:04.040> starting<00:04:04.669> seeds

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:04.700 
perfect medium for starting seeds

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:08.349 
perfect medium for starting seeds
cuttings<00:04:05.540> the<00:04:05.750> seedlings<00:04:06.199> but<00:04:07.180> then<00:04:08.180> when<00:04:08.299> you

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:08.359 
cuttings the seedlings but then when you

go to transplant those out in the garden

00:04:10.219 --> 00:04:12.390 
go to transplant those out in the garden
you<00:04:10.280> want<00:04:10.400> to<00:04:10.549> make<00:04:10.669> sure<00:04:10.699> that<00:04:11.120> you<00:04:11.269> integrate

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
you want to make sure that you integrate

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.490 
you want to make sure that you integrate
the<00:04:13.400> medium<00:04:13.849> that<00:04:14.000> they're<00:04:14.269> in<00:04:14.810> with<00:04:15.379> the

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:15.500 
the medium that they're in with the

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:18.449 
the medium that they're in with the
medium<00:04:15.829> that<00:04:15.980> they're<00:04:16.160> going<00:04:16.340> into<00:04:16.840> otherwise

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
medium that they're going into otherwise

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:20.680 
medium that they're going into otherwise
the<00:04:19.459> roots<00:04:19.699> can't<00:04:19.970> make<00:04:20.150> a<00:04:20.180> transition

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:20.690 
the roots can't make a transition

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:22.659 
the roots can't make a transition
they'll<00:04:21.019> just<00:04:21.169> like<00:04:21.440> stay<00:04:21.799> here<00:04:22.099> like<00:04:22.310> I<00:04:22.430> want

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:22.669 
they'll just like stay here like I want

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:25.570 
they'll just like stay here like I want
to<00:04:22.699> stay<00:04:22.880> here<00:04:23.090> and<00:04:23.240> they<00:04:23.300> won't<00:04:23.479> grow<00:04:23.710> so<00:04:24.710> you

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:25.580 
to stay here and they won't grow so you

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:27.129 
to stay here and they won't grow so you
got<00:04:25.759> to<00:04:25.880> sort<00:04:26.000> of<00:04:26.060> like<00:04:26.180> spread<00:04:26.539> it<00:04:26.660> out<00:04:26.780> and

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:27.139 
got to sort of like spread it out and

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:29.890 
got to sort of like spread it out and
mix<00:04:27.889> it<00:04:28.039> together<00:04:28.130> so<00:04:28.610> that<00:04:28.639> roots<00:04:29.180> don't

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
mix it together so that roots don't

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.360 
mix it together so that roots don't
really<00:04:30.169> know<00:04:30.320> that<00:04:30.349> they<00:04:30.590> got<00:04:30.710> moved<00:04:31.070> and<00:04:31.280> they

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.370 
really know that they got moved and they

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:34.420 
really know that they got moved and they
just<00:04:31.580> go<00:04:31.759> on<00:04:31.880> out<00:04:32.120> and<00:04:32.150> keep<00:04:32.479> going<00:04:33.190> so<00:04:34.190> the

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:34.430 
just go on out and keep going so the

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.339 
just go on out and keep going so the
other<00:04:34.580> trick<00:04:34.880> is<00:04:35.060> how<00:04:35.270> to<00:04:35.330> get<00:04:35.599> the<00:04:35.720> worms<00:04:35.960> out

00:04:36.339 --> 00:04:36.349 
other trick is how to get the worms out

00:04:36.349 --> 00:04:39.040 
other trick is how to get the worms out
of<00:04:36.590> the<00:04:37.090> castings<00:04:38.090> when<00:04:38.270> you're<00:04:38.449> ready<00:04:38.630> to<00:04:38.900> mix

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050 
of the castings when you're ready to mix

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:44.320 
of the castings when you're ready to mix
it<00:04:39.259> in<00:04:39.349> with<00:04:39.560> the<00:04:41.620> beet<00:04:42.620> moss<00:04:43.030> there's<00:04:44.030> a<00:04:44.120> real

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
it in with the beet moss there's a real

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.270 
it in with the beet moss there's a real
easy<00:04:44.509> method<00:04:45.110> to<00:04:45.139> do<00:04:45.380> is<00:04:45.530> kind<00:04:45.860> of<00:04:45.889> fun<00:04:46.130> you

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:46.280 
easy method to do is kind of fun you

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.399 
easy method to do is kind of fun you
just<00:04:46.310> get<00:04:46.580> a<00:04:46.610> bunch<00:04:46.789> of<00:04:46.940> people<00:04:47.120> before<00:04:47.930> the

00:04:48.399 --> 00:04:48.409 
just get a bunch of people before the

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:51.580 
just get a bunch of people before the
four<00:04:48.590> or<00:04:48.680> five<00:04:48.860> people<00:04:49.419> you<00:04:50.419> get<00:04:50.599> a<00:04:50.659> big<00:04:51.320> piece

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590 
four or five people you get a big piece

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:55.240 
four or five people you get a big piece
of<00:04:51.909> impermeable<00:04:53.110> surface<00:04:54.110> it's<00:04:54.740> like<00:04:55.070> that

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:55.250 
of impermeable surface it's like that

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:59.260 
of impermeable surface it's like that
piece<00:04:55.520> of<00:04:56.050> Formica<00:04:57.050> or<00:04:58.009> Formica<00:04:58.430> top<00:04:58.789> whatever

00:04:59.260 --> 00:04:59.270 
piece of Formica or Formica top whatever

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:02.469 
piece of Formica or Formica top whatever
or<00:05:00.169> piece<00:05:00.409> of<00:05:00.440> hard<00:05:00.710> plastic<00:05:00.770> or<00:05:01.610> some<00:05:02.300> nice

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:02.479 
or piece of hard plastic or some nice

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:05.110 
or piece of hard plastic or some nice
temporary<00:05:02.960> glass<00:05:03.199> just<00:05:04.039> put<00:05:04.310> that<00:05:04.490> down<00:05:04.550> where

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:05.120 
temporary glass just put that down where

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.120 
temporary glass just put that down where
you<00:05:05.240> can<00:05:05.389> all<00:05:05.539> get<00:05:05.720> around<00:05:05.960> it<00:05:06.229> and<00:05:06.409> you<00:05:07.070> just

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.130 
you can all get around it and you just

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:10.510 
you can all get around it and you just
take<00:05:07.520> these<00:05:07.729> this<00:05:08.360> whole<00:05:08.659> bin<00:05:08.979> and<00:05:09.979> you<00:05:10.340> just

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:10.520 
take these this whole bin and you just

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.959 
take these this whole bin and you just
put<00:05:11.030> it<00:05:11.180> right<00:05:11.360> on<00:05:12.139> the<00:05:12.289> table<00:05:12.820> and<00:05:13.820> you<00:05:13.940> just

00:05:13.959 --> 00:05:13.969 
put it right on the table and you just

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:15.999 
put it right on the table and you just
got<00:05:14.180> this<00:05:14.300> big<00:05:14.630> mound<00:05:14.960> first<00:05:15.469> you<00:05:15.590> take<00:05:15.800> all

00:05:15.999 --> 00:05:16.009 
got this big mound first you take all

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:18.279 
got this big mound first you take all
the<00:05:16.190> loose<00:05:16.370> stuff<00:05:16.639> off<00:05:16.849> of<00:05:17.120> course<00:05:17.360> so<00:05:18.169> that

00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:18.289 
the loose stuff off of course so that

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:20.080 
the loose stuff off of course so that
you're<00:05:18.440> really<00:05:18.620> only<00:05:18.800> starting<00:05:19.430> out<00:05:19.580> with<00:05:19.820> the

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:20.090 
you're really only starting out with the

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:22.870 
you're really only starting out with the
really<00:05:20.330> good<00:05:20.539> stuff<00:05:20.840> in<00:05:20.960> the<00:05:21.080> worms<00:05:21.729> so<00:05:22.729> you'll

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:22.880 
really good stuff in the worms so you'll

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.170 
really good stuff in the worms so you'll
have<00:05:23.000> a<00:05:23.060> really<00:05:23.870> large<00:05:24.110> pile<00:05:24.650> of<00:05:25.070> this<00:05:25.400> and<00:05:26.060> be

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:26.180 
have a really large pile of this and be

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:28.870 
have a really large pile of this and be
a<00:05:26.210> big<00:05:26.539> pop<00:05:26.930> and<00:05:27.770> then<00:05:28.070> what<00:05:28.219> you<00:05:28.340> do<00:05:28.490> is<00:05:28.639> you

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:28.880 
a big pop and then what you do is you

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:31.450 
a big pop and then what you do is you
just<00:05:28.909> go<00:05:29.539> around<00:05:29.810> the<00:05:29.930> pile<00:05:30.169> and<00:05:30.830> you<00:05:30.889> take<00:05:31.219> off

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:31.460 
just go around the pile and you take off

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.480 
just go around the pile and you take off
a<00:05:31.849> little<00:05:32.240> bit<00:05:32.509> off<00:05:32.719> the<00:05:32.900> edge

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:33.490 
a little bit off the edge

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:36.629 
a little bit off the edge
and<00:05:34.300> the<00:05:34.569> worms<00:05:34.780> they<00:05:35.470> know<00:05:35.710> for<00:05:36.460> some<00:05:36.610> reason

00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:36.639 
and the worms they know for some reason

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:38.879 
and the worms they know for some reason
how<00:05:37.120> they<00:05:37.270> do<00:05:37.419> this<00:05:37.600> but<00:05:37.900> they<00:05:38.350> go<00:05:38.530> to<00:05:38.590> the

00:05:38.879 --> 00:05:38.889 
how they do this but they go to the

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:40.830 
how they do this but they go to the
center<00:05:39.280> they<00:05:39.520> never<00:05:39.729> come<00:05:40.000> out<00:05:40.030> you<00:05:40.389> always<00:05:40.539> go

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:40.840 
center they never come out you always go

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.230 
center they never come out you always go
in<00:05:41.139> so<00:05:41.919> as<00:05:42.009> you<00:05:42.190> work<00:05:42.400> your<00:05:42.580> way<00:05:42.639> around<00:05:42.880> the

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:43.240 
in so as you work your way around the

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:46.650 
in so as you work your way around the
pile<00:05:43.979> the<00:05:44.979> worms<00:05:45.190> just<00:05:45.370> keep<00:05:45.699> going<00:05:46.060> in<00:05:46.389> and

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:46.660 
pile the worms just keep going in and

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:48.330 
pile the worms just keep going in and
the<00:05:46.990> stuff<00:05:47.259> that<00:05:47.289> you're<00:05:47.560> pulling<00:05:47.800> out<00:05:48.039> it's

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:48.340 
the stuff that you're pulling out it's

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:50.279 
the stuff that you're pulling out it's
going<00:05:48.550> to<00:05:48.610> be<00:05:48.699> worm<00:05:48.970> free<00:05:49.360> you<00:05:49.810> just<00:05:49.960> pull<00:05:50.169> it<00:05:50.199> a

00:05:50.279 --> 00:05:50.289 
going to be worm free you just pull it a

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:52.890 
going to be worm free you just pull it a
little<00:05:50.440> bit<00:05:50.590> out<00:05:50.710> at<00:05:51.099> time<00:05:51.430> the<00:05:51.759> worms<00:05:52.389> go<00:05:52.660> that

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:52.900 
little bit out at time the worms go that

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:55.110 
little bit out at time the worms go that
way<00:05:53.110> next<00:05:53.979> thing<00:05:54.220> you<00:05:54.310> know<00:05:54.490> you've<00:05:54.729> got<00:05:54.940> this

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:55.120 
way next thing you know you've got this

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.909 
way next thing you know you've got this
big<00:05:55.449> doughnut<00:05:56.110> of<00:05:56.319> worm<00:05:57.099> free<00:05:57.550> material<00:05:58.210> and

00:05:58.909 --> 00:05:58.919 
big doughnut of worm free material and

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:01.409 
big doughnut of worm free material and
just<00:05:59.919> a<00:06:00.039> whole<00:06:00.250> bunch<00:06:00.490> of<00:06:00.610> worms<00:06:00.849> right<00:06:01.240> in<00:06:01.330> the

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:01.419 
just a whole bunch of worms right in the

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:01.850 
just a whole bunch of worms right in the
middle

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:01.860 
middle

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:04.830
