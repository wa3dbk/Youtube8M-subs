that thick low end and still with the

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.400 
that thick low end and still with the
punchy<00:03:16.500> edge<00:03:16.650> from<00:03:17.810> you<00:03:18.810> know<00:03:18.870> the<00:03:19.110> other<00:03:19.260> high

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.590 

I<00:03:53.260> definitely<00:03:53.800> find<00:03:54.310> it<00:03:54.460> more<00:03:54.640> usable<00:03:55.060> with<00:03:55.570> a

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:55.600 
I definitely find it more usable with a

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.360 
I definitely find it more usable with a
p90<00:03:56.050> here<00:03:56.230> than<00:03:56.500> a<00:03:56.530> classic<00:03:57.040> hamburger

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
p90 here than a classic hamburger

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.120 
p90 here than a classic hamburger
because<00:03:57.610> a<00:03:58.030> classic<00:03:58.750> hamburger<00:03:58.870> and<00:03:59.290> the<00:04:00.010> neck

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.130 
because a classic hamburger and the neck

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.430 
because a classic hamburger and the neck
position<00:04:00.280> is<00:04:00.730> you<00:04:01.030> know<00:04:01.200> absolutely<00:04:02.200> great

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
position is you know absolutely great

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.220 
position is you know absolutely great
for<00:04:02.620> big<00:04:02.790> you<00:04:03.790> know<00:04:03.880> singing<00:04:04.210> leads<00:04:04.510> but<00:04:04.990> for

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
for big you know singing leads but for

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.490 
for big you know singing leads but for
rhythm<00:04:05.800> I<00:04:05.950> prefer<00:04:06.430> a<00:04:06.640> p90<00:04:07.210> much<00:04:07.960> more<00:04:08.230> because

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 
rhythm I prefer a p90 much more because

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
rhythm I prefer a p90 much more because
it's<00:04:08.680> more<00:04:08.740> open<00:04:09.190> if<00:04:09.580> I<00:04:09.670> add<00:04:09.820> more<00:04:09.970> gain<00:04:11.430> and<00:04:12.430> a

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:12.520 
it's more open if I add more gain and a

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.850 
it's more open if I add more gain and a
little<00:04:12.700> bit<00:04:12.790> of<00:04:12.880> slab<00:04:13.120> echo<00:04:13.480> I<00:04:13.660> can<00:04:14.500> also<00:04:14.620> get

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:14.860 
little bit of slab echo I can also get

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:19.130 
little bit of slab echo I can also get
that<00:04:14.980> you<00:04:15.400> know<00:04:15.520> singing<00:04:15.850> kind<00:04:16.390> of<00:04:16.510> /<00:04:17.380> ish

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.860 

I<00:04:34.520> guess<00:04:35.520> this<00:04:35.699> is<00:04:35.819> this<00:04:36.180> is<00:04:36.330> probably<00:04:36.720> the

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
I guess this is this is probably the

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:38.689 
I guess this is this is probably the
most<00:04:36.900> versatile<00:04:37.710> guitar<00:04:38.130> I<00:04:38.160> ever<00:04:38.460> tried

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:38.699

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:42.170 
most versatile guitar I ever tried
because<00:04:39.690> you<00:04:39.840> got<00:04:39.990> you<00:04:40.169> know<00:04:40.289> the<00:04:40.530> p90<00:04:41.180> you

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180 
because you got you know the p90 you

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:48.790 
because you got you know the p90 you
know<00:04:42.300> the<00:04:42.389> thick<00:04:42.599> rhythm<00:04:42.930> soul<00:04:43.229> sound<00:04:46.759> mmm

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800

thin<00:04:49.800> tele<00:04:50.310> sound<00:04:54.830> thick<00:04:55.830> humbucker<00:04:56.250> sound

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:00.590 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:08.940 

very<00:05:01.590> soft<00:05:02.210> middle<00:05:03.210> position<00:05:03.690> pickups

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:08.950 

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:25.960 

so<00:05:09.700> I<00:05:10.300> mean<00:05:11.170> it<00:05:11.260> covers<00:05:11.590> everything

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:25.970 

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:28.909 

because<00:05:26.970> this<00:05:27.659> guitar<00:05:28.050> has<00:05:28.199> a<00:05:28.259> humbucker<00:05:28.650> here

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:28.919 
because this guitar has a humbucker here

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:30.950 
because this guitar has a humbucker here
the<00:05:29.220> p90<00:05:29.729> is<00:05:29.759> a<00:05:29.879> little<00:05:30.180> bit<00:05:30.270> louder<00:05:30.539> than<00:05:30.720> a

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 
the p90 is a little bit louder than a

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.140 
the p90 is a little bit louder than a
classic<00:05:31.349> single<00:05:31.620> coil<00:05:31.800> so<00:05:32.129> the<00:05:32.729> balance

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:33.150 
classic single coil so the balance

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.240 
classic single coil so the balance
between<00:05:33.270> the<00:05:33.569> two<00:05:33.599> pickups<00:05:34.080> is<00:05:34.229> is<00:05:34.440> you<00:05:35.159> know

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:35.250 
between the two pickups is is you know

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:37.779 
between the two pickups is is you know
better<00:05:35.699> if<00:05:35.879> I<00:05:36.000> split<00:05:36.150> the<00:05:36.389> humbucker

00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:37.789 
better if I split the humbucker

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:48.890 
better if I split the humbucker
it's<00:05:38.789> very<00:05:39.210> Keith<00:05:39.659> and<00:05:39.900> very<00:05:47.270> so<00:05:48.270> it's<00:05:48.690> really
