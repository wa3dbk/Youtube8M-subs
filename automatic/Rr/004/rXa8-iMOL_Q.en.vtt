too<00:01:21.530> however<00:01:21.950> what<00:01:22.580> was<00:01:22.729> off-putting<00:01:23.270> to<00:01:23.360> me

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
too however what was off-putting to me

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.270 
too however what was off-putting to me
was<00:01:23.840> the<00:01:23.960> fact<00:01:24.170> that<00:01:24.259> the<00:01:24.470> game<00:01:24.649> mechanics<00:01:24.860> are

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
was the fact that the game mechanics are

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.820 
was the fact that the game mechanics are
simply<00:01:25.670> just<00:01:25.849> too<00:01:26.119> bland<00:01:26.450> the<00:01:27.110> game<00:01:27.319> plays<00:01:27.619> on

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:27.830 
simply just too bland the game plays on

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:29.469 
simply just too bland the game plays on
auto<00:01:28.039> play<00:01:28.310> so<00:01:28.550> that<00:01:28.729> the<00:01:28.819> cards<00:01:29.119> you<00:01:29.240> gain

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
auto play so that the cards you gain

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:31.719 
auto play so that the cards you gain
don't<00:01:29.810> really<00:01:30.110> give<00:01:30.319> a<00:01:30.470> huge<00:01:30.890> variety<00:01:31.160> in

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
don't really give a huge variety in

I guess what I was hoping for was for
something<00:01:48.920> that<00:01:49.250> required<00:01:49.640> a<00:01:49.729> bit<00:01:49.819> more

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
something that required a bit more

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.330 
something that required a bit more
strategy<00:01:50.349> everything<00:01:51.349> being<00:01:51.530> said<00:01:51.800> and<00:01:52.039> done
