00:00:11.989 --> 00:00:13.539
 also has the practice 

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:17.140
 yes not all spam today as the car from our short history 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:22.300
 especially a very important car for Mercedes as the new SC class 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.269
 goedmakertje or have some current top model 

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:29.599
 of course we will add thick versions of amg later, but for now this is the 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:30.729
 thickest sea 

00:00:30.729 --> 00:00:32.300
 the v6 gasoline 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.300
 272 hp the sea 53 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.650
 yes sorry to dream the way about the last man vs those ago 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.030
 the e 63 amg coupe 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.230
 probably in the car so I'm wondering if they also get along a bit 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.230
 camps 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:16.070
 which is for 20,000 euros in options to clean up then the car comes out at 76 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:17.410
 thousand 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:23.490
 standard this CD costs 50 56 thousand euros a lot of money but I think it is 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.610
 there a lot of money gives back a lot of luxury a lot of comfort so the descent for men 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.760
 In addition to seeing if this good chest is ahead, the preview comes from zero to one hundred 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.880
 in the six-headed four seconds with automatic 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.880
 the German champion 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.510
 anniversary 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.790
 because of the new CD you obviously don't need an imf on the lease market today 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:08.869
 is it up 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.669
 bmw 3 series audi a4 already in full 59 and the new lexus 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:18.169
 there must be between the Flemish and yes I think there are a few points for that 

00:02:18.169 --> 00:02:19.079
 speaking choir 

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:22.339
 The important thing about these sea classes is that it is the start of implementation 

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:26.879
 for that you pay 29,000 euros and a little and what do you get for all 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:27.989
 these glasses 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:32.999
 normally sit strong on top of him being big stars in I left quite yes 

00:02:32.999 --> 00:02:37.029
 and it looks really hey better invention I wonder why 

00:02:37.029 --> 00:02:39.559
 they don't just make everything second-class like that 

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:43.899
 four meters 58 have some markets and yes the aggressiveness actually holds 

00:02:43.899 --> 00:02:47.599
 just by the throat because when they see the rest of the car a reasonable one 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:52.869
 modest especially the back sides you could almost call dull but yes I think 

00:02:52.869 --> 00:02:57.180
 It also does not disturb you with these types of cars and you need the business market 

00:02:57.179 --> 00:03:00.959
 bit quiet car like and I think as a whole say you could not say no 

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:13.770
 there are, of course, 2 really muddy clichÃ©s about that in Mercedes 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.770
 and you miss action and 2 wins 

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:20.729
 yes and how about that again 

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:38.469
 day a bit silly of construction helmond mr70 is still being worked on 

00:03:38.469 --> 00:03:42.209
 This new c the interior is really completely addressed looks sleek 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:42.929
 from 

00:03:42.929 --> 00:03:46.479
 what, in my opinion, is some plastic, I see a lot of black here 

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:47.129
 plastic 

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:50.129
 what do I think they do still keep track of everything 

00:03:59.039 --> 00:04:02.119
 arseus has come up with a completely new leader system 

00:04:02.119 --> 00:04:06.769
 which of course also know from BMW Audi but this was very good though 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:11.379
 A twist of the buttons allows you to actually have navigation audio 

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:13.769
 operate a phone with Bluetooth 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:15.949
 and he must say 

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:17.449
 the three systems 

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:20.449
 I think this is actually investors 

00:04:27.349 --> 00:04:29.870
 it is exciting 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:34.479
 no of course not this is a business car and they are by definition not exciting 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:38.809
 but I do find a very nice car that C class I would go for the alv 

00:04:38.809 --> 00:04:43.360
 under 59 in this segment but that shaydie has surprised me I find a nicer one 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:47.719
 for example on the audi a4 or bmw 3 series nice and comfortable and I think so 

00:04:47.719 --> 00:04:52.279
 that people apart from the contractors naturally sorry that he is a very fine 

00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:56.400
 have a car on well these three 50 gasoline will be a very special one 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.309
 it's just too expensive for that 

00:04:58.309 --> 00:05:01.020
 most at the door just changes 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:02.990
 and is that bad 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:06.099
 I think we will see a lot of it this year on the road also the number 

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:09.460
 viewers that next time and with that, the audi r8
