00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:34.120 
ETF as opposed to buying a physical I
think<00:01:32.719> basically<00:01:32.869> it's<00:01:33.229> the<00:01:33.289> liquidity<00:01:33.679> and

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
think basically it's the liquidity and

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.639 
think basically it's the liquidity and
it's<00:01:34.549> the<00:01:34.729> value<00:01:35.119> what<00:01:35.719> i<00:01:35.749> mean<00:01:35.959> by<00:01:36.079> value<00:01:36.499> is
