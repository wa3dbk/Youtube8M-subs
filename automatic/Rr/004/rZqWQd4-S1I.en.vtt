00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
on the market because the real world

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:23.150 
on the market because the real world
performance<00:03:20.760> is<00:03:21.330> just<00:03:21.510> alright<00:03:21.830> because<00:03:22.830> I

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
performance is just alright because I

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.340 
performance is just alright because I
mean<00:03:23.310> the<00:03:23.430> software<00:03:23.850> is<00:03:23.940> holding<00:03:24.269> it<00:03:24.390> back<00:03:24.570> so

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350
