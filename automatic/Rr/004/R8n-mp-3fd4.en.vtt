00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:46.840
 if you do not keep kissing things as they are 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.629
 of wanting to give an artistic turn to 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:52.030
 all in a new look at one thing 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:56.379

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:58.899
 tradition, we always wanted to give a 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:01.809
 Turn to a new face A new 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:05.050

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:07.960
 basically how this works. 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.450
 presentation how much people 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.820

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:16.510

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:22.960
 4 capoeira and maculelê percussionists 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.509
 players in four dancers 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:29.020
 It's the different thing that we're 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:32.259
 working with an alternative 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.479
 has no traditional tabor is all 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:37.960
 part of percussion and original 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:41.770
 people are played with parental counters 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:45.280
 assets and neighborhood drums 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:47.829
 and plastic valdez and everything with him there 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.759
 inside is a very much aesthetic with 

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:51.610
 very 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:54.090
 This way it's attractive, I think it's a lot of people. 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.090
 will achieve 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:08.009
 the visual is even sensational lighting 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.289
 dance music all combine 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.810
 perfectly a great show 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:15.599
 but wait there is a different thing 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:18.989
 In this interview the editor returns a little 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:21.209
 in the interview with luciano gives a 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:24.780
 turn a new face 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:27.750
 This is because this luciano is luciano 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.730
 is not Brazilian is not Argentine who 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.260
 kind of disease is we do not have to 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.600
 likes the Brazilian culture that 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.840
 happened to countless now that happened 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:39.480
 Much thinks, it all makes sense. 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:42.450
 giving a voice to people seems more like crazy 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.790
 It started when I was a little boy, it 's mine. 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.099
 love was born in são paulo 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:50.310
 Then he went to Argentina so I already 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:53.670
 I grew up listening to Brazil and my father. 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.530
 it was completely music fund 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.170
 bossa nova samba has already created 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.150
 listening to the boys from caetano 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.340
 boy the new dry and wet Bahians 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:05.609
 all that regional music 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.739
 This is boring, it's all very annoying. 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:10.400
 natural for you with the height of 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:10.400
 environmental 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:17.250
 17 years of the seal was to know the 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:18.840
 Northeast Brazil is hard in maceió 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.400
 luciano participated in the first band 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.970
 of your career 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:26.120
 the afro block mandela a new day 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.530
 I talked to Mexico 3 about this price 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.090
 asked if I could be part of the 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:33.630
 band and he said he had to 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:35.220
 consult the Navy band that tomorrow 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.959
 will lead the band leader 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:40.380
 most I found that a lady who 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:43.650
 I bought a t-shirt for the guys today. 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:46.079
 It's a morning having a truth. 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:48.630
 I went in there, he said she said that 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:50.609
 Yes, a very beautiful thing and I got into 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:53.459
 play with them one thing listen to one 

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:55.889

00:03:55.889 --> 00:04:00.450
 another thing 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:02.970
 Are you being part of me as a guy? 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.420
 who was not born there is not an experience 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.760
 a lot can 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.380
 You had to go back to the 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.750
 Argentina and stayed a while away from 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:13.720
 music but not for long and miami 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:17.919
 he Brazilian music to rediscover the 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:22.780
 miami is the melting pot as they call it a 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:25.360
 mix of breed of top quality and 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:27.669
 where there is a very cool music too 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:30.610
 the regulator or reg 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:32.710
 I thought he also had a stadium 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:35.860
 There's someone here who invited 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:38.889
 Let's have a popular touch and it was cool. 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.540
 is already in miami and luciano started to 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:43.360
 work with percussion and music 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:44.110
 electronics but the longing for Brazil was 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.030
 great 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:47.860
 he decided to set up a samba group 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:50.860
 with a very special detail 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:53.470
 all the members were Argentine 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:55.360
 this band is one of the four Argentines and 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:57.880
 there we put the name of the band but not 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:00.669
 holy because he had a comedian 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:03.220
 argentine called olmedo open fear 

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:11.710
 What the guy was going to do with manu? 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:13.180
 holy the healer of people had until 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:17.800
 important is you will be mine 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:26.380
 assistant on the ball and he made the law 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:28.419
 There are no people who do not like Brazil. 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:30.940
 a lot of people being Argentine taking the 

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:33.760
 their work after 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:36.580
 taking a different job is that he 

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:39.280
 play samba more slowly them 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:42.090

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:42.090

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:48.300
 the band grew attracted several 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:50.280
 Brazilians and there were several 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:52.229
 memorable partnerships 

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:56.130

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:59.580

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:38.310
 It was cool, cool collaboration. I liked it. 

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:40.260
 I loved working with her and the band. 

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:43.740
 argentina came to play with some 

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:46.020
 known from Brazil not as a band I 

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:49.560
 As a musician he played with the complete black 

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:52.020
 Jehovah plant the love and respect 

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:53.670

00:06:55.650 --> 00:07:00.150
 We already have a lot of people working 

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:02.160
 With Brazilian music, this is love. 

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:04.920
 of foreigners for Brazilian music 

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:08.130
 but in fact what was surprising was 

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:11.280
 even the passion he has is not just the 

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:13.350
 issue of making Brazilian music 

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:15.150
 He loves even when we talk about 

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:18.840

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:20.850

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:23.220

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:30.810
 Brazilian tango that you dance to 

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:32.670
 tango 

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:34.830
 the music is to achieve a language 

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:35.760
 universal has no flag hand has no 

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:38.790
 flag 

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:39.690
 There is no denying that human beings have already turned 

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:42.630

00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:43.170

00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:45.300

 Look there but I ran out. 

00:07:55.180 --> 00:08:02.190
