00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
what they're learning that you didn't

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.110 
what they're learning that you didn't
have<00:02:45.360> in<00:02:45.510> high<00:02:45.660> school<00:02:45.960> in<00:02:46.170> high<00:02:46.230> school

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
have in high school in high school

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.040 
have in high school in high school
physically<00:02:48.120> they<00:02:48.240> can<00:02:48.390> either<00:02:48.510> overpower

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
physically they can either overpower

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.950 
physically they can either overpower
someone<00:02:49.680> or<00:02:50.270> they<00:02:51.270> could<00:02:51.330> just<00:02:51.510> catch<00:02:51.840> the

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:51.960 
someone or they could just catch the

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.810 
someone or they could just catch the
ball<00:02:52.170> against<00:02:52.590> the<00:02:52.710> 64<00:02:53.010> guy<00:02:53.310> and<00:02:53.520> turn<00:02:53.670> and

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
ball against the 64 guy and turn and

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.270 
ball against the 64 guy and turn and

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
jump up and dunk it and I think it's a

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.500 
jump up and dunk it and I think it's a
great<00:02:56.400> learning<00:02:56.640> experience<00:02:56.880> for<00:02:57.270> them<00:02:57.480> to

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
great learning experience for them to

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.750 
great learning experience for them to
have<00:02:57.690> to<00:02:57.840> now<00:02:58.020> go<00:02:58.290> through<00:02:58.530> the<00:02:59.370> guy<00:02:59.550> behind

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
have to now go through the guy behind

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.710 
have to now go through the guy behind
you<00:03:00.150> is<00:03:00.360> a<00:03:00.390> lot<00:03:00.630> like<00:03:00.989> you<00:03:01.200> and<00:03:01.489> so<00:03:02.720> it'll

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
you is a lot like you and so it'll

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.660 
you is a lot like you and so it'll
littell<00:03:04.080> it<00:03:04.650> will<00:03:04.770> encourage<00:03:05.040> them<00:03:05.400> to<00:03:05.430> be

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
littell it will encourage them to be

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.400 
littell it will encourage them to be
more<00:03:05.700> crafty<00:03:06.330> in<00:03:06.600> what<00:03:06.810> they're<00:03:06.930> doing<00:03:06.989> which

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
more crafty in what they're doing which

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.080 
more crafty in what they're doing which
is<00:03:07.440> I<00:03:07.800> think<00:03:08.040> that<00:03:08.430> would<00:03:08.520> be<00:03:08.640> nothing<00:03:08.820> but<00:03:09.030> a

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
is I think that would be nothing but a

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.780 
is I think that would be nothing but a
good<00:03:09.239> thing
