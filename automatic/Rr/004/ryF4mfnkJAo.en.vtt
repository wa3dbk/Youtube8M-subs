00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
here and there's a little button that's

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.320 
here and there's a little button that's
right<00:02:11.190> here<00:02:11.520> I<00:02:11.670> don't<00:02:11.760> know<00:02:11.940> if<00:02:11.970> you<00:02:12.060> can<00:02:12.180> see

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
right here I don't know if you can see

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.430 
right here I don't know if you can see
in<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:12.510> video<00:02:12.780> but<00:02:12.989> you'll<00:02:13.170> see

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
in the video but you'll see

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.190 
in the video but you'll see
on<00:02:13.650> your<00:02:13.800> car<00:02:14.010> pretty<00:02:14.280> easy<00:02:14.430> and<00:02:14.870> what<00:02:15.870> we<00:02:16.020> want

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
on your car pretty easy and what we want

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.150 
on your car pretty easy and what we want
you<00:02:16.260> want<00:02:16.380> to<00:02:16.410> do<00:02:16.530> before<00:02:16.710> you<00:02:16.890> do<00:02:16.980> anything

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
you want to do before you do anything

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.220 
you want to do before you do anything
else<00:02:17.340> is<00:02:17.640> you<00:02:17.760> want<00:02:17.940> to<00:02:18.030> hit<00:02:18.690> that<00:02:18.840> button<00:02:19.080> and

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
else is you want to hit that button and

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.010 
else is you want to hit that button and
hold<00:02:19.500> it<00:02:19.680> for<00:02:20.460> a<00:02:20.490> couple<00:02:20.580> seconds<00:02:21.090> then<00:02:21.870> you

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
hold it for a couple seconds then you

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.140 
hold it for a couple seconds then you
can<00:02:22.140> let<00:02:22.260> go<00:02:22.470> and<00:02:22.650> you<00:02:23.550> can<00:02:23.670> see<00:02:23.820> the<00:02:23.970> clock

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
can let go and you can see the clock

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.510 
can let go and you can see the clock
starting<00:02:24.600> to<00:02:24.720> change<00:02:25.050> and<00:02:25.920> it's<00:02:26.100> going<00:02:26.160> to<00:02:26.310> do

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
starting to change and it's going to do

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.760 
starting to change and it's going to do
all<00:02:26.670> sorts<00:02:26.970> of<00:02:27.030> weird<00:02:27.180> dances<00:02:27.750> but<00:02:28.500> eventually

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
all sorts of weird dances but eventually

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:34.630 
all sorts of weird dances but eventually
it's<00:02:29.130> going<00:02:29.280> to<00:02:29.340> go<00:02:29.490> over<00:02:29.580> to<00:02:29.850> 749<00:02:30.810> p.m.<00:02:33.470> so

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
it's going to go over to 749 p.m. so

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:44.420 
it's going to go over to 749 p.m. so
just<00:02:35.640> bear<00:02:35.850> with<00:02:35.880> me<00:02:36.060> here

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.580 

so<00:02:45.000> that's<00:02:45.120> really<00:02:45.269> the<00:02:45.480> trick<00:02:45.750> see<00:02:46.230> Allison

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
so that's really the trick see Allison

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.110 
so that's really the trick see Allison
how<00:02:46.739> its<00:02:46.890> back<00:02:47.040> in<00:02:47.280> different<00:02:47.730> directions

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
how its back in different directions

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.420 
how its back in different directions
your<00:02:48.480> car<00:02:48.689> probably<00:02:48.989> do<00:02:49.079> the<00:02:49.200> same<00:02:49.340> but<00:02:50.340> the

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
your car probably do the same but the

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.039 
your car probably do the same but the
trick<00:02:50.640> is<00:02:50.670> that<00:02:50.849> once<00:02:51.209> you<00:02:51.390> set<00:02:51.689> the<00:02:51.720> time

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
trick is that once you set the time

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:53.929 
trick is that once you set the time
right<00:02:52.319> while<00:02:52.650> you're<00:02:52.739> still<00:02:53.010> on<00:02:53.220> this<00:02:53.400> mode

00:02:53.929 --> 00:02:53.939 
right while you're still on this mode

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:56.449 
right while you're still on this mode
you<00:02:54.540> want<00:02:54.720> to<00:02:54.840> hit<00:02:54.959> this<00:02:55.200> button<00:02:55.560> down<00:02:56.040> here<00:02:56.310> so

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
you want to hit this button down here so

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.520 
you want to hit this button down here so
you<00:02:56.519> see<00:02:56.579> my<00:02:56.819> finger<00:02:57.120> on<00:02:57.150> the<00:02:57.239> lower<00:02:57.480> left<00:02:57.720> when

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
you see my finger on the lower left when

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.199 
you see my finger on the lower left when
I<00:02:58.560> push<00:02:58.920> that<00:02:59.099> in<00:02:59.280> and<00:02:59.310> hold<00:02:59.610> it<00:02:59.790> and<00:03:00.090> then

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
I push that in and hold it and then

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:01.819 
I push that in and hold it and then
you'll<00:03:00.360> start<00:03:00.720> seeing<00:03:00.959> once<00:03:01.500> the<00:03:01.620> clock

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:01.829 
you'll start seeing once the clock

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:03.770 
you'll start seeing once the clock
starts<00:03:02.129> moving<00:03:02.459> hold<00:03:02.879> it<00:03:03.090> for<00:03:03.209> another<00:03:03.420> second

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
starts moving hold it for another second

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.720 
starts moving hold it for another second
or<00:03:03.840> two<00:03:03.900> and<00:03:04.290> then<00:03:04.739> you<00:03:04.829> can<00:03:04.950> let<00:03:05.069> go<00:03:05.280> and<00:03:05.549> then

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
or two and then you can let go and then

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.059 
or two and then you can let go and then
it<00:03:05.939> will<00:03:06.060> continue<00:03:06.840> going<00:03:07.349> until<00:03:07.500> it<00:03:07.739> gets<00:03:07.890> to

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 
it will continue going until it gets to

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:11.089 
it will continue going until it gets to
the<00:03:08.189> date<00:03:08.400> heard<00:03:08.730> the<00:03:08.909> time<00:03:09.120> that<00:03:09.359> you<00:03:09.420> set<00:03:10.099> so

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:11.099 
the date heard the time that you set so

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:22.500 
the date heard the time that you set so
here<00:03:11.310> it<00:03:11.400> is<00:03:11.519> coming<00:03:12.000> up<00:03:12.150> on<00:03:12.269> seven<00:03:12.629> forty-nine

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
top arrow again one more time that moved

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.970 
top arrow again one more time that moved
it<00:03:39.819> over<00:03:39.909> to<00:03:40.150> the<00:03:40.239> minutes<00:03:40.540> that's<00:03:40.959> fine<00:03:41.290> so
