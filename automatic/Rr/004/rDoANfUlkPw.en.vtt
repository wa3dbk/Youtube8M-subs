doubt<00:00:21.359> if<00:00:21.600> you<00:00:21.720> played<00:00:21.960> both<00:00:22.230> of<00:00:22.260> these<00:00:22.529> games

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
doubt if you played both of these games

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.800 
doubt if you played both of these games
you'd<00:00:23.100> realize<00:00:23.430> by<00:00:23.640> now<00:00:23.670> that<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:24.210> DMR's

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
you'd realize by now that the DMR's

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.630 
you'd realize by now that the DMR's
aren't<00:00:25.080> quite<00:00:25.350> as<00:00:25.470> good<00:00:25.619> as<00:00:25.830> they<00:00:26.070> used<00:00:26.340> to<00:00:26.460> be

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
aren't quite as good as they used to be

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.640 
aren't quite as good as they used to be
if<00:00:26.910> you<00:00:27.359> haven't<00:00:27.689> played<00:00:27.869> bf3<00:00:28.199> though<00:00:28.590> you

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
if you haven't played bf3 though you

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.560 
if you haven't played bf3 though you
probably<00:00:28.920> don't<00:00:29.400> know<00:00:29.550> why<00:00:29.730> so<00:00:30.029> many<00:00:30.210> people

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
probably don't know why so many people

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.650 
probably don't know why so many people
are<00:00:30.689> so<00:00:30.869> upset<00:00:31.050> about<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.769> DMR's<00:00:32.219> in<00:00:32.489> bf4<00:00:33.030> so<00:00:33.630> I

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
are so upset about the DMR's in bf4 so I

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.450 
are so upset about the DMR's in bf4 so I
hope<00:00:33.870> in<00:00:34.020> this<00:00:34.140> video<00:00:34.410> I<00:00:34.500> can<00:00:34.860> explain<00:00:35.190> why

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
hope in this video I can explain why

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.880 
hope in this video I can explain why
there's<00:00:36.360> actually<00:00:36.750> a<00:00:36.780> number<00:00:37.079> of<00:00:37.260> reasons<00:00:37.559> why

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
there's actually a number of reasons why

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.530 
there's actually a number of reasons why
this<00:00:37.950> is<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.399> case<00:00:38.610> and<00:00:38.879> there's<00:00:39.149> arguments

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
this is the case and there's arguments

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.569 
this is the case and there's arguments
either<00:00:39.840> way<00:00:40.230> as<00:00:40.500> to<00:00:40.739> whether<00:00:40.890> changing<00:00:41.430> them

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
either way as to whether changing them

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.160 
either way as to whether changing them
was<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:41.760> good<00:00:42.000> thing<00:00:42.149> or<00:00:42.390> a<00:00:42.450> bad<00:00:42.540> thing

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
was a good thing or a bad thing

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.869 
was a good thing or a bad thing

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
clearly in battlefield 3 the demos were

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.880 
clearly in battlefield 3 the demos were
designed<00:01:39.299> to<00:01:39.390> be<00:01:39.479> sniper<00:01:39.900> rifles<00:01:40.290> as<00:01:40.470> well<00:01:40.710> as

designed to be sniper rifles as well as
their<00:01:41.040> Mars<00:01:41.310> because<00:01:41.729> unlike<00:01:42.090> in<00:01:42.360> bf4<00:01:42.869> they

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
their Mars because unlike in bf4 they

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.109 
their Mars because unlike in bf4 they

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
of a rifle scope doesn't necessarily

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.010 
of a rifle scope doesn't necessarily
determine<00:01:50.460> its<00:01:50.579> role<00:01:50.820> but<00:01:51.420> it's<00:01:51.659> safe<00:01:51.840> to<00:01:51.990> say

that<00:01:52.380> as<00:01:52.560> these<00:01:52.799> rifles<00:01:53.250> were<00:01:53.280> given

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
that as these rifles were given

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.340 
that as these rifles were given
exclusively<00:01:54.180> to<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.570> stealthiest<00:01:54.990> class

exclusively to the stealthiest class

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.410 
exclusively to the stealthiest class
they<00:01:55.890> were<00:01:55.950> definitely<00:01:56.520> intended<00:01:56.939> to<00:01:57.090> be<00:01:57.180> used

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
they were definitely intended to be used

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.139 
they were definitely intended to be used
this<00:01:57.600> way<00:01:57.869> they<00:01:58.710> were<00:01:58.890> in<00:01:59.159> fact<00:01:59.340> pretty<00:01:59.700> useful

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
this way they were in fact pretty useful

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.120 
this way they were in fact pretty useful
as<00:02:00.329> long-range<00:02:00.780> sniper<00:02:01.200> rifles<00:02:01.590> because<00:02:01.950> they

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
as long-range sniper rifles because they

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.649 
as long-range sniper rifles because they
were<00:02:02.189> far<00:02:02.460> more<00:02:02.490> accurate<00:02:02.880> and<00:02:03.270> had<00:02:03.450> a<00:02:03.479> lot

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
were far more accurate and had a lot

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.749 
were far more accurate and had a lot
less<00:02:03.689> recoil<00:02:04.130> also<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.310> fact<00:02:05.520> that<00:02:05.610> the

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
less recoil also the fact that the

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.429 
less recoil also the fact that the
defensive<00:02:06.240> perk<00:02:06.420> didn't<00:02:06.719> exist<00:02:07.020> meant<00:02:07.290> that

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
defensive perk didn't exist meant that

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.080 
defensive perk didn't exist meant that
assuming<00:02:07.829> you<00:02:07.950> could<00:02:08.069> land<00:02:08.250> chest<00:02:08.550> shots<00:02:08.789> they

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
assuming you could land chest shots they

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.240 
assuming you could land chest shots they
actually<00:02:09.450> did<00:02:09.629> more<00:02:09.780> damage<00:02:10.200> and<00:02:10.379> speaking<00:02:11.160> of

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
actually did more damage and speaking of

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.990 
damage all the DMR's except for
SKS<00:02:13.510> dealt<00:02:14.049> 50<00:02:14.440> damage<00:02:14.620> out<00:02:14.950> to<00:02:15.190> 15<00:02:15.580> meters

SKS dealt 50 damage out to 15 meters

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.059 
SKS dealt 50 damage out to 15 meters
which<00:02:16.480> made<00:02:16.720> them<00:02:16.900> a<00:02:16.989> two-shot<00:02:17.379> kill<00:02:17.620> at<00:02:17.830> close

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:18.069 
which made them a two-shot kill at close

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:19.860 
which made them a two-shot kill at close
range<00:02:18.370> or<00:02:18.610> a<00:02:18.640> one-shot<00:02:19.150> kill<00:02:19.180> if<00:02:19.569> he<00:02:19.690> could

range or a one-shot kill if he could

range or a one-shot kill if he could
land<00:02:20.049> a<00:02:20.170> headshot<00:02:20.560> this<00:02:21.159> is<00:02:21.310> considerably

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 
land a headshot this is considerably

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:23.220 
land a headshot this is considerably
better<00:02:22.030> than<00:02:22.180> the<00:02:22.390> three<00:02:22.629> shots<00:02:22.930> that<00:02:23.140> you

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
better than the three shots that you

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:24.869 
better than the three shots that you
need<00:02:23.409> to<00:02:23.560> kill<00:02:23.709> a<00:02:23.739> target<00:02:23.980> at<00:02:24.370> all<00:02:24.610> ranges

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:24.879 
need to kill a target at all ranges

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:26.610 
need to kill a target at all ranges
within<00:02:25.269> battlefield<00:02:26.049> 4

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
within battlefield 4

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.130 
within battlefield 4
like<00:02:27.220> I<00:02:27.370> said<00:02:27.430> before<00:02:27.610> the<00:02:28.120> accuracy<00:02:28.750> and<00:02:28.959> the

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
like I said before the accuracy and the

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.869 
like I said before the accuracy and the
recoil<00:02:29.500> of<00:02:29.709> these<00:02:29.829> weapons<00:02:30.040> was<00:02:30.400> a<00:02:30.430> lot<00:02:30.640> better

00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:30.879 
recoil of these weapons was a lot better

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:33.210 
recoil of these weapons was a lot better
too<00:02:31.150> I<00:02:31.420> mean<00:02:31.900> trying<00:02:32.200> to<00:02:32.349> compare<00:02:32.680> stats<00:02:32.890> from

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
too I mean trying to compare stats from

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.430 
too I mean trying to compare stats from
one<00:02:33.400> game<00:02:33.610> to<00:02:33.640> another<00:02:33.909> is<00:02:34.269> kind<00:02:34.569> of<00:02:34.720> hard<00:02:34.959> but

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
one game to another is kind of hard but

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.319 
one game to another is kind of hard but
in<00:02:35.590> bf3<00:02:35.860> I<00:02:36.129> can<00:02:36.489> tell<00:02:36.670> you<00:02:36.790> that<00:02:36.940> a<00:02:37.000> weapon<00:02:37.150> like

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:37.329 
in bf3 I can tell you that a weapon like

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:40.680 
in bf3 I can tell you that a weapon like
the<00:02:37.599> M<00:02:37.780> 39<00:02:38.379> is<00:02:38.620> in<00:02:39.220> contrast<00:02:39.640> to<00:02:39.790> be<00:02:39.970> a<00:02:40.000> for<00:02:40.360> both

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
the M 39 is in contrast to be a for both

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.009 
the M 39 is in contrast to be a for both
accurate<00:02:41.290> and<00:02:41.319> easy<00:02:41.860> to<00:02:42.069> control<00:02:42.340> also<00:02:43.150> in<00:02:43.690> bf3

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:44.019 
accurate and easy to control also in bf3

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:46.020 
accurate and easy to control also in bf3
the<00:02:44.470> spread<00:02:44.709> increase<00:02:44.980> per<00:02:45.010> shot<00:02:45.370> as<00:02:45.579> far<00:02:45.819> as<00:02:45.940> I

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
the spread increase per shot as far as I

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.640 
the spread increase per shot as far as I
can<00:02:46.150> tell<00:02:46.390> wasn't<00:02:46.810> really<00:02:47.049> that<00:02:47.200> much<00:02:47.260> of<00:02:47.560> an

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
can tell wasn't really that much of an

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.460 
can tell wasn't really that much of an
issue<00:02:47.829> which<00:02:48.519> in<00:02:48.700> bf4<00:02:49.180> really<00:02:49.720> nerves<00:02:49.930> DMR's

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
issue which in bf4 really nerves DMR's

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.069 
issue which in bf4 really nerves DMR's
and<00:02:50.620> especially<00:02:51.069> nerves<00:02:51.519> the<00:02:51.760> SR<00:02:52.150> 33<00:02:52.660> 8<00:02:52.780> sniper

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:53.079 
and especially nerves the SR 33 8 sniper

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:55.589 
and especially nerves the SR 33 8 sniper
rifle<00:02:53.620> all<00:02:54.160> of<00:02:54.459> this<00:02:54.609> combined<00:02:55.090> meant<00:02:55.420> that

00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:55.599 
rifle all of this combined meant that

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:57.210 
rifle all of this combined meant that
you<00:02:55.690> could<00:02:55.840> literally<00:02:56.140> spam<00:02:56.530> your<00:02:56.739> weapon<00:02:57.010> at

you could literally spam your weapon at

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.280 
you could literally spam your weapon at
full<00:02:57.489> rpm<00:02:58.000> and<00:02:58.239> destroy<00:02:58.599> your<00:02:58.780> target<00:02:59.140> with

just<00:03:12.220> impossible<00:03:12.489> with<00:03:13.060> a<00:03:13.090> DMR<00:03:13.599> in<00:03:13.840> bf4

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
just impossible with a DMR in bf4

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.530 
just impossible with a DMR in bf4
because<00:03:15.099> in<00:03:15.340> this<00:03:15.549> game<00:03:15.819> they're<00:03:16.150> designed<00:03:16.450> to

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
because in this game they're designed to

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.390 
because in this game they're designed to
be<00:03:16.690> only<00:03:16.930> effective<00:03:17.530> at<00:03:17.709> mid<00:03:18.010> to<00:03:18.190> long<00:03:18.370> range

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
be only effective at mid to long range

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.580 
be only effective at mid to long range
which<00:03:19.060> is<00:03:19.090> actually<00:03:19.630> kind<00:03:19.870> of<00:03:19.959> authentic<00:03:20.470> to

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
which is actually kind of authentic to

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:21.449 
which is actually kind of authentic to
the<00:03:20.709> real<00:03:20.889> world

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
the real world

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:24.240 
the real world
also<00:03:22.239> in<00:03:22.510> bf4<00:03:22.840> the<00:03:23.319> assault<00:03:23.620> rifles<00:03:24.069> and

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
also in bf4 the assault rifles and

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.220 
also in bf4 the assault rifles and
carbines<00:03:24.790> are<00:03:25.060> just<00:03:25.299> so<00:03:25.480> much<00:03:25.690> better<00:03:25.930> at

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
carbines are just so much better at

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.619 
carbines are just so much better at
mid-range<00:03:26.530> and<00:03:27.130> out<00:03:27.609> shooting<00:03:28.000> someone<00:03:28.329> using

00:03:28.619 --> 00:03:28.629 
mid-range and out shooting someone using

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:30.360 
mid-range and out shooting someone using
one<00:03:28.750> of<00:03:28.780> these<00:03:28.989> weapons<00:03:29.200> where<00:03:29.530> the<00:03:29.620> DMR<00:03:30.040> is

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
one of these weapons where the DMR is

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.220 
one of these weapons where the DMR is
pretty<00:03:30.760> difficult<00:03:31.000> to<00:03:31.359> say<00:03:31.540> the<00:03:31.720> least<00:03:31.900> I've

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
pretty difficult to say the least I've

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.830 
pretty difficult to say the least I've
got<00:03:32.310> to<00:03:33.310> admit<00:03:33.549> though<00:03:33.760> that<00:03:33.790> the<00:03:34.120> DMR's<00:03:34.540> did

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
got to admit though that the DMR's did

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.659 
got to admit though that the DMR's did
get<00:03:34.989> a<00:03:35.019> few<00:03:35.230> improvements<00:03:35.560> in<00:03:35.980> the<00:03:36.099> transition

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:36.669 
get a few improvements in the transition

00:03:36.669 --> 00:03:38.490 
get a few improvements in the transition
to<00:03:36.700> beer<00:03:36.940> for<00:03:37.269> although<00:03:37.750> they<00:03:38.109> don't<00:03:38.230> really

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
to beer for although they don't really

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.250 
to beer for although they don't really
stack<00:03:38.829> up<00:03:39.010> so<00:03:39.190> well<00:03:39.400> against<00:03:39.879> the<00:03:39.970> nerves

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
stack up so well against the nerves

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.689 
stack up so well against the nerves
weapons<00:03:41.260> in<00:03:41.500> general<00:03:41.859> have<00:03:42.069> quite<00:03:42.280> a<00:03:42.310> few<00:03:42.579> more

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:42.699 
weapons in general have quite a few more

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:44.759 
weapons in general have quite a few more
attachments<00:03:43.269> in<00:03:43.419> bf4<00:03:43.930> which<00:03:44.230> allows<00:03:44.500> you<00:03:44.650> to

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:44.769 
attachments in bf4 which allows you to

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:47.909 
attachments in bf4 which allows you to
customize<00:03:45.250> your<00:03:45.280> DMR<00:03:45.849> a<00:03:45.879> bit<00:03:46.120> more<00:03:46.329> in<00:03:46.629> bf3<00:03:47.349> you

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:47.919 
customize your DMR a bit more in bf3 you

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:49.559 
customize your DMR a bit more in bf3 you
did<00:03:48.160> actually<00:03:48.400> have<00:03:48.790> access<00:03:49.060> to<00:03:49.329> the

00:03:49.559 --> 00:03:49.569 
did actually have access to the

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:51.629 
did actually have access to the
high-powered<00:03:50.079> scopes<00:03:50.349> on<00:03:50.560> all<00:03:50.889> the<00:03:51.069> DMR's<00:03:51.489> and

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:51.639 
high-powered scopes on all the DMR's and

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:53.490 
high-powered scopes on all the DMR's and
the<00:03:51.970> hollow<00:03:52.180> sights<00:03:52.540> actually<00:03:53.109> gave<00:03:53.290> you<00:03:53.470> a

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
the hollow sights actually gave you a

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.280 
the hollow sights actually gave you a
1.5<00:03:54.220> times<00:03:54.579> zoom<00:03:54.819> but<00:03:55.449> apart<00:03:55.720> from<00:03:55.900> this<00:03:56.049> the

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
1.5 times zoom but apart from this the

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.110 
1.5 times zoom but apart from this the
only<00:03:56.650> really<00:03:56.980> effective<00:03:57.099> attachments<00:03:57.970> on<00:03:58.090> the

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
only really effective attachments on the

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.479 
only really effective attachments on the
DMR's<00:03:58.690> were<00:03:58.989> the<00:03:59.049> bipod<00:03:59.530> and<00:03:59.680> the<00:03:59.919> laser<00:04:00.129> sight

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489 
DMR's were the bipod and the laser sight

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:03.420 
DMR's were the bipod and the laser sight
also<00:04:01.150> suppression<00:04:02.079> in<00:04:02.290> bf3<00:04:02.560> was<00:04:02.980> a<00:04:03.010> lot<00:04:03.220> bigger

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
also suppression in bf3 was a lot bigger

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:06.119 
also suppression in bf3 was a lot bigger
issue<00:04:03.699> than<00:04:04.060> it<00:04:04.120> is<00:04:04.389> in<00:04:04.660> bf4<00:04:05.169> however<00:04:05.919> you

00:04:06.119 --> 00:04:06.129 
issue than it is in bf4 however you

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:07.830 
issue than it is in bf4 however you
could<00:04:06.310> run<00:04:06.579> with<00:04:06.760> the<00:04:06.849> squad<00:04:07.090> cover<00:04:07.329> perk<00:04:07.599> to

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
could run with the squad cover perk to

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.050 
could run with the squad cover perk to
try<00:04:08.049> and<00:04:08.199> offset<00:04:08.560> this<00:04:08.769> on<00:04:09.129> the<00:04:09.609> other<00:04:09.730> hand

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
try and offset this on the other hand

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:11.789 
try and offset this on the other hand
it's<00:04:10.359> easy<00:04:10.660> to<00:04:10.840> forget<00:04:10.989> sometimes<00:04:11.410> that

00:04:11.789 --> 00:04:11.799 
it's easy to forget sometimes that

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:13.949 
it's easy to forget sometimes that
suppression<00:04:12.459> is<00:04:12.639> also<00:04:13.090> a<00:04:13.120> hindrance<00:04:13.480> to<00:04:13.810> your

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:13.959 
suppression is also a hindrance to your

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:16.680 
suppression is also a hindrance to your
enemy<00:04:14.260> and<00:04:14.440> in<00:04:14.829> bf3<00:04:15.099> the<00:04:15.519> large<00:04:15.730> DMR<00:04:16.299> rounds

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
enemy and in bf3 the large DMR rounds

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.569 
enemy and in bf3 the large DMR rounds
actually<00:04:16.900> created<00:04:17.590> a<00:04:17.709> greater<00:04:18.039> suppression

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:18.579 
actually created a greater suppression

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:21.539 
actually created a greater suppression
effect<00:04:18.880> on<00:04:19.030> your<00:04:19.269> target<00:04:19.720> in<00:04:19.900> bf4<00:04:20.829> I<00:04:21.070> find<00:04:21.400> no

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:21.549 
effect on your target in bf4 I find no

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:23.130 
effect on your target in bf4 I find no
matter<00:04:21.760> how<00:04:22.030> much<00:04:22.210> you're<00:04:22.450> spamming<00:04:22.690> at<00:04:23.020> an

matter how much you're spamming at an

matter how much you're spamming at an
enemy<00:04:23.289> if<00:04:23.620> they're<00:04:24.010> running<00:04:24.219> an<00:04:24.520> order

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
enemy if they're running an order

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.610 
enemy if they're running an order
weapon<00:04:25.360> they're<00:04:25.570> almost<00:04:25.810> always<00:04:26.260> going<00:04:26.560> to

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
weapon they're almost always going to

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.280 
weapon they're almost always going to
take<00:04:26.770> you<00:04:26.950> out<00:04:26.980> in<00:04:27.820> bf3<00:04:28.240> you<00:04:28.660> actually<00:04:29.020> had<00:04:29.170> the

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:29.290 
take you out in bf3 you actually had the

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:30.960 
take you out in bf3 you actually had the
chance<00:04:29.320> of<00:04:29.740> suppressing<00:04:30.280> your<00:04:30.310> enemy<00:04:30.700> to<00:04:30.850> the

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
chance of suppressing your enemy to the

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:32.790 
chance of suppressing your enemy to the
point<00:04:31.210> of<00:04:31.330> missing<00:04:31.720> shots<00:04:31.900> and<00:04:32.230> this<00:04:32.620> gave

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 
point of missing shots and this gave

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.650 
point of missing shots and this gave
large<00:04:33.070> caliber<00:04:33.490> weapons<00:04:33.850> an<00:04:34.000> edge<00:04:34.270> that<00:04:34.540> they

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
large caliber weapons an edge that they

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:37.680 
large caliber weapons an edge that they
just<00:04:34.840> don't<00:04:35.020> have<00:04:35.170> in<00:04:35.620> bf4<00:04:36.150> the<00:04:37.150> last<00:04:37.390> thing

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
just don't have in bf4 the last thing

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:39.270 
just don't have in bf4 the last thing
that<00:04:37.720> I<00:04:37.870> think<00:04:37.960> that<00:04:38.260> you<00:04:38.380> can<00:04:38.530> argue<00:04:38.950> is<00:04:39.160> an

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 
that I think that you can argue is an

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.180 
that I think that you can argue is an
improvement<00:04:39.580> to<00:04:39.820> DMR's<00:04:40.300> in<00:04:40.630> bf4<00:04:40.990> is<00:04:41.440> a<00:04:41.680> larger

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:42.190 
improvement to DMR's in bf4 is a larger

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.910 
improvement to DMR's in bf4 is a larger
capacity<00:04:42.540> weapons<00:04:43.540> like<00:04:43.750> the<00:04:43.900> mark<00:04:44.110> 11<00:04:44.500> and<00:04:44.710> M

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:44.920 
capacity weapons like the mark 11 and M

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.520 
capacity weapons like the mark 11 and M

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:04.330 
haven't really spoken about battlefield

hardline or future battlefield games so

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.730 
hardline or future battlefield games so
the<00:05:06.880> question<00:05:07.210> is<00:05:07.390> how<00:05:07.870> do<00:05:07.930> you<00:05:08.080> think<00:05:08.320> DMR

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:08.740 
the question is how do you think DMR

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.290 
the question is how do you think DMR
should<00:05:09.010> be<00:05:09.130> changed<00:05:09.610> in<00:05:09.820> the<00:05:09.940> upcoming

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:10.300 
should be changed in the upcoming

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.480 
should be changed in the upcoming
battlefield<00:05:10.900> titles<00:05:11.320> well<00:05:12.040> I<00:05:12.070> can<00:05:12.280> tell<00:05:12.430> you

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:12.490 
battlefield titles well I can tell you

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:14.310 
battlefield titles well I can tell you
that<00:05:12.760> without<00:05:12.880> a<00:05:13.060> doubt<00:05:13.330> in<00:05:13.600> hardline<00:05:14.050> they're

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:14.320 
that without a doubt in hardline they're

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:15.990 
that without a doubt in hardline they're
transitioning<00:05:15.010> back<00:05:15.160> to<00:05:15.220> the<00:05:15.400> B<00:05:15.610> of<00:05:15.640> three

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.000 
transitioning back to the B of three

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.090 
transitioning back to the B of three
DMR's<00:05:16.480> because<00:05:17.110> not<00:05:17.260> only<00:05:17.290> are<00:05:17.800> they<00:05:17.920> now

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:18.100 
DMR's because not only are they now

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.070 
DMR's because not only are they now
classed<00:05:18.460> specific<00:05:18.970> again<00:05:19.300> they're<00:05:19.720> able<00:05:19.930> to

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.080 
classed specific again they're able to

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.050 
classed specific again they're able to

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:24.580 
damn good chance in close quarters I was

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.100 
damn good chance in close quarters I was
able<00:05:24.760> to<00:05:24.910> go<00:05:25.120> on<00:05:25.150> some<00:05:25.390> pretty<00:05:25.540> decent<00:05:25.750> kill

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.110 
able to go on some pretty decent kill

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:28.030 
streaks during the hardline beta using

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:30.150 
streaks during the hardline beta using
the<00:05:28.180> Saiga<00:05:28.420> 308<00:05:29.020> and<00:05:29.290> I've<00:05:29.560> had<00:05:29.680> a<00:05:29.710> lot<00:05:29.890> of<00:05:29.920> fun

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:30.160 
the Saiga 308 and I've had a lot of fun

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.430 
the Saiga 308 and I've had a lot of fun
with<00:05:30.340> this<00:05:30.490> because<00:05:31.150> hardline<00:05:31.870> is<00:05:32.110> a<00:05:32.140> more

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:32.440 
with this because hardline is a more

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:34.290 
with this because hardline is a more
arcade<00:05:32.920> style<00:05:33.220> shooter<00:05:33.670> I<00:05:33.790> think<00:05:34.030> this<00:05:34.150> is

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:34.300 
arcade style shooter I think this is

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.480 
arcade style shooter I think this is
kind<00:05:34.510> of<00:05:34.600> acceptable<00:05:35.050> but<00:05:35.650> I<00:05:35.860> think<00:05:36.100> if<00:05:36.220> things

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:36.490 
kind of acceptable but I think if things

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:38.400 
kind of acceptable but I think if things
went<00:05:36.670> back<00:05:36.880> to<00:05:37.030> the<00:05:37.150> situation<00:05:37.720> where<00:05:37.900> DMR's

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:38.410 
went back to the situation where DMR's

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:40.530 
went back to the situation where DMR's
were<00:05:38.650> being<00:05:38.920> banned<00:05:39.220> from<00:05:39.370> TDM<00:05:39.940> servers<00:05:40.390> in

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:40.540 
were being banned from TDM servers in

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:42.270 
were being banned from TDM servers in
the<00:05:40.720> actual<00:05:41.110> numbered<00:05:41.560> battlefield<00:05:42.040> games

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:42.280 
the actual numbered battlefield games

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:43.890 
the actual numbered battlefield games
then<00:05:42.790> this<00:05:42.970> wouldn't<00:05:43.300> be<00:05:43.390> a<00:05:43.420> good<00:05:43.600> thing

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:43.900 
then this wouldn't be a good thing

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:45.900 
then this wouldn't be a good thing
I<00:05:44.170> think<00:05:44.710> weapons<00:05:45.040> in<00:05:45.220> battlefield<00:05:45.520> games

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:45.910 
I think weapons in battlefield games

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:47.730 
I think weapons in battlefield games
have<00:05:46.180> to<00:05:46.270> be<00:05:46.390> realistic<00:05:46.720> to<00:05:47.080> their<00:05:47.200> roles<00:05:47.440> in

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:47.740 
have to be realistic to their roles in

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:49.650 
have to be realistic to their roles in
the<00:05:47.860> real<00:05:48.040> world<00:05:48.340> and<00:05:48.640> it's<00:05:49.000> obvious<00:05:49.330> that<00:05:49.360> in

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:49.660 
the real world and it's obvious that in

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:51.330 
the real world and it's obvious that in
bf4<00:05:49.930> dice<00:05:50.440> have<00:05:50.680> taken<00:05:50.980> this<00:05:51.070> into

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:51.340 
bf4 dice have taken this into

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:53.760 
bf4 dice have taken this into
consideration<00:05:51.810> the<00:05:52.810> problem<00:05:53.170> is<00:05:53.320> is<00:05:53.590> the

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:53.770 
consideration the problem is is the

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:55.620 
consideration the problem is is the
DMR's<00:05:54.280> have<00:05:54.490> become<00:05:54.790> not<00:05:54.970> very<00:05:55.240> fun<00:05:55.450> to<00:05:55.600> use

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:55.630 
DMR's have become not very fun to use

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:57.780 
DMR's have become not very fun to use
for<00:05:56.080> the<00:05:56.140> average<00:05:56.320> player<00:05:56.770> so<00:05:57.280> I<00:05:57.310> think<00:05:57.430> dice

00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:57.790 
for the average player so I think dice

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:59.550 
for the average player so I think dice
need<00:05:58.090> to<00:05:58.210> find<00:05:58.420> a<00:05:58.480> middle<00:05:58.720> ground<00:05:58.750> in<00:05:59.200> future

00:05:59.550 --> 00:05:59.560 
need to find a middle ground in future

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:02.400 
need to find a middle ground in future
games<00:05:59.830> I<00:06:00.270> personally<00:06:01.270> like<00:06:01.480> using<00:06:01.870> the<00:06:01.960> DMR's

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:02.410 
games I personally like using the DMR's

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:04.110 
games I personally like using the DMR's
but<00:06:02.680> for<00:06:02.890> an<00:06:02.980> all<00:06:03.160> kit<00:06:03.400> weapon<00:06:03.850> they're<00:06:03.970> not

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:04.120 
but for an all kit weapon they're not

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:06.630 
but for an all kit weapon they're not
exactly<00:06:04.540> that<00:06:04.720> useful<00:06:05.200> on<00:06:05.410> every<00:06:05.830> map<00:06:06.010> and<00:06:06.280> you

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:06.640 
exactly that useful on every map and you

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:08.070 
exactly that useful on every map and you
really<00:06:06.880> have<00:06:07.030> to<00:06:07.150> put<00:06:07.300> in<00:06:07.390> a<00:06:07.480> lot<00:06:07.630> of<00:06:07.660> time<00:06:07.900> and

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:08.080 
really have to put in a lot of time and

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.690 
really have to put in a lot of time and
effort<00:06:08.290> to<00:06:08.410> learn<00:06:08.530> how<00:06:08.770> to<00:06:08.800> use<00:06:09.010> them<00:06:09.220> well<00:06:09.430> I

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:09.700 
effort to learn how to use them well I

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:11.280 
effort to learn how to use them well I
think<00:06:10.450> high<00:06:10.660> recoil

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:11.290 
think high recoil

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:13.560 
think high recoil
low<00:06:11.470> rpm<00:06:12.010> low<00:06:12.250> capacity<00:06:12.850> and<00:06:13.060> a<00:06:13.120> high<00:06:13.270> spread

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:13.570 
low rpm low capacity and a high spread

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:15.450 
low rpm low capacity and a high spread
increase<00:06:13.930> is<00:06:14.140> accurate<00:06:14.770> to<00:06:14.920> the<00:06:14.950> real<00:06:15.070> world

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:15.460 
increase is accurate to the real world

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:17.520 
increase is accurate to the real world
so<00:06:15.820> I<00:06:16.120> wouldn't<00:06:16.420> change<00:06:16.600> this<00:06:16.900> but<00:06:17.230> higher

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:17.530 
so I wouldn't change this but higher

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:19.890 
so I wouldn't change this but higher
damage<00:06:18.010> better<00:06:18.430> accuracy<00:06:18.820> and<00:06:19.120> high-powered

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:19.900 
damage better accuracy and high-powered

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:21.600 
damage better accuracy and high-powered
optics<00:06:20.230> are<00:06:20.410> also<00:06:20.710> accurate<00:06:21.370> to<00:06:21.490> the<00:06:21.520> real

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:21.610 
optics are also accurate to the real

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:23.840 
optics are also accurate to the real
worlds<00:06:22.150> so<00:06:22.480> I<00:06:22.510> probably<00:06:22.780> changed<00:06:23.380> this<00:06:23.560> back

also<00:06:24.850> I'd<00:06:25.120> most<00:06:25.330> definitely<00:06:25.900> make<00:06:26.110> DMR's<00:06:26.560> with

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:26.830 
also I'd most definitely make DMR's with

the Recon class again because there

the Recon class again because there
shouldn't<00:06:30.640> be<00:06:30.790> any<00:06:31.060> other<00:06:31.240> class<00:06:31.540> that<00:06:31.570> can

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:31.930 
shouldn't be any other class that can

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:33.390 
shouldn't be any other class that can
come<00:06:32.140> close<00:06:32.380> to<00:06:32.410> matching<00:06:32.740> the<00:06:32.950> recons
