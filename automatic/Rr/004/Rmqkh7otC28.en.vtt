Fender in a 2v2 situation in this video
we're<00:00:20.540> gonna<00:00:20.599> concentrate<00:00:20.960> on<00:00:21.140> the

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:21.200 
we're gonna concentrate on the

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.630 
we're gonna concentrate on the
principles<00:00:21.619> of<00:00:21.740> the<00:00:21.800> role<00:00:21.920> a<00:00:21.950> second<00:00:22.310> defender

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:22.640 
principles of the role a second defender

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.210 
principles of the role a second defender
and<00:00:22.760> a<00:00:23.000> 3v2<00:00:23.450> situation<00:00:24.230> let's<00:00:24.860> see<00:00:24.980> how<00:00:25.070> it

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:25.220 
and a 3v2 situation let's see how it

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.960 
and a 3v2 situation let's see how it
works<00:00:26.950> now<00:00:27.950> we'll<00:00:28.130> see<00:00:28.279> the<00:00:28.369> second<00:00:28.640> defender

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:28.970 
works now we'll see the second defender

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.210 
works now we'll see the second defender
in<00:00:29.060> a<00:00:29.090> 3v2<00:00:29.449> situation<00:00:30.320> here<00:00:30.800> the<00:00:30.980> second

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:31.220 
in a 3v2 situation here the second

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:32.470 
in a 3v2 situation here the second
defender<00:00:31.520> may<00:00:31.670> have<00:00:31.820> to<00:00:31.910> play<00:00:32.059> a<00:00:32.090> little<00:00:32.239> bit

defender may have to play a little bit

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.780 
defender may have to play a little bit
deeper<00:00:32.840> in<00:00:32.930> order<00:00:33.110> to<00:00:33.199> cut<00:00:33.350> passing<00:00:33.800> lanes<00:00:34.010> in

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:34.790 
deeper in order to cut passing lanes in

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:36.310 
deeper in order to cut passing lanes in
the<00:00:34.910> first<00:00:35.120> scenario<00:00:35.330> we'll<00:00:35.960> have<00:00:36.110> this

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.320 
the first scenario we'll have this

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.890 
the first scenario we'll have this
center<00:00:37.040> attacker<00:00:37.340> play<00:00:37.699> it<00:00:37.820> out<00:00:37.940> wide<00:00:38.180> the

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:40.580 
first defender will then step to provide

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.520 
first defender will then step to provide
pressure<00:00:40.850> and<00:00:41.210> the<00:00:41.449> second<00:00:41.840> defender<00:00:42.260> is

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:42.530 
pressure and the second defender is

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.680

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.490 
in a situation to help out the first
defender<00:00:46.640> now<00:00:47.360> as<00:00:47.600> the<00:00:47.719> ball<00:00:47.870> is<00:00:47.989> rotated

change the point of attack the second
defender<00:00:50.809> has<00:00:50.989> to<00:00:51.170> rotate<00:00:51.590> and<00:00:51.800> become<00:00:52.340> the

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
defender has to rotate and become the

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.250

00:00:58.959 --> 00:00:58.969 
and the first defender then has to drop

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:01.900 
and the first defender then has to drop
in<00:00:59.239> and<00:00:59.539> becomes<00:01:00.020> a<00:01:00.140> second<00:01:00.469> defender<00:01:00.860> in<00:01:01.160> the
