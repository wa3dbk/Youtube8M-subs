top<00:03:03.959> of<00:03:04.019> a<00:03:04.469> cough<00:03:07.939> that's<00:03:08.939> it<00:03:09.150> stayed<00:03:09.540> pretty

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
top of a cough that's it stayed pretty

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.119 
top of a cough that's it stayed pretty
well<00:03:10.079> so<00:03:10.500> you<00:03:10.980> do<00:03:11.159> that<00:03:11.340> again<00:03:12.980> arranging<00:03:13.980> them

00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:14.129 
well so you do that again arranging them

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:17.659 
well so you do that again arranging them
all<00:03:14.280> into<00:03:14.639> a<00:03:14.790> pile<00:03:15.180> like<00:03:15.389> that<00:03:16.519> nothing

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:17.669 
all into a pile like that nothing

00:03:17.669 --> 00:03:28.179 
all into a pile like that nothing
the<00:03:18.569> remnants<00:03:19.019> of<00:03:19.139> the<00:03:19.199> past<00:03:19.560> stop<00:03:20.370> that<00:03:20.639> is<00:03:20.760> in

00:03:28.179 --> 00:03:28.189 

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:33.020 

that<00:03:29.189> one<00:03:29.400> also<00:03:30.379> it<00:03:31.379> curls<00:03:31.919> up<00:03:32.189> seeing<00:03:32.579> see

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
that one also it curls up seeing see

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.899 
that one also it curls up seeing see
she's<00:03:33.479> got<00:03:33.659> that<00:03:33.840> stack<00:03:34.409> of<00:03:34.620> curls<00:03:34.889> and<00:03:35.220> then

00:03:35.899 --> 00:03:35.909 
she's got that stack of curls and then

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:40.550 
she's got that stack of curls and then
the<00:03:36.060> top<00:03:37.129> you've<00:03:38.129> got<00:03:38.280> taking<00:03:38.519> your<00:03:38.729> head<00:03:39.560> top

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
the top you've got taking your head top

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.030 
the top you've got taking your head top
it<00:03:41.419> smooths<00:03:42.419> it<00:03:42.599> down<00:03:42.810> we<00:03:43.049> difficulties<00:03:43.799> and

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
it smooths it down we difficulties and

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.009 
it smooths it down we difficulties and
play<00:03:44.639> the<00:03:44.790> but<00:03:44.939> Carlton<00:03:45.389> lon<00:03:46.459> and<00:03:47.459> then<00:03:47.609> just

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:48.019 
play the but Carlton lon and then just

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:53.780 
play the but Carlton lon and then just
squash<00:03:49.019> it<00:03:49.049> in<00:03:49.199> and<00:03:50.030> they<00:03:51.030> have<00:03:52.639> layers<00:03:53.639> of

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
squash it in and they have layers of

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.949 
squash it in and they have layers of
pearls<00:03:54.060> instead<00:03:54.569> of<00:03:54.689> just<00:03:54.930> one<00:03:55.590> big<00:03:55.829> one<00:03:56.959> in

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
pearls instead of just one big one in

00:03:57.959 --> 00:03:59.920 
pearls instead of just one big one in
probably<00:03:58.829> it's<00:03:59.009> that<00:03:59.220> simple

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
probably it's that simple

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.860 
probably it's that simple
wait<00:04:00.930> for<00:04:01.500> there<00:04:02.000> and<00:04:03.000> I<00:04:03.060> just<00:04:03.239> vary<00:04:03.419> across<00:04:03.629> my

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
wait for there and I just vary across my

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.210 
wait for there and I just vary across my
whole<00:04:04.109> head<00:04:04.379> it<00:04:04.680> takes<00:04:04.919> about<00:04:06.169> 5-10<00:04:07.169> minutes<00:04:07.409> I

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
whole head it takes about 5-10 minutes I

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:15.979 
whole head it takes about 5-10 minutes I
think<00:04:09.209> took<00:04:09.870> me<00:04:10.109> about<00:04:10.759> ten<00:04:11.759> first<00:04:12.150> time<00:04:14.989> and

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989 
think took me about ten first time and

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:18.770 
think took me about ten first time and
also<00:04:16.289> if<00:04:16.440> you<00:04:16.560> want<00:04:16.709> to<00:04:16.799> bring<00:04:17.130> quite<00:04:17.849> a<00:04:17.909> nicer

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
also if you want to bring quite a nicer

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.930 
also if you want to bring quite a nicer
let's<00:04:19.680> do<00:04:19.919> is<00:04:20.190> brush<00:04:21.090> the<00:04:21.449> bottom<00:04:21.930> just<00:04:22.469> like

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 
let's do is brush the bottom just like

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:27.460 
let's do is brush the bottom just like
electric<00:04:25.159> and<00:04:26.159> just<00:04:26.370> feel<00:04:26.639> bad

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
electric and just feel bad

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.710 
electric and just feel bad
so<00:04:27.650> you<00:04:27.740> go<00:04:27.890> brush<00:04:28.250> that<00:04:28.430> top<00:04:28.700> Outback<00:04:29.330> bits

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 
so you go brush that top Outback bits

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.560 
so you go brush that top Outback bits
and<00:04:29.990> things<00:04:30.170> hold<00:04:30.530> it<00:04:30.650> in<00:04:30.770> place<00:04:30.950> just<00:04:31.570> brush

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.570 
and things hold it in place just brush

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:35.830 
and things hold it in place just brush
 to<00:04:33.680> it<00:04:34.150> and<00:04:35.150> now<00:04:35.300> you<00:04:35.360> can<00:04:35.600> get<00:04:35.750> with

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840 
 to it and now you can get with

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.710 
 to it and now you can get with
the<00:04:35.900> comb<00:04:36.110> as<00:04:36.350> well<00:04:36.530> kind<00:04:37.010> of<00:04:37.720> really

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 
the comb as well kind of really

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.220 
the comb as well kind of really
effective<00:04:39.100> and<00:04:40.100> get<00:04:41.030> a<00:04:41.150> dollar<00:04:41.360> probably<00:04:41.960> at

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:42.230 
effective and get a dollar probably at

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:45.130 
effective and get a dollar probably at
higher<00:04:42.880> during<00:04:43.880> this<00:04:43.970> process<00:04:44.270> for<00:04:44.660> that<00:04:44.690> snow

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:45.140 
higher during this process for that snow

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:47.920 
higher during this process for that snow
because<00:04:45.740> there's<00:04:46.280> been<00:04:46.910> might<00:04:47.120> click<00:04:47.420> timber

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:47.930 
because there's been might click timber

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:50.560 
because there's been might click timber

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:03.230 
back there just need to cut them off and

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:07.360 
back there just need to cut them off and
there<00:05:03.980> you<00:05:04.070> go<00:05:04.190> simple<00:05:05.030> as<00:05:05.800> that<00:05:06.800> and<00:05:07.040> if

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:07.370 
there you go simple as that and if

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:10.750 
there you go simple as that and if
anybody<00:05:07.700> have<00:05:07.850> any<00:05:08.030> more<00:05:08.150> questions<00:05:08.600> just
