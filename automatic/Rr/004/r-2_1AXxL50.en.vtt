00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:11.720
 this Sevillana does not need 

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:13.940
 boast neither surname nor sister's 

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:15.650
 sara vega the bow runs through his veins 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:19.269
 since she was little and has been demonstrating 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.269
 from 16 years old 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:24.180
 dancing 

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:28.710
 or singing 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:33.480
 as I have starting hiding until 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:35.579
 they did not give me sad love to dance and my 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.980
 express myself 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.100
 depending on the moment and the reason 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.820
 be it so I sing it or so I dance it or so what 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.489
 interpreted no 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:50.520
 has a lot to see in the motive not the 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:55.320
 message in each message has its own 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:58.350
 depending on what it is then 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:01.989
 I'm so sorry 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.059
 with an Andalusian and racial physicist Sara knows 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:06.460
 what he wants and he has clear that 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:07.900
 of the stage everything has where 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.360
 usually scenarios like saying is that my 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.490
 mind this this sacred and you have to 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.430
 meeting in many things is not only 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.990
 your talent or your voice or you or your 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:20.050
 interpretation 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:24.450
 or whatever it is I do not think there's also 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.450
 to expose in fashion you have to put 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:31.260
 that is why she takes care of the detail of her image 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.850
 there is not much depending on what you have 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:35.560
 the message you want to give at that moment 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.810
 it does not depend on the song it depends on the 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.670
 dance depends on the production in which 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.590
 I'm stuck when I better see myself when 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:45.250
 I do it myself 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:48.159
 I still comb my hair and I choose myself 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:51.880
 the clothes when I dress best when I 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:55.750
 they have made me a make 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:58.030
 Styling from outside but scratch then in 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.399
 that sense I'm a little bit complicated 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.259
 her but even if she prefers to be guided 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:04.929
 by your criteria sometimes now 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:06.910
 decides to put himself in the hands of experts 

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:11.110
 Once he has turned to the designer Ana 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:13.870
 locking to advise you very special 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:16.000
 which is another blue line that the zulia 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:19.360
 free is very good with a 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.860
 neckline in the form of crossed v and then 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.360
 the whole back stays with the same 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:26.210
 idea of this transparency 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:32.240
 and both in fashion and life now 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:36.620
 the mother always follows the same advice 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:40.550
 he always tells me to be me and go 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:42.830
 always decent with my truth and with that 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:46.040
 Well, you get everywhere 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.720
 for now Sara continues with firm step and 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.040
 decided towards success it seems that 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.040
 it's already an open secret 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:59.990
 it is not land of 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.560
 from anyone 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:04.520
 you 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.520
 to me
