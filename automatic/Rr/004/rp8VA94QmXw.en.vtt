00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
Slam and I didn't think the match was

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.120 
Slam and I didn't think the match was
particularly<00:00:31.349> interesting<00:00:31.890> it<00:00:32.009> was

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
particularly interesting it was

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.610 
particularly interesting it was
basically<00:00:32.460> a<00:00:33.059> beat<00:00:33.660> down<00:00:33.870> for<00:00:34.230> lack<00:00:34.380> of<00:00:34.410> a

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
basically a beat down for lack of a

played<00:00:41.969> alright<00:00:42.480> but<00:00:42.840> he<00:00:43.500> just<00:00:43.620> wasn't<00:00:43.950> a

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
played alright but he just wasn't a

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
match for for Federer and the one thing

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.000 
match for for Federer and the one thing
that<00:00:47.910> was<00:00:48.660> different<00:00:48.870> with<00:00:49.559> söderling

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
that was different with söderling

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.680 
that was different with söderling
earlier<00:00:50.340> matches<00:00:50.789> something<00:00:51.030> Federer<00:00:51.360> did

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
earlier matches something Federer did

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.389 
earlier matches something Federer did
which<00:00:52.230> he<00:00:52.350> said<00:00:52.530> in<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.680> press<00:00:52.890> conference

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
which he said in the press conference

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.750 
which he said in the press conference
that<00:00:53.940> I<00:00:54.000> think<00:00:54.480> was<00:00:54.629> a<00:00:54.660> real<00:00:54.930> effective<00:00:55.440> was

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
that I think was a real effective was

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.400 
that I think was a real effective was
Federer<00:00:56.760> talked<00:00:57.090> about<00:00:57.390> let's<00:00:57.660> say<00:00:57.750> söderling

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
Federer talked about let's say söderling

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.529 
Federer talked about let's say söderling

soderling<00:01:01.020> his<00:01:01.680> previous<00:01:02.160> opponents

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
soderling his previous opponents

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.979 
soderling his previous opponents
particularly<00:01:03.059> Nadal<00:01:03.359> with<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.629> other<00:01:03.750> guys

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
particularly Nadal with the other guys

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.260 
particularly Nadal with the other guys
would<00:01:04.680> hang<00:01:04.890> out<00:01:05.040> pretty<00:01:05.400> far<00:01:05.700> behind<00:01:05.909> the

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
would hang out pretty far behind the

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.899 
would hang out pretty far behind the
baseline<00:01:06.630> maybe<00:01:06.930> somewhere<00:01:07.409> in<00:01:07.470> here<00:01:08.130> when

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
baseline maybe somewhere in here when

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.359 
baseline maybe somewhere in here when
they<00:01:09.360> were<00:01:09.420> playing<00:01:10.040> soderling<00:01:11.040> and

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
they were playing soderling and

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:12.950 
they were playing soderling and
particularly<00:01:11.970> with<00:01:12.090> Nadal<00:01:12.390> he<00:01:12.630> was<00:01:12.750> far

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
particularly with Nadal he was far

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.929 
particularly with Nadal he was far
behind<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.260> baseline<00:01:13.560> and<00:01:13.920> he<00:01:14.490> was<00:01:14.640> dropping

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
behind the baseline and he was dropping

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.350 
behind the baseline and he was dropping
his<00:01:15.780> groundstrokes<00:01:16.290> real<00:01:17.250> short<00:01:17.670> and<00:01:17.939> then

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
his groundstrokes real short and then

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.940 
his groundstrokes real short and then
they<00:01:18.479> were<00:01:18.570> kicking<00:01:18.990> up<00:01:19.140> right<00:01:19.650> into

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
they were kicking up right into

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.499 
they were kicking up right into
söderling<00:01:20.369> wheelhouse<00:01:20.820> and<00:01:21.119> of<00:01:21.299> course

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
söderling wheelhouse and of course

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.230 
söderling wheelhouse and of course
söderling<00:01:21.960> had<00:01:22.080> no<00:01:22.229> problem<00:01:22.680> going<00:01:23.340> to<00:01:24.119> the

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
söderling had no problem going to the

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.390 
söderling had no problem going to the
corners<00:01:24.689> running<00:01:25.290> a<00:01:25.350> doll<00:01:25.560> all<00:01:25.799> over<00:01:26.310> the

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
corners running a doll all over the

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.070 
corners running a doll all over the
place<00:01:26.610> and<00:01:26.909> obviously<00:01:27.270> söderling<00:01:27.720> won<00:01:27.869> that

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
place and obviously söderling won that

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.370 
place and obviously söderling won that
match<00:01:28.939> Gonzales<00:01:29.939> and<00:01:30.180> David<00:01:30.930> enko<00:01:31.229> were

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
match Gonzales and David enko were

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.140 
match Gonzales and David enko were
pretty<00:01:31.590> far<00:01:31.799> behind<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.189> baseline<00:01:32.520> as<00:01:32.850> well

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
pretty far behind the baseline as well

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.350 
pretty far behind the baseline as well
but<00:01:34.140> Federer<00:01:34.650> and<00:01:34.979> Federer<00:01:35.670> always<00:01:36.000> does<00:01:36.210> this

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
but Federer and Federer always does this

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.760 
but Federer and Federer always does this
he<00:01:36.509> stands<00:01:36.780> closer<00:01:37.170> to<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.439> baseline

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
he stands closer to the baseline

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.429 
he stands closer to the baseline
sometimes<00:01:38.310> right<00:01:38.579> on<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:39.030> baseline<00:01:39.509> so

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
sometimes right on the baseline so

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.109 
sometimes right on the baseline so
söderling<00:01:41.009> wasn't<00:01:41.250> able<00:01:41.369> to<00:01:41.520> dictate<00:01:41.700> play

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
söderling wasn't able to dictate play

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.149 
söderling wasn't able to dictate play
like<00:01:42.509> he<00:01:42.630> did<00:01:42.840> against<00:01:43.200> those<00:01:43.320> other<00:01:43.560> guys<00:01:43.770> and

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
like he did against those other guys and

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.130 
like he did against those other guys and
obviously<00:01:44.340> Federer<00:01:44.970> dictated<00:01:45.509> play<00:01:45.750> because

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
obviously Federer dictated play because

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.469 
obviously Federer dictated play because
he<00:01:46.259> went<00:01:46.439> in<00:01:46.560> straight<00:01:46.770> sets<00:01:46.829> so<00:01:47.820> that<00:01:48.090> was<00:01:48.299> an

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
he went in straight sets so that was an

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.120 
he went in straight sets so that was an
adult<00:01:49.110> not<00:01:49.229> really<00:01:49.439> an<00:01:49.530> adjustment<00:01:49.920> that

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
adult not really an adjustment that

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.609 
adult not really an adjustment that
Federer<00:01:50.460> were<00:01:50.579> made<00:01:50.759> but<00:01:50.970> that<00:01:51.149> was<00:01:51.329> why

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
Federer were made but that was why

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:54.410 
Federer were made but that was why

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
Federer's use of the drop shot it's a

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.480 
Federer's use of the drop shot it's a
shot<00:02:04.110> he<00:02:04.350> hasn't<00:02:04.649> really<00:02:04.860> used<00:02:05.070> in<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.340> past

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
he incorporated it with great success

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.580 
he incorporated it with great success
into<00:02:12.060> his<00:02:12.180> game<00:02:12.390> this<00:02:12.569> past<00:02:12.780> French<00:02:13.140> Open

technique Federer's forehand grip as
we've<00:02:26.640> explained<00:02:27.060> in<00:02:27.150> another<00:02:27.209> video<00:02:27.569> is<00:02:27.840> an

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
we've explained in another video is an

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.050 
we've explained in another video is an
Eastern<00:02:28.440> and<00:02:28.650> with<00:02:29.010> that<00:02:29.160> conservative<00:02:29.790> grip

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
Eastern and with that conservative grip

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.690 
Eastern and with that conservative grip
it's<00:02:30.299> real<00:02:30.690> easy<00:02:30.959> for<00:02:31.140> him<00:02:31.410> to<00:02:31.470> slide<00:02:32.280> maybe<00:02:32.610> a

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
it's real easy for him to slide maybe a

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.880 
it's real easy for him to slide maybe a
bevel<00:02:33.150> or<00:02:33.269> so<00:02:33.480> maybe<00:02:33.690> half<00:02:34.019> a<00:02:34.140> bevel<00:02:34.440> over<00:02:34.709> and

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
bevel or so maybe half a bevel over and

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.100 
bevel or so maybe half a bevel over and
get<00:02:35.400> to<00:02:35.549> a<00:02:35.580> grip<00:02:35.910> that<00:02:36.239> he<00:02:36.390> can<00:02:36.540> use<00:02:36.750> to<00:02:36.900> enough

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
get to a grip that he can use to enough

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.500 
get to a grip that he can use to enough
to<00:02:37.440> effectively<00:02:37.920> hit<00:02:38.250> a<00:02:38.430> drop<00:02:38.940> shot<00:02:39.000> and

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
to effectively hit a drop shot and

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.449 
to effectively hit a drop shot and
that's<00:02:40.170> an<00:02:40.319> advantage<00:02:40.470> over<00:02:40.890> some<00:02:41.129> other<00:02:41.250> guys

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
that's an advantage over some other guys

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:43.070 
that's an advantage over some other guys
which<00:02:41.670> have<00:02:41.819> more<00:02:42.060> extreme<00:02:42.420> grips<00:02:42.750> and<00:02:42.989> then

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
which have more extreme grips and then

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.020 
which have more extreme grips and then
you<00:02:43.140> have<00:02:43.230> to<00:02:43.319> you<00:02:43.620> have<00:02:43.680> to<00:02:43.769> move<00:02:44.370> your<00:02:44.489> grip<00:02:44.730> a

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
you have to you have to move your grip a

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.910 
you have to you have to move your grip a
lot<00:02:45.510> more<00:02:45.690> to<00:02:45.900> get<00:02:46.019> to<00:02:46.140> an<00:02:46.230> appropriate<00:02:46.470> grip

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
lot more to get to an appropriate grip

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.580 
lot more to get to an appropriate grip
the<00:02:47.310> disguise<00:02:47.760> isn't<00:02:48.120> quite<00:02:48.420> there<00:02:48.690> so<00:02:49.380> that's

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
the disguise isn't quite there so that's

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.339 
the disguise isn't quite there so that's
one<00:02:49.860> technical<00:02:50.519> advantage<00:02:51.060> Federer<00:02:51.420> has<00:02:51.510> with

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:52.349 
one technical advantage Federer has with

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:56.839 
one technical advantage Federer has with
his<00:02:52.500> conservative<00:02:53.069> grip<00:02:53.930> also<00:02:55.099> Federer<00:02:56.099> was

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:56.849 
his conservative grip also Federer was

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:59.630 
his conservative grip also Federer was
really<00:02:57.299> smart<00:02:57.599> about<00:02:57.930> when<00:02:58.319> he<00:02:58.799> used<00:02:59.250> his<00:02:59.430> drop

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
really smart about when he used his drop

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.220 
really smart about when he used his drop
drops<00:03:00.030> I<00:03:00.120> was<00:03:00.269> great<00:03:00.510> I<00:03:00.660> mean<00:03:00.840> the<00:03:00.930> ball<00:03:01.079> would

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
drops I was great I mean the ball would

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.319 
drops I was great I mean the ball would
bounce<00:03:01.410> a<00:03:01.860> bunch<00:03:02.220> of<00:03:02.340> times<00:03:02.400> before<00:03:02.790> it<00:03:03.030> got<00:03:03.150> to

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329 
bounce a bunch of times before it got to

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:06.500 
bounce a bunch of times before it got to
the<00:03:03.450> service<00:03:03.780> line<00:03:03.989> but<00:03:04.890> it<00:03:05.579> was<00:03:06.030> when<00:03:06.329> he

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
the service line but it was when he

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.750 
the service line but it was when he
chose<00:03:06.750> to<00:03:06.780> use<00:03:07.079> his<00:03:07.110> drop<00:03:07.530> shot<00:03:07.799> that<00:03:07.980> really

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
chose to use his drop shot that really

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.520 
chose to use his drop shot that really
set<00:03:09.180> that<00:03:09.900> point<00:03:10.230> apart<00:03:10.650> now<00:03:12.200> famously<00:03:13.200> you

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
set that point apart now famously you

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.130 
set that point apart now famously you
could<00:03:13.650> say<00:03:13.829> Federer<00:03:14.250> drop<00:03:14.730> shotted<00:03:15.180> on<00:03:15.360> Jose

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
could say Federer drop shotted on Jose

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.530 
could say Federer drop shotted on Jose
ah<00:03:16.170> kusoo<00:03:16.470> shows<00:03:16.920> second<00:03:17.819> serve<00:03:18.030> a<00:03:18.239> couple

shotting<00:03:21.269> on<00:03:21.450> a<00:03:21.510> second<00:03:21.840> serve<00:03:22.019> well<00:03:22.410> when

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
shotting on a second serve well when

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.300 
shotting on a second serve well when
most<00:03:23.790> pros<00:03:24.120> hit<00:03:24.359> a<00:03:24.389> second<00:03:24.810> serve<00:03:25.160> when<00:03:26.160> they

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
most pros hit a second serve when they

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.050 
most pros hit a second serve when they
land<00:03:26.639> they<00:03:27.540> are<00:03:27.780> a<00:03:28.109> little<00:03:28.440> bit<00:03:28.709> inside<00:03:29.370> the

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
land they are a little bit inside the

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.460 
land they are a little bit inside the
baseline<00:03:30.420> let's<00:03:30.720> say<00:03:30.900> they're<00:03:31.049> right<00:03:31.230> about

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
baseline let's say they're right about

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.740 
baseline let's say they're right about
here<00:03:31.769> well<00:03:32.459> this<00:03:32.700> is<00:03:32.819> not<00:03:32.970> a<00:03:33.030> comfortable

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
here well this is not a comfortable

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.990 
here well this is not a comfortable
position<00:03:34.319> from<00:03:35.190> which<00:03:35.370> to<00:03:35.430> hit<00:03:35.639> ground

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
position from which to hit ground

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.420 
position from which to hit ground
strokes<00:03:36.359> so<00:03:36.630> players<00:03:37.290> are<00:03:37.530> going<00:03:37.709> to<00:03:37.799> retreat

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
strokes so players are going to retreat

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.069 
strokes so players are going to retreat
to<00:03:38.700> their<00:03:39.660> natural<00:03:40.790> ground<00:03:41.790> stroke<00:03:42.239> depth<00:03:42.630> so

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:43.079 
to their natural ground stroke depth so

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:44.680 
to their natural ground stroke depth so
they're<00:03:43.260> moving<00:03:43.380> backwards<00:03:44.099> in<00:03:44.280> other<00:03:44.430> words

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
they're moving backwards in other words

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:51.050 
they're moving backwards in other words
so<00:03:45.690> if<00:03:46.049> acha<00:03:46.709> suso<00:03:47.930> serves<00:03:48.930> as<00:03:49.440> the<00:03:50.030> ball<00:03:51.030> is

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
so if acha suso serves as the ball is

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.339 
so if acha suso serves as the ball is
traveling<00:03:51.329> through<00:03:51.630> the<00:03:51.660> air<00:03:51.750> he<00:03:52.019> is<00:03:52.109> moving

00:03:52.339 --> 00:03:52.349 
traveling through the air he is moving

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:55.039 
traveling through the air he is moving
back<00:03:52.680> and<00:03:53.010> then<00:03:53.400> if<00:03:53.549> Federer<00:03:53.910> hits<00:03:54.540> that<00:03:54.720> drop

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
back and then if Federer hits that drop

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:58.339 
back and then if Federer hits that drop
shot<00:03:56.060> Federer<00:03:57.060> or<00:03:57.269> excuse<00:03:57.630> me<00:03:57.660> ah<00:03:57.810> kusoo<00:03:58.079> so

00:03:58.339 --> 00:03:58.349 
shot Federer or excuse me ah kusoo so

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:00.830 
shot Federer or excuse me ah kusoo so
has<00:03:58.470> to<00:03:58.590> stop<00:03:58.919> and<00:03:59.160> then<00:03:59.760> close<00:04:00.239> on<00:04:00.540> the<00:04:00.660> ball

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
has to stop and then close on the ball

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.819 
has to stop and then close on the ball
so<00:04:01.019> he<00:04:01.109> has<00:04:01.200> to<00:04:01.349> change<00:04:01.620> direction<00:04:02.190> and<00:04:03.829> stuff

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:04.829 
so he has to change direction and stuff

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:05.690 
so he has to change direction and stuff
to<00:04:04.950> get<00:04:05.040> to<00:04:05.130> the<00:04:05.220> ball<00:04:05.370> when<00:04:05.609> you're

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
to get to the ball when you're

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:06.979 
to get to the ball when you're
backpedaling<00:04:06.150> and<00:04:06.480> then<00:04:06.569> you<00:04:06.630> have<00:04:06.720> to<00:04:06.780> stop

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
backpedaling and then you have to stop

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:09.190 
backpedaling and then you have to stop
and<00:04:07.200> sprint<00:04:07.590> all<00:04:07.739> the<00:04:07.769> way<00:04:07.859> to<00:04:08.010> the<00:04:08.280> net<00:04:08.459> so

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 
and sprint all the way to the net so

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.000 
and sprint all the way to the net so
Federer<00:04:10.609> was<00:04:11.609> real<00:04:12.000> smart<00:04:12.510> about

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
Federer was real smart about

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:15.770 
Federer was real smart about
understanding<00:04:14.010> what<00:04:14.760> direction<00:04:15.269> his

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
understanding what direction his

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.259 
understanding what direction his
opponents<00:04:16.410> were<00:04:17.010> moving<00:04:17.459> when<00:04:17.669> he<00:04:17.820> used<00:04:18.090> the

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269 
opponents were moving when he used the

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:21.020 
opponents were moving when he used the
drop<00:04:18.510> shot<00:04:18.780> he<00:04:19.590> would<00:04:19.739> also<00:04:19.889> do<00:04:20.310> it<00:04:20.430> if<00:04:20.579> if<00:04:20.820> his

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
drop shot he would also do it if if his

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:23.029 
drop shot he would also do it if if his
opponent<00:04:21.180> was<00:04:21.599> hitting<00:04:21.840> out<00:04:21.959> here<00:04:22.349> and<00:04:22.500> we're

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:23.039 
opponent was hitting out here and we're

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:24.620 
opponent was hitting out here and we're
covering<00:04:23.340> back<00:04:23.520> to<00:04:23.700> the<00:04:23.789> middle<00:04:24.090> or<00:04:24.300> even

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
covering back to the middle or even

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.080 
covering back to the middle or even
recovering<00:04:25.169> back<00:04:25.440> a<00:04:25.469> little<00:04:25.860> bit<00:04:26.099> he<00:04:26.940> would

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
recovering back a little bit he would

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.350 
recovering back a little bit he would
hit<00:04:27.210> the

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
hit the

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.909 
hit the
drop<00:04:27.569> shot<00:04:27.840> over<00:04:28.110> here<00:04:28.379> so<00:04:28.590> they<00:04:28.710> would<00:04:28.800> have

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:28.919 
drop shot over here so they would have

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:31.399 
drop shot over here so they would have
to<00:04:29.009> stop<00:04:29.280> and<00:04:29.520> then<00:04:29.939> close<00:04:30.330> to<00:04:30.900> get<00:04:31.139> to<00:04:31.289> the

00:04:31.399 --> 00:04:31.409 
to stop and then close to get to the

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:33.189 
to stop and then close to get to the
ball<00:04:31.590> and<00:04:31.770> again<00:04:31.889> that's<00:04:32.129> tough<00:04:32.430> I<00:04:32.610> mean

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:33.199 
ball and again that's tough I mean

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:35.390 
ball and again that's tough I mean
soderling<00:04:34.199> for<00:04:34.409> example<00:04:34.770> didn't<00:04:35.069> even<00:04:35.250> run

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
soderling for example didn't even run

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.730 
soderling for example didn't even run
for<00:04:35.639> some<00:04:35.789> of<00:04:35.909> those<00:04:35.969> balls<00:04:36.300> because<00:04:37.169> he<00:04:37.620> was

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 
for some of those balls because he was

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.110 
for some of those balls because he was
moving<00:04:38.099> and<00:04:38.310> the<00:04:38.370> wrong<00:04:38.550> direction<00:04:38.729> he<00:04:39.000> got

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
moving and the wrong direction he got

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.999 
moving and the wrong direction he got
wrong<00:04:39.330> footed<00:04:39.780> so<00:04:40.199> he<00:04:40.319> really<00:04:40.590> didn't<00:04:40.860> have<00:04:40.949> a

00:04:40.999 --> 00:04:41.009 
wrong footed so he really didn't have a

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:43.339 
wrong footed so he really didn't have a
chance<00:04:41.280> to<00:04:41.939> close<00:04:42.210> to<00:04:42.810> get<00:04:42.960> to<00:04:43.080> the<00:04:43.169> ball

00:04:43.339 --> 00:04:43.349 
chance to close to get to the ball

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:45.200 
chance to close to get to the ball
there's<00:04:44.189> one<00:04:44.250> final<00:04:44.490> point<00:04:44.819> I<00:04:44.939> want<00:04:45.090> to<00:04:45.150> make

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
there's one final point I want to make

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:46.909 
there's one final point I want to make
about<00:04:45.449> federer's<00:04:45.930> used<00:04:46.139> to<00:04:46.259> the<00:04:46.379> dr<00:04:46.620> shot

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:46.919 
about federer's used to the dr shot

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:48.080 
about federer's used to the dr shot
because<00:04:47.099> it<00:04:47.250> was<00:04:47.340> interesting<00:04:47.789> to<00:04:47.819> watch

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
because it was interesting to watch

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:51.290 
because it was interesting to watch
where<00:04:48.780> Federer<00:04:49.650> positioned<00:04:50.250> himself<00:04:50.400> after

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300 
where Federer positioned himself after

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.659 
where Federer positioned himself after
he<00:04:51.389> hit<00:04:51.539> the<00:04:51.659> shot<00:04:51.889> let's<00:04:52.889> say<00:04:53.039> feds<00:04:53.370> right

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:53.669 
he hit the shot let's say feds right

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:56.029 
he hit the shot let's say feds right
here<00:04:54.030> and<00:04:54.180> he<00:04:55.080> gets<00:04:55.259> a<00:04:55.379> forehand<00:04:55.740> drop-shot

00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:56.039 
here and he gets a forehand drop-shot

00:04:56.039 --> 00:04:58.909 
here and he gets a forehand drop-shot
and<00:04:56.610> he<00:04:57.150> puts<00:04:57.389> it<00:04:57.569> over<00:04:57.900> here<00:04:58.319> somewhere<00:04:58.590> and

00:04:58.909 --> 00:04:58.919 
and he puts it over here somewhere and

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:00.980 
and he puts it over here somewhere and
his<00:04:59.219> opponent<00:04:59.330> obviously<00:05:00.330> closes<00:05:00.750> on<00:05:00.870> the

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
his opponent obviously closes on the

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:05.029 
his opponent obviously closes on the
ball<00:05:01.430> well<00:05:02.430> Federer<00:05:03.360> is<00:05:03.719> also<00:05:04.469> going<00:05:04.650> to<00:05:04.740> close

00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:05.039 
ball well Federer is also going to close

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:08.300 
ball well Federer is also going to close
he'll<00:05:05.819> go<00:05:06.029> from<00:05:06.270> right<00:05:06.449> here<00:05:06.719> and<00:05:06.930> he<00:05:07.310> normally

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
he'll go from right here and he normally

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.909 
he'll go from right here and he normally
would<00:05:08.460> move<00:05:08.669> about<00:05:09.569> to<00:05:09.840> here<00:05:10.080> somewhere<00:05:10.560> in<00:05:10.710> no

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:10.919 
would move about to here somewhere in no

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:13.219 
would move about to here somewhere in no
man's<00:05:11.189> land<00:05:11.539> because<00:05:12.539> what<00:05:12.719> he<00:05:12.810> was<00:05:12.960> trying<00:05:13.199> to

00:05:13.219 --> 00:05:13.229 
man's land because what he was trying to

do<00:05:13.439> was<00:05:13.469> cover<00:05:13.919> most<00:05:14.250> of<00:05:14.370> his<00:05:14.490> bases<00:05:14.879> he<00:05:15.000> wanted

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.210 
do was cover most of his bases he wanted

do was cover most of his bases he wanted
to<00:05:15.300> cover<00:05:15.509> I'm<00:05:15.840> say<00:05:16.020> his<00:05:16.169> opponent<00:05:16.529> makes

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.620 
to cover I'm say his opponent makes

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:18.379 
to cover I'm say his opponent makes
contact<00:05:17.039> with<00:05:17.159> the<00:05:17.310> ball<00:05:17.430> here<00:05:17.669> I<00:05:17.819> wanted<00:05:18.330> to

00:05:23.059 --> 00:05:23.069 
cover the cross-court but he also wanted

00:05:23.069 --> 00:05:27.409 
cover the cross-court but he also wanted
to<00:05:23.159> cover<00:05:23.400> the<00:05:24.090> angle<00:05:24.750> drop<00:05:25.050> shot<00:05:25.639> to<00:05:26.639> the<00:05:26.879> open
