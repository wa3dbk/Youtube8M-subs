and<00:01:48.990> then<00:01:49.560> you<00:01:49.680> can<00:01:49.799> just<00:01:49.920> turn<00:01:50.130> those<00:01:50.250> off

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
and then you can just turn those off

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.700 
and then you can just turn those off
easily<00:01:51.000> from<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.869> main<00:01:52.079> screen<00:01:52.380> of<00:01:52.500> the

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
easily from the main screen of the

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.440 
easily from the main screen of the
camera<00:01:53.009> so<00:01:53.759> that's<00:01:53.909> just<00:01:54.030> a<00:01:54.149> cool<00:01:54.329> little

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
camera so that's just a cool little

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.480 
camera so that's just a cool little
tweak<00:01:54.810> it's<00:01:55.409> pretty<00:01:55.680> useful<00:01:55.860> and<00:01:56.219> it's

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
tweak it's pretty useful and it's

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:57.980 
tweak it's pretty useful and it's
definitely<00:01:56.880> some<00:01:57.149> features<00:01:57.420> that<00:01:57.540> people<00:01:57.659> had

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
definitely some features that people had

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.929 
definitely some features that people had
been<00:01:58.500> missing<00:01:58.740> in<00:01:58.979> the<00:01:59.070> camera<00:01:59.369> app<00:01:59.490> and<00:01:59.670> now

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
been missing in the camera app and now

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.370 
been missing in the camera app and now
we're<00:02:00.030> going<00:02:00.119> to<00:02:00.180> be<00:02:00.299> showing<00:02:00.479> you<00:02:00.689> a<00:02:00.869> couple

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
we're going to be showing you a couple

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.219 
we're going to be showing you a couple
of<00:02:01.469> tweaks<00:02:01.850> so<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:03.210> next<00:02:03.450> one<00:02:03.630> that<00:02:03.659> just<00:02:04.049> came

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
of tweaks so the next one that just came

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.830 
of tweaks so the next one that just came
out<00:02:04.259> relatively<00:02:04.979> recently<00:02:05.490> is<00:02:05.700> called<00:02:05.969> TCP

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
out relatively recently is called TCP

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.690 
out relatively recently is called TCP
optimizer<00:02:07.500> and<00:02:07.649> what<00:02:07.979> this<00:02:08.129> basically<00:02:08.310> does

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
optimizer and what this basically does

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:09.369 
optimizer and what this basically does
is

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:09.379 
is

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:12.140 
is
appliances<00:02:10.379> your<00:02:10.560> device<00:02:10.860> to<00:02:11.220> run<00:02:11.489> YouTube

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
appliances your device to run YouTube

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.309 
appliances your device to run YouTube
videos<00:02:12.510> faster<00:02:12.989> so

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
videos faster so

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.679 
videos faster so
it<00:02:13.590> starts<00:02:14.099> them<00:02:14.280> and<00:02:14.519> loads<00:02:14.730> videos<00:02:15.209> faster

00:02:15.679 --> 00:02:15.689 
it starts them and loads videos faster

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:17.929 
it starts them and loads videos faster
doesn't<00:02:16.379> matter<00:02:16.590> what<00:02:16.769> network<00:02:17.219> you're<00:02:17.459> on<00:02:17.579> it

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:17.939 
doesn't matter what network you're on it

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:20.509 
doesn't matter what network you're on it
just<00:02:18.239> supposedly<00:02:19.170> helps<00:02:19.590> make<00:02:20.310> it<00:02:20.340> a<00:02:20.430> little

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:20.519 
just supposedly helps make it a little

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:22.190 
just supposedly helps make it a little
faster<00:02:20.790> now<00:02:21.150> there's<00:02:21.480> not<00:02:21.599> that<00:02:21.780> much<00:02:21.959> of<00:02:22.139> a

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
faster now there's not that much of a

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.250 
faster now there's not that much of a
difference<00:02:22.560> so<00:02:22.849> it's<00:02:23.849> hard<00:02:24.090> to<00:02:24.150> demo<00:02:24.540> the

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
difference so it's hard to demo the

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.819 
difference so it's hard to demo the
difference<00:02:25.560> is<00:02:25.680> also<00:02:26.010> because<00:02:26.310> just<00:02:26.639> the

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:27.829 
difference is also because just the

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:30.470 
difference is also because just the
latency<00:02:28.829> of<00:02:28.859> the<00:02:28.950> Internet<00:02:29.370> and<00:02:29.670> the<00:02:30.150> second

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
latency of the Internet and the second

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.050 
latency of the Internet and the second
thing<00:02:30.599> I<00:02:30.810> want<00:02:30.930> to<00:02:31.049> show<00:02:31.200> you<00:02:31.260> is<00:02:32.060> mobile

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
thing I want to show you is mobile

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.509 
thing I want to show you is mobile
notifier<00:02:33.510> so<00:02:33.900> beta<00:02:34.349> 4<00:02:34.680> came<00:02:34.980> out<00:02:35.129> a<00:02:35.159> little

notifications and if ready text me right
now<00:02:43.769> you'll<00:02:44.519> see<00:02:44.939> how<00:02:45.780> it<00:02:45.989> looks<00:02:46.260> and<00:02:46.530> we'll

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
now you'll see how it looks and we'll

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.189 
now you'll see how it looks and we'll
just<00:02:47.430> wait<00:02:47.579> for<00:02:47.639> that<00:02:49.459> all<00:02:50.459> right<00:02:50.549> so<00:02:50.909> just

00:02:58.909 --> 00:02:58.919 
typing in the text and just wait for

00:02:58.919 --> 00:03:02.869 
typing in the text and just wait for
this<00:02:59.010> to<00:02:59.069> show<00:02:59.250> up<00:02:59.489> on<00:02:59.609> the<00:02:59.760> device<00:03:01.549> and<00:03:02.549> there

00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:02.879 
this to show up on the device and there

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:03.289 
this to show up on the device and there
you<00:03:03.000> go

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:03.299 
you go

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:05.809 
you go
so<00:03:03.449> you<00:03:03.540> see<00:03:03.889> you'll<00:03:04.889> have<00:03:05.069> a<00:03:05.099> strip<00:03:05.549> across

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819 
so you see you'll have a strip across

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:08.509 
so you see you'll have a strip across
the<00:03:06.030> top<00:03:06.239> of<00:03:06.269> your<00:03:06.389> home<00:03:07.260> screen<00:03:07.560> or<00:03:08.010> wherever

the top of your home screen or wherever

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:10.220 
the top of your home screen or wherever
whatever<00:03:08.939> app<00:03:09.329> you're<00:03:09.540> in<00:03:09.659> and<00:03:09.900> it's<00:03:10.049> less

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
whatever app you're in and it's less

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.140 
whatever app you're in and it's less
intrusive<00:03:10.680> than<00:03:10.889> like<00:03:11.280> the<00:03:11.430> blue<00:03:11.609> bubble<00:03:12.000> that

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
intrusive than like the blue bubble that

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.149 
intrusive than like the blue bubble that
can<00:03:12.359> get<00:03:12.510> sort<00:03:13.139> of<00:03:13.230> annoying<00:03:13.500> and<00:03:13.799> not<00:03:13.949> look

00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:14.159 
can get sort of annoying and not look

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:15.740 
can get sort of annoying and not look
that<00:03:14.310> nice<00:03:14.489> and<00:03:14.790> when<00:03:15.090> you<00:03:15.180> tap<00:03:15.329> it<00:03:15.540> you<00:03:15.599> have

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
that nice and when you tap it you have

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.800 
that nice and when you tap it you have
two<00:03:15.930> options<00:03:16.189> later<00:03:17.189> or<00:03:17.579> open<00:03:18.030> we<00:03:18.419> just<00:03:18.449> tap

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
two options later or open we just tap

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.420 
two options later or open we just tap
later<00:03:19.079> it<00:03:19.769> will<00:03:20.009> go<00:03:20.159> away

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
later it will go away

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.539 
later it will go away
and<00:03:20.849> you'll<00:03:21.299> see<00:03:21.540> if<00:03:21.780> you<00:03:21.930> lock<00:03:22.139> your<00:03:22.290> device

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:22.549 
and you'll see if you lock your device

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:25.129 
and you'll see if you lock your device
you'll<00:03:23.549> have<00:03:23.729> missed<00:03:23.970> notifications<00:03:24.629> a<00:03:24.870> list

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:25.139 
you'll have missed notifications a list

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:27.439 
you'll have missed notifications a list
on<00:03:25.500> your<00:03:25.560> home<00:03:25.949> screen<00:03:26.250> and<00:03:26.430> it<00:03:27.150> will<00:03:27.239> show<00:03:27.389> you

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:27.449 
on your home screen and it will show you

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:29.899

that<00:03:27.720> I<00:03:27.810> got<00:03:27.959> a<00:03:28.229> text<00:03:29.009> from<00:03:29.040> Freddie<00:03:29.400> so

00:03:29.899 --> 00:03:29.909 
that I got a text from Freddie so

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:31.219 
that I got a text from Freddie so
basically<00:03:30.299> it's<00:03:30.509> just<00:03:30.569> a<00:03:30.810> smoother

00:03:31.219 --> 00:03:31.229 
basically it's just a smoother

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:33.080 
basically it's just a smoother
integration<00:03:31.859> of<00:03:32.099> the<00:03:32.250> push<00:03:32.430> notifications

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
integration of the push notifications

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:34.849 
integration of the push notifications
that<00:03:33.269> Apple<00:03:33.540> has<00:03:33.689> built<00:03:33.989> into<00:03:34.290> their<00:03:34.409> system

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:34.859 
that Apple has built into their system

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:36.679 
that Apple has built into their system
it<00:03:35.430> just<00:03:35.669> allows<00:03:35.970> you<00:03:36.180> to<00:03:36.299> have<00:03:36.419> a<00:03:36.449> less

00:03:36.679 --> 00:03:36.689 
it just allows you to have a less

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:39.559 
it just allows you to have a less
intrusive<00:03:37.280> method<00:03:38.280> of<00:03:38.489> displaying<00:03:39.269> the

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:39.569 
intrusive method of displaying the
