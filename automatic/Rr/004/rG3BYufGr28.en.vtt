00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.770 
only handle in 720 the next-gen graphics
are<00:02:43.720> going<00:02:44.079> to<00:02:44.230> be<00:02:44.440> 1080<00:02:45.209> so<00:02:46.209> I<00:02:46.239> mean<00:02:46.510> you<00:02:46.630> can

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
are going to be 1080 so I mean you can

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.020 
are going to be 1080 so I mean you can
only<00:02:46.900> imagine<00:02:47.290> the<00:02:47.560> detail<00:02:48.099> and<00:02:48.340> if<00:02:48.730> you<00:02:48.849> look

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
only imagine the detail and if you look

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.360 
only imagine the detail and if you look
at<00:02:49.120> these<00:02:49.209> photos<00:02:49.620> the<00:02:50.620> detail<00:02:50.980> is<00:02:51.010> just

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
at these photos the detail is just

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.490 
at these photos the detail is just
unreal<00:02:51.760> looks<00:02:52.420> like<00:02:52.599> I<00:02:52.630> almost<00:02:52.989> look<00:02:53.470> like

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
unreal looks like I almost look like

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.449 
unreal looks like I almost look like
that<00:02:54.340> there<00:02:54.549> is<00:02:54.760> a<00:02:55.150> human<00:02:56.109> person<00:02:56.319> you<00:02:57.040> know<00:02:57.160> in

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
that there is a human person you know in

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:58.860 
that there is a human person you know in
front<00:02:57.609> of<00:02:57.790> us<00:02:57.880> taking<00:02:58.150> pictures<00:02:58.569> that

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
front of us taking pictures that

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.210 
front of us taking pictures that
someone's<00:02:59.170> taking<00:02:59.410> a<00:02:59.470> picture<00:02:59.650> of<00:02:59.829> a<00:02:59.920> human

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
someone's taking a picture of a human

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.860 
someone's taking a picture of a human
you<00:03:00.819> know<00:03:00.850> it<00:03:01.120> doesn't<00:03:01.390> really<00:03:01.510> look<00:03:01.810> like

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
you know it doesn't really look like

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.470 
you know it doesn't really look like
computer<00:03:02.470> graphics<00:03:02.890> so<00:03:03.459> what<00:03:03.730> I'm<00:03:03.819> hoping<00:03:04.030> is

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
computer graphics so what I'm hoping is

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.220 
computer graphics so what I'm hoping is
is<00:03:04.750> that<00:03:05.530> these<00:03:05.890> next-gen<00:03:06.609> graphics<00:03:07.230> won't

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
is that these next-gen graphics won't

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.289 
is that these next-gen graphics won't
affect<00:03:08.739> the<00:03:08.920> gameplay<00:03:09.160> you<00:03:09.940> know<00:03:10.060> yeah

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:10.299 
affect the gameplay you know yeah

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:11.789 
affect the gameplay you know yeah
they're<00:03:10.540> going<00:03:10.660> to<00:03:10.720> have<00:03:10.810> sick<00:03:11.079> graphics<00:03:11.290> but

00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:11.799 
they're going to have sick graphics but

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:13.289 
they're going to have sick graphics but
how<00:03:11.950> is<00:03:12.489> it<00:03:12.579> going<00:03:12.670> to<00:03:12.760> affect<00:03:13.030> the<00:03:13.120> gameplay

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:13.299 
how is it going to affect the gameplay

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:15.780 
how is it going to affect the gameplay
you<00:03:14.049> know<00:03:14.170> I'm<00:03:14.290> saying<00:03:14.560> like<00:03:14.769> because<00:03:15.430> if<00:03:15.639> the

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
you know I'm saying like because if the

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.490 
you know I'm saying like because if the
new<00:03:15.940> black<00:03:16.299> ops<00:03:16.600> I'm<00:03:16.930> not<00:03:17.079> really<00:03:17.200> a<00:03:17.319> big<00:03:17.440> fan

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
new black ops I'm not really a big fan

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.949 
new black ops I'm not really a big fan
of<00:03:17.769> it<00:03:18.010> I<00:03:18.190> think<00:03:18.579> mw3<00:03:19.030> was<00:03:19.420> a<00:03:19.450> hell<00:03:19.660> of<00:03:19.690> a<00:03:19.810> lot

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
of it I think mw3 was a hell of a lot

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:23.129 
of it I think mw3 was a hell of a lot
better<00:03:20.139> if<00:03:20.470> you<00:03:20.620> compare<00:03:21.040> mw3<00:03:21.730> to<00:03:22.600> black<00:03:22.870> ops

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:23.139 
better if you compare mw3 to black ops

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:24.990 
better if you compare mw3 to black ops
with<00:03:23.739> the<00:03:23.889> graphics<00:03:24.400> and<00:03:24.549> everything<00:03:24.880> like

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
with the graphics and everything like

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.960 
with the graphics and everything like
that<00:03:25.590> you<00:03:26.590> can<00:03:26.769> tell<00:03:26.950> the<00:03:27.069> difference<00:03:27.280> like

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
that you can tell the difference like

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:29.699 
that you can tell the difference like
everything<00:03:28.359> in<00:03:28.480> mw3<00:03:28.840> just<00:03:29.170> seems<00:03:29.350> like<00:03:29.500> a<00:03:29.560> lot

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
everything in mw3 just seems like a lot

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:32.309 
everything in mw3 just seems like a lot
bigger<00:03:30.280> you<00:03:30.819> know<00:03:30.940> you<00:03:31.000> can<00:03:31.239> run<00:03:31.569> and<00:03:31.870> gun<00:03:32.019> like

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:32.319 
bigger you know you can run and gun like

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:34.140 
bigger you know you can run and gun like
I<00:03:32.410> play<00:03:32.590> hardcore<00:03:32.829> kill<00:03:33.130> confirm<00:03:33.430> you<00:03:33.850> can<00:03:34.000> run

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
I play hardcore kill confirm you can run

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:35.879 
I play hardcore kill confirm you can run
a<00:03:34.180> gun<00:03:34.420> jump<00:03:34.810> around<00:03:34.900> corners<00:03:35.530> and<00:03:35.769> hit

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:35.889 
a gun jump around corners and hit

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:38.099 
a gun jump around corners and hit
someone<00:03:36.160> in<00:03:36.190> the<00:03:36.250> face<00:03:36.310> you<00:03:37.150> know<00:03:37.269> with<00:03:37.630> the

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:38.109 
someone in the face you know with the

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:41.309 
someone in the face you know with the
black<00:03:38.319> ops<00:03:38.620> I<00:03:38.920> don't<00:03:39.760> know<00:03:39.880> it's<00:03:40.150> just<00:03:40.299> to<00:03:41.109> me

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:41.319 
black ops I don't know it's just to me

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:46.349 
black ops I don't know it's just to me
it<00:03:41.590> seems<00:03:41.799> like<00:03:42.220> that<00:03:44.459> it's<00:03:45.459> a<00:03:45.609> lot<00:03:45.760> more<00:03:45.790> stiff

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:46.359 
it seems like that it's a lot more stiff

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:49.110 
it seems like that it's a lot more stiff
I<00:03:46.630> guess<00:03:47.260> you<00:03:47.410> can<00:03:47.560> call<00:03:47.709> it<00:03:47.769> you<00:03:48.340> know<00:03:48.459> I<00:03:48.489> it's

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
I guess you can call it you know I it's

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.970 
I guess you can call it you know I it's
not<00:03:49.269> really<00:03:49.510> a<00:03:49.540> free<00:03:49.930> play<00:03:50.200> I<00:03:50.230> don't<00:03:50.530> think<00:03:50.739> a

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
not really a free play I don't think a

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.670 
not really a free play I don't think a
granite<00:03:51.670> it<00:03:51.819> is<00:03:51.970> better<00:03:52.239> than<00:03:52.420> halo<00:03:52.690> you<00:03:53.620> know

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
granite it is better than halo you know

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.460 
granite it is better than halo you know
because<00:03:53.950> halo<00:03:54.280> you<00:03:54.340> can't<00:03:54.670> do<00:03:54.819> a<00:03:54.849> whole<00:03:55.060> lot

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
because halo you can't do a whole lot

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.470 
because halo you can't do a whole lot
Gears<00:03:56.470> of<00:03:56.560> War<00:03:56.680> is<00:03:57.069> just<00:03:57.280> like<00:03:57.400> halo<00:03:57.849> i'm
