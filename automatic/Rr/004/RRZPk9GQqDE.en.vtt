00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:24.100 
in dive watches about 10 years ago and

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.070 
in dive watches about 10 years ago and
this<00:00:24.670> is<00:00:24.820> a<00:00:24.850> new<00:00:25.060> version<00:00:25.270> so<00:00:25.600> this<00:00:25.720> is<00:00:25.869> it

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:26.080 
this is a new version so this is it

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.020 
this is a new version so this is it
looks<00:00:26.350> like<00:00:26.500> steel<00:00:26.860> polished<00:00:27.460> but<00:00:27.880> it's

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:28.030 
looks like steel polished but it's

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:30.660 
looks like steel polished but it's
actually<00:00:28.570> ceramic<00:00:29.199> infused<00:00:30.039> with<00:00:30.220> titanium

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:30.670 
actually ceramic infused with titanium

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:33.180 
actually ceramic infused with titanium
so<00:00:31.630> you<00:00:31.690> get<00:00:31.810> a<00:00:31.840> watch<00:00:32.050> that's<00:00:32.289> about<00:00:32.680> or<00:00:33.010> maybe

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:33.190 
so you get a watch that's about or maybe

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:34.950 
so you get a watch that's about or maybe
slightly<00:00:33.820> lighter<00:00:34.030> than<00:00:34.149> a<00:00:34.300> steel<00:00:34.570> watch<00:00:34.780> it

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:34.960 
slightly lighter than a steel watch it

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.130 
slightly lighter than a steel watch it
feels<00:00:35.170> about<00:00:35.320> the<00:00:35.440> same<00:00:35.559> but<00:00:36.520> it<00:00:36.760> is<00:00:37.239> reputed

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:38.140 
feels about the same but it is reputed

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.529 
feels about the same but it is reputed
to<00:00:38.229> be<00:00:38.260> incredibly<00:00:39.069> hard<00:00:39.339> difficult<00:00:40.239> scratch

00:00:40.529 --> 00:00:40.539 
to be incredibly hard difficult scratch

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:42.329 
to be incredibly hard difficult scratch
and<00:00:40.839> should<00:00:41.019> retain<00:00:41.319> its<00:00:41.559> looks<00:00:41.859> for<00:00:42.069> a<00:00:42.100> very

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:42.339 
and should retain its looks for a very

00:00:42.339 --> 00:00:44.309 
and should retain its looks for a very
long<00:00:42.550> time<00:00:42.579> in<00:00:43.269> addition<00:00:43.690> you<00:00:43.809> have<00:00:43.929> a<00:00:43.960> ceramic

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:44.319 
long time in addition you have a ceramic

00:00:44.319 --> 00:00:47.399 
long time in addition you have a ceramic
bezel<00:00:44.649> and<00:00:44.949> a<00:00:45.460> sapphire<00:00:45.879> crystal<00:00:46.329> all<00:00:46.690> with<00:00:47.350> a

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:47.409 
bezel and a sapphire crystal all with a

00:00:47.409 --> 00:00:49.110 
bezel and a sapphire crystal all with a
200<00:00:47.800> meter<00:00:47.979> rating<00:00:48.399> so<00:00:48.639> this<00:00:48.789> should<00:00:48.940> be<00:00:49.089> a

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120 
200 meter rating so this should be a

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.489 
200 meter rating so this should be a
watch<00:00:49.359> that<00:00:49.600> will<00:00:49.719> last<00:00:49.899> you<00:00:50.109> a<00:00:50.139> very<00:00:50.229> long

snap<00:01:02.440> walk<00:01:02.729> the<00:01:03.729> bracelet<00:01:04.180> is<00:01:04.360> this<00:01:04.570> very

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:04.809 
snap walk the bracelet is this very

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:08.120 
snap walk the bracelet is this very
clever<00:01:05.140> design<00:01:05.320> which<00:01:06.250> is<00:01:06.400> simply<00:01:06.790> a<00:01:06.940> spring

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
clever design which is simply a spring

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.610 
clever design which is simply a spring
the<00:01:09.130> bend<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:10.720> then<00:01:10.930> you<00:01:11.020> get<00:01:11.140> buckling

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:11.620 
the bend and then you get buckling

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.160 
the bend and then you get buckling
effect<00:01:11.740> snaps<00:01:12.640> in<00:01:12.790> place<00:01:13.000> so<00:01:13.780> you<00:01:13.870> haven't

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
effect snaps in place so you haven't

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.560 
effect snaps in place so you haven't
seen<00:01:14.410> the<00:01:15.160> deployed<00:01:15.760> effect<00:01:16.060> of<00:01:16.210> an<00:01:16.300> invisible

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:16.570 
seen the deployed effect of an invisible

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.490 
seen the deployed effect of an invisible
buckle<00:01:18.450> reasonably<00:01:19.450> low<00:01:19.570> profile<00:01:19.990> but<00:01:20.320> again

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
buckle reasonably low profile but again

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.800 
buckle reasonably low profile but again
they<00:01:20.800> won't<00:01:20.920> extend<00:01:21.310> for<00:01:21.520> a<00:01:21.550> dive<00:01:21.730> suit<00:01:21.810> but

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
they won't extend for a dive suit but

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.450 
they won't extend for a dive suit but
this<00:01:22.960> isn't<00:01:23.260> really<00:01:23.380> a<00:01:23.500> hardcore<00:01:24.010> dive<00:01:24.220> watch

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
this isn't really a hardcore dive watch

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:25.920 
this isn't really a hardcore dive watch
this<00:01:24.670> is<00:01:24.820> I<00:01:24.940> think<00:01:25.240> of<00:01:25.330> this<00:01:25.420> more<00:01:25.690> as<00:01:25.720> a

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930 
this is I think of this more as a

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:27.900 
this is I think of this more as a
beautiful<00:01:26.560> watch<00:01:26.770> that<00:01:27.130> is<00:01:27.280> durable<00:01:27.820> enough

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:27.910 
beautiful watch that is durable enough

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:30.600 
beautiful watch that is durable enough
for<00:01:28.270> just<00:01:28.720> about<00:01:28.810> any<00:01:29.050> activity<00:01:29.620> so<00:01:30.460> let's

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
for just about any activity so let's

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.570 
for just about any activity so let's
take<00:01:30.730> a<00:01:30.760> look<00:01:31.680> if<00:01:32.680> you<00:01:32.830> the<00:01:33.100> one<00:01:33.250> thing<00:01:33.400> that

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:33.580 
take a look if you the one thing that

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:34.890 
take a look if you the one thing that
really<00:01:33.760> strikes<00:01:34.120> me<00:01:34.300> about<00:01:34.360> this<00:01:34.540> watch<00:01:34.690> is

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:34.900 
really strikes me about this watch is

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.230 
really strikes me about this watch is
just<00:01:35.170> health<00:01:35.410> in<00:01:35.710> this<00:01:35.860> is<00:01:36.070> this<00:01:36.280> is<00:01:36.430> around<00:01:36.700> 11

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
just health in this is this is around 11

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.600 
just health in this is this is around 11
millimeters<00:01:37.780> it<00:01:38.170> is<00:01:38.380> incredibly<00:01:39.100> slim<00:01:39.370> for<00:01:39.580> a

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
millimeters it is incredibly slim for a

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.160 
millimeters it is incredibly slim for a
200<00:01:39.940> meter<00:01:40.090> watch<00:01:40.330> I<00:01:40.570> wish<00:01:40.750> more<00:01:40.990> of<00:01:41.080> the

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
200 meter watch I wish more of the

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:42.750 
200 meter watch I wish more of the
moment<00:01:41.500> or<00:01:41.680> this<00:01:41.860> then<00:01:42.070> be<00:01:42.250> honest<00:01:42.490> with<00:01:42.610> you

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:42.760 
moment or this then be honest with you

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.270 
moment or this then be honest with you
this<00:01:43.330> is<00:01:43.540> the<00:01:43.660> 38<00:01:44.050> millimeter<00:01:44.410> version<00:01:44.620> they

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
this is the 38 millimeter version they

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.540 
this is the 38 millimeter version they
also<00:01:45.460> make<00:01:45.910> I<00:01:46.090> believe<00:01:46.390> a<00:01:46.690> 41<00:01:47.260> so<00:01:48.130> if<00:01:48.250> you<00:01:48.340> want

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:48.550 
also make I believe a 41 so if you want

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:50.730 
also make I believe a 41 so if you want
in<00:01:48.730> a<00:01:48.790> bigger<00:01:49.000> size<00:01:49.210> it<00:01:49.450> can<00:01:49.570> be<00:01:49.659> had<00:01:49.840> the

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
in a bigger size it can be had the

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.070 
in a bigger size it can be had the
winding<00:01:51.159> on<00:01:51.250> this<00:01:51.400> is<00:01:51.580> very<00:01:52.180> very<00:01:52.480> smooth<00:01:52.900> and

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 
winding on this is very very smooth and

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.110 
winding on this is very very smooth and
light<00:01:53.260> you<00:01:53.740> can<00:01:53.890> barely<00:01:54.280> tell<00:01:54.550> it's<00:01:54.730> winding

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:55.120
