overhead press unless you're doing it
for<00:01:36.270> specific<00:01:36.689> other<00:01:36.840> reasons<00:01:37.439> I'm<00:01:37.560> not<00:01:37.590> going

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
to get it all that today but for the

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.899 
to get it all that today but for the

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
narrow grip is going to be better if

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.740 
narrow grip is going to be better if
you're<00:01:44.520> trying<00:01:44.759> to<00:01:44.850> do<00:01:45.000> it<00:01:45.119> as<00:01:45.240> a<00:01:45.270> proper

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
you're trying to do it as a proper

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.330 
you're trying to do it as a proper
compound<00:01:46.320> movement<00:01:46.799> meaning<00:01:46.920> you're<00:01:47.100> trying

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
compound movement meaning you're trying

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.880 
compound movement meaning you're trying
to<00:01:47.430> work<00:01:47.579> multiple<00:01:48.060> exercises<00:01:48.380> the<00:01:49.380> triceps

and<00:01:50.149> more<00:01:51.149> than<00:01:51.329> one<00:01:51.479> head<00:01:51.659> of<00:01:51.810> a<00:01:51.869> delt<00:01:52.159> because

and more than one head of a delt because

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.980 
and more than one head of a delt because
that's<00:01:53.340> why<00:01:53.460> we<00:01:53.640> do<00:01:53.790> compounds<00:01:54.479> for<00:01:54.689> the<00:01:54.810> most

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
that's why we do compounds for the most

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.359 
that's why we do compounds for the most
part<00:01:55.259> unless<00:01:55.409> you<00:01:55.680> need<00:01:55.770> to<00:01:55.920> kind<00:01:56.130> of<00:01:56.159> isolate

one<00:01:56.880> head<00:01:57.090> and<00:01:57.119> you're<00:01:57.329> doing<00:01:57.450> it<00:01:57.659> as<00:01:57.780> a<00:01:57.810> sports

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
one head and you're doing it as a sports

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.410 
one head and you're doing it as a sports
specific<00:01:58.680> movement<00:01:59.070> like<00:01:59.189> a<00:01:59.250> car<00:01:59.909> club<00:02:00.090> press

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
specific movement like a car club press

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.780 
specific movement like a car club press
which<00:02:01.259> is<00:02:01.380> very<00:02:01.619> very<00:02:01.920> wide<00:02:02.130> grip<00:02:02.369> behind<00:02:02.549> the

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
which is very very wide grip behind the

people<00:02:05.369> don't<00:02:05.729> necessarily<00:02:05.820> need<00:02:06.479> that

people don't necessarily need that

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.260 
people don't necessarily need that
lift<00:02:07.110> so<00:02:07.650> that's<00:02:07.830> a<00:02:07.920> very<00:02:08.070> sport<00:02:08.520> specific<00:02:08.759> to

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
lift so that's a very sport specific to

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.350 
lift so that's a very sport specific to
their<00:02:09.420> sport<00:02:09.840> and<00:02:10.310> if<00:02:11.310> not<00:02:11.460> say<00:02:11.700> can't<00:02:12.000> be<00:02:12.060> used

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
their sport and if not say can't be used

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.240 
their sport and if not say can't be used
by<00:02:12.510> them<00:02:12.720> it<00:02:12.930> is<00:02:13.080> a<00:02:13.110> different<00:02:13.560> animal<00:02:13.890> so<00:02:14.070> for

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
by them it is a different animal so for

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.030 
by them it is a different animal so for
different<00:02:14.370> purpose<00:02:14.990> now<00:02:15.990> I<00:02:16.320> prefer<00:02:16.740> the

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
different purpose now I prefer the

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.180 
different purpose now I prefer the
narrower<00:02:17.400> grip<00:02:18.620> because<00:02:19.620> of<00:02:19.770> the<00:02:19.860> shearing

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
narrower grip because of the shearing

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.550 
narrower grip because of the shearing
stresses<00:02:20.550> upon<00:02:20.880> the<00:02:21.030> shoulders<00:02:21.450> and<00:02:21.840> again

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
stresses upon the shoulders and again

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.560 
stresses upon the shoulders and again
tricep<00:02:22.830> recruitment<00:02:23.550> now<00:02:23.970> the<00:02:24.090> problem<00:02:24.450> you

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
tricep recruitment now the problem you

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.390 
tricep recruitment now the problem you
run<00:02:24.720> into<00:02:24.780> when<00:02:25.350> you're<00:02:25.470> using<00:02:25.650> a<00:02:25.830> barbell<00:02:26.280> and

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
run into when you're using a barbell and

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.560 
run into when you're using a barbell and
you're<00:02:26.520> doing<00:02:26.640> this<00:02:26.790> overhand<00:02:27.300> grip

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
you're doing this overhand grip

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.140 
you're doing this overhand grip
I<00:02:27.870> like<00:02:28.710> the<00:02:28.860> barbell<00:02:29.220> but<00:02:29.340> I<00:02:29.430> will<00:02:29.700> say<00:02:29.940> that

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
I like the barbell but I will say that

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.970 
I like the barbell but I will say that
if<00:02:30.240> you're<00:02:30.360> going<00:02:30.510> to<00:02:30.630> use<00:02:30.840> a<00:02:31.140> thumbs<00:02:31.560> over

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
if you're going to use a thumbs over

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.510 
if you're going to use a thumbs over
grip<00:02:32.540> dumbbells<00:02:33.540> may<00:02:33.930> be<00:02:33.990> safer<00:02:34.710> once<00:02:35.100> you<00:02:35.310> get

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
grip dumbbells may be safer once you get

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.610 
grip dumbbells may be safer once you get
them<00:02:35.700> safely<00:02:36.180> into<00:02:36.420> position<00:02:36.960> I<00:02:37.170> think<00:02:37.440> it's

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
them safely into position I think it's

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.199 
them safely into position I think it's
getting<00:02:37.860> them<00:02:38.100> into<00:02:38.250> position<00:02:38.670> that<00:02:38.880> causes

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
getting them into position that causes

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:41.300 
getting them into position that causes
people<00:02:39.360> to<00:02:39.540> get<00:02:39.840> injured<00:02:40.230> so<00:02:40.770> I<00:02:40.800> don't<00:02:40.890> like<00:02:41.160> no

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
people to get injured so I don't like no

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.120 
people to get injured so I don't like no
bells<00:02:41.550> and<00:02:41.959> that's<00:02:42.959> because<00:02:43.350> your<00:02:43.800> hands<00:02:44.040> are

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
bells and that's because your hands are

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.980 
bells and that's because your hands are
locked<00:02:44.370> into<00:02:44.610> place<00:02:44.820> and<00:02:45.240> you're<00:02:45.480> locked<00:02:45.690> into

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
locked into place and you're locked into

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.650 
locked into place and you're locked into
it<00:02:46.140> unnatural<00:02:46.890> movement<00:02:47.310> and<00:02:47.550> you'll<00:02:48.270> notice

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
it unnatural movement and you'll notice

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.390 
it unnatural movement and you'll notice
that<00:02:48.810> it's<00:02:48.959> very<00:02:49.020> hard<00:02:49.590> to<00:02:49.680> keep<00:02:49.890> your<00:02:50.070> elbows

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
that it's very hard to keep your elbows

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.430 
that it's very hard to keep your elbows
down<00:02:50.580> like<00:02:50.760> I'm<00:02:50.910> straining<00:02:51.900> out<00:02:52.020> to<00:02:52.170> flare

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
down like I'm straining out to flare

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.040 
down like I'm straining out to flare
them<00:02:52.650> so<00:02:52.800> you<00:02:52.860> come<00:02:53.160> down<00:02:53.430> it's<00:02:54.090> very<00:02:54.270> very

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
them so you come down it's very very

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.680 
them so you come down it's very very
hard<00:02:55.470> to<00:02:55.650> touch<00:02:55.800> your<00:02:56.040> chest<00:02:56.070> this<00:02:56.580> way<00:02:56.820> unless

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
hard to touch your chest this way unless

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:58.970 
hard to touch your chest this way unless
you<00:02:57.840> have<00:02:57.930> a<00:02:57.990> lot<00:02:58.110> of<00:02:58.140> weight<00:02:58.320> to<00:02:58.440> push<00:02:58.620> it<00:02:58.770> down

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
you have a lot of weight to push it down

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.070 
you have a lot of weight to push it down
it<00:02:59.250> puts<00:02:59.459> shearing<00:03:00.240> stress<00:03:00.480> on<00:03:00.630> the<00:03:00.720> shoulders

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
it puts shearing stress on the shoulders

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.470 
it puts shearing stress on the shoulders
doing<00:03:01.350> so<00:03:01.590> but<00:03:02.490> when<00:03:02.640> you<00:03:02.730> come<00:03:03.030> up<00:03:03.209> your

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
doing so but when you come up your

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.410 
doing so but when you come up your
elbows<00:03:03.990> flare<00:03:04.560> out<00:03:04.740> almost<00:03:04.950> immediately<00:03:05.420> and

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
elbows flare out almost immediately and

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:07.940 
elbows flare out almost immediately and
you'll<00:03:06.840> notice<00:03:07.110> that<00:03:07.200> it's<00:03:07.380> hard<00:03:07.680> to<00:03:07.800> keep

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
you'll notice that it's hard to keep

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.970 
you'll notice that it's hard to keep
them<00:03:08.190> in<00:03:08.459> which<00:03:09.180> puts<00:03:09.600> the<00:03:10.170> shearing<00:03:10.620> stress

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
them in which puts the shearing stress

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.400 
them in which puts the shearing stress
upon<00:03:11.280> the<00:03:11.400> shoulders<00:03:11.959> because<00:03:12.959> of<00:03:13.140> the<00:03:13.200> way<00:03:13.290> it

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
upon the shoulders because of the way it

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.310 
upon the shoulders because of the way it
locks<00:03:13.560> your<00:03:13.769> wrists<00:03:14.100> and<00:03:14.750> it<00:03:15.750> makes<00:03:16.140> it

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
locks your wrists and it makes it

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.229 
locks your wrists and it makes it
difficult<00:03:16.530> to<00:03:16.950> recruit<00:03:17.250> the<00:03:17.489> triceps<00:03:18.000> and

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
difficult to recruit the triceps and

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:19.460 
difficult to recruit the triceps and
turn<00:03:18.360> it<00:03:18.480> into<00:03:18.630> a<00:03:18.750> true<00:03:19.019> press<00:03:19.290> without

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
turn it into a true press without

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.940 
turn it into a true press without
flaring<00:03:20.190> and<00:03:20.570> it<00:03:21.570> also<00:03:21.750> puts<00:03:22.290> the<00:03:22.440> shearing

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
flaring and it also puts the shearing

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.800 
flaring and it also puts the shearing
stress<00:03:23.310> on<00:03:23.489> your<00:03:23.670> wrist<00:03:23.970> so<00:03:24.150> it<00:03:24.239> tends<00:03:24.510> to<00:03:24.630> hurt

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
stress on your wrist so it tends to hurt

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.470 
stress on your wrist so it tends to hurt
your<00:03:25.050> wrists<00:03:25.440> and<00:03:25.590> it<00:03:26.519> leads<00:03:26.760> to<00:03:26.880> risk<00:03:27.239> of

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
your wrists and it leads to risk of

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.390 
your wrists and it leads to risk of
rotator<00:03:28.320> cuff<00:03:28.560> injury<00:03:28.890> there<00:03:29.100> due<00:03:29.280> to<00:03:29.310> the

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
rotator cuff injury there due to the

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.920 
rotator cuff injury there due to the
flaring<00:03:30.000> and<00:03:30.120> then<00:03:30.209> here's<00:03:30.420> the<00:03:30.630> other<00:03:30.690> thing

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
flaring and then here's the other thing

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.170 
flaring and then here's the other thing
to<00:03:31.019> look<00:03:31.140> at<00:03:31.320> you<00:03:31.500> come<00:03:31.680> down<00:03:31.860> here<00:03:32.070> you<00:03:32.370> notice

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
to look at you come down here you notice

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.270 
to look at you come down here you notice
how<00:03:33.450> much<00:03:33.600> rotational<00:03:34.380> stress<00:03:34.739> I'm<00:03:34.920> getting<00:03:35.220> I

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
how much rotational stress I'm getting I

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.250 
how much rotational stress I'm getting I
haven't<00:03:35.400> even<00:03:35.580> touched<00:03:35.760> my<00:03:35.970> chest<00:03:36.239> yet<00:03:36.450> but

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
haven't even touched my chest yet but

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:42.190 
haven't even touched my chest yet but
when<00:03:37.410> you<00:03:37.530> do<00:03:37.790> this<00:03:38.790> grip<00:03:39.650> this<00:03:40.650> false<00:03:41.340> grip

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
when you do this grip this false grip

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.840 
when you do this grip this false grip
with<00:03:43.200> the<00:03:43.380> wrist<00:03:43.890> back<00:03:44.310> a<00:03:44.340> little<00:03:44.610> bit<00:03:44.790> you

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
with the wrist back a little bit you

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.910 
with the wrist back a little bit you
actually<00:03:45.480> find<00:03:45.780> believe<00:03:46.380> it<00:03:46.500> or<00:03:46.590> not<00:03:46.650> that<00:03:46.800> it

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
actually find believe it or not that it

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.530 
actually find believe it or not that it
feels<00:03:47.100> better<00:03:47.459> on<00:03:47.610> your<00:03:47.880> wrist<00:03:48.239> when<00:03:48.390> you're

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
feels better on your wrist when you're

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:49.880 
feels better on your wrist when you're
going<00:03:48.840> heavy<00:03:49.080> not<00:03:49.380> because<00:03:49.590> of<00:03:49.620> the<00:03:49.739> way<00:03:49.830> the

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
going heavy not because of the way the

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.289 
going heavy not because of the way the
bottom<00:03:50.190> ended<00:03:50.519> because<00:03:50.790> when<00:03:50.970> you're<00:03:51.060> going

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
bottom ended because when you're going

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:54.350 
bottom ended because when you're going
up<00:03:51.560> you<00:03:52.560> can<00:03:52.680> keep<00:03:52.890> the<00:03:53.040> elbows<00:03:53.340> anymore<00:03:53.760> and

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
up you can keep the elbows anymore and

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.759 
up you can keep the elbows anymore and
what<00:03:54.510> that<00:03:54.660> does<00:03:54.840> you'll<00:03:55.110> notice<00:03:55.320> when<00:03:55.470> I<00:03:55.500> come

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
what that does you'll notice when I come

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:59.150 
what that does you'll notice when I come
down<00:03:55.799> I<00:03:56.430> can<00:03:56.850> get<00:03:57.090> a<00:03:57.120> deeper<00:03:57.630> stretch<00:03:58.160> with

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
down I can get a deeper stretch with

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.610 
down I can get a deeper stretch with
less<00:03:59.580> rotational<00:04:00.570> stress<00:04:01.049> because<00:04:01.410> of<00:04:01.530> the

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
less rotational stress because of the

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.600 
less rotational stress because of the
bar<00:04:01.799> pulled<00:04:02.100> further<00:04:02.310> back<00:04:02.989> there's<00:04:03.989> less

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:04.610 
bar pulled further back there's less

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:07.009 
bar pulled further back there's less
rotational<00:04:05.610> shearing<00:04:06.030> force<00:04:06.299> put<00:04:06.570> up<00:04:06.660> on<00:04:06.810> the

rotational shearing force put up on the
rotator<00:04:07.380> cuffs<00:04:07.680> so<00:04:08.549> the<00:04:08.700> same<00:04:08.910> amount<00:04:09.090> of

rotator cuffs so the same amount of
weight<00:04:09.660> you<00:04:09.989> can<00:04:10.110> get<00:04:10.230> that<00:04:10.350> deep<00:04:10.590> stretch<00:04:10.769> at

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
weight you can get that deep stretch at

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:13.190 
weight you can get that deep stretch at
the<00:04:11.250> bottom<00:04:11.580> to<00:04:12.120> get<00:04:12.269> that<00:04:12.510> interior<00:04:12.780> don't

even the upper test working a little
better

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
better

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.289 
better
without<00:04:17.560> putting<00:04:17.920> quite<00:04:18.549> as<00:04:18.760> much<00:04:18.940> shearing

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299

stress on the rotator cuff and then when

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.010 
stress on the rotator cuff and then when
you<00:04:22.480> come<00:04:22.720> up<00:04:22.900> it's<00:04:23.080> a<00:04:23.139> more<00:04:23.320> natural<00:04:23.350> bar<00:04:23.980> path

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
you come up it's a more natural bar path

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.240 
you come up it's a more natural bar path
you<00:04:26.020> notice<00:04:26.230> there's<00:04:26.380> more<00:04:26.530> of<00:04:26.590> an<00:04:26.680> arc<00:04:26.889> to<00:04:27.100> it

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
you notice there's more of an arc to it

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:28.740 
you notice there's more of an arc to it
and<00:04:27.400> you<00:04:27.490> can<00:04:27.610> get<00:04:27.700> the<00:04:27.820> triceps<00:04:28.300> into<00:04:28.540> it<00:04:28.630> more

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
and you can get the triceps into it more

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.830 
and you can get the triceps into it more
whereas<00:04:29.050> and<00:04:29.200> down<00:04:29.320> here<00:04:29.889> it<00:04:30.270> isn't<00:04:31.270> quite<00:04:31.480> as

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
whereas and down here it isn't quite as

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.830 
whereas and down here it isn't quite as
natural<00:04:32.050> of<00:04:32.380> a<00:04:32.440> bar<00:04:32.680> path<00:04:33.180> and<00:04:34.180> it's<00:04:34.540> more<00:04:34.720> of<00:04:34.780> a

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
natural of a bar path and it's more of a

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.810 
natural of a bar path and it's more of a
straight<00:04:35.110> line<00:04:35.290> rather<00:04:35.470> than<00:04:35.710> an<00:04:35.889> arc<00:04:36.160> and<00:04:36.430> you

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:36.820 
straight line rather than an arc and you

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.300 
straight line rather than an arc and you
know<00:04:36.940> you'll<00:04:37.270> notice<00:04:37.510> from<00:04:37.630> the<00:04:37.810> front<00:04:38.310> notice

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
know you'll notice from the front notice

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:41.129 
know you'll notice from the front notice
how<00:04:39.400> easy<00:04:39.610> it<00:04:39.790> is<00:04:39.850> to<00:04:40.030> keep<00:04:40.150> the<00:04:40.300> elbows<00:04:40.660> in<00:04:40.870> and

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:41.139 
how easy it is to keep the elbows in and

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:44.220 
how easy it is to keep the elbows in and
that<00:04:41.950> lets<00:04:42.220> you<00:04:42.520> use<00:04:42.880> a<00:04:43.419> very<00:04:43.720> heavy<00:04:44.020> weight

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:44.230 
that lets you use a very heavy weight

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:45.420 
that lets you use a very heavy weight
out<00:04:44.380> of<00:04:44.410> the<00:04:44.530> bottom<00:04:44.590> because<00:04:45.160> you're<00:04:45.310> in<00:04:45.400> a

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430 
out of the bottom because you're in a

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.100 
out of the bottom because you're in a
proper<00:04:45.820> stretch<00:04:46.090> position<00:04:46.630> you<00:04:46.750> can<00:04:46.870> use<00:04:46.990> that

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
proper stretch position you can use that

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.740 
proper stretch position you can use that
stretch<00:04:47.410> reflex<00:04:47.890> off<00:04:48.270> of<00:04:49.270> the<00:04:49.360> anterior

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:49.750 
stretch reflex off of the anterior

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:52.290 
stretch reflex off of the anterior
deltoids<00:04:50.380> and<00:04:50.440> the<00:04:50.560> upper<00:04:50.770> pecs<00:04:51.070> to<00:04:52.000> get<00:04:52.180> it

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.300 
deltoids and the upper pecs to get it

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:53.850 
deltoids and the upper pecs to get it
started<00:04:52.570> so<00:04:52.870> you<00:04:52.960> get<00:04:53.169> more<00:04:53.320> recruitment

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
started so you get more recruitment

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.020 
started so you get more recruitment
there<00:04:53.980> and<00:04:54.100> it<00:04:54.160> lets<00:04:54.340> you<00:04:54.460> really<00:04:54.790> get<00:04:54.910> the

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.030 
there and it lets you really get the

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:57.750 
there and it lets you really get the
tricep<00:04:55.720> into<00:04:56.200> it<00:04:56.350> a<00:04:56.500> lot<00:04:56.770> better<00:04:57.070> right<00:04:57.490> about

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:57.760 
tricep into it a lot better right about

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:00.390 
tricep into it a lot better right about
here<00:04:58.320> because<00:04:59.320> the<00:04:59.590> elbows<00:04:59.890> are<00:05:00.010> in<00:05:00.160> and<00:05:00.340> you

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.400 
here because the elbows are in and you

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.700 
here because the elbows are in and you
can<00:05:00.550> power<00:05:00.820> it<00:05:00.940> up<00:05:01.120> harder<00:05:01.570> so<00:05:02.200> what<00:05:02.410> it<00:05:02.500> lets

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:02.710 
can power it up harder so what it lets

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:04.320 
can power it up harder so what it lets
you<00:05:02.860> do<00:05:03.070> once<00:05:03.400> you<00:05:03.520> get<00:05:03.669> used<00:05:03.850> to<00:05:03.940> doing<00:05:04.000> the

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:04.330 
you do once you get used to doing the

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.120 
you do once you get used to doing the
movement<00:05:04.750> it<00:05:04.870> will<00:05:04.960> let<00:05:05.140> you<00:05:05.290> use<00:05:05.320> more<00:05:05.800> weight

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:06.130 
movement it will let you use more weight

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:08.670 
movement it will let you use more weight
because<00:05:06.370> a<00:05:06.550> more<00:05:06.760> tricep<00:05:07.300> involvement<00:05:07.870> and<00:05:08.530> on

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:08.680 
because a more tricep involvement and on

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.590 
because a more tricep involvement and on
a<00:05:08.710> compound<00:05:09.280> movement<00:05:09.460> more<00:05:09.820> overall<00:05:10.180> weight

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:10.600 
a compound movement more overall weight

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.570 
a compound movement more overall weight
due<00:05:10.870> to<00:05:11.020> something<00:05:11.229> like<00:05:11.530> a<00:05:11.560> secondary<00:05:12.160> mover

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:12.580 
due to something like a secondary mover

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.790 
due to something like a secondary mover
being<00:05:12.850> able<00:05:12.970> to<00:05:13.090> generate<00:05:13.389> more<00:05:13.540> force<00:05:13.800> will

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.800 
being able to generate more force will

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.420 
being able to generate more force will
let<00:05:14.979> you<00:05:15.100> put<00:05:15.310> more<00:05:16.889> force<00:05:17.889> and<00:05:18.220> fiber

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:18.430 
let you put more force and fiber

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:19.830 
let you put more force and fiber
recruitment<00:05:19.000> on<00:05:19.060> the<00:05:19.180> other<00:05:19.360> muscles<00:05:19.750> you're

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.370 
recruitment on the other muscles you're
trying<00:05:20.050> to<00:05:20.140> work<00:05:20.260> such<00:05:20.470> as<00:05:20.500> the<00:05:20.710> deltoids<00:05:22.380> but

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:23.380 
trying to work such as the deltoids but

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:26.340 
trying to work such as the deltoids but
it<00:05:23.500> lets<00:05:23.710> you<00:05:23.860> do<00:05:24.100> so<00:05:24.400> without<00:05:25.060> this<00:05:25.810> much<00:05:26.110> risk

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:26.350 
it lets you do so without this much risk

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:28.740 
it lets you do so without this much risk
of<00:05:26.500> injury<00:05:26.860> so<00:05:27.100> you're<00:05:27.340> looking<00:05:27.490> at<00:05:27.850> the

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:28.750 
of injury so you're looking at the

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:31.050 
of injury so you're looking at the
ability<00:05:29.200> to<00:05:29.229> use<00:05:29.680> a<00:05:29.979> slightly<00:05:30.280> heavier<00:05:30.550> weight

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:31.060 
ability to use a slightly heavier weight

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:34.050 
ability to use a slightly heavier weight
once<00:05:31.300> you<00:05:31.390> get<00:05:31.510> the<00:05:31.600> technique<00:05:31.960> down<00:05:33.060> with

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:34.060 
once you get the technique down with

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.000 
once you get the technique down with
less<00:05:34.330> risk<00:05:34.660> of<00:05:34.930> damaging<00:05:35.380> the<00:05:35.500> wrist<00:05:35.770> of<00:05:35.979> the

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:36.010 
less risk of damaging the wrist of the

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:39.719 
less risk of damaging the wrist of the
rotator<00:05:36.430> cuffs<00:05:36.729> so<00:05:37.300> that<00:05:37.479> being<00:05:37.720> said<00:05:38.729> more

00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:39.729 
rotator cuffs so that being said more

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:43.110 
rotator cuffs so that being said more
weight<00:05:40.110> less<00:05:41.110> injury<00:05:41.500> this<00:05:42.310> is<00:05:42.370> an<00:05:42.610> all-around

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:43.120 
weight less injury this is an all-around

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.409 
weight less injury this is an all-around
win<00:05:43.390> situation<00:05:43.630> and<00:05:44.910> that<00:05:45.910> is<00:05:46.060> why<00:05:46.390> I

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:46.419 
win situation and that is why I

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:48.270 
win situation and that is why I
recommend<00:05:47.140> people<00:05:47.260> doing<00:05:47.650> it<00:05:47.770> that<00:05:47.919> way<00:05:48.100> it's

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:48.280 
recommend people doing it that way it's

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:50.010 
recommend people doing it that way it's
it's<00:05:48.520> a<00:05:48.640> very<00:05:49.000> minor<00:05:49.270> difference<00:05:49.720> but<00:05:49.840> you'll

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:50.020 
it's a very minor difference but you'll

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:51.810 
it's a very minor difference but you'll
notice<00:05:50.350> the<00:05:50.530> bar<00:05:50.740> path<00:05:51.010> and<00:05:51.310> the<00:05:51.400> shoulder

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:51.820 
notice the bar path and the shoulder

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:53.730 
notice the bar path and the shoulder
rotation<00:05:52.330> is<00:05:52.450> completely<00:05:53.289> different<00:05:53.680> when

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:53.740 
rotation is completely different when

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:56.250 
rotation is completely different when
you<00:05:53.860> change<00:05:54.130> that<00:05:54.310> grip<00:05:54.780> whereas<00:05:55.780> you<00:05:55.960> can<00:05:56.110> get

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:56.260 
you change that grip whereas you can get

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.170 
you change that grip whereas you can get
around<00:05:56.620> that<00:05:56.830> with<00:05:57.160> dumbbells<00:05:57.580> because<00:05:57.789> they

00:05:58.170 --> 00:05:58.180 
around that with dumbbells because they

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:59.640 
around that with dumbbells because they
spin<00:05:58.539> freely<00:05:58.870> and<00:05:59.110> you<00:05:59.169> want<00:05:59.380> a<00:05:59.440> proper

00:05:59.640 --> 00:05:59.650 
spin freely and you want a proper

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:01.290 
spin freely and you want a proper
shoulder<00:06:00.070> press<00:06:00.430> for<00:06:00.640> with<00:06:01.000> a<00:06:01.030> dumbbell

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:01.300 
shoulder press for with a dumbbell

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.080 
shoulder press for with a dumbbell
you're<00:06:01.990> not<00:06:02.140> actually<00:06:02.380> completely<00:06:03.280> running<00:06:03.940> a

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:04.090 
you're not actually completely running a

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:05.279 
you're not actually completely running a
straight<00:06:04.330> line<00:06:04.510> between<00:06:04.690> your<00:06:04.930> palms<00:06:05.110> you

00:06:05.279 --> 00:06:05.289 
straight line between your palms you

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:06.870 
straight line between your palms you
actually<00:06:05.680> have<00:06:05.800> them<00:06:05.979> slightly<00:06:06.220> pronated

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:06.880 
actually have them slightly pronated

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.029 
actually have them slightly pronated
because<00:06:07.600> that<00:06:07.750> is<00:06:07.900> the<00:06:08.020> natural<00:06:08.229> position<00:06:08.620> for

00:06:09.029 --> 00:06:09.039 
because that is the natural position for

00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:12.060 
because that is the natural position for
a<00:06:09.070> proper<00:06:09.460> arm<00:06:09.789> path<00:06:10.030> with<00:06:10.270> them<00:06:10.919> but<00:06:11.919> with<00:06:12.039> a

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:12.070 
a proper arm path with them but with a

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:14.219 
a proper arm path with them but with a
dumbbell<00:06:12.340> being<00:06:12.700> fixed<00:06:13.300> you'll<00:06:13.750> find<00:06:14.080> that

00:06:14.219 --> 00:06:14.229 
dumbbell being fixed you'll find that

00:06:14.229 --> 00:06:16.710 
dumbbell being fixed you'll find that
your<00:06:14.470> natural<00:06:15.400> bar<00:06:15.610> path<00:06:15.880> will<00:06:16.210> come<00:06:16.419> if<00:06:16.600> you

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:16.720 
your natural bar path will come if you

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.320 
your natural bar path will come if you
do<00:06:16.960> that<00:06:17.169> false<00:06:17.410> grip<00:06:17.820> just<00:06:18.820> rack<00:06:19.090> back

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:19.330 
do that false grip just rack back

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:20.210 
do that false grip just rack back
slightly

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:20.220 
slightly

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:22.529 
slightly
alright<00:06:21.220> guys<00:06:21.310> that's<00:06:21.640> really<00:06:21.910> all<00:06:22.180> I<00:06:22.210> have<00:06:22.450> to
