thanks for having me so give me a demo
so<00:00:25.230> basically<00:00:25.650> Volk<00:00:26.310> ray<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.849> first<00:00:27.090> step<00:00:27.330> is

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
so basically Volk ray the first step is

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.089 
so basically Volk ray the first step is
setting<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:27.960> language<00:00:28.289> of<00:00:28.439> yourself<00:00:28.800> and<00:00:29.010> the

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
setting the language of yourself and the

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:29.990 
setting the language of yourself and the
person<00:00:29.220> you're<00:00:29.429> speaking<00:00:29.640> with

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
person you're speaking with

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.700 
person you're speaking with
and<00:00:30.269> if<00:00:30.480> example<00:00:30.929> all<00:00:31.080> say<00:00:31.320> something<00:00:31.619> in

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
and if example all say something in

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.190 
and if example all say something in
German<00:00:31.859> and<00:00:32.250> it'll<00:00:32.940> translate<00:00:33.210> into<00:00:33.480> English

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
German and it'll translate into English

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.290 
German and it'll translate into English
okay<00:00:34.620> and<00:00:35.040> so<00:00:35.250> for<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.520> iPhone<00:00:35.790> version<00:00:36.030> you

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
okay and so for the iPhone version you

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.270 
okay and so for the iPhone version you
do<00:00:36.450> a<00:00:36.480> rotation<00:00:36.690> you<00:00:37.290> turn<00:00:37.500> upside<00:00:37.800> down<00:00:37.829> any

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
do a rotation you turn upside down any

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.049 
do a rotation you turn upside down any
wait<00:00:38.399> for<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.610> microphone<00:00:38.969> to<00:00:39.059> up<00:00:39.120> here

00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:41.059 
wait for the microphone to up here

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:47.209 
wait for the microphone to up here
gutentag<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.570> gate<00:00:42.780> s<00:00:43.020> Enon<00:00:45.860> you<00:00:46.860> check<00:00:47.100> to

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
gutentag the gate s Enon you check to

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.069 
gutentag the gate s Enon you check to
see<00:00:47.370> that<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.520> text<00:00:47.850> is<00:00:47.969> correct<00:00:48.300> and<00:00:48.570> then

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
see that the text is correct and then

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.240 
see that the text is correct and then
you<00:00:49.200> simply<00:00:49.350> rotate<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.829> person<00:00:50.160> you're

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
you simply rotate the person you're

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.630 
you simply rotate the person you're
talking<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:51.770> for<00:00:52.770> that<00:00:52.829> person<00:00:53.160> to<00:00:53.219> respond

talking to for that person to respond

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:54.979 
talking to for that person to respond
you<00:00:53.820> just<00:00:54.000> rotate<00:00:54.300> it<00:00:54.329> down<00:00:54.539> and<00:00:54.690> wait<00:00:54.780> for<00:00:54.840> the

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
you just rotate it down and wait for the

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.700 
you just rotate it down and wait for the
microphone<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.379> appear<00:00:56.750> I'm<00:00:57.750> fine<00:00:58.170> thanks<00:00:58.649> for

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
microphone to appear I'm fine thanks for

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.900 
microphone to appear I'm fine thanks for
asking<00:00:58.859> how<00:00:59.579> are<00:00:59.760> you<00:00:59.850> today<00:01:01.699> you<00:01:02.699> check<00:01:02.879> that

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
asking how are you today you check that

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.939 
asking how are you today you check that
it's<00:01:03.180> correct<00:01:03.260> and<00:01:04.260> rotated<00:01:04.650> back<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:04.860> the

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
it's correct and rotated back to the

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.179 
it's correct and rotated back to the
district<00:01:05.720> just<00:01:06.720> so<00:01:07.470> that's<00:01:07.560> as<00:01:07.740> simple<00:01:08.040> as

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
district just so that's as simple as

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.910 
district just so that's as simple as
record<00:01:08.790> review<00:01:09.240> and<00:01:09.420> translate<00:01:09.869> seems<00:01:10.740> pretty

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
record review and translate seems pretty

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.590 
record review and translate seems pretty
seamless<00:01:11.460> what's<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.760> technology<00:01:12.420> that's

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
seamless what's the technology that's

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.480 
seamless what's the technology that's
going<00:01:13.020> on<00:01:13.229> in<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.470> background<00:01:13.680> to<00:01:14.220> give<00:01:14.369> us

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
going on in the background to give us

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.340 
going on in the background to give us
that<00:01:14.670> experience<00:01:15.210> so<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.630> first<00:01:15.869> step<00:01:16.140> is

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
that experience so the first step is

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.800 
that experience so the first step is
converting<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:16.920> users<00:01:17.189> voice<00:01:17.430> into<00:01:18.210> text<00:01:18.240> and

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
converting the users voice into text and

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.600 
converting the users voice into text and
for<00:01:19.350> that<00:01:19.470> we're<00:01:19.650> using<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:19.979> same<00:01:20.130> technology

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
for that we're using the same technology

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.179 
for that we're using the same technology
that<00:01:20.640> powers<00:01:20.909> Siri<00:01:21.990> it's<00:01:22.350> powered<00:01:22.710> by<00:01:22.799> nuance

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
that powers Siri it's powered by nuance

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.320 
that powers Siri it's powered by nuance
and<00:01:23.490> they<00:01:24.420> currently<00:01:24.600> have<00:01:24.930> 23<00:01:25.500> languages

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330 
and they currently have 23 languages

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.819 
and they currently have 23 languages
once<00:01:27.330> we<00:01:27.450> have<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.720> text<00:01:28.080> then<00:01:28.380> we<00:01:28.500> use<00:01:28.650> our

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
once we have the text then we use our

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.580 
once we have the text then we use our
own<00:01:28.950> hybrid<00:01:29.250> translation<00:01:30.030> we<00:01:30.869> actually<00:01:31.350> check

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
own hybrid translation we actually check

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.319 
own hybrid translation we actually check
to<00:01:31.619> see<00:01:31.950> if<00:01:32.250> we<00:01:32.460> already<00:01:32.640> have<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:32.909> translation

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
to see if we already have a translation

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.690 
to see if we already have a translation
that's<00:01:33.630> more<00:01:34.170> appropriate<00:01:34.350> we<00:01:35.220> provide<00:01:35.549> to

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
that's more appropriate we provide to

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.399 
that's more appropriate we provide to
the<00:01:35.790> user<00:01:35.970> if<00:01:36.270> we<00:01:36.420> don't<00:01:36.689> then<00:01:37.020> we<00:01:37.110> can<00:01:37.259> use

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
the user if we don't then we can use

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:38.800 
the user if we don't then we can use
something<00:01:37.619> like<00:01:37.770> a<00:01:37.920> machine<00:01:38.280> translation

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
something like a machine translation

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.359 
something like a machine translation
essentially<00:01:39.810> we<00:01:39.960> find<00:01:40.590> a<00:01:40.860> good<00:01:41.040> answer<00:01:41.250> for

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
essentially we find a good answer for

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.190 
essentially we find a good answer for
the<00:01:41.610> user<00:01:41.759> once<00:01:42.570> you<00:01:42.659> have<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:42.899> translation

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
the user once you have the translation

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.499 
the user once you have the translation
we<00:01:43.710> then<00:01:43.860> convert<00:01:44.070> it<00:01:44.340> back<00:01:44.490> into<00:01:44.729> audio<00:01:45.149> using

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
we then convert it back into audio using

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.870 
we then convert it back into audio using
a<00:01:45.930> company<00:01:46.530> called<00:01:46.710> Ice<00:01:46.920> Beach<00:01:47.189> they<00:01:47.700> have<00:01:47.790> the

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
a company called Ice Beach they have the

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.539 
a company called Ice Beach they have the
most<00:01:48.060> human-like<00:01:48.450> voices<00:01:48.960> we've<00:01:49.110> found<00:01:49.549> so

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
most human-like voices we've found so

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.010 
most human-like voices we've found so
you're<00:01:50.640> taking<00:01:50.909> advantage<00:01:51.090> of<00:01:51.390> technologies

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
you're taking advantage of technologies

proprietary<00:01:57.810> technology<00:01:58.439> then<00:01:58.619> so<00:01:58.950> we<00:01:59.340> have

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
proprietary technology then so we have

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.359 
proprietary technology then so we have
two<00:01:59.700> main<00:01:59.939> focuses<00:02:00.509> one<00:02:01.140> is<00:02:01.380> on<00:02:01.560> making<00:02:01.829> an<00:02:02.280> a

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
two main focuses one is on making an a

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.819 
two main focuses one is on making an a
user<00:02:02.549> experience<00:02:02.759> that<00:02:03.509> is<00:02:03.869> not<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.469> focal

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
user experience that is not the focal

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.920 
user experience that is not the focal
point<00:02:05.040> of<00:02:05.219> a<00:02:05.340> conversation<00:02:06.000> we<00:02:06.600> want<00:02:06.840> the

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
point of a conversation we want the

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.960 
point of a conversation we want the
conversation<00:02:07.140> to<00:02:07.590> flow<00:02:07.770> and<00:02:08.190> we<00:02:08.700> don't<00:02:08.819> want

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
conversation to flow and we don't want

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.339 
conversation to flow and we don't want
you<00:02:09.030> to<00:02:09.119> be<00:02:09.239> tapping<00:02:09.450> on<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:09.810> screen<00:02:09.899> and

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
you to be tapping on the screen and

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:11.530 
you to be tapping on the screen and
focused<00:02:10.739> on<00:02:10.830> the<00:02:10.950> app

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
focused on the app

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.449 
focused on the app
the<00:02:11.989> second<00:02:12.409> focus<00:02:12.920> is<00:02:13.069> on<00:02:13.220> making

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
the second focus is on making

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:15.009 
the second focus is on making
translation<00:02:14.090> technology<00:02:14.510> that<00:02:14.659> gets<00:02:14.750> better

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:15.019 
translation technology that gets better

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:17.530 
translation technology that gets better
over<00:02:15.200> time<00:02:15.530> and<00:02:16.340> so<00:02:16.519> we<00:02:16.640> have<00:02:16.760> we're<00:02:17.239> using<00:02:17.420> a

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
over time and so we have we're using a

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.390 
over time and so we have we're using a
crowdsourcing<00:02:18.110> model<00:02:18.590> where<00:02:18.739> essentially<00:02:19.190> if

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
crowdsourcing model where essentially if

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.220 
crowdsourcing model where essentially if
the<00:02:19.640> user<00:02:19.940> finds<00:02:20.269> something<00:02:20.629> that's<00:02:20.780> bad<00:02:21.019> with

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
the user finds something that's bad with

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:22.390 
the user finds something that's bad with
a<00:02:21.260> translation<00:02:21.769> that<00:02:21.799> can<00:02:22.069> provide<00:02:22.340> a

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
a translation that can provide a

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.160 
a translation that can provide a
suggestion<00:02:22.849> like<00:02:23.060> it's<00:02:23.330> also<00:02:23.569> we<00:02:23.959> hire

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
suggestion like it's also we hire

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:25.750 
suggestion like it's also we hire
translators<00:02:24.830> to<00:02:24.950> come<00:02:25.099> in<00:02:25.250> and<00:02:25.400> correct

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
translators to come in and correct

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.520 
translators to come in and correct
translations<00:02:26.390> so<00:02:26.900> over<00:02:27.080> time<00:02:27.290> the

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
translations so over time the

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:28.930 
translations so over time the
translation<00:02:27.950> engine<00:02:28.160> gets<00:02:28.310> much<00:02:28.489> smarter<00:02:28.910> and

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
translation engine gets much smarter and

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.600 
translation engine gets much smarter and
more<00:02:29.180> accurate<00:02:30.190> what<00:02:31.190> are<00:02:31.310> the<00:02:31.370> remaining

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
more accurate what are the remaining

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.430 
more accurate what are the remaining
obstacles<00:02:32.269> essentially<00:02:32.930> the<00:02:33.049> problem<00:02:33.349> is

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
obstacles essentially the problem is

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.640 
obstacles essentially the problem is
that<00:02:33.590> language<00:02:33.860> is<00:02:34.190> infinite<00:02:34.670> and<00:02:35.410> you<00:02:36.410> can't

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
that language is infinite and you can't

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.410 
that language is infinite and you can't
really<00:02:36.830> scale<00:02:37.340> computers<00:02:37.790> to<00:02:37.940> be<00:02:37.970> infinite

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
really scale computers to be infinite

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.809 
really scale computers to be infinite
but<00:02:38.569> you<00:02:38.690> can't<00:02:39.079> focus<00:02:39.379> changes<00:02:40.010> yes<00:02:40.370> language

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:40.819 
but you can't focus changes yes language

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:43.240 
but you can't focus changes yes language
changes<00:02:41.299> over<00:02:41.629> time<00:02:41.780> new<00:02:42.319> words<00:02:42.560> and<00:02:42.739> new<00:02:42.799> uses

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
changes over time new words and new uses

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.699 
changes over time new words and new uses
so<00:02:43.910> our<00:02:44.450> focus<00:02:44.780> is<00:02:45.079> to<00:02:45.319> put<00:02:45.470> it<00:02:45.560> in<00:02:45.620> the

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
so our focus is to put it in the

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:47.619 
so our focus is to put it in the
conversation<00:02:46.310> because<00:02:46.549> we<00:02:46.670> believe<00:02:46.940> that<00:02:46.970> we

00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:47.629 
conversation because we believe that we

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:49.420 
conversation because we believe that we
will<00:02:47.750> learn<00:02:48.079> from<00:02:48.440> how<00:02:48.620> people<00:02:48.799> say<00:02:49.160> things

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
will learn from how people say things

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.309 
will learn from how people say things
and<00:02:49.670> how<00:02:49.790> the<00:02:50.209> right<00:02:50.390> thing<00:02:50.660> to<00:02:50.780> say<00:02:50.959> something

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:51.319 
and how the right thing to say something

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:53.979 
and how the right thing to say something
is<00:02:51.799> as<00:02:52.129> opposed<00:02:52.430> to<00:02:52.519> just<00:02:53.030> a<00:02:53.180> calculation<00:02:53.660> with

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
is as opposed to just a calculation with

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:56.890 
is as opposed to just a calculation with
a<00:02:54.019> machine<00:02:54.650> translator<00:02:55.160> so<00:02:55.849> if<00:02:56.120> 10<00:02:56.540> different

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
a machine translator so if 10 different

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.640 
a machine translator so if 10 different
people<00:02:57.200> are<00:02:57.470> using<00:02:57.980> the<00:02:58.810> slang<00:02:59.810> term<00:03:00.049> of<00:03:00.500> the

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
people are using the slang term of the

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.580 
people are using the slang term of the
moment<00:03:01.069> then<00:03:01.489> maybe<00:03:01.879> it'll<00:03:02.359> start<00:03:03.079> being

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
moment then maybe it'll start being

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.559 
moment then maybe it'll start being
incorporated<00:03:03.920> into<00:03:04.730> vogue<00:03:05.030> right<00:03:05.239> absolutely

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:05.569 
incorporated into vogue right absolutely

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:07.900 
incorporated into vogue right absolutely
so<00:03:06.349> our<00:03:06.470> algorithms<00:03:06.920> essentially<00:03:07.220> learn<00:03:07.579> from

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
so our algorithms essentially learn from

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:13.990 
so our algorithms essentially learn from
the<00:03:08.090> usage<00:03:08.420> of<00:03:08.569> the<00:03:08.690> application<00:03:13.000> Andrew

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
the usage of the application Andrew
