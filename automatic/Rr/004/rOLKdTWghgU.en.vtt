00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.670
 and there I said evil bioshock 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:09.059
 infinite and it made me crazy 

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:10.950
 frustration repression salus i think 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.490
 sincerely that the scenario this game is 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.000
 shit 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.800
 shit the bedrooms has annals impulses 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.390
 I am very often angry like that 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.220
 there's a lot of stuff that annoys me and 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.220
 I can not just do not care 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.980
 fuck perversion perversion it's 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:29.910
 a little bit the version of father baer 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.590
 oedipal version the poo you have some 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.350
 thing for me besides talking to me about the case 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.870
 call nice tox three times a day for 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.910
 it's ok to be nice 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.760
 inhibits death impulses it reinforces 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.620
 on me you have already tried to do 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.090
 a minitel on a subject that are going to be 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.770
 not in this state of anger had 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.200
 no phallic erection of fury 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.350
 rings but it's true that it makes 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.350
 long time 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.590
 at 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:00:59.579
 1 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.809
 indeed there are two kinds of video games 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.430
 amateur games and the others 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:08.320
 first are finally little known 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.420
 the photo an audience to which too often 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.770
 curiosity is lacking comforted 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.910
 that he is in his serene routines he 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.380
 rarely takes the trouble to 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:16.270
 to get away from the beaten tracks and 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.710
 rebutted by the same publishers that we 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.480
 come out the same licenses honored by 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:25.270
 the same journalists venient there is 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:27.760
 reborn three times a day the cool tox 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.200
 and if you feel an attack of violence 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.760
 hysteria falic 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.350
 you can take one immediately 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:37.259
 but never more than three times a day 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:40.180
 amateur games so in nice mode 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.500
 have game ideas is easy you 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.869
 like me, we all had an evening 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.390
 could you say you know what would 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:48.520
 well it's a management game where everything is 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.530
 built an amusement park and there he 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.170
 is an invasion of zombies and you play 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.060
 in puzzle game fps at the third 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.020
 person August and the zombies who 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.869
 destroy the park 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.780
 yeah and play to be transformed into 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:04.380
 super combined like zombies but in 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.940
 super warrior and it would be zombies 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:11.920
 Marxist who would like to make the park a 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:13.330
 park auto managed my guys this is the 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.830
 enthusiastic phase where the spirits 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.390
 are heating up and gargling their 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.190
 own creativity quite often 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.110
 overvalued then comes the second phase 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.030
 and that would be the leader of the zombies 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.460
 Marxist I made drawings of 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.980
 bad guys too to give 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:29.110
 Mutant robots that defend the pace 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.750
 so these guard dogs of capitalism 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:35.530
 in fact to hu is good we do it in what 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:38.770
 in c ++ online flash with unity kills 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.240
 it's to serve as a low unity once 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.280
 I did a level at littlebigplanet 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.350
 it was not easy but it was a good one 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.090
 level but I'm not finished 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.410
 the reality principle quite often 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.820
 cooled the ardors of the brains the 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.740
 more fruitful is that programming 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:52.390
 it's not for the tintin when you know 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:53.200
 no you do not know but rest assured the 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.760
 budding molyneux 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.750
 there are still tools that 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.910
 can allow even at least 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.680
 excite you from being able despite 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:03.060
 all go to the end of their dreams 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.060
 where the reason ends 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.680
 did you know for example that wrongly said 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.940
 castilla spelling who or even hotline 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.410
 miami were created using a 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.370
 software that does not require any 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:19.050
 programming skills his 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:21.750
 software it's game maker a program 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:23.130
 created in 1999 by marc overmars this in 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.510
 the goal of teaching his students the 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.910
 basics of game programming 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.140
 video here no need to code it can 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.819
 do everything with the mouse through a 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.410
 simple visual interface though a little 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:32.519
 austere but the guy is writing a 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.230
 book and that really help me to 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:38.220
 progress 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:41.130
 yeah 40 euros and b for something that 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.330
 tomorrow you will have the bowl it's all in 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:44.430
 English is nothing that exists in 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.660
 French at the same time if the French 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.459
 knew how to make video games 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.510
 would not be supposed to be better 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:54.209
 mood since you take stamps 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:55.620
 you ah yes I forgot game maker is 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.849
 a generalist program that allow 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.530
 to achieve just about any 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:00.510
 type of game but there are also some 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:03.090
 specific tools dedicated to types of 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.680
 particular game me gunn lets you by 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.590
 example of hacking the fighting game 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.640
 of your dreams you go in tata you 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.709
 go in select 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:13.350
 you end up with that yes I know that 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:14.970
 can be very scary the next exit 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:16.350
 the ultra street fighter iv leaves you 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:16.979
 marble and you are sure of 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:20.010
 to be able to do better 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:21.959
 so go out there we can not find 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:23.550
 badly from fans union games most of 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:25.260
 creators just stinging 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.520
 sprites left on the right it's like that 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.890
 that we have the right for example broadband 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:31.760
 cim 10 and versus marvel versus capcom 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:31.760
 versus enkei 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.780
 but it is quite possible to 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:40.190
 create his own sprites is by the way 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:41.600
 sometimes quite successful but the rpg too 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:43.160
 it's good there are also very 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.350
 good except to easily create a clown 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:47.720
 dff 6 or dragon is the best known 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:48.920
 being rpg maker the opportunity to make here 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.080
 tribute to this French community 

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:53.180
 active and creative which I 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.860
 myself once belonged before the 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:57.230
 destiny of a call to other horizons 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.550
 I had made a zelda fan jam a little 

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:59.300
 no bugs and lots of mistakes 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:00.860
 spelling 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.900
 then of course on the amateur scene 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:04.550
 the fun game is a major genre but ya 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:07.370
 not that we cite the series of adventures 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:09.560
 an avatar or dark souls points to 2 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:14.060
 rpg trend bills are legion of the 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:18.100
 least in the Francophone community in 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:18.100
 help I love you my hero 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:27.920
 in japan it's been a long time since the 

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:28.610
 amateur scene swarming creator 

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:29.990
 prolific 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:32.030
 to note that there the amateur games 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:33.980
 enjoy a certain popularity is 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:35.360
 called these games jeans and some 

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:37.640
 some come to us as 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:39.470
 arcana heart or kate story on the cat 

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:40.160
 he discusses not talked about bulls go 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:41.480
 another cat 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.710
 now that we have given you the tools 

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:43.970
 you just have to put the 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:45.070
 lolos shop you will make us 

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:47.690
 great stuff 

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:49.490
 so that went well yeah but I 

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:51.500
 dropped the fps story to the 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:53.240
 third person with his breakouts 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:55.100
 on the other hand I kept the idea of ​​the park 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:58.390
 of attractions so I put a clown and 

00:05:55.100 --> 00:06:01.820
 the goal of the game is to click on it 

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:03.710
 that's the game and that's how was born 

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:05.510
 click the clown it took me an hour 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:06.320
 it was a great adventure when I 

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:08.870
 show them to others that they were 

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:11.420
 on the ass so we do not make fun 

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:13.040
 to show him all your sympathy 

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:14.090
 you have to start with projects 

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:15.620
 simple ones that will allow you to 

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:17.660
 train before then attacking you at 

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:19.430
 more ambitious ideas but the game 

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:21.230
 design is not just about ideas 

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:22.850
 I have some ideas about you 

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:23.960
 also ideas but molyneux he has some 

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:26.150
 ideas but that's why it makes a 

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:30.530
 good game designer usual your nice tone 

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:32.840
 it's so easy to make fun of the amateurs 

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:34.130
 frozen myself is also made fun of 

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:37.550
 click the clown all their good bah 

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:39.500
 it's not I'm sorry dorian I'm 

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:41.930
 sorry to be our feet to click the 

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:43.490
 clown I want to kiss you 

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:46.010
 even he is well your game he is well 

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:47.390
 really it gets awkward there but it's 

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:50.180
 we really do not care about everything all the time 

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:52.370
 to help videos of video games 

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:54.650
 it's easy to make fun of this cynicism 

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:56.450
 widespread 7.7 blazy study and then 

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:58.520
 especially tackle amateurs what 

00:06:56.450 --> 00:07:00.080
 amateurs that's what we are 

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:02.180
 we never live enough to be 

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:03.380
 something else was saying charlie chaplin come 

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:05.780
 come and give a hug come to make a 

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:08.350
 hug please here is a little 

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:18.250
 of love in fraternity 

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:20.020
 we need east shit yeah he 

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:23.290
 announces dlc there for bioshock 

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:24.670
 infinite kind new mission and one 

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:26.710
 be aware of the new costumes of 

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:28.810
 stuff like that it's not bad what it is 

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:31.720
 nice mouth is one mouth against the dlc 

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:33.430
 but it's still fan service that 

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:35.440
 it's cool they think about us they're us 

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:36.910
 to put stuff available is not 

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:40.150
