00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.229 
like an exotic lift and I never knew you
can<00:02:34.780> use<00:02:34.959> eyeshadow<00:02:35.230> as<00:02:35.770> an<00:02:36.069> eyeliner<00:02:36.459> but<00:02:36.910> I

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
can use eyeshadow as an eyeliner but I

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:39.300 
can use eyeshadow as an eyeliner but I
thought<00:02:37.660> that's<00:02:37.840> for<00:02:38.080> the<00:02:38.170> first<00:02:38.379> thing<00:02:38.709> yeah

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
thought that's for the first thing yeah

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.430 
thought that's for the first thing yeah
I<00:02:39.640> used<00:02:40.060> to<00:02:40.150> think<00:02:40.300> like<00:02:40.450> only<00:02:40.750> liquid<00:02:41.170> or<00:02:41.319> the

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
I used to think like only liquid or the

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.930 
I used to think like only liquid or the
pencil<00:02:41.920> now<00:02:42.459> I<00:02:42.849> think<00:02:43.540> powders<00:02:44.500> Ashley<00:02:45.310> glass

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940
