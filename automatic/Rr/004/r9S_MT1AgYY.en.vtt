00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.460
 as a boy we start to wait for a pencil 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:14.410
 black with eyes and darting ours 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.690
 guidelines so let's do this first 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:18.910
 division line and then draw 

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:21.160
 in the upper part an eye we press 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:23.200
 then the water and the water color and with a 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.570
 flat make up brush I go to 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.530
 color the whole of the underside with the 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:28.660
 yellow 

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:30.940
 once done that I do little ones 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:33.309
 hatches throughout this yellow part 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:35.379
 I do the same procedure in the 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:37.300
 upstairs only that we do it with 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:39.489
 the bird and then we color and then 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:42.460
 then dashes out to die again 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:45.429
 our pencil and I'm going to do under the 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.890
 bric lines while above I'm going to do 

00:00:45.429 --> 00:00:50.499
 scales near the eye we do 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:53.440
 schools a little smaller then of 

00:00:50.499 --> 00:00:55.719
 roundish shape going on let's go 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.300
 instead to outline schools as if 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:01:00.309
 were the overlapping rules we give 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:05.950
 the idea of â€‹â€‹these rules and we follow it 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:09.700
 scheme after doing this on the whole 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:11.830
 hand I take the eyeliner brush e 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.920
 black and very patiently 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:18.600
 I'm going to go over all the lines that 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.600
 we have done so far with the pencil 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.590
 then I take a small brush this is a 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:29.370
 brush from that rector always for i 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:32.490
 make up and red and I'm going to make some 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:34.440
 lines on the yellow for the upper part 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.750
 instead always with the same brush 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.270
 made of red dashes and then with a 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.930
 light white liner brush 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:45.300
 line finally we go to make eye for 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.970
 make the eye very simple to do the 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:53.190
 outline with black always using 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:55.700
 an eyeliner brush and then with the 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:58.700
 yellow wanting to make treaties 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.700
 concentric 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.190
 finally with the black I make the pupil 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:11.010
 I do the respiratory hole and this 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.320
 the final result for many others 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:15.800
 particularity of waiting for my penalty 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.800
 a kiss
