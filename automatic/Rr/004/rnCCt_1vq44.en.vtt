00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 the cema tocsin side 1 so today 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:06.150
 again for a video of gta 5 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.589
 so this is a video that will not last 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.840
 very long I would say maybe five 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.450
 minutes not even actually for you 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.370
 show a little trick I'm having fun at the 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.949
 to do there is really hands 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.720
 first of all it takes a motorcycle or even 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.720
 anything i'll show you my but 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.930
 a bike what it gives so I have 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.939
 a motorcycle I have leuthard and trevor and 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.900
 of course you have to code a code 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.099
 there are people who do not deceive the 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.279
 to panic their trophies and 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.350
 all that I understand but me there 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.000
 frankly that breaks me up so breaks the 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.610
 coach will put description that's the code 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.480
 lunar gravity so I will take 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.950
 maybe a little more momentum for 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.489
 show I do not do it really 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.980
 I have a shutter at 40 mm a myth to the same 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.079
 height that a helicopter you'll see it's 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.059
 really great class especially for the 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.270
 Motocross enthusiasts get together for 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.640
 of truth you will see myth there are some 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.350
 can do yes people who will 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.210
 not so much what it is it's just 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.850
 in fact we rock the bike did 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:07.799
 shift a little bit of 90 180 degrees 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.270
 so here we are ready so done so to 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.340
 the airport or if you have other 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.229
 sum we can do it too I think 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.000
 I like this one if the airport 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.000
 have saturated to pick up speed 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.980
 abel it did not work it's a big one 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.750
 fail if it works 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:28.330
 so that's actually it's true it gives 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.650
 that you want mega aulas not so much 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.720
 wanted him to be a fake when we 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.050
 may try him late may aps my little bit 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.500
 payment 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:38.500
 and when we fall back normally we die 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.690
 not that I was not lucky there 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.160
 do not know what happened but in 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:45.220
 make a little health code because 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:48.310
 the timing is there right after 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.210
 but basically it gives that wait 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.690
 can smoke code 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.860
 so here I am a little disgusted that 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.980
 it does not work I will 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.910
 try again 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:59.200
 that should work better because 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:00.670
 that you have the right time to resume the 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.410
 jump I try to kid and the bike did not 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.000
 not jumped so if you want not so 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:06.040
 you see of course the screen or but 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.280
 when I cave even when I do a 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.280
 front wheel 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:15.740
 me I 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:18.110
 not being able to do 3,680 facts 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:21.470
 go back to turkey this code he finds 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.690
 a veil at canton setting the normans he 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.730
 ya king is required it's a small 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.050
 thing that I will show you so quickly 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.510
 done before redoing the motorcycle tracleer 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.740
 must make the code super jump game because 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.700
 that start to lets you jump 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:36.410
 super heroes not like that look so 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.880
 normally there is no risk if you 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.920
 lose a tiny master of life 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.110
 no matter now you lose kalimba 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.340
 say so you do even when I 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.660
 did not do any code you can do 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.580
 also you will run you will run 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.900
 run you press round square and 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.480
 normally your guy he'll 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.710
 stumble and pick up on the floor me 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.760
 I do it with supersonic gravity 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:54.760
 lunar special 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:05.570
 so that's what makes us a giant leap 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:06.800
 with a nice little cry I think the 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:09.350
 cry that makes me more proud I believe that 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.820
 it's a michael I know you 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:13.370
 could it be that? 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:16.400
 give this will be nothing but good this word 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.580
 do nothing I like that we're going 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.580
 restart 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:23.090
 the video will not last very long 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:25.550
 and I will redo the thing and after I 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.780
 you showed in bmx that it gives in bmx 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:27.860
 I do not know if I 'll make a big jump 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.520
 but I will do you nothing you 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.570
 worry not dare that close the eye 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:35.870
 so I think I 'll make a pair of 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:38.110
 little videos like that on since the 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:43.090
 little hobby will say 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:44.770
 so let's go and then I think 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.210
 I also believe a lot of lines or 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:48.310
 as I said I think I can 

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:48.670
 make videos on gta 5 and black 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.920
 ops 1 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.970
 and if you want bombs there like that 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.310
 I am not very very strong I have not 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:56.860
 a lot of trick and everything but on gta 5 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:59.080
 I know a lot of stuff or lobos has 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:00.130
 do anything again me 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.870
 I do not want why it sucks 30 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.150
 seconds in sport it's good to jump 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.660
 still, that's what I'm going to remember 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.410
 on 3.2 or 2.9 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:11.950
 she's really more really doing 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:13.150
 crime debate when we are sadly seen 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:15.430
 if I do not have pedestrians it depends 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.780
 sometimes it's still yours so as I 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:20.980
 tell him I put the code in the 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:23.590
 description puts the two codes or there I 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:25.300
 will go very lunar gravity code and the 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.700
 super week code so the bike 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.310
 now we do not care a bit 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:33.129
 take out the bmx 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:34.929
 so I'm kidding 

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:38.739
 when you 're a little disgusted at 

00:04:34.929 --> 00:04:42.009
 code level because gta iv that's 

00:04:38.739 --> 00:04:43.689
 much better for example we could finally 

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:44.800
 school were numbers that could 

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:46.869
 do them when we wanted the 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:50.080
 color codes do everything in suffocating 

00:04:46.869 --> 00:04:51.429
 at leclerc apparently made the code 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.719
 gravity of bug sights a little bit and 

00:04:51.429 --> 00:04:55.389
 human faults works must go 

00:04:52.719 --> 00:04:59.610
 not function normally he should 

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:59.610
 operate I come to see that 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:17.610
 yes yes there it was not planned 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:20.379
 like that annoys me it does not work 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:22.889
 video is going maybe a little bit more of 

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:22.889
 5 me 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:29.909
 so then then the agent a court 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:29.909
 as for the banks 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:42.890
 this is how it is and public so we go 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.890
 redo the code of kings 

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:52.180
 to close disables times it takes 

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:53.820
 maybe the deactivate the news and there 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:56.440
 It functioned 

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:57.660
 there you look look what's up 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.860
 give 

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:01.540
 they really do built like 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:04.450
 that on me even by doing a simple 

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:07.690
 hop is yet again it's 

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:13.530
 nothing to mourn him that we 

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:20.610
 do a frontflip yes it's really 

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:22.480
 too strong the 3,6 as so then 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:26.080
 even if the machines that is next to 

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:29.320
 I'm sorry then now we're going 

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:29.860
 try to skip this 

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:31.510
 that it can give 

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:34.450
 ugly ceclad info that I had done 

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:35.830
 it was next to a hospital that same 

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:37.320
 cinema that we can buy some 

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:40.590
 will recognize intimate and me of course 

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:44.800
 bought only by michael unfortunately 

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:47.020
 so so to of course I saw that 

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:48.880
 Klose asked if people know 

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:50.650
 the method we can buy 

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:53.170
 some whose only fault is it 

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:56.500
 can buy the the golf the golf which is worth 

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:57.880
 so 550 million to perfect be the 

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:58.690
 purse I see not so much how one 

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:01.030
 can win them 

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:03.520
 the 550 million so if people the 

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:05.020
 know but such is this a little like 

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:06.240
 my witnesses a video they 

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:09.130
 explain 

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:11.380
 So here you have this pretty 

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:12.490
 near what it was giving the jump I'm 

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:13.290
 more than I said before but it's not 

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:16.360
 serious 

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:18.370
 So here we come to 7 minutes May 15 

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:20.410
 pretty much where I'm going to stop the video 

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:22.300
 i would say fairbank full of vision 

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:24.630
 and bore good parts of property to 

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:24.630
 Hi
