00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:10.989
 of the channel extremadura tv 

00:00:10.989 --> 00:00:13.989
 so this week we'll talk about 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.460
 this is how many of the Mexican electronic controls there are three types 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.300
 of tickets 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.009
 the first of the day the consumption encouraged your workshop accepted 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.360
 from where they took their portfolio of services 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.180
 yumkella concert 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.750
 in fact there are more but we'll see only those three teams 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.840
 best known 

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:08.020
 Elkarlana appointment has a higher level of difficulty 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.330
 since it does not have a marker that indicates how many days percent 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.740
 found on the net that will tie 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.280
 just like tap is simple and 15 is to say count 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.230
 the fact of having a marker 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:21.610
 tell you 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:22.840
 to four days 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.930
 will enter per minute does not mean that you can no longer export you have to verify 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:28.440
 about that 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.230
 to say it of another 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:33.540
 and they are tied and so no one and another 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.719
 everything has a certain degree of difficulty 

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:40.720
 both in turntables as a simple life 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.360
 however, thousands of computers are different supports for 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.360
 simplify the day's work and make it easier 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.630
 actually the computer to the sector 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:56.260
 but the worst case of cc but they claim to have the best music 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:58.270
 electronics 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.700
 Torres has been the best way 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.980
 unintentionally national zorzano 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:08.109
 the prd exhorted through the web 

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:10.139
 the best face 

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:13.139
 no no no 

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:26.379
 in fact the duties 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:30.299
