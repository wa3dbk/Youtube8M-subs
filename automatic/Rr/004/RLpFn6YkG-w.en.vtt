00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.000
 now all crazy about the jack and next 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.310
 I spoke to you today, I am 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.860
 returned with extreme gameplay done 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:23.590
 from our atomic face that brings us one 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:25.330
 dna atomic bomb only because 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.859
 atomic because if it hadn't been comic 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.269
 it would not have been atomic lol 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:29.890
 apart from the thematic rooms they don't 

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:32.769
 never well today our comedian there 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.629
 carry 64 kg streak is zero death 

00:00:32.769 --> 00:00:36.699
 even then the flawless of 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:39.100
 sniper the mors as you can see ai 

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:40.540
 guys unfortunately I don't have the possibility 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.979
 to show you the class in 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.570
 overlay as I've always done 

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:45.580
 in the other videos I would like to ask you 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.680
 brands among other things 6 useful for you is 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:50.290
 put them overexpression precisely that 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.869
 screen from the class or if you prefer that 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.339
 expose it in words as I will have to 

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:56.110
 do it this time since it has not 

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:58.089
 recorded the moment when you 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.670
 precisely the class is using this 

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:01.900
 morse with thermal sight and kick like 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.790
 specialty had anti-splinters 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:06.070
 jackal conjurer is inflexible 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:08.830
 be decided in you can see in 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.960
 part are bombing assault drone 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.820
 world board and champion and how you can 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.650
 see but I cut some sections 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.780
 of the game that turned out to be enough 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.130
 monotonous and not very happy since that's fine 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.840
 it's almost impossible to do gameplay 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.220
 left with the sniper especially if 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.200
 this game so i left 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.250
 only the keels and I cut them all 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.810
 the parts where he didn't 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.220
 essentially nothing however not 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.690
 worry if you want to see the 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.390
 Full gameplay you 'll find it king 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:33.910
 description hoping that price or pub yes 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.230
 remember to enter it then morning ha 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:36.640
 taken point in the comment is usually 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:38.380
 will have to start talking about a 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.150
 argument but the thing I want you to do 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.070
 do it yourself in this instant of 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.960
 pause the video and switch from 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.760
 diatonic channel which is in description 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.409
 because it's a beast 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.240
 but damn it at some point it will 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:51.400
 of those fields that can be 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.650
 quietly inserted into the millions 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.930
 hicks of the nomadic clan tweets apart from the 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:58.120
 really jokes this gameplay deserves 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.950
 I watched a lot a lot two or three 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.720
 times in a row just for the 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.280
 taste of watching it because it is really 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.530
 nice to watch TV 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.229
 Similar gameplay seriously is the second 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.060
 that I see in Italy the second for not 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:13.560
 talk about the added value of the fact 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.720
 who made 64 istrios 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.860
 and zero deaths wanted him that is not 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.140
 I do not even with the help of the spirit 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.480
 important Quran saint of the world and him 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.280
 he does it to me with the mons no boys not 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.870
 you can absolutely already place a 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.440
 nice I like all this video anyway 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.420
 crazy 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.790
 I'd like to know in the comments the 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.530
 your story concerning the smiley ie 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.090
 for sure all of you that you will have 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.069
 definitely played call of duty in the 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.989
 your life you will have picked up a 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:38.610
 sniper as they are once in the 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:39.930
 life more or less naturally but 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.849
 at least once in your life you will have 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.260
 definitely caught the sniper 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:44.700
 would you like to know just like the 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.280
 your story that is, however, with all my 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:50.400
 I must say that I have always preferred the 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.500
 guns to shit but there is no sense in me 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.330
 not that I can handle it, however, I know enough 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.799
 play with if his move instead 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.290
 on the map to change game styles 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:03:00.269
 because it is essentially obvious that it is 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.870
 style of play is completely different 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:04.620
 between snipers and assault rifles smg 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.989
 however, the fact is that I started 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.459
 use the sniper from my real call rhythm 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:10.440
 of duty or call of duty modern 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:12.930
 warfare 3 and let's say I never had 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.610
 a good connection and when they were there 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.620
 just the evenings when the enemies 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.540
 they were dying of old age too 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.250
 from my blows then I took refuge in 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.200
 private matches with my beginnings ae 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.760
 we played so quietly 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.470
 with the sniper and slowly I am 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.359
 increasingly passionate this style of 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.489
 kahn game will have to use it also in the game 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:31.200
 public very often it was just a 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:33.060
 moment of leisure my game with it 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.680
 sniper because maybe when I wanted 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.359
 search and I know the gameplay does not 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.709
 necessarily for youtube but really 

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:40.620
 for a personal challenge 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:43.859
 maybe I was pissed off because I was dying at 22 and 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:45.510
 when they use it, I basically didn't care 

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:48.239
 from the radios of everything that is so good 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.980
 but then times I had the 0 5 of installments or 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:51.180
 mamma mia big g 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.160
 maybe sometimes I even went out 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.079
 some nice gameplay in the sense not things 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.720
 exaggerate and I never took a mob with 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:04:00.180
 the sniper, however, even just having the crime 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.250
 two that at the time over the limits 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.200
 of my possibilities and then did it 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.359
 even the sniper I felt faith purple 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:08.609
 revenge but it was then with the co 

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:10.139
 next or black ops 2 that mine 

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:13.530
 basic career sneijder took the 

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:15.810
 a turning point is an account 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:18.840
 only where I used the bucket 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:20.799
 and there I had rates or higher than that with 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:24.099
 which I normally played with the areas 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:27.099
 you realize they have kind of 1.8 in 

00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:29.199
 the normal one is 2.1 in the dry one 

00:04:27.099 --> 00:04:31.750
 of absurd things 

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:34.539
 I remember I managed to do 20 ganz 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:36.370
 trick in a row yes maybe some with b 

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:38.169
 23 r that was very strong but 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.940
 essentially I had split where with 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:41.379
 that of sr 50 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.569
 just as the 

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:45.669
 our comedian who will mark one 

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:48.490
 ends up taking another for the disney 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:51.879
 bomber pulls a huge thread on this one 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:54.099
 will mark and then for some party with 

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:55.479
 the latter thus making itself unmarked 

00:04:54.099 --> 00:04:57.430
 four shots fired 

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:59.229
 of course you mess around I want you 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:00.550
 a lot of good but then unfortunately mine 

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:02.710
 snai career for take a nasty one 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:04.960
 fold with the advent of call of duty cost 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:07.090
 perhaps because having decreased so much 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.919
 life the game for the sniper was 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:10.659
 really difficult since when you were 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:11.979
 one on one you had one 

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:14.949
 possibility to hit the target 

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:16.629
 otherwise you were in the mud up to your neck and 

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:19.300
 we say that the hand is not that I had 

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:20.169
 lost, however, I really used it 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.159
 little 

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:23.500
 so let's finish our journey 

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:25.210
 commemorative of my previous deeds 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:27.370
 with the advent of the new call of duty 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:30.159
 vans of worcester and I have to tell you the truth 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:32.229
 I picked up links once and it's me 

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:33.880
 completely the desire of 

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:35.620
 playing with the sniper is not 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:37.539
 It is possible that two strokes to the heart are needed 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:38.139
 to kill a person, that is to say I am 

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:39.669
 point 

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:41.289
 I went to do the race of those who did more 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:43.779
 of a marker on battlefield non 

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:45.699
 any of the last except the bullshit 

00:05:43.779 --> 00:05:47.680
 here on this game difficult to use 

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:49.479
 the sniper saw that with his skeleton 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.250
 people can make triple jumps 

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:53.379
 mortals at the jackie chan and try to 

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:55.300
 take them to call drying hello to all 

00:05:53.379 --> 00:05:57.099
 evening is good so maybe later 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:59.349
 miter want to experience this 

00:05:57.099 --> 00:06:00.940
 new style of play beloved unfortunately 

00:05:59.349 --> 00:06:02.650
 our time together is 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:03.880
 over 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:05.229
 it's up to him a lot because i was 

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:06.759
 having a chance to rest roma 

00:06:05.229 --> 00:06:08.440
 commentaries I remind you to pass 

00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:10.600
 absolutely from the atomic channel 

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:13.120
 because he is a spectacular person too 

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:14.620
 only the gameplay deserves 600 like guys 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:16.690
 we can get it to 600 likes 

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:18.400
 you have to for your game reminds you 

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:20.199
 also to switch from the facebook page 

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:21.580
 and if you enjoyed this comment 

00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:23.620
 why not also from my channel that 

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:25.810
 you will find both in description here 

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:29.940
 fool around by your profession is 

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:29.940
 all but we are infinite morning Reggio
