 or criticism related to the new version of 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.489
 windows that can be improved in 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:59.280
 future releases or updates 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.680
 what happens next 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.809
 another benefit the person has when 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.070
 is registered on windows in ceder 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:09.990
 problem is having access to the 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:12.780
 new features available to Microsoft 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.939
 so how do you know the version of 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.520
 windows 10 currently the technique predicted 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:20.670
 which is a version still suffering 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.009
 several changes until you get the 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.500
 which is scheduled for the first 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:28.369
 semester 2015 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.329
 so every build that microsoft 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:31.290
 available this new version of the 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.930
 windows 10 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:37.170
 it contains improvements it contains nclusive 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.990
 fixes that were made by users 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.970
 through the windows feedback application 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.790
 that I'll show you here 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.520
 then this communication program between 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:50.220
 the user and microsoft is working 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:54.210
 and microsoft is listening yes each 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:57.780
 critical suggestion and opinion that staff 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.729
 puts there in the windows feedback application 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.189
 so it is very important to 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.950
 people's participation 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:08.009
 the people who suddenly criticize, right? 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.170
 some function the feature that was 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.790
 present on windows 7 windows 8 not 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.860
 it's more on windows 10 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.780
 you can state your opinion 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.180
 and according to the amount of 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.070
 complaints that Microsoft receives it 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.040
 will have a sense whether it is feasible or not 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:24.540
 back a feature that was present 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.880
 some previous version 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.550

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:32.520
