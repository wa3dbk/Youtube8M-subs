00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
super thick flame it definitely adds to

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.740 
super thick flame it definitely adds to
the<00:01:10.799> tone<00:01:11.130> of<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.790> instrument

a<00:01:18.240> little<00:01:18.390> bit<00:01:18.689> better<00:01:18.869> when<00:01:19.140> I<00:01:19.229> do<00:01:20.159> an<00:01:20.280> angle

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
a little bit better when I do an angle

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:26.810 
a little bit better when I do an angle
like<00:01:20.700> this<00:01:23.090> but<00:01:24.979> it<00:01:25.979> can<00:01:26.100> be<00:01:26.220> a<00:01:26.250> little<00:01:26.430> tricky

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
like this but it can be a little tricky

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.100 
like this but it can be a little tricky
with<00:01:26.939> a<00:01:27.000> reflection<00:01:27.570> of<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.720> light<00:01:27.900> or

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
with a reflection of the light or

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.330 
with a reflection of the light or
anything<00:01:28.229> but<00:01:28.350> there<00:01:28.829> you<00:01:28.950> go<00:01:29.070> I<00:01:29.100> think<00:01:29.189> you

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
that flanked like there's some just

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.160 
that flanked like there's some just
really<00:03:10.040> thick<00:03:10.310> flame<00:03:10.610> right<00:03:10.880> here<00:03:11.060> Craig<00:03:11.329> and

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
really thick flame right here Craig and

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.729 
really thick flame right here Craig and
if<00:03:12.380> you<00:03:12.470> flip<00:03:12.709> it<00:03:12.739> over<00:03:13.209> Wow<00:03:14.269> like<00:03:15.110> I<00:03:15.230> said<00:03:15.440> it

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
if you flip it over Wow like I said it

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:18.190 
if you flip it over Wow like I said it
tends<00:03:16.010> to<00:03:16.099> show<00:03:16.160> up<00:03:16.480> different<00:03:17.480> angles<00:03:17.870> so<00:03:18.049> you

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
tends to show up different angles so you

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.509 
tends to show up different angles so you
I<00:03:18.349> might<00:03:18.620> be<00:03:18.739> pointing<00:03:19.099> this<00:03:19.220> and<00:03:19.340> you<00:03:19.400> might

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 
I might be pointing this and you might

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:20.920 
I might be pointing this and you might
not<00:03:19.700> see<00:03:19.940> it<00:03:19.970> from<00:03:20.150> where<00:03:20.239> you're<00:03:20.510> looking<00:03:20.630> but

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
not see it from where you're looking but

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:22.960 
not see it from where you're looking but
right<00:03:21.110> here<00:03:21.250> there's<00:03:22.250> a<00:03:22.340> piece<00:03:22.610> of<00:03:22.760> flame<00:03:22.940> that

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
right here there's a piece of flame that

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:24.910 
right here there's a piece of flame that
starts<00:03:23.450> here<00:03:23.690> and<00:03:23.900> doesn't<00:03:24.049> doesn't<00:03:24.709> actually

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
starts here and doesn't doesn't actually

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.920 
starts here and doesn't doesn't actually
end<00:03:25.250> till<00:03:25.459> about<00:03:25.579> here<00:03:26.090> it<00:03:26.269> looks<00:03:26.629> like<00:03:26.690> it's

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
end till about here it looks like it's

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.160 
end till about here it looks like it's
about<00:03:27.170> an<00:03:27.410> inch<00:03:28.340> and<00:03:28.549> a<00:03:28.670> half<00:03:28.700> and<00:03:29.239> then<00:03:29.870> after

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
about an inch and a half and then after

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:31.360 
about an inch and a half and then after
that<00:03:30.290> there's<00:03:30.530> another<00:03:30.709> section<00:03:30.980> of<00:03:31.190> flame

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
that there's another section of flame

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:32.740 
that there's another section of flame
about<00:03:31.579> an<00:03:31.670> inch<00:03:31.849> and<00:03:32.060> then<00:03:32.150> down<00:03:32.180> here<00:03:32.360> there's

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
about an inch and then down here there's

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.750 
about an inch and then down here there's
a<00:03:32.840> section<00:03:33.170> of<00:03:33.260> flame<00:03:33.470> almost<00:03:34.400> two<00:03:34.579> inches

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
a section of flame almost two inches

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.640 
a section of flame almost two inches
it's<00:03:35.030> just<00:03:35.180> really<00:03:35.569> a<00:03:35.720> highly<00:03:36.079> figured<00:03:36.440> back

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
it's just really a highly figured back

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.289 
it's just really a highly figured back
but<00:03:36.950> as<00:03:37.040> you<00:03:37.190> can<00:03:37.310> tell<00:03:37.579> it<00:03:38.329> really<00:03:38.420> really<00:03:39.319> I

00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:40.299 
but as you can tell it really really I

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:46.379 
but as you can tell it really really I
tend<00:03:41.299> to<00:03:41.329> have<00:03:41.480> the<00:03:41.600> back<00:03:41.750> pick<00:03:42.019> up<00:03:42.170> slow

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:46.389 

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:49.379 

pretty<00:03:47.389> good<00:03:47.540> sound<00:03:47.810> on<00:03:48.049> the<00:03:48.139> back<00:03:48.319> pick<00:03:48.560> up

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:49.389 
pretty good sound on the back pick up

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:51.729 
pretty good sound on the back pick up
and<00:03:50.389> you<00:03:50.510> can<00:03:50.660> even<00:03:50.840> hear<00:03:51.139> this<00:03:51.319> I<00:03:51.380> mean<00:03:51.620> I<00:03:51.650> know

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
acoustic quality these strings are

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.670 
acoustic quality these strings are
probably<00:03:59.269> all<00:03:59.599> but<00:03:59.900> you<00:03:59.989> can<00:04:00.170> hear<00:04:00.319> that
