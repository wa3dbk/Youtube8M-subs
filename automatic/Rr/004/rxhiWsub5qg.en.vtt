00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:26.170 
involved new everything so but I wanted
to<00:02:25.280> point<00:02:25.430> out<00:02:25.580> something<00:02:25.760> here<00:02:26.000> obviously

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
to point out something here obviously

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.250 
to point out something here obviously
there's<00:02:26.840> only<00:02:26.930> one<00:02:27.170> wire<00:02:27.410> going<00:02:27.739> into<00:02:28.640> this

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
there's only one wire going into this

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.559 
there's only one wire going into this
light<00:02:30.260> so<00:02:31.190> what<00:02:31.910> that<00:02:32.060> tells<00:02:32.209> you<00:02:32.390> is<00:02:32.450> that

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:32.569 
light so what that tells you is that

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:35.949 
light so what that tells you is that
this<00:02:33.700> bracket<00:02:34.700> itself<00:02:35.060> is<00:02:35.180> self<00:02:35.450> grounding

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 
this bracket itself is self grounding

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:38.530 
this bracket itself is self grounding
now<00:02:36.260> there's<00:02:36.470> so<00:02:36.620> much<00:02:36.769> paint<00:02:37.160> on<00:02:37.450> all<00:02:38.450> these

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
now there's so much paint on all these

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.570 
now there's so much paint on all these
components<00:02:39.080> that<00:02:39.140> I'm<00:02:39.319> worried<00:02:40.220> that<00:02:40.250> I<00:02:40.400> would

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
components that I'm worried that I would

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.870 
components that I'm worried that I would
not<00:02:40.730> get<00:02:41.000> a<00:02:41.209> good<00:02:41.840> ground<00:02:42.170> had<00:02:42.470> I<00:02:42.760> just<00:02:43.760> bolted

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
not get a good ground had I just bolted

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.850 
not get a good ground had I just bolted
this<00:02:44.209> on<00:02:44.360> like<00:02:44.540> it's<00:02:44.660> supposed<00:02:44.989> to<00:02:45.050> so<00:02:45.290> let<00:02:45.769> me

put a ground strap on this light the

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.840 
put a ground strap on this light the
factory<00:02:51.200> light<00:02:51.410> attaches<00:02:51.980> with<00:02:52.370> these<00:02:52.580> screws

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
factory light attaches with these screws

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.960 
factory light attaches with these screws
right<00:02:53.120> here<00:02:53.410> they're<00:02:54.410> just<00:02:54.620> kind<00:02:55.610> of<00:02:55.640> regular

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
right here they're just kind of regular

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:57.580 
right here they're just kind of regular
old<00:02:56.000> screws<00:02:56.780> just<00:02:57.049> like<00:02:57.170> that

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
old screws just like that

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.340 
old screws just like that
well<00:02:57.980> on<00:02:58.700> the<00:02:59.000> new<00:02:59.120> light<00:02:59.330> on<00:02:59.569> the<00:02:59.750> new<00:02:59.870> bracket

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
well on the new light on the new bracket

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:05.020 
well on the new light on the new bracket
I<00:03:02.500> drilled<00:03:03.500> out<00:03:03.650> those<00:03:03.829> holes<00:03:04.010> and<00:03:04.340> I'm<00:03:04.820> using

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
I drilled out those holes and I'm using

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.870 
I drilled out those holes and I'm using
a<00:03:05.150> quarter<00:03:05.420> inch<00:03:05.480> bolt<00:03:06.400> to<00:03:07.400> go<00:03:07.519> through<00:03:07.700> those

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
a quarter inch bolt to go through those

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.930 
a quarter inch bolt to go through those
and<00:03:08.090> actually<00:03:08.480> mount<00:03:08.720> this<00:03:08.989> light<00:03:09.950> bracket<00:03:10.400> to

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
and actually mount this light bracket to

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:12.640 
and actually mount this light bracket to
the<00:03:10.970> license<00:03:11.570> plate<00:03:11.810> bracket<00:03:11.989> now<00:03:12.350> these<00:03:12.470> are

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
the license plate bracket now these are

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.170 
the license plate bracket now these are
stainless<00:03:12.859> steel<00:03:13.010> you<00:03:13.700> don't<00:03:13.790> have<00:03:13.910> to<00:03:14.090> get

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
stainless steel you don't have to get

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.000 
stainless steel you don't have to get
stainless<00:03:14.480> steel<00:03:14.600> I<00:03:14.660> just<00:03:14.959> really<00:03:15.650> happen<00:03:15.920> to

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
stainless steel I just really happen to

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:17.710 
stainless steel I just really happen to
like<00:03:16.130> stainless<00:03:16.400> steel<00:03:16.670> hardware<00:03:17.060> let<00:03:17.480> me<00:03:17.570> put

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
like stainless steel hardware let me put

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.930 
like stainless steel hardware let me put
this<00:03:17.780> together<00:03:17.959> and<00:03:18.350> then<00:03:18.890> show<00:03:19.670> you<00:03:19.760> how<00:03:19.820> this

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
this together and then show you how this

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:20.410 
this together and then show you how this
is<00:03:20.000> going<00:03:20.180> to<00:03:20.269> work

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
is going to work

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.229 
is going to work
weight<00:03:20.630> installed<00:03:20.989> in<00:03:21.140> the<00:03:21.200> bracket<00:03:21.620> in<00:03:21.829> the

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
weight installed in the bracket in the

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:24.390 
weight installed in the bracket in the
license<00:03:23.239> plate<00:03:23.420> bracket<00:03:23.600> and<00:03:23.840> this<00:03:23.930> is<00:03:24.109> just

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
license plate bracket and this is just

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
license plate bracket and this is just
real<00:03:25.400> simple<00:03:25.579> way<00:03:25.850> of<00:03:25.880> putting<00:03:26.150> a<00:03:26.180> ground

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
real simple way of putting a ground

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.780 
real simple way of putting a ground
strap<00:03:26.690> on<00:03:26.900> here<00:03:27.140> I<00:03:27.290> went<00:03:28.100> up<00:03:28.190> and<00:03:28.340> made<00:03:28.459> a

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
strap on here I went up and made a

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:34.030 
strap on here I went up and made a
ground<00:03:29.720> wire<00:03:30.459> it's<00:03:31.459> just<00:03:31.609> gonna<00:03:31.730> rest<00:03:32.060> on<00:03:33.040> one

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
ground wire it's just gonna rest on one

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.229 
ground wire it's just gonna rest on one
of<00:03:34.070> these<00:03:34.220> bolts<00:03:34.519> it<00:03:34.609> doesn't<00:03:34.850> matter<00:03:35.000> either

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
of these bolts it doesn't matter either

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:39.660 
of these bolts it doesn't matter either
either<00:03:35.480> one<00:03:36.070> and<00:03:37.070> then<00:03:37.190> I've<00:03:37.280> got<00:03:37.430> a<00:03:37.459> third<00:03:37.900> nut

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
either one and then I've got a third nut

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:44.620 
either one and then I've got a third nut
that<00:03:40.670> goes<00:03:40.850> on<00:03:41.000> there<00:03:42.220> snug<00:03:43.220> that<00:03:43.280> down<00:03:43.630> and

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 
that goes on there snug that down and

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:46.720 
that goes on there snug that down and
now<00:03:44.840> our<00:03:45.079> license<00:03:45.470> plate<00:03:45.500> light<00:03:45.799> is<00:03:46.310> grounded

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
now our license plate light is grounded

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:48.490 
now our license plate light is grounded
that's<00:03:46.940> it<00:03:47.150> we're<00:03:47.750> finished<00:03:48.019> with<00:03:48.140> this<00:03:48.230> truck
