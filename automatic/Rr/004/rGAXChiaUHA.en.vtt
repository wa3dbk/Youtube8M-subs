case and then that plastic piece runs in
a<00:01:56.969> groove<00:01:57.540> all<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:57.990> way<00:01:58.409> around<00:01:59.119> so<00:02:00.119> it<00:02:00.149> just

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
a groove all the way around so it just

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.679 
a groove all the way around so it just
adds<00:02:00.780> protection<00:02:01.079> to<00:02:01.590> it<00:02:01.969> and<00:02:02.969> then<00:02:03.450> to

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
adds protection to it and then to

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.859 
adds protection to it and then to
protect<00:02:04.049> the<00:02:04.170> lens<00:02:04.460> i've<00:02:05.460> when<00:02:05.790> bought<00:02:06.240> two<00:02:06.840> of

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
protect the lens i've when bought two of

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.320 
protect the lens i've when bought two of
these<00:02:07.110> one<00:02:07.469> is<00:02:07.649> just<00:02:07.829> a<00:02:07.920> plain<00:02:08.160> UV<00:02:08.550> filter<00:02:08.970> and

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
these one is just a plain UV filter and

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.529 
these one is just a plain UV filter and
then

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
then

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.210 
then
the<00:02:10.869> one<00:02:11.050> that's<00:02:11.200> on<00:02:11.379> here<00:02:11.530> right<00:02:11.739> now<00:02:11.920> is<00:02:12.190> a

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
the one that's on here right now is a

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.070 
the one that's on here right now is a
polarizer<00:02:12.790> lens<00:02:13.180> that's<00:02:13.480> why<00:02:13.659> you<00:02:13.720> can't

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
polarizer lens that's why you can't

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.660 
polarizer lens that's why you can't
actually<00:02:14.290> see<00:02:14.739> through<00:02:15.099> it<00:02:17.220> this<00:02:18.220> is<00:02:18.400> the<00:02:18.519> UV

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
actually see through it this is the UV

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.880 
actually see through it this is the UV
filter<00:02:19.239> it<00:02:19.420> doesn't<00:02:19.720> actually<00:02:20.080> you<00:02:20.769> know<00:02:20.860> I

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
filter it doesn't actually you know I

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.559 
filter it doesn't actually you know I
mean<00:02:21.069> doesn't<00:02:21.459> filter<00:02:21.670> out<00:02:21.909> anything<00:02:22.180> it's

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 
mean doesn't filter out anything it's

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:28.860 
mean doesn't filter out anything it's
just<00:02:22.659> a<00:02:22.950> lens<00:02:26.700> it<00:02:27.700> doesn't<00:02:28.120> it<00:02:28.330> doesn't<00:02:28.510> affect

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
just a lens it doesn't it doesn't affect

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.050 
just a lens it doesn't it doesn't affect
the<00:02:28.989> functionality<00:02:29.410> of<00:02:29.680> it<00:02:29.920> none<00:02:30.099> the<00:02:30.519> flash

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
the functionality of it none the flash

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.300 
the functionality of it none the flash
still<00:02:31.360> comes<00:02:31.569> up<00:02:31.720> no<00:02:31.930> problem<00:02:32.560> I<00:02:32.860> can<00:02:33.010> adjust

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
still comes up no problem I can adjust
