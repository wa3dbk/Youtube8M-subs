00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
knows the one thing that's for sure is

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.750 
knows the one thing that's for sure is
were<00:00:33.840> playing<00:00:34.140> England<00:00:34.590> in<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:34.770> semi-finals

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
were playing England in the semi-finals

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.790 
were playing England in the semi-finals
and<00:00:35.969> there's<00:00:36.630> a<00:00:36.690> starting<00:00:37.140> eleven<00:00:37.440> for<00:00:37.590> both

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
and there's a starting eleven for both

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.369 
and there's a starting eleven for both
teams<00:00:38.420> England<00:00:39.420> I<00:00:39.480> think<00:00:39.719> has<00:00:39.899> a<00:00:39.930> stronger

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
teams England I think has a stronger

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:41.990 
teams England I think has a stronger
starting<00:00:40.739> eleven<00:00:41.100> than<00:00:41.219> Portugal<00:00:41.700> so<00:00:41.790> this<00:00:41.910> is

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
starting eleven than Portugal so this is

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.299 
starting eleven than Portugal so this is
gonna<00:00:42.149> be<00:00:42.329> tough<00:00:42.629> winner<00:00:43.500> moves<00:00:43.860> on<00:00:44.070> to<00:00:44.129> the

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.099 
long sleeves and I know it's probably

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:56.390 
long sleeves and I know it's probably
like<00:02:53.400> a<00:02:53.549> hundred<00:02:53.700> degrees<00:02:54.329> outside<00:02:54.840> but<00:02:55.439> you

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
like a hundred degrees outside but you

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.039 
like a hundred degrees outside but you
know<00:02:56.579> it<00:02:56.700> just<00:02:56.730> makes<00:02:57.120> me<00:02:57.299> feel<00:02:57.480> different<00:02:57.780> it

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
know it just makes me feel different it

00:02:58.049 --> 00:02:59.629 
know it just makes me feel different it
makes<00:02:58.200> me<00:02:58.379> feel<00:02:58.620> a<00:02:58.650> bit<00:02:58.739> unique<00:02:59.220> I<00:02:59.370> know<00:02:59.430> what

00:02:59.629 --> 00:02:59.639 
makes me feel a bit unique I know what

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:01.160
