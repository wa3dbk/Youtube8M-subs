00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:19.259
 hello today I'll teach you to 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.169
 make a very important finish to the 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:24.689
 time to make our clothes and this 

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:27.540
 It is the piece seam pencil to seam us 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:30.029
 It is useful for covering our 

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:32.579
 clothes that we are left to turn over 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.770
 better give us a better finish or 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.860
 well they also serve us as some 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.560
 ornament 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.780
 and the pizza seam is this seam that 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.970
 we see here at the foot of the neck is this 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:46.120
 that goes a millimeter or two away 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:49.030
 of our union of neck with foot of 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:51.280
 neck this is a piece stitching this 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.930
 that we have here a little more separated 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.780
 it's also being another colpisa 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.300
 sewing 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.270
 at the time of turning that we turn around very 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:03.150
 well our neck and that we do not stay 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.070
 the part of the reverse around here in front 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.690
 that many times in the sewing track we 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.030
 It serves to turn our 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:12.600
 clothes this is not going to see us was 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.970
 on the side of the lining of our 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.910
 our dress that in this case is 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:21.090
 lined everything and the piece stitching is by 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:23.810
 the part of our forum is a seam 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.810
 very small 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:33.380
 It is a very small seam that is stuck 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:36.130
 in the part of the lining about two 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.660
 millimeters away from our court 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.640
 we are doing it to make us turn 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:43.370
 well our clothes if not what 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:46.160
 we could do it we can leave our 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:48.770
 lining for the part of here and it is bad 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:51.500
 ends up good now to do our 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:54.380
 sewing piece we will stick what comes 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.660
 being our lining here I already hit him 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.700
 this is a blouse and what I am 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:01.190
 hitting is a life has left me because 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:04.210
 the side what we're going to do is make 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.210
 some cut 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:12.100
 and cut our fabric that is uncut 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:15.370
 our sewing that is where we join 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:18.150
 our our piece of law with 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.150
 our forum 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.260
 i 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.330
 well once all the cuts are made 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:32.220
 all the outline where we are going to sew 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:35.790
 let's turn our forum 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.830
 and grabbing all the tabs for the 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.690
 side of the lining should not be left 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.700
 the tabs for the right side 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.970
 because otherwise it will not turn us very well 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.890
 our garment all our lashes 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:49.290
 we open in half and all the tabs 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:52.860
 that we remain for the side of the lining and 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:55.590
 then if we pass our sewing to 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.300
 about 2000 meters away from the cut 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.060
 of the Union 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:02.900
 we open our two fabrics very well and 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.900
 now 5 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:13.960
 yes 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.960
 do not 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.570
 Well, here we have our 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.570
 sewing piece 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:24.280
 nothing else you have to iron very well and 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:27.170
 it's going to turn around, it's fixed, it just flips 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:30.250
 and once ironed we have left 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.250
 much better 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.060
 good 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:45.569
 yes 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.569
