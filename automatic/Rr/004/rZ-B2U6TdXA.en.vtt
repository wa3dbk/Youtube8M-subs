00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 hehe jobs from youtube or beat them 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.879
 touch out of me of the law and see this 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.470
 asking again for something from the law and this 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:08.880
 song is also the good of the 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.490
 law and here they can be followed 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.019
 totally on acoustic guitar you know 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.670
 that we have demo videos of 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.440
 this side and behind chords of 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.109
 cristian mix dotcom down here in 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:22.260
 information I leave the link so 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:26.150
 ok let's start perfect tuning 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.150
 standard and see how we started 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.840
 Y 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.470
 perfect let's start first with 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:15.049
 the stanzas and the choir and right now 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:18.049
 I'll show you the part of the intro 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:23.960
 of chords I use chicken with 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:27.300
 my oldest after this the chicken I know here 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:30.360
 the trick is that we are in me 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:33.310
 and the number one finger does not take it off and 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.700
 check the movement 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:40.930
 finger number 2 fret number 2 string 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:42.039
 number 4 and then the number 3 finger in 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.360
 rope number 2 

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:45.360
 behind number 2 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:54.750
 then nothing else for the choir part 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:57.870
 or the pre crowns to use chicken 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:00.210
 world held lower here the trick is 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:02.510
 in which the first one we are going to leave it to 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.510
 air 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:09.800
 and then a yes and we leave first and 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.800
 second air 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.370
 let's start with the rhythm is very 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.880
 simple we have used it a lot the 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.880
 you n 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.440
 a day that is down so high and 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:34.310
 it hit a quick change upstairs 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:34.310
 let's do it very slowly 3 2 1 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.130
 succumb 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.730
 Y 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.730
 Y 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.079
 you 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:58.070
 well a little bit faster 3 2 1 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.880
 we practically have the whole song already 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:18.550
 so won check I'll put the 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:18.550
 letter 321 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:26.260
 and the wind 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.260
 to me 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:35.569
 we repeat 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:35.569
 glances 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.299
 and is that 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:48.400
 what if 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.280
 has two sharps 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.140
 instead 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:16.240
 we passed like this 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:16.240
 we repeat 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.039
 my grave 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:32.939
 and again we repeat the same 

00:04:33.849 --> 00:04:39.789
 As you find out, you have mastered the tun 

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:42.309
 tun tun tun let's start with the 

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:43.659
 part of inside practically having 

00:04:42.309 --> 00:04:45.879
 well learned fast this is a piece of cake 

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:48.840
 is born makes some variants in my check 

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:51.480
 we started with a major mi 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:54.570
 after 

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:58.070
 we passed finger number 4 the skinny 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:59.680
 rope number 3 after fingers 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:02.800
 we remove 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:06.430
 and then these two fingers we had 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:09.669
 until the ninth fret and nothing we touch 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:13.500
 strings six five and four and it's the same 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:13.500
 it is rational is emphasized the first fast 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:27.030
 to me yes 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:27.030
 yes 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:38.330
 let's do the whole arrangement very slowly 

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:38.330
 after half 321 

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:43.200
 i 

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:49.340
 i 

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:49.340
 we repeat slide back 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:54.380
 to 

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:09.870
 weather 

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:09.870
 ok now yes faster 3 2 1 

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:17.690
 once 

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:25.300
 Y 

00:06:23.139 --> 00:06:26.919
 perfect so we have the song complete 

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:29.139

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:30.999
