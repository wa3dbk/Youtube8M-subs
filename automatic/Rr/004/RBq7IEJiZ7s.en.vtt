00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.189
 Studio 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:21.210
 Anyone who is ready with that can do that 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.740
 the providers with fast lines 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.939
 sets the data purely with the numbers in 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:32.009
 digital text still everything 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:34.020
 double speed no risk no tags with 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.210
 a fat cat with energy seems clean 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.770
 not on my own heart 180 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.420

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.610

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.410
 Does not sound like that and will 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.410
 never 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:06.540

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.320
 2 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.270

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.790
 Most thought I'm on the

 map states lay with what they 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.520
 thought saying languages â€‹â€‹were the best 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.870
 and over and over again 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.520

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:27.870
 skicross is popular because I belong to everyone 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.490
 time goes on but I kept walking 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.540
 the wii is seen as moving 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.500
 many come and go without 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.270
 to see mainstream fans 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.130

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:09.429
 that 's my base that pushes fast 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:14.569
 probably a lot more pressure from below 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:16.520
 you can feel that how loud music is 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:19.010
