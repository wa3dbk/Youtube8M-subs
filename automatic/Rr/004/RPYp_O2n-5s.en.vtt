00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:37.739 
the Genesis controller is your

00:01:37.739 --> 00:01:41.359 
the Genesis controller is your
accelerator<00:01:38.569> your<00:01:39.569> C<00:01:40.140> button<00:01:40.500> is<00:01:41.009> your

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
accelerator your C button is your

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.029 
accelerator your C button is your
special<00:01:41.940> weapon<00:01:42.479> and<00:01:42.810> in<00:01:43.170> Ray's<00:01:43.410> case<00:01:43.709> it's<00:01:43.950> a

00:01:44.029 --> 00:01:44.039 
special weapon and in Ray's case it's a

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:48.100 
special weapon and in Ray's case it's a
turbo<00:01:44.310> boost<00:01:44.640> it's<00:01:45.479> not<00:01:45.630> really<00:01:45.989> 11<00:01:46.970> anyhow

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110

that's<00:01:49.110> about<00:01:49.380> all<00:01:49.590> I<00:01:49.619> know<00:01:49.739> I<00:01:49.920> don't<00:01:50.069> think

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
that's about all I know I don't think

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.639 
that's about all I know I don't think
the<00:01:50.429> a<00:01:50.670> button<00:01:51.030> does<00:01:51.239> anything<00:01:51.780> at<00:01:51.899> all<00:01:52.050> but<00:01:52.560> I

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
the a button does anything at all but I

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:53.960 
the a button does anything at all but I
could<00:01:52.830> be<00:01:52.920> wrong<00:01:52.979> I<00:01:53.310> haven't<00:01:53.610> played<00:01:53.789> this

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
could be wrong I haven't played this

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.490 
could be wrong I haven't played this
game<00:01:54.060> very<00:01:54.360> much<00:01:54.509> I<00:01:54.929> don't<00:01:55.319> have<00:01:55.440> the

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
game very much I don't have the

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.109 
game very much I don't have the
instruction<00:01:56.009> manual<00:01:56.399> so<00:01:56.520> I<00:01:56.550> couldn't<00:01:56.849> play<00:01:56.970> it

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
instruction manual so I couldn't play it

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.320 
instruction manual so I couldn't play it
for<00:01:57.239> short<00:01:57.479> and<00:01:58.220> quite<00:01:59.220> frankly<00:01:59.399> that<00:02:00.179> was<00:02:00.300> a

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.330 
for short and quite frankly that was a

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:01.729 
for short and quite frankly that was a
little<00:02:00.539> too<00:02:00.660> lazy<00:02:00.869> to<00:02:01.050> even<00:02:01.110> look<00:02:01.500> up<00:02:01.649> the

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:01.739 
little too lazy to even look up the

00:02:01.739 --> 00:02:02.869 
little too lazy to even look up the
instruction<00:02:02.160> manual<00:02:02.459> because<00:02:02.640> basically

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:02.879 
instruction manual because basically

00:02:02.879 --> 00:02:06.260 
instruction manual because basically
it's<00:02:03.810> a<00:02:03.989> pretty<00:02:04.200> simple<00:02:04.560> game<00:02:05.030> now<00:02:06.030> although

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
it's a pretty simple game now although

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.540 
it's a pretty simple game now although
