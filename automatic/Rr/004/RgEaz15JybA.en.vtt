00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.740 
known as zombies the last stand on the
iPhone<00:00:38.390> on<00:00:39.010> the<00:00:40.010> left<00:00:40.340> is<00:00:40.579> an<00:00:40.820> original<00:00:41.120> iPad

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750 
iPhone on the left is an original iPad

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.540 
iPhone on the left is an original iPad
on<00:00:42.020> the<00:00:42.410> right<00:00:42.770> is<00:00:42.980> an<00:00:43.100> ipad<00:00:43.400> 2<00:00:44.680> so<00:00:45.680> this<00:00:46.250> game

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
on the right is an ipad 2 so this game

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.069 
on the right is an ipad 2 so this game
is<00:00:46.879> a<00:00:47.570> first-person<00:00:47.989> shooter<00:00:49.809> zombies<00:00:50.809> in<00:00:50.989> it

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:51.079 
is a first-person shooter zombies in it

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:53.950 
is a first-person shooter zombies in it
and<00:00:51.320> you<00:00:51.350> can<00:00:52.190> see<00:00:52.400> it's<00:00:52.699> quite<00:00:53.180> choppy<00:00:53.480> on<00:00:53.809> the

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
and you can see it's quite choppy on the

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.100 
and you can see it's quite choppy on the
iPad<00:00:54.290> 1<00:00:54.589> this<00:00:55.579> is<00:00:55.760> why<00:00:55.909> we<00:00:56.120> didn't<00:00:56.390> release<00:00:56.930> it

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:57.110 
iPad 1 this is why we didn't release it

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:02.200 
iPad 1 this is why we didn't release it
for<00:00:57.260> the<00:00:57.350> ipad<00:01:00.250> and<00:01:01.250> the<00:01:01.460> zombies<00:01:01.850> are<00:01:01.879> paused

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
for the ipad and the zombies are paused

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.509 
for the ipad and the zombies are paused
right<00:01:02.479> now<00:01:02.629> because<00:01:02.960> i'm<00:01:03.110> cheating<00:01:03.519> by

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
right now because i'm cheating by

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:06.550 
right now because i'm cheating by
putting<00:01:04.820> a<00:01:04.970> button<00:01:05.930> that<00:01:05.960> will<00:01:06.080> pause<00:01:06.350> them

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
putting a button that will pause them

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.560 
putting a button that will pause them
all<00:01:06.650> so<00:01:06.799> i<00:01:06.860> can<00:01:07.040> just<00:01:07.159> walk<00:01:07.400> around<00:01:07.580> on

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
all so i can just walk around on

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:15.760 
all so i can just walk around on
interrupted<00:01:11.680> so<00:01:13.840> this<00:01:14.840> is<00:01:15.020> what<00:01:15.229> most<00:01:15.470> games

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
interrupted so this is what most games

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.340 
interrupted so this is what most games
look<00:01:16.010> like<00:01:16.159> on<00:01:16.340> the<00:01:16.369> ipad<00:01:16.930> it's<00:01:17.930> basically

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
look like on the ipad it's basically

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.730 
look like on the ipad it's basically
flat<00:01:18.680> shading<00:01:19.420> no<00:01:20.420> shadows<00:01:20.930> no<00:01:21.290> per<00:01:21.500> pixel

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
flat shading no shadows no per pixel

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.990 
flat shading no shadows no per pixel
effects<00:01:23.950> when<00:01:24.950> we<00:01:25.070> get<00:01:25.220> the<00:01:25.340> ipad<00:01:25.700> 2<00:01:25.970> running

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
effects when we get the ipad 2 running

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.260 
effects when we get the ipad 2 running
we<00:01:26.990> can<00:01:27.020> do<00:01:27.259> all<00:01:27.409> those<00:01:27.619> things<00:01:27.680> and<00:01:28.270> still

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
we can do all those things and still

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.859 
we can do all those things and still
have<00:01:29.450> it<00:01:29.630> running<00:01:29.869> in<00:01:30.049> a<00:01:30.110> faster<00:01:30.500> frame<00:01:30.740> rate

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:31.869 
have it running in a faster frame rate

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:35.800 
have it running in a faster frame rate
which<00:01:32.869> is<00:01:32.899> amazing<00:01:34.030> serve<00:01:35.030> over<00:01:35.179> to<00:01:35.420> the<00:01:35.509> ipad

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
which is amazing serve over to the ipad

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.870 
which is amazing serve over to the ipad
2<00:01:37.149> you'll<00:01:38.149> see<00:01:38.420> we<00:01:38.689> have<00:01:39.100> shadows<00:01:40.100> and<00:01:40.399> these

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
2 you'll see we have shadows and these

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.050 
2 you'll see we have shadows and these
are<00:01:40.999> full<00:01:41.329> seen<00:01:41.600> shadow<00:01:41.960> mapping<00:01:42.499> on<00:01:43.060> the

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
are full seen shadow mapping on the

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.080 
are full seen shadow mapping on the
characters<00:01:44.479> and<00:01:44.840> the<00:01:44.990> buildings<00:01:45.409> and<00:01:46.090> that's

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
characters and the buildings and that's

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:48.849 
characters and the buildings and that's
something<00:01:47.270> you<00:01:47.479> don't<00:01:47.600> even<00:01:47.749> see<00:01:48.109> in<00:01:48.319> titles

00:01:48.849 --> 00:01:48.859 
something you don't even see in titles

00:01:48.859 --> 00:02:00.520 
something you don't even see in titles
such<00:01:49.069> as<00:01:49.130> Metal<00:01:49.729> Gear<00:01:49.789> Solid<00:01:50.140> 4<00:01:51.670> on<00:01:52.670> the<00:01:53.450> ps3

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.830 

so<00:02:01.130> you<00:02:01.220> see<00:02:01.580> there's<00:02:02.000> straddle<00:02:02.390> coming<00:02:02.720> off

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
so you see there's straddle coming off

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:10.230 
so you see there's straddle coming off
the<00:02:03.080> building

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.930 

and<00:02:10.360> the<00:02:11.080> other<00:02:11.230> effect<00:02:11.620> which<00:02:12.010> I<00:02:12.310> do<00:02:12.460> not<00:02:12.790> have

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
and the other effect which I do not have

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.270 
and the other effect which I do not have
turned<00:02:13.120> on<00:02:13.330> yet<00:02:13.510> is<00:02:14.040> parallax<00:02:15.040> mapping<00:02:15.280> and

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
turned on yet is parallax mapping and

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.590 
turned on yet is parallax mapping and
parallax<00:02:18.280> mapping<00:02:18.520> is<00:02:18.940> basically<00:02:20.460> a<00:02:21.460> a<00:02:21.600> bump

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
parallax mapping is basically a a bump

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.390 
parallax mapping is basically a a bump
mapping<00:02:22.810> but<00:02:23.260> it<00:02:23.380> gives<00:02:23.530> displacement<00:02:24.070> to

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
mapping but it gives displacement to

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.820 
mapping but it gives displacement to
each<00:02:24.520> pixel<00:02:24.970> so<00:02:25.660> it's<00:02:25.810> like<00:02:25.840> displayed<00:02:26.260> let's

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
each pixel so it's like displayed let's

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:28.350 
each pixel so it's like displayed let's
placement<00:02:27.190> mapping<00:02:27.490> that<00:02:27.610> works<00:02:27.790> on<00:02:27.940> pixels

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
placement mapping that works on pixels

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.510 
placement mapping that works on pixels
instead<00:02:28.630> of<00:02:28.750> vertices<00:02:29.140> so<00:02:30.040> let's<00:02:30.190> turn<00:02:30.370> that

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
instead of vertices so let's turn that

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:35.160 
instead of vertices so let's turn that
on<00:02:31.890> you<00:02:32.890> see<00:02:33.160> the<00:02:33.280> ground<00:02:33.640> is<00:02:34.240> now<00:02:34.450> bumpy<00:02:34.900> and

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
on you see the ground is now bumpy and

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:42.110 
on you see the ground is now bumpy and
it<00:02:36.130> has<00:02:36.250> depth<00:02:36.580> to<00:02:36.880> it<00:02:37.170> when<00:02:38.170> you<00:02:38.260> move<00:02:38.410> around

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.940 

and<00:02:43.120> it's<00:02:43.450> more<00:02:44.080> apparent<00:02:44.500> when<00:02:44.560> you<00:02:44.680> look<00:02:44.830> at

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
and it's more apparent when you look at

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:55.780 
and it's more apparent when you look at
the<00:02:45.100> stones<00:02:45.880> on<00:02:46.150> the<00:02:46.300> church

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.880 

you<00:02:56.209> see<00:02:56.480> the<00:02:56.659> stones<00:02:56.930> have<00:02:57.079> depths<00:02:57.769> and

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
you see the stones have depths and

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.929 
you see the stones have depths and
they're<00:02:58.069> popping<00:02:58.489> out<00:02:58.640> of<00:02:58.760> there<00:02:59.439> turn<00:03:00.439> it<00:03:00.560> off

00:03:00.929 --> 00:03:00.939 
they're popping out of there turn it off

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:07.420 
they're popping out of there turn it off
that's<00:03:01.939> what<00:03:02.150> it<00:03:02.209> looks<00:03:02.390> like<00:03:02.510> normally<00:03:06.430> and

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
that's what it looks like normally and

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.280 
that's what it looks like normally and
really<00:03:07.700> there's<00:03:07.939> not<00:03:08.030> much<00:03:08.209> lost<00:03:08.480> in<00:03:08.629> speed<00:03:08.930> on

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
really there's not much lost in speed on

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:14.080 
really there's not much lost in speed on
the<00:03:09.590> ipad<00:03:09.920> 2<00:03:12.189> concerning<00:03:13.189> all<00:03:13.280> the<00:03:13.430> work<00:03:13.879> that

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
the ipad 2 concerning all the work that

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:20.819 
the ipad 2 concerning all the work that
is<00:03:14.120> doing<00:03:14.420> that<00:03:14.510> every<00:03:14.720> pixel<00:03:15.019> on<00:03:15.170> the<00:03:15.200> screen

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:20.829 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:28.440 

so<00:03:21.829> the<00:03:22.040> ipad<00:03:22.340> 2<00:03:22.549> is<00:03:22.730> very<00:03:23.060> very<00:03:23.329> powerful<00:03:23.930> and

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 
one thing this is what the original ipad

00:04:49.149 --> 00:04:49.159 

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:52.850 

you<00:04:50.159> can<00:04:50.310> see<00:04:50.550> the<00:04:50.729> framerate<00:04:51.030> is<00:04:51.860> basically

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
you can see the framerate is basically

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:58.219 
you can see the framerate is basically
unplayable<00:04:54.199> and<00:04:56.120> the<00:04:57.120> same<00:04:57.330> thing<00:04:57.569> on<00:04:57.750> an<00:04:57.900> iPad

00:04:58.219 --> 00:04:58.229

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.490 
2 so there is a huge difference between

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:13.459 
2 so there is a huge difference between
these<00:05:05.669> two<00:05:11.270> here<00:05:12.270> is<00:05:12.419> one<00:05:12.599> other<00:05:12.750> example<00:05:12.930> of

00:05:13.459 --> 00:05:13.469 
these two here is one other example of

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:18.760 
these two here is one other example of
parallax<00:05:13.889> mapping<00:05:14.190> in<00:05:14.669> zombies<00:05:15.659> HD<00:05:17.210> this<00:05:18.210> is<00:05:18.449> a

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:18.770 
parallax mapping in zombies HD this is a

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:21.589 
parallax mapping in zombies HD this is a
this<00:05:19.770> is<00:05:19.830> with<00:05:20.159> parallax<00:05:20.729> mapping<00:05:20.940> turned<00:05:21.360> off

00:05:21.589 --> 00:05:21.599 
this is with parallax mapping turned off

00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:23.450 
this is with parallax mapping turned off
it's<00:05:22.199> what<00:05:22.380> you<00:05:22.409> would<00:05:22.620> normally<00:05:22.800> see<00:05:23.039> in<00:05:23.310> most

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460 
it's what you would normally see in most

it's what you would normally see in most
i<00:05:23.819> pad<00:05:24.150> games<00:05:24.419> and<00:05:25.319> when<00:05:25.770> you<00:05:25.860> turn<00:05:26.039> it<00:05:26.159> on

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:27.169 
i pad games and when you turn it on

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:32.740 
i pad games and when you turn it on
everything<00:05:28.169> has<00:05:28.380> depth<00:05:29.069> and<00:05:29.630> shadows<00:05:30.630> and

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:32.750 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:36.680 

that<00:05:33.750> is<00:05:33.900> still<00:05:34.169> just<00:05:34.889> a<00:05:35.159> single<00:05:35.880> polygon<00:05:36.300> on

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:36.690 
that is still just a single polygon on

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:40.370 
that is still just a single polygon on
the<00:05:36.779> screen<00:05:37.880> but<00:05:38.880> it<00:05:38.940> has<00:05:39.599> so<00:05:40.050> much<00:05:40.199> more

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:40.380 
the screen but it has so much more

00:05:40.380 --> 00:06:04.929 
the screen but it has so much more
