00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.700
 hi everyone you are watching the channel 

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:08.220
 international drawing club is a channel 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:12.269
 for those who like to draw and practice 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.049
 creativity today our video will be 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.330
 is dedicated to 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.080
 interesting and convenient tool for 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.080
 creativity 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.119
 this and zograf in this case we 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.689
 consider and zograf companies 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:28.230
 rotring thing is that the reviews in u-tuba 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.789
 on isographs extremely little when I decided 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.700
 buy it 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.680
 I ran into the problem that this 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.860
 The topic is not sufficiently disclosed on the Internet. 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.079
 that is, practically nothing of their own 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.540
 videos I will try in detail 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.570
 consider ugres as a tool for 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.860
 people who are fond of drawing they 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.600
 drawing and so this tool is very 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:54.500
 often used by professional 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.879
 artists and designers around the world 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.850
 as often as possible it is used in 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:03.059
 drawing and zograf allows you to apply 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.400
 straight line of equal thickness this 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.430
 depends on the size of the writing node in 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:11.490
 a lineup of agrafty mouth wounds their big 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.830
 amount from the thinnest line to 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.500
 quite fatty using various 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.420
 the thickness of the tools we can do in 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.450
 drawing very fine details 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.560
 highlight different elements quickly 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.130
 paint over small areas 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.250
 image and zograf consists of 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.259
 several main parts 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:35.280
 the first is the casing and unscrew 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:37.619
 cap thread on the cap is made for 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.759
 to mascara you for the graph 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:43.560
 did not dry out by the way a very important point 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:45.780
 if you don’t draw and don’t 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.560
 use this tool then it can 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.710
 dry out 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.020
 mascara in the tip and zograf dries and 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.710
 bad passes and work with him 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.340
 becomes impossible by this advice 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.490
 once a week 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.469
 it's better to paint something a little 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.079
 by picking or drawing to 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:07.140
 mascara flowed normally or if you 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:09.000
 fully painted in their work and in 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.830
 next week don't plan it 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.870
 use 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:15.050
 it's better to just wash it after work 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:18.110
 in room temperature water under the tap 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.890
 video how wash zograf look at 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.160
 our channel 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:24.290
 izografy sold always empty 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.140
 so in order to start them 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.570
 use you need to buy immediately 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.180
 special ink for him the thing is 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:34.790
 what is this special ink for and 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:37.340
 Zograf directly company itself 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:40.250
 rotring ink from other manufacturers and 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.650
 for other purposes will not fit or your 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:45.740
 risograph will be clogged and will not be suitable 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:48.020
 for work I read a lot on the forums that 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:50.290
 People refueled zograf not special 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:52.310
 in ink and he fell into disrepair 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.310
 so along with and behind the graph 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:58.280
 purchase immediately special brand 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:00.230
 ink for and zograf same brand and you 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.990
 save yourself from many problems and 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:05.450
 buy immediately with a margin not to 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:07.370
 order several times and third 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:10.430
 item is a writing node 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:11.360
 its tip is the most different thicknesses 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.239
 slim size 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:17.060
 needle sharp and makes very thin 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:19.489
 line after drawing and zograf 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.769
 you must immediately close the cap to 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:24.080
 don't dry out and watch out for no hasp in 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:26.480
 further regularly paint it or 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:28.730
 immediately after work rinse in new 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.489
 video I will tell you how to fill and 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:33.890
 zograf will show how he draws and what 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:35.750
 whether dimensions cannot be done as he leads 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.780
 yourself on paper and there will be a separate movie 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:41.150
