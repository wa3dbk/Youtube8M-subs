00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:07.120
 in this video I'm going to give you some 

00:00:03.159 --> 00:00:10.110
 tips to form the cross the cube 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:13.170
 rubik and more paper 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:16.460
 to start on these others can 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:19.710
 improve with a lot of practice 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:22.250
 because it's really a pretty step 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.250
 intuitive 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.420
 there are algorithms for this 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:31.470
 just look for the most optimal way to 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:34.369
 form our cross 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.369
 for example 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.770
 is to get ahead 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:45.090
 and as much as possible memorize everything to the 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:48.690
 cross this is going to be our little face 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:51.480
 what he did here like this is could you take 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.550
 as if he were already in his place because 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.239
 it is very easy to accommodate then this is 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.239
 would form one hundred 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.229
 very easy 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.530
 and another example 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:22.780
 as you can see in basic green in 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:25.590
 orange if I lower it 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.590
 comfortable 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:31.930
 so 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:31.930
 because I can do 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.740
 check this out 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.130
 and it is already 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.740
 some advice I should give them 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.299
 for 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.299
 and improving with their crosses 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:01.860
 memorize memorize learn is finished 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.860
 very well 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:10.340
 and seek to put opposite for example already 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.600
 be that orange or put clothes and what 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.600
 you can simply download 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:19.260
 here I can see how it is here back 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:24.950
 blue 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.950
 and pushed twice this to accommodate 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.650
 I know how low 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.650
 what I had here 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:51.460
 you can also try to use this 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:54.610
 this only that there is already requires 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:58.170
 too much practice 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:00.370
 with this 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:03.540
 the green how comfortable 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.540
 once the two 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.659
 like this I can 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.150
 I was drying 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:16.700
 how 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:32.360
 and we go to another thing that counts for 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:37.050
 make the cross easier or no more 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:40.640
 quick but for the cube in 5 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:40.640
 I have clothes and in position 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:11.210
 in these 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:17.830
 and the push is going to go down the 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.830
 orange 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:23.340
 and I know you have a touch 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:23.340
 and ready 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:34.410
 of people 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:34.410
 you can never take advantage of this 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:39.170
 to be a step called cross 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:46.750
 I really do not know how to do it 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:50.370
 but 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:53.940
 in this way he came to perform 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:55.650
 I know that blue is opposite to green and red to 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:58.020
 orange 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:00.259
 with your study in position and I look for my 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.259
 corner 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:03.670
 how 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:08.720
 reported this all this block 

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:14.389
 minicross 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:30.660
 well that's the basic idea of ​​the former cross 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:33.830
 and we go with 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:33.830
 this last idea 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:39.320
 and here 

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:42.650
 for example that we have this case 

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:46.370
 I'm here for sure 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:48.490
 it would be a matter of saving it until 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:52.410
 in being inserted 

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:52.410
 and here I'm going to do my cross 

00:05:55.320 --> 00:06:00.810
 As you can see, I'm missing this but it's 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:02.580
 very important to demonstrate the whole cross 

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:06.730
 You will be here as I said 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:10.120
 in a faith tutorial it did not come out 

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:10.120
 and it is already 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:24.920
 and well, well 

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:29.030
 above all practice practical practice and 

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:29.030
 I wish it had helped them
