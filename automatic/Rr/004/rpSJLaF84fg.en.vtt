the exhaust up under the seat which is
good-looking<00:01:15.890> and<00:01:16.890> it<00:01:17.220> will<00:01:17.340> save<00:01:17.549> your

drawback is when you do that you

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.060 
drawback is when you do that you

on<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.380> side<00:01:49.470> I<00:01:49.710> actually<00:01:51.229> had<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.350> money<00:01:52.560> to

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
on the side I actually had the money to

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.830 
on the side I actually had the money to
buy<00:01:52.890> a<00:01:53.189> little<00:01:53.759> bit<00:01:53.880> newer<00:01:54.090> bike<00:01:54.390> and<00:01:54.720> I<00:01:54.780> do

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
buy a little bit newer bike and I do

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.510 
buy a little bit newer bike and I do
like<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.500> way<00:01:55.619> it<00:01:55.770> looks<00:01:55.979> with<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:56.250> pipe

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
like the way it looks with the pipe

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.670 
like the way it looks with the pipe
underneath<00:01:56.880> but<00:01:57.750> there<00:01:57.960> are<00:01:58.049> advantages<00:01:58.350> to

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
underneath but there are advantages to

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.249 
underneath but there are advantages to
this<00:01:58.920> one<00:01:59.189> I<00:01:59.520> think<00:01:59.790> outweigh<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.390> others<00:02:01.159> so

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:03.259 
this one I think outweigh the others so

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:07.969 
this one I think outweigh the others so
let's<00:02:04.259> fire<00:02:04.500> it<00:02:04.530> up<00:02:04.770> and<00:02:05.070> see<00:02:05.189> how<00:02:05.219> it<00:02:05.520> runs<00:02:06.979> the

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
let's fire it up and see how it runs the

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.620 
let's fire it up and see how it runs the
mileage<00:02:08.369> on<00:02:08.610> it

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
mileage on it

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.570 
mileage on it
as<00:02:10.230> you<00:02:10.380> can<00:02:10.440> see<00:02:10.650> from<00:02:10.830> looking<00:02:10.860> at<00:02:11.160> this<00:02:11.340> it's

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
as you can see from looking at this it's

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.410 
as you can see from looking at this it's
got<00:02:11.640> 20<00:02:12.800> 3243<00:02:13.800> a<00:02:14.250> bike<00:02:15.030> that's<00:02:15.330> been

this one has with frequent oil changes

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.020 
this one has with frequent oil changes
and<00:02:21.260> good<00:02:22.260> maintenance<00:02:22.530> will<00:02:23.460> usually<00:02:23.670> go

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
and good maintenance will usually go

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.150 
and good maintenance will usually go
around<00:02:24.150> 50,000<00:02:25.110> miles<00:02:25.290> so<00:02:25.590> it's<00:02:25.770> only<00:02:25.950> about

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
around 50,000 miles so it's only about

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:32.390 
around 50,000 miles so it's only about
halfway<00:02:27.350> through<00:02:28.350> its<00:02:28.500> life<00:02:28.710> cycle<00:02:31.220> if<00:02:32.220> you

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
halfway through its life cycle if you

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.990 
halfway through its life cycle if you
look<00:02:32.580> here

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
look here

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.900 
look here
the<00:02:34.390> temperature<00:02:34.900> gauge<00:02:35.140> and<00:02:35.530> as<00:02:36.460> you<00:02:36.610> can<00:02:36.730> see

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
the temperature gauge and as you can see

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.270 
the temperature gauge and as you can see
there's<00:02:37.390> no<00:02:37.660> input<00:02:38.110> there<00:02:38.380> that<00:02:38.860> means<00:02:39.100> if

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
there's no input there that means if

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.430 
there's no input there that means if
this<00:02:39.430> bike<00:02:39.670> is<00:02:39.940> cold<00:02:40.240> it<00:02:40.480> hasn't<00:02:40.900> been<00:02:41.020> warmed

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
but I do have one we'll see what happens

I got the black ones I ordered these to
be<00:03:46.220> cut<00:03:46.460> and<00:03:47.240> put<00:03:47.990> those<00:03:48.170> on<00:03:48.490> including<00:03:49.490> a

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:51.740 
little Honda one that goes up underneath

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:55.780 
little Honda one that goes up underneath
the<00:03:52.040> tire<00:03:52.280> in<00:03:52.640> that<00:03:53.650> concave<00:03:54.650> section<00:03:55.640> that

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
the tire in that concave section that

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:00.010 
the tire in that concave section that
you<00:03:55.850> see<00:03:56.030> there<00:03:57.730> along<00:03:58.730> with<00:03:58.760> the<00:03:59.090> turn<00:03:59.600> signal

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:00.020 
you see there along with the turn signal

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:03.820 
you see there along with the turn signal
eliminator<00:04:00.530> kit<00:04:00.860> it's<00:04:01.700> got<00:04:02.120> the<00:04:02.330> LED<00:04:02.830> lighting

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:03.830 
eliminator kit it's got the LED lighting

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:07.210 
eliminator kit it's got the LED lighting
so<00:04:04.370> it<00:04:04.610> doesn't<00:04:05.090> have<00:04:05.390> a<00:04:05.440> real<00:04:06.440> high<00:04:06.650> demand<00:04:07.040> on

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
so it doesn't have a real high demand on

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
signal of course you get the indicator

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.450 
signal of course you get the indicator
in<00:04:24.830> the<00:04:25.060> instrument<00:04:26.060> panel<00:04:26.860> we<00:04:27.860> also<00:04:27.980> get<00:04:28.310> the

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 
in the instrument panel we also get the

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.060 
in the instrument panel we also get the
effect<00:04:28.730> there<00:04:29.320> one<00:04:30.320> of<00:04:30.350> the<00:04:30.530> things<00:04:30.800> that<00:04:30.980> I

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.070 
effect there one of the things that I

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:32.680 
effect there one of the things that I
really<00:04:31.370> like<00:04:31.580> about<00:04:31.610> this<00:04:32.060> bike<00:04:32.270> one<00:04:32.540> of<00:04:32.630> the

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:32.690 
really like about this bike one of the

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:34.720 
really like about this bike one of the
things<00:04:32.870> that<00:04:33.020> I<00:04:33.110> did<00:04:33.290> to<00:04:33.500> it<00:04:33.680> is<00:04:34.190> I<00:04:34.520> did<00:04:34.700> the

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:34.730 
things that I did to it is I did the

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:37.270 
things that I did to it is I did the
turn<00:04:35.000> signals<00:04:35.510> up<00:04:35.660> on<00:04:35.840> the<00:04:35.960> mirror<00:04:36.230> those<00:04:37.070> are

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 
turn signals up on the mirror those are

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.240 
turn signals up on the mirror those are
up<00:04:37.430> high<00:04:37.670> so<00:04:38.060> that<00:04:38.090> traffic<00:04:38.480> can<00:04:39.050> see<00:04:39.350> them<00:04:39.560> the

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.250 
up high so that traffic can see them the

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:42.730 
up high so that traffic can see them the
ones<00:04:40.460> that<00:04:40.640> you<00:04:40.760> have<00:04:40.940> in<00:04:41.120> the<00:04:41.240> side<00:04:41.740> while

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
ones that you have in the side while

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.770 
ones that you have in the side while
they're<00:04:42.950> required<00:04:43.490> and<00:04:43.940> that's<00:04:44.090> the<00:04:44.300> factory

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:44.780 
they're required and that's the factory

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:46.840 
they're required and that's the factory
look<00:04:44.990> these<00:04:45.740> are<00:04:45.950> much<00:04:46.100> better<00:04:46.400> because

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:46.850 
look these are much better because

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:49.000 
look these are much better because
they're<00:04:47.030> up<00:04:47.180> at<00:04:47.330> the<00:04:47.510> eye<00:04:47.780> level<00:04:48.110> of<00:04:48.740> the<00:04:48.860> other

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.010 
they're up at the eye level of the other

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:52.890 
they're up at the eye level of the other
drivers<00:04:49.580> it<00:04:50.360> makes<00:04:50.630> for<00:04:50.750> a<00:04:50.930> safer<00:04:51.320> bike

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:52.900 
drivers it makes for a safer bike

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.750 
drivers it makes for a safer bike
speaking<00:04:53.900> of<00:04:53.990> a<00:04:54.080> safe<00:04:54.290> bike<00:04:54.590> when<00:04:55.460> you<00:04:55.580> look

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:55.760 
speaking of a safe bike when you look

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.760 
speaking of a safe bike when you look
into<00:04:55.970> these<00:04:56.210> you'll<00:04:57.080> think<00:04:57.380> that<00:04:57.620> they're

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:57.770 
into these you'll think that they're

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:59.140 
into these you'll think that they're
dangerous<00:04:58.190> because<00:04:58.340> they're<00:04:58.520> a<00:04:58.550> sport<00:04:58.940> bike

00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.150 
dangerous because they're a sport bike

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:02.590 
dangerous because they're a sport bike
but<00:05:00.050> they<00:05:00.230> have<00:05:00.410> amazing<00:05:00.770> braking<00:05:01.520> power<00:05:01.760> you

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:02.600 
but they have amazing braking power you

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.050 
but they have amazing braking power you
have<00:05:02.870> dual<00:05:03.260> piston<00:05:03.980> you<00:05:04.370> see<00:05:04.610> that<00:05:04.790> there's<00:05:05.000> a

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.060 
have dual piston you see that there's a

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.300 
have dual piston you see that there's a
circle<00:05:05.510> here<00:05:05.750> in<00:05:05.870> a<00:05:05.960> circle<00:05:06.350> here<00:05:06.650> you'll

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.310 
circle here in a circle here you'll

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:10.540 
circle here in a circle here you'll
piston<00:05:07.850> calipers<00:05:08.480> on<00:05:08.780> each<00:05:09.620> side<00:05:10.040> so<00:05:10.070> you<00:05:10.400> got

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:10.550 
piston calipers on each side so you got

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:12.909 
piston calipers on each side so you got
four<00:05:10.820> pissed<00:05:11.180> well<00:05:11.630> there's<00:05:12.410> two<00:05:12.590> for<00:05:12.830> each

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:12.919 
four pissed well there's two for each

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:15.900 
four pissed well there's two for each
side<00:05:13.450> so<00:05:14.450> you<00:05:14.510> got<00:05:14.780> a<00:05:14.810> lot<00:05:15.080> of<00:05:15.110> braking<00:05:15.620> power

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:15.910 
side so you got a lot of braking power

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:18.640 
side so you got a lot of braking power
of<00:05:16.910> course<00:05:17.150> disc<00:05:17.480> brake<00:05:17.810> so<00:05:18.110> they<00:05:18.230> do<00:05:18.290> well

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:18.650 
of course disc brake so they do well

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:21.460 
of course disc brake so they do well
even<00:05:19.280> when<00:05:19.370> they're<00:05:19.520> wet<00:05:20.080> you<00:05:21.080> look<00:05:21.260> at<00:05:21.380> the

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:21.470 
even when they're wet you look at the

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:23.150 
even when they're wet you look at the
back<00:05:21.650> sprocket<00:05:22.040> you<00:05:22.490> can

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.160 
back sprocket you can

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.730 
back sprocket you can
teas<00:05:23.370> still<00:05:23.640> have<00:05:23.970> a<00:05:24.000> lot<00:05:24.360> of<00:05:24.390> life<00:05:24.750> left<00:05:25.140> this

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:25.740 
teas still have a lot of life left this

it's ready to go you can see that the

00:06:15.659 --> 00:06:19.989 
it's ready to go you can see that the
temperature<00:06:16.080> gauge<00:06:16.259> is<00:06:16.529> up<00:06:17.219> to<00:06:17.399> 150<00:06:18.059> now<00:06:18.619> 151
