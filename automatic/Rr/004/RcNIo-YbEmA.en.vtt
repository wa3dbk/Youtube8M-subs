00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
there so how difficult mentally is it

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.479 
there so how difficult mentally is it
gonna<00:02:08.599> be<00:02:08.780> to<00:02:08.840> get<00:02:09.349> back<00:02:09.530> to<00:02:09.769> playing<00:02:10.160> rugby

gonna be to get back to playing rugby
again<00:02:10.789> I<00:02:11.000> think<00:02:11.959> it<00:02:12.170> would<00:02:12.500> be<00:02:12.620> tough<00:02:13.750> you've

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
again I think it would be tough you've

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.050 
again I think it would be tough you've
been<00:02:14.959> to<00:02:15.080> and<00:02:15.410> a<00:02:15.709> lot<00:02:16.040> of<00:02:16.069> rugby<00:02:16.610> players<00:02:16.819> have

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
been to and a lot of rugby players have

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.710 
been to and a lot of rugby players have
so<00:02:18.099> I'll<00:02:19.099> just<00:02:19.310> structurally<00:02:20.120> that<00:02:20.330> he's

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
so I'll just structurally that he's

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:21.759 
so I'll just structurally that he's
going<00:02:20.840> to<00:02:20.900> be<00:02:21.019> saying<00:02:21.290> it's<00:02:21.500> gonna<00:02:21.590> be

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:21.769 
going to be saying it's gonna be

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:23.440 
going to be saying it's gonna be
mentally<00:02:22.220> preparing<00:02:22.700> yourself<00:02:23.060> to<00:02:23.120> get<00:02:23.300> back

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
mentally preparing yourself to get back

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:24.160 
mentally preparing yourself to get back
on<00:02:23.569> the<00:02:23.629> park<00:02:23.870> again

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
on the park again

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.190 
on the park again
yeah<00:02:24.489> um<00:02:25.489> I<00:02:25.580> think<00:02:26.420> you<00:02:26.780> know<00:02:26.840> the<00:02:26.959> amount<00:02:27.170> of

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
yeah um I think you know the amount of

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.170 
yeah um I think you know the amount of
hard<00:02:27.410> work<00:02:27.470> you<00:02:27.739> put<00:02:27.769> in<00:02:28.069> by<00:02:28.489> the<00:02:28.519> time<00:02:28.819> you<00:02:29.000> get

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
hard work you put in by the time you get

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.210 
hard work you put in by the time you get
nine<00:02:29.750> months<00:02:30.050> down<00:02:30.140> the<00:02:30.260> track<00:02:30.349> you<00:02:30.830> just

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
nine months down the track you just

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.069 
nine months down the track you just
itching<00:02:31.580> to<00:02:31.670> get<00:02:31.760> out<00:02:31.909> there<00:02:32.060> again<00:02:32.090> and<00:02:32.540> I<00:02:32.749> you

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:33.079 
itching to get out there again and I you

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:34.209 
itching to get out there again and I you
know<00:02:33.140> I<00:02:33.200> think<00:02:33.290> that<00:02:33.530> that<00:02:33.739> will<00:02:33.829> be<00:02:33.920> the<00:02:33.950> case

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:34.219 
know I think that that will be the case

00:02:34.219 --> 00:02:36.610 
know I think that that will be the case
I<00:02:34.519> guess<00:02:35.030> when<00:02:35.180> you're<00:02:35.299> rehabbing<00:02:35.780> you're

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
I guess when you're rehabbing you're

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
I guess when you're rehabbing you're
putting<00:02:36.920> in<00:02:37.010> a<00:02:37.280> lot

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
putting in a lot

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.430 
putting in a lot
hard<00:02:37.850> work<00:02:38.090> you<00:02:38.510> know<00:02:38.569> five<00:02:38.870> six<00:02:38.900> days<00:02:39.260> a<00:02:39.319> week

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
hard work you know five six days a week

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.250 
hard work you know five six days a week
and<00:02:39.860> then<00:02:40.220> wearing<00:02:41.120> a<00:02:41.210> suit<00:02:41.420> and<00:02:41.569> watching<00:02:42.170> the

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
and then wearing a suit and watching the

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.140 
and then wearing a suit and watching the
game<00:02:42.410> it's<00:02:43.190> not<00:02:43.310> quite<00:02:43.520> the<00:02:43.640> same<00:02:43.819> when<00:02:44.000> you

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
game it's not quite the same when you

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:45.880 
game it's not quite the same when you
get<00:02:44.420> out<00:02:44.540> of<00:02:44.660> the<00:02:44.720> changer<00:02:45.080> what<00:02:45.680> would<00:02:45.800> it

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
get out of the changer what would it

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.980 
get out of the changer what would it
mean<00:02:46.040> for<00:02:46.100> you<00:02:46.340> to<00:02:46.520> play<00:02:46.730> in<00:02:47.090> the<00:02:47.330> gold<00:02:47.569> jersey

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:47.990 
mean for you to play in the gold jersey

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:49.300 
mean for you to play in the gold jersey

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
again whether it's the end of season

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.180 
again whether it's the end of season
tour<00:02:49.700> or<00:02:49.940> whether<00:02:50.090> it's<00:02:50.330> in<00:02:50.830> 2015<00:02:51.830> is<00:02:52.069> that

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
tour or whether it's in 2015 is that

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.220 
tour or whether it's in 2015 is that
something<00:02:52.550> that<00:02:52.580> you<00:02:53.480> can<00:02:53.600> is<00:02:53.870> it<00:02:54.050> something

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
something that you can is it something

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.020 
something that you can is it something
that's<00:02:54.380> a<00:02:54.500> goal<00:02:55.040> of<00:02:55.070> yours<00:02:55.459> or<00:02:55.670> you<00:02:55.760> just<00:02:55.910> want

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
that's a goal of yours or you just want

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.730 
that's a goal of yours or you just want
to<00:02:56.060> see<00:02:56.270> how<00:02:56.780> your<00:02:56.930> knee<00:02:57.050> goes<00:02:57.260> and<00:02:57.470> get<00:02:57.560> back

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:57.740 
to see how your knee goes and get back

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.980 
to see how your knee goes and get back
to<00:02:57.860> a<00:02:57.890> normal<00:02:58.040> life<00:02:58.310> at<00:02:58.520> first<00:02:58.700> I<00:02:59.000> think<00:02:59.600> I

00:02:59.980 --> 00:02:59.990 
to a normal life at first I think I

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:02.050 
to a normal life at first I think I
think<00:03:00.170> you<00:03:00.260> have<00:03:00.380> to<00:03:00.610> focus<00:03:01.610> on<00:03:01.850> the<00:03:01.940> knee

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
think you have to focus on the knee

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.150 
think you have to focus on the knee
first<00:03:02.300> boots<00:03:02.570> I<00:03:02.900> mean<00:03:03.290> it's<00:03:03.440> obviously<00:03:03.860> a<00:03:03.950> goal

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
first boots I mean it's obviously a goal

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.210 
first boots I mean it's obviously a goal
um<00:03:04.820> now<00:03:05.750> I've<00:03:06.050> loved<00:03:06.620> every<00:03:06.860> minute<00:03:06.980> in<00:03:07.160> the

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
um now I've loved every minute in the

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:08.800 
um now I've loved every minute in the
world<00:03:07.370> B's<00:03:07.550> Jersey<00:03:07.940> and<00:03:08.060> I'd<00:03:08.150> love<00:03:08.540> to<00:03:08.720> get

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
world B's Jersey and I'd love to get

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.220 
world B's Jersey and I'd love to get
back<00:03:08.989> there<00:03:10.480> at<00:03:11.480> the<00:03:11.540> moment<00:03:11.690> seems<00:03:12.020> like<00:03:12.200> a

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
back there at the moment seems like a

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.979 
back there at the moment seems like a
long<00:03:13.040> way<00:03:13.190> off<00:03:13.220> so<00:03:13.700> I<00:03:14.000> guess<00:03:14.390> the<00:03:14.690> you<00:03:14.840> know<00:03:14.900> the

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 
long way off so I guess the you know the

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:18.310 
long way off so I guess the you know the
focus<00:03:15.200> is<00:03:15.380> getting<00:03:15.500> the<00:03:15.680> knee<00:03:15.800> right<00:03:16.480> and<00:03:17.480> just

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320 
focus is getting the knee right and just

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:19.720 
focus is getting the knee right and just
seeing<00:03:18.530> how<00:03:18.650> long<00:03:18.800> it<00:03:18.920> takes<00:03:19.130> I<00:03:19.370> guess<00:03:19.400> being

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
seeing how long it takes I guess being

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:20.920 
seeing how long it takes I guess being
being<00:03:20.030> a<00:03:20.090> second<00:03:20.390> one<00:03:20.510> you've<00:03:20.630> got<00:03:20.660> to<00:03:20.780> be<00:03:20.900> a

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
being a second one you've got to be a

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.560 
being a second one you've got to be a
bit<00:03:21.050> more<00:03:21.200> conservative<00:03:22.180> so<00:03:23.180> I'll<00:03:23.239> do<00:03:23.420> that

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570 
bit more conservative so I'll do that

number<00:03:38.690> of<00:03:38.720> occasions<00:03:39.910> how<00:03:40.910> difficult

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
number of occasions how difficult

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.750

mentally<00:03:41.959> will<00:03:42.140> it<00:03:42.260> be<00:03:42.410> for<00:03:42.739> him<00:03:42.890> to<00:03:43.160> get<00:03:43.549> back

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
mentally will it be for him to get back

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.390 
mentally will it be for him to get back
to<00:03:43.910> his<00:03:44.090> best<00:03:44.329> oh<00:03:44.630> that's<00:03:45.590> a<00:03:45.709> big<00:03:45.829> challenge<00:03:46.100> I

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
to his best oh that's a big challenge I

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:47.949 
to his best oh that's a big challenge I
think<00:03:46.489> obviously<00:03:47.239> there's<00:03:47.480> a<00:03:47.540> big<00:03:47.720> physical

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
think obviously there's a big physical

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:50.560 
think obviously there's a big physical
element<00:03:48.560> but<00:03:48.950> mentally<00:03:49.340> it's<00:03:49.519> it's<00:03:50.000> taxing

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:50.570 
element but mentally it's it's taxing

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:52.810 
element but mentally it's it's taxing
and<00:03:50.780> obviously<00:03:51.170> it<00:03:51.320> takes<00:03:51.470> a<00:03:51.650> while<00:03:51.799> to<00:03:52.070> get

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:52.820 
and obviously it takes a while to get

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:54.280 
and obviously it takes a while to get
back<00:03:52.850> to<00:03:53.209> the<00:03:53.299> level<00:03:53.570> you<00:03:53.660> were<00:03:53.780> and<00:03:53.989> I<00:03:54.049> think

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
back to the level you were and I think

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.860 
back to the level you were and I think
every<00:03:54.829> the<00:03:55.370> thing<00:03:55.579> the<00:03:55.760> danger<00:03:55.790> I've<00:03:56.239> gotten

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
every the thing the danger I've gotten

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:58.270 
every the thing the danger I've gotten
he's<00:03:57.019> got<00:03:57.260> is<00:03:57.380> that<00:03:57.530> we're<00:03:57.709> going<00:03:57.829> to<00:03:57.920> be

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
he's got is that we're going to be

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.850 
he's got is that we're going to be
compared<00:03:58.790> to<00:03:58.880> what<00:03:59.090> we<00:03:59.269> were<00:03:59.420> before<00:03:59.600> or<00:04:00.440> our

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:00.860 
compared to what we were before or our

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:03.489
