you<00:00:35.000> know<00:00:35.210> when<00:00:35.359> that<00:00:35.449> video<00:00:35.539> drops<00:00:35.929> but<00:00:36.230> in

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.320 
you know when that video drops but in

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.750 
you know when that video drops but in
the<00:00:36.379> meantime<00:00:36.559> let's<00:00:37.039> take<00:00:37.190> a<00:00:37.219> look<00:00:37.429> at<00:00:37.579> some

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
the meantime let's take a look at some

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.669 
the meantime let's take a look at some
of<00:00:37.820> the<00:00:37.940> other<00:00:37.969> options<00:00:38.539> so<00:00:39.320> let's<00:00:39.469> kick<00:00:39.589> it

00:00:39.669 --> 00:00:39.679 
of the other options so let's kick it

00:00:39.679 --> 00:00:41.410 
of the other options so let's kick it
off<00:00:39.769> with<00:00:39.829> the<00:00:40.160> tactical<00:00:40.579> abilities<00:00:40.969> so<00:00:41.269> there

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420 
off with the tactical abilities so there

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.180 
off with the tactical abilities so there
are<00:00:41.539> three<00:00:41.870> of<00:00:41.960> these<00:00:42.079> there's<00:00:42.440> cloak<00:00:42.679> stem

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190 
are three of these there's cloak stem

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.459 
are three of these there's cloak stem
and<00:00:43.399> active<00:00:43.940> radar<00:00:44.149> post<00:00:44.480> personally<00:00:45.260> i<00:00:45.289> think

00:00:45.459 --> 00:00:45.469 
and active radar post personally i think

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:46.840 
and active radar post personally i think
thats<00:00:45.859> tim<00:00:46.010> is<00:00:46.100> just<00:00:46.249> the<00:00:46.309> best<00:00:46.429> ways<00:00:46.640> you<00:00:46.760> know

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:46.850 
thats tim is just the best ways you know

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:48.520 
thats tim is just the best ways you know
you<00:00:46.909> get<00:00:47.120> across<00:00:47.300> the<00:00:47.449> map<00:00:47.570> a<00:00:47.600> lot<00:00:47.749> faster<00:00:47.899> also

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 
you get across the map a lot faster also

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:49.930 
you get across the map a lot faster also
if<00:00:48.649> you<00:00:48.769> pair<00:00:48.949> up<00:00:49.100> with<00:00:49.219> your<00:00:49.370> parkour<00:00:49.760> in<00:00:49.820> your

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:49.940 
if you pair up with your parkour in your

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:51.250 
if you pair up with your parkour in your
wall<00:00:50.089> running<00:00:50.269> it<00:00:50.659> allows<00:00:50.870> you<00:00:50.989> to<00:00:51.079> travel

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
wall running it allows you to travel

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:52.750 
wall running it allows you to travel
greater<00:00:51.589> distances<00:00:52.100> so<00:00:52.309> you<00:00:52.370> know<00:00:52.489> i<00:00:52.519> just

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
greater distances so you know i just

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:53.979 
greater distances so you know i just
don't<00:00:52.909> really<00:00:52.969> see<00:00:53.300> any<00:00:53.569> need<00:00:53.749> to<00:00:53.780> use

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989 
don't really see any need to use

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:55.750 
don't really see any need to use
anything<00:00:54.170> else<00:00:54.379> but<00:00:54.739> i<00:00:54.980> mean<00:00:55.339> you<00:00:55.460> know<00:00:55.489> what

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
anything else but i mean you know what

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.000 
anything else but i mean you know what
why<00:00:55.940> do<00:00:55.999> you<00:00:56.120> particularly<00:00:56.480> like<00:00:56.659> my<00:00:57.109> cloak<00:00:57.350> so

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
why do you particularly like my cloak so

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.430 
why do you particularly like my cloak so
for<00:00:58.219> me<00:00:58.339> cloak<00:00:58.789> is<00:00:58.999> better<00:00:59.210> than<00:00:59.420> stim<00:00:59.809> because

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
for me cloak is better than stim because

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.529 
for me cloak is better than stim because
you<00:01:00.589> can<00:01:00.769> hide<00:01:01.100> from<00:01:01.579> tightens<00:01:02.120> and<00:01:02.329> tightens

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:02.539 
you can hide from tightens and tightens

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:04.870 
you can hide from tightens and tightens
and<00:01:03.019> the<00:01:03.260> big<00:01:03.409> powerhouses<00:01:03.890> of<00:01:04.190> the<00:01:04.400> game<00:01:04.580> if

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:04.880 
and the big powerhouses of the game if

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:06.250 
and the big powerhouses of the game if
you<00:01:05.059> can<00:01:05.180> hide<00:01:05.360> from<00:01:05.390> them<00:01:05.690> you're<00:01:06.050> more

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:06.260 
you can hide from them you're more

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.080 
you can hide from them you're more
likely<00:01:06.470> to<00:01:06.710> survive<00:01:06.860> also<00:01:07.760> if<00:01:07.970> you're

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
likely to survive also if you're

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:09.880 
likely to survive also if you're
flanking<00:01:08.450> around<00:01:08.630> the<00:01:08.690> map<00:01:08.870> it<00:01:09.080> does<00:01:09.350> help<00:01:09.620> to

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
flanking around the map it does help to

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.460 
flanking around the map it does help to
be<00:01:10.160> a<00:01:10.190> little<00:01:10.460> less<00:01:10.730> noticeable<00:01:11.420> alright<00:01:12.350> so

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
be a little less noticeable alright so

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:13.930 
be a little less noticeable alright so
lastly<00:01:12.740> there<00:01:12.920> is<00:01:12.950> obviously<00:01:13.160> active<00:01:13.730> radar

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:13.940 
lastly there is obviously active radar

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
lastly there is obviously active radar
pulse<00:01:14.240> so<00:01:14.390> what<00:01:14.510> do<00:01:14.570> you<00:01:14.630> think<00:01:14.750> about<00:01:14.780> that

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
pulse so what do you think about that

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.710 
pulse so what do you think about that
one<00:01:15.100> active<00:01:16.100> radar<00:01:16.400> pulse<00:01:16.700> for<00:01:17.030> me<00:01:17.180> is<00:01:17.390> a<00:01:17.420> bit

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 
one active radar pulse for me is a bit

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.020 
one active radar pulse for me is a bit
of<00:01:17.900> a<00:01:18.080> gimmick<00:01:18.410> the<00:01:18.920> way<00:01:19.040> it<00:01:19.160> works<00:01:19.400> is<00:01:19.670> an

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
of a gimmick the way it works is an

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.420 
of a gimmick the way it works is an
x-ray<00:01:20.780> which<00:01:21.080> kind<00:01:21.290> of<00:01:21.350> pops<00:01:21.560> up<00:01:21.740> momentarily

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430 
x-ray which kind of pops up momentarily

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.330 
x-ray which kind of pops up momentarily
and<00:01:22.910> for<00:01:23.330> me<00:01:23.450> it<00:01:23.690> has<00:01:23.720> limited<00:01:24.290> use<00:01:24.530> the<00:01:25.160> one

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
and for me it has limited use the one

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:26.830 
and for me it has limited use the one
time<00:01:25.520> I<00:01:25.550> think<00:01:25.640> it<00:01:25.880> would<00:01:26.030> be<00:01:26.060> useful<00:01:26.300> we<00:01:26.690> if

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
time I think it would be useful we if

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.030 
time I think it would be useful we if
you're<00:01:26.870> trying<00:01:27.170> to<00:01:27.260> learn<00:01:27.410> say<00:01:27.650> a<00:01:27.680> new<00:01:27.860> map

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.040 
you're trying to learn say a new map

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.020 
you're trying to learn say a new map
because<00:01:28.220> especially<00:01:28.460> if<00:01:28.670> they're<00:01:28.790> a<00:01:28.820> lot<00:01:28.910> of

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
because especially if they're a lot of

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:30.190 
because especially if they're a lot of
kind<00:01:29.180> of<00:01:29.240> tight<00:01:29.390> corridors<00:01:29.690> and<00:01:29.900> you<00:01:29.990> want<00:01:30.140> to

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
kind of tight corridors and you want to

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.330 
kind of tight corridors and you want to
sort<00:01:30.350> of<00:01:30.410> like<00:01:30.560> you<00:01:30.890> know<00:01:30.920> you<00:01:31.040> don't<00:01:31.250> know

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
sort of like you know you don't know

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:32.740 
sort of like you know you don't know
what's<00:01:31.490> round<00:01:31.610> the<00:01:31.700> corner<00:01:31.760> then<00:01:32.450> you<00:01:32.570> know<00:01:32.660> it

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
what's round the corner then you know it

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.000 
what's round the corner then you know it
might<00:01:32.840> be<00:01:32.870> handy<00:01:33.110> to<00:01:33.230> at<00:01:33.380> least<00:01:33.470> bit<00:01:33.650> of<00:01:33.740> sea<00:01:33.860> to

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:34.010 
might be handy to at least bit of sea to

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.220 
might be handy to at least bit of sea to
the<00:01:34.040> wall<00:01:34.250> but<00:01:34.940> anyway<00:01:35.240> that<00:01:35.510> is<00:01:35.540> obviously

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:36.230 
the wall but anyway that is obviously

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:37.720 
the wall but anyway that is obviously
the<00:01:36.320> tactical<00:01:36.680> ability<00:01:37.010> so<00:01:37.220> moving<00:01:37.490> on<00:01:37.580> you

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:37.730 
the tactical ability so moving on you

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:39.400 
the tactical ability so moving on you
now<00:01:37.880> have<00:01:38.060> ordinance<00:01:38.570> now<00:01:38.780> this<00:01:38.960> is<00:01:39.170> kind<00:01:39.320> of

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:39.410 
now have ordinance now this is kind of

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:40.450 
now have ordinance now this is kind of
like<00:01:39.500> you<00:01:39.650> know<00:01:39.680> you'll<00:01:39.860> projectile<00:01:40.310> your

electrical equipment in the area so for

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.590 
electrical equipment in the area so for
instance<00:01:52.100> people<00:01:52.730> in<00:01:52.820> Titans<00:01:53.270> get<00:01:53.480> their

similar<00:01:55.730> effect<00:01:56.080> satchel<00:01:57.080> charges<00:01:57.410> are<00:01:57.680> like

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:57.800 
similar effect satchel charges are like

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.500 
similar effect satchel charges are like
mines<00:01:58.160> that<00:01:58.370> you<00:01:58.550> can<00:01:58.700> place<00:01:58.910> around<00:01:59.150> the<00:01:59.300> map

00:01:59.500 --> 00:01:59.510 
mines that you can place around the map

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.350 
mines that you can place around the map
and<00:01:59.750> then<00:01:59.870> detonate<00:02:00.440> manually<00:02:00.980> the<00:02:01.700> arc<00:02:01.970> mine

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
and then detonate manually the arc mine

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.270 
and then detonate manually the arc mine
is<00:02:02.570> interesting<00:02:03.260> because<00:02:03.380> it's<00:02:03.590> basically<00:02:04.010> a

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
is interesting because it's basically a

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.150 
is interesting because it's basically a
mixture<00:02:04.730> of<00:02:05.030> the<00:02:05.450> last<00:02:05.690> two<00:02:06.020> it<00:02:06.650> uses<00:02:07.130> the

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:07.160 
mixture of the last two it uses the

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.520 
mixture of the last two it uses the
effects<00:02:07.760> of<00:02:07.970> the<00:02:08.179> arc<00:02:08.360> grenade<00:02:08.810> with<00:02:09.349> the

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
effects of the arc grenade with the

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.369 
effects of the arc grenade with the
application<00:02:10.280> of<00:02:10.519> the<00:02:10.609> sexual<00:02:10.909> charge<00:02:11.379> however

00:02:12.369 --> 00:02:12.379 
application of the sexual charge however

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:14.590 
application of the sexual charge however
unlike<00:02:12.620> the<00:02:13.129> satchel<00:02:13.459> charge<00:02:13.730> it<00:02:13.969> detonates

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
unlike the satchel charge it detonates

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.450 
unlike the satchel charge it detonates
automatically<00:02:15.230> when<00:02:15.560> either<00:02:15.710> pilots<00:02:16.280> or

automatically when either pilots or
Titans<00:02:16.970> across<00:02:17.330> its<00:02:17.510> path<00:02:17.600> so<00:02:18.560> personally<00:02:18.950> for

close when you detonate it then it has
adverse<00:02:35.480> effects<00:02:35.750> now<00:02:36.110> next<00:02:36.320> up<00:02:36.470> you<00:02:36.620> have<00:02:36.800> the
