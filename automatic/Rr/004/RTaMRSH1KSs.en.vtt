00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.460 
traditionally we're taught to stand like
this<00:00:20.579> in<00:00:20.790> the<00:00:20.880> ready<00:00:21.060> position<00:00:21.149> and<00:00:21.720> then

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
this in the ready position and then

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.190 
this in the ready position and then
bring<00:00:22.739> the<00:00:22.860> racket<00:00:23.220> back<00:00:23.250> nice<00:00:23.880> and<00:00:24.119> flat<00:00:24.360> but

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:25.200 
bring the racket back nice and flat but

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.069 
bring the racket back nice and flat but
remember<00:00:25.739> a<00:00:25.950> flat<00:00:26.460> racket<00:00:27.000> back<00:00:27.149> here<00:00:27.630> is

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:28.079 
remember a flat racket back here is

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:30.470 
remember a flat racket back here is
going<00:00:28.349> to<00:00:28.470> give<00:00:28.739> you<00:00:28.890> an<00:00:29.040> open<00:00:29.610> face<00:00:29.910> at<00:00:30.239> the

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
going to give you an open face at the

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.049 
going to give you an open face at the
contact<00:00:30.989> point<00:00:31.130> so<00:00:32.130> what<00:00:32.250> I<00:00:32.279> recommend<00:00:32.550> is

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
contact point so what I recommend is

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.660 
contact point so what I recommend is
when<00:00:33.420> if<00:00:33.630> you're<00:00:33.809> hitting<00:00:34.590> a<00:00:34.770> forehand<00:00:35.010> you're

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
when if you're hitting a forehand you're

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.880 
when if you're hitting a forehand you're
holding<00:00:36.000> your<00:00:36.120> forehand<00:00:36.540> grip<00:00:36.810> let<00:00:37.680> the

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
holding your forehand grip let the

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.310 
holding your forehand grip let the
racket<00:00:38.250> tilt<00:00:38.520> slightly<00:00:38.940> like<00:00:39.330> this<00:00:39.600> close

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
racket tilt slightly like this close

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.710 
racket tilt slightly like this close
this<00:00:40.500> is<00:00:40.680> called<00:00:40.920> closing<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.460> face<00:00:41.760> and<00:00:42.090> as

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:42.720
