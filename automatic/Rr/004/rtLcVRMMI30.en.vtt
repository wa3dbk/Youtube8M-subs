00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 with the new addition disney infinity 20 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.270
 create magic boxes with toys 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.790
 it became even easier 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:13.620
 I will talk about how to do this in 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:16.049
 a few simple steps hi i am hearty 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.420
 one of the developers of disney infinity 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.119
 which means that I managed to make already 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.640
 many boxes of toys i will show you 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.039
 new disney infinity 20 tools 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.160
 which will make the creation process more 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.500
 fast and fun and so get started 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.500
 let's start with the toy box 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.030
 terrain landscape will be created 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.440
 automatically 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:42.899
 it will help speed up the process to us 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.570
 will need new builders from disney 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.300
 infinity 20 can be placed where 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.340
 anything and they will start to create 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.800
 amazing things i like all that 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.930
 they can build but you want to do it yourself 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.719
 take part in the process so take 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.809
 just a couple of builders now it will go 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.809
 faster 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.070
 we automate the process by some 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.010
 another way 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.799
 for example, use the constructor you need 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:14.520
 set the volume and we will have a lock 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:19.880
 right size put it here he 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.880
 what hangs in the air okay let's build 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:26.369
 here we will automatically create 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.290
 pirate town accelerate a little 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.280
 process 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:34.140
 let the castle build well 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:38.120
 Well, perhaps add a new broad 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.120
 race track with sharp turns 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:45.840
 quickly-fast at this time will post 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:51.600
 several houses in the trees and again 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:53.729
 speed up and the finishing touch fragments 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:02:01.020
 urban landscape also created 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:02:03.300
 automatically while our builders 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.280
 working decorate the box with their toys 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:09.710
 favorite marvel universe buildings 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.710
 remember our wonderful acceleration 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.700
 now choose another type of landscape 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:25.680
 something I got excited will do it differently 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:28.530
 while the building is under construction I will choose 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.810
 any of these patterns are 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:34.440
 built-in mini-games can be placed 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:37.620
 wherever you want it is very convenient for you 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.420
 appear what to play is worth adding 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.110
 still fighting arena on the mountain 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:48.060
 so you can play online with friends 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:51.420
 accelerate and all this time crumbs 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:54.870
 builders continue to work passed 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:57.930
 only 5 minutes they have done so much 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.870
 works i used new tools 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.340
 to recreate the box with toys 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.930
 which you used to see in our 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:09.980
 roller skates 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:09.980
 and here he is in front of you try
