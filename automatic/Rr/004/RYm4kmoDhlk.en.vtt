00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
series of mouse pads reviews because I

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.179 
series of mouse pads reviews because I
just<00:00:17.640> got<00:00:17.789> a<00:00:18.560> first<00:00:19.560> one<00:00:19.770> up<00:00:19.920> is<00:00:20.130> the<00:00:20.550> ice<00:00:21.390> mat

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:22.189 
just got a first one up is the ice mat

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:25.009 
just got a first one up is the ice mat
which<00:00:23.189> is<00:00:23.220> a<00:00:23.519> glass<00:00:23.910> mousepad<00:00:24.390> so<00:00:24.630> basically

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
which is a glass mousepad so basically

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.550 
which is a glass mousepad so basically
this<00:00:25.619> company<00:00:26.070> ice<00:00:26.279> mat<00:00:26.580> back<00:00:27.330> in<00:00:27.510> like<00:00:27.779> 2002

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
this company ice mat back in like 2002

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.640 
this company ice mat back in like 2002
thousand<00:00:29.010> 1999<00:00:29.730> can<00:00:30.029> remember<00:00:30.599> they<00:00:31.260> came<00:00:31.470> up

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
thousand 1999 can remember they came up

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.549 
thousand 1999 can remember they came up
with<00:00:31.679> like<00:00:32.489> before<00:00:32.940> optical<00:00:33.840> mice<00:00:34.020> such<00:00:34.410> as

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
with like before optical mice such as

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.170 
with like before optical mice such as
this<00:00:34.649> one<00:00:34.829> right<00:00:34.950> here<00:00:35.219> they<00:00:35.910> don't<00:00:36.030> track<00:00:36.930> on

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:38.180 
this one right here they don't track on

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.380 
this one right here they don't track on
they<00:00:39.180> don't<00:00:39.360> track<00:00:39.600> on<00:00:39.920> class<00:00:40.920> so<00:00:41.550> ice<00:00:42.120> meant

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
they don't track on class so ice meant

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.770 
they don't track on class so ice meant
came<00:00:42.629> up<00:00:42.780> with<00:00:42.899> technology<00:00:43.110> somehow<00:00:43.710> to

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
came up with technology somehow to

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.430 
came up with technology somehow to
enable<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:46.200> optical<00:00:46.910> the<00:00:48.140> sensor<00:00:49.140> to

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
enable the optical the sensor to

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.639 
enable the optical the sensor to
basically<00:00:49.860> bounce<00:00:50.100> back<00:00:50.340> and<00:00:50.629> track<00:00:51.629> on<00:00:52.050> glass

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
basically bounce back and track on glass

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.590 
basically bounce back and track on glass
which<00:00:52.920> is<00:00:52.949> a<00:00:53.070> really<00:00:53.460> really<00:00:53.520> nifty<00:00:53.879> feature

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
which is a really really nifty feature

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.840 
which is a really really nifty feature
so<00:00:55.289> basically<00:00:55.620> this<00:00:55.980> they<00:00:56.370> came<00:00:56.550> out<00:00:56.670> with

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
so basically this they came out with

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.189 
so basically this they came out with
like<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.090> icepad<00:00:57.390> one<00:00:57.629> which<00:00:57.840> is<00:00:57.960> a<00:00:57.989> little

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
like the icepad one which is a little

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.869 
like the icepad one which is a little
bit<00:00:58.289> smaller<00:00:58.530> than<00:00:58.680> this<00:00:58.770> one<00:00:58.829> so<00:00:59.489> this<00:00:59.640> is<00:00:59.699> the

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
bit smaller than this one so this is the

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.680 
bit smaller than this one so this is the
ice<00:01:00.539> mat<00:01:00.870> second<00:01:01.260> edition<00:01:01.590> and<00:01:01.800> so<00:01:02.699> in<00:01:03.090> I<00:01:03.539> don't

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
ice mat second edition and so in I don't

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.039 
ice mat second edition and so in I don't
know<00:01:04.519> 2004-2005<00:01:05.519> I<00:01:05.970> smacked<00:01:06.570> got<00:01:06.750> bought<00:01:07.020> out

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
know 2004-2005 I smacked got bought out

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.410 
know 2004-2005 I smacked got bought out
by<00:01:07.170> US<00:01:07.530> Steel<00:01:07.710> series<00:01:08.040> so<00:01:08.310> basically<00:01:08.640> stews

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
by US Steel series so basically stews

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.570 
by US Steel series so basically stews
now<00:01:09.840> makes<00:01:10.080> a<00:01:10.290> glass<00:01:10.560> mouse<00:01:10.950> pads<00:01:11.189> as<00:01:11.340> well<00:01:11.490> of

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
now makes a glass mouse pads as well of

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.359 
now makes a glass mouse pads as well of
the<00:01:11.670> series<00:01:12.090> I<00:01:12.270> one<00:01:12.510> or<00:01:12.720> steel<00:01:13.020> series<00:01:13.200> I<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.439> if

basically what's so good about ice mat
or<00:01:41.640> a<00:01:42.180> glass<00:01:42.600> loss<00:01:42.990> pad<00:01:43.200> I<00:01:43.460> won<00:01:44.460> I<00:01:44.610> to<00:01:44.640> whatever

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
or a glass loss pad I won I to whatever

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.300 
or a glass loss pad I won I to whatever
is<00:01:45.600> that<00:01:45.780> first<00:01:46.049> of<00:01:46.140> all<00:01:46.200> it's<00:01:46.470> a<00:01:46.740> harm<00:01:46.950> assess

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
is that first of all it's a harm assess

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.200 
and he slipped things of grip things
which<00:01:55.710> allowed<00:01:56.100> for<00:01:56.130> really<00:01:56.880> really<00:01:57.000> good

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
which allowed for really really good

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.060 
which allowed for really really good
free<00:01:57.390> and<00:01:58.079> so<00:01:58.200> basically<00:01:58.500> what<00:01:58.740> they've<00:01:58.920> done

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
free and so basically what they've done

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.700 
free and so basically what they've done
is<00:01:59.250> they've<00:01:59.490> coded<00:01:59.790> this<00:02:00.090> back<00:02:00.780> part<00:02:01.020> with<00:02:01.439> a

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
is they've coded this back part with a

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.289 
is they've coded this back part with a
really<00:02:04.100> not<00:02:05.100> transparent<00:02:05.850> so<00:02:06.000> that<00:02:06.030> so<00:02:06.240> you

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
really not transparent so that so you

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.080 
really not transparent so that so you
can't<00:02:06.600> see<00:02:06.780> through<00:02:06.960> this<00:02:07.140> black<00:02:07.890> surface<00:02:08.489> so

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
can't see through this black surface so

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.279 
can't see through this black surface so
then<00:02:09.239> when<00:02:09.420> you<00:02:09.450> look<00:02:09.720> at<00:02:09.840> it<00:02:09.929> in<00:02:10.020> front<00:02:10.110> of

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
then when you look at it in front of

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.860 
then when you look at it in front of
directly<00:02:10.920> you<00:02:11.430> can<00:02:11.580> see<00:02:11.910> that

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
directly you can see that

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.449 
directly you can see that
it<00:02:12.930> basically<00:02:13.200> bounces<00:02:13.769> on<00:02:13.890> the<00:02:13.920> surface<00:02:14.310> and

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
it basically bounces on the surface and

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:16.910 
it basically bounces on the surface and
it<00:02:14.519> bounces<00:02:14.819> back<00:02:14.849> so<00:02:15.599> on<00:02:16.080> the<00:02:16.230> glass<00:02:16.440> mousepad

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
it bounces back so on the glass mousepad

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.790 
it bounces back so on the glass mousepad
it's<00:02:17.519> very<00:02:18.060> very<00:02:18.239> unique<00:02:18.390> applied<00:02:18.959> but<00:02:19.620> it's

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
it's very very unique applied but it's

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.490 
it's very very unique applied but it's
very<00:02:20.040> very<00:02:20.370> dependent<00:02:20.790> like<00:02:21.540> your<00:02:21.989> glide<00:02:22.230> of

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
very very dependent like your glide of

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.009 
very very dependent like your glide of
the<00:02:22.530> mouse<00:02:22.800> with<00:02:23.370> the<00:02:23.510> glass<00:02:24.510> mouse<00:02:24.720> I<00:02:24.870> was

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019 
the mouse with the glass mouse I was

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:26.690 
the mouse with the glass mouse I was
very<00:02:25.170> dependent<00:02:25.470> on<00:02:25.709> the<00:02:25.800> mouse<00:02:26.310> skate<00:02:26.550> so

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
very dependent on the mouse skate so

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.210 
very dependent on the mouse skate so
yeah<00:02:26.849> so<00:02:27.090> this<00:02:27.239> one<00:02:27.420> I<00:02:27.450> have<00:02:27.660> here<00:02:27.959> these<00:02:28.890> up

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
yeah so this one I have here these up

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.220 
yeah so this one I have here these up
using<00:02:29.849> for<00:02:30.060> a<00:02:30.120> long<00:02:30.299> time<00:02:30.510> so<00:02:30.750> when<00:02:30.900> I<00:02:30.930> use<00:02:31.200> it

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
using for a long time so when I use it

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.410 
using for a long time so when I use it
you<00:02:31.920> guys<00:02:32.069> you<00:02:32.370> can<00:02:32.519> hear<00:02:32.760> like<00:02:32.910> it's<00:02:33.120> a<00:02:33.209> very

has a different type of mouse gates

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.309 
has a different type of mouse gates
which<00:02:51.360> I<00:02:51.510> attached<00:02:51.870> onto<00:02:52.110> it<00:02:52.319> and<00:02:52.950> let's<00:02:53.190> see

00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:54.319 
which I attached onto it and let's see

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:58.100 
which I attached onto it and let's see
like<00:02:55.319> why<00:02:56.160> are<00:02:56.220> you<00:02:56.310> so<00:02:56.629> so<00:02:57.629> let's<00:02:57.810> see<00:02:57.900> what

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
like why are you so so let's see what

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.270 
like why are you so so let's see what
this<00:02:58.260> sounds<00:02:58.530> like<00:02:58.560> so<00:02:58.769> when<00:02:58.890> you<00:02:58.950> put<00:02:59.099> it<00:02:59.190> on

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
this sounds like so when you put it on

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.119 
this sounds like so when you put it on
its<00:02:59.910> the<00:03:00.239> sound<00:03:00.629> is<00:03:00.780> a<00:03:00.810> little<00:03:01.200> bit<00:03:01.440> it's<00:03:01.920> not

00:03:02.119 --> 00:03:02.129 
its the sound is a little bit it's not

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:04.069 
its the sound is a little bit it's not
as<00:03:02.310> grainy<00:03:02.640> and<00:03:02.970> it's<00:03:03.090> not<00:03:03.269> as<00:03:03.420> loud<00:03:03.629> anymore

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:04.079 
as grainy and it's not as loud anymore

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:07.009 
as grainy and it's not as loud anymore
so<00:03:04.590> it<00:03:04.709> sounds<00:03:05.239> it's<00:03:06.239> actually<00:03:06.540> bearable<00:03:06.870> and

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
so it sounds it's actually bearable and

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:10.610 
so it sounds it's actually bearable and
the<00:03:07.110> glide<00:03:07.349> seems<00:03:07.980> softer<00:03:09.170> alright<00:03:10.170> let's<00:03:10.410> see

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
the glide seems softer alright let's see

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.759 
the glide seems softer alright let's see
I<00:03:11.040> have<00:03:11.579> my<00:03:12.360> razor<00:03:12.510> now<00:03:13.260> you're<00:03:13.410> here<00:03:13.560> which

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
I have my razor now you're here which

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:16.100 
I have my razor now you're here which
this<00:03:14.129> these<00:03:14.489> muskets<00:03:15.000> have<00:03:15.209> been<00:03:15.329> used<00:03:15.599> out<00:03:15.780> so

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
this these muskets have been used out so

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.990 
this these muskets have been used out so
once<00:03:16.590> use<00:03:16.829> down<00:03:17.010> Mouse<00:03:17.250> gates<00:03:17.459> on<00:03:17.670> the<00:03:17.819> glass

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
once use down Mouse gates on the glass

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.720 
once use down Mouse gates on the glass
mousepad<00:03:18.420> they<00:03:18.989> really<00:03:19.290> start<00:03:19.799> wearing<00:03:20.190> down

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
mousepad they really start wearing down

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.160 
mousepad they really start wearing down
quite<00:03:21.060> a<00:03:21.090> lot<00:03:21.150> and<00:03:21.420> they<00:03:21.510> sound<00:03:21.720> very<00:03:21.780> creamy

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
quite a lot and they sound very creamy

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.920 
quite a lot and they sound very creamy
so<00:03:23.480> you<00:03:24.480> can<00:03:24.630> hear<00:03:24.810> that<00:03:24.989> most<00:03:25.950> the<00:03:26.040> times<00:03:26.250> you

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
so you can hear that most the times you

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.720 
so you can hear that most the times you
use<00:03:27.930> mouse<00:03:28.139> pads<00:03:28.410> there<00:03:28.709> once<00:03:29.310> they<00:03:29.519> become

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
use mouse pads there once they become

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.349 
use mouse pads there once they become
grainy<00:03:30.030> it's<00:03:31.609> it<00:03:32.609> just<00:03:32.639> doesn't<00:03:33.000> sound<00:03:33.239> too

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:33.359 
grainy it's it just doesn't sound too

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:35.539 
grainy it's it just doesn't sound too
good<00:03:33.389> to<00:03:33.750> fly<00:03:34.019> even<00:03:34.709> though<00:03:34.799> the<00:03:34.889> glide<00:03:35.130> still

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
good to fly even though the glide still

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:37.160 
good to fly even though the glide still
like<00:03:35.760> the<00:03:35.910> same<00:03:36.120> you<00:03:36.329> can<00:03:36.480> see<00:03:36.690> they're<00:03:36.900> twice

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
like the same you can see they're twice

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.080 
like the same you can see they're twice
the<00:03:37.440> same<00:03:37.650> but<00:03:38.160> the<00:03:38.250> sound<00:03:38.489> really<00:03:38.760> really<00:03:38.880> it

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
the same but the sound really really it

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.750 
the same but the sound really really it
would<00:03:39.329> get<00:03:39.959> too<00:03:40.139> funky<00:03:40.380> book<00:03:40.650> and<00:03:41.280> here<00:03:41.609> we

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
would get too funky book and here we

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.479 
would get too funky book and here we
have<00:03:41.940> my<00:03:42.569> site<00:03:42.930> which<00:03:43.290> I<00:03:43.440> also<00:03:43.680> attached<00:03:44.160> some

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
have my site which I also attached some

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:47.539 
have my site which I also attached some
brand<00:03:45.180> new<00:03:45.410> Mouse<00:03:46.410> Cape<00:03:46.680> like<00:03:46.859> Teflon<00:03:47.010> muskets

brand new Mouse Cape like Teflon muskets
on<00:03:47.669> them<00:03:47.819> so<00:03:47.970> these<00:03:48.120> are<00:03:48.329> I<00:03:48.750> think<00:03:49.290> that<00:03:49.620> the

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
on them so these are I think that the

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:52.039 
on them so these are I think that the
rancher<00:03:49.919> pad<00:03:50.329> mask<00:03:51.329> aids<00:03:51.540> or<00:03:51.660> whatever<00:03:51.900> but

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
rancher pad mask aids or whatever but

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:57.740 
rancher pad mask aids or whatever but
let's<00:03:52.440> see<00:03:52.620> how<00:03:52.739> this<00:03:52.950> sounds<00:03:56.239> so<00:03:57.239> as<00:03:57.510> you<00:03:57.660> can

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
let's see how this sounds so as you can

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.780 
let's see how this sounds so as you can
tell<00:03:57.959> like<00:03:58.079> it's<00:03:58.470> a<00:03:58.560> much<00:03:58.739> like<00:03:59.010> softer<00:03:59.549> sound

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
tell like it's a much like softer sound

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.449 
tell like it's a much like softer sound
it's<00:04:00.030> not<00:04:00.090> as<00:04:00.299> grainy<00:04:00.630> and<00:04:00.959> it<00:04:01.709> seems<00:04:02.220> the

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
it's not as grainy and it seems the

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:05.059 
it's not as grainy and it seems the
glide<00:04:03.000> just<00:04:03.660> as<00:04:03.840> smooth<00:04:04.109> as<00:04:04.380> well<00:04:04.530> so

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:05.069 
glide just as smooth as well so

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:06.650 
glide just as smooth as well so
basically<00:04:05.190> cool<00:04:06.000> thing<00:04:06.180> about<00:04:06.239> this<00:04:06.480> mouse

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
basically cool thing about this mouse

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:11.300 
basically cool thing about this mouse
pad<00:04:07.639> it's<00:04:08.639> the<00:04:09.090> the<00:04:09.750> feeling<00:04:10.530> the<00:04:10.709> feel<00:04:11.099> of

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
pad it's the the feeling the feel of

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.220 
pad it's the the feeling the feel of
just<00:04:11.639> using<00:04:11.790> plot<00:04:12.150> on<00:04:12.359> glass<00:04:12.690> rather<00:04:13.019> than<00:04:13.169> a

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
just using plot on glass rather than a

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.830 
just using plot on glass rather than a
hard<00:04:13.380> matter<00:04:13.560> soft<00:04:13.799> man<00:04:13.980> that's<00:04:14.489> just<00:04:14.730> a<00:04:15.239> very

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
hard matter soft man that's just a very

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.979 
hard matter soft man that's just a very
personal<00:04:16.289> feeling<00:04:16.650> like<00:04:17.250> I<00:04:17.630> absolutely<00:04:18.630> love

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
personal feeling like I absolutely love

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:20.479 
personal feeling like I absolutely love
it<00:04:19.109> most<00:04:19.320> people<00:04:19.440> have<00:04:19.799> used<00:04:20.039> glass<00:04:20.280> mouse

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
it most people have used glass mouse

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.909 
it most people have used glass mouse
pads<00:04:20.729> a<00:04:20.880> little<00:04:21.030> bit<00:04:21.289> and<00:04:22.289> the<00:04:22.530> good<00:04:22.680> thing<00:04:22.800> is

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
pads a little bit and the good thing is

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:25.570 
pads a little bit and the good thing is
that<00:04:22.950> it's<00:04:23.400> it<00:04:23.940> works<00:04:24.150> with<00:04:24.479> both

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:25.580 
that it's it works with both

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.749 
that it's it works with both
cool<00:04:25.789> and<00:04:26.530> laser<00:04:27.530> so<00:04:28.009> this<00:04:28.220> is<00:04:28.280> my<00:04:28.370> Zayat<00:04:28.610> it

00:04:28.749 --> 00:04:28.759 
cool and laser so this is my Zayat it

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:31.450 
cool and laser so this is my Zayat it
works<00:04:29.080> perfectly<00:04:30.080> fine<00:04:30.289> we<00:04:30.590> have<00:04:30.710> my<00:04:30.949> eye<00:04:31.250> you

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.460 
works perfectly fine we have my eye you

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.749 
works perfectly fine we have my eye you
think<00:04:31.699> we<00:04:31.789> know<00:04:31.909> where<00:04:32.569> it's<00:04:32.720> perfectly<00:04:33.050> fine

00:04:33.749 --> 00:04:33.759 
think we know where it's perfectly fine

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:35.770 
think we know where it's perfectly fine
one<00:04:34.759> thing<00:04:34.969> but<00:04:35.210> you<00:04:35.300> have<00:04:35.389> to<00:04:35.479> notice<00:04:35.629> about

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:35.780 
one thing but you have to notice about

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.499 
one thing but you have to notice about
glass<00:04:36.020> mousepads<00:04:36.439> is<00:04:36.650> that<00:04:36.860> the<00:04:37.699> lift<00:04:38.360> off

00:04:38.499 --> 00:04:38.509 
glass mousepads is that the lift off

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:40.779 
glass mousepads is that the lift off
distance<00:04:38.539> is<00:04:39.139> extremely<00:04:39.889> low<00:04:40.069> it's<00:04:40.340> it's

00:04:40.779 --> 00:04:40.789 
distance is extremely low it's it's

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:45.249 
distance is extremely low it's it's
about<00:04:41.139> zero<00:04:42.139> point<00:04:42.550> one<00:04:43.719> centimeters<00:04:44.719> like

00:04:45.249 --> 00:04:45.259 
about zero point one centimeters like

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:46.689 
about zero point one centimeters like
one<00:04:45.530> millimeter<00:04:46.039> or<00:04:46.219> two<00:04:46.370> millimeters

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:46.699 
one millimeter or two millimeters

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:50.170 
one millimeter or two millimeters
compared<00:04:47.419> to<00:04:47.599> you<00:04:48.439> have<00:04:48.620> some<00:04:48.919> like<00:04:49.159> the<00:04:49.729> SP

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.180 
compared to you have some like the SP

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.920 
compared to you have some like the SP
which<00:04:50.539> has<00:04:50.719> a<00:04:51.430> which<00:04:52.430> has<00:04:52.610> a<00:04:52.639> renowned<00:04:53.599> like

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930 
which has a which has a renowned like

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:55.450 
which has a which has a renowned like
high<00:04:54.439> lift<00:04:54.770> off<00:04:54.949> distance

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:55.460 
high lift off distance

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:58.149 
high lift off distance
this<00:04:55.580> one<00:04:55.789> has<00:04:56.030> extremely<00:04:56.719> low<00:04:56.960> so<00:04:57.860> basically

00:04:58.149 --> 00:04:58.159 
this one has extremely low so basically

00:04:58.159 --> 00:05:00.339 
this one has extremely low so basically
once<00:04:58.520> you<00:04:58.669> lift<00:04:59.210> on<00:04:59.360> your<00:04:59.389> mousepad<00:04:59.659> it<00:05:00.229> was

00:05:00.339 --> 00:05:00.349 
once you lift on your mousepad it was

00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:03.939 
once you lift on your mousepad it was
just<00:05:00.500> the<00:05:00.680> mouse<00:05:00.949> will<00:05:01.129> stop<00:05:01.340> tracking<00:05:01.639> on<00:05:02.949> on

00:05:03.939 --> 00:05:03.949 
just the mouse will stop tracking on on

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:06.610 
just the mouse will stop tracking on on
the<00:05:04.190> screen<00:05:04.430> so<00:05:04.669> lift<00:05:05.300> loadlifter<00:05:05.690> fistin<00:05:06.500> s--

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:06.620 
the screen so lift loadlifter fistin s--

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:09.520 
the screen so lift loadlifter fistin s--
is<00:05:06.770> pretty<00:05:07.520> good<00:05:07.669> lot<00:05:08.419> of<00:05:08.509> people<00:05:08.719> some<00:05:09.289> people

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:09.530 
is pretty good lot of people some people

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:11.020 
is pretty good lot of people some people
like<00:05:09.650> it<00:05:09.800> most<00:05:09.949> the<00:05:10.129> time<00:05:10.310> you<00:05:10.460> want<00:05:10.699> a<00:05:10.819> little

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:11.030 
like it most the time you want a little

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:12.939 
like it most the time you want a little
lift<00:05:11.180> off<00:05:11.389> distance<00:05:11.419> but<00:05:12.020> i<00:05:12.229> have<00:05:12.770> to<00:05:12.860> be

00:05:12.939 --> 00:05:12.949 
lift off distance but i have to be

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:14.879 
lift off distance but i have to be
careful<00:05:12.979> because<00:05:13.460> i've<00:05:13.819> tried<00:05:14.060> having<00:05:14.419> a

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:14.889 
careful because i've tried having a

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:17.559 
careful because i've tried having a
after<00:05:15.889> I'm<00:05:15.979> having<00:05:16.370> my<00:05:16.520> death<00:05:17.090> out<00:05:17.240> of<00:05:17.330> here

00:05:17.559 --> 00:05:17.569 
after I'm having my death out of here

00:05:17.569 --> 00:05:20.589 
after I'm having my death out of here
I've<00:05:18.379> tried<00:05:18.529> attaching<00:05:19.009> 0.5<00:05:19.789> millimeter

00:05:20.589 --> 00:05:20.599 
I've tried attaching 0.5 millimeter

00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:23.290 
I've tried attaching 0.5 millimeter
Mouse<00:05:21.590> gates<00:05:21.830> and<00:05:22.069> when<00:05:22.550> I<00:05:22.610> tried<00:05:22.789> tracking<00:05:23.029> on

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:23.300 
Mouse gates and when I tried tracking on

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.990 
Mouse gates and when I tried tracking on
like<00:05:23.629> this<00:05:24.020> mouse<00:05:24.889> pad<00:05:24.919> actually<00:05:25.610> wouldn't

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.000 
like this mouse pad actually wouldn't

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.879 
like this mouse pad actually wouldn't
even<00:05:26.090> track<00:05:26.509> because<00:05:26.990> the<00:05:27.169> lift<00:05:27.349> off<00:05:27.500> this<00:05:27.680> is

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:27.889 
even track because the lift off this is

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:30.010 
even track because the lift off this is
because<00:05:28.490> if<00:05:28.789> you<00:05:28.969> imagine<00:05:29.180> if<00:05:29.479> I<00:05:29.629> lift<00:05:29.870> off

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:30.020 
because if you imagine if I lift off

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:31.180 
because if you imagine if I lift off
this<00:05:30.199> which<00:05:30.349> by<00:05:30.500> its<00:05:30.710> they're<00:05:30.860> about<00:05:30.979> five

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:31.190 
this which by its they're about five

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:33.550 
this which by its they're about five
millimeters<00:05:31.460> and<00:05:31.819> this<00:05:32.509> only<00:05:32.719> tracks<00:05:33.110> up<00:05:33.409> to

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:33.560 
millimeters and this only tracks up to

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.490 
millimeters and this only tracks up to
zero<00:05:33.830> point<00:05:34.449> so<00:05:35.449> it's<00:05:35.870> not<00:05:35.960> a<00:05:36.020> zero<00:05:36.229> point<00:05:36.379> five

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:36.500 
zero point so it's not a zero point five

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:40.059 
zero point so it's not a zero point five
millimeter<00:05:37.039> point<00:05:37.250> 5<00:05:37.400> cm<00:05:37.789> so<00:05:38.479> this<00:05:38.690> is<00:05:38.840> a<00:05:39.069> 2

00:05:40.059 --> 00:05:40.069 
millimeter point 5 cm so this is a 2

00:05:40.069 --> 00:05:42.640 
millimeter point 5 cm so this is a 2
millimeter<00:05:40.370> 2<00:05:41.330> millimeter<00:05:41.839> tracking<00:05:42.440> so

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:42.650 
millimeter 2 millimeter tracking so

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:44.529 
millimeter 2 millimeter tracking so
basically<00:05:42.949> you<00:05:43.099> couldn't<00:05:43.400> even<00:05:43.460> track<00:05:43.849> so

00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:44.539 
basically you couldn't even track so

00:05:44.539 --> 00:05:47.680
