making a bauble or two per race so is it

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.560 
making a bauble or two per race so is it
more<00:02:11.590> about<00:02:11.850> trying<00:02:12.850> to<00:02:12.910> put<00:02:13.060> in<00:02:13.150> a<00:02:13.209> clean<00:02:13.420> run

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.570 
more about trying to put in a clean run

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:15.210 
more about trying to put in a clean run
or<00:02:13.780> really<00:02:13.990> just<00:02:14.140> minimize<00:02:14.560> the<00:02:14.739> crash<00:02:14.980> when

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
or really just minimize the crash when

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:16.830 
or really just minimize the crash when
you<00:02:15.310> do<00:02:15.430> have<00:02:15.459> it<00:02:15.640> I<00:02:15.940> think<00:02:16.420> minimize

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
you do have it I think minimize

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.509 
you do have it I think minimize
delicious<00:02:17.350> because<00:02:17.500> the<00:02:17.769> twix<00:02:17.950> is<00:02:18.070> so<00:02:18.220> fast

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:18.519 
delicious because the twix is so fast

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:20.729 
delicious because the twix is so fast
and<00:02:18.700> so<00:02:18.910> grippy<00:02:19.360> it's<00:02:19.630> I<00:02:20.230> think<00:02:20.440> everybody

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
and so grippy it's I think everybody

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:23.280 
and so grippy it's I think everybody
makes<00:02:20.950> this<00:02:21.070> mob<00:02:21.280> of<00:02:21.430> it<00:02:21.580> yeah<00:02:22.330> we<00:02:22.989> saw<00:02:23.170> a<00:02:23.200> lot

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
makes this mob of it yeah we saw a lot

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.140 
makes this mob of it yeah we saw a lot
of<00:02:23.410> drivers<00:02:23.680> taking<00:02:24.040> some<00:02:24.280> risks<00:02:24.640> through

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
of drivers taking some risks through

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.720 
of drivers taking some risks through
some<00:02:25.360> of<00:02:25.450> the<00:02:25.510> bigger<00:02:25.690> jump<00:02:25.959> sections<00:02:26.730> some

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
some of the bigger jump sections some

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.050 
some of the bigger jump sections some
drivers<00:02:27.940> is<00:02:28.209> opting<00:02:28.540> to<00:02:28.570> play<00:02:28.780> it<00:02:28.930> safe<00:02:29.140> and

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
drivers is opting to play it safe and

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.250 
drivers is opting to play it safe and
obviously<00:02:31.060> putting<00:02:31.330> a<00:02:31.480> clean<00:02:31.810> run<00:02:31.959> in<00:02:32.140> the

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
obviously putting a clean run in the

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:33.810 
obviously putting a clean run in the
first<00:02:32.470> round<00:02:32.650> is<00:02:32.830> important<00:02:33.280> so<00:02:33.489> what<00:02:33.670> was

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
first round is important so what was

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.520 
first round is important so what was
your<00:02:33.970> mindset<00:02:34.360> going<00:02:34.510> into<00:02:34.840> it<00:02:35.080> when<00:02:35.290> you<00:02:35.380> walk

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
your mindset going into it when you walk

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.190 
your mindset going into it when you walk
up<00:02:35.560> on<00:02:35.739> the<00:02:35.830> driver<00:02:36.010> stand<00:02:36.280> I<00:02:36.630> think<00:02:37.630> if<00:02:37.930> the

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
up on the driver stand I think if the

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.560 
up on the driver stand I think if the
first<00:02:38.410> one<00:02:38.560> was<00:02:38.680> really<00:02:38.890> important<00:02:39.370> and<00:02:39.700> for

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
first one was really important and for

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:43.500 
first one was really important and for
me<00:02:40.660> it<00:02:40.750> was<00:02:40.870> perfect<00:02:41.290> with<00:02:41.410> the<00:02:41.530> TQ<00:02:41.830> but<00:02:42.519> I<00:02:42.550> for

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
me it was perfect with the TQ but I for

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.960 
me it was perfect with the TQ but I for
me<00:02:43.600> it's<00:02:43.750> easier<00:02:43.930> to<00:02:44.230> quote<00:02:45.070> and<00:02:45.340> double<00:02:45.790> the

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
me it's easier to quote and double the

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.870 
me it's easier to quote and double the
jump<00:02:46.750> after<00:02:47.140> this<00:02:47.470> to<00:02:47.620> wait<00:02:47.739> so<00:02:48.010> I<00:02:48.310> go<00:02:48.610> for<00:02:48.790> this

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
jump after this to wait so I go for this

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.990 
jump after this to wait so I go for this
all<00:02:49.540> the<00:02:49.660> time<00:02:50.070> and<00:02:51.070> we<00:02:51.280> saw<00:02:51.459> that<00:02:51.670> the<00:02:51.730> team

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
even better when it's hot because it's a

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.970 
even better when it's hot because it's a
little<00:03:19.569> bit<00:03:19.660> less

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
little bit less

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:29.299 
have one good run under your belt is it

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:31.640 
have one good run under your belt is it
important<00:03:30.299> to<00:03:30.360> just<00:03:30.690> be<00:03:30.870> clean<00:03:31.140> in<00:03:31.170> the<00:03:31.349> second

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
important to just be clean in the second

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.140 
important to just be clean in the second
round<00:03:31.739> or<00:03:32.099> when<00:03:32.310> do<00:03:32.400> you<00:03:32.489> start<00:03:32.760> trying<00:03:33.000> to

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150

push it a little bit i think i can push
from<00:03:35.760> the<00:03:35.879> second<00:03:36.120> one<00:03:36.450> though<00:03:36.660> because<00:03:37.530> i

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
from the second one though because i

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.610 
from the second one though because i
have<00:03:37.950> a<00:03:37.980> DQ<00:03:38.489> already<00:03:38.790> it's<00:03:39.030> perfect<00:03:39.840> so<00:03:40.049> i<00:03:40.319> play
