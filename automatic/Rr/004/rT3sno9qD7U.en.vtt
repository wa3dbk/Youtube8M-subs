Hi guys! Today I will make a box for halloween

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I will use these two templates I've cut before

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
A larger than the other to use as cover

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.500
and then I'll put these two black pieces over the templates

00:00:19.037 --> 00:00:21.037
The template to do the box can be found on my blog as always

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Let's go bending the tabs to form the box

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
We ensure proper folding tabs

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Put some glue on the tabs

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.650
Once the glue set, we mounted the box carefully

00:01:09.987 --> 00:01:11.987
Joining either side

00:01:22.816 --> 00:01:24.816
You can see how it looks

00:01:27.464 --> 00:01:30.464
Now, let's do the same with the box cover

00:01:32.634 --> 00:01:35.634
fold, glue and assemble the box cover

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
both parties have already mounted

00:01:40.693 --> 00:01:42.690
see how they fit perfectly

00:01:45.548 --> 00:01:54.550
Now, the two parts black paste on each of the sides of the box

00:01:56.583 --> 00:01:58.580
The black pieces are slightly larger than the box cover

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
This is so that the box can be opened easily

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.130
put the piece centered correctly

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
we will do the same with the other side of the box

00:02:22.516 --> 00:02:29.520
To decorate the box I will use orange cardstock

00:02:30.166 --> 00:02:32.170
I'll put a letters writing 

00:02:32.625 --> 00:02:34.620
and also I will put some bats

00:02:35.546 --> 00:02:37.550
I have previously cut

00:02:41.295 --> 00:02:43.300
and other smaller bats

00:02:44.337 --> 00:02:46.340
I will put the bats in this way, okay?

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:49.730
Once everything is glued

00:02:50.003 --> 00:02:55.000
I will draw a spider web and a spider on the largest bat

00:02:56.251 --> 00:02:59.050
I will first draw with pencil

00:03:05.463 --> 00:03:08.460
and then I will go over with black marker

00:03:15.973 --> 00:03:17.970
This is how is the box once completed

00:03:18.261 --> 00:03:20.260
You can decorate it as you like best

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Finally do not forget to put the candy in the box

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:27.990
I hope you liked it. See you in the next video. Bye!
