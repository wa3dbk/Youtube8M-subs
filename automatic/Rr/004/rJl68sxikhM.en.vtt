00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
really great gameplay where it's your

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.170 
really great gameplay where it's your
decision<00:01:56.369> that<00:01:56.490> meant<00:01:56.670> that<00:01:56.729> you

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
decision that meant that you

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.940 
decision that meant that you
made<00:01:57.330> that<00:01:57.570> crucial<00:01:57.930> flanking<00:01:58.410> leave<00:01:58.590> I'm<00:01:58.740> one

of<00:01:59.010> the<00:01:59.070> battle<00:01:59.460> as<00:01:59.820> our<00:02:00.030> games<00:02:00.210> have<00:02:00.270> gotten

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
of the battle as our games have gotten

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.670 
of the battle as our games have gotten
bigger<00:02:00.690> this<00:02:00.870> but<00:02:00.990> question<00:02:01.230> about<00:02:01.320> well<00:02:01.500> why

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
bigger this but question about well why

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.110 
bigger this but question about well why
isn't<00:02:01.830> another<00:02:02.070> player<00:02:02.280> factions<00:02:02.730> increases

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:03.120 
isn't another player factions increases

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.880 
isn't another player factions increases
and<00:02:03.450> this<00:02:03.750> is<00:02:03.900> because<00:02:04.170> that<00:02:04.320> each<00:02:04.470> game<00:02:04.740> we've

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
and this is because that each game we've

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.290 
and this is because that each game we've
gone<00:02:05.010> to<00:02:05.190> more<00:02:05.340> and<00:02:05.490> more<00:02:05.520> depth<00:02:05.820> with<00:02:06.060> those

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.300 
gone to more and more depth with those

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.480 
gone to more and more depth with those
factions<00:02:06.690> we're<00:02:07.440> for<00:02:07.800> round<00:02:07.980> two<00:02:08.100> but<00:02:08.250> really

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:08.490 
factions we're for round two but really

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:09.889 
factions we're for round two but really
emphasizing<00:02:09.149> this<00:02:09.300> we're<00:02:09.509> putting<00:02:09.750> more

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
emphasizing this we're putting more

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.990 
emphasizing this we're putting more
depth<00:02:10.170> into<00:02:10.289> campaign<00:02:10.710> map<00:02:10.860> features<00:02:11.310> more

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
depth into campaign map features more

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.260

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
unique rosters texts things like that

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:16.340 
unique rosters texts things like that
there's<00:02:15.660> one<00:02:15.750> of<00:02:15.840> those<00:02:15.900> questions<00:02:16.260> of

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
there's one of those questions of

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.199 
there's one of those questions of
quality<00:02:16.770> versus<00:02:17.100> quantity<00:02:17.130> and<00:02:17.820> we<00:02:17.970> really

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
quality versus quantity and we really

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.600 
quality versus quantity and we really
want<00:02:18.330> to<00:02:18.360> go<00:02:18.510> through<00:02:18.690> quality<00:02:19.370> so<00:02:20.370> people

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
want to go through quality so people

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.160

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.550 
that the siege of Carthage vision was
done<00:03:03.090> pre-alpha<00:03:03.660> so<00:03:04.170> it's<00:03:04.290> a<00:03:04.320> very<00:03:04.500> early

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
done pre-alpha so it's a very early

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.220 
done pre-alpha so it's a very early
stage<00:03:05.100> of<00:03:05.280> development<00:03:05.700> and<00:03:06.660> a<00:03:06.840> lot<00:03:06.870> to<00:03:07.080> change

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
stage of development and a lot to change

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.289 
stage of development and a lot to change
since<00:03:07.470> then<00:03:07.620> so<00:03:07.860> at<00:03:08.010> that<00:03:08.100> point<00:03:08.280> we<00:03:08.489> put<00:03:08.670> in<00:03:08.790> we

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299 
since then so at that point we put in we

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:11.509 
since then so at that point we put in we
got<00:03:09.480> unit<00:03:09.989> looks<00:03:10.200> into<00:03:10.650> great<00:03:10.830> diversity<00:03:11.340> and

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
got unit looks into great diversity and

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:13.460 
got unit looks into great diversity and
look<00:03:11.700> good<00:03:11.940> but<00:03:12.299> it<00:03:12.390> wasn't<00:03:12.660> with<00:03:12.959> the<00:03:13.140> final

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
look good but it wasn't with the final

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.949 
look good but it wasn't with the final
system<00:03:13.620> as<00:03:14.549> we<00:03:14.760> release<00:03:14.970> more<00:03:15.239> art<00:03:15.390> for<00:03:15.600> Rome<00:03:15.780> T

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:17.420 
system as we release more art for Rome T
you<00:03:16.140> will<00:03:16.230> see<00:03:16.410> this<00:03:16.590> difference<00:03:17.040> between

you will see this difference between

what we showed in Carthage and what the

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.490 
what we showed in Carthage and what the
units<00:03:19.830> would<00:03:19.920> look<00:03:20.010> like<00:03:20.160> in<00:03:20.310> the<00:03:20.370> final<00:03:20.519> game

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500
