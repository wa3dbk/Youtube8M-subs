 breathing you do not take any 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.510
 drugs you do not consume 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.650
 toxic have not redone everything 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.320

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.310
 fall asleep and that arm right arm 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.230
 you exactly right arm then 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.050
 actually we propose to you 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:35.540
 to fall asleep that the arm is a technique 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:38.570
 which is called the block technique 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:42.190
 axillary that is performed here under a 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:44.930
 ultrasound basketball has a big advantage 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:48.860
 is for you and for us on the map 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:50.860
 safe because we're actually going 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.910
 see your nerves going under your arm 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.530
 you have four mayors who gives the 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.580
 sensitivity and motor skills of your 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.040
 arm your forearm and hand 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:00.590
 okay so we spot it's different 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.450
 nerves and we sleep each nerves one 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.980
 after each other spitting only one 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.140
 you reassure yourself so if you 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.110
 fear the bites only one that fixes 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.400
 a single sting 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.019
 it's a little unpleasant I can not 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.760
 tell you that you will not feel anything 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:16.250
 because at the moment we are going to inject the 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.840
 local anesthetic product goes from 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.269
 to distend a little bit the whole 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.590
 region like that it can create a 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:24.739
 certain tension 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:26.329
 besides the crack if it is ballasted if 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:27.860
 it lasts about how long the 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:31.100
 arm should remain anesthetized between 3 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.720
 and 4 agree at the time of the release 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.060
 you will put an arm in a scarf 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.709
 you will not have the right to leave 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.540
 cats tent the arm is not awake 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:40.730
 finally the last important element that 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.140
 imposed on you and who we are 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.489
 imposed by law is that you do not 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.170
 must not stay alone at home 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:46.100

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.600

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:53.690
 then we will see all this in the 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:56.110
 detail at the end of the consultation 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.110

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:18.010
 to push the doors I tried it 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.270
