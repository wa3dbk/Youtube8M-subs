 In I think that I want to describe 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:26.619
 What 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:26.619
 It is a bow gun I already made with a song 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:35.180
 In the magazine of power 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.180
 This is about to leave 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:46.270

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.270
 Ordinary is a good month 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.640

 Then I want to make money 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.239
 When you listen to a song 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.580
 Such feeling is set 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.070

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:41.920

 As you said well, this is a great power 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.770

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 loan 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:55.680
 It is connected that it comes in the role of a stopper and comes in 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.430
 This rubber is back like this 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.430
 500 people 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:05.810
 Because this will help it 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.810
 Like this 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.939
 Forms take occasionally 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.170

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.159
 The 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.060
 The 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.060
 Maa like this 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:31.470
 This is not a gold point 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.470
 Well I was passing a little from here 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.569
 Well then 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.569
 This time is good 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.260
 It was a bow gun 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.260
 If
