most<00:01:08.030> of<00:01:08.330> my<00:01:08.540> job<00:01:08.840> because<00:01:09.350> otherwise<00:01:09.740> it

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070

would be really hard physically and

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.600 
would be really hard physically and
emotionally<00:01:12.700> but<00:01:14.049> what<00:01:15.049> I<00:01:15.080> prefer<00:01:15.530> would<00:01:16.400> be

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
emotionally but what I prefer would be

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.120 
emotionally but what I prefer would be
probably<00:01:17.060> performing<00:01:17.810> and<00:01:18.049> be<00:01:18.500> part<00:01:18.770> of<00:01:18.890> a<00:01:18.950> new

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
creation

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.580 
creation
what's<00:01:20.060> good<00:01:20.210> about<00:01:20.240> performing<00:01:20.960> is<00:01:21.080> you<00:01:21.409> can

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
what's good about performing is you can

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.490 
what's good about performing is you can
fail<00:01:22.159> sometime<00:01:22.850> that<00:01:23.060> it<00:01:23.479> brings<00:01:23.630> emotion<00:01:24.320> out

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
fail sometime that it brings emotion out

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.910 
fail sometime that it brings emotion out
of<00:01:24.619> people<00:01:25.040> and<00:01:26.110> work<00:01:27.110> closely<00:01:27.380> with<00:01:27.680> the

of people and work closely with the
choreographer<00:01:28.580> really<00:01:29.299> makes<00:01:29.450> you<00:01:29.600> feel<00:01:29.659> that

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
choreographer really makes you feel that

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.770 
choreographer really makes you feel that
you<00:01:30.200> put<00:01:30.439> a<00:01:30.470> bit<00:01:30.680> of<00:01:30.710> yourself<00:01:31.220> in<00:01:31.430> the<00:01:31.549> work<00:01:31.780> so

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
you put a bit of yourself in the work so

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.569 
you put a bit of yourself in the work so
it's<00:01:32.900> a<00:01:33.049> good<00:01:33.229> feeling<00:01:33.470> it's<00:01:33.950> really<00:01:34.280> hard<00:01:34.490> to

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:34.579 
it's a good feeling it's really hard to

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:36.640 
it's a good feeling it's really hard to
find<00:01:34.729> a<00:01:34.880> job<00:01:35.150> in<00:01:35.390> your<00:01:35.450> own<00:01:35.659> country<00:01:36.229> so<00:01:36.590> you
