00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:26.780 

saviors<00:01:21.399> cruise<00:01:22.829> and<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:25.060> next<00:01:25.390> part<00:01:25.659> is

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
saviors cruise and the next part is

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.249 
saviors cruise and the next part is
trying<00:01:27.790> to<00:01:27.909> get<00:01:28.119> this<00:01:28.360> assembly<00:01:29.049> pop-up<00:01:31.259> so

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:32.259 
trying to get this assembly pop-up so

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:34.639 
trying to get this assembly pop-up so
for<00:01:32.500> that<00:01:32.649> I<00:01:32.710> think<00:01:32.920> it's<00:01:33.220> good<00:01:33.430> to<00:01:33.549> use<00:01:33.759> small

00:01:34.639 --> 00:01:34.649 
for that I think it's good to use small

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:39.539 
for that I think it's good to use small
code<00:01:35.649> or<00:01:36.039> something<00:01:36.850> that<00:01:36.970> you<00:01:37.060> have<00:01:38.549> it's

one<00:02:14.209> with<00:02:14.420> this<00:02:14.569> main<00:02:14.810> assembly<00:02:15.400> so<00:02:17.560> now<00:02:18.560> is

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
one with this main assembly so now is

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.760 
one with this main assembly so now is
because<00:02:20.180> most<00:02:20.450> of<00:02:20.660> the<00:02:23.050> here<00:02:24.050> you<00:02:24.080> can<00:02:24.230> see<00:02:24.440> the
