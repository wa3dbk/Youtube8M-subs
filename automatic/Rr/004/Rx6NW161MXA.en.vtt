00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.679
 at 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.470
 and so promptly competitive 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:23.080
 multiplayer shooter from the first and 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:26.410
 third-person format 4 against one 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:28.599
 up a little long idea simple you still with 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:30.730
 three buddies gather a team and 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:33.040
 go hunt the big alien 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.320
 monster controlled by another game 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.210
 for the people you play first person 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.080
 for the monster we switched perspective 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.480
 third person 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:42.550
 so that a gamer in his shoes could 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.830
 see not only the paws of my monster 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.940
 bodies as well as this beast does 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:48.489
 all sorts of cool stuff 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.320
 for example climbing rocks in a team 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:52.119
 veteran hunters years forgot right away 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.890
 feel at home here everything 

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:55.960
 so focused on co-op that 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.420
 if the team acts well and smoothly 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.339
 they are just incredibly effective and powerful 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.140
 but if you normally work together with them 

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:04.479
 it does not work and the result will be 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.970
 much worse than one would expect and 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:09.189
 here you start to track down the monster by 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.030
 his footsteps but the game has the usual 

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:12.070
 local fauna 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.409
 so there will definitely be moments when 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.030
 you think countdown and in soot enter the clip 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:18.100
 in some poor little animals and 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:21.549
 then everyone thinks that it really is and 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:23.619
 the truth was our monster people first 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:25.659
 hunt for a monster but if the beast will 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:27.850
 successfully repel attacks goes 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:29.740
 enough food and grows it can 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.380
 turn the situation so parties 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.780
 swap roles and he himself will become 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.119
 prey on humans for a moment 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.979
 the monster scene inevitably appears all 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:42.189
 start yelling and scorching from all trunks 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:44.319
 Generally complete chaos, remember monster 

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:46.509
 hunter for example there were cool 

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:48.640
 new monsters with them were predictable 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:48.969
 now he will carry out this attack then 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.890
 this 

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:53.229
 then it becomes vulnerable for a while 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.359
 but when such a monster rules the game 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:57.340
 everything becomes much more interesting and 

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:59.530
 In general, as a result, everything feels slightly 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.359
 looks like a fitting because everything 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.369
 try to predict the actions of the enemy 

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:07.119
 dodge in time to find the right moment 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:09.739
 to attack military Ukraine strained 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:10.399
 hands to eat is our main 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:12.140
 mode 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.420
 the whole game was essentially built around 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.190
 him well this is not the only thing 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.670
 will only take out to show that 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:21.830
 yet we are preparing for you, we can not yet 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.420
 there will be a large selection of hunters every this 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.190
 unique character with his 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.380
 features and their own 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.239
 a set of equipment will be several 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.400
 monsters of different types they are different 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:33.500
 move through the level and have their 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.970
 ability to walk and play for 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.280
 secretive beasts want take 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.110
 inflated melee expert at 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.090
 development and Islands, we focus on 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.250
 infinite and replayability to 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.170
 every battle has always been unique 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.480
 you can play alone 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.849
 like any number of players under five 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.040
 and it all works without problems 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:54.710
 play single for monster in general we 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:57.740
 tried to take into account the tastes of all players 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:59.360
 having learned for mines know lately 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.900
 it becomes popular that many 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.510
 called 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.220
 asymmetric multiplayer titanfall to 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.560
 example, well, or generally view 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.450
 however , we had his idea very much 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.370
 so long ago we can not say that we 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.110
 saw the trend and decided to use 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.240
 moment and something like that 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.070
 here you can remember counter-strike 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.750
 bomb disposal scenario 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:19.550
 where one team should have been a bomb 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.830
 set and the second is actually 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:24.530
 neutralize all of their roles and they 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:26.990
 different may wow this design philosophy 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.980
 twisted to the maximum and the presence of such 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:29.810
 asymmetry 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.150
 allows us to play our project perfectly 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:34.280
 different types of gamers can you master 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.970
 first person shooters bend all 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.650
 call of duty 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:38.240
 then you will surely be nice 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.010
 control the monster because in this 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:42.640
 case you are in command one 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:45.380
 and you do not need to rely on comrades 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:47.120
 There are a lot of multiplayer games now 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:49.430
 give out nonstop action 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.350
 there is a marked contrast in our game 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.900
 between quiet and calm moments and 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:55.430
 dynamic adrenaline moistening without 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.780
 such contrasts generally will not 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.090
 interesting because it is difficult to really 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.580
 evaluate the moment of action if not 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:03.440
 moments of inaction can be compared 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:05.510
 with visual tricks if you want 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.400
 show the player a dark dark cave 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:09.260
 I need to do the whole level 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.760
 dark if he starts somewhere in 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.280
 relatively safe and good 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.540
 lighted place then bring the entrance 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.730
 in the cave he may have 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:19.010
 feeling of the kind but do i want to 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:21.049
 go down to this terrible place in the left 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:23.390
 for dead in versus mode you were very 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:25.520
 high but the cooperative pace is greater 

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:26.990
 resembled a roller coaster there is 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.970
 some moments everything slowed down and 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.430
 calmed down and then suddenly began 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:34.010
 totally mad action game and it was 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:35.480
 dynamic system and me and the director in 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:38.330
 Islands to control the pace of the game will be 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:40.130
 a similar thing looks like this so the players 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:42.530
 looking for a monster looking for 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:44.180
 the monster is looking for food trip to some 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:44.630
 the moment you meet and begins 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.640
 fight 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:49.070
 but only after the battle the game is not 

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:51.140
 ends we develop everything so 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:53.300
 so that after the collision side 

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:55.490
 could break up so that the beast could run away 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:57.290
 and then the main question is who how much 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:59.480
 damage done who took over 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:01.200
 after the fight, the pace again becomes more 

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:03.030
 calm and then caused 

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:05.550
 you find each other most 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:07.050
 matches the game ends only after 4 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:08.790
 or 5 battles 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:10.680
 you might think you just need 

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:13.380
 find a monster immediately fill it up and here and 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:15.900
 the whole game is such of course sometimes happens 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:17.400
 Well, that's not what we're aiming for, so 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:19.680
 we have different specials working there 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:22.740
 systems that help one of the teams 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:24.780
 retreat and leave the battlefield one of 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:27.030
 interesting features that highlight 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:29.370
 him compared to other games of this system 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:31.530
 chasing monsters hunters need 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:33.570
 look for tracks to follow them carefully 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:35.400
 listen know if not count 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:37.290
 projects like big game hunter 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.970
 and this is of course completely separate 

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:40.920
 specific genre is hard to remember 

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:42.930
 something like this in action games and shooters 

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:44.760
 it happens so you stop 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:50.520
 listen to the surrounding sounds and 

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:52.980
 speak like that quiet too quiet when 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:55.170
 we did rf hordes we found that in 

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:56.880
 co-op many things that players 

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:58.860
 in theory would have to each other 

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:01.230
 you can report yourself 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:03.210
 automatically by the game itself 

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:05.580
 for example if you entered someone 

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:07.860
 from other players and could not pass your 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:09.570
 the character himself said move over and if you 

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:10.140
 aimed at some important 

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:11.880
 an object 

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:14.190
 your hero immediately informed everyone 

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:16.800
 that in for example caution i see boomer and 

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:18.780
 all players responded to this list 

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:19.830
 replicas used this way we 

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:21.930
 usually included that 

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:24.450
 what they themselves often told each other during 

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:26.220
 play time in the studio for example hey guys i 

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:28.410
 Found cartridges to include in the game 

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:30.210
 replicas were easy for us 

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:32.880
 seem like it is insignificant 

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:33.360
 feature but in fact it is very important 

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:35.340
 element 

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:37.620
 practically necessary for effective 

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:39.870
 team interaction in co-op we 

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:41.880
 and for his replica come up with the same 

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:44.319
 way but true here most of 

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:48.340
 they come down to the ruble 

00:06:44.319 --> 00:06:51.020
 I do not know whether we will add this phrase to the game 

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:52.969
 Well, for examples if you stuck in 

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:55.539
 monster harpoon then your character immediately 

00:06:52.969 --> 00:06:57.949
 screams and I get his tan, I hold him 

00:06:55.539 --> 00:07:00.229
 Of course you can always take a microphone and 

00:06:57.949 --> 00:07:00.590
 establish communication at a higher 

00:07:00.229 --> 00:07:02.659
 level 

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:04.280
 but we always tried to add 

00:07:02.659 --> 00:07:08.569
 systems to help coordinate 

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:10.969
 team action right into the game but 

00:07:08.569 --> 00:07:12.289
 naturally this is an iterative process then 

00:07:10.969 --> 00:07:14.210
 have we finish this now 

00:07:12.289 --> 00:07:16.340
 automatic communication system on 

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:18.409
 basic folder level with it afterwards 

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:19.759
 Let's try to play ours with a cheat 

00:07:18.409 --> 00:07:22.900
 and it will be clear what worked well 

00:07:19.759 --> 00:07:24.770
 which is not very, and what else is worth adding 

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:26.990
 the process of developing it 

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:28.759
 goes well and unlike lion chord 

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:30.680
 when at first we didn’t know which one 

00:07:28.759 --> 00:07:32.569
 we want to get the game as a result here with us 

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:34.639
 it was immediately a definite goal 

00:07:32.569 --> 00:07:35.360
 make an action in which a team of 

00:07:34.639 --> 00:07:37.189
 four players 

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:38.750
 fights with a huge monster under 

00:07:37.189 --> 00:07:41.240
 running the fifth player 

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:41.900
 we ourselves are walking every evening if 

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:43.639
 it turns out 

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:45.889
 exception when anyone is dropped in 

00:07:43.639 --> 00:07:48.199
 the current beat then everything starts on him 

00:07:45.889 --> 00:07:50.300
 swear and we like to play it for 

00:07:48.199 --> 00:07:51.949
 me it is a very good sign because 

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:53.930
 if we are not interested in playing our own 

00:07:51.949 --> 00:07:56.000
 the game is then no one else to play and not 

00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:58.509
 will want so we hope that everyone 

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.509
 will like
