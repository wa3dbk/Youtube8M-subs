00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
everywhere Vanessa classic it is a very

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.220 
everywhere Vanessa classic it is a very
strong<00:00:16.590> option<00:00:16.949> for<00:00:17.100> us<00:00:17.359> yeah<00:00:18.359> i<00:00:18.570> think<00:00:18.779> i<00:00:18.990> was

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
strong option for us yeah i think i was

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.960 
strong option for us yeah i think i was
getting<00:00:19.439> like<00:00:19.560> just<00:00:20.100> a<00:00:20.160> couple<00:00:20.189> jabs<00:00:20.550> here<00:00:20.880> on

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
getting like just a couple jabs here on

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.050 
getting like just a couple jabs here on
their<00:00:21.260> adding<00:00:22.260> up<00:00:22.439> pretty<00:00:23.310> quickly<00:00:23.609> so<00:00:23.760> i<00:00:23.970> was

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
their adding up pretty quickly so i was

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.179 
their adding up pretty quickly so i was
like<00:00:24.210> indeed<00:00:25.050> I<00:00:25.260> think<00:00:25.500> Nessa's<00:00:25.769> character

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
like indeed I think Nessa's character

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.620 
like indeed I think Nessa's character
that<00:00:26.340> definitely<00:00:26.730> benefits<00:00:27.150> of<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.330> faculty

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
that definitely benefits of the faculty

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.630 
that definitely benefits of the faculty
as<00:00:27.720> fast<00:00:27.930> aerials<00:00:28.410> but<00:00:28.619> because<00:00:29.160> he's<00:00:29.279> slow<00:00:29.519> in

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
as fast aerials but because he's slow in

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:30.529 
as fast aerials but because he's slow in
the<00:00:29.670> air<00:00:29.820> he's<00:00:29.970> gonna<00:00:30.060> have<00:00:30.269> a<00:00:30.300> lot<00:00:30.510> more

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
the air he's gonna have a lot more
