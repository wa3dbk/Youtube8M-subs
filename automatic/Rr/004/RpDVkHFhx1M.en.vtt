00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:14.990
 hello friends are very rare and exercise 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:17.039
 which is called raider thrust 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.289
 almost anywhere you find both 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.599
 do it right 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:24.419
 the meaning of this exercise is that it 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:29.369
 promotes stretching your nursing 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:31.619
 cartilage this exercise is very important for 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.110
 those young guys who are still 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.030
 growth phase 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:38.910
 known that our bones in general 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:43.410
 continue to grow up to twenty twenty 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:46.559
 five years respectively chest cartilage 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.109
 if they stretch them 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.980
 your chest will increase 

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:52.920
 cell exactly 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.929
 and the bone basis will increase 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.960
 this is very good because the more 

00:00:54.929 --> 00:01:00.649
 the backbone is all the more massive on them 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.699
 Looks later on muscles and 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:04.890
 special breathing exercise 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:08.280
 squats various options for pullovers 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.590
 when you do intense hyper 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.530
 ventilation of your lungs respectively 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.530
 pile cage expands you chest 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.990
 things seem to be pushed out and in 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.450
 this condition is most often recommended 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.830
 doing a pullover with a dumbbell in order 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.840
 to fasten secure 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.180
 here is the discrepancy fix something 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.930
 condition that enters scream during 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:35.000
 similar exercises one of the options 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:37.250
 pullover without dumbbells only 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.280
 is the raider's meaning of this 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.920
 exercise is that you 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.690
 select the optimal position 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.360
 next to any angle in general 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.420
 you can do it in your apartment 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:53.210
 should be almost straight 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.490
 almost straight and you are very strong 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.800
 bend 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.990
 that is, popova is drawn back chest 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:03.740
 you have put forward you need to 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:06.200
 originated deflection of the loins and certain 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:09.020
 chest tension occurs 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:12.800
 it follows you can move 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:14.930
 hands up down wider further in general 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:18.950
 pick up this position when it arises 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:23.090
 tension that's your body it hangs like 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:25.880
 on your chest and not when it happens 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:28.640
 need a little use of strength 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:31.840
 attraction give your body the weight of your 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:34.610
 bodies down and at the same time 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.780
 make as if squeezing hand corner 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.040
 must each other 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:41.840
 need to thread they press each other 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.820
 you drop a little body 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.940
 body down with do not forget 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:49.190
 leave the pelvis backward respectively very 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:52.800
 you can often even hear distinct 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:55.200
 click here in this place 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:03:01.050
 if you do regular breathing 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:03.540
 squats who often happens you go 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:05.460
 then home and you know something like that 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.570
 discomfort is a feeling that the bone is not 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:09.000
 in its place 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:10.770
 somehow, well, not that hard to breathe 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.660
 but you feel some kind of light 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:17.460
 worry you make raider pull 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:21.020
 stand near the corner of the building or 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:24.900
 bend yourself in the apartment 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:26.810
 here it looks like this 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:30.650
 the way we are here here 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:33.300
 feels like a click i mean you are like a cat 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:35.940
 pull up pull up before 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:39.690
 moment until you feel that the breast 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:41.880
 screaming stalin places if you're young 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.490
 age is often even heard 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:48.750
 distinct click anyway 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:50.490
 I've had it many times after that 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.140
 Well, that anxiety is she 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:55.800
 disappeared from the chest things like 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:58.140
 becomes in place and in general you yourself 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:01.290
 feel like a normal person again 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:05.640
 the main nuances of the hand should stand 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:08.780
 and above the level of your eyes they should be 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:12.209
 close enough to each other 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:15.270
 Tass you will bend that is should 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:18.049
 distinct bending of the waist and must 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:22.020
 be tension that is you as it were 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:24.750
 put your body weight on straightened 

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:27.690
 hands try to put the body on the wall and 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:29.370
 here it is tension is very important to pick up 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.140
 closer position 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.910
 here are the walls to feel 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:34.550
 it's tension and that's when you 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:41.430
 felt this tension 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:44.220
 you let out the air and very smoothly 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:46.950
 gently put your body weight down your arms 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:51.220
 begin to crush each other here 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:54.340
 I would have a click here 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:59.730
 if i were younger so here 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:59.730
