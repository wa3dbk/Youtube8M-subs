freed from this kind of help what's your
take<00:00:20.130> on<00:00:20.279> this<00:00:20.430> well<00:00:21.240> I<00:00:21.270> mean<00:00:21.480> we<00:00:21.660> had<00:00:21.810> an

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
take on this well I mean we had an

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.070 
take on this well I mean we had an
extraordinary<00:00:22.380> year<00:00:23.090> 2009<00:00:24.090> the<00:00:24.359> returns<00:00:24.779> in

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
extraordinary year 2009 the returns in

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.050 
extraordinary year 2009 the returns in
emerging<00:00:25.590> economies<00:00:25.800> was<00:00:26.490> frequently<00:00:27.000> a

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
emerging economies was frequently a

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.359 
emerging economies was frequently a
hundred<00:00:27.420> percent<00:00:27.510> do<00:00:27.930> more<00:00:28.199> we<00:00:28.890> also<00:00:29.130> had

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
hundred percent do more we also had

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.160 
hundred percent do more we also had
commodities<00:00:30.029> that<00:00:30.060> went<00:00:30.449> up<00:00:30.660> more<00:00:30.990> than<00:00:31.109> a

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
commodities that went up more than a

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.310 
commodities that went up more than a
hundred<00:00:31.349> percent<00:00:31.640> so<00:00:32.640> 2010<00:00:33.630> will<00:00:33.870> not<00:00:34.050> have

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
hundred percent so 2010 will not have

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.100 
hundred percent so 2010 will not have
these<00:00:34.620> kind<00:00:35.010> of<00:00:35.160> returns<00:00:35.610> I<00:00:36.180> think<00:00:36.690> they'll<00:00:36.840> be

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
these kind of returns I think they'll be

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.680 
these kind of returns I think they'll be
more<00:00:37.320> moderate<00:00:37.710> or<00:00:38.040> if<00:00:38.940> i<00:00:39.180> look<00:00:39.390> at<00:00:39.570> the

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
more moderate or if i look at the

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.650 
more moderate or if i look at the
consensus<00:00:40.440> is<00:00:40.649> all<00:00:41.090> complacency<00:00:42.090> and<00:00:42.480> that

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
consensus is all complacency and that

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.660 
consensus is all complacency and that
the<00:00:42.780> market<00:00:43.200> will<00:00:43.320> end<00:00:43.530> up<00:00:43.770> slightly<00:00:44.219> higher

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
the market will end up slightly higher

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.700 
the market will end up slightly higher
this<00:00:45.059> year<00:00:45.120> I<00:00:45.570> think<00:00:45.960> we<00:00:46.289> could<00:00:46.500> have<00:00:46.530> a

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
this year I think we could have a

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.279 
this year I think we could have a
meaningful<00:00:47.370> correction<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.390> then<00:00:49.020> more

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
meaningful correction and then more

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.740 
meaningful correction and then more
quantitative<00:00:50.129> easing<00:00:50.340> and<00:00:50.850> then<00:00:51.059> but<00:00:51.510> maybe

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
quantitative easing and then but maybe

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.619 
quantitative easing and then but maybe
the<00:00:52.110> highs<00:00:52.320> will<00:00:52.800> be<00:00:52.829> seen<00:00:53.219> very<00:00:53.250> soon<00:00:53.940> or<00:00:54.270> even

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
the highs will be seen very soon or even

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.529 
the highs will be seen very soon or even
today<00:00:54.989> and<00:00:55.320> they're<00:00:56.190> off<00:00:56.460> to<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.879> markets<00:00:57.329> may

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
today and they're off to the markets may

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.569 
today and they're off to the markets may
not<00:00:57.719> perform<00:00:58.050> all<00:00:58.440> that<00:00:58.649> well<00:00:58.890> and<00:00:59.160> will<00:00:59.370> it<00:00:59.489> be

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
not perform all that well and will it be

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.369 
not perform all that well and will it be
a<00:00:59.609> place<00:00:59.820> to<00:01:00.059> hide<00:01:00.390> or<00:01:00.660> do<00:01:00.750> relatively<00:01:01.170> better

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
a place to hide or do relatively better

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.399 
a place to hide or do relatively better
well<00:01:01.710> I<00:01:01.739> think<00:01:02.010> that<00:01:02.629> there<00:01:03.629> are<00:01:03.660> some

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
well I think that there are some

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.530 
well I think that there are some
companies<00:01:04.949> in<00:01:05.159> Asia<00:01:05.369> that<00:01:05.790> are<00:01:06.000> reasonably

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
companies in Asia that are reasonably

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.840 
companies in Asia that are reasonably
inexpensive<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:07.619> selling<00:01:07.950> at<00:01:08.100> say<00:01:08.280> ten<00:01:08.490> times

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
inexpensive to selling at say ten times

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.700 
inexpensive to selling at say ten times
earnings<00:01:09.360> they<00:01:09.630> have<00:01:09.750> dividend<00:01:10.290> yields<00:01:10.619> or

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
earnings they have dividend yields or

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.830 
earnings they have dividend yields or
four<00:01:10.950> or<00:01:11.040> five<00:01:11.070> percent<00:01:11.640> so<00:01:12.240> with<00:01:12.510> zero

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
four or five percent so with zero

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.710 
four or five percent so with zero
interest<00:01:13.260> rates<00:01:13.560> on<00:01:13.890> your<00:01:14.100> deposits<00:01:14.880> I<00:01:15.030> don't

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
interest rates on your deposits I don't

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.300 
interest rates on your deposits I don't
think<00:01:15.780> that<00:01:16.049> these<00:01:16.229> companies<00:01:16.740> have<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:16.950> huge

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
think that these companies have a huge

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.429 
think that these companies have a huge
downside<00:01:17.610> risk<00:01:18.150> I<00:01:18.420> also<00:01:18.600> happen<00:01:18.869> to<00:01:19.080> think

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
downside risk I also happen to think

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.960 
downside risk I also happen to think
that<00:01:19.530> if<00:01:20.280> i<00:01:20.400> look<00:01:20.549> at<00:01:20.700> commodities<00:01:21.290> the<00:01:22.290> one

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:22.970 
that if i look at commodities the one

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.060 
that if i look at commodities the one
sector<00:01:23.970> of<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.090> commodity<00:01:24.689> markets<00:01:25.320> that

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
sector of the commodity markets that

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.310 
sector of the commodity markets that
didn't<00:01:26.640> go<00:01:26.820> up<00:01:27.090> last<00:01:27.570> year<00:01:27.930> were<00:01:28.140> the

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
didn't go up last year were the

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.469 
didn't go up last year were the
agricultural<00:01:29.040> commodities<00:01:29.670> so<00:01:30.329> I<00:01:30.390> think

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
agricultural commodities so I think

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.630 
agricultural commodities so I think
there<00:01:30.840> we<00:01:31.020> make<00:01:31.229> it<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:31.439> move<00:01:31.740> in<00:01:31.979> wheat<00:01:32.189> prices

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
there we make it a move in wheat prices

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.810 
there we make it a move in wheat prices
corn<00:01:33.180> soybeans<00:01:33.900> so<00:01:34.590> that<00:01:34.799> would<00:01:34.979> be<00:01:35.009> a<00:01:35.189> sector

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
corn soybeans so that would be a sector

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.810 
corn soybeans so that would be a sector
to<00:01:36.030> look<00:01:36.150> at<00:01:36.360> and<00:01:36.930> then<00:01:37.320> I<00:01:37.470> still<00:01:37.829> feel<00:01:38.159> that<00:01:38.189> in

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
to look at and then I still feel that in

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.109 
to look at and then I still feel that in
the<00:01:38.939> mining<00:01:39.360> sector<00:01:39.630> we<00:01:40.530> have<00:01:40.770> a<00:01:41.119> numerous

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
the mining sector we have a numerous

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.929 
the mining sector we have a numerous
gold<00:01:42.509> exploration<00:01:42.960> companies<00:01:43.920> that<00:01:44.610> are

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
gold exploration companies that are

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.550 
gold exploration companies that are
quite<00:01:45.570> good<00:01:45.600> value<00:01:46.290> given<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.310> fact<00:01:47.579> that

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
quite good value given the fact that

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.899 
quite good value given the fact that
essentially<00:01:49.560> more<00:01:49.860> money<00:01:50.130> printing<00:01:50.759> is

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
essentially more money printing is

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.929
