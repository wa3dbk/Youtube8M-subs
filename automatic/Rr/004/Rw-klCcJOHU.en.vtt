case<00:00:20.400> you'll<00:00:20.609> be<00:00:20.670> using<00:00:20.880> on<00:00:21.090> the<00:00:21.240> specimen

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
case you'll be using on the specimen

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.189 
case you'll be using on the specimen
project<00:00:22.170> and<00:00:22.380> on<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:22.740> cube<00:00:23.699> rendering<00:00:24.210> so

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
project and on the cube rendering so

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.810 
project and on the cube rendering so
here's<00:00:25.800> kind<00:00:26.039> of<00:00:26.070> how<00:00:26.160> you<00:00:26.220> do<00:00:26.400> it<00:00:26.490> I<00:00:26.580> think<00:00:26.609> I

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
here's kind of how you do it I think I

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.339 
here's kind of how you do it I think I
can<00:00:26.880> show<00:00:27.150> you<00:00:27.210> just<00:00:27.269> in<00:00:27.510> Photoshop<00:00:27.990> normally

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
can show you just in Photoshop normally

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:29.390 
can show you just in Photoshop normally
this<00:00:28.500> is<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:28.680> kind<00:00:28.920> of<00:00:28.949> thing<00:00:29.130> I<00:00:29.220> would<00:00:29.369> just

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
this is the kind of thing I would just

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.490 
this is the kind of thing I would just
demo<00:00:29.849> in<00:00:30.119> person<00:00:30.510> in<00:00:30.599> class<00:00:30.779> but<00:00:31.109> since<00:00:31.349> we're

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
demo in person in class but since we're

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.350 
demo in person in class but since we're
not<00:00:31.590> meeting<00:00:32.070> this<00:00:32.340> week<00:00:32.870> so<00:00:33.870> here's<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.350> idea

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:35.360 
not meeting this week so here's the idea

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.790 
not meeting this week so here's the idea
take<00:00:36.360> a<00:00:36.390> piece<00:00:36.690> of<00:00:36.870> tracing<00:00:37.230> paper

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
take a piece of tracing paper

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.310 
take a piece of tracing paper
don't<00:00:38.100> take<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:39.000> layout<00:00:39.360> pad<00:00:39.690> of<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:39.989> marker

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
don't take the layout pad of the marker

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.100 
don't take the layout pad of the marker
paper<00:00:40.579> you<00:00:41.579> want<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:42.030> thinner<00:00:42.329> tracing<00:00:42.930> paper

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
paper you want the thinner tracing paper

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.950 
paper you want the thinner tracing paper
and<00:00:43.700> so<00:00:44.700> let's<00:00:44.940> say<00:00:45.120> this<00:00:45.270> is<00:00:45.329> our<00:00:45.539> piece<00:00:45.930> of

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
and so let's say this is our piece of

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:52.939 
and so let's say this is our piece of
tracing<00:00:46.320> paper<00:00:51.260> okay<00:00:52.260> so<00:00:52.320> that's<00:00:52.620> your<00:00:52.739> piece

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
tracing paper okay so that's your piece

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.380 
tracing paper okay so that's your piece
of<00:00:53.070> tracing<00:00:53.309> paper<00:00:53.460> and<00:00:53.699> what<00:00:53.940> I<00:00:53.969> want<00:00:54.210> you<00:00:54.270> to

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
of tracing paper and what I want you to

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.630 
of tracing paper and what I want you to
do<00:00:54.480> is<00:00:54.570> tape<00:00:55.199> it<00:00:55.230> down<00:00:55.760> using<00:00:56.760> masking<00:00:57.390> tape<00:00:57.690> to

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
do is tape it down using masking tape to

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:05.000 
do is tape it down using masking tape to
a<00:01:01.370> tape<00:01:02.370> it<00:01:02.550> down<00:01:02.730> to<00:01:03.030> a<00:01:03.059> to<00:01:04.049> smooth<00:01:04.530> surface

make sure the surface is smooth

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.469 
make sure the surface is smooth
underneath<00:01:07.140> use<00:01:07.619> use<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.520> masking<00:01:09.000> tape<00:01:09.030> make

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
underneath use use the masking tape make

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.420 
underneath use use the masking tape make
sure<00:01:09.659> it's<00:01:09.810> taped<00:01:10.170> all<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.680> way<00:01:10.799> across<00:01:11.159> on

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.780 
sure it's taped all the way across on
all<00:01:11.580> four<00:01:11.880> edges<00:01:12.030> you'll<00:01:12.600> understand<00:01:13.049> why

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
all four edges you'll understand why

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.950 
all four edges you'll understand why
actually<00:01:14.790> you'll<00:01:15.150> understand<00:01:15.570> why<00:01:15.720> if<00:01:15.869> you

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
actually you'll understand why if you

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.490 
actually you'll understand why if you
don't<00:01:16.259> do<00:01:16.439> this<00:01:17.330> so<00:01:18.330> you've<00:01:18.689> got<00:01:18.900> to<00:01:18.990> tape<00:01:19.259> down

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
don't do this so you've got to tape down

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.730 
don't do this so you've got to tape down
to<00:01:19.680> a<00:01:19.710> nice<00:01:19.950> smooth<00:01:20.280> surface

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
to a nice smooth surface

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:27.020 
to a nice smooth surface
take<00:01:22.740> your<00:01:22.920> graphite<00:01:23.840> sharpener<00:01:24.840> you<00:01:26.030> know

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
take your graphite sharpener you know

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.880 
take your graphite sharpener you know
the<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.570> letter<00:01:27.840> holder<00:01:28.020> thing<00:01:28.439> remember<00:01:28.799> how

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
the the letter holder thing remember how

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.260 
the the letter holder thing remember how
I<00:01:28.920> told<00:01:29.070> you<00:01:29.340> guys<00:01:29.689> not<00:01:30.689> to<00:01:31.640> not<00:01:32.640> to<00:01:32.850> dump<00:01:33.090> the

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
I told you guys not to not to dump the

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.149 
I told you guys not to not to dump the
lid<00:01:34.430> so<00:01:35.430> this<00:01:35.640> is<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:35.909> little<00:01:36.000> deal<00:01:37.100> this<00:01:38.100> is

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
lid so this is the little deal this is

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.160 
lid so this is the little deal this is
why<00:01:38.520> basically<00:01:39.030> if<00:01:39.090> you<00:01:39.180> open<00:01:39.540> this<00:01:39.659> up<00:01:39.869> you're

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
why basically if you open this up you're

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.020 
why basically if you open this up you're
you<00:01:40.439> will<00:01:40.619> have<00:01:40.829> accumulated<00:01:41.280> a<00:01:41.700> bunch<00:01:41.909> of

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
you will have accumulated a bunch of

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.359 
you will have accumulated a bunch of
dust<00:01:42.329> and<00:01:42.750> what<00:01:43.590> you're<00:01:43.740> gonna<00:01:43.829> do<00:01:44.070> is<00:01:44.189> open

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
dust and what you're gonna do is open

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.170 
dust and what you're gonna do is open
this<00:01:44.610> thing<00:01:44.670> up<00:01:45.090> and<00:01:46.100> then<00:01:47.100> dump<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.880> dust

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
this thing up and then dump the dust

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.249 
this thing up and then dump the dust
kind<00:01:49.020> of<00:01:49.369> just<00:01:50.369> all<00:01:50.579> over<00:01:51.240> this<00:01:51.360> trend<00:01:51.750> spread

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
kind of just all over this trend spread

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.520 
kind of just all over this trend spread
it<00:01:52.380> around<00:01:52.530> evenly<00:01:53.130> just<00:01:53.310> sprinkle<00:01:54.030> it<00:01:54.200> if<00:01:55.200> you

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
it around evenly just sprinkle it if you

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.709 
it around evenly just sprinkle it if you
don't<00:01:55.710> have<00:01:55.920> enough<00:01:56.189> in<00:01:56.369> there<00:01:56.610> what<00:01:57.570> you

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
don't have enough in there what you

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.639 
don't have enough in there what you
might<00:01:57.930> want<00:01:58.110> to<00:01:58.170> do<00:01:58.380> is<00:01:58.649> take<00:01:59.490> a<00:02:00.530> take<00:02:01.530> an

and in the end what you'll end up with
is<00:04:14.100> you'll<00:04:14.280> end<00:04:14.340> up<00:04:14.520> with<00:04:14.700> something<00:04:15.120> that

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:15.240 
is you'll end up with something that

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:18.710 
is you'll end up with something that
looks<00:04:15.270> kind<00:04:15.780> of<00:04:15.960> like<00:04:16.140> this<00:04:17.480> you'll<00:04:18.480> end<00:04:18.600> up

looks kind of like this you'll end up

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.960 
looks kind of like this you'll end up
with<00:04:18.870> a<00:04:18.900> sheet

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
with a sheet

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.560 
with a sheet
that<00:04:21.209> is<00:04:21.470> basically<00:04:22.550> what<00:04:23.550> what<00:04:23.820> happens<00:04:24.300> is

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
that is basically what what happens is

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.360 
that is basically what what happens is
the<00:04:25.170> best<00:04:25.410> thing<00:04:25.620> one<00:04:25.800> of<00:04:25.830> the<00:04:25.920> reasons<00:04:26.250> this

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
the best thing one of the reasons this

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:30.680 
the best thing one of the reasons this
is<00:04:26.520> useful<00:04:26.760> stuff<00:04:27.210> in<00:04:27.390> this<00:04:27.540> case<00:04:27.780> is<00:04:28.020> it<00:04:29.690> it

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
is useful stuff in this case is it it

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:33.170 
is useful stuff in this case is it it
liquefies<00:04:31.650> the<00:04:31.680> graphite<00:04:32.430> and<00:04:32.640> essentially

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
liquefies the graphite and essentially

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.320 
liquefies the graphite and essentially
impregnates<00:04:34.080> the<00:04:34.230> graphite<00:04:34.890> into<00:04:35.190> that<00:04:35.550> into

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
impregnates the graphite into that into

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.870 
impregnates the graphite into that into
the<00:04:36.450> tracing<00:04:36.930> paper<00:04:36.980> so<00:04:37.980> that<00:04:38.010> it<00:04:38.280> and<00:04:38.610> then<00:04:38.760> it

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
the tracing paper so that it and then it

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.030 
the tracing paper so that it and then it
evaporates<00:04:39.180> out<00:04:39.720> and<00:04:39.960> so<00:04:40.110> the<00:04:40.260> the<00:04:40.620> graphite

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:41.040 
evaporates out and so the the graphite

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.460 
evaporates out and so the the graphite
just<00:04:41.280> stays<00:04:41.550> in<00:04:41.850> there<00:04:42.030> now<00:04:42.270> when<00:04:43.080> you<00:04:43.200> write

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:43.470 
just stays in there now when you write

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:45.080 
just stays in there now when you write
on<00:04:43.680> that<00:04:43.890> when<00:04:44.100> you<00:04:44.190> proceed<00:04:44.610> to<00:04:44.640> write<00:04:44.880> on

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
on that when you proceed to write on

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:49.760 
on that when you proceed to write on
this<00:04:46.340> you<00:04:47.340> know<00:04:47.460> with<00:04:47.580> another<00:04:48.590> let's<00:04:49.590> say<00:04:49.740> a

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:49.770 
this you know with another let's say a

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:51.200 
this you know with another let's say a
sharp<00:04:50.130> pencil<00:04:50.400> or<00:04:50.610> something<00:04:50.670> you<00:04:51.030> know<00:04:51.150> you

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210 
sharp pencil or something you know you

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:56.650 
sharp pencil or something you know you
could<00:04:51.570> say<00:04:51.780> write<00:04:52.530> your<00:04:52.740> name<00:04:52.920> like<00:04:53.250> this<00:04:54.860> and

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:56.660 
could say write your name like this and

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:01.520 
could say write your name like this and
it<00:04:57.660> would<00:04:57.930> it<00:04:58.920> would<00:04:59.190> transfer<00:05:00.120> it<00:05:00.240> on<00:05:00.990> to<00:05:01.410> the

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:01.530 
it would it would transfer it on to the

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:04.310 
it would it would transfer it on to the
next<00:05:01.710> sheet<00:05:02.100> so<00:05:02.430> you<00:05:02.820> can<00:05:03.000> transfer<00:05:03.330> a<00:05:03.630> drawing

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 
next sheet so you can transfer a drawing

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:05.990 
next sheet so you can transfer a drawing
you<00:05:04.620> can<00:05:04.770> take<00:05:04.920> a<00:05:04.950> tracing<00:05:05.460> paper<00:05:05.610> drawing

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 
you can take a tracing paper drawing

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.790 
you can take a tracing paper drawing
like<00:05:06.180> your<00:05:06.390> cube<00:05:06.690> City<00:05:06.960> for<00:05:07.200> instance<00:05:07.290> or<00:05:07.650> your

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:07.800 
like your cube City for instance or your

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.760 
like your cube City for instance or your
specimen<00:05:08.340> reference<00:05:08.840> you<00:05:09.840> can<00:05:10.020> trace<00:05:10.320> over<00:05:10.590> it

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:10.770 
specimen reference you can trace over it

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:13.430 
specimen reference you can trace over it
and<00:05:11.720> transfer<00:05:12.720> it<00:05:12.840> onto<00:05:13.020> a<00:05:13.140> piece<00:05:13.380> of

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440 
and transfer it onto a piece of

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.630 
and transfer it onto a piece of
illustration<00:05:14.160> board<00:05:14.370> so<00:05:14.669> in<00:05:15.630> any<00:05:15.750> case<00:05:15.840> that's

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:16.640 
illustration board so in any case that's

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:21.110 
illustration board so in any case that's
all<00:05:17.640> there<00:05:17.880> is<00:05:18.000> to<00:05:18.240> it<00:05:19.310> now<00:05:20.310> you<00:05:20.370> can<00:05:20.640> also<00:05:20.760> buy

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.680 
all there is to it now you can also buy
the<00:05:21.180> graphite<00:05:21.690> transfer<00:05:21.840> paper<00:05:23.510> excuse<00:05:24.510> me

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:24.690 
the graphite transfer paper excuse me

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:28.970 
the graphite transfer paper excuse me
still<00:05:25.020> a<00:05:25.050> little<00:05:25.260> bit<00:05:25.500> sick<00:05:26.810> you<00:05:27.810> can<00:05:28.020> you<00:05:28.800> can

still a little bit sick you can you can
purchase<00:05:29.220> the<00:05:29.550> graphite<00:05:29.910> transfer<00:05:30.030> paper<00:05:30.600> but

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:30.780 
purchase the graphite transfer paper but

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:32.390 
purchase the graphite transfer paper but
considering<00:05:31.710> that<00:05:31.800> you<00:05:31.950> have<00:05:32.130> a<00:05:32.160> little

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 
considering that you have a little

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.670 
considering that you have a little
supplies<00:05:33.360> you<00:05:33.630> need<00:05:33.780> I<00:05:33.840> would<00:05:34.050> just<00:05:34.290> go<00:05:34.470> ahead

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:34.680 
supplies you need I would just go ahead

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:36.200 
supplies you need I would just go ahead
and<00:05:34.800> make<00:05:34.950> one<00:05:34.980> and<00:05:35.310> it's<00:05:35.430> kind<00:05:35.700> of<00:05:35.760> a<00:05:35.850> useful

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:36.210 
and make one and it's kind of a useful

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.330 
and make one and it's kind of a useful
skill<00:05:36.360> to<00:05:36.600> have<00:05:36.780> these<00:05:37.380> things<00:05:37.770> last<00:05:38.040> forever

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:38.340 
skill to have these things last forever

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:40.520 
skill to have these things last forever
I<00:05:38.760> just<00:05:39.180> make<00:05:39.570> sure<00:05:39.720> your<00:05:39.900> pencil<00:05:40.200> is<00:05:40.320> real

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:40.530 
I just make sure your pencil is real

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:41.930 
I just make sure your pencil is real
sharp<00:05:40.800> when<00:05:40.979> you're<00:05:41.100> using<00:05:41.250> to<00:05:41.550> make<00:05:41.669> sure<00:05:41.850> you

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:41.940 
sharp when you're using to make sure you

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:44.330 
sharp when you're using to make sure you
use<00:05:42.150> enough<00:05:42.180> graphite<00:05:42.810> anyway<00:05:43.620> I<00:05:43.979> think

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:44.340 
use enough graphite anyway I think

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:46.100 
use enough graphite anyway I think
that's<00:05:44.520> about<00:05:44.760> it<00:05:44.910> again<00:05:45.180> please<00:05:45.570> be<00:05:45.600> careful

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:46.110 
that's about it again please be careful

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:49.280 
that's about it again please be careful
with<00:05:46.200> the<00:05:46.350> Bestine<00:05:46.770> and<00:05:47.040> try<00:05:47.430> not<00:05:47.580> to<00:05:48.290> blow

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:49.290 
with the Bestine and try not to blow

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:51.350 
with the Bestine and try not to blow
anything<00:05:49.320> up<00:05:49.800> so<00:05:50.070> anyway

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:51.360 
anything up so anyway

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:56.090 
anything up so anyway

00:05:58.850 --> 00:05:58.860 
next demo is probably gonna be on white

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:01.340 
next demo is probably gonna be on white
on<00:05:59.070> kind<00:05:59.669> of<00:05:59.760> basics<00:06:00.240> of<00:06:00.450> lighting<00:06:00.690> and<00:06:00.960> forms

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:01.350 
on kind of basics of lighting and forms

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:05.180 
on kind of basics of lighting and forms
so<00:06:01.620> I'll<00:06:02.340> talk<00:06:02.669> to<00:06:02.700> you<00:06:02.820> in<00:06:02.880> a<00:06:02.940> few<00:06:03.060> minutes
