what i wanted to do is show you how to

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.140 
what i wanted to do is show you how to
make<00:00:08.550> a<00:00:08.580> simple<00:00:09.030> nut<00:00:09.269> milk<00:00:09.570> in<00:00:09.990> this<00:00:10.230> juicer<00:00:10.679> so

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:11.150 
make a simple nut milk in this juicer so

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:13.400 
make a simple nut milk in this juicer so
first<00:00:12.150> thing<00:00:12.269> to<00:00:12.360> say<00:00:12.509> is<00:00:12.690> that<00:00:13.049> I've<00:00:13.200> been

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
first thing to say is that I've been

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:14.360 
first thing to say is that I've been
soaking<00:00:13.650> my<00:00:13.980> nuts

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
soaking my nuts

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.000 
soaking my nuts
so<00:00:14.700> my<00:00:15.150> nuts<00:00:15.450> have<00:00:16.049> actually<00:00:16.379> been<00:00:16.500> soaked<00:00:16.830> so

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
so my nuts have actually been soaked so

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.950 
so my nuts have actually been soaked so
they've<00:00:17.190> been<00:00:17.310> activated<00:00:17.760> and<00:00:18.150> I've<00:00:18.660> then

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
they've been activated and I've then

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.310 
they've been activated and I've then
actually<00:00:20.090> drained<00:00:21.090> those<00:00:21.359> nuts<00:00:21.660> and<00:00:21.930> replaced

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
actually drained those nuts and replaced

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.140 
actually drained those nuts and replaced
them<00:00:22.439> with<00:00:22.500> fresh<00:00:22.920> replace<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:23.699> water<00:00:23.880> with

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
them with fresh replace the water with

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.029 
them with fresh replace the water with
fresh<00:00:24.390> filtered<00:00:24.600> water<00:00:24.990> for<00:00:25.199> this<00:00:25.560> process

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
fresh filtered water for this process

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.580 
fresh filtered water for this process
and<00:00:26.939> I'm<00:00:27.119> working<00:00:27.300> on<00:00:27.480> a<00:00:27.570> ratio<00:00:27.779> of<00:00:27.990> roughly

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
and I'm working on a ratio of roughly

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.209 
and I'm working on a ratio of roughly
kind<00:00:29.369> of<00:00:29.720> three-to-one<00:00:30.720> water<00:00:31.050> to<00:00:31.380> nuts<00:00:31.590> so

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
kind of three-to-one water to nuts so

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.959 
kind of three-to-one water to nuts so
you<00:00:32.520> know<00:00:32.759> no<00:00:33.059> specific<00:00:34.340> weight<00:00:35.340> of<00:00:35.370> nuts<00:00:35.850> or

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
you know no specific weight of nuts or

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.250 
you know no specific weight of nuts or
anything<00:00:36.090> like<00:00:36.390> that<00:00:36.420> but<00:00:36.690> I<00:00:36.750> just<00:00:37.020> tend<00:00:37.170> to

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
anything like that but I just tend to

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.100 
anything like that but I just tend to
use<00:00:37.410> a<00:00:37.440> glass<00:00:37.770> or<00:00:38.160> mug<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:38.700> I<00:00:39.149> will<00:00:39.300> put<00:00:39.510> in<00:00:39.660> you

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
use a glass or mug and I will put in you

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.740 
use a glass or mug and I will put in you
know<00:00:40.140> a<00:00:40.559> cup<00:00:41.010> for<00:00:41.280> you<00:00:41.850> know<00:00:41.940> a<00:00:41.969> percentage<00:00:42.629> of

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
know a cup for you know a percentage of

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.360 
know a cup for you know a percentage of
that<00:00:42.930> cup<00:00:43.170> full<00:00:43.379> and<00:00:43.860> then<00:00:44.010> I'll<00:00:44.129> basically

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
that cup full and then I'll basically

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.139 
that cup full and then I'll basically
add<00:00:44.850> 3<00:00:45.719> times<00:00:46.050> that<00:00:46.379> same<00:00:46.680> volume<00:00:47.190> in<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.940> cup

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
add 3 times that same volume in the cup

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.549 
add 3 times that same volume in the cup
with<00:00:48.660> water<00:00:49.250> so<00:00:50.250> very<00:00:50.489> very<00:00:50.670> simple<00:00:51.030> process

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:51.559 
with water so very very simple process

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:54.380 
with water so very very simple process

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.070 

and<00:01:36.460> while<00:01:36.640> this<00:01:36.790> is<00:01:36.970> going<00:01:37.030> as<00:01:37.630> I<00:01:37.690> say<00:01:38.020> I'm

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.080 
and while this is going as I say I'm

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.540 
and while this is going as I say I'm
just<00:01:38.260> going<00:01:38.380> to<00:01:38.410> add<00:01:38.560> in<00:01:38.680> a<00:01:38.920> little<00:01:39.310> bit<00:01:39.430> of

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:39.550 
just going to add in a little bit of

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:41.520 
just going to add in a little bit of
cinnamon<00:01:39.820> so<00:01:40.420> just<00:01:40.660> like<00:01:40.780> a<00:01:40.810> spoonful<00:01:41.500> of

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
cinnamon so just like a spoonful of

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.240 
cinnamon so just like a spoonful of
cinnamon<00:01:42.210> maybe<00:01:43.210> a<00:01:43.300> touch<00:01:43.900> more<00:01:44.170> and<00:01:44.440> that

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
cinnamon maybe a touch more and that

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:46.890 
cinnamon maybe a touch more and that
will<00:01:45.400> just<00:01:45.520> again<00:01:45.880> add<00:01:46.030> to<00:01:46.240> the<00:01:46.330> flavor<00:01:46.570> and

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:46.900 
will just again add to the flavor and

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:55.709 
will just again add to the flavor and
sweetness<00:01:47.080> of<00:01:47.560> the<00:01:47.650> milk

00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:55.719 

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:58.169

00:01:58.169 --> 00:01:58.179 
now that I've got my jug down a fair

00:01:58.179 --> 00:01:59.760 
now that I've got my jug down a fair
amount<00:01:58.270> I<00:01:58.569> can<00:01:58.749> probably<00:01:58.929> just<00:01:59.079> pour<00:01:59.469> some<00:01:59.740> of

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
amount I can probably just pour some of

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:10.480 
amount I can probably just pour some of
this<00:01:59.920> in

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:10.490 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.360 

and<00:02:11.490> there<00:02:12.360> you<00:02:12.420> go

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
and there you go

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:19.490 
and there you go
one<00:02:14.370> simple<00:02:15.440> cinnamon<00:02:16.550> cashew<00:02:17.600> nut<00:02:18.600> milk<00:02:18.870> made

in<00:02:19.740> the<00:02:19.830> optimum<00:02:20.160> 600<00:02:21.800> and<00:02:22.800> I<00:02:22.890> know<00:02:22.950> this<00:02:23.250> is

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
in the optimum 600 and I know this is

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.520 
in the optimum 600 and I know this is
going<00:02:23.520> to<00:02:23.580> be<00:02:23.670> good<00:02:23.850> so<00:02:24.390> I<00:02:24.420> just<00:02:24.900> got<00:02:25.200> a<00:02:25.230> pour
