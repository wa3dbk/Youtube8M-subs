so<00:00:01.380> I've<00:00:01.500> opened<00:00:01.740> up<00:00:02.070> the<00:00:02.340> ipython<00:00:03.090> notebooks

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:04.070 
so I've opened up the ipython notebooks

always<00:00:08.370> what<00:00:08.700> we're<00:00:08.880> going<00:00:09.030> to<00:00:09.210> do<00:00:09.360> is<00:00:09.630> cop

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
always what we're going to do is cop

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.650 
always what we're going to do is cop
make<00:00:10.830> a<00:00:10.860> copy<00:00:11.220> and<00:00:13.790> what<00:00:14.790> do<00:00:14.880> we<00:00:14.970> have<00:00:15.179> here

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
make a copy and what do we have here

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.099 
make a copy and what do we have here
well<00:00:15.870> I<00:00:16.109> conveniently<00:00:17.039> put<00:00:17.310> the<00:00:18.119> table<00:00:18.900> that

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
well I conveniently put the table that

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.229 
well I conveniently put the table that
indicates<00:00:19.650> how<00:00:19.919> the<00:00:19.980> weather<00:00:20.339> changes<00:00:20.460> in<00:00:20.999> our

00:00:21.229 --> 00:00:21.239 
indicates how the weather changes in our

00:00:21.239 --> 00:00:22.909 
indicates how the weather changes in our
idealized<00:00:21.689> world<00:00:22.019> from<00:00:22.409> today<00:00:22.679> to<00:00:22.739> tomorrow

00:00:22.909 --> 00:00:22.919 
idealized world from today to tomorrow

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:26.989 
idealized world from today to tomorrow
for<00:00:23.640> any<00:00:23.759> day<00:00:23.999> and<00:00:24.919> I<00:00:25.919> went<00:00:26.130> ahead<00:00:26.279> and<00:00:26.729> created

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:26.999 
for any day and I went ahead and created

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:30.649 
for any day and I went ahead and created
the<00:00:27.300> transition<00:00:27.869> matrix<00:00:28.319> P<00:00:28.649> and<00:00:29.419> we<00:00:30.419> better

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:30.659 
the transition matrix P and we better

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:32.870 
the transition matrix P and we better
make<00:00:30.869> sure<00:00:30.899> that<00:00:31.499> we<00:00:31.769> execute<00:00:32.099> that<00:00:32.340> so<00:00:32.760> we

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
make sure that we execute that so we

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.210 
make sure that we execute that so we
have<00:00:33.060> it<00:00:33.240> and<00:00:34.370> then<00:00:35.370> to<00:00:35.700> indicate<00:00:36.180> that<00:00:37.220> today

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:38.220 
have it and then to indicate that today

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.820 
have it and then to indicate that today
is<00:00:38.460> cloudy<00:00:38.820> we<00:00:39.630> discussed<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.260> fact<00:00:40.470> that<00:00:40.710> we

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:40.830 
is cloudy we discussed the fact that we

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:42.860 
is cloudy we discussed the fact that we
just<00:00:40.860> used<00:00:41.250> a<00:00:41.370> second<00:00:41.760> unit<00:00:41.910> basis<00:00:42.360> vector<00:00:42.690> for

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
just used a second unit basis vector for

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.620 
just used a second unit basis vector for
that<00:00:43.020> so<00:00:43.140> x0<00:00:43.500> now<00:00:43.950> is<00:00:44.130> the<00:00:44.280> vector<00:00:44.700> that<00:00:45.570> tells

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:45.630 
that so x0 now is the vector that tells

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:49.370 
that so x0 now is the vector that tells
us<00:00:46.050> what<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.410> weather<00:00:46.560> is<00:00:47.150> today<00:00:48.150> and<00:00:48.600> today

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:49.380 
us what the weather is today and today

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.450 
us what the weather is today and today
it<00:00:49.740> is<00:00:49.860> cloudy<00:00:51.050> now<00:00:52.050> if<00:00:52.530> we<00:00:52.740> want<00:00:52.980> to<00:00:53.040> predict

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
it is cloudy now if we want to predict

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.240 
it is cloudy now if we want to predict
the<00:00:53.550> weather<00:00:53.640> for<00:00:54.120> tomorrow<00:00:54.270> all<00:00:55.170> we<00:00:55.500> do<00:00:55.710> is<00:00:55.980> we

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
the weather for tomorrow all we do is we

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.120 
the weather for tomorrow all we do is we
multiply<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.820> transition<00:00:57.450> matrix<00:00:57.870> times<00:00:58.829> the

00:00:59.120 --> 00:00:59.130 
multiply the transition matrix times the

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.450 
multiply the transition matrix times the
vector<00:00:59.450> and<00:01:00.450> we<00:01:00.540> get<00:01:00.720> that<00:01:00.980> if<00:01:01.980> we<00:01:02.100> don't<00:01:02.250> want

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
vector and we get that if we don't want

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.310 
vector and we get that if we don't want
to<00:01:02.579> know<00:01:02.760> what<00:01:03.030> it<00:01:03.150> is<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.900> day<00:01:04.079> after

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
to know what it is the day after

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:04.999 
to know what it is the day after
tomorrow

00:01:04.999 --> 00:01:05.009 
tomorrow

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:07.429 
tomorrow
we<00:01:05.399> take<00:01:05.609> the<00:01:05.759> transition<00:01:06.240> matrix<00:01:06.659> and<00:01:06.960> we

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
we take the transition matrix and we

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.029 
we take the transition matrix and we
multiply<00:01:07.950> it<00:01:07.979> times<00:01:09.259> the<00:01:10.259> vector<00:01:10.469> that<00:01:10.770> sells

00:01:11.029 --> 00:01:11.039 
multiply it times the vector that sells

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:13.459 
multiply it times the vector that sells
is<00:01:11.219> what<00:01:11.429> the<00:01:11.549> weather<00:01:11.729> is<00:01:11.939> on<00:01:11.969> day<00:01:12.299> one<00:01:12.539> when

00:01:13.459 --> 00:01:13.469 
is what the weather is on day one when

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:17.510 
is what the weather is on day one when
we<00:01:13.499> get<00:01:13.799> that<00:01:14.329> x3<00:01:15.329> is<00:01:15.659> equal<00:01:15.689> to<00:01:16.139> P<00:01:16.439> times<00:01:16.829> x2

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
we get that x3 is equal to P times x2

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.779 
we get that x3 is equal to P times x2
and<00:01:17.999> we<00:01:18.929> can<00:01:19.079> print<00:01:19.289> that<00:01:19.469> out<00:01:22.490> and<00:01:23.490> we<00:01:23.639> get

00:01:23.779 --> 00:01:23.789 
and we can print that out and we get

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:27.800 
and we can print that out and we get
that<00:01:23.999> now<00:01:24.780> we<00:01:24.840> could<00:01:25.259> have<00:01:25.289> done<00:01:26.179> p3<00:01:27.179> is<00:01:27.389> equal

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
that now we could have done p3 is equal

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:35.690 
that now we could have done p3 is equal
to<00:01:27.960> P<00:01:28.380> times<00:01:28.829> P<00:01:29.009> times<00:01:29.670> p2<00:01:30.509> p1

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.640 

and<00:01:36.479> we<00:01:36.810> would<00:01:36.960> have<00:01:37.049> gotten<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.409> same<00:01:37.470> answer

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
and we would have gotten the same answer

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.609 
and we would have gotten the same answer
or<00:01:38.189> we<00:01:38.490> could<00:01:38.729> have<00:01:38.759> done<00:01:39.060> P<00:01:39.810> times<00:01:40.259> P<00:01:40.409> times<00:01:41.009> P

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619 
or we could have done P times P times P

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:46.370 
or we could have done P times P times P
times<00:01:43.619> X<00:01:44.040> zero<00:01:44.549> and<00:01:45.030> we<00:01:45.930> would<00:01:46.080> have<00:01:46.170> also

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
times X zero and we would have also

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.340 
times X zero and we would have also
gotten<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.920> same<00:01:47.100> answer<00:01:47.810> but<00:01:48.810> let's<00:01:49.049> make<00:01:49.290> it

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
gotten the same answer but let's make it

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.320 
gotten the same answer but let's make it
simple<00:01:50.009> and<00:01:50.729> we'll<00:01:51.090> do<00:01:51.210> P<00:01:51.450> times<00:01:51.750> x2<00:01:53.240> and<00:01:54.240> we

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.330 
simple and we'll do P times x2 and we

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.520 
simple and we'll do P times x2 and we
get<00:01:54.479> that<00:01:54.659> then<00:01:55.470> going<00:01:55.860> from<00:01:56.100> day<00:01:56.520> 3<00:01:56.990> to<00:01:57.990> day<00:01:58.170> 4

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
get that then going from day 3 to day 4

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:08.809 
get that then going from day 3 to day 4
we<00:01:58.560> get<00:01:58.920> X<00:01:59.250> 4<00:01:59.789> is<00:02:00.539> equal<00:02:00.689> to<00:02:02.570> P<00:02:03.570> times<00:02:04.430> X<00:02:05.430> 3<00:02:07.819> and

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
we get X 4 is equal to P times X 3 and

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:15.140 
we get X 4 is equal to P times X 3 and
we<00:02:08.880> want<00:02:09.209> to<00:02:09.330> print<00:02:09.600> that<00:02:09.780> and<00:02:13.459> then<00:02:14.459> you<00:02:15.060> know

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
we want to print that and then you know

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.970 
we want to print that and then you know
we<00:02:15.360> may<00:02:15.540> want<00:02:15.810> to<00:02:15.870> just<00:02:16.110> start<00:02:16.319> copying<00:02:16.769> and

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
we may want to just start copying and

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.100 
we may want to just start copying and
pasting<00:02:17.160> you<00:02:17.610> know<00:02:17.760> how<00:02:17.940> I<00:02:17.970> love<00:02:18.330> to<00:02:18.360> copy<00:02:18.780> and

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
pasting you know how I love to copy and

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:26.000 
pasting you know how I love to copy and
paste<00:02:20.840> and<00:02:21.840> we<00:02:22.110> get<00:02:22.290> that<00:02:23.060> and<00:02:24.470> we<00:02:25.470> do<00:02:25.769> it<00:02:25.920> again

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
paste and we get that and we do it again

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.130 
paste and we get that and we do it again
and<00:02:26.610> now<00:02:26.819> we<00:02:26.880> go<00:02:27.120> from<00:02:27.420> 5<00:02:27.930> to<00:02:28.230> 6

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
and now we go from 5 to 6

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:45.910 
and now we go from 5 to 6
oops<00:02:31.489> yep<00:02:35.269> and<00:02:36.920> finally<00:02:37.920> we<00:02:38.040> go<00:02:38.190> from<00:02:38.549> 6<00:02:38.940> to<00:02:39.269> 7

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.950 

and<00:02:46.920> now<00:02:47.550> we<00:02:47.610> have<00:02:47.850> the<00:02:47.970> vector<00:02:48.180> that<00:02:48.480> predicts

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:48.960 
and now we have the vector that predicts

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.740 
and now we have the vector that predicts
the<00:02:49.110> weather<00:02:49.370> next<00:02:50.370> week<00:02:50.550> given<00:02:51.240> that<00:02:51.420> today

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
the weather next week given that today

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.650 
the weather next week given that today
it<00:02:52.500> is<00:02:52.650> cloudy

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
it is cloudy

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.020 
it is cloudy
now<00:02:54.660> we<00:02:54.720> could<00:02:55.130> predict<00:02:56.130> the<00:02:56.280> next<00:02:56.520> 20<00:02:56.850> days

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
now we could predict the next 20 days

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.430 
now we could predict the next 20 days
and<00:02:57.330> for<00:02:57.510> that<00:02:57.600> we<00:02:57.780> would<00:02:57.930> ride<00:02:58.140> the<00:02:58.290> little

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
and for that we would ride the little

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.260 
and for that we would ride the little
loop<00:02:58.740> so<00:02:59.130> here's<00:02:59.400> the<00:02:59.520> little<00:02:59.730> loop<00:02:59.880> and<00:03:00.180> we

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
loop so here's the little loop and we

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.080 
loop so here's the little loop and we
can<00:03:00.420> execute<00:03:00.750> that<00:03:01.080> and<00:03:01.380> we<00:03:02.100> can<00:03:02.250> see<00:03:02.550> what

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
can execute that and we can see what

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.760 
can execute that and we can see what
happens<00:03:03.480> from<00:03:03.690> May<00:03:03.870> one<00:03:04.260> day<00:03:04.550> to<00:03:05.550> the<00:03:05.580> next<00:03:06.770> now

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
happens from May one day to the next now

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.470 
happens from May one day to the next now
the<00:03:07.800> important<00:03:08.370> thing<00:03:08.580> here<00:03:09.030> is<00:03:09.060> that<00:03:09.240> you

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
the important thing here is that you

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.510 
the important thing here is that you
start<00:03:09.870> noticing<00:03:10.050> that<00:03:10.590> this<00:03:10.770> vector<00:03:11.280> going

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520 
start noticing that this vector going

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.200 
start noticing that this vector going
from<00:03:11.670> day<00:03:12.150> 19<00:03:12.840> to<00:03:13.080> day<00:03:13.260> 20<00:03:13.940> doesn't<00:03:14.940> change

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:15.210 
from day 19 to day 20 doesn't change

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:17.960 
from day 19 to day 20 doesn't change
much<00:03:15.570> we<00:03:16.380> say<00:03:16.710> that<00:03:17.130> the<00:03:17.490> vector<00:03:17.850> has

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
much we say that the vector has

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.440 
much we say that the vector has
converged<00:03:18.600> or<00:03:18.990> is<00:03:19.440> converging<00:03:20.130> to<00:03:20.880> a<00:03:20.910> stable

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
converged or is converging to a stable

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.170 
converged or is converging to a stable
vector<00:03:22.080> which<00:03:22.590> then<00:03:22.830> predicts<00:03:23.400> the<00:03:24.150> weather

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
vector which then predicts the weather

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.620 
vector which then predicts the weather
on<00:03:25.080> a<00:03:25.410> typical<00:03:25.890> day

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
on a typical day

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.510 
on a typical day
now<00:03:27.630> we<00:03:27.690> could<00:03:28.050> obviously<00:03:28.620> change<00:03:29.010> this<00:03:29.250> loop

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:29.520 
now we could obviously change this loop

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:33.740 
now we could obviously change this loop
to<00:03:29.820> do<00:03:30.330> the<00:03:30.570> next<00:03:30.800> entire<00:03:31.800> year<00:03:32.510> let's<00:03:33.510> just

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
to do the next entire year let's just

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.800 
to do the next entire year let's just
assume<00:03:34.080> that<00:03:34.260> a<00:03:34.320> year<00:03:34.680> has<00:03:34.860> 365<00:03:35.490> days<00:03:36.390> in<00:03:36.660> it

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
assume that a year has 365 days in it

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.920 
assume that a year has 365 days in it
and<00:03:37.940> that<00:03:38.940> would<00:03:39.090> take<00:03:39.240> a<00:03:39.300> little<00:03:39.480> bit<00:03:39.600> longer

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
and that would take a little bit longer

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.960 
and that would take a little bit longer
and<00:03:40.230> if<00:03:40.320> we<00:03:40.470> go<00:03:40.620> all<00:03:40.770> the<00:03:40.800> way<00:03:40.950> to<00:03:41.100> the<00:03:41.340> end<00:03:41.490> we

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
and if we go all the way to the end we

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.090 
and if we go all the way to the end we
would<00:03:42.120> definitely<00:03:42.300> notice<00:03:42.780> that<00:03:43.170> this<00:03:43.650> vector

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
would definitely notice that this vector

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:48.949 
would definitely notice that this vector
is<00:03:44.250> not<00:03:44.400> changing<00:03:44.940> anymore<00:03:47.210> so<00:03:48.210> you<00:03:48.660> can<00:03:48.810> go

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
is not changing anymore so you can go

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:50.630 
is not changing anymore so you can go
back<00:03:49.140> and<00:03:49.440> you<00:03:49.770> can<00:03:49.890> do<00:03:50.040> exactly<00:03:50.160> the<00:03:50.610> same

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
back and you can do exactly the same

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.960 
back and you can do exactly the same
calculation<00:03:51.060> where<00:03:51.930> all<00:03:52.140> you<00:03:52.410> do<00:03:52.620> is<00:03:52.970> you

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
calculation where all you do is you

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.210 
calculation where all you do is you
change<00:03:54.300> the<00:03:54.480> vector<00:03:55.110> that<00:03:55.350> says<00:03:55.680> that<00:03:55.920> today

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
change the vector that says that today

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.300 
change the vector that says that today
is<00:03:56.400> cloudy<00:03:56.730> -<00:03:57.209> a<00:03:57.239> vector<00:03:57.690> that<00:03:57.720> says<00:03:58.230> today<00:03:58.650> is

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
is cloudy - a vector that says today is

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.960 
is cloudy - a vector that says today is
sunny<00:04:00.140> and<00:04:01.140> we<00:04:01.260> can<00:04:01.410> just<00:04:01.620> go<00:04:01.800> and<00:04:02.070> execute<00:04:02.520> all

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
sunny and we can just go and execute all

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.440 
sunny and we can just go and execute all
the<00:04:03.180> same<00:04:03.420> things<00:04:03.980> over<00:04:04.980> again<00:04:05.330> what<00:04:06.330> you

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
the same things over again what you

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.300 
the same things over again what you
notice<00:04:06.840> is<00:04:06.959> that<00:04:06.989> again<00:04:07.440> things<00:04:07.920> start<00:04:08.190> to

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
notice is that again things start to

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.440 
notice is that again things start to
stabilize<00:04:08.520> and<00:04:09.239> at<00:04:10.140> the<00:04:10.260> end<00:04:10.440> of<00:04:10.650> a<00:04:10.709> year<00:04:11.450> we

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
stabilize and at the end of a year we

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.420 
stabilize and at the end of a year we
get<00:04:12.660> roughly<00:04:12.930> the<00:04:13.170> same<00:04:13.470> vector<00:04:13.950> as<00:04:14.100> we<00:04:14.280> got

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
get roughly the same vector as we got

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.979 
get roughly the same vector as we got
before

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:14.989 
before

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:17.360 
before
and<00:04:15.989> you<00:04:16.080> can<00:04:16.230> go<00:04:16.350> back<00:04:16.590> and<00:04:16.859> do<00:04:17.070> the<00:04:17.160> same

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
and you can go back and do the same

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.159 
and you can go back and do the same
thing<00:04:17.669> and<00:04:17.880> put<00:04:18.060> in<00:04:18.180> the<00:04:18.299> third<00:04:18.480> unit<00:04:18.690> basis

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.169 
thing and put in the third unit basis

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:20.659 
thing and put in the third unit basis
vector<00:04:19.560> and<00:04:19.709> see<00:04:19.919> what<00:04:20.070> happens<00:04:20.400> if<00:04:20.520> you<00:04:20.609> start

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
vector and see what happens if you start

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:26.240 
vector and see what happens if you start
with<00:04:21.540> a<00:04:21.600> day<00:04:21.840> that's<00:04:22.049> rainy<00:04:24.650> so<00:04:25.650> what<00:04:25.830> we<00:04:25.980> saw

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
with a day that's rainy so what we saw

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.550 
with a day that's rainy so what we saw
when<00:04:26.669> we<00:04:26.730> did<00:04:26.850> our<00:04:27.210> ipython<00:04:27.570> notebook<00:04:28.260> was

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
when we did our ipython notebook was

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.930 
when we did our ipython notebook was
that<00:04:28.860> given<00:04:29.700> a<00:04:29.820> vector<00:04:30.090> of<00:04:31.400> that<00:04:32.400> that

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 
that given a vector of that that

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.320 
that given a vector of that that
indicates<00:04:33.450> that<00:04:33.570> today<00:04:34.020> it<00:04:34.320> is<00:04:34.560> cloudy<00:04:35.180> we<00:04:36.180> can

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
indicates that today it is cloudy we can

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:37.730 
indicates that today it is cloudy we can
come<00:04:36.540> up<00:04:36.690> with<00:04:36.720> the<00:04:36.990> vector<00:04:37.200> of<00:04:37.470> what<00:04:37.620> the

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 
come up with the vector of what the

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.770 
come up with the vector of what the
probabilities<00:04:38.340> are<00:04:38.370> for<00:04:38.580> tomorrow<00:04:39.240> and<00:04:39.570> the

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
probabilities are for tomorrow and the

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.830 
probabilities are for tomorrow and the
day<00:04:39.930> after<00:04:39.960> and<00:04:40.500> the<00:04:40.590> day<00:04:40.890> after<00:04:41.040> and<00:04:41.810> the<00:04:42.810> day

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
day after and the day after and the day

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.010 
day after and the day after and the day
after<00:04:42.990> and<00:04:43.590> the<00:04:44.010> day<00:04:44.040> after<00:04:44.160> and<00:04:44.760> so<00:04:45.360> forth<00:04:45.630> and

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 
after and the day after and so forth and

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.210 
after and the day after and so forth and
finally<00:04:46.950> a<00:04:47.160> week<00:04:47.669> from<00:04:47.910> now<00:04:48.830> one<00:04:49.830> thing<00:04:50.070> you

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
finally a week from now one thing you

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:51.920 
finally a week from now one thing you
notice<00:04:50.460> is<00:04:50.850> that<00:04:50.940> these<00:04:51.330> numbers<00:04:51.540> are

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
notice is that these numbers are

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:53.630 
notice is that these numbers are
starting<00:04:52.320> to<00:04:52.440> stabilize<00:04:52.710> there's<00:04:53.310> not<00:04:53.430> much

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:53.640 
starting to stabilize there's not much

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:56.240

change<00:04:54.030> anymore<00:04:54.539> what<00:04:55.500> that<00:04:55.680> means<00:04:55.890> is<00:04:56.220> that

change anymore what that means is that

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 
a stable vector now what does that mean

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.930 
a stable vector now what does that mean
this<00:05:01.169> vector<00:05:01.440> here<00:05:02.009> simply<00:05:02.430> becomes<00:05:02.759> the
