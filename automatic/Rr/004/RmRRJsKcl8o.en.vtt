00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:06.799 
zag you really can't go wrong this one I

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:08.380 
zag you really can't go wrong this one I
thought<00:02:07.040> was<00:02:07.220> a<00:02:07.280> little<00:02:07.520> bit<00:02:07.640> easier<00:02:07.790> to<00:02:08.030> apply

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
thought was a little bit easier to apply

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.500 
thought was a little bit easier to apply
them<00:02:08.720> the<00:02:08.869> zagg<00:02:09.110> now<00:02:09.500> I<00:02:09.530> may<00:02:09.770> be<00:02:09.830> wrong<00:02:10.130> but

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:10.510 
them the zagg now I may be wrong but

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:13.180 
them the zagg now I may be wrong but
from<00:02:11.510> what<00:02:11.690> I've<00:02:11.840> read<00:02:12.110> in<00:02:12.170> things<00:02:12.530> I<00:02:12.650> think<00:02:13.069> it

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
from what I've read in things I think it

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.610 
from what I've read in things I think it
is<00:02:13.310> so<00:02:13.640> now<00:02:14.450> you<00:02:14.510> can<00:02:14.780> see<00:02:14.989> it<00:02:15.140> only<00:02:15.260> took<00:02:15.440> me<00:02:15.500> a

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
is so now you can see it only took me a

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.590 
is so now you can see it only took me a
couple<00:02:15.650> minutes<00:02:15.980> to<00:02:16.280> pull<00:02:16.430> that<00:02:16.580> off<00:02:16.640> here's

couple minutes to pull that off here's

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.260 
couple minutes to pull that off here's
the<00:02:17.690> best<00:02:18.290> games<00:02:18.560> ever<00:02:18.709> you<00:02:19.640> know<00:02:19.730> destroyed

but the phone well there is a little bit

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:26.800

of<00:02:25.610> residue<00:02:25.730> right<00:02:26.150> here<00:02:26.390> so<00:02:26.569> I'm<00:02:26.630> going<00:02:26.780> to
