00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
an idea on the other side to show you

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:25.220 
an idea on the other side to show you
how<00:02:14.519> these<00:02:14.670> go<00:02:14.730> really<00:02:15.690> easy<00:02:16.100> straight<00:02:24.230> to

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
how these go really easy straight to

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.880 
how these go really easy straight to
very<00:02:25.530> very<00:02:25.799> light<00:02:26.099> easy<00:02:26.489> to<00:02:27.030> pick<00:02:27.239> up<00:02:27.890> doing

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
very very light easy to pick up doing

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.680 
very very light easy to pick up doing
this<00:02:29.780> yeah<00:02:30.780> a<00:02:30.810> little<00:02:31.170> bit<00:02:31.260> quieter<00:02:31.560> in<00:02:31.680> here

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
this yeah a little bit quieter in here
