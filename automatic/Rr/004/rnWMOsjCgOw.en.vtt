it and it has a plug-in capability

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.460 
it and it has a plug-in capability
so<00:01:12.360> under<00:01:13.360> the<00:01:13.510> hood<00:01:13.720> this<00:01:13.930> is<00:01:14.110> where<00:01:14.290> you'll

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.470 
so under the hood this is where you'll

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.560 
so under the hood this is where you'll
really<00:01:14.710> notice<00:01:15.010> the<00:01:15.820> difference<00:01:15.850> from<00:01:16.390> what

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:16.570 
really notice the difference from what

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.540 
really notice the difference from what
you'd<00:01:16.720> see<00:01:16.900> on<00:01:16.930> a<00:01:17.020> traditional<00:01:17.680> engine<00:01:18.370> on<00:01:18.520> a

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:18.550 
you'd see on a traditional engine on a

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.090 
you'd see on a traditional engine on a
car<00:01:18.880> you<00:01:19.810> see<00:01:19.960> a<00:01:19.990> lot<00:01:20.140> of<00:01:20.170> orange<00:01:20.560> coating<00:01:20.950> and

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
car you see a lot of orange coating and

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.310 
car you see a lot of orange coating and
wiring<00:01:21.280> it's<00:01:21.670> a<00:01:21.760> high<00:01:21.940> voltage<00:01:22.150> system<00:01:22.870> but

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 
wiring it's a high voltage system but

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.580 
wiring it's a high voltage system but
it's<00:01:23.470> also<00:01:23.620> designed<00:01:23.950> to<00:01:24.310> be<00:01:24.400> completely<00:01:24.970> safe

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
it's also designed to be completely safe

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.250 
it's also designed to be completely safe
as<00:01:26.590> well<00:01:26.950> as<00:01:27.220> you're<00:01:27.400> driving<00:01:28.080> it's<00:01:29.080> an

as well as you're driving it's an

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.400 
as well as you're driving it's an
electric<00:01:29.680> motor<00:01:29.860> so<00:01:30.400> the<00:01:30.520> motors<00:01:31.410> generating

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:32.410 
electric motor so the motors generating

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:33.990 
electric motor so the motors generating
all<00:01:32.560> of<00:01:32.680> the<00:01:32.830> torque<00:01:33.130> and<00:01:33.369> using<00:01:33.790> the<00:01:33.880> energy

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000 
all of the torque and using the energy

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.210 
all of the torque and using the energy
from<00:01:34.390> the<00:01:34.450> battery<00:01:34.570> there's<00:01:35.470> a<00:01:35.530> lot<00:01:35.770> of<00:01:35.800> power

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
from the battery there's a lot of power

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.609 
from the battery there's a lot of power
controllers<00:01:36.970> and<00:01:37.210> software<00:01:37.750> that<00:01:38.020> sits<00:01:38.410> in

controllers and software that sits in

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:41.700 
controllers and software that sits in
these<00:01:38.800> controllers<00:01:39.390> but<00:01:40.390> overall<00:01:40.840> one<00:01:41.500> of<00:01:41.619> the

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
these controllers but overall one of the

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.350 
these controllers but overall one of the
nice<00:01:41.860> things<00:01:41.920> in<00:01:42.310> about<00:01:42.580> an<00:01:42.729> electric<00:01:43.150> motor

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
nice things in about an electric motor

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.270 
nice things in about an electric motor
and<00:01:43.660> electric<00:01:44.050> powertrain<00:01:44.470> is<00:01:44.619> it's<00:01:44.979> much

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
and electric powertrain is it's much

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.400 
and electric powertrain is it's much
simpler<00:01:45.729> than<00:01:45.850> a<00:01:46.060> gas<00:01:46.240> engine<00:01:46.540> so<00:01:47.080> that<00:01:47.140> means

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:47.410 
simpler than a gas engine so that means

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.460 
simpler than a gas engine so that means
less<00:01:47.800> maintenance<00:01:48.160> no<00:01:48.610> oil<00:01:48.850> changes<00:01:49.540> and<00:01:50.259> it's

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470 
less maintenance no oil changes and it's

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.359 
less maintenance no oil changes and it's
just<00:01:50.680> a<00:01:50.770> really<00:01:50.800> simple<00:01:51.570> overall<00:01:52.570> technology

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
just a really simple overall technology

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.670 
just a really simple overall technology
great<00:01:54.369> can<00:01:55.149> we<00:01:55.210> go<00:01:55.360> for<00:01:55.540> a<00:01:55.600> we<00:01:56.050> should<00:01:56.259> go<00:01:56.410> for<00:01:56.619> a

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:56.680 
great can we go for a we should go for a

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.130 
great can we go for a we should go for a
spin<00:01:56.890> this<00:01:57.130> is<00:01:57.340> the<00:01:57.550> fun<00:01:57.759> part<00:01:57.789> I<00:01:58.360> think<00:01:58.990> it's

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
spin this is the fun part I think it's

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.620 
spin this is the fun part I think it's
really<00:01:59.380> smooth<00:01:59.830> it<00:02:00.490> feels<00:02:00.850> and<00:02:01.119> like<00:02:01.330> you<00:02:01.479> said

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
really smooth it feels and like you said

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.150 
really smooth it feels and like you said
it<00:02:01.810> feels<00:02:02.110> very<00:02:02.200> balanced<00:02:03.190> um<00:02:03.460> it<00:02:03.970> just<00:02:04.180> feels

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:05.160 
it feels very balanced um it just feels

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.310 
it feels very balanced um it just feels
in<00:02:06.160> a<00:02:06.340> weird<00:02:06.550> way<00:02:06.670> very<00:02:07.030> sensible<00:02:07.690> you<00:02:08.140> feel

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:08.320 
in a weird way very sensible you feel

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:09.840 
in a weird way very sensible you feel
the<00:02:08.440> brakes<00:02:08.709> are<00:02:08.950> little<00:02:09.280> different<00:02:09.729> because

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 
the brakes are little different because

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.570 
the brakes are little different because
yeah<00:02:10.149> they're<00:02:10.660> pretty<00:02:10.750> generating<00:02:11.580> so

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
yeah they're pretty generating so

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.250 
yeah they're pretty generating so
they're<00:02:12.790> bringing<00:02:13.180> energy<00:02:13.360> kind<00:02:13.959> of<00:02:14.050> back

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
they're bringing energy kind of back

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.460 
they're bringing energy kind of back
into<00:02:14.560> the<00:02:14.830> battery<00:02:15.690> when<00:02:16.690> you're<00:02:16.930> when<00:02:17.350> you're

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
into the battery when you're when you're

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.340 
into the battery when you're when you're
breaking<00:02:17.890> it's<00:02:18.010> an<00:02:18.190> efficiency<00:02:19.350> technology

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
breaking it's an efficiency technology

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.320 
breaking it's an efficiency technology
that<00:02:20.620> you<00:02:20.950> know<00:02:21.040> helps<00:02:21.370> you<00:02:21.549> get<00:02:21.760> longer

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
that you know helps you get longer

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.800 
that you know helps you get longer
driving<00:02:22.720> for<00:02:23.019> me<00:02:23.110> yeah<00:02:23.890> um<00:02:24.250> who<00:02:25.000> do<00:02:25.060> you<00:02:25.239> see<00:02:25.510> as

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
driving for me yeah um who do you see as

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.650 
driving for me yeah um who do you see as
the<00:02:25.900> primary<00:02:26.470> buyer<00:02:26.920> for<00:02:27.310> this<00:02:27.430> car<00:02:27.730> we<00:02:28.450> think

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
the primary buyer for this car we think

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.360 
the primary buyer for this car we think
it's<00:02:28.780> going<00:02:28.870> to<00:02:28.930> be<00:02:29.019> similar<00:02:29.350> to<00:02:29.530> our<00:02:29.890> current

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
it's going to be similar to our current

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.390 
it's going to be similar to our current
buyers<00:02:30.660> and<00:02:31.660> you<00:02:32.410> know<00:02:32.560> they're<00:02:32.769> they<00:02:33.100> want<00:02:33.310> a

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
buyers and you know they're they want a

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.670 
buyers and you know they're they want a
progressive<00:02:33.910> choice<00:02:34.180> in<00:02:34.570> cars<00:02:35.019> that<00:02:35.320> we<00:02:35.440> know

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
progressive choice in cars that we know

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.949 
progressive choice in cars that we know
they're<00:02:35.920> really<00:02:36.190> interested<00:02:36.489> in<00:02:37.030> the<00:02:37.720> latest

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
they're really interested in the latest

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:40.229 
they're really interested in the latest
environmental<00:02:39.030> technologies<00:02:40.030> and

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
environmental technologies and

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:41.880 
environmental technologies and
alternative<00:02:40.720> power<00:02:40.900> trains<00:02:41.290> you<00:02:41.620> know<00:02:41.650> it's

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
alternative power trains you know it's

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.800 
alternative power trains you know it's
important<00:02:42.310> when<00:02:42.400> we're<00:02:42.579> testing<00:02:43.090> these<00:02:43.510> that

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
important when we're testing these that

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.710 
important when we're testing these that
they<00:02:43.840> they<00:02:44.799> also<00:02:44.980> perform<00:02:45.610> you<00:02:46.120> know<00:02:46.239> well<00:02:46.510> and

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
they they also perform you know well and

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.660 
they they also perform you know well and
we<00:02:46.810> have<00:02:46.959> these<00:02:47.250> features<00:02:48.250> so<00:02:48.370> we<00:02:48.519> do<00:02:48.640> think

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
we have these features so we do think

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.580 
we have these features so we do think
drivers<00:02:49.329> will<00:02:49.600> you<00:02:49.900> know<00:02:49.989> even<00:02:50.170> with<00:02:50.440> your

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
drivers will you know even with your

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.650 
drivers will you know even with your
driving<00:02:51.310> electric<00:02:51.880> you<00:02:52.150> still<00:02:52.390> want<00:02:52.540> to<00:02:52.570> be

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
driving electric you still want to be

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.660 
driving electric you still want to be
involved<00:02:52.930> with<00:02:53.200> your<00:02:53.290> car<00:02:53.560> you<00:02:54.160> don't<00:02:54.340> want<00:02:54.549> to

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
involved with your car you don't want to

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:00.190 
involved with your car you don't want to
feel<00:02:55.060> like<00:02:55.120> you're<00:02:55.450> driving<00:02:55.870> client
