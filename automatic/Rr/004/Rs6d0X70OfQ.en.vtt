00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:33.860
 la la la la la la la la la la la 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:36.080
 la la la la la la la la la riada me 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.330
 I just fucked aaaa I did not remember 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:40.250
 that I had already started the video I'm sorry 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:42.710
 okay hello everyone in this video 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.870
 I will teach how to put real sky effects 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.699
 and make your gta san andreas more 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.860
 quick good first I will teach you to 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:51.110
 do faster without any downloads 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.420
 well go to the pause menu of your gta 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:56.809
 san andreas ok once here we go 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:59.300
 to options later in configuration 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:01.760
 advanced screen you will put it 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.920
 so widescreen does not limit 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:07.420
 frames per second there and in the effects 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.420
 visuals put it on low 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:15.340
 Once this holds San Andreas it will be 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.340
 faster and will have better effects 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.050
 well now I will teach you to put the sky 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.270
 real they go to the link that is in the 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:25.400
 description of the video once there they give 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.590
 down where it says real sky and effects 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.720
 for the 10th or I give the 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:33.520
 little green square where it says don 1 to 10 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.520
 so the file will be downloaded 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:38.140
 well once downloaded they will have a 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:41.560
 rar file 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.750
 we give you right click extract here and we 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.500
 will leave a folder called real sky and 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.650
 effects 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.750
 we open that folder there we will see two 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:52.060
 folders and a file of notes for 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.700
 subnormal that do not know how to install it haha 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.280
 xd we open the data folder and we'll see two 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.200
 files those files you have to copy them 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.800
 in the data folder of our gta san 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.840
 andreas 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.820
 we give right click to an access 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.920
 direct from gta iv we are going to open the 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.289
 location of the file we look for the 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.739
 folder and we paste those files in that 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:10.739
 binder 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.240
 and we do the same with the models folder 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.220
 we open it and copy the files that 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:42.080
 contain and paste them into the folder 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.080
 models of our gta san andreas 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.239
 I do not do it anymore because I already have it 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.239
 installed 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:55.120
 well and that's it we already have our 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:57.370
 gta san andreas with real sky and effects 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.569
 now we will test our effects of 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.569
 weapons to see how they sound 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:13.390
 the graphics are great look 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:16.630
 how the fire looks the rifle 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:19.860
 sniper sounds better than I admit 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.860
 has good weapons sound 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.840
 and you can hear the expressions better 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:41.040
 well the spray sounds and it looks the same as 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:41.040
 before that did not change anything 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:58.710
 you sound much better 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.710
 let's dry how the police car sounds 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:12.510

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:30.590
