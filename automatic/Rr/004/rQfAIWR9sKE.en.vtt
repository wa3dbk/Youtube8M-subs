00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:15.210
 hello everybody this is the very one 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.830
 long live and we find ourselves today for 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:21.750
 a new presentation of a software 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:23.039
 so I software cpr tscr my case it's 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.170
 software that allows you to make 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.380
 screenshots but really very very 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.970
 advanced so the options here so already 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.080
 burst the vaults you download 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.850
 need that and I 'm fine in the 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.160
 description 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:36.989
 so she showed simple I think bout 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.430
 to restart the computer as follows the 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.510
 patient I was really very long 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.399
 that the teacher did not like them at all 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.530
 you open it and it gives you more 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.120
 like that does not work by wearing so 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.770
 the high 15c touch to press for 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.789
 take a screenshot but that's good 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.610
 just touched nothing better it's 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.949
 djeddah which she touched an award winning 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.079
 screen the one that normally next to the 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.149
 start finally for computer after that's 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.579
 papon it's not all the same then 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.289
 after the capture showed a window that 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:05.659
 allows to record so be 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:08.070
 saved either edit it and be 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:09.960
 copied to the clipboard not like 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.630
 touching but the screen in 26 hotels and 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.090
 rÃ©my cochen so here I advise you to 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.250
 put these facts and the cards one 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.450
 window for the backup and then that 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.409
 you do not touch it's a moment 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.509
 of emotion so important 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.549
 you can choose the format I like 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.630
 jpeg and I have not put everything 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.790
 I never have to green it leaves you the 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.590
 probable where I him the default one is 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.140
 really very much hesitates even to a little 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.030
 hesitated in png so that's the size 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.579
 100% really let you like that serves 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.530
 really nothing and so we see there I 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.150
 leave you five minutes each what 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.509
 that he wanted that's how my 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.220
 pierrot was me but at the foot but 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.470
 that she poses and and watch you but 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.030
 otherwise I would be very good by default at 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.750
 least to make the screenshot you 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.420
 Press the key 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:54.810
 prints screen that hits a shot at 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.430
 right from to all beginnings pretty much towards 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.070
 the bottom of the candle on the far right 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.200
 really she nero or look for black in 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:05.130
 about the same as one and that the 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:07.140
 f 9 and 10 seconds 12 trains so you 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.270
 call the month sut by convoy then on 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.340
 fn is printed when the same time is 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.670
 like that it is the town hall to support you 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.520
 Alas 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:18.780
 but I love doing it because we 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:22.060
 go the thing up we talk a lot 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:24.220
 so to you then have the window with 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.709
 a little sound of cameras we're going 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.930
 say who is who appears and to you have 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:30.370
 a new cursor between is there the 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.750
 screenshot by his sire his 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.930
 taken and there you can do several 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.420
 things you did but because 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.190
 that I prefer it right the same 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.959
 explained but we breathe you can 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.849
 first of all that by now at the click you 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:44.890
 can choose me I do not know how to play 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:46.239
 because founded the bottom and blue you 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.810
 can choose the size of your 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:52.600
 window our screenshot does if I 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:55.360
 do a lot of dizac like that hop on 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:57.220
 and that the screen 4g is a bit weird 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.900
 like that so then you can 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.670
 the save world address all the 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:06.430
 options we can do so you 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:09.910
 can also because it's yes we can 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:11.470
 to make Kurds and brands on 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:14.160
 the screen and then save it not 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:16.720
 this part there and arrange even the 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.130
 tides the first time I use you 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.799
 can then press the key 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.970
 control make an exact square that's fine 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:23.019
 it's really handy if 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.180
 you want to take screenshots 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:26.829
 of software up prove that it takes at 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.820
 red square does not take on the bottom 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:30.730
 blue because we're not doing very well 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:32.790
 I think for example in the first line 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.790
 right here 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:37.090
 but wade could she record a 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:41.440
 times so then you choose the ti 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:42.730
 so by default title is the mode the 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.829
 fire was not open must not remain 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.600
 google chrome 4 go then that you 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:49.870
 do not touch in all directions so his 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:51.820
 segmented the the register it on the 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.609
 office so that's enough for 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:57.220
 save a few steps the pan of 

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:59.350
 rock if your file is badly taken by 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.420
 email edit for hits and so the 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:03.459
 modify premium to print all 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.319
 banks to copy it on the 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:08.319
 paperweight angie this contract was 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:10.600
 happened to remove him so 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:11.950
 oh yes so to have with the screen 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.760
 whole it's very simple you're doing there 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.980
 some songs of the grains you press 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:18.039
 once and will let go on if you have 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:20.769
 the settings tab rule quite 

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:22.539
 solitary cinoche more than I use 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:25.730
 most often it's all scop have 

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:27.470
 saved not on the whey as the screen 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:29.240
 it's even about screen and it's 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:32.960
 really a quality of phew 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:35.210
 so there by cons I do not know if 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.890
 you will see and I would say 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:39.140
 really the riner screen is beating that does not 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:42.110
 not at all me who exchange what 

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:45.260
 so here it was a software that she 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:45.830
 mastery to pinch prt 1 cm and nothing in 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.110
 the description 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:50.870
 so here it is free plus it is 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:52.400
 very well do not know if you like it 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.260
 salty but in any case me I you 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.480
 advise so here it was that they 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:58.670
 would be 10 may for a tutorial on rps 

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:00.020
 and for the screenshot and so we 

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:02.320
 later finds a new video 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.320
 Hi
