actually<00:00:13.170> or<00:00:13.530> maybe<00:00:13.559> he<00:00:13.889> might<00:00:14.009> be<00:00:14.160> trying<00:00:14.250> to

establish position across this nine
o'clock<00:00:15.990> base<00:00:16.199> and<00:00:16.619> just<00:00:16.800> trying<00:00:16.980> to<00:00:17.039> divide

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
o'clock base and just trying to divide

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.279 
o'clock base and just trying to divide
this<00:00:17.880> in<00:00:18.029> half<00:00:18.150> if<00:00:18.359> he<00:00:18.480> can<00:00:18.630> deny<00:00:18.810> that<00:00:18.960> bottom

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
this in half if he can deny that bottom

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:20.900 
this in half if he can deny that bottom
left-hand<00:00:19.529> base<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:20.279> same<00:00:20.460> time<00:00:20.640> and<00:00:20.820> some

left-hand base the same time and some
stds<00:00:21.210> no<00:00:21.330> looks<00:00:21.510> like<00:00:21.570> he's<00:00:21.779> going<00:00:21.869> to<00:00:21.960> try<00:00:22.050> to

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
stds no looks like he's going to try to

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.599 
stds no looks like he's going to try to
open<00:00:22.230> up<00:00:22.410> that<00:00:22.500> upper<00:00:22.560> right<00:00:22.949> one<00:00:23.430> of<00:00:23.550> the

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
open up that upper right one of the

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:24.890 
open up that upper right one of the
dropships<00:00:23.939> getting<00:00:24.180> taken<00:00:24.420> out<00:00:24.480> looks<00:00:24.720> like<00:00:24.869> a

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
dropships getting taken out looks like a

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.630 
dropships getting taken out looks like a
couple<00:00:25.350> I'm<00:00:25.410> getting<00:00:25.619> picked<00:00:25.800> off<00:00:25.920> not<00:00:26.369> is<00:00:26.490> not

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
couple I'm getting picked off not is not

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:27.620 
couple I'm getting picked off not is not
going<00:00:26.730> to<00:00:26.789> be<00:00:26.880> able<00:00:26.910> to<00:00:27.090> hold<00:00:27.210> this<00:00:27.330> but<00:00:27.510> at<00:00:27.570> the

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
going to be able to hold this but at the

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.339 
going to be able to hold this but at the
very<00:00:27.660> least<00:00:27.869> that<00:00:28.650> attack<00:00:29.340> force<00:00:29.609> blade

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:30.349 
very least that attack force blade

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:32.600 
very least that attack force blade
kannada<00:00:31.349> and<00:00:31.529> looks<00:00:31.740> like<00:00:31.859> another<00:00:32.219> attack

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
kannada and looks like another attack

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.130 
kannada and looks like another attack
force<00:00:32.880> pushing<00:00:33.270> up<00:00:33.390> that<00:00:33.570> is<00:00:33.780> going<00:00:33.899> to<00:00:34.079> be

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
force pushing up that is going to be

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.260 
force pushing up that is going to be
spotted<00:00:34.469> but<00:00:35.219> we'll<00:00:35.399> see<00:00:35.610> if<00:00:35.760> how<00:00:36.000> long

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
spotted but we'll see if how long

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.790 
spotted but we'll see if how long
kannada<00:00:36.630> can<00:00:36.840> hold<00:00:37.020> that<00:00:37.079> upper<00:00:37.530> left<00:00:37.710> hand

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
kannada can hold that upper left hand

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.799 
kannada can hold that upper left hand
position<00:00:38.250> so<00:00:38.760> it<00:00:39.030> looks<00:00:39.059> like<00:00:39.270> he's<00:00:39.480> moving

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
position so it looks like he's moving

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.600 
position so it looks like he's moving
his<00:00:39.870> troops<00:00:40.140> out<00:00:40.350> actually<00:00:40.860> and<00:00:41.040> nada

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
his troops out actually and nada

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.190 
his troops out actually and nada
actually<00:00:42.180> he's<00:00:42.329> managed<00:00:42.719> to<00:00:42.780> thread<00:00:43.020> through

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
actually he's managed to thread through

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.510 
actually he's managed to thread through
right<00:00:43.410> now<00:00:43.440> he's<00:00:43.710> in<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.890> dark<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.280> we'll<00:00:44.399> see

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
right now he's in the dark and we'll see

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.100 
right now he's in the dark and we'll see
if<00:00:44.579> he<00:00:44.640> makes<00:00:44.789> a<00:00:44.910> jet<00:00:45.149> for<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.600> twelve<00:00:45.899> o'clock

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
if he makes a jet for the twelve o'clock

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.420 
if he makes a jet for the twelve o'clock
position<00:00:46.469> instead<00:00:46.649> of<00:00:46.770> going<00:00:46.950> for<00:00:47.070> that<00:00:47.160> upper

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
position instead of going for that upper

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.150 
position instead of going for that upper
base<00:00:47.610> so<00:00:48.090> really<00:00:48.360> using<00:00:48.780> kind<00:00:48.960> of<00:00:49.160> clever

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
base so really using kind of clever

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.400 
base so really using kind of clever
tactics<00:00:50.700> here<00:00:50.850> I<00:00:50.879> would<00:00:51.030> say<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.360> yeah<00:00:51.840> those

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
tactics here I would say and yeah those

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.110 
tactics here I would say and yeah those
drop<00:00:52.710> ships<00:00:52.739> are<00:00:53.190> not<00:00:53.370> loaded<00:00:53.730> up<00:00:53.820> looks<00:00:54.000> like

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
drop ships are not loaded up looks like

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.340 
drop ships are not loaded up looks like
maybe<00:00:54.329> they<00:00:54.510> have<00:00:54.660> some<00:00:54.809> counter<00:00:55.050> troops<00:00:55.260> I

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
maybe they have some counter troops I

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.299 
maybe they have some counter troops I
don't<00:00:55.500> know<00:00:55.559> how<00:00:55.710> much<00:00:55.890> they<00:00:56.039> have<00:00:56.160> but

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
don't know how much they have but

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.979 
don't know how much they have but
dropping<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:57.120> again<00:00:57.300> with<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.510> weapons<00:00:57.809> one

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
dropping and again with the weapons one

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.170 
dropping and again with the weapons one
advantage<00:00:58.410> huge<00:00:58.859> SUVs<00:00:59.520> coming<00:00:59.789> off<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.030> line

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
advantage huge SUVs coming off the line

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.150 
advantage huge SUVs coming off the line
I<00:01:00.449> would<00:01:01.109> say<00:01:01.199> not<00:01:01.230> taking<00:01:01.710> a<00:01:01.800> sizable

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
I would say not taking a sizable

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.439 
I would say not taking a sizable
advantage<00:01:02.550> you're<00:01:02.670> killing<00:01:02.910> a<00:01:03.000> lot<00:01:03.120> of<00:01:03.239> se

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
advantage you're killing a lot of se

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:04.579 
advantage you're killing a lot of se
he's<00:01:03.600> probably<00:01:03.930> gonna<00:01:04.080> be<00:01:04.199> able<00:01:04.260> to<00:01:04.409> take<00:01:04.470> this

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
he's probably gonna be able to take this

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.320 
he's probably gonna be able to take this
command<00:01:04.860> center<00:01:05.040> out<00:01:05.189> between<00:01:05.700> that<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:06.210> the

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
command center out between that and the

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.030 
command center out between that and the
tron<00:01:06.570> boosters<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:07.110> see<00:01:07.229> if<00:01:07.320> he<00:01:07.380> just<00:01:07.560> focuses

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
tron boosters and see if he just focuses

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.800 
tron boosters and see if he just focuses
that<00:01:08.220> command<00:01:08.490> center<00:01:08.729> down<00:01:08.880> its<00:01:09.360> lifting<00:01:09.689> out

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
that command center down its lifting out

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.109 
that command center down its lifting out
more<00:01:10.350> dropships<00:01:10.950> I<00:01:11.070> think<00:01:11.520> they're<00:01:11.700> empty<00:01:12.030> at

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
more dropships I think they're empty at

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.730 
more dropships I think they're empty at
this<00:01:12.270> stage<00:01:12.510> because<00:01:12.930> he<00:01:13.110> did<00:01:13.320> not<00:01:13.350> cannot

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
this stage because he did not cannot

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.499 
this stage because he did not cannot
again<00:01:14.010> did<00:01:14.189> not<00:01:14.340> load<00:01:14.580> them<00:01:14.760> back<00:01:14.880> up<00:01:15.090> some

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
again did not load them back up some

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.030 
again did not load them back up some
more<00:01:15.659> cheese<00:01:15.810> jinx<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.259> lower<00:01:16.439> edge<00:01:16.619> he's

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
more cheese jinx to the lower edge he's

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.320 
more cheese jinx to the lower edge he's
going<00:01:17.189> to<00:01:17.250> be<00:01:17.340> able<00:01:17.400> to<00:01:17.549> retreat<00:01:17.909> that<00:01:18.030> command

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
something he is down a base I think he

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:32.960 
something he is down a base I think he
might<00:01:31.560> be<00:01:31.590> down<00:01:31.740> two<00:01:32.040> bases<00:01:32.400> actually<00:01:32.729> trying

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
might be down two bases actually trying

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140

kannada hasn't grabbed that gas in the

kannada hasn't grabbed that gas in the

bottom left hand corner but which is

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.490 
bottom left hand corner but which is
really<00:01:39.210> what<00:01:39.360> you<00:01:39.420> want<00:01:39.720> that's<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.290> payoff

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
really what you want that's the payoff

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.069 
really what you want that's the payoff
when<00:01:41.070> you<00:01:41.189> take<00:01:41.340> expansions<00:01:41.880> for<00:01:41.939> terran<00:01:42.479> but

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
when you take expansions for terran but

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.080 
when you take expansions for terran but
but<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:43.979> very<00:01:44.159> least<00:01:44.310> he's<00:01:44.520> be<00:01:44.640> able<00:01:44.820> he's

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
but the very least he's be able he's

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.609 
but the very least he's be able he's
able<00:01:45.180> to<00:01:45.360> stop<00:01:45.570> a<00:01:45.600> gas<00:01:45.810> at<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.110> twelve<00:01:46.380> o'clock

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
able to stop a gas at the twelve o'clock

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.950 
able to stop a gas at the twelve o'clock
so<00:01:46.770> he's<00:01:46.890> at<00:01:47.009> least<00:01:47.159> up<00:01:47.369> one<00:01:47.909> gas<00:01:48.210> she's<00:01:48.810> able

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
so he's at least up one gas she's able

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.389 
so he's at least up one gas she's able
to<00:01:49.140> produce<00:01:49.259> those<00:01:49.560> heavy<00:01:49.829> troops<00:01:50.220> that

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
to produce those heavy troops that

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:51.950 
to produce those heavy troops that
really<00:01:50.610> count<00:01:50.850> konata<00:01:51.149> going<00:01:51.450> in<00:01:51.570> with<00:01:51.930> a

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
really count konata going in with a

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.600 
really count konata going in with a
sizable<00:01:52.470> attack<00:01:52.710> force<00:01:52.950> maybe<00:01:53.189> he<00:01:53.369> can<00:01:53.490> do

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
sizable attack force maybe he can do

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.030 
sizable attack force maybe he can do
something<00:01:53.960> some<00:01:54.960> sort<00:01:55.350> of<00:01:55.409> counter<00:01:55.740> drop<00:01:55.860> if

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
something some sort of counter drop if

something some sort of counter drop if
he<00:01:56.130> can<00:01:56.250> do<00:01:56.340> something<00:01:56.610> significant<00:01:57.119> against

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
he can do something significant against

he can do something significant against

their force and it looks like one

00:02:39.889 --> 00:02:41.199 
their force and it looks like one
dropship<00:02:40.370> does<00:02:40.609> make<00:02:40.760> sure<00:02:40.909> you<00:02:41.000> through<00:02:41.180> a

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
dropship does make sure you through a

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:42.699 
dropship does make sure you through a
thought<00:02:41.389> I<00:02:41.420> might<00:02:41.629> get<00:02:41.750> taken<00:02:42.019> out<00:02:42.079> seating<00:02:42.590> up

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
thought I might get taken out seating up

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:45.580 
thought I might get taken out seating up
and<00:02:42.950> again<00:02:43.430> weapons<00:02:43.969> to<00:02:44.329> vs.<00:02:44.689> weapons<00:02:45.049> one<00:02:45.319> and

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
and again weapons to vs. weapons one and

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.860 
and again weapons to vs. weapons one and
out<00:02:46.189> kannada<00:02:46.790> just<00:02:47.180> getting<00:02:47.389> that<00:02:47.480> weapon<00:02:47.780> I

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
out kannada just getting that weapon I

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.149 
out kannada just getting that weapon I
think<00:02:48.079> he's<00:02:48.200> waiting<00:02:48.500> for<00:02:48.620> that<00:02:48.709> weapons<00:02:49.010> too

00:02:49.149 --> 00:02:49.159 
think he's waiting for that weapons too

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:50.710 
think he's waiting for that weapons too
he's<00:02:49.549> going<00:02:49.700> to<00:02:49.760> land<00:02:49.939> on<00:02:50.150> these<00:02:50.359> command

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
he's going to land on these command

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.809 
he's going to land on these command
centers<00:02:51.079> some<00:02:51.530> SUVs<00:02:51.709> up<00:02:52.459> in<00:02:52.549> that<00:02:52.609> position

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:52.819 
centers some SUVs up in that position

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:55.149 
centers some SUVs up in that position
but<00:02:53.120> again<00:02:53.450> as<00:02:53.659> you<00:02:54.049> can<00:02:54.109> see<00:02:54.290> in<00:02:54.409> coming<00:02:55.040> back

00:02:55.149 --> 00:02:55.159 
but again as you can see in coming back

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:57.699 
but again as you can see in coming back
around<00:02:55.930> does<00:02:56.930> he<00:02:57.049> still<00:02:57.260> troops<00:02:57.530> in<00:02:57.620> there

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
around does he still troops in there

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:59.440 
around does he still troops in there
losing<00:02:57.919> a<00:02:58.189> dropship<00:02:58.609> he<00:02:58.730> might<00:02:58.879> lose<00:02:59.030> a<00:02:59.090> second

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
losing a dropship he might lose a second

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:00.699 
losing a dropship he might lose a second
or<00:02:59.510> he's<00:02:59.599> got<00:02:59.719> a<00:02:59.750> little<00:02:59.840> load<00:03:00.379> up<00:03:00.530> those

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
or he's got a little load up those

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:02.649 
or he's got a little load up those
troops<00:03:01.010> it<00:03:01.159> looks<00:03:01.310> like<00:03:01.519> losing<00:03:02.239> a<00:03:02.299> couple<00:03:02.480> is

00:03:02.649 --> 00:03:02.659 
troops it looks like losing a couple is

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:03.640 
troops it looks like losing a couple is
their<00:03:02.780> kind<00:03:02.900> of<00:03:03.019> drifting<00:03:03.319> across<00:03:03.379> the

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
their kind of drifting across the

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.920 
their kind of drifting across the
thought<00:03:04.040> he<00:03:04.129> might<00:03:04.310> be<00:03:04.340> trying<00:03:04.579> to<00:03:04.700> not<00:03:05.510> doing

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
thought he might be trying to not doing

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.360 
thought he might be trying to not doing
a<00:03:05.989> little<00:03:06.139> bit<00:03:06.290> of<00:03:06.319> a<00:03:06.439> poor<00:03:06.680> job<00:03:06.829> there<00:03:07.040> but<00:03:07.340> a

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
a little bit of a poor job there but a

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.159 
a little bit of a poor job there but a
counter<00:03:07.730> drop<00:03:07.909> from<00:03:08.329> kannada<00:03:08.659> pushing<00:03:09.079> and

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:09.169 
counter drop from kannada pushing and

00:03:09.169 --> 00:03:10.179 
counter drop from kannada pushing and
he's<00:03:09.260> going<00:03:09.409> to<00:03:09.469> run<00:03:09.560> into<00:03:09.680> all<00:03:09.859> sorts<00:03:09.889> of

00:03:10.179 --> 00:03:10.189 
he's going to run into all sorts of

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:11.619 
he's going to run into all sorts of
turrets<00:03:10.459> they<00:03:10.519> don't<00:03:10.700> see<00:03:10.819> any<00:03:11.000> troops<00:03:11.299> to

00:03:11.619 --> 00:03:11.629 
turrets they don't see any troops to

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:12.879 
turrets they don't see any troops to
defend<00:03:11.659> against<00:03:12.260> this<00:03:12.409> it<00:03:12.620> looks<00:03:12.709> like<00:03:12.859> a

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:12.889 
defend against this it looks like a

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:14.259 
defend against this it looks like a
single<00:03:13.159> one<00:03:13.250> I<00:03:13.280> think<00:03:13.400> not<00:03:13.669> to<00:03:13.819> realize<00:03:14.090> this

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:14.269 
single one I think not to realize this

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:16.629 
single one I think not to realize this
and<00:03:14.389> all<00:03:14.870> man<00:03:15.319> kannada<00:03:15.829> getting<00:03:16.159> in<00:03:16.280> position

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:16.639 
and all man kannada getting in position

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:18.670 
and all man kannada getting in position
over<00:03:17.030> all<00:03:17.299> the<00:03:17.449> factories<00:03:17.870> siege<00:03:18.349> up<00:03:18.530> in<00:03:18.620> the

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
over all the factories siege up in the

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.050 
over all the factories siege up in the
back<00:03:18.859> position<00:03:19.310> let's<00:03:19.459> see<00:03:19.579> if<00:03:19.639> he<00:03:19.729> can<00:03:19.760> fend

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
back position let's see if he can fend

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.580 
back position let's see if he can fend
ass<00:03:20.150> off<00:03:20.329> he<00:03:20.449> can't<00:03:20.750> fend<00:03:20.959> this<00:03:21.049> off<00:03:21.229> this

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
ass off he can't fend this off this

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.080 
ass off he can't fend this off this
might<00:03:21.769> be<00:03:21.799> GG<00:03:22.069> but<00:03:22.340> with<00:03:22.430> that<00:03:22.549> weapons<00:03:22.909> one

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
might be GG but with that weapons one

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:24.369 
might be GG but with that weapons one
disappear<00:03:23.510> i'm<00:03:23.569> sorry<00:03:23.780> with<00:03:23.930> the<00:03:23.989> weapons<00:03:24.260> to

00:03:24.369 --> 00:03:24.379 
disappear i'm sorry with the weapons to

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:26.319 
disappear i'm sorry with the weapons to
vs.<00:03:24.650> weapons<00:03:24.949> one<00:03:25.159> I<00:03:25.310> think<00:03:25.760> kannada<00:03:26.000> will<00:03:26.209> be

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:26.329 
vs. weapons one I think kannada will be

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:27.879 
vs. weapons one I think kannada will be
able<00:03:26.419> to<00:03:26.569> fight<00:03:26.690> this<00:03:26.810> off<00:03:26.989> but<00:03:27.169> is<00:03:27.260> drop<00:03:27.680> ships

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:27.889 
able to fight this off but is drop ships

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:30.759 
able to fight this off but is drop ships
are<00:03:28.099> isolated<00:03:28.819> they<00:03:28.939> are<00:03:29.180> at<00:03:29.900> a<00:03:29.959> back<00:03:30.319> position

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:30.769 
are isolated they are at a back position

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:32.080 
are isolated they are at a back position
he<00:03:30.919> can't<00:03:31.250> really<00:03:31.459> get<00:03:31.760> there<00:03:31.909> because

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
he can't really get there because

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:33.580 
he can't really get there because
they're<00:03:32.329> just<00:03:32.510> separated<00:03:32.989> by<00:03:33.049> that<00:03:33.199> turret

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
they're just separated by that turret

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.439 
they're just separated by that turret
line<00:03:33.769> kannada<00:03:34.609> now<00:03:34.849> trying<00:03:35.150> to<00:03:35.209> bring<00:03:35.329> his

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:35.449 
line kannada now trying to bring his

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:36.909 
line kannada now trying to bring his
forces<00:03:35.810> back<00:03:35.959> it<00:03:36.290> looks<00:03:36.439> like<00:03:36.560> he's<00:03:36.680> able<00:03:36.799> to

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:36.919 
forces back it looks like he's able to

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:38.170 
forces back it looks like he's able to
take<00:03:37.129> out<00:03:37.250> those<00:03:37.370> two<00:03:37.609> command<00:03:37.849> centers<00:03:38.120> in

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
take out those two command centers in

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:39.189 
take out those two command centers in
the<00:03:38.239> upper<00:03:38.419> left-hand<00:03:38.659> base<00:03:38.840> so<00:03:38.959> i<00:03:38.989> don't

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:39.199 
the upper left-hand base so i don't

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:40.869 
the upper left-hand base so i don't
think<00:03:39.319> it'll<00:03:39.439> even<00:03:39.620> matter<00:03:39.889> even<00:03:40.400> if<00:03:40.549> he<00:03:40.669> loses

00:03:40.869 --> 00:03:40.879 
think it'll even matter even if he loses

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:42.339 
think it'll even matter even if he loses
those<00:03:41.150> factories<00:03:41.569> is<00:03:41.689> going<00:03:41.810> to<00:03:41.900> be<00:03:41.989> in<00:03:42.079> such

00:03:42.339 --> 00:03:42.349 
those factories is going to be in such

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:45.849 
those factories is going to be in such
an<00:03:42.500> economic<00:03:42.979> position<00:03:43.370> after<00:03:43.939> this<00:03:44.329> drop<00:03:44.859> but

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:45.859 
an economic position after this drop but

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:46.809 
an economic position after this drop but
i<00:03:45.889> think<00:03:46.129> he's<00:03:46.220> going<00:03:46.340> to<00:03:46.400> be<00:03:46.489> able<00:03:46.549> to<00:03:46.699> take

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:46.819 
i think he's going to be able to take

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:48.789 
i think he's going to be able to take
the<00:03:46.939> game<00:03:47.090> in<00:03:47.239> the<00:03:47.449> long<00:03:47.659> run<00:03:47.689> so<00:03:48.439> it<00:03:48.650> looks

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:48.799 
the game in the long run so it looks

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:51.219 
the game in the long run so it looks
like<00:03:48.859> he<00:03:49.009> has<00:03:49.189> lost<00:03:49.430> a<00:03:49.699> two<00:03:50.180> factories<00:03:50.689> but<00:03:51.169> i

00:03:51.219 --> 00:03:51.229 
like he has lost a two factories but i

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:52.300 
like he has lost a two factories but i
think<00:03:51.470> he's<00:03:51.560> going<00:03:51.680> to<00:03:51.739> be<00:03:51.829> able<00:03:51.889> to<00:03:52.040> replenish

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
think he's going to be able to replenish

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:53.409 
think he's going to be able to replenish
them<00:03:52.639> let's<00:03:52.819> see<00:03:52.939> if<00:03:53.000> he<00:03:53.060> can<00:03:53.090> get<00:03:53.269> those

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:53.419 
them let's see if he can get those

00:03:53.419 --> 00:03:54.849 
them let's see if he can get those
dropships<00:03:53.689> background<00:03:54.259> to<00:03:54.349> clean<00:03:54.560> this<00:03:54.680> up

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:54.859 
dropships background to clean this up
