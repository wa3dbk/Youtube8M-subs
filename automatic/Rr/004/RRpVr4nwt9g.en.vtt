how<00:05:02.740> this<00:05:02.919> thing's<00:05:03.160> supposed<00:05:03.250> to<00:05:03.490> work<00:05:03.639> this

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:04.360 
how this thing's supposed to work this

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.080 
how this thing's supposed to work this
arm<00:05:04.750> here<00:05:05.460> pivots<00:05:06.460> all<00:05:06.610> the<00:05:06.700> way<00:05:06.790> to<00:05:06.850> the<00:05:06.970> end

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:07.090 
arm here pivots all the way to the end

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:08.580 
arm here pivots all the way to the end
to<00:05:07.419> the<00:05:07.510> foot<00:05:07.720> pedal<00:05:08.020> but<00:05:08.139> you<00:05:08.260> can<00:05:08.380> push<00:05:08.560> down

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:08.590 
to the foot pedal but you can push down

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.070 
to the foot pedal but you can push down
right<00:05:09.040> here<00:05:09.280> push<00:05:10.210> this<00:05:10.240> down<00:05:10.510> on<00:05:10.690> this<00:05:10.840> guy

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080 
right here push this down on this guy

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.340 
right here push this down on this guy
raise<00:05:11.889> the<00:05:12.340> wheels<00:05:12.550> on<00:05:12.850> this<00:05:13.120> side<00:05:13.419> right<00:05:13.660> so

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:14.350 
raise the wheels on this side right so

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:16.350 
raise the wheels on this side right so
now<00:05:14.530> that<00:05:14.590> we<00:05:14.950> can<00:05:15.130> easily<00:05:15.340> get<00:05:15.639> the<00:05:15.700> table<00:05:16.180> off

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:16.360 
now that we can easily get the table off

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.780 
now that we can easily get the table off
the<00:05:16.389> ground<00:05:16.810> by<00:05:17.680> just<00:05:17.950> pushing<00:05:18.400> this<00:05:18.550> foot

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:18.790 
the ground by just pushing this foot

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:21.780 
the ground by just pushing this foot
pedal<00:05:18.820> here<00:05:19.919> very<00:05:20.919> little<00:05:21.220> pressure<00:05:21.430> to<00:05:21.669> get

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:21.790 
pedal here very little pressure to get

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:26.850 
pedal here very little pressure to get
it<00:05:21.880> off<00:05:22.260> it's<00:05:23.260> good<00:05:24.780> now<00:05:25.780> I'm<00:05:26.350> gonna<00:05:26.530> put<00:05:26.770> my

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:26.860 
it off it's good now I'm gonna put my

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.350 
it off it's good now I'm gonna put my
shelf<00:05:27.100> back<00:05:27.340> on<00:05:27.580> loading<00:05:27.850> up<00:05:28.000> with<00:05:28.030> all<00:05:28.270> the

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:28.360 
shelf back on loading up with all the

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.140 
shelf back on loading up with all the
tools<00:05:28.630> and<00:05:29.169> figure<00:05:30.039> out<00:05:30.070> how<00:05:30.400> we're<00:05:30.610> going<00:05:30.760> to

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:31.150 
tools and figure out how we're going to

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:35.190 
tools and figure out how we're going to
lock<00:05:31.900> it<00:05:31.930> in<00:05:32.260> the<00:05:32.380> down<00:05:32.560> position<00:05:34.140> all<00:05:35.140> right

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:35.200 
lock it in the down position all right

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:36.570 
lock it in the down position all right
so<00:05:35.380> what<00:05:35.470> I<00:05:35.500> came<00:05:35.650> up<00:05:35.770> with<00:05:35.860> for<00:05:36.160> a<00:05:36.190> locking

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:36.580 
so what I came up with for a locking

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:38.719 
so what I came up with for a locking
mechanism<00:05:36.630> it's<00:05:37.630> just<00:05:37.810> basically

00:05:38.719 --> 00:05:38.729 
mechanism it's just basically

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:41.219 
mechanism it's just basically
crossmember<00:05:39.729> and<00:05:40.090> mounted<00:05:40.390> in<00:05:40.539> here<00:05:40.840> and<00:05:41.080> then

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:41.229 
crossmember and mounted in here and then

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:42.779 
crossmember and mounted in here and then
the<00:05:41.350> leftover<00:05:41.800> piece<00:05:41.979> a<00:05:42.070> half-inch<00:05:42.400> pipe<00:05:42.580> I

00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:42.789 
the leftover piece a half-inch pipe I

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:45.840 
the leftover piece a half-inch pipe I
used<00:05:43.000> for<00:05:43.210> a<00:05:43.240> hinge<00:05:43.419> point<00:05:43.780> and<00:05:44.400> a<00:05:45.400> lag<00:05:45.640> what

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:45.850 
used for a hinge point and a lag what

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:48.630 
used for a hinge point and a lag what
comes<00:05:46.060> down<00:05:46.270> to<00:05:46.539> hold<00:05:46.810> this<00:05:47.500> arm<00:05:47.919> in<00:05:48.220> the<00:05:48.490> down

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:48.640 
comes down to hold this arm in the down

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:52.860 
comes down to hold this arm in the down
position<00:05:48.669> so<00:05:49.470> basically<00:05:51.360> that's<00:05:52.360> what<00:05:52.630> it's

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:52.870 
position so basically that's what it's

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:55.500 
position so basically that's what it's
on<00:05:53.020> its<00:05:53.200> legs<00:05:53.500> and<00:05:54.100> push<00:05:54.520> it<00:05:54.669> down<00:05:54.760> that<00:05:55.240> puts

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:55.510 
on its legs and push it down that puts

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:58.770 
on its legs and push it down that puts
it<00:05:55.660> on<00:05:55.840> its<00:05:55.960> wheels<00:05:56.850> pretty<00:05:57.850> simple<00:05:58.240> but<00:05:58.660> it

00:05:58.770 --> 00:05:58.780 
it on its wheels pretty simple but it

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:19.410 
it on its wheels pretty simple but it
works

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:19.420 

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:21.910 

now<00:06:20.420> you<00:06:20.630> can<00:06:20.780> really<00:06:21.050> appreciate<00:06:21.200> be<00:06:21.650> able<00:06:21.800> to
