00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:06.330
 hello everyone well let's do the 

00:00:02.889 --> 00:00:08.920
 connection of a telephone jack 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.080
 recessed in the wall and for it 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:13.420
 we have already put the different cables 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:16.900
 right now we're just going to make the cable 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:21.070
 for this, we need a 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:25.750
 take the phone and the cable already inserted 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:28.520
 in the mechanism box we peel in the 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:33.970
 hose the area of 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:33.970
 stable and now we peel the threads 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:42.730
 in this in this series the hostels that 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.730
 let's connect are the red 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.290
 of red and green 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.580
 anyway there are usually other 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:54.980
 that have other colors like those that 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:57.980
 they come to brown and white hoses but 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:00.080
 in this case they are different colors but 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.550
 good considering that the 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.380
 terminals that we have to connect are 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.800
 those of the center then with a tester 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:09.140
 we can know which are the ones that have 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:12.320
 the cables that we have to connect in 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:15.920
 this axis also does not put if it is l 1 l 2 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:18.280
 but we have checked it 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.950
 previously 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.090
 It would be well done, once done 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.399
 this 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:28.250
 we give you a little spin that does not 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:31.360
 touch each other once 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.360
 that are installed 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:51.070
 we check it and we see that they are 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:51.070
 well connected and do not touch each other 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:58.079
 then we install it already in your house 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.079
 we turn around 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:10.979
 to see that he does not want to enter 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.979
 what is wrong with you 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.220
 neither revelation 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.549
 this is how 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.310
 ah 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:47.440
 well done so we would have already placed the 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:50.590
 take the wall of the phone and already 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:53.800
 we simply need to place the 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.569
 embellisher very well I hope that you 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.410
 serve someone thank you very much and until 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:58.410
 the next video
