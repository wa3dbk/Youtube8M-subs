00:07:10.219 --> 00:07:10.229 
should really look up like spawn

00:07:10.229 --> 00:07:12.409 
should really look up like spawn
sometime<00:07:10.620> and<00:07:10.800> you<00:07:11.009> should<00:07:11.310> also<00:07:11.580> spawn<00:07:12.060> and

00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:39.700 
calculation I'll probably show a video

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:42.210 
calculation I'll probably show a video
how<00:07:39.970> did<00:07:40.210> my<00:07:40.390> calculation<00:07:41.110> for<00:07:41.380> like<00:07:42.100> an

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:42.220 
how did my calculation for like an

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:43.800 
how did my calculation for like an
update<00:07:42.520> on<00:07:42.550> character<00:07:43.000> each<00:07:43.120> iteration<00:07:43.450> for

00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:48.580 
another update for my character creation

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:50.550 
another update for my character creation
of<00:07:48.820> spawn<00:07:49.210> I<00:07:49.540> want<00:07:49.840> to<00:07:49.930> show<00:07:50.080> exactly<00:07:50.290> how<00:07:50.530> I

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:50.560 
of spawn I want to show exactly how I

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:51.720 
of spawn I want to show exactly how I
didn't<00:07:50.920> because<00:07:51.100> I<00:07:51.160> think<00:07:51.220> I<00:07:51.430> did<00:07:51.550> a<00:07:51.580> little

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:51.730 
didn't because I think I did a little

00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:53.100 
didn't because I think I did a little
bit<00:07:51.880> different<00:07:52.210> than<00:07:52.330> other<00:07:52.480> people<00:07:52.840> as<00:07:52.930> in<00:07:53.020> a

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:53.110 
bit different than other people as in a

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:54.480 
bit different than other people as in a
few<00:07:53.290> billets<00:07:53.560> or<00:07:53.650> what<00:07:53.770> people<00:07:53.950> do<00:07:54.130> in<00:07:54.250> spawn

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:54.490 
few billets or what people do in spawn

00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:56.880 
few billets or what people do in spawn
there<00:07:54.730> -<00:07:55.000> is<00:07:55.150> slightly<00:07:55.900> different<00:07:56.440> so<00:07:56.650> I'll

00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:56.890 
there - is slightly different so I'll

00:07:56.890 --> 00:07:57.990 
there - is slightly different so I'll
probably<00:07:57.040> put<00:07:57.340> a<00:07:57.400> pretty<00:07:57.580> view<00:07:57.700> showing

00:07:57.990 --> 00:07:58.000 
probably put a pretty view showing

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.330 
probably put a pretty view showing
exactly<00:07:58.510> how<00:07:58.660> many<00:07:58.840> so<00:07:59.290> anyways<00:08:00.100> thank<00:08:00.310> you

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:00.340
