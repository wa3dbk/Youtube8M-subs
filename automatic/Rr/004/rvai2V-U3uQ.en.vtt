school<00:00:26.490> and<00:00:26.779> we're<00:00:27.779> very<00:00:27.960> interested<00:00:28.080> in<00:00:28.380> the

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
school and we're very interested in the

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.590 
school and we're very interested in the
green<00:00:28.590> cleaning<00:00:28.859> not<00:00:29.310> only<00:00:29.460> from<00:00:29.640> perspective

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:30.600 
green cleaning not only from perspective

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.000 
green cleaning not only from perspective
that's<00:00:30.689> better<00:00:30.930> for<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.170> students<00:00:31.529> but<00:00:31.949> also

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:32.010 
that's better for the students but also

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:34.970 
that's better for the students but also
to<00:00:32.279> expose<00:00:32.699> our<00:00:32.879> students<00:00:33.300> to<00:00:33.680> that<00:00:34.680> field

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
to expose our students to that field

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.890 
to expose our students to that field
that<00:00:35.190> career<00:00:35.550> those<00:00:36.030> opportunities<00:00:36.570> that<00:00:36.809> are

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:36.900 
that career those opportunities that are

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.180 
that career those opportunities that are
out<00:00:36.930> there<00:00:37.050> in<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.320> future<00:00:37.470> for<00:00:37.800> them<00:00:37.949> of

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
out there in the future for them of

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.030 
out there in the future for them of
being<00:00:38.730> more<00:00:39.090> aware<00:00:40.019> and<00:00:40.230> conscious<00:00:40.680> of<00:00:40.890> what's

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
being more aware and conscious of what's

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:49.940 
being more aware and conscious of what's
going<00:00:41.220> on<00:00:41.309> in<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.430> environment<00:00:41.640> around<00:00:41.879> them

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.230 

I<00:00:50.540> think<00:00:51.540> that<00:00:52.100> the<00:00:53.100> change<00:00:53.700> in<00:00:53.880> the<00:00:54.000> green

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:54.240 
I think that the change in the green

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.810 
I think that the change in the green
cleaning<00:00:54.540> has<00:00:55.200> had<00:00:55.500> an<00:00:55.680> impact<00:00:55.890> on<00:00:56.370> students

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
cleaning has had an impact on students

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.730 
cleaning has had an impact on students
who<00:00:56.910> have<00:00:57.060> allergies<00:00:57.570> what<00:00:58.380> I<00:00:58.410> would<00:00:58.710> have

00:00:58.730 --> 00:00:58.740 
who have allergies what I would have

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.590 
who have allergies what I would have
previously<00:00:59.250> attributed<00:00:59.580> to<00:00:59.880> outdoor

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
previously attributed to outdoor

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.960 
previously attributed to outdoor
allergens<00:01:01.200> probably<00:01:02.130> wasn't<00:01:02.430> all<00:01:02.550> outdoor

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:02.970 
allergens probably wasn't all outdoor

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:04.189 
allergens probably wasn't all outdoor
allergens<00:01:03.300> I<00:01:03.480> think<00:01:03.750> it<00:01:03.810> was<00:01:03.840> indoor

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
allergens I think it was indoor

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:12.800 
allergens I think it was indoor
allergens<00:01:04.350> as<00:01:04.739> well

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.960 

there's<00:01:13.590> there's<00:01:14.130> so<00:01:14.220> many<00:01:14.280> chemicals<00:01:14.790> and

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
there's there's so many chemicals and

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.179 
there's there's so many chemicals and
then<00:01:15.240> things<00:01:15.509> are<00:01:15.600> being<00:01:15.780> used<00:01:15.990> today<00:01:16.200> how

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
then things are being used today how

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.620 
then things are being used today how
could<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.399> child<00:01:17.460> not<00:01:17.790> be<00:01:17.970> allergic<00:01:18.149> to<00:01:18.329> some<00:01:18.509> of

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
could a child not be allergic to some of

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:19.639 
could a child not be allergic to some of
those<00:01:18.720> things<00:01:18.899> I<00:01:19.110> think<00:01:19.259> once<00:01:19.380> you<00:01:19.470> start

00:01:19.639 --> 00:01:19.649 
those things I think once you start

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:21.080 
those things I think once you start
eliminating<00:01:19.799> some<00:01:20.220> those<00:01:20.340> chemicals<00:01:20.759> you've

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
eliminating some those chemicals you've

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.670 
eliminating some those chemicals you've
eliminated<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.659> allergies<00:01:22.049> that<00:01:22.079> they<00:01:22.439> had

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
eliminated the allergies that they had

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:31.060 
eliminated the allergies that they had
as<00:01:22.829> well

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.330 

and<00:01:31.340> I<00:01:31.820> think<00:01:31.880> people<00:01:32.450> understand<00:01:32.990> the<00:01:33.110> impact

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
and I think people understand the impact

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.429 
and I think people understand the impact
students<00:01:34.549> absent<00:01:34.789> has<00:01:35.149> on<00:01:35.299> that<00:01:35.390> child<00:01:35.750> but

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:36.439 
students absent has on that child but

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:39.010 
students absent has on that child but
the<00:01:36.950> absence<00:01:37.250> of<00:01:37.549> a<00:01:37.640> teacher<00:01:37.850> affects<00:01:38.689> 30

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
the absence of a teacher affects 30

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.440 
the absence of a teacher affects 30
children<00:01:39.289> at<00:01:39.710> one<00:01:39.859> time<00:01:40.130> and<00:01:40.460> there's<00:01:41.060> a<00:01:41.149> lot

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
children at one time and there's a lot

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:42.789 
children at one time and there's a lot
of<00:01:41.509> research<00:01:41.869> out<00:01:41.960> there<00:01:42.020> that<00:01:42.170> will<00:01:42.350> tell<00:01:42.590> you

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:42.799 
of research out there that will tell you

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:45.550 
of research out there that will tell you
that<00:01:43.009> ones<00:01:43.729> when<00:01:44.569> teachers<00:01:44.780> are<00:01:44.990> absent<00:01:45.409> when

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
that ones when teachers are absent when

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.620 
that ones when teachers are absent when
they're<00:01:45.740> not<00:01:45.950> they're<00:01:46.219> teaching<00:01:46.490> that<00:01:47.240> the

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
they're not they're teaching that the

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.120 
they're not they're teaching that the
students<00:01:48.229> are<00:01:48.289> suffering<00:01:48.649> your<00:01:48.770> academic

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
students are suffering your academic

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:50.559 
students are suffering your academic
achievement<00:01:49.460> is<00:01:49.520> suffering<00:01:49.819> tremendously

00:01:50.559 --> 00:01:50.569 
achievement is suffering tremendously

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:52.600 
achievement is suffering tremendously
and<00:01:51.110> so<00:01:51.619> you<00:01:51.679> need<00:01:51.920> to<00:01:52.009> have<00:01:52.159> your<00:01:52.250> adults<00:01:52.549> here

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
and so you need to have your adults here

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.300 
and so you need to have your adults here
at<00:01:52.759> all<00:01:52.850> times<00:01:53.119> and<00:01:53.479> i<00:01:53.539> think<00:01:53.780> i<00:01:54.229> think<00:01:54.979> the

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
at all times and i think i think the

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.499 
at all times and i think i think the
adults<00:01:55.579> are<00:01:55.640> more<00:01:55.850> aware<00:01:55.939> of<00:01:56.149> what's<00:01:56.959> going<00:01:57.049> on

00:01:58.499 --> 00:01:58.509 
adults are more aware of what's going on

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:00.789 
adults are more aware of what's going on
with<00:01:59.509> the<00:01:59.750> with<00:02:00.020> the<00:02:00.049> green<00:02:00.289> cleaning<00:02:00.530> is<00:02:00.649> just

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799 
with the with the green cleaning is just

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:02.230 
with the with the green cleaning is just
in<00:02:00.890> awareness<00:02:01.100> to<00:02:01.340> them<00:02:01.490> too<00:02:01.700> because<00:02:01.850> he

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
in awareness to them too because he

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.520 
in awareness to them too because he
previously<00:02:02.630> teachers<00:02:03.020> would<00:02:03.170> always<00:02:03.380> just

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
previously teachers would always just

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.230 
previously teachers would always just
pop<00:02:03.979> up<00:02:04.159> and<00:02:04.340> start<00:02:04.520> cleaning<00:02:04.640> their<00:02:04.909> own<00:02:05.000> room

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
pop up and start cleaning their own room

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.339 
pop up and start cleaning their own room
and<00:02:05.420> doing<00:02:05.509> things<00:02:05.780> they<00:02:06.049> would<00:02:06.170> grab

00:02:06.339 --> 00:02:06.349 
and doing things they would grab

00:02:06.349 --> 00:02:07.779 
and doing things they would grab
whatever<00:02:06.530> they<00:02:06.770> had<00:02:06.920> there<00:02:07.159> but<00:02:07.610> if<00:02:07.700> they

00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:07.789 
whatever they had there but if they

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:08.800 
whatever they had there but if they
brought<00:02:07.970> from<00:02:08.090> home<00:02:08.269> whatever<00:02:08.539> they<00:02:08.690> could

the fact that you can't just use

concerning risk management now

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.240 
concerning risk management now
previously<00:02:30.670> my<00:02:30.850> foyer<00:02:31.150> was<00:02:31.480> a<00:02:31.510> tiled<00:02:32.290> area<00:02:32.770> a

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
previously my foyer was a tiled area a

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.030 
previously my foyer was a tiled area a
sort<00:02:33.700> of<00:02:33.730> a<00:02:33.820> ceramic<00:02:34.270> tile<00:02:34.510> and<00:02:34.980> during<00:02:35.980> the

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
sort of a ceramic tile and during the

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.890 
sort of a ceramic tile and during the
winter<00:02:36.310> months<00:02:36.340> especially<00:02:36.760> when<00:02:37.570> it<00:02:37.750> would

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
winter months especially when it would

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.320 
winter months especially when it would
get<00:02:38.080> icy<00:02:38.920> outside<00:02:39.040> they<00:02:39.460> put<00:02:39.700> the<00:02:39.820> melt<00:02:40.060> this

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
get icy outside they put the melt this

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.720 
get icy outside they put the melt this
ice<00:02:40.750> melt<00:02:41.050> and<00:02:41.260> things<00:02:41.440> down<00:02:41.680> that<00:02:42.370> would<00:02:42.550> come

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
ice melt and things down that would come

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.940 
ice melt and things down that would come
into<00:02:42.880> that<00:02:43.090> floor<00:02:43.600> and<00:02:43.930> it<00:02:44.230> would<00:02:44.380> just<00:02:44.410> coat

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
into that floor and it would just coat

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.980 
into that floor and it would just coat
it<00:02:44.980> it<00:02:45.280> was<00:02:45.430> like<00:02:45.550> an<00:02:45.730> ice<00:02:45.910> rink<00:02:46.180> and<00:02:46.420> so<00:02:46.840> it<00:02:46.900> was

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:46.990 
it it was like an ice rink and so it was

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:49.350 
it it was like an ice rink and so it was
really<00:02:47.290> dangerous<00:02:47.530> I<00:02:47.890> had<00:02:48.070> I<00:02:48.340> think<00:02:48.700> a<00:02:49.150> couple

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
really dangerous I had I think a couple

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.300 
really dangerous I had I think a couple
years<00:02:49.630> ago<00:02:49.690> before<00:02:50.260> we<00:02:50.410> replaced<00:02:50.800> it<00:02:50.920> I<00:02:51.040> had

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
years ago before we replaced it I had

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.570 
years ago before we replaced it I had
about<00:02:51.670> three<00:02:52.060> staff<00:02:52.420> members<00:02:52.450> who<00:02:53.020> fell

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
about three staff members who fell

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.320 
about three staff members who fell
specifically<00:02:54.580> because<00:02:54.730> of<00:02:54.970> that<00:02:55.120> and<00:02:55.210> then

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
specifically because of that and then

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.600 
specifically because of that and then
you're<00:02:55.510> going<00:02:55.690> upstairs<00:02:56.110> and<00:02:56.620> whatnot<00:02:57.250> and

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
you're going upstairs and whatnot and

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:58.980 
you're going upstairs and whatnot and
your<00:02:57.850> shoes<00:02:58.090> are<00:02:58.240> slick<00:02:58.480> because<00:02:58.750> you<00:02:58.840> don't

00:02:58.980 --> 00:02:58.990 
your shoes are slick because you don't

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:01.140 
your shoes are slick because you don't
just<00:02:59.140> fall<00:02:59.560> in<00:02:59.740> that<00:02:59.800> area<00:03:00.040> you<00:03:00.460> also<00:03:00.610> track<00:03:01.000> it

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
just fall in that area you also track it

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.480 
just fall in that area you also track it
through<00:03:01.180> the<00:03:01.390> building<00:03:01.750> and<00:03:01.900> so<00:03:02.500> actually

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:03.490 
through the building and so actually

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:05.010 
through the building and so actually
from<00:03:03.970> two<00:03:04.120> perspectives<00:03:04.270> from<00:03:04.720> the<00:03:04.840> risk

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:05.020 
from two perspectives from the risk

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:06.750 
from two perspectives from the risk
management<00:03:05.500> area<00:03:05.740> of<00:03:05.860> it<00:03:06.010> just<00:03:06.190> being<00:03:06.459> a

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
management area of it just being a

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.300 
management area of it just being a
concern<00:03:07.209> for<00:03:07.240> falling<00:03:08.080> and<00:03:08.230> safety<00:03:08.590> and<00:03:08.800> also

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
concern for falling and safety and also

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.430 
concern for falling and safety and also
all<00:03:09.850> of<00:03:10.090> these<00:03:10.209> things<00:03:10.390> are<00:03:10.540> coating<00:03:10.959> my<00:03:11.080> floor

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
all of these things are coating my floor

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:12.780 
all of these things are coating my floor
that<00:03:11.860> doesn't<00:03:12.100> seem<00:03:12.190> like<00:03:12.340> it's<00:03:12.520> a<00:03:12.580> real<00:03:12.760> good

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
that doesn't seem like it's a real good

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.910 
that doesn't seem like it's a real good
thing<00:03:13.480> to<00:03:13.630> have<00:03:13.750> in<00:03:13.900> my<00:03:14.020> building<00:03:14.410> so<00:03:14.770> just

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
thing to have in my building so just

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.170 
thing to have in my building so just
putting<00:03:15.130> that<00:03:15.190> matting<00:03:15.610> down<00:03:15.820> which<00:03:16.060> is

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
putting that matting down which is

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.510 
putting that matting down which is
really<00:03:16.360> a<00:03:16.420> heavy-duty<00:03:16.750> sort<00:03:17.440> of<00:03:17.500> matting<00:03:17.860> also

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:18.520 
really a heavy-duty sort of matting also

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.190 
really a heavy-duty sort of matting also
allows<00:03:18.760> the<00:03:18.940> kissa<00:03:19.150> that<00:03:19.510> gets<00:03:19.720> tracked<00:03:20.020> off

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
allows the kissa that gets tracked off

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.750 
allows the kissa that gets tracked off
their<00:03:20.410> feet<00:03:20.560> it<00:03:20.770> pulls<00:03:21.040> off<00:03:21.220> their<00:03:21.430> feet<00:03:21.610> so

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
their feet it pulls off their feet so

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:22.710 
their feet it pulls off their feet so
they're<00:03:21.910> not<00:03:22.000> tracking<00:03:22.420> it<00:03:22.510> through<00:03:22.660> the

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
they're not tracking it through the

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.510 
they're not tracking it through the
whole<00:03:22.870> building<00:03:23.080> and<00:03:23.470> then<00:03:23.860> we<00:03:23.950> can<00:03:24.130> use<00:03:24.160> the

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:24.520 
whole building and then we can use the

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:25.980 
whole building and then we can use the
machines<00:03:24.820> that<00:03:24.910> we<00:03:25.030> have<00:03:25.209> to<00:03:25.420> extract<00:03:25.720> it<00:03:25.900> out

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:25.990 
machines that we have to extract it out

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:27.660 
machines that we have to extract it out
of<00:03:26.110> the<00:03:26.200> carpet<00:03:26.410> right<00:03:26.680> there<00:03:26.950> and<00:03:27.190> it's<00:03:27.550> not

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
of the carpet right there and it's not

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:34.840 
of the carpet right there and it's not
an<00:03:27.790> issue<00:03:27.910> anymore

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:34.850 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.710 

I<00:03:34.970> think<00:03:35.810> people<00:03:36.500> notice<00:03:37.160> when<00:03:38.090> things<00:03:38.390> are

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
I think people notice when things are

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.140 
I think people notice when things are
dirty<00:03:39.230> people<00:03:39.950> notice<00:03:40.520> when<00:03:40.700> things<00:03:40.910> aren't

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
dirty people notice when things aren't

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.480 
dirty people notice when things aren't
healthy<00:03:41.480> but<00:03:42.140> when<00:03:42.260> they<00:03:42.380> are<00:03:42.620> healthy<00:03:43.220> and

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:43.490 
healthy but when they are healthy and

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:45.640 
healthy but when they are healthy and
they<00:03:43.820> are<00:03:44.000> clean<00:03:44.360> people<00:03:45.020> don't<00:03:45.200> make<00:03:45.350> as<00:03:45.530> many

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
they are clean people don't make as many

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.170 
they are clean people don't make as many
comments<00:03:45.950> because<00:03:46.250> they<00:03:46.430> don't<00:03:46.580> notice<00:03:46.880> it

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
comments because they don't notice it

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:48.940 
comments because they don't notice it
because<00:03:47.330> it<00:03:47.570> looks<00:03:47.870> good<00:03:48.140> it<00:03:48.200> smells<00:03:48.590> good<00:03:48.860> it

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
because it looks good it smells good it

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.070 
because it looks good it smells good it
feels<00:03:49.160> good<00:03:49.370> so<00:03:49.820> I<00:03:50.030> think<00:03:50.450> it's<00:03:50.660> not<00:03:50.840> a<00:03:50.870> matter

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:51.080 
feels good so I think it's not a matter

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.960 
feels good so I think it's not a matter
of<00:03:51.200> getting<00:03:51.380> more<00:03:51.680> compliments<00:03:52.490> for<00:03:52.790> what

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
of getting more compliments for what

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:54.310 
of getting more compliments for what
we've<00:03:53.090> done<00:03:53.240> in<00:03:53.330> the<00:03:53.390> building<00:03:53.660> it's<00:03:54.050> that<00:03:54.230> we

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:54.320 
we've done in the building it's that we
