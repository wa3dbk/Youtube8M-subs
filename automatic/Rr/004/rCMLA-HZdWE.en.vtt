00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:20.419 
it one before I steal it is i might

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:24.250 
it one before I steal it is i might
split<00:04:20.930> my<00:04:21.139> tracks<00:04:21.500> because<00:04:21.739> their<00:04:22.130> thick<00:04:23.260> see

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
split my tracks because their thick see

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.190 
split my tracks because their thick see
so<00:04:24.889> i<00:04:25.340> might<00:04:25.910> go<00:04:26.090> in<00:04:26.270> and<00:04:26.479> split<00:04:26.750> the<00:04:26.870> tracks

so i might go in and split the tracks

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.250 
so i might go in and split the tracks
just<00:04:28.130> so<00:04:28.340> that<00:04:28.610> when<00:04:28.940> I<00:04:28.970> make<00:04:29.060> my<00:04:29.270> wig<00:04:29.690> it's<00:04:30.050> not

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:41.419 
they're meant to be split because

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:48.570 
they're meant to be split because
they're<00:04:41.630> pretty<00:04:41.870> thick<00:04:42.169> as<00:04:43.100> you<00:04:43.250> guys<00:04:43.430> can<00:04:43.639> see
