00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:00.580
 Hi 

00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.280
 Giving up the beloved is one of the most difficult situations we are going through 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.340
 There are many who are not good at dealing with these situations and have no idea of ​​the right way to get away 

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:08.760
 There are no ways to distance yourself from anyone you love 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.080
 And if you have seen this experience before 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.000
 You will know that it is a break from someone harder to break a relationship 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.900
 Especially if you are still interested in it 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.880
 For this reason more people are using strange ways to cut the relationship 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.100
 Separation by text message 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.780
 Many of you know it is one of the worst ways to break up 

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:24.960
 I know from personal experience 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.100
 It's the worst feeling ever 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.700
 It's a harshly straightforward and cowardly way 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.800
 Welcome, Ante is ready 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.200
 - What - prepared for other materials 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.200
 You do not have chemistry anymore 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.200
 exactly 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.240
 Why did not you clean the toilet? 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.240
 There are C-shaped dirt 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.240
 This is because you have to turn your head to the right 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:00.980
 Now what do you see? 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:01.940
 It is a U-shaped now 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.380
 Do not you see? 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:04.300
 I broke up with you! 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.100
 You must be famous in Twitter 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.260
 Because of the many followers of you huh? 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.120
 I do not have many followers 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:13.540
 So how do you explain 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.020
 All the people I see behind you 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.160
 In fact, I do not want you 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.980
 Take the right side 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:21.720
 Why ? 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.720
 Because I noticed you were not right for me (right) 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.720
 This is what I will leave you (left) 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.680
 Is this hair inside the bottle? 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:32.320
 Yes, it is a part 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:33.820
 Did you water? 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.140
 No we tune 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.060
 We will split! 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.680
 Oooh, I'm tired 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:44.240
 Are you tired? 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.200
 no why ? 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.460
 I mean you're in my mind all day long 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.160
 And it is time to rest 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.000
 Wow ... was done 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.480
 Just place this above you quickly 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.900
 What is this ? Why did the letter E color red? 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.140
 I just want you to know 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.140
 I have passed you 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:05.940
 Our relationship is like a broken mirror 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:07.940
 It is better to leave it so that you do not hurt us 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.060
 And also if I look at it 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.300
 You can see how crazy you are 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:18.780
 Why did you tell me to meet here? 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:19.920
 We do not do Shi? 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.020
 I just want to tell you 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:22.760
 We are not reforming some 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:27.180
 Well what about this hole in the door? 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.020
 I still do not see Xia 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.800
 Do not work it properly 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.400
 Um .. add that your words are true 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.880
 You only have mercy on us 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.880
 See other people? 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.860
 What do you do ? 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.860
 It's obviously not Ante anymore 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.120
 Is it possible for me to ask you a question? _Of course 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.120
 Do you like this movie? 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.120
 I understand you. I know what you want to do 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.620
 What ? 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:53.500
 You will break the disc 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.360
 It says we must separate 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:56.460
 Sweet movement 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:57.740
 What ? I do not just want to see you 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:58.540
 So look up 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.840
 God you? 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.580
 What ? 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.580
 Did all this just to say I want to separate? 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:06.620
 To say a joke? 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:07.340
 no I did not .... 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.340
 If our relationship is trivial to you 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.340
 So you are doing the impossible to say a joke about it 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.340
 If there is nothing to grieve me 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.340
 Because I did not feel it was a real relationship 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.000
 Wait 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.380
 The fact is I do not want to separate 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:20.280
 And... 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.640
 I do not know how to do it 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.900
 So why did you make all these silly jokes about separation? 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.380
 I noticed afterwards 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:26.460
 Separation is never difficult 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:27.400
 Separation is very easy 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.100
 Bound relationships end because they have decided to secede and give up some 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.100
 I know now 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.340
 He ... I'm not ready to give up on this 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.440
 not now 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.020
 If ... 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:39.680
 neither do I 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.040
 Now I'm ready 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:41.640
 What ? 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:42.580
 The device rings
