00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420
 all right 

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:12.889
 hello everyone I hope you are very well 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:16.369
 eating the video we continue in the war 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:18.230
 of clans but let's move on to the day of 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:21.560
 War battle as they want equality 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:24.050
 tell you we're here at 16 seconds 15 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.610
 seconds and we were more or less 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.560
 practicing who will attack whoever 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:30.050
 which is quite important so that 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.280
 attacks are repeated and in case they do not 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.440
 you can make the two stars 

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:38.060
 someone can do it to us though 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:41.240
 We are at 21 start 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:43.900
 good day battle we will see how 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:46.670
 we go here we see the markers to rivas 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.470
 attacks remaining I have the attacks 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:52.690
 because he has not taken anyone out and this 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:56.379
 symbol that is to appear 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:57.610
 I do not know below we see that maybe those two 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:59.440
 values ​​are the attacks 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.360
 ok they are already attacking a partner 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.730
 they are playing highland and I think my 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:06.729
 comrades are attacking they are already 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:09.009
 beginning to attack see how it looks with 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:12.509
 so someone is attacking another person 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:12.509
 is the name of the one who is attacking 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.810
 nothing 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.630
 more things I think those barbarians 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:23.320
 are the two attacks that we can do and 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:25.450
 Nothing is to wait for the results that 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.930
 people are connecting and let's go 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:31.270
 doing more attacks and if we do not achieve 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.940
 the two stars try to make them by 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:36.930
 the little more that is what is done in day 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:39.660
 of battle destroy villages 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.270
 but let's see an attack not the bad thing is 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:44.730
 they have just begun to attack so 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.510
 let's wait a bit to see how 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:51.230
 they go with the attacks 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:55.750
 and they only attacked my partner like that 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:58.860
 I'll be back in a while to see how 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.860
 that we are back 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:05.530
 we go to the day of battle 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.990
 see they have already done quite enough damage 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.509
 to friend 7 they are winning us because 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:13.269
 we have some companies that 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:15.459
 they have very weak areas without 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:17.110
 offending are not weak compared to 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:21.190
 they almost all have above the 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.840
 level 9 of wall that there are 6 of 7 and 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.870
 that is affected when you want to make a 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.239
 100% give you 3 stars and it crashes 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.940
 sum to those of mediaset and also mega 7 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:33.580
 it's a clan that attacks very well they're 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:36.380
 dedicated to assuming drinks always at 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:39.980
 same as us but they 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:42.410
 here we see this war events that 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.720
 we have in the clan and we can see who 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.310
 has won who has defended who won 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.100
 in defense who lost an attack 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.380
 who won in defense of also that 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:54.320
 it would be who lost the attack and we're going to 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:57.410
 see one that if the war is put on another 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:59.120
 map this map looks pretty good 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:02.300
 different than what is the normal game 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:05.410
 to distinguish when you're at war 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:10.130
 see I do not know maybe these are like horns 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:12.290
 since a volcano there is another volcano and 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.570
 It is pretty good and is basically 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.760
 everything that is done in the on the day of 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:18.920
 battle so let's wait for the 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.690
 results to see how we will see it 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.850
 hard enough that we win them are 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:27.320
 attacking very well also I want to see 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:29.660
 that of the war bonus and nothing here already 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:32.020
 I do not have my attacks , I already did my two 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:36.730
 attacks 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:39.610
 the stars and several of the fact 23 in 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:42.430
 end the battle day we will wait for the 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:47.310
 results I hope you liked it and 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:47.310
 see you until the next video bay
