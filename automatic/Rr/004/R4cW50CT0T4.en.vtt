have thought that glass was kind of a

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.279 
have thought that glass was kind of a
dumb<00:00:47.850> thing<00:00:48.149> to<00:00:48.210> put<00:00:48.539> on<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.750> back<00:00:48.870> of<00:00:48.899> a<00:00:49.110> phone

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
and I probably wouldn't have picked it

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.810

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820

but it looks pretty cool and if you're
careful<00:00:54.000> with<00:00:54.300> it<00:00:54.559> it<00:00:55.559> should<00:00:56.039> be<00:00:56.070> fine<00:00:56.399> it

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090

soft<00:01:52.170> touch<00:01:52.409> but<00:01:52.680> it's<00:01:52.799> not<00:01:52.890> super<00:01:53.340> duper

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
soft touch but it's not super duper

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.380 
soft touch but it's not super duper
grippy<00:01:54.149> um<00:01:55.040> so<00:01:56.040> provides<00:01:56.460> a<00:01:56.549> little<00:01:56.759> a<00:01:56.880> pretty

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
grippy um so provides a little a pretty

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.209 
grippy um so provides a little a pretty
good<00:01:57.509> feel<00:01:57.689> but<00:01:57.899> it's<00:01:58.049> not<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.200> grittiest<00:01:58.680> the

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
good feel but it's not the grittiest the

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.859 
good feel but it's not the grittiest the
grippy<00:01:59.610> assaf<00:02:00.060> touch<00:02:00.240> plastic<00:02:00.630> I've<00:02:00.750> ever

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
grippy assaf touch plastic I've ever

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.580 
grippy assaf touch plastic I've ever
felt

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:12.309 

so<00:02:05.130> let's<00:02:05.490> put<00:02:05.609> this<00:02:05.729> on<00:02:09.319> that's<00:02:10.319> it<00:02:10.640> snaps<00:02:11.640> on

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
so let's put this on that's it snaps on

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:17.240 
so let's put this on that's it snaps on
pretty<00:02:13.319> nicely<00:02:14.629> so<00:02:15.629> the<00:02:15.750> case<00:02:15.930> is<00:02:15.989> very<00:02:16.800> slim

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
pretty nicely so the case is very slim

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.540 
pretty nicely so the case is very slim
it<00:02:18.180> doesn't<00:02:18.569> really<00:02:18.930> add<00:02:19.230> much<00:02:19.560> bulk<00:02:20.160> at<00:02:20.340> all

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
it doesn't really add much bulk at all

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.300 
it doesn't really add much bulk at all
to<00:02:21.120> the<00:02:21.239> to<00:02:21.569> the<00:02:21.599> case<00:02:21.870> I<00:02:22.049> mean<00:02:22.200> I<00:02:22.349> really<00:02:22.650> can't

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
to the to the case I mean I really can't

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.890 
to the to the case I mean I really can't
feel<00:02:23.459> much<00:02:23.610> of<00:02:23.730> a<00:02:23.790> difference<00:02:24.120> with<00:02:24.239> it<00:02:24.390> on<00:02:24.540> and

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
feel much of a difference with it on and

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.789 
feel much of a difference with it on and
off<00:02:25.019> versus<00:02:25.500> it<00:02:25.920> being<00:02:25.980> a<00:02:26.430> soft<00:02:26.879> touch<00:02:27.060> plastic

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:27.799 
off versus it being a soft touch plastic

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:33.259 
off versus it being a soft touch plastic
it's<00:02:28.799> very<00:02:29.810> very<00:02:30.810> thin<00:02:31.110> right<00:02:31.319> here<00:02:32.120> you<00:02:33.120> can

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
it's very very thin right here you can

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:35.089 
it's very very thin right here you can
see<00:02:33.420> that<00:02:33.450> there's<00:02:33.750> just<00:02:33.989> not<00:02:34.170> much<00:02:34.230> not<00:02:35.040> much

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099 
see that there's just not much not much

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:39.350 
see that there's just not much not much
bezel<00:02:35.700> there<00:02:35.849> at<00:02:36.000> all<00:02:37.700> from<00:02:38.700> the<00:02:38.819> front<00:02:39.090> the

bezel there at all from the front the

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.069 
bezel there at all from the front the
the<00:02:39.390> four<00:02:40.049> corners<00:02:41.060> actually<00:02:42.060> actually<00:02:42.750> are

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:43.079 
the four corners actually actually are

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:44.930 
the four corners actually actually are
raised<00:02:43.319> a<00:02:43.530> little<00:02:43.739> bit<00:02:43.890> and<00:02:44.099> i'll<00:02:44.670> show<00:02:44.700> you

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
raised a little bit and i'll show you

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.289 
raised a little bit and i'll show you
guys<00:02:45.239> what<00:02:45.720> I'm<00:02:45.840> talking<00:02:46.170> about<00:02:46.970> all<00:02:47.970> right<00:02:48.180> so

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
guys what I'm talking about all right so

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:49.400 
guys what I'm talking about all right so
you<00:02:48.390> can<00:02:48.480> see<00:02:48.569> here<00:02:48.750> what<00:02:48.870> I'm<00:02:48.959> talking<00:02:49.319> about

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
you can see here what I'm talking about

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.170 
you can see here what I'm talking about
when<00:02:49.680> I<00:02:49.709> said<00:02:49.920> the<00:02:50.040> four<00:02:50.250> corners<00:02:50.549> are<00:02:50.760> raised

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
when I said the four corners are raised

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.479 
when I said the four corners are raised
and<00:02:51.420> don't<00:02:51.720> let<00:02:51.810> the<00:02:51.959> screen<00:02:52.230> touch<00:02:52.410> touch<00:02:53.310> the

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
and don't let the screen touch touch the

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:55.430 
and don't let the screen touch touch the
surface<00:02:53.670> when<00:02:54.000> it's<00:02:54.120> facedown<00:02:54.390> so<00:02:55.260> that's

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
surface when it's facedown so that's

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.850 
surface when it's facedown so that's
pretty<00:02:55.680> cool<00:02:57.319> when<00:02:58.319> you<00:02:58.410> look<00:02:58.560> at<00:02:58.650> the<00:02:58.709> phone

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
pretty cool when you look at the phone

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.800 
pretty cool when you look at the phone
from<00:02:58.980> this<00:02:59.129> side<00:02:59.310> to<00:02:59.489> it<00:02:59.519> is<00:02:59.849> protected<00:03:00.150> by<00:03:00.750> the

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
from this side to it is protected by the

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.259 
from this side to it is protected by the
case<00:03:01.230> okay<00:03:03.140> however<00:03:04.140> if<00:03:04.860> the<00:03:05.549> phone<00:03:05.760> hits<00:03:06.060> like

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
case okay however if the phone hits like

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:09.259 
case okay however if the phone hits like
this<00:03:06.569> if<00:03:06.840> you<00:03:06.959> drop<00:03:07.200> it<00:03:07.609> the<00:03:08.609> case<00:03:08.850> is<00:03:09.090> not

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
this if you drop it the case is not

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:11.390 
this if you drop it the case is not
going<00:03:09.630> to<00:03:09.750> protect<00:03:10.139> it<00:03:10.290> at<00:03:10.410> all<00:03:10.560> you<00:03:11.100> can<00:03:11.250> see

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
going to protect it at all you can see

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.190 
going to protect it at all you can see
that<00:03:11.579> it<00:03:11.670> just<00:03:11.910> it's<00:03:12.359> going<00:03:12.450> to<00:03:12.569> hit<00:03:12.660> basically

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
that it just it's going to hit basically

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.319 
that it just it's going to hit basically
directly<00:03:13.620> on<00:03:13.799> the<00:03:14.069> end<00:03:14.220> of<00:03:14.310> the<00:03:14.370> phone<00:03:14.609> the<00:03:15.120> top

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:15.329 
directly on the end of the phone the top

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:17.780 
directly on the end of the phone the top
of<00:03:15.510> the<00:03:15.600> top<00:03:15.750> or<00:03:15.959> the<00:03:16.079> bottom<00:03:16.109> so<00:03:16.609> corners<00:03:17.609> are

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
of the top or the bottom so corners are

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.699 
of the top or the bottom so corners are
good<00:03:18.200> sides<00:03:19.200> are<00:03:19.410> good<00:03:20.209> face<00:03:21.209> is<00:03:21.450> good<00:03:21.690> but<00:03:22.319> the

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
good sides are good face is good but the

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:23.900 
good sides are good face is good but the
tops<00:03:22.889> in<00:03:23.010> the<00:03:23.040> bottom<00:03:23.310> of<00:03:23.400> the<00:03:23.489> phone<00:03:23.639> are

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
tops in the bottom of the phone are

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.309 
tops in the bottom of the phone are
totally<00:03:24.720> exposed<00:03:26.420> it<00:03:27.420> follows<00:03:27.810> the<00:03:27.930> lines<00:03:28.170> of

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319 
totally exposed it follows the lines of

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:29.870 
totally exposed it follows the lines of
the<00:03:28.410> phone<00:03:28.620> really<00:03:29.040> well<00:03:29.250> you<00:03:29.579> can<00:03:29.730> actually

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
the phone really well you can actually

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:35.300 
the phone really well you can actually
see<00:03:30.230> red<00:03:31.230> in<00:03:31.410> here<00:03:32.870> little<00:03:33.870> focus<00:03:34.130> here<00:03:35.130> we<00:03:35.220> go

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
see red in here little focus here we go

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.000 
see red in here little focus here we go
you<00:03:35.700> actually<00:03:36.000> see<00:03:36.180> that<00:03:36.389> this<00:03:36.810> line<00:03:37.109> follows

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
you actually see that this line follows

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.289 
you actually see that this line follows
the<00:03:38.160> same<00:03:38.340> line<00:03:38.579> of<00:03:38.730> the<00:03:38.790> phone<00:03:41.060> you<00:03:42.060> can<00:03:42.180> see

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
the same line of the phone you can see

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:45.080 
the same line of the phone you can see
right<00:03:42.329> there<00:03:42.660> so<00:03:43.349> this<00:03:43.799> this<00:03:44.099> follows<00:03:44.519> it<00:03:44.700> like

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
right there so this this follows it like

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:46.940 
right there so this this follows it like
directly<00:03:45.780> it<00:03:45.870> so<00:03:45.989> it's<00:03:46.230> pretty<00:03:46.380> pretty<00:03:46.709> cool

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
directly it so it's pretty pretty cool

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.520 
directly it so it's pretty pretty cool
and<00:03:47.130> also<00:03:47.760> one<00:03:47.940> thing<00:03:48.030> I<00:03:48.150> really<00:03:48.480> like<00:03:48.690> I<00:03:48.930> found

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
and also one thing I really like I found

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.409 
and also one thing I really like I found
on<00:03:49.650> the<00:03:49.709> nexus<00:03:50.010> 4<00:03:50.280> that<00:03:50.459> the<00:03:50.730> that<00:03:51.239> these

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:51.419 
on the nexus 4 that the that these

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:54.440 
on the nexus 4 that the that these
buttons<00:03:51.829> particularly<00:03:52.829> particularly<00:03:53.730> the

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
buttons particularly particularly the

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.559 
buttons particularly particularly the
the<00:03:55.049> power<00:03:55.230> button<00:03:55.500> was<00:03:56.040> kind<00:03:56.310> of<00:03:56.340> hard<00:03:56.609> to<00:03:56.730> to

00:03:57.559 --> 00:03:57.569 
the power button was kind of hard to to

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:59.390 
the power button was kind of hard to to
hit<00:03:57.720> sometimes<00:03:58.079> I<00:03:58.169> would<00:03:58.290> just<00:03:58.410> end<00:03:58.590> up<00:03:58.709> it's

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
hit sometimes I would just end up it's

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.520 
hit sometimes I would just end up it's
not<00:03:59.489> raised<00:03:59.730> very<00:03:59.910> much<00:04:00.090> I<00:04:00.239> would<00:04:00.389> end<00:04:00.599> up<00:04:00.750> not

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
not raised very much I would end up not

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.170 
not raised very much I would end up not
feeling<00:04:01.889> it<00:04:02.190> with<00:04:02.400> my<00:04:02.549> finger<00:04:02.819> and<00:04:02.910> hitting

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
feeling it with my finger and hitting

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:04.670 
feeling it with my finger and hitting
down<00:04:03.359> here<00:04:03.690> or<00:04:03.840> up<00:04:03.870> here<00:04:03.989> or<00:04:04.349> something<00:04:04.590> like

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
down here or up here or something like

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.180 
down here or up here or something like
that<00:04:04.739> but<00:04:05.250> this<00:04:05.430> it's<00:04:06.000> it's<00:04:06.359> got<00:04:06.510> a<00:04:06.540> nice

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
that but this it's it's got a nice

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:10.430 
that but this it's it's got a nice
beveled<00:04:08.190> edge<00:04:08.540> where<00:04:09.540> these<00:04:09.660> are<00:04:09.810> cut<00:04:09.989> out<00:04:10.019> and

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
beveled edge where these are cut out and

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.110 
beveled edge where these are cut out and
so<00:04:10.919> it<00:04:11.069> really<00:04:11.099> makes<00:04:11.400> it<00:04:11.760> a<00:04:11.880> smooth

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120

thing I was a little concerned about
about<00:04:39.210> a<00:04:39.240> case<00:04:39.449> was<00:04:39.690> was<00:04:40.349> the<00:04:40.620> sides<00:04:40.830> being

00:04:41.059 --> 00:04:41.069 
about a case was was the sides being

00:04:41.069 --> 00:04:42.680 
about a case was was the sides being
raised<00:04:41.340> too<00:04:41.550> much<00:04:41.729> and<00:04:42.000> making<00:04:42.569> those

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
raised too much and making those

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:44.059 
raised too much and making those
gestures<00:04:42.960> hard<00:04:43.289> to<00:04:43.379> get<00:04:43.530> because<00:04:43.590> sometimes

00:04:44.059 --> 00:04:44.069 
gestures hard to get because sometimes

00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:46.279 
gestures hard to get because sometimes
some<00:04:44.370> cases<00:04:44.669> are<00:04:44.789> like<00:04:44.909> that<00:04:45.090> this<00:04:45.870> is<00:04:46.020> not<00:04:46.139> an

00:04:46.279 --> 00:04:46.289 
some cases are like that this is not an

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:49.460 
some cases are like that this is not an
issue<00:04:46.379> with<00:04:46.680> this<00:04:46.860> it's<00:04:47.490> it's<00:04:47.879> very<00:04:48.349> very<00:04:49.349> easy

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:20.940 
little bit I don't really think that

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:22.730

that's<00:05:21.030> a<00:05:21.360> big<00:05:21.569> deal<00:05:21.780> it's<00:05:22.199> probably<00:05:22.440> pretty

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:22.740 
that's a big deal it's probably pretty

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:24.529 
that's a big deal it's probably pretty

unavoidable with a case this slim
because<00:05:24.750> there's<00:05:24.930> only<00:05:24.990> so<00:05:25.319> it's<00:05:25.590> only<00:05:25.770> so

00:05:25.999 --> 00:05:26.009 
because there's only so it's only so

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:28.670 
because there's only so it's only so
hard<00:05:26.219> that<00:05:26.370> you<00:05:26.490> can<00:05:26.610> make<00:05:26.789> plastic<00:05:27.630> you<00:05:28.590> know

hard that you can make plastic you know
before<00:05:28.979> it<00:05:29.039> gets<00:05:29.190> to<00:05:29.340> a<00:05:29.370> point<00:05:29.430> where<00:05:29.639> it's

00:05:29.809 --> 00:05:29.819 
before it gets to a point where it's

00:05:29.819 --> 00:05:32.839 
before it gets to a point where it's
going<00:05:29.969> to<00:05:30.029> be<00:05:30.150> too<00:05:30.990> rigid<00:05:31.710> and<00:05:31.919> just<00:05:32.460> shatter

00:05:32.839 --> 00:05:32.849 
going to be too rigid and just shatter

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:34.519 
going to be too rigid and just shatter
so<00:05:33.180> it's<00:05:33.300> probably<00:05:33.479> a<00:05:33.630> nice<00:05:33.810> I'm<00:05:34.259> sure<00:05:34.380> it's<00:05:34.500> a

00:05:34.519 --> 00:05:34.529 
so it's probably a nice I'm sure it's a

00:05:34.529 --> 00:05:36.559 
so it's probably a nice I'm sure it's a
nice<00:05:34.650> compromise<00:05:34.949> but<00:05:35.340> you<00:05:35.460> can<00:05:35.639> you<00:05:35.969> can<00:05:36.180> feel

00:05:36.559 --> 00:05:36.569 
nice compromise but you can you can feel

00:05:36.569 --> 00:05:38.749 
nice compromise but you can you can feel
you<00:05:37.199> can<00:05:37.349> feel<00:05:37.590> the<00:05:37.710> throne<00:05:37.919> kind<00:05:38.250> of<00:05:38.310> kind<00:05:38.639> of

00:05:38.749 --> 00:05:38.759 
you can feel the throne kind of kind of

00:05:38.759 --> 00:05:40.070 
you can feel the throne kind of kind of
Creek<00:05:39.090> a<00:05:39.210> little<00:05:39.419> bit<00:05:39.539> when<00:05:39.690> you<00:05:39.779> when<00:05:40.050> you

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 
Creek a little bit when you when you

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:43.490 
Creek a little bit when you when you
squeeze<00:05:40.590> it<00:05:41.449> another<00:05:42.449> thing<00:05:42.659> that's<00:05:42.810> so<00:05:42.990> so<00:05:43.229> is

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:43.500 
squeeze it another thing that's so so is

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:47.029 
squeeze it another thing that's so so is
the<00:05:44.130> plastic<00:05:45.110> it's<00:05:46.110> not<00:05:46.319> the<00:05:46.469> grippy<00:05:46.740> a<00:05:46.770> soft

it's decent and it actually it's kind of

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:52.459 
it's decent and it actually it's kind of
nice<00:05:51.150> because<00:05:51.360> it<00:05:51.569> doesn't<00:05:51.840> get<00:05:52.050> stuck<00:05:52.319> in

00:05:52.459 --> 00:05:52.469 
nice because it doesn't get stuck in

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:53.839 
nice because it doesn't get stuck in
your<00:05:52.500> pocket<00:05:52.919> pulling<00:05:53.279> it<00:05:53.370> out<00:05:53.400> anything<00:05:53.699> like

case and I feel like this should be left

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:29.300 
case and I feel like this should be left
off<00:06:27.000> the<00:06:27.139> main<00:06:28.139> thing<00:06:28.409> is<00:06:28.440> is<00:06:28.680> that<00:06:28.800> it<00:06:28.949> it

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:29.310 
off the main thing is is that it it

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:32.060 
off the main thing is is that it it
actually<00:06:29.960> it<00:06:30.960> actually<00:06:31.289> sticks<00:06:31.529> out<00:06:31.710> a<00:06:31.740> little

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:32.070 
actually it actually sticks out a little

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:34.190 
actually it actually sticks out a little
it<00:06:32.190> and<00:06:32.340> that's<00:06:32.820> right<00:06:33.030> we're<00:06:33.210> right<00:06:34.050> where

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:34.200 
it and that's right we're right where

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:36.680 
it and that's right we're right where
your<00:06:34.320> your<00:06:34.830> hand<00:06:35.130> is<00:06:35.400> is<00:06:35.730> grabbing<00:06:36.240> in<00:06:36.480> so<00:06:36.630> you

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:36.690 
your your hand is is grabbing in so you

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:38.090 
your your hand is is grabbing in so you
can<00:06:37.110> actually<00:06:37.230> feel<00:06:37.470> in<00:06:37.620> your<00:06:37.680> hand<00:06:37.800> it's<00:06:37.980> not

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:38.100 
can actually feel in your hand it's not

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:39.890 
can actually feel in your hand it's not
super<00:06:38.370> uncomfortable<00:06:38.550> but<00:06:39.150> it's<00:06:39.390> a<00:06:39.750> little

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:39.900 
super uncomfortable but it's a little

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:43.900 
super uncomfortable but it's a little
annoying<00:06:40.200> and<00:06:40.580> I<00:06:41.580> would<00:06:42.060> have<00:06:42.180> left<00:06:42.300> that<00:06:42.480> off

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:43.910 
annoying and I would have left that off

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:46.730 
annoying and I would have left that off
so<00:06:44.910> in<00:06:45.300> conclusion<00:06:45.540> the<00:06:46.020> REE<00:06:46.140> are<00:06:46.290> three<00:06:46.560> key

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:46.740 
so in conclusion the REE are three key

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:49.640 
so in conclusion the REE are three key

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:01.950 
corners of the phone are raised and it

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:03.650 
corners of the phone are raised and it
protects<00:07:02.310> the<00:07:02.430> phone<00:07:02.610> from<00:07:02.820> resting<00:07:03.210> on<00:07:03.420> the

screen when you have it faced down and
it's<00:07:05.850> also<00:07:06.000> still<00:07:06.720> easy<00:07:07.110> enough<00:07:07.410> to<00:07:07.440> do<00:07:07.800> the

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:08.130 
it's also still easy enough to do the

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:10.310 
it's also still easy enough to do the
edge<00:07:08.340> to<00:07:08.580> edge<00:07:08.700> swipes<00:07:09.240> because<00:07:09.780> the<00:07:09.960> lip<00:07:10.140> is

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:10.320 
edge to edge swipes because the lip is
