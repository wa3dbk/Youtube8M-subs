resources open up the first app you
controller<00:01:05.780> while<00:01:06.020> that<00:01:06.200> thing's<00:01:06.229> open<00:01:07.000> do<00:01:08.000> a

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
controller while that thing's open do a

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.920 
controller while that thing's open do a
little<00:01:08.270> bit<00:01:08.420> of<00:01:08.450> coding<00:01:08.750> here<00:01:10.690> to<00:01:11.690> an<00:01:11.810> odd

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
little bit of coding here to an odd
