00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.070
 Well the truth is that started by 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.720
 miranda kerr because I love it and I 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.630

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.580
 copy and good the gorgeous girls and 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.920
 I had to do like five times to 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.380

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.410
 with what I have with what God has 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.480
 given then I tried to do a little 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.899
 offputting to some starting their looks 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.120
 by the hair the makeup and four looks 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.309

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.489
 luminous pulling to natural good this is 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:53.930

 I'm going to do a natural makeup and 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.900
 bright as she leads and they start 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:10.120
 hydrating well skin and lips 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.340
 with a baby clean we get look 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:14.170
 of good face after the test I put on 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.140
 a long-lasting cream shade of 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.390
 a golden tone 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:22.280
 with a shadow old gold I will give color 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.280
 to the outer two thirds of the eye 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.829
 and with a darker metallic brown of 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.409
 depth of the external ub I use a 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.719
 topo to blur the cuts and a tone 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.020
 golden for the innermost third of the 

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:39.020
 eye 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.420
 we apply grade to the most expensive water line 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.280
 and my eyes are ready I put on a 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.319
 bronzer with golden tones by way of 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.939
 contour of rouge giving a tone 

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:53.039
 golden brown to light the areas 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.109
 keys of the face and to finish I put 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:56.939
 the manzanitas a pink blusher with 

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:58.530
 flashes in gold all products 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.689
 that you have used the in the box 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.390
 of information in the hair just me 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:06.380
 made curls backwards separating the 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.380
 hair a little bit of the face 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.930
 this first look is the most casual look 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.730
 of all and it is very easy to copy is 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.860
 made entirely with basic the 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.780
 details like the hat the booties 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.160
 the red lips and the shirt totally 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.150
 buttoned is what makes the difference 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.150
 in this look 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:38.569
 in her 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.640
 and she 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.000
 It is also a casual look but with 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.129
 heels as you see composed of basic 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:54.250
 the touch of shoes and glasses 

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:54.250
 that the ones she uses are in qatar court 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:18.319
 he mentioned 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:20.870
 here we can see a way to fix 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:23.020
 a super normal look like a skirt 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.459
 of ning and a white shirt with 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:28.480
 just a pair of high boots and a blazer 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:28.480
 and a low bow 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:37.110
 and 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:46.670
 and finally the most formal look of 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:49.310
 all in which all the 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:51.980
 protagonism to the dress that already speaks by 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:54.020
 Yes alone and be dressed, talk to you more 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.820
