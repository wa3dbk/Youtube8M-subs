00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.580
 I think it is quite obvious if 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.700
 you grew up with the same music 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:48.070
 and constantly dealing with that one 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:51.760
 These texts are always over again 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:55.170
 and think about it and also 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.170
 musically thinking about it 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:02.590
 It started with the last part with the 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:05.350
 share and the oldest Agnes de 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:08.290
 It's already ten years old but as soon as it is 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.880
 the agnus de gab was clear that it too 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:13.470
 the other fair parts could give 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.470
 maybe there should be more 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:28.770
 the great uncertainty of a still young 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.869
 composer as a composer I am after 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.929
 my feeling much younger than early 40 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:37.229
 and of course you ask yourself sounds that 

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:39.750
 instrumentation brings well at all 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.869
 she agrees with that of herself 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.520
 dynamics of the colors less the question 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.119
 if that is handled well I had 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.119
 never doubt 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:38.050
 but always the given pieces 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:40.000
 tries to transpose to transpose 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:42.240
 in other styles too 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.740
 also carry a lot of replay 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:50.000
 and I think that's nothing special 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:52.180
 talent it is only about it 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.180
 that you start in time to 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.180
 improvise 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.959
 Yes 

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:30.690
 b 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:45.819
 on our autumn trip with the 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.920
 Leipzig University Choir in Hollywood 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:49.900
 There was a student service there 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.010
 the catholic student church we 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.530
 have within this worship 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:56.010
 the whole parts of the whole jazz fair 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.010
 listed 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:48.620
 i think i did during the 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:52.729
 Production on during the concerts 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:55.669
 not really enjoyed breathing 

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:58.900
 but that's my piece and we do 

00:04:55.669 --> 00:05:02.210
 now a big thing together 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:05.210
 but I felt that before 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:07.550
 then has subliminal and now 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:10.389
 in hindsight, of course, very much 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:10.389
 as great gratitude
