00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:06.859
 hello i am mark drinking house 

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:09.050
 sounddesigner from 55 end of the line 

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:11.360
 we are in my studio today 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:14.000
 and I would like to show you how the 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:17.650
 Ambiance from the u 55 and the bien 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.870
 oral beats have arisen in the game 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:23.090
 for the ambiance of the u55 line 

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:26.330
 we decided on the original one 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:28.850
 Sound and as a basis for the game 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:31.580
 The stop Bundestag record 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:34.249
 because this station has a 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:36.950
 very unique below striking 

00:00:34.249 --> 00:00:41.620
 ventilation scroll 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:41.620
 sometimes inexplicable 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.940
 during the recordings, I then get up 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.240
 concentrated on different points 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:28.390
 best possible version of 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:30.649
 55 in the game to generate back in the studio 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.630
 edited and the sounds and look 

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:35.780
 me the frequency spectrum over 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:38.659
 analyze program to see which one 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:41.539
 Frequency in the ambiance so dominant 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:43.640
 because on this frequency we want 

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:46.219
 our been oral beats in the game 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:50.240
 integrate so that the player you 

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:51.829
 subconsciously, and here 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.590
 Let's see the big pick 

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:58.849
 analysis program and that is located 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:02.390
 at 277 what a heart in the music world 

00:01:58.849 --> 00:02:04.869
 cis means we come to the blue whales 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.610
 beats the short explanation one 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:09.319
 Acoustic deception is through and 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.500
 our brain is born 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:14.959
 It is important that both tones 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.540
 are acoustically separated from each other and 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:20.060
 this is best done with headphones 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.340
 because speakers can be the 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:25.090
 mix signals and thus their 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.090
 lose effect 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.989
 Here is a short example in the 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:35.520
 audio engine fj if i have a frequency 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:39.330
 from 287 heart only I would have and 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:42.900
 a frequency of 267 on the right 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:46.500
 ear our brain generates a frequency 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:48.330
 from 277 heart and is considered one 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.269
 perceived pulsating sound 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:54.840
 So I have a difference of 20 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:56.970
 hertz at these 20 hertz we are 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.610
 us at the peter choose the the 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:02.489
 promote concentration and wake us up 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:06.239
 as it is also the frequency 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:08.850
 during the day we have about our brain and 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:11.370
 Here's a little overview of what the 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.100
 different frequencies for states 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:16.049
 can trigger with us 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:18.900
 I have these different states 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:25.049
 also integrated in fj and we'll listen 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:27.980
 in all pure and go play it 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:27.980
 feels safe 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:40.069
 call player 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.390
 exploring players 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.760
 The player is sneaking 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.480
 player in hiding 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.040
 players in the fight 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:21.690
 under player has panic 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:35.580
 to the blue whale beats I have too 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.830
 in addition, a few other effects 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:40.100
 I'll play you shortly before 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.100
 would like to 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:46.980
 This is the seasick effect of 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:51.080
 occurs when the player is strong 

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:51.080
 is struck after a fight 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:01.700
 Now we hear the sound of 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:06.340
 the heartbeat is played when the 

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:06.340
 player has little energy or fear 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:20.350
 then we have the heart at 34 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:20.350
 subliminal danger mediated 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:32.509
 followed by the deep near 69 heart 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:35.110
 or the next danger for the player 

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:35.110
 guest appearance 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:47.150
 and finally the headache tone 

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:49.509
 or tinnitus called at one 

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:52.660
 direct confrontation with a monster 

00:05:49.509 --> 00:05:52.660
 is triggered 

00:05:54.039 --> 00:05:59.270
 So now I play you all together 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:01.660
 how it happens in the game 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:01.660
 could 

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:33.050
 if you want more about the oral beats 

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:36.340
 then you just want to click 

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:36.340
 the longest in the video 

00:07:38.249 --> 00:07:43.319
 so i hope that little insight into 

00:07:40.499 --> 00:07:48.259
 the sound design of u55 pleased you 

00:07:43.319 --> 00:07:48.259
 and we heard each other in the game
