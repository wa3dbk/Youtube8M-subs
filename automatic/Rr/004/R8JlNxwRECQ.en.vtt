00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.600
 to have done is a sin you 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.580
 not consciously commits a sin nevertheless 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.830
 many are asking this question right now 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.389
 devout muslims in germany because out 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.620
 For religious reasons they are allowed to 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.450
 do not eat pork 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.550
 but now you have in the course of the current 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.039
 meat scandals pork in the 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.289
 found doner and so have many 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.180
 Muslims eaten with the doner kebab 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.380
 without wanting it and accordingly 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:31.529
 big is now the uncertainty 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:35.610
 meat from the beef pig or even 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:37.200
 returns united in tones loose and 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.440
 bite carefree 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.559
 that was once it is terrifying 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.590
 that industry is as creative as that 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.190
 is money making that's the number 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.600
 four 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.610
 I do not know how she got along with that 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:55.970
 certain then stops selling the can 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:58.320
 and totally trust bad 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.660
 while boehner is even a protected 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.830
 Denomination may only rind or lamb 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.680
 be meat in it 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:06.480
 everything else is roast or barbecue skewers 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.480
 a fine but important difference 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:13.430
 So eating pork is forbidden 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.430
 the islam horse meat is frowned upon 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.140
 when finished dishes's Muslims is not 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.090
 better than other believers also in 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.400
 The quality seal is the information 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.970
 rather confusing than helpful 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:29.400
 Certificate is the halal seal that should 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.960
 confirm that the content of islam 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.540
 is allowed and the product is not 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:39.110
 pork contains but there are 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:49.259
 almost 100 different halal seals do not 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:53.180
 because I do not think we have 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:57.320
 really big and germany meat 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:59.940
 Pork is not good for me 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:02.340
 clear specifications are required for 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.990
 In any case Halal plans that 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.420
 Central Council of Muslims 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:10.490
 We should have this scandal and this 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:12.300
 news use that a rethink 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.440
 also takes place in Muslim 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.440
 Consumers also in the Muslim 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:19.140
 that we are radical as well 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.569
 draw conclusions that means 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.830
 the whole certification that's what 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:25.260
 Halal is for example the 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:28.180
 meat products that that we that 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:31.160
 subject to a uniform standard 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.720
 here halal is strictly applied and that 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.220
 could be a role model for a future 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.230
 his certification 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.270
 by the way, this Turkish company will 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.160
 from the German veterinary office as well 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:42.350
 strictly controlled like any other 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:48.500
 but that alone is not enough for this 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:51.620
 halal seal certified so the at 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:54.500
 Everyone slaughtering him on the spot 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.440
 they just like our slaughter 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.959
 We through our own staff 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:02.300
 perform strictly controlled 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:04.550
 Guidelines so that's why you get that 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:08.080
 doner not too little quality has 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:10.850
 their price means the professional so a 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:13.130
 doner bag so seen with a 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:15.190
 reasonable meat and meat percentage 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:19.780
 should cost at least three euros 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.780
 the consumers could pay attention to that
