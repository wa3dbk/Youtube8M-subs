say probably must haves on your phone
the<00:01:14.310> first<00:01:14.549> one<00:01:14.700> is<00:01:14.790> called<00:01:14.909> advanced<00:01:15.479> task

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
the first one is called advanced task

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.289 
the first one is called advanced task
killer<00:01:15.869> and<00:01:16.409> what<00:01:17.310> this<00:01:17.460> basically<00:01:17.610> does<00:01:18.090> is

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
killer and what this basically does is

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.140 
killer and what this basically does is
it<00:01:18.390> finds<00:01:18.770> your<00:01:19.770> apps<00:01:20.250> that<00:01:20.729> are<00:01:20.820> running<00:01:21.060> in

it finds your apps that are running in
the<00:01:21.240> background<00:01:21.270> that<00:01:21.930> maybe<00:01:22.350> you<00:01:22.560> don't<00:01:22.740> need

defender<00:01:43.100> basically<00:01:44.100> what<00:01:44.280> this<00:01:44.460> does<00:01:44.520> is

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
defender basically what this does is

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.969 
defender basically what this does is
obviously<00:01:46.110> with<00:01:46.259> your<00:01:46.380> smart<00:01:46.619> phone<00:01:46.770> you<00:01:46.890> have

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
obviously with your smart phone you have

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.889 
obviously with your smart phone you have
a<00:01:47.009> data<00:01:47.250> coverage<00:01:47.700> you<00:01:47.820> know<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.180> 3G<00:01:48.540> plan<00:01:48.780> and

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
a data coverage you know the 3G plan and

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.050 
a data coverage you know the 3G plan and
everything<00:01:49.079> what<00:01:49.860> this<00:01:50.040> does<00:01:50.280> is<00:01:50.549> it<00:01:50.729> sets

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
everything what this does is it sets

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.780 
everything what this does is it sets
your<00:01:51.509> 3G<00:01:52.200> data<00:01:52.380> coverage<00:01:52.829> to<00:01:53.009> come<00:01:53.280> on<00:01:53.430> during

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
your 3G data coverage to come on during

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.090 
your 3G data coverage to come on during
an<00:01:53.880> interval<00:01:54.270> so<00:01:54.810> when<00:01:54.930> your<00:01:55.079> phone<00:01:55.470> is<00:01:55.829> turned

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
an interval so when your phone is turned

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.190 
an interval so when your phone is turned
off<00:01:56.340> it's<00:01:57.180> going<00:01:57.360> to<00:01:57.420> turn<00:01:57.630> off<00:01:57.780> your<00:01:57.930> 3G

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
off it's going to turn off your 3G

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.139 
off it's going to turn off your 3G
coverage<00:01:58.500> as<00:01:58.799> well<00:01:59.009> but<00:01:59.729> what's<00:01:59.880> nice<00:02:00.119> about

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
coverage as well but what's nice about

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.910 
coverage as well but what's nice about
is<00:02:00.540> if<00:02:00.630> you're<00:02:00.780> not<00:02:00.810> using<00:02:00.930> your<00:02:01.229> phone<00:02:01.530> for

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
is if you're not using your phone for

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.800 
is if you're not using your phone for
you<00:02:02.159> know<00:02:02.280> let's<00:02:02.460> say<00:02:02.610> 15<00:02:03.090> 30<00:02:03.390> minutes<00:02:03.540> at<00:02:03.780> a

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
you know let's say 15 30 minutes at a

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:04.399 
you know let's say 15 30 minutes at a
time

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
time

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.950 
time
you<00:02:04.680> can<00:02:04.890> set<00:02:05.159> this<00:02:05.399> program<00:02:06.119> up<00:02:06.420> in<00:02:06.659> an

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
you can set this program up in an

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.469 
you can set this program up in an
interval<00:02:07.380> and<00:02:07.829> what<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.580> interval<00:02:08.970> does<00:02:09.209> is

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
interval and what the interval does is

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.770 
interval and what the interval does is
it<00:02:10.470> allows<00:02:10.890> you<00:02:11.370> to<00:02:11.670> update<00:02:12.120> or<00:02:12.660> I'll

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
it allows you to update or I'll

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.180 
it allows you to update or I'll
automatically<00:02:13.319> turn<00:02:13.680> on

automatically turn on

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.740 
automatically turn on
your<00:02:14.940> 3G<00:02:15.840> coverage<00:02:16.050> or<00:02:16.440> a<00:02:16.470> data<00:02:16.740> package<00:02:17.750> while

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
your 3G coverage or a data package while

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.380 
your 3G coverage or a data package while
your<00:02:18.900> phone<00:02:19.050> is<00:02:19.110> in<00:02:19.470> sleep<00:02:20.310> mode<00:02:20.550> and<00:02:20.790> it'll

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
your phone is in sleep mode and it'll

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.600 
your phone is in sleep mode and it'll
allow<00:02:21.480> it<00:02:21.780> to<00:02:21.930> sync<00:02:22.320> up<00:02:22.500> the<00:02:22.740> weather<00:02:23.070> your

coverage isn't on 24/7 while you're you

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.120 
coverage isn't on 24/7 while you're you
know<00:02:30.840> you're<00:02:31.290> using<00:02:31.500> your<00:02:31.710> phone<00:02:31.740> throughout

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
know you're using your phone throughout

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.440 
know you're using your phone throughout
the<00:02:32.250> day<00:02:32.400> because<00:02:32.490> you<00:02:32.610> don't<00:02:32.880> really<00:02:33.120> need

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
the day because you don't really need

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.770 
the day because you don't really need
your<00:02:34.020> data<00:02:34.290> package<00:02:34.740> the<00:02:35.280> whole<00:02:35.580> time<00:02:35.910> and

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
your data package the whole time and

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.660 
your data package the whole time and
then<00:02:36.900> you<00:02:37.020> can<00:02:37.140> also<00:02:37.320> set<00:02:37.740> it<00:02:37.770> to<00:02:38.040> as<00:02:38.370> soon<00:02:38.580> as

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
then you can also set it to as soon as

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.790 
then you can also set it to as soon as
you<00:02:38.760> turn<00:02:38.970> your<00:02:39.120> phone<00:02:39.330> on<00:02:39.800> it'll

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
you turn your phone on it'll

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.560 
you turn your phone on it'll
automatically<00:02:41.280> turn<00:02:41.520> your<00:02:41.670> 3G<00:02:41.910> back<00:02:42.180> on<00:02:42.390> so

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
automatically turn your 3G back on so

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.240 
automatically turn your 3G back on so
basically<00:02:42.960> what<00:02:43.380> it<00:02:43.500> does<00:02:43.530> is<00:02:43.830> while<00:02:44.070> your

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
basically what it does is while your

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.340 
basically what it does is while your
phone's<00:02:44.490> turned<00:02:44.700> off<00:02:44.940> it<00:02:45.390> turns<00:02:45.690> your<00:02:45.900> 3G

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
phone's turned off it turns your 3G

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.290 
phone's turned off it turns your 3G
coverage<00:02:46.560> off<00:02:46.890> as<00:02:47.100> well<00:02:47.280> and<00:02:47.580> this

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
coverage off as well and this

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.600 
coverage off as well and this
significantly<00:02:49.160> increases<00:02:50.160> your<00:02:50.280> battery

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
significantly increases your battery

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.630 
significantly increases your battery
life<00:02:50.760> and<00:02:51.560> it<00:02:52.560> also<00:02:52.770> comes<00:02:53.220> with<00:02:53.310> these<00:02:53.580> two

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
life and it also comes with these two

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.000 
life and it also comes with these two
apps<00:02:54.030> that<00:02:54.270> you<00:02:54.360> can<00:02:54.390> see<00:02:54.660> on<00:02:54.780> the<00:02:54.870> bottom<00:02:55.050> the

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
apps that you can see on the bottom the

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.490 
apps that you can see on the bottom the
first<00:02:56.250> one<00:02:56.430> that<00:02:56.520> I'm<00:02:56.640> pointing<00:02:56.850> to<00:02:57.000> is<00:02:57.500> a

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
first one that I'm pointing to is a

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.710 
first one that I'm pointing to is a
widget<00:02:58.980> that<00:02:59.460> shows<00:02:59.520> you<00:03:00.030> how<00:03:00.270> much<00:03:00.300> better

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
widget that shows you how much better

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.930 
widget that shows you how much better
you're<00:03:00.960> actually<00:03:01.380> increasing<00:03:02.040> by<00:03:02.550> using<00:03:02.850> this

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
you're actually increasing by using this

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.880 
you're actually increasing by using this
and<00:03:03.210> it's<00:03:03.300> up<00:03:03.420> to<00:03:03.540> one<00:03:04.230> point<00:03:04.500> eight<00:03:04.680> five

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
and it's up to one point eight five

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.700 
and it's up to one point eight five
times<00:03:05.310> so<00:03:05.700> just<00:03:05.910> with<00:03:06.030> this<00:03:06.120> app<00:03:06.330> alone

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:07.710 
times so just with this app alone

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:09.770 
times so just with this app alone
it's<00:03:08.130> almost<00:03:08.310> doubling<00:03:08.790> my<00:03:08.940> battery<00:03:09.270> life<00:03:09.450> by

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
it's almost doubling my battery life by

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.710 
it's almost doubling my battery life by
turning<00:03:09.840> off<00:03:10.320> the<00:03:10.820> 3G<00:03:11.820> coverage<00:03:12.000> and<00:03:12.390> then<00:03:12.510> the

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
turning off the 3G coverage and then the

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.610 
turning off the 3G coverage and then the
second<00:03:13.050> thing<00:03:13.200> is<00:03:13.500> a<00:03:13.950> on<00:03:14.280> and<00:03:14.490> off<00:03:15.140> APN<00:03:16.140> button

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
second thing is a on and off APN button

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.520 
second thing is a on and off APN button
and<00:03:16.830> your<00:03:17.430> APN<00:03:17.820> is<00:03:17.970> just<00:03:18.180> another<00:03:18.780> form<00:03:19.080> of

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
and your APN is just another form of

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.280 
and your APN is just another form of
year<00:03:20.010> 3G<00:03:20.430> coverage<00:03:20.660> so<00:03:21.660> I<00:03:21.720> hope<00:03:21.870> this<00:03:22.050> helped<00:03:22.230> a

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
year 3G coverage so I hope this helped a

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.050 
year 3G coverage so I hope this helped a
lot<00:03:22.350> of<00:03:22.410> people<00:03:22.560> feel<00:03:23.040> free<00:03:23.310> if<00:03:23.670> you<00:03:23.730> has<00:03:23.970> any
