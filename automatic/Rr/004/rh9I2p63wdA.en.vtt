00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.880 
picture just going to look at look at it
now<00:00:59.480> there's<00:00:59.719> few<00:00:59.929> possibilities<00:01:00.289> this<00:01:00.710> could

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890 
now there's few possibilities this could

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:02.619 
now there's few possibilities this could
be<00:01:00.980> the<00:01:01.100> pause<00:01:01.309> menu<00:01:01.579> while<00:01:01.940> you're<00:01:02.179> in<00:01:02.329> game

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:02.629 
be the pause menu while you're in game

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:05.920 
be the pause menu while you're in game
or<00:01:03.070> it<00:01:04.070> could<00:01:04.400> be<00:01:04.430> the<00:01:04.580> loading<00:01:05.030> screen<00:01:05.059> now<00:01:05.870> we

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
or it could be the loading screen now we

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.100 
or it could be the loading screen now we
see<00:01:06.470> a<00:01:06.740> text<00:01:07.130> in<00:01:07.370> the<00:01:07.460> text<00:01:07.850> up<00:01:07.970> front<00:01:08.210> text<00:01:09.020> at

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
see a text in the text up front text at

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.740 
see a text in the text up front text at
the<00:01:09.140> top<00:01:09.350> top<00:01:09.860> left<00:01:10.159> and<00:01:10.370> then<00:01:11.060> it<00:01:11.360> looks<00:01:11.659> like

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:11.750 
the top top left and then it looks like

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.179 
the top top left and then it looks like
one<00:01:12.229> two<00:01:12.439> three<00:01:12.860> four<00:01:13.570> possible<00:01:15.189> selections

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:16.189 
one two three four possible selections

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:20.380 
one two three four possible selections
so<00:01:17.060> I'm<00:01:17.659> guessing<00:01:18.439> maybe<00:01:18.979> one<00:01:19.369> could<00:01:19.610> be<00:01:19.759> xbox

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
so I'm guessing maybe one could be xbox

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.359 
so I'm guessing maybe one could be xbox
live<00:01:21.100> another<00:01:22.100> private<00:01:23.259> settings<00:01:24.259> and<00:01:24.710> I

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 
live another private settings and I

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:27.280 
live another private settings and I
don't<00:01:25.610> know<00:01:25.700> what<00:01:25.850> maybe<00:01:26.000> men<00:01:26.299> main<00:01:26.600> menu<00:01:27.049> if

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 
don't know what maybe men main menu if

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.410 
don't know what maybe men main menu if
this<00:01:27.829> is<00:01:28.009> indeed<00:01:28.159> the<00:01:28.340> loading<00:01:28.820> like<00:01:29.030> a<00:01:29.060> main

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
this is indeed the loading like a main

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.289 
this is indeed the loading like a main
if<00:01:29.600> this<00:01:29.810> is<00:01:29.990> or<00:01:30.110> actually<00:01:30.939> sorry<00:01:31.939> I'm<00:01:32.149> going

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:32.299 
if this is or actually sorry I'm going

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:34.179 
if this is or actually sorry I'm going
back<00:01:32.509> to<00:01:32.540> my<00:01:32.630> word<00:01:32.899> if<00:01:33.110> this<00:01:33.500> is<00:01:33.649> the<00:01:33.770> main<00:01:33.950> menu

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:34.189 
back to my word if this is the main menu

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:35.950 
back to my word if this is the main menu
for<00:01:34.549> that<00:01:34.790> could<00:01:34.969> be<00:01:35.060> the<00:01:35.149> main<00:01:35.329> menu<00:01:35.540> that's

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
for that could be the main menu that's

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.330 
for that could be the main menu that's
one<00:01:36.140> possibility<00:01:36.530> it<00:01:36.799> can<00:01:36.890> also<00:01:37.039> be<00:01:37.159> the

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
one possibility it can also be the

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:38.649 
one possibility it can also be the
loading<00:01:37.670> screen<00:01:37.700> I<00:01:38.030> don't<00:01:38.210> really<00:01:38.299> think<00:01:38.420> it's

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:38.659 
loading screen I don't really think it's

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:40.389 
loading screen I don't really think it's
the<00:01:38.780> loading<00:01:38.990> screen<00:01:39.020> because<00:01:39.649> there's<00:01:40.280> that

00:01:40.389 --> 00:01:40.399 
the loading screen because there's that

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:42.940 
the loading screen because there's that
yellow<00:01:40.640> highlighted<00:01:41.210> thing<00:01:41.560> otherwise<00:01:42.560> that

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
yellow highlighted thing otherwise that

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.260 
yellow highlighted thing otherwise that
I<00:01:43.130> don't<00:01:43.280> know<00:01:43.340> why<00:01:43.460> I'd<00:01:43.579> be<00:01:43.700> highlighted<00:01:44.180> it

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
I don't know why I'd be highlighted it

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.520 
I don't know why I'd be highlighted it
looks<00:01:44.420> like<00:01:44.570> he's<00:01:44.719> concerned<00:01:45.229> his

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
looks like he's concerned his

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.950 
looks like he's concerned his
controllers<00:01:46.130> on<00:01:46.250> something<00:01:46.640> so<00:01:46.850> maybe<00:01:47.689> not

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
controllers on something so maybe not

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.370 
controllers on something so maybe not
the<00:01:48.079> loading<00:01:48.350> screen<00:01:48.380> or<00:01:48.920> maybe<00:01:49.460> it's<00:01:49.850> just

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
the loading screen or maybe it's just

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.840 
the loading screen or maybe it's just

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
but I think it does actually support

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.729
