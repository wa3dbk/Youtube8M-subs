00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.809
 hello friends today I want 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:18.560
 show you 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:21.520
 electric bike liner is a bicycle with 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:24.830
 large wheels 29 inches 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:27.550
 we installed the bike cube 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:31.310
 attention electra head 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:35.540
 the plane and pretty and enough 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:38.600
 powerful motor wheel 350ma 36v is 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:41.290
 inability to accelerate to thirty two 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:46.610
 kilometers per hour weighs 32 kilograms 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:48.350
 panasonic 36 battery controller 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.350
 volt four and a half dark amount 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.390
 Enough average somewhere in the 50 60 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.329
 kilometers when without active help 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:58.989
 pedals with atina help as right 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:58.989
 drives more 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:10.159
 handle the gas the more you press the wheel 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:13.320
 motor turns freely does not slow down 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:15.420
 moving exclusively on the pedals also 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.119
 pedal sensor is installed 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:22.979
 have when we start to be and considered 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:27.229
 motor helps battery easily 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.229
 removed with a key 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.940
 urine 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.600
 You can order it as 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.159
 fastens 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.700
 2 bolt battery designed 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:49.930
 for 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:49.930
 and now i will show you 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:02:00.880
 display the display shows the speed 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:02:02.530
 big numbers except speed he 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:08.860
 displays battery charge level 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:12.240
 that's 86 percent how much we drove it 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:18.520
 odometer now oh yeah and switches 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:20.200
 button key to trip is to run for 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.540
 today in order to reset 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.270
 mileage today push 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:30.959
 minus until zero appears here and 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:33.880
 hold minus here he got off 0 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:36.070
 we clamp once again the key switches to 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.160
 odometer shows total mileage here 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:40.600
 us load scale that is how much 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:44.250
 engine consumes a lot of energy in 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:47.290
 current moment and two dashes is the calculation 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.990
 range on the remaining charge 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.610
 battery when we start to go he 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:53.410
 accordingly, the load will calculate 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.980
 approximately how much is enough for us 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.870
 charge 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:03:01.030
 here is the remote on the remote there is also a backlight 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:03.160
 Now the day is not visible that the lights 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.560
 turns on but at night it's nice enough 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:08.830
 it all looks and here's the gas knob 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:11.620
 we push the lever we press the harder we pressed 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:13.900
 the faster the water proof went and she 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.250
 way connector that is important enough 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:20.159
 convenient installation 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:22.610
 trouble free operation and of course 

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:25.590
 esthetic appearance that is such 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:28.879
 set we recommend people for whom 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:32.879
 not indifferent appearance 

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:35.870
 electric bikes and of course 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:37.920
 lightness which is very important usually for 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:41.549
 professional cyclists 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:44.250
 and now i will show how it works on 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:47.790
 go so many ask us 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:51.290
 is there enough power 350 watts to 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.290
 enough now I'll show 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:59.730
 now I will show two tests 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:02.890
 I will spend more precisely the first test will be on 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:06.460
 maximum speed second test on 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:08.340
 lifting year my weight is 75 kilograms of wheel 

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:13.830
 now 29 inches 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:13.830
 go pedals twirl will not 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:58.400
 so maximum speed as we see 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:59.180
 about 35 kilometers an hour without help 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.070
 pedals 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:03.530
 with the pedals of course you can accelerate and 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:07.110
 more but just the engine is already on 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:10.470
 greater speed will not help 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:12.870
 it's on an almost charged battery by 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:15.210
 very smooth roads basically usually 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:16.620
 somewhere but 30-32 kilometers an hour 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:20.430
 real speed you can 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:22.680
 develop without pedals and now i'm 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:24.990
 I show how he reaches the palace hill here 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:28.310
 not very cool but nevertheless it is 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:30.590
 and it will be quite indicative food 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:33.390
 motorboat pull 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:34.560
 more that the motor is basically designed 

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:37.580
 for pedal assistance 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.580
 Here I draw 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:44.569
 you without the help of kicked me scatters in 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:44.569
 mountain 

00:05:46.569 --> 00:05:50.610
 sorry for the glare weather today 

00:05:48.369 --> 00:05:53.479
 sunny but 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:53.479
 what will you be 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:03.880
 that is free 20 kilometers per hour he 

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:07.030
 accelerates and continues slowly 

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:09.220
 accelerate more here you liked 

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:10.030
 subscribe to our channel put 

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:12.660
 huskies 

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:12.660
 after all
