00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:07.640
 Patrick Simon of Mission Alternative Energies 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.640
 today what is more exhaust driving a car 

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:15.449
 In dispute with the police was there what am I with the choir 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:23.849
 but honestly the advantages over natural gas vehicles are already 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:24.800
 remarkable 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.150
 we are not sure the alliance will be tested multiple times no problem also in the 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:30.630
 Case of a fire 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.989
 Crime a chain can not really say but of the performance 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.630
 Sinn sees with appropriate motorization comparable to the 

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:40.110
 Gasoline or diesel vehicles 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.520
 but then with the tank everything always such a problem where can I find the new 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.970
 Fuel for both has the car that meanwhile is quite simple though 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:52.430
 Volkswagen then pushes way then just on natural gas filling station and from 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:53.949
 Tripoli nothing displayed 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:57.280
 that deserves how exactly the porsche-logo works 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.629
 Relatives and made and I'm curious if I can do that 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.920
 770 in many cities there is extremely little in Germany compared to 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.920
 put the 50,000 people 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.080
 this is also due to the lack of customers 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.750
 60 thousand cars 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:14.900
 today in Germany 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.560
 with losses in value 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.420
 the band Come Closer Walk for the Row 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.420
 I have to visit the monument office and Thomas MÃ¼ller 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.630
 get that is the positive pull out guest will be 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.020
 Residents must be low and middle income earners 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:32.799
 but 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:35.799
 Eventually we looked at March 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.200
 but it is certainly loud 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.080
 Application 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.450
 so easy 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:49.860
 knew how 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.740
 and the beautiful is the member status and handy 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.600
 50 Cent the kilo because for me just a hammer 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:03.740
 there is the way Super 1 38 15 38 not even very sensitive about just 110 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.550
 are limited 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:07.330
 It was fun again 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.030
 People say that we do not always think, "I'm ecstatic 

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:14.449
 if we ourselves 

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:16.369
 Martina Hingis so wonderful 

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:18.149
 wait three seconds 

00:02:18.149 --> 00:02:20.039
 through the many competitors FC St 

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:23.509
 and then just lose weight 

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:24.989
 Brunner was dripping with 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.589
 stinks me the Waiblingen 

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:30.299
 the one cap on it again 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:32.269
 with the road cars 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:35.929
 It's not a problem at all and safety these days 

00:02:35.929 --> 00:02:37.989
 all the parameters met 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:39.380
 at the 24-hour race 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.380
 At the top of the team two cars painted the wagons 

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:45.679
 To create Bundesliga 

00:02:45.679 --> 00:02:49.809
 Volkswagen starts the classic in the Eifel with suicide in pouring Roccos in 

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:52.419
 the class alternative drives 

00:02:52.419 --> 00:02:56.409
 only nine minutes 30 will need the fastest guest pilots on the 25th 

00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:58.289
 Kilometer loop 

00:02:58.289 --> 00:03:01.289
 just under a minute slower than the industry at the top 

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:08.639
 reaches the city by 115 b70n square and then celebrate 

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:13.639
 Patrick is doing the test today in the Motorsport Arena in Oschersleben 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:18.049
 the natural gas and racing car 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:21.049
 fits that together 

00:03:29.619 --> 00:03:32.619
 Become Robert Enke 

00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:45.809
 Oliver Reck 

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:01.769
 - at the earliest 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:05.029
 a baby in crawl Pastor Wolfgang Kaufmann has no chance 

00:04:05.029 --> 00:04:08.029
 dodge 

00:04:10.719 --> 00:04:13.229
 The start of the race is on Saturday at 16 o'clock 

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:16.229
 170 cars go hunting twice 

00:04:17.559 --> 00:04:21.069
 Patrick starts to be in a team with ex-rally champion Carlos 

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:24.729
 and Hammerfall his team the fastest lap times of all sirocco 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:26.569
 Pilots on the asphalt 

00:04:26.569 --> 00:04:29.889
 That's the way from 47th to 21st 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:32.710
 Unfortunately, the catch-up is not crowned with success 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:36.389
 Sunday morning is the race for the desert wind with start number 117 

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:39.389
 completed 

00:04:43.059 --> 00:04:46.059
 Radeberg 

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:08.009
 the viewer becomes 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:23.180
 5130 kilograms, the whole story weighs almost 200 kilograms less 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:25.219
 as the victory in the sprint 

00:05:25.219 --> 00:05:28.610
 the sheet metal dress remains spoiler on the front and rear provide the necessary 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:32.549
 Downforce to fit 18-inchers and Michelin Gomis 

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:39.550
 Everything is given here 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:42.879
 behind the fuel filler flap, the filler necks rose the largest 

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:47.159
 Difference to the series the Advance Auto Government's high morale is intact 

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:49.740
 on the way and has no fuel reserves 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:52.529
 their car goes to them for the city 

00:05:52.529 --> 00:05:58.180
 the two-liter turbo makes 282 hp 33 less than in gasoline or

 Dr 

00:06:45.629 --> 00:06:48.629
 him during the test phase 

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:52.479
 Feedback asks 

00:06:52.479 --> 00:06:56.209
 Malouda with natural gas capital has been deep council behind direction WM 

00:06:57.149 --> 00:07:00.360
 Contour the possible impression get the car off a bit 

00:07:00.359 --> 00:07:04.429
 less torque otherwise power dissipation smoke on the chain 

00:07:04.429 --> 00:07:06.860
 absolutely equals to gasoline 

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:10.219
 with turbo engine 

00:07:10.219 --> 00:07:12.180
 the Erfurt 

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:14.490
 at the gasoline 

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:17.840
 if you have to be stronger but if the consumer then miss 

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:21.620
 efficient bit of tiny consumption us just at the pit stop their 

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:23.969
 Suppliers AP am Steller just laughs 

00:07:23.969 --> 00:07:26.369
 cool number 

00:07:26.369 --> 00:07:29.369
 this would have been in the Greenstream 

00:07:30.629 --> 00:07:34.610
 it's just not that hard to drive anymore, there are not only these beasts 

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:38.210
 this was earlier in the Alpencup Porsche what you all piece that was a 

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:39.669
 Monster also with power 

00:07:39.669 --> 00:07:44.550
 Modern racing cars are relatively easy to open and drive a good minute 

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:47.689
 the special that we still fast on the very simple level the car 

00:07:47.689 --> 00:07:50.689
 can move respect 

00:07:50.689 --> 00:07:53.649
 Kevin Stricklin June in her everyday life 

00:07:53.649 --> 00:07:57.559
 Small natural gas tanks in the production car make for a sparse 300-kilometer range 

00:07:58.509 --> 00:08:02.440
 In addition, there is a lot of petrol station network and the high premium of almost 3000 

00:08:02.439 --> 00:08:05.669
 Euro so first of all speaks nothing for the natural gas variant 

00:08:06.419 --> 00:08:09.799
 but no particulate matter 25 percent less CO 2 emissions 

00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:14.410
 around 50 percent lower fuel costs bring that and some 

00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:15.880
 Things also on the racetrack
