00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
I'll show you a picture of what it

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.350 
I'll show you a picture of what it
looked<00:01:25.560> like<00:01:25.650> halfway<00:01:26.040> through<00:01:28.909> so<00:01:29.909> you're

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
looked like halfway through so you're

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.940 
looked like halfway through so you're
halfway<00:01:30.509> through<00:01:30.659> was<00:01:31.020> looking<00:01:31.409> good<00:01:31.560> and

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
halfway through was looking good and

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.850 
halfway through was looking good and
since<00:01:32.280> it's<00:01:32.460> cooler<00:01:32.939> now<00:01:33.240> it's<00:01:33.630> not<00:01:33.840> as<00:01:33.990> humid

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
since it's cooler now it's not as humid

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.620 
since it's cooler now it's not as humid
like<00:01:35.159> it<00:01:35.280> was<00:01:35.460> when<00:01:35.670> I<00:01:35.700> did<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:36.000> motions<00:01:36.420> I

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
like it was when I did the motions I

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.539 
like it was when I did the motions I
think<00:01:37.170> that's<00:01:37.320> why<00:01:37.439> my<00:01:37.590> hair<00:01:37.799> came<00:01:38.159> out<00:01:38.340> better

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
think that's why my hair came out better

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.940 
think that's why my hair came out better
than<00:01:38.880> before<00:01:39.049> my<00:01:40.049> hair<00:01:40.229> before<00:01:40.590> it<00:01:40.650> came<00:01:40.829> out

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
than before my hair before it came out

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
than before my hair before it came out
like<00:01:41.100> a<00:01:41.159> blowout<00:01:42.140> so<00:01:43.159> yeah<00:01:44.159> that<00:01:44.520> was<00:01:44.670> not<00:01:44.820> what

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
like a blowout so yeah that was not what

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.399 
like a blowout so yeah that was not what
I<00:01:45.000> was<00:01:45.180> important<00:01:45.659> but<00:01:45.780> do<00:01:45.960> you<00:01:46.049> think<00:01:46.110> that<00:01:46.320> I

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
I was important but do you think that I

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:47.600 
I was important but do you think that I
had<00:01:46.560> to<00:01:46.649> do<00:01:46.770> with<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:46.920> fact<00:01:47.130> that<00:01:47.340> it<00:01:47.520> was

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
had to do with the fact that it was

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.219 
had to do with the fact that it was
really<00:01:47.850> humid<00:01:48.180> when<00:01:48.450> I<00:01:48.479> used<00:01:48.750> emotions

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
really humid when I used emotions

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.440 
really humid when I used emotions
products<00:01:49.649> I<00:01:49.770> don't<00:01:49.829> think<00:01:50.189> that<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:51.060> products

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
products I don't think that the products

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.539 
products I don't think that the products
don't<00:01:51.720> work<00:01:51.869> I<00:01:52.320> think<00:01:52.470> they<00:01:52.799> do<00:01:52.860> work<00:01:53.189> I<00:01:53.340> just

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
don't work I think they do work I just

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.580 
don't work I think they do work I just
think<00:01:53.729> that<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:54.509> environment<00:01:55.200> that<00:01:55.290> I<00:01:55.350> was<00:01:55.439> in

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
think that the environment that I was in

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.590 
think that the environment that I was in
it<00:01:55.920> just<00:01:56.100> wasn't<00:01:56.909> conducive<00:01:56.969> to<00:01:57.450> me

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
it just wasn't conducive to me

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.569 
it just wasn't conducive to me
straighten<00:01:57.930> my<00:01:57.960> hair<00:01:58.049> at<00:01:58.259> that<00:01:58.320> point<00:01:58.710> so<00:01:59.310> now

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
straighten my hair at that point so now

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.340 
straighten my hair at that point so now
you<00:01:59.640> know<00:02:00.000> it's<00:02:00.210> cool<00:02:00.450> outside<00:02:00.719> there's

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
you know it's cool outside there's

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.440 
you know it's cool outside there's
really<00:02:01.530> no<00:02:01.680> humidity<00:02:02.280> so<00:02:02.820> I<00:02:02.880> was<00:02:03.030> like<00:02:03.240> I<00:02:03.329> must

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
really no humidity so I was like I must

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.200 
really no humidity so I was like I must
try<00:02:03.689> this<00:02:03.750> so<00:02:04.079> right<00:02:04.350> now<00:02:04.500> I<00:02:04.530> just<00:02:04.740> have

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
try this so right now I just have

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.949 
try this so right now I just have
hair<00:02:05.500> twist<00:02:06.500> it<00:02:06.620> in<00:02:06.740> the<00:02:06.830> front<00:02:07.209> I<00:02:08.209> did<00:02:08.630> one

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
hair twist it in the front I did one

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:11.920 
hair twist it in the front I did one
pass<00:02:09.289> on<00:02:09.860> like<00:02:10.369> 90%<00:02:11.000> of<00:02:11.030> my<00:02:11.150> hair<00:02:11.420> I<00:02:11.450> did<00:02:11.630> one

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
pass on like 90% of my hair I did one

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.890 
pass on like 90% of my hair I did one
pass<00:02:12.110> in<00:02:12.319> each<00:02:12.470> section<00:02:12.880> some<00:02:13.880> sections<00:02:14.450> I

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
pass in each section some sections I

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.250 
pass in each section some sections I
like<00:02:15.890> in<00:02:16.040> the<00:02:16.130> front<00:02:16.400> I<00:02:16.760> did<00:02:17.090> like<00:02:17.300> two<00:02:17.720> passes

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
like in the front I did like two passes

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.430 
like in the front I did like two passes
but<00:02:18.530> I<00:02:18.560> tried<00:02:18.950> not<00:02:19.280> to<00:02:19.540> do<00:02:20.540> more<00:02:20.780> than<00:02:20.959> that<00:02:21.230> the

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
but I tried not to do more than that the

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.280 
but I tried not to do more than that the
Flatiron<00:02:21.890> that<00:02:22.069> I<00:02:22.100> use<00:02:22.489> is<00:02:22.760> this<00:02:23.420> one<00:02:23.840> it<00:02:24.230> is

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
Flatiron that I use is this one it is

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.610 
Flatiron that I use is this one it is
called<00:02:24.739> is<00:02:25.430> hot<00:02:25.850> and<00:02:26.060> silky<00:02:26.540> and<00:02:26.690> it<00:02:27.230> says<00:02:27.440> it's

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
called is hot and silky and it says it's

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.670 
called is hot and silky and it says it's
a<00:02:27.830> tourmaline<00:02:28.730> ceramic<00:02:29.350> so<00:02:30.350> this<00:02:30.470> is<00:02:30.530> what<00:02:30.620> it

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
a tourmaline ceramic so this is what it

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.160 
a tourmaline ceramic so this is what it
looks<00:02:30.830> like<00:02:30.890> it's<00:02:31.130> a<00:02:31.430> purplish<00:02:32.209> color<00:02:32.239> and

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
looks like it's a purplish color and

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.170 
looks like it's a purplish color and
gold<00:02:33.500> I<00:02:33.890> got<00:02:34.459> this<00:02:34.550> from<00:02:34.700> the<00:02:34.760> view<00:02:34.940> supply

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
gold I got this from the view supply

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.270 
gold I got this from the view supply
store<00:02:35.540> last<00:02:35.840> year<00:02:36.110> as<00:02:36.230> well<00:02:36.470> from<00:02:36.890> Sally's

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
store last year as well from Sally's

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.390 
store last year as well from Sally's
actually<00:02:37.700> it<00:02:38.150> has<00:02:38.450> a<00:02:38.480> heat<00:02:38.750> control<00:02:39.110> and<00:02:39.500> I

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
actually it has a heat control and I

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.330 
actually it has a heat control and I
kept<00:02:40.700> mine<00:02:41.000> close<00:02:41.900> to<00:02:42.050> 300<00:02:42.620> so<00:02:42.769> I<00:02:42.800> would<00:02:43.040> assume

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
kept mine close to 300 so I would assume

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.050 
kept mine close to 300 so I would assume
that<00:02:43.400> it's<00:02:43.820> about<00:02:44.230> 310<00:02:45.230> 320<00:02:45.739> the<00:02:46.430> next<00:02:46.760> notch

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
that it's about 310 320 the next notch

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.020 
that it's about 310 320 the next notch
on<00:02:47.239> here<00:02:47.600> is<00:02:47.690> 370<00:02:48.290> and<00:02:48.320> I<00:02:48.500> was<00:02:48.680> not<00:02:48.920> even<00:02:49.070> close

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
on here is 370 and I was not even close

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.090 
on here is 370 and I was not even close
to<00:02:50.150> that<00:02:50.480> law<00:02:50.690> was<00:02:50.840> closer<00:02:51.080> to<00:02:51.260> the<00:02:51.350> 300<00:02:51.920> knot

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
to that law was closer to the 300 knot

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.930 
to that law was closer to the 300 knot
so<00:02:52.519> it<00:02:52.760> was<00:02:53.180> about<00:02:53.330> 310<00:02:53.780> 320

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
so it was about 310 320

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.430 
so it was about 310 320
I'm<00:02:55.940> afraid<00:02:56.269> of<00:02:56.480> heat<00:02:56.600> damage<00:02:56.780> so<00:02:57.170> I

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
I'm afraid of heat damage so I

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.140 
I'm afraid of heat damage so I
definitely<00:02:57.950> did<00:02:58.400> not<00:02:58.580> want<00:02:58.790> to<00:02:58.820> go<00:02:58.970> higher

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
definitely did not want to go higher

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.530 
definitely did not want to go higher
than<00:02:59.300> that

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
than that

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.830 
than that
I<00:02:59.720> mean<00:02:59.950> this<00:03:00.950> hot<00:03:01.370> and<00:03:01.580> silky<00:03:02.060> goes<00:03:02.510> all<00:03:02.810> the

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
I mean this hot and silky goes all the

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.720 
I mean this hot and silky goes all the
way<00:03:02.959> up<00:03:03.260> to<00:03:04.870> 450<00:03:05.870> degrees<00:03:06.470> and<00:03:06.709> that's<00:03:07.340> really

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
way up to 450 degrees and that's really

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.850 
way up to 450 degrees and that's really
really<00:03:08.060> hot<00:03:08.239> some<00:03:09.019> people<00:03:09.260> say<00:03:09.350> I<00:03:09.410> can<00:03:09.530> take<00:03:09.650> it

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:09.860 
really hot some people say I can take it

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:11.680 
really hot some people say I can take it
some<00:03:10.190> people<00:03:10.280> can't<00:03:10.610> I<00:03:10.790> don't<00:03:11.090> know<00:03:11.269> what<00:03:11.540> my

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
some people can't I don't know what my

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:16.180 
some people can't I don't know what my
by<00:03:12.650> heat<00:03:12.829> index<00:03:13.220> is<00:03:13.430> I<00:03:14.329> just<00:03:14.630> had<00:03:14.780> a<00:03:14.810> 310<00:03:15.769> 320

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
by heat index is I just had a 310 320

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:17.440 
by heat index is I just had a 310 320
that's<00:03:16.610> what<00:03:16.730> I'm<00:03:16.820> gonna<00:03:16.940> keep<00:03:17.030> it<00:03:17.150> at<00:03:17.239> and

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
that's what I'm gonna keep it at and

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.289 
that's what I'm gonna keep it at and
also<00:03:17.660> I<00:03:17.870> turned<00:03:18.320> off<00:03:18.440> my<00:03:18.470> flat<00:03:18.860> iron<00:03:19.299> during

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:20.299 
also I turned off my flat iron during

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:22.810 
also I turned off my flat iron during
the<00:03:21.049> process<00:03:21.500> so<00:03:21.769> it<00:03:21.890> could<00:03:22.010> cool<00:03:22.280> down<00:03:22.310> and

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:22.820 
the process so it could cool down and

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.569 
the process so it could cool down and
then<00:03:22.910> I<00:03:22.970> would<00:03:23.090> turn<00:03:23.209> it<00:03:23.269> back<00:03:23.480> on<00:03:23.660> and<00:03:24.250> so<00:03:25.250> I'm

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:25.579 
then I would turn it back on and so I'm

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:28.810 
then I would turn it back on and so I'm
this<00:03:26.030> serum<00:03:26.510> I<00:03:26.660> like<00:03:26.900> it<00:03:27.140> here<00:03:27.350> feels<00:03:28.010> really

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820 
this serum I like it here feels really

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.970 
this serum I like it here feels really
good<00:03:29.030> it<00:03:29.570> feels<00:03:30.140> soft

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
good it feels soft

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.699 
good it feels soft
it<00:03:31.400> doesn't<00:03:31.730> feel<00:03:31.850> super<00:03:32.239> oily<00:03:32.810> like<00:03:33.530> I'm

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709 
it doesn't feel super oily like I'm

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:35.620 
it doesn't feel super oily like I'm
