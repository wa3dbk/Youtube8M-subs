00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:16.400
 hello very good and today I will introduce you 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.720
 The plugin is called nadir think it 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.250
 has enough time then the good 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.230
 People have told me that it is very good 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.450
 fix as I have here set up I have 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.950
 the guitar connected to the computer and 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:27.350
 good on the track is to remove here 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:28.970
 I have the monitor activated so that 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:30.620
 what I play is going to sound through 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.930
 there 

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:35.790
 if I remove this it does not sound anything 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.530
 but good with this I can go in time 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.750
 real what I 'm touching and I've created 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.310
 a track group 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.690
 in stereo because I'm going to use a 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.130
 thing about this plugin that works 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.930
 pretty good in stereo that good the 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.700
 group is called group 1 not even you 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.830
 changed the name so good the guitar 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.450
 comes directly here where he has put 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:54.870
 the typical distortion plugins that 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:57.120
 always used the ts 808 and the lg pollin 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.090
 456 and well now what I'm going to do is 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:03.360
 place here the distortion plugin the 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.949
 nadir who by default opens up well in 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.720
 the folder is clicked and we load the 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.850
 impulse that we seek so look at this 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.619
 case I will use the exo's dya the 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.840
 it sounds really cool Ã¨xode 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.840
 yahel bringer let's see how it sounds 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.080
 and so a principle that this plugin has 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.270
 it is a for jumps that is to say to cut 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.729
 Certain serious if we move it here 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.050
 we put a frequency this frequency 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:30.760
 it is from which he is going to cut us 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.410
 below that to say if we put it to 100 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.030
 it means that everything that is 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.740
 under 100 hertz will cut it 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.119
 this is fine if we maybe use a 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.590
 momentum that has many serious and 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:40.539
 smudges a little 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.549
 in this case it is necessary but good and 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:43.750
 then one step down is that what you 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:45.700
 ago is to cut all the 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.319
 frequencies that are above what 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.689
 let's say I recommend leaving 

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:51.609
 normally at 10,000 hertz to 10 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:53.049
 kilovolts this means that nothing 

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:54.640
 of more than 10 kilovolts 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:56.200
 is going to sound and that in the guitars is 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.850
 precisely the sound as well as a little 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.009
 shrill but good I recommend 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.289
 normally then put the raisins high 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:04.240
 around 100 and the low passes 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:05.709
 about 10,000 this can 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.429
 modify to your liking and good here 

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:08.429
 I have the guitar 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.230
 I think it's not very well tuned but 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.269
 it does not matter and you have one thing that is very 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.879
 well that it be used in stereo mode 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:22.860
 the good stereo here charge the same 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:24.659
 boost the sodium I always both 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.950
 sides always colo colo the same sound 

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:27.629
 there are people who do not but good that already 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.280
 it depends on each one placed the same 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:30.870
 momentum on both sides this here what 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.319
 active and good in principle now it's not going 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.910
 to sound different but what we can 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:38.730
 do is in one of the two have here 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:41.370
 already incorporated a delay is to say a 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:44.010
 delay not an echo but a delay on 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.870
 delay this we put for example to to 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.190
 maximum to 20 milliseconds and see how 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.190
 record sound on both sides 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.610
 If I leave by default fixes 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.360
 this is a way of with only one 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:06.310
 guitar make it sound like the two 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.720
 sides because if you simply duplicate it 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.300
 the guitar the two sides will sound on the 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.850
 center this as it adds a delay of 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.740
 about 20 milliseconds since it already makes 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.360
 sound on both sides this is not the 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.680
 better way this way you can not get 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.870
 the greatest weight in the mixture of 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.310
 guitars but good if you do not want 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.200
 complicate life a lot and you want a 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.310
 easy and simple way to get that 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.290
 the guitar zone on both sides 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:29.970
 recording only one guitar then good 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.970
 with this plugin you are just ok 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:38.049
 that you do have to place the nadir on 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:40.269
 plugin this for the impulses in a 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:42.099
 track that is stereo if you put it on 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:44.500
 a track that is mono will not sound by the 

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:46.599
 two sides will sound in the center that's why 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.609
 I created a clue of the group in 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:51.120
 stereo where I sent the guitar and 

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:53.829
 it works on both sides at the same time 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:57.180
 you can use different impulses in 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:57.180
 each side 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.890
 but well that already depends on me 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:05.690
 always use the same if we do not want 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:06.950
 let it be 100% left and 100% right 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:09.080
 Well in each of the tracks 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:12.310
 we can put him then look 50% left 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:14.830
 and it is then 50% on the right 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:17.880
 and so it will sound a little less to the 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:17.880
 sides and a little more to the center 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.800
 but good I on guitar I recommend 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.690
 always 100% on each side is what gives 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.980
 more breadth to the mix and this explore 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.170
 usually have also to adjust the 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:32.340
 quality although although you put it to the ground 

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:36.260
 to the maximum there really is not much 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.260
 fixed difference this is to the minimum 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.060
 and this is to the extreme maximum 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:45.120
 in principle there is not much difference 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.410
 but good when exporting the 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.820
 mix well I recommend that what 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:48.990
 put to the maximum because that's the way 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:51.540
 but we assure you that there will 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:53.790
 lose nothing in the process of exporting 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:56.270
 but good is normal as you can see 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:56.270
 fairly good 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.340
 with this adjust simply the level of 

00:05:02.069 --> 00:05:04.340
 exit 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:11.729
 saturated a bit but good as you see 

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:13.290
 It is a plugin that is quite simple 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:14.759
 has too much complication has a 

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:16.530
 for jumps and a low pass which is 

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:19.080
 very well to be able to cut certain 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:21.120
 impulse frequencies you can do 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.530
 the delay this so that it has the effect 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.710
 in stereo that sounds from both sides to 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:24.710
 the time 

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:32.650
 what the impulse plugins have is 

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:34.659
 that everyone sounds the same in principle 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:36.729
 it means if you use kefir and 

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:38.110
 you put an impulse in the kefir you have to 

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:40.659
 put the mix one hundred percent but good 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:42.550
 or you put the 'cap 2 and put the same 

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:44.680
 impulse or you put the nadir and put the 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:46.059
 same impulse or the mixer 2 in any 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:48.699
 plugin that you use the same impulse 

00:05:46.059 --> 00:05:50.319
 it will sound exactly the same, yes then 

00:05:48.699 --> 00:05:51.969
 each one has then one for jumps a 

00:05:50.319 --> 00:05:53.710
 goes low to cut certain 

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:55.180
 frequencies or this that you have here for 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:57.039
 that sounds with both degrees at the same time 

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:59.289
 each plugin already has its extra options 

00:05:57.039 --> 00:06:00.699
 but the same guitar impulse like that in 

00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:02.229
 principle without retouching anything else is going to 

00:06:00.699 --> 00:06:04.180
 sound exactly the same you use the 

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:05.289
 plugin that you use but good this 

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:07.689
 As you can see, you have solutions that 

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:09.490
 They are quite good and nothing I hope you 

00:06:07.689 --> 00:06:11.999
 enjoy it and we 'll see each other 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:11.999
 as usual
