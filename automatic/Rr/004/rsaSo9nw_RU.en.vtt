00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.209 
channel and also about the map briefly
this<00:00:11.639> is<00:00:11.849> City<00:00:12.210> Heights<00:00:12.710> it's<00:00:13.710> a<00:00:13.889> map<00:00:14.040> that<00:00:14.070> I

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
this is City Heights it's a map that I

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.029 
this is City Heights it's a map that I
made<00:00:14.490> for<00:00:15.150> a<00:00:15.420> competition<00:00:15.839> on<00:00:16.139> for<00:00:16.650> job<00:00:16.920> I

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
made for a competition on for job I

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.290 
made for a competition on for job I
don't<00:00:17.190> know<00:00:17.250> if<00:00:17.310> you<00:00:17.369> guys<00:00:17.490> knew<00:00:17.670> full<00:00:17.850> hookup

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
don't know if you guys knew full hookup

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.810 
don't know if you guys knew full hookup
but<00:00:18.869> they're<00:00:19.320> doing<00:00:19.439> hub<00:00:19.800> of<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:19.920> Dead<00:00:20.189> 3

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
but they're doing hub of the Dead 3

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.010 
but they're doing hub of the Dead 3
which<00:00:21.000> is<00:00:21.029> a<00:00:21.180> sort<00:00:21.390> of<00:00:21.480> long-standing

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
which is a sort of long-standing

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.470 
which is a sort of long-standing
infection<00:00:22.680> contest<00:00:23.160> and<00:00:23.340> I<00:00:24.060> thought<00:00:24.300> I'd

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
infection contest and I thought I'd

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.210 
infection contest and I thought I'd
submit<00:00:24.869> a<00:00:25.050> map<00:00:25.260> for<00:00:25.470> it<00:00:25.619> and<00:00:25.769> this<00:00:25.949> is<00:00:26.070> what<00:00:26.189> I

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
submit a map for it and this is what I

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.779 
submit a map for it and this is what I
came<00:00:26.340> up<00:00:26.400> with<00:00:27.650> it's<00:00:28.650> a<00:00:28.859> linear<00:00:29.189> infection<00:00:29.609> map

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
came up with it's a linear infection map

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.810 
came up with it's a linear infection map
and<00:00:30.109> it<00:00:31.109> it's<00:00:31.740> based<00:00:31.980> around<00:00:32.130> a<00:00:32.309> sort<00:00:32.520> of<00:00:32.550> city

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
and it it's based around a sort of city

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.340 
and it it's based around a sort of city
area<00:00:33.510> I<00:00:33.660> don't<00:00:33.899> know<00:00:33.960> if<00:00:34.020> you<00:00:34.079> can<00:00:34.230> recognize

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
area I don't know if you can recognize

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.110 
area I don't know if you can recognize
that<00:00:34.680> by<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:34.890> skyscrapers<00:00:35.579> and<00:00:35.730> everything

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
that by the skyscrapers and everything

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.430 
that by the skyscrapers and everything
but<00:00:36.750> it's<00:00:37.290> based<00:00:37.469> around<00:00:37.590> a<00:00:37.710> city<00:00:37.890> area<00:00:38.309> and

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:39.440 
but it's based around a city area and

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.780 
but it's based around a city area and
this<00:00:40.440> first<00:00:40.800> phase<00:00:40.950> that<00:00:41.280> you're<00:00:41.460> watching

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
this first phase that you're watching

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.420 
this first phase that you're watching
now<00:00:41.940> is<00:00:42.180> just<00:00:42.390> a<00:00:42.480> sort<00:00:42.750> of<00:00:42.809> a<00:00:43.160> street<00:00:44.160> area

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
now is just a sort of a street area

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.279 
now is just a sort of a street area
where<00:00:44.760> you<00:00:44.910> sort<00:00:45.149> of<00:00:45.210> get<00:00:45.480> out<00:00:45.539> of<00:00:45.660> your<00:00:45.870> house

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
where you sort of get out of your house

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.600 
where you sort of get out of your house
I<00:00:46.590> don't<00:00:46.739> if<00:00:46.829> you<00:00:46.890> saw<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.100> house<00:00:47.309> that<00:00:47.579> you

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
I don't if you saw the house that you

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.350 
I don't if you saw the house that you
spawned<00:00:47.940> in<00:00:48.379> and<00:00:49.379> then<00:00:49.559> you<00:00:49.649> sort<00:00:49.860> of<00:00:50.180> you<00:00:51.180> walk

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
spawned in and then you sort of you walk

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.510 
spawned in and then you sort of you walk
through<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.629> street<00:00:51.989> on<00:00:52.199> to<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.590> Mart<00:00:53.100> area

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
through the street on to the Mart area

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.189 
through the street on to the Mart area
and<00:00:53.699> obviously<00:00:54.390> we<00:00:54.510> haven't<00:00:54.660> got<00:00:54.809> into<00:00:55.079> the

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
and obviously we haven't got into the

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.500 
and obviously we haven't got into the
Mart<00:00:55.379> area<00:00:55.710> yet<00:00:55.920> but<00:00:56.160> that's<00:00:57.120> how<00:00:57.300> linear

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
Mart area yet but that's how linear

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.930 
Mart area yet but that's how linear
infection<00:00:58.020> works<00:00:58.230> where<00:00:58.530> you<00:00:58.680> wait<00:00:59.460> at<00:00:59.730> one

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
infection works where you wait at one

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.720 
infection works where you wait at one
area<00:01:00.149> until<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.960> crate<00:01:01.170> drops<00:01:01.350> so<00:01:01.890> as<00:01:02.430> you<00:01:02.489> can

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
area until the crate drops so as you can

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.189 
area until the crate drops so as you can
see<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.210> zombies<00:01:03.510> are<00:01:03.539> sort<00:01:03.809> of<00:01:03.840> attacking

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
see the zombies are sort of attacking

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.590 
see the zombies are sort of attacking
this<00:01:04.470> area<00:01:04.769> right<00:01:04.920> now<00:01:05.070> and<00:01:05.309> they're<00:01:06.299> pushing

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
this area right now and they're pushing

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.410 
this area right now and they're pushing
the<00:01:06.659> humans<00:01:06.990> back<00:01:07.520> fortunately<00:01:08.520> a<00:01:08.549> bit<00:01:09.119> of<00:01:09.210> lag

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
the humans back fortunately a bit of lag

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.179 
the humans back fortunately a bit of lag
and<00:01:10.409> there's<00:01:10.770> a<00:01:10.920> bit<00:01:11.189> but<00:01:12.590> yeah<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.799> crate

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
and there's a bit but yeah the crate

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.880 
and there's a bit but yeah the crate
just<00:01:14.220> dropped<00:01:14.760> and<00:01:15.200> doors<00:01:16.200> are<00:01:16.350> opening<00:01:16.619> and

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
just dropped and doors are opening and

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.039 
just dropped and doors are opening and
humans<00:01:17.340> again<00:01:17.520> into<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.820> second<00:01:18.090> phase<00:01:18.240> so

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
humans again into the second phase so

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.590 
humans again into the second phase so
anyway<00:01:19.860> what<00:01:20.640> I<00:01:20.700> wanted<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:21.030> talk<00:01:21.180> about<00:01:21.330> is

this channel basically over the next
couple<00:01:26.280> of<00:01:26.369> months<00:01:26.490> so<00:01:26.700> i'm<00:01:26.790> gonna<00:01:26.880> be

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000

couple of months so i'm gonna be
uploading<00:01:27.860> mostly<00:01:28.860> my<00:01:29.009> maps<00:01:29.280> but<00:01:29.520> I<00:01:29.700> know<00:01:29.820> if<00:01:30.060> I

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
uploading mostly my maps but I know if I

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.760 
uploading mostly my maps but I know if I
see<00:01:30.329> a<00:01:30.360> good<00:01:30.600> map<00:01:30.750> of<00:01:30.780> my<00:01:31.079> friends<00:01:31.500> I<00:01:31.590> might

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
see a good map of my friends I might

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.620 
see a good map of my friends I might
give<00:01:32.430> it<00:01:32.460> a<00:01:32.670> feature<00:01:32.909> or<00:01:33.090> something<00:01:33.479> like<00:01:33.570> that

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
give it a feature or something like that

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.179 
give it a feature or something like that
but<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.860> maps<00:01:35.070> I<00:01:35.250> make<00:01:35.720> will<00:01:37.040> basically<00:01:38.040> be

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
but the maps I make will basically be

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.660 
but the maps I make will basically be
uploaded<00:01:38.790> and<00:01:39.320> to<00:01:40.320> show<00:01:40.500> you<00:01:40.560> guys<00:01:40.770> in<00:01:41.189> this

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
sort of format where I show gameplay of

so<00:02:12.550> about<00:02:13.000> that<00:02:13.200> I'm<00:02:14.200> just<00:02:14.320> going<00:02:14.470> to<00:02:14.530> show

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:14.710 
so about that I'm just going to show

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:16.380 
so about that I'm just going to show
from<00:02:14.860> a<00:02:14.950> zombies<00:02:15.220> perspective<00:02:15.760> quickly<00:02:16.120> so

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
from a zombies perspective quickly so

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.060 
from a zombies perspective quickly so
they're<00:02:17.350> attacking<00:02:17.680> through<00:02:17.890> the<00:02:18.040> mark

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
they're attacking through the mark

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.200 
they're attacking through the mark
zombies<00:02:21.070> are<00:02:21.220> sort<00:02:21.400> of<00:02:21.430> like<00:02:21.490> waiting<00:02:22.030> there

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:22.210 
zombies are sort of like waiting there

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:24.120 
zombies are sort of like waiting there
for<00:02:22.240> the<00:02:22.540> humans<00:02:22.930> to<00:02:23.170> run<00:02:23.650> away<00:02:23.860> and<00:02:23.980> then

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
for the humans to run away and then

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.840 
for the humans to run away and then
that's<00:02:24.340> the<00:02:24.490> sort<00:02:24.670> of<00:02:24.700> tactic<00:02:25.060> they<00:02:25.210> employ

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
that's the sort of tactic they employ

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.930 
that's the sort of tactic they employ
bit<00:02:27.850> of<00:02:27.940> lag<00:02:28.150> is<00:02:28.390> sort<00:02:28.660> of<00:02:28.690> a<00:02:28.780> noise<00:02:29.670> annoys<00:02:30.670> me

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
bit of lag is sort of a noise annoys me

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.510 
bit of lag is sort of a noise annoys me
and<00:02:30.970> it<00:02:31.210> makes<00:02:31.930> me<00:02:32.050> rage<00:02:32.320> but<00:02:32.740> you<00:02:33.370> can't

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
and it makes me rage but you can't

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.340 
and it makes me rage but you can't
really<00:02:33.670> do<00:02:33.760> much<00:02:33.820> about<00:02:34.030> that<00:02:34.120> so<00:02:34.840> this<00:02:35.110> is<00:02:35.230> the

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
really do much about that so this is the

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:36.750 
really do much about that so this is the
third<00:02:35.530> phase<00:02:35.830> area<00:02:36.250> and<00:02:36.370> the<00:02:36.430> zombies<00:02:36.730> are

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
third phase area and the zombies are

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.660 
third phase area and the zombies are
basically<00:02:37.090> attacking<00:02:37.630> this<00:02:37.840> third<00:02:38.140> phase<00:02:38.670> I'm

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
basically attacking this third phase I'm

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:40.949 
basically attacking this third phase I'm
trying<00:02:40.090> to<00:02:40.180> find<00:02:40.240> someone<00:02:40.510> who<00:02:40.570> isn't<00:02:40.810> lagging

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
trying to find someone who isn't lagging

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:43.860 
trying to find someone who isn't lagging
there<00:02:41.170> we<00:02:41.230> go<00:02:41.850> but<00:02:42.850> that's<00:02:43.300> the<00:02:43.450> sort<00:02:43.660> of<00:02:43.690> third

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
there we go but that's the sort of third

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.449 
there we go but that's the sort of third
phase<00:02:44.110> with<00:02:44.350> the<00:02:44.380> sort<00:02:44.709> of<00:02:44.770> marine<00:02:45.010> camp<00:02:45.280> at

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
phase with the sort of marine camp at

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:48.150 
phase with the sort of marine camp at
the<00:02:45.490> end<00:02:45.700> and<00:02:46.620> humans<00:02:47.620> have<00:02:47.740> to<00:02:47.830> try<00:02:47.980> and<00:02:48.070> get

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
the end and humans have to try and get

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.390 
the end and humans have to try and get
to<00:02:48.250> that<00:02:48.340> mirroring<00:02:48.700> marine<00:02:49.240> camp<00:02:49.510> sorry<00:02:49.840> and

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
to that mirroring marine camp sorry and

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
to that mirroring marine camp sorry and
they<00:02:51.400> have<00:02:51.520> to<00:02:51.640> hold<00:02:51.790> off<00:02:51.880> there<00:02:52.090> for<00:02:52.120> like<00:02:52.390> a

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
they have to hold off there for like a

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.010 
they have to hold off there for like a
minute<00:02:52.750> I<00:02:53.020> think<00:02:53.350> it's<00:02:53.440> like<00:02:53.560> a<00:02:53.590> minute<00:02:54.390> so<00:02:55.390> I'm

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.020 
minute I think it's like a minute so I'm

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:57.570 
minute I think it's like a minute so I'm
just<00:02:56.200> going<00:02:56.320> to<00:02:56.380> show<00:02:56.470> two<00:02:56.590> rounds<00:02:57.070> today<00:02:57.190> and

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
just going to show two rounds today and

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.270 
just going to show two rounds today and
that<00:02:57.910> was<00:02:58.030> the<00:02:58.150> first<00:02:58.180> round<00:02:58.570> of<00:02:58.720> a<00:02:58.810> sea<00:02:58.959> so<00:02:59.590> as

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
that was the first round of a sea so as

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.300 
that was the first round of a sea so as
you<00:03:00.730> can<00:03:00.940> see<00:03:01.090> in<00:03:01.180> the<00:03:01.270> second<00:03:01.600> round<00:03:02.100> try<00:03:03.100> for

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
you can see in the second round try for

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.190 
you can see in the second round try for
me<00:03:03.459> there<00:03:03.640> you<00:03:03.700> go<00:03:03.820> the<00:03:04.810> zombies<00:03:05.110> are

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
me there you go the zombies are

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.170 
me there you go the zombies are
attacking<00:03:05.260> from<00:03:06.130> the<00:03:06.160> MA<00:03:06.430> area<00:03:06.730> they

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
attacking from the MA area they

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.490 
attacking from the MA area they
sometimes<00:03:07.750> they<00:03:08.080> can<00:03:08.230> hide<00:03:08.380> behind

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
sometimes they can hide behind

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.440 
sometimes they can hide behind
barricades<00:03:08.860> as<00:03:09.220> well<00:03:09.400> and<00:03:09.670> I<00:03:10.030> think<00:03:10.269> one<00:03:10.420> of

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
barricades as well and I think one of

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.350 
barricades as well and I think one of
them<00:03:10.600> tied<00:03:10.780> behind<00:03:10.930> their<00:03:11.110> as<00:03:11.350> you<00:03:11.470> can<00:03:11.620> see

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
them tied behind their as you can see

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.960 
them tied behind their as you can see
they're<00:03:13.360> quite<00:03:13.540> sneaky<00:03:13.780> zombies<00:03:14.730> in<00:03:15.730> this

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
they're quite sneaky zombies in this

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.940 
they're quite sneaky zombies in this
game<00:03:16.239> and<00:03:16.510> they<00:03:16.720> tried<00:03:16.959> to<00:03:16.989> hide<00:03:17.200> a<00:03:17.230> lot<00:03:17.350> and<00:03:17.620> it

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
game and they tried to hide a lot and it

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:19.979 
game and they tried to hide a lot and it
usually<00:03:18.100> works<00:03:18.430> to<00:03:18.670> be<00:03:18.760> fair<00:03:18.940> to<00:03:19.090> them<00:03:19.209> but

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
usually works to be fair to them but

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:25.229 
usually works to be fair to them but

infection forger that's why I specialize

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.280 
infection forger that's why I specialize
in<00:03:32.320> if<00:03:33.040> you<00:03:33.160> could<00:03:33.280> say<00:03:33.459> that<00:03:33.489> I<00:03:34.140> don't<00:03:35.140> really
