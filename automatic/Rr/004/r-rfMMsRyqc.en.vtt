 for this routine we are simply going to 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:24.710
 use our body that means 

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:26.539
 that they can do it at home or in a 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.059
 place that you prefer then 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:31.009
 we think so we're going to jog in the post 

00:00:29.059 --> 00:00:33.680
 for 30 seconds let's make meshes 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:35.180
 for 30 seconds later we return to the 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.280
 jog for 10 seconds and then 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.989
 clowns 10 seconds but a maximum 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.089
 intensity all this to warm up 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:42.379
 our muscles and make them fit for 

00:00:41.089 --> 00:00:44.720
 the following routine 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:47.050
 then we started like that but giving in the 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.050
 Market Stall 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:01:00.250

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:15.439
 let's 30 seconds remember to fail over 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.090
 30 seconds 

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:20.590
 remember to flex your legs the 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.590
 knee when falling 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.409
 with 0 can see 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.890
 keep breathing say goodbye 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.890
 deep 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.760
 holding three weddings 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.070
 if you do not go 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.420
 now you will have your body fit for 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.450
 stretch the body correctly and put 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.010
 the optimal muscles for routine 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.599
 say that this routine can be done 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.670
 both women and men the 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:18.739
 only difference is that the push-ups of 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.030
 breast women are going to help themselves with 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:23.030
 knees will do it in this trial 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:25.870
 men are going to do this to us and the 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:28.269
 woman are going to help with the knees 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.470
 that what he's going to do is make it a bit 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:31.299
 easier for women but 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.849
 remember men as women can 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:35.709

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:37.269

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:40.110
 muscles we are together from soft to 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:40.110
