00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130

otherwise<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.530> TV's<00:01:46.799> a<00:01:46.829> very<00:01:47.549> good<00:01:47.759> performer

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
otherwise the TV's a very good performer

otherwise the TV's a very good performer
we<00:01:48.329> did<00:01:48.509> like<00:01:48.720> its<00:01:49.189> screen<00:01:50.189> that<00:01:50.399> didn't

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
we did like its screen that didn't

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.609 
we did like its screen that didn't
really<00:01:50.939> reflect<00:01:51.180> too<00:01:51.630> much<00:01:51.659> of<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.229> ambient

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
really reflect too much of the ambient

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:53.420 
really reflect too much of the ambient
light<00:01:52.770> in<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:52.979> room<00:01:53.009> so<00:01:53.130> if<00:01:53.220> you<00:01:53.310> have<00:01:53.399> a

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
light in the room so if you have a

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:54.530 
light in the room so if you have a
really<00:01:53.579> bright<00:01:53.820> room<00:01:54.060> again<00:01:54.299> this<00:01:54.390> is<00:01:54.509> a

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
pretty good choice that's a quick look

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.020
