00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.279
 angry birds assassin's creed and trailer 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.279
 from millward welcome to jo television 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.060
 same before I'm going to talk about the 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:19.340
 bullfighting and saying that it's a fake is a 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.570
 fake trailer that they have imposed on 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.640
 internet and that the truth is 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.349
 pretty good but it's still a 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.990
 fake teaser fake 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:28.820
 and also in this workshop we can see the 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.770
 I know how it's going to face 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.210
 klaus balls in an epic battle and what 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.309
 they cut right there we see the letters 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.320
 decide as they turn as the movie 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:38.020
 of the avengers with the iron man with the 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.190
 most of the latest commercial films 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.960
 also how is a fake how to do the 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.700
 trailer has taken pictures of old 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.250
 films like Winter Soldier 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:49.550
 or that of the neutron avengers and 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:51.829
 done we have the foot of the cluster 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.800
 so the movie must be good 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:58.340
 terminator genesis because this is because 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:01.370
 james cameron the bullet and that is already 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:03.949
 Cameron endorses a movie that is not 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:06.320
 yours is something that you do not see all 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:07.700
 days or sometimes it happens and in fact to 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.530
 Sometimes the movie is not very good but 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.990
 for some reason he gets the fiber 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.280
 sensitive to james cameron in this case not 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.050
 It is because it touches the heartstrings 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.140
 but because for him it's actually a 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:20.690
 good film terminator 3 does not 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.580
 interested in the salvation ' experiment did not 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:25.000
 it interested neither but now what it says 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:28.220
 determined genesis is very curious says 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.280
 Terminator Genesis is the real 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.590
 terminator 3 I feel that the franchise has 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.259
 been rejuvenated that this is a 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.330
 rebirth in my head this is the 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:39.979
 third good movie now jumps the 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.570
 rumor because of the thorns that are 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:44.500
 planning transformers of what they plan 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:47.720
 Up to 12 more movies in the saga 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:50.090
 imminently thing that of course yes 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.070
 we have at the moment we have the one that 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.259
 would be one of bamberg and they would be 2 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.570
 transformers 5 would be 3 and if you plan on 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:57.400
 the sixth part would be 4 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:00.370
 more than optimal is plan that I give it for 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:04.120
 made there would be five movies where they are 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:05.979
 the other seven films become other 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.690
 seven more so of course they are a 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:09.310
 barbarity first posts of the 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.230
 movie of angry birds that as I already 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.000
 We knew they were going to do it and it's happened 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.980
 a lot of time but finally they have it already 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.660
 this new movie that they said is going to 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.370
 to be and also we already have the series 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.320
 already at the end arrived everything that we 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.940
 promised they got off this nursing and so 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.830
 It looks like a banana in this poster I do not know 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.480
 if it looked like banana ton in the movie 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.459
 or not but here it looks like a banana more than 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.560
 one bird then we have the other with the 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:31.120
 Gafitas and then we have the red protota 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.580
 of all life that is there as has 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:36.580
 pissed off a bird fits assassin's 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.080
 believe in a mobile phone so is the poster of the 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.390
 first movie that has been made of 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:43.209
 assassin's believe that you put the subtitle 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.470
 as a mobile subtitle that leaves 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.120
 pretty clear we're not talking 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.130
 of video games and does not have a movie 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.800
 although this way I do not like that much 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:53.230
 subtitle could be otherwise 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.989
 Well the fact is that this poster instead 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:58.810
 to see michael fassbender already dressed 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:00.070
 in Renaissance plan or whatever you touch on 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.540
 this movie 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.760
 we see an eagle 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.500
 one of the new images of star wars 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.659
 that we can see on some cans that there are 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.670
 in Mexico or something like that we can see 

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:11.950
 three cold with neither more nor less than a 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.409
 red arm red arm because carry 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.540
 to the red arm good for a reason that I 

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:18.819
 I can give you is because it is going to turn 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.459
 in ironman the next iron movie 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:23.470
 man will be starred by c3po and 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:26.260
 Of course, they are already preparing it 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:28.409
 as the prequel this episode 7 nothing 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.409
 plus 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.519
 yes 

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:43.200
 or maybe I have some other story that 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:45.360
 we'll see in the movie or maybe during 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.800
 these years it has simply broken the 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.300
 pieces to prepare what they have said hey 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.730
 which is that of gold as it is a 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:52.650
 little expensive and if we catch some silver 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.720
 and we painted it there in red 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:59.380
 I look, it can look nice 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:01.000
 Johnson is not stupid and since he's going to 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:03.760
 make the movie hit the little one 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.170
 China and that many know there are many 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.270
 fan of john carpenter in that he does not 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:09.220
 it seems good the a bit to appease 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:11.650
 people have said he could see the movie 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.630
 as a child and I loved it is a kind of 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.100
 cinema with which we have all grown up 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:17.290
 the argument fits perfectly with 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.150
 the characters was as if all 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:20.920
 they were in their place a great 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.930
 sensation and also said that neither more nor 

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:25.420
 least I wanted the director to be john 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:27.550
 carpenter for this new movie that 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:30.250
 make himself his remake of his own 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:32.950
 movie I do not know how this will take 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:35.140
 john carpenter but the truth is yes 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:36.730
 I managed to be yes that I would have loved already 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:38.680
 I would be the first one in line to see 

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:40.240
 that movie we thought that finally we 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.520
 we had gotten rid of the movie in 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.830
 real action of akira but we do not have 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.100
 that lucky Hollywood is stubborn but not 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:50.540
 power 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:53.000
 what happens now I hope it comes back to 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:55.100
 drop the whole sack broken and come back standby 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.830
 this movie and never do it for 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:05:02.290
 please for more you do not have cinema 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:02.290
 subscribe to the channel and I'll be back
