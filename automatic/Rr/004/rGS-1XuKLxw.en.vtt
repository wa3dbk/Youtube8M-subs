game and it's gone to record it in
hi-def<00:00:38.899> format<00:00:39.899> so<00:00:40.620> that'll<00:00:41.399> be<00:00:41.489> another

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
hi-def format so that'll be another

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.580 
hi-def format so that'll be another
video<00:00:42.000> how<00:00:42.149> to<00:00:42.210> get<00:00:42.390> that<00:00:42.780> high<00:00:42.989> def<00:00:43.170> format

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
video how to get that high def format

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.729 
video how to get that high def format
off<00:00:43.829> of<00:00:44.129> that<00:00:44.700> camera<00:00:45.000> but<00:00:45.239> it<00:00:45.329> is<00:00:45.450> possible

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:45.739 
off of that camera but it is possible

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:48.860 
off of that camera but it is possible
and<00:00:46.739> then<00:00:47.070> what<00:00:47.399> we<00:00:47.520> have<00:00:47.700> is<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.239> cannabis

and then what we have is the cannabis

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.869 
and then what we have is the cannabis
box<00:00:49.079> plugged<00:00:49.379> into<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.829> hard<00:00:50.280> drive<00:00:50.489> camera

directly<00:00:51.570> into<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.870> laptop<00:00:52.050> giving<00:00:52.500> us<00:00:52.620> the

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
directly into the laptop giving us the

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.160 
directly into the laptop giving us the
ability<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:53.340> not<00:00:53.489> only<00:00:53.610> code<00:00:53.940> lot<00:00:54.480> or<00:00:54.690> capture

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
ability to not only code lot or capture

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.779 
ability to not only code lot or capture
the<00:00:55.260> game<00:00:55.379> live<00:00:55.590> we<00:00:55.770> can<00:00:55.890> also<00:00:56.010> code<00:00:56.370> that<00:00:56.550> game

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
the game live we can also code that game

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.849 
the game live we can also code that game
live<00:00:57.030> so<00:00:57.809> while<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.320> game<00:00:58.440> is<00:00:58.469> being<00:00:58.680> played

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
live so while the game is being played

is<00:01:10.650> being<00:01:10.920> played<00:01:11.130> but<00:01:11.700> really<00:01:12.000> any<00:01:12.210> amount<00:01:12.689> of

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
is being played but really any amount of

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.350 
is being played but really any amount of
coding<00:01:13.229> is<00:01:13.380> a<00:01:13.439> huge<00:01:14.070> time<00:01:14.310> saver<00:01:14.610> plus<00:01:14.970> having

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
coding is a huge time saver plus having

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.080 
coding is a huge time saver plus having
that<00:01:15.509> game<00:01:15.750> on<00:01:15.990> there<00:01:16.290> is<00:01:16.439> again<00:01:17.340> huge<00:01:17.820> time

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
that game on there is again huge time

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.310 
that game on there is again huge time
saver<00:01:18.360> so<00:01:18.659> we're<00:01:18.810> going<00:01:18.900> to<00:01:18.990> show<00:01:19.049> you<00:01:19.110> how<00:01:19.200> to

saver so we're going to show you how to

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.499 
saver so we're going to show you how to
connect<00:01:19.650> that<00:01:19.799> up<00:01:19.830> and<00:01:20.100> hopefully<00:01:20.790> cover<00:01:21.270> some

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
connect that up and hopefully cover some

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.600 
connect that up and hopefully cover some
of<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.659> more<00:01:22.049> advantages<00:01:22.619> of<00:01:22.770> what<00:01:23.490> this

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
of the more advantages of what this

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.340 
of the more advantages of what this
gives<00:01:23.820> you<00:01:23.970> let's<00:01:24.810> take<00:01:24.930> a<00:01:24.990> look<00:01:25.200> at<00:01:25.259> the

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
gives you let's take a look at the

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.190 
gives you let's take a look at the
equipment

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200

our<00:02:58.280> camera<00:02:58.670> a<00:03:00.040> BBC<00:03:01.040> and<00:03:01.430> this<00:03:01.579> is<00:03:01.730> the<00:03:01.910> port

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:02.269 
our camera a BBC and this is the port

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:05.110 
our camera a BBC and this is the port
that<00:03:02.389> goes<00:03:02.630> from<00:03:02.989> the<00:03:03.109> camera<00:03:03.650> or<00:03:04.519> goes<00:03:04.790> to<00:03:05.000> the

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
that goes from the camera or goes to the

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.009 
that goes from the camera or goes to the
camera<00:03:05.799> show<00:03:06.799> you<00:03:06.859> where<00:03:07.069> that<00:03:07.100> goes<00:03:07.370> and

camera show you where that goes and

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:12.449 
camera show you where that goes and
finally<00:03:09.019> you'll<00:03:09.170> need<00:03:09.350> a<00:03:09.620> firewire<00:03:10.750> the<00:03:11.750> advc

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
finally you'll need a firewire the advc

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:15.520 
finally you'll need a firewire the advc
needs<00:03:13.459> a<00:03:13.760> 6-pin<00:03:14.329> you<00:03:14.480> can<00:03:14.599> also<00:03:14.720> get<00:03:14.930> a<00:03:14.989> 4-pin

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
needs a 6-pin you can also get a 4-pin

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.740 
needs a 6-pin you can also get a 4-pin
firewire<00:03:16.489> cable<00:03:17.090> and<00:03:17.269> then<00:03:17.389> the<00:03:17.599> newer

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
firewire cable and then the newer

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.589 
firewire cable and then the newer
laptops<00:03:18.319> need<00:03:18.709> this<00:03:19.239> connection<00:03:20.239> which<00:03:20.420> is<00:03:20.569> a

00:03:20.589 --> 00:03:20.599 
laptops need this connection which is a

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:23.979 
laptops need this connection which is a
9<00:03:21.319> pin<00:03:21.709> firewire<00:03:22.010> cable<00:03:22.670> so<00:03:23.239> again<00:03:23.660> for<00:03:23.690> this

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
9 pin firewire cable so again for this

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:25.990 
9 pin firewire cable so again for this
one<00:03:24.139> we<00:03:24.230> have<00:03:24.260> a<00:03:24.380> six<00:03:24.620> tonight<00:03:25.000> alright

00:06:15.499 --> 00:06:15.509 
obviously we have a little hard drive

00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:20.240 
obviously we have a little hard drive
camera<00:06:15.949> coming<00:06:16.949> directly<00:06:17.370> in<00:06:18.320> okay<00:06:19.320> now<00:06:19.979> let's
