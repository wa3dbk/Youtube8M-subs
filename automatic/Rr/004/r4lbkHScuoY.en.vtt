00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:09.910
 hello I'm josemarÃ­a from 1050 navona and today 

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:13.010
 we are going to teach you a very useful tool 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:15.740
 practice that has select area for 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:18.110
 help us choose the type of saddle that 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:20.120
 it will be more comfortable for us 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:23.800
 position for 

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:26.500
 our body type comes 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.269
 let's explain first that in this 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.429
 case the family the family of selle 

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:31.960
 italy has different types of seats 

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:34.480
 as we know it is a thing that 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.460
 bike users are very worried 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.129
 find the type of seat that goes 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:41.140
 to be comfortable is not a little plan to go 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:42.699
 trying different seats buy one 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.460
 try it then with this tool 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:46.839
 will help us a lot to choose within 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.350
 the large family of seats that there are in 

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:50.320
 the market 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.629
 in this case we find the stools are 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.180
 the small size the typical standard that 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:58.180
 round 130 millimeters wide and 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:00.579
 The l are the big size of a hundred the 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:04.269
 typical standard that is around 140 and peak 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:07.720
 millimeters in width and apart the 1 2 3 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:10.539
 1 2 3 tells us one without hole A 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:13.750
 seat that is not anti prostatic that 2 

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:15.759
 it would be small size with the middle hole 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:18.759
 and lately we are seeing in many 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:21.039
 seats with that 3 or the e3 with the 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:23.970
 pretty big hole like it could be 

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:26.229
 the example that we have 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.330
 much more comfortable allows us the 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:30.800
 circulation of blood through the perineum 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.090
 for people who are looking for an anti seating 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.070
 Prostate as it would be a very good 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:37.710
 good option 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.479
 this type of tool called and so on 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.860
 you have to go to a distributor 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.860
 official of selle italia 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.119
 we have this tool that through 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.650
 of the computer and the instruments that we 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.110
 provides is in italy we can take 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:54.299
 different measures that will help us 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.270
 to choose the type not the saddle but the 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.090
 type next thing we will 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:04.210
 to be more appropriate for our body 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:04.210
 well we are filling in the data 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:11.950
 if it is man and woman in this case 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.950
 we will talk to a man 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.240
 in kilometers traveled are some data 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:21.540
 that we will fill here in store for 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.100
 help us know what kind of seat 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.710
 we will be better depending on the seat 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:28.260
 that we have now and of the experience 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:31.080
 that we have with him, let's imagine what he does 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:35.060
 between 5 and 10 thousand kilometers takes between 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:38.020
 5 and 10 years old saddle brand 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:40.270
 I could be a physicist 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:42.420
 of degree of satisfaction we do not want 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:47.080
 change because we are not at all comfortable 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:50.890
 next step we indicate the height 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:52.520
 the user indicates the weight about 70 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.100
 kilos 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.910
 and at this point we are going to start the 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:01.070
 first important measurement with which 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:03.740
 we will use this tool to measure 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:06.790
 the width of both the hip 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:06.790
 help from miguel 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.489
 the world beyond 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:20.920
 let's take the measure in the bones 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:23.310
 trochanter which are the widest point of 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.310
 the hip 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:30.269
 we have the measure 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:34.219
 we see it here that is 34 and a half we are going to 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:38.420
 enter it here in millimeters 340 345 

00:03:34.219 --> 00:03:38.420
 and we went to the next point 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:44.489
 the next measurement the next 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:48.720
 measurement is the circumference of 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:51.500
 muscles of the thighs well this measure 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:55.790
 we have to do it almost in the gluteus 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:58.629
 ok let's take the measurement 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.629
 and we have 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:05.420
 56 you have to take both these legs 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.420
 right 

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:12.530
 you have to tighten well 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.100
 in this case you have to take both 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:17.610
 legs 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:23.640
 in this case it has the same measure is 56 

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:25.230
 in the two legs 560 560 we went to 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.760
 next step sometimes happens to us that of 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:29.310
 tighten much more with one leg than with 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:32.000
 another we have a bigger leg than 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:37.020
 the other after the next measurement 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:42.520
 we reserve the angle meter 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:45.180
 with work and then we will take this 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.180
 measurement here 

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:48.919
 we have 0 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:56.780
 we will measure 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:59.620
 this part of here we do it 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:02.080
 correctly from this side 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:05.729
 give us 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:07.650
 47 48 degrees 

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:11.520
 depending on the elasticity that 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:13.139
 we have in this in this measure we are going to 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:14.759
 need a seat or another because we're going 

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:16.529
 to support in one part or another of the 

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:18.810
 that's why this measure is one of the 

00:05:16.529 --> 00:05:20.850
 more important 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:23.950
 we passed and here we have a summary of 

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:28.270
 all height data 

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:30.490
 the weight and so on is from here to another 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:32.080
 centric is the width of the two 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:35.410
 thighs and degrees of inclination 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:39.610
 pelvic in this case its ideal category 

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:42.490
 it is the l1 the own segi tal page and 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:44.530
 gives us some examples of seats of this 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:46.360
 category but if for example we enter 

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:50.940
 on our page be king point we put 

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:54.210
 the e1 we will be able to perform the search 

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:56.770
 of the seat types of sella italy 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:59.230
 that fall within this family of 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:01.240
 this category and therefore what is going 

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:03.190
 to help is simply to close a little 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:05.230
 plus the range between all types of 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:07.750
 seat that in the market close a little 

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:10.980
 plus the fan and try to find the 

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:10.980
 seat of our type 

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:17.169
 tools 

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:19.689
 I do not know 

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:22.050
 it's easy and nothing awaits you in our 

00:06:19.689 --> 00:06:24.599
 store picking point to 

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:27.379
 measurements and helps the many actors 

00:06:24.599 --> 00:06:27.379
 thanks and see you soon
