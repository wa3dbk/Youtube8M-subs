00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:10.940
 welcome everyone to the channel 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:12.860
 computer store campain 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.990
 today we want to show you the system 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.630
 which we have recently acquired 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.789
 this is a powerful render station system 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.279
 You can order the same system 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:24.140
 through an online consultant on the website 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:26.839
 link in the description or you can 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:29.210
 see a similar configuration on the site 

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:32.360
 again the link to which we will post 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:34.579
 in the description, well, let's proceed to the review 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.370
 and since I already said the system was 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:40.190
 assembled mainly for video rendering and 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:42.620
 to work in 3d applications and begin 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:46.280
 review as usual from the body is all that 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:48.019
 the same top corsair 780 t I do not know what the 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.750
 trend but nonetheless practically 

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:53.329
 all now top computer going 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:56.140
 it is in this package of video as 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:59.390
 I already said three pieces installed gtx 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:01.609
 980ti they are reference so even 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.300
 despite such a tight installation 

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:04.970
 not less 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.980
 airflow and temperature conditions will be 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.930
 more or less adequate air 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:11.840
 sucked not only through the turbine 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:14.630
 bottom but also there is a hole in the back there 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:17.150
 cold air is also drawn in if 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.880
 it would not be reference cards with 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:22.630
 air intake only from the bottom it was all 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:26.390
 the processor would be much worse here too 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:29.090
 the corresponding is intel core i7 5960 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:32.090
 x extreme edition let me remind you of eight 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:35.420
 cores with a frequency of 3 gigahertz cache third 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:37.700
 level here as much as 20 megabytes and in total 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.280
 the difficulty here is 16 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.259
 computational flow cooled it 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.560
 finished water cooling system 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:47.840
 cooler master nepton 280l 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.360
 here is a big radiator designed for 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.549
 fitting two and 140 millimeter 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:56.360
 fans motherboard here 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:59.079
 gigabyte x99 in d5 with built-in wi-fi 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:02.090
 module and backlit ports 

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:05.119
 RAM is 32 gigabytes 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:07.460
 this is kingston hyper x fury here 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:10.250
 two separate ssd drives are installed 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.140
 that is, not in a sandisk raid and 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.240
 unfortunately I can not exact volume 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.130
 to tell 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.320
 Well, the power supply here, of course, too 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.360
 the corresponding block is set 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:22.330
 thermaltake company 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.850
 model and a half kilowatt 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:27.220
 it may seem like a lot to someone 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:30.690
 but nevertheless, if we estimate that three 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:34.330
 reference 980ti in total give 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:37.750
 750 watts tdp plus one hundred forty watts 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:40.300
 processors plus 100 watts top on all 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.850
 the rest of that turns out almost 1 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.800
 kilowatt power consumption and this with 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:47.470
 considering that everything will be in stock 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.630
 mode and without overclocking so one and a half 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.930
 kilowatt I think given the small 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:54.730
 Acceleration is the most it is such a powerful 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:58.210
 the computer turned out in total 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:01.690
 here are 16 compute threads three 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:04.480
 top 1 chip video cards with 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:07.660
 a storage capacity of 6 GB for two whole 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:10.090
 ssd drive top case block 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.820
 power and a half kilowatt 32 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:15.340
 gigabytes of memory and top maternal 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:17.440
 the board is such a powerful one 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.020
 render station but I have everything today 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.670

 monthly are played different 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:29.590
 interesting prizes
