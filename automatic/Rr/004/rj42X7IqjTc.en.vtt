00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.170
 such effervescence 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.719
 here you touch nothing at all but at 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.770
 nothing else you have to smash everything in 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.320
 the trick and not their confreres 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.930
 talent and for first of all referred in 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.340
 good settings all that there you do it 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.500
 watch out for the channels will capture one 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.660
 laetitia screenshot the world knows this 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.719
 that it's in my opinion yes everyone 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.519
 is a screenshot fact we 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.439
 sees his capture your screen in a photo 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.990
 by a video or a photo it's not 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.620
 photo so there we can assign 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:15.020
 participate the key we want example 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:19.130
 7-8 of a 5 as you want me I have 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:23.180
 nothing since this one shot of sims that is going 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:24.890
 we're interested in these videos capture then 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:29.780
 there you assign a touch a video 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:32.780
 capture here I like nine videos 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:37.070
 good format if you want the pure and hard 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:39.020
 of those of the video finally all without 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.540
 change take back n compressor 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.010
 I take mjpg compression because 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.930
 I do not have much room in my 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.550
 Hard disk 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:50.150
 the quality - at but 85 otherwise it's me 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.840
 do too gay pride 1080p this is the 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.970
 quality too 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:59.479
 finally for this ninth rank I take 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:02:01.670
 two days closes at 30 pc a little the 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:03.960
 minimum of effects is what it takes and 60 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.540
 the limit so 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.100
 it's me I put 30 and 60 because 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.679
 my pc is not a race of beast 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.910
 more so there is the folder you 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:16.170
 want m 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:19.260
 your videos en suite here you touch to 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:22.700
 nothing at all here video capture 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:25.470
 own compatibility and idg why 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.260
 heinous capture property so that's it 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.420
 it's important to film your voice 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:33.210
 save your weight click there you 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.730
 have in direction of capture davis stop 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:38.490
 you click here renÃ© microphone high 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.620
 finally definition your entry your 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.570
 collection that you save in the past 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.120
 actually where I integrated in the pc or 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:46.380
 it's a headset so microphone then 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.610
 downstairs for the speakers for 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:54.630
 hear the game and the ways on skype 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:56.100
 and all that so take wasabi live 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.080
 called mark davies and take high 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.220
 speakers or game what serves you to 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.990
 put the sound but in general it's the 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.900
 loudspeaker you sleep tick you tick 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:06.930
 both there and you put stereo ripper 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.850
 so the hockey primacy is normally 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.160
 the site works perfectly there is 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:14.850
 no complaints at all c 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:17.090
