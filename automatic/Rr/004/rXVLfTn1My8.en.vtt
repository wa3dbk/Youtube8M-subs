I<00:01:00.059> think<00:01:00.420> in<00:01:00.629> my<00:01:01.050> opinion<00:01:01.079> was<00:01:01.920> that<00:01:02.090> it<00:01:03.090> didn't

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
I think in my opinion was that it didn't

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.800 
I think in my opinion was that it didn't
feel<00:01:03.750> like<00:01:03.809> Psychopaths<00:01:04.589> I<00:01:04.860> mean<00:01:05.810> psychopath

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
in itself to me is like a sci-fi science

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.340 
in itself to me is like a sci-fi science
fiction<00:01:10.200> thriller<00:01:10.950> type<00:01:11.400> of<00:01:11.610> movie<00:01:11.939> or<00:01:12.150> a

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
fiction thriller type of movie or a

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.679 
fiction thriller type of movie or a
series<00:01:13.350> but<00:01:14.100> this<00:01:14.820> movie<00:01:15.180> felt<00:01:15.420> more<00:01:15.570> like

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
series but this movie felt more like

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.730 
series but this movie felt more like
pure<00:01:16.170> action<00:01:16.670> which<00:01:17.670> is<00:01:17.790> fine<00:01:18.740> hugely

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
pure action which is fine hugely

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.730 
pure action which is fine hugely

was nothing it didn't feel like a drag
at<00:01:25.140> all<00:01:25.290> but<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.400> biggest<00:01:26.610> problem<00:01:26.909> was<00:01:27.330> that

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
at all but the biggest problem was that

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.560 
at all but the biggest problem was that

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
like the movie focus too much on the

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.120 
like the movie focus too much on the
action<00:01:32.909> on<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:33.930> side<00:01:34.320> character<00:01:34.829> is<00:01:34.950> other
