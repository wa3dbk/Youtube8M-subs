00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
you can see it behind I think there's a

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.730 
you can see it behind I think there's a
fight<00:00:26.820> I<00:00:27.060> think<00:00:27.150> it's<00:00:27.359> called<00:00:27.539> a<00:00:27.660> folding<00:00:28.140> tank

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
fight I think it's called a folding tank

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.589 
fight I think it's called a folding tank
transporter<00:00:29.490> then<00:00:29.670> next<00:00:30.000> to<00:00:30.210> that<00:00:30.330> there's

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
transporter then next to that there's

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.080 
transporter then next to that there's
actually<00:00:30.929> a<00:00:30.960> small<00:00:31.590> tank<00:00:31.949> see<00:00:32.520> me<00:00:32.669> served<00:00:32.940> in

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
station it really could be made of

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.440 
station it really could be made of
anything<00:00:43.890> you've<00:00:44.160> got<00:00:44.190> at<00:00:44.430> home<00:00:44.460> but<00:00:45.329> your

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
mixture of a sugar solution which is one

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.779 
mixture of a sugar solution which is one
part<00:00:57.510> sugar<00:00:57.840> to<00:00:58.260> 4<00:00:58.469> parts<00:00:58.859> boiling<00:00:59.219> water<00:00:59.430> and

so<00:01:07.350> so<00:01:08.159> we're<00:01:08.760> just<00:01:08.790> options<00:01:09.299> right<00:01:09.659> we've<00:01:09.869> got

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
so so we're just options right we've got

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.750 
so so we're just options right we've got
this<00:01:10.290> one<00:01:10.530> which<00:01:10.680> we<00:01:11.189> hopes<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.549> better

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
this one which we hopes the better

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.539 
this one which we hopes the better
option<00:01:12.150> of<00:01:12.270> nice<00:01:12.750> bright<00:01:13.049> plate<00:01:13.409> I've<00:01:14.130> just<00:01:14.369> a

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
option of nice bright plate I've just a

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.359 
option of nice bright plate I've just a
coordinate<00:01:15.390> I<00:01:15.630> actually<00:01:16.470> drilled<00:01:16.740> four<00:01:17.040> small

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
coordinate I actually drilled four small

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.330 
coordinate I actually drilled four small
holes<00:01:17.640> in<00:01:17.880> it<00:01:18.030> you<00:01:18.600> could<00:01:18.810> I<00:01:19.049> guess<00:01:19.380> not<00:01:20.159> in<00:01:20.280> the

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
holes in it you could I guess not in the

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.940 
holes in it you could I guess not in the
kitchen<00:01:20.520> putting<00:01:21.060> it<00:01:21.299> in<00:01:21.450> your<00:01:21.840> garage<00:01:21.960> bang

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
kitchen putting it in your garage bang

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.350 
kitchen putting it in your garage bang
it<00:01:23.100> through<00:01:23.310> with<00:01:23.460> a<00:01:23.490> nail<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:24.000> a<00:01:24.030> hammer<00:01:24.060> and

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
it through with a nail and a hammer and

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.999 
it through with a nail and a hammer and
that'll<00:01:24.930> make<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.200> hole<00:01:25.380> or<00:01:25.770> you<00:01:25.830> could

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
that'll make the hole or you could

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.039 
that'll make the hole or you could
always<00:01:26.130> use<00:01:26.340> a<00:01:26.369> paper<00:01:26.580> plate<00:01:26.939> which<00:01:27.810> would<00:01:27.960> be

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
always use a paper plate which would be

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.810 
always use a paper plate which would be
a<00:01:28.080> safer<00:01:28.500> option<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:29.159> that'd<00:01:29.400> be<00:01:29.520> quite<00:01:29.700> good

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
a safer option and that'd be quite good

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.160 
a safer option and that'd be quite good
for<00:01:29.880> young<00:01:30.150> kids<00:01:30.390> because<00:01:30.659> then<00:01:30.780> they<00:01:30.900> can<00:01:31.020> get

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
for young kids because then they can get

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.050 
for young kids because then they can get
involved<00:01:31.439> and<00:01:31.829> then<00:01:32.250> that<00:01:32.460> will<00:01:32.610> just<00:01:32.790> hold

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
involved and then that will just hold

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.740 
involved and then that will just hold
the<00:01:33.329> food<00:01:33.509> inside<00:01:33.960> yes<00:01:34.770> I<00:01:34.950> actually<00:01:35.720> put<00:01:36.720> a

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
the food inside yes I actually put a

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.980 
the food inside yes I actually put a
length<00:01:36.930> of<00:01:37.110> string<00:01:37.350> tie<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.280> knot<00:01:38.549> on<00:01:38.579> it

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
length of string tie the knot on it

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.990 
length of string tie the knot on it
straight<00:01:39.990> over<00:01:40.470> and<00:01:40.680> then<00:01:41.369> tied<00:01:41.640> a<00:01:41.670> knot<00:01:41.880> in

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
straight over and then tied a knot in

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.300 
straight over and then tied a knot in
the<00:01:42.090> far<00:01:42.329> end<00:01:42.570> so<00:01:42.840> I've<00:01:42.930> got<00:01:43.079> a<00:01:43.110> loop<00:01:43.350> there<00:01:43.649> now

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
the far end so I've got a loop there now

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.700 
the far end so I've got a loop there now
did<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.729> same<00:01:44.970> with<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.020> other<00:01:46.229> one<00:01:46.470> but<00:01:46.649> I

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
did the same with the other one but I

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.090 
did the same with the other one but I
just<00:01:47.100> Adam<00:01:47.399> round<00:01:47.610> so<00:01:47.880> they<00:01:48.060> now<00:01:48.270> and<00:01:49.100> fairly

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
just Adam round so they now and fairly

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.520 
just Adam round so they now and fairly
straight<00:01:50.460> fairly<00:01:50.880> level<00:01:51.060> at<00:01:51.270> home<00:01:51.500> make<00:01:52.500> it

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
straight fairly level at home make it

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:53.840 
straight fairly level at home make it
straight<00:01:52.950> as<00:01:53.070> you<00:01:53.130> can<00:01:53.340> but<00:01:53.490> then<00:01:53.640> that's

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
straight as you can but then that's

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.490 
straight as you can but then that's
that's<00:01:54.119> pretty<00:01:54.329> good<00:01:54.540> I'll<00:01:54.810> let<00:01:54.840> you<00:01:55.020> off<00:01:55.170> look

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
that's pretty good I'll let you off look

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.929 
that's pretty good I'll let you off look
at<00:01:55.590> that<00:01:55.770> plates<00:01:56.009> good<00:01:56.219> cuz<00:01:56.340> it's<00:01:56.430> gone<00:01:56.549> I<00:01:56.700> slip

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
at that plates good cuz it's gone I slip

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.510 
at that plates good cuz it's gone I slip
on<00:01:57.060> so<00:01:57.659> get<00:01:57.810> that<00:01:57.840> stuff<00:01:58.320> in<00:01:58.439> there<00:01:58.619> yeah<00:01:59.009> we're

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
on so get that stuff in there yeah we're

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.920 
on so get that stuff in there yeah we're
going<00:01:59.670> to<00:01:59.729> put<00:01:59.850> a<00:01:59.880> pot<00:02:00.180> in<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.479> middle<00:02:00.750> of<00:02:00.810> this

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
going to put a pot in the middle of this

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.350 
going to put a pot in the middle of this
which<00:02:01.259> is<00:02:01.290> just<00:02:01.670> really<00:02:02.670> an<00:02:02.850> old<00:02:02.969> allow

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
which is just really an old allow

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.850 
which is just really an old allow
stretch<00:02:03.689> about<00:02:03.869> it<00:02:03.960> was<00:02:04.049> a<00:02:04.110> cream<00:02:04.380> pot<00:02:04.649> but<00:02:04.799> a

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
stretch about it was a cream pot but a

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.340 
stretch about it was a cream pot but a
yogurt<00:02:05.189> pot<00:02:05.399> would<00:02:05.610> do<00:02:05.790> we've<00:02:06.600> got<00:02:06.630> some<00:02:07.020> some

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
yogurt pot would do we've got some some

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.740 
yogurt pot would do we've got some some
paper<00:02:07.590> towel<00:02:07.950> in<00:02:08.190> here<00:02:08.489> we<00:02:09.000> could<00:02:09.179> use<00:02:09.420> a

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
paper towel in here we could use a

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.260 
paper towel in here we could use a
Goody's<00:02:10.530> cotton<00:02:10.879> probably<00:02:11.879> your<00:02:12.000> best<00:02:12.090> bet

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
Goody's cotton probably your best bet

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.790 
Goody's cotton probably your best bet
but<00:02:12.510> we<00:02:12.629> hadn't<00:02:12.870> got<00:02:12.989> any<00:02:13.140> so<00:02:13.349> we're<00:02:13.470> gonna<00:02:13.560> try

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
but we hadn't got any so we're gonna try

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.100 
but we hadn't got any so we're gonna try
some<00:02:14.040> kitchen<00:02:14.580> roll<00:02:14.610> see<00:02:15.060> what<00:02:15.270> happens<00:02:15.599> and

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
some kitchen roll see what happens and

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.780 
some kitchen roll see what happens and
then<00:02:16.260> dad's<00:02:16.500> secret<00:02:16.739> weapon<00:02:17.190> on<00:02:17.280> top<00:02:17.580> I've

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
then dad's secret weapon on top I've

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.430 
then dad's secret weapon on top I've
actually<00:02:18.209> cheated<00:02:18.690> somewhat<00:02:19.080> because<00:02:19.290> this

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
actually cheated somewhat because this

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.520 
actually cheated somewhat because this
is<00:02:19.560> a<00:02:19.590> duty<00:02:19.980> I<00:02:20.310> do<00:02:20.400> be<00:02:20.879> a<00:02:20.910> trout<00:02:21.209> fishing<00:02:21.510> and<00:02:22.110> so

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
is a duty I do be a trout fishing and so

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.020 
is a duty I do be a trout fishing and so
this<00:02:22.680> is<00:02:22.830> some<00:02:22.980> stuff<00:02:23.220> I<00:02:23.340> use<00:02:23.489> for<00:02:23.700> tie<00:02:23.879> and

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
this is some stuff I use for tie and

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.150 
this is some stuff I use for tie and
child<00:02:24.239> fly<00:02:24.480> so<00:02:24.750> it's<00:02:24.900> called<00:02:25.110> chenille<00:02:25.560> this

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
child fly so it's called chenille this

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.280 
child fly so it's called chenille this
is<00:02:26.280> quite<00:02:26.550> bright<00:02:26.879> and<00:02:27.599> the<00:02:27.810> stuff<00:02:28.050> on<00:02:28.170> the

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
is quite bright and the stuff on the

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.830 
is quite bright and the stuff on the
outside<00:02:28.459> is<00:02:29.459> actually<00:02:29.670> what's<00:02:30.360> called<00:02:30.540> cactus

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
outside is actually what's called cactus

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.610 
outside is actually what's called cactus
chenille<00:02:31.440> but<00:02:32.010> it's<00:02:32.129> got<00:02:32.310> UV<00:02:32.760> in<00:02:32.970> which<00:02:33.470> not<00:02:34.470> so

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
chenille but it's got UV in which not so

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.890 
chenille but it's got UV in which not so
Laura<00:02:34.860> tells<00:02:35.160> me<00:02:35.430> yeah<00:02:35.640> butterflies<00:02:36.450> can<00:02:36.720> see

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
Laura tells me yeah butterflies can see

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.140 
Laura tells me yeah butterflies can see
in<00:02:37.080> UV<00:02:37.470> so<00:02:37.830> anything<00:02:38.400> that's<00:02:38.640> going<00:02:38.879> to<00:02:38.940> really

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
in UV so anything that's going to really

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.610 
in UV so anything that's going to really
attract<00:02:39.480> them<00:02:39.660> those<00:02:39.810> bright<00:02:40.080> colors<00:02:40.110> is<00:02:40.590> what

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
attract them those bright colors is what

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.860 
attract them those bright colors is what
they<00:02:40.860> go<00:02:41.040> for<00:02:41.069> so<00:02:41.879> hopefully<00:02:42.330> with<00:02:42.480> this<00:02:42.629> with

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
they go for so hopefully with this with

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.059 
they go for so hopefully with this with
this<00:02:42.989> having<00:02:43.260> UV

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
this having UV

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:45.770 
this having UV
it's<00:02:44.519> going<00:02:44.730> to<00:02:44.790> really<00:02:45.000> attract<00:02:45.360> them<00:02:45.599> and

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
it's going to really attract them and

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.780 
it's going to really attract them and
they're<00:02:46.050> going<00:02:46.230> to<00:02:46.290> stick<00:02:46.769> to<00:02:46.920> that<00:02:47.040> so<00:02:47.700> we're

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
they're going to stick to that so we're

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:48.710 
they're going to stick to that so we're
going<00:02:47.879> to<00:02:47.970> put<00:02:48.120> the<00:02:48.180> fruit<00:02:48.360> around<00:02:48.599> the

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
going to put the fruit around the

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:49.280 
going to put the fruit around the
outside

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
outside

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.110 
outside
yep<00:02:49.560> so<00:02:49.920> what<00:02:50.069> we<00:02:50.160> want<00:02:50.310> to<00:02:50.340> do<00:02:50.459> this<00:02:50.670> one<00:02:50.910> is

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
yep so what we want to do this one is

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.600 
yep so what we want to do this one is
first<00:02:51.840> off<00:02:52.050> glue<00:02:52.560> this<00:02:52.800> pot<00:02:53.069> because<00:02:53.430> although

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
first off glue this pot because although

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.160 
first off glue this pot because although
in<00:02:53.970> this<00:02:54.150> one<00:02:54.360> we<00:02:54.510> found<00:02:54.540> something<00:02:54.900> a<00:02:55.019> bit

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
in this one we found something a bit

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.229 
in this one we found something a bit
heavier<00:02:55.500> this<00:02:56.160> pot<00:02:56.430> will<00:02:56.550> obviously<00:02:56.730> float

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
heavier this pot will obviously float

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:59.059 
heavier this pot will obviously float
around<00:02:57.420> a<00:02:57.690> bit<00:02:57.840> so<00:02:58.319> dad's<00:02:58.560> just<00:02:58.739> going<00:02:58.920> to<00:02:58.980> use

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069 
around a bit so dad's just going to use

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:00.470 
around a bit so dad's just going to use
a<00:02:59.099> bit<00:02:59.220> of<00:02:59.250> no<00:02:59.459> more<00:02:59.580> nails<00:02:59.879> but<00:03:00.180> you<00:03:00.300> could

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
a bit of no more nails but you could

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.690 
a bit of no more nails but you could
probably<00:03:00.629> get<00:03:01.110> away<00:03:01.200> with<00:03:01.319> PVA<00:03:02.099> just

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
probably get away with PVA just

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.960 
probably get away with PVA just
something<00:03:02.970> like<00:03:03.180> quite<00:03:03.659> lightweight<00:03:03.870> and

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
something like quite lightweight and

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.610 
something like quite lightweight and
putting<00:03:05.970> that<00:03:06.060> in<00:03:06.209> the<00:03:06.330> centre<00:03:06.780> will<00:03:07.470> then

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
putting that in the centre will then

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.890 
putting that in the centre will then
fill<00:03:08.129> this<00:03:08.310> solution<00:03:08.670> as<00:03:09.239> near<00:03:09.420> as<00:03:09.450> the<00:03:09.629> centre

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
fill this solution as near as the centre

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.720 
fill this solution as near as the centre
is<00:03:09.959> you<00:03:10.080> can<00:03:10.230> bats<00:03:10.440> chrysalis<00:03:10.980> that's<00:03:11.580> a

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
is you can bats chrysalis that's a

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.170 
is you can bats chrysalis that's a
that's<00:03:12.030> a<00:03:12.209> fair<00:03:12.450> order<00:03:13.519> and<00:03:14.519> then<00:03:14.760> I'll<00:03:15.000> put

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
that's a fair order and then I'll put

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.449 
that's a fair order and then I'll put
that<00:03:15.269> in<00:03:15.330> the<00:03:15.480> center<00:03:15.890> you<00:03:16.890> want<00:03:17.010> to<00:03:17.190> re<00:03:17.280> wait

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
that in the center you want to re wait

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:18.740 
that in the center you want to re wait
for<00:03:17.610> your<00:03:17.730> solution<00:03:18.030> to<00:03:18.330> cool<00:03:18.540> down

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
for your solution to cool down

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:19.790 
for your solution to cool down
especially<00:03:19.019> if<00:03:19.290> you're<00:03:19.409> doing<00:03:19.590> this<00:03:19.739> with

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 
especially if you're doing this with

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.460 
especially if you're doing this with
young<00:03:20.099> children<00:03:20.610> but<00:03:21.569> we<00:03:21.690> can<00:03:21.900> chop<00:03:22.200> up<00:03:22.230> our

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
young children but we can chop up our

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:23.899 
young children but we can chop up our
fruit<00:03:22.739> I've<00:03:22.890> chopped<00:03:23.159> up<00:03:23.280> a<00:03:23.400> few<00:03:23.580> little<00:03:23.670> bits

00:03:23.899 --> 00:03:23.909 
fruit I've chopped up a few little bits

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:26.240 
fruit I've chopped up a few little bits
and<00:03:24.030> pieces<00:03:24.090> here<00:03:24.650> butterflies<00:03:25.650> are<00:03:25.680> anything

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
and pieces here butterflies are anything

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:27.470 
and pieces here butterflies are anything
that's<00:03:26.400> got<00:03:26.489> a<00:03:26.549> really<00:03:26.790> high<00:03:26.940> sugar<00:03:27.299> content

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
that's got a really high sugar content

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:28.759 
that's got a really high sugar content
so<00:03:27.989> button

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
so button

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:31.520 
so button
bananas<00:03:29.730> are<00:03:29.849> really<00:03:29.879> good<00:03:30.330> grapes<00:03:30.900> grapes

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
bananas are really good grapes grapes

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.649 
bananas are really good grapes grapes
yeah<00:03:31.950> and<00:03:32.250> if<00:03:32.610> you've<00:03:32.849> got<00:03:32.970> any<00:03:33.180> fruit<00:03:33.360> trees

00:03:33.649 --> 00:03:33.659 
yeah and if you've got any fruit trees

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:35.240 
yeah and if you've got any fruit trees
in<00:03:33.750> the<00:03:33.840> garden<00:03:34.230> and<00:03:34.349> often<00:03:34.650> you're<00:03:34.769> fine<00:03:35.010> to

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
in the garden and often you're fine to

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:36.619 
in the garden and often you're fine to
the<00:03:35.340> fruit<00:03:35.549> that<00:03:35.580> force<00:03:35.970> the<00:03:36.209> grounds<00:03:36.540> that

00:03:36.619 --> 00:03:36.629 
the fruit that force the grounds that

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:37.850 
the fruit that force the grounds that
you<00:03:36.720> don't<00:03:36.870> get<00:03:37.019> more<00:03:37.170> time<00:03:37.379> that<00:03:37.709> would<00:03:37.830> be

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
you don't get more time that would be

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.479 
you don't get more time that would be
perfect<00:03:38.640> so<00:03:39.599> we<00:03:40.080> can<00:03:40.290> put<00:03:40.920> some<00:03:41.099> of<00:03:41.159> these<00:03:41.250> bits

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
perfect so we can put some of these bits

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:44.839 
perfect so we can put some of these bits
around<00:03:42.980> this<00:03:43.980> is<00:03:44.099> going<00:03:44.250> to<00:03:44.310> be<00:03:44.370> a<00:03:44.400> big<00:03:44.580> test

00:03:44.839 --> 00:03:44.849 
around this is going to be a big test

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:47.059 
around this is going to be a big test
when<00:03:45.090> I<00:03:45.120> lift<00:03:45.330> this<00:03:45.480> up<00:03:45.659> I<00:03:45.870> know<00:03:45.959> it'll<00:03:46.739> fall

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:47.069 
when I lift this up I know it'll fall

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:49.789 
when I lift this up I know it'll fall
off<00:03:47.099> on<00:03:47.430> it<00:03:47.580> and<00:03:48.090> then<00:03:48.540> using<00:03:49.379> this<00:03:49.470> super

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
off on it and then using this super

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:52.399 
off on it and then using this super
slick<00:03:50.010> Jonas<00:03:50.310> put<00:03:50.519> that<00:03:50.610> on<00:03:50.670> note<00:03:51.209> right<00:03:51.510> just

00:03:52.399 --> 00:03:52.409 
slick Jonas put that on note right just

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:57.640 
slick Jonas put that on note right just
you<00:03:52.650> pour<00:03:53.159> that<00:03:53.189> in<00:03:53.689> I'd<00:03:54.689> be<00:03:54.900> the<00:03:54.959> spoon<00:03:55.319> but<00:03:55.530> no

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
you pour that in I'd be the spoon but no

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.140 
you pour that in I'd be the spoon but no
and<00:03:58.650> you<00:03:59.010> want<00:03:59.189> to<00:03:59.340> put<00:03:59.519> some<00:03:59.730> of<00:03:59.760> the<00:03:59.909> sugar

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
and you want to put some of the sugar

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.000 
and you want to put some of the sugar
solution<00:04:00.330> around<00:04:01.200> on<00:04:01.349> the<00:04:01.439> plate<00:04:01.680> as<00:04:01.860> well

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
solution around on the plate as well

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.199 
solution around on the plate as well
that's<00:04:02.220> why<00:04:02.340> it's<00:04:02.459> good<00:04:02.640> if<00:04:02.730> it's<00:04:02.879> got<00:04:03.000> a<00:04:03.030> bit

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
that's why it's good if it's got a bit

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:05.390 
that's why it's good if it's got a bit
of<00:04:03.330> a<00:04:03.390> lip<00:04:03.629> that's<00:04:04.080> soaked<00:04:04.439> in<00:04:04.650> really<00:04:04.920> nice<00:04:05.099> so

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
of a lip that's soaked in really nice so

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.620 
of a lip that's soaked in really nice so
that's

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 
that's

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.390 
that's
I<00:04:06.660> think<00:04:07.380> I'll<00:04:07.500> just<00:04:07.620> try<00:04:07.860> and<00:04:07.920> hold<00:04:08.070> it<00:04:08.280> up

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
I think I'll just try and hold it up

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.760 
I think I'll just try and hold it up
first<00:04:08.640> before<00:04:08.850> I<00:04:09.060> am<00:04:09.420> poor<00:04:09.990> go<00:04:10.170> any<00:04:10.320> further<00:04:10.500> I

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:10.770 
first before I am poor go any further I

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:13.400 
first before I am poor go any further I
see<00:04:10.950> what<00:04:11.070> happens<00:04:11.630> this<00:04:12.630> is<00:04:12.690> the<00:04:12.810> first<00:04:13.140> time

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
see what happens this is the first time

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:18.350 
see what happens this is the first time
I<00:04:13.590> totally<00:04:14.040> unrehearsed<00:04:14.390> here<00:04:15.390> we<00:04:15.480> go<00:04:15.660> oh<00:04:17.360> look

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:18.360 
I totally unrehearsed here we go oh look

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:20.240 
I totally unrehearsed here we go oh look
at<00:04:18.510> that<00:04:18.630> perfect<00:04:19.380> oh<00:04:19.410> my<00:04:19.709> normal<00:04:20.040> saying

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
at that perfect oh my normal saying

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.000 
at that perfect oh my normal saying
would<00:04:20.370> be<00:04:20.459> like<00:04:20.580> a<00:04:20.610> Swiss<00:04:20.970> watch<00:04:21.560> there<00:04:22.560> you<00:04:22.620> go

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
would be like a Swiss watch there you go

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:24.800 
would be like a Swiss watch there you go
so<00:04:23.430> we<00:04:23.520> can<00:04:23.640> we<00:04:23.850> can<00:04:23.880> actually<00:04:24.090> hang<00:04:24.570> that<00:04:24.750> up

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
so we can we can actually hang that up

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.080 
so we can we can actually hang that up
and<00:04:25.260> then<00:04:25.800> just<00:04:26.070> put<00:04:26.160> some<00:04:26.460> solution<00:04:26.880> round

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
and then just put some solution round

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:30.020 
and then just put some solution round
here<00:04:27.390> and<00:04:27.630> we<00:04:28.380> do<00:04:28.590> for<00:04:29.400> all<00:04:29.490> the<00:04:29.670> all<00:04:29.850> the

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
here and we do for all the all the

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:31.520 
here and we do for all the all the
butterflies<00:04:30.720> to<00:04:30.930> come<00:04:31.080> along

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
butterflies to come along

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.650 
butterflies to come along
we<00:04:31.920> hope<00:04:32.100> I<00:04:32.340> don't<00:04:32.460> know<00:04:32.820> what<00:04:33.030> if<00:04:33.150> this<00:04:33.270> one<00:04:33.540> we

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
we hope I don't know what if this one we

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:34.850 
we hope I don't know what if this one we
aren't<00:04:33.780> quite<00:04:33.900> finished<00:04:34.260> it<00:04:34.410> yet<00:04:34.560> but<00:04:34.740> we've

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
aren't quite finished it yet but we've

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.980 
aren't quite finished it yet but we've
actually<00:04:35.010> used<00:04:35.520> just<00:04:35.790> a<00:04:35.880> kitchen<00:04:36.060> sponge<00:04:36.360> and

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
actually used just a kitchen sponge and

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:38.780 
actually used just a kitchen sponge and
they're<00:04:37.230> really<00:04:37.350> good<00:04:37.530> for<00:04:37.590> absorbing<00:04:38.220> up<00:04:38.640> the

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:38.790 
they're really good for absorbing up the

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:40.550 
they're really good for absorbing up the
liquid<00:04:38.970> and<00:04:39.450> it<00:04:39.690> can<00:04:39.810> actually<00:04:39.900> keep<00:04:40.320> quite<00:04:40.530> a

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
liquid and it can actually keep quite a

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.440 
liquid and it can actually keep quite a
bit<00:04:40.740> liquid<00:04:41.070> inside<00:04:41.370> you<00:04:41.580> keep<00:04:41.760> it<00:04:41.940> wet<00:04:42.150> so

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:42.450 
bit liquid inside you keep it wet so

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:44.480 
bit liquid inside you keep it wet so
we'll<00:04:42.930> do<00:04:43.080> something<00:04:43.260> very<00:04:43.440> similar<00:04:43.770> but<00:04:44.220> Sir

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490 
we'll do something very similar but Sir

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:45.980 
we'll do something very similar but Sir
I'll<00:04:44.760> get<00:04:44.910> dad<00:04:45.090> to<00:04:45.120> finish<00:04:45.420> the<00:04:45.570> string<00:04:45.810> bit

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990 
I'll get dad to finish the string bit

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.200 
I'll get dad to finish the string bit
you<00:04:46.110> can<00:04:46.230> do<00:04:46.320> the<00:04:46.410> difficult<00:04:46.590> bit<00:04:47.060> and<00:04:48.060> we'll

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
you can do the difficult bit and we'll
