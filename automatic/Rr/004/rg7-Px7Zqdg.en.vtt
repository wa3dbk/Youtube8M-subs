00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.540 
mid-october almost late October it's
just<00:00:27.410> but<00:00:28.410> this<00:00:28.560> is<00:00:28.740> still<00:00:28.920> cooler<00:00:29.250> than

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
just but this is still cooler than

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.160 
just but this is still cooler than
average<00:00:29.910> for<00:00:29.939> this<00:00:30.240> time<00:00:30.300> of<00:00:30.510> year<00:00:30.630> and<00:00:31.199> it<00:00:31.320> is

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:33.170 
average for this time of year and it is

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.660 
average for this time of year and it is
accelerated<00:00:34.170> or<00:00:34.350> amplified<00:00:35.010> rather<00:00:35.340> by<00:00:35.610> the

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
accelerated or amplified rather by the

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.049 
accelerated or amplified rather by the
fact<00:00:36.059> that<00:00:37.670> the<00:00:38.670> weather<00:00:38.910> has<00:00:39.180> been<00:00:39.210> very<00:00:39.840> warm

00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:41.059 
fact that the weather has been very warm

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:44.900 
fact that the weather has been very warm
so<00:00:42.620> and<00:00:43.620> it<00:00:43.739> just<00:00:43.920> happened<00:00:44.250> like<00:00:44.370> literally

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
so and it just happened like literally

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.660 
so and it just happened like literally
overnight<00:00:45.200> but<00:00:46.200> spring<00:00:46.920> and<00:00:47.070> fall<00:00:47.250> that's<00:00:47.550> how

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
overnight but spring and fall that's how

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:56.180 
overnight but spring and fall that's how
it<00:00:47.789> is<00:00:47.940> at<00:00:48.149> least<00:00:48.270> here<00:00:48.629> so<00:00:55.039> yeah<00:00:56.039> I've

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
it is at least here so yeah I've

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.790 
it is at least here so yeah I've
recently<00:00:56.460> discovered<00:00:56.850> on<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.510> iPhone<00:00:57.960> 4s<00:00:58.410> a

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
recently discovered on the iPhone 4s a

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.270 
recently discovered on the iPhone 4s a
way<00:00:58.920> to<00:00:58.980> lock<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.760> the<00:01:00.420> focusing<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:01.280> the

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
way to lock the the focusing and the

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.939 
way to lock the the focusing and the
exposure<00:01:02.879> so<00:01:03.359> it<00:01:03.480> just<00:01:03.690> isn't<00:01:04.320> constantly

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
exposure so it just isn't constantly

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.280 
exposure so it just isn't constantly
trying<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.309> focus<00:01:05.580> so<00:01:06.570> I've<00:01:06.689> done<00:01:06.900> that<00:01:07.110> now

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
trying to focus so I've done that now

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.719 
trying to focus so I've done that now
we'll<00:01:07.530> see<00:01:07.740> how<00:01:07.830> that<00:01:07.890> works<00:01:08.100> I<00:01:08.310> haven't<00:01:08.549> done

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
we'll see how that works I haven't done

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.460 
we'll see how that works I haven't done
it<00:01:08.850> before<00:01:08.939> I<00:01:09.420> thought<00:01:09.900> this<00:01:10.049> would<00:01:10.170> be<00:01:10.229> a<00:01:10.350> good

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
it before I thought this would be a good

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.670 
it before I thought this would be a good
test<00:01:11.600> these<00:01:12.600> are<00:01:12.780> new<00:01:12.900> frisbees<00:01:13.350> I've<00:01:13.500> been

Mike<00:03:36.640> and<00:03:37.320> I<00:03:38.320> don't<00:03:38.470> know<00:03:38.530> if<00:03:38.620> I<00:03:38.709> I<00:03:38.739> probably

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:39.070 
Mike and I don't know if I I probably

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.009 
Mike and I don't know if I I probably
said<00:03:39.489> this<00:03:39.580> in<00:03:39.730> a<00:03:39.790> video<00:03:39.970> before<00:03:40.090> my<00:03:40.510> what<00:03:40.989> I

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.019 
said this in a video before my what I

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:44.300 
said this in a video before my what I
think<00:03:41.620> the<00:03:42.130> reason<00:03:42.519> for<00:03:42.700> that<00:03:42.760> is<00:03:43.060> is<00:03:43.690> that

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
think the reason for that is is that

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.460 
think the reason for that is is that
they<00:03:45.310> want<00:03:45.519> to<00:03:45.610> conserve<00:03:46.150> their<00:03:46.420> energy

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
they want to conserve their energy

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.990 
they want to conserve their energy
because<00:03:47.470> with<00:03:47.860> Venus<00:03:48.250> actually<00:03:48.640> was<00:03:48.790> all

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
because with Venus actually was all

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.270 
because with Venus actually was all
three<00:03:49.360> of<00:03:49.510> my<00:03:49.540> dogs<00:03:49.930> when<00:03:50.620> I<00:03:50.650> first<00:03:50.980> started

frisbee<00:03:51.700> training<00:03:52.060> they<00:03:52.180> all<00:03:52.420> would

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
frisbee training they all would

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.220 
frisbee training they all would
naturally<00:03:53.500> jump<00:03:53.980> Venus<00:03:54.970> used<00:03:55.450> to<00:03:55.569> jump<00:03:55.840> so

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
naturally jump Venus used to jump so

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:57.270

eva bleeker frisbee when she was about a
year<00:04:00.250> old<00:04:00.810> and<00:04:01.810> then<00:04:02.020> she<00:04:02.260> just<00:04:02.470> like<00:04:02.770> stopped

year old and then she just like stopped

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:05.670 
year old and then she just like stopped
jumping<00:04:03.430> as<00:04:03.730> much<00:04:03.970> and<00:04:04.360> it's<00:04:05.260> almost<00:04:05.410> as

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
jumping as much and it's almost as

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.309 
jumping as much and it's almost as
though<00:04:05.830> she<00:04:05.890> realized<00:04:06.490> go<00:04:06.790> Venus<00:04:06.940> that<00:04:07.780> if<00:04:08.080> she

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:08.319 
though she realized go Venus that if she

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:10.260 
though she realized go Venus that if she
would<00:04:08.440> conserve<00:04:08.860> her<00:04:09.010> energy<00:04:09.040> that<00:04:09.940> she<00:04:10.120> could

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:10.270 
would conserve her energy that she could

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:13.080 
would conserve her energy that she could
play<00:04:10.480> longer<00:04:11.250> so<00:04:12.250> now<00:04:12.400> she<00:04:12.459> doesn't<00:04:12.819> really

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
play longer so now she doesn't really

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.900 
play longer so now she doesn't really
jump<00:04:13.989> for<00:04:14.140> him<00:04:14.200> which<00:04:14.319> i<00:04:14.500> think<00:04:14.560> is<00:04:14.800> fine<00:04:15.069> as

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:15.910 
jump for him which i think is fine as

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:21.270 
jump for him which i think is fine as
flashy<00:04:16.329> as<00:04:16.540> a<00:04:16.690> jumping<00:04:17.200> dog<00:04:17.410> is<00:04:17.859> I<00:04:18.750> like<00:04:20.280> the

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 
flashy as a jumping dog is I like the

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.940 
flashy as a jumping dog is I like the
idea<00:04:21.669> that<00:04:21.910> they're<00:04:22.060> not<00:04:22.210> getting<00:04:22.630> um<00:04:22.990> too

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:23.950 
idea that they're not getting um too

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:25.950 
idea that they're not getting um too
much<00:04:24.160> too<00:04:25.000> much<00:04:25.120> pressure<00:04:25.389> on<00:04:25.510> their<00:04:25.690> joints

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
much too much pressure on their joints

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.530 
much too much pressure on their joints
from<00:04:26.050> excessive<00:04:26.530> jumping<00:04:26.950> so<00:04:27.220> that's<00:04:28.120> good

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:28.540 
from excessive jumping so that's good

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:30.720 
from excessive jumping so that's good
