now<00:00:13.019> you<00:00:13.889> can<00:00:14.040> see<00:00:14.340> I<00:00:17.119> have<00:00:18.119> a<00:00:18.150> swash<00:00:18.779> plate

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:19.010 
now you can see I have a swash plate

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:22.700 
now you can see I have a swash plate
from<00:00:20.010> I<00:00:20.779> believe<00:00:21.779> that's<00:00:21.990> for<00:00:22.020> micro<00:00:22.439> Hailey's

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
from I believe that's for micro Hailey's

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.189 
from I believe that's for micro Hailey's
off<00:00:23.550> of<00:00:23.760> Amazon<00:00:24.150> I<00:00:25.039> also<00:00:26.039> have<00:00:26.630> the<00:00:27.630> micro

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
off of Amazon I also have the micro

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.959 
off of Amazon I also have the micro
Hailey's<00:00:28.529> auto<00:00:29.340> rotate<00:00:29.910> year<00:00:31.669> this<00:00:32.669> is<00:00:32.850> off

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
Hailey's auto rotate year this is off

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.630 
Hailey's auto rotate year this is off
Amazon<00:00:33.180> also<00:00:33.980> which<00:00:34.980> comes<00:00:35.250> with<00:00:35.489> the

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
Amazon also which comes with the

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.049 
Amazon also which comes with the
titanium<00:00:35.969> shaft<00:00:36.630> also<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:38.070> auto<00:00:38.280> rotate<00:00:38.760> gear

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
titanium shaft also the auto rotate gear

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.160 
titanium shaft also the auto rotate gear
itself<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:40.440> spool<00:00:41.090> so<00:00:42.090> now<00:00:42.270> you<00:00:42.840> can<00:00:42.989> hold

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
itself and the spool so now you can hold

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.600 
itself and the spool so now you can hold
this<00:00:43.350> and<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.649> main<00:00:43.770> rotor<00:00:44.010> can<00:00:44.190> still<00:00:44.430> turn

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
this and the main rotor can still turn

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.340 
this and the main rotor can still turn
so<00:00:45.090> we<00:00:45.210> can<00:00:45.329> do<00:00:45.420> some<00:00:45.570> auto<00:00:45.719> rotations<00:00:46.200> with

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
so we can do some auto rotations with

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:52.450 
so we can do some auto rotations with
this<00:00:46.530> I<00:00:47.480> have<00:00:48.480> a<00:00:48.809> head<00:00:49.559> block<00:00:49.890> from<00:00:51.020> rkh

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.730 
you don't see a it the gear will move
forward<00:02:03.210> and<00:02:03.360> disengage<00:02:03.930> from<00:02:04.350> your<00:02:04.530> tail

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
forward and disengage from your tail

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.700 
forward and disengage from your tail
gear<00:02:04.979> and<00:02:05.189> you'll<00:02:05.280> lose<00:02:05.490> Road<00:02:05.729> or<00:02:05.939> tail<00:02:06.299> rotor

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
gear and you'll lose Road or tail rotor

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.369 
gear and you'll lose Road or tail rotor
ok<00:02:07.710> so<00:02:07.789> right<00:02:08.789> there<00:02:09.030> at<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.209> end<00:02:09.360> where<00:02:10.110> the

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
ok so right there at the end where the

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.800 
ok so right there at the end where the
torque<00:02:10.739> tube<00:02:10.920> is<00:02:11.039> coming<00:02:11.340> through<00:02:11.640> the<00:02:12.540> gear

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
torque tube is coming through the gear

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.080 
torque tube is coming through the gear
go<00:02:13.260> ahead<00:02:13.379> and<00:02:13.470> put<00:02:13.590> a<00:02:13.620> drop<00:02:14.190> of<00:02:14.220> CA<00:02:14.550> on<00:02:14.879> there

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
go ahead and put a drop of CA on there

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.500 
go ahead and put a drop of CA on there
and<00:02:15.300> get<00:02:15.480> that<00:02:15.629> to<00:02:15.780> hold<00:02:16.099> I<00:02:17.099> also<00:02:17.550> have<00:02:17.910> a

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
and get that to hold I also have a

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.699 
and get that to hold I also have a
aluminum<00:02:20.120> pitch<00:02:21.120> slider<00:02:21.270> this<00:02:22.050> is<00:02:22.260> from<00:02:22.440> micro

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
aluminum pitch slider this is from micro

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.760 
aluminum pitch slider this is from micro
heli<00:02:22.890> also<00:02:23.720> okay<00:02:24.720> a<00:02:24.840> lot<00:02:25.050> from<00:02:25.230> micro<00:02:25.500> heli<00:02:25.680> a

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
heli also okay a lot from micro heli a

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:32.440 
heli also okay a lot from micro heli a
lot<00:02:25.950> from<00:02:26.069> rkh<00:02:26.959> this<00:02:27.959> is<00:02:28.349> the<00:02:29.239> tail<00:02:30.239> rotor

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
lot from rkh this is the tail rotor

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.729 
lot from rkh this is the tail rotor
bracket<00:02:33.450> I<00:02:33.629> guess<00:02:33.840> it's<00:02:34.019> for<00:02:34.140> protecting<00:02:34.650> the

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
bracket I guess it's for protecting the

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:36.619 
bracket I guess it's for protecting the
tail<00:02:34.920> rotor<00:02:35.040> from<00:02:35.250> striking<00:02:35.519> the<00:02:35.640> ground<00:02:35.879> that

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:36.629 
tail rotor from striking the ground that

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:42.170 
tail rotor from striking the ground that
is<00:02:36.840> from<00:02:37.110> rkh<00:02:37.970> if<00:02:38.970> you<00:02:39.090> guys<00:02:39.209> can<00:02:39.420> see<00:02:39.599> that<00:02:41.180> rkh

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
is from rkh if you guys can see that rkh

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.040 
is from rkh if you guys can see that rkh
for<00:02:42.569> the<00:02:42.629> 130<00:02:43.019> X<00:02:43.580> okay<00:02:44.580> so<00:02:44.640> after<00:02:45.450> doing<00:02:45.780> all<00:02:45.989> of

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
for the 130 X okay so after doing all of

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.470 
for the 130 X okay so after doing all of
this<00:02:46.230> stuff<00:02:46.500> it<00:02:46.739> flies<00:02:46.980> you<00:02:47.730> know<00:02:47.760> pretty<00:02:48.239> good

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
this stuff it flies you know pretty good

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:49.850 
this stuff it flies you know pretty good
the<00:02:48.720> only<00:02:48.900> issue<00:02:49.080> I'm<00:02:49.170> having<00:02:49.230> with<00:02:49.560> it<00:02:49.680> now<00:02:49.830> is

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
the only issue I'm having with it now is

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.420 
the only issue I'm having with it now is
if<00:02:50.129> I<00:02:50.250> try<00:02:50.310> and<00:02:50.519> do<00:02:50.640> fast<00:02:51.140> reverse<00:02:52.140> flight<00:02:52.590> then

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
if I try and do fast reverse flight then

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.300 
if I try and do fast reverse flight then
the<00:02:53.879> tail<00:02:54.060> will<00:02:54.239> start<00:02:54.480> to<00:02:54.860> go<00:02:55.860> a<00:02:55.890> little<00:02:56.069> bit

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
the tail will start to go a little bit

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.520 
the tail will start to go a little bit
nuts<00:02:56.640> and<00:02:57.150> seems<00:02:57.959> like<00:02:58.080> there's<00:02:58.230> not<00:02:58.379> really

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
nuts and seems like there's not really

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.339 
nuts and seems like there's not really
too<00:02:58.739> much<00:02:59.010> more<00:02:59.250> I<00:02:59.280> can<00:02:59.489> do<00:02:59.670> to<00:03:00.269> get<00:03:01.140> rid<00:03:01.319> of

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:01.349 
too much more I can do to get rid of

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:02.690 
too much more I can do to get rid of
that<00:03:01.500> except<00:03:01.800> for<00:03:01.830> screw<00:03:02.310> around<00:03:02.400> with<00:03:02.550> the

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
that except for screw around with the

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.100 
that except for screw around with the
gyro<00:03:03.030> a<00:03:03.060> little<00:03:03.360> bit<00:03:03.480> and<00:03:03.599> hopefully<00:03:03.930> that

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
gyro a little bit and hopefully that

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.440 
gyro a little bit and hopefully that
cures<00:03:04.409> it<00:03:04.590> also<00:03:05.159> had<00:03:05.400> the<00:03:05.489> aftermarket<00:03:05.819> canopy

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
cures it also had the aftermarket canopy

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:07.640 
cures it also had the aftermarket canopy
but<00:03:06.780> you<00:03:06.870> guys<00:03:06.959> have<00:03:07.140> seen<00:03:07.319> in<00:03:07.409> the<00:03:07.470> previous

have<00:03:11.700> from<00:03:11.879> rkh<00:03:12.480> the<00:03:13.290> heatsinks

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:14.099 
have from rkh the heatsinks

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:15.830 
have from rkh the heatsinks
I<00:03:14.129> have<00:03:14.489> the<00:03:14.640> one<00:03:14.760> in<00:03:14.879> the<00:03:14.970> middle<00:03:15.239> that<00:03:15.390> one<00:03:15.720> is

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
I have the one in the middle that one is

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.290 
I have the one in the middle that one is
a<00:03:15.870> pain<00:03:16.200> to<00:03:16.440> get<00:03:16.560> in<00:03:16.769> you<00:03:17.370> got<00:03:17.519> to<00:03:17.640> push<00:03:18.090> your

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
a pain to get in you got to push your

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.149 
a pain to get in you got to push your
board<00:03:18.540> forward<00:03:18.840> take<00:03:19.290> the<00:03:19.409> screws<00:03:19.650> out<00:03:19.830> lift

00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:20.159 
board forward take the screws out lift

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:20.660 
board forward take the screws out lift
the<00:03:20.310> motor

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
the motor

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.479 
the motor
slide<00:03:21.450> that<00:03:21.659> in<00:03:21.810> from<00:03:21.989> the<00:03:22.110> front<00:03:22.349> and<00:03:22.709> then

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
slide that in from the front and then

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:25.009 
slide that in from the front and then
push<00:03:23.670> the<00:03:23.790> motor<00:03:23.940> back<00:03:24.209> down<00:03:24.390> through<00:03:24.629> it<00:03:24.810> and

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
push the motor back down through it and

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:26.449 
push the motor back down through it and
then<00:03:25.200> stick<00:03:25.470> this<00:03:25.560> top<00:03:25.769> on<00:03:25.920> or<00:03:26.040> you<00:03:26.159> can<00:03:26.340> take

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
then stick this top on or you can take

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.220 
then stick this top on or you can take
the<00:03:26.610> whole<00:03:26.730> frame<00:03:26.970> apart<00:03:27.269> and<00:03:27.510> put<00:03:27.930> it<00:03:27.989> in<00:03:28.080> that

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
the whole frame apart and put it in that

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:28.580 
the whole frame apart and put it in that
way

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
way

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.920 
way
okay<00:03:29.370> so<00:03:29.730> you<00:03:29.819> can<00:03:29.940> see<00:03:30.120> that<00:03:30.239> the<00:03:30.420> heat<00:03:30.569> sinks

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
okay so you can see that the heat sinks

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.330 
okay so you can see that the heat sinks
in<00:03:31.049> there<00:03:31.230> also<00:03:31.890> the<00:03:32.420> auto<00:03:33.420> rotation<00:03:33.780> gear

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
in there also the auto rotation gear

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:39.199 
in there also the auto rotation gear
okay<00:03:35.340> so<00:03:36.269> even<00:03:36.989> though<00:03:37.260> you<00:03:37.739> stopped<00:03:38.040> this<00:03:38.310> it

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
okay so even though you stopped this it

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:45.800 
okay so even though you stopped this it
still<00:03:39.510> turns<00:03:39.840> okay<00:03:40.970> tail<00:03:41.970> still<00:03:42.239> turns<00:03:44.540> so<00:03:45.540> I

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
still turns okay tail still turns so I

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.780 
still turns okay tail still turns so I
went<00:03:46.230> in<00:03:46.319> my<00:03:46.409> fluid<00:03:46.620> today<00:03:46.950> once<00:03:47.190> like<00:03:47.400> this<00:03:47.610> so

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
went in my fluid today once like this so

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.509 
went in my fluid today once like this so
far<00:03:48.090> I'm<00:03:48.780> like<00:03:49.019> I<00:03:49.140> said<00:03:49.349> it<00:03:49.470> flies<00:03:49.769> very<00:03:49.950> nice

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
far I'm like I said it flies very nice

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:53.270 
far I'm like I said it flies very nice
now<00:03:50.760> a<00:03:51.629> lot<00:03:52.409> of<00:03:52.530> the<00:03:52.590> problems<00:03:52.980> have<00:03:53.159> been

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
now a lot of the problems have been

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.750 
now a lot of the problems have been
overcome<00:03:54.200> the<00:03:55.200> only<00:03:55.379> issue<00:03:55.560> I'm<00:03:55.950> still<00:03:56.549> having

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
overcome the only issue I'm still having

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.190 
overcome the only issue I'm still having
is<00:03:57.120> like<00:03:57.420> I<00:03:57.540> said<00:03:57.780> fast<00:03:58.650> reverse<00:03:59.400> flight<00:03:59.909> so<00:04:00.840> I

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
is like I said fast reverse flight so I
