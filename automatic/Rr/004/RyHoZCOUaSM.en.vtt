 Though this is about 10g 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:29.720
 I think it would be better to have about 15 grams, including some kind of topping 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:36.650

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:37.700

 It became whiter than a little for a moment 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:54.950
 Mix well until next time you will add flour and baking powder 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.370
 It would be better to sift this too 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:00.849
 Nja am 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:09.430

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:16.090

 Do Sang-hoon's say 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.629
 The air 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.629

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.970
 Vanilla integer little bit 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.930
 And 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:41.680
 It is thick in the previous unmode 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:48.129
 If you want to add to the dough is a little 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:52.230
 There's already another cut for a bit on top of the last cut that looks like Zach Villi. 

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:52.910
 But I think it doesn't have to be cut 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.430
 In this 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:59.770
 [musics] 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:04:02.420

 Evenly placed and I Toka color break even in the And then something like that we will put this in a cup 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:14.460

 At the evenly ne since become 5 the middle of the 

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:25.140
 The petals of cherry blossoms among these is the feeling that will continue to decorate and ride to the petals of cherry blossoms 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:28.560
 I did not divide it so much but I divided it 

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:34.449
 If you want to make it look a little better, make it a little bigger 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:39.639
 I think it's more cute to decorate, and because there is a little bit of shame, you can also taste it 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:45.999
 It may be a little bigger, and if it's okay, it's 170 minutes in the oven for 17 minutes 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:47.569
 The completed Sakura Ward cake, which was completed by the fact that I will bake it, is here 

00:04:45.999 --> 00:04:51.589
 Made-mer 

00:04:47.569 --> 00:04:57.080
 I have a little riding cherry tree I wonder if I look scan 

00:04:51.589 --> 00:04:58.430

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.740
 tano 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:00.940
 Further 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.630
 I wonder what a bit different 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:07.510
 [musics] 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:07.510
 The part of the leaf of cherry tree sugar comes out 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:14.930
 I will ne scent of such great cherry tree will determine slightly cherry blossoms 

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:18.870
 Hmmm 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:29.969
 I just ate a cave cave but now it's a bit sweet 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:34.770
 Anxiety that feels like a shot celestial sappa come and eat this part is Kamitomi 

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:41.340
 It's raining, it's not too raining, I'm just fine

 You can feel like it's a great spring like there are a lot of delicious warmth 

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:59.789
 Because it is the foot attend flow recipe of this amount Toka another tree of the mother and the flour and sugar 8 

00:05:57.599 --> 00:06:05.320
 150 grams of butter 

00:05:59.789 --> 00:06:09.310
 If it seems a little too sweet because it is done in units that are easy to hold 

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:16.090
 You may be asked to wait for some sugar 

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:20.950
 After the oven is also 170 degrees at 817 minutes but it's just easy to remember in 77 

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:25.340
