as bad as a real Big Mac looks as

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.470 
as bad as a real Big Mac looks as
compared<00:02:16.290> to<00:02:16.380> the<00:02:16.940> images<00:02:17.940> they<00:02:18.150> put<00:02:18.360> in

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
compared to the images they put in

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.160 
compared to the images they put in
advertising<00:02:19.340> but<00:02:20.360> image<00:02:21.360> is<00:02:21.660> only<00:02:21.840> half<00:02:22.140> the

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
advertising but image is only half the

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.790 
advertising but image is only half the
battle

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
battle

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:35.960 
battle
taste<00:02:23.430> is<00:02:24.110> probably<00:02:25.110> more<00:02:25.290> than<00:02:25.440> half<00:02:25.620> so

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.500 

the<00:02:36.970> chocolate<00:02:37.390> crust<00:02:37.599> is<00:02:37.870> very<00:02:39.510> reminiscent

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
the chocolate crust is very reminiscent

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.350 
the chocolate crust is very reminiscent
of<00:02:40.900> the<00:02:41.349> chocolate<00:02:42.040> fudge<00:02:42.370> pop-tarts

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
of the chocolate fudge pop-tarts

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.759 
of the chocolate fudge pop-tarts
I<00:02:45.599> guess<00:02:46.599> that's<00:02:46.840> to<00:02:46.959> be<00:02:46.989> expected<00:02:47.170> whether

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769 
I guess that's to be expected whether

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:51.420 
I guess that's to be expected whether
them<00:02:47.980> being<00:02:48.220> cold<00:02:48.459> on<00:02:48.610> Sunday<00:02:50.069> however<00:02:51.069> I<00:02:51.190> was

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
them being cold on Sunday however I was

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.899 
them being cold on Sunday however I was
hoping<00:02:51.670> for<00:02:51.760> the<00:02:51.909> Bell<00:02:53.310> the<00:02:54.310> chocolate<00:02:54.700> press

00:02:54.899 --> 00:02:54.909 
hoping for the Bell the chocolate press

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:57.240 
hoping for the Bell the chocolate press
ones<00:02:55.269> the<00:02:55.599> crust<00:02:55.930> is<00:02:56.079> never<00:02:56.379> good<00:02:56.650> it's<00:02:57.099> just

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
ones the crust is never good it's just

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:11.430 
ones the crust is never good it's just
not<00:02:58.950> let's<00:02:59.950> hope<00:03:00.129> that<00:03:00.310> the<00:03:00.430> insides<00:03:00.760> better

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:27.890 

yeah<00:03:12.340> it's<00:03:12.940> better

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:37.130 

yep<00:03:28.860> this<00:03:29.129> was<00:03:29.370> a<00:03:29.510> it's<00:03:30.510> a<00:03:30.629> tough<00:03:30.780> call<00:03:36.140> because
