00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.619
 that is what one of the locksmith is talking about first in zandvoort we go here 

00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:16.070
 do something tonight that the man definitely knew how to connect and the 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.710
 driving a car 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.990
 the already gore driving does not go together is known 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.810
 but the limit is still at zero for 5 million 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.319
 Is that spacious and what are the consequences? 

00:00:24.319 --> 00:00:27.029
 or after ten the test takes the sum under the guidance of experienced 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.329
 instructors in an enclosed area or drinking them once 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:34.199
 Normally Dury has more company safety training than one with 

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:37.480
 excited of course that does have some experience with that as a human being 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.140
 many you check for yourself too 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.520
 yes but if the general products and services are up to date then we just go 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:44.750
 nice stretch of coastline 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.380
 furthermore no experience with going to alcohol was seeing that tess is going 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:49.290
 bring 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.490
 he did learn his real started as she can do tasting wasn't that 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:53.820
 because you go through the police 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.190
 yeah so good the worse then it is all too easy to teach 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.680
 Firstly car had to get a piece a while 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.850
 but we are going to get dark drunk should say maybe it's going to see 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.619
 first the candidates do the slalom and the elaboration rumors 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.220
 on the shelves 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.160
 and that went reluctantly 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.440
 after three times everyone played it anyway 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.520
 what a professional also a better view of the viewer's footsteps 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.780
 that was ridiculous that became 10 milligrams per liter 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.200
 just come to that at least 2 percent 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.250
 A score above five is brought to your gift device and points higher 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.400
 Alcorcon justice were affecting in different ways 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.950
 and so it may be that your peripheral field of vision changes it 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:35.870
 reduced 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:38.710
 and this means that you get a sort of tunnel vision 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.130
 it is also known that you have not used more alcohol and that you have 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.360
 for example, and get the longer response time 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.880
 In addition, alcohol also has an effect on your behavior 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.610
 whoever spend the year morning take more risks 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.300
 that becomes indifferent you had less soon again the compression falls 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.300
 eating place 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.329
 this revealed the first four topics on twitter 

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:08.329
 but the consequences were unclear 

00:02:09.159 --> 00:02:12.609
 and with the second session done and let Eddy blow and everyone was like that 

00:02:12.609 --> 00:02:15.459
 hofje promiel therefore does not reveal the legal standards on our novice 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:16.010
 driver 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.160
 but for me the technique friend of mine was reasonable or not the technique went 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.980
 well to do the exercise yes he actually yes like any for relief 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.880
 and you will notice when you drive off each time there is more in us 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.370
 country 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.989
 it went a bit sloppy now and then rescued from the sea, but there were a few 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:39.360
 times on the edge you notice that the concentration with that noted the yes 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.460
 agree with all this copper section that does not change that way 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:43.540
 very direct driving technology 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.400
 you just notice that the slowness increases in the reacting regiment in the 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.810
 top 10 in other things 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.620
 plus the fact that they are distracted very quickly, nothing happens anywhere else 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.319
 Goes right has always stated itself 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:59.529
 that makes it a lot more dangerous to have in this test and in itself 

00:02:59.529 --> 00:03:01.319
 little effect to be found of 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:05.480
 hey alcohol on driving ability that may have to do with the test 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.239
 Maybe shortage is when it is also used then you would be in a short 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:12.059
 tasting may be able 

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:14.859
 Lombardi effects and compensate 

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:18.529
 and if I am also a bit longer then it soon becomes more difficult this driving task 

00:03:18.529 --> 00:03:22.999
 nice to say fairly simple pleasure the rider will put here 

00:03:22.999 --> 00:03:24.279
 just on the road 

00:03:24.279 --> 00:03:27.499
 But the real traffic you also have lessons on others for example 

00:03:27.499 --> 00:03:29.149
 road users 

00:03:29.149 --> 00:03:31.339
 the traffic light and the like 

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:35.519
 and so your divided attention soon becomes under the affected 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:37.109
 influence of alcohol 

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:38.920
 to the second session on the job what they eat 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.920
 and much more 

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:48.799
 useful for the thirteen of the eighteen candidates 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:51.729
 so drunk that they are all above the legal limit 

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:52.989
 but 5 8 even 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:56.069
 right up to the meet again a lady who walwalde this more than welcome 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:58.709
 and again I want an unnamed because controlled 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:01.709
 circumstances inspectors in addition never goes itself 

00:04:03.369 --> 00:04:06.369
 the hell of jef de fia de grand prix 

00:04:07.399 --> 00:04:10.729
 safety has been incurred 

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:13.889
 I have no idea that I am missing a poster campaign now 

00:04:15.749 --> 00:04:17.739
 the set-up 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:20.739
 one of them 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:24.569
 research agency 

00:04:24.569 --> 00:04:27.569
 you no longer see them 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.710
 It was wise not to queue the entire country 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.900
 I train I heard something beeping but it does not stay there 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.520
 the city we are willing to hunter is friends 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.090
 to other media issues 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:45.480
 afterwards it is the first child to get what the heart goes but I stay 

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.520
 counted as the criticism continues throughout the chain 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.639
 falls the number of people who drive much faster that has been set up and granted 

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:54.310
 Full people inside that they look much better because they do so the competition 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.060
 to go together get super
