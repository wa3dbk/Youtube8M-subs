00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:49.280
 okay here because these O bristles 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:51.590
 soft to paint the top of the 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:55.370
 diaper belly mainly this 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:57.739

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:03.410
 their bristles are firmer in the 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:06.950
 natural bristle in the case is the condor 456

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.460
