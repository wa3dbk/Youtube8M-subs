00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:26.000
 For me to be born into this world 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:39.200
 It can be said that it is accidental or miraculous. 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:52.000
 Compared with the current hope that I hope to become an adult sooner. 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:05.000
 Seems to be able to detect more things 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.800
 Where is borderline? 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:21.000
 I will be just there sometime. 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:29.900
 The moment is far from the so-called hopes and ideals 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.900
 That is the same every day 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.900
 If you are tired, then it’s good to leave it alone. 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.200
 But the reality is not that simple 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.900
 If you don’t have money, you can’t do anything. 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 Then why are we living for what? 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.500
 Just like not knocking open the eggshell 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.800
 Can't taste the taste of it 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.000
 Did not break their own shell 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.800
 I can’t know the true self again. 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000
 Where is borderline? 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:44.000
 I will be just there sometime. 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:52.850
 Face to live in a life that cannot be renewed 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.800
 It’s not so difficult 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:05.750
 I won’t say it even if I don’t see the future. 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000
 Just enjoy the life of the moment, just like this. 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.800
 I just don't want to regret myself. 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:33.500
 Even if you can’t capture the true look of happiness 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:35.700
 But everyone is looking forward to it. 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.900
 For all kinds of happiness gestures 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:49.000
 Also have different ways of pursuing 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.800
 Whether it is the long-term road end 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:03.800
 Or what is under the shadow of the grass in the corner? I want to know. 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:11.800
 But what makes me stagnant is not anything in the world. 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 And it’s just my heart. 

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:27.800
 a reality far from the so-called hopes and ideals 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:34.400
 For every day 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.800
 If you are tired, then just abandon it. 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.400
 But the reality is not that simple 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.000
 If you don’t have money, you can’t do anything. 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.800
 Then why are we living for what? 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:05:01.000
 What is it for living?
