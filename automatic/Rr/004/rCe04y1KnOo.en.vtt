light<00:02:16.920> and<00:02:17.160> I<00:02:17.850> myself<00:02:18.090> as<00:02:18.480> someone<00:02:18.690> wears<00:02:18.989> of

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
light and I myself as someone wears of

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.500 
light and I myself as someone wears of
the<00:02:19.260> army<00:02:19.590> I<00:02:19.830> personally<00:02:20.400> feel<00:02:21.209> that<00:02:21.269> this

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
the army I personally feel that this

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.020 
the army I personally feel that this
game<00:02:21.750> is<00:02:22.170> really<00:02:22.380> a<00:02:22.530> good<00:02:22.890> trial<00:02:23.489> for<00:02:23.700> them<00:02:23.850> as

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
game is really a good trial for them as

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.820 
game is really a good trial for them as
they<00:02:24.090> know<00:02:24.810> that<00:02:24.870> water<00:02:25.170> weapons<00:02:25.500> that<00:02:25.680> the

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
they know that water weapons that the

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.400 
they know that water weapons that the
SEF<00:02:26.190> are<00:02:26.340> using<00:02:26.730> is<00:02:27.090> not<00:02:27.510> that<00:02:27.750> easy<00:02:27.810> prior

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
SEF are using is not that easy prior

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.500 
SEF are using is not that easy prior
great<00:02:28.800> strategies<00:02:29.280> because<00:02:29.459> one<00:02:30.000> person<00:02:30.329> down

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
great strategies because one person down

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:42.040 
great strategies because one person down
may<00:02:30.750> lead<00:02:31.260> the<00:02:31.410> team<00:02:31.530> to<00:02:31.590> lose

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:49.690 

Oh

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:03:00.510 

Oh

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:00.520 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.410 

during<00:03:01.520> the<00:03:01.580> last<00:03:01.700> round<00:03:02.000> it's<00:03:02.150> actually<00:03:02.390> a

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
during the last round it's actually a

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.450 
during the last round it's actually a
tiebreaker<00:03:02.870> match<00:03:03.020> against<00:03:03.770> at<00:03:04.100> my<00:03:04.190> CT

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:04.460 
tiebreaker match against at my CT

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:06.700 
tiebreaker match against at my CT
extreme<00:03:04.790> so<00:03:05.390> what<00:03:05.750> happens<00:03:06.050> is<00:03:06.140> that<00:03:06.170> I<00:03:06.500> guess

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:06.710 
extreme so what happens is that I guess

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:08.470 
extreme so what happens is that I guess
we<00:03:07.190> were<00:03:07.310> we<00:03:07.490> were<00:03:07.580> really<00:03:07.700> outclassed<00:03:07.910> in<00:03:08.360> the

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
we were we were really outclassed in the

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.410 
we were we were really outclassed in the
neck<00:03:08.660> they<00:03:09.140> knew<00:03:09.320> exactly<00:03:09.440> where<00:03:09.860> to<00:03:10.040> go

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
neck they knew exactly where to go

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.240 
neck they knew exactly where to go
exactly<00:03:11.420> where<00:03:11.540> we<00:03:11.660> would<00:03:11.780> be<00:03:11.840> and<00:03:12.260> when<00:03:12.860> when

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
exactly where we would be and when when

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:14.410 
exactly where we would be and when when
they<00:03:13.340> saw<00:03:13.550> us<00:03:13.700> they<00:03:13.820> just<00:03:14.000> took<00:03:14.090> us<00:03:14.240> out

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
they saw us they just took us out

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:15.640 
they saw us they just took us out
whereas<00:03:14.720> we<00:03:14.840> had<00:03:14.960> no<00:03:15.050> idea<00:03:15.290> where<00:03:15.410> they<00:03:15.500> were

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
whereas we had no idea where they were

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.070 
whereas we had no idea where they were
so<00:03:16.340> the<00:03:16.820> last<00:03:17.000> match<00:03:17.210> was<00:03:17.240> I<00:03:17.750> wouldn't<00:03:17.990> say

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080 
so the last match was I wouldn't say

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.260 
so the last match was I wouldn't say
it's<00:03:18.200> a<00:03:18.230> close<00:03:18.410> fight<00:03:18.560> because<00:03:18.920> we<00:03:19.850> we<00:03:20.150> were

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:20.270 
it's a close fight because we we were

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:21.880 
it's a close fight because we we were
beaten<00:03:20.570> fair<00:03:20.810> square<00:03:21.020> they<00:03:21.560> are<00:03:21.680> really<00:03:21.800> good

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
beaten fair square they are really good

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:24.520 
beaten fair square they are really good
in<00:03:22.190> a<00:03:22.430> match<00:03:22.610> I<00:03:23.330> guess<00:03:23.780> we<00:03:23.900> can<00:03:24.050> take<00:03:24.230> like<00:03:24.380> this

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
in a match I guess we can take like this

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.530 
in a match I guess we can take like this
experience<00:03:25.010> we<00:03:25.580> if<00:03:25.850> we<00:03:25.970> take<00:03:26.090> back<00:03:26.210> again<00:03:26.420> next

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
experience we if we take back again next

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:27.610 
experience we if we take back again next
year<00:03:26.690> we<00:03:26.900> will<00:03:26.930> make<00:03:27.170> sure<00:03:27.320> that<00:03:27.350> we<00:03:27.500> don't

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
year we will make sure that we don't

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.490 
year we will make sure that we don't
make<00:03:27.710> the<00:03:27.860> same<00:03:28.040> mistake<00:03:28.280> the<00:03:28.400> tiebreaker

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
make the same mistake the tiebreaker

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.050 
make the same mistake the tiebreaker
because<00:03:30.500> I<00:03:30.620> really<00:03:30.860> finish<00:03:31.130> my<00:03:31.310> NS<00:03:31.580> I<00:03:31.700> know<00:03:31.760> how

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
because I really finish my NS I know how

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.480 
because I really finish my NS I know how
as<00:03:32.300> they<00:03:32.450> use<00:03:32.870> their<00:03:33.020> tactics<00:03:33.350> so<00:03:33.770> I<00:03:33.800> just<00:03:34.310> use

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:34.490 
as they use their tactics so I just use

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:37.060 
as they use their tactics so I just use
a<00:03:34.520> normal<00:03:34.760> one<00:03:35.060> and<00:03:35.240> I<00:03:35.930> control<00:03:36.590> the<00:03:36.680> map<00:03:36.830> I

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:37.070 
a normal one and I control the map I

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:38.800 
a normal one and I control the map I
control<00:03:37.790> the<00:03:37.850> game<00:03:37.940> by<00:03:38.120> making<00:03:38.480> sure<00:03:38.540> that

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
control the game by making sure that

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.200 
control the game by making sure that
enemy<00:03:39.320> is<00:03:39.500> being<00:03:39.710> locked<00:03:39.950> on<00:03:40.160> our<00:03:40.760> location

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:41.210 
enemy is being locked on our location

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:43.420 
enemy is being locked on our location
where<00:03:41.390> by<00:03:41.510> they<00:03:41.660> cannot<00:03:41.930> do<00:03:42.440> their<00:03:42.920> strategy

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
where by they cannot do their strategy

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.270 
where by they cannot do their strategy
I'll<00:03:44.210> say<00:03:44.390> that<00:03:44.420> we<00:03:45.290> are<00:03:45.380> just<00:03:45.410> lucky<00:03:45.680> for<00:03:46.160> her

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
I'll say that we are just lucky for her

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:52.920 
I'll say that we are just lucky for her
side

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.179 

we<00:03:53.500> hope<00:03:53.620> that<00:03:53.650> they<00:03:53.829> have<00:03:53.980> a<00:03:54.010> better

00:03:54.179 --> 00:03:54.189 
we hope that they have a better

00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:56.539 
we hope that they have a better
understanding<00:03:54.310> of<00:03:54.939> what<00:03:55.329> the<00:03:55.510> Virgin<00:03:56.109> SEF

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
understanding of what the Virgin SEF

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:59.250 
understanding of what the Virgin SEF
capabilities<00:03:57.549> are<00:03:57.819> and<00:03:58.090> I<00:03:58.629> think<00:03:58.659> for<00:03:59.079> their

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
capabilities are and I think for their

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.229 
capabilities are and I think for their
own<00:03:59.439> personal<00:03:59.890> takeaway<00:04:00.549> is<00:04:00.819> that<00:04:00.909> how

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.239 
own personal takeaway is that how

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:03.630 
own personal takeaway is that how
important<00:04:02.079> it<00:04:02.170> is<00:04:02.260> for<00:04:02.590> games<00:04:03.040> such<00:04:03.280> as<00:04:03.310> this

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:03.640 
important it is for games such as this

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.000 
important it is for games such as this
even<00:04:04.390> in<00:04:04.510> real<00:04:04.659> life<00:04:04.870> when<00:04:05.109> they<00:04:05.230> do<00:04:05.290> go<00:04:05.890> into

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
even in real life when they do go into

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.149 
even in real life when they do go into
NS<00:04:06.400> to<00:04:06.819> work<00:04:07.000> as<00:04:07.120> a<00:04:07.150> team<00:04:07.269> so<00:04:07.799> now<00:04:08.799> we<00:04:08.859> know<00:04:08.980> what

00:04:09.149 --> 00:04:09.159 
NS to work as a team so now we know what

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:11.129 
NS to work as a team so now we know what
any<00:04:09.340> GC<00:04:09.579> is<00:04:09.760> about<00:04:10.030> maybe<00:04:10.510> next<00:04:10.780> year<00:04:10.930> we<00:04:11.019> can

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:11.139 
any GC is about maybe next year we can

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:12.330 
any GC is about maybe next year we can
follow<00:04:11.409> a<00:04:11.500> team<00:04:11.709> and<00:04:11.859> join<00:04:12.069> the<00:04:12.189> competition

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
follow a team and join the competition

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:20.940 
follow a team and join the competition
