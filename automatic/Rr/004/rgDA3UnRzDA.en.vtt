00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:12.860

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:12.860

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:24.420
 squid 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:27.750
 and two seafood combination books 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.890
 and here they are like a bear like four 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.970
 tilapia fillets 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:36.480
 and to 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:40.350
 seasoning we also need two 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:44.250
 pieces of onion garlic oregano 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:46.830

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.480
 put and at the end when the broth is already 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.910
 so why not because if we put it before 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.010
 changes color then almost to 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:07.270
 serve we are going to put those at the end 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:09.490
 here I have as 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:13.000
 4 liters of boiling water and here we go 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:15.250
 to put them to seafood here we go to 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.719

 take a long time when some 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:38.080

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.540
 shrimp as I told them at the end too 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:43.660
 because they know very very quickly 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:47.380
 I put right now with the seafood they are going to 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:48.670

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.350

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:55.830
 turn off the pot I'm going to put it to 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:02:00.420
 that this is not very recognized 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:04.740
 meanwhile let's make the sauce 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:07.590
 to fry the garlic with oregano and 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:10.170
 onion that we will liquefy and 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:13.190
 fry in olive oil and we're going to 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:16.350
 put seafood that is boiling 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:21.520
 here here we are going to liquefy the 10 and 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:24.130
 We also liked 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.540
 and we are going to put the two pieces of 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.870
 onion 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:31.930
 the garlic 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:34.510
 and the oregano a teaspoon of oregano 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.120
 and if they want to put a chili 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.129
 chipotle 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.409
 well we're going to liquefy it and we're going 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:43.480
 to add to the seafood that are 

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:46.569
 cooked what's here we're going to put 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:49.709
 a little olive oil 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:49.709
 to fry the sauce 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.660
 mine 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.110
 and we are going to put castings 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:27.990
 good with both for you 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.990
 ok here we are going to season with garlic salt 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:31.000
 chicken consommé 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.400
 and black pepper 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:39.810
 I remember and what 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:41.610
 it is to taste if it lacks more of this one 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.400
 if you want it more to the side where they can 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:46.790
 put more chicken consommé if not seal 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.129
 At the end 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:52.659
 it stays in the flavor and if it lacks 

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:52.659
 marley with the most chicken 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:58.720
 now that is 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.240
 well seasoned and everything then I'm going 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.760
 to put at 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:04.710
 counter that I'm going to put a 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:09.080
 teaspoon more than chicken bouillon like 

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:09.080
 that he lacked salt 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:16.310
 as I say it verifies in him 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:19.850
 please if you need an animal 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:23.450
 Here is the sauce we liquefy ready 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:26.320
 of chile california and this we are going to 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:26.320
 add carlos to 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.379
 with a pretty disc 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:37.710
 we're going to take all of them to the appointment and 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.710
 get nothing 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:48.220
 and that's how it goes, as I say 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.830
 lack of fish and shrimp but 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.740
 those are going to go at the end 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:55.120
 ok here I already paid you already spent 30 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:57.420
 minutes and is 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:01.170
 it's already cooked 

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:03.120
 and then we'll put the 

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:05.289
 shrimp and so off with the same 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:09.969
 hot 

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:11.469
 they are going to cook because if not with that 

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:13.300
 they had a being they light them in the pot 

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:16.509
 lines and nothing else 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:20.440
 especially to change color we started 

00:05:16.509 --> 00:05:23.529
 to learn how the fish is 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:26.390
 we are also going to put there 

00:05:23.529 --> 00:05:28.970
 and we are going to cover the pot and 

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:31.610
 and to whom they meet very quickly they look 

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:34.040
 the shrimp how they are left is already paid 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:35.800
 already as hot as the bird and the 

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:38.260
 landed fish 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:40.330
 it's going to be like that 

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.790
 Well, now I'm back for the signal 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:45.169
 wanted 

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:47.719
 the final result is more 

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:49.999
 we do not see another headline because here I am 

00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:51.620

00:05:49.999 --> 00:05:53.740

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:57.449
 yes at the end 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:57.449
 and the fish also here are 

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:03.280
 of being whole fish too 

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:07.670
 and that's how it was 

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:09.800
