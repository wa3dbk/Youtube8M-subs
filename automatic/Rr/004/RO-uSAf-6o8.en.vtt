online because from what I've noticed a
lot<00:00:21.600> of<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:21.960> vehicles<00:00:22.560> that<00:00:22.650> you'll<00:00:22.830> find

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
around aren't the premium vehicles that

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.810 
around aren't the premium vehicles that
people<00:00:25.439> need<00:00:25.650> to<00:00:25.680> purchase<00:00:25.949> and<00:00:26.340> customize

people need to purchase and customize

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.279 
people need to purchase and customize
and<00:00:27.150> you<00:00:27.210> can't<00:00:27.449> really<00:00:27.570> claim<00:00:27.840> them<00:00:28.050> as<00:00:28.109> your

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
and you can't really claim them as your

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.189 
and you can't really claim them as your
own<00:00:28.320> anyways<00:00:29.310> I<00:00:29.609> found<00:00:29.880> someone's<00:00:30.630> premium

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
own anyways I found someone's premium

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.229 
own anyways I found someone's premium
vehicle<00:00:31.560> here<00:00:31.769> and<00:00:31.949> we<00:00:32.489> want<00:00:32.700> to<00:00:32.790> do<00:00:32.910> is<00:00:33.090> go

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
vehicle here and we want to do is go

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.860 
vehicle here and we want to do is go
north<00:00:33.750> of<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.380> base<00:00:34.649> and<00:00:34.950> then<00:00:35.670> basically<00:00:36.390> you

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
north of the base and then basically you

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.869 
north of the base and then basically you
take<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.200> terrain<00:00:37.800> next<00:00:38.160> to<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.309> highway<00:00:38.670> as

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
take the terrain next to the highway as

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.170 
take the terrain next to the highway as
a<00:00:38.940> ramp<00:00:39.660> so<00:00:40.469> it<00:00:40.710> will<00:00:40.950> be<00:00:41.100> easier<00:00:41.550> with<00:00:42.000> a

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
a ramp so it will be easier with a

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.770 
a ramp so it will be easier with a
faster<00:00:42.960> vehicle<00:00:43.469> such<00:00:43.829> as<00:00:44.070> this<00:00:44.640> one<00:00:44.879> however

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
faster vehicle such as this one however

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.510 
faster vehicle such as this one however
later<00:00:46.140> I<00:00:46.260> will<00:00:46.469> show<00:00:46.620> you<00:00:46.890> that<00:00:47.160> it's<00:00:47.340> also

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
later I will show you that it's also

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.729 
later I will show you that it's also
possible<00:00:47.879> with<00:00:48.390> your<00:00:48.570> everyday<00:00:48.960> vehicle<00:00:49.590> on

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
possible with your everyday vehicle on

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:50.930

first open hangar here sometimes it's

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.889 
first open hangar here sometimes it's
not<00:00:59.010> spawned<00:00:59.520> right<00:00:59.670> away<00:00:59.969> but<00:01:00.030> as<00:01:00.449> soon<00:01:00.780> as

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
not spawned right away but as soon as

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.900 
not spawned right away but as soon as

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
done this it will spawn there so so it'd

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.830 
done this it will spawn there so so it'd

ocean or just fly up super high it's not

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.359 
ocean or just fly up super high it's not
that<00:01:36.750> difficult<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.229> hard<00:01:37.439> part<00:01:37.680> is<00:01:37.770> not<00:01:37.829> over

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
that difficult the hard part is not over

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.690 
that difficult the hard part is not over

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700

general now let us switch clips to a
regular<00:02:21.100> sedan<00:02:21.460> and<00:02:21.700> let<00:02:21.910> me<00:02:21.970> just<00:02:22.150> show<00:02:22.240> you

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
regular sedan and let me just show you

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:23.970 
regular sedan and let me just show you
guys<00:02:22.480> that<00:02:22.690> you<00:02:22.750> do<00:02:22.840> spawn<00:02:23.170> fairly<00:02:23.590> close<00:02:23.770> each

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
guys that you do spawn fairly close each

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.770 
guys that you do spawn fairly close each
time<00:02:24.190> you<00:02:24.310> do<00:02:24.430> die<00:02:24.610> next<00:02:24.910> to<00:02:25.030> military<00:02:25.420> base<00:02:25.600> if

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
time you do die next to military base if

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.020 
time you do die next to military base if
you<00:02:25.810> do<00:02:25.960> fail<00:02:26.200> so<00:02:26.950> just<00:02:27.190> with<00:02:27.310> a<00:02:27.340> regular<00:02:27.490> sedan

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
you do fail so just with a regular sedan

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.390 
you do fail so just with a regular sedan
usually<00:02:28.960> you<00:02:29.050> can<00:02:29.260> clear<00:02:29.590> it<00:02:29.620> pretty<00:02:29.890> well<00:02:30.130> is

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
usually you can clear it pretty well is

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.010 
usually you can clear it pretty well is
something<00:02:30.610> you'll<00:02:30.850> find<00:02:31.210> driving<00:02:31.720> out<00:02:31.840> in<00:02:31.960> the

something you'll find driving out in the

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.530 
something you'll find driving out in the
highway<00:02:32.380> so<00:02:32.950> don't<00:02:33.280> think<00:02:33.580> oh<00:02:33.700> my<00:02:34.000> gosh<00:02:34.240> should

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
i won't be able to do it that's that's

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:40.710 
i won't be able to do it that's that's
really<00:02:39.880> not<00:02:39.940> the<00:02:40.060> case<00:02:40.150> you<00:02:40.270> just<00:02:40.420> got<00:02:40.510> to<00:02:40.630> hit

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
really not the case you just got to hit

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.530 
really not the case you just got to hit
it<00:02:40.780> right<00:02:41.110> so<00:02:41.380> one<00:02:41.500> thing<00:02:41.650> I've<00:02:41.770> noticed<00:02:41.920> is

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
it right so one thing I've noticed is

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.030 
it right so one thing I've noticed is
don't<00:02:43.540> go<00:02:43.720> for<00:02:43.870> that<00:02:43.990> jet<00:02:44.260> that's<00:02:44.590> probably

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
don't go for that jet that's probably

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.410 
don't go for that jet that's probably
just<00:02:45.160> taxiing<00:02:45.700> you<00:02:45.910> always<00:02:46.090> want<00:02:46.240> to<00:02:46.270> go<00:02:46.360> to

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
just taxiing you always want to go to

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.030 
just taxiing you always want to go to
the<00:02:46.480> hangar<00:02:46.810> you<00:02:47.410> might<00:02:47.590> not<00:02:47.740> think<00:02:47.770> it's

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
the hangar you might not think it's

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.280 
the hangar you might not think it's
there<00:02:48.250> like<00:02:48.700> crap<00:02:49.540> it's<00:02:49.780> not<00:02:49.840> there<00:02:50.110> it's<00:02:50.260> not

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
there like crap it's not there it's not

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:51.720 
there like crap it's not there it's not
there<00:02:50.410> it's<00:02:50.650> not<00:02:50.680> there<00:02:50.800> and<00:02:51.130> then<00:02:51.250> it'll

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
there it's not there and then it'll

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.730 
there it's not there and then it'll
spawn<00:02:52.060> so<00:02:52.390> that's<00:02:53.050> what<00:02:53.170> I<00:02:53.200> found<00:02:53.410> for<00:02:53.620> most

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:53.740 
spawn so that's what I found for most

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:57.420 
spawn so that's what I found for most
cases<00:02:54.070> so<00:02:54.850> good<00:02:55.030> luck<00:02:55.240> now<00:02:55.950> going<00:02:56.950> back<00:02:57.160> to<00:02:57.310> the

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
cases so good luck now going back to the

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.670 
cases so good luck now going back to the
jump<00:02:57.730> try<00:02:58.330> to<00:02:58.390> stay<00:02:58.660> on<00:02:58.690> the<00:02:58.900> highway<00:02:59.320> as<00:02:59.470> much

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
jump try to stay on the highway as much

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.350 
jump try to stay on the highway as much
as<00:02:59.830> possible<00:03:00.040> because<00:03:00.400> if<00:03:00.790> you<00:03:00.940> just<00:03:01.090> go<00:03:01.330> for

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
as possible because if you just go for

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.080 
as possible because if you just go for
the<00:03:01.720> jump<00:03:01.960> right<00:03:02.290> when<00:03:02.770> the<00:03:03.490> side<00:03:03.790> of<00:03:03.880> the<00:03:03.940> road

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
the jump right when the side of the road

Khan opens up you will hit a bump and

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.340 
Khan opens up you will hit a bump and
you<00:03:06.070> will<00:03:06.310> probably<00:03:06.580> fail<00:03:07.120> so<00:03:07.810> definitely

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
you will probably fail so definitely

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.440 
you will probably fail so definitely

watch the footage a little bit to get a

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.930 
watch the footage a little bit to get a
better<00:03:10.540> idea<00:03:10.780> of<00:03:11.140> what<00:03:11.440> you<00:03:11.560> want<00:03:11.800> to<00:03:11.890> do<00:03:12.130> now

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
better idea of what you want to do now

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.090
