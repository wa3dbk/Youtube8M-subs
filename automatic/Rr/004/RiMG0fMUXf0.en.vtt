00:00:00.939 --> 00:00:07.550
 4 10 and 4 or to solve it gazpacho 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:11.269
 that this much we like him 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:12.950
 summer and as a refreshing food 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:14.719
 that you can drink the clever collage 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:16.340
 small pieces of egg cucumber peppers 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:18.740
 some little thing that people do 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.390
 but it's very good for tension without 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.070
 doubt good the best definition that 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.170
 we could make the gazpacho I think it's 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.359
 a liquid salad is not there 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:27.650
 I have absolutely said everything and now 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:29.900
 there is a work done by 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.540
 Spanish researchers who have 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.490
 surprised not to dump the content of 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.290
 sodium the salt content of many of 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:37.700
 these products could make it 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.830
 raised the blood pressure we're 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.500
 watching a Spanish study discover that 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:44.750
 the gazpacho helps to lower the tension 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.670
 blood pressure you did not see that to 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.470
 despite having sodium also these 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.330
 products obviously have potassium 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.730
 then that sodium and the 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:55.790
 potassium and it makes blood pressure 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.500
 instead of rising it decreases apart that 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:59.180
 consuming this type of products 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.280
 we eliminate risk factors 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.110
 cardiovascular for example cholesterol 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.269
 we are going to keep it wonderful going to 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.480
 raise even the good cholesterol now 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:10.490
 it turns out that it is also regulated 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:12.550
 we avoid obesity we avoid the accumulation 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:16.100
 of tools also in winter 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:18.560
 obviously and why not instead of having 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.150
 the refrigerator the frozen side we have it to 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.040
 room temperature we took it out of the 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.640
 We leave it at room temperature 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:27.170
 and we can get it 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.960
 good the hour of the gazpacho as it is 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.270
 pure vegetables to all but want to 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.700
 noon but it is important that it serves in 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.740
 tetrabrik or we can not believe that 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.770
 only the one done at home has these 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:42.080
 properties you can open a boat and 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.600
 take it and how does lycopene have 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:47.300
 is that part that pigment so red from 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.460
 tomato that is antioxidant does not matter 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:52.580
 we take it natural or from boat what 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:55.280
 important is to take it clear also of 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:57.110
 the fiber and the relationship that can be of 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.080
 color if it is very important 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.850
 the components the substances that it carries 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.000
 some fiber components that have 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:07.070
 and they warn us from society 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.020
 Spanish digestive system and also 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.959
 those who are dedicated to the study of cancer 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.550
 of colon that the consumption of fiber is very 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:16.160
 important to do it 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.950
 of colon cancer the more fiber 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.560
 take less risk you're going to run from having 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.240
 colon cancer 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.520
 they warn them and they tell us that the 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:28.040
 genetics obviously influences but in a 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:30.080
 lower percentage than we think without 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.440
 However, a diet rich in fiber 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:35.540
 good hydration and exercise 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.420
 this does have a direct influence on 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.830
 reduce the percentage of risk that 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.870
 you have to look like colon cancer and 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:44.270
 especially the consumption of fish and 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:47.300
 reduce the consumption of rich red meats 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:48.860
 besides Indian being saturated and above all 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.380
 that here we talk about olive oil 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.750
 also in the gazpacho which is an oil 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:56.120
 with monounsaturated fatty acids that is 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.400
 great and then also say that 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.870
 our digestive especially also 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.960
 is made to work in the morning 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:05.390
 for example when you eat it turns out that 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:07.430
 gastric emptying is much more 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:10.820
 fast before three in the morning 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:13.290
 that later in the afternoon or even in the 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:16.530
 morning fiber 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:18.930
 and three at noon if the morning the 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:21.599
 digestive also works better what 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.790
 is the emptying and digestion the 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:25.200
 ability to digest we have all the 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.459
 meals is usually from those of 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.900
 try that ball caps now 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.030
 wonderful and then the people after 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.819
 eating tends to take a nap and 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.980
 that's also great nap here 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:37.530
 it is being seen that it marks very well the 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:40.230
 circadian rhythms a nap at three o'clock 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.329
 which is when we have the smallest alert 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.549
 when the Americans fall asleep in 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:46.739
 the computers in harvard I say then to 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:48.689
 slopes a little half an hour but 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:51.419
 that nap will help improve the 

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:54.930
 rhythms but if it is short that is not 

00:03:51.419 --> 00:04:01.010
 pajamas that is television 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:01.010
 the famous or the teaspoon 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:16.010
 and also because it makes you wake up 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:22.500
 now with pep and we have a 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.330
 Llamadita pending of you good morning 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.770
 hello good morning to marilÃ³ to wear very 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:28.200
 well here we are throwing the story and 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.820
 you then very well also waiting 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:32.250
 here to talk with you loves 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:34.380
 good that you want we can help you type and 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.700
 look at the truth that I did not have more 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.070
 content a bit but I would like 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:40.560
 know if it is true that after 7 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:43.110
 In the afternoon, the 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:45.180
 carbohydrates or is it also true that the 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:47.430
 body slows down and not those more 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.570
 well and then I also have a doubt that 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:50.100
 I always have is that we have the 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:52.110
 custom at home always make snack 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:54.780
 dinner around eight thirty in the afternoon 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:56.670
 with children they are eight and ten years old and 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.780
 I wanted to know if I do well or not because 

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:59.520
 Sometimes I have the feeling of overtaking 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.770
 Zarina's a little if you 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.210
 I exactly step in front of bed 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:03.780
 then and be able to answer anything is 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:06.150
 Question 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:08.430
 and give them the dinner that now said eight pp 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:12.510
 and a half and puts them in bed at ten o'clock 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:14.310
 and they have another ten years since 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:16.200
 look at the snack for dinner is 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:18.120
 a great help indeed before 

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:21.240
 always the children took half in the 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:23.910
 dinner because the important thing here is that the 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:25.590
 child goes to bed soon there is a series of 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:27.180
 studies right now 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:29.100
 for example the study elena in three thousand 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:31.260
 and peak European teenagers that 

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:34.050
 show that in Spain the child sleeps 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:35.660
 little but it's because he goes to bed very late 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:38.010
 so if we go ahead with the snack 

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:40.080
 we advance the dinner the child is 

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:43.020
 prepared to sleep with a time 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:45.330
 Enough for nine thirty nine 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:48.240
 and be able to sleep nine hours 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:50.040
 necessary and obligatory that we have 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.990
 what to do so that the child is healthy and 

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:54.540
 especially so that he is not fat because 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:58.710
 sleep little fat 

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:58.710
 and we are going to send him the book 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:05.020
 to what we have highlighted in the 

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:06.790
 obesity but we also talk about 

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:09.970
 hypothyroidism for example we give many 

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:12.220
 advice on how to prevent those 

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:13.960
 calories that we eat others and especially 

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:16.020
 we talk about cardiovascular risk not 

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:20.050
 how to avoid that fat that accumulates 

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:22.560
 around not good now we go to the 

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:22.560
 foods
