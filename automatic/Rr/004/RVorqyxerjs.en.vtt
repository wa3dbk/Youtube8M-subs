little dirty on the outside because of

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:21.540 
little dirty on the outside because of
my<00:00:19.810> hands<00:00:20.560> had<00:00:20.679> brown<00:00:20.919> clay<00:00:21.130> on<00:00:21.279> them<00:00:21.429> when<00:00:21.519> i

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:21.550 
my hands had brown clay on them when i

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.960 
my hands had brown clay on them when i
wedged<00:00:21.820> him<00:00:22.060> but<00:00:22.929> that<00:00:23.289> won't<00:00:23.830> really<00:00:24.460> mess<00:00:24.820> up

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:24.970 
wedged him but that won't really mess up

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:26.970 
wedged him but that won't really mess up
the<00:00:25.119> effect<00:00:25.449> so<00:00:26.289> we're<00:00:26.439> going<00:00:26.529> to<00:00:26.619> start<00:00:26.890> by

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:26.980 
the effect so we're going to start by

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.349 
the effect so we're going to start by
centering<00:00:27.490> each<00:00:27.699> one<00:00:27.880> of<00:00:27.909> these<00:00:28.060> pieces

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:28.359 
centering each one of these pieces

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:30.060 
centering each one of these pieces
individually<00:00:28.749> stacking<00:00:29.650> them<00:00:29.710> on<00:00:29.800> top<00:00:30.009> of

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:30.070 
individually stacking them on top of

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.240 
individually stacking them on top of
each<00:00:30.279> other<00:00:30.460> to<00:00:31.590> make<00:00:32.590> the<00:00:32.739> quite<00:00:32.950> a<00:00:32.980> little

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:33.250 
each other to make the quite a little

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.110 
each other to make the quite a little
easier<00:00:33.550> to<00:00:33.579> work<00:00:33.790> with<00:00:33.870> so<00:00:34.870> off<00:00:35.200> to<00:00:35.260> the<00:00:35.680> wheel

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
easier to work with so off to the wheel

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.150 
easier to work with so off to the wheel
okay<00:00:37.120> so<00:00:37.180> here<00:00:37.690> we<00:00:37.810> have<00:00:37.840> the<00:00:38.290> first<00:00:38.560> piece

okay so we've got the second piece of

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:54.209 
okay so we've got the second piece of
clay<00:00:52.260> pretty<00:00:53.260> much<00:00:53.469> centered<00:00:53.769> on<00:00:53.920> the<00:00:53.949> top

00:00:54.209 --> 00:00:54.219 
clay pretty much centered on the top

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:56.009 
clay pretty much centered on the top
it's<00:00:54.489> not<00:00:54.670> perfect<00:00:55.120> but<00:00:55.300> we're<00:00:55.660> going<00:00:55.780> to<00:00:55.839> have

00:00:56.009 --> 00:00:56.019 
it's not perfect but we're going to have

00:00:56.019 --> 00:00:58.139 
it's not perfect but we're going to have
to<00:00:56.170> keep<00:00:56.530> centering<00:00:56.890> anyway<00:00:57.309> so<00:00:57.850> now<00:00:57.969> we're

00:00:58.139 --> 00:00:58.149 
to keep centering anyway so now we're

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:01.319 
to keep centering anyway so now we're
getting<00:00:58.359> ready<00:00:58.690> to<00:00:58.809> add<00:00:59.079> the<00:00:59.109> third<00:01:00.149> piece<00:01:01.149> of

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.650 
okay we're ready for the fourth piece
looks<00:01:12.530> like<00:01:12.800> the<00:01:12.980> porcelain<00:01:13.820> is<00:01:13.850> completely

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:14.660 
looks like the porcelain is completely

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.420 
looks like the porcelain is completely
gone<00:01:14.690> but<00:01:14.870> it's<00:01:15.170> not<00:01:15.380> it's<00:01:15.650> just<00:01:15.950> covered<00:01:16.160> up

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
gone but it's not it's just covered up

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.970 
gone but it's not it's just covered up
with<00:01:16.730> the<00:01:17.150> slip<00:01:18.790> so<00:01:19.790> as<00:01:20.000> you<00:01:20.120> can<00:01:20.270> see<00:01:20.510> it's

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:20.980 
with the slip so as you can see it's

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.130 
with the slip so as you can see it's
still<00:01:21.980> very<00:01:22.190> much<00:01:22.430> there<00:01:22.840> so<00:01:23.840> we're<00:01:23.960> going<00:01:24.080> to

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
still very much there so we're going to

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.110 
still very much there so we're going to
add<00:01:24.290> the<00:01:24.590> next<00:01:25.040> piece<00:01:25.220> of<00:01:25.250> porcelain<00:01:25.580> on<00:01:25.940> the

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:26.120 
add the next piece of porcelain on the

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.790 
add the next piece of porcelain on the
top<00:01:26.330> now<00:01:26.630> this<00:01:27.020> is<00:01:27.170> what<00:01:27.350> it<00:01:27.440> looks<00:01:27.620> like

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:27.800 
top now this is what it looks like

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.150 
top now this is what it looks like
before<00:01:28.310> I've<00:01:28.490> just<00:01:28.700> basically<00:01:29.180> slammed<00:01:29.690> the

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:30.160 
before I've just basically slammed the

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.560 
before I've just basically slammed the
porcelain<00:01:31.160> down<00:01:31.370> as<00:01:31.610> you<00:01:31.730> can<00:01:31.880> see<00:01:32.090> it<00:01:32.270> throws

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
porcelain down as you can see it throws

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.410 
porcelain down as you can see it throws
the<00:01:32.600> piece<00:01:33.590> off<00:01:33.830> center<00:01:34.190> so<00:01:34.340> you<00:01:34.370> got<00:01:34.610> to<00:01:34.790> work

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
the piece off center so you got to work

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.780 
the piece off center so you got to work
on<00:01:35.660> a<00:01:36.020> couple<00:01:36.710> things<00:01:36.890> one<00:01:37.340> you<00:01:37.370> don't<00:01:37.670> want

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:37.790 
on a couple things one you don't want

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.780 
on a couple things one you don't want
any<00:01:37.940> air<00:01:38.240> or<00:01:39.220> anything<00:01:40.220> to<00:01:40.400> get<00:01:40.520> in<00:01:40.700> between

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
any air or anything to get in between

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.080 
any air or anything to get in between
the<00:01:41.150> seam<00:01:41.450> there<00:01:41.479> and<00:01:42.110> then<00:01:42.710> to<00:01:42.979> you<00:01:43.700> have<00:01:43.940> to

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
the seam there and then to you have to

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.040 
the seam there and then to you have to
recenter<00:01:44.660> the<00:01:44.780> whole<00:01:44.960> piece<00:01:45.200> because<00:01:47.050> you

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:48.050 
recenter the whole piece because you

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.650 
recenter the whole piece because you
know<00:01:48.200> as<00:01:48.229> the<00:01:48.770> force<00:01:49.340> you<00:01:49.640> put<00:01:49.850> this<00:01:50.030> clay<00:01:50.450> down

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:50.660 
know as the force you put this clay down

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:52.480 
know as the force you put this clay down
kind<00:01:51.380> of<00:01:51.470> throws<00:01:51.680> the<00:01:51.860> rest<00:01:51.979> of<00:01:52.160> this<00:01:52.280> off

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
kind of throws the rest of this off

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.090 
kind of throws the rest of this off
whack<00:01:52.940> so<00:01:53.600> we're<00:01:54.080> going<00:01:54.140> to<00:01:54.290> work<00:01:54.560> that<00:01:54.830> clay

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
whack so we're going to work that clay

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.000 
whack so we're going to work that clay
into<00:01:55.310> our<00:01:55.640> mix<00:01:55.880> now<00:01:56.150> and<00:01:56.680> then<00:01:57.680> we're<00:01:57.860> going<00:01:57.950> to
