00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:11.759
 Hey, people, beauty. 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.750
 continuing the study of metazoans in 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.940
 previous class 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.900
 we saw the nematodes or nematelmintos 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.650
 now we go to the fifth edge the annelids 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.990
 here we go 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.630
 the word elÃ­dio refers to its body 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.640
 divided into earthworm rings in the 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.279
 However the technical term for these rings 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.560
 is a metalworker so we can say that they 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.540
 have a metalized metal body 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:38.930
 improvement or have the body divided into 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:44.360
 methane mere examples the earthworm is clear 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:47.100
 This is a very good leech. 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.320
 of these three rings is the least known 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.270
 has no practical application then 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.789
 is usually very uncommon in 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.010
 vestibular disease has application in the 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.890
 agriculture through the bus and 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:02.309
 tunnels that it just blows and drains 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:05.040
 a soil and blood sucks were again 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.110
 used in medicine because they 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.780
 the anticoagulants of their saliva 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.030
 establishes circulation in tissues 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.810
 damaged and damaged tissues 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.340
 let's look at the characteristics 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.710
 worm on your screen 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.210
 if we took an embryo from her and did a 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.710
 cross section 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:28.490
 we will see the internal structure expanded in 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:31.079
 Down here we have the manager system and 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.840
 externally invest in the embryo we have to 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.820
 ectoderm in the middle in pink the same dermis 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.490
 and the yellow coating system 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.400
 history of endodermia as well as all 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:44.070
 animals since flatlmintos nicknames 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:48.420
 are tribes and there is also a 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:51.240
 filled with liquid similar to the 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.670
 but this space is not 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.299
 coated with mesoderm and endoderm 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.100
 as pseudo sealed one of the mateus mendes 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:02.340
 the annelids this quality is coated 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.469
 totally by mesoderme then the name 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.320
 of this quality is a stamp a 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:10.140
 true as the pseudo filomena 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.550
 skeleton has hydrostatic function but 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.590
 is no longer essential for transport 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.540
 of nutrient gases because in it 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.550
 child has arisen the circulatory system or 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.709
 cardiovascular 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.260
 then the other function of the sludge is 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:25.080
 internal organs and facilitate the 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.940
 movement of some of them as the heart 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.069
 watch nematelminto up there and 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.739
 He attended his cell one county 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:36.110
 the worm if you want to pause the 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:39.260
 video do comparison can continue 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:41.910
 good in relation to the excretory system 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.250
 watch the worm again 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:47.160
 if we expand the metalwork and the system 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:50.670
 excretory we will have a tube that 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:53.849
 highly refined yellow and which filters 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:56.220
 besides the liquid sealed matiko also the 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:59.400
 blood in the blood vessels 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.379
 this tube is to attach phygium or cold target 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.430
 and expressions are thrown for the 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:07.799
 through the pores writers 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:11.370
 usually there is a pair of wires per methane 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:14.250
 meruoca io nervous system too 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:16.500
 to abandon but much more complex than 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.959
 nematodes and the digestive system is 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.480
 complete as well as that of the 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:24.269
 Now let's see what this 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.700
 photo there the worms 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:28.739
 they are a tas or monex fraud so 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.900
 as the plenary side the flu platelminto 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:33.540
 and just as the plenary 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.670
 do cross-fertilization see them 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:38.760
 slope pores of the reproductive system and 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:40.590
 sperm to pass mutually 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.959
 the criterion of each other 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.609
 then a case of this criterion of 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:47.280
 where newborn worms come out 

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:49.290
 therefore the development is direct 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.120
 good beyond the goal the improvement of the cinema 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.560
 as evolutionary novelties 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.680
 we already see that in this film the 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.840
 circulatory system and also came the 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.000
 respiratory system, let's go to them 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.139
 first circulatory system 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.760
 there are two types 

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:03.989
 these circles represents the cut of the 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.150
 animal the circulatory system 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:09.450
 necessarily need a heart 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:12.000
 vases and blood right then that part 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.950
 plus the ball represents the heart 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.630
 we have the blood vessels there too 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:17.700
 on the left 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:21.750
 there is space between the cells called 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:23.280
 of gaps and if you observe well you will 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.599
 see that the blood vessels are not 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.970
 continuous 

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:28.980
 then the heart pumps out the blood that comes out 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:31.050
 by the vessels goes to the gaps of 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:33.090
 back to the heart by openings 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.710
 existing in it as blood leaves the 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.660
 circulatory system and back to it 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.970
 then it is called the circulatory system 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.320
 open and how it has gaps can be 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:43.290
 also called the circulatory system 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:45.750
 and the one on the left now 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:48.210
 we observe the blood vessels they are 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:51.330
 the arteries are continuous 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:54.870
 capillaries that are continuous with the veins 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:57.150
 then in this system the blood is pumped 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:58.770
 by the heart through the arteries in 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.990
 capillaries they caught by means of 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:02.340
 tissues back to the veins and back 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:04.530
 letter of attorney 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.940
 then in this system the cells 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:07.650
 usually do not 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:09.990
 circulatory system then the 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:12.360
 closed circulatory system 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:13.710
 animals have one of these two systems 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:16.290
 system is present in the 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:18.690
 molluscs except us and spoke puddings and 

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:20.880
 is also present in arthropods 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:22.980
 already the closed one is present in annelids 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:26.510
 cephalopod molluscum as the people and the 

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:28.560
 squid and the corded echinoderms 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:29.460
 echinoderms people have no system 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:32.280
 circulatory 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:35.930
 ok associated with the circulatory system 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:38.490
 we have the respiratory go to it 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:39.870
 in these homes we will see four types of 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:42.510
 respiratory system 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:45.090
 there, this circus represents the 

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:47.100
 animal and the respiratory system formed 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:51.810
 by internal bags to the body that 

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:54.240
 they fill and empty themselves of air 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:59.070
 then it is a lung that draws oxygen from the 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:06:00.330
 right air then air breathing is observed 

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:02.790
 this other 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:04.380
 are several tubes that branch out and 

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:06.210
 penetrates the body of the animal 

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:09.000
 in this not the participation of the system 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:12.780
 circulatory system in gas transport is 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.700
 instruction, then the air enters 

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:18.360
 through the trachea leads direct oxygen 

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:20.520
 to the cells and leaves the trachea and 

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:22.190
 the new oxygen draws off the 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:25.640
 breathing is aerial 

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:28.140
 Watch this now when the pf na ume d 

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:31.490
 vascularization facilitates gas exchange 

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:34.800
 then the breath is called cutaneous 

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:37.169
 and in this case both the oxygen present 

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:40.040
 in the air or dissolved in the water may 

00:06:37.169 --> 00:06:44.510
 penetrate the skin then breathe 

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:46.580
 so then the breathing is aerial 

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:49.100
 but also has aquatic animals that 

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:51.230
 make a cutaneous breath and finally 

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:54.220
 have been highly and externally folded the 

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:57.970
 body making gas exchanges look there 

00:06:54.220 --> 00:07:00.230
 with water then it's just a white one then 

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:02.390
 aquatic inspiration because white 

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:04.940
 removed this genie dissolved in water and 

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:07.910
 finally the classification 

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:10.010
 are three classes of annelids the class 

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:13.660
 policy that you mean many ballots 

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:16.340
 your example of the law 

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:18.220
 in this class inspection of organs or 

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:21.440
 has male and female and cross fertilization 

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:24.080
 the coast bound that you which means little 

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:25.970
 bristles the example in hollow 

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:28.700
 so we have already seen that earthworms are 

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:31.640
 dolls but they do cross fertilization and 

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:33.680
 development is direct and the class that 

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:35.540
 you 100 ballots or hydrogen money 

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:37.370
 we are talking about the 

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:39.290
 then the species are 

00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:42.530
 dolls just like us worms and 

00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:44.930
 cross-fertilization also alongside 

00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:49.460
 We have an abstract if you want to 

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:51.970
 video and personal coop of annelids is this 

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:56.830
 Next class we will see the molluscs 

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:56.830
 hugs and even more total
