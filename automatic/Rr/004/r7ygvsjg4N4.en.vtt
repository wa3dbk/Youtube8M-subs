00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.160 
phone whilst in the case volume buttons
are<00:02:09.479> principled<00:02:10.050> they<00:02:10.349> will<00:02:10.530> take<00:02:10.770> a<00:02:10.800> little

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
are principled they will take a little

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.210 
are principled they will take a little
of<00:02:11.340> give<00:02:12.930> silence<00:02:13.930> which<00:02:14.110> also<00:02:14.560> accessible

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
of give silence which also accessible

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.729 
of give silence which also accessible
and<00:02:15.400> the<00:02:16.030> whole<00:02:16.180> switch<00:02:16.390> is<00:02:16.540> nice<00:02:16.720> too<00:02:16.989> so<00:02:17.680> you

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739 
and the whole switch is nice too so you

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:18.900 
and the whole switch is nice too so you
can<00:02:17.890> see<00:02:18.040> it<00:02:18.099> out<00:02:18.190> on<00:02:18.310> the<00:02:18.400> front<00:02:18.640> it<00:02:18.790> has

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
can see it out on the front it has

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.479 
can see it out on the front it has
cutouts<00:02:19.450> for<00:02:20.020> all<00:02:20.170> of<00:02:20.349> the<00:02:20.500> features<00:02:21.459> of

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
cutouts for all of the features of

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:24.720 
cutouts for all of the features of
though<00:02:22.080> I<00:02:23.080> have<00:02:23.650> done<00:02:23.830> a<00:02:23.860> call<00:02:24.099> quality<00:02:24.489> test

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
though I have done a call quality test

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.000 
though I have done a call quality test
and<00:02:25.030> it's<00:02:25.780> pretty<00:02:26.200> much<00:02:26.349> perfect

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
and it's pretty much perfect

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.670 
and it's pretty much perfect

bottom as well you've got cutouts for
the<00:02:31.510> microphones<00:02:32.080> so<00:02:32.830> all<00:02:33.160> in<00:02:33.370> all<00:02:33.489> really

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
the microphones so all in all really

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.520 
the microphones so all in all really
impressed<00:02:34.390> with<00:02:34.480> the<00:02:34.600> case<00:02:34.780> one<00:02:35.050> thing<00:02:35.260> I<00:02:35.319> have

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
impressed with the case one thing I have

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.860 
impressed with the case one thing I have
noticed<00:02:35.770> is<00:02:36.450> when<00:02:37.450> you're<00:02:37.600> playing<00:02:37.780> music

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
noticed is when you're playing music

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.339 
noticed is when you're playing music
through<00:02:38.650> the<00:02:38.800> case<00:02:39.120> obviously<00:02:40.120> because<00:02:40.720> it's

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:41.349 
through the case obviously because it's

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:43.500 
through the case obviously because it's
pretty<00:02:41.680> much<00:02:41.860> covered<00:02:42.220> up<00:02:42.340> it's<00:02:42.970> not<00:02:43.180> as<00:02:43.330> loud

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
pretty much covered up it's not as loud

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.930 
pretty much covered up it's not as loud
and<00:02:43.870> the<00:02:43.989> case<00:02:44.230> does<00:02:44.590> vibrate<00:02:45.400> and<00:02:45.519> stuff<00:02:45.700> but

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
and the case does vibrate and stuff but

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.900 
and the case does vibrate and stuff but
nothing<00:02:46.690> to<00:02:46.959> really<00:02:47.140> worry<00:02:47.230> about<00:02:47.530> I<00:02:48.190> mean

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
nothing to really worry about I mean

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:50.910 
nothing to really worry about I mean
this<00:02:49.660> case<00:02:49.900> will<00:02:50.170> pretty<00:02:50.350> much<00:02:50.440> protect<00:02:50.830> your

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
this case will pretty much protect your

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.550 
this case will pretty much protect your
phone<00:02:51.010> from<00:02:51.069> anything<00:02:51.610> so<00:02:52.360> I'm<00:02:52.930> gonna<00:02:53.200> dunk

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
I'm going to put this under the water

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.170 
I'm going to put this under the water
and<00:03:03.489> I'm<00:03:03.640> also<00:03:03.790> gonna<00:03:04.950> film<00:03:05.950> it<00:03:06.069> on<00:03:06.250> the<00:03:06.700> the

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
and I'm also gonna film it on the the

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.170 
and I'm also gonna film it on the the
lifeproof<00:03:07.360> case<00:03:07.780> as<00:03:07.989> well<00:03:08.970> so<00:03:09.970> it's

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
lifeproof case as well so it's

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.570 
lifeproof case as well so it's
definitely<00:03:10.890> just<00:03:11.890> double-checking

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580 
definitely just double-checking

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.640 
definitely just double-checking
everything<00:03:12.760> is<00:03:13.390> secure<00:03:14.319> so<00:03:14.890> wish<00:03:15.040> me<00:03:15.190> luck<00:03:16.650> so

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
everything is secure so wish me luck so

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:33.150 
everything is secure so wish me luck so
you<00:03:17.829> can<00:03:17.980> see<00:03:26.730> that<00:03:27.730> looks<00:03:27.880> point<00:03:28.180> to<00:03:28.269> me

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.850 

it's<00:03:33.790> a<00:03:33.820> bit<00:03:33.940> hard<00:03:34.090> to<00:03:34.210> press<00:03:34.650> just<00:03:35.650> see<00:03:35.800> if

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:35.860 
it's a bit hard to press just see if

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:43.110 
it's a bit hard to press just see if
it's<00:03:36.130> compressible<00:03:39.420> under<00:03:40.420> the<00:03:40.510> water<00:03:42.120> okay

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
it's compressible under the water okay

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.480 
it's compressible under the water okay
so<00:03:43.180> I<00:03:43.360> can't<00:03:44.280> fully<00:03:45.280> use<00:03:45.490> the<00:03:45.640> phone

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:47.490 
so I can't fully use the phone

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:51.750 
so I can't fully use the phone

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
should be still we had to use a camera

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.140 
should be still we had to use a camera
if<00:03:53.650> you<00:03:53.830> make<00:03:54.280> sure<00:03:54.310> you<00:03:54.460> said<00:03:54.700> it<00:03:54.820> before<00:03:54.880> you

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
that concludes my review of the

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.740 
that concludes my review of the
lifeproof<00:04:10.420> case<00:04:10.810> for<00:04:11.080> the<00:04:11.200> iPhone<00:04:11.650> 5<00:04:11.860> this<00:04:12.640> is

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
lifeproof case for the iPhone 5 this is

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.300 
lifeproof case for the iPhone 5 this is
possibly<00:04:13.750> the<00:04:13.840> best<00:04:14.140> case<00:04:14.380> out<00:04:14.710> of<00:04:14.770> the<00:04:14.950> market

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
possibly the best case out of the market

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.100 
possibly the best case out of the market
just<00:04:15.400> cause<00:04:15.580> it's<00:04:15.730> so<00:04:15.790> slimline<00:04:16.390> and<00:04:16.720> very

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:17.110 
just cause it's so slimline and very

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:20.400 
just cause it's so slimline and very
lightweight<00:04:17.290> as<00:04:17.620> well<00:04:18.239> it's<00:04:19.239> tested<00:04:19.810> to<00:04:20.050> all

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.410 
lightweight as well it's tested to all

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:24.150 
lightweight as well it's tested to all
the<00:04:20.680> military<00:04:21.010> standards<00:04:21.489> or<00:04:22.240> so<00:04:22.570> and<00:04:23.160> water

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
proof as I've just demonstrated as well
