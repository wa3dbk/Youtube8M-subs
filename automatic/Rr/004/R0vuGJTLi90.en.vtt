we've got a quick question for you about
these<00:00:05.819> two<00:00:05.879> squares<00:00:06.680> true<00:00:07.680> or<00:00:07.919> false<00:00:08.280> this<00:00:09.120> top

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
these two squares true or false this top

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.870 
these two squares true or false this top
one<00:00:09.690> here<00:00:09.719> is<00:00:10.139> a<00:00:10.230> darker<00:00:10.860> gray<00:00:11.190> than<00:00:11.219> the

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
one here is a darker gray than the

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.560 
one here is a darker gray than the
bottom<00:00:12.210> one<00:00:13.549> pretty<00:00:14.549> obvious<00:00:15.030> right

well<00:00:16.379> maybe<00:00:16.920> not<00:00:17.449> because<00:00:18.449> the<00:00:18.690> answer<00:00:19.109> is

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
well maybe not because the answer is

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.150 
well maybe not because the answer is
actually<00:00:19.859> false<00:00:21.289> believe<00:00:22.289> it<00:00:22.410> or<00:00:22.500> not<00:00:22.619> they

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
it sees what illusions tell us is that

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.209 
it sees what illusions tell us is that
what<00:00:42.899> we're<00:00:43.020> trying<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.559> see<00:00:43.710> is<00:00:43.829> not<00:00:44.010> the

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
what we're trying to see is not the

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.450 
what we're trying to see is not the
world<00:00:44.370> as<00:00:44.550> it<00:00:44.670> is<00:00:44.700> but<00:00:45.090> something<00:00:45.840> else

world as it is but something else
we're<00:00:47.460> actually<00:00:47.789> generating<00:00:48.570> perceptions<00:00:49.140> of

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
we're actually generating perceptions of

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.010 
we're actually generating perceptions of
a<00:00:49.680> world<00:00:49.860> that's<00:00:49.980> useful<00:00:50.670> to<00:00:50.730> see<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:51.570> that

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
a world that's useful to see and that

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.260 
a world that's useful to see and that
useful<00:00:52.469> perception<00:00:53.250> doesn't<00:00:53.879> actually<00:00:54.000> have

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
useful perception doesn't actually have

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.619 
useful perception doesn't actually have
to<00:00:54.360> correspond<00:00:54.870> with<00:00:54.899> what's<00:00:55.379> actually<00:00:55.590> there

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:56.629 
to correspond with what's actually there

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:59.209 
to correspond with what's actually there
all<00:00:57.629> right<00:00:57.750> well<00:00:57.899> look<00:00:58.109> at<00:00:58.260> this<00:00:58.410> cube<00:00:59.160> here

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
all right well look at this cube here

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.979 
all right well look at this cube here
what<00:00:59.910> if<00:01:00.000> I<00:01:00.120> told<00:01:00.329> you<00:01:00.510> that<00:01:00.539> those<00:01:00.809> two

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
what if I told you that those two

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.139 
what if I told you that those two
surfaces<00:01:01.170> are<00:01:01.530> exactly<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.129> same<00:01:02.160> would<00:01:03.059> you

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
surfaces are exactly the same would you

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.090 
surfaces are exactly the same would you
believe<00:01:03.270> me<00:01:03.570> I<00:01:03.750> would<00:01:04.080> okay<00:01:04.799> come<00:01:05.460> on<00:01:05.580> up<00:01:06.080> okay

what's going on tell us are we changing

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.999 
what's going on tell us are we changing
the<00:02:06.119> surface<00:02:06.299> what's<00:02:07.110> changing<00:02:07.619> our

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
the surface what's changing our

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.460 
the surface what's changing our
perception<00:02:08.670> our<00:02:08.700> perceptions<00:02:09.269> change<00:02:09.509> okay

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
perception our perceptions change okay

perception our perceptions change okay
why<00:02:10.640> that's<00:02:11.640> the<00:02:11.849> question<00:02:12.120> if<00:02:12.180> we<00:02:12.209> could

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
why that's the question if we could

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.360 
why that's the question if we could
understand<00:02:12.870> this<00:02:13.080> we<00:02:13.680> would<00:02:13.830> understand<00:02:14.250> how

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
understand this we would understand how

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:15.190 
understand this we would understand how
the<00:02:14.430> brain<00:02:14.640> works

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
the brain works

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.160 
the brain works
your<00:02:16.200> brains<00:02:16.440> using<00:02:16.830> its<00:02:16.920> past<00:02:17.130> experience<00:02:17.640> to

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
your brains using its past experience to

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.000 
your brains using its past experience to
generate<00:02:19.170> his<00:02:19.260> perceptions<00:02:19.800> of<00:02:19.890> the<00:02:19.980> world

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
generate his perceptions of the world

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.759 
generate his perceptions of the world
and<00:02:20.489> so<00:02:21.150> the<00:02:21.630> brain<00:02:21.840> looks<00:02:22.110> at<00:02:22.230> this<00:02:22.319> image<00:02:22.650> and

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769 
and so the brain looks at this image and

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:25.550 
and so the brain looks at this image and
it<00:02:22.860> says<00:02:23.040> ah<00:02:23.220> this<00:02:23.400> surface<00:02:24.060> is<00:02:25.019> in<00:02:25.319> shadow

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
it says ah this surface is in shadow

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.070 
it says ah this surface is in shadow
okay<00:02:26.430> if<00:02:26.610> this<00:02:27.060> surface<00:02:27.269> were<00:02:27.540> action<00:02:27.989> in

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
okay if this surface were action in

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.620 
okay if this surface were action in
shadow<00:02:28.350> and<00:02:28.799> returning<00:02:29.760> the<00:02:29.940> same<00:02:30.180> amount<00:02:30.510> of

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
shadow and returning the same amount of

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.150 
shadow and returning the same amount of
light<00:02:30.780> to<00:02:30.810> your<00:02:31.019> eye<00:02:31.049> as<00:02:31.319> this<00:02:31.590> surface<00:02:31.980> which

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
light to your eye as this surface which

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.740 
light to your eye as this surface which
seems<00:02:32.430> to<00:02:32.610> be<00:02:32.670> in<00:02:32.760> light<00:02:32.970> this<00:02:33.420> would<00:02:33.600> actually

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
seems to be in light this would actually

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.900 
seems to be in light this would actually
have<00:02:34.019> to<00:02:34.080> be<00:02:34.170> more<00:02:34.319> reflective<00:02:34.670> there's<00:02:35.670> less

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
have to be more reflective there's less

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.000 
have to be more reflective there's less
light<00:02:36.120> hitting<00:02:36.330> it<00:02:36.510> but<00:02:37.230> the<00:02:37.350> same<00:02:37.560> amount<00:02:37.709> is

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
light hitting it but the same amount is

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.550 
light hitting it but the same amount is
hitting<00:02:38.220> our<00:02:38.310> eyes<00:02:38.400> this<00:02:38.610> one<00:02:38.819> right<00:02:39.540> and<00:02:39.900> so

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
hitting our eyes this one right and so

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.680 
hitting our eyes this one right and so
that's<00:02:40.739> why<00:02:40.920> you<00:02:40.980> see<00:02:41.190> it<00:02:41.280> as<00:02:41.400> lighter<00:02:41.690> was

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
that's why you see it as lighter was

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.490 
that's why you see it as lighter was
