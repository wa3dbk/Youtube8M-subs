00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:10.000
 the front of the queue 

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:14.410
 especially 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:21.099
 of the sides of the skirt and 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:24.880
 foreigners people here have 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:27.430
 many your dreams and your dogs but to 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:30.130
 I know you are in contact with the 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:31.719
 skin you have to remove this we suffer 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:36.020
 we have with the instruments for 

00:00:31.719 --> 00:00:38.510
 retire a 4 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.820
 a dump 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:45.280
 that carries some blades like those of 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:49.149
 crime but it's more more short folder and 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:52.760
 It has a handle to work the best 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:55.549
 of the way of teaching and then the 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:58.510
 streaming blade techniques 

00:00:55.549 --> 00:01:01.190
 then I will teach you how to use them 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.379
 to remove from your hair 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:06.110
 all three are used so simply 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:09.490
 as if we were tempted a but it is that 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:14.780
 something birth of zeal from top to bottom 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:16.729
 or top down the emptying was completed what 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.230
 same the only difference is that I'm going to 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:21.360
 pay more for the dog's fur 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:25.970
 to have more consistency and go 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.970
 retreating in the greater god to death 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:33.450
 I can do it like that in little doors 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.450
 and what is worth is the same 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:40.799
 I am removing this subsoil that is 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:43.979
 inside and I'm leaving hair 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:47.520
 outside I get with this that the 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:50.460
 outer hair have greater hardness and be 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:53.670
 a lot more healthy hair because the 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.560
 hair that I'm withdrawing is going to let 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.510
 born thicker hair 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:02.640
 and good as you can see, you can use this 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:05.890
 I'll go through all this not all the dog 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:09.900
 these areas of the back are also these 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.900
 fantastic rear areas 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.930
 throughout the area you see that the dog 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.870
 she has a lot of her hair 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:23.370
 too much volume predominates in this topic 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.370
 this volume a dog 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:31.930
 I use a Martian 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:35.459
 that you understand how a quad was used 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.459
 the same for you 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:45.420
 which is used more than more works 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.970
 because it tends to hook you see a 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:51.780
 hook and tends to hook the hair 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:54.840
 long then in areas of skirts has 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:59.190
 very good because we are doing the 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:02.840
 long and deserved hair removal from 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.840
 work as we would work 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:09.820
 with a trimming blade if you do not 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:11.710
 we use like a comb that now 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:14.580
 will teach how to use it as a comb 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:18.430
 the skirt would have to withdraw and 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:20.920
 catch the sharp identity 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.569
 is very comfortable with this because as 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:26.520
 we work like a penis 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:30.430
 we remove with the hook 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:32.920
 important to grab skin the skin where 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:36.100
 You see that you are taking care of the 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:38.440
 hook it is important to grab 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.020
 win them and it 's for our life not at 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:43.280
 dog 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:43.280
 and with me 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:51.250
 If used as a comb, remember 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:53.800
 That dog has a lot of entanglements 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:56.350
 to remove a lot of hair because they are 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:58.930
 fed the egg machines to the 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:00.660
 time she takes our hair 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.400
 OK 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:05.100
 Well, with all these three 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.930
 simple that I have here I'm going to go 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:09.030
 doing the dog that will help me for 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.350
 all this dog by solita in and average 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:13.530
 easy 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:18.050
 I also teach you to use 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:18.050
 the blade detrimentally as if it were 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:29.940
 let's take that for yes yes this is intensive and 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:33.610
 a lot of patience and want to do things 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:36.310
 because every utensil is not all bad 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:38.139
 but clearly if hardly fail to 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:40.690
 a man or we will be able to use for 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:43.330
 certain things right now with this 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:48.090
 rib dog is not screaming h 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:48.090
 I'm going to spend it working like this 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:57.469
 but I have the advantage of having my coa 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:05:01.650
 I 'm going faster 

00:04:57.469 --> 00:05:04.139
 faster because now I'm going to work 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:06.590
 with cabbage in other types of hair 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:09.330
 we would also let you work with this 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:16.530
 or you even have a lot of much 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:19.080
 ball over the area here I do not need 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:20.639
 remove you need to remove here in this 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.560
 volume here because of what it 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:25.430
 about 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:27.830
 have a house or is 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:29.540
 those very good ones no longer comes out 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:32.009
 fails to subtract 

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:34.229
 this is stuck 

00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:35.980
 so I exaggerate it more so you see this 

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:40.260
 it is not a part of us 

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:43.629
 when this takes away and here volume 

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:46.250
 so get a straight peace 

00:05:43.629 --> 00:05:47.670
 everything that expires and the 

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:49.680
 are good 

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:52.190
 you have to know how to use them and how 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:54.920
 use 11 

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:57.510
 well they let us continue 

00:05:54.920 --> 00:06:00.770
 when we 

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:00.770
 you have to how to separate
