00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:11.169 
that up because i'm not sure if they're

00:04:11.169 --> 00:04:12.780 
that up because i'm not sure if they're
gonna<00:04:11.349> be<00:04:11.530> hard<00:04:11.769> to<00:04:11.799> find<00:04:12.010> later<00:04:12.340> on<00:04:12.519> down<00:04:12.730> the

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
gonna be hard to find later on down the

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:14.220 
gonna be hard to find later on down the
road<00:04:12.940> so<00:04:13.389> it<00:04:13.480> could<00:04:13.630> be<00:04:13.660> a<00:04:13.720> collector's<00:04:14.079> item

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
road so it could be a collector's item

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:15.930 
road so it could be a collector's item
it's<00:04:14.470> still<00:04:14.680> sealed<00:04:14.950> so<00:04:15.190> look<00:04:15.370> at<00:04:15.459> that<00:04:15.609> if<00:04:15.760> you

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
it's still sealed so look at that if you

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:17.400 
it's still sealed so look at that if you
just<00:04:16.150> want<00:04:16.299> to<00:04:16.359> hold<00:04:16.450> onto<00:04:16.660> and<00:04:16.930> flip<00:04:17.139> it<00:04:17.169> for<00:04:17.349> a

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410 
just want to hold onto and flip it for a

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:18.719
