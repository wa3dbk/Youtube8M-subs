00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:33.500 
and I thought maybe this is what I'm

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.469 
and I thought maybe this is what I'm
supposed<00:04:34.010> to<00:04:34.100> be<00:04:34.280> doing<00:04:34.310> because<00:04:35.180> there's<00:04:35.390> a

00:04:35.469 --> 00:04:35.479 
supposed to be doing because there's a

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:37.390 
supposed to be doing because there's a
child<00:04:35.750> I<00:04:36.080> never<00:04:36.440> knew<00:04:36.680> what<00:04:36.919> I<00:04:36.950> was<00:04:37.130> going<00:04:37.340> to

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
child I never knew what I was going to

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.850 
child I never knew what I was going to
do<00:04:37.550> what<00:04:37.729> I<00:04:37.850> grew<00:04:38.090> up<00:04:38.210> but<00:04:38.479> I<00:04:38.930> think<00:04:39.530> this<00:04:39.710> has

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:39.860 
do what I grew up but I think this has

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.490 
do what I grew up but I think this has
been<00:04:39.890> my<00:04:40.220> calling<00:04:40.669> so<00:04:41.390> I<00:04:41.419> started<00:04:41.870> focusing<00:04:42.050> on
