00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.350
 Hello and welcome 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.179
 today we're going to talk like 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.370
 that in the end are close I'll go 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.130
 explain why not associate way 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.240
 red and local 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:16.740
 when you want to approach it red 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.960
 you often think about equipping yourself 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.510
 of a jar and you advised those 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.769
 here is a nice word caviar or a little corner 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.330
 of nature that you have power to me 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.590
 retrench anywhere since he did 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.990
 no need for electrical outlet 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.210
 the problem is that this type of paradise 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.980
 with this fish that turns this savings 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.070
 is certain that he will quickly transform himself 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.380
 in a nightmare and become those one a 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.750
 ball full of our green that are 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.280
 very requested and there you are going to have to 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.809
 worries that will start our fish 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.350
 may have died is a little more than 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.539
 three days 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.280
 it's very crisp and you have a 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.809
 relatively poorly star cluster and 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.879
 not attack vain both or 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.010
 three days so I'm testing the image here 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.870
 that you may have jar it's up to 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.879
 tell your cat who is playing with the fish 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.379
 red goldfish in quotation marks 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.239
 by the way who does not really appreciate 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.489
 to have a predator with him and 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.739
 who is going a little bit stressed why one 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.510
 finds himself hardly vocal that feels very 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.820
 bad with green water is a 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.860
 fish that we sometimes see call 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.320
 it's very simple a jar a volume 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.119
 very much lower than it takes 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.740
 for a fish center weight 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.350
 find locked up in his tiny 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.330
 volume where he makes his excrement where they 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.979
 eat and where they breathe water 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.020
 very soon becomes guy siÃ© 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.119
 it's like having a little pond 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.650
 stagnant at home except that there you 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.450
 have a living being inside 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.490
 moreover you are going to have an interview 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.049
 terrible that is to say that both 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.390
 three days you will have to change 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.220
 water and clean the inside of the jar 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.070
 since it is going to be tribune what is 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.899
 normal only problem is that you 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.820
 go quickly fed up and the 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.310
 fish goes fast very c is like a 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.320
 fish stress and that it is subject to 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.930
 physiological stress I do not speak the 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.430
 stress in the head but physiological 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.759
 therefore temperature changes 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:59.399
 of water changes phd hardness and c 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.140
 is well it makes him sick and the 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.479
 hatch white dots there are 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.600
 information that it is external internal 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.250
 so the banana fish 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.810
 mood that's why do not look at me 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.700
 your fish very long in a 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.680
 jar because he dies quickly to 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.290
 because of the repeated stress of the interviews 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:18.800
 among other things besides the fact that the volume 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.390
 is small and all that is like 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.709
 a little hand there is also the fact that 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.100
 the goldfish is way too big 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:27.620
 for a small volume and for the diameter 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.510
 actually a ball which are 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.830
 goldfish when you loose t he does 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.170
 two or three centimeters 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:35.930
 but this fish must be known that it will 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:38.120
 do 15 20 or even 30 cm for a weight 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.580
 his way to adult size when he has a 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.800
 normal development in a ball there 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.840
 is not going to develop normally he 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.030
 will stay very small because he lives 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.350
 in a very little mom empire so what 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.850
 is not a good thing at all 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.220
 since in fact all its organs 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:54.260
 internal when to be upset by 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.850
 this magnificent to sion and so you 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.680
 go see fish troubles by 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:00.319
 example that remain to surpass who 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.000
 fleet on the belly that's why the 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:03.590
 fish game laupheim it for a vocal 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.019
 but there are many other reasons and 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:09.819
 especially the technique that you can 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:09.819
 not installed in the jar 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.150
 then the technical equipment that 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.770
 we will be able to put in an aquarium 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.740
 and we can not install in a 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:21.170
 jar will simply serve to 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:23.360
 filter too little nowhere and gave 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.920
 everything you need at your aquarium on 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.050
 more importantly it's going to be actually 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:30.110
 the filter that can be called a pump 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:33.020
 chedid and time the filter to serve to 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:35.810
 purify the water and thus prevent the water from 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:37.700
 become all the loss of feeling bad and 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.920
 especially to your fish to have a water 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:43.220
 which is not filled to compose a 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:45.020
 monial hold because of his excrement and 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.210
 this very important filter in the mansion 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:48.740
 of phyllis and the most important humor 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:50.630
 is in a jar you can not 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:52.730
 have this element is so it's 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:55.190
 crippling a jar born is not worth a 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.750
 aquarium you really have to take 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.880
 consciousness 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.830
 secondly you go lighting in 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.060
 the lighting aquarium I always think 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:03.170
 to voice commands it's not 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.240
 necessary 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:07.580
 at best we will place the jar in front of the 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:10.340
 big error window when you place 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:12.470
 your beautiful calmels an aquarium of your 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:15.530
 window it will promote development 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:17.840
 agglos will be even greener then 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:19.940
 why but a lighting in the 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.980
 career of the gones does not turn into 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.169
 greenery automatically because it's 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:25.100
 lighting that is specific and which 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:27.169
 is planned for 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:29.150
 more lighting you will be able 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:31.940
 set it to be twelve hours a day 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.860
 for a fish be it red or 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:35.960
 any other way 12h it's a queen 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:38.090
 hedges 12 hours a day you 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.800
 bored 12h days but that's very 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:42.440
 important because he needs a 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:44.360
 cycle day night to be able to rest 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.100
 as a goldfish that sleeps 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.900
 effectively setting even if it did not 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:49.730
 eyelids that you do not laugh off 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:53.680
 the eyes what is normal he'll get 

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:53.680
 lay deep inside herself to sleep 

00:04:54.569 --> 00:04:58.439
 to be clear enough I will come back 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:00.330
 with you on things we hear 

00:04:58.439 --> 00:05:02.699
 quite regularly for example this 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:05.509
 sentence my fish with two or three 

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:09.719
 years and he survived like that very well 

00:05:05.509 --> 00:05:12.419
 ok but a dirty goldfish 15 20 

00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:14.819
 even 25 years to do the math 

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:16.770
 he survived two or three years and he is 

00:05:14.819 --> 00:05:19.439
 dead very young montois are people 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:21.119
 locally Chilean ok he eats very well 

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:22.740
 but if you lock up any 

00:05:21.119 --> 00:05:24.959
 abyss imported spirits among others to 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:26.520
 tic for him he will spend his walls at the 

00:05:24.959 --> 00:05:27.419
 end so far he will try to eat 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.729
 and survive 

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:31.169
 double good appetite of a fish has 

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:32.270
 absolutely nothing to do with the fact 

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:36.240
 whether he is right or wrong 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:37.499
 another sentence sheets so out of 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.930
 things one can hear you 

00:05:37.499 --> 00:05:42.029
 pet shop 6th rank of the beautiful race and 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:42.689
 so it's not a bad thing they 

00:05:42.029 --> 00:05:45.419
 know what they are doing 

00:05:42.689 --> 00:05:47.209
 then not at all but like a lot of 

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:50.009
 things but wants to sell you that is 

00:05:47.209 --> 00:05:50.999
 humans and animals and a lot 

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:53.159
 things that are not at all 

00:05:50.999 --> 00:05:55.409
 adapted and that's daddy will be the front 

00:05:53.159 --> 00:05:58.229
 store that it's good things 

00:05:55.409 --> 00:06:01.110
 so yes necessarily take argument the 

00:05:58.229 --> 00:06:02.580
 sellers in summary a local has nothing to 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:04.349
 see with an agreement it does not take 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:07.619
 absolutely not call it flour 

00:06:04.349 --> 00:06:08.729
 broker invokes the aquarium a vocal has 

00:06:07.619 --> 00:06:11.069
 really done for something else 

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:13.169
 personally I use them for his 

00:06:11.069 --> 00:06:14.669
 sleeve he has to make him take his 

00:06:13.169 --> 00:06:16.050
 Sand bath is the only one 

00:06:14.669 --> 00:06:19.079
 the use that I could find at 

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:21.599
 this ball do not use a jar for 

00:06:19.079 --> 00:06:23.879
 a fish a nice case there it is certainly 

00:06:21.599 --> 00:06:26.189
 cheap but you're going to have fun 

00:06:23.879 --> 00:06:28.439
 trouble with this big call and you go 

00:06:26.189 --> 00:06:31.469
 soon you a debate was taking right away 

00:06:28.439 --> 00:06:33.569
 a small aquarium of 58 54 

00:06:31.469 --> 00:06:35.969
 like this it does not cost very much 

00:06:33.569 --> 00:06:37.709
 whether new or used 

00:06:35.969 --> 00:06:40.019
 he will find a little bit everywhere 

00:06:37.709 --> 00:06:43.169
 you have all the general equipment that 

00:06:40.019 --> 00:06:45.119
 with a filter the lighting maybe 

00:06:43.169 --> 00:06:46.199
 even the gravels that after the decoration 

00:06:45.119 --> 00:06:48.449
 This is another thing 

00:06:46.199 --> 00:06:50.729
 in any case if you leave immediately 

00:06:48.449 --> 00:06:53.339
 with a laptop you immediately have 

00:06:50.729 --> 00:06:55.030
 plunged into the unknown pinet and you 

00:06:53.339 --> 00:06:56.950
 will be able to have your prose 

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:58.750
 much longer benefits and 

00:06:56.950 --> 00:07:01.090
 much better in a water that want 

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:04.420
 take with germain supports a lot 

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:06.400
 smaller and you will enjoy I 

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:08.500
 still remember your fish and the 

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:10.180
 measure is a good little corner of worship 

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:11.590
 I hope this short video you 

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:12.940
 will help to understand why the 

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:15.250
 goldfish is not made to live 

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:16.780
 in a local is why it is necessary 

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:19.570
 absolutely make it live in a 

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:21.940
 aquarium equipped with at least one filter 

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:24.670
 you can ask questions in the
