problem in vinyl

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.110 
problem in vinyl
it's<00:00:08.760> called<00:00:09.030> tunneling<00:00:09.510> and<00:00:10.670> if<00:00:11.670> you<00:00:11.820> can<00:00:11.940> see

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
it's called tunneling and if you can see

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.640 
it's called tunneling and if you can see
this<00:00:12.300> it's<00:00:12.599> when<00:00:12.780> you<00:00:12.870> get<00:00:13.019> a<00:00:13.049> wrinkle

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
this it's when you get a wrinkle

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.430 
this it's when you get a wrinkle
all<00:00:14.340> the<00:00:14.639> way<00:00:14.759> across<00:00:14.880> your<00:00:15.269> vinyl<00:00:15.719> just<00:00:15.900> like

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
all the way across your vinyl just like

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.019 
all the way across your vinyl just like
that<00:00:16.650> and<00:00:17.840> what's<00:00:18.840> that<00:00:18.900> that's<00:00:19.260> from<00:00:19.770> is<00:00:20.029> the

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
that and what's that that's from is the

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.080 
that and what's that that's from is the
backing<00:00:21.300> it<00:00:21.779> uh<00:00:22.789> expanding<00:00:23.789> and<00:00:23.939> contracting

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
backing it uh expanding and contracting

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.300 
backing it uh expanding and contracting
and<00:00:24.830> the<00:00:25.830> vinyl<00:00:26.250> part<00:00:26.869> doing<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:27.990> opposite<00:00:28.500> or

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
and the vinyl part doing the opposite or

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.350 
and the vinyl part doing the opposite or
if<00:00:29.490> you<00:00:29.609> get<00:00:29.760> a<00:00:29.820> a<00:00:30.439> crease<00:00:31.439> in<00:00:31.470> your<00:00:31.710> and<00:00:32.640> you're

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
if you get a a crease in your and you're

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.470 
if you get a a crease in your and you're
backing<00:00:34.140> it'll<00:00:34.410> also<00:00:35.450> create<00:00:36.450> a<00:00:37.340> tunnel<00:00:38.480> but

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
backing it'll also create a tunnel but

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.790 
backing it'll also create a tunnel but
it's<00:00:39.989> real<00:00:40.260> easy<00:00:40.460> prom<00:00:41.460> to<00:00:41.850> solve<00:00:42.559> all<00:00:43.559> you

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
it's real easy prom to solve all you

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.350 
it's real easy prom to solve all you
gotta<00:00:43.980> do<00:00:44.129> is<00:00:44.250> take<00:00:44.460> your<00:00:44.579> vinyl<00:00:44.820> laid<00:00:45.120> on<00:00:45.300> a

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
flat surface take one end and you can

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:59.000 
flat surface take one end and you can
use<00:00:53.340> either<00:00:53.730> your<00:00:56.690> squeegees<00:00:57.690> a<00:00:57.770> credit<00:00:58.770> card

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
use either your squeegees a credit card

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.049 
use either your squeegees a credit card
some<00:00:59.489> flat<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.149> smooth<00:01:01.520> usually<00:01:02.520> trying<00:01:02.850> use

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
some flat and smooth usually trying use

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.789 
some flat and smooth usually trying use
some<00:01:03.329> soft<00:01:04.189> but<00:01:05.189> uh<00:01:05.330> anything<00:01:06.350> like<00:01:07.350> this<00:01:07.619> will

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
some soft but uh anything like this will

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.179 
some soft but uh anything like this will
work<00:01:08.869> this<00:01:09.869> is<00:01:10.020> what<00:01:10.140> I<00:01:10.200> have<00:01:10.500> to<00:01:10.650> do<00:01:10.830> or<00:01:10.950> mine

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
work this is what I have to do or mine

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.179 
work this is what I have to do or mine
it's<00:01:12.090> a<00:01:12.360> window<00:01:12.900> squeegee<00:01:13.229> twelve<00:01:13.710> inch<00:01:13.920> so<00:01:14.100> it

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
it's a window squeegee twelve inch so it

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.760 
it's a window squeegee twelve inch so it
fits<00:01:14.430> right<00:01:14.610> across<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:15.470> usually<00:01:16.470> you<00:01:16.590> can

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
fits right across and usually you can

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.760 
fits right across and usually you can
just<00:01:16.979> pull<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.369> wrinkles<00:01:18.030> right<00:01:18.210> out<00:01:18.650> put<00:01:19.650> it

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
just pull the wrinkles right out put it

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.240 
just pull the wrinkles right out put it
I'm<00:01:20.189> sure<00:01:20.430> most<00:01:20.640> of<00:01:20.759> these<00:01:20.850> don't<00:01:21.119> have<00:01:21.330> these

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250 
I'm sure most of these don't have these

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.510 
I'm sure most of these don't have these
but<00:01:23.420> I'll<00:01:24.420> show<00:01:24.570> you<00:01:24.630> how<00:01:24.750> to<00:01:24.979> fix<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.159> problem

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
like this go right down the middle I'll

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.010 
like this go right down the middle I'll
lay<00:02:01.770> it<00:02:01.920> back<00:02:02.070> down<00:02:02.130> you<00:02:02.760> could<00:02:03.540> also<00:02:03.690> use<00:02:03.990> a

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
lay it back down you could also use a

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.100 
lay it back down you could also use a
rolling<00:02:04.380> pin<00:02:04.590> any<00:02:05.220> of<00:02:05.760> that<00:02:05.940> then<00:02:06.780> you<00:02:06.960> work

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
rolling pin any of that then you work

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.850 
rolling pin any of that then you work
from<00:02:07.290> the<00:02:07.440> middle<00:02:07.500> and<00:02:08.330> you<00:02:09.330> pull<00:02:09.600> out<00:02:09.840> any<00:02:10.649> air

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
from the middle and you pull out any air

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.070 
from the middle and you pull out any air
bubbles<00:02:11.310> or<00:02:11.490> anything<00:02:12.390> like<00:02:12.690> that<00:02:12.720> you<00:02:13.050> just

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
bubbles or anything like that you just
