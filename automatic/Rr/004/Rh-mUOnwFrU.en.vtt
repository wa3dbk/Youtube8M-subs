00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 hello friends today I bring you news of 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.470
 what will be the next three new 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.900
 acronym for dragon city soon 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.480
 will begin to implement three new 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.059
 islands that will give relief to many 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.970
 dragon city players that no longer 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.779
 they have space to place the new 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:24.029
 dragons that are appearing in the game 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:28.340
 besides implementing these three 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:31.040
 new islands would also be increased 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:33.290
 a number of habitats available in the 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:37.130
 game so that they can build 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:39.290
 more habitats and fill them with dragons by 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:42.470
 what not only comes in three new 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:45.620
 islands but a limit update 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:49.400
 of dragon city habitat these three 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:52.190
 new islands like the previous ones can 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:55.940
 that are achieved by buying them with gems 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:58.850
 but still not much is known about the 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:01.120
 price of each island so far this 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:06.619
 new appointment would become the seventh 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:08.540
 Eighth and ninth island of Dragon City the 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:12.500
 first of these that would come to be the 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:15.979
 seventh island could be called island of 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:20.869
 ice and as you can see it has a design 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:23.750
 of ice type and good here could 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:27.150
 build habitats of preference of the 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:31.530
 dragons that are the element and 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:34.380
 the second new island that would happen to be 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:37.920
 the eighth island of dragon city could be 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:42.420
 call rainbow island and how can you see 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:45.060
 it looks like the first island 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.130
 what is this vegetable but with the 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.340
 difference that is decorated with a 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:54.600
 beautiful rainbow here could also 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:57.690
 place other dragons that you 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.540
 they wanted and the third and last new 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:04.470
 island that would become the ninth island of 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:07.860
 dragon city that has a more finished 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:12.270
 old would happen to be called the island 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:15.840
 old or gothic island and here they could 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:17.970
 place your classic dragons as the 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:22.110
 dragon white knight or the dragon 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:24.330
 black knight as I told you how 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.450
 can see the islands were already designed 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.610
 and the only thing that remains now is that the 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:33.140
 implement in the game so you no longer 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:35.519
 there's almost nothing left so you can see 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:38.459
 these changes in a next 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:40.350
 dragon city update so 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:43.290
 I recommend you go together 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:46.080
 gems so that when they are released from 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.750
 they can acquire them officially 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.880
 quickly and so fill it with the 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.190
 dragons that are locked in the 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:56.040
 dragon Aryan or that for reasons of space 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:59.610
 they have been selling these new islands 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:04.050
 they would be located next to 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:05.850
 the island of the fourth island and the Celtic 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:09.750
 dragon city island 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:12.900
 around here would be the three 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:15.390
 new islands of the dragon city one at 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:19.320
 side of each island one next to the 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:22.440
 first island another next to the fourth 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:25.240
 island and one next to the sixth island that 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.940
 would be here approximately 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:30.910
 good friends, I hope you liked it 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:33.190
 the video if I have more news about the 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:36.220
 next if the dragon city I'll leave 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:39.940
 know but my recommendation as always 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:42.220
 is that they are gathering resources so that 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.920
 when they are released officially 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:47.590
 can get them without major 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:50.320
 complication if you want to know more about 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.690
