00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
tape and we usually go about 10 to 12

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.710

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
that your fabric is iron because if you

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.189 
that your fabric is iron because if you
already<00:00:28.410> have<00:00:28.680> it<00:00:28.830> ironed<00:00:29.150> then<00:00:30.150> there<00:00:30.840> aren't

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
already have it ironed then there aren't

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.720 
already have it ironed then there aren't
any<00:00:31.349> wrinkles<00:00:31.890> that<00:00:32.160> you<00:00:32.279> have<00:00:32.430> to<00:00:32.550> worry

any wrinkles that you have to worry
about<00:00:32.850> getting<00:00:33.149> out<00:00:33.450> so<00:00:33.750> just<00:00:33.960> take<00:00:34.770> your

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
about getting out so just take your

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.130 
about getting out so just take your
first<00:00:35.100> strip<00:00:35.520> of<00:00:35.700> duct<00:00:35.969> tape<00:00:36.059> and<00:00:36.450> lay<00:00:36.750> it<00:00:36.899> down

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
first strip of duct tape and lay it down

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.560 
first strip of duct tape and lay it down
on<00:00:37.469> top<00:00:37.829> of<00:00:38.040> your<00:00:38.430> fabric<00:00:38.610> and<00:00:39.030> just<00:00:39.210> kind<00:00:39.510> of

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
on top of your fabric and just kind of

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.630 
on top of your fabric and just kind of
smooth<00:00:39.899> it<00:00:40.020> out<00:00:40.110> and<00:00:40.800> we<00:00:40.950> really<00:00:41.489> recommend

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
smooth it out and we really recommend

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.119 
smooth it out and we really recommend
that<00:00:42.090> you<00:00:42.239> use<00:00:42.270> original<00:00:43.200> strength<00:00:43.469> duct<00:00:43.890> tape

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
that you use original strength duct tape

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.729 
that you use original strength duct tape
it<00:00:44.520> works<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:44.940> best<00:00:45.149> it<00:00:45.539> does<00:00:45.809> really<00:00:46.500> done

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
it works the best it does really done

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.250 
it works the best it does really done
and<00:00:47.070> so<00:00:47.579> when<00:00:47.760> you're<00:00:47.879> laying<00:00:48.149> down<00:00:48.329> your

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
and so when you're laying down your

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:55.279 
and so when you're laying down your
second<00:00:49.890> strip<00:00:53.000> you<00:00:54.000> want<00:00:54.210> to<00:00:54.449> make<00:00:54.629> sure<00:00:54.690> to

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
second strip you want to make sure to

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.889 
second strip you want to make sure to
just<00:00:55.530> line<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:56.280> strips<00:00:56.670> right<00:00:56.910> next<00:00:57.750> to<00:00:57.809> each

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
just line the strips right next to each

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.200 
just line the strips right next to each
other<00:00:58.109> you<00:00:58.770> don't<00:00:58.980> want<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.309> overlap<00:00:59.850> them

next<00:01:09.060> thing<00:01:09.240> is<00:01:09.510> to<00:01:09.570> make<00:01:09.780> a<00:01:09.840> template<00:01:10.350> we<00:01:10.740> just

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
next thing is to make a template we just

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.219 
next thing is to make a template we just
took<00:01:10.979> an<00:01:11.130> old<00:01:11.340> cardboard<00:01:11.820> box<00:01:12.240> drew<00:01:13.200> a

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
took an old cardboard box drew a

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.170 
took an old cardboard box drew a
triangle<00:01:13.920> this<00:01:14.250> is<00:01:14.400> about<00:01:14.610> six<00:01:14.939> and<00:01:15.060> a<00:01:15.150> half

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
triangle this is about six and a half

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.390 
triangle this is about six and a half
inches<00:01:15.390> by<00:01:15.780> 8<00:01:15.990> inches<00:01:16.200> then<00:01:17.130> you're<00:01:17.250> going<00:01:17.340> to

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
inches by 8 inches then you're going to

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.870 
inches by 8 inches then you're going to
trace<00:01:17.729> it<00:01:18.799> use<00:01:19.799> a<00:01:19.830> sharpie<00:01:20.310> marker<00:01:20.610> doesn't

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
trace it use a sharpie marker doesn't

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.490 
trace it use a sharpie marker doesn't
matter<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.119> color<00:01:21.270> because<00:01:21.930> it's<00:01:22.229> just<00:01:22.290> on

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
matter the color because it's just on

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.230 
matter the color because it's just on
the<00:01:22.590> background<00:01:23.009> yeah<00:01:23.610> you're<00:01:23.909> just<00:01:24.060> going<00:01:24.180> to

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
the background yeah you're just going to

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.609 
the background yeah you're just going to
cut<00:01:24.450> right<00:01:24.479> on<00:01:24.900> top<00:01:25.200> of<00:01:25.229> it<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:27.320> we<00:01:28.320> like<00:01:28.470> to

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
cut right on top of it and we like to

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.859 
cut right on top of it and we like to
use<00:01:28.770> a<00:01:28.799> symmetrical<00:01:29.460> design<00:01:29.640> so<00:01:30.420> that<00:01:30.450> we<00:01:30.689> can

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
use a symmetrical design so that we can

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.730 
use a symmetrical design so that we can
get<00:01:30.990> more

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
get more

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.800 
get more
pennants<00:01:33.729> out<00:01:33.880> of<00:01:34.030> you<00:01:34.150> know<00:01:34.270> it<00:01:34.479> just<00:01:34.509> a

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
pennants out of you know it just a

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:40.260 
pennants out of you know it just a
single<00:01:34.990> piece<00:01:35.320> of<00:01:35.470> fabric<00:01:38.670> all<00:01:39.670> right<00:01:40.000> so<00:01:40.149> this

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
single piece of fabric all right so this

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:41.550 
single piece of fabric all right so this
is<00:01:40.450> how<00:01:40.570> it<00:01:40.720> should<00:01:40.869> look<00:01:40.930> once<00:01:41.290> you've<00:01:41.439> got

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
is how it should look once you've got

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.320 
is how it should look once you've got
your<00:01:41.590> shapes<00:01:42.040> traced<00:01:42.369> on<00:01:42.549> and<00:01:42.850> then<00:01:42.939> just<00:01:42.970> cut

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:43.330 
your shapes traced on and then just cut

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.230 
your shapes traced on and then just cut
it<00:01:43.420> up<00:01:43.540> and<00:01:44.040> one<00:01:45.040> of<00:01:45.189> the<00:01:45.280> great<00:01:45.580> things<00:01:45.610> about

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
it up and one of the great things about

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.499 
it up and one of the great things about
using<00:01:47.110> duct<00:01:47.409> tape<00:01:47.530> and<00:01:47.920> fabric<00:01:48.490> is<00:01:48.729> that<00:01:49.330> when

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:49.509 
using duct tape and fabric is that when

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:52.440 
using duct tape and fabric is that when
you<00:01:49.659> begin<00:01:49.960> to<00:01:50.020> cut<00:01:50.380> it<00:01:50.590> it<00:01:51.159> turns<00:01:51.610> a<00:01:51.850> regular

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
you begin to cut it it turns a regular

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.960 
you begin to cut it it turns a regular
piece<00:01:52.659> of<00:01:52.840> fabric<00:01:53.049> into<00:01:53.649> a<00:01:53.679> heavy-duty<00:01:54.189> piece

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970 
piece of fabric into a heavy-duty piece

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.450 
piece of fabric into a heavy-duty piece
of<00:01:55.149> fabric<00:01:55.299> where<00:01:56.110> there<00:01:56.380> is<00:01:56.409> no<00:01:56.649> frame<00:01:57.039> and

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 
of fabric where there is no frame and

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:02.279 
of fabric where there is no frame and
it's<00:01:58.210> just<00:01:58.990> really<00:01:59.229> a<00:01:59.619> cool<00:02:00.960> perk<00:02:01.960> that<00:02:02.170> you

00:02:02.279 --> 00:02:02.289 
it's just really a cool perk that you

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:04.289 
it's just really a cool perk that you
get<00:02:02.530> from<00:02:02.799> using<00:02:03.189> duct<00:02:03.610> tape<00:02:03.670> and<00:02:03.939> fabric

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:04.299 
get from using duct tape and fabric

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:11.340 
get from using duct tape and fabric
together<00:02:08.160> it's<00:02:09.160> always<00:02:09.670> fun<00:02:09.970> to<00:02:10.000> add<00:02:10.330> vinyl<00:02:11.019> to

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
together it's always fun to add vinyl to

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.039 
together it's always fun to add vinyl to
a<00:02:11.380> project<00:02:11.799> and<00:02:12.370> so<00:02:12.670> we<00:02:13.180> are<00:02:13.360> going<00:02:13.690> to<00:02:13.900> add

00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:14.049 
a project and so we are going to add

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:16.890 
a project and so we are going to add
some<00:02:14.080> letters<00:02:14.890> to<00:02:15.160> this<00:02:15.310> cube<00:02:15.640> banner<00:02:15.880> so<00:02:16.810> you

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
some letters to this cube banner so you

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.960 
some letters to this cube banner so you
just<00:02:17.200> take<00:02:17.500> your<00:02:17.709> vinyl<00:02:18.100> lettering<00:02:18.610> and

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970

just take your vinyl lettering and
sometimes<00:02:19.810> the<00:02:20.049> adhesive<00:02:20.620> on<00:02:20.739> the<00:02:20.769> back<00:02:20.890> of

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
sometimes the adhesive on the back of

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:24.270 
sometimes the adhesive on the back of
vinyl<00:02:21.900> doesn't<00:02:22.900> stick<00:02:23.200> quite<00:02:23.799> as<00:02:23.950> well<00:02:24.100> as

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
vinyl doesn't stick quite as well as

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.430 
vinyl doesn't stick quite as well as
you'd<00:02:24.430> like<00:02:24.459> it<00:02:24.790> to<00:02:24.819> to<00:02:25.209> a<00:02:25.239> piece<00:02:25.480> of<00:02:25.510> fabric<00:02:25.840> so

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
you'd like it to to a piece of fabric so

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.259 
you'd like it to to a piece of fabric so
we<00:02:26.709> have<00:02:26.920> a<00:02:26.950> little<00:02:27.190> trick<00:02:27.519> that<00:02:27.549> we<00:02:27.910> like<00:02:28.120> to

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:28.269 
we have a little trick that we like to

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:29.910 
we have a little trick that we like to
use<00:02:28.480> and<00:02:28.810> so<00:02:28.959> we<00:02:29.140> just<00:02:29.319> peel<00:02:29.530> off<00:02:29.560> the<00:02:29.739> backing

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
use and so we just peel off the backing

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.780 
use and so we just peel off the backing
paper<00:02:30.930> and<00:02:31.930> we<00:02:32.500> just<00:02:32.709> take<00:02:33.010> a<00:02:33.040> little<00:02:33.430> bit<00:02:33.730> of

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
paper and we just take a little bit of

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.479 
paper and we just take a little bit of
modge<00:02:34.090> podge<00:02:34.890> and<00:02:35.890> we<00:02:36.160> just<00:02:36.370> kind<00:02:36.519> of<00:02:36.700> lightly

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
modge podge and we just kind of lightly

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:43.920 
modge podge and we just kind of lightly
brush<00:02:39.489> the<00:02:39.519> back<00:02:39.940> of<00:02:40.239> the<00:02:40.390> letter<00:02:41.130> and<00:02:42.930> then

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
brush the back of the letter and then

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.340 
brush the back of the letter and then
just<00:02:44.440> stick<00:02:44.709> it<00:02:44.920> right<00:02:44.950> where<00:02:45.519> it<00:02:45.549> goes<00:02:46.350> and

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
just stick it right where it goes and

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:48.960 
just stick it right where it goes and
the<00:02:47.440> great<00:02:47.709> thing<00:02:47.739> about<00:02:48.010> Mod<00:02:48.340> Podge<00:02:48.370> is<00:02:48.850> it

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
the great thing about Mod Podge is it

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.900 
the great thing about Mod Podge is it
dries<00:02:49.239> clear<00:02:49.600> so<00:02:49.660> don't<00:02:50.200> worry<00:02:50.350> about<00:02:50.470> it

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
dries clear so don't worry about it

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.940 
dries clear so don't worry about it
making<00:02:51.910> any<00:02:52.060> difference<00:02:52.239> on<00:02:52.600> your<00:02:52.630> fabric

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.650 
making any difference on your fabric
exactly<00:02:53.950> that<00:02:54.190> is<00:02:54.370> the<00:02:54.850> best<00:02:55.030> part<00:02:55.239> about

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
exactly that is the best part about

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.770 
exactly that is the best part about
using<00:02:56.260> Mod<00:02:56.440> Podge<00:02:56.470> on<00:02:57.010> fabric<00:02:57.430> so<00:02:58.000> I<00:02:58.030> just<00:02:58.390> I

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
using Mod Podge on fabric so I just I

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.640 
using Mod Podge on fabric so I just I
just<00:02:59.200> pressed<00:02:59.799> down<00:03:00.220> the<00:03:00.760> letters<00:03:01.720> onto<00:03:02.260> the

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
just pressed down the letters onto the

immediately<00:03:15.420> to<00:03:16.420> the<00:03:16.450> fabric<00:03:16.930> so<00:03:17.349> I'm<00:03:17.530> just

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
immediately to the fabric so I'm just

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:19.830

peel off the fabric and with all these
fun<00:03:23.019> different<00:03:23.409> patterns<00:03:23.769> on<00:03:23.980> the<00:03:24.099> fabric

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:24.389 
fun different patterns on the fabric

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:26.369 
fun different patterns on the fabric
you're<00:03:25.389> going<00:03:25.510> to<00:03:25.569> want<00:03:25.719> to<00:03:25.840> pick<00:03:26.019> a<00:03:26.049> font

00:03:26.369 --> 00:03:26.379 
you're going to want to pick a font

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:28.800 
you're going to want to pick a font
that's<00:03:26.829> really<00:03:27.129> thick<00:03:27.489> and<00:03:27.819> chunky<00:03:28.299> and<00:03:28.629> these

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:33.750 
letters are about two and a half inches
tall<00:03:31.480> so<00:03:32.260> that<00:03:32.409> the<00:03:32.530> contrast<00:03:33.040> is<00:03:33.280> really<00:03:33.579> high

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760

you just punch the corners and I just I
just<00:03:47.260> I<00:03:47.620> it<00:03:47.680> can<00:03:48.489> also<00:03:48.639> use<00:03:48.909> a<00:03:48.939> regular<00:03:49.150> hole

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
just I it can also use a regular hole

00:03:55.649 --> 00:03:55.659 
holes are punched you don't want to

00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:57.390 
holes are punched you don't want to
strain<00:03:55.959> your<00:03:56.109> ribbon<00:03:56.500> through<00:03:56.769> your<00:03:57.189> banner

and<00:03:57.730> you<00:03:58.150> can<00:03:58.269> just<00:03:58.389> wrap<00:03:58.599> a<00:03:58.659> piece<00:03:59.019> of<00:03:59.079> duct

00:03:59.339 --> 00:03:59.349 
and you can just wrap a piece of duct

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:01.110 
and you can just wrap a piece of duct
tape<00:03:59.379> on<00:03:59.799> the<00:03:59.889> end<00:04:00.069> and<00:04:00.400> that<00:04:00.579> makes<00:04:00.790> it<00:04:00.909> really

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
tape on the end and that makes it really

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.539 
tape on the end and that makes it really
easy<00:04:01.269> to<00:04:01.629> thread<00:04:01.870> through<00:04:02.200> and<00:04:03.010> we<00:04:03.219> just<00:04:03.430> like

easy to thread through and we just like
to<00:04:03.700> secure<00:04:04.090> it<00:04:04.180> with<00:04:04.209> a<00:04:04.359> piece<00:04:04.599> of<00:04:04.659> duct<00:04:04.989> tape

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:05.079 
to secure it with a piece of duct tape

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:07.289 
to secure it with a piece of duct tape
on<00:04:05.439> the<00:04:05.590> back<00:04:05.739> just<00:04:06.040> to<00:04:06.189> keep<00:04:06.340> it<00:04:06.489> in<00:04:06.609> place<00:04:06.849> and

on the back just to keep it in place and
you<00:04:08.109> don't<00:04:08.290> want<00:04:08.440> to<00:04:08.530> use<00:04:08.680> hot<00:04:08.949> glue<00:04:08.979> or

you don't want to use hot glue or
anything<00:04:09.489> with<00:04:09.940> heat<00:04:10.150> because<00:04:10.690> the<00:04:10.989> duct<00:04:11.169> tape

00:04:11.369 --> 00:04:11.379 
anything with heat because the duct tape

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:13.080 
anything with heat because the duct tape
will<00:04:11.590> react<00:04:11.889> to<00:04:12.040> the<00:04:12.159> heat<00:04:12.340> and<00:04:12.489> kind<00:04:12.699> of<00:04:12.790> curl

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
will react to the heat and kind of curl
