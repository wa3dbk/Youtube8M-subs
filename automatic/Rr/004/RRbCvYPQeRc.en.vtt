an 859 down imaging on the front to do

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:28.700 
an 859 down imaging on the front to do
that<00:00:21.450> we've<00:00:21.990> needed<00:00:22.790> the<00:00:23.790> a<00:00:23.820> sec<00:00:24.720> q<00:00:25.730> de<00:00:27.590> two<00:00:28.590> of

that we've needed the a sec q de two of

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:35.389 
that we've needed the a sec q de two of
those<00:00:30.140> one<00:00:31.160> transducer<00:00:32.160> cable<00:00:33.469> and<00:00:34.469> one

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
those one transducer cable and one

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.290 
those one transducer cable and one
Ethernet<00:00:36.000> cable

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300 
Ethernet cable

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:44.060 
Ethernet cable
another<00:00:40.129> Ethernet<00:00:41.129> toggle<00:00:41.850> switch<00:00:42.120> and<00:00:43.070> we've

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
another Ethernet toggle switch and we've

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.840 
another Ethernet toggle switch and we've
also<00:00:44.280> done<00:00:44.699> the<00:00:45.149> speed<00:00:46.019> transducer<00:00:46.850> because

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
also done the speed transducer because

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.259 
also done the speed transducer because
we<00:00:48.420> are<00:00:48.690> doing<00:00:49.429> we're<00:00:50.429> going<00:00:50.550> to<00:00:50.640> run<00:00:50.789> two

00:00:51.259 --> 00:00:51.269 
we are doing we're going to run two

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:54.349 
we are doing we're going to run two
different<00:00:51.440> transducers<00:00:52.850> to<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:53.969> back<00:00:54.149> of<00:00:54.300> the

00:00:54.349 --> 00:00:54.359 
different transducers to the back of the

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:58.610 
different transducers to the back of the
boat<00:00:54.530> so<00:00:55.530> let's<00:00:56.129> get<00:00:56.249> started<00:00:57.379> first<00:00:58.379> thing

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
boat so let's get started first thing

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.270 
boat so let's get started first thing
we've<00:00:58.800> done<00:00:58.980> is<00:00:59.249> loosen<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.760> screws<00:01:01.039> to<00:01:02.039> take

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
we've done is loosen the screws to take

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.780 
we've done is loosen the screws to take
out<00:01:02.519> the<00:01:02.760> side<00:01:02.999> piece<00:01:03.920> to<00:01:04.920> run<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.220> transducer

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
out the side piece to run the transducer

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.810 
out the side piece to run the transducer
cable<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.750> back<00:01:06.900> of<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.140> boot<00:01:07.490> this<00:01:08.490> is

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
cable to the back of the boot this is

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.600 
cable to the back of the boot this is
four<00:01:09.150> screws<00:01:09.510> here<00:01:10.130> and<00:01:12.950> four<00:01:13.950> screws<00:01:14.280> there

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
four screws here and four screws there

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.940 
four screws here and four screws there
to<00:01:15.360> run<00:01:15.510> the<00:01:15.600> hook<00:01:15.780> run<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.200> cable<00:01:16.530> up<00:01:16.680> in

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
to run the hook run the cable up in

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.630 
to run the hook run the cable up in
there<00:01:18.770> we're<00:01:19.770> getting<00:01:20.010> ready<00:01:20.130> to<00:01:20.310> install<00:01:20.490> the

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
there we're getting ready to install the

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.070 
there we're getting ready to install the
Y<00:01:20.940> cable<00:01:21.450> which<00:01:22.320> we'll<00:01:22.650> send<00:01:22.920> to<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:24.080> speed

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
Y cable which we'll send to the speed

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.130 
Y cable which we'll send to the speed
transducer<00:01:25.800> and<00:01:26.180> the<00:01:27.180> sight<00:01:27.420> imaging<00:01:27.960> and

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
transducer and the sight imaging and

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.460 
transducer and the sight imaging and
here's<00:01:28.740> your<00:01:28.890> Y<00:01:29.010> cable<00:01:29.460> as<00:01:29.760> you<00:01:30.750> can<00:01:31.050> see<00:01:31.230> here

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
here's your Y cable as you can see here

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.890 
here's your Y cable as you can see here
pretty<00:01:32.460> much<00:01:32.580> it<00:01:32.790> just<00:01:32.820> splits<00:01:33.300> the

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
pretty much it just splits the

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.750 
pretty much it just splits the
transducer<00:01:34.470> to<00:01:34.620> if<00:01:35.460> you<00:01:35.550> look<00:01:35.790> it<00:01:36.030> has<00:01:37.760> dual

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:38.760 
transducer to if you look it has dual

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:44.810 
transducer to if you look it has dual
beam<00:01:41.390> it<00:01:42.390> says<00:01:42.570> dual<00:01:42.840> beam<00:01:43.050> here<00:01:43.820> inside

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
beam it says dual beam here inside

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.970 
beam it says dual beam here inside
imaging<00:01:45.330> here<00:01:45.690> so<00:01:46.320> that<00:01:46.470> way<00:01:46.590> you<00:01:46.650> don't<00:01:46.710> get

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:46.980 
imaging here so that way you don't get

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:49.460 
imaging here so that way you don't get
them<00:01:47.070> mixed<00:01:47.100> up<00:01:47.570> then<00:01:48.570> you<00:01:48.750> just<00:01:48.960> take<00:01:49.140> your

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
them mixed up then you just take your

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.140 
them mixed up then you just take your
transducer<00:01:50.310> cable<00:01:51.020> right<00:01:52.020> here<00:01:52.110> and<00:01:53.150> hook

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:54.150 
transducer cable right here and hook

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.850 
transducer cable right here and hook
them<00:01:54.330> into<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.540> right<00:01:54.780> one<00:01:55.550> alright<00:01:57.860> to

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
them into the right one alright to

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.600 
them into the right one alright to
network<00:01:59.310> 899<00:02:00.240> 59<00:02:00.990> will<00:02:01.800> hook<00:02:01.980> the<00:02:02.160> ethernet

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
network 899 59 will hook the ethernet

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.750 
network 899 59 will hook the ethernet
cable<00:02:02.820> up<00:02:03.150> this<00:02:03.330> way<00:02:03.570> plugs<00:02:04.230> in<00:02:04.440> here<00:02:04.550> this<00:02:05.550> one

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:05.760 
cable up this way plugs in here this one

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.820 
cable up this way plugs in here this one
runs<00:02:05.940> into<00:02:06.120> this<00:02:06.570> unit<00:02:06.990> here<00:02:07.320> and<00:02:07.849> then<00:02:09.830> ran

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
runs into this unit here and then ran

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.820 
runs into this unit here and then ran
the<00:02:10.979> cable<00:02:11.370> up<00:02:11.640> through<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:12.090> rod<00:02:12.930> box<00:02:13.230> up

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
the cable up through the rod box up

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.010 
the cable up through the rod box up
there<00:02:14.069> here<00:02:14.489> and<00:02:15.620> into<00:02:16.620> the<00:02:16.650> back<00:02:16.859> here

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
there here and into the back here

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.110 
there here and into the back here
that's<00:02:19.020> all<00:02:19.170> it<00:02:19.410> was<00:02:19.440> to<00:02:19.800> network<00:02:20.160> hey<00:02:20.880> we've

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
that's all it was to network hey we've

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:27.290 
that's all it was to network hey we've
got<00:02:21.150> both<00:02:21.600> trees<00:02:21.930> install<00:02:23.720> the<00:02:25.730> side<00:02:26.730> imaging

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
got both trees install the side imaging

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:33.080 
got both trees install the side imaging
this<00:02:28.050> speed<00:02:28.380> transducer<00:02:29.160> can<00:02:29.460> run<00:02:29.730> up<00:02:32.090> up

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
this speed transducer can run up up

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:42.740 
this speed transducer can run up up
under<00:02:33.630> all<00:02:35.300> over<00:02:37.730> and<00:02:38.730> install<00:02:39.150> to<00:02:39.180> the<00:02:40.850> 859<00:02:41.850> m

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750
