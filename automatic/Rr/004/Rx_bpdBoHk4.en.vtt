 miniature they simply were 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.100
 stories to amaze gelston storni that 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.320
 is a reference to a series of comics 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.629
 of marvel where game time makes its 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.610
 first appearance in the number number 27 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.829
 and then he becomes Amman in the 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.530
 number 35 and also has the debut 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.360
 of wasp on the number 44 after that 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.129

 robbins returns to the apartment that is 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.250
 at the hotel 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.220
 milgram which is a reference to the name 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.930
 from an artist writer to a dictator and 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.570
 marvel comics editor 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.700
 to the member this is something that we liked to 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.500
 all of us who follow the story of 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.960
 andy man within the comics almost the 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.120
 PNC who is the little daughter of Amman 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.850
 within the movie will grow for 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.890
 become a station that obviously is 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.330
 of the young avengers and also 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.800
 they have the same powers to do 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.470
 great to that little boy after 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.750
 expose themselves for years to the particles 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.640
 of sashes there are not many cameos in the 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.710
 movie dead man but health fans 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.450
 night life and the two brokers will be given 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.250
 account that the comedian garde morris 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.930
 is inside the car where scott 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.240
 lands in his first experience with 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.119
 the costume years ago acted dressed in 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.869
 Amman as part of a sketch in knowing 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.060
 night live 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.770
 the legendary stanley makes his cameo this 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.450
 time as a waiter inside the bar 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.759
 within the history of louis at the end 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.890
 from the movie also the fake name 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.649
 who uses scotland in baskin robbins 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.380
 it's jack that is a direct reference to 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.360
 jack kirby another big marvel 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.560
 there are several references to other heroes and 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.530
 situations within the universe 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.360
 cinematographic marvel the most common or 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.100
 the one that we realized then was a 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.780
 headline in a newspaper that says who 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.000
 We blame Segovia that has to do 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.860
 with the events 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.810
 and obviously there are the references to 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.700
 now we have superheroes who 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.980
 jump that sway and climb 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.230
 walls that we all think that 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.870
 It is obviously the first reference 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.150
 within the cinematographic universe of 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.260
 marvel to spider-man because it's a fact 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.020
 that we're going to see him in civilian equal and 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.850
 we keep celebrating though kevin fitch 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.850
 said that these references were 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:40.800
 generic that this had been done before 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.870
 that there was a deal with sonny but 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.480
 definitely even if they say they are 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.760
 generic jumps sways and climbs 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.930
 walls obviously spider-man and it's 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.760
 spectacular 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.430
 just hear it now imagine how 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:56.370
 it's going to be seeing it and it fills me with emotion 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.110
 also the melody whistling michael 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:01.110
 peÃ±a when he is a security guard 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.940
 of pantech as it is the main theme of 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:06.510
 the attraction of disney park in a 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:08.820
 small world we also see this group 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.710
 terrorist of the ten rings 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:13.290
 obviously we know the spirit of 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:15.930
 ironman that one of the people who was going 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:19.050
 to buy the ice suit since it has 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.670
 on his neck the tattoo the symbol of 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:23.099
 this terrorist group 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.840
 are some similarities that we find 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:27.060
 with the mythology of comics or 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.340
 curiosities just for example what 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.830
 what happens to janet send the wasp 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.080
 original is something very similar to what 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:36.239
 live inside the events of secret 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.730
 investment where it disappears 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:40.410
 mysteriously and hank then discover 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.660
 later as in the movie that 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.760
 it is not dead but it is in 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.500
 the micro verse also other data 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.930
 interesting is that yellow jackets is 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.730
 another one of the names or the aliases that 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.890
 He has used champagne throughout his 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.380
 mythology he suffers from a disorder of 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:57.450
 personality maybe this justifies 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:00.060
 those little pills that you are taking 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:02.310
 during the movie we can see the 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:05.130
 boat when it passes over this cabin 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.690
 security in pantech and finally the 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.459
 character of matt carson that is the 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:10.950
 character that we see with movie poster 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:12.390
 tony stark man's dad at the beginning 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.069
 of the movie and the end that is stolen 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:15.810
 the bread particles as well 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:17.459
 inside the comics is an agent 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:20.190
 corrupt decile that at some point 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:23.250
 he was chasing erico brady 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:25.020
 who also became a soul 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.430
 and obviously we have the two scenes 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.510
 post movie credits but 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.430
 we made a video 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:31.500
 to be able to explain them and enter more 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:33.720
 to the connection he has with the captain 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:36.000
 america civil war uses our menu 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.620
 interactive to see them at this moment 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.610
