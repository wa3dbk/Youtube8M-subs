 extension point com.br brasil it is 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.870
 registered the site registry.br then

 in Brazil and has a cnpj or cpf can 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.170
 making this record is important to take 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.890
 careful in choosing the name for example 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:19.259
 words that have a doubt in spelling is 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.460
 my private site instead of luis costa 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.889
 dot com 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.020
 I chose fernando costa com. 

00:01:22.889 --> 00:01:26.969
 luis doubt and the hill with this 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.920
 even sure you can do and 

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:31.499
 central the same with my cpf could 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.530
 do commercial dot com that also 

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:36.869
 could cpf formerly only with cnpj there 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.179
 cpf also allows the 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.679
 registration of dotcom domains until 

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:44.069
 some restrictions for other extensions 

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:46.859
 for example dot org.br can only 

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:49.109
 register and institutions without purpose 

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:51.329
 profit and non-governmental 

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:53.670
 you need a provider to register a 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:56.549
 domain exactly what I need is accurate 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.749
 a provider to host the site and the 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.029
 pedals and domain 

00:01:57.749 --> 00:02:01.770
 this provider it has to have some 

00:02:00.029 --> 00:02:05.009
 careful when hiring a provider 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:07.829
 are five basic steps there is the support 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.899
 and support time in Portuguese and English is 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:12.030
 have a qualified person so take 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.980
 careful when choosing a phone if 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.670
 have a telephone contact or just the 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.040
 Internet 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.610
 the second care is is a unique space 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.180
 what 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:23.250
 know how to use the third caution which 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.680
 traffic when the hits I'll have is 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:29.810
 I need to hire a traffic according to 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:33.270
 Step 4 is if the person will get a price 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:35.400
 feasible and the fifth step there would be more 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.440
 indication of someone else from you 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.470
 speak on price that costs on average the 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:44.010
 registration of a domain is an on rate 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:46.470
 minimum of one year of 30 reais and 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.300
 register the domain I have to pay 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.760
 a provider that monthly fee of around 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.590
 of 30 reais per month how long it takes 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.320
 to get a Sunday 2 is fine 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.720
 fast is a matter of less than one 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:00.330
 it's possible to have a website on the internet 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.380
 forty reais per year after 80 reais 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.050
 a month 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.489
 ordinary people can be expensive but with 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.290
 a company this is very little because 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:09.150
 does a lot of business on the internet is not 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.790
 extremely cheap which has a bit of 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.380
 creativity can start a business with 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.450
 spending very little if we are 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.610
 to compare the cost of opening a 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.950
 The real world is not that these sites are 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.900
 thus kept this provider as it is 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.690
 it is in this project of society then 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.370
 police concern of those points there 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.040
 when it comes to hiring a provider to 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:31.110
 that this site is secure that this 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.330
 project I make a backup of the data that 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.709
 I have there since this cleaning is then 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.600
 a very big concern at school 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:38.700
 in choosing the provider is like hiring 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:41.370
 another service any album contract 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.110
 the advantages and disadvantages exactly 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.880
 in addition to the care that people have 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:46.350
 real world has these others as 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.410
 care that we have with 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:51.269
 companies in the virtual world that 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:53.420
 with the participation of Brazil in this 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:53.420
 world
