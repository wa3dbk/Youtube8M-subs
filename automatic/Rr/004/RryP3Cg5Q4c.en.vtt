00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
contemplating having children might be a

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:35.570 
contemplating having children might be a
good<00:03:34.290> month<00:03:34.500> that<00:03:34.830> might<00:03:34.980> be<00:03:35.100> a<00:03:35.130> good<00:03:35.250> month<00:03:35.430> it

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
good month that might be a good month it

also I think a call to tap into
innocence<00:03:43.280> okay<00:03:44.280> what<00:03:44.970> makes<00:03:45.239> a<00:03:45.450> kid<00:03:45.840> say<00:03:46.709> and

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950

do the stuff that they say and do

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:52.490 
do the stuff that they say and do
innocence<00:03:50.180> you<00:03:51.180> know<00:03:51.360> because<00:03:52.050> they're<00:03:52.320> not

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
innocence you know because they're not

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.530
