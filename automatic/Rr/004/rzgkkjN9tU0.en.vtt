rack on it which I don't believe carries
anything<00:01:12.810> but<00:01:13.020> but<00:01:13.260> anyway<00:01:13.650> it's<00:01:13.920> it<00:01:14.490> adds<00:01:14.670> to

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
anything but but anyway it's it adds to

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
off to take me to the car show so I

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.490 
off to take me to the car show so I
parked<00:01:38.729> my<00:01:38.790> car<00:01:38.909> and<00:01:39.420> off<00:01:39.840> we<00:01:39.960> went<00:01:40.080> to<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.320> car

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
show and and that way I guess was the

start<00:01:44.970> of<00:01:45.060> our<00:01:45.150> friendship<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:45.900> yeah<00:01:46.850> anyway

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
start of our friendship and yeah anyway

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.820 
start of our friendship and yeah anyway
