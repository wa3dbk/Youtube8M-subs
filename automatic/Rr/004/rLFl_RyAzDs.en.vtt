00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.899
 Do you ever have children on a carousel? 

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:06.899
 watched 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:24.310
 this is when rain on the floor 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:25.750
 are you ever pattering that 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.650
 unpredictable flight one 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.650
 followed by butterfly 

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:35.180
 was hated by the fading night 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:38.480
 looked in the sun after dear 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:41.870
 slowly do not dance the time so fast 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.000
 the cabbage the music will not last forever 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.640

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.739

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:54.020
 if you ask somebody how are you 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:54.770
 Do you listen to the answer when the day 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.620
 is over 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.450
 Do you want to go to bed and then to the next one? 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.540
 100 duties we go through the 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:01.540
 head 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.880
 I prefer not to dance that way slowly 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:11.320
 fast time is short 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:14.210
 the music will not continue forever 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.860
 Did you ever say that to your child? 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:21.080

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:23.270
 Hastrich ever seen his grief 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.220
 the contact lost if a real one 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.229
 let friendship fall asleep because you 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:34.760

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:38.690
 to say slow dance 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:42.820
 not so fast the time of the short 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:42.820
 music will not continue forever 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.000
 if you so quickly runs to somewhere 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.729
 Added to the missed half fun 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.259
 on the way there 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:59.560
 if you are full of worries throughout the day 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:01.390
 rush windows as if you were 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.450
 Throw away an incredible gift 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:08.080
 life is not a bed in it let it 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:11.190
 slow down before listening to the music 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.190
 the song is over
