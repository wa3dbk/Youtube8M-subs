00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:06.439
 hello very good to all to all that such 

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:09.080
 as it is, we are going back for a new day 

00:00:06.439 --> 00:00:11.930
 in the distant future by the day number 7 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:14.990
 after unlocking the grapefruit 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:17.490
 let's try to use it in this 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:20.820
 new day to see see 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:25.619
 zombies attack us good the zombie with the 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:31.050
 pack the mini zombie and theft with or so 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:32.910
 that we are going to take mirasol map pool 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.430
 what else 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.490
 and our angry faces 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.380
 mouth of the dragon also because no and 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:43.530
 plan plants from the future we will choose 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:47.489
 the laser bean the grapefruit we have 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:50.820
 finished unlocking and one plus one 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:53.760
 more because not if we leave without troubles 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.390
 we will use the beta cherry so 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:00.079
 full team we're going there 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:04.059
 now this day number 7 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:07.070
 and come to start thinking to plant 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:12.670
 Sunflowers thoroughly before they start 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:12.670
 to come the first zombies come 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.530
 to see where I come first is worth 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:22.070
 the medium then quiet 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:24.140
 for peacock for you always is always the 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:27.140
 that the more pringá and the one that comes the 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:30.240
 first we always know everyone who is going to 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.610
 palmar it quickly 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.600
 and good we go planting the sunflowers 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.920
 above the marked boxes that those 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.750
 good those good ones and we leave without 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.490
 soles troubles and we can use 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:46.170
 a nutrient on top of the sunflower marked 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:51.479
 and it's as if we used two nutrients 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:54.390
 that's good that's effective is the 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.950
 strategy when planting 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.829
 plants is to put 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.869
 plants good attention to the boxes to 

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:04.380
 when using nutrients and so 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:08.200
 we get double advantage that's the good thing 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:10.890
 that's the easiest strategy for 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:13.690
 pass the screens with less difficulty 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.959
 so to see to see how we will my 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:19.660
 attention that everyone is coming out there 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:21.340
 we will be here the grapefruit come to 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.849
 trallazos to give trallazos give the 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.970
 Pómac grapefruit and plug it now 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:28.989
 now the beta will not affect that 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.599
 directly 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:33.610
 it's like a coconut I sell in automatic had 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:36.099
 a coconut automatic cannon and careful that 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:39.370
 come more on top we will stay with the 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:41.440
 grapefruit also come to load that 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:46.049
 comes with little gifts is that it comes with 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:49.120
 nutrients come perfect as water does not 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:52.209
 the bursting is broken 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:55.209
 impressive and attention because the 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:59.650
