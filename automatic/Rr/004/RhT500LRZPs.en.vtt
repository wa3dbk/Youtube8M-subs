00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.849
 Hi everybody today we have the Sigma 10-20mm a DC lens so not for cameras 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:22.589
 full frame and with aps and EX-series sensors, therefore of the higher-end series 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:31.070
 of Sigma regarding the construction. It is compatible being for non-cameras 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:39.200
 full frame with Canon EF-S cameras and Nikon DX cameras. this is a 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:46.839
 ultra wide angle lens for example useful for landscapes or nature photos but 

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:53.589
 let's see how it is built. Then it is composed of 13 lenses divided into 10 groups, 

00:00:53.589 --> 00:01:00.589
 among which we have 4 aspherical lenses and with Super Multi-Layer Coating coatings that 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:10.680
 they are used both to remove those annoying phantom effects and the flares due to the reflected light 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.990
 on the lenses. The diaphragm is composed of 7 blades and has a minimum aperture of f / 22 e 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:23.710
 maximum of / 3.5 with a continuous opening so whatever zoom level we will be we will have 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:31.590
 always the aperture set by us. The minimum focusing distance 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:40.549
 it is 24cm and the filter diameter is 82mm as we can see. Filters that can 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:47.500
 also be polarized because we have the internal focus as we can see, if I move 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:55.359
 the ring does nothing, the lens does not extend and the front lens does not rotate, 

00:01:55.359 --> 00:02:03.070
 so as I said, there is the possibility of mounting filters, even polarized. The focus as I said 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:09.710
 it happens internally and the manual focus is perennial and the autofocus is moved by a motor 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:18.590
 HSM therefore ultrasonic I must say very fast and also quite silent. These were 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:24.790
 the technical features, I'll show you that it has the switch for selecting the mode 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:33.459
 of focus if hybrid or only manual, here we have the writing EX that qualifies this 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:41.319
 goal as the best construction and this is the window on the indications of the 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:49.899
 focusing distance, so these were the construction information and features 

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:59.049
 techniques, I leave you to the videos and the sample photos. First I wanted to test how it is 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:03.909
 the photographic rendering of this lens and you can see that it is really interesting, 

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:12.159
 also lends itself to photographs we call creative as well as photographs of landscapes or photographs 

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:19.150
 naturalistic, so excellent feature of this lens and I also wanted to test 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:25.180
 how silent and fast the lens is, so now I'll be silent and I'll do it 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:32.180
 see and listen to the video. 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.060
 You could see how fast and silent it is 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:04:01.409
 this objective is in fact of the EX series, hence the family of range objectives 

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:08.360
 high on Sigma and I must say that it makes this lens grace the EX series, these that 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:16.799
 they are scrolling are general proof photos and I leave you to them, I repeat this goal 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:23.550
 it is very interesting from the point of view of the photographic rendering, I remind you that in the store 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:29.979
 you can find it available for both Nikon and Canon and Sony, if you have any questions, do it 

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:35.939
 well, we'll see you at a next video and nothing, at Ollo's everything, goodbye!
