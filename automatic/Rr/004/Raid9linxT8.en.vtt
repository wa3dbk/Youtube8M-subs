00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
Midwest I believe it's going to come

Midwest I believe it's going to come
back<00:02:17.230> here<00:02:17.290> the<00:02:17.980> byproducts<00:02:18.730> are<00:02:18.940> here<00:02:19.269> about

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
back here the byproducts are here about

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.190 
back here the byproducts are here about
an<00:02:20.140> endless<00:02:20.470> supply<00:02:20.650> of<00:02:20.860> those<00:02:21.160> right<00:02:21.459> now<00:02:22.200> but

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
an endless supply of those right now but

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.050 
an endless supply of those right now but
I<00:02:23.230> think<00:02:23.530> the<00:02:23.620> cattle<00:02:23.950> fed<00:02:24.160> or<00:02:24.430> the<00:02:24.760> cattle

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
I think the cattle fed or the cattle

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.280 
I think the cattle fed or the cattle
that<00:02:25.120> are<00:02:25.209> gonna<00:02:25.330> be<00:02:25.510> fed<00:02:25.750> it's<00:02:25.989> gonna<00:02:26.110> be

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
that are gonna be fed it's gonna be

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.890 
that are gonna be fed it's gonna be
under<00:02:26.440> roof<00:02:26.799> I<00:02:27.100> look<00:02:27.760> for<00:02:27.940> that<00:02:28.090> the

under roof I look for that the

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.650 
under roof I look for that the
efficiency<00:02:29.380> factor<00:02:29.950> involved<00:02:30.549> the<00:02:31.239> runoff

efficiency factor involved the runoff
facts<00:02:31.989> involved<00:02:32.590> I<00:02:32.830> just<00:02:33.100> don't<00:02:33.489> see<00:02:33.670> open

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940
