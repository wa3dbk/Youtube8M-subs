00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:22.900 
up and by the wrong amount but yeah it

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:24.300 
up and by the wrong amount but yeah it
was<00:06:22.960> supposed<00:06:23.200> to<00:06:23.260> be<00:06:23.320> two<00:06:23.530> base<00:06:23.740> on<00:06:23.920> top<00:06:24.160> but

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:24.310 
was supposed to be two base on top but

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:25.710 
was supposed to be two base on top but
they<00:06:24.430> gave<00:06:24.580> you<00:06:24.670> an<00:06:24.790> extra<00:06:24.880> instead<00:06:25.360> of<00:06:25.480> a<00:06:25.540> base

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:25.720 
they gave you an extra instead of a base

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:28.020 
they gave you an extra instead of a base
that<00:06:25.750> gave<00:06:26.140> you<00:06:26.290> an<00:06:26.440> extra<00:06:26.610> rocky<00:06:27.610> patch<00:06:27.760> on<00:06:28.000> it

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:31.360 
so that's better than base i guess but i

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.030 
so that's better than base i guess but i
appreciate<00:06:31.570> it<00:06:32.080> as<00:06:32.200> always<00:06:32.470> a<00:06:32.650> time<00:06:32.830> and<00:06:32.950> i'll
