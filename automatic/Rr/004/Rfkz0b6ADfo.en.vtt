00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
creation of that video you'll notice I'm

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.250 
creation of that video you'll notice I'm
no<00:00:23.010> longer<00:00:23.220> using<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:24.210> engine<00:00:24.570> Guardian<00:00:24.990> set

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
no longer using the engine Guardian set

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.050 
no longer using the engine Guardian set
and<00:00:25.470> this<00:00:25.619> is<00:00:25.800> actually<00:00:26.160> not<00:00:26.369> because<00:00:26.580> I<00:00:26.939> don't

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
and this is actually not because I don't

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.939 
and this is actually not because I don't
prefer<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.109> engine<00:00:28.349> Guardian<00:00:28.680> set<00:00:28.830> but

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
prefer the engine Guardian set but

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.439 
prefer the engine Guardian set but
because<00:00:29.220> I'd<00:00:29.369> actually<00:00:29.670> don't<00:00:29.849> have<00:00:30.119> the

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
because I'd actually don't have the

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.190 
because I'd actually don't have the
correct<00:00:30.900> pieces<00:00:31.669> I'll<00:00:32.669> actually<00:00:32.969> need<00:00:33.690> to<00:00:33.930> get

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
correct pieces I'll actually need to get

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.600 
correct pieces I'll actually need to get
the<00:00:35.690> heavy<00:00:36.690> engine<00:00:37.320> Guardian<00:00:37.710> helm<00:00:38.010> to<00:00:38.460> go

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
the heavy engine Guardian helm to go

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.670 
the heavy engine Guardian helm to go
along<00:00:38.879> with<00:00:39.059> my<00:00:39.300> heavy<00:00:39.780> shoulders<00:00:40.140> before

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
along with my heavy shoulders before

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.170 
along with my heavy shoulders before
I'll<00:00:40.890> be<00:00:41.010> able<00:00:41.100> to<00:00:41.190> run<00:00:41.340> that<00:00:41.579> and<00:00:41.790> that's<00:00:41.940> only

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
I'll be able to run that and that's only

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.180 
I'll be able to run that and that's only
because<00:00:42.440> you<00:00:43.440> actually<00:00:43.770> want<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:43.950> be<00:00:44.040> able<00:00:44.100> to

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
because you actually want to be able to

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.630 
because you actually want to be able to
run<00:00:44.340> five<00:00:44.610> pieces<00:00:44.940> of<00:00:45.090> heavy<00:00:45.770> armor<00:00:46.770> and<00:00:46.950> if

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
run five pieces of heavy armor and if

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.049 
run five pieces of heavy armor and if
you<00:00:47.789> use<00:00:48.059> two<00:00:48.360> pieces<00:00:48.570> of<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.950> Warlock<00:00:50.700> gear

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
you use two pieces of the Warlock gear

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.420 
you use two pieces of the Warlock gear
like<00:00:51.270> I'm<00:00:51.420> using<00:00:51.600> here<00:00:52.070> you<00:00:53.070> won't<00:00:53.250> actually

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
like I'm using here you won't actually

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.590 
like I'm using here you won't actually
be<00:00:53.789> able<00:00:53.940> to<00:00:55.160> equip<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.489> two<00:00:56.850> engine<00:00:57.210> Guardian

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
be able to equip the two engine Guardian

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.290 
be able to equip the two engine Guardian
and<00:00:57.750> still<00:00:57.960> have<00:00:58.109> five<00:00:58.350> heavy<00:00:58.620> pieces<00:00:59.129> so<00:00:59.879> if

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
and still have five heavy pieces so if

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.000 
and still have five heavy pieces so if
you<00:01:00.390> have<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.870> engine<00:01:01.109> Guardian<00:01:01.500> both<00:01:01.680> heavy

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
you have the engine Guardian both heavy

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.329 
you have the engine Guardian both heavy
you<00:01:02.520> can<00:01:02.730> definitely<00:01:02.969> use<00:01:03.449> that<00:01:04.250> the<00:01:05.250> other

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
you can definitely use that the other

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.890 
you can definitely use that the other
change<00:01:05.610> I<00:01:05.729> made<00:01:05.909> is<00:01:06.030> instead<00:01:06.360> of<00:01:06.420> using<00:01:06.630> the

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
change I made is instead of using the

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.990 
change I made is instead of using the
seducer<00:01:07.470> I'm<00:01:07.710> actually<00:01:07.890> using<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.490> Magnus

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
seducer I'm actually using the Magnus

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.289 
seducer I'm actually using the Magnus
helm<00:01:09.860> or<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:10.979> Magnus<00:01:11.310> said<00:01:11.549> I<00:01:11.580> should<00:01:11.820> say<00:01:12.030> and

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
helm or the Magnus said I should say and

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.570 
helm or the Magnus said I should say and
that's<00:01:12.840> mostly<00:01:13.530> for<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.830> increase<00:01:14.100> in<00:01:14.250> spell

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
that's mostly for the increase in spell

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.520 
that's mostly for the increase in spell
damage<00:01:14.790> now<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.630> correct<00:01:15.930> way<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.170> do<00:01:16.380> this

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
damage now the correct way to do this

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.230 
damage now the correct way to do this
would<00:01:16.770> actually<00:01:17.070> be<00:01:17.159> to<00:01:17.189> have<00:01:17.369> your<00:01:17.520> staff<00:01:17.909> be

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
would actually be to have your staff be

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.859 
would actually be to have your staff be
Magnus<00:01:18.860> your<00:01:19.860> chest<00:01:20.630> legs<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:23.270> belt<00:01:24.270> be

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
Magnus your chest legs and belt be

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.719 
Magnus your chest legs and belt be
Magnus<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:25.590> you'll<00:01:25.890> actually<00:01:26.040> run<00:01:26.430> a<00:01:26.460> four

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
Magnus and you'll actually run a four

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:27.980 
Magnus and you'll actually run a four
piece<00:01:26.970> and<00:01:27.210> you're<00:01:27.299> kind<00:01:27.479> of<00:01:27.509> just<00:01:27.689> ignore

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
piece and you're kind of just ignore

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.690 
piece and you're kind of just ignore
that<00:01:28.200> eight<00:01:28.409> percent<00:01:28.619> chance<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.310> negate<00:01:29.579> the

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
that eight percent chance to negate the

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:30.950 
that eight percent chance to negate the
cost<00:01:29.880> of<00:01:30.030> a<00:01:30.090> spell<00:01:30.270> because<00:01:30.509> it's<00:01:30.659> really<00:01:30.810> not

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
cost of a spell because it's really not

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.190 
cost of a spell because it's really not
that<00:01:31.259> powerful<00:01:32.329> along<00:01:33.329> with<00:01:33.479> that<00:01:33.630> you'll<00:01:33.930> run

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
that powerful along with that you'll run

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.580 
that powerful along with that you'll run
the<00:01:34.500> Warlock<00:01:35.460> set<00:01:35.759> five<00:01:36.060> piece<00:01:36.299> and<00:01:36.780> you'll

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
the Warlock set five piece and you'll

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.830 
the Warlock set five piece and you'll
run<00:01:37.710> your<00:01:37.770> engine<00:01:38.040> guardian<00:01:38.670> hidden<00:01:39.360> chest<00:01:39.630> in

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
run your engine guardian hidden chest in

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.090 
run your engine guardian hidden chest in
my<00:01:39.960> case<00:01:40.200> I<00:01:40.380> don't<00:01:40.439> have<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.829> ancient

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
my case I don't have the ancient

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.830 
my case I don't have the ancient
guardian<00:01:41.369> just<00:01:41.579> yet<00:01:41.820> so<00:01:42.119> I'm<00:01:42.270> just<00:01:42.299> using<00:01:42.600> a

guardian just yet so I'm just using a

guardian just yet so I'm just using a

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
five piece Magnus because it rounds out

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.450 
five piece Magnus because it rounds out
to<00:01:44.790> build<00:01:44.970> pretty<00:01:45.149> nicely<00:01:45.420> on<00:01:45.869> your<00:01:46.740> other<00:01:47.100> bar

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460

you'll<00:01:47.729> notice<00:01:48.000> that<00:01:48.090> I'm<00:01:48.210> no<00:01:48.390> longer<00:01:48.420> using<00:01:49.259> a

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
you'll notice that I'm no longer using a

resto<00:01:50.040> staff<00:01:50.280> I'm<00:01:50.520> actually<00:01:50.700> swapped<00:01:51.180> over<00:01:51.299> to

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
resto staff I'm actually swapped over to

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:52.940 
resto staff I'm actually swapped over to
a<00:01:51.600> sword<00:01:51.899> and<00:01:52.020> shield<00:01:52.229> and<00:01:52.409> this<00:01:52.530> is<00:01:52.680> mainly

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
a sword and shield and this is mainly

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.429 
a sword and shield and this is mainly
just<00:01:53.430> for<00:01:53.759> reduced<00:01:54.240> cost<00:01:54.540> and<00:01:54.689> blocking<00:01:55.200> so<00:01:55.409> I

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
just for reduced cost and blocking so I

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:56.959 
just for reduced cost and blocking so I
can<00:01:55.680> block<00:01:55.890> a<00:01:55.950> little<00:01:56.310> bit<00:01:56.460> more<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:56.759> prevent

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
can block a little bit more to prevent

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.850 
can block a little bit more to prevent
so<00:01:57.180> many<00:01:57.210> stuns<00:01:57.750> and<00:01:57.990> CCS<00:01:58.380> and<00:01:58.500> that<00:01:58.619> sort<00:01:58.829> of

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
so many stuns and CCS and that sort of

00:01:58.860 --> 00:01:59.770 
so many stuns and CCS and that sort of
thing

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
thing

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.620

Bristow staff is still very good I just

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.600 
Bristow staff is still very good I just
felt<00:02:03.110> like<00:02:03.170> the<00:02:03.890> way<00:02:04.010> I've<00:02:04.190> been<00:02:04.370> playing

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
felt like the way I've been playing

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:05.980 
felt like the way I've been playing
lately<00:02:04.850> that<00:02:05.270> the<00:02:05.390> sword<00:02:05.630> and<00:02:05.720> shield<00:02:05.840> was<00:02:05.960> a

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
lately that the sword and shield was a

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:07.540 
lately that the sword and shield was a
little<00:02:06.260> bit<00:02:06.380> better<00:02:06.530> for<00:02:06.740> me<00:02:06.890> and<00:02:07.130> that<00:02:07.220> also

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550 
little bit better for me and that also

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.310 
little bit better for me and that also
allowed<00:02:07.790> me<00:02:07.820> to<00:02:08.090> make<00:02:08.240> tor<00:02:08.479> x-pac's<00:02:08.960> that<00:02:09.259> way

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:09.320 
allowed me to make tor x-pac's that way

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:10.480 
allowed me to make tor x-pac's that way
I<00:02:09.350> can<00:02:09.530> actually<00:02:09.649> get<00:02:09.860> some<00:02:10.040> bonus<00:02:10.280> spell

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:10.490 
I can actually get some bonus spell

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.950

damage on this other bar that's about

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.840 
damage on this other bar that's about
all<00:02:15.200> the<00:02:15.410> gear<00:02:15.710> changes<00:02:16.130> though<00:02:16.370> if<00:02:16.490> we<00:02:16.610> swap

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
all the gear changes though if we swap

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:18.730 
all the gear changes though if we swap
over<00:02:16.970> to<00:02:17.300> our<00:02:17.480> skills<00:02:18.020> you'll<00:02:18.560> actually

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:18.740 
over to our skills you'll actually

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.310 
over to our skills you'll actually
notice<00:02:19.100> that<00:02:19.550> I've<00:02:20.210> made<00:02:20.390> a<00:02:20.450> couple<00:02:20.690> of<00:02:20.960> minor

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
notice that I've made a couple of minor

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.090 
notice that I've made a couple of minor
changes<00:02:21.860> here<00:02:22.160> I'm<00:02:22.310> no<00:02:22.460> longer<00:02:22.670> using<00:02:23.300> eclipse

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
changes here I'm no longer using eclipse

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.420 
changes here I'm no longer using eclipse
and<00:02:25.180> instead<00:02:26.180> I'm<00:02:26.720> using<00:02:27.430> proximity

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
and instead I'm using proximity

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.900 
and instead I'm using proximity
detonation<00:02:29.740> and<00:02:30.740> the<00:02:31.280> reason<00:02:31.580> I'm<00:02:31.700> using

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
detonation and the reason I'm using

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.030 
detonation and the reason I'm using
proximity<00:02:32.570> detonation<00:02:32.690> is<00:02:33.380> actually<00:02:33.890> just

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
proximity detonation is actually just

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.280 
proximity detonation is actually just
four<00:02:34.310> bursts<00:02:34.580> I<00:02:35.060> have<00:02:35.420> a<00:02:35.450> lot<00:02:35.660> of<00:02:35.750> issues<00:02:36.080> with

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
four bursts I have a lot of issues with

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.190 
four bursts I have a lot of issues with
getting<00:02:36.680> people<00:02:36.830> killed<00:02:37.610> so<00:02:38.480> proximity

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
getting people killed so proximity

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.470 
getting people killed so proximity
detonation<00:02:39.350> helps<00:02:40.190> to<00:02:40.430> burst<00:02:41.120> them<00:02:41.330> down

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
detonation helps to burst them down

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.960 
detonation helps to burst them down
quickly<00:02:41.810> if<00:02:42.020> I<00:02:42.230> can<00:02:42.260> get<00:02:42.500> the<00:02:42.620> cast<00:02:42.800> off<00:02:43.040> now<00:02:43.850> it

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
quickly if I can get the cast off now it

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.840 
quickly if I can get the cast off now it
is<00:02:44.180> perfectly<00:02:44.720> okay<00:02:45.140> to<00:02:45.200> still<00:02:45.620> use<00:02:45.980> the

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
is perfectly okay to still use the

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.500 
is perfectly okay to still use the
Eclipse<00:02:47.920> but<00:02:48.920> just<00:02:49.250> personal<00:02:49.910> preference<00:02:50.180> of

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
Eclipse but just personal preference of

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:51.840 
Eclipse but just personal preference of
mine<00:02:50.540> is<00:02:50.840> use<00:02:50.990> the<00:02:51.110> proximity<00:02:51.470> detonation

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
mine is use the proximity detonation

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.640 
mine is use the proximity detonation
before<00:02:52.850> I<00:02:52.880> charge<00:02:53.270> in<00:02:53.540> and<00:02:53.750> explode<00:02:54.170> with<00:02:54.440> some

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
before I charge in and explode with some

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.090 
before I charge in and explode with some
puncturing<00:02:55.010> sweeps<00:02:55.700> and<00:02:56.120> radiant<00:02:56.480> oppression

puncturing sweeps and radiant oppression

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.770 
puncturing sweeps and radiant oppression
another<00:02:58.100> change<00:02:58.459> that<00:02:58.580> I<00:02:58.760> made<00:02:58.790> is<00:02:59.270> I<00:02:59.450> moved

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
another change that I made is I moved

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.500 
another change that I made is I moved
the<00:03:00.350> vampires<00:03:00.980> Bane<00:03:01.250> to<00:03:01.490> my<00:03:01.610> second<00:03:02.060> bar<00:03:02.240> so

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
the vampires Bane to my second bar so

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.150 
the vampires Bane to my second bar so
that<00:03:02.540> can<00:03:02.780> actually<00:03:02.930> catch<00:03:03.320> them<00:03:03.500> all<00:03:03.709> my<00:03:03.950> dots

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
that can actually catch them all my dots

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.970 
that can actually catch them all my dots
all<00:03:04.489> of<00:03:04.670> my<00:03:04.820> ground<00:03:05.000> effects<00:03:05.780> and<00:03:06.140> keep<00:03:06.830> myself

close<00:03:34.040> to<00:03:34.160> your<00:03:34.280> target<00:03:34.670> the<00:03:35.360> Dawnbreaker

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
close to your target the Dawnbreaker

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.920 
close to your target the Dawnbreaker
smiting<00:03:36.230> hits<00:03:36.530> harder<00:03:36.950> it's<00:03:37.370> faster<00:03:38.060> it<00:03:38.690> can

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
smiting hits harder it's faster it can

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.050 
smiting hits harder it's faster it can
stun<00:03:39.350> it<00:03:39.739> costs<00:03:40.160> less<00:03:40.400> and<00:03:40.430> it<00:03:40.760> can't<00:03:40.970> be

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
stun it costs less and it can't be

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:42.940 
stun it costs less and it can't be
reflected<00:03:41.780> and<00:03:41.900> that's<00:03:42.019> the<00:03:42.200> big<00:03:42.380> thing<00:03:42.410> so

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:42.950 
reflected and that's the big thing so

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.130 
reflected and that's the big thing so
definitely<00:03:43.880> recommend<00:03:44.090> the<00:03:44.540> dawn<00:03:44.720> breaker<00:03:45.019> of

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
definitely recommend the dawn breaker of

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.280 
definitely recommend the dawn breaker of
smiting<00:03:45.650> over<00:03:45.920> the<00:03:46.010> meteor<00:03:46.340> and<00:03:47.300> I<00:03:47.750> still<00:03:48.080> do

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
smiting over the meteor and I still do

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.080 
smiting over the meteor and I still do
use<00:03:48.620> the<00:03:48.860> empowering<00:03:49.250> sweep<00:03:49.610> to<00:03:49.790> help<00:03:49.940> my

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
use the empowering sweep to help my

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.380 
use the empowering sweep to help my
defenses<00:03:50.630> if<00:03:50.750> I'm<00:03:50.870> really<00:03:51.170> getting<00:03:51.410> beat<00:03:51.590> on

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.390 
defenses if I'm really getting beat on

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:54.130 
defenses if I'm really getting beat on
alternative<00:03:53.390> to<00:03:53.480> that<00:03:53.570> is<00:03:53.630> actually<00:03:53.959> you<00:03:54.019> can

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140 
alternative to that is actually you can

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:55.479 
alternative to that is actually you can
use<00:03:54.260> soul<00:03:54.470> assault<00:03:54.830> if<00:03:54.980> you<00:03:55.040> want<00:03:55.190> to<00:03:55.250> range

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489 
use soul assault if you want to range

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:57.910 
use soul assault if you want to range
finisher<00:03:56.450> but<00:03:56.989> I<00:03:57.049> think<00:03:57.410> the<00:03:57.530> empowering

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
finisher but I think the empowering

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.130 
finisher but I think the empowering
sleep<00:03:58.220> is<00:03:58.370> actually<00:03:58.760> better

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 
sleep is actually better

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.530 
sleep is actually better
but<00:04:01.140> that's<00:04:01.500> it<00:04:01.770> for<00:04:01.800> all<00:04:02.340> the<00:04:02.670> major<00:04:02.880> changes

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
but that's it for all the major changes

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.480 
but that's it for all the major changes
um<00:04:03.870> the<00:04:04.380> last<00:04:04.560> thing<00:04:04.740> you<00:04:04.830> may<00:04:04.950> want<00:04:04.980> to<00:04:05.220> see<00:04:05.400> as

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:05.490 
um the last thing you may want to see as

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:06.680 
um the last thing you may want to see as
