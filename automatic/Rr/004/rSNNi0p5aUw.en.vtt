00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.179
 my weekly case opening series 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.759
 you heard right from now on everyone 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.430
 Monday at 18 o'clock is here on this 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.020
 channel a case opening video always with 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.789
 different cases I do not know yet 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.490
 exactly when I'm on but which 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.320
 Today there are ten Hans Lenk is so well 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.080
 again every week ten boxes each 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.609
 week monday 18 o'clock so i thought so 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.040
 so bring what a little bit of regular 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.930
 here and I also said I am talking 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:38.399
 always too long and yes at the beginning 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:41.820
 that's why new new sounds i thought 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.260
 So since the last patch, yes 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.170
 generally new sounds continue now 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.210
 you have now if the weapon 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.739
 displayed it will always be 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.690
 new song I did not know that when 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.480
 you put the boxes on here then 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.370
 even the sounds were exchanged 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.930
 To be honest, we have the 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.930
 Sounds better before 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.090
 but well you can not do anything here 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.260
 we pull the galil 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.869
 I have already reacted you have 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.310
 all the gauls are definitely here 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:10.890
 service probably the most beautiful galile 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.689
 the camera can not do anything there 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.860
 against align so yes again completely 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.360
 short to the cheese necessarily here 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.189
 cost a pig, above all 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.330
 if I do it weekly and me 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.500
 I would like to be very thankful if you 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.670
 I've got something if I'm her 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.930
 anything left did what any 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.750
 may assign no idea 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.470
 any boxes or keys or 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.820
 any skin is not here to 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.770
 I need to be very happy 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.130
 And finally, I can only do that 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.420
 so finance because 18 euros per video 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.500
 and four times a month 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:42.030
 there comes already something nice together 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.079
 currently does not look so good we 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.920
 did not have that much luck with that 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:48.600
 huntsman likes to crate here 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.159
 breakout but there I already have 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.630
 so many videos made of that 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.780
 I thought I could change a bit 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.640
 yes not hurt, especially since already 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.579
