00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:09.200
 To the bathroom gabriel squall today I 

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:12.370
 I'm 33 years old 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:16.870
 formed the first group in 2004 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:19.720
 general social information john dentist 

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:21.250
 at graduation in fainÃ© she was very 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.830
 profitable, right? 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.660
 despite being the first group we 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:26.830
 we had a lot of teaching staff 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.590
 qualified 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:31.630
 my training beyond graduation is 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:34.110
 specialist in maxillofacial surgery 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.110
 facial 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.280
 when the course of 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:43.700
 dentistry in fae 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:47.300
 I saw in it an opportunity to 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:49.460
 study to do a college and I 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:53.809
 framed in that, I go 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:57.350
 try and feel it at that moment if 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:59.239
 fit within our budget is 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.760
 a beauty from a college as always 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:04.010
 was but I think it really marked the 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:08.180
 my personal and professional life was the 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:11.740
 contact with some people in the case of 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:13.820
 I want, besides teachers, people with 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:17.050
 very good nature 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:20.210
 these people have succeeded is also 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:23.930
 dazzle me is someone who could 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:28.910
 It's also good to be a good teacher. 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:31.460
 and back is not a day to fai where 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:35.619
 everything started and you can reciprocate it in 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:39.259
 Something like that, I take it. 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:40.160
 a more experienced older person 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:42.800
 give us 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.869
 I always looked for this despite a few 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.720
 I always looked for people with 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:49.940
 more experience not to shorten the 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:54.530
 way to learn from them 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:57.259
 my father in his simplicity has always been 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:00.080
 a very honest person very correct 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:03.770

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:09.110
 patients coming from the single 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.020
 Cheers 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:14.540
 people with low low - income 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:17.060
 schooling, then this social point of 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.670
 fai is important and adamantine 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.020
 region not only lie but the region 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.660
