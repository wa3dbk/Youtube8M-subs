00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:09.880 
get nice and sizzling as always return
the<00:04:08.510> grill<00:04:08.660> down<00:04:08.959> now<00:04:09.170> that<00:04:09.350> they've<00:04:09.530> heated

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:09.890 
the grill down now that they've heated

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:12.069 
the grill down now that they've heated
up<00:04:10.040> so<00:04:10.250> we'll<00:04:10.370> give<00:04:10.519> that<00:04:10.730> probably<00:04:11.360> about<00:04:11.540> ten

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:12.079 
up so we'll give that probably about ten

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:13.479 
up so we'll give that probably about ten
minutes<00:04:12.290> on<00:04:12.590> that<00:04:12.709> side<00:04:12.950> then<00:04:13.130> we'll<00:04:13.220> flip<00:04:13.430> it

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:13.489 
minutes on that side then we'll flip it

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:16.270 
minutes on that side then we'll flip it
over<00:04:13.959> and<00:04:14.959> we'll<00:04:15.380> finish<00:04:15.739> it<00:04:15.980> off<00:04:16.070> so<00:04:16.100> we're

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 
over and we'll finish it off so we're

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:17.469 
over and we'll finish it off so we're
just<00:04:16.310> going<00:04:16.519> to<00:04:16.579> pull<00:04:16.669> the<00:04:16.789> hood<00:04:16.970> down<00:04:17.120> so<00:04:17.390> we

00:04:17.469 --> 00:04:17.479 
just going to pull the hood down so we

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:19.150 
just going to pull the hood down so we
keep<00:04:17.630> all<00:04:17.780> the<00:04:17.810> heat<00:04:18.049> in<00:04:18.109> give<00:04:18.739> it<00:04:18.829> a<00:04:18.890> bit<00:04:18.979> of<00:04:19.070> a

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.160 
keep all the heat in give it a bit of a

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.630 
keep all the heat in give it a bit of a
roast<00:04:19.370> at<00:04:19.609> the<00:04:19.820> same<00:04:20.000> time

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:24.640 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.680 

so<00:04:25.640> we're<00:04:25.760> just<00:04:25.790> going<00:04:25.970> to<00:04:26.060> put<00:04:26.240> this<00:04:26.390> land

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
so we're just going to put this land

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.260 
so we're just going to put this land
over<00:04:27.200> now<00:04:27.350> she'll<00:04:28.160> come<00:04:28.340> up<00:04:28.370> nice<00:04:28.670> and<00:04:29.000> easy

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270 
over now she'll come up nice and easy

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.770 
over now she'll come up nice and easy
and<00:04:30.730> we'll<00:04:31.730> just<00:04:31.880> flip<00:04:32.030> it<00:04:32.060> straight<00:04:32.390> over<00:04:32.540> now

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:32.780 
and we'll just flip it straight over now

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:34.330 
and we'll just flip it straight over now
what's<00:04:33.020> probably<00:04:33.680> going<00:04:33.830> to<00:04:33.890> happen<00:04:33.950> here

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
what's probably going to happen here

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.190 
what's probably going to happen here
because<00:04:34.460> we've<00:04:34.700> got<00:04:34.730> some<00:04:35.180> some<00:04:35.930> flame

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:36.200 
because we've got some some flame

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:37.720 
because we've got some some flame
underneath<00:04:36.500> as<00:04:36.800> it<00:04:36.920> might<00:04:37.100> flame<00:04:37.400> up<00:04:37.550> but

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:37.730 
underneath as it might flame up but

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:39.190 
underneath as it might flame up but
again<00:04:37.820> I<00:04:38.120> reckon<00:04:38.360> that's<00:04:38.510> okay<00:04:38.810> because<00:04:38.960> it's

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:39.200 
again I reckon that's okay because it's

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:40.990 
again I reckon that's okay because it's
just<00:04:39.320> going<00:04:39.440> to<00:04:39.530> crisp<00:04:40.310> it<00:04:40.460> up<00:04:40.520> as<00:04:40.760> long<00:04:40.880> as

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 
just going to crisp it up as long as

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.280 
just going to crisp it up as long as
they'll<00:04:41.150> get<00:04:41.300> out<00:04:41.450> of<00:04:41.540> control<00:04:41.780> you<00:04:41.990> should<00:04:42.170> be

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:42.290 
they'll get out of control you should be

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.760 
they'll get out of control you should be
fine

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.770 
fine

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:44.530 
fine
just<00:04:43.100> close<00:04:43.280> your<00:04:43.460> lid<00:04:43.610> down<00:04:43.730> again<00:04:44.060> so<00:04:44.270> you're

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:44.540 
just close your lid down again so you're

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:46.510 
just close your lid down again so you're
roasting<00:04:45.170> it<00:04:45.500> as<00:04:45.620> much<00:04:45.770> as<00:04:45.920> grilling<00:04:46.250> it<00:04:46.370> and

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:46.520 
roasting it as much as grilling it and

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.730 
roasting it as much as grilling it and
that'll<00:04:47.090> be<00:04:47.150> ready<00:04:47.300> in<00:04:47.480> about<00:04:47.540> another<00:04:47.930> 15

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 
that'll be ready in about another 15

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:52.170
