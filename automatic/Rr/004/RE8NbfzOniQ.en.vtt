is what the coupler looks like so you're

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.350 
is what the coupler looks like so you're
just<00:02:20.830> going<00:02:21.100> to<00:02:21.130> drop<00:02:21.460> it<00:02:21.640> right<00:02:21.670> into<00:02:21.970> the<00:02:22.150> bag

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
just going to drop it right into the bag

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.480 
just going to drop it right into the bag
and<00:02:22.690> what<00:02:22.870> I<00:02:22.900> do<00:02:23.050> is<00:02:23.440> I<00:02:23.590> push<00:02:23.860> it<00:02:24.010> down<00:02:24.220> a<00:02:24.250> little

and what I do is I push it down a little
bit<00:02:24.640> to<00:02:25.540> see<00:02:25.780> where<00:02:25.990> I<00:02:26.020> need<00:02:26.320> to<00:02:26.440> cut<00:02:26.650> it<00:02:26.680> off

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.130 

still<00:02:30.520> not<00:02:30.670> quite<00:02:30.850> enough<00:02:30.970> so<00:02:31.300> you<00:02:31.720> do<00:02:32.080> it

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
still not quite enough so you do it

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:37.830 
still not quite enough so you do it
again<00:02:32.440> and<00:02:35.280> you<00:02:36.280> want<00:02:36.490> the<00:02:36.640> top<00:02:37.150> part<00:02:37.450> showing
