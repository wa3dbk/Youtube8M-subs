Kentucky<00:02:09.600> it's<00:02:09.899> it's<00:02:10.110> Lexington<00:02:10.679> so<00:02:10.860> I've

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
Kentucky it's it's Lexington so I've

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.710 
Kentucky it's it's Lexington so I've
sort<00:02:11.280> of<00:02:11.310> been<00:02:11.430> here<00:02:11.640> before<00:02:11.760> so<00:02:12.300> I<00:02:12.330> think<00:02:12.450> it's

horse that's capable of an individual
medal<00:03:17.489> you<00:03:17.790> know<00:03:18.170> you<00:03:19.170> know<00:03:19.260> I<00:03:19.290> think<00:03:19.470> it's

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
medal you know you know I think it's

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:21.259 
medal you know you know I think it's
obviously<00:03:20.130> it's<00:03:20.250> sad<00:03:20.489> and<00:03:20.700> disappointing

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
obviously it's sad and disappointing

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:22.940 
obviously it's sad and disappointing
with<00:03:21.420> Kim<00:03:21.660> bowing<00:03:22.049> out<00:03:22.200> but<00:03:22.470> they've<00:03:22.680> replaced

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
with Kim bowing out but they've replaced

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.949 
with Kim bowing out but they've replaced
that<00:03:23.250> with<00:03:23.310> Karen<00:03:23.790> who<00:03:24.030> who<00:03:24.450> has<00:03:24.750> the

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
that with Karen who who has the

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.380 
that with Karen who who has the
opportunity<00:03:25.230> to<00:03:25.650> get<00:03:26.400> an<00:03:26.549> individual<00:03:27.090> medals

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
opportunity to get an individual medals

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.930 
opportunity to get an individual medals
so<00:03:27.600> I<00:03:27.630> think<00:03:27.750> it's<00:03:28.110> it's<00:03:28.739> it's<00:03:29.070> you<00:03:29.700> know<00:03:29.820> it's

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
so I think it's it's it's you know it's

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.880 
so I think it's it's it's you know it's
a<00:03:30.000> setback<00:03:30.269> but<00:03:30.450> it's<00:03:30.750> by<00:03:30.930> no<00:03:30.959> means<00:03:31.170> over

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
a setback but it's by no means over

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:33.350 
a setback but it's by no means over
definitely<00:03:32.340> definitely<00:03:32.579> what<00:03:32.910> do<00:03:32.970> you<00:03:33.060> what

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
definitely definitely what do you what

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.160 
definitely definitely what do you what
do<00:03:33.420> you<00:03:33.450> think<00:03:33.600> about<00:03:33.690> this<00:03:33.840> cross-country

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
do you think about this cross-country

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:35.509 
do you think about this cross-country
course<00:03:34.440> you've<00:03:34.560> walked<00:03:34.860> around<00:03:35.100> it<00:03:35.310> I<00:03:35.400> mean

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
course you've walked around it I mean

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:37.670 
course you've walked around it I mean
what<00:03:35.640> are<00:03:35.670> your<00:03:35.790> thoughts<00:03:35.970> inside<00:03:36.750> it's<00:03:37.260> big<00:03:37.500> a

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
what are your thoughts inside it's big a

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.400 
what are your thoughts inside it's big a
like<00:03:37.950> it's<00:03:38.720> the<00:03:39.720> biggest<00:03:40.049> course<00:03:40.260> I've

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
like it's the biggest course I've

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.470 
like it's the biggest course I've
probably<00:03:40.590> write<00:03:40.890> written<00:03:41.340> in<00:03:41.459> in<00:03:41.700> size<00:03:41.970> like

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
probably write written in in size like

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.240 
probably write written in in size like
the<00:03:42.690> you<00:03:43.079> know<00:03:43.110> you<00:03:43.230> come<00:03:43.440> up<00:03:43.590> defense<00:03:43.920> three

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
the you know you come up defense three

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.900 
the you know you come up defense three
and<00:03:44.430> it's<00:03:44.519> it's<00:03:44.880> that<00:03:45.060> big<00:03:45.269> yeah<00:03:46.430> I<00:03:47.430> think<00:03:47.820> I'll

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
and it's it's that big yeah I think I'll

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:49.310 
and it's it's that big yeah I think I'll
say<00:03:48.120> my<00:03:48.329> horse<00:03:48.540> a<00:03:48.660> little<00:03:48.750> bit<00:03:48.989> because<00:03:49.140> he's<00:03:49.290> a

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
say my horse a little bit because he's a

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.350 
say my horse a little bit because he's a
little<00:03:49.890> bit<00:03:50.010> aggressive<00:03:50.220> cross<00:03:51.180> country

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
little bit aggressive cross country

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.750 
little bit aggressive cross country
right<00:03:52.019> and<00:03:52.230> I<00:03:52.290> think<00:03:52.590> it'll<00:03:53.160> suit<00:03:53.430> a<00:03:53.519> bold

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
right and I think it'll suit a bold

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.440 
right and I think it'll suit a bold
horse<00:03:54.060> that<00:03:54.299> wants<00:03:54.510> to<00:03:54.600> attack<00:03:54.900> the<00:03:55.049> fee

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
horse that wants to attack the fee

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.780 
horse that wants to attack the fee
just<00:03:56.020> just<00:03:56.830> back<00:03:57.010> them<00:03:57.129> off<00:03:57.250> a<00:03:57.370> little<00:03:57.520> bit<00:03:57.730> so

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
just just back them off a little bit so

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.290 
just just back them off a little bit so
yeah<00:03:58.950> yeah<00:03:59.950> it's<00:04:00.160> it's<00:04:00.430> real<00:04:00.640> tough<00:04:00.849> that<00:04:01.120> make

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:01.300 
yeah yeah it's it's real tough that make

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.860 
yeah yeah it's it's real tough that make
no<00:04:01.450> mistake<00:04:01.840> it<00:04:02.019> when<00:04:02.200> in<00:04:02.860> deep<00:04:03.099> water<00:04:03.370> here<00:04:03.870> so
