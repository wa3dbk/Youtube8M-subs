00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Hello and welcome to the whisky channel!

00:00:04.001 --> 00:00:06.001
Today, we're going
to do a battle

00:00:06.002 --> 00:00:08.002
between two whiskies:

00:00:08.003 --> 00:00:10.003
Chivas Regal 18 year

00:00:10.004 --> 00:00:12.004
- everybody has heard
of this one-

00:00:12.005 --> 00:00:14.005
and Glenmorangie Signet,

00:00:14.006 --> 00:00:16.006
which is kinda
Glenmorangie's jewel.

00:00:23.007 --> 00:00:26.007
Both whiskies can be enjoyed
as an after dinner drink

00:00:26.008 --> 00:00:30.008
That is their common point.

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:33.009
Now, we're going to
assess their differences.

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.010
You can notice that

00:00:37.011 --> 00:00:40.011
I only have 1.5 centiliter left

00:00:40.012 --> 00:00:43.012
of the Signet.
No mistakes allowed here!

00:00:52.013 --> 00:00:54.013
Chivas Regal 18 year
is a blend.

00:00:54.014 --> 00:00:57.014
Some call it a luxury blend.

00:00:57.015 --> 00:00:59.015
A very famous brand.

00:00:59.016 --> 00:01:02.016
On the other hand, you have
the Glenmorangie Signet,

00:01:02.017 --> 00:01:04.017
which is a single malt.

00:01:04.018 --> 00:01:08.018
There has been a drastic selection
of casks to make this whisky

00:01:08.019 --> 00:01:13.019
Roasted malt has been used
to produce this beverage.

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.020
A majority of casks used to produce the
Signet are 30 years old.

00:01:22.021 --> 00:01:25.021
Now, it's not litterally
a 30 year old whisky.

00:01:25.022 --> 00:01:29.022
If it was indeed, it would be
labelled on the bottle

00:01:29.023 --> 00:01:31.023
- which I don't own, by the way!

00:01:32.024 --> 00:01:33.024
Let's go for the nose.

00:01:35.025 --> 00:01:37.025
Chivas Regal: caramel,

00:01:37.026 --> 00:01:40.026
presence of milk chocolate
- discreet, but it's there-

00:01:40.027 --> 00:01:42.027
Tobacco,

00:01:42.028 --> 00:01:44.028
Dry wood.

00:01:44.029 --> 00:01:48.029
Wood is a taste that I really
love to have in a whisky!

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.030
As far as the Signet is concerned,

00:01:52.031 --> 00:01:54.031
we have a much more intense nose.

00:01:54.032 --> 00:01:58.032
Coffee. Bourbon-like.

00:01:58.033 --> 00:02:01.033
Creme brulee, a little bit overcooked.

00:02:04.034 --> 00:02:05.034
On the palate,

00:02:12.035 --> 00:02:13.035
orange peel,

00:02:13.036 --> 00:02:16.036
a creamy texture,

00:02:16.037 --> 00:02:18.037
like in any good
after-dinner drink.

00:02:18.038 --> 00:02:20.038
Long peppery finish.

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:24.039
I'm going quickly for the Signet but,

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.040
if you're tasting several
whiskies in a row

00:02:28.041 --> 00:02:30.041
take the time to
rinse your mouth out

00:02:30.042 --> 00:02:31.042
between each whisky

00:02:31.043 --> 00:02:33.043
in order to get rid of

00:02:33.044 --> 00:02:36.044
the previous flavours.

00:02:36.045 --> 00:02:38.045
Drink to rehydrate.

00:02:38.046 --> 00:02:40.046
Alcohol dehydrates a lot.

00:02:46.047 --> 00:02:48.047
Much more intense mouthfeel.

00:02:50.048 --> 00:02:52.048
Now these don't quite play
in the same field.

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:55.049
The Signet is bottled at 46% ABV

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.050
whereas the Chivas is bottled at 40% ABV.

00:02:57.051 --> 00:02:58.051
Generally speaking,

00:02:58.052 --> 00:02:59.052
the higher the degree of alcohol,

00:02:59.053 --> 00:03:00.053
the more intense the flavours are.

00:03:00.054 --> 00:03:01.054
So, according to this,

00:03:01.055 --> 00:03:05.055
the game is a little bit unfair

00:03:05.056 --> 00:03:08.056
On the finish, chocolate, spices,

00:03:08.057 --> 00:03:10.057
a sweet orange jam

00:03:10.058 --> 00:03:12.058
(not marmalade,
no bitterness in here)

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:16.059
You really have this sweet taste of orange.

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.060
A long time after this,

00:03:18.061 --> 00:03:19.061
at the end of this
very long finish,

00:03:19.062 --> 00:03:22.062
you can taste this incense smoke.

00:03:22.063 --> 00:03:24.063
This is very special.

00:03:26.064 --> 00:03:28.064
Both whiskies are very good.

00:03:28.065 --> 00:03:29.065
By hearing me,

00:03:29.066 --> 00:03:33.066
you're getting to understand
that the Signet is a cut above.

00:03:33.067 --> 00:03:34.067
Now,

00:03:34.068 --> 00:03:35.068
an indication for you guys

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:36.069
who are willing

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:37.070
to select a bottle

00:03:37.071 --> 00:03:39.071
between these two.

00:03:40.072 --> 00:03:44.072
The Chivas Regal 18 year
is to be found almost everywhere

00:03:44.073 --> 00:03:45.073
around 45€.

00:03:46.074 --> 00:03:48.074
Whereas the Glenmorangie Signet

00:03:48.075 --> 00:03:50.075
is sold at the price of
135€!

00:03:52.076 --> 00:03:54.076
This is three times as expensive!

00:03:54.077 --> 00:03:57.077
Is this three times as good?
I'm not sure.

00:03:57.078 --> 00:03:59.078
This is why I don't give whiskies a mark

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:00.079
in my videos.

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:04.080
Now you understand
why it is pointless.

00:04:04.081 --> 00:04:08.081
I'm supposed to give the Signet
a better mark

00:04:08.082 --> 00:04:12.082
because it tastes better and the
sensations are increased ten fold

00:04:12.083 --> 00:04:15.083
(If not tenfold, well they still are bigger

00:04:15.084 --> 00:04:18.084
than when you taste the Chivas Regal)

00:04:19.085 --> 00:04:23.085
Now, if we consider value for money,

00:04:23.086 --> 00:04:26.086
Chivas Regal 18 year
wins the game easily.

00:04:28.087 --> 00:04:32.087
That's the reason you won't see
me give whiskies a mark.

00:04:32.088 --> 00:04:35.088
Now the choice is yours.
It will depend on your budget,

00:04:35.089 --> 00:04:36.089
on your passion,

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.090
and your wish.

00:04:38.091 --> 00:04:40.091
See you on a next episode!
