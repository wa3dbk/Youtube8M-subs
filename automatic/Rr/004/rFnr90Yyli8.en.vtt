00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.790
 hello to all, today came another 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.619
 parcel from china 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:20.640
 It cost 6 dollars that's so big 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:22.260
 bag there will be no distance I open it 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:31.109
 very interesting for a long time already nothing 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:34.620
 came inside inside us 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.710
 the one is probably the case where 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:41.300
 already 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:44.610
 packed well yes it's a case for 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:47.270
 phone just now need to understand 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:51.829
 for which phone 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:56.149
 packed in the park and clogged 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:59.129
 here, by the way, there may be nothing, but then 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:01.219
 The seller and put in can see some 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.739
 I do not know what it is 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:06.540
 visible simple advertising we put to 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:12.590
 more than all the rest is nothing in this 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:20.729
 package and it went for today 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:21.360
 This case is waterproof for galaxy s 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.090
 3 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.689
 here so also he still fits galaxy s 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:30.390
 5 I donâ€™t know if galaxy fits 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.939
 Sorry for the fourth galaxy s 4 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.880
 Well, I do not know whether it is suitable or galaxy s5 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:38.250
 he has such a case 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.689
 stop me now for now try 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.350
 put on the phone 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:46.049
 so I figured out that myself in general 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:49.170
 represents this case here 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:53.399
 plug plug for the camera has 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:56.939
 plug for the speaker also for the input 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:58.049
 charging the blame by the way that's what's more to me 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.140
 just did not like 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:04.680
 water can seep through here 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.299
 hole for the speaker and here through it 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:10.979
 hole too so what 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:15.150
 Basically, but swimming 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:18.360
 With this case, I did not and show you how 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:22.379
 inserted means the phone needs 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:30.049
 put in this case know what's here 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:30.049
 squeeze better here and 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.940
 put it put this thing up 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:52.870
 there are plugs attached very 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:58.580
 well as about the responsiveness 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:03:00.860
 phone in this case means phone 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.230
 turns on these buttons work here 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:08.230
 there is a speaker connector like this 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:12.709
 It opens and closes and that's all 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:16.550
 this is a charging connector then beaten for me 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:21.800
 also open well wanted to close 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:26.959
 Ivan harder here are also open connector 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:31.730
 for speaker for microphone and for 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:35.360
 speakers and the camera is also closed 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:38.060
 like this opens with a flash think 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:41.530
 that here after a while this thing 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.530
 can just just come off 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:48.560
 I can only say about responsiveness 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:54.500
 okay speakers for some reason now 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:59.470
 work may need not from the dynamics 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:59.470
 operate and the power button 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:06.430
 everything works too 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:09.220
 the only thing that is inconvenient to press here 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:12.489
 on the bottom buttons of the ruble button 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:18.850
 adjustment all the same here is the edge she 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:23.919
 prevents from pressing these buttons also 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:26.639
 camera works well with see how 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:26.639
 the camera is working 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:36.180
 Here is the principle can normally shoot with and 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:39.449
 here it is possible so lower the only thing 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:42.289
 This thing may interfere with the flash so 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:48.090
 everything works well good cover 

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:49.770
 those who often encounter water or 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.849
 Happened such that already drowned their 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:53.580
 phones principle 

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:57.539
 one of the cheapest and good covers 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:05:01.490
 so I advise everyone to all everything to everything 

00:04:57.539 --> 00:05:01.490
 good bye subscribe
