00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.359 
necessarily the tanks haven't been off
but<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.909> bike<00:01:09.119> itself<00:01:09.360> has<00:01:09.810> never<00:01:10.020> been

but the bike itself has never been
disassembled

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.200 

has<00:01:14.610> never<00:01:14.820> happened<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:16.250> with<00:01:17.250> any<00:01:17.520> luck<00:01:17.549> I

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
has never happened and with any luck I

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.410 
has never happened and with any luck I
won't<00:01:18.960> be<00:01:19.549> disassembling<00:01:20.549> this<00:01:20.820> one<00:01:21.030> down<00:01:21.240> to

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
won't be disassembling this one down to

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.469 
won't be disassembling this one down to
the<00:01:21.510> very<00:01:21.659> right<00:01:22.490> if<00:01:23.490> possible<00:01:24.240> it<00:01:24.450> should

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
the very right if possible it should

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.480 
the very right if possible it should
stay<00:01:24.930> together<00:01:24.990> as<00:01:25.799> it<00:01:26.670> is<00:01:28.190> because<00:01:29.190> of<00:01:29.220> the

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
stay together as it is because of the

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.460 
stay together as it is because of the
historical<00:01:29.909> significance<00:01:30.360> of<00:01:31.080> this

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
historical significance of this

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.359 
historical significance of this

word water everything I do so we got 76

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:11.720 
word water everything I do so we got 76
points<00:02:04.890> on<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.220> bottom<00:02:10.340> sometimes<00:02:11.340> they<00:02:11.700> need

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
points on the bottom sometimes they need

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:19.420 
points on the bottom sometimes they need
a<00:02:11.880> screwdriver<00:02:12.209> for<00:02:13.019> this<00:02:13.230> and<00:02:13.560> sometimes<00:02:14.130> not
