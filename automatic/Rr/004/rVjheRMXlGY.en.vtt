00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
little 13 page issues which are then

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.460 
little 13 page issues which are then
collected<00:01:09.090> up<00:01:09.299> into<00:01:09.479> in<00:01:09.600> two<00:01:09.780> volumes<00:01:10.290> of

they're drawing the mug or the thing is

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.840 
they're drawing the mug or the thing is
a<00:01:17.880> sort<00:01:18.270> of<00:01:18.299> issue<00:01:18.509> legs<00:01:19.280> you<00:01:20.280> know<00:01:20.340> the

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
a sort of issue legs you know the

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.060 
a sort of issue legs you know the
stopping<00:01:21.180> point<00:01:21.330> for<00:01:21.479> a<00:01:21.630> manga<00:01:22.110> volume<00:01:22.890> is

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
stopping point for a manga volume is

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.219 
stopping point for a manga volume is
almost<00:01:23.280> arbitrary<00:01:23.549> for<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.509> lot<00:01:24.600> of<00:01:24.689> shows<00:01:24.930> a

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
almost arbitrary for a lot of shows a

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.280 
almost arbitrary for a lot of shows a
lot<00:01:25.830> of<00:01:25.920> love<00:01:26.070> series<00:01:26.430> so<00:01:26.869> the<00:01:27.869> question

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
lot of love series so the question

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.770 
lot of love series so the question
becomes<00:01:29.130> when<00:01:29.610> you<00:01:29.700> move<00:01:29.909> it<00:01:30.030> like<00:01:30.210> novels

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
becomes when you move it like novels

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.590 
becomes when you move it like novels
that's<00:01:31.229> a<00:01:31.350> novel<00:01:31.590> beginning<00:01:32.369> middle<00:01:32.640> end<00:01:32.970> now

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
that's a novel beginning middle end now

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.120 
that's a novel beginning middle end now
