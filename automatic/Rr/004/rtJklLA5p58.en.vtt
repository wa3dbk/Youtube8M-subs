00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:10.349
 with a hand sign of power novena 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:17.690
 makes them a single site 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:17.690
 the love between tropical goods 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.359
 Hi, I 'm Alice and today I'm going to 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.329
 teach a way that the truth is 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.850
 makes me super pretty is similar to the 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.890
 that my boyfriend gave me the truth this is 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.440
 to save the cards the cards that 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.680
 they see you is to have them in a place 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.489
 unique and special then I taught them 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.489
 how to do this 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:54.650
 Is a card or a file like 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:58.110
 you can use it then I hope 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:59.910
 like it and we started 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:03.500
 what we are going to need is going to be 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:07.240
 cardboards of one or several colors 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:12.440
 this liquid silicone or any receipt 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:16.670
 strong scissors a pencil a ruler and 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:20.290
 optional velcro we can also use 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.290
 anything to decorate 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:25.090
 The first thing we are going to do is decide 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:30.040
 how big do we want our 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:34.210
 filing cabinet or what will go inside it 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:37.120
 so, for example, I want it from 16 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:40.930
 x 13 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:43.260
 after that I will decide what part 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.380
 I want 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:48.360
 is going to be a rectangle in my then 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:52.280
 this is going to be 16 and this is going to be 13 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:55.510
 I'm going to add 3 centimeters 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.510
 on each side 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:11.060
 so this is pretty much an example 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:14.810
 and I'm going to cut from here to 4 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:17.210
 centimeters and from here here other 4 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:21.940
 centimeters 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:21.940
 then we will have something left 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.239
 as a tea 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:34.880
 we do this 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.880
 on a cardboard 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:41.840
 come I already have my figure 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.680
 here is part measures 3 and the centimeter 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:47.939
 What I put 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:49.400
 this measures 3 equal here 3 and the centimeter 

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:55.220
 what I cut 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:57.980
 and in me it would be my base of 16 x 13 now 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:01.459
 what we are going to do, you are going to do everything 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:03.250
 this is the same on all the cardboard or 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:05.799
 the cards that we want to remember 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:09.700
 It depends on the leaves that we want 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:12.090
 remember that it is 2 forming a space 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.190
 since we cover it in our different 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:18.300
 cardboards 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:22.380
 what we are going to do now is going to be 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:26.940
 mark each centimeter on each side 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:29.240
 from here to here and from here to here and from 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.240
 above 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:55.570
 both back and forward 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:02.440
 since we have our points marked 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:04.989
 what we are going to do is for the part of 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:07.420
 this line in the third point of the 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:09.840
 three centimeters we are going to bend towards 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.840
 in 

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:19.870
 in these ways 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:24.720
 and then from the back 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:24.720
 let's bend to the first centimeter 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:45.300
 then on the opposite side we doubled 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.300
 to the half 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:57.509
 thus staying an accordion 

00:04:57.569 --> 00:05:02.689
 the same thing we do with these two sides
