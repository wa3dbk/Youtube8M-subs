how like it works order I wouldn't say
I'm<00:00:21.120> the<00:00:21.240> best<00:00:21.450> this<00:00:21.780> but<00:00:22.200> I<00:00:22.230> will<00:00:22.620> try<00:00:22.940> because

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:23.940 
I'm the best this but I will try because

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:30.620 
I'm the best this but I will try because
I<00:00:24.210> came<00:00:24.650> at<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:25.860> most<00:00:26.100> work<00:00:28.010> for<00:00:29.360> the<00:00:30.360> first

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
I came at the most work for the first

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.649 
I came at the most work for the first
page<00:00:30.930> on<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.440> instructions<00:00:32.030> there's<00:00:35.659> be

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:36.659 
page on the instructions there's be

00:00:36.659 --> 00:00:39.319 
page on the instructions there's be
right<00:00:37.019> and<00:00:37.319> X<00:00:37.679> so<00:00:38.069> and<00:00:38.370> it<00:00:38.550> says<00:00:38.730> 20<00:00:39.149> different

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
right and X so and it says 20 different

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.270 
right and X so and it says 20 different
slots<00:00:39.719> so<00:00:39.899> that<00:00:40.019> means<00:00:40.230> you<00:00:40.409> there's<00:00:40.859> 20

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
slots so that means you there's 20

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.540 
slots so that means you there's 20
different<00:00:41.600> slots<00:00:42.600> you<00:00:42.839> have<00:00:43.289> so<00:00:44.159> if<00:00:44.219> you<00:00:44.339> hit

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
different slots you have so if you hit

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.270 
different slots you have so if you hit
it<00:00:44.579> 15<00:00:45.089> times<00:00:45.120> that's<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.870> 15th<00:00:46.350> slot<00:00:46.829> if<00:00:47.100> you

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
it 15 times that's the 15th slot if you

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.779 
it 15 times that's the 15th slot if you
hit<00:00:47.460> it<00:00:47.899> 20<00:00:48.899> x<00:00:49.139> 20<00:00:49.949> slots<00:00:50.399> ok<00:00:50.899> and<00:00:51.899> then<00:00:52.260> there's

00:00:52.779 --> 00:00:52.789 
hit it 20 x 20 slots ok and then there's

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:57.739 
hit it 20 x 20 slots ok and then there's
quick<00:00:53.789> mod<00:00:54.299> off<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:55.769> on<00:00:56.210> pretty<00:00:57.210> much<00:00:57.389> just

00:00:57.739 --> 00:00:57.749 
quick mod off and on pretty much just

00:00:57.749 --> 00:01:01.129 
quick mod off and on pretty much just
like<00:00:58.699> and<00:00:59.699> just<00:01:00.030> turn<00:01:00.299> off<00:01:00.329> your<00:01:00.629> mod<00:01:00.839> like

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:01.139 
like and just turn off your mod like

00:01:01.139 --> 00:01:08.050 
like and just turn off your mod like
really<00:01:01.469> fast<00:01:01.709> or<00:01:02.039> something<00:01:03.080> and<00:01:04.080> there<00:01:04.440> is

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060

the reset enter game mode selection it's

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.260 
the reset enter game mode selection it's
pretty<00:01:19.200> much<00:01:19.320> all<00:01:19.590> I<00:01:19.619> do<00:01:20.479> this<00:01:21.479> is<00:01:21.840> I<00:01:22.609> go<00:01:23.609> d<00:01:24.000> pad

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
pretty much all I do this is I go d pad

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.539 
pretty much all I do this is I go d pad
right<00:01:24.680> this<00:01:25.680> pump<00:01:26.250> line<00:01:26.460> mw2<00:01:28.039> which<00:01:29.039> is

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
right this pump line mw2 which is

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:35.179 
right this pump line mw2 which is
currently<00:01:29.880> going<00:01:31.039> right<00:01:32.039> now<00:01:32.189> um<00:01:33.799> come<00:01:34.799> on<00:01:34.950> and

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
currently going right now um come on and

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:46.640 
currently going right now um come on and
got<00:01:35.310> to<00:01:35.399> find<00:01:35.609> the<00:01:35.729> instructions<00:01:36.030> here

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:46.650 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:49.139 

there's<00:01:47.650> way<00:01:47.920> too<00:01:47.950> much<00:01:48.220> instructions<00:01:48.909> for

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:49.149 
there's way too much instructions for

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:55.609 
there's way too much instructions for
this<00:01:49.210> controller<00:01:51.390> there<00:01:52.390> we<00:01:52.570> go<00:01:52.750> a<00:01:53.020> condom<00:01:54.540> so

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
this controller there we go a condom so

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.880 
this controller there we go a condom so
modern<00:01:56.619> warfare<00:01:56.770> 3<00:01:57.039> like<00:01:57.759> the<00:01:58.299> mode<00:01:58.509> for<00:01:58.890> all

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
modern warfare 3 like the mode for all

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.029 
modern warfare 3 like the mode for all
that<00:02:00.130> stuff<00:02:00.580> is<00:02:00.789> designed<00:02:01.600> for<00:02:01.690> MW<00:02:02.200> free<00:02:02.530> from

00:02:03.029 --> 00:02:03.039 
that stuff is designed for MW free from

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:05.700 
that stuff is designed for MW free from
modern<00:02:03.310> warfare<00:02:03.460> 3<00:02:03.670> so<00:02:04.539> it<00:02:04.689> works<00:02:04.990> best<00:02:05.320> for<00:02:05.680> a

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
modern warfare 3 so it works best for a

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.690 
modern warfare 3 so it works best for a
modern<00:02:05.890> warfare<00:02:06.100> 3<00:02:06.310> like<00:02:06.880> for<00:02:07.840> that<00:02:08.280> mode<00:02:09.280> it's

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
modern warfare 3 like for that mode it's

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.900 
modern warfare 3 like for that mode it's
not<00:02:09.940> the<00:02:10.119> greatest<00:02:10.239> on<00:02:10.630> FAL<00:02:11.170> so<00:02:11.530> you<00:02:11.590> can<00:02:11.830> use

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
not the greatest on FAL so you can use

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:17.370 
not the greatest on FAL so you can use
the<00:02:13.170> adjustable<00:02:14.170> rapid<00:02:14.590> fire<00:02:14.709> mode<00:02:15.150> um<00:02:16.260> so<00:02:17.260> it

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
the adjustable rapid fire mode um so it

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.880 
the adjustable rapid fire mode um so it
says<00:02:17.590> d<00:02:17.980> left<00:02:18.310> and<00:02:18.760> then<00:02:19.540> RT<00:02:20.049> that's<00:02:20.350> not<00:02:20.620> on

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
says d left and then RT that's not on

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.640 
says d left and then RT that's not on
and<00:02:21.100> off<00:02:21.220> when<00:02:22.090> you<00:02:22.180> pull<00:02:22.450> the<00:02:22.569> trigger<00:02:22.750> the

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
and off when you pull the trigger the

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.789 
and off when you pull the trigger the
fourth<00:02:23.980> LED<00:02:24.519> flash<00:02:25.239> and<00:02:25.630> that's<00:02:25.930> how<00:02:26.110> fast

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:26.799 
fourth LED flash and that's how fast

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:29.580 
fourth LED flash and that's how fast
it's<00:02:27.100> going<00:02:27.160> to<00:02:27.340> shoot<00:02:27.580> and<00:02:28.140> then<00:02:29.140> to<00:02:29.319> turn

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
it's going to shoot and then to turn

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.500 
it's going to shoot and then to turn
that<00:02:29.739> back<00:02:30.010> off<00:02:30.280> if<00:02:30.670> you<00:02:30.970> don't<00:02:31.150> want<00:02:31.299> them

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
that back off if you don't want them

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.009 
that back off if you don't want them
anymore<00:02:31.540> you<00:02:32.350> just<00:02:32.650> keep<00:02:33.250> at<00:02:33.489> left<00:02:33.760> RT<00:02:34.299> then

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:35.019 
anymore you just keep at left RT then

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:39.150 
anymore you just keep at left RT then
there's<00:02:35.200> d-pad<00:02:35.650> left<00:02:35.980> and<00:02:37.019> lt<00:02:38.019> which<00:02:38.799> changes

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
there's d-pad left and lt which changes

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.039 
there's d-pad left and lt which changes
do<00:02:39.370> the<00:02:39.400> exact<00:02:39.790> same<00:02:39.819> thing<00:02:40.680> there's<00:02:41.680> a<00:02:41.830> Kimbo

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:43.049 
do the exact same thing there's a Kimbo

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:48.810 
do the exact same thing there's a Kimbo
LT<00:02:44.049> plus<00:02:44.260> RT<00:02:44.440> plus<00:02:45.180> d<00:02:46.180> left<00:02:46.650> turn<00:02:47.650> it<00:02:47.799> off<00:02:47.950> same

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
LT plus RT plus d left turn it off same

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:52.380 
LT plus RT plus d left turn it off same
thing<00:02:50.040> that's<00:02:51.040> going<00:02:51.250> to<00:02:51.280> take<00:02:51.430> up<00:02:51.609> third<00:02:52.060> and

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
thing that's going to take up third and

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:53.880 
thing that's going to take up third and
fourth<00:02:52.720> led<00:02:53.079> be<00:02:53.290> careful<00:02:53.680> when<00:02:53.769> you're

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
fourth led be careful when you're

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.610 
fourth led be careful when you're
looking<00:02:54.280> because<00:02:54.489> the<00:02:55.120> LEDs<00:02:55.630> will<00:02:55.959> change<00:02:56.320> and

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
looking because the LEDs will change and

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
looking because the LEDs will change and
what<00:02:56.829> not<00:02:56.859> and<00:02:57.510> then<00:02:58.510> there's<00:02:58.810> auto<00:02:59.049> burst

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
what not and then there's auto burst

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.390 
what not and then there's auto burst
which<00:03:00.640> is<00:03:00.970> only<00:03:01.150> it<00:03:01.450> can't<00:03:01.720> do<00:03:02.140> mw3<00:03:02.799> because

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
which is only it can't do mw3 because

00:06:41.469 --> 00:06:41.479 
these because some fun will have

00:06:41.479 --> 00:06:44.510 
these because some fun will have
different<00:06:42.479> meanings<00:06:43.319> and<00:06:43.860> then<00:06:43.979> some<00:06:44.310> will

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:44.520 
different meanings and then some will

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:46.490 
different meanings and then some will
make<00:06:44.699> it<00:06:44.849> better<00:06:45.060> for<00:06:45.389> some<00:06:45.960> could<00:06:46.169> make<00:06:46.349> it

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:46.500 
make it better for some could make it

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:50.360 
make it better for some could make it
worse<00:06:47.539> like<00:06:48.539> it<00:06:48.719> says<00:06:48.930> sometimes<00:06:49.560> making<00:06:50.129> it

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:50.370 
worse like it says sometimes making it

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:54.350 
worse like it says sometimes making it
go<00:06:51.360> more<00:06:51.569> faster<00:06:52.139> or<00:06:52.949> faster<00:06:53.729> rate<00:06:54.030> of<00:06:54.180> fire

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:54.360 
go more faster or faster rate of fire
