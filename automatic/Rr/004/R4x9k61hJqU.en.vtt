00:00:02.249 --> 00:00:06.510
 fish for fish i'll get you 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:09.450
 present all eight novelties 2013 of the 

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:10.830
 catalog the ex a spi their beasts who 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.720
 is called the next 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.760
 that a spin orbec was developed 

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.770
 especially for fishermen 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:19.439
 pike essentially possibly 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:22.970
 wholesale exchanges of big black bass 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:26.640
 and prosperous serving 35 grams 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:28.500
 while in general espinar caps 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.450
 I really and a grain for them 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.040
 rural 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:33.050
 so it's going to be a spin required the 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:36.320
 work estimated to fish a little more 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:39.590
 hollow than the usual screeners we 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.980
 has two big steps the ground effect 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:45.050
 mint is really with a finish 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:48.860
 definition I was going to say to this waste 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:51.800
 3d eyes a very stocked skirt that a 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:54.080
 Arbete spin of 35 grams with a head 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.270
 comma air that will allow him to be 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.680
 nasty goes down so it's disappointing 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.360
 it's in the water I think we're going 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.850
 be able to 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.150
 see him directly at his entrance in 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.150
 the ocean 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:11.579
 these grunts that will be in action 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:14.299
 immediately so special big 

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:14.299
 bites for 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:22.620
 augros expensive big poles for the year 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.940
 hop ice under cicon with the spirit in 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:28.590
 traditional peace is that we were 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:29.850
 confident to preach 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.760
 hardware breakage problems 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.020
 when we arrive on 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.290
 the points are pretty big so there we have 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.540
 wanted to provide them 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:40.320
 really a beautiful butcher is a lure 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:42.300
 who is also fishing for all 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.760
 2d phases without pain the form of 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:47.400
 the head makes sure of szpiner faults 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.590
 and immersed in the water went into 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.000
 position 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.060
 all that is free falling 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.380
 that is, go down to the bottom of 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.909
 these phases there like it's a spin off 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.859
 who will go fishing deep enough 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:00.799
 we do not lose a chance to take a 

00:01:57.859 --> 00:02:02.540
 point would be done lost in the column 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:04.870
 water 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.870
 it's true 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:15.569
 so I will introduce you to his great 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:17.340
 brother the giant crusher well szpiner 2 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:20.599
 of 60 grams it was really done 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.409
 for people tracking specimens 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:24.689
 hervÃ© who is actually what they 

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:26.310
 were tested during 

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:27.989
 several fishing sessions in amazonia 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.139
 on the bar so especially has the years 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:32.159
 sailors did not come to talk to you 

00:02:31.139 --> 00:02:33.780
 it is a fish that is much more 

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:36.209
 seriously much more beefy than the 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.379
 Pike is where we really so 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:40.319
 it has all the features 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:43.200
 of spitters that I just met 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:45.090
 advanced jane crusher so with a head 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.400
 which takes the form of bacon head 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:50.790
 ouanna who sends his carnivorous fish 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:54.659
 of amazonia is pretty aggressive with 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:56.010
 opercules well marked in red 1 

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:56.540
 to have a signal without the level of 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.629
 the head 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:02.519
 such a silicone skirt very provided a 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:06.090
 Oversized hook and a rod 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:08.129
 stainless steel of 1.6 mm that is to say that we have 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.439
 something that is of the order of 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:13.409
 almost almost unbreakable almost 

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:15.959
 indeformable you can go there if you 

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:18.239
 are fond of big fish leaflets 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:20.189
 big pike especially one is 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:22.470
 not be it number 7 willow leaves and 

00:03:20.189 --> 00:03:26.120
 there is finally something that brews 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.120
 a lot of water and katia really there 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.860
 at the end I have a very large volume of water 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.890
 despite its size its oversized 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:45.220
 big breakdown is trouble with 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:46.750
 big guys like that is that 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:50.570
 we often have trouble equines water 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:54.800
 and this one 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:54.800
 with his shorter superiors 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:59.670
 we notice that it is perfectly 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:01.230
 balanced that gets into action there 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.590
 as soon as it enters the water 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.950
 I do not know 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.310
