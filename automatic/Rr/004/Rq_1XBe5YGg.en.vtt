00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
staying alive because these healers are

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.249 
staying alive because these healers are
no<00:01:53.009> main<00:01:53.479> component<00:01:54.479> but<00:01:54.600> as<00:01:54.720> much<00:01:54.930> as<00:01:54.990> they're

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
no main component but as much as they're

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
the main component if they die I'm still

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.350 
the main component if they die I'm still
okay<00:01:58.979> because<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.310> bulk<00:01:59.490> still<00:01:59.850> have<00:02:00.030> some

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360
