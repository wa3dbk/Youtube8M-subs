00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
making my YouTube video I experimented
and<00:01:10.270> I<00:01:10.420> use<00:01:11.080> the<00:01:11.260> cure<00:01:11.500> do<00:01:11.830> on<00:01:12.190> my<00:01:12.700> scalp<00:01:13.180> to

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 
and I use the cure do on my scalp to

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.020 
and I use the cure do on my scalp to
kind<00:01:13.930> of<00:01:13.990> hydrate<00:01:14.530> and<00:01:14.740> steam<00:01:15.100> myself<00:01:15.730> and

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 
kind of hydrate and steam myself and

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.510 
kind of hydrate and steam myself and
after<00:01:16.630> that<00:01:16.930> I<00:01:17.140> didn't<00:01:17.500> see<00:01:17.650> flakes<00:01:17.980> anymore

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 
after that I didn't see flakes anymore

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.390 
after that I didn't see flakes anymore
like<00:01:18.820> I<00:01:19.210> did<00:01:19.720> it<00:01:19.840> for<00:01:20.020> the<00:01:20.170> video<00:01:20.320> and<00:01:20.950> I<00:01:21.070> did<00:01:21.310> it

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:21.400 
like I did it for the video and I did it

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.580 
like I did it for the video and I did it
because<00:01:21.640> I<00:01:21.760> had<00:01:22.210> a<00:01:22.240> thing<00:01:22.510> I<00:01:22.690> thought<00:01:23.200> it<00:01:23.440> would

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
because I had a thing I thought it would

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.710 
because I had a thing I thought it would
work<00:01:23.860> but<00:01:24.280> I<00:01:24.640> didn't<00:01:25.330> know<00:01:25.390> that<00:01:25.510> it<00:01:25.600> would

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:25.720 
work but I didn't know that it would

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:26.970 
work but I didn't know that it would
work<00:01:25.810> for<00:01:25.870> like<00:01:26.170> weeks<00:01:26.380> and<00:01:26.620> weeks<00:01:26.740> and<00:01:26.920> weeks

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:26.980 
work for like weeks and weeks and weeks

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:29.280 
work for like weeks and weeks and weeks
so<00:01:27.280> I<00:01:27.310> did<00:01:27.730> that<00:01:27.880> video<00:01:28.060> I<00:01:28.570> think<00:01:29.110> in<00:01:29.200> the

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:29.290 
so I did that video I think in the

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.890 
so I did that video I think in the
second<00:01:29.710> week<00:01:29.920> of<00:01:30.130> me<00:01:30.430> having<00:01:30.790> braids<00:01:31.120> and<00:01:31.510> I

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:31.900 
second week of me having braids and I

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.980 
second week of me having braids and I
literally<00:01:32.440> have<00:01:33.250> not<00:01:33.490> seen<00:01:33.820> not<00:01:34.120> one<00:01:34.180> flakes

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 
literally have not seen not one flakes

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.800 
literally have not seen not one flakes
since<00:01:35.800> then<00:01:36.070> and<00:01:36.370> it's<00:01:36.490> because<00:01:36.850> I<00:01:37.060> I<00:01:37.420> haven't

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
since then and it's because I I haven't

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.710 
since then and it's because I I haven't
washed<00:01:38.140> my<00:01:38.470> hair<00:01:38.710> the<00:01:39.550> whole<00:01:39.730> time<00:01:40.090> I<00:01:40.390> didn't

before<00:02:38.380> and<00:02:38.710> I<00:02:38.830> think<00:02:38.890> this<00:02:39.370> is<00:02:39.520> the<00:02:39.640> magic

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
before and I think this is the magic

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.210 
before and I think this is the magic
occur<00:02:40.270> in<00:02:40.480> this<00:02:40.600> product<00:02:40.870> it<00:02:41.500> regulates<00:02:42.070> the

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
occur in this product it regulates the

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.280 
occur in this product it regulates the
production<00:02:42.700> of<00:02:42.850> natural<00:02:43.030> hair<00:02:43.510> oils<00:02:43.930> so<00:02:44.260> I

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
production of natural hair oils so I

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.270 
production of natural hair oils so I
guess<00:02:44.590> the<00:02:45.130> palmarosa<00:02:46.980> increases<00:02:47.980> the

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
guess the palmarosa increases the

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.550 
guess the palmarosa increases the
production<00:02:48.700> of<00:02:48.910> your<00:02:49.000> own<00:02:49.210> hairs<00:02:49.720> oil<00:02:50.110> so

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
production of your own hairs oil so

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.460 
production of your own hairs oil so
maybe<00:02:51.370> that's<00:02:51.730> why<00:02:51.940> my<00:02:51.970> hair<00:02:52.480> hasn't<00:02:53.080> been<00:02:53.200> dry

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
maybe that's why my hair hasn't been dry

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.410 
maybe that's why my hair hasn't been dry
because<00:02:53.890> it's<00:02:54.100> been<00:02:54.280> producing<00:02:54.880> its<00:02:55.000> own<00:02:55.150> oil

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
because it's been producing its own oil

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.170
