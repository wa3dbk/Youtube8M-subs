00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:04.600
 and 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:11.420
 hello everyone with you crazy ted and welcome 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:14.650
 to the next part of minecraft 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:18.560
 mechanisms in this part i will show you 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:20.810
 automatic bonfire and so when pressed 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.779
 on this lever here it is in this way 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:26.570
 lights up and by pressing it again 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:29.330
 naturally goes out immediately want to say 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.130
 the fact that this mechanism is not mine but it 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:33.140
 pretty cool as you can see as always 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:36.500
 takes up very little space very 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:39.350
 compact and it has two so i would 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.630
 said plus the first is as you see the lever 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.670
 already we will bring out that is to you not 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:46.820
 will have the way and transfer it already 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:50.540
 there is a rather convenient side of what 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:54.650
 I do not know how to say that is the conclusion 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:56.120
 no signal has to be done and not yet 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:58.190
 so much plus how much 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:01.490
 probably the originality of this mechanism 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:05.299
 lies in his soul not that is when 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:07.369
 the fire goes out namely here click on 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:11.660
 lever as you can see poured so fireball 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:12.200
 and we have a hellish stone after 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.420
 what 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.580
 by pressing the lever again with us 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.640
 leave so here's the piston shifts this 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:23.659
 hell stone thereby carcassing his site on 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:25.610
 back and it moves in, that is to say 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:28.790
 here is the original mechanism and let's 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:32.750
 move on to its construction I think first 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:35.120
 we begin with a pillar height of 4 blocks 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:39.110
 so here is the table and remove him here 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:41.690
 two blocks further we do a platform 5 on 5 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.480
 so here quickly fast and do 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.640
 quickly 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:48.580
 so as not to waste time 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.290
 do well here and how well 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.020
 since we are using this block 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:55.570
 put the distributor up do not throw away 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.830
 It is the distributor that we naturally fill. 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.590
 his fireballs 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:02.350
 well, and then put on this whole thing 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:06.400
 red there is no hell of a stone 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:12.010
 hell stone now put a lever here 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:15.880
 we take a semi-block floor god we take we put it 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:21.330
 so here and here we put another piece 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:26.530
 redstone hereafter block another block 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:29.050
 repeater like this without delay now 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:32.470
 take the ejector exactly the ejector 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:35.470
 direct it up and put on it 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:37.360
 funnel using shift naturally 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:40.710
 ejector and fill absolutely 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.710
 any one item 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:47.590
 next we need the usual piston 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:50.560
 put it right here and sticky plunger 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:53.530
 here and still here was and here 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.450
 blessings and now i need a comparator i am 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:59.230
 take a comparator here take 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:02.890
 comparator we put the comporator here 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:05.830
 next block a couple more blocks 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:08.430
 2 repeater pieces of redstone this 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:11.680
 maximum delay repeater 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.900
 Now we take this block 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.510
 nice was leave him here on him 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:19.900
 red torch on red torch block still 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:23.470
 one red torch here so here a 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.890
 so sticky plunger and and another sticky 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:28.120
 piston 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:32.100
 fine now we put a block here red 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:36.040
 redstone pieces red dust 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:39.870
 two-click delay repeater yet 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:43.650
 one block red torch on it block 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:45.640
 repeater for maximum delay and 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:49.650
 ordinary piston 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:55.000
 we need to put it here and so here 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:58.000
 fine now all we have put 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.989
 we put here a repeater without 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:05.860
 delays take a block put another block 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:09.570
 here here is a piece of redstone here 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:11.519
 red torch here red torch here 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:16.150
 sticky plunger 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:18.560
 another sticky plunger and another 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:23.570
 sticky plunger 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:25.490
 and repeater and red block 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:28.490
 where we take the red block here we are 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:32.510
 take the red block put here 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:35.960
 red block over here red block and 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:38.180
 and in my opinion this is a matter that should be 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:41.360
 so yes so here it comes out 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:44.960
 in a sly way and here the red block remains 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:47.840
 But in this position, in general, everything is on 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:50.810
 this mechanism is ready in theory should 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:54.050
 I hope to work and so click on 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:58.460
 our lever works fine 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:05:01.610
 the fire is lit we press again and yes 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:05.570
 us all goes out and moves hurray hurray 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:07.340
 cheers all the mechanism is over and on this i 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:08.930
 say goodbye to everyone thanks for watching 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:11.360
