00:00:06.929 --> 00:00:06.939 
we believe technology is at its very

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:10.129 
we believe technology is at its very
best<00:00:07.089> when<00:00:07.930> it's<00:00:08.109> invisible

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
best when it's invisible

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:11.839 
best when it's invisible
when<00:00:10.679> you're<00:00:10.799> conscious<00:00:11.219> only<00:00:11.340> of<00:00:11.670> what

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
when you're conscious only of what

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.180 
when you're conscious only of what
you're<00:00:12.000> doing<00:00:12.330> not<00:00:13.289> the<00:00:13.349> device<00:00:13.769> you're<00:00:13.950> doing

you're doing not the device you're doing

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.630 
you're doing not the device you're doing
it<00:00:14.309> with<00:00:14.490> an<00:00:15.529> iPad<00:00:16.529> is<00:00:16.800> the<00:00:17.220> perfect

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
it with an iPad is the perfect

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.269 
it with an iPad is the perfect
expression<00:00:17.910> of<00:00:18.119> that<00:00:18.509> idea<00:00:18.860> it's<00:00:19.860> just<00:00:20.189> this

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
expression of that idea it's just this

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.640 
expression of that idea it's just this
magical<00:00:20.820> pane<00:00:21.029> of<00:00:21.150> glass<00:00:21.230> it<00:00:22.230> can<00:00:22.380> become

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
magical pane of glass it can become

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.330 
magical pane of glass it can become
anything<00:00:22.950> you<00:00:23.189> want<00:00:23.400> it<00:00:23.490> to<00:00:23.520> be<00:00:23.730> and<00:00:25.340> that's

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
anything you want it to be and that's

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.700 
anything you want it to be and that's
why<00:00:26.550> so<00:00:26.820> many<00:00:26.939> people<00:00:27.210> in<00:00:27.570> so<00:00:28.349> many<00:00:28.410> different

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
why so many people in so many different

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.130 
why so many people in so many different
places<00:00:28.980> are<00:00:29.550> using<00:00:30.540> it<00:00:30.630> for<00:00:30.869> so<00:00:31.079> many

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
places are using it for so many

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.440 
places are using it for so many
different<00:00:31.320> things<00:00:32.149> it's<00:00:33.149> a<00:00:33.270> more<00:00:33.420> personal

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
different things it's a more personal

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.780 
different things it's a more personal
experience<00:00:34.379> with<00:00:34.559> technology<00:00:35.129> and<00:00:35.370> people

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
experience with technology and people

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.209

separate<00:02:14.350> them<00:02:14.530> from<00:02:14.650> the<00:02:14.830> signals<00:02:15.660> it's<00:02:16.660> a

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
separate them from the signals it's a

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.340 
separate them from the signals it's a
major<00:02:17.050> breakthrough

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
major breakthrough

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.680 
major breakthrough
and<00:02:18.440> it's<00:02:19.070> the<00:02:19.220> key<00:02:19.460> to<00:02:19.790> making<00:02:19.970> the<00:02:20.150> pixels<00:02:20.480> so

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
and it's the key to making the pixels so

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.050 
and it's the key to making the pixels so
small<00:02:21.080> and<00:02:21.320> so<00:02:21.530> close<00:02:21.800> together<00:02:22.190> that<00:02:22.460> the

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
small and so close together that the

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.330 
small and so close together that the
human<00:02:23.390> eye<00:02:23.450> can't<00:02:23.780> even<00:02:23.930> distinguish<00:02:24.380> them<00:02:24.530> so

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
human eye can't even distinguish them so

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.060 
human eye can't even distinguish them so
type<00:02:25.610> looks<00:02:25.880> razor-sharp<00:02:26.660> and<00:02:27.200> you'll<00:02:27.860> see

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
type looks razor-sharp and you'll see

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:29.920
