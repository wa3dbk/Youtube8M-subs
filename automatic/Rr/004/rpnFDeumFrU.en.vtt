screens still working so let's try it

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.399 
screens still working so let's try it
again

00:04:32.399 --> 00:04:32.409 
again

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:35.350 
again
and<00:04:33.409> again<00:04:34.190> the<00:04:34.340> glass<00:04:34.520> broke<00:04:34.880> just<00:04:35.120> a<00:04:35.210> little

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 
and again the glass broke just a little

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.210 
and again the glass broke just a little
bit<00:04:35.539> more<00:04:35.750> but<00:04:36.440> hey<00:04:36.620> it's<00:04:36.770> doing<00:04:36.949> pretty<00:04:36.979> good

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220 
bit more but hey it's doing pretty good

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:38.560 
bit more but hey it's doing pretty good
this<00:04:37.550> part<00:04:37.760> of<00:04:37.820> the<00:04:37.880> screen<00:04:38.030> isn't<00:04:38.210> scratched

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:38.570 
this part of the screen isn't scratched

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:42.670 
this part of the screen isn't scratched
or<00:04:38.889> cracked<00:04:39.889> yet<00:04:40.070> see<00:04:40.310> what<00:04:40.340> happens<00:04:41.680> and

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:42.680 
or cracked yet see what happens and

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:48.850 
or cracked yet see what happens and
again<00:04:43.120> and<00:04:44.120> again<00:04:44.780> and<00:04:45.789> again<00:04:47.409> and<00:04:48.409> I<00:04:48.560> guess

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:48.860 
again and again and again and I guess

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.730 
again and again and again and I guess
all<00:04:49.070> I<00:04:49.099> mean<00:04:49.400> I<00:04:49.720> hit<00:04:50.720> that<00:04:50.900> thing<00:04:51.050> really<00:04:51.470> hard

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:51.740

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.080 
impressed by how Apple designs iPhone I

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.779 
impressed by how Apple designs iPhone I
mean<00:04:57.259> like<00:04:57.620> I<00:04:57.680> said<00:04:57.740> the<00:04:58.070> scratch<00:04:58.460> started

00:04:58.779 --> 00:04:58.789 
mean like I said the scratch started

00:04:58.789 --> 00:04:59.950 
mean like I said the scratch started
with<00:04:58.880> the<00:04:58.970> drop<00:04:59.270> test<00:04:59.419> that<00:04:59.599> I<00:04:59.630> did<00:04:59.690> the<00:04:59.870> other

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 
with the drop test that I did the other

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:00.339 
with the drop test that I did the other
day

00:05:00.339 --> 00:05:00.349 
day

00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:02.529 
day
over<00:05:00.770> here<00:05:01.009> it<00:05:01.759> kind<00:05:01.940> of<00:05:01.970> spread<00:05:02.210> when<00:05:02.360> it<00:05:02.450> did

00:05:02.529 --> 00:05:02.539 
over here it kind of spread when it did

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:04.149 
over here it kind of spread when it did
the<00:05:02.599> hammer<00:05:02.810> on<00:05:02.960> this<00:05:03.289> area<00:05:03.560> obviously<00:05:03.800> it's

00:05:04.149 --> 00:05:04.159 
the hammer on this area obviously it's

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:05.890 
the hammer on this area obviously it's
gonna<00:05:04.250> be<00:05:04.370> easier<00:05:04.729> to<00:05:04.820> spread<00:05:05.060> so<00:05:05.599> maybe<00:05:05.779> if

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:05.900 
gonna be easier to spread so maybe if

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:07.629 
gonna be easier to spread so maybe if
it's<00:05:06.080> a<00:05:06.169> brand<00:05:06.349> new<00:05:06.500> iPhone<00:05:06.680> it<00:05:06.979> wouldn't<00:05:07.310> of

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:07.639 
it's a brand new iPhone it wouldn't of

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:09.580 
it's a brand new iPhone it wouldn't of
done<00:05:07.789> you<00:05:08.180> know<00:05:08.270> I<00:05:08.300> was<00:05:08.449> bad<00:05:08.629> right<00:05:08.870> here<00:05:09.110> let's

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:09.590 
done you know I was bad right here let's

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:11.110 
done you know I was bad right here let's
go<00:05:09.710> ahead<00:05:09.740> and<00:05:10.129> see<00:05:10.819> if<00:05:10.849> I<00:05:10.939> could<00:05:11.090> actually

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:11.120 
go ahead and see if I could actually

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:17.200 
go ahead and see if I could actually
break<00:05:11.840> this<00:05:12.050> thing<00:05:15.580> all<00:05:16.580> right<00:05:16.669> so<00:05:16.789> I<00:05:16.849> practice

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:17.210 
break this thing all right so I practice

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:19.600 
break this thing all right so I practice
a<00:05:17.240> little<00:05:17.360> bit<00:05:17.509> more<00:05:18.069> what<00:05:19.069> the<00:05:19.219> display<00:05:19.550> is

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:19.610 
a little bit more what the display is

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:20.649 
a little bit more what the display is
still<00:05:19.819> working<00:05:19.999> all<00:05:20.270> right<00:05:20.300> you<00:05:20.449> know<00:05:20.539> what

00:05:20.649 --> 00:05:20.659 
still working all right you know what

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:22.719 
still working all right you know what
I'll<00:05:20.900> just<00:05:21.169> save<00:05:21.830> that<00:05:21.860> to<00:05:22.189> it<00:05:22.249> for<00:05:22.490> another

00:05:22.719 --> 00:05:22.729 
I'll just save that to it for another

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:25.390 
I'll just save that to it for another
video<00:05:22.969> I<00:05:23.120> guess<00:05:23.270> because<00:05:23.960> it<00:05:24.949> doesn't<00:05:25.219> want<00:05:25.340> to

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:25.400 
video I guess because it doesn't want to

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:26.769 
video I guess because it doesn't want to
crack<00:05:25.580> I<00:05:25.610> mean<00:05:25.789> the<00:05:25.849> display<00:05:26.150> won't<00:05:26.539> stop

00:05:26.769 --> 00:05:26.779 
crack I mean the display won't stop

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:28.420 
crack I mean the display won't stop
working<00:05:27.139> so<00:05:27.379> that's<00:05:27.949> pretty<00:05:28.219> impressive

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:28.430 
working so that's pretty impressive

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:29.950 
working so that's pretty impressive
anyway<00:05:28.879> that's<00:05:29.029> pretty<00:05:29.389> much<00:05:29.509> it<00:05:29.659> for<00:05:29.779> me<00:05:29.900> in

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:29.960 
anyway that's pretty much it for me in

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:31.540 
anyway that's pretty much it for me in
this<00:05:30.050> video<00:05:30.289> I<00:05:30.529> know<00:05:30.860> it's<00:05:31.039> kind<00:05:31.279> of<00:05:31.340> hard<00:05:31.520> to

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:31.550 
this video I know it's kind of hard to
