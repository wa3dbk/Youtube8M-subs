oil<00:00:18.200> is<00:00:18.380> a<00:00:18.560> rich<00:00:19.009> source<00:00:19.340> of<00:00:19.540> MCTS<00:00:20.540> what<00:00:21.290> about

00:00:21.749 --> 00:00:21.759 
oil is a rich source of MCTS what about

medium chain triglycerides that's these

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.909 
medium chain triglycerides that's these
that<00:00:26.300> are<00:00:26.329> responsible<00:00:26.989> for<00:00:27.169> enhancing

two<00:00:30.500> studies<00:00:31.090> first<00:00:32.090> one<00:00:32.360> is<00:00:32.570> a<00:00:32.599> study<00:00:32.899> on<00:00:33.079> rats

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:33.710 
two studies first one is a study on rats

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.029 
two studies first one is a study on rats
they<00:00:34.610> gave<00:00:34.790> them<00:00:35.000> MCTS<00:00:35.780> and<00:00:36.500> what<00:00:36.649> did<00:00:36.769> it<00:00:36.890> do

00:00:37.029 --> 00:00:37.039 
they gave them MCTS and what did it do

00:00:37.039 --> 00:00:39.910 
they gave them MCTS and what did it do
it<00:00:37.280> enhanced<00:00:38.149> thermogenesis<00:00:38.929> what's<00:00:39.620> that

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
it enhanced thermogenesis what's that

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.040 
it enhanced thermogenesis what's that
heat<00:00:40.579> production<00:00:41.000> now<00:00:41.719> this<00:00:41.870> goes

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050 
heat production now this goes

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:43.540 
heat production now this goes
hand-in-hand<00:00:42.440> with<00:00:42.620> an<00:00:42.980> increase<00:00:43.309> in

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.550 
hand-in-hand with an increase in

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.209 
hand-in-hand with an increase in
metabolism<00:00:43.989> now<00:00:44.989> the<00:00:45.050> next<00:00:45.320> study<00:00:45.500> is<00:00:45.649> a<00:00:45.679> human

00:00:46.209 --> 00:00:46.219 
metabolism now the next study is a human

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:48.400 
metabolism now the next study is a human
study<00:00:46.429> now<00:00:47.359> they've<00:00:47.809> got<00:00:47.899> two<00:00:48.050> groups<00:00:48.199> of

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:48.410 
study now they've got two groups of

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.369 
study now they've got two groups of
people<00:00:48.589> they<00:00:49.100> gave<00:00:49.249> one<00:00:49.489> group<00:00:49.730> MCTS<00:00:50.690> and<00:00:51.199> they

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:51.379 
people they gave one group MCTS and they

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:53.319 
people they gave one group MCTS and they
gave<00:00:51.589> the<00:00:51.739> other<00:00:51.949> group<00:00:52.249> long-chain<00:00:52.999> fatty

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:53.329 
gave the other group long-chain fatty

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:55.360 
gave the other group long-chain fatty
acids<00:00:53.809> these<00:00:54.230> are<00:00:54.410> much<00:00:54.530> longer<00:00:54.769> chains<00:00:55.219> of

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
acids these are much longer chains of

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:56.889 
acids these are much longer chains of
fats<00:00:55.609> than<00:00:55.999> MCTS

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:56.899 
fats than MCTS

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:59.470 
fats than MCTS
what<00:00:57.559> did<00:00:57.739> they<00:00:57.829> find<00:00:58.399> well<00:00:58.909> the<00:00:59.149> people<00:00:59.300> who

00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480 
what did they find well the people who

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:00.849 
what did they find well the people who
took<00:00:59.629> MCTS

00:01:00.849 --> 00:01:00.859 
took MCTS

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:03.520 
took MCTS
had<00:01:01.190> much<00:01:01.550> better<00:01:01.820> fat<00:01:02.269> loss<00:01:02.539> than<00:01:03.230> the<00:01:03.350> people

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
had much better fat loss than the people

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.270 
had much better fat loss than the people
on<00:01:03.739> these<00:01:03.859> longer<00:01:04.220> chains<00:01:04.489> of<00:01:04.670> fats<00:01:05.320> so<00:01:06.320> what

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
on these longer chains of fats so what

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.300 
on these longer chains of fats so what
does<00:01:07.430> coconut<00:01:07.880> I'll<00:01:07.970> do<00:01:08.180> how<00:01:08.360> does<00:01:08.540> it<00:01:08.659> work

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
does coconut I'll do how does it work

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.370 
does coconut I'll do how does it work
well<00:01:10.310> but<00:01:10.909> a<00:01:11.030> physiological<00:01:11.659> level<00:01:11.689> is<00:01:12.020> seemed

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
well but a physiological level is seemed

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.440 
well but a physiological level is seemed
to<00:01:12.680> sort<00:01:13.040> of<00:01:13.100> take<00:01:13.310> a<00:01:13.340> shortcut<00:01:13.880> route

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
to sort of take a shortcut route

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.539 
to sort of take a shortcut route
compared<00:01:15.110> to<00:01:15.229> other<00:01:15.409> longer<00:01:15.890> chains<00:01:16.159> of<00:01:16.310> fats

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:16.549 
compared to other longer chains of fats

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:19.420 
compared to other longer chains of fats
it<00:01:17.299> gets<00:01:17.509> digested<00:01:17.720> very<00:01:18.409> easily<00:01:18.619> it<00:01:19.280> gets

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
it gets digested very easily it gets

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.910 
it gets digested very easily it gets
absorbed<00:01:19.640> very<00:01:20.210> easily<00:01:20.540> and<00:01:20.930> when<00:01:21.590> it<00:01:21.680> comes

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
absorbed very easily and when it comes

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.459 
absorbed very easily and when it comes
to<00:01:22.280> getting<00:01:22.820> into<00:01:23.000> our<00:01:23.270> cells<00:01:23.689> it<00:01:24.049> seems<00:01:24.320> to

00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:24.469 
to getting into our cells it seems to

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:27.069 
to getting into our cells it seems to
get<00:01:24.649> in<00:01:24.770> there<00:01:24.979> nice<00:01:25.159> and<00:01:25.189> easy<00:01:25.490> and<00:01:26.000> really<00:01:26.869> it

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:27.079 
get in there nice and easy and really it

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:30.160 
get in there nice and easy and really it
goes<00:01:27.290> straight<00:01:27.829> into<00:01:28.340> the<00:01:28.610> energy<00:01:29.170> producing

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
goes straight into the energy producing

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:31.450 
goes straight into the energy producing
part<00:01:30.439> of<00:01:30.590> the<00:01:30.649> cell<00:01:30.890> called<00:01:31.189> the<00:01:31.280> mitochondria

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
part of the cell called the mitochondria

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.270 
part of the cell called the mitochondria
just<00:01:32.270> slips<00:01:32.630> in<00:01:32.869> there<00:01:33.110> and<00:01:33.320> it<00:01:33.409> ramps<00:01:34.130> up

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
just slips in there and it ramps up

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.910 
just slips in there and it ramps up
metabolism<00:01:35.060> so<00:01:35.630> that's<00:01:35.810> the<00:01:36.079> way<00:01:36.229> it<00:01:36.380> works<00:01:36.619> at

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
metabolism so that's the way it works at

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.399 
metabolism so that's the way it works at
a<00:01:37.000> physiological<00:01:38.000> level<00:01:38.240> -<00:01:38.360> and<00:01:38.479> that<00:01:39.289> by

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409 
a physiological level - and that by

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:41.670 
a physiological level - and that by
chemical<00:01:39.979> level<00:01:40.310> I<00:01:40.340> should<00:01:40.549> say<00:01:40.670> to<00:01:40.729> enhance

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:41.680 
chemical level I should say to enhance

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.740 
chemical level I should say to enhance
metabolic<00:01:42.680> function<00:01:43.130> so<00:01:43.820> if<00:01:44.090> you<00:01:44.539> want

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
metabolic function so if you want

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.469 
metabolic function so if you want
improve<00:01:45.560> metabolism<00:01:45.950> if<00:01:46.490> you<00:01:46.579> do<00:01:46.700> sports<00:01:47.149> or

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
improve metabolism if you do sports or

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:48.910 
improve metabolism if you do sports or
go<00:01:47.630> to<00:01:47.689> the<00:01:47.899> gym<00:01:47.930> that's<00:01:48.350> great

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
go to the gym that's great

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.950 
go to the gym that's great
but<00:01:49.159> also<00:01:49.280> if<00:01:49.549> you<00:01:49.670> want<00:01:49.820> to<00:01:49.939> improve<00:01:50.299> fat<00:01:50.750> loss

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
but also if you want to improve fat loss

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.950 
but also if you want to improve fat loss
then<00:01:51.320> I<00:01:51.409> recommend<00:01:51.979> you<00:01:52.219> make<00:01:52.430> coconut<00:01:52.939> oil<00:01:53.390> a

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
then I recommend you make coconut oil a

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.099 
then I recommend you make coconut oil a
daily<00:01:54.680> part<00:01:54.950> of<00:01:55.039> your<00:01:55.579> diet<00:01:55.909> thank<00:01:56.810> you<00:01:56.930> for

00:01:57.099 --> 00:01:57.109 
daily part of your diet thank you for

00:01:57.109 --> 00:02:00.100 
daily part of your diet thank you for
listening<00:01:57.229> goodbye
