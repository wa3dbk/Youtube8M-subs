building the frame this is taking the
two<00:00:33.719> which<00:00:34.020> we<00:00:34.170> have<00:00:34.260> imported<00:00:34.770> from<00:00:34.890> Japan

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
two which we have imported from Japan

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.119 
two which we have imported from Japan
and<00:00:35.719> bending<00:00:36.719> it<00:00:36.809> to<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:37.020> correct<00:00:37.380> shape<00:00:37.649> for

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
and bending it to the correct shape for

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.220 
and bending it to the correct shape for
use<00:00:38.309> in<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.670> welding<00:00:39.450> and<00:00:39.570> assembly<00:00:40.020> of<00:00:40.050> the

use in the welding and assembly of the

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.590 
use in the welding and assembly of the
frame<00:00:40.530> later<00:00:40.879> after<00:00:41.879> everything<00:00:42.270> in<00:00:42.390> this

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
frame later after everything in this

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.090 
frame later after everything in this
area<00:00:43.020> has<00:00:43.290> gone<00:00:43.559> through<00:00:43.739> what<00:00:43.800> we<00:00:44.070> call

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
area has gone through what we call

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.779 
area has gone through what we call
fabrication<00:00:45.090> we<00:00:45.690> find<00:00:46.110> then<00:00:46.260> that<00:00:46.289> we<00:00:46.469> have

00:00:46.779 --> 00:00:46.789 
fabrication we find then that we have

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:49.700 
fabrication we find then that we have
the<00:00:47.789> left<00:00:48.270> to<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.600> right<00:00:48.750> at<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.110> top<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.649> the

the left to the right at the top and the
bottom<00:00:49.890> of<00:00:50.190> a<00:00:50.280> frame<00:00:50.610> so<00:00:51.180> everything<00:00:51.690> that

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
bottom of a frame so everything that

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.020 
bottom of a frame so everything that
we've<00:00:51.960> seen<00:00:52.199> in<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.559> fabrication<00:00:53.430> process

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
we've seen in the fabrication process

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.939 
we've seen in the fabrication process
now<00:00:54.210> is<00:00:54.390> come<00:00:54.660> to<00:00:54.780> completion<00:00:55.110> and<00:00:55.440> we<00:00:55.680> see<00:00:55.829> the

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
now is come to completion and we see the

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.410 
now is come to completion and we see the
parts<00:00:56.219> hanging<00:00:56.399> on<00:00:56.640> these<00:00:56.820> racks<00:00:57.059> the

parts hanging on these racks the
gentleman<00:00:57.660> behind<00:00:58.079> me<00:00:58.170> now<00:00:58.289> are<00:00:58.469> welding

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
gentleman behind me now are welding

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.380 
gentleman behind me now are welding
together<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.309> pieces<00:00:59.489> of<00:00:59.789> the<00:00:59.879> frame<00:01:00.030> they're

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
together the pieces of the frame they're

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.880 
together the pieces of the frame they're
using<00:01:00.690> what's<00:01:00.870> called<00:01:00.960> a<00:01:01.170> welding<00:01:01.530> jig<00:01:01.710> which

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
using what's called a welding jig which

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.039 
using what's called a welding jig which
is<00:01:02.039> like<00:01:02.190> this<00:01:02.340> piece<00:01:03.059> right<00:01:03.270> beside<00:01:03.629> me

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
is like this piece right beside me

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.719 
is like this piece right beside me
it<00:01:04.229> holds<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.559> top<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:05.010> bottom<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.339> left<00:01:05.580> the

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
it holds the top the bottom the left the

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.700 
it holds the top the bottom the left the
right<00:01:06.170> components<00:01:07.170> of<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.320> frame<00:01:07.560> together

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
right components of the frame together

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.289 
right components of the frame together
so<00:01:08.400> that<00:01:08.520> they<00:01:08.610> can<00:01:08.790> make<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.030> appropriate

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
so that they can make the appropriate

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.840 
so that they can make the appropriate
spot<00:01:09.869> welds<00:01:10.350> in<00:01:10.830> order<00:01:11.100> to<00:01:11.189> hold<00:01:11.340> it<00:01:11.460> all<00:01:11.580> into

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
spot welds in order to hold it all into

here from the ATV has been supported by

here from the ATV has been supported by

the<00:03:59.730> assembly<00:04:00.000> line<00:04:00.410> we<00:04:01.410> need<00:04:01.560> some<00:04:01.739> way<00:04:01.860> to

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
the assembly line we need some way to

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.160 
the assembly line we need some way to
get<00:04:02.100> it<00:04:02.250> off<00:04:02.400> of<00:04:02.430> that<00:04:02.610> jig<00:04:03.000> and<00:04:03.239> so<00:04:03.630> we<00:04:03.750> use<00:04:03.900> the

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
get it off of that jig and so we use the

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.050 
get it off of that jig and so we use the
seesaw<00:04:04.620> system<00:04:05.070> here<00:04:05.220> rather<00:04:05.459> than<00:04:05.700> a<00:04:05.730> crane

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
seesaw system here rather than a crane

to<00:04:06.270> lift<00:04:06.420> it<00:04:06.600> on<00:04:07.489> course<00:04:08.489> the<00:04:08.610> engine<00:04:08.760> is

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
to lift it on course the engine is

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.699 
to lift it on course the engine is
operating<00:04:09.150> and<00:04:09.660> exhaust<00:04:09.989> fans<00:04:10.350> are<00:04:10.470> coming

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
operating and exhaust fans are coming

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.380 
operating and exhaust fans are coming
out<00:04:10.800> of<00:04:10.920> the<00:04:10.980> back<00:04:11.160> of<00:04:11.310> the<00:04:11.400> engine<00:04:11.520> so<00:04:11.940> an

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
out of the back of the engine so an

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:15.170 
out of the back of the engine so an
exhaust<00:04:12.860> gas<00:04:13.860> catcher<00:04:14.280> is<00:04:14.489> pumping<00:04:14.910> up<00:04:15.030> now

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
exhaust gas catcher is pumping up now

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.199 
exhaust gas catcher is pumping up now
and<00:04:15.360> this<00:04:15.480> sucks<00:04:16.200> the<00:04:16.380> gas<00:04:16.560> out<00:04:16.859> of<00:04:17.030> the<00:04:18.030> air

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
and this sucks the gas out of the air

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:19.880 
and this sucks the gas out of the air
right<00:04:18.480> there<00:04:18.510> and<00:04:18.959> draws<00:04:19.560> those<00:04:19.709> where<00:04:19.859> a
