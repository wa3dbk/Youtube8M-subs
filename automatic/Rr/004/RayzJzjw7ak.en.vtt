00:00:00.559 --> 00:00:02.340
 ladies and gentlemen i'm glad to welcome you 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:03.999
 part screams 

00:00:03.999 --> 00:00:05.899
 my first video processing 

00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:07.000
 photos 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.660
 and now we have the theme of increasing color 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:10.270
 of objects 

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:12.060
 depending on their significance and 

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:13.339
 remoteness 

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:15.399
 midfield photoshop 

00:00:15.399 --> 00:00:17.169
 and here we see a 

00:00:17.169 --> 00:00:19.970
 means the remnants of the previous part 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:21.039
 that is, additional 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:23.310
 substance adjustments and all four solutions 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.369
 in fact 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:27.230
 having a secret i try to make 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.380
 as long as they need Nikita 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.359
 global photo changes i.e. 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:33.370
 after adding any document 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.510
 but the output of the texts may have to 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.589
 make some changes to 

00:00:37.589 --> 00:00:39.720
 previous processing 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.270
 but as the processing in the program 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.380
 according to the results where it is exactly the same 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:45.840
 in a way 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.000
 are added 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.740
 all new and new processing 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.010
 so 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.110
 so now we have a task 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:55.180
 percent increase the color on this 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:56.140
 Photo 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:57.190
 in fact 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.829
 The colors from the photo are very serious. 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:02.160
 question and very often 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.580
 newbies he adds 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.630
 n photography is a lot of color and than 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.560
 percent why does it look like 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.880
 let's say robots and not always or kutopyugan 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:13.930
 your picture 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.120
 we need to save oao on any 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.020
 Photo 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.280
 its realism how we do it 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.509
 let's create first 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.540
 percent additional 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.830
 but the level that is the mask using 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.870
 which we will separate the percentage 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.060
 and important objects and let's say objects 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:32.070
 foreground 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.400
 from objects and about the rest 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.510
 so i take 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:37.020
 otherwise these poems 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.080
 and in the key in 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.920
 assessment and KAMAZ 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.280
 percent 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.810
 I'm starting to highlight the floor on rates 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.020
 black 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.490
 with all the objects in the foreground 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.799
 in fact it is very much in Ashdod moment 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.060
 allocation of objects radish why and here 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.929
 what were these objects to 

00:01:58.929 --> 00:01:59.750
 us so 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.140
 but in general, their secrecy should 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.539
 be promoted ie 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:05.580
 flew and there subject 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.850
 know here now massively on specific 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.069
 branch photos 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:11.749
 and here are these Christmas trees are actually a tribute 

00:02:11.749 --> 00:02:14.209
 very percentage small distance 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:17.170
 and everything else is further 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.400
 to the percentage of say between us and here these 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.160
 buildings are very 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.790
 serious reservoir percentage of air this 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:25.499
 air 

00:02:25.499 --> 00:02:27.889
 creates and some blueness in the frame and 

00:02:27.889 --> 00:02:30.020
 plus un 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:31.809
 and dulls a few 

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:34.939
 And they themselves always say onopco process 

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:37.399
 these phrases of objects in connection with this 

00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:39.100
 boost n 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.650
 the color in the photo should 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.680
 happen in this way 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:44.100
 there is 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.510
 we must fully apply for 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:47.840
 foreground 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.350
 and partly for the average 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.890
 it is only possible in some 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.929
 degree for far 

00:02:54.929 --> 00:02:57.209
 so how do we do that that is and 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:58.699
 i'm completely black 

00:02:58.699 --> 00:03:00.379
 highlighted foreground 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:03.379
 the second step is the selection of the average 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:06.959
 that is, how we won't do it 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:09.789
 we also work with a brush but we color 

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:12.509
 take 

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:15.299
 but let's say iwk 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:18.299
 30 percent black 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:20.879
 same brush 

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:22.189
 we begin 

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:23.139
 work 

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:24.979
 here are the average plans that is all we can 

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:27.169
 attributed to the average plan 

00:03:27.169 --> 00:03:28.259
 we highlight 

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:30.019
 it and brushes 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:32.959
 so we have osichansky 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:34.309
 on the picture 

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:35.549
 On the photo 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:38.780
 there are 2 or rather 3 areas 

00:03:38.779 --> 00:03:41.879
 the first area is white light on top 

00:03:42.529 --> 00:03:45.409
 black color below 

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:48.409
 and percent 30 ti interest 

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:49.460
 Gray 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:52.460
 he is right here in the middle 

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:55.219
 why no one took 

00:03:55.219 --> 00:03:57.369
 fifty percent because on this 

00:03:57.369 --> 00:03:59.360
 photos we have well 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:00.870
 more plans 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.349
 and I also have money 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:05.209
 to 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:08.639
 also work out chromaticity to in the second 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:11.709
 85 another plan 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:14.079
 let's say such an intermediate between 

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:16.120
 percent average 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.970
 far yes him plans tears in 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.560
 clouds and all that is already micron say 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.240
 in infinity 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.409
 now his 

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:26.409
 color sixty percent 

00:04:27.529 --> 00:04:29.550
 this color 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.330
 stand out and objects that are here 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:34.020
 On this 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.500
 do you remember the plan which is between 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.500
 mean them even 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.559
 in this way 

00:04:42.559 --> 00:04:44.639
 but I think the year they are very neat on 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:46.319
 actually about this 

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:49.650
 I understand why I record video 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.969
 there is no such task 

00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:54.719
 but understand that in any case in Kiev 

00:04:54.719 --> 00:04:56.739
 cascade change color with a brush then you can 

00:04:56.739 --> 00:04:58.369
 restore and all you need 

00:04:58.369 --> 00:05:01.519
 bring more well to highlight 

00:05:01.519 --> 00:05:03.420
 necessary in objects 

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:04.350
 although 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:07.350
 it is clear that in any mask in which 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:08.110
 We are drawing 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:11.030
 we can not blur now show how we 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:14.030
 we will do it 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:16.500
 here is your photo 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.580
 our mask we go out of bed mode mask 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.689
 stands out and all we need 

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:24.069
 just the opposite 

00:05:24.069 --> 00:05:27.180
 this is the percentage of Muscat trick 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:29.639
 masks and can only be identified need now 

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:32.770
 for these seven years anders choose the product and you 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:34.669
 see so that we have voices 

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:35.659
 here's the plan 

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:38.009
 mask we have it assigned 

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:40.080
 that is, one division is assigned to need 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.979
 now create a level using 

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:44.659
 whom we will increase mortality 

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:47.119
 corrective and I really like either 

00:05:47.119 --> 00:05:47.860
 oz 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.310
 he is here we can just raise 

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:52.569
 the color of May is right now we will 

00:05:52.569 --> 00:05:54.500
 do that is video port half step from 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:56.930
 legs and how you see exactly foreground 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:00.650
 Elin becomes very bright and beautiful in 

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:02.710
 less degree it becomes 

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:04.450
 bright on the middle finger 

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:07.690
 quite a bit it gets brighter on 

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:09.550
 rub in the plan 

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:11.819
 and absolutely respect the change not 

00:06:11.819 --> 00:06:14.069
 touch the color of the sky look at that 

00:06:14.069 --> 00:06:17.069
 you are welcome 

00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:20.849
 but this is what I would like to tell you 

00:06:20.849 --> 00:06:23.820
 estimated to increase color 

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:24.719
 and taking into account 

00:06:24.719 --> 00:06:27.719
 and the remoteness of the object of their significance 

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:31.180
 percentage before we go next 

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:31.780
 offended 

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:33.889
 I would like to emphasize again the main 

00:06:33.889 --> 00:06:36.059
 principle so the tool 

00:06:36.059 --> 00:06:38.749
 and that is actually our mask 

00:06:38.749 --> 00:06:41.710
 and we see that with her 

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:43.460
 we have a percentage 

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:45.219
 it is allocated very well 

00:06:45.219 --> 00:06:46.389
 foreground 

00:06:46.389 --> 00:06:50.689
 and a little percentage worse allocated but the plan 

00:06:51.749 --> 00:06:55.129
 slightly worse than the third and absolutely not highlighted 

00:06:55.129 --> 00:06:57.129
 the percentage is not allocated to the sky i.e. osh 

00:06:57.129 --> 00:06:58.759
 is infinity it 

00:06:58.759 --> 00:07:00.800
 allows us to use the tool 

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.789
 increase color 

00:07:02.789 --> 00:07:04.349
 percentage for 

00:07:04.349 --> 00:07:06.580
 Only here these are the objects that is 

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:08.809
 planted degree 

00:07:08.809 --> 00:07:11.339
 spending using tools and brands but 

00:07:11.339 --> 00:07:13.759
 on at my master class you can 

00:07:13.759 --> 00:07:16.969
 find out about at least two again 

00:07:16.969 --> 00:07:18.409
 deme tools 

00:07:18.409 --> 00:07:20.840
 which I myself created using macros 

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:23.090
 who has thought much about the degree 

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:24.370
 increases color 

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:26.759
 taking into account not only their remoteness 

00:07:26.759 --> 00:07:29.189
 but also considering their very color 

00:07:29.189 --> 00:07:31.389
 that is, it is also an important point of his 

00:07:31.389 --> 00:07:34.650
 need to take into account the percentage to raise the light 

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:37.050
 only on color objects a series 

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:39.509
 the object is actually the best not to touch 

00:07:39.509 --> 00:07:42.509
 to some extent this makes the instrument 

00:07:42.509 --> 00:07:43.190
 either nsk 

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:45.540
 that is, take it away it is used 

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:47.610
 I do not use the object of tereshchenko only 

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:49.830
 crit if they start using not immediately 

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:50.740
 appears 

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:52.319
 unhealthy such shades 

00:07:52.319 --> 00:07:54.929
 I just offer a counter arch in general 

00:07:54.929 --> 00:07:56.569
 never get to use 

00:07:56.569 --> 00:07:57.600
 gibbons yes
