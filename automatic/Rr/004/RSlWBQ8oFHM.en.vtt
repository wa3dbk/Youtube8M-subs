to<00:02:08.070> make<00:02:08.280> this<00:02:08.520> one<00:02:09.360> of<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.509> most<00:02:09.720> dynamic

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:10.070 
to make this one of the most dynamic

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:12.950 
to make this one of the most dynamic
social<00:02:11.070> and<00:02:11.490> cultural<00:02:11.940> projects<00:02:12.480> as<00:02:12.600> far<00:02:12.810> as

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
social and cultural projects as far as

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.290 
social and cultural projects as far as
what<00:02:13.680> was<00:02:13.830> involved<00:02:14.130> in<00:02:14.340> Grand<00:02:14.550> Avenue<00:02:14.760> and<00:02:15.180> I

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
what was involved in Grand Avenue and I

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.000 
what was involved in Grand Avenue and I
figured<00:02:15.780> this<00:02:15.900> would<00:02:16.050> end<00:02:16.320> up<00:02:16.440> being<00:02:16.680> the

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
figured this would end up being the

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.330 
figured this would end up being the
great<00:02:17.220> party<00:02:17.670> of<00:02:18.260> a<00:02:19.260> lifetime<00:02:19.709> they<00:02:20.130> would

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
great party of a lifetime they would

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.880 
great party of a lifetime they would
constantly<00:02:21.030> be<00:02:21.209> going<00:02:21.360> on<00:02:21.630> and<00:02:22.200> I<00:02:22.680> think

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
constantly be going on and I think

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.980 
constantly be going on and I think
that's<00:02:23.040> part<00:02:23.400> of<00:02:23.459> the<00:02:23.640> theme<00:02:23.850> of<00:02:24.150> what<00:02:24.840> we'd

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
that's part of the theme of what we'd

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:26.900 
that's part of the theme of what we'd
like<00:02:25.170> to<00:02:25.290> achieve<00:02:25.590> in<00:02:25.830> the<00:02:25.920> plaza<00:02:26.160> and<00:02:26.459> in<00:02:26.820> the

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
like to achieve in the plaza and in the

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.480 
like to achieve in the plaza and in the
restaurant<00:02:27.330> I<00:02:27.510> think<00:02:28.170> that<00:02:28.500> the<00:02:29.160> unique

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
restaurant I think that the unique

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.210 
restaurant I think that the unique
experience<00:02:30.390> of<00:02:30.600> having<00:02:30.810> the<00:02:31.440> museum's<00:02:32.010> the

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
experience of having the museum's the

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.970 
experience of having the museum's the
culture<00:02:32.790> the<00:02:32.970> art<00:02:33.239> and<00:02:33.480> great<00:02:34.080> food<00:02:34.410> down<00:02:34.680> here

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
culture the art and great food down here

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.250 
culture the art and great food down here
will<00:02:35.520> make<00:02:35.670> it<00:02:35.700> different<00:02:36.180> in<00:02:36.420> one<00:02:36.840> way<00:02:37.020> and<00:02:37.050> I

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
will make it different in one way and I

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.740 
will make it different in one way and I
think<00:02:37.440> in<00:02:37.530> another<00:02:37.620> way<00:02:37.980> really<00:02:38.640> like<00:02:39.390> every

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
think in another way really like every

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.360 
think in another way really like every
restaurant<00:02:40.200> the<00:02:40.410> chef<00:02:40.440> makes<00:02:40.860> it<00:02:41.010> different

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
restaurant the chef makes it different

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:42.590 
restaurant the chef makes it different
and<00:02:41.459> there's<00:02:41.730> a<00:02:41.820> spirit<00:02:42.209> and<00:02:42.330> a<00:02:42.360> soul<00:02:42.540> that

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
and there's a spirit and a soul that

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:43.550 
and there's a spirit and a soul that
lives<00:02:42.840> in<00:02:42.930> the<00:02:43.020> restaurant<00:02:43.350> and<00:02:43.440> that's

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
lives in the restaurant and that's

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.140 
lives in the restaurant and that's
really<00:02:43.800> driven<00:02:44.100> by<00:02:44.310> the<00:02:44.370> chef<00:02:44.640> and<00:02:44.850> I<00:02:44.880> think
