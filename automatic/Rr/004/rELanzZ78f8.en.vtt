FireWire card and what is included in

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.000 
FireWire card and what is included in
this<00:00:24.130> package<00:00:24.400> is<00:00:24.820> the<00:00:25.060> firewire<00:00:25.660> cable<00:00:26.290> you

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:27.010 
this package is the firewire cable you

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:30.260 
this package is the firewire cable you
have<00:00:27.220> the<00:00:27.400> manual<00:00:27.670> as<00:00:28.450> well<00:00:28.779> as<00:00:28.960> drivers<00:00:29.439> and

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:30.270 
have the manual as well as drivers and

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.540 
have the manual as well as drivers and
application<00:00:31.270> programs<00:00:31.869> and<00:00:32.230> you<00:00:33.040> have<00:00:33.310> the

application programs and you have the

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:35.340 
application programs and you have the
firewire<00:00:34.120> card<00:00:34.630> itself

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:35.350 
firewire card itself

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:37.590 
firewire card itself
now<00:00:35.680> firewire<00:00:36.340> technology<00:00:37.090> has<00:00:37.270> been<00:00:37.450> around

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:37.600 
now firewire technology has been around

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.410 
now firewire technology has been around
for<00:00:38.140> some<00:00:38.380> time<00:00:38.680> of<00:00:38.950> course<00:00:39.640> the<00:00:39.880> transfer

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:40.420 
for some time of course the transfer

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.319 
for some time of course the transfer
rates<00:00:40.690> on<00:00:40.989> these<00:00:41.230> are<00:00:41.590> a<00:00:41.620> lot<00:00:42.040> higher<00:00:42.370> than<00:00:43.060> the

00:00:43.319 --> 00:00:43.329 
rates on these are a lot higher than the

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:45.959 
rates on these are a lot higher than the
USB<00:00:44.170> one<00:00:44.530> which<00:00:44.770> is<00:00:44.920> currently<00:00:45.340> pretty<00:00:45.699> much

00:00:45.959 --> 00:00:45.969 
USB one which is currently pretty much

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:49.500 
USB one which is currently pretty much
the<00:00:46.239> standard<00:00:46.930> for<00:00:47.620> USB<00:00:48.489> there<00:00:49.120> is<00:00:49.270> a<00:00:49.300> new

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:49.510 
the standard for USB there is a new

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.170 
the standard for USB there is a new
standard<00:00:49.780> coming<00:00:50.230> out<00:00:50.379> USB<00:00:51.129> 2<00:00:51.460> which<00:00:52.059> will

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:52.180 
standard coming out USB 2 which will

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.930 
standard coming out USB 2 which will
give<00:00:52.239> you<00:00:52.510> around<00:00:52.809> 80<00:00:53.309> megabits<00:00:54.309> per<00:00:54.399> second

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:54.940 
give you around 80 megabits per second

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.500 
give you around 80 megabits per second
over<00:00:55.149> the<00:00:56.190> 400<00:00:57.190> megabits<00:00:57.579> per<00:00:57.730> second<00:00:58.239> that

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:58.510 
over the 400 megabits per second that

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.830 
over the 400 megabits per second that
this<00:00:58.870> kind<00:00:59.170> of<00:00:59.320> card<00:00:59.679> can<00:01:00.460> do<00:01:01.000> this<00:01:01.420> standard

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:01.840 
this kind of card can do this standard

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.140 
this kind of card can do this standard
though<00:01:02.109> is<00:01:02.379> very<00:01:02.469> common<00:01:03.370> when<00:01:03.579> it<00:01:03.640> comes<00:01:03.940> to

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:04.150 
though is very common when it comes to

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.160 
though is very common when it comes to
using<00:01:04.379> camcorders<00:01:05.400> certainly<00:01:06.400> a<00:01:06.430> lot<00:01:06.820> of

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
using camcorders certainly a lot of

firewire DV digital video camcorders on
the<00:01:10.840> market<00:01:11.230> now<00:01:11.380> more<00:01:12.130> so<00:01:12.460> than<00:01:12.700> the<00:01:12.820> USB<00:01:13.450> 2

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:13.690 
the market now more so than the USB 2

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:15.900 
the market now more so than the USB 2
camcorders<00:01:14.410> and<00:01:14.620> they<00:01:15.130> are<00:01:15.310> coming<00:01:15.730> out<00:01:15.880> of

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:15.910 
camcorders and they are coming out of

camcorders and they are coming out of
course<00:01:16.480> however<00:01:17.110> this<00:01:17.409> standard<00:01:18.130> it's<00:01:18.400> much

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
course however this standard it's much

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.140 
course however this standard it's much
more<00:01:19.180> readily<00:01:19.570> used<00:01:19.900> than<00:01:20.530> a<00:01:20.560> USB<00:01:21.220> 2<00:01:21.490> currently

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:22.150 
more readily used than a USB 2 currently

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.480 
more readily used than a USB 2 currently
taking<00:01:22.810> a<00:01:22.930> closer<00:01:23.259> look<00:01:23.619> here<00:01:23.890> at<00:01:24.040> the<00:01:24.220> card

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
taking a closer look here at the card

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.120 
taking a closer look here at the card
itself<00:01:25.000> you<00:01:25.869> will<00:01:26.049> notice<00:01:26.500> here<00:01:26.680> on<00:01:26.799> the<00:01:26.920> back

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
itself you will notice here on the back

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.960 
itself you will notice here on the back
there<00:01:27.400> is<00:01:27.430> two<00:01:28.380> 1394<00:01:29.380> ports<00:01:29.770> and<00:01:29.979> there<00:01:30.399> is<00:01:30.579> one

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:30.970 
there is two 1394 ports and there is one

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.749 
there is two 1394 ports and there is one
on<00:01:31.180> the<00:01:31.600> inside<00:01:31.780> as<00:01:32.380> well<00:01:32.649> now<00:01:33.340> that<00:01:33.579> is<00:01:33.729> a

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:33.759 
on the inside as well now that is a

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:35.010 
on the inside as well now that is a
little<00:01:34.000> different<00:01:34.390> because<00:01:34.509> in<00:01:34.869> most

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
little different because in most

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.560 
little different because in most
situations<00:01:35.320> most<00:01:36.189> cards<00:01:36.579> emulsifier<00:01:37.329> wire

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 
situations most cards emulsifier wire

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.940 
situations most cards emulsifier wire
cards<00:01:38.049> do<00:01:38.590> come<00:01:39.040> with<00:01:39.700> the<00:01:40.119> ports<00:01:40.509> only<00:01:41.140> on<00:01:41.380> the

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
cards do come with the ports only on the

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.280 
cards do come with the ports only on the
outside<00:01:42.460> this<00:01:43.060> is<00:01:43.299> basically<00:01:43.659> used<00:01:43.930> for

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.290 
outside this is basically used for

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:46.230 
outside this is basically used for
things<00:01:44.530> like<00:01:44.680> internal<00:01:45.280> hard<00:01:45.670> drives<00:01:45.939> and

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
things like internal hard drives and

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.810 
things like internal hard drives and
other<00:01:46.810> devices<00:01:47.170> that<00:01:47.409> would<00:01:47.680> use<00:01:47.950> this<00:01:48.159> on<00:01:48.369> the

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
other devices that would use this on the

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.910 
other devices that would use this on the
inside<00:01:49.240> something<00:01:50.200> else<00:01:50.380> for<00:01:50.560> that<00:01:50.619> is<00:01:50.890> a

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
inside something else for that is a

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.130 
inside something else for that is a
little<00:01:51.189> unique<00:01:51.579> about<00:01:51.939> this<00:01:52.210> particular<00:01:52.600> card

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
little unique about this particular card

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.780 
little unique about this particular card
is<00:01:53.320> the<00:01:53.439> fact<00:01:53.710> that<00:01:53.829> they<00:01:54.070> have<00:01:54.310> a<00:01:54.340> power

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:54.790 
is the fact that they have a power

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:56.789 
is the fact that they have a power
connector<00:01:55.299> here<00:01:55.719> which<00:01:56.200> goes<00:01:56.469> directly

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:56.799 
connector here which goes directly

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:59.690 
connector here which goes directly
connected<00:01:57.759> into<00:01:58.299> your<00:01:58.539> power<00:01:58.840> supply

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
connected into your power supply

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.639 
connected into your power supply
basically<00:02:00.700> what<00:02:00.939> this<00:02:01.210> is<00:02:01.270> for<00:02:01.689> is<00:02:01.750> that<00:02:02.229> it

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:02.649 
basically what this is for is that it

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:04.889 
basically what this is for is that it
takes<00:02:03.039> the<00:02:03.399> strain<00:02:03.820> of<00:02:03.850> the<00:02:04.329> power<00:02:04.600> that's

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:04.899 
takes the strain of the power that's

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:08.190 
takes the strain of the power that's
consumed<00:02:05.469> when<00:02:05.829> you're<00:02:05.979> using<00:02:06.219> a<00:02:06.549> DVD<00:02:07.390> product

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
consumed when you're using a DVD product

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.770 
consumed when you're using a DVD product
from<00:02:09.009> the<00:02:09.250> motherboard<00:02:09.550> and<00:02:10.000> directs<00:02:10.660> it

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
from the motherboard and directs it

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.110 
from the motherboard and directs it
directly<00:02:11.380> into<00:02:11.830> the<00:02:11.950> power<00:02:12.160> supply<00:02:12.340> feet<00:02:12.910> so

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
directly into the power supply feet so

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.500 
directly into the power supply feet so
again<00:02:13.420> you<00:02:13.990> would<00:02:14.110> plug<00:02:14.290> your<00:02:14.500> power<00:02:14.890> supply

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
again you would plug your power supply

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.410 
again you would plug your power supply
directly<00:02:16.510> into<00:02:17.230> the<00:02:17.410> card<00:02:17.680> itself<00:02:18.030> overall<00:02:19.030> a

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
directly into the card itself overall a
