00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 hello everyone well before continuing with 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.049
 our description of motorhomes 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:11.219
 and its interior and exterior parts 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:14.240
 just tell you that these videos as you see 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:18.900
 are made to give an explanation 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:22.500
 simple and concise and we do not stick to 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:25.109
 make big editions or look for a 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.050
 supreme quality because we are not 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:31.439
 competing in no contest of videos 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:34.140
 but we want to be of help in the 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.090
 search of your motorhome well 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.150
 today we are going to talk about the bathrooms there 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:42.940
 we have an example this is a bathroom 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:46.960
 here we have the toilet with cassette 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:49.870
 removable ford brand there are two or 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:53.350
 three bathroom brands different from 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:56.490
 different removable cassette here 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:01:00.760
 we have a sink the ground is waterproof 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:03.490
 we can fight and under the floor of 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:06.760
 under the vehicle there is a deposit for 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:09.490
 the gray waters there join the waters 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:13.840
 of the toilet when we showered from the sink 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:16.270
 and the kitchen is called gray water in 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:19.630
 I change the beans that come from the vate 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:23.680
 they are called gas waters it is important that 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:26.440
 a bathroom has a window or a 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:29.470
 skylight on the roof or both 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:32.260
 the more ventilated the better it is here 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:34.479
 we are seeing a little of cupboards the 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.460
 Bathrooms have a different size according to 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:39.490
 that motorhome and the distribution that 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:42.850
 have inside and how we shower 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:47.259
 here we have this mono command that 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:51.640
 we have a flexo and we hang them 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:53.860
 we hang it up here and here we already 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.830
 we can fight as a rule bathrooms 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:02:00.720
 They have hot water water heater 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:03.759
 and cold and good all the motorhomes 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:06.479
 It has a comfortable space some are 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:10.030
 bigger and others are smaller 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:13.060
 let's see now where the waters go 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:15.790
 black sewage goes to the part 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.629
 outside of the motorhome 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:21.700
 and it depends on where the motorhome is 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:24.459
 the bet the black water tank 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.420
 which is removable so that afterwards 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:31.640
 we can empty 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:36.950
 in another in a toilet here we have the 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:41.300
 drawer the water tank your order here what 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:44.150
 we have got this deposit opened and 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:49.440
 we throw everything we put back we put 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:52.610
 liquid blue liquid 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.610
 for hygiene of the 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:03:00.319
 of the toilet and spend we will see another type 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.640
 of different toilet you also have to say 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:05.210
 that the toilet that has 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.210
 um 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:11.170
 fixed deposit under the vehicle 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:14.200
 also for sewage here we see 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:17.260
 another bathroom and complicated bathroom 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:20.230
 to the toilet identical to the other here the 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:25.150
 onion also identical but it's a 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:28.390
 Larger larger with separate shower 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:30.340
 here is already important taste the 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:33.250
 everyone's need because people 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.439
 they have enough with a bath 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:38.530
 teeny and others who want a bath 

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:40.780
 wider and these bathrooms can 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.000
 find it also in vehicles of 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:47.010
 different type such as for example 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:49.650
 profiled motorcycles 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:52.920
 some camper has a big bathroom very 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:55.439
 little camper little girls do not have 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.659
 does not usually have any bathroom 

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:59.939
 The bigger the bathroom, the less cabinets 

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:03.150
 we have because the space is delimited 

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:07.010
 that is either we have a large bathroom or we have 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.010
 some large closets
