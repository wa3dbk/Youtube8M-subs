controller<00:00:21.119> now<00:00:21.990> this<00:00:22.230> controller<00:00:22.650> works<00:00:22.920> in

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
controller now this controller works in

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.179 
controller now this controller works in
two<00:00:23.279> primary<00:00:24.090> ways<00:00:24.359> one<00:00:25.019> is<00:00:25.170> in<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:25.500> slave

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
two primary ways one is in the slave

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.570 
two primary ways one is in the slave
mode<00:00:26.670> and<00:00:27.050> one<00:00:28.050> is<00:00:28.260> in<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.560> master<00:00:29.250> mode<00:00:29.400> and

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
mode and one is in the master mode and

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.759 
mode and one is in the master mode and
there's<00:00:29.730> actually<00:00:30.090> also<00:00:30.240> another<00:00:30.599> slave<00:00:31.199> /

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
there's actually also another slave /

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.010 
there's actually also another slave /
master<00:00:32.130> mode<00:00:32.489> in<00:00:32.730> which<00:00:33.059> you<00:00:33.180> can<00:00:33.420> daisy-chain

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
master mode in which you can daisy-chain

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.770 
master mode in which you can daisy-chain
these<00:00:34.500> units<00:00:34.890> together<00:00:35.340> now<00:00:36.210> first<00:00:36.570> let's

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
these units together now first let's

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.270 
these units together now first let's
talk<00:00:36.930> about<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.200> master<00:00:37.530> mode<00:00:37.680> now<00:00:37.890> right<00:00:38.100> now

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
talk about the master mode now right now

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.680 
talk about the master mode now right now
we're<00:00:38.460> in<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.579> master<00:00:38.790> mode<00:00:39.180> you<00:00:39.360> can<00:00:39.510> see

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
we're in the master mode you can see

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.200 
we're in the master mode you can see
that<00:00:39.930> and<00:00:40.200> this<00:00:41.129> means<00:00:41.489> that<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.820> controller

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
that and this means that the controller

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.119 
that and this means that the controller
is<00:00:42.360> actually<00:00:42.870> generating<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.410> output<00:00:43.530> there

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
is actually generating the output there

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.389 
is actually generating the output there
is<00:00:44.399> no<00:00:44.820> signal<00:00:45.390> coming<00:00:45.780> in<00:00:45.930> here<00:00:46.320> from<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:46.950> DMX

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
is no signal coming in here from the DMX

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.959 
is no signal coming in here from the DMX
controller<00:00:48.350> so<00:00:49.350> this<00:00:50.129> allows<00:00:50.489> you<00:00:50.670> to<00:00:50.730> use<00:00:50.789> it

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
controller so this allows you to use it

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.720 
controller so this allows you to use it
for<00:00:51.270> a<00:00:51.329> variety<00:00:51.449> of<00:00:51.840> uses<00:00:52.110> like<00:00:52.559> parties<00:00:53.160> for

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
for a variety of uses like parties for

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.200 
for a variety of uses like parties for
landscape<00:00:54.300> lighting<00:00:54.800> for<00:00:55.800> your<00:00:56.250> deck<00:00:56.610> pull

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
landscape lighting for your deck pull

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.060 
landscape lighting for your deck pull
those<00:00:57.629> kinds<00:00:57.960> of<00:00:57.989> things<00:00:58.230> where<00:00:58.500> you<00:00:58.620> may<00:00:58.829> not

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
those kinds of things where you may not

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.799 
those kinds of things where you may not
necessarily<00:00:59.219> want<00:00:59.820> to<00:00:59.850> hook<00:01:00.059> up<00:01:00.239> a<00:01:00.359> computer

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809

that exist within this controller so as

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.830 
that exist within this controller so as
we<00:02:07.469> mentioned<00:02:07.590> we<00:02:07.829> have<00:02:08.039> the<00:02:08.629> master<00:02:09.629> mode

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
we mentioned we have the master mode

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.949 
we mentioned we have the master mode
with<00:02:10.140> the<00:02:10.229> mode<00:02:10.440> in<00:02:10.739> the<00:02:10.979> default<00:02:11.340> sequence

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
with the mode in the default sequence

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:13.910 
with the mode in the default sequence
you<00:02:12.959> can<00:02:13.110> see<00:02:13.260> that

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
you can see that

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.620 
you can see that
if<00:02:14.400> we<00:02:14.490> press<00:02:14.670> it<00:02:14.790> again<00:02:15.000> you'll<00:02:15.150> also<00:02:15.330> see

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
if we press it again you'll also see

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.900 
if we press it again you'll also see
that<00:02:15.780> there<00:02:15.930> is<00:02:16.050> a<00:02:16.080> run<00:02:16.440> speed<00:02:16.920> and<00:02:17.160> the<00:02:17.700> run

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
that there is a run speed and the run

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.510 
that there is a run speed and the run
speed<00:02:18.300> allows<00:02:19.020> you<00:02:19.200> to<00:02:19.290> change<00:02:19.500> how<00:02:19.650> fast<00:02:20.250> that

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
speed allows you to change how fast that

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.490 
speed allows you to change how fast that
is<00:02:20.670> occurring<00:02:20.940> in<00:02:21.180> eight<00:02:21.690> different<00:02:21.930> levels

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
is occurring in eight different levels

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.900 
is occurring in eight different levels
so<00:02:22.680> we<00:02:22.800> can<00:02:22.920> see<00:02:23.100> here<00:02:23.310> a<00:02:23.340> very<00:02:23.550> slow<00:02:23.910> change<00:02:24.680> or

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
so we can see here a very slow change or

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.210 
so we can see here a very slow change or
all<00:02:26.910> the<00:02:27.120> way<00:02:27.240> up<00:02:27.420> to<00:02:27.720> the<00:02:28.230> fastest<00:02:28.830> which<00:02:29.069> is

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
all the way up to the fastest which is

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.180 
all the way up to the fastest which is
zero<00:02:29.840> now<00:02:30.840> we<00:02:31.230> also<00:02:31.410> have<00:02:31.740> the<00:02:31.890> number<00:02:32.130> of

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
zero now we also have the number of

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.220 
zero now we also have the number of
pixels<00:02:32.610> and<00:02:32.790> that's<00:02:32.910> important<00:02:33.480> because<00:02:33.930> if

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
pixels and that's important because if

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.140 
pixels and that's important because if
we're<00:02:34.380> daisy<00:02:34.620> chaining<00:02:35.070> these<00:02:35.280> together<00:02:35.670> in<00:02:36.090> a

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
we're daisy chaining these together in a

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.180 
we're daisy chaining these together in a
master/slave<00:02:36.780> arrangement<00:02:37.410> that<00:02:37.860> allows

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
master/slave arrangement that allows

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.600 
master/slave arrangement that allows
this<00:02:38.670> string<00:02:39.120> of<00:02:39.470> pixels<00:02:40.470> right<00:02:40.680> here<00:02:41.040> to<00:02:41.489> be

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
this string of pixels right here to be

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.880 
this string of pixels right here to be
hooked<00:02:42.090> up<00:02:42.270> to<00:02:42.330> the<00:02:42.570> next<00:02:42.750> controller<00:02:43.230> which

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
hooked up to the next controller which

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.890 
hooked up to the next controller which
will<00:02:44.069> then<00:02:44.220> continue<00:02:44.940> on<00:02:44.970> with<00:02:45.180> this<00:02:45.630> string

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
will then continue on with this string

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.449 
will then continue on with this string
so<00:02:45.930> if<00:02:46.230> you've<00:02:46.350> got<00:02:46.470> a<00:02:46.500> chase<00:02:46.800> that<00:02:47.040> starts<00:02:47.340> on

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
so if you've got a chase that starts on

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.330 
so if you've got a chase that starts on
one<00:02:47.790> it<00:02:48.330> will<00:02:48.510> go<00:02:49.260> on<00:02:49.290> to<00:02:49.680> the<00:02:49.770> next<00:02:49.860> controller

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
one it will go on to the next controller

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.890 
one it will go on to the next controller
and<00:02:50.580> of<00:02:50.910> course<00:02:51.090> it<00:02:51.239> needs<00:02:51.360> to<00:02:51.600> know<00:02:51.750> the

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
and of course it needs to know the

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.720 
and of course it needs to know the
number<00:02:52.140> of<00:02:52.230> pixels<00:02:52.410> so<00:02:52.980> if<00:02:53.070> we<00:02:53.190> change<00:02:53.430> this

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
number of pixels so if we change this

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.280 
number of pixels so if we change this
number<00:02:54.380> here<00:02:55.380> you<00:02:55.530> can<00:02:56.220> see<00:02:56.630> that<00:02:57.630> only<00:02:57.750> one<00:02:57.900> is

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
number here you can see that only one is

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.050 
number here you can see that only one is
used<00:02:58.560> and<00:02:59.040> it's<00:02:59.489> a<00:02:59.550> little<00:02:59.670> hard<00:02:59.880> to<00:02:59.940> see

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
used and it's a little hard to see

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.000 
used and it's a little hard to see
because<00:03:00.120> it's<00:03:00.360> only<00:03:00.450> flashing<00:03:00.900> white<00:03:01.670> alright

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
because it's only flashing white alright

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.090 
because it's only flashing white alright
next<00:03:05.010> we<00:03:05.250> have<00:03:05.489> is<00:03:05.850> the<00:03:06.090> icy<00:03:06.570> type<00:03:06.810> that<00:03:07.800> is<00:03:07.950> the

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
next we have is the icy type that is the

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.190 
next we have is the icy type that is the

that<00:04:13.170> you<00:04:13.530> can<00:04:13.680> see<00:04:13.799> it's<00:04:13.920> on<00:04:14.160> white<00:04:14.820> and<00:04:15.120> it

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
that you can see it's on white and it

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:17.900 
that you can see it's on white and it
changes<00:04:15.540> to<00:04:15.720> red<00:04:15.900> I<00:04:16.169> mean<00:04:16.769> to<00:04:16.890> white<00:04:17.100> there<00:04:17.789> we

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
changes to red I mean to white there we

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:18.170 
changes to red I mean to white there we
go

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
go

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.120 
go
back<00:04:18.299> and<00:04:18.450> forth<00:04:18.780> now<00:04:19.079> what's<00:04:19.380> happening<00:04:19.829> is

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
back and forth now what's happening is

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.420 
back and forth now what's happening is
is<00:04:20.400> that<00:04:20.880> this<00:04:21.600> makes<00:04:22.049> the<00:04:22.229> controller<00:04:22.650> act<00:04:23.010> as

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
is that this makes the controller act as

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.300 
is that this makes the controller act as
a<00:04:23.490> single<00:04:24.180> three<00:04:24.990> channel<00:04:25.380> controller<00:04:25.770> almost

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
a single three channel controller almost

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:27.530 
a single three channel controller almost
like<00:04:26.430> a<00:04:26.460> dumb<00:04:26.669> controller

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
like a dumb controller

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.960 
like a dumb controller
so<00:04:27.750> if<00:04:28.170> you'd<00:04:28.410> like<00:04:28.440> to<00:04:28.710> start<00:04:28.980> off<00:04:29.220> using

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
so if you'd like to start off using

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:31.640 
so if you'd like to start off using
mainly<00:04:30.360> DMX<00:04:30.900> but<00:04:31.080> here<00:04:31.260> we<00:04:31.350> have<00:04:31.470> them<00:04:31.560> in<00:04:31.620> the

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
mainly DMX but here we have them in the

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:33.680 
mainly DMX but here we have them in the
demo<00:04:32.040> mode<00:04:32.220> if<00:04:32.490> you'd<00:04:33.000> like<00:04:33.120> to<00:04:33.270> start<00:04:33.540> off

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
demo mode if you'd like to start off

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.360 
demo mode if you'd like to start off
with<00:04:33.750> pixels<00:04:34.350> and<00:04:34.590> by<00:04:34.770> pixels<00:04:35.220> as<00:04:35.310> an

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
with pixels and by pixels as an

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.970 
with pixels and by pixels as an
investment<00:04:35.850> you<00:04:36.150> can<00:04:36.510> do<00:04:36.660> that<00:04:36.840> then<00:04:37.650> when

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:37.980 
investment you can do that then when

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:39.260 
investment you can do that then when
you're<00:04:38.100> ready<00:04:38.130> to<00:04:38.400> convert<00:04:38.610> them<00:04:38.910> into<00:04:39.060> pixels

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
you're ready to convert them into pixels

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.450 
you're ready to convert them into pixels
you<00:04:39.630> just<00:04:39.840> change<00:04:40.080> this<00:04:40.230> mode<00:04:40.500> over<00:04:40.800> so<00:04:41.430> that

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
you just change this mode over so that

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.880 
you just change this mode over so that
they're<00:04:41.790> not<00:04:41.970> controlling<00:04:42.660> all<00:04:43.110> the<00:04:43.560> pixels

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:43.890 
they're not controlling all the pixels

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:46.460 
they're not controlling all the pixels
as<00:04:44.040> just<00:04:44.940> three<00:04:45.270> channels<00:04:45.630> so<00:04:45.780> it<00:04:45.960> can<00:04:46.170> act<00:04:46.350> as

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
as just three channels so it can act as

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.260 
as just three channels so it can act as
a<00:04:46.530> three<00:04:46.800> channel<00:04:46.950> controller<00:04:47.370> or<00:04:47.580> it<00:04:48.030> can

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
a three channel controller or it can

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:52.820 
a three channel controller or it can
also<00:04:48.600> act<00:04:49.170> as<00:04:49.410> a<00:04:50.360> full<00:04:51.360> 170<00:04:52.170> pixel<00:04:52.500> controller

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
also act as a full 170 pixel controller

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:56.510 
also act as a full 170 pixel controller
all<00:04:53.790> right<00:04:54.060> next<00:04:54.750> we<00:04:54.960> have<00:04:55.170> reverse<00:04:56.040> control

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 
all right next we have reverse control

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.490 
all right next we have reverse control
now<00:04:57.120> normally<00:04:57.630> pixels<00:04:58.080> are<00:04:58.170> going<00:04:58.290> to<00:04:58.350> be

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
now normally pixels are going to be

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.320 
now normally pixels are going to be
numbered<00:04:58.950> so<00:04:59.220> that<00:04:59.250> at<00:04:59.640> the<00:04:59.880> start<00:05:00.150> of<00:05:00.210> the

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
numbered so that at the start of the

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.480 
numbered so that at the start of the
strip<00:05:00.630> here<00:05:00.960> you<00:05:01.080> can<00:05:01.260> see<00:05:01.440> the<00:05:01.590> arrow<00:05:01.770> so

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
strip here you can see the arrow so

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.550 
strip here you can see the arrow so
normally<00:05:02.910> this<00:05:03.240> section<00:05:03.720> because<00:05:03.990> this<00:05:04.020> is<00:05:04.320> 10

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 
normally this section because this is 10

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.150 
normally this section because this is 10
I<00:05:04.680> see<00:05:04.920> per<00:05:05.600> meter<00:05:06.600> this<00:05:07.380> would<00:05:07.590> be<00:05:07.740> 1<00:05:07.950> pixel

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.160 
I see per meter this would be 1 pixel

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.950 
I see per meter this would be 1 pixel
and<00:05:08.520> then<00:05:08.880> we<00:05:08.940> move<00:05:09.180> down<00:05:09.210> to<00:05:09.480> the<00:05:09.570> next<00:05:09.720> pixel

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960 
and then we move down to the next pixel

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:13.280 
and then we move down to the next pixel
so<00:05:10.410> this<00:05:10.560> would<00:05:10.710> be<00:05:10.830> channels<00:05:11.400> 1<00:05:11.970> 2<00:05:12.180> 3<00:05:12.450> 4<00:05:12.930> DMX

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:13.290 
so this would be channels 1 2 3 4 DMX

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:15.770 
so this would be channels 1 2 3 4 DMX
and<00:05:13.500> this<00:05:13.770> would<00:05:13.920> be<00:05:14.040> 4<00:05:14.490> 5<00:05:14.700> 6<00:05:15.000> now<00:05:15.210> if<00:05:15.480> you<00:05:15.630> wish

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:15.780 
and this would be 4 5 6 now if you wish

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:17.420 
and this would be 4 5 6 now if you wish
to<00:05:15.810> reverse<00:05:16.290> the<00:05:16.530> addressing<00:05:16.980> you<00:05:17.100> can<00:05:17.250> also

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:17.430 
to reverse the addressing you can also

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:20.180 
to reverse the addressing you can also
do<00:05:17.790> that<00:05:18.000> also<00:05:18.660> this<00:05:19.140> makes<00:05:19.410> the<00:05:19.620> demo<00:05:19.980> mode

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:20.190 
do that also this makes the demo mode

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:23.150 
do that also this makes the demo mode
work<00:05:20.820> backwards<00:05:21.600> so<00:05:22.320> if<00:05:22.620> you<00:05:22.710> don't<00:05:22.890> like<00:05:23.010> the

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.160 
work backwards so if you don't like the

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:24.710 
work backwards so if you don't like the
direction<00:05:23.310> that<00:05:23.730> it's<00:05:23.970> chasing<00:05:24.210> you<00:05:24.510> can

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:24.720 
direction that it's chasing you can

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.940 
direction that it's chasing you can
change<00:05:25.620> that<00:05:25.770> direction<00:05:26.690> all<00:05:27.690> right<00:05:27.870> now<00:05:28.500> by

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:28.950 
change that direction all right now by

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:31.370 
change that direction all right now by
holding<00:05:29.370> down<00:05:29.400> the<00:05:29.790> M<00:05:29.940> key<00:05:30.300> here<00:05:30.810> we<00:05:31.110> can<00:05:31.290> go

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:31.380 
holding down the M key here we can go

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:33.410 
holding down the M key here we can go
into<00:05:31.560> decoder<00:05:31.980> mode<00:05:32.250> now<00:05:32.700> the<00:05:32.760> decoder<00:05:33.150> mode

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:33.420 
into decoder mode now the decoder mode

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:35.990 
into decoder mode now the decoder mode
is<00:05:33.690> where<00:05:34.470> it's<00:05:34.620> going<00:05:34.830> to<00:05:34.920> be<00:05:35.010> driven<00:05:35.220> by<00:05:35.370> DMX

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:36.000 
is where it's going to be driven by DMX

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.090 
is where it's going to be driven by DMX
so<00:05:36.180> let's<00:05:36.360> take<00:05:36.510> a<00:05:36.540> look<00:05:36.720> at<00:05:36.840> that<00:05:37.020> on<00:05:37.290> the<00:05:37.830> side

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:38.100 
so let's take a look at that on the side

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:39.680 
so let's take a look at that on the side
of<00:05:38.130> the<00:05:38.310> unit<00:05:38.640> you<00:05:38.910> can<00:05:39.060> see<00:05:39.240> that<00:05:39.420> there<00:05:39.570> is<00:05:39.660> a

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:39.690 
of the unit you can see that there is a

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:42.080 
of the unit you can see that there is a
nice<00:05:39.930> cap<00:05:40.290> you<00:05:40.770> pull<00:05:40.950> the<00:05:41.070> cap<00:05:41.280> off<00:05:41.490> and<00:05:41.880> that

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:42.090 
nice cap you pull the cap off and that

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:44.210 
nice cap you pull the cap off and that
exposes<00:05:42.480> easy<00:05:42.990> to<00:05:43.200> use<00:05:43.350> screw<00:05:43.740> terminals<00:05:44.160> so

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:44.220 
exposes easy to use screw terminals so

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:45.740 
exposes easy to use screw terminals so
you<00:05:44.310> don't<00:05:44.430> have<00:05:44.520> to<00:05:44.670> solder<00:05:44.850> anything<00:05:45.360> you

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:45.750 
you don't have to solder anything you

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:47.240 
you don't have to solder anything you
can<00:05:45.930> see<00:05:46.080> that<00:05:46.260> on<00:05:46.350> top<00:05:46.560> of<00:05:46.620> the<00:05:46.770> unit<00:05:47.100> it's

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:47.250 
can see that on top of the unit it's

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:49.610 
can see that on top of the unit it's
clearly<00:05:47.520> marked<00:05:47.790> with<00:05:48.030> the<00:05:48.090> DMX<00:05:48.420> in<00:05:48.630> out<00:05:49.170> for

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:49.620 
clearly marked with the DMX in out for

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:53.630 
clearly marked with the DMX in out for
ground<00:05:49.800> including<00:05:50.300> and<00:05:51.300> DMX<00:05:52.170> in<00:05:52.470> so<00:05:53.130> if<00:05:53.400> you

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:53.640 
ground including and DMX in so if you

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:55.250

like 2801 6803 we also have a ground for

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:33.740 
like 2801 6803 we also have a ground for
the<00:06:32.310> pixels<00:06:32.700> and<00:06:32.850> then<00:06:33.060> of<00:06:33.180> course<00:06:33.390> we<00:06:33.600> also

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:33.750 
the pixels and then of course we also

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:36.500 
the pixels and then of course we also
have<00:06:34.020> power<00:06:34.230> in<00:06:34.530> not<00:06:35.430> positive<00:06:36.000> and<00:06:36.150> negative

and<00:06:36.690> this<00:06:37.050> controller<00:06:37.470> will<00:06:37.710> work<00:06:37.980> from<00:06:38.190> 5

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:38.580 
and this controller will work from 5

and this controller will work from 5
volts<00:06:38.970> through<00:06:39.210> 24<00:06:39.690> volts<00:06:39.960> DC<00:06:40.020> now

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:41.070 
volts through 24 volts DC now

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:43.400 
volts through 24 volts DC now
that<00:06:41.820> depends<00:06:42.270> on<00:06:42.420> the<00:06:42.540> pixels<00:06:42.870> you<00:06:42.960> using<00:06:43.260> so

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:43.410 
that depends on the pixels you using so

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:44.810 
that depends on the pixels you using so
if<00:06:43.500> you're<00:06:43.590> using<00:06:43.710> a<00:06:43.860> 12<00:06:44.100> volt<00:06:44.250> pixel<00:06:44.550> like<00:06:44.670> we

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:44.820 
if you're using a 12 volt pixel like we

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:47.720 
if you're using a 12 volt pixel like we
have<00:06:44.940> here<00:06:45.330> you<00:06:45.540> would<00:06:46.050> supply<00:06:46.530> 12<00:06:46.890> volts<00:06:47.190> this

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:47.730 
have here you would supply 12 volts this

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:49.880 
have here you would supply 12 volts this
controller<00:06:48.210> will<00:06:48.480> work<00:06:48.510> with<00:06:49.350> whatever<00:06:49.560> you

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:49.890 
controller will work with whatever you

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:52.460 
controller will work with whatever you
voltage<00:06:50.280> you<00:06:50.430> supply<00:06:50.790> between<00:06:51.060> 5<00:06:51.570> and<00:06:51.750> 24<00:06:52.170> so

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:52.470 
voltage you supply between 5 and 24 so

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:54.590 
voltage you supply between 5 and 24 so
again<00:06:53.130> the<00:06:53.310> voltage<00:06:53.430> would<00:06:53.850> not<00:06:54.180> have<00:06:54.450> to<00:06:54.570> be

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:54.600 
again the voltage would not have to be

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.600 
again the voltage would not have to be
specific<00:06:55.290> to<00:06:55.320> this<00:06:55.470> controller<00:06:55.830> it<00:06:56.190> will<00:06:56.400> work

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:56.610 
specific to this controller it will work

00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:00.380 
specific to this controller it will work
with<00:06:56.790> any<00:06:57.030> of<00:06:57.180> those<00:06:57.300> voltages<00:06:58.220> so<00:06:59.220> that<00:07:00.060> is

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:00.390 
with any of those voltages so that is

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:02.870 
with any of those voltages so that is

the EZ pix pixel controller from holiday
quorum<00:07:03.270> and<00:07:03.450> we<00:07:04.020> hope<00:07:04.200> this<00:07:04.440> makes<00:07:04.710> using

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:05.580 
quorum and we hope this makes using

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:08.570 
quorum and we hope this makes using
pixels<00:07:06.210> even<00:07:06.930> easier<00:07:07.410> than<00:07:07.710> it's<00:07:08.280> ever<00:07:08.430> been

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:08.580 
pixels even easier than it's ever been
