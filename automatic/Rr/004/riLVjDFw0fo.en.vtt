00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.890 
bring up the statistics on it and you
can<00:02:29.989> see<00:02:30.140> there<00:02:30.350> it's<00:02:30.500> at<00:02:31.480> 59.94<00:02:32.480> or<00:02:32.660> frames

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
can see there it's at 59.94 or frames

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.080 
can see there it's at 59.94 or frames
per<00:02:33.200> second<00:02:33.590> which<00:02:33.800> is<00:02:33.980> 60<00:02:34.340> frames<00:02:34.580> a<00:02:34.730> second

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
per second which is 60 frames a second

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.630 
per second which is 60 frames a second
so<00:02:35.750> it<00:02:35.959> converted<00:02:36.500> it<00:02:36.739> and<00:02:36.950> kept<00:02:37.280> the<00:02:37.400> frame

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
so it converted it and kept the frame

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:44.460 
so it converted it and kept the frame
rate<00:02:37.850> high<00:02:38.060> so<00:02:39.400> that's<00:02:40.400> how<00:02:40.700> you<00:02:40.760> can<00:02:42.400> do<00:02:43.400> that

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
rate high so that's how you can do that

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:50.890 
rate high so that's how you can do that
then<00:02:45.470> if<00:02:45.799> you<00:02:45.980> go<00:02:46.130> into<00:02:46.280> iMovie<00:02:47.410> and<00:02:49.390> try<00:02:50.390> file

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
then if you go into iMovie and try file

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.180 
then if you go into iMovie and try file
import<00:02:51.350> and<00:02:51.590> go<00:02:52.160> to<00:02:52.220> desktop<00:02:52.489> and<00:02:53.829> I<00:02:54.829> click<00:02:55.040> on

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
import and go to desktop and I click on

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:07.420 
import and go to desktop and I click on
that<00:02:55.220> movie<00:02:55.970> that<00:02:56.150> it<00:02:56.239> created

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.440 

it'll<00:03:08.430> import<00:03:08.790> it<00:03:08.940> and<00:03:10.879> if<00:03:11.879> I<00:03:12.000> hit<00:03:12.300> the

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
it'll import it and if I hit the

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.330 
it'll import it and if I hit the
spacebar<00:03:12.720> it'll<00:03:13.379> play<00:03:14.030> so<00:03:16.069> that's<00:03:17.069> how<00:03:17.280> you

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
spacebar it'll play so that's how you

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.540 
spacebar it'll play so that's how you
can<00:03:17.550> do<00:03:17.670> a<00:03:17.700> deal<00:03:18.150> with<00:03:18.660> AVCHD<00:03:19.560> files<00:03:20.160> on<00:03:20.519> a

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
can do a deal with AVCHD files on a

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:23.480 
can do a deal with AVCHD files on a
Macintosh<00:03:21.060> computer
