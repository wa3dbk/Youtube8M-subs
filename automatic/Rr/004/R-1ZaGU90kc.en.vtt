00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
trophies as fast as possible I think it

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.889 
trophies as fast as possible I think it
should<00:02:05.460> be<00:02:05.610> pretty<00:02:05.880> fun<00:02:06.210> and<00:02:06.450> crystal<00:02:06.780> League

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
should be pretty fun and crystal League

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.499 
should be pretty fun and crystal League
i'm<00:02:07.110> pretty<00:02:07.560> excited<00:02:07.680> for<00:02:08.250> it<00:02:08.369> I<00:02:08.819> haven't<00:02:09.450> been

there<00:02:09.690> on<00:02:09.840> this<00:02:10.050> account<00:02:10.410> before<00:02:10.649> as<00:02:11.039> I<00:02:11.190> said

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
there on this account before as I said

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.250 
there on this account before as I said
so<00:02:11.819> it<00:02:12.360> should<00:02:12.540> be<00:02:12.569> a<00:02:12.690> little<00:02:12.840> different

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
so it should be a little different

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.289 
so it should be a little different
I'm<00:02:13.379> basically<00:02:13.709> going<00:02:13.920> to<00:02:14.010> use<00:02:14.340> bartsch<00:02:14.790> most

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:43.379 
your dragons so it's a really good

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:46.220

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
strategy guys let's check out what we

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.720 
strategy guys let's check out what we
can<00:02:46.470> find<00:02:46.940> let's<00:02:47.940> go<00:02:48.209> searching<00:02:49.549> alright<00:02:50.549> guys

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
can find let's go searching alright guys

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.339 
can find let's go searching alright guys
this<00:02:50.940> is<00:02:51.120> like<00:02:51.329> a<00:02:51.359> good<00:02:51.750> base<00:02:52.019> right<00:02:52.290> here

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:52.349 
this is like a good base right here

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:54.319 
this is like a good base right here
especially<00:02:52.769> for<00:02:53.129> dark<00:02:53.340> elixir<00:02:53.549> this<00:02:54.120> base

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:54.329 
especially for dark elixir this base

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:56.539 
especially for dark elixir this base
does<00:02:54.690> have<00:02:54.959> maxed<00:02:55.409> air<00:02:55.530> defenses<00:02:56.010> but<00:02:56.220> it's<00:02:56.459> a

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549 
does have maxed air defenses but it's a

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:59.420 
does have maxed air defenses but it's a
town<00:02:56.849> hall<00:02:57.090> 8<00:02:57.260> so<00:02:58.260> they're<00:02:58.709> not<00:02:58.859> the<00:02:59.400> only

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
town hall 8 so they're not the only

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:00.920 
town hall 8 so they're not the only
level<00:02:59.790> 6<00:03:00.090> and<00:03:00.209> there's<00:03:00.329> only<00:03:00.420> three<00:03:00.750> of<00:03:00.780> them

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
level 6 and there's only three of them

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.809 
level 6 and there's only three of them
so<00:03:01.590> I<00:03:01.620> think<00:03:01.799> we<00:03:02.129> should<00:03:02.310> be<00:03:02.400> able<00:03:02.489> to<00:03:02.670> take

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819 
so I think we should be able to take

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:05.000 
so I think we should be able to take
this<00:03:02.940> out<00:03:03.150> pretty<00:03:03.450> easily<00:03:03.780> let's<00:03:04.500> get<00:03:04.650> in<00:03:04.799> here

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
this out pretty easily let's get in here

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.119 
this out pretty easily let's get in here
with<00:03:05.159> some<00:03:05.430> balloons<00:03:05.790> um<00:03:06.120> I<00:03:06.450> think<00:03:06.900> if<00:03:07.319> hmm<00:03:07.950> how

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:08.129 
with some balloons um I think if hmm how

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:09.259 
with some balloons um I think if hmm how
are<00:03:08.190> we<00:03:08.250> going<00:03:08.430> to<00:03:08.519> get<00:03:08.579> the<00:03:08.700> balloons<00:03:09.000> to<00:03:09.239> the

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
are we going to get the balloons to the

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:11.720 
are we going to get the balloons to the
air<00:03:09.480> defense<00:03:10.010> maybe<00:03:11.010> we<00:03:11.159> can<00:03:11.280> start<00:03:11.519> at<00:03:11.639> the

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
air defense maybe we can start at the

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.030 
air defense maybe we can start at the
bottom<00:03:11.940> here<00:03:12.389> and<00:03:12.659> that<00:03:12.959> will<00:03:13.079> also<00:03:13.290> lure<00:03:13.680> the

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
bottom here and that will also lure the

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.160 
bottom here and that will also lure the
enemy<00:03:14.069> clan<00:03:14.639> castle<00:03:14.909> so<00:03:15.659> let's<00:03:15.840> go<00:03:15.959> ahead<00:03:16.019> and

00:03:23.089 --> 00:03:23.099 
Tesla's and they'll probably slow me

that dragon in the clan castle and that

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:49.200 
that dragon in the clan castle and that
Tesla<00:04:46.779> that<00:04:46.930> was<00:04:47.080> in<00:04:47.229> front<00:04:47.590> of<00:04:48.029> his<00:04:49.029> air

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
Tesla that was in front of his air

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:51.110 
Tesla that was in front of his air
defense<00:04:49.509> it<00:04:49.810> really<00:04:50.110> stopped<00:04:50.499> my<00:04:50.680> balloons

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 
defense it really stopped my balloons

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.519 
defense it really stopped my balloons
it's<00:04:52.120> sort<00:04:52.240> of<00:04:52.360> redirected<00:04:52.930> my<00:04:53.020> balloons<00:04:53.349> so

00:04:53.519 --> 00:04:53.529 
it's sort of redirected my balloons so

00:04:53.529 --> 00:04:55.290 
it's sort of redirected my balloons so
they<00:04:53.650> wouldn't<00:04:53.889> go<00:04:54.189> to<00:04:54.249> that<00:04:54.460> Air<00:04:54.669> Defense<00:04:54.999> it

they wouldn't go to that Air Defense it

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.390 
they wouldn't go to that Air Defense it
was<00:04:55.539> probably<00:04:56.409> the<00:04:56.740> biggest<00:04:57.069> inconvenience

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:57.400

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:41.860 
rating so let's see where barbican goes

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:44.369 
rating so let's see where barbican goes
after<00:05:42.250> this<00:05:42.430> is<00:05:42.699> he<00:05:42.819> gonna<00:05:42.939> try<00:05:43.149> to<00:05:43.210> go<00:05:43.360> in<00:05:43.509> no<00:05:43.810> I

would<00:05:46.599> have<00:05:46.719> possibly<00:05:47.500> gotten<00:05:47.770> us<00:05:47.949> that<00:05:48.159> last

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:48.460 
would have possibly gotten us that last

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:51.570 
would have possibly gotten us that last
dark<00:05:48.699> elixir<00:05:48.909> drill<00:05:49.330> which<00:05:49.810> was<00:05:50.020> another<00:05:50.580> 260

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:51.580 
dark elixir drill which was another 260

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:53.339 
dark elixir drill which was another 260
that<00:05:51.759> would<00:05:51.879> have<00:05:51.969> been<00:05:52.029> pretty<00:05:52.330> clutch<00:05:52.689> where

00:05:53.339 --> 00:05:53.349 
that would have been pretty clutch where

00:05:53.349 --> 00:05:54.779 
that would have been pretty clutch where
is<00:05:53.409> he<00:05:53.529> gonna<00:05:53.620> go<00:05:53.740> now<00:05:54.069> he's<00:05:54.279> gonna<00:05:54.399> try<00:05:54.639> to<00:05:54.699> get

00:05:54.779 --> 00:05:54.789 
is he gonna go now he's gonna try to get

00:05:54.789 --> 00:05:57.389 
is he gonna go now he's gonna try to get
that<00:05:54.909> Archer<00:05:55.300> tower<00:05:55.509> and<00:05:55.870> I<00:05:56.800> don't<00:05:57.189> think

00:05:57.389 --> 00:05:57.399 
that Archer tower and I don't think

00:05:57.399 --> 00:05:58.679 
that Archer tower and I don't think
we'll<00:05:57.490> be<00:05:57.520> able<00:05:57.639> to<00:05:57.789> get<00:05:57.909> that<00:05:58.029> last<00:05:58.089> amount<00:05:58.569> of

00:05:58.679 --> 00:05:58.689 
we'll be able to get that last amount of

00:05:58.689 --> 00:06:00.959 
we'll be able to get that last amount of
dark<00:05:58.839> elixir<00:05:59.050> that's<00:05:59.409> a<00:05:59.560> bummer<00:05:59.800> but<00:06:00.250> still<00:06:00.580> we

00:06:00.959 --> 00:06:00.969 
dark elixir that's a bummer but still we

00:06:00.969 --> 00:06:02.939 
dark elixir that's a bummer but still we
got<00:06:01.089> a<00:06:01.120> decent<00:06:01.419> amount<00:06:01.719> here<00:06:02.289> we<00:06:02.649> got<00:06:02.800> at<00:06:02.919> least

00:06:02.939 --> 00:06:02.949 
got a decent amount here we got at least

00:06:02.949 --> 00:06:06.300 
got a decent amount here we got at least
what<00:06:03.430> like<00:06:03.699> 1500<00:06:04.599> I<00:06:04.719> think<00:06:04.960> so<00:06:05.740> we<00:06:05.949> can<00:06:06.069> get<00:06:06.159> out

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:06.310 
what like 1500 I think so we can get out

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:08.450 
what like 1500 I think so we can get out
of<00:06:06.430> here<00:06:06.490> we're<00:06:06.639> done<00:06:06.849> let's<00:06:07.360> see<00:06:07.479> what<00:06:07.569> we<00:06:07.659> got

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:08.460 
of here we're done let's see what we got

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:12.059 
of here we're done let's see what we got
1500<00:06:09.460> yeah<00:06:09.610> 15<00:06:10.000> are<00:06:10.089> dark<00:06:10.330> elixir<00:06:11.069> so

00:06:12.059 --> 00:06:12.069 
1500 yeah 15 are dark elixir so

00:06:12.069 --> 00:06:14.189 
1500 yeah 15 are dark elixir so
considering<00:06:12.699> things<00:06:12.879> did<00:06:13.149> not<00:06:13.180> go<00:06:13.360> so<00:06:13.569> well<00:06:13.779> I

00:06:14.189 --> 00:06:14.199 
considering things did not go so well I

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:17.519 
considering things did not go so well I
think<00:06:14.649> we<00:06:15.279> can<00:06:15.370> call<00:06:15.550> that<00:06:15.759> a<00:06:15.969> win<00:06:16.529> things

00:06:17.519 --> 00:06:17.529 
think we can call that a win things

think we can call that a win things

anyway<00:07:08.090> you're<00:07:08.990> outside<00:07:09.350> walls<00:07:09.680> don't<00:07:10.190> matter

anyway you're outside walls don't matter
as<00:07:10.640> much<00:07:10.670> as<00:07:11.120> your<00:07:11.620> interior<00:07:12.620> walls<00:07:12.920> because

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:13.790 
as much as your interior walls because

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:16.570 
as much as your interior walls because
wall<00:07:14.330> breakers<00:07:14.660> are<00:07:14.900> much<00:07:15.650> less<00:07:15.890> likely<00:07:15.950> to

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:19.220 
get to the inside to the core so that's

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:20.680 
get to the inside to the core so that's
where<00:07:19.370> you<00:07:19.430> want<00:07:19.640> your<00:07:19.790> highest<00:07:20.120> level<00:07:20.210> walls

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:20.690 
where you want your highest level walls

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:22.690 
where you want your highest level walls
guys<00:07:20.960> you'll<00:07:21.260> notice<00:07:21.620> I<00:07:21.740> do<00:07:21.860> that<00:07:22.190> most<00:07:22.580> you

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:22.700 
guys you'll notice I do that most you

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:24.700 
guys you'll notice I do that most you
guys<00:07:22.850> probably<00:07:23.090> do<00:07:23.330> that<00:07:23.510> already<00:07:23.840> all<00:07:24.560> right

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:24.710 
guys probably do that already all right

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:26.470 
guys probably do that already all right
that<00:07:24.980> is<00:07:25.010> it<00:07:25.370> I<00:07:25.430> think<00:07:25.730> we<00:07:25.880> can<00:07:26.000> do<00:07:26.090> one<00:07:26.270> more

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:26.480 
that is it I think we can do one more

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:28.540 
that is it I think we can do one more
and<00:07:26.690> then<00:07:26.780> buy<00:07:27.080> them<00:07:27.290> that's<00:07:27.950> it<00:07:28.130> we<00:07:28.280> just<00:07:28.310> did

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:30.820 
and then buy them that's it we just did
a<00:07:28.580> bunch<00:07:28.880> of<00:07:29.090> walls<00:07:29.300> we<00:07:29.840> just<00:07:30.080> did<00:07:30.320> a<00:07:30.500> dark

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:30.830 
a bunch of walls we just did a dark

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:38.990 
closer to crystal League only what do we

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:41.230 
closer to crystal League only what do we
got<00:07:39.140> 85<00:07:39.530> more<00:07:39.800> trophies<00:07:40.190> now<00:07:40.370> and<00:07:40.640> we're<00:07:41.090> there
