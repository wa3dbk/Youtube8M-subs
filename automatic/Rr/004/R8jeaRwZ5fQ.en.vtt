00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
second pulling away and you get a lot of

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:11.100 
second pulling away and you get a lot of
torque<00:01:10.240> effect<00:01:10.540> through<00:01:10.690> that<00:01:10.840> steering

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110 
torque effect through that steering

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.230 
torque effect through that steering
wheel<00:01:11.380> so<00:01:11.710> there's<00:01:11.980> no<00:01:12.100> one-handed<00:01:12.850> cruising

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240

to give you a lot more feedback than say

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.020 
to give you a lot more feedback than say
the<00:02:32.110> Audi<00:02:32.470> TT<00:02:32.500> which<00:02:33.069> are<00:02:33.190> always<00:02:33.370> a<00:02:33.400> fantastic

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
the Audi TT which are always a fantastic

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.550 
the Audi TT which are always a fantastic
ride<00:02:34.240> it's<00:02:34.450> almost<00:02:34.720> perhaps<00:02:34.990> too<00:02:35.230> refined

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
ride it's almost perhaps too refined

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.500 
ride it's almost perhaps too refined
this<00:02:36.160> feels<00:02:36.400> a<00:02:36.520> lot<00:02:36.670> more<00:02:36.730> like<00:02:36.910> a<00:02:37.060> driver's

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
this feels a lot more like a driver's

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.450 
this feels a lot more like a driver's
car<00:02:37.540> like<00:02:38.050> a<00:02:38.080> racing<00:02:38.770> car<00:02:38.980> I<00:02:39.010> guess

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:39.460 
car like a racing car I guess

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:49.580 
car like a racing car I guess
and<00:02:39.670> perhaps<00:02:39.760> a<00:02:39.970> little<00:02:40.090> bit<00:02:40.300> more<00:02:40.360> fun

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.699 

I<00:02:50.209> can<00:02:51.209> also<00:02:51.330> say<00:02:51.690> that<00:02:51.930> this<00:02:52.140> alpha<00:02:52.380> is<00:02:52.620> the

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
I can also say that this alpha is the

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:54.800 
I can also say that this alpha is the
most<00:02:52.890> exciting<00:02:53.610> car<00:02:53.819> I've<00:02:53.940> driven<00:02:53.970> in<00:02:54.420> a<00:02:54.540> long

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
most exciting car I've driven in a long

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.240 
most exciting car I've driven in a long
way<00:02:55.020> all<00:02:55.440> right<00:02:55.680> it<00:02:55.800> might<00:02:55.920> not<00:02:56.069> have<00:02:56.160> the

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
way all right it might not have the

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:57.920 
way all right it might not have the
stopping<00:02:56.580> ability<00:02:56.760> of<00:02:57.060> the<00:02:57.150> TT<00:02:57.540> and<00:02:57.569> that

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
stopping ability of the TT and that

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.270 
stopping ability of the TT and that
talks<00:02:58.260> there<00:02:58.560> can<00:02:58.800> be<00:02:58.950> a<00:02:58.980> little<00:02:59.190> bit

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
talks there can be a little bit

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.550 
talks there can be a little bit
disconcerting<00:02:59.630> but<00:03:00.630> really<00:03:01.080> that<00:03:01.200> just<00:03:01.380> adds

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
disconcerting but really that just adds

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.770 
disconcerting but really that just adds
to<00:03:01.709> the<00:03:01.830> excitement<00:03:02.130> of<00:03:02.490> it<00:03:02.670> and<00:03:02.819> I<00:03:03.480> think<00:03:03.569> the

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
to the excitement of it and I think the

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.059 
to the excitement of it and I think the
other<00:03:03.900> good<00:03:04.050> thing<00:03:04.200> about<00:03:04.410> the<00:03:04.560> Alpha<00:03:04.830> is<00:03:04.920> it's

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
other good thing about the Alpha is it's

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:06.680 
other good thing about the Alpha is it's
not<00:03:05.160> pigeon-holed<00:03:05.760> in<00:03:05.880> its<00:03:06.030> image<00:03:06.300> you<00:03:06.540> could

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
not pigeon-holed in its image you could

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.479 
not pigeon-holed in its image you could
see<00:03:06.900> a<00:03:07.140> young<00:03:07.350> executive<00:03:07.560> showing<00:03:08.280> off<00:03:08.370> his

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
see a young executive showing off his
