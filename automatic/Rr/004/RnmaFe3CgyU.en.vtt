00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:23.460 
out of it still won't work but two years
for<00:02:21.549> a<00:02:21.579> controller<00:02:21.939> good<00:02:22.569> in<00:02:22.720> my<00:02:22.870> book<00:02:22.900> thumbs

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
for a controller good in my book thumbs

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.830 
for a controller good in my book thumbs
up<00:02:23.650> on<00:02:23.799> that<00:02:23.829> one<00:02:24.129> so<00:02:24.610> I<00:02:24.640> had<00:02:25.180> to<00:02:25.299> go<00:02:25.420> in<00:02:25.569> and<00:02:25.659> buy

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
up on that one so I had to go in and buy

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.470 
up on that one so I had to go in and buy
a<00:02:25.870> brand<00:02:26.319> new<00:02:26.379> Xbox<00:02:26.590> one<00:02:27.099> controller<00:02:27.489> and<00:02:27.819> then

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
a brand new Xbox one controller and then

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.899 
a brand new Xbox one controller and then
I<00:02:28.569> realized<00:02:28.989> that<00:02:29.290> Microsoft<00:02:29.920> and<00:02:30.190> Xbox<00:02:30.640> just

00:02:30.899 --> 00:02:30.909 
I realized that Microsoft and Xbox just

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:33.960 
I realized that Microsoft and Xbox just
came<00:02:31.269> out<00:02:31.420> with<00:02:31.690> a<00:02:31.720> new<00:02:31.989> controller<00:02:32.819> but<00:02:33.819> this

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
came out with a new controller but this

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.610 
came out with a new controller but this
controller<00:02:34.299> looks<00:02:34.510> exactly<00:02:34.870> the<00:02:35.140> same<00:02:35.440> as

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
controller looks exactly the same as

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.259 
controller looks exactly the same as
this<00:02:35.739> controller<00:02:36.190> so<00:02:36.430> why<00:02:36.579> is<00:02:36.640> it<00:02:36.849> brand<00:02:37.090> new

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:37.269 
this controller so why is it brand new

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:39.869 
this controller so why is it brand new
first<00:02:37.900> of<00:02:38.140> all<00:02:38.290> the<00:02:38.739> model<00:02:39.250> number<00:02:39.549> on<00:02:39.579> this

00:02:39.869 --> 00:02:39.879 
first of all the model number on this

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:41.280 
first of all the model number on this
controller<00:02:40.299> you're<00:02:40.480> gonna<00:02:40.599> find<00:02:40.900> that<00:02:41.079> right

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
controller you're gonna find that right

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.839 
controller you're gonna find that right
here<00:02:41.530> on<00:02:41.620> the<00:02:41.709> UPC<00:02:42.220> code<00:02:42.430> the<00:02:42.909> model<00:02:43.299> number<00:02:43.599> is

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849 
here on the UPC code the model number is

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:51.270 
here on the UPC code the model number is
model<00:02:45.849> number<00:02:45.879> 16<00:02:46.690> 97<00:02:47.530> or<00:02:48.420> ex6<00:02:49.420> -<00:02:50.170> zero<00:02:50.889> zero

this<00:02:54.760> is<00:02:54.940> the<00:02:55.060> model<00:02:55.329> number<00:02:55.540> of<00:02:55.599> controller

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:56.049 
this is the model number of controller

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:59.369 
this is the model number of controller
you<00:02:56.260> want<00:02:56.440> to<00:02:56.530> look<00:02:56.650> for<00:02:57.359> because<00:02:58.359> even<00:02:59.290> the

00:02:59.369 --> 00:02:59.379 
you want to look for because even the

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:01.589 
you want to look for because even the
old<00:02:59.560> ones<00:02:59.920> the<00:03:00.310> old<00:03:00.430> boxes<00:03:00.940> still<00:03:01.389> look

00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:01.599 
old ones the old boxes still look

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:02.670 
old ones the old boxes still look
exactly<00:03:01.720> the<00:03:02.319> same

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
exactly the same

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.160 
exactly the same
the<00:03:03.129> only<00:03:03.310> difference<00:03:03.730> is<00:03:03.909> it<00:03:04.900> has<00:03:04.959> it

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
the only difference is it has it

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:06.780 
the only difference is it has it
different<00:03:05.440> model<00:03:05.680> numbers<00:03:05.920> and<00:03:06.069> that's<00:03:06.670> the

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
different model numbers and that's the

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:07.890 
different model numbers and that's the
only<00:03:06.970> difference<00:03:07.000> so<00:03:07.450> if<00:03:07.510> you're<00:03:07.629> going<00:03:07.750> to

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
only difference so if you're going to

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.080 
only difference so if you're going to

look<00:03:13.840> for<00:03:13.989> that<00:03:14.230> model<00:03:14.829> number<00:03:15.220> controller

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:15.609 
look for that model number controller

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:17.009 
look for that model number controller
because<00:03:15.879> if<00:03:16.030> you<00:03:16.150> need<00:03:16.269> a<00:03:16.329> new<00:03:16.510> controller<00:03:16.840> or

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
because if you need a new controller or

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:18.360 
because if you need a new controller or
if<00:03:17.109> you<00:03:17.199> want<00:03:17.379> to<00:03:17.470> buy<00:03:17.590> this<00:03:17.650> controller<00:03:18.160> after

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
if you want to buy this controller after

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.659 
if you want to buy this controller after
seeing<00:03:18.760> the<00:03:19.239> difference<00:03:19.949> from<00:03:20.949> this

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:21.669 
seeing the difference from this

00:03:21.669 --> 00:03:24.000 
seeing the difference from this
controller<00:03:22.230> don't<00:03:23.230> buy<00:03:23.379> the<00:03:23.440> old<00:03:23.620> one<00:03:23.859> so

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
controller don't buy the old one so

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:25.589 
controller don't buy the old one so

back on I just put this back on the
other<00:03:51.310> controller<00:03:51.760> take<00:03:52.659> out<00:03:52.870> this<00:03:53.049> battery

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
other controller take out this battery

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.349 
other controller take out this battery
pack<00:03:53.560> here<00:03:54.069> and<00:03:54.280> I<00:03:54.790> could<00:03:54.970> charge<00:03:55.150> my

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:55.359 
pack here and I could charge my

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:56.789 
pack here and I could charge my
controller<00:03:55.720> with<00:03:55.870> that<00:03:56.019> so<00:03:56.169> this<00:03:56.349> is<00:03:56.409> the<00:03:56.680> old

00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:56.799 
controller with that so this is the old

00:03:56.799 --> 00:03:59.189 
controller with that so this is the old
controller<00:03:57.280> right<00:03:57.489> now<00:03:57.849> you<00:03:58.359> will<00:03:58.659> see<00:03:58.959> on

00:03:59.189 --> 00:03:59.199 
controller right now you will see on

00:03:59.199 --> 00:04:00.449 
controller right now you will see on
this<00:03:59.409> controller<00:03:59.829> when<00:04:00.040> you<00:04:00.129> look<00:04:00.250> at<00:04:00.370> the
