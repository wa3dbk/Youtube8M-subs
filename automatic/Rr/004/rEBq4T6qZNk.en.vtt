00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:05.630
 hello everyone and welcome to a new 

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:07.880
 creative paper tutorial video in this 

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:11.179
 case let's make some feathers with wasit 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:13.129
 eps will take us long and cover a 

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:16.010
 wire in my case rose because it was the 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:19.539
 first I found and some scissors for 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.539
 cut the washi tips 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.390
 the first step will be to cut a little piece of 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.970
 wire 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.470
 the length will depend on the length 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.609
 You want me to have our pen and in my 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.769
 case I'm doing very feathers 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.980
 little ones is with a tiny little cachito 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:37.620
 is enough in particular this pen is going 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.909
 to be the smallest of the four that 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.909
 they will appear in this video 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.730
 Now what we have to try is 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:51.040
 paste the wire as centered as possible 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:53.710
 in washi tape 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:56.770
 I like before folding leave a 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:58.780
 little piece on top for later 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:00.850
 make more cuts so the pump stays with 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.040
 a little more natural within what 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.390
 it fits at the time of folding 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.490
 if you are lucky and now first 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.980
 Well congratulations matches in my case 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.370
 I agreed he has fired a little 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:13.590
 and it's enough 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:16.260
 now we have to cut a little bit the 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.780
 bottom part so make a 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.430
 the triangular shape and in the part of 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.860
 up with that surplus that has 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.210
 we have to do it from the fold 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.210
 a rounded shape 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.469
 now we have the base of our 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.840
 pen now the fun part comes to 

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:39.030
 cut everything around wire what 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.429
 good thing is that the wire is going to make us 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:45.080
 the stop function we are not going to cut 

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:47.540
 never again because he will not let us 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.820
 once we already have this because I already 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:52.730
 only thing that remains is to clear a little 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.060
 the pen play a little with the cortez and 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:55.040
 cough 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.520
 until we give it the form here that more 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.520
 we like it 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.190
 good as you see it has been a videotutorial 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:05.410
 very simple very short but I hope that 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:08.649
 I have given you some better idea even 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:10.750
 to try on patterned papers or 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:13.570
 I'm sure you can think of something very much 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:18.060
 better we wait for you in our next 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:18.060
