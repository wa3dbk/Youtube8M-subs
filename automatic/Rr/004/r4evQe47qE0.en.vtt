00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.949
 he left the van and left until 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:27.199
 holland had already been there in the 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:30.410
 twente and this time it reached the foot 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:32.270
 and the psv eindhoven a team always of 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.739
 those who have to be pointers 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.540
 We are talking about Bryan Ruiz that 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:38.540
 the forward is listening to us 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:41.150
 Costa Rican how are you bryant a 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.320
 return to holland with the psv how is 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.180
 living this moment in which by 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.640
 you have already scored your first goal this time 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:50.000
 week in front of the heracles 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:52.190
 and good happy the truth that happy 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.170
 to be in the Netherlands 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.609
 I have some nice memories 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.640
 now a team then who opened the 

00:00:55.609 --> 00:01:01.120
 doors for our five months and 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:07.820
 play with them and 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:09.290
 a little on the physical side and your help 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.990
 important for your team we are 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:14.210
 used to seeing a fish see more 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.430
 up on the table always fighting for 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.200
 the title a position now that is a 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.000
 little has moved away what is your 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.550
 expectation now that you get to half of 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.290
 season 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:24.530
 and it has been a difficult year for 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.380
 them but 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.630
 already in the team of one that are 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.540
 many young people have a pretty team 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.770
 they play very good but obviously a 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.440
 team that wants to be champion because 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:39.770
 I always need experience then I 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.690
 I'll be there without that deal with this 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.860
 experience with goals 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:46.250
 quiet 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.930
 It must be good and even though 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:51.020
 we raise that is our second 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:02:01.119
 part of the tournament we are already in the fifth 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:02:01.119
 place and also close higher 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.270
 of the table 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.460
 in addition there is an important data four 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.780
 consecutive matches of holder 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.190
 that's exactly what you were looking for 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.230
 Team change mid-season 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.630
 not have more minutes and you have 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:17.420
 mentioned earlier also thinking about the 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.630
 world to arrive with no rhythm 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.790
 but no 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:24.219
 on the other hand, coaches 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:28.290
 things that do not also know for the 

00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:30.800
 team and coaches with new ideas 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.440
 the best was 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.880
 look for some equipment that nobody 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.460
 doors to start would not do for 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.590
 score to collaborate 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:39.840
 these five months will be acclimated 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:50.890
 cut the world that is very important 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:52.660
 so it's very good and I'm happy 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.870
 to have the opportunity to prepare 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.250
 to be well in the world a 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.320
 important opportunity that cup of 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.030
 world we certainly talk about the selection 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.740
 how is Costa Rica right now about 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.600
 all after that bad news the 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.520
 injury of brian oviedo with whom 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.580
 we could talk he is hopeful in 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:12.240
 get there but like this costa rica to 114 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.240
 days of world 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.010
 let's see how which time 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.080
 preparation 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.810
 and also I think it's a rich coast that 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:29.240
 has that we are in a difficult group is 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:31.160
 possible for us to give more 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.870
 and hinder many opportunities for 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.780
 grow as professionals to try 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:38.300
 play a good role in the group stage 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.620
 to give a surprise because we have a 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:41.780
 Good selection 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:46.540
 of the youth team with the 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:49.540
 experience that can give us many 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.540
 others 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:56.220
 uruguay the land of italy we were 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.590
 seeing there bryant thank you very much those 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.850
 are our rivals said in the next 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:03.360
 world thank you very much for being with 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:08.240
 us and keep growing in the gdp and 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:08.240
 I'm sure you need your quality 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.420
 thanks interviews 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.350
 many things 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:25.080
 of course thank you very much thank you 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:27.930
 it's the path of the coast player 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.880
 rica alajuelense where he played 31 matches 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:32.880
 and scored 13 goals then he was in belgium 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:34.440
 in the yen 79 games 26 goals in the 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.790
 tuenti as we said before where 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:40.410
 more games played 65 scored 35 the fulham 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:42.150
 68 could only score eight goals and already in 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:46.110
 the psv eindhoven in only four matches 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:47.970
 a goal also has 12 goals in the 60 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:49.710
 played matches with costa 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:51.450
 rich indeed you have to thank this 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:54.540
 interview also to the people of the 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:56.340
 bryan ruiz's web page of the brain with 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:59.250
 dotcom that has given us the power 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:01.020
 talk to the costa rica striker 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:02.970
 it comes well you will notice it animated you will notice 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:05.130
 happy in his new stage is playing 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:07.470
 holder has more minutes and approaches the 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:09.570
 every football player's dream to the world cup 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:11.970
 player as well you say when you have 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:13.140
 Game minutes feel more comfortable 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:15.890
 happier and when that year 

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:19.960
 World Cup with greater reason surely 

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:22.389
 It would have been different for Bryant 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:25.090
 make the decision in a year that was not 

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:27.669
 mundialista because being in england 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:30.370
 It should always be a goal for a 

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:31.840
 player in the english league that 's a 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:34.030
 important goal because it is the best 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:36.160
 of the world the fulham is a team 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:38.289
 historical 

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:40.330
 and I would have been different, I think 

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:41.979
 your decision is smart because here 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:44.289
 will have minutes and start counting 

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:46.479
 with them and start showing up in the 

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:48.009
 Marker its quality and good is good not 

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:49.569
 only for him but also for 

00:05:48.009 --> 00:05:51.580
 Jorge Luis Pinto not the technician 

00:05:49.569 --> 00:05:53.050
 Colombian in the selection that will count 

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:55.090
 with an important player and in greater 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:57.009
 pace and for phillip cocu the coach 

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:58.660
 of the psv eindhoven 

00:05:57.009 --> 00:06:00.699
 they are already fifth are still climbing 

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:02.620
 positions and said deal was better in 

00:06:00.699 --> 00:06:04.539
 another year yes but be in fulham with 

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:06.280
 a different goal than the league and 

00:06:04.539 --> 00:06:09.090
 play champions this also comes 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:11.460
 well a player and he lives well 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:13.139
 World Cup year or not the player always 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:15.330
 wants to play on the team that is 

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:18.000
 the bigger it is the better for 

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:20.400
 all but I think you look there 

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.500
 many players who are pending 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:24.360
 a milestone for something to see if they have the 

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:26.340
 opportunity to play the world cup and 

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:27.770
 they want to play it and they're like substitute 

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:31.050
 who are looking in some way 

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:35.090
 leave that well to be seen from 

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:37.380
 back enthuse the coach 

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:38.820
 and above all the need that has 

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:40.470
 after the injury of brian oviedo the 

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:41.250
 selection of costa rica has a group 

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:43.940
 hard 

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:46.150
 joel díaz the world cup says he trusted 

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:49.520
 italy uruguay three world champions 

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:51.230
 it's difficult but costa rica is not bad 

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:53.150
 team is not a bad team 

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:55.340
 a very complicated group I do not know until 

00:06:53.150 --> 00:07:00.040
 where can you reach or rescue the 

00:06:55.340 --> 00:07:00.040
 sky a lot is the rich revelation 

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:07.130
 but let's go a little realistic here is 

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:11.150
 complicated this group where I look at it from 

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:12.620
 take out you want and you can dream the 

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:15.740
 man is god with the dream and a beggar 

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:17.390
 when you think that but look at the 

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:19.700
 opportunity that he has now is the 

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:21.680
 last in the full have come to a 

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:23.000
 very complicated situation was not 

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:25.760
 playing was not ok the numbers what 

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.170
 they say they are a team in a psv that to me 

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:28.760
 I was surprised is not on the table almost 

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:30.050
 eliminates AC Milan is not that much the 

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:32.260
 milan not this year but that's what 

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:36.280
 eliminate in the pre 

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:38.680
 and classification of champions I think that 

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:40.420
 it was the option to go to a good team 

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:42.460
 like the psb or go back to the costa rica 

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:44.110
 so I can have a warm-up, I think that 

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:45.700
 It's good to stay in Europe to be in 

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:47.320
 a club that will continue to grow that 

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:49.810
 has young players with a project 

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:51.970
 amazing with a young technician with some 

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:53.560
 you want and an incredible project and this is 

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:56.040
 a very good opportunity for him is going 

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:56.040
 to come very well
