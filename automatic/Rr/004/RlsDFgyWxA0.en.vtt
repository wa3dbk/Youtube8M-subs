00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
board you've got a gigabytes of memory

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.830 
board you've got a gigabytes of memory
it's<00:02:20.230> expandable<00:02:20.799> but<00:02:21.129> to<00:02:21.849> sort<00:02:22.120> of<00:02:22.180> up<00:02:22.269> to<00:02:22.420> 40

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
it's expandable but to sort of up to 40

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.890 
it's expandable but to sort of up to 40
gigabytes<00:02:23.260> with<00:02:23.530> a<00:02:23.610> microSD<00:02:24.610> run<00:02:25.090> it's

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
enabled for NFC augmented reality so all

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:30.899 
enabled for NFC augmented reality so all
of<00:02:29.260> the<00:02:29.440> sort<00:02:29.620> of<00:02:29.709> great<00:02:30.190> new<00:02:30.340> technologies

00:02:30.899 --> 00:02:30.909 
of the sort of great new technologies

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:33.539 
of the sort of great new technologies
that<00:02:31.000> we<00:02:31.090> introduced<00:02:31.480> with<00:02:31.659> blackberry<00:02:32.019> 7<00:02:32.549> it

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:33.549 
that we introduced with blackberry 7 it

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:37.949 
that we introduced with blackberry 7 it
is<00:02:33.790> both<00:02:34.030> top<00:02:34.989> screen<00:02:35.260> and<00:02:36.030> type<00:02:37.030> and<00:02:37.420> so<00:02:37.870> you

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
is both top screen and type and so you

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:39.030 
is both top screen and type and so you
don't<00:02:37.989> need<00:02:38.170> to<00:02:38.290> compromise<00:02:38.620> on<00:02:38.739> your

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
don't need to compromise on your

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.830 
don't need to compromise on your
experience<00:02:39.549> some<00:02:39.849> so<00:02:40.360> that's<00:02:40.510> really<00:02:40.659> the

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
experience some so that's really the

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
signature of the new bold devices that

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.199 
signature of the new bold devices that
are<00:02:43.900> loaded<00:02:44.230> with<00:02:44.319> blackberry<00:02:44.650> 7<00:02:44.980> as<00:02:45.849> we<00:02:46.000> said

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
are loaded with blackberry 7 as we said

scroll down we could have look at mobile

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.099 
scroll down we could have look at mobile
version<00:03:28.060> first<00:03:28.299> then<00:03:28.540> scroll<00:03:28.840> down<00:03:28.870> have

looking<00:03:29.379> desktop<00:03:29.849> it's<00:03:30.849> a<00:03:30.970> little<00:03:31.120> scroll

00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:31.599 
looking desktop it's a little scroll

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:35.550 
looking desktop it's a little scroll
down<00:03:32.970> so<00:03:33.970> of<00:03:34.060> course<00:03:34.090> the<00:03:34.419> curve<00:03:34.629> which<00:03:35.410> has<00:03:35.530> a

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
down so of course the curve which has a

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.210 
down so of course the curve which has a
similar<00:03:35.739> form<00:03:36.129> factor<00:03:36.609> and<00:03:37.239> the<00:03:37.359> curve<00:03:38.190> 9360<00:03:39.190> I

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
similar form factor and the curve 9360 I

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:40.500 
similar form factor and the curve 9360 I
think<00:03:39.459> was<00:03:39.549> the<00:03:39.579> missing<00:03:40.060> curve<00:03:40.269> i<00:03:40.419> was

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
think was the missing curve i was

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.449 
think was the missing curve i was
looking<00:03:40.720> at<00:03:40.870> here<00:03:41.709> with<00:03:41.859> which<00:03:42.040> has<00:03:42.190> the<00:03:42.280> same

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
looking at here with which has the same

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:44.220 
looking at here with which has the same
form<00:03:42.760> factor<00:03:42.819> but<00:03:43.690> of<00:03:43.810> course<00:03:43.959> that<00:03:44.079> doesn't

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
form factor but of course that doesn't

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.140 
form factor but of course that doesn't
have<00:03:44.500> the<00:03:44.650> touch<00:03:44.829> screen<00:03:45.010> so<00:03:45.489> you've<00:03:45.849> gotta<00:03:46.000> go

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
have the touch screen so you've gotta go

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:47.670 
have the touch screen so you've gotta go
bold<00:03:46.389> as<00:03:46.540> to<00:03:46.569> get<00:03:46.840> the<00:03:46.959> touch<00:03:47.109> screen<00:03:47.290> in<00:03:47.530> this

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
bold as to get the touch screen in this

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.640 
bold as to get the touch screen in this
form<00:03:48.069> factor<00:03:48.430> that's<00:03:48.609> really<00:03:49.120> and<00:03:49.359> it's<00:03:49.650> again

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
form factor that's really and it's again

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.199 
form factor that's really and it's again
sort<00:03:50.919> of<00:03:50.980> lovely<00:03:51.430> design<00:03:51.760> I<00:03:51.819> think<00:03:51.970> the

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:52.209 
sort of lovely design I think the

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:53.759 
sort of lovely design I think the
keyboard<00:03:52.629> also<00:03:52.720> makes<00:03:53.079> a<00:03:53.169> difference<00:03:53.500> as<00:03:53.620> well

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:53.769 
keyboard also makes a difference as well

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:54.990 
keyboard also makes a difference as well
if<00:03:53.919> you're<00:03:54.069> looking<00:03:54.340> between<00:03:54.519> the<00:03:54.819> two

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
if you're looking between the two

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.349 
if you're looking between the two
devices<00:03:55.680> but<00:03:56.680> essentially<00:03:57.250> it's<00:03:57.549> important

00:03:58.349 --> 00:03:58.359 
devices but essentially it's important

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:00.659 
devices but essentially it's important
to<00:03:58.660> note<00:03:58.870> that<00:03:58.900> all<00:03:59.379> blackberry<00:04:00.010> devices<00:04:00.340> have

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:18.220 
again okay and we're looking at the same

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.400 
again okay and we're looking at the same
processor<00:04:18.730> are<00:04:18.970> now<00:04:19.120> slightly<00:04:19.390> this<00:04:19.780> is<00:04:19.900> a<00:04:19.930> 1.2

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.410 
processor are now slightly this is a 1.2

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:22.620 
processor are now slightly this is a 1.2
gigahertz<00:04:20.680> yeah<00:04:21.640> the<00:04:21.760> process<00:04:22.150> on<00:04:22.300> this<00:04:22.480> is

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630 
gigahertz yeah the process on this is

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:24.210 
gigahertz yeah the process on this is
ever<00:04:23.080> so<00:04:23.290> slightly<00:04:23.560> though<00:04:23.770> it's<00:04:23.920> a<00:04:23.980> 1

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.220 
ever so slightly though it's a 1

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:25.860 
ever so slightly though it's a 1
gigahertz<00:04:24.520> processor<00:04:24.730> so<00:04:25.420> it's<00:04:25.510> still<00:04:25.690> really

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
gigahertz processor so it's still really

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.740 
gigahertz processor so it's still really
fast<00:04:26.230> this<00:04:26.770> is<00:04:26.890> 1.2<00:04:27.370> that's<00:04:27.610> what<00:04:27.850> ya<00:04:28.060> go<00:04:28.270> and

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
fast this is 1.2 that's what ya go and

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.750 
fast this is 1.2 that's what ya go and
still<00:04:29.080> works<00:04:29.290> really<00:04:29.590> nicely<00:04:29.890> is<00:04:30.160> back<00:04:30.340> for<00:04:30.460> 7

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:30.760 
still works really nicely is back for 7

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.430 
still works really nicely is back for 7
operating<00:04:30.850> system<00:04:31.180> so<00:04:31.720> still<00:04:31.990> a<00:04:32.020> very<00:04:32.260> high

just I was going to ask a couple more
questions<00:05:14.740> about<00:05:15.310> the<00:05:15.490> I<00:05:16.030> mean<00:05:16.510> where<00:05:16.690> this

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:16.840 
questions about the I mean where this

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.630 
questions about the I mean where this
fits<00:05:17.080> in<00:05:17.380> I<00:05:17.530> mean<00:05:17.650> in<00:05:17.770> some<00:05:17.919> ways<00:05:17.979> it<00:05:18.310> does<00:05:18.460> it

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:18.640 
fits in I mean in some ways it does it

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.790 
fits in I mean in some ways it does it
I've<00:05:18.729> got<00:05:18.760> to<00:05:19.000> say<00:05:19.180> if<00:05:19.450> we<00:05:20.050> put<00:05:20.320> it<00:05:20.410> up<00:05:20.530> against

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:20.800 
I've got to say if we put it up against

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:25.100 
I've got to say if we put it up against
the<00:05:21.570> 9360<00:05:22.570> yeah<00:05:22.810> we<00:05:23.530> have<00:05:23.680> the<00:05:23.830> same<00:05:24.040> sort<00:05:24.400> of

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.110 
the 9360 yeah we have the same sort of

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:29.070 
the 9360 yeah we have the same sort of
layered<00:05:26.110> design<00:05:26.650> on<00:05:27.010> both<00:05:27.460> yeah<00:05:28.030> but<00:05:28.870> but

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:29.080 
layered design on both yeah but but

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:30.570 
layered design on both yeah but but
really<00:05:29.350> it's<00:05:29.440> the<00:05:29.470> is<00:05:29.740> so<00:05:30.190> you<00:05:30.490> know

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:30.580 
really it's the is so you know

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.070 
really it's the is so you know
physically<00:05:31.030> they<00:05:31.180> look<00:05:31.360> similar<00:05:31.570> of<00:05:31.870> course

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.080 
physically they look similar of course

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.320 
physically they look similar of course
this<00:05:32.260> just<00:05:32.919> to<00:05:32.979> put<00:05:33.160> it<00:05:33.250> in<00:05:33.400> context<00:05:33.910> we<00:05:34.150> have

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:34.330 
this just to put it in context we have

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:37.440 
this just to put it in context we have
the<00:05:34.600> separate<00:05:35.320> keys<00:05:35.820> without<00:05:36.820> the<00:05:37.030> angles<00:05:37.330> on

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:37.450 
the separate keys without the angles on

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:38.820 
the separate keys without the angles on
the<00:05:37.540> keyboard<00:05:37.900> there<00:05:38.110> but<00:05:38.530> the<00:05:38.620> key<00:05:38.800> thing

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:38.830 
the keyboard there but the key thing

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:40.860 
the keyboard there but the key thing
