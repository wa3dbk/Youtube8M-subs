with<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.600> option<00:00:39.930> that<00:00:39.960> I've<00:00:40.170> elected<00:00:40.590> to<00:00:40.649> go

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
with the option that I've elected to go

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.290 
with the option that I've elected to go
with<00:00:40.770> here<00:00:41.040> which<00:00:41.219> is<00:00:41.340> simply<00:00:41.579> just<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:42.000> stud

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
with here which is simply just the stud

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.900 
with here which is simply just the stud
on<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:43.110> opposite<00:00:43.530> side<00:00:43.829> it's<00:00:44.610> been<00:00:44.760> my

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
on the opposite side it's been my

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.729 
on the opposite side it's been my
experience<00:00:44.940> with<00:00:45.539> standard<00:00:46.050> ambidextrous

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
experience with standard ambidextrous

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.590 
experience with standard ambidextrous
safeties<00:00:47.219> that<00:00:47.760> while<00:00:47.969> throwing<00:00:48.300> those

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
safeties that while throwing those

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.660 
safeties that while throwing those
particularly<00:00:49.230> for<00:00:49.469> a<00:00:49.500> right-handed<00:00:50.399> shooter

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
particularly for a right-handed shooter

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.090 
particularly for a right-handed shooter
or<00:00:50.850> a<00:00:50.879> lefty<00:00:51.360> that<00:00:51.750> as<00:00:51.899> you<00:00:52.050> press<00:00:52.379> down<00:00:52.440> on

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
or a lefty that as you press down on

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.160 
or a lefty that as you press down on
that<00:00:53.579> selector<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.270> lever<00:00:54.480> on<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.690> opposite

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
that selector the lever on the opposite

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.709 
that selector the lever on the opposite
side<00:00:55.410> will<00:00:55.649> bump<00:00:55.949> into<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.460> knuckle<00:00:56.879> on<00:00:57.059> the

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
side will bump into the knuckle on the

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.450 
side will bump into the knuckle on the
on<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.020> hand<00:00:58.350> and<00:00:58.530> actually<00:00:58.829> prevent<00:00:59.309> you

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
on the hand and actually prevent you

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.279 
on the hand and actually prevent you
from<00:00:59.489> from<00:01:00.090> completely<00:01:00.480> disengaging<00:01:01.170> as

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
from from completely disengaging as

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.349 
from from completely disengaging as
safety<00:01:01.710> so<00:01:02.190> that's<00:01:02.370> kind<00:01:02.579> of<00:01:02.640> a<00:01:02.760> kind<00:01:03.210> of<00:01:03.300> a

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
safety so that's kind of a kind of a

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.329 
safety so that's kind of a kind of a
negative<00:01:03.600> so<00:01:04.170> I'm<00:01:04.320> really<00:01:04.559> not<00:01:04.680> looking<00:01:04.920> in<00:01:05.189> my

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
negative so I'm really not looking in my

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.649 
negative so I'm really not looking in my
particular<00:01:05.519> case<00:01:05.850> for<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.360> ambidextrous

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
particular case for the ambidextrous

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.200 
particular case for the ambidextrous
safety<00:01:07.170> capability<00:01:07.979> but<00:01:08.400> what<00:01:08.610> I<00:01:08.640> really<00:01:09.030> like

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
safety capability but what I really like

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.460 
safety capability but what I really like
and<00:01:09.390> what<00:01:09.540> I<00:01:09.570> sought<00:01:09.840> out<00:01:10.020> in<00:01:10.140> this<00:01:10.290> particular

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
and what I sought out in this particular

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.789 
and what I sought out in this particular
model<00:01:10.920> here<00:01:11.310> is<00:01:11.430> this<00:01:12.030> 45<00:01:13.020> degree<00:01:13.049> angle<00:01:13.680> of

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
model here is this 45 degree angle of

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.219 
model here is this 45 degree angle of
throat<00:01:14.189> very<00:01:14.610> very<00:01:14.880> very<00:01:15.030> nice<00:01:15.330> you<00:01:15.869> look<00:01:16.049> at<00:01:16.140> a
