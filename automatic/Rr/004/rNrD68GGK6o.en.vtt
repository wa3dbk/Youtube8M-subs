 Wings of great color and joy, the three 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.099
 schools invested heavily in fantasies and 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:55.010
 allegories 

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:57.640
 the ward of the baianas is always of state 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:00.799
 cheerful colors and traditional movements 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:04.450
 marked the presence of women in their 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:04.450
 majority are of the age of maturity 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:12.349
 the schools have also prepared their 

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:15.530
 bridesmaids and princesses with 

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:17.840
 samba in the foot beauty and rolled the 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:20.180
 concordienses showed that around here 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:23.560
 carnival is a party that can be 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.560
 accompanied by all 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:31.530
 for this seasoned carnival 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:35.039
 carnival this is a party of colors 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:36.870
 joy and emotion and harmony deserves a 

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:40.259
 event is that the carnival always 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:42.659
 was very much associated with the mess 

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:46.440
 folia 'drugs sex 

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:48.449
 finally a lot of things and that denigrate 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.460
 the image of the carnival but the carnival 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:53.220
 some already know I am from joaÃ§aba that already 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:55.860
 In its 30s it is the carnival of 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:58.319
 schools of samba or a carnival that 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:01.949
 works with history research with 

00:04:58.319 --> 00:05:04.139
 tradition with art, right through art 

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:05.460
 tells a whole story and rescues 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:06.870
 culture of the region 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:09.090
 I think it agrees there's a lot to gain. 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:10.919
 because our region is very rich in 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:13.800
 all the senses and the schools are 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:15.629
 talking about our history and sometimes about 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.430
 that reading a book has to study other 

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:20.099
 forms have to watch a movie and here 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:22.259
 we end up seeing a live story right? 

00:05:20.099 --> 00:05:23.460
 passing in the live on the avenue because the 

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:26.460
 carnival is a great 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:27.120
 popular opera where dance music 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:31.500
 corner 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:34.050
 the scenography to the welder with the allegory 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:36.210
 finally everything is part of a context for 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:38.819
 people live that moment the carnival 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:40.979
