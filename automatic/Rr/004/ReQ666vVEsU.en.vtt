00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 my dear youtube friends what is going on 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.000
 I think today is for many of you 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.259
 you the last holiday I feel with 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.730
 if you tomorrow in the 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.309
 school alone when I think of it 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.540
 if you have to get up at 6 or so 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.099
 I always had to 5 alarm clock 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.139
 and even I have that 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.910
 I always got it all out 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.470
 so the eternal fight against the alarm clock 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.840
 not infrequently I lost it before 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.180
 especially if you lie there and think alas 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.949
 is any such important subject 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.599
 first hours I can then also one 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.609
 stay a bit and stay in this 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.349
 fight against the inner dog that were 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.090
 no beautiful times well today it's 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.590
 around your favorite topic drugs 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.700
 maybe you still remember me 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.500
 recently had such a video 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.120
 made about people getting new drugs 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.670
 invent and sometimes even legal 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.620
 distribute and have in the UK 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.539
 I read today, there is currently one 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.910
 drug that is spread on and 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.710
 Although a form of ecstasy with the 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.110
 particularity she has a superman 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.780
 symbol on it and the drug contains the 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.879
 drug pm ma which is very dangerous 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.620
 the bad thing about the drug is that the 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.780
 The effect of a time is up to you 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.430
 entrance and that many people one 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.830
 take these pills and think 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.900
 that did not work at all, I'm still alive 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.490
 not hey do one more and 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.590
 one more and then if the effect 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.750
 If you arrive in an overdose 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.700
 that's the treacherous thing about it 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.280
 Christmas instead of the first person and 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.080
 on New Year's Day three more like many 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.700
 These drugs are still in circulation 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.710
 No one said the police did 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.750
 apparently three suspected dealers 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.939
 arrested all involved 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.670
 from the area around ipswich in the 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.540
 county back in england apparently 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.159
 there is a relative of 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.840
 Heisenberg one settled down and hessen 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.610
 his latest project, however, is the 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.710
 superman troge already a few ago 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.619
 months in the Netherlands emerged 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.049
 well where else the police from back 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.009
 has decided a year 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:45.570
 unconventional way to turn around 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.180
 to fight this drug 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.790
 namely, everyone who gives the drug 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.619
 go unpunished with the police 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.390
 so that the drug from the traffic 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.430
 can be pulled and you look at the 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.229
 Focussed on backers I think 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.210
 actually a good thing to see if 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.040
 that will work reasonably well 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.810
 I ask myself personally when the picture 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.310
 newspaper arrives and says superman 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.840
 blame a drug and kill everyone super 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.459
 Heroes should ban the times directly 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.140
 are almost as bad as killerspiele 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:12.880
 yes, then they take the people 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.410
 prototype sometime to batman and and 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.120
 no hair make that self- justice 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.489
 someday I will be friends too 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.110
 can it formally guarantee you me 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:23.200
 see this picture articles in front of me 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.519
 batman is guilty of self-justice or soon 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.680
 is there anyway to the drug in so 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:28.450
 gta draufsteht or so and then there's 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.130
 a picture report therefore we are on everyone 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.540
 Everybody is curious but it is 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.519
 to see again how creative 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.200
 The people are always there when it comes to it 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:37.330
 to reinvent new drugs again 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.100
 to put together a mix and how to do it 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.019
 Just give it a shit like 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.850
 The effect can be on your customers 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:44.590
 or consumers and whether they are so 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.420
 people are killing people like that 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.819
 pills where the effect needs to 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.590
 it was only a question of 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:52.840
 time until the first person in mind 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.180
 dies no idea but I think for 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.459
 So I call her drug designer now 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.140
 it is simply times or drug cooks 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:00.790
 probably not because of that 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.220
 bad because they are not right this 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.180
 have an impact on their actions 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.190
 You can see that in breaking bad , too 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.959
 actually quite good the heisenberg 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.299
 For example , he cooks all the time 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:11.950
 but really the effect in the beginning 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:13.480
 At least he can not do that yet 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.890
 properly seen from the customer that they 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.480
 then only the dealer or so if he 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.340
 Who does he see anything about? 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.810
 Well, what do you say to that ? 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.250
 incident my dear friends write it 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.620
 me as always in the comments 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.540
 That 's it for today, the world is ahead 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.870
 leave the fingers of the stuff and fit 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.870
 on you
