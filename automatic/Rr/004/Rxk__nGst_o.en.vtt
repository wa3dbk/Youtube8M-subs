 what insult genres at the beginning of 

00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:06.560
 video is plagiarism that no but in 

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:07.999

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:12.410
 hi I do not know if you noticed 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.700
 but in the feathers of cars under 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:15.560
 what is this plagiarism of podcasters 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.449
 lambda hello I am olive bus 

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:18.740
 alas my client there he had a hapax 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:19.910
 its windscreen smaller than a piece 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.529
 two euro is there any exchange 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:25.159

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:29.749
 falls 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.319
 hello and welcome to this 

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:36.489
 is already called 

00:00:30.319 --> 00:00:36.489
 it in your ass on va the credits 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.330
 m 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.850
 1 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.950
 okay 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.540
 the 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.940
 take full advantage of the city with 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:09.810
 new citroën c1 from 80 euros 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:11.610
 per month guaranteed 4 years included citroën 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.600
 good when you see this ad 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.800
 what do you say to yourself I count 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.150
 really ask ourselves the question at each 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.080
 time why not because it should 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.460
 that you make it clear that you 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.020
 will never get the answer no but 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.490
 to confess everything in fact it's because 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.780
 that I did not say anything when I saw the ad 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.950
 so here you are doing your 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.240
 episode without knowing what you're going 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.620
 to speak I had written my twenty three years 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.580
 you decide to come and fuck me 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:33.920
 can see it took a page more 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:33.920
 yes I do not know how to talk about the guy 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.100
 1 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.850
 honestly it would not be huge if we 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.380
 could recover what we see on a 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.000
 poster or in a good magazine I admit 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.200
 it's not very credible but me is the 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.520
 pub I really believed that all 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.520
 bus stops lead somewhere on 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.039
 yeah bah it does not work you can not 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.240
 that I not leave the pub now 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:01.740
 so I looked for how they could 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.240
 realize this ad that's why I 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.409
 will you propose 5 theory you have 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.640
 really have problems by force of 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.869
 plagiarize ben what what could 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:13.530
 to arrive well you really believe that but 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:15.330
 he would bother to call me 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.920
 water an asshole this is my show that 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.660
 you're plagiarizing the a5 theory all 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.430
 that you can see from the left, but since 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.959
 you have no talent what I see vinci 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.299
 continue I beg you where there was my 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:28.010
 number of what's good well it's him 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:28.010
 welcome to episode 1 of 4 theory 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.440
 I you model the bus stop with 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.269
 the billboard 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.760
 look at the property because it took me 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:37.650
 an hour to do it here I hope 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.569
 that you who is good at first 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.750
 look like that nothing abnormal but 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:43.410
 if I move to the side and yes with 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.879
 the right angle 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.900
 the illusion is perfect the problem 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:47.670
 is that even though this theory is 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.079
 nice that can not be that since 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.000
 when the guy runs to the car he 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:53.480
 is supposed to go overboard here except 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.480
 we do not see 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.790
 the guy is dead and the ghost wade girl 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.349
 indeed we notice that only the girl 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.580
 calculates the guy at the beginning he runs for 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:01.810
 catch his bus and everyone is 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.040
 do not you care what is normal in the 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.819
 actual world in fact and then blu ray 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.290
 but running through the panel 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:06.580
 advertising after all the same then yes 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.720
 I know there are some smart guys who are going 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.920
 tell me but what proves you 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.090
 that there is really a window and who thinks 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.530
 that it will question the 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.150
 theory is good at all that I want 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.500
 to tell them no because even if they 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.790
 had no window you explain to me 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.970
 how his foot goes through the stop 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.970
 of bus 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.550
 this theory is rather likely the 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.900
 girl had to take substances 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:24.010
 this is why she sees 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.180
 totally improbable stuff 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.120
 hence the head she draws at the end of the 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.230
 tour pub or so that's because 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:34.690
 wears a helmet that works at 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:36.130
 depleted uranium so yes I know it 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.750
 there are some who will say it's not a little bit of 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.860
 fouting mouth this theory not the 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.690
 everything because I'm going to talk to you about a 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.890
 mounting wrongly done so yes some 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:43.269
 will say it's not because the foot of 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:44.680
 guy goes through the panel that's 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:46.000
 it's the lf-a no but it's a 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.470
 detail compared to the fake fittings I 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.610
 you showed up and that's it it's gone again 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.170
 yeah but here it's fake fittings 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:51.640
 rather particular the guys they have 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.120
 succeeded in inventing a new type of 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.380
 false fittings 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.350
 I called the wrong connections 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.730
 more gange of more gay since how do you 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:59.109
 say this thing it's the hospital that 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.640
 under the charity and the no case why 

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:02.950
 the guy named tall jonathan tall 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.420
 yarzé and then shit and you make us 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.709
 crave for good doppelganger mode 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.540
 before you talk about this famous fake 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:10.030
 fitting to the unpronounceable name criteria 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.709
 but no black face two ging pullovers 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:13.269
 this one I remind you what it is 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:14.560
 that a real fake fittings an example 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:15.940
 perfect in my second episode that 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.380
 it is far from perfect we see 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.940
 the screen of their graduation and then extinguished 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.410
 it's a fake normal fitting but the 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.910
 fort in copenhagen inger it's a lot 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:22.900
 easier it allows to split the 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.340
 people indeed if we observe 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.510
 carefully the ad we can notice 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.190
 first of all that people to face like 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:28.390
 for fun I do not know where you 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.770
 might have wanted to be there but a 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:30.070
 rather strange phenomenon is taking place under our 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.600
 eyes 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.919
 if we take a closer look at this guy there 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.270
 strangely like this one the 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:36.900
 people who are spending here are getting really 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:39.070
 quickly on the pedestrian crossing 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.479
 so here you go tell me yes but you 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.800
 we take for idiots it's just a 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:42.789
 guy who looks a little like another and 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.200
 people who walk very fast 

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:45.729
 yeah but no unless you explain to me 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.890
 how this black guy gets to be here 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:49.870
 and there or how the guy with 

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:51.100
 his bag harry m here and there and also the 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:52.389
 guy who can not get through 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.010
 take the position of these two 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:55.990
 people forty two seconds and there 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:56.979
 paf the guy in red has disappeared while 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:57.590
 the others are still there and we 

00:04:56.979 --> 00:04:59.450
 found 2 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:00.740
 later there but when the guys they have 

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:02.210
 invented this fake fittings he wanted 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:03.860
 still more of human doubled 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:06.260
 it was more than enough so they 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:11.120
 decided to create the fake fittings ta ta 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:14.270
 ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta dam the 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:15.410
 false fittings ta ta ta ta ta ta ta 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:18.460
 do you have any ladies 

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:18.460
 yes finally I mean the false agreement 

00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:28.590
 but then still tintin 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.080
 at 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:39.780
 bannon good look at this car at 

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:42.950
 time but you're sure you're not confusing 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:42.950
 with another fake fittings which 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:51.060
 no good looking at this car it's a 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:53.730
 citroën like this one actually 

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:55.830
 bassel the end briefly look she goes 

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:57.630
 behind a bus shelter and then nothing 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:00.560
 finally if it reappears 10 seconds 

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:00.560
 later there 

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:08.910
 ah yes otherwise I think the guy feels 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:08.910
 the more the taxi in citroën 

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:14.060
 this was episode 5 like you 

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:15.320
 could have noticed this episode it's 

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:16.400
 a bit particular since it does not leave 

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.690
 in every sense are in the others 

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.740
 pubs I hope you'll like it when 

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:19.940
 even I wanted to try 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:21.830
 you can always join the page 

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:23.540
 facebook and then share the video if 

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:24.860
 you enjoyed it in the meantime do you wear 

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:27.280
 well and I tell you very quickly for the 

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:27.280
 next video
