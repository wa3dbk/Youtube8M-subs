00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 only you guys want the nerds is that this 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.819
 new more goals with one more gameplay 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.819
 car to joke 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:15.860
 This time I'm recording the video here. 

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:17.630
 because there are already ten more videos here 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:19.849
 channel and it's been a while since I 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.590
 pornographic video let's games is what it is 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:23.090
 talk a little here with you about 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.119
 this things 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:29.169
 will see it 's worth it if it does yesterday 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:33.469
 January 8 will be the announcement Pokémon 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:36.829
 x pokémon y or english pokémon black e 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:39.800
 pokémon white and this is one of the biggest 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:41.510
 evidence all over the activity of 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.620
 people who name the game a little 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.660
 wind 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:50.720
 Follow me with me at the beginning. 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:53.450
 Pokémon edge and thats the basic things 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.380
 municipalities making sense because the game 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:55.790
 it was in black and white 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:01:01.940
 then we had some stones 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:06.460
 precious with pokémon gold silver bronze 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:10.280
 it was not the third generation we had 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:13.840
 Emerald Sapphire Maria of the neighborhood 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:18.229
 in the fourth generation of beautiful diamond 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:20.510
 garden and I finally in the fifth generation 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:22.460
 that's just punctual now we've had 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:24.680
 michael jackson pokémon 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:28.640
 with the launch of the sixth generation of 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:31.190
 pokémons we have a pokémon x 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:34.610
 y that must be an analogy 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:36.740
 math is clear because if it is 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.200
 here I did an exact course in college 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:42.619
 see pokémon x and y 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.600
 every day opel choose you heuristic 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:47.090
 What the hell is this? I think it's 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:50.330
 evolving so euric that evolved to 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:53.330
 its simpler is not just for 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:56.020
 speak badly of the name of the game pokémon 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:58.430
 It's really to talk a little about 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.369
 prejudice that some people have with 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:04.399
 the new generations pokémon new generations 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:06.800
 a coincidence of the third generation 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:10.100
 The bug is your emerald daughter . 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:12.220
 prejudice and there is so much 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.360
 many people including the euro 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.239
 grew up watching Pokémon 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.760
 So we came home at school. 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:21.769
 and she turned on the television a pass a 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.290
 little madness comes late on foot and 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:25.910
 When I got to school later, I was there. 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.010
 How were you with your classmates? 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:31.160
 draw the 0 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.989
 The problem is that a little long nor 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:36.200
 It was always just an example. 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:38.900
 in fact the pokémon started from the game 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:42.470
 the cartoon was adapted from the game 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:45.380
 pokémon and no ooo game was the tonic 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:49.220
 with many genius games then the pokémon 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:51.380
 in fact the essence of the people as it is 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.590
 in game boy games and the variations that 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:57.019
 i bought it for nintendo consoles 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:03:00.170
 so many people stopped 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:02.660
 watch pokemon the drawing from the 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:05.750
 third direction that was when a 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:07.910
 design and there 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.880
 where you go with the open television and 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:14.690
 started happening only on cable television and 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:17.090
 because of this people will not play 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:20.630
 more pokémon games 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:26.330
 but as the fan of nintendo 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:30.070
 I never quit fighting and have until 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:33.170
 here is not prescribed in 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:35.390
 we are the champions 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:38.000
 I am showing much less those 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:40.489
 accustomed to the public at last the people 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.989
 who only liked the Pokémon of the 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:47.090
 first and second generation have ended 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:49.970
 a little prejudice with pokémons 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.950
 who have had the following not long ago 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:54.110
 sense because pokémon as well as 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.280
 any other anime game that made 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:58.220
 very successful 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:00.320
 evolved and continues to evolve 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:02.540
 have time that the basic animals end 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:05.090
 so you can play placed a 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:07.070
 maracutaia there paint another different color 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.560
 and gives a name similar to the animal and 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:10.750
 ready that has one pokémon but by another 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:14.239
 sex 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:16.729
 the game has evolved and developed into the 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:19.040
 best season in the most competitive games 

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:20.720
 From Japan you have tournament being 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.850
 performed at each corner thanks to 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.830
 street near s team 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:28.610
 for example you can find 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:31.580
 people with 3ds passing on the same street 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:34.010
 You and there then are some tapes. 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:36.290
 what happens inside the game that if you 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:38.840
 find the person you're beautiful has 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:42.050
 That sort of thing is very cool. 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:44.780
 because you have a community of gamers 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:48.620
 that extrapolates the game 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:50.870
 digital media and passes the actual plan was 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:53.140
 because of this I also bought only 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.140
 hence 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:03.770
 this is the pokéwalker he is very 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:07.280
 positive that puts a pokémon of the game 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:08.960
 of nintendo ds here and the more it passes 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.000
 You give a little is not winning. 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.340
 experience later when you take 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.770
 pokémon went up to say the 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:17.330
 It's true, I bought one here so I can 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:19.870
 be a little home and start doing 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:22.070
 gym but I found out it was more 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:24.020
 easy you see the pokémons you 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:26.600
 arrest of the fan and inapa 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:29.320
 lets call there and go up much more 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.320
 fast 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:38.430
 well then I'll stay around here I hope 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:41.010
 did you like 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:42.990
 this was just a spy about the game 

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:44.640
 Pokemon expected enough now 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:46.530
 will be released in October 

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:50.040
 I want to buy 13 10 and I think it will 

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:52.080
 do well in the game so if you have 

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:55.440
 Prejudice against Pokemon Your Look One 

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:57.270
 little on the other side of the coin and games 

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:59.610
 new beings games worth 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:00.840
 Interviewed you also like the video 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:03.090
 design 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:06.690
 the only bad scene is sign up for my channel 

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:08.430
 It was quite my work then for now. 

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:10.670
 talk about getting women to start picking up 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:12.840
 pokémons because it's worth much more 

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:18.330
 until the next 

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:20.850
 such that this old thing will have even is not the 

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:26.510
 happy hour is an airplane 

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:26.510
 It was me that I just did not pay
