00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.120
 mr. franz today here in vienna after the 

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:09.870
 star alliance executive board meeting 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.519
 what did you decide so first 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.469
 we have ever looked back as we 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.059
 what the customers have come up with is progress 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.789
 quality is concerned so we are looking 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.390
 regular customer feedback surveys to attend 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.260
 To ensure that the 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.820
 We promise the customer the best possible performance 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.650
 within the star alliance too 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.599
 then be respected and indeed by 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.279
 all carriers are respected 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.529
 the customers can rely on it 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.559
 that you have certain privileges you 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.780
 with us in the net have to really without 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.040
 to fly through our networks 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.450
 so that they get that too 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.860
 We are very satisfied 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.250
 with the progress 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:47.100
 the second is we have ours 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.840
 Environment also looked at the 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.219
 Competition is changing and there has to be 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.129
 we ask ourselves the question how governs 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.809
 on a steel 1 on it then that is 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.610
 strategic considerations the no 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.230
 short-term but the course 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.809
 have medium-term relevance 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.640
 and last but not least we are at two 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.549
 make it very concrete 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:09.960
 because it was about the question our 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:11.310
 global network structure, so to speak 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.500
 to fill where we still today 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.189
 white spots have once quite concretely 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:19.979
 in which we have offered to the air india 

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:20.880
 again the effort, so to speak 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.380
 take 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:27.180
 to get into the stahel 1 and here is 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.600
 he accepts as a candidate in year 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.720
 been 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.619
 and the second is that the 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.380
 sister company of our star 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.320
 carriers avianca namely the daughter 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:40.049
 respectively sister in brazil 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:43.259
 also makes itself on the way here, so to speak 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:45.750
 a preferred partner for steel 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.000
 to become one which is important to us 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.090
 after the star partner tam in 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.880
 brazil now almost with the 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.920
 Chilean lan network 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.869
 for what reason are terminated 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.509
 the Lufthansa Group announced this 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.340
 codeshare with turkish airlines that were 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:05.880
 purely commercial reasons 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:08.330
 we have no obligation here 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.619
 frame of the star lines with all carriern 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.269
 absolutely to make coaches 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.819
 We also have that with certain 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:17.840
 other guy yes not and we have to 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:20.340
 with all, so to speak, linking 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.110
 within the loan still the 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.840
 responsibility for our own results 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.700
 wear and do something like kojak 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.230
 belt then you have to look worthwhile 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.580
 this is still in our view or 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.049
 just not and then you too 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.180
 Cognition is no longer worthwhile 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:34.980
 then you can then at all 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.750
 friendship in the star alliance too 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.549
 the competitive thoughts then times 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.080
 carry bill and then here in this 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:42.480
 If so, we can say that now 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.549
 unfortunately not continue currently where 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.099
 they are talking about competition 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:49.170
 see the entry of etihad 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:51.329
 airways trader swiss regional 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:54.540
 airline darwin with the 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:56.910
 brand name eth original as one 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.730
 Frontal attack on Lufthansa in the regional 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:02.940
 flight area yes that 's already one 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:05.220
 direct competitive train here 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.500
 as it were in the world-wide master 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:10.139
 chess game made by the act 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.970
 has been and that is competition 

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:12.690
 we know with that we sit down 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.769
 apart 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.730
 By the way, very concrete today 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:20.940
 available 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:23.310
 because the etihad airways has over 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:26.069
 their participation in airberlin today 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.379
 already indirectly a corresponding 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:31.170
 comparably large participation in the 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:32.780
 wave also stationed in Zurich 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:36.480
 So they have two in the future 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:38.069
 holdings in the Zurich and 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.889
 will be interesting to watch what 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:43.379
 on the spot there are on the part of the 

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:45.569
 Lufthansa plans again a turboprop 

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:46.230
 build up fleet and as up germanwings 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:48.629
 slip 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:51.359
 even at airports which are not now 

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:53.790
 be sure to pull the so-called airport 

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:55.829
 and that means under Lufthansa 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.579
 journal also smaller airports again 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:58.560
 to fly 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:01.379
 to such plans, there are currently 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:04.620
 not what plans do you have for 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:06.569
 Christmas will be the Christmas one 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.139
 year of course with my big family 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:08.819
 spend 

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:11.670
 and I'm looking forward to that because it is 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:14.040
 always a moment even a 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.599
 to think of others, too 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.840
 to leave the profession behind 

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:21.889
 a few contemplative quieter days and 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:24.540
 at the same time the conversation again 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:25.669
 dialog and the cohesion in the 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.780
 to promote family 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:30.450
 and how is the cohesion in the 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.760
 lufthansa board in relation to the invention 

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:33.840
 her successor 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:35.430
 I can not tell you that 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.930
 it is not the task of the board 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.550
 but to the supervisory board 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.620
 I know that the supervisory board 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:42.330
 therefore cares intensely about it but 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.100
 that is the responsibility of the 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.660
 supervisory board here my successor 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:47.940
 but there I am very much 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:50.760
 confident that its excellent 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:52.290
 successor is found for me then 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.370
 may i give you nice christmas and 

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:56.010
 Happy New Year 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:57.360
 wish and much success for 2014 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:00.410
 thank it if I before him 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.410
 Christmas thank you
