00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.750
 bringing next a small video to 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:33.200
 help you all with this team 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:36.140
 zte v9 70 m good this video is for 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.360
 teach a rom if you want a rumba 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.840
 quite stable is to say another version 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:44.260
 of android for your android 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:48.140
 so I invite you to install rapier 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.810
 it's android 411 leave living 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.900
 okay 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:54.880
 and also has no defect 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:57.670
 ok with regard to what would be the 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:59.500
 storage applications as 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.870
 can you see my memory what I have 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.660
 there and also here storage 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:08.050
 internal if you already have your memory 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:09.730
 unified of 2.5 gigabytes for the same 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:14.490
 they are going to be this way for example here I have 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:16.480
 good one hundred I have 2.5 gigabytes and free 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.700
 external storage or what you 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:21.370
 Okay, well, we can move it 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.790
 applications the sd card say to the 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:23.790
 external 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:27.820
 although it will effectively move 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.540
 internal storage or that is already 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:33.970
 he has moved that he already has a good chulito 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:36.850
 something else what we are movistar ok 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.560
 movistar of a single chip that only 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.260
 we have to use movistar then 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.880
 we have that will be the next step already 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.580
 that will not read us what would be the 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:48.010
 movistar signal and what are they from movistar 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.720
 and digitel double and double Incas 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:52.810
 then if you are going to read them or that is 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.400
 this step no no it will not affect you or that 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.400
 you do not have to do this step 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.900
 just install it and I was for you 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:02.020
 there another application and it's ready that 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:04.720
 let's open the administrator in which 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.820
 we have or that we have what 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.860
 we open and we go to what we have 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.500
 downloaded ok rest I have it here 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:14.070
 and we are going to install the root explorer and 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.070
 we install 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.960
 We waited a little bit and opened it 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.180
 also allows since external explorer 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.800
 is for the user equal all 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.500
 just rooted the android 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.570
 let's go where sd card says and we're going to 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.130
 go back to the folder that you have 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:33.200
 downloaded ok but already with root 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:36.290
 explorer then we open the folder 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:41.510
 this mobile and emme ok we're going to this 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:44.030
 copy copy blocks back again and 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.500
 we go where it says there are ok here in the 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.170
 back side let's go where it says 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:51.950
 system and give up let's move on to what 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:54.320
 it would be etc a folder ok then we go down 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.989
 a little bit and here is framework though 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.910
 in freeware let's open ok 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:01.489
 how can you see this in this way 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.959
 of millions that I'm pointing out is the 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:04.610
 that we have to eliminate and paste the 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:08.300
 new that I left you ok 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:10.459
 good here riding ere or if you are if what 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:13.280
 they let dismantle the roll of as well as 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:14.600
 they see it here so it's not going to leave you 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.270
 to trace 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:20.870
 ok so and then now we are going to 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:21.890
 eliminate this model eliminate love in 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.770
 yes 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.540
 and we paste the new one that once stuck 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:29.330
 let's change the permissions so that 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.220
 why then so that it serves us ok if 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:32.930
 not if we do not change the permits 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.770
 will serve us then we will 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:39.709
 take away these three let's mark this 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:43.070
 this is another one that is here and this other 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:44.810
 that these three those four the whole row 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:47.180
 first and one of the second that would be 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:49.610
 this we mark those four and we're going to 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:53.690
 accept and there simply we can no longer 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:56.270
 we go out we make a small one we give him where 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:58.640
 it says reboot in just turn off intention 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:01.220
 if we give in recovery mode it 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:05.480
 will go to tour me if they want what 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:07.730
 they can turn it on and off ok well ya 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:10.010
 I explained how to have julie and they are not going to 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:11.300
 have no problem ok that this 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:11.959
 step that is going to be here then we are going to 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:14.060
 do both 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:17.359
 movistar digitel and simply movistar 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:18.680
 since then with respect to the camera 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:22.190
 It has changed this step to be 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:25.610
 here ok the camera because as you know 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:29.360
 they brought the 4.0 but then like this 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:32.120
 living 411 because he would like no no me 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:36.520
 would like to leave the camera that of 4.0 so 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:40.710
 that have left this brings 4,102 points 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:42.969
 let's take a small picture 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:46.179
 okay 

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:48.189
 here is how you can see this is the 

00:04:46.179 --> 00:04:50.799
 picture then what are we going to do 

00:04:48.189 --> 00:04:53.349
 is to pencil where I'm stinging and 

00:04:50.799 --> 00:04:54.879
 now I give it to him there says he has stopped the 

00:04:53.349 --> 00:04:57.189
 good application as we do not solve 

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:59.799
 this very easy we go to what we have 

00:04:57.189 --> 00:05:01.430
 downloaded that and we're going to install 

00:04:59.799 --> 00:05:04.430
 is 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:07.520
 ok in this gallery to replace 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:10.180
 accept and well wait for it to be 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.180
 install a little 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:21.870
 we go ready and now we are going to open the 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:21.870
 camera 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:27.440
 let's move on to what would be the photo and 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:30.860
 Now we can already give the pencil and 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:32.720
 simply because it will not have any 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:35.000
 problem with all this that is no longer going 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:38.090
 to have problems then we can already 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:41.240
 edit our photos and make many 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:44.420
 things there without any inconvenience and 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:46.370
