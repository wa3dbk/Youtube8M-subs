pulldown to sound alarm this is my

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.270 
pulldown to sound alarm this is my
homemade<00:00:05.490> fire<00:00:05.879> alarm<00:00:06.240> system<00:00:06.870> and<00:00:07.220> this<00:00:08.220> is

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
homemade fire alarm system and this is

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.509 
homemade fire alarm system and this is
the<00:00:08.580> pull<00:00:08.790> station<00:00:10.070> so<00:00:11.070> now<00:00:11.219> we're<00:00:11.340> going<00:00:11.429> to

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
the pull station so now we're going to

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.089 
the pull station so now we're going to
pull<00:00:11.700> it<00:00:11.880> and<00:00:12.059> reset<00:00:12.509> it<00:00:12.679> show<00:00:13.679> you<00:00:13.740> how<00:00:13.980> it

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
pull it and reset it show you how it

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.810 
pull it and reset it show you how it
works<00:00:14.990> first<00:00:16.010> basically<00:00:17.010> back<00:00:17.220> there<00:00:17.520> is<00:00:17.760> a

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
works first basically back there is a

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.470 
works first basically back there is a
wall<00:00:18.539> plate<00:00:18.840> with<00:00:19.770> a<00:00:19.800> switch<00:00:20.580> attached<00:00:20.970> make

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
wall plate with a switch attached make

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.560 
wall plate with a switch attached make
sure<00:00:21.660> see<00:00:22.529> it<00:00:22.650> that<00:00:22.890> the<00:00:23.880> back<00:00:24.119> of<00:00:24.300> the<00:00:24.359> switch

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
sure see it that the back of the switch

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.130 
sure see it that the back of the switch
is<00:00:24.779> right<00:00:25.080> in<00:00:25.199> there<00:00:25.939> anyways<00:00:26.939> let's<00:00:27.720> pull<00:00:28.019> it

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
is right in there anyways let's pull it

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.589 
is right in there anyways let's pull it
and<00:00:28.230> reset<00:00:28.650> it<00:00:28.849> so<00:00:29.849> you<00:00:29.939> pull<00:00:30.179> it<00:00:30.300> you<00:00:30.480> just

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
and reset it so you pull it you just

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.740 
and reset it so you pull it you just
grab<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:30.810> handle<00:00:31.349> pull<00:00:31.740> it<00:00:31.859> down<00:00:32.540> like<00:00:33.540> those

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
grab the handle pull it down like those

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.560 
grab the handle pull it down like those
simplex<00:00:34.230> t-handle<00:00:34.829> things<00:00:35.660> next<00:00:36.660> to<00:00:36.930> reset<00:00:37.710> it

now<00:01:03.090> it's<00:01:03.270> reset<00:01:03.690> now<00:01:04.320> for<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.650> alarms<00:01:08.960> it's

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
now it's reset now for the alarms it's

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.070 
now it's reset now for the alarms it's
the<00:01:10.140> first<00:01:10.409> alarm<00:01:10.770> and<00:01:11.240> the<00:01:12.240> other<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:12.750> the

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
the first alarm and the other and the

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.410 
the first alarm and the other and the
second<00:01:13.439> one<00:01:13.530> down<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.610> hallway<00:01:15.000> over<00:01:15.150> there

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
second one down the hallway over there

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.130 
second one down the hallway over there
is<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.110> same<00:01:16.350> similar<00:01:17.330> this<00:01:18.330> here<00:01:18.659> is<00:01:18.810> a

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
is the same similar this here is a

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.950 
is the same similar this here is a
former<00:01:19.619> computer<00:01:20.100> speaker<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:20.700> it<00:01:21.420> says<00:01:21.630> fire

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
former computer speaker and it says fire

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.560 
former computer speaker and it says fire
and<00:01:22.290> it's<00:01:23.280> just<00:01:23.610> taped<00:01:23.850> because<00:01:24.210> this<00:01:24.390> is<00:01:24.540> a

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
and it's just taped because this is a

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.140 
and it's just taped because this is a
prototype<00:01:25.460> someday<00:01:26.460> I'll<00:01:26.610> have<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.939> real

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
prototype someday I'll have the real

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.530 
prototype someday I'll have the real
thing<00:01:27.380> connected<00:01:28.380> to<00:01:28.530> my<00:01:28.710> control<00:01:29.189> unit<00:01:29.579> which

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
thing connected to my control unit which

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:38.300 
thing connected to my control unit which
I'll<00:01:30.720> show<00:01:30.930> you<00:01:30.990> in<00:01:31.229> a<00:01:31.290> bit<00:01:31.320> now<00:01:36.799> here<00:01:37.799> is<00:01:38.040> the

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
I'll show you in a bit now here is the

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.450 
I'll show you in a bit now here is the
other<00:01:38.400> one<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:39.180> other<00:01:39.210> alarm<00:01:40.280> next<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.369> its

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
other one the other alarm next to its

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:47.969 
other one the other alarm next to its
smoke<00:01:41.790> detector

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:47.979 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:50.919 

coming<00:01:48.979> down<00:01:49.130> the<00:01:49.189> stairs<00:01:49.670> we've<00:01:50.539> got<00:01:50.780> the

00:01:50.919 --> 00:01:50.929 
coming down the stairs we've got the

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:53.499 
coming down the stairs we've got the
other<00:01:51.049> pull<00:01:51.439> station<00:01:52.030> and<00:01:53.030> I'm<00:01:53.149> just<00:01:53.329> going<00:01:53.479> to

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:53.509 
other pull station and I'm just going to

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:55.300 
other pull station and I'm just going to
pull<00:01:53.689> this<00:01:53.840> so<00:01:54.020> I<00:01:54.079> can<00:01:54.259> demonstrate<00:01:54.500> the

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
pull this so I can demonstrate the

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:03.600 
pull this so I can demonstrate the
control<00:01:55.700> panel<00:02:00.759> here's<00:02:01.759> season<00:02:02.390> r3<00:02:02.899> and

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
control panel here's season r3 and

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.789 
control panel here's season r3 and
here's<00:02:04.610> a<00:02:04.670> control<00:02:05.090> panel<00:02:05.360> the<00:02:06.289> little<00:02:06.590> green

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:06.799 
here's a control panel the little green

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:08.469 
here's a control panel the little green
light<00:02:07.039> on<00:02:07.280> the<00:02:07.399> control<00:02:07.670> panel<00:02:08.090> says

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
light on the control panel says

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.789 
light on the control panel says
operational<00:02:10.000> that<00:02:11.000> little<00:02:11.269> that<00:02:11.810> control

00:02:12.789 --> 00:02:12.799 
operational that little that control

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:15.160 
operational that little that control
panel<00:02:13.160> employing<00:02:13.489> at<00:02:13.730> what<00:02:14.599> produces<00:02:15.049> the

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
panel employing at what produces the

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.640 
panel employing at what produces the
noise<00:02:16.090> transistor<00:02:17.090> is<00:02:17.239> amplify<00:02:17.720> and<00:02:18.049> then

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
noise transistor is amplify and then

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.670 
noise transistor is amplify and then
that<00:02:18.799> amplifier<00:02:19.340> amplifies<00:02:20.060> it<00:02:20.269> more<00:02:20.620> so<00:02:21.620> I'm

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
that amplifier amplifies it more so I'm

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.680 
that amplifier amplifies it more so I'm
going<00:02:21.799> to<00:02:21.829> reset<00:02:22.130> that<00:02:23.319> before<00:02:25.180> or<00:02:26.180> it<00:02:26.209> gets<00:02:26.510> on

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
going to reset that before or it gets on

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:27.370 
going to reset that before or it gets on
my<00:02:26.810> nerves

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
my nerves

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:33.940
