00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.990
 hello michel desjoyeaux it's okay 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:09.570
 except you and me it can go but we will talk about the meeting the first 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.740
 match of the season so in cfa 2 we remember it since this team 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.359
 reserved descended a notch sct abbas to have% 1 this sunday 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:23.470
 first match first defeat 1 goal 0% how did it go? 

00:00:23.469 --> 00:00:25.789
 at this meeting 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:27.300
 I think that 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.899
 on the content of the match less 

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:31.899
 but responds deserves no 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.450
 they were much more realistic than we refuse a crazy class we 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.820
 have two hours fifteen years 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:39.990
 on the 2 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.950
 his effort on the whole game part at wholesale 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.270
 besides the houses 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.980
 proceed against and they managed to score 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.650
 we are trying to push towards the end of May 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.650
 for me not in shape has lacked determination 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.800
 appeared to me equalized tarbes either 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.850
 - it was a balma team that you expect a little awlaki awlaki process 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:03.040
 years against 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.590
 burgundy is expected like that usually the form expect a 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.700
 little bit on the move in the sense that clermont 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.550
 but of course 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:16.470
 I think there all year long the good wingers the sooner we wait 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.420
 three weeks behind m proceeding against 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.050
 after a set it helps us 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.520
 of two played differently 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.550
 to keep the ball round the glass to take the time 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.640
 he was procuring the pure 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.070
 a little more case dakar what it is 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.370
 precisely so this team reserves by hand 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.870
 pass from cfa pretty bland 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:42.580
 it was the soap opera of the summer a cpe not yet quite girl 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.580
 until the last moment to come here it's clear it's cfa2 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:47.630
 what is a little bit 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.459
 bitterness anyway to go down in cfa 2 what changes too 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.780
 the child we talked about a lot with the coach and the club 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.870
 however with feet 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:03.200
 I will only be the coach mentonnais often running 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.150
 and the end 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.619
 when he told us we were in cfa 2 we felt a little injustice 

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:11.299
 we say yvon back finally we did not deserve it 

00:02:11.939 --> 00:02:15.959
 but good after having dark like that stuck footballer now 

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:19.029
 we raise the head and 

00:02:19.029 --> 00:02:21.959
 we continue in the grand slam championship cfa2 which is still 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:22.699
 not nothing 

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:24.779
 because good championship and I think that 

00:02:24.779 --> 00:02:28.109
 this year the level cfa cfa2 can wait pretty much 

00:02:30.419 --> 00:02:34.989
 it is recalled that there is a lot of reserve as soon as the project pak in cfa2 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:38.709
 so marseille because division honor I believe the reserve 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:42.079
 a candy is always a good championship and just and I imagine that 

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:43.379
 here you have also 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:44.260
 at heart of 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.660
 the tablet will avenge you to go back as quickly as possible in cfa 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.779
 but we remain on the same subject of what they have to do 

00:02:50.779 --> 00:02:52.239
 m a misstep 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:55.359
 I think that the feet can not really want to 

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:58.629
 two donuts given this year will be able to go up since 

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:00.019
 quickly possible 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:01.939
 after having 

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:04.939
 all that without it will not be but I think in the years that have 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:09.019
 efforts in the reserve and people in this direction 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:11.379
 this team reserves 

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:14.930
 these meetings any way this season with a lot of young people from 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.149
 buildings f 

00:03:16.149 --> 00:03:19.699
 montage it has nothing to do with Team 2 from last season and 

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:24.339
 automatisms to find many many young people who have integrated the 

00:03:24.339 --> 00:03:27.239
 reserve muller to rumors 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.740
 we have a young team but hey I think it takes 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:32.369
 that we stop taking refuge above 

00:03:32.369 --> 00:03:33.439
 personally 

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:35.859
 we have a team to play ball 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:39.009
 even if we are not yet mature enough to play against 

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:42.789
 teams of cfa have apparently 

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:46.169
 I think in CFA 2 hours 

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:48.389
 we'll be fine 

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:50.489
 this is my ladies, I think 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:53.089
 the 91 92 

00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:54.449
 really a luggage 

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:56.149
 very interesting 

00:03:56.149 --> 00:03:57.469
 and now 

00:03:57.469 --> 00:04:00.869
 after the friendlies we have to do I think so 

00:04:00.869 --> 00:04:04.049
 we can eat together ten years we create ourselves 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:07.540
 internally week michele without chasing the new captain of 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.030
 this team reserves 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.339
 in short, what does it do and to be captain 

00:04:12.339 --> 00:04:14.549
 to book girondins de bordeaux 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:15.510
 you must forget 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:18.840
 I was a little surprised that 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.319
 man same time frank 

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:23.069
 I sing rainy changshu to his 

00:04:23.069 --> 00:04:25.150
 but personally 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:27.360
 old charterer constraints and 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.430
 this is the first time it has happened to me since it was 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.430
 I play football 

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:38.560
 for me not for me that all this will happen bearing the balance 

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:42.930
 it's exactly that after everyone has 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:44.949
 spend 

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:47.629
 all the skeptics who reports the testimonies of permanent employees 

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:52.020
 for art to have a role maybe you say you did not know before the 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.110
 fire a character that would be enough you still need 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.360
 in the very strong team it's a bit that also tonight we're on the 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.430
 ground 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:03.249
 frankly what can I bring anyway 

00:05:03.249 --> 00:05:06.389
 an experience from last year m 

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:09.389
 since bombay realize a little of the two youngest 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.990
 but now I think so 

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:16.310
 aberration whether it's on a personal level always 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:19.530
 % we remember that he had had two three small physical glitches the season 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:20.139
 latest 

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:22.229
 everything is better today 

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:24.170
 to consider a full season end 

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:25.810
 and show all its qualities 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:27.039
 then we ask 

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:29.509
 my beginning of preparation 

00:05:29.509 --> 00:05:32.659
 small worries still muscular in May 

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:35.969
 but nothing bad I'm preparing well 

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:39.379
 I strengthened everything is good thinking brown hair 

00:05:39.379 --> 00:05:43.279
 the qualities if we can talk about it in terms of knowing is not yet 

00:05:43.279 --> 00:05:47.249
 for the moment good head game good timing it was pirola building had 

00:05:47.249 --> 00:05:48.310
 spoken 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:51.469
 it's a bit like that there is plenty of ump 

00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:54.469
 foot technique ranked sixth 

00:05:56.379 --> 00:05:59.929
 laurent wild trip this offer is hard to talk about buffon will not replay 

00:05:59.929 --> 00:06:01.699
 at mans have played so 

00:06:01.699 --> 00:06:05.909
 I can not I can not know those issues there always a decline of 3 

00:06:05.909 --> 00:06:07.409
 45 countries city 

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:11.430
 Putin told me it's a little profile in Bulgaria it's good he had to 

00:06:11.429 --> 00:06:14.429
 in addition to repeat it we love the vivarais 

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:16.900
 after his spectators 

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:20.999
 good anyway if you want to see michelle 100 chairs and his teammates 

00:06:20.999 --> 00:06:25.119
 next game the first home this Sunday in cfa face revel 

00:06:25.119 --> 00:06:27.960
 % and here we are going to try to do well at home 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:30.099
 for me I think what they have 

00:06:30.099 --> 00:06:31.309
 we have at heart of 

00:06:31.309 --> 00:06:33.520
 of play that meet 

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:36.059
 and I think the novel all given 

00:06:36.059 --> 00:06:39.219
 and this same on mac 

00:06:39.219 --> 00:06:41.990
 we hope the gala match as always 

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:45.080
 but what do you think of stores that took place this summer? 

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:47.960
 it was we wish to see the day up to date evenly to a year have 

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:50.360
 possibly sought other groups lose 

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:53.180
 at the front the series right 

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:56.719
 he a little bit austere court is better 

00:06:56.719 --> 00:06:59.059
 maybe a lack of audience maybe if that's what you 

00:06:59.059 --> 00:07:02.059
 would like to find a little more early May 

00:07:02.899 --> 00:07:05.180
 I do not know about this then important 

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:09.460
 you feel good looking at me we got used to flying a year a 

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:10.770
 European 

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:12.439
 I think that 

00:07:12.439 --> 00:07:16.020
 as long as the greens are not here it must be it should go 

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:19.509
 to remember his next match and first home game for the 

00:07:19.509 --> 00:07:22.480
 reserve it is so this Sunday facing revel 

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:25.730
 with one wishes the first victory of the reserve thank you very much michel 

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:28.060
 sanchez to drop on the board of luck for the sequel
