 to wallow again with it popular 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.930
 People 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:28.199
 I have you in the last video already 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.289
 explained that excess of venues 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.610
 can you smile at yourself 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:34.620
 and in which you put yourself at what 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.380
 you give yourself unconscious 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.250
 Confirmation that you are worthy that you 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:43.770
 are worth being popular 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:45.300
 Another tip was the rubber band 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.399
 the rubber then I told you that 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.960
 every time you hate negative aunts 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.860
 about yourself about other people 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.809
 that you remember that this 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.610
 negative thoughts are not constructive 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.760
 it 's not something you're in kind of 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.960
 lives on because I'm in the 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.480
 hand is that you have a positive 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:07.229
 radiation developed ok i want 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:10.350
 build on it and want more 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:13.710
 Tackle time like you into a positive one 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:16.530
 I can develop radiation 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.140
 I see that I am positive music 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.720
 listen to the music that builds me up 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.490
 that inspires me with positive energy 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.799
 I am a big fan of inrev chili 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.200
 peppers and of war and that are 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:31.049
 both styles of music are now two 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.030
 Irish rock in me personally 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.470
 all scary inspiring and me 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.450
 just when I build a house for 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.210
 house goes and I will hear this 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.950
 Positive energy from the singer of 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.720
 its scope of music that builds me up 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.270
 and I go with a fat smile 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.880
 simply through the city and 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.470
 You just notice that other people 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.659
 do not perceive positively 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.479
 that's why I think positive music 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.820
 then very big key to it is 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.310
 that you kind of him better yourself 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:02.100
 feeling positive is that too 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.770
 to others about directly and through others 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.090
 perceive positively 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.759
 more points not quite made in the 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.760
 in the film thinking is getting up at night 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.290
 my motto offers smile 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:17.180
 or that I just sit down and 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:19.620
 yes yes I can do it yes I can do it 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:22.860
 and where you do that you do that 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:26.489
 you would and that safer sex like yes me 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:28.379
 do it or yes I'm worth it in 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:29.849
 you will say that to the duden 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:32.040
 believe it sooner or later 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:34.470
 and if you keep repeating this sentence 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:39.000
 before so I can do it and yes it's me 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:41.579
 then you believe in it and yours 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.280
 own view of the things will 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:46.849
 when you 're completely garrisoning right now 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:50.190
 maybe negative beliefs 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:52.560
 Beliefs called those in yours 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.239
 head and spit that tell you no you 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.420
 can not and you are not 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:59.010
 worth and it is never effective and so so 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.870
 These negative beliefs are bought 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:04.409
 there have you will not progress 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:07.139
 That's why we start with the positive ones 

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:08.730
 to give sentences of faith right after 

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:10.440
 get up and best with 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.190
 body use yes are not just in 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:16.379
 Germany 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:19.650
 okay i'm in a full one 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:21.389
 Body use and constantly playing yes 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.930
 I can turn on such a tin light 

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:28.019
 that gives it a lot of positive energy 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:31.230
 ok i hope this second animal again 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:33.840
 helped to see that you are regular 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.340
 makes it does not help if you only 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.569
 a week in stans and that makes and 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.440
 After that sand is again you have to do that 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:39.989
 do it regularly 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:43.949
 I recommend that at least the 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:45.569
 every day and every day 

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:47.489
 After 30 days you will understand that it is 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:49.500
 automatically that automatically takes you from 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:51.870
 encounters studies and every time he says I 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:55.530
 It can be and the most positive music 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:58.169
 I personally am a big plate 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:00.019

00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:02.280
