00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:24.650
 journalists trying to echo the event 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.130
 In New York, people would get in line to get the new phone 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.070
 but there was not as much expectation as in the release of the original the year 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.150
 past 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.080
 the first of the row were advocates of organic farming that 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.890
 took advantage so that their claim was more impact and at the same time 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.150
 time they wanted to get a guiness record for the longest wait in a queue 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:49.130
 waiting to buy something the first user of the queue of the ap the shade of 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.640
 boston es francisco sold his first phone in venezuela and traveled to 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.910
 boston to buy the 3g version of the iphone for him and his mother

 to be able to go to the service and eat 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.380
 It seems that sleeping did not sleep much 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.020
 the users waiting in the queue of boston missed some 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.700
 features such as the ability to send multimedia messages or the use of 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.430
 copy and paste function 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.280
 although it is easy for fans to defend the terminal 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.240
 They are also aware of their limitations and one of them is the 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.520

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.080
 users were quickly faced with activation problems with the operator 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.320
 or two

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.560
 because the record system was only compatible with the internet browser 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.570
 microsoft explorer 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.430
 and in Spain, as is already known, the terminal activation system of 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:50.270
 telephone failure just when the big-track store opened 28, which caused 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.900
 the frustration of users who had to leave with their terminals 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.260
