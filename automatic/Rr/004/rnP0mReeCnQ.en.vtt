00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:11.869 
erotic movies and you know they were

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:13.300 
erotic movies and you know they were
just<00:01:11.990> they<00:01:12.320> were<00:01:12.350> terrible<00:01:12.950> they<00:01:13.070> were<00:01:13.160> all

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
just they were terrible they were all

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:14.800 
just they were terrible they were all
terrible<00:01:13.820> they<00:01:13.970> had<00:01:14.060> lots<00:01:14.150> of<00:01:14.270> sex<00:01:14.510> in<00:01:14.660> them

terrible they had lots of sex in them

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.750 
terrible they had lots of sex in them
but<00:01:15.350> the<00:01:15.470> acting<00:01:15.920> was<00:01:16.040> terrible<00:01:16.070> and<00:01:16.700> the

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:16.760 
but the acting was terrible and the

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.969 
but the acting was terrible and the
story<00:01:17.060> was<00:01:17.180> terrible<00:01:17.540> and<00:01:17.660> we<00:01:17.780> thought<00:01:18.050> we

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
story was terrible and we thought we

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:20.760 
story was terrible and we thought we
could<00:01:19.190> do<00:01:19.610> a<00:01:19.640> better<00:01:19.790> job<00:01:19.940> of<00:01:20.119> that<00:01:20.240> ourselves

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
could do a better job of that ourselves

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.070 
could do a better job of that ourselves
so<00:01:21.770> we<00:01:21.979> moved<00:01:22.460> to<00:01:22.610> Holland<00:01:22.940> and<00:01:23.180> we<00:01:23.270> try<00:01:24.020> to

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 
so we moved to Holland and we try to

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.930 
so we moved to Holland and we try to
make<00:01:24.260> an<00:01:24.380> erotic<00:01:24.680> movie<00:01:24.710> and<00:01:25.190> we<00:01:25.670> thought<00:01:25.850> it

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:25.940 
make an erotic movie and we thought it

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.609 
make an erotic movie and we thought it
would<00:01:26.000> be<00:01:26.060> the<00:01:26.180> greatest<00:01:26.390> one<00:01:26.720> of<00:01:26.750> all<00:01:26.930> time<00:01:27.200> we

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:27.619 
would be the greatest one of all time we

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:29.620 
would be the greatest one of all time we
were<00:01:27.770> wrong<00:01:28.010> ours<00:01:28.430> is<00:01:28.729> terrible<00:01:29.300> who've<00:01:29.510> been

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
were wrong ours is terrible who've been

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.370 
were wrong ours is terrible who've been
in<00:01:29.720> a<00:01:29.810> different<00:01:29.990> way<00:01:30.320> our<00:01:31.240> film<00:01:32.240> has<00:01:32.479> a<00:01:33.050> great

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
in a different way our film has a great

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.320 
in a different way our film has a great
script<00:01:33.770> great<00:01:34.130> characters<00:01:34.610> great<00:01:34.640> storyline

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:35.330 
script great characters great storyline

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.170 
script great characters great storyline
and<00:01:35.570> almost<00:01:36.440> no<00:01:36.680> sex<00:01:37.009> in<00:01:37.130> it<00:01:37.250> at<00:01:37.340> all<00:01:37.520> because

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
and almost no sex in it at all because

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:39.430 
and almost no sex in it at all because
when<00:01:38.479> it<00:01:38.570> came<00:01:38.690> to<00:01:38.840> actually<00:01:39.080> asking<00:01:39.320> people

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:39.440 
when it came to actually asking people

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.470 
when it came to actually asking people
to<00:01:39.619> do<00:01:39.740> that<00:01:39.890> we<00:01:40.400> were<00:01:40.550> far<00:01:40.759> too<00:01:40.790> embarrassed

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:41.480 
to do that we were far too embarrassed

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.300 
to do that we were far too embarrassed
so<00:01:42.080> the<00:01:42.200> film<00:01:42.380> is<00:01:42.470> terrible<00:01:42.800> but<00:01:42.920> the<00:01:42.980> book<00:01:43.160> is

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
so the film is terrible but the book is

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.220 
so the film is terrible but the book is
good<00:01:43.490> there's<00:01:43.940> a<00:01:44.030> book<00:01:44.240> called<00:01:44.570> once<00:01:44.990> more

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:45.230 
good there's a book called once more

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:46.960 
good there's a book called once more
with<00:01:45.410> feeling<00:01:45.440> and<00:01:45.980> that<00:01:46.190> is<00:01:46.310> about<00:01:46.610> that

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
with feeling and that is about that

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.330 
with feeling and that is about that
experience<00:01:47.600> and<00:01:47.890> hopefully<00:01:48.890> it's<00:01:49.160> quite

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
experience and hopefully it's quite

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.120 
experience and hopefully it's quite
funny<00:01:49.520> and<00:01:50.260> slightly<00:01:51.260> more<00:01:51.500> sexy<00:01:51.890> than<00:01:51.920> the

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
funny and slightly more sexy than the

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.270 
funny and slightly more sexy than the
film<00:01:52.340> because<00:01:52.880> the<00:01:52.970> film<00:01:53.180> is<00:01:53.680> the<00:01:54.680> least<00:01:54.950> sexy

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
film because the film is the least sexy

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.300 
film because the film is the least sexy
thing<00:01:55.520> of<00:01:55.820> all<00:01:55.970> time
