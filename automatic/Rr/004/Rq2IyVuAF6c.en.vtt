00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:08.030
 hello friends we are allot cartridges 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:12.960
 and in this video we will be teaching 

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:15.800
 how to change or how to fit the gear 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:20.810
 of the cartridge and collor 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:20.810
 broder de n 210 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:29.039
 we have here the printer cartridge 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:33.329
 brother 210 this is where it goes 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:36.450
 gears and this side where the 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.219
 cover of the tonia reservoir and 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.390
 also makes it possible for us to 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.629
 site 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:46.829
 the material with good quality 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:48.899
 good come first step before 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.469
 Nothing else I presented if it goes 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:55.260
 gear that gear and 7 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:58.440
 she has these two tabs that will make a 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.840
 movement inside the printer and 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.800
 come on the lever that says the cartridge is 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.379
 full 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.720
 this gear she has a point here 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.750
 without the teeth that we call a 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:13.229
 blind spot because it will rotate within the 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:16.409
 printer and will stop at that point fame 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.630
 so it keeps running and so 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:22.049
 damaging that bank that has only 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:26.729
 a movement together with this gear 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:28.530
 also this morning in this fashion that she is 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.960
 only to put pressure on the 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:35.009
 gear and keep it in a position 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:38.850
 correct and the procedure is 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:42.299
 The first way we go first 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:45.479
 remove that cover this you can do 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:48.210
 after placing the tournament inside the 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:51.450
 cartridge so it is difficult and then 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:59.579
 singing and then you'll do the 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:02:00.210
 gear first after you go 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.409
 die 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.409
 this screw 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:13.950
 you will remove the cover by making a 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:21.810
 move it has fit and you go 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:24.210
 take her in this next fla here good 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:27.510
 we have moving gears 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:31.050
 the internal parts of the cartridge and 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:33.780
 jog the develop roller that is the roller 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:36.470
 which transfers the toner to the 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:40.500
 barn of the woods 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:45.050
 now we get the gear 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:49.709
 In fact, this new depression already 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:54.900
 at this time it will be placed in this 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:58.200
 training and we will draw it for 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:05.459
 where this fashion is going. 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:10.950
 to make a new bench next to fashion goes 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:15.720
 make a lever here and leave ball 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:19.650
 was the master opposition so that you 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.640
 can see with the gear with your 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.880
 part 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:27.480
 where you do not have the 10 and that part 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:31.799
 have the laws you are going to put facing 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:34.799
 the gear lenses that are fixed in the 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:39.600
 place of the other and will put this 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:42.870
 The following way you will feel that she 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:46.890
 will make that move and spring you 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:50.580
 place the ball on this part of the 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:54.049
 gear done that greal is already 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:57.299
 on the spot pressed by the ball 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:04:00.380
 we already have the gear in the position of the 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:00.380
 full cartridge 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:07.790
 position and we are going to put the 

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:07.790
 cover 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:18.060
 in note the pf is up here if it goes 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:21.709
 get that developer share and you 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.709
 will put the lid here over 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:29.750
 put it over you will put a 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.750
 Here the bolt is 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:53.240
 and you will put the other screw 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:56.520
 in that other size that releases and is ready 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:59.940
