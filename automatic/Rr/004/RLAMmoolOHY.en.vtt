 how good is going to allow the brand 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.840
 Jeep enters to compete in a segment of 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.180
 market that is growing strongly 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.339
 several years ago the segment of the 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:54.250
 plunder small crises as well as 

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:57.370
 us for us a product that 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:59.589
 It will radically change the business 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.690
 Latin America in us already in the group 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:05.920
 fiat Chryler been working as 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:08.350
 jointly and for 45 years both the teams of 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:12.040
 fiat engineering as a character 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:15.300
 they are developing products in the 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:17.440
 joint and the example of this alliance 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.000
 we can and what is the renegade is the 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.490
 first product 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.800
 that is being launched in which from the 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:27.880
 engineers participated in the 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:30.100
 two companies in fact rené he occupies 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.410
 a totally new platform in the 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:35.770
 group that is a designed platform 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:37.930
 specifically for 4x4 vehicles is 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:41.140
 a platform that will be shared with 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:43.430
 products of other brands of the group and 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:47.060
 also with other products 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:50.330
 the jeep brand is the perfect 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:53.190
 example of the cooperation of this new 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:56.760
 alliance that is via bring 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:02:00.150
 idea is to share the engineering of 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:02.880
 the two marks for the components that 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:04.500
 they are not visible to the public but that 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.960
 do to efficiency and now 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.550
 performance of the vehicles what 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.649
 it has to do with the design there is 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.590
 fundamental to maintain the independence of 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:16.500
 the two working groups both people 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:19.290
 of US development as the group of 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.940
 Design in Italy or in Brazil in the case 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.620
 the kingdom of no one can doubt that it is a 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.450
 product or a hundred percent design 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.830
 type one you already see it not only the design 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.920
 outside but also inside in 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:31.800
 some particular details that it has 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.810
 this product then there is no 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.360
 problem in which rené coexists with 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.310
 some product of the brand fiat where 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.680
 they can count on a similar platform 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.900
 but the personality of the products is 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.660
 totally different and aims at markets 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:48.360
 and different types of customers so 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:51.060
 for us it is clear that there is no 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.700
 brand mix that can be confused 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.800
 customers the fact that it has 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.740
 invested more than 2 billion of 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.360
 dollars for 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:01.090
 manufacture this product in the region 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:04.360
 shows the group's commitment to 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:07.000
 Latin America particularly to us 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.920
 we care a lot because it is a segment 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.840
 from the esport and small utilities 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.090
 which is growing a lot in the market 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.280
 Argentine for example represents almost the 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.380
 10% of the total market in the rest of 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.300
 Latin America is still not growing 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.100
 It is as important as in Argentina but 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.780
 is growing strongly then 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.300
 for us that in the chrysler group 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.370
 we are used to working in 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:29.620
 Latin America in niche markets that 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.520
 they represent less than 5% of the market 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.530
 total 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.600
 this product totally changes the 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.640
 rules of the game and it's something that we come 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:39.220
 waiting a long time ago 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:42.040
 for us that this is a before and a 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.780
 then we can say in Argentina for 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.550
 one side we have the advantage of the network is a 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.980
 Brazilian product then we have a 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:49.750
 tariff advantage unfortunately in 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.300
 Argentina today we have the tax on 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.740
 vehicles and luxury can say no 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:56.140
 it already affects mid-range vehicles 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:58.510
 that this hurts you at the moment of 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:00.130
 plan the product range us 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.860
 let's try to 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.810
 in such a way that we are not affected 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:08.080
 by the tax at least in the 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:11.110
 input versions but good we 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:12.610
 we must monitor what the 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:14.050
 situation both of the exchange rate in 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:16.480
 Argentina in Brazil or the situation 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:18.400
 tax so that our clients do not 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:21.790
 are affected what we want to avoid 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:23.890
 at all costs is that a customer buys a 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:26.770
 vehicle that pays a tax and the little 

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:28.360
 time see that product is worth a lot 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:31.060
 less because that tax no longer exists 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.590
 then it is something we can say 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:35.470
 week to week we have to go 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:37.900
 controlling the sports version we have 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:39.220
 Available manual gearbox five 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.530
 speeds there is also a version 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:43.480
 automatic six what would be the 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:45.370
 premium versions the length that 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:48.130
 we have also planned for 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:49.660
 agency a future would incorporate something that 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:51.400
 is exclusive in the segment that is the 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:53.800
 nine- speed automatic transmission 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:56.110
 but from what I mentioned before 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:58.750
 we would already be entering the area of 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:00.880
 tax so we'll see then the moment 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:04.450
 to launch the most equipped versions 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:06.630
 good and also to meet the theme 

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:08.910
 of the tax let's say it's not done 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:11.760
 or we should launch versions 4 by 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:14.630
 2 the 4x4 versions are being analyzed 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.630
 for a later stage 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.400
 once 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:27.020
 the problem to plan a 

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:30.350
 launch when there are these 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:33.440
 taxes that are distorting is sometimes 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:35.690
 that one can not know which one is the 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:38.419
 full range that it will offer in the 

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:40.580
 launch but if we know we have 

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:42.650
 a product the day we can offer 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:44.479
 all the versions that will mark a 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:46.190
 difference in the segment the 

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:49.610
 equipment that has in the performance 

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:52.520
 and the design is something we totally believe 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:54.800
 we revolutionary overcome and 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:57.590
 We believe that we have a winning letter 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:59.240
 but good we go adapting in function 

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:02.270
 of the market situation the situation 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:05.770
 tax and we have was that we are going to 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:05.770
 walk very well with the gpm 

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:09.220
 no one 

00:06:16.069 --> 00:06:19.069
 Y
