00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
currently north point one eight

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.110 
currently north point one eight
megabytes<00:01:04.290> so<00:01:04.800> for<00:01:05.129> example<00:01:05.160> a<00:01:05.640> hundred

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:06.120 
megabytes so for example a hundred

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.910 
megabytes so for example a hundred
megabyte<00:01:06.480> video<00:01:06.750> will<00:01:07.290> take<00:01:07.500> about<00:01:07.650> an<00:01:07.890> hour

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
megabyte video will take about an hour

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.680 
megabyte video will take about an hour
and<00:01:08.430> now<00:01:09.330> 40<00:01:09.840> and<00:01:09.960> 50<00:01:10.409> minutes<00:01:10.530> to<00:01:11.040> upload<00:01:11.190> so

and now 40 and 50 minutes to upload so

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.660 
and now 40 and 50 minutes to upload so
that's<00:01:12.690> obviously<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:13.650> big<00:01:13.860> issue<00:01:14.400> which<00:01:14.640> is

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
that's obviously a big issue which is

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.550 
that's obviously a big issue which is
why<00:01:14.909> there's<00:01:15.180> a<00:01:15.240> lot<00:01:15.420> of<00:01:15.450> web<00:01:15.840> app<00:01:15.990> videos<00:01:16.320> if<00:01:16.470> I

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
why there's a lot of web app videos if I

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.950 
why there's a lot of web app videos if I
had<00:01:16.710> a<00:01:16.740> Bay<00:01:16.920> connection<00:01:17.630> you'd<00:01:18.630> be<00:01:18.840> getting

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
had a Bay connection you'd be getting

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.830 
had a Bay connection you'd be getting
more<00:01:19.670> you<00:01:20.670> know<00:01:20.790> high<00:01:21.060> quality<00:01:21.420> video<00:01:21.659> so

more you know high quality video so
hopefully<00:01:22.140> with<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.320> move<00:01:22.500> goes<00:01:22.710> which<00:01:23.220> is

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
hopefully with the move goes which is

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.429
