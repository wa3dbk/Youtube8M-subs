wild flower or a cone flower with the
ball<00:01:19.970> end<00:01:20.300> I<00:01:20.570> like<00:01:21.290> to<00:01:21.410> just<00:01:21.590> use<00:01:21.680> it<00:01:21.830> straight

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250 
ball end I like to just use it straight

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.020 
ball end I like to just use it straight
up<00:01:22.280> and<00:01:22.520> down<00:01:22.640> and<00:01:23.380> create<00:01:24.380> a<00:01:24.410> ball<00:01:24.950> with<00:01:25.280> with

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
up and down and create a ball with with

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.940 
up and down and create a ball with with
a<00:01:26.060> nice<00:01:26.300> divot<00:01:26.870> are<00:01:27.020> a<00:01:27.050> little<00:01:27.230> well<00:01:27.530> in<00:01:27.560> it<00:01:29.950> the

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
a nice divot are a little well in it the

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.300 
a nice divot are a little well in it the
ball<00:01:31.130> end<00:01:31.370> is<00:01:31.550> also<00:01:31.970> useful<00:01:32.420> for<00:01:33.100> rolling<00:01:34.100> in

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
ball end is also useful for rolling in

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.120 
ball end is also useful for rolling in
areas<00:01:35.180> just<00:01:35.840> roll<00:01:36.140> it<00:01:36.290> back<00:01:36.440> and<00:01:36.470> forth<00:01:36.710> over

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
areas just roll it back and forth over

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.240 
areas just roll it back and forth over
the<00:01:37.220> clay<00:01:38.410> and<00:01:39.410> when<00:01:39.590> you're<00:01:39.740> working<00:01:39.890> like

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
the clay and when you're working like

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.270 
the clay and when you're working like
this<00:01:40.430> and<00:01:40.700> adding<00:01:41.030> textures<00:01:41.600> to<00:01:42.080> sort<00:01:43.070> of<00:01:43.160> a

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
this and adding textures to sort of a

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.300 
this and adding textures to sort of a
thick<00:01:43.580> design<00:01:43.970> like<00:01:44.240> this<00:01:44.480> one<00:01:45.040> it<00:01:46.040> works

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
thick design like this one it works

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.610 
thick design like this one it works
really<00:01:46.580> well<00:01:46.760> because<00:01:47.690> when<00:01:48.290> you're<00:01:48.440> adding

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:48.620 
really well because when you're adding

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.490 
really well because when you're adding
the<00:01:48.950> texture<00:01:49.520> you're<00:01:49.760> actually<00:01:50.300> pushing<00:01:51.260> the

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
the texture you're actually pushing the

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.820 
the texture you're actually pushing the
pieces<00:01:52.040> together<00:01:52.280> to<00:01:52.900> make<00:01:53.900> some<00:01:54.170> divots<00:01:54.530> here

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830 
pieces together to make some divots here

00:01:54.830 --> 00:02:01.390 
pieces together to make some divots here
also<00:01:57.970> and<00:01:58.990> I'm<00:01:59.990> back<00:02:00.229> to<00:02:00.409> the<00:02:00.530> blunt<00:02:00.800> point<00:02:01.010> I'm

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:01.400 
also and I'm back to the blunt point I'm

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:02.950 
also and I'm back to the blunt point I'm
going<00:02:01.520> to<00:02:01.610> show<00:02:01.790> you<00:02:01.820> how<00:02:02.090> I<00:02:02.120> like<00:02:02.360> to<00:02:02.630> use<00:02:02.750> it
