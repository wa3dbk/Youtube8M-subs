to<00:00:00.240> see<00:00:00.390> if<00:00:00.539> you<00:00:00.659> have<00:00:00.840> a<00:00:00.870> protein<00:00:01.439> and

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:01.800 
to see if you have a protein and

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.770 
to see if you have a protein and
moisture<00:00:02.100> and<00:00:02.610> balanced<00:00:03.179> by<00:00:03.300> during<00:00:03.629> the

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780 
moisture and balanced by during the

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.579 
moisture and balanced by during the
Webster's<00:00:04.259> mint<00:00:04.589> taste<00:00:04.830> and<00:00:05.450> I<00:00:06.450> feel<00:00:06.779> that<00:00:07.049> the

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
Webster's mint taste and I feel that the

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.520 
Webster's mint taste and I feel that the
web<00:00:07.950> segment<00:00:08.580> is<00:00:08.730> something<00:00:09.240> that<00:00:09.540> if<00:00:10.110> you're

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
web segment is something that if you're

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.110 
web segment is something that if you're
on<00:00:10.650> a<00:00:10.710> hair<00:00:10.889> journey<00:00:11.190> you<00:00:11.490> need<00:00:11.670> to<00:00:11.790> know<00:00:11.910> how

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
on a hair journey you need to know how

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.140 
on a hair journey you need to know how
to<00:00:12.179> do<00:00:12.450> just<00:00:12.480> in<00:00:12.840> case<00:00:12.900> if<00:00:13.290> you<00:00:13.440> run<00:00:13.710> across

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:14.150 
to do just in case if you run across

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:19.400 
to do just in case if you run across
extreme<00:00:15.150> breakage<00:00:15.960> or<00:00:16.289> you<00:00:17.220> find<00:00:17.730> yourself<00:00:18.410> in

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
how I actually do the wet assessment I

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.930 
how I actually do the wet assessment I
just<00:00:49.500> want<00:00:49.680> to<00:00:49.739> clear<00:00:49.950> a<00:00:49.980> couple<00:00:50.100> things<00:00:50.610> up

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
just want to clear a couple things up

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.020 
just want to clear a couple things up
and<00:00:51.149> let<00:00:51.300> you<00:00:51.449> guys<00:00:51.629> know<00:00:51.960> that<00:00:51.989> I<00:00:52.260> do<00:00:52.440> not

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
and let you guys know that I do not

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:58.250 
and let you guys know that I do not
perform<00:00:54.030> a<00:00:54.420> hair<00:00:54.780> strand<00:00:55.110> test<00:00:55.559> on<00:00:56.219> my<00:00:56.850> hair<00:00:57.260> um

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
perform a hair strand test on my hair um

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.279 
perform a hair strand test on my hair um
that's<00:00:59.219> totally<00:00:59.850> optional<00:01:00.030> you<00:01:00.510> can<00:01:00.840> perform

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
that's totally optional you can perform

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.709 
that's totally optional you can perform
the<00:01:01.469> websites<00:01:01.949> mint<00:01:02.190> on<00:01:02.370> a<00:01:02.399> single<00:01:02.969> strand<00:01:03.300> if

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
the websites mint on a single strand if

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.890 
the websites mint on a single strand if
you<00:01:04.470> would<00:01:04.710> like<00:01:04.920> but<00:01:05.850> me<00:01:06.330> personally<00:01:06.600> I

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
you would like but me personally I

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.390 
you would like but me personally I
really<00:01:07.290> don't<00:01:07.619> think<00:01:07.710> that<00:01:08.900> performing<00:01:09.900> the

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 
really don't think that performing the

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.850 
really don't think that performing the
single<00:01:11.400> hair<00:01:11.580> strand<00:01:11.970> test<00:01:12.330> is<00:01:12.540> accurate

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860 
single hair strand test is accurate

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.789 
single hair strand test is accurate
because<00:01:13.860> you<00:01:14.310> can't<00:01:15.080> measure<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.380> level<00:01:16.710> of

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
because you can't measure the level of

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.679 
because you can't measure the level of
stress<00:01:17.040> you<00:01:17.250> apply<00:01:17.549> to<00:01:17.610> your<00:01:17.790> hair<00:01:17.939> as<00:01:18.420> an

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
stress you apply to your hair as an

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.859 
stress you apply to your hair as an
indication<00:01:19.200> as<00:01:19.740> if<00:01:20.400> your<00:01:20.610> hair<00:01:20.880> has<00:01:20.909> a<00:01:21.299> proper

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
indication as if your hair has a proper

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.460 
indication as if your hair has a proper
balance<00:01:22.320> of<00:01:22.970> protein<00:01:23.970> and<00:01:24.119> moisture<00:01:24.330> by<00:01:25.140> that

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
balance of protein and moisture by that

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.300 
balance of protein and moisture by that
I<00:01:25.500> mean<00:01:25.890> um<00:01:27.170> every<00:01:28.170> strand<00:01:28.500> of<00:01:28.619> your<00:01:28.770> hair<00:01:28.829> can

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
I mean um every strand of your hair can

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.399 
I mean um every strand of your hair can
withstand<00:01:29.549> a<00:01:29.970> certain<00:01:30.329> amount<00:01:30.540> of<00:01:30.659> stress<00:01:31.049> and

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
withstand a certain amount of stress and

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.260 
withstand a certain amount of stress and
when<00:01:32.400> that<00:01:32.579> stress<00:01:32.939> level<00:01:33.590> is<00:01:34.590> overcome<00:01:35.400> the

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
when that stress level is overcome the

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.319 
when that stress level is overcome the
strand<00:01:36.689> will<00:01:37.049> break<00:01:37.439> regardless<00:01:38.340> of<00:01:38.610> your

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
strand will break regardless of your

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.990 
strand will break regardless of your
protein<00:01:39.930> and<00:01:40.200> moisture<00:01:40.350> balance<00:01:40.979> so<00:01:41.670> there's

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
protein and moisture balance so there's

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.810 
protein and moisture balance so there's
no<00:01:42.180> particular<00:01:42.360> way<00:01:42.930> of<00:01:43.850> testing<00:01:45.860> how<00:01:46.860> tightly

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
no particular way of testing how tightly

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.230 
no particular way of testing how tightly
or<00:01:48.360> strongly<00:01:49.350> or<00:01:49.979> if<00:01:50.430> you're<00:01:50.610> pulling<00:01:50.909> this

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
or strongly or if you're pulling this

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.560 
or strongly or if you're pulling this
this<00:01:51.600> part<00:01:51.960> of<00:01:52.079> your<00:01:52.290> hair<00:01:52.740> strand<00:01:53.570> tighter

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
this part of your hair strand tighter

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.050 
this part of your hair strand tighter
and<00:01:54.840> then<00:01:54.990> you're<00:01:55.170> pulling<00:01:55.530> this<00:01:55.740> part<00:01:56.060> I

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
and then you're pulling this part I

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.389 
and then you're pulling this part I
really<00:01:58.020> don't<00:01:58.200> think<00:01:58.259> it's<00:01:58.560> an<00:01:58.710> accurate<00:01:58.950> way

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
really don't think it's an accurate way

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.230 
really don't think it's an accurate way
of<00:02:00.469> telling<00:02:01.469> you<00:02:01.590> if<00:02:01.649> you<00:02:01.829> have<00:02:02.280> protein<00:02:03.060> or

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
of telling you if you have protein or

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.330 
of telling you if you have protein or
moisture<00:02:03.659> imbalance<00:02:04.200> or<00:02:04.350> not<00:02:04.530> so<00:02:05.100> that's

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
moisture imbalance or not so that's

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.830 
moisture imbalance or not so that's
that's<00:02:05.640> one<00:02:05.909> of<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.090> reasons<00:02:06.420> why<00:02:06.600> I<00:02:06.630> don't

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
that's one of the reasons why I don't

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.990 
that's one of the reasons why I don't
perform<00:02:07.500> that<00:02:07.649> test<00:02:07.950> and<00:02:08.160> also<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:08.640> second

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
perform that test and also the second

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:09.469 
perform that test and also the second
reason

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
reason

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.350 
reason
because<00:02:09.810> of<00:02:10.739> the<00:02:10.979> stress<00:02:11.280> level<00:02:11.730> of<00:02:11.760> any<00:02:12.030> hair

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
because of the stress level of any hair

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.130 
because of the stress level of any hair
strand<00:02:12.750> and<00:02:12.959> it'll<00:02:13.260> break<00:02:13.500> regardless<00:02:14.690> of<00:02:15.690> a

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
strand and it'll break regardless of a

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.050 
strand and it'll break regardless of a
protein<00:02:16.590> moisture<00:02:17.040> balance<00:02:17.430> if<00:02:17.549> you<00:02:17.700> apply

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
protein moisture balance if you apply

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.800 
protein moisture balance if you apply
too<00:02:18.900> much<00:02:19.140> stress<00:02:19.650> on<00:02:20.040> that<00:02:20.099> hair<00:02:21.030> strand<00:02:21.390> so

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
too much stress on that hair strand so

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.440 
too much stress on that hair strand so
what<00:02:22.709> that<00:02:22.890> man<00:02:23.069> said<00:02:23.099> I'll<00:02:23.580> get<00:02:23.849> into<00:02:24.180> my

what that man said I'll get into my
method<00:02:24.930> of<00:02:25.049> how<00:02:25.290> I<00:02:25.349> do<00:02:25.590> my<00:02:25.920> wedding<00:02:26.129> sessemann

method of how I do my wedding sessemann
okay<00:02:28.410> so<00:02:28.470> how<00:02:28.890> I<00:02:28.920> started<00:02:29.340> off<00:02:29.430> my<00:02:29.459> weapon

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
okay so how I started off my weapon

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.479 
okay so how I started off my weapon
system<00:02:30.569> your<00:02:30.720> tips<00:02:30.959> I<00:02:31.230> start<00:02:31.890> off<00:02:32.010> with<00:02:32.040> KO

watched hair or either I'll take my

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:39.410 
watched hair or either I'll take my
moisturizing<00:02:36.510> mix<00:02:36.989> and<00:02:37.260> I<00:02:37.650> will<00:02:38.269> spritz<00:02:39.269> my

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
moisturizing mix and I will spritz my

moisturizing mix and I will spritz my
hair<00:02:39.599> down<00:02:40.049> and<00:02:40.470> then<00:02:41.250> detangle<00:02:42.799> usually<00:02:43.799> I

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:43.829 
hair down and then detangle usually I

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:46.280 
hair down and then detangle usually I
detangle<00:02:44.310> in<00:02:44.610> four<00:02:44.849> sections<00:02:45.120> as<00:02:45.720> you<00:02:45.870> saw<00:02:46.049> in

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
detangle in four sections as you saw in

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.160 
detangle in four sections as you saw in
my<00:02:46.440> previous<00:02:46.950> video<00:02:47.489> of<00:02:47.849> the<00:02:47.970> Mohawk<00:02:48.359> have<00:02:48.930> one

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
my previous video of the Mohawk have one

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.800 
my previous video of the Mohawk have one
section<00:02:49.440> right<00:02:49.829> here<00:02:49.859> here<00:02:50.760> and<00:02:51.000> two<00:02:51.599> in<00:02:51.720> the

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
section right here here and two in the

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:52.220 
section right here here and two in the
back

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
back

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.770 
back
so<00:02:52.769> either<00:02:53.010> tangled<00:02:53.579> each<00:02:53.760> section<00:02:54.299> one<00:02:54.599> by

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
so either tangled each section one by

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.160 
so either tangled each section one by
one<00:02:55.079> and<00:02:55.940> once<00:02:56.940> I<00:02:57.090> finish<00:02:57.420> detangling<00:02:57.930> my

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
one and once I finish detangling my

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.520 
one and once I finish detangling my
whole<00:02:58.379> head<00:02:58.680> I<00:02:59.010> will<00:02:59.579> look<00:02:59.970> in<00:03:00.180> my<00:03:00.420> comb<00:03:00.750> and

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
whole head I will look in my comb and

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.180 
whole head I will look in my comb and
I'll<00:03:01.799> compare<00:03:02.400> that<00:03:02.609> to<00:03:02.940> how<00:03:03.599> much<00:03:04.440> I<00:03:04.620> usually

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
I'll compare that to how much I usually

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.970 
I'll compare that to how much I usually
get<00:03:05.430> and<00:03:05.670> then<00:03:06.420> I'll<00:03:06.569> go<00:03:07.230> ahead<00:03:07.290> and<00:03:07.620> shake<00:03:07.799> my

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
get and then I'll go ahead and shake my

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.660 
get and then I'll go ahead and shake my
hair

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.490 

when<00:03:13.670> I'm<00:03:13.790> checking<00:03:14.060> my<00:03:14.390> hair<00:03:14.660> I'm<00:03:14.990> checking

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
when I'm checking my hair I'm checking

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:21.220 
when I'm checking my hair I'm checking
to<00:03:15.650> see<00:03:16.070> if<00:03:16.450> it's<00:03:17.450> mushy<00:03:18.320> if<00:03:19.100> it's<00:03:19.700> limp<00:03:20.120> and<00:03:20.420> if

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
to see if it's mushy if it's limp and if

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.680 
to see if it's mushy if it's limp and if
it's<00:03:21.440> mushy<00:03:21.860> or<00:03:21.890> them<00:03:22.400> but<00:03:22.850> just<00:03:23.030> by<00:03:23.240> the<00:03:23.300> touch

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
it's mushy or them but just by the touch

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.460 
it's mushy or them but just by the touch
of<00:03:23.930> it<00:03:24.170> um<00:03:24.350> I<00:03:25.120> need<00:03:26.120> more<00:03:26.600> protein<00:03:26.840> that<00:03:27.290> means

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
of it um I need more protein that means

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.320 
of it um I need more protein that means
I<00:03:27.650> have<00:03:27.830> too<00:03:28.040> much<00:03:28.190> moisture<00:03:28.580> in<00:03:28.910> my<00:03:28.940> hair

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.330 
I have too much moisture in my hair

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:33.130 
I have too much moisture in my hair
that's<00:03:30.140> one<00:03:30.410> thing<00:03:30.680> except<00:03:31.220> that<00:03:31.340> I<00:03:31.430> do<00:03:31.720> is<00:03:32.720> to

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
that's one thing except that I do is to

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.950 
that's one thing except that I do is to
test<00:03:33.380> the<00:03:33.530> elasticity<00:03:34.180> and<00:03:35.180> with<00:03:35.480> this<00:03:35.720> I<00:03:35.930> mean

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:35.960 
test the elasticity and with this I mean

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:40.030 
test the elasticity and with this I mean
once<00:03:36.860> I<00:03:37.040> stretch<00:03:37.520> it<00:03:37.550> and<00:03:38.030> if<00:03:38.630> it<00:03:38.780> stays<00:03:39.140> there

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
once I stretch it and if it stays there

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.660 
once I stretch it and if it stays there
I<00:03:40.630> need<00:03:41.630> more<00:03:41.780> protein<00:03:42.080> that<00:03:42.650> means<00:03:42.890> I<00:03:43.040> have<00:03:43.280> a

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
I need more protein that means I have a

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.800 
I need more protein that means I have a
lot<00:03:44.180> of<00:03:44.210> moisture<00:03:44.540> but<00:03:45.140> it's<00:03:45.290> not<00:03:45.470> as<00:03:45.830> mushy<00:03:46.810> so

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
lot of moisture but it's not as mushy so

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.770 
lot of moisture but it's not as mushy so
I<00:03:47.840> might<00:03:48.170> need<00:03:48.350> a<00:03:48.410> light<00:03:48.770> protein<00:03:49.420> in<00:03:50.420> that

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
I might need a light protein in that

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:55.690 
I might need a light protein in that
case<00:03:51.020> third<00:03:51.800> test<00:03:52.220> that<00:03:52.430> I<00:03:52.550> do<00:03:53.890> is<00:03:54.890> when<00:03:55.310> I<00:03:55.370> be

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700 
case third test that I do is when I be

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.480 
case third test that I do is when I be
in<00:03:55.760> my<00:03:55.910> section<00:03:56.510> and<00:03:56.930> I<00:03:57.380> try<00:03:57.710> to<00:03:57.770> stretch<00:03:58.250> it

00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:58.490 
in my section and I try to stretch it

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:01.690 
in my section and I try to stretch it
and<00:03:58.780> I<00:03:59.780> noticed<00:04:00.470> that<00:04:00.650> my<00:04:00.800> hair<00:04:00.830> isn't<00:04:01.520> really

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
and I noticed that my hair isn't really

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:06.160 
and I noticed that my hair isn't really
stretching<00:04:02.300> and<00:04:02.980> it's<00:04:03.980> rough<00:04:04.510> like<00:04:05.510> a<00:04:05.720> rough

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170 
stretching and it's rough like a rough

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:10.050 
stretching and it's rough like a rough
wet<00:04:06.530> hair<00:04:06.920> and<00:04:07.750> it's<00:04:08.750> not<00:04:08.930> really<00:04:09.230> easy<00:04:09.530> to

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
wet hair and it's not really easy to

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.450 
wet hair and it's not really easy to
detangle<00:04:11.140> then<00:04:12.140> I<00:04:12.170> really<00:04:12.770> know<00:04:12.920> that<00:04:12.950> I<00:04:13.190> need

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:13.460 
detangle then I really know that I need

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:16.240 
detangle then I really know that I need
moisture<00:04:14.150> I<00:04:14.360> need<00:04:14.870> more<00:04:15.050> moisture<00:04:15.290> in<00:04:15.770> if<00:04:16.070> it's

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
moisture I need more moisture in if it's

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.470 
moisture I need more moisture in if it's
not<00:04:16.460> stretching<00:04:17.120> like<00:04:17.330> it<00:04:17.540> usually<00:04:17.750> does<00:04:19.480> and

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:20.480 
not stretching like it usually does and

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:23.860 
not stretching like it usually does and
that's<00:04:21.200> basically<00:04:21.920> all<00:04:22.370> that<00:04:23.210> I<00:04:23.330> use<00:04:23.600> on<00:04:23.840> the

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
that's basically all that I use on the

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:26.410 
that's basically all that I use on the
way<00:04:24.050> to<00:04:24.110> set
