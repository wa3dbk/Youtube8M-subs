00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
you're doing that then the next step is

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:59.499 
you're doing that then the next step is
simply<00:01:53.759> dragging<00:01:54.030> on<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.240> Diablo<00:01:54.540> ah<00:01:58.340> first

simply dragging on the Diablo ah first

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:02.270 
simply dragging on the Diablo ah first
if<00:02:00.509> I'm<00:02:00.720> as<00:02:00.869> best<00:02:01.110> you<00:02:01.229> just<00:02:01.380> lightly<00:02:01.770> cut<00:02:02.130> off

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
if I'm as best you just lightly cut off

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.389 
if I'm as best you just lightly cut off
the<00:02:02.399> corners<00:02:02.640> like<00:02:02.940> that<00:02:03.590> it<00:02:04.590> makes<00:02:04.770> closing

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
the corners like that it makes closing

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.669 
the corners like that it makes closing
the<00:02:05.490> diabolic<00:02:06.000> just<00:02:06.240> slightly<00:02:06.690> easier

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.130 

because<00:02:10.679> the<00:02:11.130> the<00:02:11.820> edges<00:02:12.180> tend<00:02:12.480> to<00:02:12.600> get<00:02:12.750> caught

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
because the the edges tend to get caught

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.420 
because the the edges tend to get caught
in<00:02:13.530> the<00:02:14.130> hinge<00:02:14.519> mechanism<00:02:15.000> there<00:02:16.160> then<00:02:17.160> we<00:02:17.310> got

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
in the hinge mechanism there then we got

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.070 
in the hinge mechanism there then we got
both<00:02:17.640> our<00:02:17.850> piece<00:02:18.030> of<00:02:18.209> bread<00:02:18.420> and<00:02:18.660> the<00:02:18.780> edge<00:02:18.900> is

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
both our piece of bread and the edge is

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.520 
both our piece of bread and the edge is
cut<00:02:19.320> off<00:02:20.420> we<00:02:21.420> put<00:02:21.600> one<00:02:21.810> piece<00:02:21.959> of<00:02:22.140> bread<00:02:22.320> like

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
cut off we put one piece of bread like

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:28.009 
cut off we put one piece of bread like
that<00:02:23.540> push<00:02:24.540> it<00:02:24.660> down<00:02:24.780> a<00:02:24.840> little<00:02:25.140> bit<00:02:25.459> then<00:02:27.019> fill

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019 
that push it down a little bit then fill

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:33.790 
that push it down a little bit then fill
up<00:02:28.170> with<00:02:28.920> as<00:02:29.100> much<00:02:29.370> of<00:02:30.060> this<00:02:31.040> possibly<00:02:32.040> pile<00:02:32.340> on

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
up with as much of this possibly pile on

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.690 
up with as much of this possibly pile on
it's<00:02:34.800> a<00:02:34.920> bit<00:02:35.070> making<00:02:35.340> messy<00:02:37.280> but<00:02:38.280> it's<00:02:38.310> gonna
