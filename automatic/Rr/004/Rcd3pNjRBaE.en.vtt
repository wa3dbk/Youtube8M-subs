00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
point it starts the clock but it also

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:32.199

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
spider lake comes in and you can set

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.910 
spider lake comes in and you can set
your<00:02:44.360> reaction<00:02:44.900> time<00:02:45.110> based<00:02:45.410> on<00:02:45.590> your<00:02:45.739> own

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
experience to what will best give you an

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.340 
experience to what will best give you an
accurate<00:02:49.580> reading<00:02:50.030> let's<00:02:50.690> say<00:02:50.840> we<00:02:50.989> leave<00:02:51.170> that

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
accurate reading let's say we leave that

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.040 
accurate reading let's say we leave that
at<00:02:51.620> the<00:02:51.650> default<00:02:52.030> 15<00:02:53.030> hundredths<00:02:53.450> of<00:02:53.510> a<00:02:53.630> second

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
at the default 15 hundredths of a second

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.610 
at the default 15 hundredths of a second
so<00:02:54.830> once<00:02:55.040> that<00:02:55.130> is<00:02:55.370> on<00:02:55.580> and<00:02:55.790> set<00:02:56.320> when<00:02:57.320> you<00:02:57.440> go

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
so once that is on and set when you go

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.710 
so once that is on and set when you go
back<00:02:57.860> to<00:02:58.070> the<00:02:58.220> running<00:02:58.550> screen<00:02:58.910> you<00:02:59.390> will<00:02:59.510> see

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
back to the running screen you will see

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.370 
back to the running screen you will see
this<00:02:59.870> display<00:03:00.350> which<00:03:00.590> shows<00:03:00.620> you<00:03:01.069> spy<00:03:01.489> and<00:03:02.380> two

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
this display which shows you spy and two

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.580 
this display which shows you spy and two
short<00:03:03.709> lines<00:03:04.010> pressing<00:03:05.000> the<00:03:05.120> start<00:03:05.450> button

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
short lines pressing the start button

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.250 
short lines pressing the start button
then<00:03:06.590> shows<00:03:06.980> you<00:03:07.250> spy<00:03:07.610> on<00:03:07.640> and<00:03:08.360> you<00:03:08.840> then<00:03:09.019> have

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
then shows you spy on and you then have

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.170 
then shows you spy on and you then have
three<00:03:09.470> seconds<00:03:10.010> to<00:03:10.100> put<00:03:10.370> your<00:03:10.580> hand<00:03:10.790> in<00:03:11.030> the

three seconds to put your hand in the

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.300 
three seconds to put your hand in the
start<00:03:11.480> position<00:03:11.660> to<00:03:12.560> assume<00:03:12.920> the<00:03:13.069> start

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
start position to assume the start

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.210 
start position to assume the start
position<00:03:13.900> before<00:03:14.900> the<00:03:15.260> timer<00:03:15.560> is<00:03:15.800> actually

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
position before the timer is actually

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.699 
position before the timer is actually
active<00:03:16.580> and<00:03:16.730> waiting<00:03:17.150> for<00:03:17.390> that<00:03:17.540> motion<00:03:17.870> so<00:03:18.680> I

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
active and waiting for that motion so I

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:21.430 
active and waiting for that motion so I
press<00:03:19.040> the<00:03:19.220> start<00:03:19.549> start<00:03:20.120> on<00:03:20.390> and<00:03:20.660> I<00:03:21.019> place<00:03:21.260> my

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
press the start start on and I place my

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:22.800 
press the start start on and I place my
hand<00:03:21.680> on<00:03:21.799> the<00:03:21.890> table<00:03:22.070> in<00:03:22.370> the<00:03:22.459> start<00:03:22.730> position

hand on the table in the start position

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.180 
hand on the table in the start position
now<00:03:23.810> from<00:03:24.019> this<00:03:24.110> moment<00:03:24.170> on<00:03:24.650> I<00:03:24.680> want<00:03:24.980> to<00:03:25.070> make

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
now from this moment on I want to make

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.039 
now from this moment on I want to make
sure<00:03:25.400> I<00:03:25.430> don't<00:03:25.790> move<00:03:25.970> that<00:03:26.030> timer<00:03:26.510> until<00:03:26.930> I'm

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:27.049 
sure I don't move that timer until I'm

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:29.520 
sure I don't move that timer until I'm
ready<00:03:27.230> to<00:03:27.350> actually<00:03:27.590> draw<00:03:27.950> the<00:03:28.010> gun<00:03:28.280> and<00:03:28.430> shoot

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
ready to actually draw the gun and shoot

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.259 
ready to actually draw the gun and shoot
I'll<00:03:30.530> use<00:03:30.799> the<00:03:31.010> second<00:03:31.430> timer<00:03:31.640> to<00:03:31.940> simulate

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:32.269 
I'll use the second timer to simulate

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:34.479 
I'll use the second timer to simulate
the<00:03:32.959> range<00:03:33.200> officers<00:03:33.680> timer<00:03:33.920> and<00:03:34.160> I've<00:03:34.250> got

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 
the range officers timer and I've got

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:37.390 
the range officers timer and I've got
that<00:03:34.640> set<00:03:34.940> to<00:03:34.970> a<00:03:35.239> fixed<00:03:35.660> time<00:03:36.220> so<00:03:37.220> I'm<00:03:37.280> gonna

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
that set to a fixed time so I'm gonna

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.620 
that set to a fixed time so I'm gonna
place<00:03:37.670> that<00:03:37.700> on<00:03:37.910> the<00:03:38.000> table<00:03:38.450> I'm<00:03:38.510> gonna

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
place that on the table I'm gonna

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:40.660 
place that on the table I'm gonna
pretend<00:03:39.049> that<00:03:39.140> I'm<00:03:39.380> my<00:03:39.590> own<00:03:39.739> range<00:03:39.980> officer<00:03:40.430> so

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
pretend that I'm my own range officer so

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:50.670 
pretend that I'm my own range officer so
ago<00:03:40.850> are<00:03:41.060> you<00:03:41.329> ready<00:03:41.680> stand<00:03:42.680> by

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.520 

okay<00:03:51.680> I<00:03:51.859> can<00:03:52.549> see<00:03:52.730> that<00:03:52.939> my<00:03:53.120> shot<00:03:54.079> max<00:03:54.290> that<00:03:54.439> I'm

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
okay I can see that my shot max that I'm

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.649 
okay I can see that my shot max that I'm
wearing<00:03:54.769> on<00:03:54.980> my<00:03:55.010> arm<00:03:55.340> is<00:03:55.549> showing<00:03:56.269> me<00:03:56.420> an

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:13.459 
of a second between these two

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:15.699 
of a second between these two
measurements<00:04:14.180> it<00:04:14.540> also<00:04:14.689> is<00:04:14.959> showing<00:04:15.290> me<00:04:15.409> four

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:32.900 
that 0.15 for the reaction time was one

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:34.540 
that 0.15 for the reaction time was one
hundredth<00:04:33.440> of<00:04:33.530> a<00:04:33.650> second<00:04:34.039> off

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:34.550 
hundredth of a second off

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:38.080 
hundredth of a second off
