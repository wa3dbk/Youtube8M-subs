00:00:03.939 --> 00:00:08.300

 How are you doing? I hope you are all 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:15.679
 very well we have a new news of 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:18.530
 call of duty black ops' or 22 ops not the 

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:20.690
 Copts because they must weigh the 

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:22.790
 main responsible for the mode 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:25.370
 multiplayer of the call of duty black ops 

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:27.800
 2 has confirmed that it will make 

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:29.510
 advantages of this title if it becomes 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:33.230
 necessary to balance the game 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:37.340
 online has commented that before it was 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:39.200
 necessary that they were coming back it 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.900
 take out the advantages if they were 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.780
 becoming very complex because you had 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:47.270
 advantages advantages but advantages that you 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.610
 influenced nati advantages that influence 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.170
 to your weapon advantages what influence are they going to 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:54.800
 teammates is what 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:57.000
 comment textually then now it 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:00.150
 they have raised simplify 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.100
 in the advantages and will only affect the 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.630
 nothing to infect the weapon in 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.420
 the partners or nothing only to the 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:08.880
 character and the most important thing is that the 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.190
 advantages of black ops 2 will not be 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.229
 essential because in this game 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.540
 our options to balance the 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.510
 game were to remove the advantages or 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.430
 keep them now you can adjust 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.960
 any advantage to improve it or 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.150
 worsen the I believe that they will go by 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.380
 point systems so if now I 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.160
 It is convenient that for example 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:33.630
 prestidigitation have 10 points and for 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:35.940
 example you have fast sleeved have 2 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.860
 points then it's worth but the best in 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:40.789
 next game I want it backwards and 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:44.610
 the best I want to adjust them my way 

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:47.399
 what start of the advantages then 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:51.060
 what I have commented should leave is 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.649
 They can paste the benefits and I will no 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.440
 to remember that you remember your 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:58.020
 words an advantage should never be something 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.360
 necessary to compete your life not 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.090
 the community should depend on them 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:06.600
 helped him understand that 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.789
 and that's why your new system does not 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.890
 has essential advantages and 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:14.550
 They try to make it the call of duty more 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:16.080
 balanced never made comment what 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:19.980
 good that call of duty black ops 2 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:23.489
 will launch on pc xbox 360 and precision 3 and 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:25.830
 wayÃºu and will be set for the people who 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:29.340
 do not know it in the near future where 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:31.170
 the machines are destroying everything for 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:35.459
 that those who do not know the scriptwriter of 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:38.579
 game will be david sghayer one of the 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:40.950
 writers of the dark knight rises and 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:44.329
 Network train will not handle the issue 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:48.209
 main of the game good to tell me that 

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:52.170
 what do you think about this about simplifying 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:54.180
 the advantages in such a way that they do not 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.549
 be essential as up to now 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.599
