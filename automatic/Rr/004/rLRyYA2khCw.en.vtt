00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 
MillerCoors home draft containers to

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.769 
MillerCoors home draft containers to
like<00:00:04.830> the<00:00:04.950> two<00:00:05.130> on<00:00:05.279> the<00:00:05.310> left<00:00:05.430> with<00:00:06.330> the<00:00:06.540> tap<00:00:06.750> a

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
like the two on the left with the tap a

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:08.089 
like the two on the left with the tap a
draft<00:00:07.109> which<00:00:07.290> is<00:00:07.440> the<00:00:07.529> one<00:00:07.620> we're<00:00:07.770> looking<00:00:08.010> at

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
draft which is the one we're looking at

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.150 
draft which is the one we're looking at
now<00:00:08.370> this<00:00:08.970> one<00:00:09.179> has<00:00:09.300> two<00:00:09.660> co2<00:00:10.380> cartridge<00:00:10.950> to

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
now this one has two co2 cartridge to

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.520 
now this one has two co2 cartridge to
smaller<00:00:11.519> co2<00:00:12.150> cartridges<00:00:12.690> and<00:00:13.110> this<00:00:13.259> one<00:00:13.410> has

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
smaller co2 cartridges and this one has

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.939 
smaller co2 cartridges and this one has
one<00:00:13.740> larger<00:00:14.540> co2<00:00:15.540> cartridge<00:00:15.960> basically<00:00:16.770> the

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
one larger co2 cartridge basically the

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.400 
one larger co2 cartridge basically the
these<00:00:17.430> two<00:00:17.730> are<00:00:18.029> two<00:00:18.330> different<00:00:18.630> fears<00:00:18.930> but

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
these two are two different fears but

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.200 
these two are two different fears but
they<00:00:19.680> are<00:00:19.890> manufactured<00:00:20.850> by<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.000> same

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
they are manufactured by the same

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.040 
they are manufactured by the same
company<00:00:21.600> so<00:00:22.260> if<00:00:22.439> you<00:00:22.560> look<00:00:22.800> at<00:00:22.859> the<00:00:23.010> two<00:00:24.050> units

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
company so if you look at the two units

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.750 
company so if you look at the two units
they're<00:00:25.260> very<00:00:25.590> similar<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.220> pickups<00:00:26.580> are

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
they're very similar the pickups are

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.269 
they're very similar the pickups are
identical<00:00:27.470> there's<00:00:28.470> absolutely<00:00:29.130> no

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
identical there's absolutely no

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.440 
identical there's absolutely no
difference<00:00:29.429> there<00:00:31.189> this<00:00:32.189> is<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.910> Miller

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
difference there this is the Miller

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.060 
difference there this is the Miller
quartz<00:00:33.870> one<00:00:34.110> I<00:00:34.140> guess<00:00:34.380> this<00:00:34.530> is<00:00:34.649> Miller<00:00:34.860> one

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
quartz one I guess this is Miller one

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.660 
quartz one I guess this is Miller one
and<00:00:35.840> if<00:00:36.840> you<00:00:37.079> twist<00:00:37.410> hard<00:00:37.800> with<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.100> pliers<00:00:38.340> on

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
and if you twist hard with the pliers on

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.780 
and if you twist hard with the pliers on
this<00:00:38.940> these<00:00:39.660> ratchet<00:00:40.200> things<00:00:40.410> will<00:00:40.739> will<00:00:41.160> will

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
this these ratchet things will will will

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.510 
this these ratchet things will will will
fail<00:00:42.149> and<00:00:42.510> you<00:00:43.020> can<00:00:43.200> actually<00:00:43.379> take<00:00:44.040> it<00:00:44.100> apart

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
fail and you can actually take it apart

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.440 
fail and you can actually take it apart
this<00:00:45.059> one<00:00:45.390> I've<00:00:45.780> taken<00:00:46.170> apart<00:00:46.590> and<00:00:47.520> one<00:00:48.360> of

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
this one I've taken apart and one of

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.299 
this one I've taken apart and one of
these<00:00:48.539> ratchet<00:00:49.050> things<00:00:49.200> is<00:00:49.440> still<00:00:49.680> on<00:00:49.860> here<00:00:50.160> so

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
these ratchet things is still on here so

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.430 
these ratchet things is still on here so
I'm<00:00:50.430> going<00:00:50.520> to<00:00:50.610> remove<00:00:50.879> that<00:00:51.210> just<00:00:51.899> by<00:00:52.079> prying

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
I'm going to remove that just by prying

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.139 
I'm going to remove that just by prying
it<00:00:52.620> off<00:00:52.739> with<00:00:53.010> a<00:00:53.039> screwdriver<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:54.090> then

grabbing with the pliers these these co2
cartridges<00:01:02.550> are<00:01:02.730> 16<00:01:03.239> grams<00:01:03.600> we<00:01:03.960> believe<00:01:04.320> I

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
cartridges are 16 grams we believe I

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.100 
cartridges are 16 grams we believe I
haven't<00:01:05.610> absolutely<00:01:06.270> verified<00:01:06.689> that<00:01:06.840> but<00:01:07.049> I'm

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
haven't absolutely verified that but I'm

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.109 
haven't absolutely verified that but I'm
gonna<00:01:07.260> measure<00:01:07.439> it<00:01:07.560> shortly<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.189> you<00:01:08.250> can<00:01:08.460> you

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
gonna measure it shortly and you can you

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.280 
gonna measure it shortly and you can you
know<00:01:09.150> compare<00:01:09.570> it<00:01:09.630> to<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.840> one<00:01:09.960> that's<00:01:10.140> in

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
know compare it to the one that's in

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.770 
know compare it to the one that's in
your<00:01:10.640> paintball<00:01:11.640> gun<00:01:11.880> or<00:01:12.150> whatever<00:01:12.450> you<00:01:12.600> got

your paintball gun or whatever you got
and<00:01:12.960> see<00:01:13.140> if<00:01:13.229> they<00:01:13.380> fit<00:01:14.150> these<00:01:15.350> co2<00:01:16.350> cartridges

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:17.299 
and see if they fit these co2 cartridges

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:22.700 
and see if they fit these co2 cartridges
in<00:01:18.710> quantities<00:01:19.710> sell<00:01:20.009> for<00:01:20.310> like<00:01:20.490> a<00:01:20.520> buck<00:01:21.710> which

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
in quantities sell for like a buck which

in quantities sell for like a buck which
isn't<00:01:23.070> too<00:01:23.369> bad<00:01:24.320> these<00:01:25.320> large<00:01:25.710> ones<00:01:26.070> a<00:01:27.030> smaller

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
isn't too bad these large ones a smaller

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.319 
isn't too bad these large ones a smaller
ones<00:01:27.780> they<00:01:28.290> sell<00:01:28.530> for<00:01:28.710> you<00:01:29.670> know<00:01:29.790> in<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.060> 50

home<00:01:52.530> draft<00:01:53.570> very<00:01:54.570> similar<00:01:55.079> again<00:01:55.200> to<00:01:55.619> the

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
home draft very similar again to the

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.499 
home draft very similar again to the
tamograph<00:01:56.219> now<00:01:56.820> on<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:56.969> top<00:01:57.149> of<00:01:57.270> that<00:01:57.299> it

tamograph now on the top of that it

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:58.969 
tamograph now on the top of that it
actually<00:01:57.659> says<00:01:58.079> that<00:01:58.110> small<00:01:58.530> print<00:01:58.799> there

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
actually says that small print there

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.340 
actually says that small print there
says<00:01:59.430> you<00:01:59.939> know<00:02:00.030> one-time<00:02:00.509> use<00:02:00.810> or<00:02:01.079> something

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
says you know one-time use or something

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.749 
says you know one-time use or something
like<00:02:01.469> that<00:02:01.740> not<00:02:01.979> supposed<00:02:02.340> to<00:02:02.399> throw<00:02:02.549> it<00:02:02.700> away

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
like that not supposed to throw it away

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.850 
like that not supposed to throw it away
when<00:02:03.030> you're<00:02:03.090> done<00:02:03.240> but<00:02:03.479> you<00:02:04.439> compare<00:02:04.740> it<00:02:04.829> with

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
when you're done but you compare it with

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.709 
when you're done but you compare it with
the<00:02:05.009> tab<00:02:05.219> draft<00:02:05.579> which<00:02:05.790> is<00:02:05.939> a<00:02:05.969> multi-use<00:02:06.450> thing

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
the tab draft which is a multi-use thing

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.309 
the tab draft which is a multi-use thing
it's<00:02:06.960> almost<00:02:07.170> identical<00:02:07.439> so

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:08.319 
it's almost identical so

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:10.109 
it's almost identical so
I<00:02:08.349> think<00:02:09.009> they<00:02:09.129> just<00:02:09.159> didn't<00:02:09.610> want<00:02:09.640> you<00:02:09.969> to

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
I think they just didn't want you to

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.020 
I think they just didn't want you to
have<00:02:10.869> to<00:02:10.989> learn<00:02:11.200> how<00:02:11.260> to<00:02:11.409> clean<00:02:11.650> it<00:02:11.799> out<00:02:12.000> tap<00:02:13.000> a

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
have to learn how to clean it out tap a

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.089 
have to learn how to clean it out tap a
graph<00:02:13.329> basically<00:02:13.840> instructions<00:02:14.680> just<00:02:14.769> say<00:02:15.040> to

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:15.099 
graph basically instructions just say to

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:16.979 
graph basically instructions just say to

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
don't know what that does I haven't

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.869 
don't know what that does I haven't

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:26.520 
taken this thing apart any more than you
are<00:02:21.909> seeing<00:02:22.659> it<00:02:22.840> here<00:02:25.019> since<00:02:26.019> I<00:02:26.140> get<00:02:26.200> another

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
are seeing it here since I get another

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.110 
are seeing it here since I get another
one<00:02:26.620> I'll<00:02:26.859> probably<00:02:27.099> destroyed<00:02:27.640> but<00:02:27.819> I've<00:02:27.939> got

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
one I'll probably destroyed but I've got

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.759 
one I'll probably destroyed but I've got
I've<00:02:28.480> got<00:02:28.540> two<00:02:28.780> of<00:02:28.870> these<00:02:28.989> I'd<00:02:29.230> like<00:02:29.409> to<00:02:29.560> sort

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:29.769 
I've got two of these I'd like to sort

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:32.729 
I've got two of these I'd like to sort
of<00:02:29.799> keep<00:02:30.010> two<00:02:30.310> working<00:02:30.549> ones<00:02:31.170> in<00:02:32.170> case<00:02:32.439> when<00:02:32.709> I

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739 
of keep two working ones in case when I

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:35.039 
of keep two working ones in case when I
take<00:02:33.040> it<00:02:33.129> apart<00:02:33.370> it<00:02:34.060> doesn't<00:02:34.750> go<00:02:34.840> back

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:35.049 
take it apart it doesn't go back

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:37.289 
take it apart it doesn't go back
together<00:02:35.230> so<00:02:35.650> well<00:02:35.920> now<00:02:36.700> this<00:02:36.819> is<00:02:36.879> the<00:02:37.060> tap<00:02:37.269> a

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:37.299 
together so well now this is the tap a

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:40.649 
together so well now this is the tap a
draft<00:02:37.659> again<00:02:38.260> very<00:02:38.769> similar<00:02:39.129> in<00:02:39.790> design<00:02:40.299> a

00:02:40.649 --> 00:02:40.659 
draft again very similar in design a

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:42.030 
draft again very similar in design a
little<00:02:40.810> easier<00:02:41.049> to<00:02:41.139> see<00:02:41.170> cuz<00:02:41.530> of<00:02:41.650> white

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
little easier to see cuz of white

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.300 
little easier to see cuz of white
plastic<00:02:43.319> but<00:02:44.319> you<00:02:44.439> screw<00:02:44.739> in<00:02:44.889> these<00:02:45.099> co2

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
plastic but you screw in these co2

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.119 
plastic but you screw in these co2
cartridges<00:02:45.970> and<00:02:46.180> it<00:02:46.239> punctures<00:02:46.689> and<00:02:46.900> then<00:02:47.680> the

00:02:48.119 --> 00:02:48.129 
cartridges and it punctures and then the

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:52.640 
cartridges and it punctures and then the
co2<00:02:48.370> proceeds<00:02:49.359> to<00:02:49.599> be<00:02:50.459> led<00:02:51.459> into<00:02:51.669> your<00:02:51.909> tear

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
co2 proceeds to be led into your tear

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.129 
co2 proceeds to be led into your tear
your<00:02:53.650> bottle<00:02:54.280> the<00:02:55.269> bottles<00:02:55.629> by<00:02:55.780> the<00:02:55.840> way<00:02:56.019> are

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:56.139 
your bottle the bottles by the way are

00:02:56.139 --> 00:02:57.780 
your bottle the bottles by the way are
identical<00:02:56.709> between<00:02:56.889> the<00:02:57.129> two<00:02:57.250> absolutely

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
identical between the two absolutely

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.789 
identical between the two absolutely
identical<00:02:58.030> there's<00:02:58.569> no<00:02:58.870> different<00:02:59.290> sign<00:02:59.470> I

00:02:59.789 --> 00:02:59.799 
identical there's no different sign I

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:01.409 
identical there's no different sign I
actually<00:03:00.069> have<00:03:00.310> another<00:03:00.489> video<00:03:00.849> actually

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:01.419 
actually have another video actually

00:03:01.419 --> 00:03:02.759 
actually have another video actually
measuring<00:03:01.750> the<00:03:01.840> bottle<00:03:02.200> so<00:03:02.319> you<00:03:02.379> can<00:03:02.439> look<00:03:02.590> for

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:02.769 
measuring the bottle so you can look for

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:06.539 
measuring the bottle so you can look for
that<00:03:02.859> if<00:03:03.010> you<00:03:03.099> look<00:03:05.069> look<00:03:06.069> at<00:03:06.189> this<00:03:06.310> from

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:06.549 
that if you look look at this from

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:12.240 
that if you look look at this from
different<00:03:06.819> angles<00:03:07.629> here<00:03:08.129> the<00:03:10.139> the<00:03:11.139> the<00:03:11.739> tap<00:03:11.980> is

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
different angles here the the the tap is

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.390 
different angles here the the the tap is
controlled<00:03:12.639> by<00:03:12.940> a<00:03:13.060> like<00:03:13.389> a<00:03:13.419> silicone<00:03:14.400> tube

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
controlled by a like a silicone tube

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.710 
controlled by a like a silicone tube
that<00:03:15.729> gets<00:03:15.970> crimped<00:03:16.510> off<00:03:16.659> in<00:03:17.379> both<00:03:17.620> cases

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
that gets crimped off in both cases

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.990 
that gets crimped off in both cases
these<00:03:19.720> are<00:03:20.109> the<00:03:20.260> smaller<00:03:20.590> set<00:03:21.010> of<00:03:21.040> co2

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
these are the smaller set of co2

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.469 
these are the smaller set of co2
cartridges<00:03:22.629> the<00:03:22.780> eight<00:03:22.930> grams<00:03:24.239> this<00:03:25.239> is<00:03:25.299> how

00:03:25.469 --> 00:03:25.479 
cartridges the eight grams this is how

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:27.390 
cartridges the eight grams this is how
they<00:03:25.629> go<00:03:25.780> into<00:03:25.989> the<00:03:26.139> tap<00:03:26.319> a<00:03:26.349> draft<00:03:26.709> you<00:03:27.250> know

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
they go into the tap a draft you know

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.699 
they go into the tap a draft you know
sort<00:03:28.030> of<00:03:28.090> obvious<00:03:28.419> but<00:03:28.659> I've<00:03:29.260> put<00:03:29.379> this<00:03:29.500> in

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
sort of obvious but I've put this in

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:32.640 
sort of obvious but I've put this in
here<00:03:29.919> and<00:03:30.099> before<00:03:31.090> I<00:03:31.120> measured<00:03:31.540> it<00:03:31.629> so<00:03:32.319> this<00:03:32.500> is

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
here and before I measured it so this is

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.830 
here and before I measured it so this is
how<00:03:32.829> close<00:03:33.400> looks<00:03:33.699> like<00:03:33.909> sixty<00:03:34.359> three<00:03:34.569> point

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
how close looks like sixty three point

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.670 
how close looks like sixty three point
seven<00:03:35.139> there<00:03:35.590> and<00:03:37.049> length<00:03:38.049> and<00:03:38.379> then<00:03:38.530> in

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
seven there and length and then in

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.219 
seven there and length and then in
diameter<00:03:39.040> it<00:03:39.250> looks<00:03:39.400> like<00:03:39.579> about<00:03:40.229> eighteen

00:03:41.219 --> 00:03:41.229 
diameter it looks like about eighteen

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:43.649 
diameter it looks like about eighteen
point<00:03:41.530> four<00:03:41.859> or<00:03:42.250> so<00:03:42.519> depending<00:03:43.239> upon<00:03:43.329> how<00:03:43.629> I

00:03:43.649 --> 00:03:43.659 
point four or so depending upon how I

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:47.490 
point four or so depending upon how I
spin<00:03:44.019> it<00:03:44.049> and<00:03:44.879> then<00:03:45.879> I<00:03:46.479> measure<00:03:46.959> the<00:03:47.109> neck<00:03:47.319> and

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
spin it and then I measure the neck and

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.210 
spin it and then I measure the neck and
this<00:03:47.620> one<00:03:47.859> eight<00:03:48.099> point<00:03:48.129> five<00:03:48.609> or<00:03:48.940> so<00:03:49.180> I<00:03:49.209> guess

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
this one eight point five or so I guess

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.830 
this one eight point five or so I guess
you<00:03:51.220> know<00:03:51.340> they<00:03:51.639> probably<00:03:52.180> all<00:03:52.540> pretty

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
you know they probably all pretty

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.039 
you know they probably all pretty
standard<00:03:54.359> and<00:03:55.359> this<00:03:55.540> is<00:03:55.659> one<00:03:55.810> thing<00:03:55.959> I

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:56.049 
standard and this is one thing I

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:58.229 
standard and this is one thing I
discovered<00:03:56.319> by<00:03:56.650> accident<00:03:56.939> pull<00:03:57.939> out<00:03:58.060> this

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 
discovered by accident pull out this

00:03:58.239 --> 00:03:59.909 
discovered by accident pull out this
little<00:03:58.299> thing<00:03:58.750> there's<00:03:58.959> a<00:03:59.049> spring<00:03:59.439> in<00:03:59.650> there

00:03:59.909 --> 00:03:59.919 
little thing there's a spring in there

00:03:59.919 --> 00:04:03.059 
little thing there's a spring in there
and<00:04:00.489> I<00:04:01.000> did<00:04:01.930> it<00:04:02.049> because<00:04:02.290> I<00:04:02.500> thought<00:04:02.650> it<00:04:02.889> was

00:04:03.059 --> 00:04:03.069 
and I did it because I thought it was

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:04.710 
and I did it because I thought it was
leaking<00:04:03.519> and<00:04:03.669> I<00:04:03.729> thought<00:04:03.879> well<00:04:04.120> you<00:04:04.569> know<00:04:04.689> I

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
leaking and I thought well you know I

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.439 
leaking and I thought well you know I
don't<00:04:04.870> want<00:04:04.989> to<00:04:05.019> waste<00:04:05.199> my<00:04:05.379> co2<00:04:05.709> so<00:04:06.040> I<00:04:06.069> I<00:04:06.549> popped

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:07.449 
don't want to waste my co2 so I I popped

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:09.300 
don't want to waste my co2 so I I popped
it<00:04:07.629> off<00:04:07.720> when<00:04:07.989> I<00:04:08.019> first<00:04:08.259> use<00:04:08.530> it<00:04:08.709> when<00:04:08.919> I<00:04:08.949> press

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
it off when I first use it when I press

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.749 
it off when I first use it when I press
this<00:04:09.519> button<00:04:09.819> in<00:04:10.150> their<00:04:11.069> beer<00:04:12.069> bubbled<00:04:12.519> our

00:04:12.749 --> 00:04:12.759 
this button in their beer bubbled our

00:04:12.759 --> 00:04:15.780 
this button in their beer bubbled our
co2<00:04:13.299> bubbled<00:04:13.840> into<00:04:14.259> the<00:04:14.470> to<00:04:14.979> the<00:04:15.099> beer<00:04:15.310> so<00:04:15.639> it's

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
co2 bubbled into the to the beer so it's

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:17.969 
co2 bubbled into the to the beer so it's
a<00:04:15.879> way<00:04:16.000> to<00:04:16.030> sort<00:04:16.269> of<00:04:16.359> force<00:04:16.570> carbonate<00:04:17.079> and<00:04:17.650> I

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:17.979 
a way to sort of force carbonate and I

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:19.270 
a way to sort of force carbonate and I
didn't<00:04:18.219> show<00:04:18.340> you<00:04:18.430> this<00:04:18.549> on<00:04:18.760> the

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
didn't show you this on the

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.940 
didn't show you this on the
I<00:04:19.389> think<00:04:20.389> where<00:04:20.690> this<00:04:21.380> is<00:04:21.500> the<00:04:21.620> design

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:21.950 
I think where this is the design

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:24.100 
I think where this is the design
basically<00:04:22.460> you<00:04:22.940> turn<00:04:23.240> that<00:04:23.450> on<00:04:23.630> and<00:04:23.870> line

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
basically you turn that on and line

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:28.240 
basically you turn that on and line
those<00:04:24.290> two<00:04:24.470> green<00:04:24.680> things<00:04:25.150> and<00:04:26.150> you<00:04:26.360> get<00:04:27.250> you

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250 
those two green things and you get you

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.210 
those two green things and you get you
get<00:04:28.370> the<00:04:28.490> co2<00:04:28.820> to<00:04:28.940> come<00:04:29.120> in<00:04:29.350> these<00:04:30.350> are<00:04:30.590> the<00:04:30.620> the

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
get the co2 to come in these are the the

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.510 
get the co2 to come in these are the the
other<00:04:31.370> this<00:04:31.910> is<00:04:31.970> like<00:04:32.300> the<00:04:33.280> regulator<00:04:34.280> or

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 
other this is like the regulator or

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.070 
other this is like the regulator or
whatever<00:04:34.850> on<00:04:35.060> this<00:04:35.270> unit<00:04:35.660> like<00:04:35.810> I<00:04:35.840> said<00:04:36.050> I

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 
whatever on this unit like I said I

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.490 
whatever on this unit like I said I
hadn't<00:04:36.350> taken<00:04:36.440> apart<00:04:36.860> so<00:04:37.130> that's<00:04:37.850> about<00:04:37.970> it

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
hadn't taken apart so that's about it

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.520 
hadn't taken apart so that's about it
for<00:04:39.500> the<00:04:39.710> comparison
