this<00:01:41.390> is<00:01:41.630> now<00:01:41.900> about<00:01:42.940> hundred<00:01:43.940> inches<00:01:48.010> it's<00:01:49.120> a

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:50.410 
this is now about hundred inches it's a

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:56.650 
this is now about hundred inches it's a
very<00:01:51.410> nice<00:01:51.860> and<00:01:52.340> clear<00:01:52.790> picture<00:01:53.420> you<00:01:54.410> see<00:01:55.660> the

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:56.660 
very nice and clear picture you see the

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.170 
very nice and clear picture you see the
lines<00:01:56.960> on<00:01:57.290> the<00:01:57.470> video<00:01:57.860> are<00:01:58.220> because<00:01:58.760> of<00:01:58.790> the

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
lines on the video are because of the

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:04.270 
lines on the video are because of the
DLP<00:01:59.660> projector<00:02:00.790> because<00:02:01.790> of<00:02:02.240> the<00:02:03.280> technology

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
DLP projector because of the technology

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:12.400 
DLP projector because of the technology
of<00:02:04.420> three<00:02:05.530> kind<00:02:06.530> of<00:02:06.680> LEDs<00:02:08.140> so<00:02:11.170> because<00:02:12.170> of<00:02:12.380> that

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
of three kind of LEDs so because of that

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.640 
of three kind of LEDs so because of that
changing<00:02:13.250> of<00:02:13.490> LEDs<00:02:14.300> and<00:02:14.660> the<00:02:15.430> changing<00:02:16.430> of

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
changing of LEDs and the changing of

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:24.940 
changing of LEDs and the changing of
color<00:02:18.650> of<00:02:18.980> the<00:02:19.940> DLP<00:02:20.720> chip<00:02:20.750> that's<00:02:22.660> its<00:02:23.950> effect

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
color of the DLP chip that's its effect

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:33.130 
color of the DLP chip that's its effect
you<00:02:25.310> only<00:02:25.580> see<00:02:26.060> on<00:02:26.240> the<00:02:26.420> cam<00:02:26.690> it's<00:02:28.540> not<00:02:31.900> to<00:02:32.900> see

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
you only see on the cam it's not to see

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.940 
you only see on the cam it's not to see
with<00:02:33.650> your<00:02:33.800> eyes<00:02:34.810> some<00:02:35.810> people<00:02:36.230> see<00:02:36.500> it<00:02:36.620> but

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
with your eyes some people see it but

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:42.430 
with your eyes some people see it but
it's<00:02:37.730> only<00:02:38.380> left<00:02:39.380> less<00:02:39.920> than<00:02:40.190> 10%<00:02:41.440> from

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
it's only left less than 10% from

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:48.610 
it's only left less than 10% from
people's<00:02:43.600> right<00:02:45.430> you<00:02:46.430> see<00:02:47.209> the<00:02:47.420> projector<00:02:48.050> you

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
people's right you see the projector you

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.870 
people's right you see the projector you
saw<00:02:48.860> the<00:02:48.920> projector<00:02:49.700> and<00:02:49.940> you<00:02:50.840> see<00:02:51.110> the<00:02:51.290> screen

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
saw the projector and you see the screen

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:59.470 
saw the projector and you see the screen
right<00:02:52.880> now<00:02:53.830> I'm<00:02:54.830> showing<00:02:55.220> used<00:02:55.670> as<00:02:56.060> before<00:02:58.480> the

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
right now I'm showing used as before the

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.970 
right now I'm showing used as before the
side<00:02:59.780> of<00:02:59.959> the<00:03:00.170> projector<00:03:00.970> there<00:03:01.970> is<00:03:02.950> you<00:03:03.950> see

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
side of the projector there is you see

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.949 
side of the projector there is you see
some<00:03:04.760> light<00:03:05.060> from<00:03:05.450> the<00:03:05.660> blue<00:03:05.870> LEDs<00:03:07.780> from<00:03:08.780> the

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
some light from the blue LEDs from the

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:11.430 
some light from the blue LEDs from the
projector

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
projector

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.330 
projector
and<00:03:11.530> there<00:03:12.370> you<00:03:12.580> see<00:03:12.610> some<00:03:13.560> red<00:03:14.560> light<00:03:14.860> and

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
and there you see some red light and

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.230 
and there you see some red light and
some<00:03:15.820> green<00:03:16.300> light<00:03:16.570> it's<00:03:17.130> just<00:03:18.130> from<00:03:18.460> the<00:03:18.700> RGB

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:19.240 
some green light it's just from the RGB

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:26.430 
some green light it's just from the RGB
LEDs<00:03:20.020> from<00:03:20.350> the<00:03:20.500> projector<00:03:21.600> right<00:03:22.600> I<00:03:25.440> think

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
LEDs from the projector right I think

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:33.060 
LEDs from the projector right I think
you<00:03:26.950> hear<00:03:27.220> the<00:03:27.490> noise<00:03:27.790> from<00:03:28.260> from<00:03:29.260> it<00:03:29.500> and<00:03:32.070> now

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:33.070 
you hear the noise from from it and now

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:40.950 
you hear the noise from from it and now
I<00:03:33.100> gonna<00:03:33.520> put<00:03:34.000> the<00:03:34.180> lights<00:03:34.420> on<00:03:34.780> for<00:03:39.750> for<00:03:40.750> show

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:40.960 
I gonna put the lights on for for show

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:53.170 
I gonna put the lights on for for show
you<00:03:41.020> how<00:03:41.410> it<00:03:41.620> works<00:03:41.890> with<00:03:42.990> like<00:03:43.990> that<00:03:44.200> room

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:04:01.229 

so<00:03:53.720> as<00:03:53.900> you<00:03:54.140> see<00:03:56.590> it's<00:03:57.590> quite<00:03:58.370> not<00:03:58.870> usable<00:04:00.040> but

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.239 
so as you see it's quite not usable but

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:08.309 
so as you see it's quite not usable but
still<00:04:02.239> okay<00:04:02.750> for<00:04:04.659> 200<00:04:05.659> lumens<00:04:06.579> LED<00:04:07.579> projector

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:08.319 
still okay for 200 lumens LED projector

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:16.599 
still okay for 200 lumens LED projector
and<00:04:11.349> as<00:04:12.349> you<00:04:12.680> see<00:04:13.420> at<00:04:14.420> night<00:04:15.220> makes<00:04:16.220> a<00:04:16.400> nice

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:16.609 
and as you see at night makes a nice

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:22.950 
and as you see at night makes a nice
picture<00:04:17.030> I<00:04:18.639> just<00:04:19.639> showed<00:04:20.090> you<00:04:20.810> you<00:04:20.979> the<00:04:21.979> manual

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
picture I just showed you you the manual

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:32.189 
picture I just showed you you the manual
the<00:04:23.960> menu<00:04:26.410> so<00:04:28.060> as<00:04:29.060> you<00:04:29.360> see<00:04:29.810> here<00:04:30.110> the<00:04:30.410> letters

00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:32.199 
the menu so as you see here the letters

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:41.560 
the menu so as you see here the letters
on<00:04:33.199> the<00:04:33.560> screen<00:04:34.360> are<00:04:35.360> pretty<00:04:35.720> nice<00:04:36.250> and<00:04:40.570> that's

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
on the screen are pretty nice and that's

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:49.080 
on the screen are pretty nice and that's
it<00:04:41.870> I<00:04:42.400> can<00:04:43.400> say<00:04:43.760> today<00:04:46.690> right<00:04:47.690> it's<00:04:48.139> the

compare two TVs what you gonna pay for 2
meter<00:05:46.090> base<00:05:47.090> side<00:05:47.800> TV<00:05:50.169> you<00:05:51.169> have<00:05:51.919> a<00:05:51.949> good<00:05:52.400> price

00:05:52.779 --> 00:05:52.789 
meter base side TV you have a good price

00:05:52.789 --> 00:06:01.110 
meter base side TV you have a good price
with<00:05:54.039> around<00:05:55.449> 400<00:05:56.949> euros<00:05:57.949> for<00:05:59.590> for<00:06:00.590> buying<00:06:00.860> a

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:01.120 
with around 400 euros for for buying a

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.420 
with around 400 euros for for buying a
projector<00:06:02.120> like<00:06:02.300> this<00:06:02.719> with

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:03.430 
projector like this with

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:09.180 
projector like this with
energy<00:06:04.050> so<00:06:05.050> this<00:06:05.980> was<00:06:06.340> the<00:06:06.640> LG<00:06:07.390> HS<00:06:08.230> two<00:06:08.650> hundred

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:09.190 
energy so this was the LG HS two hundred

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:13.920 
energy so this was the LG HS two hundred
or<00:06:09.900> 200<00:06:10.900> G<00:06:11.560> it's<00:06:12.400> the<00:06:12.580> two<00:06:13.000> or<00:06:13.210> one<00:06:13.480> in<00:06:13.780> the
