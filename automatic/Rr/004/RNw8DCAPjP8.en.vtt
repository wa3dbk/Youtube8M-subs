00:00:00.859 --> 00:00:06.930
 hello everyone today i want 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.110
 show and tell us 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:14.179
 next i do in tomatoes 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:17.940
 Well, what charges come naturally 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:21.060
 have our harvest gone we already have 10 brush 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:25.410
 blossom now the problem is such that 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.609
 it's hot and you need to do 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.090
 artificial pollination 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:33.269
 for this, I bought now show 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.460
 drug them a lot there is such envy 

00:00:33.269 --> 00:00:37.620
 there is even and I do not remember even completely 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.569
 how to list them but I'm in that year 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:44.449
 I tried this drug to me 

00:00:39.569 --> 00:00:47.429
 advised guys so i use it 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:50.959
 goes here with a syringe I pour 

00:00:47.429 --> 00:00:53.369
 Now there is a different dosage is from 

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:56.969
 one and a half to two with guilty cubes 

00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:58.889
 I'll pour two dice for that too two 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.659
 dice per liter used such 

00:00:58.889 --> 00:01:03.110
 liter bottle of baikal 

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:06.770
 this tara doesn't matter which one will and 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:14.060
 on top of a spray bottle that's he's so 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:17.520
 works and spray 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:21.530
 brush which bloomed 3 4 col. 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:24.119
 Here it can be seen here and in general to do 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:28.619
 that's enough to happen 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:31.380
 artificial pollination re-pollination 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.329
 by the way is not recommended to do but me 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.460
 it happens easily because now I 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:38.299
 I will pass it though to do a day 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:45.020
 high even a little uncomfortable 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:47.429
 Well, after this will be lowered here 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.950
 our tomato will be lowered 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:52.890
 once again and lower a lot so here 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.259
 below the trellis so he can see what 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.650
 polishing here and when lowered will be so 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:01.080
 below and because of this we 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:03.620
 not to repeat what I have already, or 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:07.320
 said that re-spraying 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:10.920
 leads bursts cracks ugly 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:13.980
 the fetus becomes necessary to do one and lower 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:17.550
 he will leave with us and I only what is higher 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:19.880
 It will be the only next time do 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.440
 pollination is a must do 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:26.370
 because it's temperature outside 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:28.800
 It comes in a 40 degrees face 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:34.890
 becomes sterile even at 30 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:37.410
 degrees and ovaries from above will not be in 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.090
 everything else is waiting of course cooling 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.030
 because it's hot a lot 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.459
 water a lot water a lot too 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.470
 scary can pour make a personal 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:51.020
 soda pop and will crack 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:53.510
 tomato he and in addition also at night with us 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:03:00.360
 were pretty days afternoon 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:03:02.670
 38 39 on a thermometer at night up to 15 13 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:06.600
 degrees is also very bad 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:10.410
 drop for tomato because it will start 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:13.110
 so it is necessary to crack 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:16.590
 sometimes close still still our all 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:19.530
 window flaps to lower the film to overcome the side 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:22.170
 to make a little temperature but 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:26.130
 a little warmer too 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:28.500
 saves from cracking that's all that 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:30.360
 I wanted to tell show about that 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.480
 we are going in our greenhouse where we 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:35.610
 is a grade de barao will continue 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.580
 lower as I said try to do 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:40.040
 so we had 15 brushes 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:42.450
