in that respect it could be seen as
almost<00:00:32.550> a<00:00:32.820> successor<00:00:33.210> to<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.420> a7<00:00:33.960> s<00:00:34.110> and<00:00:34.410> with

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780

some vibration issues Sony's resolved

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.229 
some vibration issues Sony's resolved
that<00:01:02.250> let's<00:01:02.489> have<00:01:02.609> a<00:01:02.640> listen<00:01:02.940> to<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.059> new

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
that let's have a listen to the new

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:10.070 
that let's have a listen to the new
shutter<00:01:03.510> sound<00:01:08.180> that<00:01:09.180> is<00:01:09.299> much<00:01:09.510> quieter<00:01:09.780> than

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
shutter sound that is much quieter than

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.990 
shutter sound that is much quieter than
before<00:01:10.650> it<00:01:10.830> uses<00:01:11.100> an<00:01:11.189> electronic<00:01:11.610> first

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
before it uses an electronic first

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.090 
before it uses an electronic first
person<00:01:12.420> shutter<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:13.080> if<00:01:13.320> I<00:01:13.409> switch<00:01:13.740> it<00:01:13.890> to

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
person shutter and if I switch it to

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:20.149 
person shutter and if I switch it to
continuous<00:01:14.970> shooting<00:01:18.740> this<00:01:19.740> camera<00:01:20.100> is

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
continuous shooting this camera is

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.399 
continuous shooting this camera is
shooting<00:01:20.280> 42<00:01:20.850> megapixel<00:01:21.390> images<00:01:21.630> at<00:01:21.780> 5<00:01:22.020> frames

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
shooting 42 megapixel images at 5 frames

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.469 
shooting 42 megapixel images at 5 frames
per<00:01:22.590> second<00:01:22.950> and<00:01:23.159> that<00:01:23.189> is<00:01:23.580> also<00:01:23.729> supporting

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
per second and that is also supporting

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.179 
per second and that is also supporting
continuous<00:01:24.900> autofocus<00:01:25.200> so<00:01:25.799> that<00:01:25.920> is<00:01:26.040> actually

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
continuous autofocus so that is actually

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.490 
continuous autofocus so that is actually
quite<00:01:26.580> high<00:01:26.850> performance<00:01:27.420> for<00:01:27.990> a<00:01:28.020> camera<00:01:28.320> of

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
quite high performance for a camera of

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.890 
quite high performance for a camera of
this<00:01:28.650> resolution<00:01:29.009> and<00:01:29.700> that<00:01:30.270> neatly<00:01:30.479> takes<00:01:30.780> me

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
this resolution and that neatly takes me

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.749 
this resolution and that neatly takes me
on<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.140> autofocus<00:01:31.650> because<00:01:32.130> this<00:01:32.280> camera<00:01:32.490> also

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
on to autofocus because this camera also

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.179 
on to autofocus because this camera also
has<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.299> highest<00:01:33.600> number<00:01:33.720> of<00:01:33.930> embedded<00:01:34.710> phase

what<00:01:44.610> makes<00:01:44.850> this<00:01:45.030> particularly<00:01:45.540> exciting<00:01:46.079> is

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
what makes this particularly exciting is

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.069 
what makes this particularly exciting is
how<00:01:47.250> well<00:01:47.460> it<00:01:47.490> works<00:01:47.820> with<00:01:48.060> older<00:01:48.450> lenses<00:01:48.630> for

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
how well it works with older lenses for

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.050 
how well it works with older lenses for
me<00:01:49.170> while<00:01:49.320> Sony<00:01:49.560> is<00:01:49.829> increasing<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:50.790> number

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
of native f e mount lenses I was very

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.280 
of native f e mount lenses I was very

it's<00:02:45.360> actually<00:02:45.600> performing<00:02:46.020> better<00:02:46.260> but<00:02:46.590> I

it's actually performing better but I

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.100 
it's actually performing better but I

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
wanted to take it further so I removed

course there are some caveats it won't

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.240 
course there are some caveats it won't
work<00:03:48.630> with<00:03:48.840> all<00:03:48.959> Canon<00:03:49.290> lenses<00:03:49.590> the<00:03:49.860> older

ones may not autofocus at all but it

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:53.930 
ones may not autofocus at all but it
certainly<00:03:52.620> worked<00:03:52.980> with<00:03:53.220> this<00:03:53.370> one<00:03:53.640> and<00:03:53.850> it

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
certainly worked with this one and it

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.910 
certainly worked with this one and it

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
worked very well and I should also add

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.790 
worked very well and I should also add
it<00:03:56.250> worked<00:03:56.610> with<00:03:56.850> continuous<00:03:57.480> autofocus<00:03:57.800> so

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800 
it worked with continuous autofocus so

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.740 
it worked with continuous autofocus so
think<00:03:59.010> about<00:03:59.190> that<00:03:59.400> again<00:03:59.550> fast<00:04:00.510> and

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
think about that again fast and

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.990 
think about that again fast and

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:03.570 
this has one of the largest electronic

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:05.330 
this has one of the largest electronic
viewfinder<00:06:04.050> magnifications<00:06:04.740> around<00:06:05.009> noir

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:05.340 
viewfinder magnifications around noir

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:08.120 
viewfinder magnifications around noir
point<00:06:05.639> 7<00:06:06.060> 8<00:06:06.240> x<00:06:06.659> makes<00:06:07.320> it<00:06:07.500> for<00:06:07.680> actually<00:06:07.770> bigger

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:08.130 
point 7 8 x makes it for actually bigger

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:10.399

than that on the Fujifilm xt one and it
does<00:06:10.590> indeed<00:06:10.740> look<00:06:10.889> fabulous<00:06:11.310> when<00:06:12.090> you're

does indeed look fabulous when you're
composing<00:06:13.050> with<00:06:13.470> the<00:06:13.740> electronic<00:06:14.400> viewfinder

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:14.550 
composing with the electronic viewfinder

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:17.089 
composing with the electronic viewfinder
and<00:06:15.449> once<00:06:15.630> again<00:06:15.720> it<00:06:15.960> does<00:06:16.169> have<00:06:16.199> the<00:06:16.710> built-in

00:06:17.089 --> 00:06:17.099 
and once again it does have the built-in

00:06:17.099 --> 00:06:20.930 
and once again it does have the built-in
5<00:06:17.430> axis<00:06:18.060> stabilization<00:06:18.449> of<00:06:19.259> the<00:06:19.889> a7<00:06:20.490> mark<00:06:20.699> -

Sony's<00:06:37.800> raise<00:06:37.979> the<00:06:38.099> bar<00:06:38.279> from<00:06:38.520> what<00:06:38.639> we<00:06:38.729> can

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:38.880 
Sony's raise the bar from what we can

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:40.879 
Sony's raise the bar from what we can
expect<00:06:39.300> from<00:06:39.900> a<00:06:39.990> mirrorless<00:06:40.320> camera<00:06:40.620> and<00:06:40.710> even

00:06:40.879 --> 00:06:40.889 
expect from a mirrorless camera and even

00:06:40.889 --> 00:06:41.780 
expect from a mirrorless camera and even
though<00:06:40.979> it<00:06:41.099> still<00:06:41.370> doesn't

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:41.790 
though it still doesn't

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:44.210 
though it still doesn't
have<00:06:41.970> a<00:06:42.210> touchscreen<00:06:42.690> it<00:06:43.200> has<00:06:43.740> pretty<00:06:44.070> much

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:44.220
