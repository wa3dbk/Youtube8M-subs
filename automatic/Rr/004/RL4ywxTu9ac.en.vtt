00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 yes in this clip you will learn how 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.620
 you work with the chess databases 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.870
 can 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.210
 In that case , they see that we are here 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.790
 have installed different database 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:16.740
 I'll just go to the mega 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:17.940
 database 2012 double click and then see 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.369
 you can open a new window here 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.859
 a list window and here are the 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.480
 whole games are shown in the 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.480
 mega database can be found 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.580
 you can sort the whole thing here 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.560
 Of course, platinum is broad platinum 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.630
 but if for example 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.120
 looking for games of a special player 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.100
 you want to click on players and already 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.570
 all players are shown in the 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.360
 database are available 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.670
 Now you want to play lots of special ones 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.219
 Players looking for cameras could use the 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.530
 search function you can click in and 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.570
 assume you want the last new 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.530
 platinum or all parts of 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.050
 see carlsen 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.050
 then they give you the word carlsen 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:03.270
 and already a list with all appears 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.830
 karlsons in the database for in there 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.860
 are and here is also the desired 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.200
 person magnus carlsen 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.540
 There is also the possibility of tournaments 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.970
 to search one then clicks on tournaments 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.340
 All tournaments are displayed here as well 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.119
 Here you can use the search function 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.720
 find tournaments 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.830
 I go back to games 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.960
 Of course you can also very special 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.229
 To find games, click above 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.570
 Filter on list and here you have it now 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.670
 all possibilities are special 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.030
 you find the name gives a man 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.549
 can 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.380
 Commentators specify tournaments you can 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.110
 limit the year numbers 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.360
 whether white or black has won so 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.869
 all possibilities are open 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.009
 to find special games 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:48.060
 if i am now for a partie 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.500
 decide 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.159
 I go to the arbitrary in the 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.670
 database called coal times down kickl 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:58.490
 arbitrarily on a lot 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:01.130
 then this is called and also here 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:04.040
 you can get through the game 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:06.799
 scroll or specifically here in the 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:09.830
 if you go straight into it 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:11.360
 It's all about clicking through it 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.840
 simply by going right 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:17.000
 mouse button on the board then clicks 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.010
 opens a context menu below 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.870
 you see brad design on it chambers 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.459
 click 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.470
 and here you have all the possibilities 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:25.280
 Board according to his options 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.349
 shape 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.610
 For example, if I switch now 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:31.480
 wants to have under the board 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:35.030
 I'll click here to take over the whole 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.830
 and then confirm with ok and then has 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.200
 you suddenly follow the below 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.850
 arrows in which you then very comfortable 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.170
 you can look through the game 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:44.900
 can jump to the end 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.489
 You can go back to the beginning and 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.860
 so on and so forth 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:51.650
 this is mainly as so 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:55.430
 using the database and how to 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:57.049
 the work takes care of the games 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.180
 with chessbase he does it right 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:01.220
 and fun if you own databases 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.820
 Created and how it works 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.980
 Now 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:08.239
 on the one hand they have the possibility completely 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:10.760
 Classic over file then go here 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:12.739
 You can then switch to new and animal 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.140
 then click on a new database 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:17.030
 database open but you have too 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.820
 still just the possibility in the upper 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:22.390
 window just click on new and 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:24.769
 then a new database is created 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.329
 down here you can see the name of 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:28.100
 enter database 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:29.900
 and up here you can see the path where 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:32.630
 this database is stored that is in 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.269
 this case in chessbase my work it 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:36.829
 it is recommended to keep this part 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:38.540
 because you're gonna stop everyone in the future 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:39.980
 Databases that one creates here 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.019
 be filed and then again 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.640
 but of course you can find something 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:44.870
 choose his gutduinen and other path 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:47.120
 that is up to everyone 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:49.160
 let's say you want a database 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:52.720
 create with your own games then 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:55.410
 Let's just call this database 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:04:01.660
 own 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:04.120
 kathi click on create new and already 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:06.580
 she appears here in the database window 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.630
 Now you can continue this database 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:09.970
 specify 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:11.980
 To do this, press again with the right one 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:14.080
 mouse button on it it opens again 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.760
 a context menu and therefore the 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.650
 change properties of the database 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.870
 we want to click here 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:22.810
 properties and then you can 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:24.880
 choose how to designate the file 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:27.160
 if you want to be your own platinum, that's good 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:29.680
 possible or if you have a tactic 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.240
 Databases will be on tactics with our 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.070
 let's say we want a fernschach 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.220
 create database with our procured 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:37.930
 games then we click away chess 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:40.540
 confirm that with ok and already has 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:43.510
 Here you can see the icon changed 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:44.800
 at first glance that it provides 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:47.020
 should be part 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.760
 Of course, this database is still there 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:51.490
 empty we have to fill with content 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:54.190
 just to the database 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:55.390
 double click here we see as a list 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:56.290
 windows are of course not yet 

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:59.470
 games in it 

00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:02.500
 and now we want to have our own party 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:04.840
 This is possible via the board window 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:09.120
 click on it and now I give 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:09.120
 For example, a short party 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:24.660
 this is an arbitrary lot and 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:27.300
 how can i do good but out 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:30.400
 For demonstration purposes very well suited 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:31.539
 so that's a short game you 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.650
 could have played 

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:35.080
 and now you have the opportunity 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:36.130
 Of course, this part too 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.180
 save 

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:39.220
 but you can do it before of course 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:42.099
 just as well comment 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:44.410
 there is the possibility again with 

00:05:42.099 --> 00:05:46.530
 the right mouse button such on the 

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:50.139
 to click on G4 

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:50.910
 springer c3 and now the train a6 is on 

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:52.870
 error 

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:54.610
 then you can on the right mouse button 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:55.690
 click this 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:58.090
 and here you can see again 

00:05:55.690 --> 00:06:01.470
 Context menu can be this train for example 

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:04.690
 provided with a question mark 

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:06.610
 after that jumps 5 is a strong pull the 

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:09.370
 you can then use an exclamation mark 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:11.050
 for example, he understand and provided 

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:13.210
 after runner the 1 what he a whole 

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:15.729
 bad move is easy 

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:18.250
 two question marks and can even do that 

00:06:15.729 --> 00:06:19.240
 still with text to comment on so 

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:28.180
 for example, write 

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:30.940
 that's ok 

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:32.169
 the text is in here yes and now 

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:34.060
 Of course we have to do that 

00:06:32.169 --> 00:06:37.419
 also save whole in the database 

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:38.830
 that's easy up here on the 

00:06:37.419 --> 00:06:42.400
 memory button click or again 

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:43.270
 Add classic to file partie 

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:45.789
 to save 

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:47.680
 Here you simply enter the names of the 

00:06:45.789 --> 00:06:48.580
 counterparty and all others 

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:51.719
 information 

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:58.389
 let us assume that a part between 

00:06:51.719 --> 00:07:01.860
 saver and anand which of course a lot 

00:06:58.389 --> 00:07:03.760
 is unlikely and click ok 

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:06.190
 and then 

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:08.200
 if you go out again is the 

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:09.580
 Partie here in the database 

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:11.650
 saved 

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:12.880
 we have the database all 

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:14.740
 common functions they also from 

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:16.210
 recognize windows databases you can 

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:18.310
 delete games you can play games 

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:20.440
 For example, if you copy a 

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:22.660
 partie from the mega database in her 

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:25.690
 you want to copy your own files 

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:27.490
 just look at the mega database next to one 

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:29.050
 desired part for example for yours 

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:32.080
 Coach click again with the left 

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:35.950
 press and hold mouse button 

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:39.580
 then here on space 12 and then in 

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:41.140
 own party let go and you can 

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:43.360
 one copy then you have to hold still 

00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:45.580
 confirm yes the lot was over 

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:45.970
 copied and as you can see it appears 

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:47.620
 here 

00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:51.870
 So that is working with the 

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:51.870
 databases quite simply
