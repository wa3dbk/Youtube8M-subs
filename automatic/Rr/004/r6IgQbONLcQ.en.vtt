 [Music] 

00:00:03.589 --> 00:00:07.950
 hi in this short video i want 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.469
 talk to you about five aspects 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.269
 very important 5 tricks you need 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.730
 always keep in mind when you try to 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.039
 punch the first trick 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.869
 concerns how davis the hand error is 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.420
 very important that the thumb is 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.920
 out of all four fingers you have to 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.900
 tighten on if it remains inside 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.189
 during the impact risks of luxuries e 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.349
 the thumb joint 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.359
 if you find it hard to close it at the beginning 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.800
 completely protrudes a bit of inches 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.090
 help with the other hand 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.399
 until your muscles are gone 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.040
 used to shut down properly without 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.290
 leave no protrusion the second 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.629
 precaution concerns the part of the 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.670
 hand that will physically impact i 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.770
 against the bag and all-round striker 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.750
 opponent in combat the impact 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.190
 must always occur with the first two no 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.960
 that these some are pointing you in 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.760
 this moment then obviously if there 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.370
 soft surface sooner or later will touch 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.620
 also the rest of the hand but yours 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.030
 focus must go on the first two knuckles 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.739
 the third point concerns alignment 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.359
 structural of the wrist 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.250
 actually in these tips that i am 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.380
 giving you I'm teaching you how to arrange the 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.100
 hand in the correct way to avoid 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.260
 to hurt you 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.000
 you have to keep in mind that when you hit 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.710
 something is natural that part 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.869
 energy back then 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.520
 you have to place the body in the manner 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.500
 correct to make the strength go 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.509
 to the opponent and not return to 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.979
 harmful way to you 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.750
 hence the pulse becomes a 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.590
 crucial point when trying to hit 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.390
 with the fist 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.390
 if the wrist is extorted in this sense 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.890
 lateral or in the frontal sense is a 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.990
 disaster because during the phase 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.850
 of the impact you will do badly and pulse 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.860
 you have to visualize as if your bones 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.259
 forearm could continue 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.110
 in the bones of the hand and that's the reason 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.610
 so let's hit with the first two 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.720
 no we don't try to hit for 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.770
 example with all four 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.409
 at the same time 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.090
 if we did this we will go in for 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.829
 compress the wrist at this point 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.540
 instead arranging the hand so that 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.219
 the impact is mainly with the 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.990
 first two no that there will be one 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.729
 natural continuation of the bones of the 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.649
 hand towards the bones of the forearm 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.350
 the same thing would obviously also apply 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:06.689
 in this sense, for which to misuse the 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.239
 wrist in one of two ways clearly 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:11.489
 who will produce damage the fourth point 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.850
 key when you try to hit e 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:14.620
 hope for a punch to lend 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.110
 much attention to your account must not 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.000
 never get on the ride you don't have to 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.740
 never allow forearm arm of 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.870
 get the most out of them 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:25.360
 separation that use the muscle of the 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.220
 biceps to brake the lengthening so 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.200
 from affirmed a few centimeters before 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.030
 this really very important thing 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.910
 otherwise after a few punches I 'd start 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.740
 to feel pain in the elbow 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.870
 the last point I'll talk about today is 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.490
 the shoulder the fifth point this one 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.320
 the speech is a little more complicated here 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:43.960
 will do a little more complex so search 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:46.360
 to follow me well the shoulder changes 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:48.310
 completely the way it comes 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.890
 used according to the art and what you are doing 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.870
 the traditional arts and more common 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.270
 find your fists with your shoulders well 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.610
 rooted and well pressed inside 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:59.440
 articulation in more modern style 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.640
 like for example boxing instead 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.070
 shoulder is left completely 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.390
 free to move 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:07.540
 you can view these two types 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:10.120
 of fist as two different exercises 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.340
 imagine boxing fist like 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.960
 throw a stone throw a ball 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.920
 when I want to launch something 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.110
 far 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.570
 I leave the shoulder free to move for 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:22.090
 exercise more energy 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:23.740
 if I kept my shoulder pressed the shot 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.300
 it would be falocco the object he would have 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:27.520
 very close to me 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:29.380
 if instead I want to push something e 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:31.270
 this is the second type of punch is 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.100
 essential that the shoulder remains well 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:34.990
 rooted so it is normal in a 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:37.450
 traditional that part of the energy 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:39.670
 used to maintain the shoulder 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.680
 set this resembles pushing one 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.270
 car so if I want to push 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.830
 a car to force itself is unbalanced 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:46.720
 behind completely pardon the 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:48.550
 connection with the rest of the body 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.740
 I can't exercise all the strength that 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:52.960
 I would like are two different ways of 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:54.460
 use the body and you have to do a lot 

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.350
 attention based on the style that 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:58.420
 They enjoy to choose correctly 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:00.850
 because if you want to make a fist punch 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.870
 and leave the shoulder embedded the result 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:03.550
 it will be very bad 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.890
 if you're making a traditional punch 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:08.160
 and leave the shoulder free the result of 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:21.089
 new will be bad 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:21.089
