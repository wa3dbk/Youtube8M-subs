thoughts<00:01:54.329> and<00:01:54.509> prayers<00:01:54.570> and<00:01:54.869> couldn't<00:01:55.619> own<00:01:55.680> so

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
thoughts and prayers and couldn't own so

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.999 
thoughts and prayers and couldn't own so
much<00:01:55.979> of<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.189> families<00:01:56.579> that<00:01:56.759> lost<00:01:56.909> people<00:01:57.420> um

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
much of the families that lost people um

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:04.310 
much of the families that lost people um
but<00:01:59.009> I<00:01:59.719> think<00:02:00.979> the<00:02:01.979> concept<00:02:02.250> of<00:02:02.729> of<00:02:03.299> a<00:02:03.869> bomb

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
but I think the concept of of a bomb

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.950 
but I think the concept of of a bomb
going<00:02:04.560> off<00:02:04.770> or<00:02:05.130> terrorism<00:02:06.119> is<00:02:06.540> something
