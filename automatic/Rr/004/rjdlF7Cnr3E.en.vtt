and paddling on opposite sides of the

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:45.569 
and paddling on opposite sides of the
canoe<00:01:28.039> this<00:01:28.940> might<00:01:29.390> require<00:01:29.780> some<00:01:29.840> discussion

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:45.579 

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:47.649 

okay<00:01:46.579> you're<00:01:46.909> gonna<00:01:47.030> want<00:01:47.240> to<00:01:47.329> keep<00:01:47.420> watching

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
okay you're gonna want to keep watching

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:50.099 
okay you're gonna want to keep watching
because<00:01:48.049> we're<00:01:48.409> about<00:01:48.469> to<00:01:48.679> discover<00:01:49.159> how

00:01:50.099 --> 00:01:50.109 
because we're about to discover how

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:52.990 
because we're about to discover how
maneuverable<00:01:51.109> the<00:01:51.710> canoe<00:01:51.920> can<00:01:52.100> be<00:01:52.219> you<00:01:52.880> would

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
maneuverable the canoe can be you would

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.059 
maneuverable the canoe can be you would
think<00:01:53.210> if<00:01:53.750> both<00:01:54.109> people<00:01:54.500> are<00:01:54.619> paddling<00:01:54.920> on

00:01:55.059 --> 00:01:55.069 
think if both people are paddling on

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:56.679 
think if both people are paddling on
opposite<00:01:55.490> sides<00:01:55.700> of<00:01:55.819> the<00:01:55.880> canoe<00:01:56.149> that<00:01:56.479> it

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:56.689 
opposite sides of the canoe that it

00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:59.679 
opposite sides of the canoe that it
should<00:01:56.990> go<00:01:57.289> straight<00:01:57.909> but<00:01:58.909> it<00:01:59.060> always<00:01:59.209> veers

00:01:59.679 --> 00:01:59.689 
should go straight but it always veers

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:10.500 
should go straight but it always veers
away<00:01:59.959> from<00:02:00.200> the<00:02:00.289> stern<00:02:00.500> paddler<00:02:00.920> side

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:10.510 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:12.520 

fortunately<00:02:11.510> because<00:02:11.750> canoes<00:02:12.230> have<00:02:12.380> been

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
fortunately because canoes have been

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.680 
fortunately because canoes have been
around<00:02:12.770> for<00:02:13.010> a<00:02:13.040> while<00:02:13.240> folks<00:02:14.240> have<00:02:14.420> come<00:02:14.540> up

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.140 
it's slow it's really hard to stay in
sync<00:02:49.790> with<00:02:50.030> your<00:02:50.180> partner<00:02:51.670> so<00:02:52.670> you<00:02:52.700> can<00:02:52.910> see<00:02:53.030> it

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
sync with your partner so you can see it

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.030 
sync with your partner so you can see it
with<00:02:53.360> the<00:02:53.480> steering<00:02:53.720> fry<00:02:54.020> you<00:02:54.440> can<00:02:54.470> kind<00:02:54.950> of

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
with the steering fry you can kind of

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.040 
with the steering fry you can kind of
keep<00:02:55.190> your<00:02:55.400> canoe<00:02:55.640> going<00:02:55.820> straight<00:02:56.120> but<00:02:56.840> it's

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
keep your canoe going straight but it's

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:00.150 
keep your canoe going straight but it's
not<00:02:57.170> efficient<00:02:57.760> being<00:02:58.760> efficient<00:02:59.239> is<00:02:59.660> easier

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
not efficient being efficient is easier

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.850 
not efficient being efficient is easier
and<00:03:01.160> easier<00:03:01.489> is<00:03:01.880> worth<00:03:02.150> pursuing<00:03:02.530> to<00:03:03.530> tell<00:03:03.709> if

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
and easier is worth pursuing to tell if

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.729 
and easier is worth pursuing to tell if
you're<00:03:04.010> doing<00:03:04.040> a<00:03:04.370> J<00:03:04.610> stroke<00:03:04.910> your<00:03:05.750> top<00:03:06.050> hand<00:03:06.500> or

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:06.739 
you're doing a J stroke your top hand or

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:09.040 
you're doing a J stroke your top hand or
your<00:03:07.010> grip<00:03:07.459> hand<00:03:07.730> should<00:03:08.239> be<00:03:08.360> rolling<00:03:08.600> over<00:03:08.780> so

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.050 
your grip hand should be rolling over so

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.620 
your grip hand should be rolling over so
that<00:03:09.080> your<00:03:09.290> thumb<00:03:09.350> points<00:03:09.920> down<00:03:10.360> at<00:03:11.360> the<00:03:11.480> end

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
that your thumb points down at the end

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.720 
that your thumb points down at the end
of<00:03:11.750> your<00:03:11.840> J<00:03:12.020> stroke<00:03:12.320> pause<00:03:12.709> and<00:03:13.340> let<00:03:13.459> the<00:03:13.580> water

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
of your J stroke pause and let the water

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:14.949 
of your J stroke pause and let the water
push<00:03:14.150> on<00:03:14.299> the<00:03:14.420> blade

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
push on the blade

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:19.870 
push on the blade
that<00:03:15.260> provides<00:03:15.799> the<00:03:15.920> turning<00:03:16.280> motion<00:03:18.850> yeah<00:03:19.850> I

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
that provides the turning motion yeah I

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.400 
that provides the turning motion yeah I
know<00:03:20.120> you're<00:03:20.600> saying<00:03:20.900> but<00:03:21.170> you're<00:03:21.320> not

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
know you're saying but you're not

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.440 
know you're saying but you're not
pausing<00:03:21.920> at<00:03:22.010> the<00:03:22.130> end<00:03:22.250> of<00:03:22.340> your<00:03:22.430> stroke<00:03:22.700> the<00:03:23.209> J

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
pausing at the end of your stroke the J

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.390 
pausing at the end of your stroke the J
stroke<00:03:23.720> is<00:03:23.900> more<00:03:24.080> efficient<00:03:24.590> so<00:03:25.100> your<00:03:25.220> pause

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
stroke is more efficient so your pause

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.610 
stroke is more efficient so your pause
is<00:03:25.640> a<00:03:25.670> lot<00:03:25.970> shorter<00:03:26.000> if<00:03:26.630> your<00:03:27.049> J<00:03:27.230> stroke<00:03:27.440> is

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
is a lot shorter if your J stroke is

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:28.990 
is a lot shorter if your J stroke is
working<00:03:27.950> too<00:03:28.160> well<00:03:28.190> and<00:03:28.549> you<00:03:28.670> turn<00:03:28.820> towards

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
working too well and you turn towards

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.330 
working too well and you turn towards
your<00:03:29.420> paddling<00:03:29.750> side<00:03:29.989> just<00:03:30.650> reach<00:03:30.860> out<00:03:31.040> and<00:03:31.100> do

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
your paddling side just reach out and do

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:32.920 
your paddling side just reach out and do
a<00:03:31.370> paddle<00:03:31.730> stroke<00:03:31.910> at<00:03:32.180> away<00:03:32.420> from<00:03:32.570> the<00:03:32.660> side<00:03:32.840> of

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
a paddle stroke at away from the side of

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.340 
a paddle stroke at away from the side of
the<00:03:32.989> canoe<00:03:33.230> it's<00:03:33.500> called<00:03:33.739> a<00:03:33.890> sweep<00:03:35.140> your<00:03:36.140> bow

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.350 
the canoe it's called a sweep your bow

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:38.350 
the canoe it's called a sweep your bow
paddler<00:03:36.890> will<00:03:37.070> quickly<00:03:37.370> get<00:03:37.670> frustrated<00:03:38.239> if

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:38.360 
paddler will quickly get frustrated if

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.210 
paddler will quickly get frustrated if
they<00:03:38.540> feel<00:03:38.810> that<00:03:38.959> they're<00:03:39.140> cobbling<00:03:39.530> all<00:03:39.890> over

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
they feel that they're cobbling all over

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.759 
they feel that they're cobbling all over
the<00:03:40.310> lake<00:03:40.510> the<00:03:41.510> trick<00:03:41.750> is<00:03:41.930> to<00:03:42.140> line<00:03:42.410> their<00:03:42.620> head

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:42.769 
the lake the trick is to line their head

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:44.910 
the lake the trick is to line their head
up<00:03:42.890> with<00:03:43.070> a<00:03:43.100> target<00:03:43.670> on<00:03:43.760> the<00:03:43.880> far<00:03:44.090> shore<00:03:44.120> and

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
up with a target on the far shore and

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.199 
up with a target on the far shore and
then<00:03:45.920> try<00:03:46.160> and<00:03:46.280> keep<00:03:46.400> their<00:03:46.580> head<00:03:46.730> in<00:03:46.970> line

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
then try and keep their head in line
