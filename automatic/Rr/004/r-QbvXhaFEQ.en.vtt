probably go everywhere I mean so I'm

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.249 
probably go everywhere I mean so I'm
just<00:01:31.219> gonna<00:01:31.340> pour<00:01:31.700> that<00:01:31.729> right<00:01:32.390> into<00:01:32.689> my<00:01:32.960> bowl

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:33.259 
just gonna pour that right into my bowl

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:37.120 
just gonna pour that right into my bowl
and<00:01:34.750> I<00:01:35.750> did<00:01:35.960> read<00:01:36.229> somewhere<00:01:36.619> that<00:01:36.680> you<00:01:36.829> can

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
and I did read somewhere that you can

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.090 
and I did read somewhere that you can
use<00:01:37.750> baking<00:01:38.750> soda<00:01:38.960> as<00:01:39.289> well<00:01:39.500> so<00:01:39.740> that<00:01:39.920> would

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
use baking soda as well so that would

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.950 
use baking soda as well so that would
make<00:01:40.219> this<00:01:40.430> even<00:01:40.640> more<00:01:40.880> inexpensive<00:01:41.570> if<00:01:41.750> you

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
make this even more inexpensive if you

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.670 
make this even more inexpensive if you
use<00:01:42.170> baking<00:01:42.770> soda<00:01:43.100> but<00:01:43.939> I<00:01:44.299> didn't<00:01:45.229> like<00:01:45.409> the

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
use baking soda but I didn't like the

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.980 
use baking soda but I didn't like the
graininess<00:01:46.280> that<00:01:46.759> the<00:01:46.850> baking<00:01:47.179> soda<00:01:47.359> give<00:01:47.689> so

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
graininess that the baking soda give so

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.310 
graininess that the baking soda give so
I<00:01:48.170> decided<00:01:48.530> to<00:01:48.710> stick<00:01:48.859> with<00:01:48.920> the<00:01:49.039> baby<00:01:49.280> powder

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320 
I decided to stick with the baby powder

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.069 
I decided to stick with the baby powder

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.009 
up is your paint I saw a lot of people
using<00:02:09.950> gesso<00:02:10.490> a<00:02:10.729> lot<00:02:11.150> of<00:02:11.240> people<00:02:11.510> using<00:02:11.720> just

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:12.019 
using gesso a lot of people using just

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:14.770 
using gesso a lot of people using just
regular<00:02:12.080> acrylic<00:02:12.680> paint<00:02:13.269> the<00:02:14.269> cheaper

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
regular acrylic paint the cheaper

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.600 
regular acrylic paint the cheaper
product<00:02:15.260> was<00:02:15.470> just<00:02:15.500> regular<00:02:15.890> acrylic

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
product was just regular acrylic

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.600 
product was just regular acrylic
so<00:02:16.970> we're<00:02:17.660> gonna<00:02:17.780> use<00:02:18.020> that<00:02:18.260> and<00:02:19.160> it<00:02:19.280> is<00:02:19.430> going

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
so we're gonna use that and it is going

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.880 
so we're gonna use that and it is going
to<00:02:19.730> be<00:02:20.170> 1/2<00:02:21.170> a<00:02:21.590> cup<00:02:21.800> of<00:02:21.860> paint<00:02:22.790> I<00:02:23.470> have<00:02:24.470> to<00:02:24.650> just

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
to be 1/2 a cup of paint I have to just

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.510 
to be 1/2 a cup of paint I have to just
take<00:02:25.130> this<00:02:25.340> top<00:02:25.670> off<00:02:25.970> all<00:02:27.100> right<00:02:28.100> so<00:02:28.250> that<00:02:28.400> took

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
take this top off all right so that took

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.160 
take this top off all right so that took
me<00:02:28.700> a<00:02:28.730> lot<00:02:28.850> longer<00:02:28.910> than<00:02:29.300> it<00:02:29.420> should've<00:02:29.780> but

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
me a lot longer than it should've but

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.140 
me a lot longer than it should've but
we're<00:02:30.860> just<00:02:31.040> gonna<00:02:31.160> go<00:02:31.400> ahead<00:02:31.520> and<00:02:31.760> do<00:02:31.850> a<00:02:31.880> half

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
we're just gonna go ahead and do a half

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.010 
we're just gonna go ahead and do a half
a<00:02:32.330> cup<00:02:32.540> of<00:02:32.720> paint<00:02:34.180> all<00:02:35.180> right<00:02:35.480> and<00:02:35.690> now<00:02:35.840> we're

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
a cup of paint all right and now we're

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.400 
a cup of paint all right and now we're
just<00:02:36.140> gonna<00:02:36.320> stir<00:02:36.740> it<00:02:36.890> all<00:02:37.010> together<00:02:37.220> so<00:02:38.410> I'm

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
just gonna stir it all together so I'm

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.110 
just gonna stir it all together so I'm
finding<00:02:39.680> that's<00:02:40.010> just<00:02:40.220> a<00:02:40.310> little<00:02:40.520> bit<00:02:40.730> too

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
finding that's just a little bit too

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.050 
finding that's just a little bit too
gloopy<00:02:41.810> for<00:02:42.380> my<00:02:42.500> taste<00:02:42.890> so<00:02:43.250> I'm<00:02:43.730> just<00:02:43.910> gonna

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
gloopy for my taste so I'm just gonna

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.120 
gloopy for my taste so I'm just gonna
squeeze<00:02:44.480> in<00:02:44.780> a<00:02:45.050> little<00:02:45.500> bit<00:02:45.709> of<00:02:45.800> baby<00:02:45.890> powder

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
squeeze in a little bit of baby powder

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.480 
squeeze in a little bit of baby powder
not<00:02:46.459> a<00:02:46.520> lot<00:02:46.730> and<00:02:47.440> I'll<00:02:48.440> just<00:02:48.680> keep<00:02:48.980> on<00:02:49.160> stirring

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:49.490 
not a lot and I'll just keep on stirring

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:51.520 
not a lot and I'll just keep on stirring
I<00:02:49.850> don't<00:02:50.270> think<00:02:50.450> I<00:02:50.540> got<00:02:50.660> a<00:02:50.720> full<00:02:51.020> cup<00:02:51.230> of<00:02:51.320> baby

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
I don't think I got a full cup of baby

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.470 
I don't think I got a full cup of baby
powder<00:02:51.770> the<00:02:52.010> first<00:02:52.190> time<00:02:52.340> I<00:02:52.370> did<00:02:52.670> it<00:02:52.700> I<00:02:53.030> kind<00:02:53.390> of

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
powder the first time I did it I kind of

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.710 
powder the first time I did it I kind of
filled<00:02:53.840> it<00:02:53.959> up<00:02:54.050> just<00:02:54.890> under<00:02:55.310> the<00:02:55.970> 1<00:02:56.180> cup<00:02:56.480> mark

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
filled it up just under the 1 cup mark

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.240 
filled it up just under the 1 cup mark
and<00:02:56.870> I<00:02:56.930> figured<00:02:57.260> I<00:02:57.560> can<00:02:58.130> always<00:02:58.310> add<00:02:58.700> more<00:03:00.250> okay

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
and I figured I can always add more okay

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.240 
and I figured I can always add more okay
so<00:03:01.280> I<00:03:01.489> think<00:03:01.700> I<00:03:01.760> finally<00:03:02.000> gotten<00:03:02.270> it<00:03:02.450> to<00:03:02.750> the

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
so I think I finally gotten it to the

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.490 
so I think I finally gotten it to the
consistency<00:03:04.250> that<00:03:04.880> I<00:03:05.180> like<00:03:05.630> I<00:03:05.870> did<00:03:06.170> end<00:03:06.410> up

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
consistency that I like I did end up

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.820 
consistency that I like I did end up
adding<00:03:06.770> probably<00:03:07.190> about<00:03:07.430> 5<00:03:08.360> more<00:03:08.810> squeezes<00:03:09.650> of

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
adding probably about 5 more squeezes of

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:12.310 
adding probably about 5 more squeezes of
baby<00:03:10.160> powder<00:03:10.459> and<00:03:10.760> now<00:03:11.390> like<00:03:11.600> you<00:03:11.750> can<00:03:11.959> see

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:12.320 
baby powder and now like you can see

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:13.810 
baby powder and now like you can see
that<00:03:12.590> it<00:03:12.680> has<00:03:12.890> a<00:03:12.920> little<00:03:13.220> bit<00:03:13.340> of<00:03:13.400> texture<00:03:13.700> to

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:13.820 
that it has a little bit of texture to

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.810 
that it has a little bit of texture to
it<00:03:13.970> it<00:03:14.239> does<00:03:14.840> fall<00:03:15.230> off<00:03:15.440> a<00:03:15.470> spoon<00:03:16.130> but<00:03:16.550> it's

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
it it does fall off a spoon but it's

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.510 
it it does fall off a spoon but it's
pretty<00:03:17.209> thick<00:03:17.690> so<00:03:18.440> I<00:03:18.470> just<00:03:18.830> have<00:03:19.010> a<00:03:19.340> regular

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:19.520 
pretty thick so I just have a regular

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:23.110 
pretty thick so I just have a regular
like<00:03:20.390> a<00:03:20.420> jelly<00:03:20.959> jar<00:03:21.290> mason<00:03:21.500> jar<00:03:21.830> and<00:03:22.250> that's

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
like a jelly jar mason jar and that's

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.070 
like a jelly jar mason jar and that's
what<00:03:23.269> I'm<00:03:23.330> gonna<00:03:23.420> sort<00:03:23.690> and<00:03:23.840> you<00:03:23.930> want

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080 
what I'm gonna sort and you want

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.289 
what I'm gonna sort and you want
something<00:03:24.560> that's<00:03:24.769> gonna<00:03:24.920> be<00:03:25.130> airtight<00:03:25.340> so

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:26.299 
something that's gonna be airtight so

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:28.330 
something that's gonna be airtight so
that<00:03:26.510> it<00:03:26.750> doesn't<00:03:27.049> dry<00:03:27.200> up<00:03:27.230> on<00:03:27.560> you<00:03:27.680> I'm<00:03:28.070> just

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
that it doesn't dry up on you I'm just

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.460 
that it doesn't dry up on you I'm just
gonna<00:03:28.459> put<00:03:28.700> it<00:03:28.790> in<00:03:28.850> there<00:03:29.030> and<00:03:29.360> then<00:03:29.540> that's<00:03:30.110> it

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
gonna put it in there and then that's it

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.800 
gonna put it in there and then that's it
for<00:03:30.769> today<00:03:30.950> guys<00:03:31.160> I<00:03:31.519> have<00:03:32.090> enough<00:03:32.360> product

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
for today guys I have enough product

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:34.539 
for today guys I have enough product
leftover<00:03:33.320> that<00:03:33.830> I<00:03:33.860> could<00:03:34.010> easily<00:03:34.250> make

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:34.549 
leftover that I could easily make

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:38.410 
leftover that I could easily make
another<00:03:35.060> batch<00:03:35.390> of<00:03:35.810> this<00:03:36.459> my<00:03:37.459> research<00:03:37.880> said

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
another batch of this my research said

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:43.690 
another batch of this my research said
that<00:03:38.980> this<00:03:39.980> should<00:03:40.040> last<00:03:40.640> about<00:03:41.440> 10<00:03:42.440> months<00:03:42.799> so

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
that this should last about 10 months so

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.280 
that this should last about 10 months so
and<00:03:44.060> then<00:03:44.180> it'll<00:03:44.299> start<00:03:44.570> drying<00:03:44.840> up<00:03:45.080> and

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
and then it'll start drying up and

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.120 
and then it'll start drying up and
whatever<00:03:45.470> but<00:03:46.459> I<00:03:46.700> mean<00:03:46.940> I<00:03:47.269> made<00:03:47.810> this<00:03:48.019> for<00:03:48.620> I

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.130 
whatever but I mean I made this for I

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:50.949 
whatever but I mean I made this for I
mean<00:03:49.880> if<00:03:49.970> I<00:03:50.030> have<00:03:50.180> enough<00:03:50.420> for<00:03:50.570> another<00:03:50.690> batch

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 
mean if I have enough for another batch

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:52.990 
mean if I have enough for another batch
I<00:03:51.140> guess<00:03:51.290> I<00:03:51.410> made<00:03:51.560> this<00:03:51.680> for<00:03:51.890> three<00:03:52.070> dollars<00:03:52.190> so

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
I guess I made this for three dollars so

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.390 
I guess I made this for three dollars so
that's<00:03:53.420> pretty<00:03:53.630> good<00:03:53.810> deal<00:03:53.989> to<00:03:54.170> me<00:03:54.200> um<00:03:54.739> thanks
