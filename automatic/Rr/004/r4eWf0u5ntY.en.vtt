character<00:01:01.530> she<00:01:01.739> is<00:01:01.829> so<00:01:02.070> funny<00:01:02.370> she<00:01:02.460> just<00:01:02.850> made

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
character she is so funny she just made

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.270 
character she is so funny she just made
me<00:01:03.300> laugh<00:01:03.480> yeah<00:01:03.930> so<00:01:04.170> centers<00:01:04.439> a<00:01:04.589> mechanic<00:01:05.129> and

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
me laugh yeah so centers a mechanic and

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.460 
me laugh yeah so centers a mechanic and
she's<00:01:05.820> a<00:01:05.909> little<00:01:06.030> bit<00:01:06.210> of<00:01:06.240> an<00:01:06.479> outcast<00:01:06.930> she

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
she's a little bit of an outcast she

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.440

doesn't<00:01:07.770> really<00:01:07.860> belong<00:01:08.250> and<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:09.150> main

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
doesn't really belong and the main

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.140 
doesn't really belong and the main
reason<00:01:09.479> for<00:01:09.900> that<00:01:10.170> is<00:01:10.500> because<00:01:10.580> she<00:01:11.580> is<00:01:11.820> a

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
reason for that is because she is a

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.560 
reason for that is because she is a
cyborg<00:01:13.080> so<00:01:13.830> she<00:01:13.890> looks<00:01:14.670> like<00:01:14.880> a<00:01:14.909> human<00:01:15.270> girl

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
cyborg so she looks like a human girl

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.499 
cyborg so she looks like a human girl
but<00:01:16.350> underneath<00:01:16.979> one<00:01:17.610> of<00:01:17.640> her<00:01:17.880> gloves<00:01:18.210> for

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
but underneath one of her gloves for

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.749 
but underneath one of her gloves for
example<00:01:18.900> she<00:01:19.110> has<00:01:19.229> a<00:01:19.259> metal<00:01:19.500> hand<00:01:19.890> in<00:01:20.220> her<00:01:20.520> leg

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
example she has a metal hand in her leg

character I think she's kind of
emotional<00:04:45.000> and<00:04:45.120> naive<00:04:45.479> at<00:04:45.690> some<00:04:45.960> times<00:04:46.290> but<00:04:46.650> I

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
emotional and naive at some times but I

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:48.260 
emotional and naive at some times but I

lot of people say that they didn't like
Scarlett<00:05:02.340> as<00:05:02.430> much<00:05:02.639> I<00:05:02.880> don't<00:05:03.180> know<00:05:03.270> why<00:05:03.450> I

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:03.479 
Scarlett as much I don't know why I

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:06.680 
Scarlett as much I don't know why I
really<00:05:04.200> enjoyed<00:05:04.470> Scarlett<00:05:04.979> I<00:05:05.180> both<00:05:06.180> gave<00:05:06.479> them

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:06.690 
really enjoyed Scarlett I both gave them

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:08.540 
really enjoyed Scarlett I both gave them
five<00:05:06.990> out<00:05:07.200> of<00:05:07.229> five<00:05:07.380> stars<00:05:07.440> however<00:05:08.190> I<00:05:08.280> guess

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:08.550 
five out of five stars however I guess

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:10.640 
five out of five stars however I guess
if<00:05:08.700> you<00:05:08.790> compare<00:05:09.210> the<00:05:09.360> two<00:05:09.540> I<00:05:09.750> think<00:05:10.470> I

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:10.650 
if you compare the two I think I

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:13.340 
if you compare the two I think I
might've<00:05:11.010> like<00:05:11.460> cinder<00:05:11.970> a<00:05:12.000> little<00:05:12.780> bit<00:05:12.930> more

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:13.350 
might've like cinder a little bit more

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:16.270 
might've like cinder a little bit more
than<00:05:13.740> Scarlett<00:05:14.370> but<00:05:15.180> just<00:05:15.450> like<00:05:15.600> marginally

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:16.280 
than Scarlett but just like marginally

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.620 
than Scarlett but just like marginally

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:47.160 
couldn't trust him fully but as time

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:48.770 
couldn't trust him fully but as time
went<00:05:47.190> on<00:05:47.400> I<00:05:47.639> started<00:05:47.700> trust<00:05:48.389> him<00:05:48.539> and<00:05:48.720> I

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:48.780 
went on I started trust him and I

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:50.659 
went on I started trust him and I
thought<00:05:49.080> that<00:05:49.320> he<00:05:49.500> was<00:05:49.560> a<00:05:49.650> good<00:05:49.889> guy<00:05:49.919> I<00:05:50.220> really

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:50.669 
thought that he was a good guy I really

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:54.170 
thought that he was a good guy I really
thought<00:05:50.940> he<00:05:51.599> had<00:05:51.840> left<00:05:52.169> the<00:05:52.950> like<00:05:53.220> pack<00:05:53.789> and

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:54.180 
thought he had left the like pack and

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:56.570 
thought he had left the like pack and
that<00:05:54.960> he<00:05:55.260> was<00:05:55.440> really<00:05:55.830> wanting<00:05:56.130> like<00:05:56.250> a<00:05:56.340> fresh

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:56.580 
that he was really wanting like a fresh

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:59.390 
that he was really wanting like a fresh
start<00:05:56.849> I<00:05:57.120> did<00:05:57.570> not<00:05:57.900> see<00:05:58.260> it<00:05:58.349> coming<00:05:58.400> whenever

00:05:59.390 --> 00:05:59.400 
start I did not see it coming whenever

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.460 
start I did not see it coming whenever
it<00:05:59.820> turned<00:06:00.330> out<00:06:00.510> that<00:06:00.570> his<00:06:00.930> quest<00:06:01.260> was

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:01.470 
it turned out that his quest was

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:04.460 
it turned out that his quest was
actually<00:06:01.860> to<00:06:02.010> get<00:06:02.160> Scarlett<00:06:02.729> there<00:06:03.000> um<00:06:03.470> some

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:04.470 
actually to get Scarlett there um some

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:06.350 
actually to get Scarlett there um some
people<00:06:04.770> were<00:06:04.830> saying<00:06:05.070> how<00:06:05.250> she<00:06:05.280> was<00:06:05.580> so<00:06:05.820> naive

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:06.360 
people were saying how she was so naive

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:08.659 
people were saying how she was so naive
and<00:06:06.539> all<00:06:06.630> this<00:06:06.750> stuff<00:06:06.870> but<00:06:07.470> I<00:06:07.710> don't<00:06:08.370> think<00:06:08.490> it

00:06:08.659 --> 00:06:08.669 
and all this stuff but I don't think it

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:10.550 
and all this stuff but I don't think it
would<00:06:08.820> have<00:06:08.880> changed<00:06:08.970> that<00:06:09.510> much<00:06:09.539> if<00:06:10.020> she<00:06:10.320> had

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:10.560 
would have changed that much if she had

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:12.350 
would have changed that much if she had
of<00:06:10.740> known<00:06:10.770> because<00:06:11.160> she<00:06:11.820> was<00:06:12.000> going<00:06:12.330> to

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:12.360 
of known because she was going to

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.450 
of known because she was going to
basically<00:06:12.840> turn<00:06:13.200> herself<00:06:13.470> in<00:06:13.830> for<00:06:14.250> her

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:14.460 
basically turn herself in for her

00:06:32.669 --> 00:06:34.250 
action if that makes sense I feel like
she<00:06:32.880> still<00:06:33.090> would<00:06:33.270> have<00:06:33.300> gone<00:06:33.539> because<00:06:34.020> she

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:34.260

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:35.780 
she still would have gone because she
wanted<00:06:34.560> to<00:06:34.680> find<00:06:35.070> her<00:06:35.219> grandma

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:40.640 
and now it would have changed some
things<00:06:38.370> with<00:06:39.360> their<00:06:39.660> relationship<00:06:40.380> obviously

on how the alphas like protect their
mates<00:07:26.550> and<00:07:26.820> stuff<00:07:27.120> and<00:07:27.390> I<00:07:28.170> don't<00:07:28.350> think<00:07:28.530> he
