 all warranty in one 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.569
 face after well drilled 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:32.880
 the question arises as well as to equip 

00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:35.969
 warm and bring water to the house 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.539
 the best solution is to contact 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.219
 for help to our specialists 

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:43.320
 engineer ural drill system correctly by 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.090
 takes the whole set of equipment 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.570
 considering well parameters 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.890
 individual wishes of the customer 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:53.370
 There are various options for insulation 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.920
 wellheads such as well from 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.199
 concrete rings plastic caissons 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.859
 various metal modifications 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.719
 caissons 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.809
 insulation by building various 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:06.300
 structures over the wellhead we 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.600
 install all existing types 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.870
 but we recommend our customers to install 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:14.490
 metal caisson 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:16.320
 caisson is hermetically welded 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.120
 underground well of sheet steel 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.730
 4 millimeters thick 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:23.400
 dimensions in terms of one by one meter and 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:25.350
 2 meters high mounted on 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.450
 freezing depth and allowing 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.150
 laying pipelines below the depth 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.980
 freezing a big plus installation 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.990
 metal caisson compared to 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:36.180
 concrete rings is it 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.520
 tightness and lack of need 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.710
 working on waterproofing rings 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.640
 which is quite expensive and 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:47.070
 time consuming strapping process 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.900
 works as follows water pump and 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.850
 located in the well supplied to 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:54.600
 the surface passes through the underground 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:57.030
 section of the pipeline and comes into the house on 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.550
 pressure pipe section either in the house or 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.370
 in the caisson is installed 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.380
 accumulator servant for 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:05.560
 solution water hammer when turned on and 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.800
 off the pump as well as for a small 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.390
 water reserve and the larger the capacity 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:13.450
 hydroaccumulator so rarely turn on 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.370
 pump and the more water supply also on 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.620
 pressure area is installed 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.290
 automatic or with pressure control 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.480
 in the system upper or lower limit 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:25.120
 turning the pump on or off 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.790
 either a permanent maintenance system 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.710
 pressure on the input to the house is set 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.530
 main filter replaceable 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:33.630
 cartridges to remove from water 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.920
 mechanical impurities 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.900
 the caisson is made on our 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.650
 production base for individual 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.020
 development 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:43.360
 its design has proven itself as 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:45.820
 the best option for well completion 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.760
 over the years after assembly 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:49.900
 caisson it is processed 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:53.970
 anti-corrosion compounds that 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.970
 significantly increases its service life 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:00.010
 caisson loaded into the crane board and 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:02.020
 delivered to the place of installation on site 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.240
 assembly around casing 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.970
 excavations and trenches for 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:09.270
 holding the pipe into the house excavator or 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.270
 manually 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:21.040
 then together entering the pipe into the caisson boil 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:23.020
 It is driven through the wall of the caisson for 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.239
 water tight holding 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:28.480
 the bottom of the pit is flattened and 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:30.970
 sand casing pad is arranged 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:34.330
 the pipe is cut above the bottom of the caisson 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:36.940
 about 15-20 centimeters then 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.709
 caisson stops in the pit above 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:42.610
 on the pipe passing through in advance 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:44.800
 carved holes in the days of the caisson 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:46.620
 pass the pipe through the bottom carefully 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:49.480
 scald 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:52.290
 roll out the tube measuring the desired length 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:55.000
 for proper installation of the pump 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:57.790
 we connect the pump check valve 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.230
 stretch and connect the cable and cable 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.510
 we dress head 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:03.790
 wellhead is designed to 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:06.040
 wellhead sealing 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.930
 after the pipe and pump are ready 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.609
 the pump is lowered into the well 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.829
 the cap is worn on the tube and 

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:13.569
 fixed on it after that 

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:14.200
 mounted internal wiring in 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:16.419
 caissone 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:19.060
 with the installation of valves and 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:21.539
 the drain valve is then mounted 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:24.789
 pipeline in trench all pipe 

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:26.949
 fit insulation and inside the house on 

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:30.360
 water is set trunk 

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:30.360
 transparent flask filters 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:37.590
 installed automation and 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:40.210
 it is connected by the hydroaccumulator 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:42.039
 put ball valve which 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:45.310
 will later be connected 

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:47.340
 internal plumbing of the house is 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:50.009
 is the final stage 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:52.090
 well construction 

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:54.449
 the next question that appears 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:57.430
 after conducting a water supply to the house it 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:59.949
 waste disposal best solution 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:02.979
 This issue is set by 

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:05.320
 wastewater treatment our ours 

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:07.690
 managers will gladly help you with 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:10.949
 choosing a suitable model standalone
