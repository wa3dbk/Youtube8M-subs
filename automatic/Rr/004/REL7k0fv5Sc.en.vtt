anyway<00:00:42.360> I<00:00:43.310> think<00:00:44.310> it's<00:00:44.520> in<00:00:44.640> this<00:00:44.760> tuning<00:00:45.120> and

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500 
anyway I think it's in this tuning and

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.990 
anyway I think it's in this tuning and
the<00:00:46.500> first<00:00:46.739> figure<00:00:46.980> starts<00:00:47.489> out<00:00:47.640> with<00:00:47.730> just<00:00:47.790> an

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
the first figure starts out with just an

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.670 
the first figure starts out with just an
E<00:00:48.090> major<00:00:48.300> chord<00:00:48.510> oh<00:00:48.960> by<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.230> way<00:00:49.379> I'm<00:00:49.500> going<00:00:49.620> to

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
E major chord oh by the way I'm going to

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.190 
E major chord oh by the way I'm going to
refer<00:00:49.950> to<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.430> strings<00:00:50.790> as<00:00:51.059> their<00:00:51.930> standard

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
brain explodes and that wouldn't be much

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.350 
brain explodes and that wouldn't be much
of<00:00:57.690> a<00:00:57.900> video<00:00:58.370> so<00:00:59.370> he<00:00:59.489> starts<00:00:59.790> out<00:00:59.910> with<00:01:00.030> just<00:01:00.090> an

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:00.360

00:01:12.499 --> 00:01:12.509 
the open B a lot but I'm going to leave

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:14.330 
the open B a lot but I'm going to leave
that<00:01:12.690> out<00:01:12.750> for<00:01:13.410> the<00:01:13.530> purposes<00:01:14.039> of<00:01:14.100> this

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
that out for the purposes of this

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.749 
that out for the purposes of this
because<00:01:15.050> it's<00:01:16.050> just<00:01:16.140> too<00:01:16.530> complicated<00:01:16.860> to<00:01:17.310> try

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
because it's just too complicated to try

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.850 
because it's just too complicated to try
to<00:01:17.820> illustrate<00:01:17.970> it<00:01:18.360> so<00:01:19.259> he<00:01:19.470> rolls<00:01:19.710> through

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
to illustrate it so he rolls through

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.960 
to illustrate it so he rolls through
this<00:01:19.979> little<00:01:20.190> figure<00:01:21.110> like<00:01:22.110> that<00:01:22.140> just

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:22.970 
this little figure like that just

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.510 
this little figure like that just
arpeggiating<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.060> E<00:01:24.619> and<00:01:25.619> then<00:01:25.770> he<00:01:25.830> suspends

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
arpeggiating the E and then he suspends

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.820 
arpeggiating the E and then he suspends
he<00:01:27.180> brings<00:01:27.420> everything<00:01:27.750> up<00:01:27.990> a<00:01:28.170> whole<00:01:28.500> step

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:28.830 
he brings everything up a whole step

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:30.499 
he brings everything up a whole step
except<00:01:29.280> for<00:01:29.399> the<00:01:29.460> low<00:01:29.610> E<00:01:29.640> drum<00:01:30.090> and<00:01:30.270> it<00:01:30.330> stays

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
except for the low E drum and it stays

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.749 
except for the low E drum and it stays
the<00:01:30.690> same<00:01:30.720> so<00:01:31.710> he's<00:01:31.860> spreading<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.310> second

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
the same so he's spreading the second

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.570 
the same so he's spreading the second
fret<00:01:33.030> of<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.500> D<00:01:34.500> string<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.130> fifth<00:01:35.369> fret

of<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.789> g<00:01:36.030> string<00:01:37.009> he<00:01:38.009> brings<00:01:38.280> it<00:01:38.369> up<00:01:38.430> whole

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
of the g string he brings it up whole

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.419 
of the g string he brings it up whole
step<00:01:38.880> again<00:01:39.770> he<00:01:40.770> just<00:01:40.860> walks<00:01:41.220> down

00:01:41.419 --> 00:01:41.429

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
why I feel so strongly about what tuning

why I feel so strongly about what tuning
is<00:02:07.659> in<00:02:08.489> he<00:02:09.489> plays<00:02:10.239> the<00:02:10.539> fifth<00:02:11.110> fret<00:02:11.440> of<00:02:11.769> the<00:02:11.830> a

and with that sound very similar there's
a<00:05:34.940> little<00:05:35.180> musical<00:05:35.540> interlude<00:05:35.660> in<00:05:36.110> that<00:05:36.230> song

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:36.470 
a little musical interlude in that song

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:40.060 
a little musical interlude in that song
he<00:05:36.740> just<00:05:36.980> starts<00:05:37.910> on<00:05:38.090> the<00:05:38.710> walking<00:05:39.710> down<00:05:39.860> from

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:40.070 
he just starts on the walking down from

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:43.090 
he just starts on the walking down from
G<00:05:40.280> to<00:05:40.400> F<00:05:40.490> sharp<00:05:40.580> it's<00:05:41.240> the<00:05:41.360> same<00:05:41.570> chords<00:05:42.100> then

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:43.100 
G to F sharp it's the same chords then

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:48.570 
G to F sharp it's the same chords then
it<00:05:43.220> goes<00:05:43.430> T<00:05:44.140> and<00:05:45.580> G<00:05:46.580> F<00:05:46.730> sharp<00:05:46.760> Betty<00:05:47.690> and<00:05:48.230> then

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:48.580 
it goes T and G F sharp Betty and then

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:52.919 
it goes T and G F sharp Betty and then
up<00:05:49.580> to<00:05:49.640> a

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:52.929 

00:05:52.929 --> 00:05:55.329 

like<00:05:53.929> that<00:05:54.199> it's<00:05:54.499> the<00:05:54.589> same<00:05:54.679> it's<00:05:54.979> just<00:05:55.219> the

00:05:55.329 --> 00:05:55.339 
like that it's the same it's just the

00:05:55.339 --> 00:05:59.260 
like that it's the same it's just the
end<00:05:55.489> of<00:05:55.610> the<00:05:55.699> chorus<00:05:56.080> I<00:05:57.249> think<00:05:58.249> that's<00:05:58.429> it

00:05:59.260 --> 00:05:59.270 
end of the chorus I think that's it

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:00.969 
end of the chorus I think that's it
