ginormous<00:02:22.220> power<00:02:23.000> brick<00:02:23.560> bad<00:02:24.560> thing<00:02:24.800> about

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
ginormous power brick bad thing about

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.040 
ginormous power brick bad thing about
the<00:02:25.130> Xbox<00:02:25.550> it's<00:02:25.790> got<00:02:26.000> a<00:02:26.030> huge<00:02:26.300> power<00:02:26.780> brick

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
the Xbox it's got a huge power brick

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:31.750 
the Xbox it's got a huge power brick
it's<00:02:27.830> literally<00:02:28.519> a<00:02:28.810> brick<00:02:30.340> then<00:02:31.340> here's<00:02:31.640> your

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
it's literally a brick then here's your

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.990 
it's literally a brick then here's your
status<00:02:32.150> light<00:02:32.360> on<00:02:32.630> the<00:02:32.750> side<00:02:32.959> I<00:02:32.989> believe<00:02:34.000> it's

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
status light on the side I believe it's

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.410 
status light on the side I believe it's
orange<00:02:35.540> I<00:02:35.930> think<00:02:36.170> if<00:02:36.769> it's<00:02:37.010> if<00:02:37.760> the<00:02:37.940> consoles

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
orange I think if it's if the consoles

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.900 
orange I think if it's if the consoles
not<00:02:38.630> on<00:02:38.750> and<00:02:39.110> it's<00:02:39.290> green<00:02:39.590> if<00:02:40.280> the<00:02:40.489> console<00:02:40.850> is

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
not on and it's green if the console is

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.539 
not on and it's green if the console is
on<00:02:41.269> and<00:02:41.569> then<00:02:42.049> here<00:02:42.350> are<00:02:42.530> the<00:02:42.560> composite

00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:43.549 
on and then here are the composite

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:44.949 
on and then here are the composite
cables<00:02:43.910> and<00:02:44.060> it<00:02:44.150> comes<00:02:44.360> with<00:02:44.390> I<00:02:44.600> find<00:02:44.840> it

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
cables and it comes with I find it

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:48.309 
cables and it comes with I find it
strange<00:02:45.110> that<00:02:45.319> comes<00:02:45.709> with<00:02:46.810> composite<00:02:47.810> cables

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:48.319 
strange that comes with composite cables

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:51.759 
strange that comes with composite cables
and<00:02:48.890> then<00:02:49.040> I'm<00:02:49.160> guessing<00:02:50.200> behind<00:02:51.200> this<00:02:51.410> foam

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
and then I'm guessing behind this foam

00:02:51.769 --> 00:03:06.570 
and then I'm guessing behind this foam
piece<00:02:52.070> right<00:02:52.400> here<00:02:52.459> is<00:02:53.980> the<00:02:54.980> Xbox<00:02:55.430> so<00:02:55.850> yeah

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.930 

rap<00:03:07.580> like<00:03:07.790> a<00:03:07.820> present<00:03:08.330> almost<00:03:09.700> there<00:03:10.700> it<00:03:10.790> is

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
rap like a present almost there it is

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.630 
rap like a present almost there it is
it's<00:03:11.720> nice<00:03:11.960> that<00:03:11.990> the<00:03:12.770> finish<00:03:13.100> on<00:03:13.280> the<00:03:13.400> sides

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
it's nice that the finish on the sides

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:19.630 
it's nice that the finish on the sides
is<00:03:14.060> a<00:03:14.830> matte<00:03:15.830> finish<00:03:16.100> so<00:03:16.550> you<00:03:16.760> don't<00:03:16.940> get<00:03:18.640> too

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
is a matte finish so you don't get too

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.420 
is a matte finish so you don't get too
many<00:03:19.730> fingerprints<00:03:20.270> on<00:03:20.540> it<00:03:20.570> this<00:03:21.080> is<00:03:21.260> nice<00:03:21.500> the

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
many fingerprints on it this is nice the

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.870 
many fingerprints on it this is nice the
Xbox<00:03:22.880> label<00:03:23.270> is<00:03:23.420> in<00:03:23.540> silver<00:03:24.400> I'm<00:03:25.400> guessing

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
Xbox label is in silver I'm guessing

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.270 
Xbox label is in silver I'm guessing
that's<00:03:25.970> a<00:03:26.180> touch<00:03:26.480> sensitive<00:03:26.950> eject<00:03:27.950> button

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
that's a touch sensitive eject button

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.210 
that's a touch sensitive eject button
