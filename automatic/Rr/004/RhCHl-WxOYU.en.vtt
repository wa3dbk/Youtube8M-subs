just<00:01:38.640> plastic<00:01:39.030> I<00:01:39.150> guess<00:01:39.299> but<00:01:39.479> it<00:01:39.600> feels<00:01:39.780> really

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229

nice to the touch I actually like this a
lot<00:01:41.700> better<00:01:41.759> than<00:01:42.119> pretty<00:01:42.930> much<00:01:42.990> any<00:01:43.229> touchpad

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649
