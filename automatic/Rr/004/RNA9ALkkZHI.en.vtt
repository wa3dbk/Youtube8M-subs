00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
your first piece of elastic simply fold

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.420 
your first piece of elastic simply fold
it<00:00:54.210> over<00:00:54.539> as<00:00:54.800> if<00:00:55.800> you<00:00:55.890> were<00:00:55.980> about<00:00:56.100> to<00:00:56.250> make<00:00:56.370> a

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
it over as if you were about to make a

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.110 
it over as if you were about to make a
figure<00:00:56.640> eight<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:57.739> then<00:00:58.739> just<00:00:59.609> attach<00:00:59.730> the

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120

figure eight and then just attach the
ends<00:01:00.480> here<00:01:01.309> so<00:01:02.309> you<00:01:02.399> can<00:01:02.609> see<00:01:02.789> we've<00:01:02.969> made<00:01:03.239> sure

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
ends here so you can see we've made sure

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.560 
ends here so you can see we've made sure
that<00:01:03.660> our<00:01:04.670> elastic<00:01:05.670> is<00:01:05.820> a<00:01:05.850> figure<00:01:06.270> eight<00:01:06.450> on

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
that our elastic is a figure eight on

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.880 
that our elastic is a figure eight on
both<00:01:06.720> sides<00:01:07.400> so<00:01:08.400> just<00:01:08.610> hold<00:01:08.790> it<00:01:08.909> there<00:01:08.939> and<00:01:09.890> go

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
both sides so just hold it there and go

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.859 
both sides so just hold it there and go
ahead<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:11.430> put<00:01:11.820> a<00:01:12.150> dab<00:01:13.110> of<00:01:13.140> glue<00:01:14.570> on<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.600> end

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
ahead and put a dab of glue on the end

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.200 
ahead and put a dab of glue on the end
and<00:01:16.640> attach

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 
and attach

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.410 
and attach
now<00:01:19.750> what<00:01:20.110> you<00:01:20.200> want<00:01:20.440> to<00:01:20.530> do<00:01:20.650> next<00:01:21.430> looks<00:01:22.270> like

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
now what you want to do next looks like

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.580 
now what you want to do next looks like
this<00:01:22.660> is<00:01:23.430> just<00:01:24.430> really<00:01:24.880> make<00:01:25.570> sure<00:01:25.900> that<00:01:26.290> your

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
this is just really make sure that your

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.220 
this is just really make sure that your
fold<00:01:26.920> makes<00:01:27.790> both<00:01:28.090> of<00:01:28.300> these<00:01:28.480> circles<00:01:28.870> about

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:29.230 
fold makes both of these circles about

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:31.200 
fold makes both of these circles about
the<00:01:29.380> same<00:01:29.560> size<00:01:29.830> so<00:01:30.400> one<00:01:30.520> of<00:01:30.640> ours<00:01:30.760> actually<00:01:30.970> is

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
the same size so one of ours actually is

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.510 
the same size so one of ours actually is
a<00:01:31.300> little<00:01:31.540> bit<00:01:31.720> smaller<00:01:32.350> so<00:01:33.100> we're<00:01:33.250> just<00:01:33.280> going

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
a little bit smaller so we're just going

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.610 
a little bit smaller so we're just going
to<00:01:33.580> move<00:01:33.850> that<00:01:34.060> little<00:01:34.330> fold<00:01:34.660> down<00:01:35.110> a<00:01:35.140> little

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:35.620 
to move that little fold down a little

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.640 
to move that little fold down a little
bit<00:01:36.600> so<00:01:37.600> now<00:01:37.630> when<00:01:38.050> I<00:01:38.080> look<00:01:38.260> at<00:01:38.350> it<00:01:38.410> from<00:01:38.440> the

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:38.650 
bit so now when I look at it from the

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:41.219 
bit so now when I look at it from the
side<00:01:38.860> you<00:01:39.330> can<00:01:40.330> see<00:01:40.510> that<00:01:40.660> both<00:01:40.750> circles<00:01:41.140> are

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229 
side you can see that both circles are

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:43.980 
side you can see that both circles are
about<00:01:41.530> the<00:01:41.680> same<00:01:41.830> size<00:01:42.240> so<00:01:43.240> this<00:01:43.510> is<00:01:43.780> going<00:01:43.930> to

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
about the same size so this is going to

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.870 
about the same size so this is going to
be<00:01:44.110> the<00:01:44.260> back<00:01:44.530> of<00:01:44.740> your<00:01:44.890> little<00:01:45.190> sandal<00:01:45.550> sorry
