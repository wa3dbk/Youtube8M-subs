00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
light in each of them so you can kind of

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:22.370 
light in each of them so you can kind of
aim<00:01:16.380> them<00:01:16.590> in<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.799> right<00:01:16.979> way<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:21.380> that's

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
aim them in the right way and that's

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.580 
aim them in the right way and that's
about<00:01:22.619> it<00:01:22.799> it<00:01:23.520> looks<00:01:23.549> kind<00:01:24.119> of<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.470> looks<00:01:25.470> a

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
about it it looks kind of the looks a

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.359 
about it it looks kind of the looks a
lot<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:26.430> I<00:01:26.640> have<00:01:26.820> it<00:01:26.939> mounted<00:01:27.090> on<00:01:27.420> a<00:01:27.450> tripod

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:28.369 
lot and I have it mounted on a tripod

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:31.760 
lot and I have it mounted on a tripod
and<00:01:29.369> I<00:01:29.909> just<00:01:30.150> put<00:01:30.900> something<00:01:31.320> on<00:01:31.470> there<00:01:31.650> you

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
and I just put something on there you

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:39.160 
and I just put something on there you
can<00:01:32.299> do<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.509> live<00:01:33.750> view<00:01:36.170> let's<00:01:37.170> see<00:01:37.530> if<00:01:37.710> we<00:01:37.890> can

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
can do the live view let's see if we can

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:46.100 
can do the live view let's see if we can
get<00:01:40.170> it<00:01:40.320> back<00:01:42.649> like<00:01:43.649> that<00:01:44.450> we<00:01:45.450> can<00:01:45.659> use<00:01:45.869> the

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
get it back like that we can use the

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.850 
get it back like that we can use the
autofocus<00:01:46.950> in<00:01:47.670> Live<00:01:48.030> View<00:01:48.649> and<00:01:49.649> then

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
autofocus in Live View and then

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.359 
autofocus in Live View and then
basically<00:01:50.960> you<00:01:51.960> know<00:01:52.140> it's<00:01:52.920> a<00:01:52.979> little<00:01:53.159> bit

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
basically you know it's a little bit

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.410 
basically you know it's a little bit
hard<00:01:53.610> to<00:01:53.670> see<00:01:53.970> maybe<00:01:54.240> but<00:01:55.880> like<00:01:56.880> right<00:01:57.149> now

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
hard to see maybe but like right now

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.870 
hard to see maybe but like right now
that<00:01:58.320> would<00:01:58.530> be<00:01:58.710> like<00:01:59.070> a<00:01:59.100> lot<00:01:59.340> of<00:01:59.369> light<00:01:59.640> from

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
that would be like a lot of light from

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.889 
that would be like a lot of light from
the<00:02:00.030> side<00:02:00.270> and<00:02:01.079> we<00:02:01.439> can<00:02:01.469> move<00:02:01.829> around<00:02:02.869> one<00:02:03.869> of

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
the side and we can move around one of

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:10.620 
the side and we can move around one of
the<00:02:04.079> flash<00:02:04.350> to<00:02:04.680> be<00:02:04.829> more<00:02:05.280> from<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:05.640> app<00:02:06.200> and

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.100 

same<00:02:11.630> setup<00:02:13.360> you<00:02:14.360> get<00:02:14.540> a<00:02:14.569> slightly<00:02:14.930> different

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
same setup you get a slightly different

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:21.309 
same setup you get a slightly different
feel<00:02:16.540> you<00:02:17.540> can<00:02:17.750> see<00:02:18.050> or<00:02:18.740> maybe<00:02:18.980> you<00:02:19.190> can't<00:02:20.319> you

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
feel you can see or maybe you can't you

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:24.340 
feel you can see or maybe you can't you
can<00:02:21.500> change<00:02:21.830> the<00:02:22.130> lightning<00:02:22.640> pretty<00:02:23.030> easy<00:02:23.480> and

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
can change the lightning pretty easy and

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.720 
can change the lightning pretty easy and
even<00:02:24.740> more<00:02:24.950> if<00:02:25.370> you<00:02:25.610> think<00:02:26.200> you<00:02:27.200> want<00:02:27.410> to<00:02:27.470> have

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
even more if you think you want to have

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:33.270 
even more if you think you want to have
let's<00:02:28.730> see<00:02:28.970> if<00:02:29.120> you<00:02:29.209> can<00:02:29.420> see<00:02:29.770> if<00:02:30.819> you<00:02:31.819> want<00:02:32.060> to

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
let's see if you can see if you want to

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:49.780 
let's see if you can see if you want to
change<00:02:34.280> the<00:02:34.580> ratio<00:02:35.060> you<00:02:35.620> want<00:02:36.620> to<00:02:36.709> have<00:02:48.790> there

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
change the ratio you want to have there

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.330 
change the ratio you want to have there
you<00:02:49.910> go<00:02:50.060> so<00:02:50.959> I<00:02:50.989> can<00:02:51.080> put<00:02:51.410> more<00:02:51.620> light<00:02:51.830> on<00:02:52.100> one<00:02:52.310> of

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
you go so I can put more light on one of

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.900 
you go so I can put more light on one of
the<00:02:52.550> sides<00:02:53.620> so<00:02:54.620> if<00:02:54.830> we<00:02:54.980> compare<00:02:55.430> we're<00:02:55.760> going

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
the sides so if we compare we're going

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.870 
the sides so if we compare we're going
to<00:02:56.000> take<00:02:56.239> a<00:02:56.269> new<00:02:56.569> photo<00:02:56.930> put<00:02:57.290> on<00:02:57.440> live<00:02:57.680> view

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.530 

there<00:03:01.880> we<00:03:02.090> go

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
there we go

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:16.530 
there we go
and<00:03:02.630> we<00:03:02.959> do<00:03:03.440> that<00:03:03.620> we<00:03:03.890> can<00:03:08.590> take<00:03:09.590> a<00:03:09.620> new<00:03:09.920> photo

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.830 

okay<00:03:17.540> so<00:03:17.810> that's<00:03:18.440> how<00:03:18.590> it<00:03:18.769> looks<00:03:18.799> like<00:03:19.190> that

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
okay so that's how it looks like that

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.949 
okay so that's how it looks like that
it's<00:03:20.840> gotta<00:03:21.019> be<00:03:21.260> like<00:03:21.380> small<00:03:21.739> changes<00:03:22.370> but
