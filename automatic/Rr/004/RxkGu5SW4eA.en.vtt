00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
out there but it's pretty good I'm the

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.999 
out there but it's pretty good I'm the
only<00:01:39.240> reason<00:01:39.329> I<00:01:39.930> say<00:01:40.470> that<00:01:40.500> is<00:01:40.710> because

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
only reason I say that is because

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.280 
only reason I say that is because
sometimes<00:01:41.310> when<00:01:41.640> it<00:01:41.729> rained<00:01:42.000> she<00:01:42.930> might<00:01:43.079> get<00:01:43.229> a

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
sometimes when it rained she might get a

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.469 
sometimes when it rained she might get a
little<00:01:43.439> bit<00:01:43.680> wet<00:01:43.920> where<00:01:44.520> we<00:01:44.670> live<00:01:44.880> in<00:01:45.000> Arizona

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
little bit wet where we live in Arizona

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.010 
little bit wet where we live in Arizona
so<00:01:45.930> I<00:01:45.960> mean<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.500> Sun<00:01:46.740> is<00:01:46.890> just<00:01:47.130> insane<00:01:47.579> so<00:01:48.270> when

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.350 
so I mean the Sun is just insane so when
she<00:01:49.229> was<00:01:49.350> younger<00:01:49.740> like<00:01:50.610> a<00:01:50.640> toddler<00:01:51.149> maybe
