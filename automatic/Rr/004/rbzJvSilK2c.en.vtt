00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:11.690
 hello girls in this video we want 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:15.020
 show you how to do the test of the 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:17.869
 temperature because for those who buy 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:19.789
 a central iron doubt of good 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:22.490
 but what temperature do I need to 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:25.250
 iron martelly for fine hair 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:28.580
 we will use a temperature normally 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:31.849
 the standard temperature of about 130 to 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:35.450
 150 degrees while for a hair of 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:38.780
 normal to coarse will be between 180 and 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:42.050
 the 200 degrees with laura that has a 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:44.090
 normal hair let's start doing in 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.879
 the temperature test with 140 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:49.370
 degrees for it makes a few strands 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:51.800
 but you if you have curly hair 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:55.519
 because directly on your curl that 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:57.980
 yes every iron pass we make 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:01:00.289
 will be in a different lock never on 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.120
 the same thing we're going to start with this one 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:03.960
 ceramics that is that you finish is the new 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:09.920
 casaca daughter mix 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.920
 and let's see what it says at 140 degrees 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:21.990
 As you can see, it has not been able to remove all 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.390
 the wave then 140 degrees for laura 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.260
 they are not then what are we going to do good 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.659
 as the temperature climbed 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:32.090
 and we put it to 150 10 degrees more 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:33.560
 and we take another lock we wait for the 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:37.490
 iron is hot that is is 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.960
 very fast and we passed the iron for the 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.320
 lock 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.869
 to a normal diversity that we go to 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:48.680
 then to use the same is not 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:51.909
 it is wrong and we are going up now 160 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.909
 we take another lock 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:02:00.510
 and passing it through the bed at 160 degrees 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:12.180
 we see that already he is becoming better 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:15.150
 but still need 10 more degrees 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:18.080
 we take another mention that the curly and 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:21.160
 wait is already 170 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.160
 we are going 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.030
 its its temperature as you see it is 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.280
 perfectly smooth no wave is left 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.520
 then the ideal temperature for laura 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:39.390
 would be 170 degrees you will ask me for sure 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:41.220
 that yes with titanium and with ceramic is 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.990
 uses the same temperature as if the 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.970
 truth is that it does not vary the test is done 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:47.280
 same and the temperature that is 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.620
 would correspond neurological droplet is the 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.319
 same and nothing else I hope this video 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.800
 I have been very useful and see you at 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:54.800
 following
