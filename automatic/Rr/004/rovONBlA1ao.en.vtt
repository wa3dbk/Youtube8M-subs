00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:09.800
 great desire for all the boys and 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.900
 welcome to this new video I am 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:14.059
 I went down while I'm here to talk to you 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.460
 of some news about arc survival 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:17.689
 evolving the latest news confirm that 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.640
 the game developers have 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:22.039
 announced a $ 100 reward 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.320
 who will be able to find one with explor 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:27.019
 yes you heard right but the list does not 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.119
 however, it includes a bot speed dark or even 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:31.160
 for the experience but includes all this 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:32.390
 which can have an impact on the gameplay or 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.250
 on the stability of official servers 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.080
 so far I have been a user 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.790
 rewarded by having apple they have 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.590
 explained the developers that the whole 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.330
 procedure requested a couple of hours before 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.550
 to complete the economic transaction 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.780
 an initiative without a doubt laudable but 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.790
 I'm curious how to proceed 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.160
 from the experiment possible gain or 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.660
 simple exclusive to sell more copies 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.160
 so far the game in second 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.350
 ranking position with more 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.910
 earnings in fourth position as a game 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.710
 most sold already we notice 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.060
 approximately that values ​​on 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.000
 sales give us positive feedback 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:04.369
 on the game in fact also on stage ed 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.970
 evolve is a new open world indeed 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:06.770
 breathtaking 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.350
 but let's go into details the game is 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.420
 developed with the real engine iv and is a 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.370
 classic survival only with the addition of 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.810
 dinosaurs and exotic creatures like 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.250
 dragons and the like 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.230
 the plot of the game as we already have 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.910
 understood is to survive 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:22.490
 in fact the players wake up on 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:24.530
 a beach and have to hunt cultivate 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.730
 is to create objects to survive in 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.290
 first minutes of bows are 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:29.270
 characterized by the creation of 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.010
 character we can choose between 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.990
 muscular guy peeled vaguely 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:35.060
 threatening is a woman endowed with 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.650
 unfailing bikini for historical less 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.300
 of personalization is enough 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.580
 lackluster regarding the 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.440
 hair and facial features but it is 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.490
 incredibly detailed for all 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.409
 other parts of the body 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.540
 within arc we could die of 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:49.820
 thirst for hunger for our fault of a 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.080
 dinosaur because of poison or why 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.300
 is another envious player of 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.280
 our resources or simply want 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.740
 to attack us to avoid being 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.020
 disturbed we can always opt for a 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.150
 pb server and even if we take that away 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.220
 that thin shudder given to cross 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.690
 other players and collaborate as one 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.590
 team makes it revealed that others there 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:08.660
 do the skin 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.429
 if desired, it is also possible to form 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.560
 alliances from players to share 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:14.360
 resources and crafting projects is 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.099
 quite rudimentary in the first minutes 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.379
 of play it is very important to create 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:20.930
 tools to collect wood from stones 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:23.269
 fibers and straw fundamental elements for 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.220
 hunt create a bed and warm up 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:27.410
 to do this we will have to take some 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.090
 trees and collect stones we can do so 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.129
 built a pickaxe that will make the 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.959
 work more efficient and less painful 

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:34.640
 to calm the first pangs of hunger 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:36.920
 we could feed on the berries from 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.510
 bushes are careful to eat alone 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.700
 the right ones avoiding those that 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.440
 they bring sleep or serve, then there is another 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.239
 which makes arca a title rather 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.610
 funny and has limits of ridicule 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:48.709
 the poop periodically our alter ego 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.840
 will do one of the most natural activities of the 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:52.519
 world and expel their feces that 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.110
 can be collected and used for 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:55.730
 fertilize the thirty days 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.739
 there is even a special button that 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.840
 lets you do it on command of course 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:01.489
 not always to use to avoid 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.329
 to waste the precious for tili zante 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:04.220
 around the island 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:05.720
 all the simple initial activities there 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.910
 will allow you to accumulate points 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.390
 experience and amount gradually ours 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.280
 levels 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.959
 at each level we can put a point 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.959
 among our features like 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:17.959
 endurance hunger thirst give melee 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:19.519
 health and unlock some in g what else 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:21.709
 they are nothing but projects of what 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:23.389
 we can build these in g go 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:24.319
 from the simple stone 

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:26.870
 automatic rifles 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:28.819
 yes it is enough to have the metal passing through 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:31.040
 the wooden houses and the seven because beyond 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:32.720
 dinosaurs passion dinosaurs 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.940
 arc will not only allow us to admire 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.680
 these majestic animals but we could 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.349
 even tame them and ride them 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.340
 obviously if they are big enough 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:42.349
 The procedure for doing this is theoretically 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.030
 simple enough to get the 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:45.980
 our walking dinosaur will have to 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.230
 drink with a poisoned arrow an 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.209
 plant shot or hitting it several times a 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.980
 that point we should treat him and give him from 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:53.720
 eat his favorite food from 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.280
 beasts that can be domesticated there 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.010
 and their saurians are those who spit 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:00.380
 poison jurassic park the dodo the parks 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:02.359
 mullet saurian the velociraptor and even 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:04.400
 the whole art will guarantee you the 

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:05.870
 incredible shifting ability in 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.790
 Theory also includes scorpions 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.500
 giant dragons and other beasts 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.810
 fantastic and on one side and out of tune 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.160
 dinosaur limestone on the other add 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.620
 undoubtedly a nice core effect 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.359
 graph at least until a scorpion does not 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.189
 it poisons us 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:19.719
 kill taming a dinosaur of 

00:04:18.189 --> 00:04:21.489
 medium size is not however 

00:04:19.719 --> 00:04:23.169
 a simple undertaking if you are not a part 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:25.210
 of a well organized group 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:26.860
 it is not unusual to reconnect to the game 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.110
 after a few hours break to find the 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:31.509
 our home devastated stolen resources 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:33.550
 I leave alter ego killed this besides ad 

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:35.469
 being frustrating makes the profession 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:36.669
 of the game even slower and you can 

00:04:35.469 --> 00:04:38.770
 hold on early on 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:40.419
 arc exploration can be 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:42.370
 fascinating and revealing a number of 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:44.020
 all puzzles still to be explained either 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.729
 above and below the water surface 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:47.590
 they are indeed hidden caves 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:49.659
 guarded by particularly monsters 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:51.430
 as fierce as a gigantic spider 

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:52.719
 where you can find rare resources 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:54.849
 and clues to the mysteries they surround 

00:04:52.719 --> 00:04:56.590
 no one will explain the island to us 

00:04:54.849 --> 00:04:57.819
 what are the three obelisks that serve 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:59.050
 stand out in the sky 

00:04:57.819 --> 00:05:00.580
 now a diamond-shaped object 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:02.409
 that someone implanted us on the 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.969
 less intent arm will tell us why 

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:05.979
 we ended up on the island in the state 

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:07.990
 Also present is a survival game evolves 

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:09.370
 there is the interesting man despite the 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:11.289
 name there is nothing particularly 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:13.270
 evolved with respect to the qualities of standards 

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:14.800
 of this kind of games and to his 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:16.330
 internal we can find all the points 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.250
 of strength and weaknesses of the various 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:19.930
 survival offered at a price a little 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:21.849
 too high for what is not even 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:23.740
 a beta the developers promised 

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:25.990
 of the game will improve a lot in the next ones 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:27.129
 months that there will be new content is a 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:27.849
 lots of other small and large 

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:30.039
 change 

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:31.690
 so and we are confident because in 

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:32.560
 some arc moments is definitely 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:33.729
 funny 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.250
 in my opinion the game is enough 

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:38.319
 appreciated by online communities though 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:40.180
 the gag there are still present 

00:05:38.319 --> 00:05:42.190
 slow progression and intelligence 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:44.110
 very little artificial dinosaurs 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:46.240
 reactive who knows of the game could 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:48.129
 demonstrate the best survival of the year 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.199
 in the meantime we await the improvements 

00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:52.000
 I hope you enjoy the video course if 

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:53.529
 you want to leave a commented like 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.569
 saying you think its game for 

00:05:53.529 --> 00:05:57.930
 this video is all a greeting from sugar 

00:05:55.569 --> 00:05:57.930
 blue
