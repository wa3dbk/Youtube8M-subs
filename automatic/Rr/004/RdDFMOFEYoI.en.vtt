00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.879
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.770
 small round minecraft chamber and also 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.630
 at the same time for a little info like 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.280
 you are here at this point and indeed 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.840
 I'm sure you've noticed that I'm in 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.980
 lately not so active 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.599
 youtube is not really much 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.460
 upload and generally everything with me so 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.320
 a little bit down the drain 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.789
 yes so it has several reasons first 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.140
 I had to go now 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.119
 subsequently several things 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.460
 take care of my move 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.500
 Shot was just that kind of case but 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.630
 that sony with the epic melee 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.830
 everything goes back to life very well 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.520
 half of them are coming 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.690
 Maybe it was so and that came to it 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.129
 even that I have a pretty long time now 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.140
 time was pretty cold I was fine 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.059
 pretty much shit i knew 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.340
 at first not what's going on because 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.110
 I somehow I have to be honest 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.940
 I did not say damn long 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.739
 caught a cold or sick or had a cold 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.940
 or something like that and I have that 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.410
 At first, somehow I can really 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.520
 may have noticed stupid now maybe 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.850
 then I thought that too 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.500
 Sleep is at least I am 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.300
 now a bit again 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.770
 better than the ugly I am 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.120
 now much better draw the 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.100
 is almost completely gone I 've got 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.080
 still a bit sore but sometimes 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.729
 otherwise it is also under me again 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.290
 wonderful then regarding the battle 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.780
 season he actually had a lot too 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.299
 more should actually be done 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.159
 I wanted to finish this so far 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.180
 have that weekend actually 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.250
 sometimes a trailer comes 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.780
 probably yesterday should actually 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:26.700
 times so trailer come to be 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:29.400
 if you let me not even a 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.700
 shoot down arrow well 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.890
 unfortunately you were already a bit and 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.210
 Part of the reason why I have 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.930
 not exactly a case with the case missing 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:42.360
 oh well then we do the good 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:44.189
 soul was the school to take 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.270
 more young but I'm going there now 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.540
 do not go into the water like me then 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.250
 Any tip can shoot so yes 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.420
 So at least that should be there too 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.189
 were much more planned 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.570
 but that will come back anyway 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.649
 I'm moving a bit, you know 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.600
 You know how it works at some point 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.520
 Something always comes in between or 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.150
 you just burn something to that 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.160
 promise wanted us on 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:05.260
 and this time has no longer the 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:08.800
 blame any case also briefly to 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:10.690
 new season so we have the up 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.220
 now so really considered the some 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.430
 should and want to be different 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:18.130
 better because we really really 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:21.490
 really cool ideas or right 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:25.180
 really cool idea for the new 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:26.200
 you just did not hit it that way 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.560
 at least I have one really there 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.490
 really good idea for it and us 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.820
 actually look forward to the 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:36.370
 new season with what you do now 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:39.370
 hear and see and get through with that 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.750
 snapshots for the minecraft 1.7 could 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.550
 actually wait until the 1.7 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.170
 but that would be so over the top 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.209
 takes a long time because I ask my 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:49.209
 I introduce myself in the minecraft 1.7 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:50.980
 I battle my these two blocks kase 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:53.410
 and bland and everything you can find so far 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:57.970
 seen this very new biome has that 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:03:00.580
 would be extremely cool but yes that would 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.110
 take too long and to date 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.630
 anything at all possible again 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:09.040
 would be clever to lose synonymous with plugins 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:12.130
 he also some plugins some mods resp 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.540
 as a plug ins in connection with us 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:17.280
 that we are a bit stupid again 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:19.090
 that's why I really liked it 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.950
 Not at all, I do not know if she is 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.940
 but notice when I talk and then 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.350
 something like that 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.950
 Oh come on, let's do a round 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:29.050
 it's a bit difficult that way 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.160
 to do so because when you talk 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.600
 then you do not concentrate that way 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.160
 really , but I can say that 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:37.680
 even know do better 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:40.030
 yes, thank you, you also fresh criticism 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.160
 this parody still hangs 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:46.480
 I 'm pretty much at it 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:47.920
 not stupid believe mama yes so me 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.560
 think you will now through my 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:54.269
 incredible that again just for 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:56.560
 he just hits me like that 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:58.660
 she is going through my confusing 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.790
 I really hope to talk now 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:03.260
 know what is currently going on 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.209
 this state of general 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.799
 the general brook go down it 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:08.060
 a channel can also be quite up 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:08.689
 to the next weekend keep it up 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:09.950
 stop 

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:11.629
 I do not really have it right now either 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:12.860
 I do not know what to do 

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:14.629
 I have a lot of ultra project 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.040
 recorded but somehow I even come 

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:17.829
 not being able to really follow, the 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:19.669
 generally because I'm currently 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:20.870
 very nice, I thought that 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:23.510
 I meet do not I currently 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:26.570
 really very little time and me 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:28.820
 I do not know why but I will 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:31.120
 now it is never two that is just 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:33.500
 more often so currently with me 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:36.169
 So it all works out that I stop 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.340
 just now through the cold 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:41.090
 have less time and now 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:42.590
 also yes it under pressure makes me right 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:45.169
 a lot of buck to record or somehow 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:46.400
 I did not enjoy it that much 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:48.919
 all the editing of the videos 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:53.150
 appear and race mainly because 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:55.430
 I also have a few problems at the moment 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:57.229
 i like my system and wisely 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:59.419
 a little bit littered with the 

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:01.100
 one or the other program and that now 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:03.260
 will actually start over again soon 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:05.270
 and it would be all about backup 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.979
 I do not know so I have several 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:09.680
 hard drives with multiple files and the 

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:13.360
 of course I have to secure everything 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:16.550
 vulnerable now but no big thing though 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:18.949
 Stop that way I always prefer 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:20.419
 for sure, and backups so one 

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:22.699
 Complete plate copying is somehow 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:23.990
 also stupid if you have something in the 

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:26.570
 one night you know that 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:28.699
 I am the one I am currently seeing 

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:30.320
 even just can i was so bad in 

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:34.910
 this round though I here the whole 

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:37.400
 time is fine so I think so far 

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:38.990
 modest and the two I would say 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.570
 I also pulled the round one myself 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:43.160
 a little bit to the end if you generally more 

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:44.979
 to follow one in the chamber 

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:48.470
 you like to write that to me 

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:51.169
 that was just right if that has 

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:53.840
 something of fail I really do not know what 

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:57.260
 sometimes it starts with me but so does you 

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:57.590
 midi real i have met why 

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.320
 always 

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:03.050
 I wonder especially Sometimes 

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:05.449
 bad quits are also good at 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:07.150
 So become other players 

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:09.610
 I want to say that we get us 

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:11.890
 We should not hit that, unfortunately 

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:13.870
 just miss is also over 

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:16.570
 but I still have two lives and I am 

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:17.560
 currently still the best with five 

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:20.170
 score advantage 

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:21.220
 I can do that so bad for that 

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:22.930
 that I'm not really that 

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:25.840
 looked forward with chamber and that 

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:26.920
 actual occasional games can become 

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:28.390
 That's really something to be proud of 

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:30.280
 Especially since I'm really the 

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:32.140
 indulge in all the time silly convincing from me 

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:34.000
 most will never say again if I am 

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:38.290
 Repeat this time too often 

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:40.210
 and yes that's right 

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:41.710
 actually quite good and that is how it is here 

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:44.110
 I can not believe we have length 

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:46.300
 in january at so i even have one more 

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:47.260
 live and still six years was 

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:49.240
 already with the round and I have 

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:51.760
 really with has pretty much distance 

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:55.180
 So I have to win this myself 

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:57.040
 that was it then I think so too 

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:58.960
 this video as I said I'm sorry 

00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:00.490
 if I keep fetching myself and 

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:01.900
 I was totally funny because of 

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:02.430
 a cold and so on and so on 

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:05.110
 on 

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:08.070
 I say goodbye then here and 

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:08.070
 switches
