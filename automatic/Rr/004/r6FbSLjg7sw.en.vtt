00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:11.910
 youtube are welcome in this 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.070
 brand new video today we talk about it again 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.740
 of how where when the series where i 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.199
 I'm talking about the four battlefield weapons 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.180
 weapons that I remind you that I propose to you 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.340
 on the fan page you can vote for that 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:27.180
 of the 3 that I propose to you that tastes 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:31.470
 much of mood more and so I will review it 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:35.489
 in the following episode , today's weapon 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:38.190
 which m2 49 mg 4 or type 88 this is 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.920
 was my question on the fan page 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:44.610
 of facebook is actually today we will review 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:47.399
 two m24 weapons nine items 4 for a 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.680
 simple reason makes no sense 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.710
 make two separate videos for two weapons which 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.120
 they are identical 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.469
 now since you won't believe it 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:00.989
 look at the statistics m 249 emg 4 800 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.090
 strokes per minute of rato 620 meters per 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.150
 second speed of the 930 projectile 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:09.780
 meters the maximum range 25 the damage with 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:12.360
 a drop start that starts at 8 meters damage 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:18.299
 minimum of 18 over it 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:20.070
 whom then will you hit him 200 strokes 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.259
 in the magazine 6.2 seconds per 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.759
 recharge with a handicap of 0 85 per 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:30.540
 when recharging with the empty chamber e 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:33.030
 03 25 04 recoil that's the only difference 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:36.990
 the recoil that horizontally like 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:41.070
 see for the medium 49 10 45 03 for the 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:44.100
 magic 4 0 204 then lower and more 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:47.009
 high but the vertical recoil then 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:50.299
 what lemme g4 recoils in more 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.869
 vertically leme 249 recoils it 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:53.549
 horizontally it looks like a sentence 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.229
 very ugly but it is reality we are alone 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.450
 speaking of the movement of the weapon indeed 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.930
 also handicaps for shooting in 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.759
 movement are exactly the same 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.040
 now they will be two weapons if you go to 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.080
 maybe even see a graph you will know of 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.110
 of the spread of the spread of the 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:12.990
 bullets may even be 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.450
 somewhat different for a minimum 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.550
 but just use them in game vi 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.680
 I remember that for my 249 have to do 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:23.250
 the countryside and let yours die 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.900
 little irish boy let's say you have to perform 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.540
 this choice to get this weapon 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.220
 otherwise you will get the 90 fee by killing 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.470
 the girl if you fail completely not me 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.390
 I absolutely remember what weapon you unlock 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.550
 in any case it was said that it will be enough 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.680
 try a little bit of everything 2 to make yourself 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.450
 I realize that if I'm not really teeth 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.000
 that maybe changes the sound a little but 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.520
 have the same type of use as the 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.470
 light machine gun with high degree of 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.880
 fire are those with the rate of fire 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.830
 higher within the 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:53.640
 light machine guns you find in 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:55.680
 battlefield 4 and this we say comes from 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:03:00.080
 self that leads to the fact that they are 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:02.940
 excellent weapons in cmq then a weapon 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.050
 very suitable for the close range and above all 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.239
 for both 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.920
 if you mount a nice viewfinder 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:09.750
 laser a silencer for the reasons that 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.360
 we are going to explain in fact we speak a 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.370
 moment of load out with which I would go on 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.290
 battlefield of this weapon the only one 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.840
 parameter that changes between these two weapons 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:21.060
 and the recoil that in reality is neither more 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.650
 strong horizontally on one and higher 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.560
 vertically on the other well yes it is 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:28.739
 because the emmegi 4 as you see at 104 of 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.600
 penalty while the m24 9 to 0 3 25 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:32.040
 vice versa for horizontal ones there are 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.930
 again the slightest differences between the 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.489
 two in essence there is not even a weapon 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.190
 where it is preferable to use a compensator 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:41.720
 an adombrano by mouth because both of them 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:44.370
 recoil in a somewhat strange way 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.500
 asymmetrical not purely vertical 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.299
 so let's try to understand in the face 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.890
 of the statistics we have seen how 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:52.739
 go and throw on the battlefield 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:54.780
 to these weapons because they are definitely 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:57.000
 interesting let's start talking 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:59.790
 obviously of the cane as always 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:03.180
 because we can mount let's say the nose 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:05.020
 Jews who made up for it but this if not 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.090
 we have a very good rowe control of the 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:08.740
 recoil so if we are not so good 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.900
 to make gusts all controlled 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:12.490
 at the mouse or controller level towards 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.690
 the lower left towards the right in 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:15.670
 based on where the Rome pushes the most 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:18.370
 Well surely that these accessories 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:20.350
 make it easier especially in some 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.420
 nip fire situations maybe when not 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:24.070
 you are aiming to have a little more weapon 

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:26.110
 firm will give you that touch of precision 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.970
 plus it can make the difference 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:30.340
 especially if you try to aim at 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:33.040
 head up close to jumping on the back 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:35.380
 an enemy but I do not exclude that to some 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:37.630
 of you may like the heavy barrel 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:40.090
 because it adds precision to the fire 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:42.850
 targeted so you can above all 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:45.790
 on distances let us say it over 5 10 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:48.400
 meters be much more effective but 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:50.170
 my absolute favorite and the 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:53.590
 silence seems one does not see you in 

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:55.210
 minimum 2t calms down a lot 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:57.580
 the weapon by removing a lot of recoil 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:59.590
 I remember that takes away the scope to 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:02.050
 bullet does not take away damage then 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:04.180
 if you are playing cicu by the 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:06.130
 limit of 8 meters in which the damage of the 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.990
 bullets starts to fall 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:10.150
 this project will simply be a 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:11.920
 a little slower but since I'm already 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:14.290
 those two are excellent speeds 

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:16.900
 light machine gun I both 

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:17.650
 I would use it with the silencer and not 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.600
 only 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:21.940
 in fact we go to the gadgets I would go 

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:24.820
 absolutely rather than a magnifier that 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:27.220
 it's not so much the case with these weapons 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:29.230
 maybe then it will be that of a m60 that 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:32.290
 will be used a little more distant or 

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:34.090
 a 40 m2 m2 that removes 34 in the distances 

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:36.360
 get closer well for this weapon 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:38.430
 I'd go all my life on a laser site 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:41.230
 that would be the laser sight 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:43.840
 simply for a reason that the nip 

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:45.670
 fire these weapons become monsters 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:47.860
 the cruise becomes very narrow 

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:50.230
 and you can go and shoot without it 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:51.910
 admire chopping people on people 

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:54.330
 imagine you have just entered one 

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:57.160
 room is all defending a charge 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:58.300
 they just come without it 

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.890
 admire and have a precision 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:02.260
 really embarrassing between the 

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:03.700
 silencer and laser sight will be 

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:06.850
 all in your favor 

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:08.800
 as for the grip the penalty 

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:11.080
 from first strike it is not exaggerated for 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:13.900
 be a real machine gun then allen 

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:15.910
 gaulle grip that I like so much you can 

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:17.710
 alternate maybe even a little roof top 

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:20.139
 which will make you lift the weapon over 

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:21.580
 hurry and don't do strange double meanings 

00:06:20.139 --> 00:06:24.280
 because it is true that the potato is advancing 

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:25.960
 many things but certainly not elite 

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:27.639
 machine gun close this video 

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:29.949
 speaking of camouflage because second 

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:32.110
 me if you don't go around with these 

00:06:29.949 --> 00:06:33.970
 portable guns with a type camouflage 

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:36.880
 black shark there is something extremely 

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:38.979
 tamarro you are not really none 

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:41.830
 you can go around with a 4 mg with a 

00:06:38.979 --> 00:06:44.080
 m 2 49 shooting people with sights 

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:45.960
 laser and silencer with camouflage friends 

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:48.610
 black then there must be at least 

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:51.430
 obviously two colors of tone 

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:54.340
 possibly the most diametrically 

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:57.400
 opposite possible and flamboyant you have 

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:59.440
 present the hidden and stelter things with 

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:01.120
 it must be such by you 

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:03.190
 those who go around have it 

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:05.110
 see you in the big and colorful 

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:08.039
 next commented videos provided if 

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:08.039
 you want to sign up 

00:07:15.249 --> 00:07:17.879
 she 

00:07:22.729 --> 00:07:25.029
 I wanted
