00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
we also know what's right and what's

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.020 
we also know what's right and what's
fair<00:01:18.080> and<00:01:18.290> we're<00:01:18.530> trying<00:01:18.770> to<00:01:18.890> not<00:01:19.580> only<00:01:19.790> just

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
fair and we're trying to not only just

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.570

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
history of our league and how so often

history of our league and how so often
it<00:01:59.540> keeps<00:01:59.780> coming<00:02:00.110> back<00:02:00.140> to<00:02:00.409> the<00:02:00.530> same<00:02:00.770> thing<00:02:01.070> I

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
it keeps coming back to the same thing I

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.340 
it keeps coming back to the same thing I
think<00:02:01.310> the<00:02:01.610> goal<00:02:01.850> here<00:02:02.270> especially<00:02:02.780> from<00:02:03.200> the

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
think the goal here especially from the

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.770 
think the goal here especially from the
player<00:02:03.590> standpoint<00:02:04.280> is<00:02:04.430> to<00:02:04.460> find<00:02:05.330> something

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
player standpoint is to find something

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.780 
player standpoint is to find something
that<00:02:05.810> like<00:02:06.140> I<00:02:06.260> said<00:02:06.290> is<00:02:06.680> fair<00:02:06.979> and<00:02:07.220> reasonable

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 
that like I said is fair and reasonable

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.660 
that like I said is fair and reasonable
and<00:02:08.330> is<00:02:08.420> something<00:02:08.780> that<00:02:08.899> we<00:02:09.049> can<00:02:09.340> instill<00:02:10.340> for

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
and is something that we can instill for

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.130 
and is something that we can instill for
years<00:02:10.879> to<00:02:11.060> come<00:02:11.299> where<00:02:11.599> we're<00:02:11.840> not<00:02:11.989> going<00:02:12.110> to

years to come where we're not going to

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.500 
years to come where we're not going to
have
