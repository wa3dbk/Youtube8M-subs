00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:23.940 
itself if you also notice I'm not sure

itself if you also notice I'm not sure
if<00:01:24.030> this<00:01:24.180> one<00:01:24.420> is<00:01:24.600> but<00:01:24.840> as<00:01:24.990> I'm<00:01:25.530> looking<00:01:25.560> at<00:01:25.890> the

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.010 
if this one is but as I'm looking at the

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:28.790 
if this one is but as I'm looking at the
incubator<00:01:26.610> as<00:01:26.760> a<00:01:26.940> whole<00:01:27.530> many<00:01:28.530> of<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.740> eggs

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:28.800 
incubator as a whole many of the eggs

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.600 
incubator as a whole many of the eggs
will<00:01:29.420> randomly<00:01:30.420> move<00:01:30.660> a<00:01:31.280> Cheeks<00:01:32.280> I<00:01:32.430> guess

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
will randomly move a Cheeks I guess

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.010 
will randomly move a Cheeks I guess
you're<00:01:32.820> inside<00:01:33.120> deciding<00:01:33.600> if<00:01:33.690> they<00:01:33.780> want<00:01:33.960> to

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
you're inside deciding if they want to

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.080 
you're inside deciding if they want to
come<00:01:34.140> out<00:01:34.320> and<00:01:34.500> right<00:01:34.590> but<00:01:35.580> like<00:01:35.640> I<00:01:35.760> said<00:01:35.940> we're

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
come out and right but like I said we're

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.020 
come out and right but like I said we're
on<00:01:36.150> day<00:01:36.300> 20<00:01:36.720> so<00:01:37.440> they've<00:01:38.340> got<00:01:38.490> another<00:01:38.670> couple

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
on day 20 so they've got another couple

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.710 
on day 20 so they've got another couple
days<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.420> go<00:01:39.600> they<00:01:40.020> get<00:01:40.260> fully<00:01:41.090> hatched<00:01:42.090> out<00:01:42.390> I

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
days to go they get fully hatched out I

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.050 
days to go they get fully hatched out I
pull<00:01:43.530> back<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.860> camera<00:01:44.160> angle<00:01:44.430> where<00:01:44.880> you<00:01:44.910> can

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
pull back the camera angle where you can

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.080 
pull back the camera angle where you can
see<00:01:45.210> all<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.510> eggs<00:01:45.690> here<00:01:46.400> what<00:01:47.400> we'll<00:01:47.550> do<00:01:47.790> is

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
see all the eggs here what we'll do is

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
are moving quite right now randomly I

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.180 
are moving quite right now randomly I
guess<00:02:06.750> that's<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.020> chicks<00:02:07.290> trying<00:02:07.590> to<00:02:07.740> get

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
guess that's the chicks trying to get

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.059 
guess that's the chicks trying to get
ready<00:02:08.369> to<00:02:08.459> peep<00:02:08.640> out<00:02:08.819> and<00:02:09.269> also<00:02:10.049> you<00:02:10.109> can<00:02:10.409> you

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
ready to peep out and also you can you

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.649 
ready to peep out and also you can you
can<00:02:11.219> hear<00:02:11.430> I've<00:02:11.609> tried<00:02:11.819> to<00:02:12.000> put<00:02:12.540> the

00:02:12.649 --> 00:02:12.659 
can hear I've tried to put the

00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:14.209 
can hear I've tried to put the
microphone<00:02:12.870> up<00:02:13.349> to<00:02:13.469> where<00:02:13.620> you<00:02:13.709> can<00:02:13.920> hear<00:02:14.129> them

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:14.219 
microphone up to where you can hear them

00:02:14.219 --> 00:02:16.880 
microphone up to where you can hear them
but<00:02:14.310> they<00:02:14.370> they<00:02:15.239> they<00:02:16.019> make<00:02:16.200> their<00:02:16.379> sound<00:02:16.620> so

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
but they they they make their sound so

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.550 
but they they they make their sound so
randomly<00:02:17.510> I'm<00:02:18.510> not<00:02:18.719> really<00:02:18.870> sure<00:02:19.140> if<00:02:19.260> I<00:02:19.349> got

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
randomly I'm not really sure if I got

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.069 
randomly I'm not really sure if I got
any<00:02:19.739> good<00:02:20.069> footage<00:02:20.280> of<00:02:20.640> it<00:02:20.790> but<00:02:21.480> we'll<00:02:21.930> come

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:22.079 
any good footage of it but we'll come

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:24.229 
any good footage of it but we'll come
back<00:02:22.109> again<00:02:22.409> I<00:02:22.769> wouldn't<00:02:23.219> see<00:02:23.430> some<00:02:23.670> further

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
back again I wouldn't see some further

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:46.940 
back again I wouldn't see some further
development<00:02:24.900> and<00:02:25.159> take<00:02:26.159> a<00:02:26.189> look<00:02:26.400> from<00:02:26.549> there

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.550 

okay<00:02:47.950> now<00:02:48.070> that<00:02:48.220> we've<00:02:48.340> removed<00:02:49.350> ten<00:02:50.350> of<00:02:50.470> the

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
okay now that we've removed ten of the

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.470 
okay now that we've removed ten of the
twelve<00:02:50.800> cheats<00:02:51.190> not<00:02:51.490> an<00:02:51.580> incubator<00:02:51.970> a<00:02:52.270> light

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
twelve cheats not an incubator a light

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.780 
twelve cheats not an incubator a light
focus<00:02:52.870> on<00:02:53.020> these<00:02:53.170> three<00:02:53.380> eggs<00:02:53.740> to<00:02:53.860> see<00:02:54.070> what

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
focus on these three eggs to see what

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.210 
focus on these three eggs to see what
type<00:02:55.000> of<00:02:55.080> development<00:02:56.080> we<00:02:56.200> get<00:02:56.380> on<00:02:56.560> the

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
type of development we get on the

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.790 
type of development we get on the
hatching<00:02:57.640> I've<00:02:57.850> also<00:02:58.030> left<00:02:58.360> to<00:02:59.200> the<00:02:59.350> chicks<00:02:59.590> in

00:02:59.790 --> 00:02:59.800 
hatching I've also left to the chicks in

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.790 
hatching I've also left to the chicks in
there<00:03:00.300> hopefully<00:03:01.300> their<00:03:01.690> noise<00:03:01.870> and<00:03:02.350> peeping

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
there hopefully their noise and peeping

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.090 
there hopefully their noise and peeping
will<00:03:03.420> go<00:03:04.420> ahead<00:03:04.720> and<00:03:04.840> encourage<00:03:05.800> the<00:03:05.920> other

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
will go ahead and encourage the other

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:07.350 
will go ahead and encourage the other
chicks<00:03:06.460> to<00:03:06.610> go<00:03:06.730> ahead<00:03:06.790> and<00:03:06.970> come<00:03:07.060> out<00:03:07.210> of<00:03:07.300> the

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
chicks to go ahead and come out of the

00:03:07.360 --> 00:05:53.719 
chicks to go ahead and come out of the
shell

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:53.729 

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:56.609 

we're<00:05:54.729> the<00:05:54.849> innovation<00:05:55.809> process<00:05:55.929> and<00:05:56.529> we've

00:05:56.609 --> 00:05:56.619 
we're the innovation process and we've

00:05:56.619 --> 00:05:59.129 
we're the innovation process and we've
had<00:05:56.830> 15<00:05:57.399> chicks<00:05:57.729> hatch<00:05:57.999> out<00:05:58.360> of<00:05:58.419> rags<00:05:58.869> we<00:05:59.019> had

00:05:59.129 --> 00:05:59.139 
had 15 chicks hatch out of rags we had

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:01.739 
had 15 chicks hatch out of rags we had
21<00:05:59.469> to<00:05:59.739> start<00:06:00.009> with<00:06:00.249> two<00:06:00.909> of<00:06:01.029> our<00:06:01.149> eggs<00:06:01.360> work

00:06:01.739 --> 00:06:01.749 
21 to start with two of our eggs work

00:06:01.749 --> 00:06:03.779 
21 to start with two of our eggs work
not<00:06:02.289> any<00:06:02.499> good<00:06:02.739> then<00:06:02.949> the<00:06:03.069> other<00:06:03.279> four<00:06:03.550> just

00:06:03.779 --> 00:06:03.789 
not any good then the other four just

00:06:03.789 --> 00:06:06.540 
not any good then the other four just
did<00:06:03.909> not<00:06:04.059> make<00:06:04.269> it<00:06:04.619> the<00:06:05.619> chick<00:06:05.889> here<00:06:06.129> that<00:06:06.369> else

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:06.550 
did not make it the chick here that else

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:08.699 
did not make it the chick here that else
is<00:06:06.789> holding<00:06:07.119> almost<00:06:07.539> it<00:06:08.019> makes<00:06:08.289> it<00:06:08.439> he<00:06:08.559> was

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:08.709 
is holding almost it makes it he was

00:06:08.709 --> 00:06:12.089 
is holding almost it makes it he was
stuck<00:06:08.949> to<00:06:08.979> his<00:06:09.219> shell<00:06:09.459> we<00:06:09.879> easily<00:06:10.919> removed<00:06:11.919> the

00:06:12.089 --> 00:06:12.099 
stuck to his shell we easily removed the

00:06:12.099 --> 00:06:14.249 
stuck to his shell we easily removed the
shell<00:06:12.309> itself<00:06:12.729> and<00:06:13.029> we<00:06:13.119> found<00:06:13.300> out<00:06:13.569> that<00:06:13.839> the

00:06:14.249 --> 00:06:14.259 
shell itself and we found out that the

00:06:14.259 --> 00:06:16.919 
shell itself and we found out that the
membrane<00:06:14.679> on<00:06:14.919> his<00:06:15.069> back<00:06:15.369> had<00:06:16.149> dried<00:06:16.449> out<00:06:16.479> he

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:16.929 
membrane on his back had dried out he

00:06:16.929 --> 00:06:18.749 
membrane on his back had dried out he
was<00:06:17.050> stuck<00:06:17.289> to<00:06:17.319> it<00:06:17.679> so<00:06:17.919> what<00:06:18.099> we<00:06:18.129> did<00:06:18.369> we<00:06:18.580> took

00:06:18.749 --> 00:06:18.759 
was stuck to it so what we did we took

00:06:18.759 --> 00:06:20.279 
was stuck to it so what we did we took
some<00:06:18.969> warm<00:06:19.239> water<00:06:19.449> and<00:06:19.629> placed<00:06:19.929> it<00:06:20.139> on<00:06:20.229> the

00:06:20.279 --> 00:06:20.289 
some warm water and placed it on the

00:06:20.289 --> 00:06:23.159 
some warm water and placed it on the
chick<00:06:20.619> and<00:06:20.769> then<00:06:21.580> we<00:06:21.789> very<00:06:22.449> carefully<00:06:22.629> removed

00:06:23.159 --> 00:06:23.169 
chick and then we very carefully removed

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:25.259 
chick and then we very carefully removed
the<00:06:23.259> membrane<00:06:23.739> without<00:06:24.009> hurting<00:06:24.339> him<00:06:24.429> he<00:06:25.149> has

00:06:25.259 --> 00:06:25.269 
the membrane without hurting him he has

00:06:25.269 --> 00:06:27.979 
the membrane without hurting him he has
done<00:06:25.479> very<00:06:25.749> well<00:06:25.809> with<00:06:26.289> alice's<00:06:26.739> care<00:06:27.039> and
