you see pretty much everything but it

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.060 
you see pretty much everything but it
doesn't<00:02:18.750> really<00:02:18.840> agree<00:02:19.019> mean<00:02:19.350> I<00:02:19.560> fall<00:02:19.890> out<00:02:19.920> of

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
doesn't really agree mean I fall out of

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:21.680 
doesn't really agree mean I fall out of
it<00:02:20.160> when<00:02:20.340> tolerance<00:02:20.730> that<00:02:20.850> anyway<00:02:21.090> before<00:02:21.450> but

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
it when tolerance that anyway before but

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.110 
it when tolerance that anyway before but
yeah<00:02:22.200> I<00:02:22.230> find<00:02:22.769> when<00:02:22.920> I've<00:02:23.010> eaten<00:02:23.340> certain

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
things even over a couple of days it

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:26.870 
things even over a couple of days it
makes<00:02:25.709> things<00:02:25.950> a<00:02:26.010> lot<00:02:26.130> worse<00:02:26.340> so<00:02:26.550> I<00:02:26.580> tend<00:02:26.850> to

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
makes things a lot worse so I tend to

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.050 
makes things a lot worse so I tend to
stay<00:02:27.090> away<00:02:27.120> from<00:02:27.620> gluten<00:02:28.620> and<00:02:28.769> sweet<00:02:29.550> as<00:02:29.730> sugar

not it's not that common so I think to

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.199
