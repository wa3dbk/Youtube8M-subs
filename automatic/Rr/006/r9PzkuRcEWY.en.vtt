00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 ayayay they come again the 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:07.200
 parties and break our heads too 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:10.380
 again to know what to give if 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.570
 we in this video we help you with 5 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.910
 technological gifts that we could 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.279
 do both a friend and a 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.920
 family and all this time oriented 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.920
 more than anything to the living room of our house 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.920
 we start 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.220
 or you will have Nautas if so you 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:29.169
 we help with our recommendations 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.939
 technological and in this case we have to 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:33.280
 say from 70 euros that the most expensive 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:35.739
 up to three euros of which we are going to 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.410
 start to really inspire you a 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:40.570
 little if we start with the three euros 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:44.019
 As Martin said with an account 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.699
 spotify premiumm for three months to 

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:48.040
 those who do not know what is spotify 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:50.409
 a while ago we made a video os 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.600
 we leave the link so you can see it and 

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:55.839
 you know exactly what we are 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:59.470
 talking and going into matter say that 

00:00:55.839 --> 00:01:01.780
 spotify has taken out an offer for which 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:05.290
 the three thousand first months for 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:07.450
 only 099 euros for being subscribed 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.100
 it really is an arm we use 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.470
 quite so it's truly 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.720
 recommended as a gift for example to 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:16.060
 a friend is not to give him something that 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.460
 really worth it and use it and 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.500
 that he will use it a lot 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.190
 also say that it's a good idea to 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.410
 present 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:25.960
 for the invisible friend and not go to the 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:29.250
 Chinese and buy almost anything that 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.250
 let's find without buying 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.760
 but hey, it's really one of the 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.040
 first options but if you do not want 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.780
 be too rat of three euros that 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.300
 well it 's very little you can also 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.430
 make a jump there is a lack of quality and 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.680
 buy also a bluetooth adapter 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.240
 which in this case is one of the and tec the 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.910
 What do we recommend that I talk about? 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.530
 also in other videos and that really 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:52.750
 it is highly recommended we use a lot 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.610
 also so that's another of the 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.560
 possibilities combining the two things 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.020
 come on, you look great 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.390
 as for the adapter of interest 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:04.990
 tell you that there are two versions one more 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:07.420
 recent and an older truth so is 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.250
 the one that we analyzed the other time was 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.710
 the oldest but this new what you 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.120
 allows is to connect several devices 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:14.590
 directly so if for example you 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.690
 you are with the tablet me yes with the mobile 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.660
 we can connect and kaun can also 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.830
 go playing the music you want 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.050
 truly is a great goal and more than 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.700
 nothing serves to connect it for example 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.620
 with that old mini chains that 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.819
 we have there taking dust but that 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.290
 it also sounded 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:31.420
 and that really just with 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.859
 connectable this device we are going to 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.670
 to be able to get a performance 

00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:38.709
 spectacular the third gift by price 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.870
 we're also going up a bit it would be 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:43.150
 the famous chronicles that we have already 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:46.000
 spoken also in other videos of him 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:48.430
 but we always like to include it 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.870
 as a gift if that 's how it really could 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.549
 be the star gift of these 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.650
 Christmas because he really is now 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:55.569
 pretty well seated is a device 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.939
 that we can connect directly to 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:59.709
 our TV by hdmi and that with him 

00:02:57.939 --> 00:03:02.709
 we can reproduce everything we have 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:04.810
 in our mobile tablet or laptop 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:07.030
 a spectacular way does not work 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.799
 two different ways I say it fast 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.269
 from different applications that already 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:13.000
 allow I can reproduce the image 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:14.889
 until the last thing that there is at this moment 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.500
 and is that in the latest android phones 

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:19.269
 we can play directly what 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.340
 we have on our mobile screen in 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:23.569
 the TV so a golazo all know 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.719
 our YouTube channel on TV 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:29.749
 the fourth gift would be already more oriented 

00:03:26.719 --> 00:03:32.030
 to the theme videogames if really a 

00:03:29.749 --> 00:03:33.680
 great idea and if you have to complete a 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.989
 game and you do not know which ones that I 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.569
 would buy would be first in fifa 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:39.499
 which is exactly the reason why 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:42.019
 I am always buying the 

00:03:39.499 --> 00:03:44.689
 playstation if I do not come from 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:47.060
 years ago also the gta 5 that is a 

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:49.129
 great game that really is great and in 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.319
 if you have the playstation 4 

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:53.870
 also another of the important games 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:57.799
 one of the best of the year is the destination 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:04:00.560
 finally the gift that more clearly than 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:02.689
 we are going to propose is this mini 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:06.680
 television receiver costing 

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:08.599
 exactly 69 299 euros we go 70 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:11.700
 we have to talk about what this does 

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:14.940
 receiver yes what he does is 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:17.549
 and without the use of cables or anything we can 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:19.590
 see with this receiver the television in 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:21.780
 any of our devices that 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.040
 we 're going on a trip and we want to see the 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.740
 television when we are in the 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.850
 hotel room or when we are in 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.550
 the room is usually 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:30.360
 televisions but when we're in 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:33.090
 any site that we do not have 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:35.250
 television we go with this receiver and 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.830
 our mobile device or our 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:39.030
 tablet and we can see it there 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:41.639
 perfectly so it works with 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:43.590
 android and also with guys something that is 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:46.380
 really great because I do not eat 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:48.660
 you need a connection directly what 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:51.000
 does is generate a wifi network that does not 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:52.740
 to which we have to connect and that 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.440
 with that what we can do is 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:57.360
 directly using the application 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:59.600
 downloading cloth in the official store of 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:02.100
 each of these devices 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:04.560
 see TV directly in a way 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:05.790
 great the truth is very good and is a 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.860
 very good solution because many times 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:09.270
 they ask us about these things and 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.700
 it really is one of those that we can 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:13.680
 recommend so good these are a 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:14.700
 little things that we recommend and 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.590
 tell you what good 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:18.630
 the most important thing now is that you 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:20.250
 tell what gift would you do because 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:22.680
 truly these are our ideas 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:25.740
 but yours are going to be that this 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:28.170
 video is even more interesting to remember you 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:30.630
 which is that although we are asking you 

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:32.880
 tell us what you would give, you will not 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:34.170
 raisins of 70 euros good if you 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:36.000
 you want to spend a little more does not happen 

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:38.190
 nothing but it has to be very interesting 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.050
 so well we hope this video 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:41.700
 I have served you if you did not know us 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:44.910
 we ask you to subscribe to our channel 

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:46.440
 they can also follow us in our 

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:48.570
 social networks for nothing yes 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:50.760
 and also on our yunnan website 

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:52.710
 Austan dotcom so nothing else for the 

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:54.510
 moment we hope you liked it and 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:57.170
 see you gentlemen in the next video 

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:57.170
 Merry Christmas
