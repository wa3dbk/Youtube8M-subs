00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
in here but let's first visit the the

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.240 
in here but let's first visit the the
other<00:03:40.090> thing<00:03:40.410> so<00:03:41.410> I<00:03:41.470> get<00:03:41.650> the<00:03:41.769> feeling<00:03:42.160> that's

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
other thing so I get the feeling that's

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.729 
other thing so I get the feeling that's
going<00:03:42.489> to<00:03:42.610> be<00:03:42.700> the<00:03:42.760> real<00:03:43.000> important<00:03:43.720> stuff

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739

customized<00:03:47.739> seems<00:03:48.010> like<00:03:48.220> something<00:03:48.640> you<00:03:48.670> just

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
customized seems like something you just

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:52.680 
customized seems like something you just
do<00:03:49.450> on<00:03:49.690> the<00:03:49.840> fly<00:03:50.080> just<00:03:51.120> whatever<00:03:52.120> you<00:03:52.450> like

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.440 
do on the fly just whatever you like
most<00:03:52.930> so<00:03:53.319> I'm<00:03:54.069> sure<00:03:54.340> that<00:03:54.610> we'll<00:03:54.849> get<00:03:55.060> a<00:03:55.090> long

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
most so I'm sure that we'll get a long

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:01.789 
most so I'm sure that we'll get a long
list<00:03:55.720> of<00:03:55.900> later<00:03:58.110> I<00:03:59.110> get<00:03:59.950> the<00:04:00.040> feeling<00:04:00.069> you<00:04:00.459> do

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799 
list of later I get the feeling you do

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:05.070 
list of later I get the feeling you do
which<00:04:02.799> is<00:04:02.830> really<00:04:03.340> very<00:04:03.549> pleasant<00:04:04.060> but<00:04:04.360> that's
