00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.400 

here's<00:00:01.410> a<00:00:01.560> little<00:00:01.800> bit<00:00:01.979> of<00:00:02.129> old<00:00:02.429> technology

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:03.410 
here's a little bit of old technology

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:07.249 
here's a little bit of old technology
this<00:00:04.410> is<00:00:04.620> one<00:00:04.859> of<00:00:04.890> the<00:00:05.130> LEAs<00:00:05.930> triple<00:00:06.930> flow

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
this is one of the LEAs triple flow

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.959 
this is one of the LEAs triple flow
filters<00:00:07.919> and<00:00:08.400> I<00:00:09.179> just<00:00:09.690> picked<00:00:09.900> this<00:00:10.019> up<00:00:10.260> today

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:10.969 
filters and I just picked this up today

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:14.749 
filters and I just picked this up today
and<00:00:11.969> what<00:00:12.179> this<00:00:12.389> saw<00:00:12.750> is<00:00:13.469> good<00:00:14.219> for<00:00:14.429> this<00:00:14.549> one

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
and what this saw is good for this one

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.750 
and what this saw is good for this one
well<00:00:15.000> it's<00:00:15.269> a<00:00:15.420> large<00:00:15.630> chamber<00:00:15.990> and<00:00:16.440> it's<00:00:17.369> meant

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
well it's a large chamber and it's meant

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:24.310 
well it's a large chamber and it's meant
for<00:00:20.570> filters<00:00:21.570> up<00:00:21.900> to<00:00:22.109> 100<00:00:22.590> gallons<00:00:23.160> an<00:00:23.550> hour

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:24.320 
for filters up to 100 gallons an hour

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:31.550 
for filters up to 100 gallons an hour
and<00:00:25.849> what<00:00:26.849> I<00:00:26.880> have<00:00:27.150> in<00:00:27.420> this<00:00:27.630> is<00:00:28.550> a<00:00:30.349> bunch<00:00:31.349> of

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
and what I have in this is a bunch of

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.280 
and what I have in this is a bunch of
bio<00:00:32.130> mix<00:00:32.430> that<00:00:32.669> I<00:00:32.700> had<00:00:32.820> left<00:00:33.000> over<00:00:33.180> from<00:00:34.020> some

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
bio mix that I had left over from some

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.299 
bio mix that I had left over from some
of<00:00:34.440> my<00:00:35.870> the<00:00:36.870> other<00:00:37.020> grams<00:00:37.469> I<00:00:37.739> have<00:00:37.829> this<00:00:37.950> little

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
of my the other grams I have this little

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.040 
of my the other grams I have this little
satchel<00:00:38.910> and<00:00:38.940> there's<00:00:39.149> another<00:00:39.390> one<00:00:39.600> down<00:00:39.750> in

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
satchel and there's another one down in

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:47.990 
satchel and there's another one down in
here<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:41.600> I<00:00:42.680> intend<00:00:43.680> to<00:00:43.860> use<00:00:44.040> this<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:47.000> cycle

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
here and I intend to use this to cycle

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.229 
here and I intend to use this to cycle
my<00:00:48.480> bio<00:00:49.079> herb<00:00:49.289> aquarium<00:00:52.550> and<00:00:53.550> here<00:00:53.850> is<00:00:53.969> the

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
my bio herb aquarium and here is the

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.979 
my bio herb aquarium and here is the
filter<00:00:54.899> floss<00:00:55.260> that<00:00:56.160> I'm<00:00:56.309> going<00:00:56.520> to<00:00:56.579> add<00:00:56.989> to

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
filter floss that I'm going to add to

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.619 
filter floss that I'm going to add to
the<00:00:58.230> filter<00:01:00.829> and<00:01:01.829> when<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:02.940> filter<00:01:03.329> is<00:01:03.390> all

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
the filter and when the filter is all

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:10.340 
the filter and when the filter is all
done<00:01:04.309> you<00:01:05.309> can<00:01:05.549> see<00:01:05.880> it<00:01:06.210> has<00:01:07.080> a<00:01:09.049> tube<00:01:10.049> at<00:01:10.200> the

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
done you can see it has a tube at the

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.830 
done you can see it has a tube at the
top<00:01:10.590> with<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:13.100> filter<00:01:14.100> media<00:01:14.460> inside<00:01:15.299> and

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
top with the filter media inside and

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.899 
top with the filter media inside and
there<00:01:16.080> are<00:01:16.259> it's<00:01:16.799> a<00:01:16.950> triple<00:01:17.340> flow<00:01:17.520> so<00:01:17.759> there

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
there are it's a triple flow so there

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.289 
there are it's a triple flow so there
are<00:01:18.000> three<00:01:18.180> areas<00:01:18.360> where<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:19.430> water<00:01:20.430> goes<00:01:20.970> in

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
are three areas where the water goes in

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.800 
are three areas where the water goes in
and<00:01:21.570> then<00:01:22.470> it's<00:01:22.880> flow<00:01:23.880> it<00:01:24.119> goes<00:01:24.360> up<00:01:24.540> to<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.780> top

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
and then it's flow it goes up to the top

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.999 
and then it's flow it goes up to the top
to<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.409> floss<00:01:25.710> to<00:01:26.130> screen<00:01:26.400> out<00:01:26.689> the<00:01:28.009> debris

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
to the floss to screen out the debris

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.700 
to the floss to screen out the debris
that's<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.670> mechanical<00:01:30.570> filtration<00:01:30.900> and

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
that's the mechanical filtration and

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.109 
that's the mechanical filtration and
below<00:01:32.340> what<00:01:32.579> I<00:01:32.610> added<00:01:32.970> was<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:34.100> extra<00:01:35.100> bio<00:01:35.759> max

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
below what I added was the extra bio max

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.870 
below what I added was the extra bio max
that<00:01:36.329> I<00:01:36.420> had<00:01:36.750> I'm<00:01:36.900> not<00:01:37.079> using<00:01:37.320> any<00:01:37.560> chemical<00:01:38.159> in

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
that I had I'm not using any chemical in

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.319 
that I had I'm not using any chemical in
this<00:01:39.799> and<00:01:40.799> here's<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.310> LEAs<00:01:41.549> triple<00:01:42.090> hole

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
this and here's the LEAs triple hole

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.490 
this and here's the LEAs triple hole
filter<00:01:43.079> inside<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.799> buy<00:01:44.009> orb<00:01:44.340> and<00:01:45.500> what's

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
filter inside the buy orb and what's

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.109 
filter inside the buy orb and what's
happening<00:01:47.009> here<00:01:47.070> is<00:01:47.520> I'm<00:01:48.299> just<00:01:48.689> all<00:01:50.119> hoping

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
happening here is I'm just all hoping

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.590 
happening here is I'm just all hoping
the<00:01:51.920> water<00:01:52.920> inside<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.640> bioware<00:01:54.149> this<00:01:54.360> is<00:01:54.479> an

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
the water inside the bioware this is an

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.880 
the water inside the bioware this is an
8<00:01:54.689> gallon<00:01:54.930> acrylic<00:01:55.590> to<00:01:56.390> cycle<00:01:57.390> with<00:01:57.600> all<00:01:58.469> this

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
8 gallon acrylic to cycle with all this

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.490 
8 gallon acrylic to cycle with all this
biome<00:01:59.610> exits<00:02:00.060> been<00:02:00.270> running<00:02:00.570> in<00:02:00.659> my<00:02:00.780> 29<00:02:01.290> gallon

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
biome exits been running in my 29 gallon

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.550 
biome exits been running in my 29 gallon
for<00:02:01.890> about<00:02:02.240> two<00:02:03.240> years

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
for about two years

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.520 
for about two years
so<00:02:05.130> this<00:02:05.369> should<00:02:05.520> help<00:02:05.790> that<00:02:05.970> along<00:02:06.560> and<00:02:08.330> I

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
so this should help that along and I

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.920 
so this should help that along and I
last<00:02:10.530> had<00:02:11.130> some<00:02:11.459> stress<00:02:11.790> sign<00:02:12.060> to<00:02:12.360> adult<00:02:12.690> so<00:02:12.870> to

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
last had some stress sign to adult so to

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.360 
last had some stress sign to adult so to
help<00:02:13.170> it<00:02:13.319> along<00:02:13.760> another<00:02:14.760> couple<00:02:15.240> days<00:02:16.370> I'll

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
help it along another couple days I'll

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.520 
help it along another couple days I'll
they<00:02:17.550> had<00:02:17.670> a<00:02:17.700> Fisher<00:02:18.209> to<00:02:18.420> probably<00:02:18.959> one<00:02:19.170> fish

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
they had a Fisher to probably one fish

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.330 
they had a Fisher to probably one fish
to<00:02:19.770> help<00:02:19.890> the<00:02:20.100> cycling<00:02:20.520> process<00:02:21.000> start
