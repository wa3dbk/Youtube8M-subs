00:00:01.079 --> 00:00:06.860 

now<00:00:01.920> we<00:00:01.980> can<00:00:02.460> come<00:00:02.670> in<00:00:02.909> and<00:00:03.649> start<00:00:05.870> clarifying

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
now we can come in and start clarifying

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.430 
now we can come in and start clarifying
and<00:00:07.760> separating<00:00:08.760> the<00:00:08.880> features<00:00:09.240> and<00:00:09.540> creating

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
and separating the features and creating

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.220 
and separating the features and creating
more<00:00:10.680> depth<00:00:11.010> because<00:00:11.970> we<00:00:12.180> can<00:00:12.390> come<00:00:12.630> in<00:00:12.930> and

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
more depth because we can come in and

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.279 
more depth because we can come in and
where<00:00:14.190> would<00:00:14.490> it<00:00:14.610> be<00:00:14.640> darker<00:00:15.210> well<00:00:15.450> every<00:00:16.109> time

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
where would it be darker well every time

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.009 
where would it be darker well every time
I<00:00:16.320> go<00:00:16.529> to<00:00:16.560> something<00:00:17.099> darker<00:00:17.579> another<00:00:18.119> darker

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:19.019 
I go to something darker another darker

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:23.689 
I go to something darker another darker
value<00:00:20.419> it<00:00:21.419> is<00:00:21.720> going<00:00:22.050> to<00:00:22.349> be<00:00:22.769> in<00:00:23.009> a<00:00:23.130> probably<00:00:23.640> a

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
value it is going to be in a probably a

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.919 
value it is going to be in a probably a
smaller<00:00:24.089> area<00:00:24.800> and<00:00:26.149> so<00:00:27.149> I<00:00:27.179> could<00:00:27.449> work<00:00:27.569> on<00:00:27.749> some

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:27.929 
smaller area and so I could work on some

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:30.469 
smaller area and so I could work on some
of<00:00:28.050> these<00:00:28.109> little<00:00:28.289> shapes<00:00:28.679> I<00:00:29.099> can<00:00:29.999> work<00:00:30.239> on

00:00:30.469 --> 00:00:30.479 
of these little shapes I can work on

00:00:30.479 --> 00:00:32.870 
of these little shapes I can work on
showing<00:00:31.409> the<00:00:31.560> contour<00:00:32.009> between<00:00:32.489> here<00:00:32.850> and

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
showing the contour between here and

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:42.729 
showing the contour between here and
here<00:00:37.879> let's<00:00:38.879> go<00:00:39.030> ahead<00:00:39.090> and<00:00:39.269> turn<00:00:39.449> this<00:00:39.600> around

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:47.540 

take<00:00:43.739> advantage<00:00:44.129> of<00:00:44.250> my<00:00:44.370> best<00:00:44.640> stroke<00:00:46.550> and

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
take advantage of my best stroke and

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.119 
take advantage of my best stroke and
let's<00:00:47.789> go<00:00:47.940> ahead<00:00:48.120> and<00:00:48.359> deepen<00:00:48.750> up<00:00:49.039> some<00:00:50.039> of

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
let's go ahead and deepen up some of

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.470 
let's go ahead and deepen up some of
these<00:00:50.219> values<00:00:50.699> it's<00:00:50.910> gonna<00:00:51.030> be<00:00:51.179> a<00:00:51.210> lot<00:00:51.420> easier

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
these values it's gonna be a lot easier

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:58.220 
these values it's gonna be a lot easier
with<00:00:52.019> my<00:00:52.429> HB<00:00:55.699> still<00:00:56.699> for<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:56.969> most<00:00:56.999> part<00:00:57.449> we're

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
with my HB still for the most part we're

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.560 
with my HB still for the most part we're
having<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.739> same<00:01:00.260> amount<00:01:01.260> of<00:01:01.620> pressure<00:01:02.570> this

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
having the same amount of pressure this

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.310 
having the same amount of pressure this
is<00:01:03.629> how<00:01:03.929> I<00:01:03.960> can<00:01:04.110> really<00:01:04.550> know<00:01:05.550> that<00:01:05.580> I'm

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
is how I can really know that I'm

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.200 
is how I can really know that I'm
utilizing<00:01:07.320> my<00:01:07.470> pencil<00:01:07.860> properly<00:01:08.340> I<00:01:08.520> can

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
utilizing my pencil properly I can

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.440 
utilizing my pencil properly I can
utilize<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:10.140> gradations<00:01:10.830> on<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:12.180> grade

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
utilize the gradations on the the grade

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.410 
utilize the gradations on the the grade
of<00:01:12.480> pencil<00:01:12.990> know<00:01:13.950> what<00:01:14.190> to<00:01:14.340> expect<00:01:14.790> because

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
of pencil know what to expect because

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:23.480 
of pencil know what to expect because
I've<00:01:15.900> standardized<00:01:16.680> my<00:01:16.980> pressure<00:01:21.740> this<00:01:22.740> when

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
I've standardized my pressure this when

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.000 
I've standardized my pressure this when
I<00:01:23.520> increase<00:01:23.820> these<00:01:24.150> values<00:01:24.690> these<00:01:25.410> darkest

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.010 
I increase these values these darkest

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:28.730 
I increase these values these darkest
places<00:01:26.330> it's<00:01:27.330> going<00:01:27.540> to<00:01:27.630> help<00:01:27.750> me<00:01:27.960> go<00:01:28.200> back<00:01:28.440> in

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
places it's going to help me go back in

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:39.289 
places it's going to help me go back in
and<00:01:28.950> now<00:01:29.910> put<00:01:30.300> the<00:01:30.450> 2h<00:01:30.840> where<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:32.150> 4-h<00:01:33.150> was

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.590 

and<00:01:40.259> it<00:01:40.649> is<00:01:40.799> allowing<00:01:41.130> me<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:41.490> put<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.240> 2h

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
and it is allowing me to put the 2h

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.410 
and it is allowing me to put the 2h
where<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.140> 4-h<00:01:43.530> is<00:01:43.969> and<00:01:46.460> now<00:01:47.460> going<00:01:48.060> into<00:01:48.210> a

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
where the 4-h is and now going into a

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.980 
where the 4-h is and now going into a
brand<00:01:49.350> new<00:01:49.530> area<00:01:49.740> and<00:01:50.060> putting<00:01:51.060> my<00:01:51.210> 4-h<00:01:51.689> in

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
brand new area and putting my 4-h in

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.529 
brand new area and putting my 4-h in
there<00:01:52.619> because<00:01:52.890> I'm<00:01:53.130> extending<00:01:53.880> it<00:01:53.969> out<00:01:54.149> and

00:01:54.529 --> 00:01:54.539 
there because I'm extending it out and

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:57.950 
there because I'm extending it out and
traveling<00:01:55.259> closer<00:01:55.740> to<00:01:56.369> my<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:57.299> apex<00:01:57.750> of<00:01:57.840> a

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
traveling closer to my the apex of a

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.590 
traveling closer to my the apex of a
curve<00:01:58.229> which<00:01:58.500> I<00:01:58.619> don't<00:01:58.679> want<00:01:58.829> to<00:01:58.950> do<00:01:59.100> it<00:01:59.549> all<00:02:00.450> at

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
curve which I don't want to do it all at

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:09.800 
curve which I don't want to do it all at
once

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.740 

so<00:02:10.440> I<00:02:10.470> just<00:02:10.920> try<00:02:11.760> and<00:02:11.850> get<00:02:12.000> it<00:02:12.120> enough<00:02:12.420> value

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
so I just try and get it enough value

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.570 
so I just try and get it enough value
and<00:02:13.110> you're<00:02:13.260> I'm<00:02:13.410> starting<00:02:14.040> to<00:02:14.130> kind<00:02:14.340> of<00:02:14.400> get<00:02:14.520> a

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
and you're I'm starting to kind of get a

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.309 
and you're I'm starting to kind of get a
feel<00:02:14.819> for<00:02:14.850> the<00:02:15.180> eyelashes<00:02:15.900> they're<00:02:16.080> kind<00:02:16.260> of

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
feel for the eyelashes they're kind of

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:22.370 
feel for the eyelashes they're kind of
hanging<00:02:16.709> over<00:02:16.830> the<00:02:17.069> eye<00:02:20.540> I'm<00:02:21.540> trying<00:02:22.080> to<00:02:22.200> pay

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
hanging over the eye I'm trying to pay

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.920 
hanging over the eye I'm trying to pay
attention<00:02:22.410> to<00:02:23.130> the<00:02:23.430> direction<00:02:23.790> of<00:02:24.060> my<00:02:24.270> my

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
attention to the direction of my my

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.620 
attention to the direction of my my
curve<00:02:25.260> so<00:02:25.740> that<00:02:25.860> I<00:02:25.950> can<00:02:26.160> duplicate<00:02:26.670> you<00:02:27.510> know

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
curve so that I can duplicate you know

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:36.020 
curve so that I can duplicate you know
the<00:02:27.930> arc<00:02:28.319> I<00:02:34.220> want<00:02:35.220> to<00:02:35.310> take<00:02:35.850> into

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
the arc I want to take into

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.110 
the arc I want to take into
consideration<00:02:36.120> where<00:02:36.989> it<00:02:37.110> would<00:02:37.290> be<00:02:37.319> darker

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
consideration where it would be darker

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.030 
consideration where it would be darker
would<00:02:39.120> be<00:02:39.300> darker<00:02:39.750> probably<00:02:40.170> at<00:02:40.290> the<00:02:40.440> top<00:02:40.680> so

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
would be darker probably at the top so

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.530 
would be darker probably at the top so
even<00:02:41.310> if<00:02:41.400> I<00:02:41.489> had<00:02:41.640> to<00:02:41.760> back<00:02:41.940> that<00:02:42.150> off<00:02:42.209> a<00:02:42.360> little

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
even if I had to back that off a little

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.890 
even if I had to back that off a little
bit<00:02:42.810> I<00:02:42.870> would<00:02:43.050> want<00:02:43.860> to<00:02:44.010> do<00:02:44.130> that<00:02:44.810> here's<00:02:45.810> a

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
bit I would want to do that here's a

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.550 
bit I would want to do that here's a
lighter<00:02:47.570> value<00:02:48.570> it<00:02:48.750> looks<00:02:48.959> like<00:02:49.140> it's<00:02:49.350> still

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
lighter value it looks like it's still

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.190 
lighter value it looks like it's still
quite<00:02:49.860> dark<00:02:50.220> at<00:02:50.820> the<00:02:51.000> bottom<00:02:51.360> here<00:02:51.660> but<00:02:51.900> still

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
quite dark at the bottom here but still

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.240 
quite dark at the bottom here but still
overall<00:02:52.860> the<00:02:53.310> principal<00:02:53.880> is<00:02:54.090> the<00:02:55.160> pupil<00:02:56.160> would

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
overall the principal is the pupil would

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.160 
overall the principal is the pupil would
be<00:02:56.430> the<00:02:56.580> darkest<00:02:57.060> or<00:02:57.269> at<00:02:57.420> least<00:02:57.600> as<00:02:57.780> dark<00:02:58.050> as

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
be the darkest or at least as dark as

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.280 
be the darkest or at least as dark as
anything<00:02:58.530> else<00:02:58.680> and<00:02:59.450> then<00:03:00.450> I<00:03:00.510> want<00:03:00.840> to<00:03:00.930> shade

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
anything else and then I want to shade

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:09.620 
anything else and then I want to shade
things<00:03:01.650> down<00:03:01.920> from<00:03:02.220> that<00:03:07.850> so<00:03:08.850> let's<00:03:09.180> come<00:03:09.480> in

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
things down from that so let's come in

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:29.699 
things down from that so let's come in
here

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:32.830 

clarifying<00:03:30.709> things<00:03:31.069> even<00:03:31.670> even<00:03:32.299> in<00:03:32.420> this<00:03:32.569> case

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
clarifying things even even in this case

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.069 
clarifying things even even in this case
I<00:03:33.170> don't<00:03:34.129> want<00:03:34.310> this<00:03:34.489> to<00:03:34.700> be<00:03:34.849> too<00:03:35.239> right<00:03:35.540> even

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:36.079 
I don't want this to be too right even

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:38.199 
I don't want this to be too right even
though<00:03:36.290> it's<00:03:36.709> the<00:03:37.040> white<00:03:37.219> of<00:03:37.400> the<00:03:37.430> eye<00:03:37.489> I<00:03:37.639> don't

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209 
though it's the white of the eye I don't

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:40.390 
though it's the white of the eye I don't
want<00:03:38.359> to<00:03:38.450> think<00:03:38.689> white<00:03:39.049> because<00:03:40.010> you'll<00:03:40.189> see

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
want to think white because you'll see

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.309 
want to think white because you'll see
that<00:03:40.549> the<00:03:40.700> highlights<00:03:41.180> the<00:03:41.480> skin<00:03:41.900> value<00:03:42.230> is

00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:42.319 
that the highlights the skin value is

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:44.739 
that the highlights the skin value is
even<00:03:42.439> lighter<00:03:42.739> than<00:03:42.889> that<00:03:43.189> but<00:03:43.879> the<00:03:44.030> contrast

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:44.749 
even lighter than that but the contrast

00:03:44.749 --> 00:03:47.559 
even lighter than that but the contrast
the<00:03:45.109> dark<00:03:45.439> here<00:03:46.099> in<00:03:46.280> the<00:03:46.400> dark<00:03:46.700> here<00:03:47.120> with<00:03:47.389> my

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:47.569 
the dark here in the dark here with my

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:50.770 
the dark here in the dark here with my
HB<00:03:48.109> has<00:03:48.859> allowed<00:03:49.219> me<00:03:49.489> to<00:03:49.519> come<00:03:49.849> back<00:03:50.090> in<00:03:50.389> and

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
HB has allowed me to come back in and

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.899 
HB has allowed me to come back in and
now<00:03:51.109> tone<00:03:51.439> that<00:03:51.650> down<00:03:51.680> just<00:03:51.859> a<00:03:52.189> little<00:03:52.219> bit<00:03:52.519> it

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:52.909 
now tone that down just a little bit it

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:54.849 
now tone that down just a little bit it
still<00:03:53.359> is<00:03:53.569> going<00:03:53.780> to<00:03:53.930> look<00:03:54.079> like<00:03:54.109> a<00:03:54.260> white<00:03:54.560> but

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:54.859 
still is going to look like a white but

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:57.490 
still is going to look like a white but
it<00:03:54.980> pushes<00:03:55.250> it<00:03:55.549> back<00:03:55.579> to<00:03:56.419> where<00:03:56.629> you<00:03:57.290> know<00:03:57.379> it

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
it pushes it back to where you know it

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.949 
it pushes it back to where you know it
isn't<00:03:57.650> necessarily<00:03:58.280> just<00:03:58.639> a<00:03:58.730> sparkle<00:03:59.269> at<00:03:59.629> that

00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959 
isn't necessarily just a sparkle at that

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:02.770 
isn't necessarily just a sparkle at that
point<00:04:00.290> and<00:04:00.889> then<00:04:01.069> when<00:04:01.280> we<00:04:01.400> do<00:04:02.060> add<00:04:02.239> a<00:04:02.269> sparkle

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
point and then when we do add a sparkle

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:04.750 
point and then when we do add a sparkle
if<00:04:02.870> we're<00:04:03.019> going<00:04:03.139> to<00:04:03.200> do<00:04:03.349> that<00:04:03.530> with<00:04:03.680> this<00:04:03.829> we

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760 
if we're going to do that with this we

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.550 
if we're going to do that with this we
can<00:04:04.939> go<00:04:05.090> ahead<00:04:05.239> and<00:04:05.480> draw<00:04:05.659> a<00:04:05.689> tension<00:04:06.260> because

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
can go ahead and draw a tension because

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.649 
can go ahead and draw a tension because
we'll<00:04:06.739> have<00:04:06.769> that<00:04:07.099> great<00:04:07.340> contrast<00:04:07.909> but<00:04:08.599> I

00:04:08.649 --> 00:04:08.659 
we'll have that great contrast but I

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:10.720 
we'll have that great contrast but I
don't<00:04:08.989> want<00:04:09.169> the<00:04:09.290> white<00:04:09.500> of<00:04:09.680> the<00:04:09.709> eye<00:04:09.799> to<00:04:10.699> be

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
don't want the white of the eye to be

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:20.729 
don't want the white of the eye to be
too<00:04:11.090> bright

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:22.799
