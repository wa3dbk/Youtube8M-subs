00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.440
 we are in a new world micro 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:07.010
 animal 

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:09.020
 I wanted to present to you today a kind 

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:10.820
 quite weird what we have shown 

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:13.369
 in other microphones but for those who do not 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:16.580
 have seen taking advantage of that we have 

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:19.670
 pups wanted to show what are the 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:22.450
 African hedgehogs a pet not 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.450
 traditional 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:29.349
 they are very docile to go through the 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:31.810
 that the one who does not have time to have 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:35.050
 have a dog to have a cat that already 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:37.660
 it would take him more time and this 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:41.379
 it is done they become very docile and carry 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:45.280
 they take less care what they need 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:47.910
 it's a fish tank a place where where 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.880
 you can have them 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:55.170
 with sawdust with sawdust thought with 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:58.110
 sanitary stones some of those 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.840
 substrates like as beds are put on 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:03.600
 usually small boxes to form houses 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.869
 they like to be more in the 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:11.190
 dark more locked up have more habits 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:15.270
 nocturnal in regards to the 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:19.110
 feeding generally the diet of 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:21.570
 they are based on cat food a 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.659
 food that recommends them is that 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.780
 a good quality food 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:30.509
 and only with that if the food is 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.750
 well with that they do not need anything else 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:37.770
 what cat foods and what do you give them? 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:40.409
 dry as we see in this are the 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.899
 provides dry in a feeder and is the 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:46.080
 cat food and water that's the only thing 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:49.230
 the water usually in drinking fountains 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.180
 like these so that they do not wet the bed that 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:53.950
 always have the camera but let's be 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.729
 cameras surrenders to mosaics 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:59.610
 and they become very docile what 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:02.920
 they need is to learn to know us 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:05.049
 they are handled a lot by smell then 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.600
 first we have to zoom in 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:10.569
 our hand and that they smell a 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.910
 Once they know us they saw that they have the 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:15.010
 snout long and that the only thing that 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.739
 does that kick it do not have the view 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.560
 very developed plus the smell then 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:22.750
 once they know us these grapes 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:27.940
 that they raise when they are scared that 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:31.120
 they are their defense they lower them and they make 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:33.459
 I was like I was with a rough hair 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:37.390
 in the case of wanting to defend yourself lift 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:40.900
 the leaks if they puncture the same is not that we 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.610
 will hurt if they cause us 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:46.810
 the little dora in the hands but but 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:50.530
 it's not that it's going to hurt with the barbs 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:53.560
 It is a little animal that does not need other 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:56.290
 care if you could get them to bathe 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:59.170
 with peron dry baths with powders that 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.520
 come for the bathroom such a thing if that 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.980
 they come for the bath of these animals 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:06.130
 but it is advisable not to do anything to them 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:08.590
 more than food and water that does not 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:13.150
 they need to take care of the temperatures 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:15.090
 They suffer a lot with extreme cold 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.110
 hide and enter as in a stillness 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.940
 then in that there is that you have to 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.819
 take care of them is a little animal for 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.380
 have it to have it inside 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:26.380
 keeping it with sawdust or with 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:28.690
 sanitary stones do not do not do 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:31.860
 smell every so often is changing them and not 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:34.620
 It is an odorous animal 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:36.600
 and good without different females like 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.670
 Some males say that the females are 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:41.640
 a little more spots but I've seen that 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:43.560
 they are tamed they are tamed very much and one 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:47.520
 just after they put their hands on them 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:50.530
 they go up to one's hands and not really 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:53.080
 They are very tame 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.819
 what is done can be had if one 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:58.510
 you have the couple you can have them 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:04:01.030
 together and if we wanted to take out 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:04.030
 pups are kept for 15 days 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:06.760
 together the male and the female are 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:09.520
 keeps together and then we part 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:12.880
 and it is expected 35 days that is the gestation 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:15.010
 if in that lapse you do not have to turn to 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:17.709
 join males and females and it turns to 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:20.859
 wait another 35 days to see if in this 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:25.080
 Once everything was pregnant they can have 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:29.050
 the average is that they have between 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:33.910
 they turn on but it does not hurt to 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:38.560
 nothing the common is that they have between 3 2 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:41.260
 three pups these were 44 little brothers the 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:43.650
 kid mother raised them all cryo 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:47.850
 very well 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:51.449
 this would be practically the size at 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:53.610
 34 months the adult size that is the age 

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:55.020
 that has the adult size we are going to 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:58.320
 see in the images 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:02.400
 we have a a female the female that 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:05.250
 let's see in images is already has three 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:09.090
 years their lives more or less live 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:11.100
 eight years also depends all the 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:14.100
 conditions in which one has it 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:18.930
 food that one gives but more or 

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:23.130
 less live that time this female had 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:26.610
 this time one and the rarity of the one 

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:29.160
 has is that it is white that is rare to 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:31.500
 look at how you do how you make a 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:34.740
 little ball that is the defense of them when 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:37.500
 It is scared is a ball 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:39.539
 then he hides his whole body the part 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:42.000
 weak of his body that is where not 

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:43.590
 They have leaks and hide 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.410
 the barbs 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:50.610
 as I was saying they have 

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:54.540
 a rarity that white that is very weird 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:57.240
 see inside those of the hedgehogs from 

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:59.640
 the African hedgehogs there is this color that 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:02.100
 is the salt and pepper that is called that is 

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:05.340
 like a grayish brown and the tips 

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:09.000
 of the vat and then they have there 

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:11.310
 the white and there's cinnamon 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.620
 the cinnamon truth is very nice but 

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:16.350
 the weirdest are the white ones 

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:20.280
 let's see this had a single breeding and 

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:23.100
 white as we see in the image is the 

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:25.440
 mother you have to try to keep it 

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:27.450
 because in the mother this one is quite 

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:30.480
 fat and you're going to see it you have to try to 

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:32.790
 keep the diet pretty much at bay, 

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:36.540
 feed him as much as they want and 

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:38.460
 try to maintain it according to the quality of 

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:41.340
 the food the amounts that we are going to 

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:43.890
 give is the mother we give you well we told you 

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:46.320
 well to eat so that it reaches the 

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:49.950
 gestation and an adaptation and that breeds 

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:52.620
 well to your brood this brood has week and 

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:54.600
 average and they're going to see the size 

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:57.840
 it's a lot bigger but because it's 

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:59.790
 you just have to deal with when they have 

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:02.190
 keep them quiet do not disturb them 

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:04.169
 we cover the fish tanks with some 

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:05.790
 with some towels we cover all the 

00:07:04.169 --> 00:07:08.040
 sides of the fish tanks so you do not 

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:10.140
 bother them because as in the case of 

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:12.540
 hamsters can eat their 

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:14.220
 own offspring then try the ones 

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:15.270
 first days until she leaves them 

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:17.570
 leave the house 

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:21.150
 that is quiet try 

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:24.390
 keep them quiet without being 

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:27.420
 very annoyed good I hope that they have 

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:29.130
 concerned and any questions or if you 

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:33.650
 they want to know we have them here 

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:33.650
 the veterinary so we wait for you
