duplicate<00:02:04.560> an<00:02:04.650> item<00:02:04.980> that<00:02:05.190> has<00:02:05.400> we're<00:02:06.030> on<00:02:06.240> it

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
duplicate an item that has we're on it

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.960 
duplicate an item that has we're on it
it's<00:02:07.290> going<00:02:07.470> to<00:02:07.530> duplicate<00:02:07.860> it<00:02:08.070> exactly<00:02:08.520> so<00:02:08.820> if

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
it's going to duplicate it exactly so if

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.400 
it's going to duplicate it exactly so if
you<00:02:09.090> only<00:02:09.240> have<00:02:09.479> like<00:02:09.690> two<00:02:09.869> more<00:02:10.020> hits<00:02:10.200> on<00:02:10.350> a

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
you only have like two more hits on a

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.560 
you only have like two more hits on a
