00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 and today another cooking lesson 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.810
 simple simple promised today we will see 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.719
 together how to prepare with ours 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.969
 hands a ganache or a cream that 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.460
 well suited to covering cake and even 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.590
 to stuff irresistible sweets 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.930
 usually the ganache cream is prepared 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.720
 mixing in equal parts cream and 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.820
 chocolate however very often yes 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.769
 using the butter I clearly do not 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.380
 I will use butter and a scanner or 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.970
 all the tops to modulate the consistency 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.790
 of the ganache at your leisure 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.340
 let's see the recipe I thought of 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.680
 propose the ideal jaw recipe 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:42.329
 to stuff cakes then with one 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:47.940
 firm consistency we have 200 g of 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:51.180
 dark chocolate and 180 grams of 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:55.320
 fresh cream we put a saucepan on the 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:58.140
 fire and pour the cream and heat it 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.969
 fire very much where there is without though 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.629
 boil it later 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:06.450
 add the chocolate now that the 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.400
 cream is almost wanting we can pour 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.909
 all the chocolate we have with us 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.280
 reduced to cubes clearly we mix 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.390
 and we dissolve it for good it seems fire 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.390
 very very sweet 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.350
 to facilitate the operation I am 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.229
 this is also an electric whisk unit 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.509
 ours is now optional 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.700
 chocolate melted me perfectly 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.640
 I prepared a bowl with water 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.740
 cold and ice because this is why 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.670
 let's remove our little pot 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.280
 from fire 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.320
 let's go and place it directly in the 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.770
 water and ice solution e 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.900
 we begin to work everything with the 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.360
 whips until the cream 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.610
 the inter is in a hurry and you will see that gradually 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:55.470
 that the compound congealed itself 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:57.930
 the building was here we girls 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.840
 worked the mixture for about 10 minutes 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.090
 the cream has cooled and this is the 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.140
 result you see rather soda e 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.660
 compact 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.550
 a little trick to speed up i 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:12.060
 times you can also put a bowl 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:14.850
 of aluminum in the freezer for about 10 15 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.130
 minutes and then pour the cream again 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.080
 hot on this what the iced and 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.540
 you will see that in this way the cream 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.820
 ganache will form much sooner if you want 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.370
 you can also prepare it for the time 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:30.000
 allow an hour to cool before 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:32.160
 work it with electric whips also 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.070
 without butter we got a cream 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.540
 ganache worthy of merit 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:38.700
 remember though that you leave it at 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.410
 room temperature will take to 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.930
 soften while keeping them 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:45.300
 the soda will remain well in the refrigerator 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.980
 compact wounds we go goalkeeper in 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.520
 matera follow me in my next 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.520
 need
