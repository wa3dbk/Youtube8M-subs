00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:43.040 
crappy thing to do so what I'm gonna do
is<00:05:41.370> just<00:05:41.550> lightly<00:05:41.909> lay<00:05:42.330> them<00:05:42.539> across<00:05:42.659> the

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.050 
is just lightly lay them across the

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:44.600 
is just lightly lay them across the
strings<00:05:43.349> or<00:05:43.620> lightly<00:05:43.800> lay<00:05:44.069> that<00:05:44.280> finger

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:44.610 
strings or lightly lay that finger

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:48.589 
strings or lightly lay that finger
across<00:05:44.759> the<00:05:44.879> string<00:05:46.520> and<00:05:47.520> it<00:05:47.669> just<00:05:47.940> deadsies

00:05:48.589 --> 00:05:48.599 
across the string and it just deadsies

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:50.689 
across the string and it just deadsies
out<00:05:48.870> so<00:05:49.560> anyway<00:05:49.800> what<00:05:49.979> you<00:05:50.009> got<00:05:50.190> to<00:05:50.280> do<00:05:50.340> is<00:05:50.460> rake

00:05:50.689 --> 00:05:50.699 
out so anyway what you got to do is rake

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:53.480 
out so anyway what you got to do is rake
into<00:05:51.210> the<00:05:51.300> 14th<00:05:51.690> fret<00:05:51.810> high<00:05:52.020> note<00:05:52.289> hammer<00:05:53.280> on

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:53.490 
into the 14th fret high note hammer on

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:56.119 
into the 14th fret high note hammer on
15th<00:05:53.969> high<00:05:54.090> e<00:05:54.120> and<00:05:54.569> then<00:05:55.500> go<00:05:55.620> back<00:05:55.830> and<00:05:56.009> play
