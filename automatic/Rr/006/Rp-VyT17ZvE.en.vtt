 plate and careful paving holes tomorrow 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.769
 in clay 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.410
 so the track is good out there 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.410

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.040

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.870

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:31.040
 the Bahia infrastructure secretary 

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:34.320
 He said the company would already be here is 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:36.270
 making the part of the track more 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.220
 Until now I've never come, we'll always see if 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.220
 We'll meet you here until you get in 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:43.330
 amount 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:46.730
 the first hole to the size of the hole 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:48.790
 walking slowly is putting clay and 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:48.790
 holes 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.510
 the holes here at the beginning as well 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:58.140
 to punctual and all of them are 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.390
 covered is not with an asphalt it is not like 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.790
 mud even a hit someone should have 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.070
 coming here some resident who goes through 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.909
 right here when they seem addicted to 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.979
 company does not 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:10.630
 looks at the beginning here in the 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:13.479
 beatriz 49 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.100
 the track is in good condition but the 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:16.030
 information that the situation is not 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.790
 easy 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:21.280
 I believe there getting there by 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.800
 halfway to pilot 90 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.230
 near the people at that gas station 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:30.240
 bear the situation much more complicated 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:30.240
 record will step here 120 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.610
 the holes also 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.240
 the club runs at home in the same season 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.240
 on time 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:01.630
 but a hole in the front 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.110
 the crater actually 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:24.830
 Look, we've already been there for at least 15 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:27.069
 side minutes 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:30.549
 the incarnate 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:32.409
 from my part 49 and began to look like a 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:35.340
 hole now but they are all 

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:38.459
 capped most of them with bauer 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.459
 final maturity 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:44.900
 there is no more time 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.900
 It's Sunday 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:54.330
 the hole looks only looks at water 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.590
 this work 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:08.210
 in the land 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:10.630
 today, June 4, the fair of 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:13.410
 Corpus Christi 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.410
 that's it 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.500
 loving 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.830
 I hope not but how was it known? 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:35.640
 Ufa 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.640
 the blows in the heart 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.180
 to believe 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:48.890
 Do not promise me, you'll get there in front. 

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:48.890
 will pass 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:56.130
 apparently I just got a weak 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:04:00.110
 and football tire we will be neither 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:00.110
 I can even help keep the monkey 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:19.700
 so the bad result 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.990
 the result there
