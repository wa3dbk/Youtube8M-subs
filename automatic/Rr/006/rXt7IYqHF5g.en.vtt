00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:12.900
 hello everybody it's sure that 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.330
 sport a new video so that's fine 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.350
 to be a bit special because here we are 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.510
 found on my desk 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.689
 so I'm going to make a video for you 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.760
 show what I'm going to film my future 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.380
 gameplay and make you a little 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.170
 presentation of a software that I have 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.289
 found that they are better than fraps 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.649
 and who does not make the war less so what 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.840
 software it's called msi afterburner 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:38.670
 so we'll launch it right away 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.100
 so I would of course put the link in 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.739
 the description 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.300
 so it looks like that already it's 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.539
 very useful because we know with what 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:51.090
 temperature heats up its graphics card 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.379
 so it's not very useful but we can 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.629
 notice that when I play for example 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.680
 at call of duty up to 60 9 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:01.350
 degrees it's huge 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.129
 so there's a lot of stuff there memory 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.790
 we use 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:09.990
 it's really good so I have a 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:12.450
 geforce gt 430 so we'll take to 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:17.630
 configure the software so packaged 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:19.310
 crisis setting one presses on so the 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.460
 Graphic card 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:25.590
 so do not go both times 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.630
 video capture so there you put the 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.619
 touch that you want to take 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.430
 video so here is the video format 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:34.430
 personally I advise you not had 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.560
 to compress because it makes you 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:39.509
 the end of May has a huge weight of the video 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.680
 so if you want to make a hedge say 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:45.899
 it's not too long here in 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.340
 quality I recommend you 85 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.759
 it's still really reasonable 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:54.119
 quality so I 'm going to show a little 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:57.000
 so the quality is really going 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:59.850
 that we are at stake and we do not have a 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.880
 beautiful graphics and we did not 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:06.619
 too black not at all so me I you 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:09.720
 advise full frame his capture 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:11.980
 only your game I think so yes it 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.840
 so there you can choose the number of 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:22.870
 do you want me me you 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:25.569
 advise 30 or 60 as you want on 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:29.129
 put it there so it's you or you 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:31.780
 want the video to be in 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:33.640
 save so I advise you to the 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.879
 to do in an external hard drive or 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.799
 internally so here here there is nothing touched 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:42.299
 on the other hand here if you want 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:49.239
 record your voice he'll have to 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:53.109
 rely on auto select no to wade in 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:56.920
 direct sound capture of opinion and the 

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:59.370
 choose them vote micro capture so 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:04.060
 here to nothing at all to learn 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:06.549
 so here I thank you for having 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.750

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:09.220
 subscribe leave comments and 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.629
 frankly I thank frankly that 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.079
 is super fun to have so much 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:13.870
 subscribers 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:15.370
 even if not so even if all 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.829
 subscribers are not active do not know 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:21.569
 it's not really serious 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:21.569
 so I'm not telling you anymore
