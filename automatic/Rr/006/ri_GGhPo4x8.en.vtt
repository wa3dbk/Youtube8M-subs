that this game is unique the concept is

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.849 
that this game is unique the concept is
simple<00:00:52.609> you<00:00:53.329> shoot<00:00:53.629> Igor<00:00:54.079> out<00:00:54.350> of<00:00:54.500> a<00:00:54.590> cannon

and<00:00:55.129> into<00:00:55.579> the<00:00:55.730> circus<00:00:56.120> net<00:00:56.390> but<00:00:57.079> how<00:00:57.260> you<00:00:57.320> get

00:00:57.639 --> 00:00:57.649 
and into the circus net but how you get

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:00.939 
and into the circus net but how you get
in<00:00:57.769> there<00:00:58.010> is<00:00:58.190> all<00:00:58.609> the<00:00:58.789> fun<00:00:59.059> this<00:01:00.050> game<00:01:00.289> has<00:01:00.500> 50

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
figure out the best place to shoot Igor

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.710 
figure out the best place to shoot Igor
and<00:01:11.330> at<00:01:11.840> what<00:01:12.080> angle<00:01:12.260> and<00:01:12.710> at<00:01:13.100> what<00:01:13.369> power<00:01:13.720> the

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:14.720 
and at what angle and at what power the

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.469 
and at what angle and at what power the
entire<00:01:14.869> first<00:01:15.500> world<00:01:15.890> is<00:01:16.130> a<00:01:16.159> tutorial<00:01:16.460> and<00:01:17.119> the

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 
entire first world is a tutorial and the

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:19.300 
entire first world is a tutorial and the
rest<00:01:17.689> of<00:01:17.900> the<00:01:17.990> six<00:01:18.229> world<00:01:18.470> to<00:01:18.680> increase<00:01:19.070> in

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
rest of the six world to increase in

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.700 
rest of the six world to increase in
difficulty<00:01:19.790> as<00:01:20.119> you<00:01:20.299> move<00:01:20.509> along<00:01:20.659> and<00:01:21.140> you

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
difficulty as you move along and you

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:23.590 
difficulty as you move along and you
actually<00:01:21.920> face<00:01:22.369> increasingly<00:01:23.240> difficult

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
actually face increasingly difficult

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.249 
actually face increasingly difficult
obstacles<00:01:24.079> along<00:01:24.799> the<00:01:25.009> way<00:01:25.159> as<00:01:25.549> well<00:01:26.079> so<00:01:27.079> it's

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:27.259 
obstacles along the way as well so it's

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:29.109 
obstacles along the way as well so it's
simple<00:01:27.680> you<00:01:28.009> adjust<00:01:28.430> the<00:01:28.610> barrel<00:01:28.939> on<00:01:29.090> the

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 
simple you adjust the barrel on the

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:31.510 
simple you adjust the barrel on the
bottom<00:01:29.509> of<00:01:29.600> the<00:01:29.689> screen<00:01:29.979> then<00:01:30.979> you<00:01:31.130> move<00:01:31.340> the

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
bottom of the screen then you move the

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.190 
bottom of the screen then you move the
firing<00:01:32.000> line<00:01:32.030> to<00:01:32.420> the<00:01:32.540> direction<00:01:32.689> that<00:01:32.990> you

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
firing line to the direction that you

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.620 
firing line to the direction that you
want<00:01:33.229> to<00:01:33.500> shoot<00:01:33.740> and<00:01:34.009> then<00:01:34.820> you<00:01:34.970> pull<00:01:35.210> the<00:01:35.360> star

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
want to shoot and then you pull the star

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.719 
want to shoot and then you pull the star
meter<00:01:35.899> I'll<00:01:36.200> back<00:01:36.470> on<00:01:36.740> either<00:01:36.950> side<00:01:37.340> for<00:01:37.670> the

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729 
meter I'll back on either side for the

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:39.789 
meter I'll back on either side for the
amount<00:01:37.939> of<00:01:38.119> power<00:01:38.360> and<00:01:38.600> velocity<00:01:39.290> you<00:01:39.439> want<00:01:39.680> to

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:39.799 
amount of power and velocity you want to

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:42.340 
amount of power and velocity you want to
fire<00:01:40.009> Igor<00:01:40.490> at<00:01:40.670> and<00:01:40.909> then<00:01:41.540> you<00:01:41.719> just<00:01:41.869> let<00:01:42.140> go

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
fire Igor at and then you just let go

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.069 
fire Igor at and then you just let go
and<00:01:42.380> let<00:01:42.799> the<00:01:42.950> physics<00:01:43.369> do<00:01:43.549> their<00:01:43.729> magic<00:01:44.079> the

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:45.079 
and let the physics do their magic the

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:47.740 
and let the physics do their magic the
result<00:01:45.469> is<00:01:45.619> a<00:01:45.710> fun<00:01:46.219> physics-based<00:01:47.149> puzzle

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
result is a fun physics-based puzzle

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.410 
result is a fun physics-based puzzle
game<00:01:47.960> the<00:01:48.680> physics<00:01:49.130> are<00:01:49.310> top<00:01:49.640> of<00:01:49.670> the<00:01:49.850> line<00:01:50.090> as

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
game the physics are top of the line as

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.330 
game the physics are top of the line as
Igor<00:01:50.780> bounces<00:01:51.350> around<00:01:51.469> the<00:01:51.740> levels<00:01:52.130> and
