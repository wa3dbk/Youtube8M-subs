00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.899
 Today is Anthony 

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:11.600
 I love you on the channel of youtube 

00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:18.260
 You Welcome is better to say Takahiro Sasaki It is the Sasaki-san and I Like this Sony 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:21.510
 If you fall in love with hd lmv 1 and use it from the release date 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:25.470
 Mr. Sasaki is in the video during this time 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:29.699
 nexus 7 and this mv 1 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:34.649
 I uploaded a video that says to connect with nfc 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:41.010
 The first video I mentioned was cut when it was connected 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:45.460
 If I could do it in the comment I wanted to see the moment of connecting it and I write it more 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:50.559
 It showed me a moment to connect me to raise a single video 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:51.280
 After all I 'm envious but it seems to be really easy to connect with nfc 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:58.000
 Ne 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:01:02.200
 In order to help you understand how easy was a connection of it is just nfc in the 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:06.940
 I have to compare with the connection with wi-fi properly 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:12.790
 I think that the difference is confusing I think about this wi-fi connection 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:17.080
 Today and this video, I want to show you this time because it was never that I showed the place 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.990
 Then you see who is connecting with nfc in Sasaki's video 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.540
 Compare by all means 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:27.490
 Please take a look in 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:31.380
 At first it is in the state where the power is turned on. Using this cross button in that state. 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.860
 Pick the bottom of the wi-fi icon 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.700
 Pick 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:42.060
 So you are looking for a wi-fi store 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:42.060
 From the ipad settings screen 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.830
 Wifi 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:52.330
 Had 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:55.760
 In this, m v has a choice of wi-fi so choose it 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:02:00.910
 It was connected on that 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:00.910
 Launch this Play Memories app 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:13.530
 Yes I 'm connected with this, I wonder if the room is a bit messy 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:18.510
 I can only show you on the spot 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:22.110
 Repeat It is this kind of state and turn on the power 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:25.470
 Select the wi-fi icon and click 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:31.650
 From the ipad or iphone setting screen 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:33.550
 If you select the M-One's wi-fi and finally launch the app, it will be connected 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.880
 It means that compared with that 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:44.110
 It says if I Well, but I want you to look at its Sasaki's videos 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:50.320
 If the connection of nfc only turns on both powers, it will connect only by going back to the end 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:55.350
 This is kind of really envious, so it 's because of Mbui one and ios terminal 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:55.350
 I was talking about wi-fi connection 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:03.490
