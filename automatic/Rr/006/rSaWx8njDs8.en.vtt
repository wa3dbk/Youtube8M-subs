that it's slipping on the shift in Forks
like<00:04:14.000> crazy<00:04:14.860> we've<00:04:15.860> got<00:04:16.010> the<00:04:16.160> wrong<00:04:16.370> little

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150

this<00:04:19.800> one<00:04:20.010> appears<00:04:20.160> to<00:04:20.489> be<00:04:21.680> okay

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020 
this one appears to be okay

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:28.800 
this one appears to be okay
and<00:04:24.440> then<00:04:24.590> look<00:04:24.860> at<00:04:24.979> the<00:04:25.099> alignment

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.240 

you're<00:04:29.110> supposed<00:04:29.410> to<00:04:29.500> take<00:04:29.770> I<00:04:29.920> think<00:04:29.950> is<00:04:30.220> a

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
you're supposed to take I think is a

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:33.000 
you're supposed to take I think is a
3/16<00:04:31.180> rod<00:04:31.480> and<00:04:31.960> stick<00:04:32.230> down<00:04:32.470> through<00:04:32.800> there

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.010 
3/16 rod and stick down through there

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:35.250 
3/16 rod and stick down through there
and<00:04:33.040> line<00:04:33.460> it<00:04:33.490> through<00:04:33.820> the<00:04:33.910> holes<00:04:34.150> and<00:04:34.510> all

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:35.260 
and line it through the holes and all

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.540 
and line it through the holes and all
three<00:04:35.650> of<00:04:35.740> these<00:04:35.860> rods

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:40.879 

and<00:04:38.759> then<00:04:39.000> adjust<00:04:39.449> the<00:04:39.569> linkage<00:04:40.110> so<00:04:40.590> it's<00:04:40.740> all

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:40.889 
and then adjust the linkage so it's all

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:43.249 
and then adjust the linkage so it's all
kind<00:04:41.190> of<00:04:41.280> neutral<00:04:41.729> act<00:04:42.599> and<00:04:42.900> while<00:04:43.110> the

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:43.259 
kind of neutral act and while the

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:45.670 
kind of neutral act and while the
transmission<00:04:43.979> is<00:04:44.160> it

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 
transmission is it

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.100 
transmission is it
and<00:04:46.100> obviously<00:04:46.310> it's<00:04:46.910> a<00:04:47.030> mile<00:04:47.360> from<00:04:47.870> that

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.110 
and obviously it's a mile from that

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:50.189 
and obviously it's a mile from that
being<00:04:48.500> right

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:50.199 
being right

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:54.010 
being right
and<00:04:50.529> that's<00:04:50.740> a<00:04:50.919> Hurst<00:04:51.189> shifter<00:04:51.909> so

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.020 
and that's a Hurst shifter so

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.080 
and that's a Hurst shifter so
let's<00:04:54.620> see<00:04:54.800> what<00:04:54.980> we<00:04:55.070> come<00:04:55.220> up<00:04:55.280> with<00:04:55.400> here<00:04:55.610> I

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.090 
let's see what we come up with here I

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:59.710 
let's see what we come up with here I
think<00:04:57.050> the<00:04:57.140> battery's<00:04:57.500> going<00:04:57.770> dead<00:04:58.600> well<00:04:59.600> I'll

00:04:59.710 --> 00:04:59.720 
think the battery's going dead well I'll

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:05.290 
think the battery's going dead well I'll
get<00:04:59.870> you<00:04:59.930> a<00:05:00.110> new<00:05:00.230> one<00:05:00.440> okay<00:05:01.930> okay<00:05:03.910> but<00:05:04.910> before<00:05:05.060> I

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.300 
get you a new one okay okay but before I

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:09.670 
get you a new one okay okay but before I
do<00:05:05.420> that<00:05:07.270> here's<00:05:08.270> what<00:05:08.480> we<00:05:08.660> see<00:05:08.690> inside<00:05:09.380> this

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:09.680 
do that here's what we see inside this

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.150 
do that here's what we see inside this
transmission<00:05:11.530> everything<00:05:12.530> looks<00:05:12.950> pretty

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:13.160 
transmission everything looks pretty

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:14.730 
transmission everything looks pretty
good

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:14.740 
good

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.320 
good
without<00:05:15.740> total<00:05:16.250> disassembly<00:05:17.030> there's<00:05:17.240> a

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:17.330 
without total disassembly there's a

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:22.060 
without total disassembly there's a
little<00:05:17.600> bit<00:05:17.780> of<00:05:19.090> rusted<00:05:20.090> right<00:05:20.480> there<00:05:20.810> I<00:05:21.410> think

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:22.070 
little bit of rusted right there I think

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:28.150 
little bit of rusted right there I think
that'll<00:05:22.400> bother<00:05:22.640> anything<00:05:25.960> all<00:05:26.960> years<00:05:27.620> appear

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:28.160 
that'll bother anything all years appear

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:32.040 
that'll bother anything all years appear
to<00:05:28.400> be<00:05:28.580> in<00:05:29.230> pretty<00:05:30.230> good<00:05:30.350> shape

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:32.050 
to be in pretty good shape

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:39.340 
to be in pretty good shape
synchros<00:05:33.050> still<00:05:33.440> intact<00:05:33.890> I<00:05:35.470> think<00:05:38.230> all<00:05:39.230> we

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:39.350 
synchros still intact I think all we

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:43.290 
synchros still intact I think all we
need<00:05:39.530> to<00:05:39.650> do<00:05:39.800> is<00:05:39.950> put<00:05:40.160> a<00:05:40.190> new<00:05:40.370> seal<00:05:40.730> right<00:05:41.180> there

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:43.300 
need to do is put a new seal right there

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:45.850 
need to do is put a new seal right there
bolt<00:05:44.300> this<00:05:44.480> thing<00:05:44.810> back<00:05:45.080> together<00:05:45.260> maybe

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:45.860 
bolt this thing back together maybe

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:47.860 
bolt this thing back together maybe
clean<00:05:46.280> some<00:05:46.580> of<00:05:46.730> the<00:05:46.790> Rusty's<00:05:47.270> out<00:05:47.510> of<00:05:47.660> there<00:05:47.840> a

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:47.870 
clean some of the Rusty's out of there a

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:54.240 
clean some of the Rusty's out of there a
little<00:05:48.080> bit<00:05:48.290> I<00:05:51.520> think<00:05:52.520> this<00:05:52.670> one<00:05:52.850> will<00:05:52.940> be<00:05:53.090> okay

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:54.250 
little bit I think this one will be okay

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:58.720 
little bit I think this one will be okay
this<00:05:55.250> is<00:05:55.490> one<00:05:55.760> I<00:05:56.770> used<00:05:57.770> to<00:05:57.860> have<00:05:58.130> in<00:05:58.490> the
