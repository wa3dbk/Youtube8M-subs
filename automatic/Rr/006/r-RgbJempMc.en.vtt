right so this is what we have so far I

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.170 
right so this is what we have so far I
know<00:03:49.220> it<00:03:49.370> didn't<00:03:49.610> seem<00:03:49.790> like<00:03:49.820> that<00:03:50.000> long

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
know it didn't seem like that long

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.470 
know it didn't seem like that long
because<00:03:50.540> I<00:03:50.720> had<00:03:50.870> most<00:03:51.080> of<00:03:51.170> it<00:03:51.320> in<00:03:51.440> fast-forward

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
because I had most of it in fast-forward

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.560 
because I had most of it in fast-forward
but<00:03:53.480> uh<00:03:53.510> this<00:03:53.900> video<00:03:54.760> filming<00:03:55.760> is<00:03:56.030> actually

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:56.570 
but uh this video filming is actually

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:03.040 
but uh this video filming is actually
over<00:03:57.110> 60<00:03:57.830> minutes<00:03:58.160> right<00:03:58.340> now<00:03:59.290> and<00:04:01.900> so<00:04:02.900> I<00:04:02.930> think
