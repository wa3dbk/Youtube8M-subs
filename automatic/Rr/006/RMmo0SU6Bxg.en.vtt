okay<00:00:03.360> this<00:00:03.750> is<00:00:03.929> my<00:00:04.140> Arduino<00:00:05.100> based<00:00:06.000> MIDI

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
okay this is my Arduino based MIDI

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:08.330 
okay this is my Arduino based MIDI
controller<00:00:07.140> this<00:00:07.440> is<00:00:07.560> the<00:00:07.710> schematic<00:00:07.919> for

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
controller this is the schematic for

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.740 
controller this is the schematic for
it's<00:00:08.719> I'm<00:00:09.719> using<00:00:11.090> 10<00:00:12.090> buttons

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
it's I'm using 10 buttons

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.750 
it's I'm using 10 buttons
original<00:00:13.259> ones<00:00:13.410> use<00:00:13.559> 12<00:00:13.860> I'm<00:00:14.130> using<00:00:14.280> 10<00:00:14.580> now

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:16.760 
original ones use 12 I'm using 10 now

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.870 
original ones use 12 I'm using 10 now
six<00:00:17.760> potentiometers<00:00:18.510> and<00:00:18.539> of<00:00:18.869> course<00:00:19.699> as<00:00:20.699> we

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
six potentiometers and of course as we

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.269 
six potentiometers and of course as we
know<00:00:20.910> board<00:00:21.240> who's<00:00:21.510> new<00:00:21.689> team<00:00:21.900> again<00:00:22.230> and<00:00:23.539> yeah

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:25.279 
know board who's new team again and yeah

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:28.700 
know board who's new team again and yeah
there's<00:00:26.279> basically<00:00:26.640> 10<00:00:26.880> notes<00:00:27.180> here<00:00:27.710> all

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
there's basically 10 notes here all

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.890 
there's basically 10 notes here all
these<00:00:28.800> buttons<00:00:29.070> playing<00:00:29.429> notes<00:00:29.900> starting

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
these buttons playing notes starting

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.880 
these buttons playing notes starting
with<00:00:31.140> middle<00:00:31.769> C<00:00:32.009> and<00:00:32.250> they<00:00:32.790> play<00:00:33.350> an<00:00:34.350> octave<00:00:34.530> up

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
with middle C and they play an octave up

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.819 
with middle C and they play an octave up
playing<00:00:35.309> a<00:00:35.489> blue<00:00:35.820> scale<00:00:38.840> the<00:00:39.840> potentiometers

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
playing a blue scale the potentiometers

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.660 
playing a blue scale the potentiometers
all<00:00:41.070> have<00:00:41.280> different<00:00:41.760> command<00:00:42.480> changes<00:00:43.670> the

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
all have different command changes the

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.900 
all have different command changes the
first<00:00:45.149> one<00:00:45.829> changes<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:48.289> MIDI<00:00:49.289> type<00:00:49.910> message

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
first one changes the MIDI type message

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.680 
first one changes the MIDI type message
of<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.629> buttons<00:00:52.640> into<00:00:53.640> a<00:00:53.670> command<00:00:54.090> change<00:00:54.360> and

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
of the buttons into a command change and

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.299 
of the buttons into a command change and
so<00:00:54.930> we<00:00:54.960> can<00:00:55.230> use<00:00:55.260> those<00:00:55.620> ones<00:00:55.890> to<00:00:56.070> trigger

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
so we can use those ones to trigger

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.150 
so we can use those ones to trigger
loops<00:00:56.550> as<00:00:56.820> instead<00:00:57.300> of<00:00:57.420> playing<00:00:57.809> notes<00:00:58.160> the

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
loops as instead of playing notes the

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.959 
loops as instead of playing notes the
second<00:00:59.579> one<00:00:59.760> pitch<00:01:00.149> shifts<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.780> entire<00:01:01.079> range

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:01.969 
second one pitch shifts the entire range

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:06.200 
second one pitch shifts the entire range
and<00:01:03.680> the<00:01:04.680> other<00:01:05.070> Farwell<00:01:05.700> will<00:01:05.880> show<00:01:06.030> you<00:01:06.119> what

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
and the other Farwell will show you what

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.130 
and the other Farwell will show you what
the<00:01:06.299> other<00:01:06.360> four<00:01:06.600> do<00:01:06.780> that's<00:01:07.049> pretty<00:01:07.170> cool<00:01:09.140> the

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
the other four do that's pretty cool the

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.810 
the other four do that's pretty cool the

can't<00:01:22.259> see

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
can't see

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.560 
can't see
yep<00:01:23.570> he's<00:01:24.570> receiving<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.080> MIDI<00:01:26.330> and<00:01:27.330> that's

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
yep he's receiving the MIDI and that's

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:35.109 
yep he's receiving the MIDI and that's
connected<00:01:27.869> through<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:28.320> USB<00:01:28.770> to<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.659> laptop

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:38.330 

when<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.450> software<00:01:36.780> using<00:01:37.140> is<00:01:37.439> reason<00:01:38.100> which

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
when the software using is reason which

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.780 
when the software using is reason which
is<00:01:38.369> MIDI<00:01:39.000> enabled<00:01:39.509> software<00:01:40.579> recognize<00:01:41.579> MIDI

is MIDI enabled software recognize MIDI
messages<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:42.570> we're<00:01:42.689> going<00:01:42.869> to<00:01:42.960> show<00:01:43.110> you

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
messages and we're going to show you

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.249 
messages and we're going to show you
what's<00:01:43.619> achievable<00:01:45.020> with<00:01:46.020> MIDI

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
what's achievable with MIDI

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:55.310 
what's achievable with MIDI
communication<00:01:51.590> yep<00:01:52.590> okay<00:01:53.369> right<00:01:54.140> okay<00:01:55.140> so

communication yep okay right okay so

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.969 
communication yep okay right okay so
first<00:01:55.710> thing<00:01:55.829> I'm<00:01:55.890> gonna<00:01:55.979> do<00:01:56.219> is<00:01:56.430> show<00:01:56.880> you<00:01:57.979> if

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
first thing I'm gonna do is show you if

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:05.630 
first thing I'm gonna do is show you if
we<00:01:59.280> can<00:01:59.670> trigger<00:01:59.850> loops

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:11.729 

also<00:02:06.640> the<00:02:06.850> envelope<00:02:09.269> using<00:02:10.269> this<00:02:10.739> presented

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:11.739 
also the envelope using this presented

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:31.199 
also the envelope using this presented
which<00:02:11.890> is<00:02:12.010> assigned<00:02:12.310> to<00:02:12.760> do<00:02:13.030> so<00:02:28.290> okay<00:02:29.290> um<00:02:30.209> else

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
which is assigned to do so okay um else

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:37.170 
which is assigned to do so okay um else
we<00:02:31.330> go<00:02:31.450> we've<00:02:31.630> got<00:02:31.660> a<00:02:31.750> bum<00:02:31.989> go<00:02:32.170> beat<00:02:35.940> you<00:02:36.940> can<00:02:37.060> do

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
we go we've got a bum go beat you can do

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.509 
we go we've got a bum go beat you can do
it<00:02:37.299> basically<00:02:37.450> the<00:02:37.660> same<00:02:37.780> thing<00:02:38.140> that<00:02:41.519> you'd

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 
it basically the same thing that you'd

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:49.910 
it basically the same thing that you'd
be<00:02:42.610> able<00:02:42.730> to<00:02:42.880> see<00:02:47.190> no<00:02:48.190> assembly<00:02:48.700> there's<00:02:48.940> it's

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
be able to see no assembly there's it's

00:02:49.920 --> 00:03:37.849 
be able to see no assembly there's it's
reading<00:02:50.920> the<00:02:50.950> value<00:02:51.430> from<00:03:32.489> this<00:03:36.540> changes

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:37.859 
reading the value from this changes

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:51.709 
reading the value from this changes
these<00:03:39.660> from<00:03:40.660> triggering<00:03:40.989> loops<00:03:41.290> into<00:03:42.600> notes

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:51.719 

00:03:51.719 --> 00:03:59.360 

there<00:03:52.719> you<00:03:52.810> go<00:03:52.959> and<00:03:54.629> we'll<00:03:55.629> show<00:03:55.840> you<00:03:55.870> trick<00:03:56.260> of

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:05.099 

plane<00:04:00.370> loops<00:04:02.879> and<00:04:03.879> you<00:04:03.909> can<00:04:04.090> store<00:04:04.329> them<00:04:04.569> also

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:05.109 
plane loops and you can store them also

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:09.000 
plane loops and you can store them also
using<00:04:05.500> the<00:04:05.620> same<00:04:05.829> potentiometer<00:04:07.709> there<00:04:08.709> we<00:04:08.829> go

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 
using the same potentiometer there we go

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:10.740 
using the same potentiometer there we go
and<00:04:09.340> then<00:04:09.489> we<00:04:09.579> can<00:04:09.609> play<00:04:09.879> notes<00:04:10.120> over<00:04:10.420> this<00:04:10.569> off

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
and then we can play notes over this off

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:17.099 
and then we can play notes over this off
just<00:04:15.180> gonna<00:04:16.180> get<00:04:16.329> rid<00:04:16.479> of<00:04:16.630> that<00:04:16.750> annoying

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:17.109 
just gonna get rid of that annoying

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:26.460 
just gonna get rid of that annoying
guitar<00:04:17.680> for<00:04:17.859> a<00:04:17.889> second<00:04:22.500> cool<00:04:25.110> and<00:04:26.110> now<00:04:26.380> I'm

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
guitar for a second cool and now I'm

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:30.060 
guitar for a second cool and now I'm
going<00:04:26.620> to<00:04:26.710> use<00:04:27.449> this<00:04:28.449> potentiometer<00:04:28.930> which<00:04:29.830> is

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070 
going to use this potentiometer which is

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.790 
going to use this potentiometer which is
set<00:04:30.789> to<00:04:31.060> change<00:04:31.479> the<00:04:31.720> phase<00:04:31.930> of<00:04:32.259> the<00:04:32.530> notes

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 
set to change the phase of the notes

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:52.260 
set to change the phase of the notes
played<00:04:50.340> very<00:04:51.340> very<00:04:51.699> very<00:04:51.909> good

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 
played very very very good

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:56.010 
played very very very good
we<00:04:53.260> can<00:04:53.380> also<00:04:53.500> demonstrate<00:04:53.770> the<00:04:54.840> point<00:04:55.840> of

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
we can also demonstrate the point of

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:57.390 
we can also demonstrate the point of
this<00:04:56.139> potentiometer<00:04:56.500> this<00:04:56.979> changes<00:04:57.370> the

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:57.400 
this potentiometer this changes the

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.960 
this potentiometer this changes the
pitch<00:04:57.669> of<00:04:58.030> the<00:04:58.240> entire<00:04:58.570> range<00:04:59.699> entire<00:05:00.699> blue

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:00.970 
pitch of the entire range entire blue

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:15.000 
pitch of the entire range entire blue
scale

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:15.010 

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:37.360 

yeah<00:05:30.340> beautiful<00:05:33.190> stop<00:05:34.190> these<00:05:34.400> loops<00:05:34.670> now<00:05:36.370> good

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:37.370 
yeah beautiful stop these loops now good

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:41.830 
yeah beautiful stop these loops now good
so<00:05:37.610> that<00:05:37.850> is<00:05:38.090> my<00:05:38.360> Arduino<00:05:38.870> MIDI<00:05:39.350> controller
