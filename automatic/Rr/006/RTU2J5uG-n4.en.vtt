I<00:02:03.550> don't<00:02:04.550> know<00:02:04.670> I<00:02:04.700> think<00:02:05.830> as<00:02:06.830> far<00:02:06.890> as<00:02:07.220> weapons

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.430 
I don't know I think as far as weapons

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.330 
I don't know I think as far as weapons
go<00:02:07.760> compared<00:02:08.390> to<00:02:08.450> powers<00:02:08.869> you<00:02:09.680> can<00:02:09.890> make<00:02:10.070> any

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
go compared to powers you can make any

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.670 
go compared to powers you can make any
weapon<00:02:10.850> just<00:02:11.060> about<00:02:11.300> work<00:02:11.990> with<00:02:12.200> any<00:02:12.410> power

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
weapon just about work with any power

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.400 
weapon just about work with any power
and<00:02:13.190> my<00:02:13.340> opinion<00:02:13.730> I<00:02:13.970> mean<00:02:14.900> there's<00:02:15.080> a<00:02:15.140> few

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
and my opinion I mean there's a few

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.300 
and my opinion I mean there's a few
exceptions<00:02:15.740> but<00:02:16.250> for<00:02:16.490> the<00:02:16.580> most<00:02:16.760> part<00:02:18.310> because

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
exceptions but for the most part because

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.400 
exceptions but for the most part because
you<00:02:19.490> can<00:02:19.670> customize<00:02:20.210> weapons<00:02:20.630> later<00:02:20.960> as<00:02:21.260> you

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
you can customize weapons later as you

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.990 
you can customize weapons later as you
get<00:02:21.560> more<00:02:21.770> feet<00:02:22.040> points<00:02:22.490> I<00:02:24.580> think<00:02:25.580> you<00:02:25.760> can

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
get more feet points I think you can

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.710 
get more feet points I think you can
tailor<00:02:26.930> any<00:02:27.320> weapon<00:02:27.800> to<00:02:28.160> a<00:02:28.430> certain<00:02:29.270> power<00:02:29.420> you

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
tailor any weapon to a certain power you

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:35.820
