00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:13.160
 a triangle 

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:16.720
 objective is the best exercise for 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.720
 improve strength in positions 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.289
 soccer allows you positions 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.509
 perfect in this non-twisted position 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.460
 is that you are going to see changes 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:27.960
 aesthetics in the player begin to 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.679
 appear streaks on the side of the 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.030
 leg the idea-force how many times with 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.519
 you see that we make a 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.229
 intermittent circuit where we put a 

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:40.949
 work compensates for their work and 

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:44.390
 great the good ones really work at 

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:47.390
 gaudio fernando with a tennis player ranking 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.390
 503 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.600
 I have the guy to do past 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:55.200
 the speed assumes that the guy gives you 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:58.260
 one speed the thistle type tachometer 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.910
 he tells you he started the test with 90 that 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.250
 shape allows you through the 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.690
 heart rate know when and the 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.729
 guy is wrong that is telling you 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.470
 why is it wrong the guy has a 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.890
 complication you have to solve 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.890
 from 2 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.550
 how long it takes to explode in the 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.480
 head 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.480
 we are incorporating 

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:27.500
 and suddenly when I was landing 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.990
 a ball was thrown the idea and 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.250
 intensity plus variability 60 and 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.049
 easily solve for here and there 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:39.770
 to here and there as many weeks 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:39.770
 I repeat this is fun is nonsense 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:49.140
 frogs so that if someone is very good 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.479
 apparently 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.770
 and at that speed generated it has to be 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.770
 able to brake and change direction 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:08.930
 like cats and here the difference appears
