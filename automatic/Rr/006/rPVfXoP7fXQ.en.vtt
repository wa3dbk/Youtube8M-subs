00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:09.640 

I'll<00:00:07.490> be<00:00:07.640> honest<00:00:07.879> when<00:00:08.059> the<00:00:08.690> Kings<00:00:08.960> announced

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:09.650 
I'll be honest when the Kings announced

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:10.690 
I'll be honest when the Kings announced
that<00:00:09.740> they<00:00:09.860> were<00:00:09.920> taking<00:00:10.219> Kevin<00:00:10.370> Burton<00:00:10.580> I

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:10.700 
that they were taking Kevin Burton I

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:11.799 
that they were taking Kevin Burton I
didn't<00:00:10.879> know<00:00:10.940> what<00:00:11.030> everyone<00:00:11.389> was<00:00:11.570> and<00:00:11.780> I

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:11.809 
didn't know what everyone was and I

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:14.409 
didn't know what everyone was and I
think<00:00:12.049> probably<00:00:12.349> 99%<00:00:12.950> of<00:00:13.160> Cates<00:00:13.400> fans<00:00:13.639> didn't

00:00:14.409 --> 00:00:14.419 
think probably 99% of Cates fans didn't

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:15.820 
think probably 99% of Cates fans didn't
know<00:00:14.480> who<00:00:14.629> Kevin<00:00:14.839> Martin<00:00:15.139> was<00:00:15.320> coming<00:00:15.589> from<00:00:15.709> a

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:15.830 
know who Kevin Martin was coming from a

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:21.850 
know who Kevin Martin was coming from a
school<00:00:15.950> like<00:00:16.219> Western<00:00:16.609> Carolina

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:21.860 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:28.390 

if<00:00:22.310> Martin<00:00:23.110> started<00:00:24.110> to<00:00:24.200> make<00:00:26.770> power<00:00:27.770> does<00:00:28.279> he

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:28.400 
if Martin started to make power does he

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.990 
if Martin started to make power does he
do<00:00:28.610> that

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:29.000 
do that

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.429 
do that
he's<00:00:29.150> almost<00:00:29.300> like<00:00:29.540> if<00:00:29.779> we're<00:00:29.930> gonna<00:00:30.050> go<00:00:30.230> into

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:30.439 
he's almost like if we're gonna go into

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:40.240 
he's almost like if we're gonna go into
the<00:00:30.500> factory<00:00:30.860> and<00:00:38.379> defensively<00:00:39.379> he's<00:00:40.100> as

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.250 
the factory and defensively he's as

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.250 
the factory and defensively he's as
productive<00:00:40.820> as<00:00:40.970> any<00:00:41.239> master<00:00:41.629> ball<00:00:41.809> player<00:00:42.110> in

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:42.260 
productive as any master ball player in

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.500 
productive as any master ball player in
the<00:00:42.350> world<00:00:42.559> today<00:00:42.940> period<00:00:43.940> certainly<00:00:44.360> no

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.510 
the world today period certainly no

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.119 
the world today period certainly no
question<00:00:44.660> when<00:00:44.989> he<00:00:45.050> was<00:00:45.199> drafted<00:00:45.650> there<00:00:46.010> was

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:46.129 
question when he was drafted there was

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:48.400 
question when he was drafted there was
hope<00:00:46.340> that<00:00:46.550> he<00:00:46.670> could<00:00:46.879> play<00:00:47.660> in<00:00:48.080> the<00:00:48.230> league

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:48.410 
hope that he could play in the league

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.860 
hope that he could play in the league
and<00:00:48.680> maybe<00:00:48.890> be<00:00:49.190> a<00:00:49.220> regular<00:00:50.059> rotation<00:00:50.239> player

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870 
and maybe be a regular rotation player

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:52.689 
and maybe be a regular rotation player
certainly<00:00:51.530> Kevin<00:00:51.860> stone<00:00:52.070> that<00:00:52.250> out<00:00:52.519> the

00:00:52.689 --> 00:00:52.699 
certainly Kevin stone that out the

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:55.680 
certainly Kevin stone that out the
window

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:55.690 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.329 

he's<00:00:56.690> got<00:00:56.900> the<00:00:57.019> intelligence<00:00:57.350> to<00:00:57.860> understand

00:00:58.329 --> 00:00:58.339 
he's got the intelligence to understand

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:00.189 
he's got the intelligence to understand
what<00:00:58.640> he<00:00:58.729> needs<00:00:58.909> to<00:00:59.059> do<00:00:59.269> to<00:00:59.299> get<00:00:59.600> better<00:00:59.900> I

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:00.199 
what he needs to do to get better I

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:01.899 
what he needs to do to get better I
think<00:01:00.379> he's<00:01:00.530> a<00:01:00.559> borderline<00:01:01.159> all-star<00:01:01.699> now

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:01.909 
think he's a borderline all-star now

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:03.910 
think he's a borderline all-star now
even<00:01:02.690> if<00:01:02.809> he<00:01:02.900> just<00:01:03.110> stayed<00:01:03.320> the<00:01:03.500> same<00:01:03.530> from

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
even if he just stayed the same from

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.740 
even if he just stayed the same from
here<00:01:04.129> on<00:01:04.309> out<00:01:04.339> he<00:01:04.670> would<00:01:04.790> be<00:01:04.909> very<00:01:05.180> good<00:01:05.510> but

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
here on out he would be very good but

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.390 
here on out he would be very good but
he's<00:01:06.200> got<00:01:06.380> a<00:01:06.409> chance<00:01:06.680> to<00:01:06.770> be<00:01:06.890> better<00:01:07.100> than<00:01:07.220> that

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400 
he's got a chance to be better than that

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.000 
he's got a chance to be better than that
so<00:01:07.850> Kevin<00:01:08.150> Martin<00:01:08.450> is<00:01:08.659> playing<00:01:09.010> exceptionally

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.010 
so Kevin Martin is playing exceptionally

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.210 
so Kevin Martin is playing exceptionally
well<00:01:10.250> and<00:01:10.580> Reggie<00:01:11.360> Theus<00:01:11.720> he<00:01:12.200> said<00:01:12.500> hey<00:01:12.650> this

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
well and Reggie Theus he said hey this

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.420 
well and Reggie Theus he said hey this
guy<00:01:13.490> can<00:01:14.060> just<00:01:14.299> get<00:01:14.479> a<00:01:14.690> lot<00:01:15.080> lot<00:01:15.799> better<00:01:16.220> he's

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
guy can just get a lot lot better he's

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.060 
guy can just get a lot lot better he's
good<00:01:16.640> now<00:01:16.720> but<00:01:17.720> he<00:01:17.869> has<00:01:17.900> a<00:01:18.020> chance<00:01:18.409> to<00:01:18.560> be<00:01:18.680> very

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
good now but he has a chance to be very

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:20.080 
good now but he has a chance to be very
very<00:01:19.400> special

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
very special

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:21.700 
very special
