yellow panting so as you can see the two

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.720 
yellow panting so as you can see the two
layers<00:02:45.930> have<00:02:46.110> been<00:02:46.140> selected<00:02:46.739> and<00:02:46.890> then<00:02:47.340> after

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
layers have been selected and then after

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.590 
layers have been selected and then after
that<00:02:47.910> control<00:02:48.540> P<00:02:48.870> dimensional<00:02:49.830> years<00:02:50.600> and

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
that control P dimensional years and

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.440 
that control P dimensional years and
then<00:02:51.780> after<00:02:52.050> that<00:02:52.700> control<00:02:53.700> T<00:02:54.680> right-click

then after that control T right-click

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.000 
then after that control T right-click
perspective<00:02:57.450> and<00:02:57.780> we're<00:02:58.170> just<00:02:58.290> going<00:02:58.590> to<00:02:58.650> drag

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
perspective and we're just going to drag

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.110 
perspective and we're just going to drag
the<00:02:59.190> corners

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
the corners

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.520 
the corners
well<00:03:00.750> they<00:03:00.989> self

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:10.240 

and<00:03:06.530> now<00:03:06.680> let's<00:03:06.980> just<00:03:07.040> find<00:03:07.400> the<00:03:07.820> corner<00:03:09.250> they

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
and now let's just find the corner they

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.760 
and now let's just find the corner they
were<00:03:10.930> around<00:03:11.930> there<00:03:12.350> led<00:03:12.740> to<00:03:12.770> stay<00:03:13.490> behind

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:14.770 
were around there led to stay behind

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:18.570

what gives if you are going to example

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:49.080 
what gives if you are going to example
make<00:05:44.750> the<00:05:44.930> technics<00:05:46.270> make<00:05:47.270> attacks<00:05:47.690> and<00:05:48.080> then

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:49.090 
make the technics make attacks and then

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:53.440 
make the technics make attacks and then
jump<00:05:50.090> to<00:05:50.180> conclude<00:05:51.080> and<00:05:51.650> perspective<00:05:52.460> right

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:53.450 
jump to conclude and perspective right

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:56.080 
jump to conclude and perspective right
away<00:05:53.690> so<00:05:53.750> as<00:05:54.440> you<00:05:54.590> can<00:05:54.710> see<00:05:54.770> against<00:05:55.700> I<00:05:55.910> like

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:56.090 
away so as you can see against I like

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:58.840 
away so as you can see against I like
the<00:05:56.210> perspective<00:05:56.900> perspective<00:05:57.890> that's<00:05:58.700> why

00:05:58.840 --> 00:05:58.850 
the perspective perspective that's why

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:02.290 
the perspective perspective that's why
you<00:05:59.660> need<00:05:59.900> to<00:05:59.930> like<00:06:00.800> like<00:06:01.270> pass<00:06:02.270> the

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:02.300 
you need to like like pass the

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.870 
you need to like like pass the
nightstand<00:06:02.870> so<00:06:03.160> when<00:06:04.160> you<00:06:04.340> go<00:06:04.760> in<00:06:04.820> to

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:04.880 
nightstand so when you go in to

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.890 
nightstand so when you go in to
transform<00:06:05.540> it<00:06:05.720> the<00:06:06.050> perspective<00:06:06.800> the

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:07.900 
transform it the perspective the

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:12.910 
transform it the perspective the
perspective<00:06:08.900> tool<00:06:09.560> would<00:06:10.520> work<00:06:10.790> so<00:06:11.660> I<00:06:12.080> could

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:12.920 
perspective tool would work so I could

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:21.160 
perspective tool would work so I could
drag<00:06:13.550> the<00:06:13.670> corner<00:06:14.060> smell<00:06:14.360> that<00:06:19.030> yeah<00:06:20.170> so
