 bomb power here you see age 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:53.039

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:03.629
 have my elgato tuned play games 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:08.760

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:09.840
 Lightning attack and rice here the camper 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.610
 playstation 4 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.299
 you can not be like me 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.130
 I'm glad that this one after 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:21.330
 editors one by one 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:23.850
 it was pretty critical there asia always 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.850
 started here 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.530
 this duty we have become 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.659
 of course, behind us since I have to 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.790
 always watch out here at the back 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.340
 the front because they have already against the 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.170
 The referee wanted to bind me 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.100
 necessarily have 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.409
 now maybe you can see again 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:44.399
 here from behind zack there comes now 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.780
 equal to one now I'm back 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.720
 above so i really have to be permanent 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.750
 always back and forth and says here is too 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:02:01.190
 already the cam I said I claim 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:02:03.990
 So it was really 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:06.210
 So you can not say that I'm gold 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.190
 have in the corner because you have the 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.239
 opponents wanted michael from again 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:14.250
 have the corner out and yes it was already 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:15.840
 pretty demanding too in there too 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.600
 he stays the whole while 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.280
 Action is not so that one 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:24.269
 sits in the corner and gets away 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:27.079
 but it is so that art 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:30.450
 is yes in opponent farmers to consider 

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:35.430
 that's the thing here somehow me 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:38.430
 put in the corner that the variant the 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:45.180
 I am here at walls that is also a 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:47.930
 bit lax well well 1.3 I have the 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.930
 opponents disassembled 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.410
 I'm glad you turned on 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.870
 do not rate comment 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:59.690
 forget and then we'll see each other 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.690
