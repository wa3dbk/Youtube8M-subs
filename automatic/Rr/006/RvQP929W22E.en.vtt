00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.680
 hello viewers my channel is my name 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:08.970
 Vince and and in this I will tell you how 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:10.380
 increase the FPS in the game witch 3 let's start 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:15.030
 the easiest way 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:16.619
 this way is that you 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.590
 remove from game 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.539
 all the grass means go to the folder with 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.609
 play 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:29.340
 go to the folder bin shader speed 3 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:31.769
 shader and at the very end you will have 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:36.899
 here are such a file you select them mod 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:41.790
 to psp with and I chose aha just them 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:43.950
 cut some folder and all that 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:49.260
 there is grass in your game no but grass for 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:52.199
 alchemy will also stay so well now 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.860
 the way is more complex well more precisely not more difficult 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.770
 a little longer 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:01:01.649
 and so, in principle, they are the same 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:02.579
 then go to the game folder again 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.769
 and 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.260
 link to cheat in the description of the program 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.689
 that means you unzip it 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:13.049
 Come and you will have these three files 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.450
 just throw three files into the folder with 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:19.020
 play 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:24.979
 so then go to the game folder 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:28.220
 and you will have such an application 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:28.220
 run it 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.710
 we will start now 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:40.220
 here 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:42.730
 Witcher 3 hunter sconfig well here probably 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:45.380
 the most important thing is that it comes in handy 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:51.320
 rendering here, I suggest you include 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:53.630
 all but the work he because well such 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:58.310
 cool fps principle not to reduce 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:59.470
 so here I propose to turn it off well 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:03.110
 here you yourself 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:06.110
 customize that is for the weak 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:11.600
 computers I recommend 3 that is, this is about 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:14.860
 a load of items, that is, three will 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.040
 they are more or less close to you to dive 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:20.590
 surrendered 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:23.690
 texture sizes maximum textures 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:28.850
 maximum texture size I suggest 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:35.090
 leave 1024 maximum size atlas 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:37.760
 textures too 1024 well here too 128 thousand 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:43.640
 than 100 rocket 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:46.670
 shadow size cubic shadow size 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:52.180
 would yes as it is written here leave here 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:55.180
 128 and here, too, put 128 further 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:58.730
 texture memory allocation 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:04.549
 vodafone ace and 500 but for weak computers 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:07.370
 it is better to allocate 200 so here 80 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:11.480
 standard and here, too, according to the standard all 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:14.810
 leave here initially all of you 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.310
 should stand on one rki here 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:20.359
 should be on 10 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:26.389
 here at 40 50 and 10 but I suggest you 

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:34.810
 one division reduce here so here it is then 

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:34.810
 not bad you tps will increase so it 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:46.170
 you can turn it off too but i will leave 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:48.660
 on so here turn it off so it 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:52.170
 also associated with rendering so 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:54.989
 not bad, it seems, should increase FPS so 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:59.220
 this blur put on nothing so what 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:04:01.530
 development greatly reduces fps so and 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.599
 here you can leave it as it is or 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:10.400
 if you do not like me leave everything 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:10.400
 as I have here also put everything 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:21.090
 Here now here so well here you can put 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:24.780
 I will put the default shaft and here you are 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:26.660
 best settings you don't go in and what 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:29.460
 there are very difficult settings 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:35.729
 glow is not even indicated in the description so 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:42.479
 Well, in principle, sitges can still be 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:45.070
 here but it is not much more accurate at all 

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:53.710
 this memory allocation is basically in 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:55.870
 Mostly your on game and in this I advise 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:58.360
 become by standards the most important thing is 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:00.550
 was in rendering so thanks everyone 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:06.150
 for watching who could put it 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:06.150
 Like, thank you all 

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:03.459
 the escape
