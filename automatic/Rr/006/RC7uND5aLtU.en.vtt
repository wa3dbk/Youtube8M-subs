00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:44.299 
upgrades that was the Frog upgrade which

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:47.020 
upgrades that was the Frog upgrade which
is<00:01:44.539> not<00:01:45.470> a<00:01:45.500> very<00:01:45.740> useful<00:01:45.890> armor<00:01:46.430> it's<00:01:46.579> only

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
is not a very useful armor it's only

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.200 
is not a very useful armor it's only
used<00:01:47.240> in<00:01:47.420> like<00:01:47.720> two<00:01:47.960> locations<00:01:49.149> even<00:01:50.149> though

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
used in like two locations even though

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:51.370 
used in like two locations even though
we<00:01:50.330> have<00:01:50.450> the<00:01:50.539> upgrade<00:01:50.869> we<00:01:50.990> want<00:01:51.170> to<00:01:51.229> actually

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
we have the upgrade we want to actually

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.050 
we have the upgrade we want to actually
be<00:01:51.560> able<00:01:51.590> to<00:01:51.740> use<00:01:51.890> the<00:01:52.009> platforms<00:01:52.580> like<00:01:52.700> I<00:01:52.850> said

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
be able to use the platforms like I said

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:54.940 
be able to use the platforms like I said
earlier<00:01:53.090> until<00:01:53.840> we<00:01:53.899> get<00:01:54.049> the<00:01:54.140> chimera<00:01:54.500> armor

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
earlier until we get the chimera armor

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:22.500 
earlier until we get the chimera armor
so

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.869 

I<00:02:22.569> think<00:02:23.319> this<00:02:23.470> stage<00:02:23.769> is<00:02:24.159> actually<00:02:24.640> a<00:02:24.670> pretty

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:24.879 
I think this stage is actually a pretty

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:26.550 
I think this stage is actually a pretty
good<00:02:24.970> stage<00:02:25.420> to<00:02:25.659> come<00:02:25.810> back<00:02:25.989> to<00:02:26.140> later<00:02:26.260> when

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
good stage to come back to later when

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.759 
good stage to come back to later when
you<00:02:26.650> in<00:02:26.950> order<00:02:27.159> to<00:02:27.900> fill<00:02:28.900> up<00:02:29.019> your<00:02:29.049> sub<00:02:29.379> tanks

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:29.769 
you in order to fill up your sub tanks

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:32.910 
you in order to fill up your sub tanks
because<00:02:30.579> as<00:02:30.790> you<00:02:30.909> see<00:02:31.180> there<00:02:32.079> are<00:02:32.409> quite<00:02:32.769> a<00:02:32.829> few

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
because as you see there are quite a few

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.220 
because as you see there are quite a few
number<00:02:33.370> of<00:02:33.400> pellets<00:02:34.239> just<00:02:34.629> sort<00:02:34.840> of<00:02:34.900> lying

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
number of pellets just sort of lying

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:41.789 
number of pellets just sort of lying
about<00:02:35.379> that<00:02:37.560> you<00:02:38.560> can<00:02:38.739> get<00:02:39.370> and<00:02:40.560> when<00:02:41.560> you<00:02:41.650> come

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:41.799 
about that you can get and when you come

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:43.729 
about that you can get and when you come
back<00:02:41.829> to<00:02:42.069> the<00:02:42.190> later<00:02:42.340> stage<00:02:42.610> the<00:02:42.970> enemies<00:02:43.299> are

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
back to the later stage the enemies are

00:02:43.739 --> 00:03:01.460 
back to the later stage the enemies are
significantly<00:02:44.909> not<00:02:45.909> as<00:02:46.269> difficult<00:02:46.659> so

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.380 

now<00:03:02.100> here<00:03:02.430> I'm<00:03:02.520> just<00:03:02.550> showing<00:03:02.850> you<00:03:03.030> that<00:03:03.150> if

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
now here I'm just showing you that if

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.290 
now here I'm just showing you that if
you<00:03:03.480> climb<00:03:03.660> this<00:03:03.840> wall<00:03:04.110> you<00:03:05.010> can<00:03:05.310> come<00:03:06.060> to<00:03:06.180> one

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
you climb this wall you can come to one

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.210 
you climb this wall you can come to one
of<00:03:06.330> these<00:03:06.480> platforms<00:03:06.780> but<00:03:07.320> obviously<00:03:07.770> I<00:03:07.890> I

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
of these platforms but obviously I I

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.390 
of these platforms but obviously I I
can't<00:03:08.640> use<00:03:08.790> it<00:03:08.940> yet<00:03:09.090> because<00:03:09.210> i<00:03:09.360> don't<00:03:09.540> have

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
can't use it yet because i don't have

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:19.390 
can't use it yet because i don't have
the<00:03:11.400> appropriate<00:03:11.580> armor

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.340 

you

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.350 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:04:01.710 

you

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.720 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.700 

and<00:04:02.320> we're<00:04:02.530> already<00:04:02.740> here<00:04:03.480> so<00:04:04.480> gravity<00:04:05.380> beetle

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:05.710 
and we're already here so gravity beetle

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:08.550 
and we're already here so gravity beetle
this<00:04:06.310> guy<00:04:06.520> is<00:04:06.630> incredibly<00:04:07.630> simple<00:04:07.870> because<00:04:08.260> we

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
this guy is incredibly simple because we

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.190 
this guy is incredibly simple because we
actually<00:04:08.890> have<00:04:09.100> his<00:04:09.310> weakness<00:04:09.760> and<00:04:10.060> I<00:04:10.960> don't

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
actually have his weakness and I don't

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.870 
actually have his weakness and I don't
