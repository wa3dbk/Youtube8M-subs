00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:45.120 
down and then a good practice thing is
to<00:05:37.840> do<00:05:37.990> this<00:05:42.750> if<00:05:43.750> your<00:05:44.140> regular<00:05:44.590> you<00:05:44.770> take<00:05:44.979> your

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:45.130 
to do this if your regular you take your

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:48.060 
to do this if your regular you take your
left<00:05:45.310> foot<00:05:45.550> off<00:05:45.669> if<00:05:46.300> you're<00:05:47.140> goofy<00:05:47.770> you<00:05:47.860> take

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:48.070 
left foot off if you're goofy you take

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:52.679 
left foot off if you're goofy you take
your<00:05:48.220> right<00:05:48.400> foot<00:05:48.430> off<00:05:48.820> if<00:05:49.600> your<00:05:50.350> ski<00:05:51.270> you<00:05:52.270> just

00:05:52.679 --> 00:05:52.689 
your right foot off if your ski you just

00:05:52.689 --> 00:05:56.459 
your right foot off if your ski you just
so<00:05:53.499> if<00:05:54.219> you<00:05:54.399> flick<00:05:54.639> to<00:05:54.759> the<00:05:54.789> right<00:05:55.319> then<00:05:56.319> you're

00:05:56.459 --> 00:05:56.469 
so if you flick to the right then you're

00:05:56.469 --> 00:06:00.449 
so if you flick to the right then you're
wanting<00:05:56.739> to<00:05:56.830> take<00:05:57.159> your<00:05:57.369> right<00:05:58.360> foot<00:05:59.099> if<00:06:00.099> you

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:02.679 
flick to the left here we go up it off

00:06:02.679 --> 00:06:07.859 
flick to the left here we go up it off
because<00:06:02.919> I'm<00:06:04.199> okay<00:06:05.759> but<00:06:06.759> since<00:06:07.569> i<00:06:07.659> read

00:06:07.859 --> 00:06:07.869 
because I'm okay but since i read

00:06:07.869 --> 00:06:10.859 
because I'm okay but since i read
regular<00:06:08.319> i'm<00:06:08.469> taking<00:06:08.860> my<00:06:08.979> left<00:06:09.189> it<00:06:09.309> off<00:06:09.779> so<00:06:10.779> you

00:06:10.859 --> 00:06:10.869 
regular i'm taking my left it off so you

00:06:10.869 --> 00:06:17.009 
regular i'm taking my left it off so you
take<00:06:11.079> your<00:06:11.229> front<00:06:11.589> foot<00:06:11.649> off<00:06:14.099> flick<00:06:15.099> back<00:06:16.019> and

take your front foot off flick back and
spin<00:06:17.499> your<00:06:17.619> hands<00:06:18.009> and<00:06:18.599> catch<00:06:19.599> and<00:06:20.409> go<00:06:21.159> down<00:06:21.839> so

00:06:22.829 --> 00:06:22.839 
spin your hands and catch and go down so

00:06:22.839 --> 00:06:30.769 
spin your hands and catch and go down so
this<00:06:23.079> is<00:06:23.229> what<00:06:23.439> the<00:06:23.619> practice<00:06:24.189> looks<00:06:24.579> like

00:06:30.769 --> 00:06:30.779 

00:06:30.779 --> 00:06:34.649 

okay<00:06:32.249> so<00:06:33.249> once<00:06:33.789> you<00:06:33.909> get<00:06:33.999> that<00:06:34.179> done<00:06:34.419> and<00:06:34.569> you

00:06:34.649 --> 00:06:34.659 
okay so once you get that done and you

00:06:34.659 --> 00:06:36.209 
okay so once you get that done and you
can<00:06:34.809> like<00:06:34.899> land<00:06:35.169> it<00:06:35.289> every<00:06:35.499> single<00:06:35.649> time<00:06:35.769> and

00:06:36.209 --> 00:06:36.219 
can like land it every single time and

00:06:36.219 --> 00:06:40.619 
can like land it every single time and
