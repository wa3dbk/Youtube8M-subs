00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
for those you didn't know during the

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.430 
for those you didn't know during the
after<00:02:13.850> the<00:02:13.940> balance<00:02:14.120> patch<00:02:14.390> scorpion<00:02:15.080> was

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
after the balance patch scorpion was

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.160 
after the balance patch scorpion was
actually<00:02:16.160> moved<00:02:16.400> to<00:02:16.940> the<00:02:17.090> villain<00:02:17.390> side<00:02:17.540> so

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
actually moved to the villain side so

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.830 
actually moved to the villain side so
that's<00:02:18.320> very<00:02:18.380> interesting<00:02:18.680> but<00:02:19.489> um<00:02:19.700> yeah<00:02:20.630> so<00:02:20.660> I

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
that's very interesting but um yeah so I

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:21.910 
that's very interesting but um yeah so I
think<00:02:20.959> they're<00:02:21.200> just<00:02:21.320> going<00:02:21.440> to<00:02:21.530> announce<00:02:21.739> the

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
think they're just going to announce the
