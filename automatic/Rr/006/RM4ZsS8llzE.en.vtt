rosacea or things like that
now<00:00:20.130> I<00:00:20.160> thought<00:00:20.670> as<00:00:21.630> a<00:00:21.689> starting<00:00:22.199> point<00:00:22.500> I

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
now I thought as a starting point I

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.880 
now I thought as a starting point I
would<00:00:23.039> talk<00:00:23.789> about<00:00:23.820> how<00:00:24.449> I<00:00:24.480> came<00:00:24.810> to<00:00:25.560> discover

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
would talk about how I came to discover

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.089 
would talk about how I came to discover
my<00:00:26.609> triggers<00:00:27.090> for<00:00:27.359> my<00:00:27.539> eczema<00:00:28.080> and<00:00:28.289> my

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
my triggers for my eczema and my

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.130 
my triggers for my eczema and my
allergies<00:00:29.449> not<00:00:30.449> because<00:00:30.750> I<00:00:30.779> think<00:00:30.900> that

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
allergies not because I think that

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.209 
allergies not because I think that
everyone<00:00:31.679> is<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:31.830> same

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
everyone is the same

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.310 
everyone is the same
everybody<00:00:33.090> skin's<00:00:33.480> different<00:00:34.020> and

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
everybody skin's different and

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.780 
everybody skin's different and
everybody's<00:00:34.829> triggers<00:00:35.190> will<00:00:35.309> be<00:00:35.430> completely

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
everybody's triggers will be completely

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.080 
everybody's triggers will be completely
different<00:00:36.210> but<00:00:37.020> just<00:00:37.290> because<00:00:37.649> I<00:00:37.950> wanted<00:00:38.820> to

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090

show<00:00:39.540> that<00:00:40.040> you<00:00:41.040> can<00:00:41.250> discover<00:00:41.640> what<00:00:41.850> they<00:00:42.000> are

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
show that you can discover what they are

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.229 
show that you can discover what they are
it<00:00:42.390> just<00:00:42.570> takes<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:42.899> bit<00:00:42.930> of<00:00:43.050> time<00:00:43.170> and

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239 
it just takes a bit of time and

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:46.310 
it just takes a bit of time and
perseverance<00:00:45.239> methods<00:00:45.690> of<00:00:45.780> perseverance

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320

why I can use a forty five cream I was

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:28.830 
why I can use a forty five cream I was

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
why I couldn't use anything that was

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.680 
why I couldn't use anything that was
scented<00:02:30.340> and<00:02:30.550> that<00:02:31.060> didn't<00:02:31.330> matter<00:02:31.450> whether

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
scented and that didn't matter whether

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.110 
scented and that didn't matter whether
it<00:02:31.930> was<00:02:31.959> a<00:02:32.319> natural<00:02:32.620> fragrance<00:02:33.340> like<00:02:33.610> rose<00:02:33.910> oil

it was a natural fragrance like rose oil
or<00:02:34.510> lavender<00:02:34.599> oil<00:02:35.019> so<00:02:35.349> natural<00:02:36.280> soaps<00:02:36.519> would

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
or lavender oil so natural soaps would

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.610 
or lavender oil so natural soaps would
cause<00:02:38.709> just<00:02:38.920> as<00:02:39.010> much<00:02:39.069> problem<00:02:39.940> as<00:02:40.620> the

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
cause just as much problem as the

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.000

sensitive<00:03:29.350> skin<00:03:29.560> ones<00:03:29.769> too<00:03:29.980> and<00:03:30.010> it<00:03:30.220> has<00:03:30.310> the

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
sensitive skin ones too and it has the

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.840 
sensitive skin ones too and it has the
same<00:03:30.549> effect<00:03:30.940> so<00:03:31.350> that<00:03:32.350> really<00:03:32.590> helps<00:03:33.069> to<00:03:33.639> know

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:33.850 
same effect so that really helps to know

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.180 
same effect so that really helps to know
that<00:03:33.880> I<00:03:34.150> had<00:03:34.630> these<00:03:34.780> particular<00:03:35.200> triggers<00:03:35.889> so

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
that I had these particular triggers so

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.250 
that I had these particular triggers so
I<00:03:36.400> could<00:03:36.790> avoid<00:03:36.880> things<00:03:37.299> that<00:03:37.480> were<00:03:37.569> scented<00:03:38.049> I

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
I could avoid things that were scented I

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.259 
I could avoid things that were scented I
could<00:03:38.739> avoid<00:03:38.950> things<00:03:39.310> that<00:03:39.459> had<00:03:39.609> lanolin<00:03:40.060> in

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:40.269 
could avoid things that had lanolin in

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:44.220 
could avoid things that had lanolin in
and<00:03:41.250> that<00:03:42.250> really<00:03:42.489> really<00:03:42.670> helped<00:03:43.180> until<00:03:44.170> I

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
and that really really helped until I

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.740 
and that really really helped until I
got<00:03:44.530> to<00:03:44.980> being<00:03:45.280> a<00:03:45.400> teenager<00:03:45.940> and<00:03:46.180> I<00:03:46.389> got<00:03:46.540> really

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
got to being a teenager and I got really

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.960 
got to being a teenager and I got really
interested<00:03:46.930> in<00:03:47.230> makeup<00:03:47.620> and<00:03:48.340> I<00:03:48.430> found<00:03:48.700> that

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
interested in makeup and I found that

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.860 
interested in makeup and I found that
although<00:03:49.359> I<00:03:49.510> could<00:03:49.780> wear<00:03:49.959> most<00:03:50.200> mascaras<00:03:50.859> I

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
although I could wear most mascaras I

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.530 
although I could wear most mascaras I
had<00:03:52.870> real<00:03:53.139> problems<00:03:53.680> with<00:03:54.450> things<00:03:55.450> like

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
had real problems with things like

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.979 
had real problems with things like
blushes<00:03:56.109> and<00:03:56.230> lipsticks<00:03:56.709> I<00:03:57.989> effectively

00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:58.989 
blushes and lipsticks I effectively

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:00.690 
blushes and lipsticks I effectively
couldn't<00:03:59.290> wear<00:03:59.470> a<00:03:59.500> blush<00:03:59.950> or<00:04:00.190> a<00:04:00.280> lipstick

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
couldn't wear a blush or a lipstick

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.520 
couldn't wear a blush or a lipstick
without<00:04:00.880> them<00:04:01.329> for<00:04:01.660> two<00:04:01.810> weeks<00:04:01.989> afterwards

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
without them for two weeks afterwards

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.360 
without them for two weeks afterwards
having<00:04:02.739> big<00:04:03.579> newsy<00:04:04.120> red<00:04:04.389> patches<00:04:05.160> so<00:04:06.160> I<00:04:06.190> used

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370 
having big newsy red patches so I used

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.370 
having big newsy red patches so I used
to<00:04:06.430> avoid<00:04:06.519> it<00:04:06.940> and<00:04:07.810> I<00:04:07.930> did<00:04:08.079> think<00:04:08.319> that

to avoid it and I did think that

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:09.900 
to avoid it and I did think that
possibly<00:04:08.620> it<00:04:08.980> was<00:04:09.099> because<00:04:09.400> of<00:04:09.430> the<00:04:09.549> products

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:09.910

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:12.629 
possibly it was because of the products
that<00:04:10.000> I<00:04:10.090> were<00:04:10.329> buying<00:04:10.950> you<00:04:11.950> know<00:04:12.069> high<00:04:12.310> street

looked at their ingredients list they
all<00:05:49.060> contained<00:05:49.660> carmine<00:05:50.580> so<00:05:51.580> this<00:05:52.020> made<00:05:53.020> me

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:53.200 
all contained carmine so this made me

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:55.700 
all contained carmine so this made me
very<00:05:53.410> interested<00:05:53.440> in<00:05:53.950> what<00:05:54.250> carmine<00:05:54.760> was<00:05:54.970> and

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:55.710 
very interested in what carmine was and

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:57.810 
very interested in what carmine was and
after<00:05:56.710> a<00:05:56.770> bit<00:05:56.919> more<00:05:57.099> research<00:05:57.430> I<00:05:57.639> discovered

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:57.820 
after a bit more research I discovered

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:00.120 
after a bit more research I discovered
that<00:05:58.210> it<00:05:58.419> is<00:05:58.750> the<00:05:59.080> Contra<00:05:59.470> meal<00:05:59.620> beetle

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:00.130
