two of them I find particularly

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.319 
two of them I find particularly
effective<00:01:01.700> I<00:01:01.820> think<00:01:02.000> there's<00:01:02.150> something

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:02.329 
effective I think there's something

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:05.410 
effective I think there's something
immensely<00:01:02.870> beautiful<00:01:03.470> about<00:01:03.650> bringing<00:01:04.420> very

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420

beautifully composed images and then a

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.220 
beautifully composed images and then a
