folder<00:00:42.710> if<00:00:43.460> you're<00:00:43.700> htdocs<00:00:44.270> folder<00:00:44.390> is<00:00:44.810> going

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 
folder if you're htdocs folder is going

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.319 
folder if you're htdocs folder is going
to<00:00:45.020> be<00:00:45.140> public<00:00:45.770> you<00:00:46.340> might<00:00:46.550> not<00:00:46.640> have<00:00:46.790> figure

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:47.329 
to be public you might not have figure

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:49.299 
to be public you might not have figure
out<00:00:47.450> another<00:00:47.600> way<00:00:47.810> to<00:00:47.960> do<00:00:48.170> this<00:00:48.380> probably

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:49.309 
out another way to do this probably

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:53.799 
out another way to do this probably
using<00:00:49.790> the<00:00:50.329> virtual<00:00:50.720> host<00:00:51.200> or<00:00:51.470> v<00:00:51.590> host<00:00:52.120> i<00:00:53.120> would

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809 
using the virtual host or v host i would

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:55.360 
using the virtual host or v host i would
recommend<00:00:53.899> using<00:00:54.440> another<00:00:54.770> folder<00:00:55.190> for<00:00:55.340> your

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
recommend using another folder for your

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.220 
recommend using another folder for your
public<00:00:55.760> folder<00:00:55.940> another<00:00:56.329> in<00:00:56.510> your<00:00:56.630> HD<00:00:56.989> docks

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.230 
public folder another in your HD docks

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.860 
public folder another in your HD docks
i'm<00:00:58.130> not<00:00:58.340> sure<00:00:58.550> how<00:00:58.700> secure<00:00:59.120> this<00:00:59.270> is<00:00:59.540> but<00:00:59.750> it

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
i'm not sure how secure this is but it

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.160 
i'm not sure how secure this is but it
could<00:01:00.050> be<00:01:00.520> potential<00:01:01.520> security<00:01:01.880> risk<00:01:02.300> some

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
could be potential security risk some

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.630 
could be potential security risk some
will<00:01:03.290> go<00:01:03.410> ahead<00:01:03.500> and<00:01:03.739> paste<00:01:04.040> that<00:01:04.189> right<00:01:04.519> there

you<00:01:07.640> can<00:01:07.790> also<00:01:07.939> probably<00:01:08.299> use<00:01:08.600> HT<00:01:09.170> access<00:01:09.709> an

00:01:10.169 --> 00:01:10.179 
you can also probably use HT access an

00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:14.699 
you can also probably use HT access an
HT<00:01:11.179> password<00:01:11.689> to<00:01:11.959> help<00:01:12.439> further<00:01:12.709> protect<00:01:13.219> this

00:01:14.699 --> 00:01:14.709 
HT password to help further protect this
