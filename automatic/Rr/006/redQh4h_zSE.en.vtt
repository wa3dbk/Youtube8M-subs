00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:15.690 
same position as though you are still

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.080 
same position as though you are still
holding<00:01:16.050> it<00:01:16.170> now<00:01:17.070> just<00:01:17.340> put<00:01:17.520> your<00:01:17.550> hand<00:01:17.910> down

holding it now just put your hand down

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:24.560 
holding it now just put your hand down
here<00:01:20.090> gently<00:01:21.090> clamp<00:01:21.360> down<00:01:23.180> you<00:01:24.180> notice<00:01:24.420> that

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
here gently clamp down you notice that

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.620 
here gently clamp down you notice that
the<00:01:25.050> thumb<00:01:25.229> is<00:01:25.410> a<00:01:25.440> little<00:01:25.740> bit<00:01:25.860> off<00:01:26.009> center<00:01:26.280> of

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
the thumb is a little bit off center of

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.260 
the thumb is a little bit off center of
the<00:01:27.630> neck<00:01:27.840> itself<00:01:28.460> it's<00:01:29.460> just<00:01:29.850> enough<00:01:30.060> so<00:01:30.210> you

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
the neck itself it's just enough so you

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.660 
the neck itself it's just enough so you
have<00:01:30.450> a<00:01:30.479> comfortable<00:01:31.170> grip<00:01:31.380> my<00:01:32.190> fingers<00:01:32.550> are

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
have a comfortable grip my fingers are

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.260 
have a comfortable grip my fingers are
almost<00:01:33.030> parallel<00:01:33.810> to<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.350> frats<00:01:35.270> nothing

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
almost parallel to the frats nothing

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.150 
almost parallel to the frats nothing
like<00:01:36.450> this<00:01:36.569> nothing<00:01:36.990> like<00:01:37.140> this<00:01:37.289> now<00:01:38.039> we're

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:38.160 
like this nothing like this now we're

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.410 
like this nothing like this now we're
going<00:01:38.250> to<00:01:38.310> move<00:01:38.399> on<00:01:38.550> to<00:01:38.580> the<00:01:38.700> next<00:01:38.940> part<00:01:39.179> of

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
going to move on to the next part of

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.999 
going to move on to the next part of
what<00:01:39.630> your<00:01:39.780> hand<00:01:39.959> wants<00:01:40.229> to<00:01:40.319> look<00:01:40.440> like<00:01:40.500> if<00:01:40.800> you

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
what your hand wants to look like if you

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.100 
what your hand wants to look like if you
really<00:01:41.399> think<00:01:41.610> about<00:01:41.759> it<00:01:42.119> you<00:01:42.690> don't<00:01:42.840> want<00:01:43.050> to

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
really think about it you don't want to

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.859 
really think about it you don't want to
get<00:01:43.259> back<00:01:43.410> here<00:01:44.090> but<00:01:45.090> you<00:01:45.119> don't<00:01:45.300> want<00:01:45.660> to<00:01:45.750> too

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
get back here but you don't want to too

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.650 
get back here but you don't want to too
far<00:01:46.110> away<00:01:46.200> so<00:01:46.619> here's<00:01:47.399> how<00:01:47.580> you<00:01:47.640> solve<00:01:48.060> the

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:48.660 
far away so here's how you solve the

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.870 
far away so here's how you solve the
problem<00:01:49.140> how<00:01:49.170> do<00:01:49.440> you<00:01:49.560> how<00:01:50.190> do<00:01:50.250> we<00:01:50.399> get<00:01:50.700> your

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
problem how do you how do we get your

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.809 
problem how do you how do we get your
hand<00:01:51.300> to<00:01:52.200> be<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.380> right<00:01:52.530> distance<00:01:53.009> here<00:01:53.520> well

00:01:53.809 --> 00:01:53.819 
hand to be the right distance here well

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:55.609 
hand to be the right distance here well
simple<00:01:54.479> solution<00:01:54.840> to<00:01:54.869> that<00:01:55.020> if<00:01:55.200> you<00:01:55.380> take<00:01:55.560> a

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
simple solution to that if you take a

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.490 
simple solution to that if you take a
look<00:01:55.830> right<00:01:56.069> here<00:01:56.970> if<00:01:57.119> you<00:01:58.020> can<00:01:58.170> put<00:01:58.410> about

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
look right here if you can put about

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.290 
look right here if you can put about
that<00:01:58.800> much<00:01:58.860> of<00:01:59.340> your<00:01:59.640> index<00:01:59.940> finger

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:00.300 
that much of your index finger

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.520 
that much of your index finger
underneath<00:02:01.020> of<00:02:01.259> your<00:02:01.860> hand<00:02:02.280> and<00:02:03.319> there's<00:02:04.319> just

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
underneath of your hand and there's just

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.639 
underneath of your hand and there's just
a<00:02:04.619> little<00:02:04.890> bit<00:02:05.069> left<00:02:05.550> over<00:02:05.910> here<00:02:06.300> that<00:02:07.200> doesn't

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
a little bit left over here that doesn't

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.499 
a little bit left over here that doesn't
touch<00:02:07.950> down<00:02:08.610> here<00:02:08.880> on<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.060> other<00:02:09.149> side<00:02:09.270> of<00:02:09.420> the

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
touch down here on the other side of the

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.080 
touch down here on the other side of the
fretboard<00:02:09.860> you<00:02:10.860> don't<00:02:11.009> want<00:02:11.130> that<00:02:11.280> you<00:02:12.030> want

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
fretboard you don't want that you want

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.360 
fretboard you don't want that you want
just<00:02:12.239> enough<00:02:12.450> away<00:02:12.870> so<00:02:13.739> you<00:02:13.830> can<00:02:13.950> still<00:02:14.160> do<00:02:14.280> the

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
just enough away so you can still do the

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.220 
just enough away so you can still do the
finger<00:02:14.640> like<00:02:14.849> this<00:02:17.569> that<00:02:18.569> will<00:02:18.930> give<00:02:19.110> you

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
finger like this that will give you

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.410 
finger like this that will give you
perfect<00:02:19.500> hand<00:02:19.890> positioning<00:02:20.400> to<00:02:21.060> play<00:02:21.360> overall

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
perfect hand positioning to play overall
