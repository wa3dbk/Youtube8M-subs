00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.689
 please diploma 

00:00:01.689 --> 00:00:05.890
 after the numerous controversies about the new road system at 

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:09.900
 leonardo da vinci to finished work we met the manager 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.459
 adr commercial for a budget has collected for us his statements 

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:18.220
 francesca from the mass media 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:23.169
 last 10 May there was talk of a radical change coming 

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:27.699
 the protagonist of the Leonardo da Vinci airport, you win the traffic in the line immediately 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:32.089
 in fact, a new structure has been completed for the completion of the new one 

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:35.899
 viability the roman airport we met just yesterday director 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:39.000
 commerciale the dr marco treggiari 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.020
 traffic flows in the area immediately undergo major changes such as i 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.609
 work has been done 

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:48.519
 the first message we like to share with you and we have 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:49.789
 commitments fulfilled 

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:54.039
 we had said that by the end of June the air arrives at the airport 

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:57.530
 leonardo da vinci would present himself in a new guise 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.190
 a down promised 260 seats 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.720
 divided among peers to international domestic 20 terminals a 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.660
 tv1 &amp; lt 3 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:11.840
 these like 60 seats are now available to passengers 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.060
 and I would say this 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:18.190
 among the 8 cornerstones that we had shared with you too, I would say that 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:20.390
 I v the king of the cornerstones 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.130
 but 270 turtle parking spaces or one the terminal which are sufficient 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.120
 the car parks to date are sufficient 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.080
 but this will be very related to the intelligence of those approaching and 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.700
 black port not to come two hours earlier 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.040
 he knows that for half an hour you will not pay 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.880
 and they are learning to use this new service but we kept the 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.690
 reserve especially high 3 we have the possibility to go from 180 pakstall 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.800
 probably add a hundred more 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.130
 and we also have your reserve 1 high we have the possibility if it were 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.340
 necessary d 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.130
 also make the raised floor available 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.850
 however, we come to an important fundamental question for all these jobs 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.659
 they were made right now 

00:02:09.659 --> 00:02:14.960
 the situation we presented to our customers was unseemly 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.769
 what factor if not the traffic 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:22.349
 the first the first impression that was said coming to the airport was that 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:27.049
 one receives true these cubic meters of steel that blocked the accesses 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:31.189
 so it was done right now because we decided to do a 

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:35.669
 important investment investment for you will remember is around two million 

00:02:35.669 --> 00:02:36.519
 of Euro 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:37.859
 and today we are 

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:42.739
 I would say almost proud to be able to see the clean primary roads 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:48.189
 dedicated to the operators and dedicated the airport uses it 

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:53.129
 the secondary roads have been rationalized dedicated to Haiti 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:58.610
 but it's not over here agena will begin the works on the departures side considered on - 

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:00.380
 critical of the sea arrivals 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.700
 for spring 2012 the Leonardo da Vinci viability should be 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.900
 completed at the airport so prepare for new changes
