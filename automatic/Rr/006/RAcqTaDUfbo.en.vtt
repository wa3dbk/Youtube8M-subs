not exist anymore I disagree with that
it<00:01:15.770> that<00:01:16.310> still<00:01:16.580> exists<00:01:17.060> but<00:01:17.479> it<00:01:17.600> is<00:01:17.720> different

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
it that still exists but it is different

than before years ago 1v1 defending was
played<00:01:21.710> all<00:01:21.950> over<00:01:22.009> the<00:01:22.490> field<00:01:22.759> and<00:01:23.300> it<00:01:23.390> always

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
played all over the field and it always

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.370 
played all over the field and it always
stayed<00:01:24.080> a<00:01:24.320> 1v1<00:01:24.850> situation<00:01:25.850> today<00:01:26.210> these<00:01:26.840> 1v1

stayed a 1v1 situation today these 1v1
defending<00:01:28.009> situations<00:01:28.610> more<00:01:29.149> likely<00:01:29.630> become

defending situations more likely become

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.889 
defending situations more likely become
2v1<00:01:30.770> situations<00:01:31.580> it<00:01:31.970> really<00:01:32.240> depends<00:01:32.690> on<00:01:32.810> the

00:01:32.889 --> 00:01:32.899 
2v1 situations it really depends on the

concept of doubling up some don't we

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:40.419 
concept of doubling up some don't we
will<00:01:38.060> discuss<00:01:38.390> this<00:01:38.570> later<00:01:38.630> on<00:01:38.899> however<00:01:39.890> the

00:01:40.419 --> 00:01:40.429 
will discuss this later on however the

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:43.539 
will discuss this later on however the

concept of one felony defending is still

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:45.850 
concept of one felony defending is still
a<00:01:43.580> very<00:01:43.909> important<00:01:44.659> foundation<00:01:45.409> for<00:01:45.710> so

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 
a very important foundation for so

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.010 
a very important foundation for so

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
defending that's our topic here we're

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:49.929 
defending that's our topic here we're
still<00:01:48.290> concentrating<00:01:49.070> on<00:01:49.159> the<00:01:49.310> introduction

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:49.939

concept of zonal defending that's

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:00.399 
concept of zonal defending that's
important<00:01:58.579> and<00:01:58.700> a<00:01:59.060> coach<00:01:59.270> should<00:01:59.299> focus<00:02:00.110> on

of view in our licensing courses a coach

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.259

should consider how certain situations
occur<00:02:14.930> in<00:02:15.079> a<00:02:15.140> game<00:02:15.320> and<00:02:15.620> which<00:02:16.160> one<00:02:16.610> we<00:02:16.760> want<00:02:16.790> in
