00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.050 
pear tree now you think that in a game

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.200 
pear tree now you think that in a game
like<00:00:56.170> this<00:00:56.229> you'd<00:00:56.949> have<00:00:57.100> some<00:00:57.340> freedom<00:00:57.609> like

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210 
like this you'd have some freedom like

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:59.639 
like this you'd have some freedom like
in<00:00:58.329> skate<00:00:58.600> or<00:00:58.750> die<00:00:58.899> how<00:00:59.140> you<00:00:59.199> can<00:00:59.379> have<00:00:59.500> up<00:00:59.590> to

00:00:59.639 --> 00:00:59.649 
in skate or die how you can have up to

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:01.259 
in skate or die how you can have up to
eight<00:00:59.769> players<00:01:00.010> compete<00:01:00.609> go<00:01:00.969> to<00:01:01.030> whatever

00:01:01.259 --> 00:01:01.269 
eight players compete go to whatever

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:03.329 
eight players compete go to whatever
event<00:01:01.660> you<00:01:01.750> wanted<00:01:02.140> and<00:01:02.350> see<00:01:02.800> who<00:01:02.980> can<00:01:03.100> get<00:01:03.219> the

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:03.339 
event you wanted and see who can get the

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:05.400 
event you wanted and see who can get the
highest<00:01:03.489> score<00:01:04.080> certainly<00:01:05.080> there'd<00:01:05.289> be

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:05.410 
highest score certainly there'd be

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:06.870 
highest score certainly there'd be
something<00:01:05.649> like<00:01:05.920> this<00:01:06.100> and<00:01:06.369> a<00:01:06.429> snowboarding

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.880 
something like this and a snowboarding

something like this and a snowboarding
game<00:01:07.030> right<00:01:07.440> but<00:01:08.440> no<00:01:08.710> heavy<00:01:09.429> shredding

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860 
decides that not only is this game for

decides that not only is this game for
one<00:01:12.009> player<00:01:12.250> and<00:01:12.520> one<00:01:12.729> player<00:01:12.970> only<00:01:13.210> but<00:01:14.140> you

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
one player and one player only but you

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.719 
one player and one player only but you
have<00:01:14.350> to<00:01:14.470> complete<00:01:14.860> the<00:01:14.979> levels<00:01:15.280> in<00:01:15.429> a<00:01:15.550> rigid

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:15.729 
have to complete the levels in a rigid

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:17.249 
have to complete the levels in a rigid
order<00:01:16.179> like<00:01:16.330> in<00:01:16.450> a<00:01:16.539> side-scroller

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:17.259 
order like in a side-scroller

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:19.469

I<00:01:17.440> don't<00:01:18.280> know<00:01:18.369> about<00:01:18.550> you<00:01:18.729> but<00:01:19.000> I<00:01:19.060> think<00:01:19.360> that

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:19.479 
I don't know about you but I think that

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:21.330 
I don't know about you but I think that
that's<00:01:19.600> pretty<00:01:19.899> fucking<00:01:20.229> stupid<00:01:20.740> and

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
that's pretty fucking stupid and

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:22.740 
that's pretty fucking stupid and
although<00:01:21.640> the<00:01:21.880> events<00:01:22.210> are<00:01:22.330> different<00:01:22.690> from

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:22.750 
although the events are different from

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:24.389 
although the events are different from
each<00:01:22.899> other<00:01:23.170> they're<00:01:23.770> not<00:01:23.800> different<00:01:24.159> enough

00:01:24.389 --> 00:01:24.399 
each other they're not different enough

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:26.580 
each other they're not different enough
to<00:01:24.640> feel<00:01:25.030> rewarded<00:01:25.240> after<00:01:25.780> beating<00:01:26.140> a<00:01:26.319> level

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
to feel rewarded after beating a level

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.649 
to feel rewarded after beating a level
to<00:01:26.679> try<00:01:26.830> to<00:01:26.920> get<00:01:27.100> the<00:01:27.250> next<00:01:27.460> event<00:01:27.789> and<00:01:28.149> there

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:28.659 
to try to get the next event and there

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:30.270 
to try to get the next event and there
are<00:01:28.720> only<00:01:28.780> five<00:01:29.110> anyway<00:01:29.500> there's<00:01:29.770> just<00:01:29.920> 18

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
are only five anyway there's just 18

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.460 
are only five anyway there's just 18
different<00:01:30.430> variations<00:01:31.180> so<00:01:32.020> this<00:01:32.170> actually

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 
different variations so this actually

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:33.870 
different variations so this actually
sounds<00:01:32.619> more<00:01:32.890> like<00:01:32.920> an<00:01:33.100> Atari<00:01:33.399> game<00:01:33.700> than

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
sounds more like an Atari game than

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.569 
sounds more like an Atari game than
Nintendo<00:01:34.649> you<00:01:35.649> start<00:01:35.920> out<00:01:35.979> with<00:01:36.070> four<00:01:36.310> lives

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:36.579 
Nintendo you start out with four lives

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:38.100 
Nintendo you start out with four lives
and<00:01:36.909> you<00:01:37.030> lose<00:01:37.240> one<00:01:37.479> if<00:01:37.630> you<00:01:37.720> bump<00:01:37.990> into

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
and you lose one if you bump into

I mean shifting your direction is

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:02.910 
I mean shifting your direction is
responsive<00:02:01.630> enough<00:02:01.840> I<00:02:02.020> guess<00:02:02.259> but<00:02:02.799> the

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
responsive enough I guess but the

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.249 
responsive enough I guess but the
problem<00:02:03.340> is<00:02:03.520> it<00:02:03.939> takes<00:02:04.060> like<00:02:04.450> a<00:02:04.479> half<00:02:04.780> hour<00:02:05.049> to

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:05.259 
problem is it takes like a half hour to

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:06.959 
problem is it takes like a half hour to
move<00:02:05.439> in<00:02:05.590> that<00:02:05.680> direction<00:02:05.890> so<00:02:06.430> you<00:02:06.759> have<00:02:06.850> to

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:06.969 
move in that direction so you have to

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:08.580 
move in that direction so you have to
make<00:02:07.149> your<00:02:07.270> shifts<00:02:07.659> well<00:02:07.840> in<00:02:07.960> advance<00:02:08.289> which

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
make your shifts well in advance which

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:09.960 
make your shifts well in advance which
totally<00:02:09.009> reminds<00:02:09.280> me<00:02:09.459> of<00:02:09.549> the<00:02:09.640> control

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
totally reminds me of the control

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:11.550 
totally reminds me of the control
schemes<00:02:10.299> of<00:02:10.479> games<00:02:10.690> with<00:02:10.899> terribly<00:02:11.290> delayed

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
schemes of games with terribly delayed

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.099 
schemes of games with terribly delayed
controls<00:02:12.510> plus<00:02:13.510> you'll<00:02:13.690> automatically

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:14.109 
controls plus you'll automatically

00:02:14.109 --> 00:02:15.840 
controls plus you'll automatically
transition<00:02:14.709> between<00:02:14.859> the<00:02:15.100> downward<00:02:15.459> angle

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
transition between the downward angle

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:17.640 
transition between the downward angle
and<00:02:16.000> straight<00:02:16.630> ahead<00:02:16.780> which<00:02:17.170> can<00:02:17.350> totally

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
and straight ahead which can totally

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.080 
and straight ahead which can totally
fuck<00:02:17.890> you<00:02:18.010> up<00:02:18.040> if<00:02:18.250> you<00:02:18.340> don't<00:02:18.400> see<00:02:18.700> it<00:02:18.730> coming

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
fuck you up if you don't see it coming

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:20.069 
fuck you up if you don't see it coming

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
sound it produces there are some tricks

you can pull by jumping and pressing one

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:58.130 
you can pull by jumping and pressing one
of<00:02:56.940> the<00:02:57.000> respective<00:02:57.450> buttons<00:02:57.750> on<00:02:57.870> the<00:02:57.930> d-pad

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
of the respective buttons on the d-pad

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.070 
of the respective buttons on the d-pad
and<00:02:58.560> you<00:02:59.040> can<00:02:59.190> make<00:02:59.340> jumps<00:02:59.640> off<00:02:59.790> ramps<00:03:00.209> both<00:03:00.900> of

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
and you can make jumps off ramps both of

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.449 
and you can make jumps off ramps both of
these<00:03:01.140> techniques<00:03:01.500> can<00:03:01.620> get<00:03:01.830> you<00:03:01.920> some<00:03:02.069> points

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
these techniques can get you some points

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.340 
these techniques can get you some points
which<00:03:02.580> is<00:03:02.610> important<00:03:03.180> in<00:03:03.270> the<00:03:03.360> halfpipe<00:03:03.540> event

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
which is important in the halfpipe event

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.380 
which is important in the halfpipe event
speaking<00:03:05.280> of<00:03:05.370> the<00:03:05.459> events<00:03:05.850> let's<00:03:06.150> take<00:03:06.360> a

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
speaking of the events let's take a

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.150 
speaking of the events let's take a
quick<00:03:06.660> look<00:03:06.810> at<00:03:06.959> each<00:03:06.989> of<00:03:07.230> them<00:03:07.319> I'm<00:03:07.920> not<00:03:08.040> gonna

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
quick look at each of them I'm not gonna

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.949 
quick look at each of them I'm not gonna
go<00:03:08.310> through<00:03:08.489> all<00:03:08.580> 18<00:03:09.090> levels<00:03:09.300> cuz<00:03:09.660> I<00:03:09.690> mean

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
go through all 18 levels cuz I mean

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:10.970 
go through all 18 levels cuz I mean
what's<00:03:10.140> the<00:03:10.260> fucking<00:03:10.560> difference

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
what's the fucking difference

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.000 
what's the fucking difference
so<00:03:11.220> I'll<00:03:11.310> just<00:03:11.489> summarize<00:03:11.670> the<00:03:12.030> five<00:03:12.209> events

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
so I'll just summarize the five events

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.710 
so I'll just summarize the five events
first<00:03:14.010> one<00:03:14.250> is<00:03:14.340> the<00:03:14.519> downhill<00:03:14.970> your<00:03:15.330> goal<00:03:15.570> is

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
first one is the downhill your goal is

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:16.850 
first one is the downhill your goal is
to<00:03:15.750> get<00:03:15.930> to<00:03:15.989> the<00:03:16.140> finish<00:03:16.440> line<00:03:16.470> without

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
to get to the finish line without

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.680 
to get to the finish line without
hitting<00:03:17.190> anything<00:03:17.489> we<00:03:18.180> have<00:03:18.300> to<00:03:18.420> beat<00:03:18.570> the

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
hitting anything we have to beat the

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.660 
hitting anything we have to beat the
clock<00:03:18.870> too<00:03:19.200> which<00:03:20.040> makes<00:03:20.250> for<00:03:20.400> quite<00:03:20.640> the

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
clock too which makes for quite the

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.340 
clock too which makes for quite the
goddamn<00:03:21.180> dilemma<00:03:21.540> because<00:03:21.810> you<00:03:22.019> want<00:03:22.200> to<00:03:22.230> be

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
goddamn dilemma because you want to be

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.229 
goddamn dilemma because you want to be
going<00:03:22.470> fast<00:03:22.830> enough<00:03:23.130> to<00:03:23.250> be<00:03:23.340> the<00:03:23.489> timer<00:03:23.730> but

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
going fast enough to be the timer but

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.990 
going fast enough to be the timer but
slow<00:03:24.510> enough<00:03:24.750> to<00:03:24.810> avoid<00:03:25.110> obstacles<00:03:25.350> in<00:03:26.000> the

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
slow enough to avoid obstacles in the

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.580 
slow enough to avoid obstacles in the
slalom<00:03:27.269> you'll<00:03:27.690> have<00:03:27.840> to<00:03:27.989> split<00:03:28.200> the<00:03:28.380> gates

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
slalom you'll have to split the gates

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.350 
slalom you'll have to split the gates
while<00:03:28.800> attempting<00:03:29.069> to<00:03:29.280> avoid<00:03:29.610> shit<00:03:29.970> but

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
while attempting to avoid shit but

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.970 
while attempting to avoid shit but
there's<00:03:30.540> no<00:03:30.720> time<00:03:31.019> limit<00:03:31.170> so<00:03:31.500> you<00:03:31.560> can<00:03:31.739> crawl
