 backs to make big stops all 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.160
 they were duels of the best players of the 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.380
 world came together in this match and 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.790
 the occasions that came practically 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.129
 everywhere, that sense of 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.780
 rafael that was rubbing the stick and 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.280
 inter movistar that played very well on 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.309
 ball and made good triangulations 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.690
 rafa was the true hero of the 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.430
 first minutes of the game the 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.489
 first bars after the sense of 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.469
 the visiting team took them 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.570
 he also had his opportunities 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.309
 there is the well of Murcia and there it is 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.230
 that unbeatable opportunity of álex that 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.760
 it ends up stopping jesus herrera a 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.800
 party with all kinds of opportunities 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.329
 the two teams that make very good 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.339
 futsal although the victory 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.010
 finally he would end up carrying 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.010
 internal 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:11.410
 the goalkeepers good as few great 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:14.170
 quality in both goals both jesus 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:15.730
 blacksmith like rafa and the opportunities and 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.280
 the plays came from all the 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:20.950
 angles this good stop also in the 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.750
 that gets rafa in the other goal and 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.400
 the blackboard the inter movistar that went out to 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.310
 shine though the goal was slow to arrive 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.050
 He did not quite get the first goal and 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.560
 again I was going to get that shot from 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.750
 ortiz 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.760
 rafa with both legs and how could 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.710
 the cons of the visiting team the 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.480
 cons of the well and they will always end 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.790
 in the hands or on the feet like this 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:41.770
 type of adri de jesús blacksmith 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.080
 this opportunity was rubbing the stick 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.210
 he lamented here that he lamented 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.970
 Elpozo de Murcia goalkeeper and already in 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:51.640
 torn from inter movistar you could see the 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:54.640
 occasion to try to reach the goal that 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.200
 was going to be in a play like this one did not 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.820
 you lose it the play is not 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.070
 lose everything that makes rafa and not 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.470
 lose as the outside of the 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.600
 right leg of the right foot to 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.920
 score the goal and dedicate it to all the 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.290
 madrid box hobby 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.209
 there is the play as triangular as 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:12.550
 it ends up taking force and desire 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:14.410
 that ball and it ends up marking with it 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:18.160
 of the right foot the first goal of 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.720
 party was barely a minute away and something 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.180
 more so will this first part 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.760
 but the potential was of intermovistar 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.920
 and ended up closing ricardinho with that 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.960
 low shot that good left leg 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.670
 that the Portuguese has and how the 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:33.250
 rafa ball there is the repetition 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:36.010
 more powerful shot and as soon as the 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.900
 defense well and even rafa 20 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.580
 finished the first part with those 20 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.680
 first minutes was going to start the 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.720
 second part also with domain of the 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.000
 'green machine' with inter domain 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.310
 movistar that would be put up in the 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.080
 The scoreboard would take 8 minutes 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.720
 the second part to finish marking the 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.430
 30 ejection of álex also the one that 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.290
 He could see double yellow card and 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.620
 from there inter movistar dominated the 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.570
 match the minute goal of 28 minute battery and 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.700
 he put things very face-to-face he played with 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:06.190
 one minus the well of murcia and that is 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:09.190
 he noticed he recovered the fifth player the well 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:11.320
 but inter already dominated the game 30 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.180
 until he shortened team distances 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.520
 of the well of murcia in this occasion double 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.170
 occasion had to catch on his own 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:20.080
 reject what the suazo 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:22.510
 32 ended up scoring on the 31st the fans 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.370
 well some met in alcalá de 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.739
 in the cajamadrid pavilion and 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.720
 the bells tolled for that goal that 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:30.940
 first goal although it was not going to be 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.430
 enough to trace the game over 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.800
 occasions always dominating the team 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:38.140
 local always dominating the team of 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:40.360
 inter movistar although he played 5 he took 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.310
 many risks like for example in this 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.470
 point play was about to reach the goal 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.360
 neither the contra and from that 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:49.150
 moment inter movistar dominated and that 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:51.010
 powerful shot as few as the hit 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.560
 with the left leg battery 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:55.660
 got the 41 in the 37 doubt still 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.130
 I had some hope of trying to give 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:59.019
 the return to the game but there was no 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:01.900
 nothing to do without goalie without a rafa 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:04.600
 playing five rings put the 5-1 in 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.150
 the score at minute 38 good play 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.319
 against the battery and rivillos 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:11.410
 I was waiting at the far post to catch 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:13.000
 the reject and score the goal the 52 what 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:15.459
 marked rivillos but this time in own 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.680
 door and so will end the match with 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:19.690
 the victory of inter movistar that yes already 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.680
 he was not a leader he was going to be even more 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.680
 won inter to the well
