materials and I don't want to use all of

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.639 
materials and I don't want to use all of
them<00:01:47.610> all<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.240> colors<00:01:48.600> in<00:01:48.810> my<00:01:49.020> basket<00:01:49.500> because

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
them all the colors in my basket because

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.350 
them all the colors in my basket because
some<00:01:50.399> of<00:01:50.430> them<00:01:50.700> when<00:01:50.880> you<00:01:50.970> put<00:01:51.090> them<00:01:51.270> all

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
some of them when you put them all

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.569 
some of them when you put them all
together<00:01:51.509> will<00:01:51.960> make<00:01:52.140> brown<00:01:52.649> especially<00:01:53.520> if

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
together will make brown especially if

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:54.540 
together will make brown especially if
you<00:01:53.700> do

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:54.550 
you do

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.490 
you do
colors<00:01:55.360> that<00:01:55.540> are<00:01:55.630> across<00:01:55.900> the<00:01:56.050> color<00:01:56.230> world

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
colors that are across the color world

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.640 
colors that are across the color world
from<00:01:56.740> each<00:01:56.830> other<00:01:57.540> so<00:01:58.540> I'm<00:01:59.020> gonna<00:01:59.230> pick<00:01:59.410> some

00:01:59.640 --> 00:01:59.650 
from each other so I'm gonna pick some

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:01.950 
from each other so I'm gonna pick some
purples<00:02:00.040> and<00:02:00.250> some<00:02:00.550> red<00:02:00.760> and<00:02:01.090> some<00:02:01.180> whites

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
purples and some red and some whites

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.050 
purples and some red and some whites
just<00:02:02.680> to<00:02:02.800> lighten<00:02:03.010> up<00:02:03.160> the<00:02:03.340> color<00:02:03.580> because<00:02:03.970> I

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
just to lighten up the color because I

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.230 
just to lighten up the color because I
always<00:02:04.240> have<00:02:04.540> tons<00:02:05.050> of<00:02:05.410> white<00:02:05.740> paper<00:02:06.100> so<00:02:06.820> they

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
always have tons of white paper so they

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.700 
always have tons of white paper so they
need<00:02:07.420> to<00:02:07.450> be<00:02:07.540> in<00:02:07.690> smaller<00:02:08.020> pieces<00:02:08.320> these<00:02:08.650> are

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:08.710 
need to be in smaller pieces these are

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:11.160 
need to be in smaller pieces these are
already<00:02:09.160> kind<00:02:09.520> of<00:02:09.610> small<00:02:09.880> I'm<00:02:10.540> gonna<00:02:10.690> rip<00:02:10.960> them

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
already kind of small I'm gonna rip them

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.270 
already kind of small I'm gonna rip them
up<00:02:12.240> to<00:02:13.240> a<00:02:13.270> little<00:02:13.450> bit<00:02:13.600> smaller<00:02:13.990> pieces<00:02:14.290> put

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
up to a little bit smaller pieces put

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:22.590 
up to a little bit smaller pieces put
them<00:02:15.430> down<00:02:15.730> inside<00:02:16.180> the<00:02:16.330> blender<00:02:16.750> now<00:02:21.600> the

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
them down inside the blender now the

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.320 
them down inside the blender now the
great<00:02:22.870> thing<00:02:23.110> with<00:02:23.290> the<00:02:23.590> scrap<00:02:24.330> construction

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
great thing with the scrap construction

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.260 
great thing with the scrap construction
paper<00:02:25.540> paper<00:02:25.870> is<00:02:26.140> they<00:02:26.320> die<00:02:26.620> this<00:02:26.980> and<00:02:27.190> so<00:02:27.370> if

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
paper paper is they die this and so if

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.120 
paper paper is they die this and so if
this<00:02:28.630> may<00:02:28.840> be<00:02:28.900> dyed<00:02:29.200> but<00:02:29.470> it's<00:02:29.650> this<00:02:29.950> whole

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
this may be dyed but it's this whole

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:31.680 
this may be dyed but it's this whole
little<00:02:30.460> bit<00:02:30.700> it's<00:02:30.880> going<00:02:31.030> to<00:02:31.150> die<00:02:31.300> the<00:02:31.360> whole

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
little bit it's going to die the whole

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.720 
little bit it's going to die the whole
bunch<00:02:31.960> so<00:02:32.230> we<00:02:32.380> don't<00:02:32.560> need<00:02:32.740> to<00:02:32.800> purchase<00:02:33.220> dye

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
bunch so we don't need to purchase dye

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.570 
bunch so we don't need to purchase dye
to<00:02:34.450> be<00:02:34.600> able<00:02:34.810> to<00:02:35.050> color<00:02:35.380> this<00:02:35.710> a<00:02:35.770> purple<00:02:36.340> or<00:02:36.550> a

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
to be able to color this a purple or a

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.390 
to be able to color this a purple or a
red<00:02:36.880> we<00:02:37.480> can<00:02:37.510> simply<00:02:38.200> just<00:02:38.530> use<00:02:38.800> construction

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
red we can simply just use construction

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.340 
red we can simply just use construction
paper<00:02:39.610> that<00:02:39.940> I've<00:02:40.240> cut<00:02:40.510> off<00:02:40.660> another<00:02:40.990> project

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
or my students have used and they don't

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.020 
or my students have used and they don't
need<00:02:43.930> any<00:02:44.170> more<00:02:44.200> and<00:02:44.680> shut<00:02:45.400> that<00:02:45.580> down<00:02:45.760> into

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
need any more and shut that down into

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.760 
need any more and shut that down into
the<00:02:46.120> water<00:02:46.300> we<00:02:46.930> have<00:02:47.080> a<00:02:47.110> little<00:02:47.290> bit<00:02:47.410> more<00:02:47.530> room

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:53.820 
the water we have a little bit more room
a<00:02:47.980> little<00:02:48.250> bit<00:02:48.370> more<00:02:48.610> white<00:02:48.790> paper<00:02:52.830> some

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
a little bit more white paper some

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.910 
a little bit more white paper some
pieces<00:02:54.130> of<00:02:54.340> red<00:02:55.230> that'll<00:02:56.230> be<00:02:56.320> pretty<00:02:56.590> for

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
pieces of red that'll be pretty for

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.000 
pieces of red that'll be pretty for
variety<00:02:57.280> I<00:02:57.790> also<00:02:58.780> have<00:02:59.080> used<00:02:59.440> newsprint

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
variety I also have used newsprint

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.840 
variety I also have used newsprint
before<00:03:00.459> like<00:03:00.820> phonebook<00:03:01.360> newsprint<00:03:01.930> and<00:03:02.850> that

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
before like phonebook newsprint and that

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.729 
before like phonebook newsprint and that
has<00:03:04.060> me<00:03:04.300> it's<00:03:04.420> a<00:03:04.480> very<00:03:04.510> interesting<00:03:05.320> texture

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
has me it's a very interesting texture

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:10.380 
has me it's a very interesting texture
to<00:03:06.160> the<00:03:06.570> paper<00:03:07.890> alright<00:03:08.890> I<00:03:09.100> think<00:03:09.970> we<00:03:10.239> have

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
to the paper alright I think we have

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.680 
to the paper alright I think we have
enough<00:03:10.770> make<00:03:11.770> sure<00:03:12.010> you<00:03:12.160> put<00:03:12.370> the<00:03:12.489> lid<00:03:12.700> on<00:03:12.730> one

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
enough make sure you put the lid on one

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.500 
enough make sure you put the lid on one
of<00:03:13.750> the<00:03:13.810> most<00:03:13.989> important<00:03:14.380> things<00:03:15.360> some<00:03:16.360> of<00:03:16.450> the

plop it down right in front of them and

00:05:44.789 --> 00:05:47.120 
plop it down right in front of them and
tell<00:05:44.850> them<00:05:45.660> to<00:05:45.900> go<00:05:46.020> ahead<00:05:46.110> and<00:05:46.410> start<00:05:46.620> making<00:05:46.860> a

tell them to go ahead and start making a
shape<00:05:47.400> I<00:05:47.699> suggested<00:05:48.330> a<00:05:48.419> shape<00:05:48.660> because<00:05:48.930> that's

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:49.110 
shape I suggested a shape because that's

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:50.540 
shape I suggested a shape because that's
