00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
when you may not be inspired enough to

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:08.240 
when you may not be inspired enough to
pick<00:00:06.899> up<00:00:07.020> the<00:00:07.080> instruments<00:00:07.290> for<00:00:07.710> the<00:00:07.770> usual

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
player and at those times perhaps you

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.720 
player and at those times perhaps you
could<00:00:13.139> be<00:00:13.230> inspired<00:00:13.650> instead<00:00:14.130> by<00:00:14.309> thinking

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
could be inspired instead by thinking

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.609 
could be inspired instead by thinking
about<00:00:14.849> how<00:00:15.179> it's<00:00:15.389> making<00:00:15.599> you<00:00:15.809> a<00:00:15.839> better<00:00:15.960> human

path to enlightenment throughout the

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.650 
path to enlightenment throughout the
ages<00:00:30.830> the<00:00:31.830> second<00:00:32.250> is<00:00:32.369> it<00:00:32.940> brings<00:00:33.210> us<00:00:33.360> face<00:00:33.600> to

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
ages the second is it brings us face to

face with and thereby gives us the

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.180 
face with and thereby gives us the
opportunity<00:00:36.390> to<00:00:36.420> overcome<00:00:37.110> what<00:00:37.770> is<00:00:37.890> widely

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
opportunity to overcome what is widely

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.799 
opportunity to overcome what is widely
regarded<00:00:38.550> as<00:00:39.000> one<00:00:39.090> of<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.450> greatest

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
regarded as one of the greatest

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.180 
regarded as one of the greatest
challenges<00:00:40.200> of<00:00:40.710> being<00:00:41.040> human<00:00:41.489> and<00:00:42.170> third<00:00:43.190> it

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
challenges of being human and third it

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.610 
challenges of being human and third it
teaches<00:00:44.579> us<00:00:44.700> to<00:00:44.760> think<00:00:45.000> and<00:00:45.510> perceive<00:00:45.989> in<00:00:46.469> the

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
teaches us to think and perceive in the

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.290 
teaches us to think and perceive in the
ways<00:00:46.800> that<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.219> greatest<00:00:47.670> minds<00:00:48.120> have

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
ways that the greatest minds have

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.680 
ways that the greatest minds have
thought<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:48.840> perceived<00:00:49.469> throughout<00:00:50.010> history

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
thought and perceived throughout history

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.779 
thought and perceived throughout history
so<00:00:51.690> let<00:00:51.989> me<00:00:52.170> elaborate<00:00:52.649> that<00:00:53.129> State<00:00:53.460> of<00:00:53.489> Mind

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
so let me elaborate that State of Mind

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.360 
so let me elaborate that State of Mind
of<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.090> Mystics<00:00:54.510> it's<00:00:55.170> being<00:00:55.440> one<00:00:55.770> with<00:00:56.340> the

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
of the Mystics it's being one with the

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.279 
of the Mystics it's being one with the
experience<00:00:56.699> we<00:00:57.090> are<00:00:57.210> in<00:00:57.420> it's<00:00:57.930> being

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
experience we are in it's being

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.220 
experience we are in it's being
completely<00:00:58.890> present<00:00:59.309> in<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.850> now<00:01:00.030> it's<00:01:00.930> what

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
completely present in the now it's what

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.990 
completely present in the now it's what
happens<00:01:01.680> when<00:01:01.859> we're<00:01:02.070> focused<00:01:02.520> on<00:01:02.670> what<00:01:02.820> we're

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
happens when we're focused on what we're

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.359 
happens when we're focused on what we're
doing<00:01:03.329> without<00:01:03.539> distraction<00:01:04.439> releasing

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
doing without distraction releasing

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.039 
doing without distraction releasing
potential<00:01:05.880> distractions<00:01:06.540> as<00:01:06.659> they<00:01:06.780> come<00:01:07.020> up

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
potential distractions as they come up

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.060 
potential distractions as they come up
and<00:01:07.439> we<00:01:08.340> suddenly<00:01:08.610> feel<00:01:09.119> like<00:01:09.180> two<00:01:10.049> hours<00:01:10.439> was

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
and we suddenly feel like two hours was

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.870 
and we suddenly feel like two hours was
only<00:01:11.400> five<00:01:11.610> minutes<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:13.250> the<00:01:14.250> challenge<00:01:14.729> the

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
only five minutes and the challenge the

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.929 
only five minutes and the challenge the
great<00:01:15.060> challenge<00:01:15.450> we<00:01:15.570> face<00:01:15.810> it's<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.619> ego<00:01:17.009> for

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
great challenge we face it's the ego for

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.580 
great challenge we face it's the ego for
when<00:01:18.119> outs<00:01:18.299> are<00:01:18.479> we<00:01:18.570> more<00:01:18.720> tempted<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:19.229> compare

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
when outs are we more tempted to compare

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.760 
when outs are we more tempted to compare
ourselves<00:01:20.509> we<00:01:21.509> tend<00:01:21.780> to<00:01:21.869> look<00:01:22.080> at<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.320> person

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
ourselves we tend to look at the person

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.999 
ourselves we tend to look at the person
who's<00:01:23.250> more<00:01:23.460> advanced<00:01:23.880> that<00:01:24.150> we<00:01:24.299> are<00:01:24.479> and

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:25.009 
who's more advanced that we are and

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:28.700 
who's more advanced that we are and
potentially<00:01:26.009> become<00:01:26.159> discouraged<00:01:26.880> or<00:01:27.710> we

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
potentially become discouraged or we

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.109 
potentially become discouraged or we
look<00:01:28.920> at<00:01:29.040> them<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:29.369> start<00:01:29.549> picking<00:01:29.759> at<00:01:29.970> their

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
look at them and start picking at their

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.810 
look at them and start picking at their
flaws<00:01:30.329> to<00:01:30.570> bring<00:01:30.780> them<00:01:30.960> down<00:01:30.990> closer<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:31.770> us<00:01:32.100> or

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
flaws to bring them down closer to us or

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.880 
flaws to bring them down closer to us or
we<00:01:33.630> look<00:01:33.780> at<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.049> person<00:01:34.439> who<00:01:34.500> is<00:01:34.530> currently

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
we look at the person who is currently

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.460 
we look at the person who is currently
not<00:01:35.100> as<00:01:35.369> advanced<00:01:35.909> as<00:01:36.000> we<00:01:36.150> are<00:01:36.180> and<00:01:36.630> we<00:01:36.659> think

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
not as advanced as we are and we think

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.319 
not as advanced as we are and we think
at<00:01:37.799> least<00:01:37.979> I'm<00:01:38.250> doing<00:01:38.700> better<00:01:38.880> than<00:01:39.000> they<00:01:39.299> are

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
at least I'm doing better than they are

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.050 
at least I'm doing better than they are
and<00:01:39.720> sort<00:01:40.170> of<00:01:40.229> push<00:01:40.470> them<00:01:40.740> down<00:01:40.770> in<00:01:41.549> a<00:01:41.880> way<00:01:42.000> to

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
and sort of push them down in a way to

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.590 
and sort of push them down in a way to
lift<00:01:42.240> ourselves<00:01:42.420> up<00:01:43.939> instead<00:01:44.939> we<00:01:45.360> could<00:01:45.479> be

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
lift ourselves up instead we could be

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.819 
lift ourselves up instead we could be
looking<00:01:45.810> at<00:01:45.960> that<00:01:46.140> person<00:01:46.470> who<00:01:46.560> is<00:01:46.619> more

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
looking at that person who is more

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.219 
looking at that person who is more
advanced<00:01:47.280> and<00:01:47.369> being<00:01:47.640> purely<00:01:48.000> inspired<00:01:48.600> not
