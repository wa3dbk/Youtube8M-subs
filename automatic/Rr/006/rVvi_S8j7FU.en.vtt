00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
your pecs like what if I generate a bit

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:20.210 
your pecs like what if I generate a bit
extra<00:02:15.450> base<00:02:17.420> okay<00:02:18.420> i<00:02:18.450> switch<00:02:18.870> to<00:02:18.900> the<00:02:19.220> kick-ass

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
extra base okay i switch to the kick-ass

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.770 
extra base okay i switch to the kick-ass
roof<00:02:20.700> peck<00:02:21.030> and<00:02:21.860> yep<00:02:22.860> he<00:02:23.310> is<00:02:23.400> very<00:02:23.610> less<00:02:23.880> Oh<00:02:24.150> yep
