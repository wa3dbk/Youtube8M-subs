00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:06.079 
this is a tutorial on mascara I have
three<00:00:04.560> different<00:00:04.680> kinds<00:00:05.130> of<00:00:05.190> mascara<00:00:05.670> and<00:00:05.940> the

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
three different kinds of mascara and the

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.419 
three different kinds of mascara and the
reason<00:00:06.420> for<00:00:06.450> that<00:00:06.600> is<00:00:06.870> because<00:00:07.340> mascara<00:00:08.340> is

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
reason for that is because mascara is

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.169 
reason for that is because mascara is
that<00:00:08.670> one<00:00:09.080> article<00:00:10.080> of<00:00:10.349> makeup<00:00:10.980> that<00:00:11.010> I<00:00:11.639> would

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
that one article of makeup that I would

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
everything else I would still not throw

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.330

doesn't<00:02:00.430> have<00:02:01.430> any<00:02:01.670> bristles<00:02:02.270> but<00:02:03.200> these

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
doesn't have any bristles but these

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.760 
doesn't have any bristles but these
little<00:02:04.010> tiny<00:02:04.220> bristles<00:02:04.520> on<00:02:04.880> top<00:02:05.180> and<00:02:05.960> what<00:02:06.650> you

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
little tiny bristles on top and what you

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.969 
little tiny bristles on top and what you
would<00:02:06.920> do<00:02:07.540> with<00:02:08.540> any<00:02:08.780> mascara<00:02:09.259> including<00:02:09.890> this

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
would do with any mascara including this

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:11.560 
would do with any mascara including this
one<00:02:10.160> is<00:02:10.369> that<00:02:10.640> the<00:02:10.820> use<00:02:10.970> is<00:02:11.150> not<00:02:11.300> any<00:02:11.450> different

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:11.570 
one is that the use is not any different

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.360 
one is that the use is not any different
but<00:02:12.110> it<00:02:12.290> gets<00:02:12.470> into<00:02:12.650> those<00:02:12.920> little<00:02:13.220> small

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
but it gets into those little small

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.220 
but it gets into those little small
lashes<00:02:13.880> and<00:02:14.120> the<00:02:14.300> ends<00:02:14.570> that<00:02:14.660> you<00:02:14.720> can't<00:02:15.080> get

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
lashes and the ends that you can't get

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.840 
lashes and the ends that you can't get
to<00:02:15.440> is<00:02:16.330> you<00:02:17.330> would<00:02:17.570> start<00:02:18.560> at<00:02:18.710> the<00:02:18.800> base<00:02:19.040> right

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
to is you would start at the base right

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.440 
to is you would start at the base right
there<00:02:20.150> and<00:02:20.960> what<00:02:21.830> I<00:02:21.860> like<00:02:22.190> to<00:02:22.220> do<00:02:22.460> is<00:02:22.910> kind<00:02:23.330> of

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
there and what I like to do is kind of

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.980 
there and what I like to do is kind of
move<00:02:23.570> it<00:02:23.690> side<00:02:23.930> to<00:02:23.960> side<00:02:24.110> and<00:02:25.209> really<00:02:26.209> get<00:02:26.810> a

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
move it side to side and really get a

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.350 
move it side to side and really get a
thick<00:02:27.410> coat<00:02:27.650> at<00:02:27.860> the<00:02:28.010> base<00:02:28.190> a<00:02:28.550> lot<00:02:29.030> of<00:02:29.120> people

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
thick coat at the base a lot of people

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.720 
thick coat at the base a lot of people
miss<00:02:29.570> the<00:02:29.720> base<00:02:29.900> and<00:02:30.260> it's<00:02:31.010> very<00:02:31.340> important<00:02:31.670> to

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
miss the base and it's very important to

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.360 
miss the base and it's very important to
do<00:02:31.850> that<00:02:31.970> for<00:02:32.240> last<00:02:32.480> extension<00:02:33.200> so<00:02:34.040> I<00:02:34.070> get

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
do that for last extension so I get

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.610 
do that for last extension so I get
quite<00:02:35.330> a<00:02:35.360> bit<00:02:35.510> at<00:02:35.600> the<00:02:35.630> base<00:02:35.870> and<00:02:36.200> I<00:02:36.260> can<00:02:36.440> wiggle

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
quite a bit at the base and I can wiggle

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:43.290 
quite a bit at the base and I can wiggle
it<00:02:36.740> around<00:02:36.800> and<00:02:37.340> then<00:02:37.580> I<00:02:37.700> brush<00:02:38.240> it<00:02:38.270> up<00:02:41.830> brush

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
it around and then I brush it up brush

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.510 
it around and then I brush it up brush
and<00:02:44.300> make<00:02:45.170> sure<00:02:45.440> you<00:02:45.620> get<00:02:45.800> those<00:02:45.980> little<00:02:46.220> tiny

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
and make sure you get those little tiny

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.130 
and make sure you get those little tiny
lashes<00:02:47.060> at<00:02:47.180> the<00:02:47.300> end<00:02:47.420> because<00:02:47.780> they<00:02:47.959> make<00:02:48.110> a

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
lashes at the end because they make a

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.750 
lashes at the end because they make a
huge<00:02:48.650> difference

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.840 

okay<00:02:52.760> I'm<00:02:53.420> another<00:02:54.140> trick<00:02:54.560> is<00:02:54.800> that<00:02:54.860> you<00:02:55.340> want

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
to get like on all sides of each lash so

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.009 
to get like on all sides of each lash so
you<00:03:00.320> don't<00:03:00.500> want<00:03:00.650> to<00:03:00.739> just<00:03:00.890> be<00:03:01.269> on<00:03:02.269> the<00:03:02.660> bottom

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:03.019
