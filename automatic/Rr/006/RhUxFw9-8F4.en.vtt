00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
a resilient group I mean I think it

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.930 
a resilient group I mean I think it
starts<00:00:11.670> with<00:00:11.880> their<00:00:12.030> work<00:00:12.210> ethic<00:00:12.920> they<00:00:13.940> they

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
starts with their work ethic they they

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.730 
starts with their work ethic they they
work<00:00:15.179> extremely<00:00:15.480> hard<00:00:15.719> they<00:00:15.990> skate<00:00:16.260> very<00:00:16.500> well

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
work extremely hard they skate very well

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.410 
work extremely hard they skate very well

they've learned everything they've got
you<00:00:23.550> know<00:00:23.580> and<00:00:23.880> when<00:00:24.720> you're<00:00:24.840> playing<00:00:25.019> a<00:00:25.140> group

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
you know and when you're playing a group

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
tough tough one but I guess the the

team but within the city and things of

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.950 
team but within the city and things of
that<00:00:43.559> nature<00:00:43.620> so<00:00:44.870> for<00:00:45.870> us<00:00:47.390> playing<00:00:48.390> with<00:00:48.690> a<00:00:48.719> guy

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
that nature so for us playing with a guy

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.740 
that nature so for us playing with a guy
who's<00:00:49.620> not<00:00:49.800> a<00:00:49.860> typical<00:00:50.280> play<00:00:50.850> making<00:00:51.120> center

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
who's not a typical play making center

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.389 
who's not a typical play making center
even<00:00:52.020> though<00:00:52.110> he's<00:00:52.230> a<00:00:52.289> very<00:00:52.559> valuable<00:00:52.980> player

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
even though he's a very valuable player

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.080 
even though he's a very valuable player
to<00:00:53.760> determine<00:00:54.449> how<00:00:55.379> has<00:00:55.680> that<00:00:56.090> manifested

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
to determine how has that manifested

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.630 
to determine how has that manifested
itself<00:00:57.390> with<00:00:57.660> you<00:00:57.780> guys<00:00:58.219> producing<00:00:59.219> as<00:00:59.340> a<00:00:59.370> line

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
itself with you guys producing as a line

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:00.830 
itself with you guys producing as a line
because<00:00:59.969> you<00:01:00.090> need<00:01:00.329> this<00:01:00.480> for

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
because you need this for

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.290 
because you need this for
I<00:01:01.350> think<00:01:01.949> he's<00:01:02.100> underrated<00:01:02.670> as<00:01:02.879> far<00:01:03.059> as<00:01:03.180> that

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
I think he's underrated as far as that

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.440 
I think he's underrated as far as that
goes<00:01:03.570> Travis<00:01:04.700> playmaking<00:01:05.700> ability<00:01:06.150> wise<00:01:06.299> I

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
goes Travis playmaking ability wise I

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.450 
goes Travis playmaking ability wise I
mean<00:01:06.630> he<00:01:07.439> does<00:01:07.830> so<00:01:08.010> many<00:01:09.920> great<00:01:10.920> things<00:01:10.950> on<00:01:11.340> the

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
mean he does so many great things on the

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.880 
mean he does so many great things on the
ice<00:01:11.580> as<00:01:12.090> a<00:01:12.180> teammate<00:01:12.689> that<00:01:12.750> it<00:01:13.200> allows<00:01:13.500> you<00:01:13.770> to

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
ice as a teammate that it allows you to

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.530 
ice as a teammate that it allows you to
get<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.310> puck<00:01:14.490> and<00:01:14.700> offensive<00:01:15.150> positions

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
get the puck and offensive positions

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.310 
get the puck and offensive positions
more<00:01:15.840> often<00:01:16.140> than<00:01:16.290> not<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:17.780> and<00:01:18.780> I<00:01:18.900> think<00:01:19.170> you

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
more often than not and and I think you

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.440 
more often than not and and I think you
know<00:01:19.409> it's<00:01:19.830> just<00:01:19.979> been<00:01:20.240> one<00:01:21.240> of<00:01:21.270> those<00:01:21.390> years

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
know it's just been one of those years

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.999 
know it's just been one of those years
for<00:01:21.840> him<00:01:21.960> that<00:01:22.110> way<00:01:22.229> where<00:01:22.500> he<00:01:22.650> seems<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:22.950> be

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
for him that way where he seems to be

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.350 
for him that way where he seems to be
doing<00:01:23.040> a<00:01:23.189> lot<00:01:23.250> of<00:01:23.310> third<00:01:23.580> assists<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:24.150> things

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
doing a lot of third assists and things

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.850 
doing a lot of third assists and things
like<00:01:24.509> that<00:01:24.689> where<00:01:24.840> he's<00:01:24.930> making<00:01:25.290> plays<00:01:25.500> that

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
like that where he's making plays that

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.980 
like that where he's making plays that
end<00:01:26.009> up<00:01:26.159> resulting<00:01:26.970> in<00:01:27.240> goals<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:27.659> he's<00:01:27.810> not

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
end up resulting in goals and he's not

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.420 
end up resulting in goals and he's not
not<00:01:28.350> showing<00:01:28.590> up<00:01:28.710> on<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:28.860> score<00:01:29.100> sheet<00:01:29.130> but

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
not showing up on the score sheet but

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.539 
not showing up on the score sheet but
he's<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.850> kind<00:01:30.030> of<00:01:30.090> guy<00:01:30.150> that<00:01:31.400> it<00:01:32.400> truly

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
he's the kind of guy that it truly

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:33.920 
he's the kind of guy that it truly
doesn't<00:01:32.880> matter<00:01:33.150> at<00:01:33.210> all<00:01:33.299> he's<00:01:33.509> just<00:01:33.689> try<00:01:33.869> and

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
doesn't matter at all he's just try and

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.039 
doesn't matter at all he's just try and
play<00:01:34.110> to<00:01:34.170> win<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.409> game<00:01:34.590> and<00:01:35.479> my<00:01:36.479> prediction

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
play to win the game and my prediction

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.929 
play to win the game and my prediction
would<00:01:37.170> be<00:01:37.229> that<00:01:37.350> you<00:01:38.250> know<00:01:38.310> you'll<00:01:38.520> see<00:01:38.729> more

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
would be that you know you'll see more

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.640 
would be that you know you'll see more
of<00:01:39.000> that<00:01:39.210> you<00:01:39.630> know<00:01:39.750> I<00:01:39.780> think<00:01:40.110> that'll<00:01:40.439> change

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
of that you know I think that'll change

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.520 
of that you know I think that'll change
for<00:01:40.860> him<00:01:40.979> too<00:01:41.159> I<00:01:42.119> think<00:01:42.450> that's<00:01:43.140> one<00:01:43.380> of<00:01:43.439> those

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
for him too I think that's one of those

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.170 
for him too I think that's one of those
things<00:01:43.770> that<00:01:43.829> starts<00:01:44.310> happening<00:01:44.399> for<00:01:44.880> you<00:01:45.030> and

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
things that starts happening for you and

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.080 
things that starts happening for you and
I<00:01:45.270> like<00:01:46.049> I<00:01:46.170> said<00:01:46.350> I<00:01:46.439> think<00:01:46.619> is<00:01:46.920> we<00:01:47.759> all<00:01:47.880> know<00:01:48.000> how

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
I like I said I think is we all know how

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.569 
I like I said I think is we all know how
great<00:01:48.329> of<00:01:48.360> a<00:01:48.570> job<00:01:48.600> he<00:01:48.899> does<00:01:49.079> defensively<00:01:49.829> into

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
great of a job he does defensively into

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:51.980 
great of a job he does defensively into
the<00:01:50.670> neutral<00:01:51.000> zone<00:01:51.030> and<00:01:51.390> I<00:01:51.420> and<00:01:51.600> I<00:01:51.659> think<00:01:51.750> his

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
the neutral zone and I and I think his

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.749 
the neutral zone and I and I think his

I<00:02:11.500> do<00:02:11.710> an<00:02:11.860> underlying<00:02:12.280> theme<00:02:12.850> to<00:02:13.150> what<00:02:13.300> you're

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
I do an underlying theme to what you're

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.540 
I do an underlying theme to what you're
saying<00:02:13.840> my<00:02:14.350> personal<00:02:14.710> opinion<00:02:14.800> of<00:02:15.160> that<00:02:15.310> is

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
saying my personal opinion of that is

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.380 
saying my personal opinion of that is
that<00:02:16.020> playing<00:02:17.020> college<00:02:17.380> hockey<00:02:17.620> not<00:02:17.890> only<00:02:18.100> the

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
that playing college hockey not only the

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.090 
that playing college hockey not only the
readiness<00:02:19.390> as<00:02:19.690> far<00:02:19.930> as<00:02:20.080> your<00:02:20.530> skill<00:02:20.830> set<00:02:21.070> and

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
readiness as far as your skill set and

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.760 
readiness as far as your skill set and
body<00:02:21.550> and<00:02:21.910> on<00:02:22.030> ice<00:02:22.240> but<00:02:22.660> I<00:02:22.900> think<00:02:23.560> there's<00:02:23.710> a

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
body and on ice but I think there's a

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.590 
body and on ice but I think there's a
social<00:02:23.980> and<00:02:24.490> outside<00:02:25.060> of<00:02:25.090> the<00:02:25.240> classroom

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
social and outside of the classroom

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.770 
social and outside of the classroom
aspect<00:02:26.440> to<00:02:26.790> developing<00:02:27.790> a<00:02:27.880> personality<00:02:28.300> and<00:02:28.690> a

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
aspect to developing a personality and a

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.200 
aspect to developing a personality and a
comfort<00:02:29.170> within<00:02:29.320> your<00:02:29.530> own<00:02:29.620> skin<00:02:29.950> that<00:02:30.280> that

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.210 
comfort within your own skin that that

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:33.390 
comfort within your own skin that that
allows<00:02:31.750> guys<00:02:32.020> to<00:02:32.200> come<00:02:32.350> in<00:02:32.530> and<00:02:32.770> be<00:02:33.130> successful

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
allows guys to come in and be successful

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.080 
allows guys to come in and be successful
so<00:02:35.100> that's<00:02:36.100> why<00:02:36.250> I'm<00:02:36.370> a<00:02:36.460> big<00:02:36.640> add<00:02:36.760> we<00:02:36.940> could

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
so that's why I'm a big add we could

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.610 
so that's why I'm a big add we could
have<00:02:37.210> called<00:02:37.660> hockey<00:02:38.110> I<00:02:38.140> think<00:02:38.380> it's<00:02:38.500> an

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
have called hockey I think it's an

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.060 
have called hockey I think it's an
important<00:02:39.630> developmental<00:02:40.630> stage<00:02:41.080> for<00:02:41.410> a<00:02:41.440> for

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
important developmental stage for a for

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.970 
important developmental stage for a for
an<00:02:42.130> adolescent<00:02:42.700> person<00:02:43.090> you<00:02:43.360> know<00:02:43.980> regardless

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
an adolescent person you know regardless

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.510 
an adolescent person you know regardless
of<00:02:45.310> athletics<00:02:45.820> and<00:02:46.150> I<00:02:46.240> and<00:02:46.810> I<00:02:46.900> think<00:02:47.020> that

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
of athletics and I and I think that

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.220 
of athletics and I and I think that
that's<00:02:48.520> that's<00:02:49.030> to<00:02:49.390> me<00:02:49.510> the<00:02:49.630> underlying<00:02:49.960> theme

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
that's that's to me the underlying theme

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.470 
that's that's to me the underlying theme
of<00:02:50.470> why<00:02:50.680> some<00:02:51.580> players<00:02:51.790> are<00:02:51.970> able<00:02:52.180> to<00:02:52.210> come<00:02:52.450> in

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
of why some players are able to come in

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.180 
of why some players are able to come in
and<00:02:52.630> do<00:02:52.810> well<00:02:52.960> out<00:02:52.990> of<00:02:53.140> college<00:02:53.530> are<00:02:53.830> you<00:02:53.890> a<00:02:53.980> big
