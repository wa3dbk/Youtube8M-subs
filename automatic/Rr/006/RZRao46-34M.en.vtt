00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 hey and welcome to one 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.690
 new value concept I assume 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.970
 today the love Lord so the 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.900
 liebherr wrecking ball in front of you 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:15.059
 is so completely surprised by 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.289
 Usually arrived at 8:30 pm 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.029
 quickly because of this place 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.220
 I can do his homework 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.699
 It's beautiful, I love it 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.410
 now 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.150
 So what can who makes you can 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:28.970
 Ride quite normal, the floors swinging 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:31.679
 a little bit of freedom kids like it 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.030
 so the citizens are always swinging 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.530
 a little bit is not so wrong after all 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.530
 So then you can turn it around 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:46.620
 a lot I can do that 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:48.570
 speed raw materials out but you 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:56.670
 See that's back in the middle 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:58.260
 then of course it is still that is 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.070
 actually quite funny is an absolute 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.940
 So that's why you say that 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.379
 significant ratings to one 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.090
 pans woodward, it is really cool 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.740
 what has gotten really horny now 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.810
 really gonna hit the building 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.530
 we could break you can yours 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:16.520
 I would do it all 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.900
 of course, never know me 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.150
 It is a pity that the rope in between 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.830
 I can not imagine that 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.830
 but it would be impossible to animate 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:35.490
 But I have such a small idea 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.490
 she is destined 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:45.690
 hey you get in the face 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:02:06.920
 pause what i brought here already 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:08.990
 material say much can I 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.550
 quite senseless things do so 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:17.150
 but since then the murder is an absolute 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:18.470
 fan word and yes it is perhaps time 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.300
 funny a few shit 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.560
 that room I 'll probably still 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.770
 again does not come home from 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:27.830
 I hope I hold my word 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:31.220
 question nyse and like 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.630
 understandable and currently a lot 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.940
 We have a lot of school and also 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.680
 a lot of planning for where we measure 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.630
 are the gamescom and bytes 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.250
 harvest time too and then we have to 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.790
 Also willing to film because we have 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.980
 yes also a reallife 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.510
 prepare agricultural chamber 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.780

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.780
 and such
