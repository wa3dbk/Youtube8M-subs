 slow if you can not wait we're going to 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.469
 teach how how to install it and how 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.899
 It will also serve them well for 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.969
 learn on other occasions if it reaches 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.910
 leave one another and already have the file 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.739
 then in your hands you can flash the 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.800
 without any problem the only thing 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.059
 need is the sdk the a must tools that 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.879
 I'll leave you in the description of 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.590
 video and also the without flash cable for 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.310
 to see how this is done 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.040
 procedure is easy 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:05.770
 and it's just for users who are not 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:08.170
 with your rooted phone or have a 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.210
 recovery well just me this is for a 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.730
 normal 'recovery' is the one that brings 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.340
 stock are in their four and we are going to 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:17.590
 teach them how to enter it and how to do 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.030
 well the use of these commands so 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.920
 well do not miss it let's start 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.300
 with the procedure the first thing that 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.180
 have to do is turn off your phone 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.010
 we are going to 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.350
 to pay we have it here we are going to 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:33.950
 show them a bit that is the version that 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.950
 bring is the 4.4 let's turn it off 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:44.140
 here we can teach them how to dive 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.900
 in recovery stock many do not know we go 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.460
 to teach them how we first have to 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.950
 enter the fast boot mount you know 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:55.170
 pressing the volume keys up and 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.170
 volume down at the same time and power 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:03.060
 ok let's move with the keys 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.060
 recovery volume 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.060
 now that she pressing with the 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.630
 open stomach and three red dots 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:21.090
 let's press 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:23.760
 and volume up and power the trick is 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.379
 so do not hold it sometimes it takes a 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.800
 they have to press the same 

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:27.800
 weather 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.920
 because they already appeared they have to give 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.630
 several times if the first one is not 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.640
 they have to try it several times 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.740
 trick here is not to stop pressing the 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.300
 buttons because if arrive personates 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:42.610
 is going to check the phone what 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.770
 have to do is impressed young and 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.930
 volume up at the same time until 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:49.510
 appear this menu since we are there 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.790
 let's give it to let's move with these 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:55.210
 keys here where it says apply adopt take 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:58.870
 sonar advent we are going to give you here with 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:03:00.910
 the power button and here is ready here 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.250
 He is already telling us that we sent him 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.960
 our package to update and we're going 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.670
 to go to the screen so that you 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.560
 can see the commands is very fast 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.930
 but here on screen what we have to 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.970
 to do is press the shift key in 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.520
 our computer and give it right click 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:17.680
 to the magicians we are going to give him here where he says 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.800
 open a command window here and the 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.860
 we have a list 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.750
 and this is where we are going to execute that is 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:27.400
 obviously the command after that go 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:30.340
 to connect your phone 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:32.500
 let's have it around here is already 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.409
 connected and here we are going to put a 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:38.140
 command to see if it is that the baby 

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:41.060
 is recognizing the device 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:43.690
 let's baby 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:46.800
 devices 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:49.770
 let's wait a little 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:52.320
 and it is telling us that our 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:54.840
 phone is correctly connected to 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:57.280
 lounge is ready and now what we have 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:00.850
 what to do is a dm 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.560
 taylor and they have to paste the name of the 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:04.360
 file I recommend you do what 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:08.440
 following 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:11.420
 badly copied the file 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:13.490
 they're going to give you space here 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:17.260
 to hit him and they're going to add the 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:17.260
 point 5 once they do this 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:24.039
 and if you can see on the screen and it goes 

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:27.600
 advancing the percent and let's leave 

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:27.600
 that ends at one hundred 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.940
 how 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:44.320
 ready once it's over we're going to go to 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.389
 the phone screen so that 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.919
 you see then that there goes 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:49.330
 going around and telling us what is it 

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:51.130
 what are you doing let's give it a little 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:54.540
 of time for me to finish that install 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:54.540
 the update 

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:13.120
 and good and I finish what we have to 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:16.589
 do is give you reboot system 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:16.589
 let's give the power button 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:25.210
 and we have to wait for it to restart 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:25.210
 load the whole system 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:33.250
 remember this procedure does not need 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:35.169
 the bus nor do they need the recovery 

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:36.849
 custo is simply when you 

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:39.129
 they have their phone without modifying it 

00:05:36.849 --> 00:05:40.479
 because the ball is manually with the 

00:05:39.129 --> 00:05:43.060
 site load as we are teaching them 

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:45.129
 to florez a long time and do not have to 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:46.960
 wait so let's hope it is 

00:05:45.129 --> 00:05:49.419
 of your liking that works so well 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:50.919
 like us and we're going to show you that 

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:52.990
 it is really we already have the new version 

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:54.849
 of android we are going to give it here about 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:58.389
 of device and if you can see 

00:05:54.849 --> 00:06:01.650
 we have installed 44.1 here 

00:05:58.389 --> 00:06:01.650
 let's give it here 

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:10.969
 and good as you saw there is already 

00:06:07.129 --> 00:06:12.710
 side to me 4.4.1 salou of this is the 

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:14.599
 easiest way to do it if 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:16.639
 you do not have to wait 

00:06:14.599 --> 00:06:18.770
 it can be done this way if they are 

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:20.300
 users that really do not scare you 

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:22.310
 unknown nobly in album recovery 

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:24.439
 custom, this is a very easy way 

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:24.949
 to do it and well let's hope there 

00:06:24.439 --> 00:06:26.599
 liked 

00:06:24.949 --> 00:06:28.490
 if it is so of ahlu sunna since in the 

00:06:26.599 --> 00:06:29.779
 video if you have any questions or any 

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:32.270
