00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:08.610
 hello and anton this is a bicycle 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:12.710
 cycle computer included you computer 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.710
 Bicycle computer enters with sensor 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:18.720
 magnet us pizza instruction to then 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.039
 which is desirable to follow when 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:25.980
 installing fuck up items such as 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:27.980
 rubber pads fasteners gum 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.119
 hose clamps 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.859
 bike computer you can set Elena 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.719
 us or us 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.719
 we set to minus 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:51.220
 can be with gum can be with 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.220
 screed 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:08.030
 we put the wire with the sensor down on 

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:13.299
 plug and then can be done either in pairs or 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:13.299
 then brake cable 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.390
 install the sensor on the plug the closer 

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:32.890
 to the wall the better 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:35.229
 because the needles are closer to quin 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.649
 accordingly, the magnet will be closer to 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:37.649
 the sensor 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:02:00.550
 if necessary the wire can be pulled 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:02.630
 some places with a tie set 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:05.829
 magnet times pizza 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.829
 can be using a coin 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.010
 key 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:27.120
 look at the magnetics and sensor position 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:33.569
 it is important that the magnet matches the mark on 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:33.569
 bike computer sensor 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:46.330
 We look at the diameter of the tire and 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:48.190
 thickness is looking for the corresponding number in 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:51.670
 the table of our case 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:54.960
 just over two meters we introduce these 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.960
 cycling computer data 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:40.459
 I set the time if necessary and 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:40.459
 check how the bike computer works
