00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:18.279
 good friends I meet in a meeting 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:21.330
 of beteró speaking only of ps with 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:25.520
 the friend césar melián jose rodriguez 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:29.330
 this davis h of the magician 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:32.330
 the bond and mechel gonzález east 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:34.580
 we are talking about seeing more than talking 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:37.550
 all of breeding techniques around here the 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:40.940
 friend 11 this yesterday in the video spoke to us 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:43.489
 of the parameters that are bacteria that 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:47.930
 they are bacteria that are made by boiling 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:49.790
 water and then we put the lettuce in the sun 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.100
 so that it dries, we put it in 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:54.860
 water then they will come out is all these 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:59.739
 microorganisms here is baby a greeting 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:02.960
 to take the game 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:05.950
 here they are there in the covers and 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:08.869
 good they start to leave a micro 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:12.020
 Hualhuas microbial and not and the 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:14.720
 technique of the game be explain the here 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.460
 more or less as is the thing of the of the 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:20.660
 for me super that you do not see is very 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:22.369
 difficult because it's a micrometer then 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:25.250
 you notice the water when when it is 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:27.440
 cloudy that is like this this technique more 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.959
 or less as they put it to breeding for 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.810
 what does it mean when to give or how many days 

00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:35.300
 you put that to the pups to good my 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.920
 brother looks at this one really the 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.590
 production of for sencillita mentions 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.020
 as explained 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:44.049
 they eat for the first three months 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:46.780
 days later for example here are some 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:51.130
 little cubs of a few days four 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:54.280
 four days days look here 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:57.250
 there are many then using this 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.500
 drip system truth we put that 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.560
 one drop for how long you can 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:05.130
 put one drop for each 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:07.829
 or 30 drops per minute the drop by 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.319
 every minute at the rate of one hour and the 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:13.590
 They eat very well like half a liter because 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:16.349
 in each drop they fit approximately in 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:19.890
 300 average for 1300 parameters is a 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:22.500
 micro and the offspring that initially 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.140
 birth has a very small mouth and up 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.780
 the art of me sometimes is big 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.880
 then these parameters and they are left and 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.280
 you're going to see them, you explained something to me 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.140
 light as they put light so something if 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.780
 really when it's not that they can 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.010
 eat like a chick even aha why 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.790
 because you can put a light 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:43.980
 little light bulb exhibits and the 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.750
 correct parameter the parameter if the 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.120
 student because he has a photo of himself 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:51.060
 positive low follows the light as the 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.620
 artemia and the island spends in effect so 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.940
 so much what is followed so they are 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.040
 always eating from the mouth of the 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.420
 Perfect hose is a terrific they 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.069
 they will develop well and the 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.660
 four days and we can win you fear 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:02.489
 the three days to the three days that is 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.069
 when it says a lot of people that can be 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:07.440
 give food you go to the beta when 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:12.120
 and it is just the yolk sac 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:14.070
 something like that and good is jose expert in this 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:17.250
 kind of food out there is has that 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:21.030
 father of how I explained yesterday strains of 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:25.050
 age since it feeds them with a 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:27.720
 droplet of a little bit of yeast and 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:30.630
 see how they are here this is started 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:33.210
 like this the little ones and they are already 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:35.100
 so I really never had achieved 

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:39.840
 I'm going to start putting this 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:41.700
 in practice and the technique is to put it in 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.740
 the dark put a light bulb so that 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.720
 she climb and do not get lost and symphony 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:49.020
 every so often to eliminate the 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:51.930
 ammonium the ammonia true the ammonia and 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:55.440
 good and then a trickle of yeast 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:58.350
 dissolved in water so that all 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:01.530
 these little animals are fed percent 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:04.200
 the paramecia serves feed also to 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:06.390
 the truth this runs feed the damage 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:08.730
 until the same long I started 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:10.860
 feed with the army as it is 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.810
 too easy 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:16.320
 you are looking for a distributor for example 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:21.299
 Peter for saying something and notice how easy 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:24.389
 what is this feeding the larvae 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:27.449
 well and the weights to grow very fast 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:29.879
 everything to small fish are going to give 

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:33.360
 small arms because it turns out I was 

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:35.400
 happened this had very large larvae and the 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.080
 animal was stuck in the 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.870
 Half mouth out with half inside 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:42.449
 of the long and did not drown then 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:45.389
 piles with this you can strain like 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:48.120
 town this one I grab a colander and go 

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:50.039
 taking out the biggest ones in this way and 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.720
 that happened to bakr greatness here and the 

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:53.069
 small ones are falling below and that 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.409
 good way with colander is a little bit 

00:04:53.069 --> 00:04:58.289
 finite so that the small ones pass 

00:04:55.409 --> 00:05:01.080
 that advance a fact for the pups eye 

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:03.330
 this and this of the parameters that is 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.909
 easy to reproduce no longer have to have 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:07.810
 good to know when is when 

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:11.139
 they are in the water 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:12.850
 I do not know if they will be noticed in micro movement 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:17.530
 and good with that it feeds very 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:19.900
 we raise a day servant of 12 days 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:22.180
 of lives so that we do not have casualties 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:24.570
 and remember the temperature changes of 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:24.570
 Water 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:30.029
 sometimes 

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:32.979
 for this date that is cold date of 

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:35.529
 December that the north winds of 

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:38.259
 the towns begin to move arrive at 

00:05:35.529 --> 00:05:39.789
 the cities of the east center there 

00:05:38.259 --> 00:05:41.199
 be very careful with the tails 

00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:43.239
 grit and the young people a lot of people 

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:46.050
 says that the babies died and that 

00:05:43.239 --> 00:05:48.999
 it's because maybe it's hitting the cold 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:50.349
 intense and good they install it in it 

00:05:48.999 --> 00:05:52.629
 white dot and they die all and not 

00:05:50.349 --> 00:05:56.439
 know why he was here was why 

00:05:52.629 --> 00:05:58.300
 next formoseño videos and we were going to see 

00:05:56.439 --> 00:06:00.069
 if we continue with the visits and 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:03.419
 learning more and more from those of the 

00:06:00.069 --> 00:06:03.419
 better until later
