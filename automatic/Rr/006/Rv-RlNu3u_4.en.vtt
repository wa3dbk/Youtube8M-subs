straight<00:01:36.270> um<00:01:36.510> I<00:01:36.870> actually<00:01:37.500> just<00:01:37.890> got<00:01:38.100> the

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
straight um I actually just got the

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.270 
straight um I actually just got the
brazilian<00:01:39.390> keratin<00:01:39.860> treatment<00:01:40.860> done<00:01:41.100> to<00:01:41.190> my

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
brazilian keratin treatment done to my

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.130 
brazilian keratin treatment done to my
hair<00:01:41.310> to<00:01:41.670> get<00:01:41.970> because<00:01:42.420> it's<00:01:42.570> really<00:01:42.690> curly

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
hair to get because it's really curly

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.040 
hair to get because it's really curly
normally<00:01:43.530> so<00:01:43.770> this<00:01:44.580> um<00:01:44.850> helps<00:01:45.630> straighten<00:01:45.960> my

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.050

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.280 
normally so this um helps straighten my
hair<00:01:46.290> and<00:01:46.940> keep<00:01:47.940> the<00:01:48.180> Florida<00:01:48.660> humidity<00:01:49.110> from

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
hair and keep the Florida humidity from

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.590 
hair and keep the Florida humidity from
effect<00:01:49.770> and<00:01:49.950> so<00:01:50.940> that's<00:01:51.060> why<00:01:51.240> it's<00:01:51.270> really

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
effect and so that's why it's really

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.609 
effect and so that's why it's really
that<00:01:51.750> straight<00:01:51.990> right<00:01:52.140> now<00:01:52.200> um<00:01:53.570> after<00:01:54.619> maybe

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
that straight right now um after maybe

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.200 
that straight right now um after maybe
about<00:01:55.830> a<00:01:55.890> month<00:01:56.130> or<00:01:56.280> two<00:01:56.310> it'll<00:01:56.610> start<00:01:56.880> to<00:01:56.910> curl

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
about a month or two it'll start to curl

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.749 
about a month or two it'll start to curl
a<00:01:57.360> little<00:01:57.420> bit<00:01:57.690> more<00:01:57.900> but<00:01:58.140> it<00:01:58.770> won't<00:01:59.040> get

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
a little bit more but it won't get

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.400 
a little bit more but it won't get
frizzy<00:02:00.150> analogous<00:02:00.540> flat<00:02:00.810> iron<00:02:01.110> and<00:02:01.170> I'll

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:01.410 
frizzy analogous flat iron and I'll

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:03.410 
frizzy analogous flat iron and I'll
still<00:02:01.650> dry<00:02:01.860> it<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:02.070> same<00:02:02.280> way<00:02:02.460> um<00:02:02.790> so<00:02:03.330> I

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
still dry it the same way um so I

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.840 
still dry it the same way um so I
figured<00:02:03.690> I'd<00:02:03.750> to<00:02:03.840> show<00:02:04.020> you<00:02:04.080> how<00:02:04.290> because<00:02:04.850> I've
