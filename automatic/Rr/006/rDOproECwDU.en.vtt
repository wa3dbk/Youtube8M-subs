00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.850
 hello friends from the forum builders 1 today 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.309
 I'll show you the first part of the 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.880
 link for the video and ours 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.099
 audi a1 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.349
 then I made a video of mine at 1 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:17.220
 with this tiny machine 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:19.800
 underwater video using the sea 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.500
 will exit the video out cart of the 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.769
 machine and it will connect this is a 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.480
 cable is a cable with mono sound this of 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.689
 this machine will connect 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:35.489
 at the video interface in a noam cables 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:38.250
 which we are in the drawer that 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.890
 what happens now i'm listening to a cd 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.440
 going on the selection of sources 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:47.370
 you will see that video input appears 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.320
 external selecting it will appear the 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.690
 written external video source of course 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.250
 without unblocking you in motion 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.180
 exceeded five kilometers per hour 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.789
 this warning will then come out one 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.460
 what we will solve 

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:09.090
 now turning on the machine e 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:12.170
 going on play we start 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.170
 the last movie I made 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:20.730
 and listen to video in cable 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:23.980
 love to spin off regia white yellow red 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:26.680
 this is a video that the audio that arrives 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.720
 obviously from the machine outputs 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:34.450
 photographic 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:44.740
 volume adjustable via video out 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:48.010
 from the camera in the quality is a lot 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:54.240
 very good of the transmission we go to 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:58.900
 exploit all 480 horizontal pixels 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:01.870
 and of course quality videos too 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:05.470
 greater will be converted into format 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:09.600
 classic is not a bad thing anyway 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:13.300
 from a distance of this type 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:15.250
 however from the distance of the seat 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.370
 of the passenger you can enjoy all the 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:20.910
 video and the very acceptable definition 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.910
 very good 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:27.459
 I will make a video as soon as I get the 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:29.260
 carretta iphone rca and we'll see how it is 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:31.209
 involves with videos coming from 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.760
 camera roll from the application 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:35.760
 specially converted videos for 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.950
 then be transferred from itunes 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:41.220
 on the iphone or ipod 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.220
 See you soon
