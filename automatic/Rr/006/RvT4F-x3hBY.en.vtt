00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
lines and I still think the palette is a

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:21.400 
lines and I still think the palette is a
little<00:02:16.050> bit<00:02:16.260> a<00:02:16.670> little<00:02:17.670> bit<00:02:17.910> too<00:02:18.180> low<00:02:19.550> but

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
little bit a little bit too low but
