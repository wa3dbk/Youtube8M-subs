into<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.650> future<00:01:38.009> we<00:01:38.250> can<00:01:38.430> use<00:01:38.610> kites<00:01:38.939> now<00:01:39.150> in

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
into the future we can use kites now in

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.899 
into the future we can use kites now in
higher<00:01:40.409> wind<00:01:40.740> ranges<00:01:41.130> that<00:01:41.280> we've<00:01:41.460> ever<00:01:41.700> been

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
higher wind ranges that we've ever been

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.060 
higher wind ranges that we've ever been
able<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.270> before<00:01:42.540> and<00:01:42.930> you<00:01:43.560> know<00:01:43.680> they're<00:01:43.920> also

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
able to before and you know they're also

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.429 
able to before and you know they're also
much<00:01:44.549> more<00:01:44.759> user-friendly<00:01:45.119> and<00:01:45.420> forgiving<00:01:45.899> so

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
much more user-friendly and forgiving so

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.499 
much more user-friendly and forgiving so
with<00:01:47.130> one<00:01:47.310> of<00:01:47.399> these<00:01:47.490> new<00:01:47.700> kites<00:01:47.970> you<00:01:48.180> can<00:01:48.420> do

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
with one of these new kites you can do

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:49.880 
with one of these new kites you can do
everything<00:01:48.990> that<00:01:49.079> you<00:01:49.200> could<00:01:49.380> a<00:01:49.409> couple<00:01:49.710> years

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
everything that you could a couple years

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.520 
everything that you could a couple years
ago<00:01:49.979> you're<00:01:50.640> actually<00:01:51.000> getting<00:01:51.149> the

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
ago you're actually getting the

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.530 
ago you're actually getting the
equivalent<00:01:52.530> of<00:01:52.590> 3<00:01:52.920> kites<00:01:53.189> out<00:01:53.430> of<00:01:53.670> just<00:01:53.880> one<00:01:54.149> so
