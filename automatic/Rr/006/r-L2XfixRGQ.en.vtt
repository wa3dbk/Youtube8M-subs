what a great use of flash the crew made

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.479 
what a great use of flash the crew made
and<00:02:42.480> I'd<00:02:42.870> probably<00:02:43.260> still<00:02:43.709> be<00:02:43.769> watching<00:02:44.400> it

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
more fun and allows the show's universe

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.690

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
direction it took in some ways so I'm

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:09.830 
direction it took in some ways so I'm
not<00:03:07.860> sure<00:03:08.129> how<00:03:08.400> well<00:03:08.700> one<00:03:09.000> could<00:03:09.209> separate<00:03:09.780> the
