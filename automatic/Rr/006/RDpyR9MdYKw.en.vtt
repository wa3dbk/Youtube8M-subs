in<00:00:00.210> this<00:00:00.390> video<00:00:00.690> I'll<00:00:01.050> show<00:00:01.230> the<00:00:01.380> change<00:00:01.589> is

00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:01.740 
in this video I'll show the change is

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.249 
in this video I'll show the change is
for<00:00:01.920> overgrowth<00:00:02.310> Alpha<00:00:02.879> 131<00:00:03.600> which<00:00:04.020> you<00:00:04.140> can

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
for overgrowth Alpha 131 which you can

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:06.320 
for overgrowth Alpha 131 which you can
try<00:00:04.440> if<00:00:04.830> you've<00:00:04.980> pre-ordered<00:00:05.549> this<00:00:06.000> week<00:00:06.210> I

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
try if you've pre-ordered this week I

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.299 
try if you've pre-ordered this week I
started<00:00:06.660> with<00:00:06.839> some<00:00:07.020> progress<00:00:07.440> on<00:00:07.710> the<00:00:07.980> weapon

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
started with some progress on the weapon

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.220 
started with some progress on the weapon
animations<00:00:08.880> first<00:00:09.360> I<00:00:09.540> added<00:00:09.750> some<00:00:09.929> info<00:00:10.200> to

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
animations first I added some info to

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.080 
animations first I added some info to
the<00:00:10.440> animations<00:00:10.950> to<00:00:11.160> specify<00:00:11.639> where<00:00:11.910> the

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
the animations to specify where the

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.120 
the animations to specify where the
weapon<00:00:12.360> is<00:00:12.420> attached<00:00:12.780> this<00:00:13.469> ensures<00:00:13.860> that<00:00:13.980> the

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
weapon is attached this ensures that the

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:15.770 
weapon is attached this ensures that the
weapon<00:00:14.460> interpolates<00:00:14.969> along<00:00:15.210> the<00:00:15.330> same<00:00:15.540> path

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
weapon interpolates along the same path

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.689 
weapon interpolates along the same path
as<00:00:16.020> the<00:00:16.170> hand<00:00:16.379> that<00:00:16.529> holds<00:00:16.830> it<00:00:16.949> I<00:00:17.130> also<00:00:17.400> made

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
as the hand that holds it I also made

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:18.859 
as the hand that holds it I also made
sure<00:00:17.730> that<00:00:17.850> the<00:00:18.090> weapons<00:00:18.390> worked<00:00:18.600> with

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
sure that the weapons worked with

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.599 
sure that the weapons worked with
mirroring<00:00:19.410> so<00:00:19.710> that<00:00:19.859> the<00:00:19.980> character<00:00:20.340> can<00:00:20.460> use

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
mirroring so that the character can use

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.609 
mirroring so that the character can use
either<00:00:20.850> a<00:00:21.029> left<00:00:21.300> or<00:00:21.480> right-handed<00:00:22.020> stance<00:00:22.260> I

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
either a left or right-handed stance I

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.410 
either a left or right-handed stance I
fixed<00:00:23.189> some<00:00:23.340> issues<00:00:23.609> with<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:23.910> placeholder

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
fixed some issues with the placeholder

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.630 
fixed some issues with the placeholder
blood<00:00:24.600> splats<00:00:24.900> as<00:00:25.080> well<00:00:25.289> and<00:00:25.560> added<00:00:26.160> a<00:00:26.279> sound

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
blood splats as well and added a sound

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.279 
blood splats as well and added a sound
effect<00:00:26.820> in<00:00:27.119> detail<00:00:27.539> for<00:00:27.810> when<00:00:27.930> they<00:00:28.050> hit<00:00:28.170> the

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
effect in detail for when they hit the

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.589 
effect in detail for when they hit the
ground<00:00:28.410> next<00:00:28.980> I<00:00:29.189> started<00:00:29.550> working<00:00:29.730> on<00:00:30.029> ambient

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
ground next I started working on ambient

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.959 
ground next I started working on ambient
sound<00:00:30.840> effects<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:32.070> first<00:00:32.099> kind<00:00:32.550> of<00:00:32.610> ambient

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
sound effects the first kind of ambient

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.160 
sound effects the first kind of ambient
sound<00:00:33.149> effect<00:00:33.420> doesn't<00:00:33.750> come<00:00:33.899> from<00:00:34.020> any

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
sound effect doesn't come from any

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.229 
sound effect doesn't come from any
specific<00:00:34.739> source<00:00:34.980> but<00:00:35.520> from<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.850> scene<00:00:36.059> in

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
specific source but from the scene in

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.660 
specific source but from the scene in
general<00:00:36.570> this<00:00:36.870> includes<00:00:37.350> wind<00:00:37.620> room<00:00:38.129> tone<00:00:38.370> and

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
general this includes wind room tone and

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.729 
general this includes wind room tone and
other<00:00:38.790> general<00:00:39.629> ambience<00:00:40.020> to<00:00:40.350> play<00:00:40.530> these

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
other general ambience to play these

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.380 
other general ambience to play these
sounds<00:00:41.100> and<00:00:41.219> experimenting<00:00:41.850> with<00:00:42.000> using

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
sounds and experimenting with using

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.450 
sounds and experimenting with using
three<00:00:42.809> mono<00:00:43.079> sources<00:00:43.649> that<00:00:44.070> track<00:00:44.280> the

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
three mono sources that track the

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.250 
three mono sources that track the
cameras<00:00:44.760> position<00:00:44.940> but<00:00:45.510> not<00:00:45.600> its<00:00:45.780> rotation

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
cameras position but not its rotation

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.779 
cameras position but not its rotation
this<00:00:46.559> should<00:00:46.770> allow<00:00:46.980> us<00:00:47.129> to<00:00:47.250> make<00:00:47.370> ambient

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
this should allow us to make ambient

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.610 
this should allow us to make ambient
sounds<00:00:48.059> that<00:00:48.180> have<00:00:48.329> some<00:00:48.539> directionality<00:00:49.020> so

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
sounds that have some directionality so

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:50.660 
sounds that have some directionality so
they<00:00:49.739> can<00:00:49.890> sound<00:00:50.100> different<00:00:50.460> in<00:00:50.520> each

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
they can sound different in each

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.830 
they can sound different in each
direction<00:00:52.879> the<00:00:53.879> second<00:00:54.210> kind<00:00:54.390> of<00:00:54.510> ambient

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
direction the second kind of ambient

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.330 
direction the second kind of ambient
sound<00:00:55.020> effect<00:00:55.289> comes<00:00:55.649> from<00:00:55.860> a<00:00:56.010> specific

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
sound effect comes from a specific

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.939 
sound effect comes from a specific
source<00:00:56.789> for<00:00:57.270> example<00:00:57.690> on<00:00:57.750> this<00:00:57.899> icy<00:00:58.260> level<00:00:58.590> you

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
source for example on this icy level you

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.349 
source for example on this icy level you
can<00:00:59.100> occasionally<00:00:59.579> hear<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.879> ice<00:01:00.030> cracking

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
can occasionally hear the ice cracking

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.560 
can occasionally hear the ice cracking
as<00:01:00.750> warms<00:01:01.230> up<00:01:01.350> in<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.559> Sun

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.730 

to<00:01:06.570> add<00:01:06.690> ambience<00:01:06.930> sounds<00:01:07.380> like<00:01:07.530> these

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
to add ambience sounds like these

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.680 
to add ambience sounds like these
there's<00:01:08.250> now<00:01:08.400> sound<00:01:08.760> tab<00:01:09.000> in<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.360> object

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:09.690 
there's now sound tab in the object

creation window so far we just have this
one<00:01:11.790> and<00:01:12.030> a<00:01:12.180> test<00:01:12.540> sound<00:01:12.810> but<00:01:13.290> Tokyo<00:01:13.470> can<00:01:13.800> make

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
one and a test sound but Tokyo can make

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.320 
one and a test sound but Tokyo can make
more<00:01:14.100> sounds<00:01:14.490> now<00:01:14.640> that<00:01:14.820> they're<00:01:14.940> working<00:01:15.090> in

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
more sounds now that they're working in

game the last new feature was requested
by<00:01:19.530> Albury<00:01:19.979> now<00:01:20.460> you<00:01:20.520> can<00:01:20.760> use<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.060> Alpha

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
by Albury now you can use the Alpha

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.420 
by Albury now you can use the Alpha
channel<00:01:21.690> of<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.869> normal<00:01:22.170> map<00:01:22.320> as<00:01:22.530> a<00:01:22.590> mask<00:01:23.040> for

channel of the normal map as a mask for
color<00:01:23.610> tinting<00:01:24.060> which<00:01:24.540> means<00:01:24.750> you<00:01:24.869> can't<00:01:25.050> in

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
color tinting which means you can't in

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.380 
color tinting which means you can't in
specific<00:01:25.680> areas<00:01:26.040> of<00:01:26.070> objects<00:01:26.670> instead<00:01:27.119> of<00:01:27.300> the
