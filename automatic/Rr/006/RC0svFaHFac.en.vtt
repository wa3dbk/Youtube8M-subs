00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
do they call it modern UI apps used to

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.880 
do they call it modern UI apps used to
be<00:02:22.440> metro-style<00:02:22.890> apps<00:02:23.630> and<00:02:24.630> so<00:02:25.380> you<00:02:25.470> can<00:02:25.680> add

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
be metro-style apps and so you can add

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.140 
be metro-style apps and so you can add
those<00:02:26.130> through<00:02:26.370> the<00:02:26.490> store<00:02:26.760> which

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
those through the store which

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.090 
those through the store which
unfortunately<00:02:27.690> it<00:02:28.110> continues<00:02:28.560> to<00:02:28.680> be<00:02:28.710> one<00:02:28.980> of

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
unfortunately it continues to be one of

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.970 
unfortunately it continues to be one of
the<00:02:29.160> big<00:02:29.310> weaknesses<00:02:29.820> with<00:02:30.630> Windows<00:02:30.990> 8.1<00:02:31.200> and

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
the big weaknesses with Windows 8.1 and

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.560 
the big weaknesses with Windows 8.1 and
one<00:02:32.400> of<00:02:32.520> the<00:02:32.580> things<00:02:32.640> that<00:02:32.910> really<00:02:32.940> holds<00:02:33.330> it

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
one of the things that really holds it

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.680 
one of the things that really holds it
back<00:02:33.600> in<00:02:34.020> competition<00:02:34.680> with<00:02:35.480> Apple<00:02:36.480> and

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
back in competition with Apple and

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.140 
back in competition with Apple and
Google<00:02:36.720> is<00:02:37.500> the<00:02:37.980> the<00:02:38.160> market<00:02:38.550> size<00:02:38.760> just

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
Google is the the market size just

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.290 
Google is the the market size just
really<00:02:39.540> isn't<00:02:39.780> there<00:02:40.140> yet<00:02:40.380> but<00:02:41.340> I<00:02:41.760> feel<00:02:42.270> like

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
really isn't there yet but I feel like

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.180 
really isn't there yet but I feel like
with<00:02:42.630> competitive<00:02:43.140> devices<00:02:43.650> like<00:02:43.800> this<00:02:43.980> one

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
with competitive devices like this one

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.130 
with competitive devices like this one
that<00:02:44.790> may<00:02:44.970> start<00:02:45.330> to<00:02:45.450> change<00:02:45.720> a<00:02:45.900> little<00:02:46.020> bit

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
that may start to change a little bit

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.740 
that may start to change a little bit
plus<00:02:47.040> windows<00:02:47.490> isn't<00:02:47.730> going<00:02:48.150> away<00:02:48.240> in<00:02:48.450> a<00:02:48.540> day

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
plus windows isn't going away in a day

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.380 
plus windows isn't going away in a day
and<00:02:49.100> third-party<00:02:50.100> developers<00:02:50.790> are<00:02:50.940> going<00:02:51.300> to

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
and third-party developers are going to

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.520 
and third-party developers are going to
continue<00:02:51.720> to<00:02:51.990> support<00:02:52.380> it<00:02:52.560> like<00:02:53.550> vista

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
continue to support it like vista

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.680 
continue to support it like vista
eventually<00:02:55.730> Microsoft<00:02:56.730> will<00:02:57.000> write<00:02:57.510> its

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
eventually Microsoft will write its

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.900 
eventually Microsoft will write its
wrongs<00:02:57.960> and<00:02:58.290> we<00:02:58.860> saw<00:02:59.040> that<00:02:59.220> success<00:02:59.700> with

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
wrongs and we saw that success with

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.660 
wrongs and we saw that success with
windows<00:03:00.270> 7<00:03:00.720> where<00:03:01.380> they<00:03:01.500> made<00:03:01.740> changes<00:03:02.220> fix

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
windows 7 where they made changes fix

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.550

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
this and an RT device is that this is

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:37.640 
this and an RT device is that this is
actually<00:03:34.590> a<00:03:34.860> full<00:03:35.160> Windows<00:03:35.610> desktop<00:03:36.060> so<00:03:36.650> for

capability of using them and just like

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.000 
capability of using them and just like
any<00:04:04.980> Windows<00:04:05.700> device<00:04:06.290> you<00:04:07.290> can<00:04:07.470> pair<00:04:07.739> this

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
any Windows device you can pair this

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.580 
any Windows device you can pair this
with<00:04:08.250> a<00:04:08.730> Bluetooth<00:04:09.269> keyboard<00:04:09.720> and<00:04:10.320> a

pared-down full desktop experience and

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:19.430 
pared-down full desktop experience and
through<00:04:18.090> miracast<00:04:18.840> you<00:04:19.140> can<00:04:19.290> actually

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
through miracast you can actually

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.460 
through miracast you can actually
broadcast<00:04:20.160> this<00:04:20.609> wirelessly<00:04:21.180> as<00:04:21.359> well<00:04:21.539> so

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
broadcast this wirelessly as well so

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.100 
broadcast this wirelessly as well so
there<00:04:22.860> are<00:04:22.890> options<00:04:23.250> for<00:04:23.690> using<00:04:24.690> this<00:04:24.810> and

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
there are options for using this and

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.740 
there are options for using this and
tying<00:04:25.320> it<00:04:25.440> to<00:04:25.560> a

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
tying it to a

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:29.880 
tying it to a
your<00:04:25.930> screen<00:04:26.670> so<00:04:27.960> it's<00:04:28.960> a<00:04:29.140> versatile<00:04:29.530> device

or<00:06:51.430> six<00:06:51.729> years<00:06:51.970> but<00:06:52.419> but<00:06:52.750> this<00:06:52.900> is<00:06:53.050> a<00:06:53.080> good

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:53.320

or six years but but this is a good
device<00:06:53.650> and<00:06:54.400> I<00:06:54.550> think<00:06:54.610> they've<00:06:55.030> taken<00:06:55.270> a<00:06:55.800> solid

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:56.800 
device and I think they've taken a solid

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:58.909 
device and I think they've taken a solid
step<00:06:57.070> with<00:06:57.280> this<00:06:57.490> as<00:06:57.789> opposed<00:06:58.120> to<00:06:58.360> previous

00:06:58.909 --> 00:06:58.919 
step with this as opposed to previous

00:06:58.919 --> 00:07:02.930 
step with this as opposed to previous
tablet<00:06:59.919> offerings<00:07:00.310> that<00:07:00.460> they've<00:07:00.639> had<00:07:00.669> so<00:07:01.440> I

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:02.940 
tablet offerings that they've had so I

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:05.460 
tablet offerings that they've had so I
would<00:07:03.940> say<00:07:04.120> that<00:07:04.300> this<00:07:04.479> is<00:07:04.539> a<00:07:04.690> device<00:07:05.080> to<00:07:05.139> watch

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:05.470 
would say that this is a device to watch

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:07.590 
would say that this is a device to watch
out<00:07:05.740> for<00:07:06.150> especially<00:07:07.150> as<00:07:07.240> the<00:07:07.360> price

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:07.600 
out for especially as the price

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:10.110 
out for especially as the price
continues<00:07:08.199> to<00:07:08.229> fall<00:07:08.590> and<00:07:08.919> the<00:07:09.820> next

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:10.120
