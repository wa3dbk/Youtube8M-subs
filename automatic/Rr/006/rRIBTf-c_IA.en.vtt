in<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:23.820> single-player<00:01:24.420> you<00:01:25.020> can't<00:01:25.290> do<00:01:25.530> it<00:01:25.710> in

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
in the single-player you can't do it in

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.980 
in the single-player you can't do it in
GTA<00:01:26.310> online<00:01:26.340> because<00:01:26.880> all<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.150> crates<00:01:27.420> in<00:01:27.659> GTA

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
GTA online because all the crates in GTA

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.020 
GTA online because all the crates in GTA
online<00:01:28.020> are<00:01:28.439> actually<00:01:28.470> stationary<00:01:29.430> so<00:01:29.909> they

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
online are actually stationary so they

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.120 
online are actually stationary so they
don't<00:01:30.240> move<00:01:30.390> whatsoever<00:01:30.990> but<00:01:31.530> hopefully<00:01:32.040> you

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
don't move whatsoever but hopefully you
