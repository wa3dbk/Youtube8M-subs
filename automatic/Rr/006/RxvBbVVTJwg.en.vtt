looking for a little improvement with

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:15.520 
looking for a little improvement with
each<00:01:10.280> ride<00:01:13.540> it'll<00:01:14.540> ask<00:01:14.659> her<00:01:14.840> to<00:01:14.930> flex<00:01:15.170> just<00:01:15.439> a

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
each ride it'll ask her to flex just a

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.120 
each ride it'll ask her to flex just a
little<00:01:15.740> bit<00:01:15.860> on<00:01:16.130> each<00:01:16.220> side<00:01:17.350> here<00:01:18.350> we<00:01:18.500> go<00:01:18.680> it

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
little bit on each side here we go it

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:25.300 
little bit on each side here we go it
was<00:01:19.250> nice<00:01:23.320> I'll<00:01:24.320> ask<00:01:24.500> for<00:01:24.680> that<00:01:24.799> a<00:01:24.830> couple<00:01:25.130> of

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
was nice I'll ask for that a couple of

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:26.980 
was nice I'll ask for that a couple of
times<00:01:25.520> two<00:01:25.880> or<00:01:25.939> three<00:01:26.119> times<00:01:26.390> on<00:01:26.630> the<00:01:26.750> same

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
times two or three times on the same

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.330 
times two or three times on the same
side<00:01:27.369> before<00:01:28.369> I<00:01:28.400> change<00:01:28.850> sides<00:01:30.040> so<00:01:31.040> that<00:01:31.070> she

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
side before I change sides so that she

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.510 
side before I change sides so that she
can<00:01:31.520> just<00:01:32.619> get<00:01:33.619> that<00:01:33.799> a<00:01:33.830> little<00:01:33.980> bit<00:01:34.160> salt<00:01:34.460> a

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
little bit more solid on that side

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.250 
little bit more solid on that side
before<00:01:36.380> we<00:01:37.480> change<00:01:38.480> rather<00:01:38.750> than<00:01:38.900> switching

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:39.260 
before we change rather than switching

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:53.080 
before we change rather than switching
back<00:01:39.530> and<00:01:39.560> forth<00:01:39.770> left<00:01:40.190> and<00:01:40.370> right<00:01:40.520> honor<00:01:44.710> good

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.530 
here we go good girl I'm just nudging
her<00:02:35.609> lightly<00:02:36.030> with<00:02:36.930> my<00:02:37.109> right<00:02:37.319> heel<00:02:37.640> back<00:02:38.640> at

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
her lightly with my right heel back at

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.599 
her lightly with my right heel back at
that<00:02:39.810> thumb<00:02:40.319> spot<00:02:40.680> that<00:02:40.950> we<00:02:41.040> worked<00:02:41.250> on<00:02:41.400> with

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:41.609 
that thumb spot that we worked on with

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:45.879 
that thumb spot that we worked on with
the<00:02:42.620> ground<00:02:43.620> exercises<00:02:44.340> installing<00:02:45.180> that

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:45.889 
the ground exercises installing that

00:02:45.889 --> 00:02:48.440 
the ground exercises installing that
sensitivity<00:02:46.889> for<00:02:47.250> that<00:02:47.370> spot<00:02:47.670> right<00:02:47.939> there<00:02:47.969> so

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
sensitivity for that spot right there so

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.089 
sensitivity for that spot right there so
it<00:02:48.629> would<00:02:48.750> be<00:02:48.870> there<00:02:49.049> for<00:02:49.079> us<00:02:49.379> when<00:02:49.620> we<00:02:49.889> needed

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:50.099 
it would be there for us when we needed

00:02:50.099 --> 00:03:09.510 
it would be there for us when we needed
it<00:02:50.420> mounted<00:02:56.959> yeah

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:09.520 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:14.050 

that's<00:03:10.520> a<00:03:10.640> little<00:03:10.850> better<00:03:12.700> all<00:03:13.700> right<00:03:13.819> we'll

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
that's a little better all right we'll

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:42.700 
that's a little better all right we'll
just<00:03:14.209> let<00:03:14.330> her<00:03:14.420> wander<00:03:14.600> off<00:03:14.870> now

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:42.710 

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:46.400 

not<00:03:43.710> making<00:03:43.950> many<00:03:44.190> demands<00:03:44.640> but<00:03:44.940> I'm<00:03:45.410> asking

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
not making many demands but I'm asking

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:47.810 
not making many demands but I'm asking
for<00:03:46.560> a<00:03:46.620> little<00:03:46.740> bit<00:03:46.950> of<00:03:47.100> direction<00:03:47.220> control

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820 
for a little bit of direction control

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.970 
for a little bit of direction control
just<00:03:48.330> generally<00:03:48.810> going<00:03:49.470> around<00:03:49.740> to<00:03:49.860> the<00:03:49.950> left

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
just generally going around to the left

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.390 
just generally going around to the left
here<00:03:50.370> without<00:03:50.550> changing<00:03:51.120> direction<00:03:52.340> so<00:03:53.340> I

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
here without changing direction so I

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.470 
here without changing direction so I
have<00:03:53.580> a<00:03:53.610> pretty<00:03:53.910> wide<00:03:54.650> path<00:03:56.120> that<00:03:57.120> I'm

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
have a pretty wide path that I'm

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.910 
have a pretty wide path that I'm
allowing<00:03:57.780> her<00:03:58.080> to<00:03:58.110> follow<00:04:00.560> not<00:04:01.560> trying<00:04:01.830> to

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
allowing her to follow not trying to

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.490 
allowing her to follow not trying to
make<00:04:02.040> lots<00:04:02.370> of<00:04:02.520> Corrections<00:04:03.090> here<00:04:03.500> pretty

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
make lots of Corrections here pretty

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.710 
make lots of Corrections here pretty
much<00:04:04.590> just<00:04:04.860> letting<00:04:05.160> her<00:04:05.220> wander<00:04:05.660> being<00:04:06.660> a

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
much just letting her wander being a

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.050 
much just letting her wander being a
passenger<00:04:07.110> up<00:04:07.380> here<00:04:07.620> but<00:04:07.830> sort<00:04:08.700> of<00:04:08.760> keeping

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
passenger up here but sort of keeping

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:10.400 
passenger up here but sort of keeping
are<00:04:09.150> generally<00:04:09.510> heading<00:04:09.810> around<00:04:10.140> this
