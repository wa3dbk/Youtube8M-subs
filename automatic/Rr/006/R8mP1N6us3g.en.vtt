well here all the series six LEGO
Minifigures<00:03:51.140> and<00:03:51.409> this<00:03:51.950> took<00:03:52.099> a<00:03:52.129> little<00:03:52.280> while

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:52.489 
Minifigures and this took a little while

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:54.509 
Minifigures and this took a little while
for<00:03:52.790> your<00:03:52.879> work<00:03:53.030> out<00:03:53.239> which<00:03:53.989> one<00:03:54.170> was<00:03:54.319> which

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:54.519 
for your work out which one was which

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:58.149 
for your work out which one was which
there's<00:03:55.519> quite<00:03:56.000> a<00:03:56.030> tricky<00:03:56.269> set<00:03:56.599> to<00:03:56.750> find<00:03:57.159> as

00:03:58.149 --> 00:03:58.159 
there's quite a tricky set to find as

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:00.039 
there's quite a tricky set to find as
many<00:03:58.459> of<00:03:58.640> you<00:03:58.790> would<00:03:58.879> know<00:03:59.060> there's<00:03:59.720> a<00:03:59.840> little

many of you would know there's a little

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:02.860 
many of you would know there's a little
secret<00:04:00.230> code<00:04:00.620> of<00:04:01.579> dimples<00:04:02.060> it's<00:04:02.540> not<00:04:02.689> like

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
secret code of dimples it's not like

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.470 
secret code of dimples it's not like
Braille<00:04:03.200> very<00:04:03.620> very<00:04:04.519> very<00:04:04.760> lightly<00:04:05.150> struck

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 
Braille very very very lightly struck

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.339 
Braille very very very lightly struck
Braille<00:04:05.750> on<00:04:06.709> the<00:04:07.510> bottom<00:04:08.510> of<00:04:08.540> these<00:04:08.659> bags<00:04:08.959> and

00:04:09.339 --> 00:04:09.349 
Braille on the bottom of these bags and

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:11.949 
Braille on the bottom of these bags and
I<00:04:09.439> found<00:04:09.739> the<00:04:09.859> crystal<00:04:10.040> white<00:04:10.400> bags<00:04:10.700> it<00:04:11.689> was

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:11.959 
I found the crystal white bags it was

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:14.410 
I found the crystal white bags it was
really<00:04:12.409> really<00:04:12.560> tricky<00:04:12.799> to<00:04:13.209> see<00:04:14.209> these

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:14.420 
really really tricky to see these

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:15.759 
really really tricky to see these
dimples<00:04:14.720> this<00:04:15.079> time<00:04:15.260> around<00:04:15.439> you<00:04:15.590> can<00:04:15.739> just

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:15.769 
dimples this time around you can just

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:21.430 
dimples this time around you can just
see<00:04:16.609> one<00:04:18.099> just<00:04:19.099> there<00:04:19.690> it's<00:04:20.690> very<00:04:20.780> very<00:04:21.109> hard

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
see one just there it's very very hard

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:27.520 
see one just there it's very very hard
to<00:04:21.620> see<00:04:21.820> on<00:04:22.820> a<00:04:22.880> white<00:04:23.120> bag<00:04:25.870> as<00:04:26.870> some<00:04:27.139> of<00:04:27.229> you<00:04:27.320> may

know if you've been watching my videos I

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.659 
know if you've been watching my videos I
use<00:04:29.449> a<00:04:29.479> variety<00:04:29.690> of<00:04:29.930> methods<00:04:30.220> to<00:04:31.220> find<00:04:31.430> all<00:04:31.610> the

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:31.669 
use a variety of methods to find all the

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:33.900 
use a variety of methods to find all the
minifigures<00:04:32.120> I<00:04:32.330> used<00:04:32.509> weighing<00:04:32.990> the<00:04:33.110> bags<00:04:33.320> I

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:33.910 
minifigures I used weighing the bags I

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:36.939 
minifigures I used weighing the bags I
look<00:04:34.910> at<00:04:35.000> the<00:04:35.090> code<00:04:35.300> it<00:04:36.229> also<00:04:36.410> did<00:04:36.650> a<00:04:36.710> finger

00:04:36.939 --> 00:04:36.949 
look at the code it also did a finger

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:38.620 
look at the code it also did a finger
filled<00:04:37.130> method<00:04:37.400> as<00:04:37.490> well<00:04:37.669> and<00:04:38.210> it<00:04:38.389> was<00:04:38.449> one

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630 
filled method as well and it was one

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:39.339

off for this explanation so if you're
doing<00:05:01.699> a<00:05:01.849> finger<00:05:02.120> peel<00:05:02.270> method<00:05:02.599> you're<00:05:03.110> gonna

00:05:03.279 --> 00:05:03.289 
doing a finger peel method you're gonna

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:05.589 
doing a finger peel method you're gonna
find<00:05:03.530> this<00:05:03.710> large<00:05:04.460> ball<00:05:04.729> would<00:05:04.970> be<00:05:05.090> very<00:05:05.360> wary

00:05:05.589 --> 00:05:05.599 
find this large ball would be very wary

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:07.629 
find this large ball would be very wary
because<00:05:05.990> there<00:05:06.169> are<00:05:06.260> other<00:05:06.380> LEGO<00:05:06.979> Minifigures

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:07.639 
because there are other LEGO Minifigures

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:09.760 
because there are other LEGO Minifigures
in<00:05:07.760> the<00:05:07.820> series<00:05:08.180> which<00:05:09.139> have<00:05:09.289> a<00:05:09.320> very<00:05:09.530> large

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:09.770 
in the series which have a very large

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:12.969 
in the series which have a very large
headpiece<00:05:11.199> if<00:05:12.199> using<00:05:12.470> the<00:05:12.560> finger<00:05:12.800> felt

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:12.979 
headpiece if using the finger felt

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:14.589 
headpiece if using the finger felt
method<00:05:13.250> it's<00:05:13.520> easy<00:05:13.699> to<00:05:13.909> get<00:05:14.030> confused<00:05:14.180> between

00:05:14.589 --> 00:05:14.599 
method it's easy to get confused between

00:05:14.599 --> 00:05:17.020 
method it's easy to get confused between
these<00:05:15.260> two<00:05:15.440> figures<00:05:15.650> especially<00:05:16.400> they<00:05:16.880> got

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:17.030 
these two figures especially they got

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:18.750 
these two figures especially they got
the<00:05:17.120> two<00:05:17.240> largest<00:05:17.539> head<00:05:17.750> pieces<00:05:17.990> in<00:05:18.289> a<00:05:18.380> sense

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:18.760 
the two largest head pieces in a sense

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:20.800 
the two largest head pieces in a sense
this<00:05:19.760> critters<00:05:20.060> like<00:05:20.240> legs

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:20.810 
this critters like legs

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:23.320 
this critters like legs
the<00:05:21.800> genie<00:05:22.039> hasn't<00:05:22.370> got<00:05:22.460> legs<00:05:22.789> but<00:05:23.000> the<00:05:23.150> thing

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:23.330 
the genie hasn't got legs but the thing

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:25.600 
the genie hasn't got legs but the thing
you'll<00:05:23.449> probably<00:05:23.479> feel<00:05:23.900> this<00:05:24.169> guy<00:05:24.409> is<00:05:25.340> you'll

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:25.610 
you'll probably feel this guy is you'll
