00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.590
 Today I 'm going to show you how I prepare 

00:00:02.219 --> 00:00:08.120
 bananas stuffed with cheese 

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:13.550
 for that we need male bananas 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:21.330
 fresh cheese eggs flour bench 

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:23.250
 pepper salt and oil the first step is 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.160
 boil the bananas male for 15 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.050
 minutes at medium temperature you have to 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.740
 make sure that the water covers the 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.260
 bananas completely 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.920
 these must be firm so there's 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.920
 to remove them 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:46.900
 once cooked we are going to leave them 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.900
 cool 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.470
 already cold we are going to peel them 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.760
 and we are going to cut them in three or four 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:06.760
 pieces 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:16.550
 we are going to open in half without 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.550
 get to cut them completely 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:25.410
 we are going to remove the center with the 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.410
 help of a knife or spoon 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.659
 new girl the information box 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.649
 because there they will find the list 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.649
 complete of the ingredients 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.579
 and once we remove the center the 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.579
 let's fill with the cheese 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:11.550
 here I use chopsticks to prevent it from 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.550
 open 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.390
 is ours again let's cut the 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:25.680
 piece of banana in half without 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.680
 cut it completely 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.320
 we removed the center 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.050
 ah 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:43.230
 and we fill it with cheese here I am 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:47.329
 using fresh cheese but you can use 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.329
 some other cheese like panela or aÃ±ejo 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.500
 let's beat the eggs with pepper and 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.500
 Salt 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:21.290
 and let's move the stuffed bananas 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.290
 for the egg 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.489
 then we went through flour that 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.489
 cover well with flour 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.380
 we went through eggs again 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:44.510
 and finally therefore if they do not have 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.819
 bank can use bread crumb 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:48.980
 here I remove the chopsticks and try 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:51.460
 tighten them a little so they do not go 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.520
 to disrupt when frying 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:53.520
 to 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.360
 Y 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.440
 ah 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:10.040
 and now we will fry in a frying pan 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:12.329
 with hot oil at medium temperature 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.460
 and these are going to fry until they are 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:16.290
 golden 

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:18.590
 and once they are addicted they are already 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:18.590
 ready 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:22.819
 I hope you like they try and 

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:24.949
 you know if they try to tell what 

00:04:22.819 --> 00:04:27.460
 that was thanks and we'll see you until the 

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:27.460
