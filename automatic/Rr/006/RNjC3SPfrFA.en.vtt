try<00:01:43.470> to<00:01:43.530> get<00:01:43.710> to<00:01:43.800> higher<00:01:43.950> ground<00:01:43.980> say<00:01:44.640> they<00:01:44.820> all

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:44.940 
try to get to higher ground say they all

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:46.610 
try to get to higher ground say they all
come<00:01:45.120> back<00:01:45.150> down<00:01:45.480> like<00:01:45.600> this<00:01:45.810> they're<00:01:46.530> all

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:46.620

trying to get to higher ground

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.460 
trying to get to higher ground
so<00:01:48.180> you<00:01:48.300> come<00:01:48.510> back<00:01:48.600> and<00:01:48.810> spray<00:01:48.930> them<00:01:49.020> again<00:01:49.290> as

doesn't matter if it's way too loose but
especially<00:01:55.830> on<00:01:56.160> these<00:01:56.280> points<00:01:56.670> but<00:01:56.790> um<00:01:57.030> if<00:01:57.960> you

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
especially on these points but um if you

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.680 
especially on these points but um if you

getting them all again get the perimeter

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:04.040 
getting them all again get the perimeter
real<00:02:02.370> good<00:02:02.610> because<00:02:03.360> they<00:02:03.420> try<00:02:03.570> to<00:02:03.630> get<00:02:03.810> away
