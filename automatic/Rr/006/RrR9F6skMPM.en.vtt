00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
were any ships around and how the whale

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.900 
were any ships around and how the whale
reacted<00:02:33.110> to<00:02:33.260> them<00:02:33.410> by<00:02:34.070> having<00:02:34.519> a<00:02:34.670> better

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
reacted to them by having a better

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.509 
reacted to them by having a better
understanding<00:02:35.870> of<00:02:36.019> what<00:02:36.350> goes<00:02:36.620> on<00:02:36.890> when<00:02:37.370> the

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
whales are feeding and what they do at

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.210 
whales are feeding and what they do at
night<00:02:40.250> the<00:02:41.060> biologists<00:02:41.780> hope<00:02:42.140> they<00:02:42.830> can<00:02:43.010> find

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
night the biologists hope they can find

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.210 
night the biologists hope they can find
ways<00:02:43.550> to<00:02:43.850> reduce<00:02:44.000> the<00:02:44.780> whale<00:02:45.050> ship<00:02:45.530> collisions

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
ways to reduce the whale ship collisions

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.750 
ways to reduce the whale ship collisions
I<00:02:46.510> think<00:02:47.510> a<00:02:47.540> lot<00:02:47.750> of<00:02:47.780> the<00:02:47.959> public<00:02:48.290> really

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
I think a lot of the public really

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.229 
I think a lot of the public really
identifies<00:02:49.930> with<00:02:50.930> whales<00:02:51.320> and<00:02:51.620> even<00:02:52.610> though

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
identifies with whales and even though

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:55.180 
identifies with whales and even though
my<00:02:53.420> studies<00:02:53.810> deal<00:02:54.049> just<00:02:54.410> with<00:02:54.560> whales<00:02:54.769> one<00:02:55.070> of

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
my studies deal just with whales one of

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.130 
my studies deal just with whales one of
the<00:02:55.250> important<00:02:55.670> things<00:02:55.730> that<00:02:56.030> I<00:02:56.420> think<00:02:57.049> the

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
the important things that I think the

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.680 
the important things that I think the
public<00:02:57.290> needs<00:02:57.560> to<00:02:57.799> realize<00:02:58.190> is<00:02:58.610> that<00:02:58.820> protect

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
public needs to realize is that protect

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:01.539 
public needs to realize is that protect
whales<00:02:59.900> we<00:03:00.620> have<00:03:00.769> to<00:03:00.920> protect<00:03:01.070> the<00:03:01.340> marine

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:01.549 
whales we have to protect the marine

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:04.210 
whales we have to protect the marine
environment<00:03:01.579> as<00:03:02.239> a<00:03:02.299> whole<00:03:02.650> be<00:03:03.650> sure<00:03:03.890> to<00:03:04.040> watch

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220

travel to the Mississippi River which is

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:11.949 
travel to the Mississippi River which is
the<00:03:09.260> largest<00:03:09.560> drain<00:03:10.190> in<00:03:10.400> our<00:03:10.519> country<00:03:11.000> and<00:03:11.209> see

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
the largest drain in our country and see

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:13.780 
the largest drain in our country and see
what<00:03:12.170> it<00:03:12.290> takes<00:03:12.560> to<00:03:12.769> clean<00:03:13.070> up<00:03:13.250> an<00:03:13.400> oil<00:03:13.519> spill

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
what it takes to clean up an oil spill

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.360 
what it takes to clean up an oil spill
before<00:03:14.180> it<00:03:14.510> gets<00:03:14.720> to<00:03:14.900> the<00:03:15.019> ocean<00:03:15.410> you're<00:03:16.160> going

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
before it gets to the ocean you're going

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.160 
before it gets to the ocean you're going
to<00:03:16.430> find<00:03:16.670> out<00:03:16.850> what<00:03:17.060> cheerleader<00:03:17.600> pom-poms

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
to find out what cheerleader pom-poms

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:19.440 
to find out what cheerleader pom-poms
and<00:03:18.410> oil<00:03:18.620> spills<00:03:18.950> have

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
and oil spills have

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.140 
and oil spills have
almond<00:03:19.780> stay<00:03:20.770> with<00:03:20.950> us<00:03:21.160> it's<00:03:21.400> a<00:03:21.459> dirty<00:03:21.819> work

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
almond stay with us it's a dirty work

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:31.300 
almond stay with us it's a dirty work
but<00:03:22.540> it's<00:03:22.660> going<00:03:22.780> to<00:03:22.870> be<00:03:22.989> an<00:03:23.080> interesting<00:03:23.200> show

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.180 

you

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190
