00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.680
 good as I'm not good at talking 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:11.950
 the pothole 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.300
 ah 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.430
 I would know how to do 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:33.050
 and know how to make a backside 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.050
 Thats why we 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.690
 when it comes to throwing it, do not rush 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.290
 directly and when turning is just 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:00.810
 if you are confident that it is a trick there 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.730
 a lot of confidence the biggest problem is 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:06.420
 go through and maybe there's also a problem 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:09.030
 the output that is to change the weight of 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.180
 hit that is already practical practice 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.180
 practice 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:24.909
 and obviously everyone is going back to the 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.749
 railing 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:27.749
 so that 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:33.870
 good you have to pass the 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.980
 the back axle above 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:37.890
 that's why I've told you before 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:40.840
 that you have to put your feet as if 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:45.700
 will try to make a backside the magic of 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:48.070
 backflip is the shoulders those magical 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.140
 how are you going backwards the main thing is 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:53.890
 make a good turn of the shoulders to be able to 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:56.830
 put the back shaft on top of the 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:02:00.870
 good railing like that to start what 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:03.650
 better it will be 6 coming a little 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.650
 a little yes 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.320
 think it was difficult trick 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.720
 so before doing a good oli 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:14.129
 will try to make the pothole a little more 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.989
 late 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:17.310
 if you go diagonally maybe it costs you a 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:18.930
 little more because you have to turn a little 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.120
 more and if you have to do it over 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.610
 late then it will cost us this now 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.190
 it depends on how you see the principle what 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.760
 you try and we are doing very well but maybe 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:32.900
 it's faster to do it in parallel than in 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:37.590
 the exit as they are shoulders completely 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:39.629
 since you just entered and you'll have the 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:43.220
 shoulders completely like this from here you have 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:43.220
 to throw the albos more back 

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:12.350
 ah 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.350
 ah 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.099
 ah 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.940
 ah 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:36.900
 and until here 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.900
 the video tutorial
