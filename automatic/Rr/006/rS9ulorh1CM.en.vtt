way you know I'm in the final again like
that's<00:03:05.120> incredible<00:03:05.659> I'm<00:03:05.870> so<00:03:05.900> pumped<00:03:06.530> I<00:03:06.799> was<00:03:07.340> in

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
that's incredible I'm so pumped I was in

that's incredible I'm so pumped I was in
my<00:03:07.579> own<00:03:07.730> head<00:03:08.030> and<00:03:08.209> I<00:03:08.510> was<00:03:08.599> in<00:03:08.780> my<00:03:08.989> own<00:03:09.290> space
