00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.370 
but you can see these are the pins the
GX<00:00:17.600> which<00:00:18.600> fit<00:00:18.930> in<00:00:19.080> there<00:00:19.340> these<00:00:20.340> are<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.699> pins

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:21.380 
GX which fit in there these are the pins

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.220 
GX which fit in there these are the pins
through<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:22.560> heart<00:00:23.070> of<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.220> three<00:00:24.050> you<00:00:25.050> can

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
through the heart of the three you can

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.419 
through the heart of the three you can
see<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.680> heart<00:00:25.890> of<00:00:25.949> afraid<00:00:26.279> to<00:00:28.220> face<00:00:29.220> the

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.610 
should have a third movie and also I
noticed<00:00:41.280> it<00:00:41.520> right<00:00:41.550> here<00:00:42.239> stay<00:00:42.870> right<00:00:42.899> there

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
it's pretty thin yeah I think I'm going

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.470 
it's pretty thin yeah I think I'm going
to<00:00:47.520> use<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.820> gasket<00:00:48.300> cement<00:00:48.510> sort<00:00:49.110> of<00:00:50.329> look<00:00:51.329> at

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
to use the gasket cement sort of look at

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.180 
to use the gasket cement sort of look at
this<00:00:51.770> this<00:00:52.770> is<00:00:52.949> his<00:00:53.100> mine<00:00:53.399> but<00:00:53.820> you<00:00:53.969> can<00:00:54.120> see

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
this this is his mine but you can see

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:00.020 
this this is his mine but you can see
how<00:00:56.190> it's<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.820> leading<00:00:57.660> over<00:00:57.840> and<00:00:58.879> I<00:00:59.879> actually

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
how it's the leading over and I actually

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.790 
how it's the leading over and I actually
bought<00:01:00.420> this<00:01:00.449> engine<00:01:01.020> off<00:01:01.140> this<00:01:01.320> guy<00:01:01.559> because

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
bought this engine off this guy because

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.290 
bought this engine off this guy because
they<00:01:01.920> don't<00:01:02.100> really<00:01:02.250> have<00:01:02.460> time<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:02.910> fix<00:01:03.090> them

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
they don't really have time to fix them

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.469 
they don't really have time to fix them
then<00:01:04.010> that's<00:01:05.010> why<00:01:05.220> everybody<00:01:05.760> just<00:01:06.090> gets<00:01:06.330> them

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
then that's why everybody just gets them

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.410 
then that's why everybody just gets them
already<00:01:06.840> built<00:01:07.380> form<00:01:07.830> you<00:01:08.159> know<00:01:08.340> where<00:01:09.240> is

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
already built form you know where is

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.370 
already built form you know where is
this<00:01:09.659> way

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
this way

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.469 
this way
are<00:01:10.560> you<00:01:10.860> building<00:01:11.430> myself<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.330> I<00:01:12.420> know

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
are you building myself and I know

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.960 
are you building myself and I know
what's<00:01:12.900> wrong<00:01:13.140> with<00:01:13.439> it<00:01:13.549> it's<00:01:14.549> kind<00:01:14.820> of<00:01:14.880> like

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
what's wrong with it it's kind of like

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.490 
what's wrong with it it's kind of like
everything<00:01:15.570> else<00:01:15.750> you<00:01:15.990> build<00:01:16.229> it<00:01:16.350> yourself

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
everything else you build it yourself

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.590 
everything else you build it yourself
and<00:01:16.979> it<00:01:17.070> actually<00:01:17.250> cost<00:01:17.670> more<00:01:17.939> money<00:01:18.210> than<00:01:18.450> if

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
and it actually cost more money than if

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.320 
and it actually cost more money than if
you<00:01:18.659> get<00:01:18.869> them<00:01:19.049> to<00:01:19.200> build<00:01:19.409> it<00:01:20.030> but<00:01:21.030> you<00:01:21.180> know

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
you get them to build it but you know

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.090 
you get them to build it but you know
what<00:01:21.509> everybody<00:01:21.900> is<00:01:22.080> done<00:01:22.320> better<00:01:22.560> if<00:01:22.979> you

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
what everybody is done better if you

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.670 
what everybody is done better if you
know<00:01:23.250> what<00:01:23.400> you're<00:01:23.610> doing<00:01:23.939> so<00:01:24.380> what<00:01:25.380> we<00:01:25.500> do

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
know what you're doing so what we do

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.530 
know what you're doing so what we do
leads<00:01:25.979> out<00:01:26.220> where<00:01:26.490> they<00:01:26.670> do<00:01:26.729> believe<00:01:27.180> it<00:01:27.240> the

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
leads out where they do believe it the

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.850 
leads out where they do believe it the
zip<00:01:27.810> I<00:01:28.200> have<00:01:29.159> one<00:01:29.400> of<00:01:29.549> these<00:01:29.670> right<00:01:30.090> here<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:30.860> I

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
zip I have one of these right here and I

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.210 
zip I have one of these right here and I
also<00:01:32.070> have<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:33.320> about<00:01:34.320> half<00:01:34.590> a<00:01:34.710> dozen<00:01:34.920> of

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
also have the about half a dozen of

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.600 
also have the about half a dozen of
these<00:01:36.140> so<00:01:37.140> you<00:01:37.290> can<00:01:37.439> do<00:01:37.560> it<00:01:37.710> either<00:01:37.829> way<00:01:37.979> but<00:01:38.460> I

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
these so you can do it either way but I

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.190 
these so you can do it either way but I
found<00:01:38.909> that<00:01:39.060> this<00:01:39.210> is<00:01:39.360> much<00:01:39.600> easier<00:01:39.630> you<00:01:40.170> just

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
found that this is much easier you just

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.010 
found that this is much easier you just
stuck<00:01:40.740> it<00:01:40.890> in<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.159> hole<00:01:41.310> of<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.460> fits<00:01:42.020> you

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
stuck it in the hole of the fits you

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.600 
stuck it in the hole of the fits you
know<00:01:43.170> which<00:01:43.409> is<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.710> 7/16<00:01:45.320> was<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.610> 2760

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
know which is the 7/16 was the 2760

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.580 
know which is the 7/16 was the 2760
force<00:01:47.880> is<00:01:48.060> too<00:01:48.270> small<00:01:48.570> and<00:01:48.930> then<00:01:49.110> on<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.409> back

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
force is too small and then on the back

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.359 
force is too small and then on the back
it's<00:01:49.799> got<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.100> metric<00:01:50.490> system<00:01:50.820> see<00:01:52.130> seven<00:01:53.130> six

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
it's got the metric system see seven six

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.240 
it's got the metric system see seven six
seven<00:01:54.240> sixteenths<00:01:55.049> is<00:01:55.200> 11<00:01:55.680> point<00:01:55.979> one

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
seven sixteenths is 11 point one

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.149 
seven sixteenths is 11 point one
millimeter<00:01:57.170> so<00:01:58.170> that's<00:01:58.469> what<00:01:58.619> we're<00:01:58.740> gonna<00:01:58.860> do

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
millimeter so that's what we're gonna do

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.209 
millimeter so that's what we're gonna do
I<00:01:59.430> guess<00:02:00.030> you<00:02:00.390> could<00:02:00.540> do<00:02:00.689> it<00:02:00.869> I<00:02:01.079> could<00:02:01.469> do<00:02:01.950> it<00:02:01.979> on

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
I guess you could do it I could do it on

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.389 
I guess you could do it I could do it on
a<00:02:02.340> grill<00:02:02.430> hat<00:02:02.850> and<00:02:03.420> drill<00:02:03.840> but

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:04.399 
a grill hat and drill but

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:06.399 
a grill hat and drill but
you<00:02:04.820> know<00:02:04.939> what<00:02:05.119> to<00:02:05.329> get<00:02:05.540> good<00:02:05.750> at<00:02:05.869> doing<00:02:06.049> that

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:06.409 
you know what to get good at doing that

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:07.990 
you know what to get good at doing that
on<00:02:06.560> a<00:02:06.710> hand<00:02:06.950> roll<00:02:07.159> you're<00:02:07.369> gonna<00:02:07.460> have<00:02:07.640> to<00:02:07.790> mess

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
on a hand roll you're gonna have to mess

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.790 
on a hand roll you're gonna have to mess
up<00:02:08.209> a<00:02:08.300> lot<00:02:08.509> of<00:02:08.539> stuff<00:02:08.929> before<00:02:09.200> you<00:02:09.410> get<00:02:09.679> it

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
up a lot of stuff before you get it
