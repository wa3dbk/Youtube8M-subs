00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
going to teach you a butterfly cake or

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.780 
going to teach you a butterfly cake or
you<00:00:06.270> can<00:00:06.420> call<00:00:06.569> it<00:00:06.690> a<00:00:06.750> be<00:00:06.960> kick<00:00:07.230> if<00:00:07.830> you<00:00:08.189> think

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
you can call it a be kick if you think

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.350 
you can call it a be kick if you think
it's<00:00:08.910> too

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.209 

it's<00:00:12.660> whatever<00:00:13.730> anyway

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:16.219 
it's whatever anyway

it's whatever anyway
looks<00:00:16.730> like<00:00:16.970> start<00:00:17.420> like<00:00:17.449> this

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:19.810 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:27.940 

this

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.670 

just<00:00:32.240> like<00:00:32.360> that<00:00:32.480> there's<00:00:33.050> also<00:00:33.140> another<00:00:33.380> way

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:33.680 
just like that there's also another way

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.730 
just like that there's also another way
to<00:00:33.740> do<00:00:33.980> it<00:00:34.130> called<00:00:34.990> using<00:00:35.990> momentum<00:00:36.140> steps

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:36.740 
to do it called using momentum steps

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:48.180 
to do it called using momentum steps
which<00:00:37.070> looks<00:00:37.310> like<00:00:37.490> this<00:00:37.700> I<00:00:37.970> start<00:00:38.570> like<00:00:38.690> this

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:48.190 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:59.500 

you

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.090 

that's<00:00:59.600> what<00:00:59.780> it<00:00:59.809> looks<00:00:59.899> like<00:01:00.320> here<00:01:00.920> are<00:01:01.010> your

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
that's what it looks like here are your

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.670 
that's what it looks like here are your
steps<00:01:01.600> if<00:01:02.600> you're<00:01:02.870> doing<00:01:03.170> it<00:01:03.320> a<00:01:03.530> standstill<00:01:04.159> or

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680 
steps if you're doing it a standstill or

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.910 
steps if you're doing it a standstill or
momentum<00:01:06.680> steps<00:01:08.140> either<00:01:09.140> way<00:01:09.409> you're<00:01:09.799> going

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
momentum steps either way you're going

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.889 
momentum steps either way you're going
to<00:01:09.950> get<00:01:10.070> to<00:01:10.220> this<00:01:10.340> position<00:01:10.610> we're<00:01:11.540> starting

00:01:11.889 --> 00:01:11.899 
to get to this position we're starting

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:14.889 
to get to this position we're starting
like<00:01:12.049> this<00:01:12.399> kind<00:01:13.399> of<00:01:13.460> up<00:01:13.610> here<00:01:13.909> now<00:01:14.750> you're

like this kind of up here now you're

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:16.389 
like this kind of up here now you're
going<00:01:14.990> to<00:01:15.110> have<00:01:15.229> one<00:01:15.500> leg<00:01:15.710> straighten<00:01:16.250> one<00:01:16.369> leg

00:01:16.389 --> 00:01:16.399 
going to have one leg straighten one leg

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:19.029 
going to have one leg straighten one leg
kind<00:01:16.820> of<00:01:16.909> bent<00:01:17.259> sort<00:01:18.259> of<00:01:18.350> thing<00:01:18.560> is<00:01:18.860> there

00:01:19.029 --> 00:01:19.039 
kind of bent sort of thing is there

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:20.950 
kind of bent sort of thing is there
going<00:01:19.130> to<00:01:19.190> be<00:01:19.280> over<00:01:19.610> on<00:01:19.700> this<00:01:19.850> side<00:01:19.909> now<00:01:20.869> after

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
going to be over on this side now after

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.779 
going to be over on this side now after
doing<00:01:21.229> your<00:01:21.350> momentum<00:01:21.860> steps<00:01:22.130> you're<00:01:22.610> going

00:01:22.779 --> 00:01:22.789 
doing your momentum steps you're going

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:24.520 
doing your momentum steps you're going
to<00:01:22.850> start<00:01:23.030> here<00:01:23.420> you're<00:01:24.140> going<00:01:24.229> to<00:01:24.289> kind<00:01:24.500> of

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
to start here you're going to kind of

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.710 
to start here you're going to kind of
come<00:01:24.740> around<00:01:25.009> like<00:01:25.250> this

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
come around like this

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.930 
come around like this
do<00:01:26.960> this<00:01:27.140> and<00:01:27.860> you<00:01:27.980> see<00:01:28.160> you're<00:01:28.340> in<00:01:28.430> that<00:01:28.580> exact

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:28.940 
do this and you see you're in that exact

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:30.850 
do this and you see you're in that exact
same<00:01:29.150> position<00:01:29.380> so<00:01:30.380> if<00:01:30.440> you're<00:01:30.590> doing<00:01:30.740> your

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
same position so if you're doing your

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.460 
same position so if you're doing your
momentum<00:01:31.220> steps<00:01:31.520> just<00:01:32.210> think<00:01:32.540> okay<00:01:32.720> I'm<00:01:33.170> here

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
momentum steps just think okay I'm here

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.460 
momentum steps just think okay I'm here
I've<00:01:34.310> done<00:01:34.550> my<00:01:34.670> momentum

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:35.470 
I've done my momentum

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.220 
I've done my momentum
and<00:01:35.950> I'm<00:01:36.130> in<00:01:36.280> this<00:01:36.370> position<00:01:36.580> now<00:01:37.060> all<00:01:38.020> right

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:38.230

and I'm in this position now all right
or<00:01:39.130> if<00:01:39.310> you're<00:01:39.430> just<00:01:39.460> doing<00:01:39.700> it<00:01:39.850> from<00:01:39.970> standing

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 
or if you're just doing it from standing

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.210 
or if you're just doing it from standing
you're<00:01:41.110> just<00:01:41.230> going<00:01:41.410> to<00:01:41.470> stand<00:01:41.650> here<00:01:41.800> will

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220 
you're just going to stand here will

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.430 
you're just going to stand here will
start<00:01:42.550> to<00:01:42.670> the<00:01:42.790> side<00:01:42.970> this<00:01:43.870> leg<00:01:44.050> is<00:01:44.080> straight

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:44.440 
start to the side this leg is straight

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.980 
start to the side this leg is straight
it's<00:01:44.950> like<00:01:45.130> is<00:01:45.250> bent<00:01:45.490> arms<00:01:45.970> over<00:01:46.150> here<00:01:46.390> like<00:01:46.960> a

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
it's like is bent arms over here like a

over this direction is step one is your

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.660 
over this direction is step one is your
first<00:01:57.370> your<00:01:58.240> first<00:01:58.450> pose<00:01:58.660> this<00:01:59.260> direction

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
first your first pose this direction

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
you're coming up this way and push it up

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.500 
you're coming up this way and push it up
this<00:02:25.260> leg<00:02:25.560> so<00:02:26.430> you<00:02:26.490> started<00:02:26.850> here<00:02:27.030> at<00:02:27.180> Point

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
this leg so you started here at Point

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.810 
this leg so you started here at Point
going<00:02:28.290> down<00:02:28.560> through<00:02:28.980> this<00:02:29.070> you<00:02:29.250> shaping<00:02:29.670> your

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
going down through this you shaping your

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.760 
going down through this you shaping your
kind<00:02:30.060> of<00:02:30.120> coming<00:02:30.450> back<00:02:30.600> up<00:02:30.840> with<00:02:31.410> your<00:02:31.560> legs
