what is your perception I think they can

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.209 
what is your perception I think they can
but<00:00:49.230> there's<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.500> strength<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.070> Tea

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
but there's a strength to the Tea

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.619

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
Republicans first of all because it's a

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.430 
Republicans first of all because it's a
citizen<00:00:54.239> movement<00:00:54.420> is<00:00:54.660> a<00:00:54.690> genuinely<00:00:55.199> sincere

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
citizen movement is a genuinely sincere

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.560

uprising of people who are really mad

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.209 
uprising of people who are really mad
about<00:00:57.600> big<00:00:57.989> government<00:00:58.020> and<00:00:58.410> second<00:00:59.160> because

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
about big government and second because

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.130 
about big government and second because
tea<00:00:59.520> parties<00:00:59.879> can<00:01:00.059> reach<00:01:00.210> into<00:01:00.570> Democratic

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
tea parties can reach into Democratic

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.450 
tea parties can reach into Democratic
districts<00:01:01.559> where<00:01:01.649> no<00:01:01.800> Republican<00:01:02.340> will

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
districts where no Republican will

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.310 
districts where no Republican will
compete<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:03.030> tea<00:01:03.510> parties<00:01:03.870> can<00:01:04.049> start

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
compete and tea parties can start

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.960 
compete and tea parties can start
recruiting<00:01:04.619> candidates<00:01:05.220> who<00:01:05.369> are<00:01:05.400> Democrats

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
recruiting candidates who are Democrats

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.870 
recruiting candidates who are Democrats
to<00:01:06.600> run<00:01:06.840> as<00:01:07.049> fiscal<00:01:07.950> conservatives<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:08.729> run

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
to run as fiscal conservatives to run

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.270 
to run as fiscal conservatives to run
for<00:01:09.090> some<00:01:09.240> lower<00:01:09.510> taxes<00:01:10.470> smaller<00:01:10.770> budgets

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
for some lower taxes smaller budgets

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.700 
for some lower taxes smaller budgets
less<00:01:11.580> corruption<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.930> I<00:01:13.200> think<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.560> tea

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
less corruption and I think the tea

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.980 
less corruption and I think the tea
parties<00:01:14.040> in<00:01:14.100> that<00:01:14.189> sense<00:01:14.460> are<00:01:14.720> natural<00:01:15.720> allies

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
parties in that sense are natural allies

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.840 
parties in that sense are natural allies
of<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.500> Republicans<00:01:17.070> but<00:01:17.490> they're<00:01:17.670> not

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
of the Republicans but they're not

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.429 
of the Republicans but they're not
identical<00:01:18.030> with<00:01:18.509> them<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:18.900> I<00:01:18.960> think<00:01:19.170> that<00:01:19.290> we

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
identical with them and I think that we

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.620 
identical with them and I think that we
would<00:01:19.560> lose<00:01:19.770> something<00:01:20.369> if<00:01:20.850> tea<00:01:21.119> parties<00:01:21.479> just

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
would lose something if tea parties just

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.630 
would lose something if tea parties just
became<00:01:21.930> a<00:01:21.960> wing<00:01:22.350> of<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.560> Republican<00:01:23.009> Party<00:01:23.040> I

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
became a wing of the Republican Party I

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:24.740 
became a wing of the Republican Party I
think<00:01:23.909> there's<00:01:24.060> something<00:01:24.270> fresh<00:01:24.720> and

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
think there's something fresh and

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.230 
think there's something fresh and
original<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:25.650> exciting<00:01:26.189> about<00:01:26.340> having<00:01:27.119> this

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
original and exciting about having this

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.319 
original and exciting about having this
genuinely<00:01:27.869> try<00:01:28.200> partisan<00:01:28.740> movement<00:01:28.890> of

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:29.329 
genuinely try partisan movement of

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:31.609 
genuinely try partisan movement of
Republicans<00:01:30.329> Democrats<00:01:30.509> independents<00:01:31.140> all

Republicans Democrats independents all

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.800 
Republicans Democrats independents all
coming<00:01:32.159> together<00:01:32.280> because<00:01:33.180> of<00:01:33.329> fear<00:01:33.570> about

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
coming together because of fear about

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.210

referred<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.229> Tea<00:01:37.650> Party<00:01:37.920> movement<00:01:37.950> is

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
referred to the Tea Party movement is

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.890 
referred to the Tea Party movement is
like<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.610> unattached<00:01:38.970> conscience<00:01:39.630> of<00:01:39.780> the

like the unattached conscience of the
