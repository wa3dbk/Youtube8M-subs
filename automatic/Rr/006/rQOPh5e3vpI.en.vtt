 that's what they call Andy Rottler and x4 640 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.310

 in this video also show bad luck that 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.400
 even with this process if even Crisis 2 

00:02:11.719 --> 00:02:14.719
 run at about 50 or 60 FPS 

00:02:16.859 --> 00:02:19.859
 most of the attitude in the game 

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:23.539
 that is really weak are something like my own 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:27.129
 it works fine 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:30.059
 no stuttering 

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:34.329
 Flat for the first time on 35 FPS, it is short from the Rock 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:38.869
 constant is actually on 40 45 50 something from the 11th 

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:43.039

 so if I have her now 

00:03:00.999 --> 00:03:03.999
 and structural engineers as a test option 

00:03:11.469 --> 00:03:14.469
 I have to give it all by hand 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:21.489
 there threatens 

00:03:30.429 --> 00:03:33.429
 comparable to my percent bycatch 

00:03:40.869 --> 00:03:43.869
 this posting 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:49.339
 517

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:22.390
 the system settings is also Fraport now really is not 

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:25.580
 we succeeded 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:28.449
 are conceivable 

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:31.669
 this looks like this 

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:34.669
 taken over 11 

00:05:36.339 --> 00:05:39.339
 and the app of the company Lotto percent 

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:51.279
 Seriously exaggerated
