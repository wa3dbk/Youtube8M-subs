00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
hit it maybe a little layer of air to

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.720 
hit it maybe a little layer of air to
help

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.300 

a<00:02:13.819> little<00:02:14.450> bit<00:02:14.569> of<00:02:14.659> a<00:02:14.739> hook<00:02:15.739> right<00:02:15.920> here<00:02:16.099> if<00:02:16.220> I

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
a little bit of a hook right here if I

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:17.170 
a little bit of a hook right here if I
hang<00:02:16.519> it<00:02:16.550> up<00:02:16.700> to<00:02:16.730> dry

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
hang it up to dry

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.059 
hang it up to dry
and<00:02:17.360> this<00:02:17.840> black<00:02:18.110> that's<00:02:18.530> probably<00:02:18.890> showing

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.069 
and this black that's probably showing

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:20.800 
and this black that's probably showing
up<00:02:19.250> really<00:02:19.549> to<00:02:19.700> contrast<00:02:20.120> it<00:02:20.269> in<00:02:20.360> this<00:02:20.480> this<00:02:20.540> is

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
up really to contrast it in this this is

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.570 
up really to contrast it in this this is
us<00:02:20.959> it's<00:02:21.260> a<00:02:21.379> synthetic<00:02:21.709> band<00:02:22.069> that<00:02:22.250> goes<00:02:22.400> the

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
us it's a synthetic band that goes the

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.520 
us it's a synthetic band that goes the
whole<00:02:22.700> way<00:02:22.849> around<00:02:22.970> it<00:02:23.330> it's<00:02:23.930> actually<00:02:24.260> acts

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
whole way around it it's actually acts

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.399 
whole way around it it's actually acts
as<00:02:24.680> like<00:02:24.799> a<00:02:24.860> wicking<00:02:25.310> layer<00:02:25.549> so<00:02:26.269> as<00:02:26.629> I<00:02:27.019> sweat<00:02:27.379> on

00:02:27.399 --> 00:02:27.409 
as like a wicking layer so as I sweat on

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:30.100 
as like a wicking layer so as I sweat on
the<00:02:27.709> around<00:02:28.129> my<00:02:28.370> head<00:02:28.610> on<00:02:28.760> my<00:02:28.879> crown<00:02:29.120> this<00:02:29.930> is

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
the around my head on my crown this is

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.300 
the around my head on my crown this is
gonna<00:02:30.230> keep<00:02:30.470> it<00:02:30.590> from<00:02:30.650> coming<00:02:31.010> down<00:02:31.040> on<00:02:31.250> my

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
gonna keep it from coming down on my

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.360 
gonna keep it from coming down on my
face<00:02:31.519> on<00:02:31.760> the<00:02:31.849> brow<00:02:32.230> you<00:02:33.230> know<00:02:33.349> has<00:02:34.340> that

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
face on the brow you know has that

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.280 
face on the brow you know has that
wicking<00:02:34.790> to<00:02:34.970> texture<00:02:35.599> material<00:02:35.720> or

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
wicking to texture material or

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:37.780 
wicking to texture material or
technology<00:02:36.920> that<00:02:36.950> we've<00:02:37.310> seen<00:02:37.489> a<00:02:37.519> lot<00:02:37.700> of

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
technology that we've seen a lot of

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.479 
technology that we've seen a lot of
different<00:02:38.030> synthetics<00:02:38.480> and<00:02:38.660> blends<00:02:39.370> which<00:02:40.370> I

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:40.489 
different synthetics and blends which I

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:41.530 
different synthetics and blends which I
really<00:02:40.670> like<00:02:40.849> for<00:02:41.030> this<00:02:41.120> hat<00:02:41.360> because

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
really like for this hat because

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.009 
really like for this hat because
honestly<00:02:42.140> right<00:02:42.319> now<00:02:43.269> the<00:02:44.269> temperature<00:02:44.750> is

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019 
honestly right now the temperature is

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:46.900 
honestly right now the temperature is
probably<00:02:45.530> close<00:02:45.920> to<00:02:46.069> 90<00:02:46.370> degrees<00:02:46.670> the

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
probably close to 90 degrees the

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.819 
probably close to 90 degrees the
relative<00:02:47.269> humidity<00:02:47.780> is<00:02:48.170> projected<00:02:48.739> to<00:02:48.769> be

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:48.829 
relative humidity is projected to be

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:51.009 
relative humidity is projected to be
over<00:02:48.920> 50<00:02:49.280> and<00:02:49.700> it<00:02:49.879> is<00:02:50.060> freaking<00:02:50.510> gross<00:02:50.750> out

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:51.019 
over 50 and it is freaking gross out

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:52.360 
over 50 and it is freaking gross out
it's<00:02:51.319> beautiful<00:02:51.709> to<00:02:51.769> be<00:02:51.890> out<00:02:52.010> here<00:02:52.040> you<00:02:52.250> can

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
it's beautiful to be out here you can

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:53.289 
it's beautiful to be out here you can
probably<00:02:52.549> hear<00:02:52.760> a<00:02:52.819> lot<00:02:52.970> of<00:02:53.000> the<00:02:53.120> birds

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:53.299 
probably hear a lot of the birds

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:55.900 
probably hear a lot of the birds
chirping<00:02:53.510> it's<00:02:54.290> really<00:02:54.590> calm<00:02:54.799> day<00:02:55.040> in<00:02:55.370> the

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
chirping it's really calm day in the

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:57.550 
chirping it's really calm day in the
sense<00:02:56.150> of<00:02:56.329> you<00:02:56.540> know<00:02:56.660> the<00:02:56.870> forest<00:02:57.170> alive<00:02:57.410> and

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
sense of you know the forest alive and

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:58.780 
sense of you know the forest alive and
it<00:02:57.650> feels<00:02:57.829> really<00:02:58.010> cool<00:02:58.190> but<00:02:58.400> it's<00:02:58.519> really

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
it feels really cool but it's really

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.030 
it feels really cool but it's really
really<00:02:59.480> humid<00:02:59.900> and<00:03:00.049> just<00:03:00.470> a<00:03:00.560> little<00:03:00.829> bit<00:03:00.950> of

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
really humid and just a little bit of

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.099 
really humid and just a little bit of
activity<00:03:01.340> you<00:03:01.579> just<00:03:01.700> have<00:03:02.060> sweat<00:03:02.450> sweat

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:03.109 
activity you just have sweat sweat

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:05.080 
activity you just have sweat sweat
coming<00:03:03.319> down<00:03:03.620> and<00:03:03.859> that's<00:03:04.190> why<00:03:04.340> I<00:03:04.370> chose<00:03:04.700> a<00:03:04.760> hat

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
coming down and that's why I chose a hat

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.699 
coming down and that's why I chose a hat
like<00:03:05.120> this<00:03:05.420> and<00:03:05.599> the<00:03:05.660> canopy<00:03:05.959> I<00:03:06.109> don't<00:03:06.440> need<00:03:06.620> it

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
like this and the canopy I don't need it

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.199 
like this and the canopy I don't need it
for<00:03:06.799> a<00:03:06.859> Sun<00:03:07.099> Hat<00:03:07.129> I<00:03:07.310> wouldn't<00:03:07.790> use<00:03:07.879> it<00:03:07.910> for<00:03:08.180> a

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
for a Sun Hat I wouldn't use it for a

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:09.849 
for a Sun Hat I wouldn't use it for a
Sun<00:03:08.450> Hat<00:03:08.480> if<00:03:08.720> I<00:03:08.810> was<00:03:08.930> in<00:03:09.019> and<00:03:09.170> you<00:03:09.440> know<00:03:09.530> direct

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:09.859 
Sun Hat if I was in and you know direct

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:11.800 
Sun Hat if I was in and you know direct
sunlight<00:03:10.099> but<00:03:10.910> since<00:03:11.090> I'm<00:03:11.209> in<00:03:11.299> the<00:03:11.359> canopy<00:03:11.780> I

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
sunlight but since I'm in the canopy I

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:13.449 
sunlight but since I'm in the canopy I
like<00:03:12.079> it<00:03:12.230> to<00:03:12.410> wear<00:03:12.560> a<00:03:12.590> cap<00:03:12.920> all<00:03:13.160> the<00:03:13.280> time
