 Subscribers combat is not live 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.470
 that is , it is not live because there have been 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.150
 a little problem with recording and 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.580
 is that the voice of the guide listens to us 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.210
 correctly and good and exact had a 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:36.870
 problem with the program 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:42.230
 but good technical but I'm going to give the 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.230
 play a good fight 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:49.230
 it's certainly the view subscribers 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.020
 and Álvaro have contacted 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.149
 account have been put in contact 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:55.980
 they made their strategies since I 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.809
 I said on twitter that good follow each other 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.910
 among them to talk about what 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.199
 they want to do the few that are going to choose 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.870
 etc 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.420
 and well I say it more than anything because 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.619
 you and when I for example 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.170
 let's say on twitter 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:13.320
 hey we look for two people for combat 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.180
 double label you we have on twitter and 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.280
 you already contact 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.830
 your anger not with your 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.600
 combat mate yesterday my combat 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.970
 because there is a fight on my channel if 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.710
 it's Saturdays it's in the guide channel and 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.380
 Sundays on my channel but there were people 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.840
 who said that they could not have 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.399
 communicated and all that but we 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.860
 we have never really prevented it from 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:36.420
 can communicate is more we already leave it 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.039
 the best is that we leave it 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:44.039
 clear but good I just did the 

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:45.750
 key action of the myopic lightning arrestor because 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:47.520
 has no problem is the picacho gave us 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.409
 fear was press I did it to you and I am 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.060
 Sparks then knew that the champion 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.009
 it did not affect him but as a lightning rod he 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.630
 he got the special attack on pikachu tse 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.940
 the values ​​that fails the west where there are 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.350
 a little place but good I could strain 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.179
 the weird space but love that you do not 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.659
 paralyzed you my mother no no no no 

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:06.539
 less bad males are two data very 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.970
 open double attentive now attentive to 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:11.209
 I'm going to be reinforcement for 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.209
 help 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:20.450
 exact and attentive to the change attentive to the 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:20.450
 cameron wave 23 host 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.560
 amazing 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.299
 What is it 

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:40.920
 well here it is a pre-worthy medium 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.359
 if they bothered us here I imagined 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.810
 one surprise as it was very obvious 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:47.340
 but he had not so active to me good 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.319
 I did reinforcement because he has not lost 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.689
 nothing if we did reinforcement to see if it was 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:54.120
 and here it was surprising that it was for 

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:56.150
 fit and they were focused on cameros 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.349
 the one that nadal mente you had already been with 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.370
 the ignia wave that would have made 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:02.609
 a lot of damage 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.469
 cs and by the way since we're here like this 

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:06.810
 commenting on the combat remember that yesterday 

00:03:04.469 --> 00:03:09.599
 his battle chapter has already risen good 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:12.299
 cooperative yes that was quite was 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:14.250
 pretty well the truth but there was some 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:16.500
 that another file but it's the typical file of 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.990
 start 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.360
 we will be retouching all these failures yo 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:23.360
 I think this fight came out pretty 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.360
 Right 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:34.590
 he burst it and here we are so that 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:37.580
 I got it to freeze but it's that 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.580
 such fear offering 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.940
 if I was bought take to see if 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:46.250
 we lost a turn that by the way was 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.250
 good because it 's fine 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.660
 to see if he was 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:58.380
 it was direct for you but good to 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:59.730
 see the fifth line quite slow and 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.080
 Now I here remember that I told you 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.350
 I think it will end the triple I can not 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:13.880
 put in so he finished the wheat and the bird 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:16.380
 Sado was to end the same because the 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:19.380
 rays that I had hacks and I avoided it if to 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:21.000
 sites here key moment of combat 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.150
 because I could also have so 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:28.880
 least I could go sticking a little bit more 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:31.850
 and now well if he behaved well but now 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:35.539
 I was quite surprised here because 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:38.509
 I would have endured oysters birds of 

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:40.400
 my mother yes yes yes yes i endured look 

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:42.800
 of this bird sado endure with that the 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.990
 parrot but with two balls he holds it is 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.490
 actor and the mt ultra fist to finish 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:48.770
 with that polygon that could give 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:51.860
 problems ended with the poor with two and 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:53.630
 now and it was with a 'drive to wave 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:55.070
 line for good to try to take away a 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:57.020
 little more of life to that damn heel 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:59.960
 flame because at the same time weakens it 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:01.760
 it does not help that yes yes there is perfect 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.190
 so here we really are already with 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:06.500
 quite advantage yes here and now 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:07.970
 combat point he simply had left 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:10.250
 elements that is by the way this 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:14.990
 element was very very hard to crack now 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:16.849
 you will see it and yes I think it was now mixed 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:20.000
 because I had good now you will see it yes 

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:22.460
 Exactly why you're going with us here 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.520
 it's good it was obvious megas elements very 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:27.380
 really is very good friend did the 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.910
 best move I could do it was yes 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:30.830
 with an earthquake 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:36.560
 to kill the two to kill both 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:41.240
 obviously the two was enough and 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:43.630
 well I did not stay to check if you 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.630
 they were left 

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:49.220
 here it was that I had double jealousy if here 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:51.070
 the fear was that he only went with 

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:53.360
 double edged because of a double edge 

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:55.430
 ended with me and that you failed in the 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:57.200
 that antonio hosts is that this would have 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:59.180
 been very heavy but here comes the 

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:02.870
 surprise of the combat and is that it was with 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:05.120
 flare and it's actor to test monbus the 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:07.520
 true that does not take away the same clear 

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:10.130
 dance is that the cinematic of the 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:12.380
 flare opea host yes and here we 

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:15.020
 we surprised not fuck canton anymore what 

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:17.270
 aguanto endured the good kart antonio 

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:19.310
 me to ensure itching out there is if 

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:21.080
 we have been spared from any hacks 

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:23.060
 that there could be because that only 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:25.760
 I say if I had gone with double edge wing 

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:27.160
 monbus and I would have missed the channel and 

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:29.350
 Mrs 

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:32.380
 and it's not me the fight could have given 

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:34.000
 a little if then he had that vision but 

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:37.330
 if there was an earthquake I would have done 

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.670
 damage but neither would have 

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:41.650
 weakened clear but good here 

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:43.360
 we ended up with the day if it was a good 

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:44.920
 Combat the truth very happy because 

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:46.660
 good so it was noticed that they 

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:48.820
 they were blended in plan played 

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:51.010
 like the spark that was pretty 

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:54.160
 good here is good for rays of the picacho 

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:55.940

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:57.830
 lightning the ice 

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:59.690
