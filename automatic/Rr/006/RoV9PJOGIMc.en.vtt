00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:05.190
 hello to everyone here nikolov and we get 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.240
 found for a new video enough 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.950
 special on minecraft pocket edition 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.840
 in which I will show you in 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.969
 a first time what it takes for 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:19.199
 to go to the desert and how to get there 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.910
 knowing that I never did them then 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:25.789
 the minecraft version under which I 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.789
 am the one at 0.5 zero point 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:31.640
 obviously the bug for unlocking a 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.340
 movie does not work anymore on this 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:37.720
 version there must be find his gold 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:40.940
 by itself and I'm in survival mode 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:43.610
 so I dug a big mine a 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:47.290
 pretty big mine that goes on that 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:50.330
 continued according to also down here 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:53.530
 so I put the little point for you 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:01:00.949
 see where I put my finger every time 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:01:02.629
 then you will need to create this 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:05.990
 block there the nether actors you will have 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:08.840
 need three diamonds and 2.6 ingots 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.880
 to do so it's not the hardest the 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:15.799
 harder to see 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:17.950
 it's these are the golden blocks knowing that 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:20.680
 nine languages ​​at the bottom a single block of gold 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.060
 here 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.370
 now I have everything I need 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.860
 to create the nether reactor you will 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:30.460
 need a caubel rate of four 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.710
 gold blocks and a heather reactor that 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.780
 is here 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.240
 that's it then I advise you to 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.650
 equip a sword at least make 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:43.330
 so I made a sword 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:43.990
 diamonds so here's well I'll go back 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:50.110
 on the surface 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:53.830
 and then we'll see what that gives then 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:58.350
 look at pretty much the depth for 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:02:01.240
 you make the diamond easier then that places 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:04.330
 less on average five blocks above 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:09.850
 the rock bay is here in these waters 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:13.120
 there is a result of the red stone 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:14.830
 you dig around and especially as soon as 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.959
 you see earth like that by 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.510
 example here or gravel you dig 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:23.800
 all the gravel usually around it 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:25.239
 there is gold or diamond here is the 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.400
 red stone for now she's not used to 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:29.709
 great thing in minecraft for you 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.330
 to say nothing for nothing any case me 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:31.890
 I did not manage to get any 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.940
 thing 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:45.600
 I did not manage to get any 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:48.230
 thing here so I'm finally out and 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.659
 I am going to go 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:53.840
 a little further still to create 

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:57.260
 the nose the reactor then is what I 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:01.220
 food yes I wanted it here 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:06.849
 so my world a little bit so he 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:12.230
 not all here here are going to create the 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:14.840
 generator of the hours so I 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.700
 take the opportunity to say hello to you 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.099
 subscribe if you like my video 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.060
 and then not if you have it if you 

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:24.319
 do not like it good and you still 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:25.879
 I want to tell you so bah it's done 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:28.099
 always happy to subscribe a little 

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:36.170
 green thumb also it's always 

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:38.230
 pleasure so then where am I going 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.230
 make 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:43.660
 it's really improvised that's why 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:45.600
 I did not find my place 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:49.710
 I should have looked for him before 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.710
 but hey it's not a big deal 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:56.740
 hello he's doing it here but it's not 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:59.190
 all right not perfect we found 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:59.190
 our place 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:11.230
 so here we are going to do it here then 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:16.680
 start by arranging your your blogs 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:19.720
 of gold to a tile each one the a1 the a1 the 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:22.480
 and then what you do 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:26.740
 you take your coble you make a 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:29.710
 cross with like this hop there hop there 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:32.680
 here you take you take the nether 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:38.770
 reactor you situate it in the middle as 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:43.350
 this you pick up your coble and so 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:49.450
 Then you cover it all by then 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:52.330
 here and then do not pay attention 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:56.440
 message you cover that like that as 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:05:01.000
 this is so it makes another cross 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:02.350
 but on our believe we see there and there 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.820
 all you have to do is support 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:06.130
 I pressed the block and you are 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:10.480
 in the desert so now there must be 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:14.890
 have stuff that pops up 

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:17.710
 that's what appears and full full 

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:22.770
 a lot of things appear and if I 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:25.900
 tape a pig what it's like 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:30.250
 guess it attacks me I think 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:31.630
 he wants to attack me already yes here and 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:35.950
 but I do not even take my sword 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:41.040
 diamond to the people a people to a dish 

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:43.450
 is flat do not hesitate to take everything 

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:45.800
 attention there may be who 

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:49.870
 therefore appear 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:53.770
 when you take the fungus here 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:58.580
 on the other hand what is really stupid 

00:05:53.770 --> 00:06:02.330
 that's it now when you 

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:03.729
 get out it's mostly dark and that's it 

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:05.659
 that there is in the middle of your map 

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:08.180
 so here I really advise you 

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:12.110
 not to do it next to your 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:14.040
 homes and apparently not recovering 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:17.470
 his 

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:19.449
 sounded the reactor so I'm going 

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:22.380
 it is to break this block to recover 

00:06:19.449 --> 00:06:24.520
 my character 

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:31.900
 thanks for that to take a little bit of 

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:36.820
 good time too bad it's going maybe eight 

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:38.830
 with that do not talk about it so in this 

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:42.610
 that I found in what I have 

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:46.900
 found so I had a bed of powder 

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:51.690
 like this is to make this powder 

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:56.050
 the deal case you know the block that him 

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:59.410
 in short, it serves to make this block there I 

00:06:56.050 --> 00:07:03.460
 had three gold bars so the cane to 

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:07.840
 cactus seed sugar a door a 

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:11.470
 book I had in the arrows I the 

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:13.180
 had already I had to have his 

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:15.419
 ingots there I think mushrooms I 

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:18.520
 I had them bow I had already 

00:07:15.419 --> 00:07:19.590
 in short so that's it can vary it can 

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:24.039
 vary 

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:27.580
 so that was a little video for 

00:07:24.039 --> 00:07:33.400
 show you how to create nether 

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:36.060
 reactor is so I will do I will put 

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:39.099
 in the subtitle I'm digging after 

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:42.639
 where there was the hour data block 

00:07:39.099 --> 00:07:44.530
 I'm going to dig in there and then I'll see 

00:07:42.639 --> 00:07:47.200
 if I can recover my block 

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:49.750
 so if I get it back I tell you 

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:51.419
 in you read in the description where I 

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:54.310
 you put a little video message 

00:07:51.419 --> 00:07:55.630
 and then it was nikolov for a 

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:56.950
 little video in minecraft 

00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:59.320
 how she is in the nether 

00:07:56.950 --> 00:08:02.550
 explanations all that all that 

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:02.550
 Hi everybody
