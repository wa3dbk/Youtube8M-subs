00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.379 
even really need it I just liked it i'm
using<00:00:34.139> the<00:00:34.350> limiter<00:00:34.679> as<00:00:34.829> a<00:00:34.859> gate<00:00:35.219> to<00:00:35.460> block<00:00:36.210> off

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:36.389 
using the limiter as a gate to block off

00:00:36.389 --> 00:00:39.229 
using the limiter as a gate to block off
room<00:00:36.659> noise<00:00:36.809> so<00:00:37.620> um<00:00:37.889> or<00:00:38.129> your<00:00:38.309> fan<00:00:38.579> or<00:00:38.909> computer

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
room noise so um or your fan or computer

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.520 
room noise so um or your fan or computer
fan<00:00:39.420> because<00:00:39.600> when<00:00:39.870> that<00:00:40.019> goes<00:00:40.229> through

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
fan because when that goes through

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.329 
fan because when that goes through
hardcore<00:00:41.429> um<00:00:41.989> then<00:00:42.989> you<00:00:43.109> don't<00:00:43.289> need<00:00:43.440> to<00:00:43.889> bring

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:44.339 
hardcore um then you don't need to bring

00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:46.819 
hardcore um then you don't need to bring
them<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.639> gate<00:00:45.049> function<00:00:46.049> which<00:00:46.469> is<00:00:46.649> always

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
them the gate function which is always

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.629 
them the gate function which is always
nice<00:00:47.100> and<00:00:48.170> gives<00:00:49.170> you<00:00:49.260> one<00:00:49.409> extra<00:00:49.649> pedal<00:00:49.889> so

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:50.639 
nice and gives you one extra pedal so

00:00:50.639 --> 00:00:54.079 
nice and gives you one extra pedal so
you<00:00:50.699> can<00:00:50.850> use<00:00:51.199> flanger<00:00:52.459> course<00:00:53.459> or<00:00:53.819> whatever

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:54.089 
you can use flanger course or whatever

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:56.660 
you can use flanger course or whatever
so<00:00:54.449> anyways<00:00:54.869> let's<00:00:55.079> start<00:00:55.949> from<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.219> basics

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
so anyways let's start from the basics

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.779 
so anyways let's start from the basics
okay<00:00:57.299> making<00:00:58.289> you<00:00:58.499> sound<00:00:59.459> like<00:00:59.699> a<00:00:59.760> guitar

00:01:01.779 --> 00:01:01.789 
okay making you sound like a guitar

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:04.520 
okay making you sound like a guitar
alright<00:01:02.789> so<00:01:03.029> first<00:01:03.209> thing<00:01:03.479> is<00:01:03.510> pitcher<00:01:04.260> and

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
alright so first thing is pitcher and

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.060 
alright so first thing is pitcher and
I'm<00:01:05.309> gonna<00:01:05.460> explain<00:01:05.700> why<00:01:05.880> we<00:01:06.060> need<00:01:06.210> pitcher<00:01:07.070> um

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
I'm gonna explain why we need pitcher um

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.179 
I'm gonna explain why we need pitcher um
you<00:01:08.430> don't<00:01:08.609> need<00:01:08.729> it<00:01:08.909> obviously<00:01:09.509> but<00:01:10.350> it<00:01:10.649> helps

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
you don't need it obviously but it helps

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.170 
you don't need it obviously but it helps
when<00:01:12.000> I'm<00:01:12.770> when<00:01:13.770> your<00:01:13.950> voice<00:01:14.130> when<00:01:14.759> we<00:01:14.909> use<00:01:15.060> our

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
when I'm when your voice when we use our

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.880 
when I'm when your voice when we use our
own<00:01:15.240> voices<00:01:15.799> we<00:01:16.799> have<00:01:17.009> quite<00:01:17.310> a<00:01:17.340> few<00:01:17.429> harmonics

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
own voices we have quite a few harmonics

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.370 
own voices we have quite a few harmonics
Lallana<00:01:19.890> right<00:01:20.399> that's<00:01:21.149> some<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:21.750> when<00:01:22.259> you

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
Lallana right that's some and when you

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.709 
Lallana right that's some and when you
like<00:01:22.619> look<00:01:22.859> at<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:23.009> guitar<00:01:23.429> it<00:01:24.000> has<00:01:24.119> very<00:01:24.359> few

00:01:24.709 --> 00:01:24.719 
like look at a guitar it has very few

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:27.740 
like look at a guitar it has very few
it's<00:01:25.020> almost<00:01:25.259> a<00:01:25.439> sine<00:01:25.740> wave<00:01:25.770> in<00:01:26.310> some<00:01:26.549> cases<00:01:26.820> so

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
it's almost a sine wave in some cases so

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.440 
it's almost a sine wave in some cases so
what<00:01:28.140> you<00:01:28.259> want<00:01:28.439> to<00:01:28.500> do<00:01:28.649> is<00:01:28.859> emulate<00:01:29.280> that<00:01:29.729> so

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
what you want to do is emulate that so

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.380 
what you want to do is emulate that so
when<00:01:31.200> you're<00:01:31.380> going<00:01:32.009> through<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.789> distortion

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
when you're going through the distortion

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.819 
when you're going through the distortion
module<00:01:33.840> you<00:01:34.829> want<00:01:35.009> to<00:01:35.070> be<00:01:35.189> very<00:01:35.820> ooh<00:01:36.060> and<00:01:36.719> I<00:01:37.079> or

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.580 
with your distortion module pudhu pudhu
it's<00:02:39.550> like<00:02:39.760> very<00:02:40.510> different<00:02:40.989> and<00:02:41.320> your

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
it's like very different and your

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.890 
it's like very different and your
harmonics<00:02:42.040> are<00:02:42.130> spread<00:02:42.550> differently<00:02:43.060> so<00:02:43.330> play

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
harmonics are spread differently so play

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.720 
harmonics are spread differently so play
with<00:02:44.080> the<00:02:44.170> format<00:02:44.530> I<00:02:44.709> prefer<00:02:45.010> the<00:02:45.190> higher<00:02:45.489> end

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
with the format I prefer the higher end

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.840 
with the format I prefer the higher end
for<00:02:46.030> men<00:02:46.320> um<00:02:47.320> because<00:02:47.950> it<00:02:48.280> just<00:02:48.430> makes<00:02:48.670> things

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
for men um because it just makes things

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.930 
for men um because it just makes things
sound<00:02:49.300> better<00:02:50.200> through<00:02:50.650> the<00:02:50.800> distortion<00:02:51.340> next

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
sound better through the distortion next

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.440 
sound better through the distortion next
up<00:02:52.090> we<00:02:52.330> have<00:02:52.360> our<00:02:52.720> hardcore<00:02:53.440> and<00:02:54.150> basically<00:02:55.150> I

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
up we have our hardcore and basically I

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.530 
up we have our hardcore and basically I
put<00:02:55.840> on<00:02:55.930> a<00:02:55.959> compressor<00:02:56.470> at<00:02:56.709> a<00:02:57.209> lowest<00:02:58.209> attack

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
put on a compressor at a lowest attack

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.229 
put on a compressor at a lowest attack
because<00:02:59.380> it<00:02:59.530> really<00:03:00.190> helps<00:03:00.280> with<00:03:00.610> the<00:03:00.670> low<00:03:00.970> end

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
because it really helps with the low end

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:04.650 
because it really helps with the low end
um<00:03:01.890> esas<00:03:02.890> and<00:03:03.250> peas<00:03:03.640> and<00:03:04.000> teas<00:03:04.239> that<00:03:04.269> come

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
um esas and peas and teas that come

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.780 
um esas and peas and teas that come
through<00:03:04.690> because<00:03:05.410> when<00:03:05.530> it<00:03:05.620> goes<00:03:05.739> it's<00:03:06.549> like

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
through because when it goes it's like

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.990 
through because when it goes it's like
you<00:03:07.060> get<00:03:07.209> a<00:03:07.239> rumble<00:03:07.750> okay<00:03:08.560> so<00:03:09.220> I'm<00:03:09.640> going<00:03:09.970> to

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
you get a rumble okay so I'm going to

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.420 
you get a rumble okay so I'm going to
just<00:03:10.060> enable<00:03:11.019> hardcore

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.699 

disable<00:03:14.430> everything<00:03:15.230> we're<00:03:16.230> gonna<00:03:16.319> start

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
disable everything we're gonna start

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:22.760 
disable everything we're gonna start
from<00:03:17.370> scratch<00:03:17.700> okay<00:03:18.680> eq<00:03:19.680> um<00:03:21.170> if<00:03:22.170> you're<00:03:22.380> mixing

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:22.770 
from scratch okay eq um if you're mixing

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:25.250 
from scratch okay eq um if you're mixing
it<00:03:22.890> into<00:03:23.069> a<00:03:23.220> song<00:03:23.580> i<00:03:23.880> get<00:03:24.510> rid<00:03:24.600> of<00:03:24.690> all<00:03:24.840> the<00:03:25.080> low

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
it into a song i get rid of all the low

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.350 
it into a song i get rid of all the low
end<00:03:25.410> almost<00:03:25.650> and<00:03:26.069> just<00:03:26.730> if<00:03:26.850> i<00:03:26.970> want<00:03:27.150> to<00:03:27.180> boost

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
end almost and just if i want to boost

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.600 
end almost and just if i want to boost
the<00:03:27.540> low<00:03:27.660> end<00:03:27.810> it's<00:03:28.080> gonna<00:03:28.260> be<00:03:28.500> just<00:03:29.010> these

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
the low end it's gonna be just these

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.390 
the low end it's gonna be just these
frequencies<00:03:30.239> around<00:03:30.360> here<00:03:30.690> 200<00:03:31.350> 500<00:03:31.950> hertz

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
frequencies around here 200 500 hertz

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.220 
frequencies around here 200 500 hertz
are<00:03:32.640> good<00:03:32.850> you<00:03:33.360> don't<00:03:33.450> want<00:03:33.660> too<00:03:33.750> much<00:03:33.870> of<00:03:34.050> this

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
are good you don't want too much of this

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:35.960 
are good you don't want too much of this
because<00:03:34.800> it's<00:03:34.980> gonna<00:03:35.100> just<00:03:35.340> swap<00:03:35.610> out<00:03:35.819> your

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
because it's gonna just swap out your

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.750 
because it's gonna just swap out your
mix<00:03:36.239> if<00:03:36.540> it's<00:03:37.050> a<00:03:37.680> lead<00:03:37.920> or<00:03:38.250> if<00:03:38.520> it's<00:03:38.610> like<00:03:38.670> a

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
mix if it's a lead or if it's like a

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.790 
mix if it's a lead or if it's like a
solo<00:03:39.209> kind<00:03:39.390> of<00:03:39.510> thing<00:03:39.720> you<00:03:40.200> can<00:03:40.350> have<00:03:40.470> a<00:03:40.500> bit<00:03:40.680> of

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800 
solo kind of thing you can have a bit of

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.090 
solo kind of thing you can have a bit of
bass<00:03:41.000> it'll<00:03:42.000> never<00:03:42.030> hurt<00:03:42.390> anything<00:03:42.690> um<00:03:43.500> one

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
bass it'll never hurt anything um one

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.979 
bass it'll never hurt anything um one
thing<00:03:44.130> you<00:03:44.370> gonna<00:03:44.790> worry<00:03:45.060> about<00:03:45.120> with<00:03:45.450> guitar

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
thing you gonna worry about with guitar

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:51.910 
thing you gonna worry about with guitar
and<00:03:46.230> distortion<00:03:46.739> is<00:03:47.090> sibilance<00:03:48.890> sibilance

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.190 

especially<00:03:52.920> when<00:03:53.040> you<00:03:53.160> use<00:03:53.970> your<00:03:54.150> the<00:03:54.690> back<00:03:54.900> s

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
especially when you use your the back s

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.160 
especially when you use your the back s
of<00:03:55.769> your<00:03:55.950> tongue<00:03:56.330> like<00:03:57.330> almost<00:03:57.569> like<00:03:57.690> a<00:03:57.840> lisp

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
of your tongue like almost like a lisp

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:01.850 
of your tongue like almost like a lisp
or<00:03:58.380> something<00:03:58.769> that<00:03:59.459> is<00:03:59.670> a<00:03:59.700> bad<00:04:00.650> frequency<00:04:01.650> to

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 
or something that is a bad frequency to

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.740 
or something that is a bad frequency to
go<00:04:02.069> through<00:04:02.340> this<00:04:02.489> torsion<00:04:02.940> so<00:04:03.390> that's<00:04:03.569> around

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
go through this torsion so that's around

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.800 
go through this torsion so that's around
eight<00:04:03.989> 8<00:04:04.260> kilohertz<00:04:04.739> for<00:04:05.370> 4000<00:04:06.330> or<00:04:06.420> four

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
eight 8 kilohertz for 4000 or four

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.530 
eight 8 kilohertz for 4000 or four
kilohertz<00:04:07.080> and<00:04:07.730> then<00:04:08.730> we<00:04:08.790> can<00:04:08.940> increase<00:04:09.360> our

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
kilohertz and then we can increase our

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.290 
kilohertz and then we can increase our
breath<00:04:09.810> a<00:04:09.959> little<00:04:10.050> bit<00:04:10.319> cuz<00:04:11.010> uh<00:04:11.150> sibilance<00:04:12.150> is

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:12.300 
breath a little bit cuz uh sibilance is

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:16.009 
breath a little bit cuz uh sibilance is
out<00:04:12.480> of<00:04:12.630> that<00:04:12.720> range<00:04:12.989> so<00:04:14.360> see<00:04:15.360> it's<00:04:15.480> much<00:04:15.660> much

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 
out of that range so see it's much much

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:18.530 
out of that range so see it's much much
better<00:04:16.260> just<00:04:16.829> by<00:04:17.040> reducing<00:04:17.519> these<00:04:17.729> two<00:04:18.269> and

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:18.540 
better just by reducing these two and

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:21.800 
better just by reducing these two and
that's<00:04:19.049> true<00:04:19.380> with<00:04:19.560> any<00:04:19.739> kind<00:04:20.250> of<00:04:20.400> like<00:04:20.910> any<00:04:21.239> eq

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
that's true with any kind of like any eq

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:25.370 
that's true with any kind of like any eq
it<00:04:22.290> sibilance<00:04:22.890> is<00:04:23.040> always<00:04:23.490> around<00:04:23.700> there<00:04:24.380> it's

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
it sibilance is always around there it's

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.279 
it sibilance is always around there it's
separate<00:04:25.950> from<00:04:26.190> the<00:04:26.310> actual<00:04:26.669> voice<00:04:27.419> so<00:04:28.200> you

00:04:28.279 --> 00:04:28.289 
separate from the actual voice so you

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:30.200 
separate from the actual voice so you
can<00:04:28.560> even<00:04:28.680> des<00:04:29.130> this<00:04:29.400> thing<00:04:29.669> before<00:04:29.850> it<00:04:30.060> goes

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
can even des this thing before it goes

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.930 
can even des this thing before it goes
through<00:04:30.539> um<00:04:31.050> I'm<00:04:31.860> not<00:04:32.010> going<00:04:32.220> to<00:04:32.340> cuz<00:04:32.640> I'm<00:04:32.760> just

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 
through um I'm not going to cuz I'm just

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.800 
through um I'm not going to cuz I'm just
gonna<00:04:33.060> use<00:04:33.930> boo<00:04:34.289> and<00:04:34.590> boo<00:04:35.370> and<00:04:35.729> uh<00:04:35.850> or<00:04:36.479> whatever

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
gonna use boo and boo and uh or whatever

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.740 
gonna use boo and boo and uh or whatever
right<00:04:37.080> so<00:04:37.830> anyways<00:04:38.250> um<00:04:38.640> i<00:04:39.090> like<00:04:39.360> to<00:04:39.720> use

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
right so anyways um i like to use

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.710 
right so anyways um i like to use
compressor<00:04:40.680> first<00:04:40.950> and<00:04:41.220> that'll<00:04:42.120> reduce<00:04:42.450> the

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
compressor first and that'll reduce the

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.150 
compressor first and that'll reduce the
volume<00:04:42.900> a<00:04:43.080> bit<00:04:43.110> so<00:04:43.590> we're<00:04:43.740> gonna<00:04:43.830> compensate

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 
volume a bit so we're gonna compensate

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.950 
volume a bit so we're gonna compensate
with<00:04:44.340> our<00:04:44.550> output<00:04:44.910> after<00:04:45.060> we<00:04:45.600> turn<00:04:45.840> on

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 
with our output after we turn on

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.409 
with our output after we turn on
distortion<00:04:46.850> what<00:04:47.850> I'm<00:04:48.000> gonna<00:04:48.120> try<00:04:48.270> on<00:04:48.330> those

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:48.419 
distortion what I'm gonna try on those

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:53.930 
distortion what I'm gonna try on those
stores<00:04:48.690> in<00:04:48.810> here<00:04:48.930> and<00:04:49.050> show<00:04:49.169> you<00:04:52.460> hmm<00:04:53.460> that's

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940 
stores in here and show you hmm that's

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:58.350 
stores in here and show you hmm that's
without<00:04:54.120> picture

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.070 

Oh

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 
Oh

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.210 
Oh
right<00:05:00.530> it's<00:05:01.099> a<00:05:01.750> oops<00:05:02.750> it<00:05:03.379> makes<00:05:03.860> a<00:05:03.979> difference

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:04.220 
right it's a oops it makes a difference

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:05.800 
right it's a oops it makes a difference
when<00:05:04.520> you<00:05:04.610> play<00:05:04.759> with<00:05:04.909> pitcher<00:05:05.360> because<00:05:05.659> it

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:05.810 
when you play with pitcher because it

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:07.869 
when you play with pitcher because it
flattens<00:05:06.680> out<00:05:06.770> those<00:05:06.979> harmonics<00:05:07.310> makes<00:05:07.759> it

00:05:07.869 --> 00:05:07.879 
flattens out those harmonics makes it

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:10.420 
flattens out those harmonics makes it
more<00:05:08.060> instrumental<00:05:08.629> rather<00:05:09.229> than<00:05:09.469> and<00:05:10.069> also

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:10.430 
more instrumental rather than and also

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:12.839 
more instrumental rather than and also
cuz<00:05:11.000> you<00:05:11.090> always<00:05:11.330> hit<00:05:11.599> the<00:05:11.659> notes<00:05:11.960> and

00:05:12.839 --> 00:05:12.849 
cuz you always hit the notes and

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:15.550 
cuz you always hit the notes and
everybody<00:05:13.849> it's<00:05:14.509> like<00:05:14.659> a<00:05:14.689> friend<00:05:15.020> instrument

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:15.560 
everybody it's like a friend instrument

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.709 
everybody it's like a friend instrument
when<00:05:16.039> you<00:05:16.129> go<00:05:16.280> when<00:05:16.639> you<00:05:16.729> on<00:05:16.969> a<00:05:17.000> guitar<00:05:17.210> and<00:05:17.629> you

00:05:17.709 --> 00:05:17.719 
when you go when you on a guitar and you

00:05:17.719 --> 00:05:23.050 
when you go when you on a guitar and you
move<00:05:17.900> up<00:05:18.110> a<00:05:18.229> fret<00:05:18.469> it's<00:05:18.680> not<00:05:18.800> like<00:05:21.280> mm-hmm<00:05:22.280> you

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:23.060 
move up a fret it's not like mm-hmm you

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:24.730 
move up a fret it's not like mm-hmm you
know<00:05:23.180> that's<00:05:23.389> not<00:05:23.449> a<00:05:23.569> guitar<00:05:23.930> a<00:05:24.139> guitar<00:05:24.349> is

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:24.740 
know that's not a guitar a guitar is

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:40.089 
know that's not a guitar a guitar is
very<00:05:24.949> Freddie<00:05:27.189> you<00:05:28.189> know<00:05:28.310> that's<00:05:35.740> even<00:05:39.099> mm

00:05:40.089 --> 00:05:40.099 
very Freddie you know that's even mm

00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:43.270 
very Freddie you know that's even mm
it's<00:05:40.550> like<00:05:40.789> more<00:05:41.500> mechanical<00:05:42.500> right<00:05:42.830> and

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:43.280 
it's like more mechanical right and

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:45.909 
it's like more mechanical right and
that's<00:05:43.610> what<00:05:43.819> a<00:05:43.879> guitar<00:05:44.180> is<00:05:44.330> a<00:05:44.539> machine<00:05:45.139> so

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:45.919 
that's what a guitar is a machine so

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:48.490 
that's what a guitar is a machine so
anyways<00:05:46.789> after<00:05:47.030> our<00:05:47.360> compressor<00:05:47.690> we<00:05:48.379> have

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:48.500 
anyways after our compressor we have

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:51.100 
anyways after our compressor we have
distortion<00:05:49.069> um<00:05:49.280> I<00:05:49.639> don't<00:05:50.509> like<00:05:50.659> to<00:05:50.690> use<00:05:50.810> too

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:51.110 
distortion um I don't like to use too

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:53.619 
distortion um I don't like to use too
much<00:05:51.229> distortion<00:05:51.889> because<00:05:52.240> we<00:05:53.240> have<00:05:53.389> a<00:05:53.419> lot<00:05:53.599> of

00:05:53.619 --> 00:05:53.629 
much distortion because we have a lot of

00:05:53.629 --> 00:05:55.689 
much distortion because we have a lot of
harmonics<00:05:54.139> in<00:05:54.229> our<00:05:54.379> voice<00:05:54.529> you<00:05:55.129> can<00:05:55.279> use<00:05:55.430> a<00:05:55.460> lot

00:05:55.689 --> 00:05:55.699 
harmonics in our voice you can use a lot

00:05:55.699 --> 00:05:57.040 
harmonics in our voice you can use a lot
when<00:05:55.849> you're<00:05:56.029> using<00:05:56.210> a<00:05:56.389> real<00:05:56.539> guitar<00:05:56.659> because

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:57.050 
when you're using a real guitar because

00:05:58.689 --> 00:05:58.699 
there's not a lot of harmonics going

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:06.640 
there's not a lot of harmonics going
through<00:05:58.909> it<00:05:59.349> combo<00:06:00.349> is<00:06:00.500> a<00:06:00.529> nice<00:06:00.800> tub<00:06:01.159> nice

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:06.650 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:10.430

so distortion Colonel oh and you can
make<00:06:10.590> up<00:06:10.740> for<00:06:10.770> that<00:06:11.010> actually<00:06:11.550> you<00:06:11.610> could<00:06:11.700> put

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:11.820 
make up for that actually you could put

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:14.090 
make up for that actually you could put
a<00:06:11.850> chorus<00:06:12.300> instead<00:06:13.140> of<00:06:13.380> his<00:06:13.470> modulator<00:06:14.010> which

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:14.100 
a chorus instead of his modulator which

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:40.459 
a chorus instead of his modulator which
is<00:06:14.430> really<00:06:14.730> cool<00:06:15.030> sounding

00:06:40.459 --> 00:06:40.469
