00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:08.320
 I want to show you this steel thermos 

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.420
 high capacity stainless steel is going to 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.100
 allow to keep hot liquids or 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:15.280
 cold during a lot of 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:17.740
 time we are talking about that retains the 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.800
 temperature if we add a hot tea 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:22.779
 for example we add it to 95 degrees and to 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.089
 24 hours a day we would have a decrease of 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:27.550
 temperature would drop to 70 so 

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:30.880
 both this canned bacteria very well 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:33.480
 the temperature is worth the way 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.430
 use it then it is very simple 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.770
 this little person here we raise the 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.570
 lid for demonstrating that it has opening 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.760
 great capacity if we wanted to 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.800
 keep the cold add ice yes that 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:48.170
 Will stand the coolest drink 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:51.230
 we do not come with our skill that 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:53.840
 we prefer to do 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:57.260
 and no ice 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:59.750
 we cover it and close it 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.180
 would transport we go to the site that 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:05.059
 we needed and once we got it 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:07.000
 to use very simple we open the 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:12.520
 safe 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:16.829
 we place the cup we press gently 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.829
 and filling the cup with the liquid 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:29.990
 there we have it ideal for coffee shops 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.780
 restaurants spa hotels room 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:35.320
 meetings 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:37.170
 companies forward tea vendors 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.570
 general conclusions 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.189
 in this case the 2.5 was shown 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.700
 liters although we have it also in 3 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:47.600
 liters and in 3.5 liters I hope that you 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.600
 have liked the product
