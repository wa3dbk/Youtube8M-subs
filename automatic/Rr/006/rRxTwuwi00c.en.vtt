that is difficult it's not physically

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:06.259 
easy to make a mess but to allow

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:08.350 
easy to make a mess but to allow
yourself<00:02:06.860> to<00:02:07.009> make<00:02:07.159> a<00:02:07.189> mess<00:02:07.490> it's<00:02:08.030> hard

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
yourself to make a mess it's hard

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.510 
yourself to make a mess it's hard
psychologically<00:02:09.350> because<00:02:09.770> we<00:02:09.979> don't<00:02:10.220> want<00:02:10.430> to

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
psychologically because we don't want to

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:11.920 
psychologically because we don't want to
make<00:02:10.640> a<00:02:10.700> mess<00:02:11.000> we<00:02:11.210> want<00:02:11.420> to<00:02:11.510> make<00:02:11.630> a<00:02:11.660> beautiful

make a mess we want to make a beautiful
painting<00:02:12.610> so<00:02:13.610> I<00:02:14.150> think<00:02:14.510> you<00:02:14.840> really<00:02:15.050> need<00:02:15.260> to

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
painting so I think you really need to

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.410 
painting so I think you really need to
practice<00:02:16.010> a<00:02:16.160> lot<00:02:16.340> of<00:02:16.400> different<00:02:16.910> techniques

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
practice a lot of different techniques

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:23.280 
practice a lot of different techniques
that<00:02:17.780> help<00:02:18.710> you<00:02:19.010> to<00:02:19.580> get<00:02:19.820> confident<00:02:20.540> with

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.320 

having<00:02:24.290> control<00:02:24.709> over<00:02:24.769> the<00:02:25.220> medium<00:02:25.580> but<00:02:26.209> on

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
having control over the medium but on

with<00:02:34.170> a<00:02:35.480> quick<00:02:36.480> sketch<00:02:36.810> which<00:02:37.800> I<00:02:38.069> say<00:02:38.910> should

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
with a quick sketch which I say should

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.670 
with a quick sketch which I say should
take<00:02:39.630> less<00:02:39.990> than<00:02:40.020> five<00:02:40.470> minutes<00:02:40.940> where<00:02:42.680> you

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
take less than five minutes where you

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.350 
take less than five minutes where you
don't<00:02:43.920> think<00:02:45.170> just<00:02:46.170> put<00:02:46.860> get<00:02:47.520> in<00:02:47.640> and<00:02:47.790> out<00:02:47.880> down

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
don't think just put get in and out down

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.650 
don't think just put get in and out down
and<00:02:48.570> down<00:02:49.470> and<00:02:49.530> dirty<00:02:49.890> and<00:02:50.220> just<00:02:50.820> do<00:02:51.120> it<00:02:51.270> don't

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
and down and dirty and just do it don't

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.330 
and down and dirty and just do it don't
think<00:02:51.750> about<00:02:51.959> it<00:02:52.290> and<00:02:52.470> then<00:02:53.040> save<00:02:53.310> your

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
think about it and then save your

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.320 
think about it and then save your
thought<00:02:54.300> process<00:02:54.840> for<00:02:55.050> the<00:02:55.170> real<00:02:55.350> painting

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
thought process for the real painting

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.900 
thought process for the real painting
let's<00:02:57.330> see<00:02:57.540> what<00:02:57.810> are<00:02:57.930> some<00:02:58.140> others<00:02:58.910> blind

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
let's see what are some others blind

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.370 
let's see what are some others blind
contour<00:03:00.300> drawing<00:03:01.140> is<00:03:02.300> excellent<00:03:03.300> it<00:03:03.750> helps

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
contour drawing is excellent it helps

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.140 
contour drawing is excellent it helps
you<00:03:04.530> to<00:03:04.680> see<00:03:04.920> what's<00:03:05.220> really<00:03:05.430> there<00:03:05.820> rather

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
you to see what's really there rather

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.979 
you to see what's really there rather
than<00:03:06.269> what<00:03:06.690> you're<00:03:07.790> right<00:03:08.790> excuse<00:03:09.720> me<00:03:09.870> your

than what you're right excuse me your
left<00:03:10.200> brain<00:03:10.440> thinks<00:03:11.010> you<00:03:11.370> remember<00:03:11.910> about

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
left brain thinks you remember about

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:17.509 
left brain thinks you remember about
that<00:03:12.209> subject<00:03:12.720> and<00:03:14.090> I<00:03:15.709> will<00:03:16.709> take<00:03:16.980> that<00:03:17.190> a<00:03:17.250> step

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
that subject and I will take that a step

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:24.140 
that subject and I will take that a step
farther<00:03:18.290> and<00:03:19.580> actually<00:03:20.580> do<00:03:21.410> blind<00:03:22.670> drawing<00:03:23.670> or

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
farther and actually do blind drawing or

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.840 
farther and actually do blind drawing or
blind<00:03:24.510> painting<00:03:25.320> on<00:03:25.530> my<00:03:25.769> on<00:03:26.220> the<00:03:26.280> real

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
blind painting on my on the real

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
painting not just as a warm-up so I've

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.390 
painting not just as a warm-up so I've
got<00:03:30.989> this<00:03:31.200> piece<00:03:31.470> of<00:03:31.650> sketch<00:03:31.860> paper<00:03:32.100> right

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
got this piece of sketch paper right

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.330 
got this piece of sketch paper right
here<00:03:32.640> so<00:03:32.880> I<00:03:32.910> can<00:03:33.180> show<00:03:33.390> you<00:03:33.450> what<00:03:33.750> I<00:03:33.780> mean<00:03:34.340> so

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340

I'm<00:03:36.060> going<00:03:36.870> to<00:03:38.450> look<00:03:39.450> at<00:03:39.630> the<00:03:40.790> look<00:03:41.790> at<00:03:41.910> the

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
I'm going to look at the look at the

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:48.319 
I'm going to look at the look at the
reference<00:03:43.200> and<00:03:44.660> place<00:03:45.660> my<00:03:45.989> brush<00:03:46.670> and<00:03:47.670> then<00:03:48.299> I

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.329 
reference and place my brush and then I

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:51.650 
reference and place my brush and then I
will<00:03:48.780> move<00:03:49.230> the<00:03:49.440> brush<00:03:50.150> only<00:03:51.150> when<00:03:51.480> I'm

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
will move the brush only when I'm

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:56.060 
will move the brush only when I'm
looking<00:03:51.900> at<00:03:52.530> the<00:03:52.799> reference<00:03:54.049> not<00:03:55.049> at<00:03:55.350> my<00:03:55.530> paper

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.070 
looking at the reference not at my paper

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:58.880 
looking at the reference not at my paper
so<00:03:57.000> then<00:03:57.150> I'll<00:03:57.239> look<00:03:57.420> back<00:03:57.630> at<00:03:57.840> the<00:03:57.959> paper<00:03:58.200> or

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
so then I'll look back at the paper or

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:03.470 
so then I'll look back at the paper or
the<00:03:58.950> canvas<00:03:59.489> whichever<00:04:00.209> the<00:04:01.200> case<00:04:01.230> may<00:04:01.470> be<00:04:02.480> do

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
the canvas whichever the case may be do

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.800 
the canvas whichever the case may be do
a<00:04:03.510> little<00:04:03.720> more<00:04:03.959> maybe<00:04:04.950> add<00:04:05.250> a<00:04:05.280> little<00:04:05.810> more

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
a little more maybe add a little more

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.930 
a little more maybe add a little more
color<00:04:07.079> a<00:04:07.620> little<00:04:07.890> different<00:04:08.400> color<00:04:08.579> I<00:04:08.670> should

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
color a little different color I should

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:16.569 
color a little different color I should
say<00:04:09.209> well<00:04:09.840> yellow<00:04:10.170> maybe<00:04:11.510> and<00:04:13.310> if<00:04:14.310> you<00:04:14.579> do<00:04:14.820> this

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:16.579 
say well yellow maybe and if you do this

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:21.140 
say well yellow maybe and if you do this
you<00:04:17.579> ought<00:04:17.820> to<00:04:17.850> obviously<00:04:18.750> start<00:04:19.669> by<00:04:20.669> doing<00:04:20.940> it

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
you ought to obviously start by doing it

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.790 
you ought to obviously start by doing it
on<00:04:21.269> a<00:04:21.299> piece<00:04:21.450> of<00:04:21.600> sketch<00:04:21.840> paper<00:04:23.720> before<00:04:24.720> you

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 
on a piece of sketch paper before you

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:31.010 
on a piece of sketch paper before you
get<00:04:27.979> or<00:04:28.979> until<00:04:29.400> you<00:04:29.729> get<00:04:29.970> more<00:04:30.419> comfortable

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
get or until you get more comfortable

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:35.529 
get or until you get more comfortable
with<00:04:31.200> the<00:04:31.320> idea<00:04:31.470> of<00:04:31.890> it<00:04:32.600> and<00:04:33.600> you'll<00:04:34.320> find<00:04:34.680> that

00:04:35.529 --> 00:04:35.539 
with the idea of it and you'll find that

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:41.140 
with the idea of it and you'll find that
painting<00:04:36.539> without<00:04:37.380> looking<00:04:37.800> at<00:04:38.010> your<00:04:38.039> paper

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.490 

you<00:04:42.150> can<00:04:42.330> probably<00:04:42.600> tell<00:04:42.960> while<00:04:43.290> we're

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 
you can probably tell while we're

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.969 
you can probably tell while we're
talking<00:04:43.850> that<00:04:44.850> I'm<00:04:45.419> finding<00:04:46.020> it<00:04:46.290> difficult<00:04:46.320> to

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:46.979 
talking that I'm finding it difficult to

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:50.360 
talking that I'm finding it difficult to
talk<00:04:47.190> because<00:04:47.940> it<00:04:48.210> takes<00:04:48.509> you<00:04:49.160> takes<00:04:50.160> your

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.370 
talk because it takes you takes your

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:54.650 
talk because it takes you takes your
thinking<00:04:50.940> from<00:04:51.419> your<00:04:52.160> verbal<00:04:53.160> side<00:04:53.490> over<00:04:54.150> into

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:54.660 
thinking from your verbal side over into

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.719 
thinking from your verbal side over into
the<00:04:54.990> more<00:04:55.139> creative<00:04:55.650> right<00:04:55.979> side<00:04:56.280> your<00:04:56.460> brain

00:04:56.719 --> 00:04:56.729 
the more creative right side your brain

00:04:56.729 --> 00:05:02.950 
the more creative right side your brain
and<00:04:57.000> it's<00:04:57.509> really<00:04:57.900> hard<00:04:58.199> to<00:04:58.530> talk<00:04:59.690> so<00:05:00.690> that<00:05:01.110> I

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:02.960 
and it's really hard to talk so that I

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.600 
and it's really hard to talk so that I
think<00:05:03.960> is<00:05:04.650> a<00:05:04.860> wonderful<00:05:05.840> exercise<00:05:06.840> but<00:05:07.530> also

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:07.610 
think is a wonderful exercise but also

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:10.820 
think is a wonderful exercise but also
something<00:05:08.610> that<00:05:08.850> you<00:05:09.090> can<00:05:09.270> do<00:05:09.660> let's<00:05:10.650> see

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:10.830 
something that you can do let's see

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:12.650 
something that you can do let's see
let's<00:05:11.070> go<00:05:11.280> over<00:05:11.430> here<00:05:11.699> or<00:05:11.850> just<00:05:12.030> a<00:05:12.180> little<00:05:12.509> bit

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:12.660 
let's go over here or just a little bit

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:16.640 
let's go over here or just a little bit
more<00:05:13.940> there's<00:05:14.940> some<00:05:15.120> red<00:05:15.360> in<00:05:15.570> there<00:05:15.780> I<00:05:16.080> think

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:16.650 
more there's some red in there I think

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:18.860 
more there's some red in there I think
you<00:05:16.770> really<00:05:16.919> get<00:05:17.250> yourself<00:05:17.639> going<00:05:17.750> when<00:05:18.750> you

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:18.870 
you really get yourself going when you

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:21.379 
you really get yourself going when you
do<00:05:19.020> that<00:05:19.610> so<00:05:20.610> I<00:05:20.639> do<00:05:20.789> that<00:05:21.060> in<00:05:21.090> the<00:05:21.240> actual

00:05:21.379 --> 00:05:21.389 
do that so I do that in the actual

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:27.170 
do that so I do that in the actual
painting<00:05:23.300> oil<00:05:24.470> acrylic<00:05:25.470> and<00:05:25.710> even<00:05:26.669> watercolor

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:27.180 
painting oil acrylic and even watercolor

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.379 
painting oil acrylic and even watercolor
even<00:05:27.840> watercolor<00:05:28.680> I<00:05:28.770> say<00:05:29.160> even<00:05:29.550> because<00:05:29.940> of

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:30.389 
even watercolor I say even because of

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:33.080 
even watercolor I say even because of
course<00:05:30.750> you<00:05:31.039> make<00:05:32.039> a<00:05:32.070> mess<00:05:32.400> and<00:05:32.430> watercolor

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:33.090 
course you make a mess and watercolor

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:36.439 
course you make a mess and watercolor
and<00:05:33.419> you<00:05:33.630> maybe<00:05:34.229> not<00:05:34.530> be<00:05:35.190> able<00:05:35.520> to<00:05:35.699> retrieve<00:05:36.240> it

00:05:36.439 --> 00:05:36.449 
and you maybe not be able to retrieve it

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:39.830 
and you maybe not be able to retrieve it
quite<00:05:36.870> as<00:05:37.080> easily<00:05:37.740> but<00:05:38.370> I<00:05:38.669> still<00:05:39.330> do<00:05:39.539> it<00:05:39.570> maybe

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:39.840 
quite as easily but I still do it maybe

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.700 
quite as easily but I still do it maybe
just<00:05:39.960> a<00:05:40.229> little<00:05:40.560> more<00:05:40.710> controlled<00:05:41.190> manner<00:05:41.490> I

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:42.710 
just a little more controlled manner I

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:45.890 
just a little more controlled manner I
personally<00:05:43.710> feel<00:05:44.009> like<00:05:44.210> if<00:05:45.210> you<00:05:45.419> learn<00:05:45.690> the

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:45.900 
personally feel like if you learn the

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:49.279 
personally feel like if you learn the
nuts<00:05:46.110> and<00:05:46.260> bolts<00:05:47.300> your<00:05:48.300> own<00:05:48.419> painting<00:05:48.840> style

00:05:49.279 --> 00:05:49.289 
nuts and bolts your own painting style

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:53.839 
nuts and bolts your own painting style
will<00:05:49.500> emerge<00:05:50.510> so<00:05:51.510> we<00:05:52.260> all<00:05:52.410> have<00:05:52.680> this<00:05:52.949> vision<00:05:53.340> I

00:05:53.839 --> 00:05:53.849 
will emerge so we all have this vision I

00:05:53.849 --> 00:05:56.659 
will emerge so we all have this vision I
don't<00:05:54.479> care<00:05:54.690> whether<00:05:54.870> you've<00:05:55.199> you've<00:05:56.159> picked

00:05:56.659 --> 00:05:56.669 
don't care whether you've you've picked

00:05:56.669 --> 00:05:58.610 
don't care whether you've you've picked
up<00:05:56.849> the<00:05:57.000> brush<00:05:57.240> for<00:05:57.510> the<00:05:57.630> first<00:05:57.870> time<00:05:58.199> or

00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:58.620 
up the brush for the first time or

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:01.939 
up the brush for the first time or
you're<00:05:58.800> a<00:05:58.830> veteran<00:05:59.430> we<00:06:00.419> all<00:06:00.599> have<00:06:00.930> this<00:06:01.199> image

00:06:01.939 --> 00:06:01.949 
you're a veteran we all have this image

00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:05.300 
you're a veteran we all have this image
in<00:06:02.159> our<00:06:02.250> mind<00:06:02.930> it<00:06:03.930> may<00:06:04.169> be<00:06:04.229> a<00:06:04.409> vague<00:06:04.680> image<00:06:05.070> but

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:05.310 
in our mind it may be a vague image but

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:07.159 
in our mind it may be a vague image but
we<00:06:05.400> have<00:06:05.610> this<00:06:05.789> image<00:06:06.270> of<00:06:06.449> what<00:06:06.630> we'd<00:06:06.780> like<00:06:06.960> our

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:07.169 
we have this image of what we'd like our

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:10.159 
we have this image of what we'd like our
paintings<00:06:07.650> to<00:06:07.800> look<00:06:07.979> like<00:06:08.449> and<00:06:09.449> then<00:06:09.780> when<00:06:10.050> it

00:06:10.159 --> 00:06:10.169 
paintings to look like and then when it

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:13.510 
paintings to look like and then when it
doesn't<00:06:10.680> the<00:06:11.430> disappointment<00:06:12.360> is<00:06:12.510> crushing

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:13.520 
doesn't the disappointment is crushing

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.670 
doesn't the disappointment is crushing
but<00:06:14.520> I<00:06:14.550> think<00:06:14.970> your<00:06:15.150> skills<00:06:15.510> have<00:06:15.930> to<00:06:16.169> catch<00:06:16.380> up

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:16.680 
but I think your skills have to catch up

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.890 
but I think your skills have to catch up
with<00:06:16.710> that<00:06:16.919> vision<00:06:17.460> if<00:06:18.240> you<00:06:18.360> don't<00:06:18.570> have<00:06:18.750> the

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:18.900 
with that vision if you don't have the

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:20.899 
with that vision if you don't have the
skills<00:06:19.229> you're<00:06:19.530> not<00:06:19.680> going<00:06:19.889> to<00:06:19.949> be<00:06:20.070> able<00:06:20.159> to

00:06:20.899 --> 00:06:20.909 
skills you're not going to be able to

00:06:20.909 --> 00:06:23.779 
skills you're not going to be able to
attain<00:06:21.870> that<00:06:22.289> vision<00:06:22.889> unless<00:06:23.159> it's<00:06:23.430> just<00:06:23.490> a

00:06:23.779 --> 00:06:23.789 
attain that vision unless it's just a

00:06:23.789 --> 00:06:25.520 
attain that vision unless it's just a
fluke<00:06:24.090> and<00:06:24.300> we<00:06:24.479> do<00:06:24.630> have<00:06:24.840> flute<00:06:25.110> paintings

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:25.530 
fluke and we do have flute paintings

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:28.670 
fluke and we do have flute paintings
every<00:06:25.800> once<00:06:25.979> in<00:06:26.099> a<00:06:26.190> while<00:06:26.479> so<00:06:27.479> I<00:06:28.020> think<00:06:28.380> you

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:28.680 
every once in a while so I think you

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.649 
every once in a while so I think you
just<00:06:28.710> need<00:06:28.949> to<00:06:29.070> practice<00:06:29.400> the<00:06:29.820> basics<00:06:30.300> until

00:06:30.649 --> 00:06:30.659 
just need to practice the basics until

00:06:30.659 --> 00:06:32.120 
just need to practice the basics until
you<00:06:30.840> know<00:06:31.020> them<00:06:31.229> frontwards<00:06:31.889> and<00:06:32.039> backwards

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:32.130 
you know them frontwards and backwards

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:36.020 
you know them frontwards and backwards
and<00:06:32.789> tell<00:06:33.180> you<00:06:33.510> they<00:06:33.900> just<00:06:34.340> come<00:06:35.340> out<00:06:35.370> without

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:36.030 
and tell you they just come out without

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:46.719 
and tell you they just come out without
you<00:06:36.180> thinking<00:06:36.389> about<00:06:36.690> it

00:06:46.719 --> 00:06:46.729 

00:06:46.729 --> 00:06:48.789 

you
