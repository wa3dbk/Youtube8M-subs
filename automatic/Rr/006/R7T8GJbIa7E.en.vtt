00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:10.340
 the sight was on Friday 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.960
 topper against PSV but also on the keepers 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:14.270
 jasper cillessen replaces the suspended 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:17.539
 Kenneth Vermeer Chiel Kramer takes them 

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:22.369
 place on the bench I think not 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:24.289
 Cramer good all year round 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:27.320
 made a stable impression on the training sessions 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:29.570
 because company but I think only one 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:34.040
 knew typed and but who's just 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:35.900
 a charity man who has certain rest 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:40.270
 I think 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:41.899
 and if you have the entrance then you should too 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:45.050
 radiate 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:46.820
 vanda that choice and like an ordinary one 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.800
 just try it of course 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.859
 to have to prepare that relaxed 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.789
 of course 120 would not go like this 

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:54.530
 it is of course not just one 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:56.180
 game you just go to the bank 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.219
 sitting will just take care of him 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.350
 try to make it as relaxed as possible 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:01.940
 can prepare by himself and that he 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.769
 mainly because the whole enjoy 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.630
 selection prepare so relaxed 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:07.610
 before you forget her in it 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.260
 squatting on the doorstep everyone lives 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.930
 relaxed to the duel 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:14.600
 yes it can say atmosphere is natural 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:17.030
 well we notice that was as a team in it 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.920
 have a good flow and I have to say 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.380
 to do the familiar address and rays 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:24.320
 I also look forward to this week's training sessions 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.360
 pressure is mainly with psv-ajax salt 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.340
 worst Santa Claus stress 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:32.420
 Sinterklaas tension still heard so 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:34.610
 but no i with us there is also one 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.399
 certain pressure whether it is sessions one 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.710
 certain voltage i call it voltage 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:42.040
 I think that's good 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:44.020
 for my team to step around each other 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.060
 stay sharp 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.740
 So a certain voltage is good 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.000
 only if that becomes too much then it becomes 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.040
 stress it 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.759
 I do not know if PSV suffer from that too 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:56.710
 has here or if have any case 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:59.050
 enough chance to still be champion of course 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.190
 we also have a healthy tension and 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.800
 We know it's a blast 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.300
 important competition is a good me 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.300
 think that pressure is indeed not the good 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:09.069
 word is a living all very bad 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.959
 relax more frankly and we 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:12.780
 know what it asks for such that was too 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:15.250
 of course that is also last year 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.769
 played and some duel looks too 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.780
 really went on of course and well it is 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:21.400
 just an i something that we that we 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.540
 on Sunday she was there such a 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.519
 play an important game 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.680
 dark christian paul she can be sunday again 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:28.780
 he starts playing in the 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.420
 basically he just played well 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:34.030
 listen and i guess what you do 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.680
 rightly they play with that experience 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.560
 what becomes a question in that kind of competition 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.190
 with you can find those goopes well 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.840
 own 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.840
 own place so everyone outside 

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:49.540
 I don't know if you can tell if you like it 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:53.049
 championship point can play safely or 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:54.459
 for or or really put it out of your mind 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:55.780
 depends on the result i think so 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:58.450
 a very important step at the time 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:01.060
 is of course in his after this match 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.890
 four more if I'm right one 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.200
 and well then we think I and that may 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.000
 is giving hands and that is natural 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.890
 only inherent to a good 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.120
 result in eindhoven I think and we 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.190
 just go there full for profit and 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.890
 then there are four very important ones 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.720
 play and a lot of weeks and I have 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.030
 certainly trust that we will finish it well 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.170
 can close if you win you see 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.600
 very big step to the championship 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:24.340
 if you flies bcrs this first is it 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.730
 also a gevaert you two day two 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:29.109
 thoughts can start linking everyone knows 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.630
 of course that it is with us one 

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:33.310
 where we are not the team I think 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.480
 days off while we just go 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.299
 for the win 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.280
 and I don't think it suits us 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:41.170
 to say yes if a man is something 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.390
 lose then it is also good 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.950
 we go there i think that name is for us 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.680
 there are there I think not the 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.959
 plow for 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.969
 we just go as we always and everywhere 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:52.250
 just do it for the weather player too 

00:03:49.969 --> 00:03:53.870
 then some that case is for what 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.760
 match you expect there pc think 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.500
 your plenty of gas flat do you think it's one 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.299
 competition must meet is to see 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.620
 you do it for you 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:02.030
 but I think that's the first one 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.159
 I think twenty minutes as important 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:06.500
 are they of course playing for one 

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:08.359
 The audience that would be unguided 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:11.480
 fully stand behind natural and 

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:12.859
 will certainly be encouraged to him 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.750
 good pressure with us 

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:17.030
 I think we will be the first ones 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:18.889
 proper stage as we get through 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:21.410
 also that it have the chance to us 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:22.759
 to play our own game and they 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:24.620
 will of course have building moments 

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:26.180
 of putting pressure but also knows that 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:28.250
 that the team is of course also free 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.509
 can play fairly conservatively and say joost 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:32.030
 I am in the counter so we have to 

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:35.000
 I definitely think before watching 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:36.580
 do you have the absolute as in Sunday half past four 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.680
 think it's a wonderful time to play 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:41.120
 nice weather so all ingredients 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.389
 think to get a good result 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.389
 can put
