00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.980
 the big live of the news with the guest 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.600
 10:45 am will be a step that is camille 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.830
 gruhier who is a specialist journalist 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.320
 new technologies to choose 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.090
 since as usual the magazine 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.950
 whose number for the mud month of March comes 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.750
 to appear and analyze the 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.470
 novelties first in terms of 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.869
 smartphone 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.520
 camille gruhier hello hello thank you 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.380
 a lot of being live with us on 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.240
 europe 1 then first findings 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.859
 already finally I have the feeling 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.500
 that today there is no longer any 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.670
 bad smartphones look at me really 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.619
 interest that we now find 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.540
 models that offers all-round performance 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.710
 actually correct to loans at all 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.980
 really dropped lately 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.930
 so yes from 150 euros find 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.160
 smartphones that run the 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.410
 is amazing that prices are 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.680
 very variable from one smartphone to another 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.110
 in your test we go from 130 euros to 919 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.700
 euros for a smartphone is what the 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.870
 more expensive are necessarily the best 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.550
 and no 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:58.230
 the most expensive are the most fashionable 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.670
 quote him the marks that started 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.280
 this morning so go ahead clean dad 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.680
 beaded more expensive apple not to them 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.270
 So quote the apple iphone that has you 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.680
 economic plus these are credence 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.869
 mar fall let's not allow the best in 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.710
 everything and yet their prices could 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.689
 to suggest the opposite 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.330
 in fact we chose four times 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.920
 introduce you to the smartphones that offer to 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.650
 the particular interest carried no which are 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.880
 the last parties but those who are 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.710
 the best in something 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.119
 apple iphone in this case are 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.259
 the best in regards to the 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.939
 quality of their screens that stays when 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.700
 even significantly above average 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.320
 and then counting the videos so we 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.250
 will take the rankings both 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.250
 first of the ranking 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.680
 it's the same samsung brand and yes and 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.600
 hans jung who wins the 1st mark the 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.619
 first place by donguy palmares because 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.439
 that it's a phone are 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.729
 technologically hyper ended with the 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.930
 latest functions all 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.670
 last components and that it takes 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.630
 recognize that samsung is clinking 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.939
 city names for a very long time 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.220
 and that this works perfectly 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.530
 so the first one is samsung 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.390
 galaxy note 4 the second is the 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.500
 Samsung Galaxy S 5 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.750
 and then have to wait for the third 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.509
 position to arrive both iphone 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.920
 iphone 6 plus and iphone so what is this 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.860
 that they have less than samsung at 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.910
 background I know a little bit I know that 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.500
 I'm fine it's the fact that he is 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.940
 rare environment very closed since 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.100
 you know that to synchronize his 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.950
 iphone it takes 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.630
 radical plug a computer everything is 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.910
 a little locked while sensing 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.770
 it's more open much freer and 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.080
 then we like you too the quality 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:26.360
 of the samsung screen which is I think a 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.690
 among the few that can compete with 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.790
 apple on on the calculations the screen 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.170
 autonomy autonomy has pretty much counted 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.910
 for for his motion to pick up the 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.620
 first place since it allows to 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.360
 call 20 hours both years the 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.160
 below reclassification can 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.050
 allow to call more than 20 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.550
 hours so that's starting to really 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.230
 a lot and is what we discover 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.330
 also in your investigation is that 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.880
 there are really cheap phones 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.050
 I think the so-called 4G butter at the weekend 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.960
 bus as it is not this mark 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:56.660
 by the way, which costs 130 euros or 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.900
 the sony xperia m2 what does it cost 200 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.250
 euros 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.200
 and finally they do not fare so well 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.180
 badly that that's it yeah they're doing it 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.840
 pretty well so it's covered but that 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:07.160
 will never do to follow the best 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.560
 someone who is not hyper demanding in 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.970
 Regarding the quality of the photos or 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.200
 regarding the very last 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.210
 nfc technologies 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.310
 as far as it goes 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:19.610
 very advanced functions very well that you 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.980
 could make a smartphone to 30 130 150 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.240
 euros today 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.500
 the advice you give to people who 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:26.180
 want to change smartphone 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.670
 it is necessary first to define perhaps 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.770
 what are you going to use your smartphone 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.600
 exactly this is the priority and a 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:34.460
 photo and the photo must absolutely 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.290
 watch the performances of crippen in 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:37.420
 photo that is ultra variable a model 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.010
 to the other 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.120
 the priority is to hang the 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.740
 network for example if we do not have 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.390
 a lot of if you live in an area 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:46.460
 which is poorly covered down at that time 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:48.110
 will really have to privilege the whole 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:49.940
 phone sensitivity to the train network 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:51.320
 and criteria challenges the mans laboratory 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:53.360
 because it's important for 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:54.860
 someone who we who picks up badly and 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.940
 it's not very variable there too 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:58.850
 from one model to another then we have a little 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:00.860
 tend to a military there we have a lot 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:02.450
 from the multimedia photo and eternal to 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:04.370
 the main function in any case a 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.850
 functions still primordial of a 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:07.460
 phone 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:08.660
 and precisely about the photo 

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:11.330
 that they are devices that are 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:14.440
 come out the best side photo then side 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:17.930
 photo we found for this selection 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:19.850
 well then the general council does 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.859
 still apple may not put the 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:23.889
 bigger sensor is not wine 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:27.490
 megapixels like chauny 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:29.710
 but he has a software analysis of the 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.879
 picture that is so son you allow 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:33.340
 still to come out the best 

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:35.020
 photos is like that and reverses that 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.659
 remains apple so with regard to the 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:44.050
 photos from the side of sms just about everything 

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:45.099
 is worth the wii the fans to the other she 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.229
 changes a little bit depending on the 

00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:49.240
 operating system of android os 

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:52.240
 of apple or windows phone% 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:53.680
 overall there are a lot of complaints 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.240
 as regards autonomy in 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.800
 particular of his phones that one is 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.120
 obliged to recharge several times by 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.159
 day and we have a surprise maybe 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.120
 when we look at your investigation it's 

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:03.550
 that we realize that they have a very 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:06.370
 big difference between iphone 6 and 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:09.340
 the iphone 6 plus because in autonomy in 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:12.639
 call the iphone 6 and 10:36 am and 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:14.560
 iphone site more is there are 7 5:36 p.m. 

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:15.849
 hours of difference between the two and 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.409
 yes was not the same battery in addition 

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:19.750
 from English as the culprits more to a 

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:21.189
 biggest apple screen still has a 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:22.719
 more powerful battery inside 

00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:25.389
 which also makes it possible to obtain 

00:05:22.719 --> 00:05:26.889
 station and time so that's because in 

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:27.729
 does it is bigger and so the 

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:29.529
 bigger battery too 

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:31.270
 and here are the most powerful here 

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:33.339
 the best regarding the 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:35.680
 battery is 27 hours 24 

00:05:33.339 --> 00:05:36.939
 still it's the sony xperia z3 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.110
 compact thank you very much 

00:05:36.939 --> 00:05:39.669
 camille gruhier for all these 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:41.110
 details the full detail because it 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:42.639
 really have to dive into this array 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:43.899
 we gave you the most acts 

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:46.810
 interesting but the full detail 

00:05:43.899 --> 00:05:49.689
 giving up that pick of March that 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:54.659
 is on sale right now thank you very much 

00:05:49.689 --> 00:05:54.659
 ah ah
