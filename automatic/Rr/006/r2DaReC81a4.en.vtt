00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
the server is created just go to join

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:38.599 
the server is created just go to join
game<00:02:35.780> and<00:02:36.859> that'll<00:02:37.859> be<00:02:37.950> right<00:02:38.159> there

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:38.609 
game and that'll be right there

game and that'll be right there
there's<00:02:38.819> your<00:02:39.030> server<00:02:39.629> there's<00:02:40.140> the<00:02:40.439> IP

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
there's your server there's the IP

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.800 
there's your server there's the IP
address<00:02:41.250> I<00:02:42.079> guess<00:02:43.250> um<00:02:44.250> so<00:02:44.909> yeah<00:02:45.209> you<00:02:45.269> can<00:02:45.510> join

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
address I guess um so yeah you can join

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.180 
address I guess um so yeah you can join
that<00:02:47.450> you<00:02:48.450> know<00:02:48.599> build<00:02:49.260> terrain<00:02:49.590> and<00:02:50.010> yeah

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
that you know build terrain and yeah

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.670 
that you know build terrain and yeah
that's<00:02:50.370> pretty<00:02:50.519> much<00:02:50.639> how<00:02:51.000> you<00:02:51.030> do<00:02:51.329> it

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.379 

so<00:02:55.680> I'm<00:02:56.099> really<00:02:56.430> hoping<00:02:56.790> there's<00:02:57.000> gonna<00:02:57.150> be

00:02:57.379 --> 00:02:57.389 
so I'm really hoping there's gonna be

00:02:57.389 --> 00:03:00.259 
so I'm really hoping there's gonna be
fully<00:02:58.230> worldwide<00:02:58.950> servers<00:02:59.639> that'd<00:02:59.940> be<00:03:00.090> pretty

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
fully worldwide servers that'd be pretty

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:03.410 
fully worldwide servers that'd be pretty
nice<00:03:00.510> and<00:03:00.989> I<00:03:01.680> might<00:03:01.889> look<00:03:02.040> into<00:03:02.189> figuring<00:03:03.030> out

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
nice and I might look into figuring out

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.479 
nice and I might look into figuring out
how<00:03:03.689> to<00:03:03.720> do<00:03:04.079> an<00:03:04.319> online<00:03:04.439> server<00:03:04.920> through<00:03:05.280> that

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
how to do an online server through that

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:10.190 
how to do an online server through that
computer<00:03:06.030> application<00:03:08.780> pretty<00:03:09.780> much<00:03:09.900> what<00:03:10.079> it

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
computer application pretty much what it

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.170 
computer application pretty much what it
does<00:03:10.349> is<00:03:10.590> it<00:03:10.680> gets<00:03:10.859> your<00:03:11.010> local<00:03:11.489> server<00:03:11.760> and

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
does is it gets your local server and

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:17.300 
does is it gets your local server and
makes<00:03:13.519> it<00:03:14.519> pretty<00:03:14.819> much<00:03:15.260> accesses<00:03:16.260> your<00:03:16.889> local

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
makes it pretty much accesses your local

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.689 
makes it pretty much accesses your local
server<00:03:17.879> data<00:03:18.090> from<00:03:19.049> your<00:03:19.200> iPod<00:03:19.620> and<00:03:19.980> projects

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:20.699 
server data from your iPod and projects

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:27.680 
server data from your iPod and projects
it<00:03:20.910> to<00:03:21.120> a<00:03:21.150> global<00:03:21.720> level<00:03:24.079> well<00:03:25.079> I<00:03:26.449> guess<00:03:27.449> that's

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
it to a global level well I guess that's

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:33.070 
it to a global level well I guess that's
all<00:03:28.139> for<00:03:28.199> now<00:03:28.650> thanks<00:03:31.250> again<00:03:32.250> for<00:03:32.519> watching

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:33.080
