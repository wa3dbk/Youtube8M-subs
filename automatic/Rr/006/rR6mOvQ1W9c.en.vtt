00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
why I considered my wig up here just so

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.760 
why I considered my wig up here just so
I<00:01:07.770> can<00:01:07.890> be<00:01:08.010> more<00:01:08.159> natural<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:08.880> um<00:01:09.570> if<00:01:10.290> you

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
I can be more natural and um if you

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.929 
I can be more natural and um if you
notice<00:01:11.220> in<00:01:11.520> my<00:01:11.760> picture<00:01:12.420> that<00:01:12.689> I<00:01:13.170> took<00:01:13.939> it

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
notice in my picture that I took it

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.100 
notice in my picture that I took it
still<00:01:15.299> looks<00:01:15.600> natural<00:01:16.320> but<00:01:17.450> it's<00:01:18.450> not<00:01:18.689> defined

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
still looks natural but it's not defined

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.830 
still looks natural but it's not defined
so<00:01:19.530> I<00:01:19.680> felt<00:01:20.369> like<00:01:20.610> if<00:01:20.850> I<00:01:21.030> was<00:01:21.119> to<00:01:21.299> wear<00:01:21.479> that<00:01:21.600> wig

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
so I felt like if I was to wear that wig

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.469 
so I felt like if I was to wear that wig
without<00:01:22.290> kids<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.740> in<00:01:22.890> my<00:01:23.040> part<00:01:23.310> you<00:01:24.150> would<00:01:24.360> be

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
without kids to in my part you would be

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.170 
without kids to in my part you would be

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
this wig has bangs over here on this

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.020 
this wig has bangs over here on this
side<00:01:50.189> and<00:01:50.640> a<00:01:51.630> bang<00:01:51.930> no<00:01:52.500> not<00:01:52.649> a<00:01:52.680> bang<00:01:52.950> but<00:01:53.310> it<00:01:53.549> has

a<00:01:54.060> flip<00:01:54.570> on<00:01:54.840> this<00:01:55.079> side<00:01:55.320> I<00:01:55.560> think<00:01:55.649> that's

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
a flip on this side I think that's

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:56.690 
a flip on this side I think that's
really<00:01:56.219> pretty

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
really pretty

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.679

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
can't say that the difference that I

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.249 
can't say that the difference that I
noticed<00:02:02.880> is<00:02:03.060> this<00:02:03.360> hair<00:02:03.689> has<00:02:04.320> a<00:02:04.350> yaki<00:02:04.850> stripes
