00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:11.580 
for me my opinion Diaz had the elbow in

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.400 
for me my opinion Diaz had the elbow in
it<00:04:11.610> look<00:04:11.819> like<00:04:11.970> he<00:04:12.120> held<00:04:12.330> him<00:04:12.450> there<00:04:12.480> you<00:04:12.870> know

it look like he held him there you know
so<00:04:13.650> and<00:04:13.800> it<00:04:13.920> looked<00:04:14.069> like<00:04:14.130> Diaz<00:04:14.519> actually<00:04:14.880> hit

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
so and it looked like Diaz actually hit

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.599 
so and it looked like Diaz actually hit
a<00:04:15.060> short<00:04:15.360> drag<00:04:15.660> I<00:04:15.930> didn't<00:04:16.260> need<00:04:16.380> so<00:04:16.889> it<00:04:17.310> feels

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
a short drag I didn't need so it feels

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:21.069 
a short drag I didn't need so it feels
like<00:04:17.760> that<00:04:17.910> was<00:04:18.030> his<00:04:18.209> move<00:04:18.480> and<00:04:18.900> exposure<00:04:19.590> but

might've got it so 2-0 closest match of
the<00:06:31.970> probably<00:06:32.970> write<00:06:33.300> numerically<00:06:34.110> yeah<00:06:34.320> it's

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:35.040 
the probably write numerically yeah it's

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:39.020 
the probably write numerically yeah it's
going<00:06:35.370> right<00:06:35.490> there<00:06:37.040> so<00:06:38.040> steal<00:06:38.310> Diaz<00:06:38.700> your
