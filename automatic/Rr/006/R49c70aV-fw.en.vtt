00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:14.160
 I am referring now firmly that the 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.240
 material that we had a year ago 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.520
 have recorded 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.039
 now the bar has like that 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.539
 cut together for you and us 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:25.920
 have been looking for someone completely 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.359
 special pets already know 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.570
 her what her house pets with other 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:33.980
 that meant three bars 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:37.079
 and three beautiful animals kathrin big 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:43.020
 right is the first time in one 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:45.870
 on k2 needed real foodwatch 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.020
 These animals touch strings media 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.710
 Cuddle I would say let's go 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:01:01.640
 commented 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:01:02.740
 Next purr the thinking beard 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.980
 as edible 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:04.980
 No 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:27.290
 at least look the same way 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:29.060
 not so good that audi work over 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.250
 share the world as it is 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:34.369
 Strangely not excited at all 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.500
 I was not scared when he tied with me 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:38.860
 I was easy 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:42.440
 and here he turns now 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:44.360
 First of all, make a little show exactly 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.649
 But then you will do that 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.899
 door closes then comes from behind 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:49.789
 Run for what's right after that 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:51.220
 golden and you can see again 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:54.860
 is a bit offended with one 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:57.110
 side-view with his cute but 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:00.350
 it should be I have again totally 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:02.210
 adrenalin in me and there are the pumas 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:07.070
 into the warm room to 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:09.829
 Feeding time just on the arm 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.459
 taken and carried away a little 

00:02:09.829 --> 00:02:12.470
 kitten 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:15.130
 they became another room 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.079
 carried in separately from the parrot 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.130
 can eat 

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:21.739
 Of course there are many 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.030
 you do that and of course not 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:23.989
 easy to hauptplatz over to 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.090
 keep home 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:27.790
 the whole thing is in connection with the 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.530
 European conservation breeding program 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.790
 So now I am not thinking too 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.709
 have driven 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.840
 then I just have a no 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:39.799
 that also has a lot to do with the situation 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:42.320
 the whole thing is clear and here 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:45.220
 Turn on very short there was not 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.220
 offended 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.250
 and here now , right after that 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.260
 Then they went to the couch 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.870
 pumas then slowly get tired 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:00.560
 a long day of great walking around 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:03.110
 outside and now they start with 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.209
 the family together with us 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:07.060
 cuddling on the couch to sit on 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.769
 sometimes they even watch television 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:12.849
 tell 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:16.010
 where should the citizen be carried away and 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:18.250
 There are also examples of that definitely 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.510
 gone a football star lost 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:24.230
 she also knows the background 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.910
 Animal for eternity here is what 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.440
 to break 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.400
 it simply has a need for extreme 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.890
 much experience 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.319
 yes and as I said is the thing is up 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.810
 each case very spacious and door frame 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:39.410
 the big spout needs the course 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:44.329
 there is really nothing there 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:47.690
 to do with small cages or force 

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:50.150
 that is really very appropriate to the species 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.680
 feel incredibly well 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:54.260
 you can tell that how they cuddle the 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.640
 then play a cat too 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.319
 really like this and then fell on us 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.310
 jumped on it so fast could already 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:01.549
 not at all with the camera 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:03.470
 the sharpness of the man adjust the 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:05.329
 administration on the table over it 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:08.930
 run on but do everything around on the 

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:10.609
 shot or as here in the paired me 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:12.920
 Can not get far enough away from the chamber 

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:15.439
 could not turn off too tight 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:20.049
 are so trusting are these fast 

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:20.049
 always beautiful 

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:26.390
 yes you can tell it is the field everything is 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.680
 you can see them also officiate 

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:28.370
 generally when she is not well 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.930
 feel 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:34.520
 specifically, I believe in cats then 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:46.160
 you can see that in the field, it does not shine that way 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:49.520
 and dull and stump so dull the 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:52.280
 evening time they wanted to use now 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:55.010
 he will have his finger in his mouth 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:56.330
 would be taken and then enough there would 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:59.180
 listen now 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:11.590
 that's totally why little babies on 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:11.590
 pacifier and then they sleep on 2 1 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:18.920
 just incredible and there is here 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:20.540
 while he slept, of course, calls my 

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:23.450
 Daddy who has been waiting for us 

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:26.060
 how does he look like ? 

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:34.280
 finally and the cougar does of course 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:37.540
 also from the ringing tone of the mobile phone but 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:40.730
 I apologized right here 

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:43.880
 plant not sleep here again 

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:46.060
 nothing goes on and he has 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:48.880
 also done 

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:51.660
 then again enough is going on 

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.660
 slept 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:06:01.540
 of course, the three have names 

00:05:55.030 --> 00:06:03.340
 Simba Coco and Barbie but I think so 

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:04.419
 we can sit a bit hard too 

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:08.350
 First of all, they are different 

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:11.110
 seen and indeed different colored 

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:13.210
 collars but I could get up now 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:14.889
 Do not say at first I just remember 

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:15.610
 that that was the most impressive of him 

00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:17.800
 no conscience 

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:20.190
 that's the coco i know that parts 

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.190
 brought 

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:31.560
 wrote my e mails do 

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:38.470
 we hope that again clearly fallen 

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:40.180
 Us something in the ultimate great experience I 

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:43.210
 personally love this cats 

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:46.090
 purring and there it was really like 

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:48.460
 from the dolby surround system though 

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:50.620
 really great if you like the video 

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:52.750
 has fallen then but a bible 

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:55.600
 Happy Christmas thumbs up 

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:57.400
 We wish to reflect on you now 

00:06:55.600 --> 00:07:00.070

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:02.910
