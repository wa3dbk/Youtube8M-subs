00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:06.094
 I think the problem I am most troubled with is 

00:00:06.094 --> 00:00:08.881
 Eyes one big one small one single double 

00:00:08.881 --> 00:00:11.267
 I used eyeliner 

00:00:11.267 --> 00:00:13.441
 Plus the help of mascara 

00:00:13.441 --> 00:00:14.747
 Can help her improve 

00:00:14.747 --> 00:00:16.876
 Two eyes with different sizes 

00:00:16.876 --> 00:00:19.610
 Eye shadow with different texture 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:21.915
 Matte and bright 

00:00:21.915 --> 00:00:24.729
 The outline of the eye will be brought out 

00:00:24.729 --> 00:00:27.536
 First make a outline with a light brown 

00:00:27.536 --> 00:00:31.313
 Eyes here with the brow this range 

00:00:31.313 --> 00:00:32.791
 First color 

00:00:32.791 --> 00:00:35.802
 Then take it to the outer corner of the eye 

00:00:35.802 --> 00:00:39.412
 Very bright brown one is also 

00:00:39.412 --> 00:00:42.568
 The most prominent position from the middle of the eye 

00:00:42.568 --> 00:00:45.473
 We made it a little brighter. 

00:00:45.473 --> 00:00:47.916
 Use an eyeliner first 

00:00:47.916 --> 00:00:51.005
 After drawing the entire eyeliner 

00:00:51.005 --> 00:00:52.659
 Use another brush 

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:55.010
 Halo it 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:56.926
 Some eyelids, when you open your eyes 

00:00:56.926 --> 00:00:58.424
 You will cover that eyeliner 

00:00:58.424 --> 00:01:00.194
 So you have to take the final steps 

00:01:00.194 --> 00:01:01.289
 Just open your eyes 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.893
 Push the eyeliner a little higher 

00:01:03.893 --> 00:01:05.834
 Or stretch a little 

00:01:05.834 --> 00:01:08.849
 Learn to clip eyelashes first 

00:01:08.849 --> 00:01:10.411
 Then pick another one is to compare 

00:01:10.411 --> 00:01:13.681
 Mascara with shaping effect 

00:01:13.681 --> 00:01:15.207
 First use the bright pen 

00:01:15.207 --> 00:01:17.081
 In the bottom of the eye 

00:01:17.081 --> 00:01:20.341
 More subtle color is adjusted first 

00:01:20.341 --> 00:01:24.104
 Then apply the foundation, I will use a brush first. 

00:01:24.104 --> 00:01:27.789
 Apply the foundation first evenly 

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:29.357
 Then come with a sponge 

00:01:29.357 --> 00:01:32.948
 Press the foundation just again 

00:01:32.948 --> 00:01:36.885
 More even then more on the skin 

00:01:36.885 --> 00:01:42.236
 Use a liquid blush before loose powder (powder) 

00:01:42.236 --> 00:01:44.144
 The texture of the skin that comes out like this 

00:01:44.144 --> 00:01:47.533
 It will be very moist and very thin 

00:01:47.533 --> 00:01:49.823
 The same paragraph was just applied to the face 

00:01:49.823 --> 00:01:52.917
 Can now be used to make lipstick 

00:01:52.917 --> 00:01:55.693
 Come out is a popular one now. 

00:01:55.693 --> 00:01:57.387
 One called monochromatic 

00:01:57.387 --> 00:01:59.581
 Tonal makeup
