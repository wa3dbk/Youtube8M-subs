00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:30.150 
so the wax helps to keep your sign wood
from<00:05:27.490> drying<00:05:27.820> out<00:05:28.060> and<00:05:28.450> it<00:05:29.080> also<00:05:29.260> keeps<00:05:29.890> the

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:30.160 
from drying out and it also keeps the

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:37.020 
from drying out and it also keeps the
ring<00:05:30.400> from<00:05:30.670> getting<00:05:31.030> into<00:05:31.210> the<00:05:31.600> cut<00:05:32.110> area<00:05:36.030> the

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:37.030 
ring from getting into the cut area the

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:39.720 
ring from getting into the cut area the
tape<00:05:37.720> will<00:05:37.990> stay<00:05:38.260> on<00:05:38.470> probably<00:05:39.100> eight<00:05:39.310> to<00:05:39.490> ten

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:39.730 
tape will stay on probably eight to ten

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:45.150 
tape will stay on probably eight to ten
weeks<00:05:39.760> and<00:05:41.580> the<00:05:42.580> buds<00:05:43.540> that<00:05:43.930> you<00:05:44.290> saw<00:05:44.560> that<00:05:44.890> on

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:45.160 
weeks and the buds that you saw that on

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:47.040 
weeks and the buds that you saw that on
your<00:05:45.340> sign<00:05:45.550> wood<00:05:45.850> will<00:05:46.150> just<00:05:46.600> poke<00:05:46.810> through

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:47.050 
your sign wood will just poke through

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:49.050 
your sign wood will just poke through
the<00:05:47.080> graph<00:05:47.380> so<00:05:47.620> you<00:05:47.710> don't<00:05:47.890> poke<00:05:48.370> to<00:05:48.610> the<00:05:48.790> wax

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:49.060 
the graph so you don't poke to the wax

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:50.910 
the graph so you don't poke to the wax
so<00:05:49.450> you<00:05:49.540> don't<00:05:49.690> have<00:05:49.840> to<00:05:50.080> worry<00:05:50.320> about<00:05:50.710> taking

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:50.920
