shape<00:01:19.200> dynamics<00:01:19.520> pen<00:01:20.520> pressure<00:01:20.759> and<00:01:21.180> it<00:01:21.479> might

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
shape dynamics pen pressure and it might

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.969 
shape dynamics pen pressure and it might
still<00:01:21.780> have<00:01:21.930> that<00:01:22.049> thing<00:01:22.259> until<00:01:22.439> you<00:01:22.650> actually

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
still have that thing until you actually

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.570 
still have that thing until you actually
draw<00:01:23.400> on<00:01:23.430> it<00:01:23.670> but<00:01:24.360> just<00:01:24.600> change<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:24.990> diameter

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580 
draw on it but just change the diameter

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.910 
draw on it but just change the diameter
and<00:01:26.869> because<00:01:27.869> this<00:01:27.960> is<00:01:28.110> what<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.380> ear<00:01:28.500> is<00:01:28.710> when

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
and because this is what the ear is when

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:29.990 
and because this is what the ear is when
that<00:01:29.070> little<00:01:29.220> thing<00:01:29.430> comes<00:01:29.579> up<00:01:29.729> because<00:01:29.820> it

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
that little thing comes up because it

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.600 
that little thing comes up because it
doesn't<00:01:30.240> detect<00:01:30.930> that<00:01:31.110> you<00:01:31.229> have<00:01:31.439> a<00:01:31.470> tablet<00:01:32.369> or

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
doesn't detect that you have a tablet or

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.280 
doesn't detect that you have a tablet or
anything<00:01:32.759> but<00:01:33.090> after<00:01:33.689> you<00:01:33.780> saw<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.020> driver

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
anything but after you saw the driver

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.690 
anything but after you saw the driver
you<00:01:34.500> should<00:01:34.710> be<00:01:34.860> able<00:01:34.950> to<00:01:35.040> just<00:01:35.250> start<00:01:35.460> drawing

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
you should be able to just start drawing

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.540 
you should be able to just start drawing
and<00:01:36.060> you<00:01:36.840> can<00:01:36.990> see<00:01:37.259> that<00:01:38.220> I<00:01:38.250> can

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:39.550 
and you can see that I can

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:42.010 
and you can see that I can
you<00:01:40.550> know<00:01:40.670> the<00:01:40.940> pen<00:01:41.090> pressure<00:01:41.300> is<00:01:41.480> working<00:01:41.840> and

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
you know the pen pressure is working and

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:47.470 
you know the pen pressure is working and
then<00:01:42.110> after<00:01:42.290> you<00:01:42.380> draw<00:01:42.590> I<00:01:43.360> think<00:01:46.480> well

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:47.480 
then after you draw I think well

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:48.790 
then after you draw I think well
regardless<00:01:47.900> of<00:01:48.170> whether<00:01:48.470> they're<00:01:48.590> not<00:01:48.650> that

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:48.800 
regardless of whether they're not that

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.960 
regardless of whether they're not that
triangle<00:01:49.220> goes<00:01:49.400> away<00:01:49.580> it<00:01:49.760> works<00:01:50.240> now<00:01:50.420> so

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:51.970 
triangle goes away it works now so

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.400 
triangle goes away it works now so
anyways<00:01:53.110> that's<00:01:54.110> what<00:01:54.320> I<00:01:54.350> did<00:01:54.530> to<00:01:54.650> fix<00:01:54.830> this<00:01:55.010> I

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:56.410 
anyways that's what I did to fix this I

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:58.450 
anyways that's what I did to fix this I
don't<00:01:57.410> know<00:01:57.470> what<00:01:57.650> else<00:01:57.770> to<00:01:57.890> do<00:01:58.010> if<00:01:58.160> it's<00:01:58.310> not
