00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
taking any waiting time at all it's fast

taking any waiting time at all it's fast
so<00:03:16.980> the<00:03:17.070> chip<00:03:17.310> powering<00:03:17.670> this<00:03:17.760> thing<00:03:17.970> is

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
so the chip powering this thing is

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:19.790 
so the chip powering this thing is
clearly<00:03:18.390> very<00:03:18.720> powerful<00:03:19.320> and<00:03:19.350> we<00:03:19.470> still<00:03:19.680> need

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 
clearly very powerful and we still need

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.040 
clearly very powerful and we still need
to<00:03:19.920> know<00:03:20.130> what<00:03:20.550> this<00:03:21.090> whole<00:03:21.330> overheating

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.050 
to know what this whole overheating

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:23.690 
to know what this whole overheating
business<00:03:22.440> was<00:03:22.709> that<00:03:23.010> people<00:03:23.220> have<00:03:23.520> been
