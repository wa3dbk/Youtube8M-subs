welcome<00:00:01.079> back<00:00:01.170> to<00:00:01.230> smart<00:00:01.680> guitar<00:00:01.979> online

00:00:02.119 --> 00:00:02.129 
welcome back to smart guitar online

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:03.679 
welcome back to smart guitar online
we're<00:00:02.669> going<00:00:02.760> to<00:00:02.850> be<00:00:02.939> talking<00:00:03.030> about<00:00:03.270> a<00:00:03.360> sweep

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
we're going to be talking about a sweep

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:06.470 
we're going to be talking about a sweep
now<00:00:04.130> so<00:00:05.130> similar<00:00:05.580> technique<00:00:05.940> to<00:00:06.150> when<00:00:06.299> we<00:00:06.450> were

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
now so similar technique to when we were

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.450 
now so similar technique to when we were
using<00:00:06.870> rakes<00:00:07.259> but<00:00:07.589> this<00:00:07.770> time<00:00:07.980> as<00:00:08.220> I<00:00:08.340> go

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
using rakes but this time as I go

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:09.860 
using rakes but this time as I go
through<00:00:08.490> and<00:00:08.790> be<00:00:09.030> responsible<00:00:09.570> for<00:00:09.840> a

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
through and be responsible for a

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.450 
through and be responsible for a
different<00:00:10.200> note<00:00:10.380> on<00:00:10.559> each<00:00:10.710> string<00:00:11.010> so<00:00:11.370> the

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
different note on each string so the

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.700 
different note on each string so the
note<00:00:11.610> actually<00:00:12.000> has<00:00:12.150> to<00:00:12.300> sound<00:00:12.599> all<00:00:13.469> right<00:00:13.590> so

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
note actually has to sound all right so

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.049 
note actually has to sound all right so
we're<00:00:13.830> going<00:00:13.950> to<00:00:14.009> be<00:00:14.070> using<00:00:14.099> a<00:00:14.370> shape<00:00:14.610> here

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
we're going to be using a shape here

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.140 
we're going to be using a shape here
it's<00:00:15.990> in<00:00:16.109> our<00:00:16.230> page<00:00:16.470> 0<00:00:16.680> C<00:00:17.070> major<00:00:17.250> arpeggio<00:00:17.640> you

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
it's in our page 0 C major arpeggio you

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.189 
it's in our page 0 C major arpeggio you
can<00:00:18.270> be<00:00:18.359> found<00:00:18.480> right<00:00:18.600> in<00:00:18.720> our<00:00:18.960> a<00:00:19.050> minor

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
can be found right in our a minor

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.080 
can be found right in our a minor
pentatonic<00:00:19.619> scale<00:00:20.130> so<00:00:20.760> we're<00:00:20.850> going<00:00:20.939> to<00:00:21.029> be

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
pentatonic scale so we're going to be

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.790 
pentatonic scale so we're going to be
here<00:00:21.240> on<00:00:21.420> string<00:00:21.840> number<00:00:22.500> 5<00:00:22.830> at<00:00:23.220> 15<00:00:24.800> right

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
here on string number 5 at 15 right

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.220 
here on string number 5 at 15 right
we're<00:00:26.099> figure<00:00:26.340> number<00:00:26.460> four<00:00:26.939> then<00:00:27.930> on<00:00:28.140> the

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
we're figure number four then on the

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.400 
we're figure number four then on the
next<00:00:28.439> string<00:00:28.830> we're<00:00:29.789> going<00:00:29.880> to<00:00:29.970> be<00:00:30.150> at<00:00:30.420> fret<00:00:30.840> 14

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
next string we're going to be at fret 14

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.729 
next string we're going to be at fret 14
and<00:00:31.920> then<00:00:32.790> 12<00:00:33.149> right<00:00:34.020> so<00:00:34.260> we<00:00:34.350> have<00:00:34.500> 15<00:00:35.100> 14<00:00:35.760> 12

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:36.739 
and then 12 right so we have 15 14 12

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:39.979 
and then 12 right so we have 15 14 12
now<00:00:37.739> my<00:00:38.010> top<00:00:38.340> two<00:00:38.640> strings<00:00:39.000> on<00:00:39.329> string<00:00:39.570> 2<00:00:39.780> i'll

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
now my top two strings on string 2 i'll

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.950 
now my top two strings on string 2 i'll
be<00:00:40.110> at<00:00:40.200> 13<00:00:40.969> all<00:00:41.969> right<00:00:42.149> so<00:00:42.300> I've<00:00:42.360> had<00:00:42.480> one<00:00:42.780> note

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
be at 13 all right so I've had one note

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.569 
be at 13 all right so I've had one note
on<00:00:43.110> each<00:00:43.260> string<00:00:43.500> and<00:00:43.739> then<00:00:44.160> on<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.399> top

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
on each string and then on the top

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.400 
on each string and then on the top
string<00:00:44.850> I'm<00:00:45.000> going<00:00:45.120> to<00:00:45.180> have<00:00:45.270> two<00:00:45.539> notes<00:00:45.780> 12

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
string I'm going to have two notes 12

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.279 
string I'm going to have two notes 12
and<00:00:46.680> 15<00:00:46.890> all<00:00:47.850> right<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.840> sweeping<00:00:49.170> is

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
and 15 all right the sweeping is

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.590 
and 15 all right the sweeping is
primarily<00:00:49.680> done<00:00:49.920> with<00:00:50.160> shapes<00:00:51.090> that<00:00:51.210> have<00:00:51.360> one

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
primarily done with shapes that have one

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.450 
primarily done with shapes that have one
note<00:00:51.780> per<00:00:51.930> string<00:00:51.960> usually<00:00:52.500> arpeggios<00:00:53.070> or<00:00:53.370> we

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
note per string usually arpeggios or we

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.490 
note per string usually arpeggios or we
can<00:00:53.610> make<00:00:54.090> up<00:00:54.239> some<00:00:54.449> shapes<00:00:54.780> within<00:00:54.989> our<00:00:55.170> scale

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
can make up some shapes within our scale

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.220 
can make up some shapes within our scale
patterns<00:00:55.920> arpeggio<00:00:56.670> is<00:00:56.820> a<00:00:56.969> broken<00:00:57.420> chord<00:00:57.930> so

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
patterns arpeggio is a broken chord so

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.450 
patterns arpeggio is a broken chord so
it's<00:00:58.379> a<00:00:58.440> chord<00:00:58.649> played<00:00:58.829> one<00:00:59.039> note<00:00:59.219> at<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.430> time

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
it's a chord played one note at a time

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.510 
it's a chord played one note at a time
alright<00:01:00.359> so<00:01:01.170> when<00:01:01.379> I'm<00:01:01.469> sweeping<00:01:01.710> what<00:01:02.430> I'm

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
alright so when I'm sweeping what I'm

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.460 
alright so when I'm sweeping what I'm
doing<00:01:02.789> is<00:01:02.910> when<00:01:03.420> I'm<00:01:03.539> ascending<00:01:04.080> I'm<00:01:04.260> actually

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
doing is when I'm ascending I'm actually

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.710 
doing is when I'm ascending I'm actually
going<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:04.830> be<00:01:04.920> using<00:01:05.100> all<00:01:05.400> down<00:01:06.090> picks<00:01:06.479> and

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
going to be using all down picks and

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:07.760 
going to be using all down picks and
when<00:01:06.840> I'm<00:01:06.930> descending<00:01:07.439> I'm<00:01:07.500> going<00:01:07.619> to<00:01:07.680> be

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 
out of our a minor pentatonic scale so

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.679 
out of our a minor pentatonic scale so
our<00:02:02.060> pinky<00:02:02.390> will<00:02:02.509> be<00:02:02.630> at<00:02:02.720> fret<00:02:02.960> 12<00:02:04.330> right<00:02:05.330> then

on each string

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.750 
on each string
on<00:02:14.900> the<00:02:15.020> top<00:02:15.260> I'm<00:02:15.530> reaching<00:02:15.890> back<00:02:16.040> to<00:02:16.100> get<00:02:16.430> age

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
on the top I'm reaching back to get age

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:26.650 
on the top I'm reaching back to get age
and<00:02:17.090> then<00:02:17.300> 12<00:02:17.630> right<00:02:18.380> so<00:02:18.830> I<00:02:18.860> have

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.010 

no<00:02:27.590> it's<00:02:27.770> a<00:02:27.860> solid<00:02:28.220> uninterruptedly<00:02:29.150> now

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
no it's a solid uninterruptedly now

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.320 
no it's a solid uninterruptedly now
these<00:02:30.260> were<00:02:30.440> five<00:02:30.770> strange<00:02:31.130> shapes<00:02:31.580> it<00:02:32.120> might

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
these were five strange shapes it might

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:33.880 
these were five strange shapes it might
be<00:02:32.480> easier<00:02:32.840> for<00:02:33.170> us<00:02:33.260> to<00:02:33.290> start<00:02:33.620> with<00:02:33.770> some

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
be easier for us to start with some

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.070 
be easier for us to start with some
smaller<00:02:34.280> shapes<00:02:34.670> in<00:02:35.240> our<00:02:35.450> minor<00:02:35.720> pentatonic

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
smaller shapes in our minor pentatonic

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.230 
smaller shapes in our minor pentatonic
scale<00:02:36.740> so<00:02:37.310> we'll<00:02:37.460> go<00:02:37.580> through<00:02:37.610> a<00:02:37.820> couple<00:02:38.000> of

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:38.240 
scale so we'll go through a couple of

scale so we'll go through a couple of
those<00:02:38.420> i'll<00:02:38.930> be<00:02:39.200> in<00:02:39.230> the<00:02:39.440> a<00:02:39.620> minor<00:02:39.950> pentatonic

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340

and one up all right now I'll go to the
next<00:03:18.410> scale<00:03:18.800> pattern<00:03:19.280> we're<00:03:20.240> going<00:03:20.360> to<00:03:20.420> be<00:03:20.480> at

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
next scale pattern we're going to be at

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:26.980 
next scale pattern we're going to be at
freds<00:03:21.700> 988<00:03:22.960> and<00:03:23.960> then<00:03:24.230> 10<00:03:24.530> then<00:03:25.900> we're<00:03:26.900> getting

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:26.990 
freds 988 and then 10 then we're getting

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:31.060 
freds 988 and then 10 then we're getting
that<00:03:27.200> role<00:03:28.360> I'll<00:03:29.360> be<00:03:29.600> in<00:03:29.690> the<00:03:29.780> next<00:03:30.200> one<00:03:30.440> right

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:31.070 
that role I'll be in the next one right

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:36.730 
that role I'll be in the next one right
so<00:03:31.370> be<00:03:31.550> 12<00:03:31.880> 10<00:03:32.300> 10<00:03:32.750> and<00:03:33.050> 12<00:03:34.660> and<00:03:35.660> then<00:03:36.590> the<00:03:36.709> next

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:36.740 
so be 12 10 10 and 12 and then the next

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:42.290 
so be 12 10 10 and 12 and then the next
one<00:03:37.100> will<00:03:37.490> be<00:03:37.750> 14<00:03:38.770> 13<00:03:39.770> 12<00:03:40.030> 15

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:42.300 
one will be 14 13 12 15

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:46.540 
one will be 14 13 12 15
go<00:03:42.990> ahead

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:46.550 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:49.750 

and<00:03:47.480> then<00:03:47.600> we'll<00:03:47.720> end<00:03:48.080> right<00:03:48.500> here<00:03:48.890> with<00:03:49.460> fret

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
and then we'll end right here with fret

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:55.540 
and then we'll end right here with fret
17<00:03:50.300> 15<00:03:50.720> 15<00:03:51.340> and<00:03:52.340> then<00:03:52.580> an<00:03:53.270> a<00:03:53.600> no<00:03:53.810> on<00:03:54.050> fret<00:03:54.500> 17<00:03:55.340> on

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:55.550 
17 15 15 and then an a no on fret 17 on

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:09.250 
17 15 15 and then an a no on fret 17 on
the<00:03:55.580> top<00:03:55.910> so<00:03:56.270> I'm<00:03:56.330> going<00:03:56.480> to<00:03:56.570> have<00:04:04.060> right<00:04:08.260> right

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
the top so I'm going to have right right

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:10.720 
the top so I'm going to have right right
so<00:04:09.530> there's<00:04:09.680> some<00:04:09.980> shorter<00:04:10.340> suites<00:04:10.580> that

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
so there's some shorter suites that

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:12.700 
so there's some shorter suites that
might<00:04:10.910> be<00:04:11.060> a<00:04:11.090> little<00:04:11.210> easier<00:04:11.420> to<00:04:12.110> start<00:04:12.350> at

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:12.710 
might be a little easier to start at

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:14.890 
might be a little easier to start at
first<00:04:13.130> all<00:04:13.640> right<00:04:13.820> so<00:04:14.030> remember<00:04:14.120> we<00:04:14.750> don't

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
first all right so remember we don't

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:16.390 
first all right so remember we don't
want<00:04:15.020> the<00:04:15.080> notes<00:04:15.260> to<00:04:15.410> bleed<00:04:15.770> into<00:04:16.250> one<00:04:16.280> another

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
want the notes to bleed into one another

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:17.530 
want the notes to bleed into one another
because<00:04:16.700> then<00:04:16.880> it'll<00:04:16.970> just<00:04:17.180> sound<00:04:17.269> like<00:04:17.420> a

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:17.540 
because then it'll just sound like a

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:23.020 
because then it'll just sound like a
chord<00:04:17.989> right<00:04:18.820> solid<00:04:19.820> uninterruptedly<00:04:21.940> so<00:04:22.940> we

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 
chord right solid uninterruptedly so we

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.090 
chord right solid uninterruptedly so we
don't<00:04:23.180> want<00:04:23.300> little<00:04:23.450> attacks<00:04:23.930> as<00:04:24.200> we<00:04:24.320> go<00:04:24.470> solid

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 
don't want little attacks as we go solid

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:26.950 
don't want little attacks as we go solid
straight<00:04:25.310> through<00:04:25.610> straight<00:04:26.150> back<00:04:26.390> right

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
straight through straight back right

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.050 
straight through straight back right
keep<00:04:27.500> the<00:04:27.590> pic<00:04:27.770> rigid<00:04:28.190> a<00:04:28.340> little<00:04:28.790> bit<00:04:28.910> of<00:04:28.970> an

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060 
keep the pic rigid a little bit of an

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.250 
keep the pic rigid a little bit of an
angle<00:04:29.240> all<00:04:29.930> right<00:04:30.640> really<00:04:31.640> the<00:04:31.930> arpeggios<00:04:32.930> or

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:33.260 
angle all right really the arpeggios or

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.110 
angle all right really the arpeggios or
the<00:04:33.410> sweep<00:04:33.950> shapes<00:04:34.220> you<00:04:34.370> really<00:04:34.580> want<00:04:34.760> to<00:04:34.820> work

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 
the sweep shapes you really want to work

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.430 
the sweep shapes you really want to work
these<00:04:35.300> out<00:04:35.450> with<00:04:35.570> a<00:04:35.630> metronome<00:04:35.870> to<00:04:36.230> get<00:04:36.350> the

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 
these out with a metronome to get the

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:37.720 
these out with a metronome to get the
evenness<00:04:37.010> in<00:04:37.160> them<00:04:37.250> because<00:04:37.340> that's<00:04:37.490> the<00:04:37.700> way

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:37.730 
evenness in them because that's the way

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:38.920 
evenness in them because that's the way
they're<00:04:37.940> going<00:04:38.120> to<00:04:38.180> sound<00:04:38.330> the<00:04:38.420> best<00:04:38.660> all

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930 
they're going to sound the best all

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:40.960 
they're going to sound the best all
right<00:04:39.140> so<00:04:39.800> there<00:04:39.920> were<00:04:40.010> the<00:04:40.160> jam<00:04:40.370> tracks<00:04:40.700> and

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
right so there were the jam tracks and

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:44.620 
right so there were the jam tracks and
try<00:04:41.810> some<00:04:41.990> of<00:04:42.080> those<00:04:42.140> little<00:04:42.290> sweeps
