00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
rice is the type of player to do the

rice is the type of player to do the
same<00:00:35.820> type<00:00:36.030> of<00:00:36.059> thing<00:00:36.210> but<00:00:36.480> you<00:00:36.630> know<00:00:36.719> I<00:00:36.750> could

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
same type of thing but you know I could

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:43.400 
same type of thing but you know I could
be<00:00:37.050> wrong<00:00:40.190> he<00:00:41.190> will<00:00:41.399> indeed<00:00:41.730> do<00:00:42.600> it<00:00:42.750> or<00:00:42.989> not<00:00:43.020> do

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
be wrong he will indeed do it or not do

be wrong he will indeed do it or not do
it<00:00:43.559> those<00:00:43.710> are<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:44.010> two<00:00:44.129> possibilities

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
it those are the two possibilities

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.400 
it those are the two possibilities
though<00:00:45.000> i<00:00:45.590> don't<00:00:46.590> know<00:00:46.710> i<00:00:47.010> mean<00:00:48.260> gator<00:00:49.260> has

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
though i don't know i mean gator has

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.779 
though i don't know i mean gator has
been<00:00:49.530> really<00:00:49.800> good<00:00:49.920> at<00:00:50.010> responding<00:00:50.250> to<00:00:50.460> early

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
been really good at responding to early

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.060 
been really good at responding to early
stuff<00:00:51.059> i<00:00:51.300> don't<00:00:52.110> think<00:00:52.260> we've<00:00:52.350> seen<00:00:52.379> kawaii<00:00:52.860> do

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
stuff i don't think we've seen kawaii do

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.209 
stuff i don't think we've seen kawaii do
any<00:00:53.280> crazy<00:00:53.579> early<00:00:54.329> stuff<00:00:54.600> probably<00:00:54.899> no<00:00:55.379> not

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
any crazy early stuff probably no not

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.680 
any crazy early stuff probably no not
really<00:00:56.430> but<00:00:56.820> we've<00:00:56.969> only<00:00:57.059> seen<00:00:57.360> him<00:00:57.510> play

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
really but we've only seen him play

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:04.860 
really but we've only seen him play
vibes<00:00:58.530> yeah

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:04.870 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:06.420 

Gator<00:01:05.590> it<00:01:05.710> seems<00:01:05.890> like<00:01:06.010> he's<00:01:06.130> been<00:01:06.250> playing

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
Gator it seems like he's been playing

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.100 
Gator it seems like he's been playing
really<00:01:06.640> solid<00:01:07.030> this<00:01:07.150> entire<00:01:07.450> time<00:01:07.660> and<00:01:07.900> I

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110 
really solid this entire time and I

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:09.510 
really solid this entire time and I
think<00:01:08.320> that<00:01:08.440> exceeds<00:01:08.890> a<00:01:08.980> bit<00:01:09.100> of<00:01:09.190> a<00:01:09.250> stronger

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
think that exceeds a bit of a stronger

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.450 
think that exceeds a bit of a stronger
player<00:01:09.820> than<00:01:10.150> Hawaii<00:01:10.750> so<00:01:11.710> I<00:01:11.740> mean<00:01:12.250> I<00:01:12.340> don't

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460 
player than Hawaii so I mean I don't

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:13.770 
player than Hawaii so I mean I don't
know<00:01:12.550> I<00:01:12.580> feel<00:01:12.730> like<00:01:12.850> a<00:01:12.910> turd<00:01:13.060> should<00:01:13.360> be<00:01:13.510> good

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
know I feel like a turd should be good

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.420 
know I feel like a turd should be good
here<00:01:14.020> I<00:01:14.170> feel<00:01:14.650> like<00:01:14.740> it's<00:01:15.040> definitely<00:01:15.190> the

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:15.430 
here I feel like it's definitely the

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.670 
here I feel like it's definitely the
favorite<00:01:15.550> player<00:01:15.850> coming<00:01:16.030> in<00:01:16.210> here<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:17.530> way

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 
he's played definitely Hawaii seemed to

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.220 
he's played definitely Hawaii seemed to
struggle<00:01:20.800> a<00:01:21.040> little<00:01:21.160> bit<00:01:21.310> with<00:01:21.520> vibe<00:01:21.700> and<00:01:22.230> then

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:23.230 
struggle a little bit with vibe and then

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:26.600 
struggle a little bit with vibe and then
we<00:01:23.350> saw<00:01:23.530> qxc<00:01:23.950> just<00:01:24.630> handle<00:01:25.630> vibe<00:01:25.810> no<00:01:26.110> problem

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
boosting that stalker again really wants

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.790 
boosting that stalker again really wants
that<00:02:39.790> map<00:02:40.120> control<00:02:40.569> once<00:02:41.410> that<00:02:41.560> scouting

that map control once that scouting
information<00:02:42.340> and<00:02:42.520> there<00:02:42.760> it<00:02:42.849> is<00:02:42.910> Gator<00:02:43.209> again

pushing<00:02:44.530> that<00:02:44.650> probe<00:02:45.040> through<00:02:45.340> going<00:02:45.670> to<00:02:45.760> see

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
pushing that probe through going to see

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.660 
pushing that probe through going to see
everything<00:02:46.300> going<00:02:46.690> on<00:02:46.840> here<00:02:47.130> nice<00:02:48.130> so<00:02:48.400> this<00:02:48.580> is

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
everything going on here nice so this is

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.030 
everything going on here nice so this is
going<00:02:48.790> to<00:02:48.880> be<00:02:49.030> an<00:02:49.300> exact<00:02:49.750> I'm<00:02:50.019> calling<00:02:50.440> this<00:02:50.769> I

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
going to be an exact I'm calling this I

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.259 
going to be an exact I'm calling this I
think<00:02:51.400> this<00:02:51.459> is<00:02:51.550> going<00:02:51.640> to<00:02:51.700> be<00:02:51.790> a<00:02:51.819> pretty<00:02:52.060> big

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
think this is going to be a pretty big

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:54.990 
think this is going to be a pretty big
repeat<00:02:52.599> of<00:02:52.690> what<00:02:52.750> we<00:02:52.870> saw<00:02:53.019> in<00:02:53.110> dual<00:02:53.290> site<00:02:54.000> we've

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
repeat of what we saw in dual site we've

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.660 
repeat of what we saw in dual site we've
got<00:02:55.239> a<00:02:55.269> two<00:02:56.230> racks<00:02:56.560> kind<00:02:56.890> of<00:02:56.980> pressure<00:02:57.220> opening

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
got a two racks kind of pressure opening

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.690 
got a two racks kind of pressure opening
from<00:02:58.000> Hawaii<00:02:58.900> rice<00:02:59.260> probably<00:02:59.920> in<00:03:00.010> to<00:03:00.160> expand

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
from Hawaii rice probably in to expand

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.970 
from Hawaii rice probably in to expand
afterwards<00:03:01.269> and<00:03:01.510> then<00:03:01.600> all<00:03:02.200> gated<00:03:02.590> is<00:03:02.830> going

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
afterwards and then all gated is going

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.410 
afterwards and then all gated is going
to<00:03:03.040> do<00:03:03.190> is<00:03:03.430> kind<00:03:03.700> of<00:03:03.819> defend<00:03:04.120> with<00:03:04.269> these

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
to do is kind of defend with these

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:05.970 
to do is kind of defend with these
stalkers<00:03:04.660> he's<00:03:04.989> probably<00:03:05.140> been<00:03:05.350> a<00:03:05.380> three<00:03:05.739> gate

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
stalkers he's probably been a three gate

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.430 
stalkers he's probably been a three gate
before<00:03:06.220> it<00:03:06.519> span<00:03:06.850> and<00:03:07.720> it'll<00:03:08.080> be<00:03:08.170> just<00:03:08.319> like

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
before it span and it'll be just like

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:09.390 
before it span and it'll be just like
what<00:03:08.620> happened<00:03:08.709> with<00:03:08.920> dual<00:03:09.100> side<00:03:09.310> I<00:03:09.340> think

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
what happened with dual side I think

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.630 
what happened with dual side I think
against<00:03:10.030> qxe<00:03:10.750> yeah<00:03:11.470> it's<00:03:11.709> definitely<00:03:12.010> looking

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
against qxe yeah it's definitely looking

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:13.830 
against qxe yeah it's definitely looking
like<00:03:12.819> that<00:03:13.030> as<00:03:13.209> he<00:03:13.330> throws<00:03:13.540> down<00:03:13.750> to

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
like that as he throws down to

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.809 
like that as he throws down to
additional<00:03:14.230> gateways<00:03:14.560> he<00:03:14.920> forced<00:03:15.310> the<00:03:15.519> probe

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:15.819 
additional gateways he forced the probe

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:17.910 
additional gateways he forced the probe
in<00:03:16.030> at<00:03:16.209> the<00:03:16.299> same<00:03:16.510> time<00:03:16.810> and<00:03:17.110> he<00:03:17.170> also<00:03:17.410> saw<00:03:17.860> the

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
in at the same time and he also saw the

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.520 
in at the same time and he also saw the
exact<00:03:18.489> same<00:03:18.730> thing<00:03:19.030> he<00:03:19.269> saw<00:03:19.450> a<00:03:19.480> gas<00:03:19.870> and<00:03:20.260> two

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
exact same thing he saw a gas and two

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.589 
exact same thing he saw a gas and two
barracks<00:03:20.920> one<00:03:21.220> with<00:03:21.400> a<00:03:21.430> reactor<00:03:22.000> one<00:03:22.420> with

00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:22.599 
barracks one with a reactor one with

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:25.020 
barracks one with a reactor one with
nothing<00:03:22.900> at<00:03:23.019> that<00:03:23.049> point<00:03:23.380> time<00:03:23.670> so<00:03:24.670> this<00:03:24.849> seems

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
nothing at that point time so this seems

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.180 
nothing at that point time so this seems
to<00:03:25.180> be<00:03:25.209> his<00:03:25.450> response<00:03:25.870> is<00:03:26.140> to<00:03:26.380> go<00:03:26.620> three<00:03:26.980> gate

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
to be his response is to go three gate

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.390 
to be his response is to go three gate
grab<00:03:27.549> a<00:03:27.580> second<00:03:28.030> gas<00:03:28.209> and<00:03:28.599> then<00:03:28.690> expand<00:03:29.400> yep

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
grab a second gas and then expand yep

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.039 
grab a second gas and then expand yep
I've<00:03:30.610> really<00:03:31.000> liked<00:03:31.209> the<00:03:31.330> way<00:03:31.450> that<00:03:31.630> um<00:03:31.840> I

finishes<00:04:15.940> I<00:04:16.060> mean<00:04:16.239> pretty<00:04:16.930> much<00:04:17.019> Gator<00:04:17.380> just

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
finishes I mean pretty much Gator just

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:19.349 
finishes I mean pretty much Gator just
needs<00:04:17.829> to<00:04:17.919> keep<00:04:18.070> making<00:04:18.430> units<00:04:18.789> and<00:04:18.940> units<00:04:19.209> and

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 
needs to keep making units and units and

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:20.580 
needs to keep making units and units and
units<00:04:19.630> over<00:04:19.810> and<00:04:19.930> over<00:04:19.989> again<00:04:20.139> maybe<00:04:20.350> add<00:04:20.560> a

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
units over and over again maybe add a

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.770 
units over and over again maybe add a
robo<00:04:21.010> on<00:04:21.039> to<00:04:21.280> this<00:04:21.430> and<00:04:21.639> maybe<00:04:22.330> even<00:04:22.479> start

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
robo on to this and maybe even start

robo on to this and maybe even start
pumping<00:04:23.080> immortals<00:04:24.090> but<00:04:25.090> I<00:04:25.120> mean<00:04:25.330> if<00:04:25.450> he<00:04:25.510> just

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
pumping immortals but I mean if he just

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:27.600 
pumping immortals but I mean if he just
keeps<00:04:25.900> continuing<00:04:26.500> to<00:04:26.740> produce<00:04:26.889> units<00:04:27.310> twice

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
keeps continuing to produce units twice

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.790 
keeps continuing to produce units twice
is<00:04:28.000> falling<00:04:28.539> into<00:04:28.690> this<00:04:28.810> same<00:04:29.260> trap<00:04:29.560> but<00:04:29.740> I

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
is falling into this same trap but I

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.320 
is falling into this same trap but I
feel<00:04:30.130> like<00:04:30.160> he<00:04:30.370> had<00:04:30.460> against<00:04:30.700> five<00:04:31.060> a<00:04:31.090> lot

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
feel like he had against five a lot

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.750 
feel like he had against five a lot
worries<00:04:31.570> are<00:04:31.720> so<00:04:31.960> late<00:04:32.169> on<00:04:32.200> expanding<00:04:32.860> yeah

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:33.760 
worries are so late on expanding yeah

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:34.959 
worries are so late on expanding yeah
I'm<00:04:34.030> aiming

00:04:34.959 --> 00:04:34.969 
I'm aiming

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:37.509 
I'm aiming
he<00:04:35.719> can<00:04:35.899> only<00:04:35.989> expand<00:04:36.619> so<00:04:36.860> late<00:04:37.069> and<00:04:37.309> if<00:04:37.429> we

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:37.519 
he can only expand so late and if we

00:04:37.519 --> 00:04:39.309 
he can only expand so late and if we
don't<00:04:37.699> see<00:04:37.939> you<00:04:38.269> know<00:04:38.479> a<00:04:38.659> command<00:04:39.079> center

00:04:39.309 --> 00:04:39.319 
don't see you know a command center

00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:41.919 
don't see you know a command center
pretty<00:04:39.860> soon<00:04:40.189> here<00:04:40.639> well<00:04:41.389> I<00:04:41.419> mean<00:04:41.569> we<00:04:41.749> see<00:04:41.899> a

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:41.929 
pretty soon here well I mean we see a

00:04:41.929 --> 00:04:43.689 
pretty soon here well I mean we see a
factory<00:04:42.379> I<00:04:42.409> mean<00:04:42.559> one<00:04:42.769> factory<00:04:43.189> in<00:04:43.279> two<00:04:43.429> racks

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:43.699 
factory I mean one factory in two racks

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:44.829 
factory I mean one factory in two racks
this<00:04:43.849> is<00:04:43.939> pretty<00:04:44.119> much<00:04:44.209> the<00:04:44.329> most<00:04:44.569> you<00:04:44.779> can

00:04:44.829 --> 00:04:44.839 
this is pretty much the most you can

00:04:44.839 --> 00:04:46.989 
this is pretty much the most you can
produce<00:04:45.110> on<00:04:45.499> one<00:04:46.099> Terran<00:04:46.399> base<00:04:46.549> so<00:04:46.759> he's<00:04:46.879> going

00:04:46.989 --> 00:04:46.999 
produce on one Terran base so he's going

00:04:46.999 --> 00:04:48.759 
produce on one Terran base so he's going
to<00:04:47.089> have<00:04:47.179> to<00:04:47.209> cut<00:04:47.479> army<00:04:47.809> production<00:04:48.289> if<00:04:48.589> he's

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:48.769 
to have to cut army production if he's

00:04:48.769 --> 00:04:50.649 
to have to cut army production if he's
going<00:04:48.889> to<00:04:48.979> want<00:04:49.069> to<00:04:49.219> take<00:04:49.339> an<00:04:49.459> expansion<00:04:50.029> and<00:04:50.179> I

00:04:50.649 --> 00:04:50.659 
going to want to take an expansion and I

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:51.909 
going to want to take an expansion and I
mean<00:04:50.809> you<00:04:50.899> can<00:04:51.049> see<00:04:51.289> the<00:04:51.409> way<00:04:51.499> they<00:04:51.619> set<00:04:51.860> up

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:52.779 
mean you can see the way they set up
right<00:04:52.039> now<00:04:52.129> he<00:04:52.219> didn't<00:04:52.399> want<00:04:52.519> to<00:04:52.579> cut<00:04:52.699> on

00:04:52.779 --> 00:04:52.789 
right now he didn't want to cut on

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:54.219 
right now he didn't want to cut on
reproduction<00:04:53.149> he's<00:04:53.360> making<00:04:53.929> a<00:04:53.989> pretty

00:04:54.219 --> 00:04:54.229 
reproduction he's making a pretty

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:56.229 
reproduction he's making a pretty
aggressive<00:04:54.349> play<00:04:54.889> here<00:04:55.129> yeah<00:04:55.789> this<00:04:55.939> is<00:04:56.119> an

00:04:56.229 --> 00:04:56.239 
aggressive play here yeah this is an

00:04:56.239 --> 00:04:58.509 
aggressive play here yeah this is an
interesting<00:04:56.479> marine<00:04:56.959> tank<00:04:57.199> sort<00:04:57.979> of<00:04:58.069> build<00:04:58.249> I

00:04:58.509 --> 00:04:58.519 
interesting marine tank sort of build I

00:04:58.519 --> 00:05:00.639 
interesting marine tank sort of build I
don't<00:04:58.789> know<00:04:58.939> it's<00:04:59.599> it's<00:04:59.899> definitely<00:05:00.409> looking

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:00.649 
don't know it's it's definitely looking

00:05:00.649 --> 00:05:03.789 
don't know it's it's definitely looking
all<00:05:00.799> in<00:05:00.979> but<00:05:01.269> still<00:05:02.269> we<00:05:02.659> have<00:05:02.779> another<00:05:03.169> 70

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:03.799 
all in but still we have another 70

00:05:03.799 --> 00:05:05.739 
all in but still we have another 70
seconds<00:05:04.189> until<00:05:04.369> siege<00:05:04.669> mode<00:05:04.849> wow<00:05:05.029> that's

00:05:05.739 --> 00:05:05.749 
seconds until siege mode wow that's

00:05:05.749 --> 00:05:08.139 
seconds until siege mode wow that's
that's<00:05:06.199> way<00:05:06.559> too<00:05:06.619> late<00:05:07.279> I<00:05:07.489> think<00:05:07.789> that's<00:05:07.939> way

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:08.149 
that's way too late I think that's way

00:05:08.149 --> 00:05:11.769 
that's way too late I think that's way
too<00:05:08.209> late<00:05:08.599> I<00:05:08.839> agree<00:05:09.679> like<00:05:10.539> these<00:05:11.539> centuries

00:05:11.769 --> 00:05:11.779 
too late I agree like these centuries

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:13.749 
too late I agree like these centuries
are<00:05:12.229> going<00:05:12.349> to<00:05:12.409> have<00:05:12.559> so<00:05:12.889> much<00:05:12.949> energy<00:05:13.249> by<00:05:13.639> the

00:05:13.749 --> 00:05:13.759 
are going to have so much energy by the

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:15.129 
are going to have so much energy by the
time<00:05:13.939> he<00:05:14.119> pushes<00:05:14.479> out<00:05:14.629> they're<00:05:14.839> going<00:05:14.989> to<00:05:15.049> have

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:15.139 
time he pushes out they're going to have

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:19.119 
time he pushes out they're going to have
at<00:05:15.259> least<00:05:15.289> 34<00:05:15.919> seal<00:05:16.129> beach<00:05:16.449> and<00:05:17.769> I<00:05:18.769> mean<00:05:18.919> he's

00:05:19.119 --> 00:05:19.129 
at least 34 seal beach and I mean he's

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:21.249 
at least 34 seal beach and I mean he's
only<00:05:19.309> going<00:05:19.459> to<00:05:19.549> have<00:05:19.669> two<00:05:20.209> tanks<00:05:20.689> once<00:05:21.019> siege

00:05:21.249 --> 00:05:21.259 
only going to have two tanks once siege

00:05:21.259 --> 00:05:25.809 
only going to have two tanks once siege
mode<00:05:21.409> finishes<00:05:23.829> as<00:05:24.829> long<00:05:25.249> as<00:05:25.489> we<00:05:25.610> see

00:05:25.809 --> 00:05:25.819 
mode finishes as long as we see

00:05:25.819 --> 00:05:28.299 
mode finishes as long as we see
continuous<00:05:26.449> production<00:05:26.779> of<00:05:27.229> units<00:05:27.679> from<00:05:28.069> gay
