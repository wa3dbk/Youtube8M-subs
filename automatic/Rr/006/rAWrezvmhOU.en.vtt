just<00:03:14.670> a<00:03:14.760> different<00:03:15.090> thing

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.530 

come<00:03:18.090> on<00:03:18.210> he's<00:03:18.930> an<00:03:19.050> imposter<00:03:19.640> with<00:03:20.640> the<00:03:20.760> rx7

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
just driving a few minutes ago the old

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.680 
just driving a few minutes ago the old
school<00:03:39.480> one<00:03:39.770> you<00:03:40.770> can<00:03:40.950> put<00:03:41.130> a<00:03:41.160> 2009<00:03:42.060> cts-v

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
school one you can put a 2009 cts-v

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.990 
school one you can put a 2009 cts-v
engine<00:03:43.260> in<00:03:43.380> it<00:03:43.530> which<00:03:43.740> is<00:03:43.950> not<00:03:44.220> possible<00:03:44.490> at

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
engine in it which is not possible at

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.290 
engine in it which is not possible at
all<00:03:45.980> at<00:03:46.980> least<00:03:47.040> I<00:03:47.370> don't<00:03:47.430> think<00:03:47.640> it<00:03:47.880> is<00:03:48.030> I'm

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:48.300 
all at least I don't think it is I'm

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:53.160 
all at least I don't think it is I'm
gonna<00:03:48.420> get<00:03:48.570> here<00:03:48.750> right<00:03:48.810> here<00:03:49.170> no<00:03:49.550> retard

I probably just end this one after the
the<00:03:57.390> first<00:03:58.390> round<00:03:59.020> because<00:03:59.410> this<00:04:00.040> is<00:04:00.160> taking

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:00.520 
the first round because this is taking

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:01.710 
the first round because this is taking
forever<00:04:00.640> nobody

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.720 
forever nobody

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:14.780
