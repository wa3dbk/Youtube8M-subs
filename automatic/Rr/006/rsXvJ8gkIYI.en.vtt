00:00:01.899 --> 00:00:04.229
 all this small arms today 

00:00:04.229 --> 00:00:05.309
 produced by noise from 

00:00:05.309 --> 00:00:08.309
 machine building plants armenia 

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:11.609
 now 35 is not allowed 

00:00:11.609 --> 00:00:12.899
 outsiders 

00:00:12.899 --> 00:00:15.499
 for a long time kept secret the fact 

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:17.909
 well-established production cycle and 

00:00:17.909 --> 00:00:20.289
 here are such sniper rifles 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:23.289
 and for this not by chance 

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:26.679
 Armenia became the first 

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:28.550
 which immediately after the collapse of the USSR 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.679
 proceeded to independent 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:32.580
 feed production 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:33.670
 push home 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:35.570
 served as a war in Karabakh 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.710
 all time armenian costa troops 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.580
 needed armaments despite 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.150
 official termination of combat 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.900
 action martin 90 fourth truck 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.750
 renewal still exists 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.680
 But why should Armenia own 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.380
 armament production when in 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.610
 if necessary it can be enough 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.700
 easy to buy in third countries 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.050
 ufa option 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.050
 in Moscow russia.ru 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.480
 but about the order as well as the dock on time could not 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.400
 time to get 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.950
 that is, its own rules 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.950
 give Volodin at less due 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:17.960
 despite the fact that the arsenal of small 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.610
 weapons produced in 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:20.970
 Armenia is still small 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:21.940
 she's on her technical 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.940
 characteristics 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.780
 there are three different rifles in the week 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.780
 modifications 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:34.760
 according to technical characteristics 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.240
 He is not comparable with the famous 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.090
 Kalashnikov 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.090
 4 pages and Korean gun 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.050
 and here's a gun machine gun he 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:46.140
 designed specifically for 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.430
 special forces 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.430
 but it all began in 90 the second of these 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:55.850
 with the beginning of the war in Karabakh they 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:57.500
 entered into arming the Armenian 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:58.910
 self defense units 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:00.970
 Isa many flaws such weapons 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:02.760
 caused a lot of complaints and soon 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.330
 was discontinued 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:05.700
 however, with the beginning of the first Chechen 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:06.730
 campaigns 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:08.930
 the same machine guns turned out to be on 

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:11.369
 armed militants 

00:02:11.369 --> 00:02:14.009
 4 her 

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:15.559
 in the army 

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:17.319
 this decision 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.319
 and his mother america rubles 

00:02:21.529 --> 00:02:23.319
 I generally 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:26.569
 right 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:28.389
 even before the start of the war in Chechnya 

00:02:28.389 --> 00:02:31.049
 The hammer and sickle factory was established 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:32.219
 production board 

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:33.389
 translated from Chechen football 

00:02:33.389 --> 00:02:36.289
 they were exactly copy Armenian 

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:37.749
 Russian friendship of peoples who 

00:02:37.749 --> 00:02:39.579
 got to the Chechen militants as 

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:43.019
 trophies 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:45.019
 on the side of Azerbaijan 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:48.019
 thus the Armenian gunsmiths 

00:02:53.679 --> 00:02:55.129
 Meanwhile, the production of new 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:57.729
 samples 

00:02:57.729 --> 00:03:00.729
 and soon the first republic 

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:04.899
 will it 

00:03:04.899 --> 00:03:07.079
 the truth is she's still firmly on 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:08.959
 three stations still leaves much to be 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:11.959
 the best 

00:03:17.119 --> 00:03:20.119
 notice the color 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:22.759
 This machine gun has one 

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:25.249
 feature store located by the way 

00:03:25.249 --> 00:03:26.589
 pistol grip 

00:03:26.589 --> 00:03:28.799
 worldwide such a system has 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:31.799
 titles 

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:35.189
 I have rights 

00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:38.369
 according to the rules for the joints of may north dv 

00:03:38.369 --> 00:03:40.809
 Now 

00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:44.049
 collected during which and 

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:54.120
 well balanced 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.559
 already showing good results 

00:03:56.559 --> 00:03:57.979
 for a gun 

00:03:57.979 --> 00:04:00.039
 more reminiscent of the Israeli paunch 

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:02.099
 traditional cartridges are used 

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:03.649
 9 millimeters 

00:04:03.649 --> 00:04:05.369
 some skeptics note similarities 

00:04:05.369 --> 00:04:07.009
 sample data with Russian 

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:07.849
 analogs 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:10.119
 first but experts note 

00:04:10.119 --> 00:04:11.499
 fairly low cost 

00:04:11.499 --> 00:04:12.849
 production 

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:14.549
 however go global 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:17.549
 armed with armenia while hindering 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.210
 but all experts agree on one thing 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:26.199
 that in order to evaluate the quality 

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:26.389
 product
