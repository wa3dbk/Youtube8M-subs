Eugene's Playhouse is filmed in front of
a live studio audience.

(Clapping)

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.120
My name is Freight Train. I'm from North Carolina, same
state as Ric Flair.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.300
I'm $5 Wrestling Heavyweight Champion.

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.910
I come to OVW to find Mr. U-Gene.

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:31.560
(Cheering and Clapping)

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:38.740
Mr. U-Gene, I am Freight Train. I want to apologize for what happened when I called you shellfish.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.700
I wanted to come and give you my $5 Dollar Wrestling Heavyweight Championship

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:49.940
and I'm going to enroll in
your school because I know you teach The Nick Dinsmore Pro Wrestling Class

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.160
at OVW. I want to be a big star.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.680
It's ok Freight Train, you're a really nice guy.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.460
It's not your fault that $5 Dollar Wrestling made you come to Charlestown and that happened.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:06.680
But I will take your title. Wha, wha. And now I will be a $5 Dollar Heavyweight Champion.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.940
Then you can roll in my school, Freight Train!

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.000
Bof, Stunner!

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.619
Freight Train, I'm not a guy that toys around.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.180
I don't play around. I'm a pretty serious
competitor.

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:27.460
The gist of its this, these boots got a mile or two on them, Freight Train, and when you come to Charlestown, Indiana.

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:33.340
$5 Wrestling Heavyweight Championship is on the line in Charlestown, Indiana.

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.450
When I see you, you're going to get the
biggest beating of your life.

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.110
I'm gonna make you eat your words. You
call me shellfish.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:53.300
I'm going make you eat your words and I'm gonna be
the one that finally gets you to shut the F up,

00:01:53.409 --> 00:02:00.489
Hollywood style! You know why Freight Train? You know why? Because I'm going to be the one that's leading this train wreck.
