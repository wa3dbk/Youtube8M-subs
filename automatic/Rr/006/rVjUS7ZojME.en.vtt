00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:01.969 

hi<00:00:00.630> guys<00:00:00.870> so<00:00:01.260> today<00:00:01.290> we're<00:00:01.650> going<00:00:01.800> to<00:00:01.860> be

00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:01.979 
hi guys so today we're going to be

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:04.460 
hi guys so today we're going to be
reviewing<00:00:02.280> the<00:00:02.909> cipher<00:00:03.270> galaxy<00:00:03.629> real<00:00:03.780> and<00:00:04.380> the

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
reviewing the cipher galaxy real and the

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.230 
reviewing the cipher galaxy real and the
covert<00:00:04.770> wheel<00:00:04.950> both<00:00:05.580> of<00:00:05.790> these<00:00:05.850> wheels<00:00:06.089> are

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
covert wheel both of these wheels are

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.419 
covert wheel both of these wheels are
very<00:00:06.480> similar<00:00:06.990> in<00:00:07.109> design<00:00:07.170> these<00:00:07.919> are<00:00:07.980> the<00:00:08.099> six

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
very similar in design these are the six

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:10.910 
very similar in design these are the six
inches<00:00:08.820> with<00:00:09.269> the<00:00:09.510> cyber<00:00:09.750> galaxy<00:00:10.230> being<00:00:10.440> 2<00:00:10.769> or

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
inches with the cyber galaxy being 2 or

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.820 
inches with the cyber galaxy being 2 or
3<00:00:11.099> millimeters<00:00:11.580> wider<00:00:11.969> in<00:00:12.120> diameter<00:00:12.830> they

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
3 millimeters wider in diameter they

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.250 
3 millimeters wider in diameter they
both<00:00:14.040> have<00:00:14.400> very<00:00:14.700> similar<00:00:15.389> designs<00:00:16.020> as<00:00:16.170> you

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
both have very similar designs as you

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.800 
both have very similar designs as you
can<00:00:16.410> see<00:00:16.619> the<00:00:17.010> only<00:00:17.160> difference<00:00:17.850> is<00:00:18.539> really

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
can see the only difference is really

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.140 
can see the only difference is really
obvious<00:00:19.410> with<00:00:19.650> these<00:00:19.830> is<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:20.490> color<00:00:20.730> with<00:00:20.970> the

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
obvious with these is the color with the

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.300 
obvious with these is the color with the
comfort<00:00:21.630> wheel<00:00:21.779> you<00:00:22.230> have<00:00:22.260> it<00:00:22.740> solid<00:00:23.070> color<00:00:23.250> on

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
comfort wheel you have it solid color on

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.099 
comfort wheel you have it solid color on
the<00:00:23.430> back<00:00:23.580> of<00:00:23.880> your<00:00:24.029> choice<00:00:24.269> and<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:24.900> same

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
the back of your choice and the same

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.310 
the back of your choice and the same
color<00:00:25.320> is<00:00:26.250> transpired<00:00:26.730> on<00:00:26.849> the<00:00:26.910> front<00:00:27.150> and<00:00:27.359> on

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
color is transpired on the front and on

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.689 
color is transpired on the front and on
the<00:00:28.349> cyber<00:00:28.619> galaxy<00:00:28.949> wheel<00:00:29.099> you<00:00:29.220> have<00:00:29.369> silver

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
the cyber galaxy wheel you have silver

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.310 
the cyber galaxy wheel you have silver
on<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:29.939> back<00:00:29.970> and<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.689> color<00:00:30.869> of<00:00:30.960> your<00:00:31.050> choice

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
on the back and the color of your choice

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.709 
on the back and the color of your choice
is<00:00:31.890> transparent<00:00:32.579> on<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:32.940> front<00:00:33.149> section<00:00:33.570> and

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
is transparent on the front section and

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.900 
is transparent on the front section and
that<00:00:34.410> is<00:00:34.530> pretty<00:00:34.860> much<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.309> only<00:00:35.340> difference

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
that is pretty much the only difference

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.729 
that is pretty much the only difference
with<00:00:36.059> these<00:00:36.180> lis<00:00:36.329> both<00:00:36.510> me<00:00:36.750> tail<00:00:37.020> been<00:00:37.500> around

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
with these lis both me tail been around

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.560 
with these lis both me tail been around
about<00:00:38.010> 2<00:00:38.340> to<00:00:38.489> 4<00:00:38.640> pounds<00:00:38.850> depending<00:00:39.149> on<00:00:39.390> where

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
about 2 to 4 pounds depending on where

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.869 
about 2 to 4 pounds depending on where
you<00:00:39.660> buy<00:00:39.690> them<00:00:39.989> so<00:00:40.770> you<00:00:40.860> would<00:00:41.160> expect<00:00:41.250> that

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
you buy them so you would expect that

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.850 
you buy them so you would expect that
they<00:00:42.420> would<00:00:42.540> be<00:00:42.600> very<00:00:43.440> similar<00:00:43.710> in

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
they would be very similar in

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.119 
they would be very similar in
performance<00:00:44.300> however<00:00:45.829> inside<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:46.950> galaxy

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
performance however inside the galaxy

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.940 
performance however inside the galaxy
wheel<00:00:47.539> was<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.840> first<00:00:49.079> one<00:00:49.230> that<00:00:49.260> I<00:00:49.410> bought<00:00:49.680> I

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
wheel was the first one that I bought I

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.680 
wheel was the first one that I bought I
was<00:00:50.550> quite<00:00:50.730> happy<00:00:51.000> with<00:00:51.090> it<00:00:51.149> it's<00:00:51.329> quieter

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
was quite happy with it it's quieter

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.049 
was quite happy with it it's quieter
than<00:00:51.780> most<00:00:51.960> wheels<00:00:52.260> however<00:00:52.739> it<00:00:53.430> does<00:00:53.640> make<00:00:53.879> it

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
than most wheels however it does make it

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.240 
than most wheels however it does make it
sort<00:00:54.300> of<00:00:54.420> roughly<00:00:54.690> hissing<00:00:55.289> noise<00:00:55.469> when<00:00:56.100> you

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
sort of roughly hissing noise when you

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.760 
sort of roughly hissing noise when you
use<00:00:56.460> it<00:00:57.350> like<00:00:58.350> that<00:00:59.570> but<00:01:00.570> in<00:01:00.809> general<00:01:00.870> it's<00:01:01.530> not

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
use it like that but in general it's not

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.219 
use it like that but in general it's not
too<00:01:01.949> bad<00:01:02.160> it's<00:01:02.910> a<00:01:03.239> lot<00:01:03.510> quieter<00:01:03.750> than<00:01:03.870> most

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
too bad it's a lot quieter than most

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.460 
too bad it's a lot quieter than most
wheels<00:01:04.500> you<00:01:04.619> get<00:01:04.799> first<00:01:05.070> off<00:01:05.930> and<00:01:06.930> then<00:01:07.350> you

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
wheels you get first off and then you

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.120 
wheels you get first off and then you
have<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.830> comfort<00:01:08.040> we<00:01:08.369> are<00:01:08.840> there<00:01:09.840> this<00:01:10.080> I<00:01:10.380> was

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
have the comfort we are there this I was

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.859 
have the comfort we are there this I was
expecting<00:01:11.580> a<00:01:11.610> lot<00:01:11.880> more<00:01:11.939> fun<00:01:12.420> this<00:01:12.540> is<00:01:12.600> it's

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
expecting a lot more fun this is it's

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.749 
expecting a lot more fun this is it's
it's<00:01:13.380> a<00:01:13.470> much<00:01:13.729> more<00:01:14.729> well<00:01:15.030> known<00:01:16.040> wheel<00:01:17.040> and

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
it's a much more well known wheel and

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.039 
it's a much more well known wheel and
saucers<00:01:18.180> on<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.360> Box<00:01:18.540> extra<00:01:19.350> silent<00:01:19.740> so<00:01:21.049> there

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
saucers on the Box extra silent so there

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.469 
saucers on the Box extra silent so there
I<00:01:22.080> was<00:01:22.369> yeah<00:01:23.430> thinking<00:01:23.939> that<00:01:24.090> it<00:01:24.180> was<00:01:24.299> going<00:01:24.420> to

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
I was yeah thinking that it was going to

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.130 
I was yeah thinking that it was going to
be<00:01:24.570> a<00:01:24.600> really<00:01:24.960> good<00:01:25.080> wheel<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:26.869> words<00:01:27.869> will

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
be a really good wheel and words will

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.630 
be a really good wheel and words will
not<00:01:28.259> describe<00:01:28.650> it<00:01:28.799> I<00:01:28.979> will<00:01:29.189> just<00:01:29.400> show<00:01:29.610> you

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
not describe it I will just show you

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:37.310 
not describe it I will just show you
that<00:01:34.070> squeaky<00:01:35.070> noise<00:01:35.100> is<00:01:35.930> the<00:01:36.930> noise<00:01:37.049> it<00:01:37.290> is

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
that squeaky noise is the noise it is

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.260 
that squeaky noise is the noise it is
made<00:01:37.619> from<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.009> moment<00:01:38.220> it<00:01:38.670> came<00:01:38.880> out<00:01:39.030> of<00:01:39.180> the

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
made from the moment it came out of the

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.840 
made from the moment it came out of the
box<00:01:39.509> it<00:01:39.810> went<00:01:40.049> into<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.320> cage<00:01:40.619> they<00:01:41.310> run<00:01:41.549> on<00:01:41.579> it

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
box it went into the cage they run on it

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.190 
box it went into the cage they run on it
and<00:01:42.799> it<00:01:43.799> squeaks<00:01:44.630> generally<00:01:45.630> it's<00:01:45.750> worse<00:01:45.960> than

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
and it squeaks generally it's worse than

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.780 
and it squeaks generally it's worse than
that<00:01:46.320> when<00:01:46.710> it's<00:01:46.860> got<00:01:46.979> hamster<00:01:47.310> weight<00:01:47.460> on<00:01:47.640> it

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
that when it's got hamster weight on it

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:55.780 
that when it's got hamster weight on it
but<00:01:48.630> can<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:48.840> imagine<00:01:48.930> that<00:01:49.430> all<00:01:50.430> night<00:01:50.790> long

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.660 

so<00:01:56.790> if<00:01:57.659> you<00:01:58.170> are<00:01:58.500> debating<00:01:58.740> which<00:01:59.369> we<00:01:59.520> all

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
so if you are debating which we all

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.520 
so if you are debating which we all
forget<00:01:59.939> because<00:02:00.420> they're<00:02:00.840> very<00:02:00.960> similar<00:02:01.380> I

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
forget because they're very similar I

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.219 
forget because they're very similar I
would<00:02:01.740> always<00:02:01.979> say<00:02:02.340> go<00:02:02.880> for<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.390> cyber<00:02:03.810> galaxy

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
would always say go for the cyber galaxy

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.109 
would always say go for the cyber galaxy
wheel<00:02:04.380> it's<00:02:05.040> a<00:02:05.189> lot<00:02:05.340> quieter<00:02:05.520> without<00:02:05.909> having

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
wheel it's a lot quieter without having

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.059 
wheel it's a lot quieter without having
to<00:02:06.240> do<00:02:06.479> anything<00:02:06.840> to<00:02:07.049> it<00:02:07.170> with<00:02:07.590> this<00:02:07.710> wheel<00:02:07.890> you

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
to do anything to it with this wheel you

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.770 
to do anything to it with this wheel you
could<00:02:08.220> easily<00:02:08.340> fix<00:02:08.700> it<00:02:08.940> put<00:02:09.390> a<00:02:09.420> bit<00:02:09.569> of<00:02:09.629> olive

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
could easily fix it put a bit of olive

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.199 
could easily fix it put a bit of olive
oil<00:02:10.110> off<00:02:10.349> or<00:02:10.560> liquid<00:02:11.250> soap<00:02:11.459> and<00:02:11.700> it<00:02:12.120> would

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
oil off or liquid soap and it would

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.309 
oil off or liquid soap and it would
probably<00:02:12.450> be<00:02:12.540> fine

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
probably be fine

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.880 
probably be fine
but<00:02:13.939> for<00:02:14.939> the<00:02:15.030> quality<00:02:15.510> I'm<00:02:15.840> afraid<00:02:16.469> this<00:02:16.650> is

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
but for the quality I'm afraid this is

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.649 
but for the quality I'm afraid this is
definitely<00:02:17.280> the<00:02:17.430> better<00:02:17.549> one<00:02:17.790> this<00:02:18.299> from<00:02:18.510> me

00:02:18.649 --> 00:02:18.659 
definitely the better one this from me

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:20.569 
definitely the better one this from me
will<00:02:18.900> get<00:02:19.019> a<00:02:19.049> three<00:02:19.260> star<00:02:19.530> and<00:02:20.159> this<00:02:20.310> is

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:20.579 
will get a three star and this is

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:24.649 
will get a three star and this is
getting<00:02:21.030> a<00:02:21.239> star<00:02:21.629> and<00:02:21.780> a<00:02:21.810> half<00:02:22.129> because<00:02:23.129> I<00:02:23.659> was

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:24.659 
getting a star and a half because I was

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:26.390 
getting a star and a half because I was
just<00:02:24.749> expecting<00:02:25.079> so<00:02:25.469> much<00:02:25.650> more<00:02:25.709> from<00:02:25.920> it<00:02:26.159> and

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
just expecting so much more from it and

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.509 
just expecting so much more from it and
it<00:02:26.879> was<00:02:26.999> a<00:02:27.030> real<00:02:27.239> disappointment<00:02:27.450> to<00:02:27.870> me<00:02:28.189> so<00:02:29.189> I

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:29.519 
it was a real disappointment to me so I

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:31.550 
it was a real disappointment to me so I
