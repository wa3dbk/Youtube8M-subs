think determination is also falls into
that<00:01:52.130> category<00:01:52.190> I<00:01:52.940> believe<00:01:53.360> that<00:01:53.569> there's<00:01:53.780> a

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
that category I believe that there's a

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.100 
that category I believe that there's a
strict<00:01:55.250> routine<00:01:55.759> so<00:01:56.300> to<00:01:56.360> speak<00:01:56.630> that<00:01:56.690> you<00:01:56.929> have

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
strict routine so to speak that you have

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:58.839 
strict routine so to speak that you have
to<00:01:57.259> go<00:01:57.410> through<00:01:57.679> if<00:01:57.860> you<00:01:58.009> want<00:01:58.220> success<00:01:58.610> and

00:01:58.839 --> 00:01:58.849 
to go through if you want success and

00:01:58.849 --> 00:02:00.430 
to go through if you want success and
ultimately<00:01:59.300> at<00:01:59.479> the<00:01:59.539> end<00:01:59.660> and<00:01:59.899> that's<00:02:00.140> one

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.440 
ultimately at the end and that's one

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.650 
ultimately at the end and that's one
