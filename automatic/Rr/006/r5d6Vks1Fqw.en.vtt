00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.319 
basically the ships are pretty simple so
I'm<00:01:00.149> not<00:01:00.390> ready<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:00.949> put<00:01:01.949> in<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:02.550> template<00:01:03.120> for

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
I'm not ready to put in a template for

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.750 
I'm not ready to put in a template for
this<00:01:03.510> tutorial<00:01:03.890> you<00:01:04.890> are<00:01:04.920> just<00:01:05.220> going<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.430> cut

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
this tutorial you are just going to cut

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.880 
this tutorial you are just going to cut
out<00:01:05.909> a<00:01:06.119> smaller<00:01:06.570> circle<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:07.229> a<00:01:07.380> bigger<00:01:07.619> circle

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
out a smaller circle and a bigger circle

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.010 
out a smaller circle and a bigger circle
so<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.430> small<00:01:08.700> circles<00:01:09.119> going<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.360> be<00:01:09.450> for<00:01:09.780> the

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
so the small circles going to be for the

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.719 
so the small circles going to be for the
head<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.530> then<00:01:11.010> you<00:01:11.100> just<00:01:11.250> got<00:01:11.369> it<00:01:11.460> cut<00:01:11.580> like

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
head and then you just got it cut like

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.969 
head and then you just got it cut like
little<00:01:12.150> curves<00:01:12.450> like<00:01:12.630> this<00:01:12.689> so<00:01:13.500> you<00:01:13.590> need<00:01:13.740> two

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
little curves like this so you need two

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.219 
little curves like this so you need two
pieces<00:01:14.220> of<00:01:14.400> this<00:01:14.640> for<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.000> head<00:01:15.210> and<00:01:15.420> then<00:01:16.020> you

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
pieces of this for the head and then you

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:16.700 
pieces of this for the head and then you
be<00:01:16.409> needing

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
be needing

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.910 
be needing
um<00:01:17.009> two<00:01:17.580> bigger<00:01:17.850> circles<00:01:18.330> and<00:01:19.170> you're<00:01:19.770> gonna

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
um two bigger circles and you're gonna

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.590 
um two bigger circles and you're gonna
do<00:01:20.159> that<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.460> some<00:01:20.610> jagged<00:01:20.820> thing<00:01:21.119> around<00:01:21.420> the

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
do that to some jagged thing around the

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.359 
do that to some jagged thing around the
edges<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.140> then<00:01:22.200> just<00:01:22.590> cut<00:01:22.799> a<00:01:22.830> straight<00:01:23.159> line

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
edges and then just cut a straight line

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.249 
edges and then just cut a straight line
across<00:01:23.670> after<00:01:24.090> day<00:01:24.299> but<00:01:24.600> if<00:01:24.810> you<00:01:24.960> really

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
across after day but if you really

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.710 
across after day but if you really
really<00:01:25.470> do<00:01:25.710> what<00:01:25.920> you<00:01:26.130> have<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:27.299> size<00:01:27.540> that

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
really do what you have the size that

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.090 
really do what you have the size that
I'm<00:01:27.900> done<00:01:28.080> it<00:01:28.200> which<00:01:28.439> is<00:01:28.560> really<00:01:28.710> gotta<00:01:29.040> be

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
I'm done it which is really gotta be

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.490 
I'm done it which is really gotta be
pretty<00:01:29.369> small<00:01:29.759> we<00:01:30.659> can<00:01:30.810> just<00:01:30.990> let<00:01:31.079> me<00:01:31.200> know<00:01:31.229> no

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
pretty small we can just let me know no

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.050 
pretty small we can just let me know no
this<00:01:31.740> force<00:01:31.979> up<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.159> template<00:01:32.520> for<00:01:32.700> you<00:01:32.850> and

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
this force up the template for you and

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.100 
this force up the template for you and
then<00:01:33.540> I<00:01:33.720> use<00:01:33.930> a<00:01:34.140> page<00:01:34.380> comment<00:01:34.890> um<00:01:35.689> felt<00:01:36.689> easier

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
then I use a page comment um felt easier

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.780 
then I use a page comment um felt easier

stitching everything up in the front and
basically<00:04:24.760> this<00:04:24.880> is<00:04:25.060> how<00:04:25.210> the<00:04:25.270> jump<00:04:25.570> ring

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
basically this is how the jump ring

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.060 
basically this is how the jump ring
should<00:04:25.990> look<00:04:26.170> like<00:04:26.200> in<00:04:26.560> a<00:04:26.650> panic

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
should look like in a panic

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.610 
should look like in a panic
come<00:04:27.310> on<00:04:27.490> to<00:04:27.730> the<00:04:27.850> side<00:04:28.120> so<00:04:29.050> as<00:04:29.080> you<00:04:29.410> can<00:04:29.560> see

little clashes with jump rings made me

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:42.780 
little clashes with jump rings made me
so<00:04:41.260> final<00:04:41.980> step<00:04:42.160> we're<00:04:42.340> just<00:04:42.460> going<00:04:42.610> to<00:04:42.670> take
