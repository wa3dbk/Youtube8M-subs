00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.000
 very early and take a good position here 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:45.540
 side iniste I got more or less to the 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.040
 noon but still I was full 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:52.720
 It was full and the concert starts at 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:55.420
 8 and took nine hours here then is 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:58.030
 hard also because it's cold sun and like 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.290
 it was drizzling then it was hard 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.000
 but good you are going to enter 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:02.560

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.760

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.760
 seen thank you 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.780
 we have lived today with the emotion of 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.240
 these girls when receiving for the second time 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.510
 that in Colombia there is a band from Korea 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.710
 from the south 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:27.800
 I need some questions and so 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.800
 for example 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:35.220
 whom I not only do not 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.220
 and 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.969
 and a malta duty of all 7 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.430
 in front the moments 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:55.030
 the speaker 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.030
 good good is a speaker 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:24.230
 this concert I willingly like 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:33.269
 you learn by listening to the music too 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:36.390
 it's difficult because you almost do not know if 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:39.329
 you learn more by watching art programs 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.829
 but let's say you already like fractions 

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:43.250
 unthinkable comes a word that 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:43.250
 you know 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.939
 serious 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.939
 yes she
