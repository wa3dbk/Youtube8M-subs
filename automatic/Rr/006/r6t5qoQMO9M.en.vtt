okay<00:00:10.990> next<00:00:11.170> we<00:00:11.350> just<00:00:11.380> have<00:00:11.650> to<00:00:11.800> remove<00:00:12.040> the

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
okay next we just have to remove the

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.410 
okay next we just have to remove the
timing<00:00:13.450> belt<00:00:13.630> cover<00:00:13.840> on<00:00:14.559> there's<00:00:15.520> two<00:00:15.760> parts

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:16.420 
timing belt cover on there's two parts

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:17.210 
timing belt cover on there's two parts
to<00:00:16.510> it

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
to it

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.130 
to it
start<00:00:18.220> with<00:00:18.340> removing<00:00:18.760> the<00:00:18.849> upper<00:00:19.090> one<00:00:19.270> which

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:20.140 
start with removing the upper one which

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:57.090 
start with removing the upper one which
is<00:00:20.290> pretty<00:00:20.470> easy<00:00:22.980> 10<00:00:23.980> ml<00:00:24.450> socket<00:00:25.450> on<00:00:25.689> these<00:00:56.100> and

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.100 
is pretty easy 10 ml socket on these and

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:57.750 
is pretty easy 10 ml socket on these and
from<00:00:57.339> there

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760 
from there

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:05.670 
from there
should<00:00:58.330> we<00:00:58.510> just<00:00:59.040> slide<00:01:00.040> it<00:01:00.220> up<00:01:02.100> or<00:01:03.100> not<00:01:04.680> and

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680 
should we just slide it up or not and

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.219 
should we just slide it up or not and
we've<00:01:05.950> been<00:01:06.130> able<00:01:06.250> to<00:01:06.490> expose<00:01:07.320> now<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:09.340> top<00:01:09.580> it

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
we've been able to expose now the top it

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:18.450 
we've been able to expose now the top it
depending<00:01:11.229> go<00:01:16.530> so<00:01:17.530> what<00:01:17.649> has<00:01:17.770> to<00:01:17.799> happen<00:01:17.979> next

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:18.460 
depending go so what has to happen next

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.020 
depending go so what has to happen next
is<00:01:18.909> we<00:01:19.390> have<00:01:19.539> to<00:01:19.780> take<00:01:20.020> now<00:01:20.500> the<00:01:21.189> lower<00:01:21.399> portion

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
is we have to take now the lower portion

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:28.590 
is we have to take now the lower portion
of<00:01:22.899> the<00:01:24.420> timing<00:01:25.420> belt<00:01:25.479> cover<00:01:27.329> off<00:01:28.329> of<00:01:28.359> the

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
of the timing belt cover off of the

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.539 
of the timing belt cover off of the
engine<00:01:28.689> and<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:30.850> do<00:01:31.000> that<00:01:31.649> same<00:01:32.649> thing<00:01:32.679> 10<00:01:33.369> now

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:33.549 
engine and to do that same thing 10 now

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:36.660 
engine and to do that same thing 10 now
socket<00:01:34.090> there's<00:01:35.049> a<00:01:35.109> number<00:01:35.289> of<00:01:35.469> bolts<00:01:35.679> kind<00:01:36.609> of

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
socket there's a number of bolts kind of

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.389 
socket there's a number of bolts kind of
around<00:01:36.850> the<00:01:37.030> perimeter<00:01:37.420> of<00:01:37.450> it<00:01:37.600> I<00:01:38.159> can't<00:01:39.159> find

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:39.399 
around the perimeter of it I can't find

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:40.950 
around the perimeter of it I can't find
a<00:01:39.520> good<00:01:39.549> camera<00:01:40.090> angle<00:01:40.179> to<00:01:40.450> kind<00:01:40.630> of<00:01:40.659> show<00:01:40.840> it

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
a good camera angle to kind of show it

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.340 
a good camera angle to kind of show it
to<00:01:41.109> you<00:01:41.200> but<00:01:41.710> um<00:01:42.039> I'm<00:01:42.399> sure<00:01:42.670> you'll<00:01:42.820> find<00:01:42.999> them

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
to you but um I'm sure you'll find them

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.039 
to you but um I'm sure you'll find them
so<00:01:44.350> I'm<00:01:44.679> going<00:01:44.829> to<00:01:44.859> do<00:01:45.039> that<00:01:45.189> now<00:01:45.369> and<00:01:45.609> then

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
so I'm going to do that now and then

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:52.330 
so I'm going to do that now and then
we'll<00:01:47.049> pick<00:01:47.229> it<00:01:47.350> up<00:01:47.439> from<00:01:47.590> there

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.920 

I'll<00:01:53.340> just<00:01:53.550> say<00:01:53.730> one<00:01:54.120> additional<00:01:54.540> thing<00:01:54.690> about

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
I'll just say one additional thing about

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.860 
I'll just say one additional thing about
taking<00:01:55.260> the<00:01:55.670> bottom<00:01:56.670> cover<00:01:56.940> off<00:01:57.180> of<00:01:57.480> the

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:57.870 
taking the bottom cover off of the

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:00.830 
taking the bottom cover off of the
timing<00:01:58.170> belt<00:01:58.790> as<00:01:59.790> you're<00:02:00.210> going<00:02:00.570> about<00:02:00.690> it

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
timing belt as you're going about it

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.610 
timing belt as you're going about it
you'll<00:02:01.080> probably<00:02:01.430> discover<00:02:02.430> that<00:02:03.110> the<00:02:04.110> bolt

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:04.620 
you'll probably discover that the bolt

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:06.880 
you'll probably discover that the bolt
that<00:02:04.800> holds<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:05.160> cover<00:02:05.400> on<00:02:05.700> that's<00:02:06.300> the

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
that holds the cover on that's the

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.090 
that holds the cover on that's the
second<00:02:07.890> down<00:02:08.670> on<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.119> left<00:02:09.330> side<00:02:09.630> is<00:02:10.100> really

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
second down on the left side is really

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.590 
second down on the left side is really
difficult<00:02:11.400> to<00:02:11.700> get<00:02:11.940> to<00:02:12.410> the<00:02:13.410> trick<00:02:13.680> is<00:02:13.970> to<00:02:14.970> just

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
difficult to get to the trick is to just

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.470 
difficult to get to the trick is to just
make<00:02:16.590> sure<00:02:16.620> that<00:02:17.360> your<00:02:18.890> power-steering

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
make sure that your power-steering

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.310 
make sure that your power-steering
tensioner<00:02:21.480> bolt

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
tensioner bolt

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.650 
tensioner bolt
remember<00:02:23.040> we<00:02:23.220> loosened<00:02:24.000> that<00:02:24.090> earlier<00:02:24.510> when

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
remember we loosened that earlier when

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.410 
remember we loosened that earlier when
we<00:02:24.720> were<00:02:24.810> loosening<00:02:25.170> the<00:02:25.320> power-steering

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
we were loosening the power-steering

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.010 
we were loosening the power-steering
belt<00:02:27.420> is<00:02:27.660> turned<00:02:28.290> all<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:29.010> way<00:02:29.100> out<00:02:29.280> because

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
belt is turned all the way out because

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.780 
belt is turned all the way out because
the<00:02:31.020> threaded<00:02:31.709> shaft<00:02:31.920> of<00:02:32.190> the<00:02:32.250> bolt<00:02:32.430> actually

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
the threaded shaft of the bolt actually

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.790 
the threaded shaft of the bolt actually
kind<00:02:33.450> of<00:02:33.480> intersects<00:02:34.050> the<00:02:34.350> area<00:02:34.590> that<00:02:34.740> you

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
kind of intersects the area that you

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.850 
kind of intersects the area that you
need<00:02:34.950> to<00:02:35.160> get<00:02:35.340> into<00:02:35.459> to<00:02:35.820> get<00:02:35.970> the<00:02:36.590> timing<00:02:37.590> belt

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
need to get into to get the timing belt

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.280 
need to get into to get the timing belt
cover<00:02:38.010> bolt<00:02:38.310> out<00:02:38.490> that<00:02:38.670> second<00:02:39.090> bolt<00:02:39.270> and<00:02:39.450> then

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
cover bolt out that second bolt and then

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.930 
cover bolt out that second bolt and then
the<00:02:40.680> other<00:02:40.800> tip<00:02:41.040> is<00:02:41.070> is<00:02:41.430> that<00:02:41.580> it's<00:02:41.700> much

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
the other tip is is that it's much

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.940 
the other tip is is that it's much
easier<00:02:42.300> to<00:02:42.420> get<00:02:42.540> to<00:02:42.600> it<00:02:42.870> from<00:02:43.320> underneath<00:02:43.650> the

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
easier to get to it from underneath the

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.320 
easier to get to it from underneath the
car<00:02:44.130> than<00:02:44.400> trying<00:02:44.640> to<00:02:44.700> go<00:02:44.790> in<00:02:44.910> from<00:02:45.060> the<00:02:45.150> top

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
car than trying to go in from the top

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.430 
car than trying to go in from the top
just<00:02:46.190> get<00:02:47.190> on<00:02:47.310> a<00:02:47.630> creeper<00:02:48.630> or<00:02:48.900> piece<00:02:49.410> of

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
just get on a creeper or piece of

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.530 
just get on a creeper or piece of
cardboard<00:02:49.920> get<00:02:50.100> under<00:02:50.280> the<00:02:50.400> car<00:02:50.580> and<00:02:50.880> reach<00:02:51.330> up

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
cardboard get under the car and reach up

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:52.820 
cardboard get under the car and reach up
from<00:02:51.750> underneath<00:02:51.959> or<00:02:52.410> reach<00:02:52.500> up<00:02:52.650> from

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
from underneath or reach up from

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.090 
from underneath or reach up from
underneath<00:02:53.130> using<00:02:53.730> a<00:02:54.110> small<00:02:55.110> 10mm<00:02:55.500> socket<00:02:55.709> and

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
underneath using a small 10mm socket and

a quarter inch drive and you'll be able

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:05.290 
a quarter inch drive and you'll be able
to<00:02:58.830> get<00:02:58.950> a<00:02:58.980> wrench<00:02:59.160> on<00:02:59.340> it<00:02:59.400> and<00:02:59.700> spin<00:02:59.910> it<00:03:00.000> off

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.430 

okay<00:03:06.300> at<00:03:06.420> this<00:03:06.540> point<00:03:06.600> we're<00:03:06.959> actually<00:03:07.080> ready

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:53.350 
a look at it you'll be most interested

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:56.460 
a look at it you'll be most interested
probably<00:04:53.650> looking<00:04:54.010> at<00:04:54.100> the<00:04:54.280> teeth<00:04:54.520> and<00:04:55.470> seeing

probably looking at the teeth and seeing
if<00:04:56.590> any<00:04:56.740> of<00:04:56.860> them<00:04:56.950> have<00:04:57.160> been<00:04:57.340> kind<00:04:57.580> of<00:04:59.370> cupped

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.370 
if any of them have been kind of cupped

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:03.780 
if any of them have been kind of cupped
off<00:05:00.580> on<00:05:00.940> one<00:05:01.150> side<00:05:01.450> from<00:05:01.870> where<00:05:02.200> or<00:05:02.620> if<00:05:03.610> there's

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:03.790 
off on one side from where or if there's

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:06.540 
off on one side from where or if there's
some<00:05:03.970> cracking<00:05:04.510> or<00:05:04.720> anything<00:05:04.900> like<00:05:05.170> that<00:05:05.550> this

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:06.550 
some cracking or anything like that this

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:08.190 
some cracking or anything like that this
belt<00:05:06.850> that<00:05:07.000> I've<00:05:07.090> taken<00:05:07.330> off<00:05:07.600> looks<00:05:07.840> like<00:05:08.020> it's

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:08.200 
belt that I've taken off looks like it's

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.980 
belt that I've taken off looks like it's
in<00:05:08.350> pretty<00:05:08.380> good<00:05:08.770> shape<00:05:09.480> I'm<00:05:10.480> changing<00:05:10.900> it

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:10.990 
in pretty good shape I'm changing it

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:15.780 
in pretty good shape I'm changing it
more<00:05:11.200> for<00:05:12.100> age<00:05:12.310> rather<00:05:12.730> than<00:05:12.970> mileage<00:05:14.790> but

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:15.790 
more for age rather than mileage but

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:17.870 
more for age rather than mileage but
definitely<00:05:16.150> take<00:05:16.270> a<00:05:16.300> look<00:05:16.510> look<00:05:16.990> for<00:05:17.200> fraying

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 
definitely take a look look for fraying

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:21.000 
definitely take a look look for fraying
also<00:05:18.880> look<00:05:19.060> to<00:05:19.090> see<00:05:19.240> if<00:05:19.540> the<00:05:20.020> belt<00:05:20.260> is<00:05:20.530> covered

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:21.010

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:23.580 
also look to see if the belt is covered
in<00:05:21.360> any<00:05:22.360> sort<00:05:22.570> of<00:05:22.630> oil<00:05:22.870> or<00:05:23.110> anything<00:05:23.290> like<00:05:23.530> that
