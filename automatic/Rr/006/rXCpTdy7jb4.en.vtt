I've<00:03:13.940> seen<00:03:14.239> it<00:03:14.420> a<00:03:14.630> lot<00:03:14.989> of<00:03:15.290> times<00:03:15.470> on<00:03:15.620> Instagram

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
I've seen it a lot of times on Instagram

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.250 
I've seen it a lot of times on Instagram
where<00:03:16.190> people<00:03:16.580> will<00:03:16.820> put<00:03:17.420> their<00:03:17.450> GoPro<00:03:17.959> in<00:03:18.140> the

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
where people will put their GoPro in the

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.590 
where people will put their GoPro in the
hole<00:03:18.440> and<00:03:18.680> then<00:03:19.190> take<00:03:19.370> a<00:03:19.400> shot<00:03:19.790> facing<00:03:20.269> upwards

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600 
hole and then take a shot facing upwards

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:21.790 
hole and then take a shot facing upwards
and<00:03:20.720> it<00:03:20.840> actually<00:03:20.989> looks<00:03:21.260> really<00:03:21.350> cool

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:21.800 
and it actually looks really cool

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:25.210 
and it actually looks really cool
because<00:03:22.040> of<00:03:22.190> the<00:03:22.430> fisheye<00:03:22.940> effect<00:03:23.140> so<00:03:24.220> it's

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
because of the fisheye effect so it's

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.160 
because of the fisheye effect so it's
gonna<00:03:25.310> take<00:03:25.459> a<00:03:25.519> while<00:03:25.670> I<00:03:25.730> think<00:03:26.150> it's<00:03:26.870> not<00:03:27.019> easy

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
gonna take a while I think it's not easy
