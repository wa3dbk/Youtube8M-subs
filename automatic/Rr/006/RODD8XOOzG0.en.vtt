00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.559
 the raffle of the next one was carried out 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.990
 world after a minute of silence 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.119
 for the sensitive death of Nelson Mandela 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.360
 some musical other representations 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.650
 of good dancing the Mexican team of 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.090
 football finally knew that he will have to 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.590
 face brazil with abbas and cameroon 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.960
 in the next football world cup the 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.270
 draw of the world cup led them to 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.160
 group has selected for the host 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.810
 against two more teams of very styles 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.340
 different one European and another African and 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:37.079
 even when all three parties are 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.880
 would find in relatively stadiums 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.860
 the Mexican national team is close 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.990
 He insisted on staying inside the headquarters 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.880
 that I had previously chosen in 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:46.830
 strength so the distance can 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.840
 be a factor in the world that 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:50.940
 will dispute in the South American country but 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.160
 well that will worry about 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.460
 months more in a lot of work to do 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.500
 let's review how the groups were 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:01.730
 beginning with the one to mexico burst 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.110
 good and here is group a where 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:07.079
 Miguel Herrera is going to have to win 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.030
 obstacles like brazil croatia and cameroon 

00:01:07.079 --> 00:01:12.380
 how good he is happy for this 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.240
 group if we pass 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.759
 if you think 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.250
 out there is this has the two 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:21.409
 finalists spain champion holland 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.060
 runner-up that complicated for chile that 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:25.759
 had a good eliminator in the 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:31.549
 conmebol and australia also going through 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:35.149
 asia good today we see the group c in 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:37.490
 Where Colombia should sleep peacefully 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:39.560
 having one of the groups in theory more 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.200
 accessible however ivory coast 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.330
 part as second favorite japan has 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.520
 grown up and wants to prove females and 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:49.640
 while greece has looked very 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:52.819
 regulate if they sleep peacefully 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:55.610
 that are not these Uruguay because I see 

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:58.280
 costa rica not calm because 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.950
 uruguay is complicated england nor is 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.770
 say in Italy 22 Europeans which the 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.370
 another from uruguay in that hype x that so much 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.460
 we were surprised 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:11.670
 good and now let's review the group 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:14.280
 where France was afraid to leave 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.230
 of the hype of Europeans stayed and was 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.600
 placed in another of the groups called 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.600
 easy switzerland will look to surprise 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:25.710
 while Ecuador and Honduras will leave 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:27.830
 as victims we go to the effect of well what 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:30.150
 said cardigan such is the simplest 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.460
 argentina with bosnia herzegovina that has 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.400
 his football has grown a lot but let's go no no 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:38.489

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:41.099

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:42.900
 of the death groups the brothers 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:45.420

 the third force and klismann now with 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:59.939

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:02.459
