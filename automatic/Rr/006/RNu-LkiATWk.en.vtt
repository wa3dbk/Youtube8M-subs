00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:25.060
 hello welcome, I'll show you 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.820
 create quite complete themes 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.470
 I mean that when creating themes 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.930
 there are some people who say that they do not 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:34.600
 the options to edit the 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:36.789
 Panel control images are worth 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.350
 let's go to this area of ​​this window and 

00:00:36.789 --> 00:00:40.690
 we see that here, I, for example, have 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.339
 added my logo this image that says 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.050
 that there is no no etc 

00:00:42.339 --> 00:00:45.519
 some people say that at the time of 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.170
 create your topics from scratch do not 

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:50.890
 appear the options to change those 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:53.829
 images are perfect, this is due to 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:56.530
 because if you have this version 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:58.930
 of the bibles stage the 1.6 beta that 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:01.149
 I left my blog on this occasion you can not 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:04.750
 so for this they will need then another 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:06.940
 resource of another topic since then those that 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.789
 we have the most recent version of this one 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:12.460
 wilder that logically not anyone the 

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:15.600
 may have already know that many can not 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:18.250
 spend enough to get it 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.590
 So in this area, I'm going to open 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.600
 a file sorry or in this a subject 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.860
 new and for those people who 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.330
 we have the new version of these 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.830
 wílder well if we can go to the 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.710
 option to explore 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:32.020
 explorer control panel control panel 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.700
 navigation pen and with tom pain is where 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.980
 those images that he showed them are changed 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.600
 the beginning as it appears to us 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:42.220
 the options look here they see that we have 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:45.280
 the nation 'layer and the option 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:47.650
 of genuine etc is if we can indeed 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.990
 I'm going to open a topic that is already quite 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:52.260
 full I'm going to open the file 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.260
 evolution 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.950
 and well let's go to it are axial 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.810
 flowers flowers against the panel with the 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.729
 navigation penny condom I thought 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.159
 main options to change those 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:05.020
 images and we see that he has been 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:07.479
 return if you have it quite complete 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.940
 we see that there it is but this must be 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:13.900
 because he has been of evolution ha 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:16.120
 edited his style is worth this what 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.650
 we can use for those people who 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:22.120
 They have the version I left them my 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:24.840
 blog the beta 1.6 then I'm going to open what 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:29.260
 that would be a subject for example for example 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:32.080
 because the mac I'm going to open with the shell 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:34.180
 here is here is this file is the 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.680
 that is edited, but I'm going to open 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.680
 first restored to show them 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:44.700
 the restorer that we're going to use the two 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.490
 in one I'm going to drag the sky blue 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:50.690
 mac theme 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:52.690
 and in the other I'm going to open the style of 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.280
 the city of evolution 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.920
 and I'm going to show you quickly the 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:03:00.180
 changes that you see here are in the 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.180
 normal color is worth sixth 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:06.200
 It takes me back to me again 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.370
 ok I had a mess but it's already 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.890
 perfect we are going to put in this area the 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:20.439
 he is the one of the return and for this 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.360
 the brand of the theme mch 

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:24.819
 we are going to open the files to extend them 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:27.700
 sorry and we see that in the mac does not have 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:29.200
 as many options as her return 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:33.280
 in the return session we have the 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:35.260
 explorer frame the ya 32 system etc 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.659
 we have but we see that the great that 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:40.540
 because the creator of this theme 

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:42.790
 Mr. Green has edited these 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.239
 style and then it has been put 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:47.470
 commands etc so you can then 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:49.389
 visualize the subject much better and that 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:52.120
 this one more complete at the time of 

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:54.200
 edit it then what we can 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.930
 do is consequent 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.160
 you who have this version 1.6 beta 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.319
 what they are going to do is then open 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:03.709
 normally your 'stand' wilder raise to 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:05.300
 open file and they will open the topic 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:07.849
 evolution if you do not have in the subject 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:10.099
 of revolution I will leave you in the 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:11.569
 description of the very blog video so that 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:13.310
 you can go to the section of 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:15.440
 themes and download the theme file from 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:18.079
 blues john for windows 8 and 8.1 is worth 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.419
 then once opened that already 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:24.860
 can go to the option of explorer 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:26.450
 explorer items items do not forgive me 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.910
 wrong control panel control panel 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:32.300
 navigation and cotton p will be able to change 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:33.860
 the clear images of course and the 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:37.250
 may change but that's because 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:39.470
 we are using the hd as a reference 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:41.630
 so then you can change the 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:45.350
 images but what they will have to do 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:47.450
 it is to pass your images of the 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:49.370
 windows in the taskbar what 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:51.440
 you have edited the evolution hd 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:55.070
 in reference what we are doing is 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:56.600
 simply then edit the file 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:58.520
 evolution with our own pieces 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.780
 ok then it will no longer be the subject of 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.040
 evolution after that because I already 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:03.440
 we can change 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.910
 but mainly I do this because 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.520
 many people say they can not 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:10.670
 change these images but already once 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:13.700
 opening the topic of evolution will leave us 

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:15.710
 these options are valid and from here onwards 

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:18.020
 from here we can make our theme 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:21.420
 from scratch so we can then 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:23.370
 we already create it in our system 

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:25.770
 perfect already mentioned that is 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:27.990
 only for people who have 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:29.760
 the beta version 1.6 that I left my blog 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:31.200
 and for those people that we have 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:33.450
 because this recent version is not 

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:35.280
 need to do it with the subject is 

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:38.340
 evolution since you can say it we can 

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:39.390
 and avoid those images because it made 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:41.910
 Well here is also what we here 

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:44.820
 appears the names of what are the 

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:46.710
 images and etc well I hope you have them 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:50.160
 liked me I am oscar action 81 no 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:51.810
 forget that if you have doubts 

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:54.300
 they are helping in something not well in 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:55.980
 contact me on my facebook since then 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:59.130
 there I am therefore receiving all the 

00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:00.510
 messages that can send me this is worth 

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:02.870
 it has been all on my part until the 

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:02.870
 next 

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:25.750
 for life
