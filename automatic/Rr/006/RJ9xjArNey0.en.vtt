at the internet and we say look it was a
text<00:00:14.490> based<00:00:14.700> internet<00:00:15.710> but<00:00:16.710> now<00:00:16.920> we<00:00:16.980> believe

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
text based internet but now we believe

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:18.859 
text based internet but now we believe
the<00:00:17.550> internet<00:00:17.880> is<00:00:18.000> evolving<00:00:18.359> and<00:00:18.720> it's

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
the internet is evolving and it's

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.689 
the internet is evolving and it's
heading<00:00:19.170> towards<00:00:19.350> that<00:00:19.529> second<00:00:20.100> wave<00:00:20.340> or<00:00:20.609> the

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
heading towards that second wave or the

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.120 
heading towards that second wave or the
next<00:00:20.970> generation<00:00:21.689> and<00:00:21.869> for<00:00:22.320> this<00:00:22.529> wave<00:00:22.800> of<00:00:22.830> the

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
next generation and for this wave of the

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.160 
next generation and for this wave of the
internet<00:00:23.490> we<00:00:24.029> believe<00:00:24.330> it's<00:00:24.779> out<00:00:24.990> of<00:00:25.019> the

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
internet we believe it's out of the

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.830 
internet we believe it's out of the
silent<00:00:25.439> into<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.369> talkies<00:00:26.789> and<00:00:26.970> that's<00:00:27.510> where

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
silent into the talkies and that's where

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.939 
silent into the talkies and that's where
we<00:00:28.050> lead<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.500> way<00:00:30.050> so<00:00:31.050> as<00:00:31.080> a<00:00:31.170> result<00:00:31.410> I<00:00:31.740> think

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
we lead the way so as a result I think

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.020 
we lead the way so as a result I think
all<00:00:32.099> of<00:00:32.130> a<00:00:32.250> sudden<00:00:32.579> we're<00:00:32.700> going<00:00:32.820> to<00:00:32.880> start
