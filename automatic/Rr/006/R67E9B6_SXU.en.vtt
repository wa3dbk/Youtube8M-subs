but a couple of possibilities based on

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:55.930 
but a couple of possibilities based on
whether<00:00:54.229> we<00:00:54.350> saw<00:00:54.499> this<00:00:54.679> week<00:00:54.890> the<00:00:55.519> first<00:00:55.760> one

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
that only for a couple reasons I'm

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.069 
that only for a couple reasons I'm
personally<00:01:13.280> in<00:01:13.460> the<00:01:13.790> camp<00:01:14.060> that<00:01:14.299> I<00:01:14.540> think<00:01:14.930> that

00:01:15.069 --> 00:01:15.079 
personally in the camp that I think that

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:16.959 
personally in the camp that I think that
actually<00:01:15.409> was<00:01:15.590> Kakashi<00:01:15.979> that<00:01:16.310> used<00:01:16.820> the

00:01:16.959 --> 00:01:16.969 
actually was Kakashi that used the

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:19.420 
actually was Kakashi that used the
Lightning<00:01:17.329> blade<00:01:17.509> to<00:01:17.689> kill<00:01:17.899> rent<00:01:18.170> and<00:01:18.430> the

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
Lightning blade to kill rent and the

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:20.830 
Lightning blade to kill rent and the
reason<00:01:19.640> why<00:01:19.729> I<00:01:19.759> believe<00:01:19.969> that<00:01:20.119> is<00:01:20.329> two<00:01:20.479> reasons

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
reason why I believe that is two reasons

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.350 
reason why I believe that is two reasons
the<00:01:20.899> first<00:01:20.960> reason<00:01:21.229> is<00:01:21.619> that<00:01:21.909> Kakashi<00:01:22.909> was

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
the first reason is that Kakashi was

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.999 
the first reason is that Kakashi was
crying<00:01:23.689> at<00:01:23.810> the<00:01:23.869> end<00:01:24.020> of<00:01:24.079> the<00:01:24.170> chapter<00:01:24.380> when<00:01:24.770> he

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:25.009 
crying at the end of the chapter when he

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:26.679 
crying at the end of the chapter when he
you<00:01:25.340> know<00:01:25.430> attacked<00:01:25.939> Rin<00:01:26.210> and<00:01:26.240> you<00:01:26.479> saw<00:01:26.630> the

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:26.689 
you know attacked Rin and you saw the

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:29.200 
you know attacked Rin and you saw the
panel<00:01:27.020> of<00:01:27.079> his<00:01:27.200> face<00:01:27.409> he<00:01:28.039> was<00:01:28.250> you<00:01:28.579> know<00:01:28.610> crying

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
panel of his face he was you know crying

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:30.310 
panel of his face he was you know crying
so<00:01:29.479> it<00:01:29.630> makes<00:01:29.750> me<00:01:29.899> think<00:01:30.079> that<00:01:30.109> that's

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
so it makes me think that that's

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.200 
so it makes me think that that's
actually<00:01:30.530> Kakashi<00:01:30.979> why<00:01:31.250> wouldn't<00:01:31.549> I<00:01:31.670> zetsu

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
actually Kakashi why wouldn't I zetsu

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.779 
actually Kakashi why wouldn't I zetsu

the<00:01:53.060> image<00:01:53.570> of<00:01:53.719> grim<00:01:54.229> being<00:01:54.439> stared<00:01:54.710> to<00:01:54.799> the

the image of grim being stared to the

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.319 
the image of grim being stared to the
chest<00:01:55.130> so<00:01:55.340> it<00:01:55.399> makes<00:01:55.579> sense<00:01:55.700> since<00:01:56.000> their<00:01:56.179> eyes

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:56.329 
chest so it makes sense since their eyes

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:58.330 
chest so it makes sense since their eyes
are<00:01:56.539> linked<00:01:56.840> that<00:01:57.259> he<00:01:57.710> got<00:01:57.890> that<00:01:58.039> image<00:01:58.310> right

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
are linked that he got that image right

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:59.889 
are linked that he got that image right
at<00:01:58.609> the<00:01:58.670> same<00:01:58.850> time<00:01:59.030> in<00:01:59.179> Kakashi<00:01:59.479> did<00:01:59.780> and

00:01:59.889 --> 00:01:59.899 
at the same time in Kakashi did and

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:01.239 
at the same time in Kakashi did and
that's<00:02:00.049> how<00:02:00.170> come<00:02:00.350> he<00:02:00.439> was<00:02:00.560> able<00:02:00.679> to<00:02:00.859> see<00:02:01.130> it

00:02:01.239 --> 00:02:01.249 
that's how come he was able to see it

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:04.810 
that's how come he was able to see it
that's<00:02:01.729> my<00:02:01.939> personal<00:02:02.479> thought<00:02:02.719> now<00:02:03.469> I<00:02:03.829> don't

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
that's my personal thought now I don't

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.219 
that's my personal thought now I don't
know<00:02:04.880> you<00:02:05.030> guys<00:02:05.149> think<00:02:05.420> about<00:02:05.570> it<00:02:05.810> personally

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
know you guys think about it personally

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:08.109 
know you guys think about it personally
but<00:02:06.380> this<00:02:06.560> is<00:02:06.710> just<00:02:06.740> wow<00:02:07.189> it's<00:02:07.460> really<00:02:07.759> really

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
but this is just wow it's really really

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.080 
but this is just wow it's really really
crazy<00:02:08.420> um<00:02:08.750> at<00:02:09.409> the<00:02:09.560> same<00:02:09.800> time<00:02:09.979> with<00:02:10.250> my<00:02:10.519> my

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
crazy um at the same time with my my

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.520 
crazy um at the same time with my my
prediction<00:02:11.540> of<00:02:11.599> it<00:02:11.750> actually<00:02:11.930> being<00:02:12.230> Kakashi

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
prediction of it actually being Kakashi

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.290 
prediction of it actually being Kakashi
it's<00:02:13.220> kind<00:02:13.430> of<00:02:13.459> weird<00:02:13.670> because<00:02:13.790> when

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
it's kind of weird because when

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.730 
it's kind of weird because when
uh you<00:02:14.960> know<00:02:15.020> we<00:02:15.140> see<00:02:15.260> always<00:02:15.380> 0<00:02:15.560> in<00:02:15.680> the

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:15.740 
uh you know we see always 0 in the

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.770 
uh you know we see always 0 in the
future<00:02:16.010> he<00:02:16.130> says<00:02:16.340> Takashi<00:02:16.790> you<00:02:16.940> letter<00:02:17.330> and<00:02:17.600> I

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
future he says Takashi you letter and I

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.380 
future he says Takashi you letter and I
not<00:02:18.470> you<00:02:18.590> killed<00:02:18.920> her<00:02:19.040> and<00:02:19.190> he<00:02:19.730> said<00:02:19.910> you<00:02:20.030> let

not you killed her and he said you let

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.080 
not you killed her and he said you let
rin<00:02:20.690> die<00:02:20.900> which<00:02:21.500> makes<00:02:21.770> me<00:02:21.920> think<00:02:21.950> I<00:02:22.460> don't

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
rin die which makes me think I don't

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.080 
rin die which makes me think I don't
know<00:02:23.210> it's<00:02:23.720> kind<00:02:24.020> of<00:02:24.050> weird<00:02:24.290> um<00:02:24.560> you<00:02:25.310> know<00:02:25.400> at

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
know it's kind of weird um you know at

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.880 
know it's kind of weird um you know at
the<00:02:26.360> same<00:02:26.540> time<00:02:26.780> he<00:02:27.050> let<00:02:27.260> me<00:02:27.440> said<00:02:27.680> that<00:02:27.710> he'll

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
the same time he let me said that he'll

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.100 
the same time he let me said that he'll
ever<00:02:28.070> and<00:02:28.250> I<00:02:28.430> but<00:02:28.850> he's<00:02:28.940> but<00:02:29.570> then<00:02:29.720> we<00:02:29.840> see<00:02:29.990> he

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
ever and I but he's but then we see he

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.950 
ever and I but he's but then we see he
sees<00:02:30.320> him<00:02:30.560> killing<00:02:31.010> her<00:02:31.220> in<00:02:31.430> person<00:02:31.930> so<00:02:32.930> I

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:32.960 
sees him killing her in person so I

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.750 
sees him killing her in person so I
don't<00:02:33.260> know<00:02:33.350> it's<00:02:33.530> really<00:02:33.680> hard<00:02:33.920> to<00:02:34.040> see<00:02:34.220> I<00:02:34.430> say

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
don't know it's really hard to see I say

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.970 
don't know it's really hard to see I say
what<00:02:34.940> exactly<00:02:35.330> happened<00:02:35.660> for<00:02:35.870> sure<00:02:36.020> but<00:02:36.590> you

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
what exactly happened for sure but you

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.830 
what exactly happened for sure but you
know<00:02:37.100> either<00:02:37.310> way<00:02:37.550> I<00:02:37.580> really<00:02:37.820> think<00:02:38.060> that<00:02:38.180> the

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
know either way I really think that the

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.110 
know either way I really think that the
zetsu<00:02:39.230> and<00:02:39.410> madara<00:02:39.790> zetsu's<00:02:40.790> amid<00:02:41.000> are

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
zetsu and madara zetsu's amid are

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.730 
zetsu and madara zetsu's amid are
actually<00:02:41.480> had<00:02:41.630> some<00:02:41.810> plan<00:02:42.020> in<00:02:42.200> as<00:02:42.320> obvious

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:42.740 
actually had some plan in as obvious

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:44.530 
actually had some plan in as obvious
it's<00:02:42.890> obvious<00:02:43.010> that<00:02:43.250> they<00:02:43.430> did<00:02:43.640> it's<00:02:44.360> too

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
it's obvious that they did it's too

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.450 
it's obvious that they did it's too
tough<00:02:44.750> perfectly<00:02:45.290> timed<00:02:45.380> everything<00:02:46.040> is<00:02:46.280> just

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:46.460 
tough perfectly timed everything is just

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:48.670 
tough perfectly timed everything is just
set<00:02:46.670> up<00:02:46.820> so<00:02:46.970> perfectly<00:02:47.180> it's<00:02:47.930> not<00:02:48.110> coincidence

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
set up so perfectly it's not coincidence

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.230 
set up so perfectly it's not coincidence
it<00:02:48.920> really<00:02:49.070> is<00:02:49.280> in<00:02:49.430> my<00:02:49.610> opinion<00:02:49.730> and

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:50.240 
it really is in my opinion and

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.270 
it really is in my opinion and
especially<00:02:50.840> the<00:02:51.050> factions<00:02:51.410> madura<00:02:51.770> when<00:02:52.190> he

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
especially the factions madura when he

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.250 
especially the factions madura when he
was<00:02:52.400> talking<00:02:52.550> to<00:02:52.910> Obito<00:02:53.390> when<00:02:53.870> he<00:02:53.990> was<00:02:54.110> leaving

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
was talking to Obito when he was leaving

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.410 
was talking to Obito when he was leaving
the<00:02:54.560> cave<00:02:54.710> he<00:02:55.340> said<00:02:55.580> you<00:02:55.760> know<00:02:55.850> don't<00:02:55.880> thank<00:02:56.330> me

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
the cave he said you know don't thank me

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.270 
the cave he said you know don't thank me
yet<00:02:56.510> you'll<00:02:56.870> be<00:02:56.990> coming<00:02:57.290> back<00:02:57.320> and<00:02:58.100> you'll

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
yet you'll be coming back and you'll

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.830 
yet you'll be coming back and you'll
feel<00:02:58.520> properly<00:02:58.940> thank<00:02:59.270> me<00:02:59.390> when<00:02:59.510> you<00:02:59.630> come

feel properly thank me when you come

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.060 
feel properly thank me when you come
back<00:03:00.020> so<00:03:00.290> it<00:03:00.350> makes<00:03:00.470> me<00:03:00.620> think<00:03:00.830> that<00:03:00.860> my

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
back so it makes me think that my

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:02.680 
back so it makes me think that my
daughter<00:03:01.250> was<00:03:01.640> what<00:03:02.300> was<00:03:02.420> going<00:03:02.570> to<00:03:02.600> happen

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
daughter was what was going to happen

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.320 
daughter was what was going to happen
and<00:03:03.200> was<00:03:03.650> planning<00:03:03.950> all<00:03:04.280> this<00:03:04.340> out<00:03:04.790> and<00:03:05.270> you

and was planning all this out and you

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.040 
and was planning all this out and you
know<00:03:06.200> I<00:03:06.380> really<00:03:06.530> think<00:03:06.740> that<00:03:06.860> obito<00:03:07.630> is<00:03:08.630> naive

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.050 
know I really think that obito is naive

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:10.750 
know I really think that obito is naive
but<00:03:09.230> I'm<00:03:09.350> think<00:03:09.530> he's<00:03:09.620> stupid<00:03:09.830> I<00:03:10.070> mean<00:03:10.250> how<00:03:10.700> do

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
but I'm think he's stupid I mean how do

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.100 
but I'm think he's stupid I mean how do
you<00:03:10.880> not<00:03:11.030> know<00:03:11.060> that<00:03:11.210> this<00:03:11.480> is<00:03:11.600> all<00:03:11.750> set<00:03:12.080> up

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
you not know that this is all set up

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:15.520 
you not know that this is all set up
it's<00:03:12.380> so<00:03:12.590> perfectly<00:03:13.130> placed<00:03:13.520> I<00:03:13.850> don't<00:03:14.360> know<00:03:14.530> do

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
it's so perfectly placed I don't know do

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:16.720 
it's so perfectly placed I don't know do
you<00:03:15.590> guys<00:03:15.740> think<00:03:15.950> that<00:03:16.130> it's<00:03:16.280> some<00:03:16.430> sort<00:03:16.640> of

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
you guys think that it's some sort of

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.180 
you guys think that it's some sort of
genjutsu<00:03:17.210> or<00:03:17.810> he<00:03:18.380> I<00:03:18.410> mean<00:03:18.709> I<00:03:18.800> know<00:03:18.830> he's<00:03:19.070> being

genjutsu or he I mean I know he's being

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:20.680 
genjutsu or he I mean I know he's being
