actually<00:03:37.049> it<00:03:37.170> is<00:03:37.260> more<00:03:37.440> common<00:03:37.860> in<00:03:37.980> men<00:03:38.160> but

actually it is more common in men but

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.220 
actually it is more common in men but
that<00:03:38.940> might<00:03:39.120> be<00:03:39.150> because<00:03:39.600> men<00:03:39.870> are<00:03:39.900> more

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
that might be because men are more

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.979 
that might be because men are more
