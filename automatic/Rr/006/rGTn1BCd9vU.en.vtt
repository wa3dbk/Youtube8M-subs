you<00:02:08.550> you<00:02:08.700> have<00:02:08.789> to<00:02:09.030> and<00:02:09.390> then<00:02:09.539> you<00:02:11.150> you<00:02:12.150> can't

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
you you have to and then you you can't

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:19.580 
you you have to and then you you can't
hit<00:02:12.690> those<00:02:12.870> guys<00:02:13.110> at<00:02:13.349> all<00:02:14.420> oh<00:02:16.940> damn<00:02:17.959> hello<00:02:18.959> it

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
hit those guys at all oh damn hello it

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.320 
hit those guys at all oh damn hello it
seems<00:02:19.860> like<00:02:20.010> they<00:02:20.160> all<00:02:20.310> produce<00:02:20.520> one<00:02:20.880> for<00:02:21.209> him

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
seems like they all produce one for him

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.330 
seems like they all produce one for him
so<00:02:21.630> it's<00:02:21.900> probably<00:02:22.110> not<00:02:22.260> too<00:02:22.530> bad<00:02:22.830> to<00:02:22.980> use<00:02:23.130> them

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340
