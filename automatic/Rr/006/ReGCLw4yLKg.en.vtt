00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:13.070
 for this craft we are going to need 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:17.030
 colored paper or cardboard 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:19.930
 markers and colored pencils 

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:19.930
 scissors 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:24.090
 in this video I'm going to show you how 

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:26.130
 make some simple little monsters 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.620
 very simple paper to do to play 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.210
 with the children to begin what 

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:33.060
 we will do will fold a rectangle of 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.830
 paper in half trying not to mark 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:38.330
 a lot twice so we do not know 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:38.330
 crumple the figure 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.890
 the second step will be to double the part 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.020
 superior inward which will form 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.970
 the head the bigger the 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.309
 crease will be the size of the 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:52.620
 head of our monster here yes that 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:56.510
 we are going to mark so that the 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.510
 fold between body and head 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.820
 the next thing we're going to do is with 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.540
 the scissors begin to trim the 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.090
 silhouette from bottom to top 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:14.350
 first we would cut what would be the 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.350
 foot or leg 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:31.310
 and then we are going to cut the 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.310
 outline that would form the body 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:41.710
 you can cut the shape that most 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:41.710
 like it or whatever you can think of 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:52.110
 once we reached the top we would end 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:54.400
 with the neck up to the double that separates 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:58.890
 the body of the head 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.890
 we cut here a little that we have left 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:05.249
 and we would have the body 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.760
 now let's cut the head the 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:13.800
 head as it was bent forward 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:16.440
 If it's easier, you can cut it 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:19.350
 turning the paper over to see more 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.040
 comfortably what will be the final form that 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:24.069
 will have 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.349
 we have chosen a kind of 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:29.010
 thunders sideways as you see that 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:29.010
 we are cutting 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:51.330
 this would be the head 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.330
 that we end up with a rounded shape 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:02.550
 here we cut a little more 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:06.330
 we removed and this would be the silhouette of 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:10.470
 our paper monster the head would go 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:13.670
 forward bent by the foot that 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.670
 we had done 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.420
 Now let's start decorating with 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.800
 a felt pen or colored pen 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:26.580
 drawing the little details we want 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:29.040
 have our monster 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:31.170
 we have chosen to use a 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.540
 red ball pen 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:37.970
 with which we have drawn the mouth of the 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.970
 fallopian tubes a single central eye 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:45.620
 You can draw as many details as you can 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:48.069
 happens to you to customize to your 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.069
 monster 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:17.690
 we already have our monster with all 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:19.430
 the details drawn and the following 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.680
 what we are going to do will be with a marker 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:24.770
 the same color or a little darker 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:28.090
 and shading the different details that 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:28.090
 we have drawn 

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:37.550
 filling the ears with the mouth 

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:37.550
 stains 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:59.500
 here we have it, you see that with a 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:02.260
 darker marker we have highlighted the 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:04.360
 details that we wanted to highlight here 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:06.490
 we have the rest of the family here 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:09.550
 You have a shape with horns by 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:13.230
 example and this would be the silhouette with the 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:13.230
 that we have gotten this monster 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:24.250
 here we have another a little bit more 

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:26.800
 I also show you the silhouette 

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:28.930
 with which we have achieved this figure 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:32.940
 of monster depending on the silhouette 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:32.940
 you see that the final form is changing 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:40.800
 Here I show you another made with cardboard 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:43.819
 a little harder in gray and 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.819
 shaded in orange 

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:52.230
 and here we have the little ones in the house 

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:54.690
 one that has marine motifs see another 

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:57.680
 It has two antennas with eyes and another with 

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:57.680
 cat aspect 

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:05.120
 this is the family of little monsters 

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:06.860
 full in crafts point is you have 

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:09.610
 the templates to perform all the 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:09.610
 paper monsters
