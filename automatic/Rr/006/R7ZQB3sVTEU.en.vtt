00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:07.230
 the family will meet them for their graduation 94 is thanks to a piece 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.159
 he was born 18 years ago it's amazing that we're here he finally graduated 

00:00:11.159 --> 00:00:14.159
 today 

00:00:17.909 --> 00:00:20.640
 after that 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.210
 I longed for this moment to start a new stage in my life I saw I could start 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.380
 a race 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.869
 you have a special goal for your life one month 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.869
 rosary with girls and try to have a lot of fun 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.420
 I only have good friends but not only with anyone 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.970
 I enjoy every day to the fullest and I do not think about what will happen tomorrow 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:44.560
 - live online 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.400
 so 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.400
 before I do not care about the future enjoyed 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.520
 five minutes to start the ceremony 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.950
 it was not exciting 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:59.450
 the notes they were excellent 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.940
 despite the illness finished high school among the best in its class 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.190
 and graduated with honors I think they want to be a normal guy 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.360
 I do not think he wants to have this disease because he knows it is serious and that many 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.660
 they die for their cause 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.410
 the expectation 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:20.940
 and although in general many of these guys end up suffering from cancer 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.440
 skin to pensions 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.070
 it is likely that my children were not 30 years was demolished in that is selfish 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.070
 exceed the average 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.050
 entry is 13 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.570
 The positive part is that we value the time that is necessary 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.570
 because we do not know how right he was 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.930
 I'm excited 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.930
 I can not speak 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.830
 also if nothing 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.509
 however the boys run against time 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.210
 I exposed open wounds on the shoulders, hands and feet 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.380
 while the disease will be spread throughout your body 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.910
 the doctor is very worried about the prognosis 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:09.430
 all according to my experience in the service of its largest operating 

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:13.809
 has around 15% lohse 

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:16.279
 It is one of the few means 

00:02:16.279 --> 00:02:17.780
 so far doctor john 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.120
 he had skin grafts until now every month to heal the wounds 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.550
 but recently he gave bad news to her and her family 

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:28.759
 the next operation will be the unt 

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:33.429
 the government's contributions are over and these miraculous grafts will no longer be 

00:02:33.429 --> 00:02:35.679
 there is no other treatment to be
