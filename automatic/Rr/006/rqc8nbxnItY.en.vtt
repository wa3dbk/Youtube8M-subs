now<00:00:02.530> we'll<00:00:02.740> cover<00:00:02.890> seven<00:00:03.430> developmental

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:03.730 
now we'll cover seven developmental

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:07.559 
now we'll cover seven developmental
areas<00:00:04.509> on<00:00:04.629> the<00:00:04.720> forehead<00:00:05.169> all<00:00:06.160> designed<00:00:06.789> to

00:00:07.559 --> 00:00:07.569 
areas on the forehead all designed to

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:09.900 
areas on the forehead all designed to
teach<00:00:07.809> the<00:00:08.050> fundamental<00:00:08.740> aspects<00:00:09.400> of<00:00:09.700> the

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:09.910 
teach the fundamental aspects of the

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:12.900 
teach the fundamental aspects of the
stroke<00:00:10.240> so<00:00:10.990> the<00:00:11.110> first<00:00:11.349> one<00:00:11.620> is<00:00:11.650> balance<00:00:12.190> and

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:12.910 
stroke so the first one is balance and

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:14.369 
stroke so the first one is balance and
what<00:00:13.120> we're<00:00:13.269> looking<00:00:13.570> for<00:00:13.780> the<00:00:13.839> children<00:00:14.259> to

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:14.379 
what we're looking for the children to

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:18.090 
what we're looking for the children to
do<00:00:14.589> is<00:00:15.280> whether<00:00:15.639> its<00:00:15.879> square<00:00:16.480> stance<00:00:16.900> or<00:00:17.470> semi

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:18.100 
do is whether its square stance or semi

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.070 
do is whether its square stance or semi
open<00:00:18.430> mr.<00:00:18.939> essentially<00:00:19.510> coming<00:00:19.720> down<00:00:19.930> the

open mr. essentially coming down the
court<00:00:20.380> hold<00:00:21.250> their<00:00:21.550> balance<00:00:21.939> until<00:00:22.570> the<00:00:22.660> ball

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:22.840 
court hold their balance until the ball

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.109 
court hold their balance until the ball
hits<00:00:23.050> the<00:00:23.140> back<00:00:23.349> fence<00:00:23.699> what<00:00:24.699> we're<00:00:24.849> looking

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:25.119 
hits the back fence what we're looking

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:27.179 
hits the back fence what we're looking
for<00:00:25.150> is<00:00:25.570> that<00:00:25.599> the<00:00:25.900> weight<00:00:26.140> is<00:00:26.740> not<00:00:26.920> on<00:00:27.070> the

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:27.189 
for is that the weight is not on the

heel and not on the outside of the foot
put<00:00:29.769> on<00:00:29.859> the<00:00:29.949> ball<00:00:30.130> of<00:00:30.310> the<00:00:30.429> foot<00:00:30.640> the<00:00:31.119> heel<00:00:31.300> can

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:31.570 
put on the ball of the foot the heel can

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:32.880 
put on the ball of the foot the heel can
be<00:00:31.660> raised<00:00:31.929> off<00:00:32.200> the<00:00:32.230> ground<00:00:32.529> a<00:00:32.649> little<00:00:32.739> bit

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:32.890 
be raised off the ground a little bit

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.580 
be raised off the ground a little bit
that's<00:00:33.129> fine<00:00:33.270> but<00:00:34.270> check<00:00:34.780> whether<00:00:35.050> where<00:00:35.469> the

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:35.590 
that's fine but check whether where the

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:37.500 
that's fine but check whether where the
weight<00:00:35.860> is<00:00:35.890> on<00:00:36.190> that<00:00:36.340> foot<00:00:36.579> and<00:00:36.730> also<00:00:37.270> check

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:37.510 
weight is on that foot and also check

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:39.799 
weight is on that foot and also check
that<00:00:37.540> we<00:00:37.780> maintain<00:00:38.230> our<00:00:38.379> angles<00:00:38.920> in<00:00:39.039> our<00:00:39.160> me

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
that we maintain our angles in our me

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.170 
that we maintain our angles in our me
we're<00:00:40.809> moving<00:00:41.140> to<00:00:41.260> the<00:00:41.350> ball<00:00:41.559> where<00:00:42.460> we<00:00:43.000> want

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:43.180 
we're moving to the ball where we want

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:44.340 
we're moving to the ball where we want
to<00:00:43.239> come<00:00:43.360> heel<00:00:43.690> toe

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:44.350 
to come heel toe

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.270 
to come heel toe
versus<00:00:45.010> toe<00:00:45.550> first<00:00:45.940> before<00:00:46.800> closing<00:00:47.800> this<00:00:48.100> off

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:48.280 
versus toe first before closing this off

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.520 
versus toe first before closing this off
too<00:00:48.520> much<00:00:48.640> as<00:00:48.879> AB<00:00:49.000> is<00:00:49.149> a<00:00:49.180> bracing<00:00:49.690> move<00:00:49.899> so

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:50.530 
too much as AB is a bracing move so

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:51.750 
too much as AB is a bracing move so
we're<00:00:50.649> looking<00:00:50.860> to<00:00:50.980> come<00:00:51.160> out<00:00:51.399> to<00:00:51.609> the<00:00:51.730> outside

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:51.760 
we're looking to come out to the outside

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.270 
we're looking to come out to the outside
leg<00:00:52.359> we're<00:00:53.020> looking<00:00:53.260> to<00:00:53.350> come<00:00:53.530> down<00:00:53.829> with<00:00:54.129> up

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:54.280 
leg we're looking to come down with up

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.080 
leg we're looking to come down with up
into<00:00:54.550> balance<00:00:55.000> and<00:00:56.100> with<00:00:57.100> that<00:00:57.250> balance<00:00:57.489> we

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.090 
into balance and with that balance we

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.020 
into balance and with that balance we
need<00:00:58.239> a<00:00:58.269> little<00:00:58.449> pivot<00:00:59.609> with<00:01:00.609> the<00:01:00.699> angles

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 
need a little pivot with the angles

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.209 
need a little pivot with the angles
maintained<00:01:01.510> same<00:01:02.140> with<00:01:02.320> a<00:01:02.379> semi<00:01:02.620> open<00:01:02.949> stance

00:01:03.209 --> 00:01:03.219 
maintained same with a semi open stance

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:05.940 
maintained same with a semi open stance
here<00:01:03.609> give<00:01:04.180> it<00:01:04.330> just<00:01:04.510> like<00:01:05.110> this<00:01:05.290> maintain<00:01:05.800> our

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:05.950 
here give it just like this maintain our

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.820 
here give it just like this maintain our
angles<00:01:06.340> we<00:01:06.970> want<00:01:07.150> to<00:01:07.210> bring<00:01:07.420> out<00:01:07.540> as<00:01:07.960> we<00:01:08.260> hit<00:01:08.500> we

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:08.830 
angles we want to bring out as we hit we

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:10.620 
angles we want to bring out as we hit we
want<00:01:09.010> to<00:01:09.070> bring<00:01:09.250> our<00:01:09.370> leg<00:01:09.610> up<00:01:09.880> and<00:01:10.300> there's<00:01:10.480> the

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.630 
want to bring our leg up and there's the

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.410 
want to bring our leg up and there's the
back<00:01:10.780> leg<00:01:11.080> or<00:01:11.620> the<00:01:11.770> inside<00:01:12.250> leg<00:01:12.520> so<00:01:13.060> the<00:01:13.180> first

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 
back leg or the inside leg so the first

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.950 
back leg or the inside leg so the first
progression<00:01:13.870> is<00:01:14.650> to<00:01:15.160> is<00:01:15.700> to<00:01:15.910> hit<00:01:16.120> and<00:01:16.600> to<00:01:16.750> pivot

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
progression is to is to hit and to pivot

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:17.880 
progression is to is to hit and to pivot
with<00:01:17.200> the<00:01:17.290> ball

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:17.890 
with the ball

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.120 
with the ball
we'll<00:01:18.160> go<00:01:18.310> square<00:01:18.670> stance<00:01:19.290> and<00:01:20.290> designed

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
we'll go square stance and designed

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.760 
we'll go square stance and designed
designed<00:01:21.910> to<00:01:22.480> basically<00:01:22.900> hold<00:01:23.140> our<00:01:23.380> balance

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
designed to basically hold our balance

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.220 
designed to basically hold our balance
until<00:01:24.550> the<00:01:24.640> ball<00:01:24.820> hits<00:01:25.030> the<00:01:25.090> fence<00:01:25.360> maintain

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:26.230 
until the ball hits the fence maintain

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:28.560 
until the ball hits the fence maintain
their<00:01:26.410> angles<00:01:26.800> maintain<00:01:27.670> our<00:01:27.820> swing<00:01:28.120> right

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 
their angles maintain our swing right

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:35.370 
their angles maintain our swing right
here<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.970> balance<00:01:34.120> I've<00:01:34.480> lost<00:01:34.720> my<00:01:34.930> balance<00:01:35.110> on

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
here the balance I've lost my balance on

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.410 
here the balance I've lost my balance on
that<00:01:35.440> one<00:01:35.740> so<00:01:36.640> I'll<00:01:36.700> show<00:01:36.850> you<00:01:36.940> another<00:01:37.060> good

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
that one so I'll show you another good

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.520 
that one so I'll show you another good
example<00:01:38.760> down<00:01:39.760> the<00:01:39.910> court<00:01:40.180> balance<00:01:41.020> hold<00:01:41.320> it

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
example down the court balance hold it

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.340 
example down the court balance hold it
and<00:01:42.340> we're<00:01:42.490> in<00:01:42.580> good<00:01:42.730> shape<00:01:42.970> I<00:01:43.300> can<00:01:44.170> do<00:01:44.260> the

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
and we're in good shape I can do the

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.710 
and we're in good shape I can do the
same<00:01:44.560> on<00:01:44.710> the<00:01:44.770> outside<00:01:44.830> leg<00:01:45.400> semi<00:01:46.330> open<00:01:46.800> yeah

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
same on the outside leg semi open yeah

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.800 
same on the outside leg semi open yeah
semi<00:01:49.720> open<00:01:50.080> is<00:01:50.410> where<00:01:50.740> this<00:01:50.920> foot<00:01:51.190> points<00:01:51.810> what

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
semi open is where this foot points what

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.090 
semi open is where this foot points what
we're<00:01:52.990> trying<00:01:53.200> what<00:01:53.500> we<00:01:53.620> want<00:01:53.800> the<00:01:53.890> children

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
we're trying what we want the children

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.620 
we're trying what we want the children
to<00:01:54.250> do<00:01:54.430> is<00:01:54.520> to<00:01:54.670> spin<00:01:54.880> about<00:01:55.120> as<00:01:55.270> much<00:01:55.420> as

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
to do is to spin about as much as

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.830 
to do is to spin about as much as
possible<00:01:56.010> with<00:01:57.150> the<00:01:58.150> foot<00:01:58.360> pointing<00:01:58.690> this<00:01:58.780> way

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
possible with the foot pointing this way

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.980 
possible with the foot pointing this way
a<00:01:59.290> little<00:01:59.590> there<00:02:00.160> is<00:02:00.190> fine<00:02:00.760> we<00:02:01.540> just<00:02:01.750> want<00:02:01.930> to

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
a little there is fine we just want to

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.250 
a little there is fine we just want to
avoid<00:02:02.290> stepping<00:02:02.770> out<00:02:03.010> with<00:02:03.040> our<00:02:03.310> foot<00:02:03.520> forward

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:04.260 
avoid stepping out with our foot forward

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.560 
avoid stepping out with our foot forward
yeah<00:02:05.350> the<00:02:05.560> spacing<00:02:06.220> when<00:02:06.640> and<00:02:06.910> where<00:02:07.180> we<00:02:07.360> put

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
yeah the spacing when and where we put

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.529 
yeah the spacing when and where we put
this<00:02:07.690> foot<00:02:08.020> determines<00:02:08.890> where<00:02:09.369> I

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
this foot determines where I

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.809 
this foot determines where I
points<00:02:11.170> if<00:02:11.560> I'm<00:02:11.739> not<00:02:11.950> anywhere<00:02:12.310> near<00:02:12.370> the<00:02:12.579> ball

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
points if I'm not anywhere near the ball

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:14.849 
points if I'm not anywhere near the ball
then<00:02:13.390> I'm<00:02:13.480> gonna<00:02:13.599> it's<00:02:14.230> going<00:02:14.379> to<00:02:14.439> point<00:02:14.680> more

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:14.859 
then I'm gonna it's going to point more

00:02:14.859 --> 00:02:17.369 
then I'm gonna it's going to point more
this<00:02:15.040> way<00:02:15.280> the<00:02:15.579> more<00:02:15.790> I<00:02:15.819> can<00:02:16.150> step<00:02:16.810> out<00:02:17.049> this

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:17.379 
this way the more I can step out this

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:19.380 
this way the more I can step out this
way<00:02:17.620> and<00:02:17.920> step<00:02:18.129> back<00:02:18.370> for<00:02:18.790> a<00:02:18.849> s'more<00:02:19.239> of<00:02:19.329> a

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
way and step back for a s'more of a

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.949 
way and step back for a s'more of a
semi-open<00:02:19.719> stance

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
semi-open stance

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:33.149 
semi-open stance
yeah<00:02:30.150> just<00:02:31.150> like<00:02:31.299> that<00:02:31.680> but<00:02:32.680> you'll<00:02:32.920> see<00:02:33.069> a<00:02:33.099> lot

00:02:33.149 --> 00:02:33.159 
yeah just like that but you'll see a lot

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:36.390 
yeah just like that but you'll see a lot
of<00:02:33.310> children<00:02:33.700> do<00:02:33.849> is<00:02:34.000> this<00:02:34.239> come<00:02:35.230> here<00:02:35.560> and

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
of children do is this come here and

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.550 
of children do is this come here and
they'll<00:02:36.549> do<00:02:36.670> that<00:02:36.989> they'll<00:02:37.989> fall<00:02:38.230> off<00:02:38.379> the

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
they'll do that they'll fall off the

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.890 
they'll do that they'll fall off the
ball<00:02:38.739> too<00:02:39.010> quickly<00:02:39.280> we<00:02:40.030> want<00:02:40.150> to<00:02:40.269> work<00:02:40.599> that

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
ball too quickly we want to work that

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.690 
ball too quickly we want to work that
pivot<00:02:42.329> do<00:02:43.329> that<00:02:44.220> the<00:02:45.220> more<00:02:45.430> advanced

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
pivot do that the more advanced

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.309 
pivot do that the more advanced
progression<00:02:46.329> I'll<00:02:46.629> do<00:02:46.780> it<00:02:46.840> off<00:02:46.930> the<00:02:46.959> square

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:47.319 
progression I'll do it off the square

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:49.589 
progression I'll do it off the square
stance<00:02:47.650> is<00:02:47.829> to<00:02:47.950> add<00:02:48.069> a<00:02:48.099> hop<00:02:48.370> now<00:02:48.639> turn<00:02:49.419> to

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:49.599 
stance is to add a hop now turn to

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:53.339 
stance is to add a hop now turn to
balance<00:02:50.790> it's<00:02:51.790> a<00:02:51.939> pivot<00:02:52.299> and<00:02:52.480> it's<00:02:52.689> a<00:02:52.840> hop

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:53.349 
balance it's a pivot and it's a hop

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:55.770 
balance it's a pivot and it's a hop
I've<00:02:53.769> lost<00:02:54.040> my<00:02:54.250> balance<00:02:54.459> there<00:02:54.879> but<00:02:55.569> it's<00:02:55.689> a

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
I've lost my balance there but it's a

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.240 
I've lost my balance there but it's a
little<00:02:55.989> bit<00:02:56.200> more<00:02:56.349> advanced<00:02:56.829> in<00:02:56.950> that<00:02:57.099> we're

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
little bit more advanced in that we're

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.089 
little bit more advanced in that we're
giving<00:02:57.760> it<00:02:57.879> and<00:02:58.000> we're<00:02:58.840> hopping<00:02:59.230> putting<00:02:59.919> all

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:00.099 
giving it and we're hopping putting all

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:04.129 
giving it and we're hopping putting all
of<00:03:00.129> our<00:03:00.340> body<00:03:00.579> weight<00:03:00.760> through<00:03:00.970> that<00:03:01.209> ball

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:04.139 

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:07.259 

that's<00:03:05.139> what<00:03:05.349> we're<00:03:05.500> looking<00:03:05.709> to<00:03:05.829> do<00:03:05.980> now<00:03:06.459> if

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269 
that's what we're looking to do now if

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:09.270 
that's what we're looking to do now if
we<00:03:07.450> do<00:03:07.569> outside<00:03:07.810> there<00:03:08.290> it's<00:03:08.650> the<00:03:08.739> same<00:03:08.980> thing

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
we do outside there it's the same thing

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.530 
we do outside there it's the same thing
we<00:03:09.909> want<00:03:10.120> to<00:03:10.180> pivot<00:03:10.950> up<00:03:11.950> beyond<00:03:12.489> the<00:03:12.609> ball<00:03:12.819> and

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
we want to pivot up beyond the ball and

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.170 
we want to pivot up beyond the ball and
work<00:03:13.720> my<00:03:13.959> balance<00:03:14.319> so<00:03:15.280> if<00:03:15.609> you're<00:03:15.790> working<00:03:15.970> on

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
work my balance so if you're working on

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:17.789 
work my balance so if you're working on
a<00:03:16.239> soft<00:03:16.540> surface<00:03:16.720> like<00:03:17.049> clay<00:03:17.290> you<00:03:17.470> can<00:03:17.620> see

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799 
a soft surface like clay you can see

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:19.530 
a soft surface like clay you can see
where<00:03:18.010> they<00:03:18.159> started<00:03:18.639> and<00:03:18.849> where<00:03:19.419> they

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
where they started and where they

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.119 
where they started and where they
finished<00:03:19.930> it<00:03:20.079> wants<00:03:20.260> to<00:03:20.349> be<00:03:20.470> beyond<00:03:20.859> and<00:03:21.069> it

00:03:21.119 --> 00:03:21.129 
finished it wants to be beyond and it

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:24.149 
finished it wants to be beyond and it
wants<00:03:21.310> to<00:03:21.430> be<00:03:21.579> more<00:03:22.239> forward<00:03:22.690> in<00:03:22.750> the<00:03:22.870> court<00:03:23.229> so

00:03:24.149 --> 00:03:24.159 
wants to be more forward in the court so

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:27.030 
wants to be more forward in the court so
that's<00:03:24.340> the<00:03:24.489> first<00:03:25.049> developmental<00:03:26.049> area<00:03:26.440> it

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
that's the first developmental area it

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.360 
that's the first developmental area it
may<00:03:27.280> take<00:03:27.629> whips<00:03:28.629> it<00:03:29.049> may<00:03:29.290> take<00:03:29.560> months<00:03:29.799> for

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
may take whips it may take months for

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.189 
may take whips it may take months for
the<00:03:30.459> children<00:03:30.909> to<00:03:31.389> be<00:03:31.540> able<00:03:31.569> to<00:03:31.870> learn<00:03:31.989> to

the children to be able to learn to

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:34.589 
the children to be able to learn to
control<00:03:32.379> their<00:03:32.799> body<00:03:33.010> their<00:03:33.549> posture<00:03:34.209> and
