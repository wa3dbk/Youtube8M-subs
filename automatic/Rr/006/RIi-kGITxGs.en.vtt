00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.200
 the rarest dinosaur in the world in 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:11.450
 china has been discovered one of the 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.119
 strangest dinosaurs discovered 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:16.750
 so far I had the long neck 

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:20.150
 incredibly huge arms 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:22.249
 probably with giant talons measured 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:25.070
 about six and a half meters from the head to 

00:00:22.249 --> 00:00:27.710
 the tail is believed to walk alone with 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:30.919
 his hind legs and that he had the walking 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:34.040
 of a pact the weirdest dinosaur 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:36.890
 discovered until now news but to 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.600
 despite being huge and monstrous and 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.899
 they were two legs like the dinosaurs 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:44.629
 carnivorous theropods of which 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:46.150
 evolved in its users megaterio and of 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:48.730
 be up 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:51.210
 was discovered by dark english in the 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:54.460
 Gansu province in northwest China 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:57.550
 his name means giant resembling 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.500
 a lazy reptile from his show this 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.960
 dinosaur belongs to a group called 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:05.050
 alter and silt saurians that is part of 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.270
 the theropods the theropods are in their 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:10.270
 most carnivores the exception 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:12.790
 just this group the term 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.600
 Saurians were long-necked hands 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:19.440
 small and very large arms with desire 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.810
 They had very broad ribs and hips 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.970
 his show sauros is unique to be the most 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.780
 former member of this group with 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:30.410
 such large members said read before only 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.810
 they knew ter and dinosaurs of 90 ago 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:36.480
 66 million years near the end of the 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.760
 it was from the dinosaurs but this fossil 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.409
 of his tasty psuv he has about 115 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.079
 millions of years 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.240
 At first it was believed that tennis 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.880
 Saurians were relatives of the turtles 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:51.060
 giants and then it was believed that they were some 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.789
 weird type of theropods after they 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.319
 related to the sauropods and even 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:58.079
 There are those who say they are, nor do you 

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:59.969
 I can not sauropods but a sub order 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.520
 special that would have its origin in the 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:04.829
 Triassic when the dinosaurs 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:07.799
 they appeared on earth but already in 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:10.080
 the 90 paleontologists agreed that 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:12.030
 tennis and not saurians are very theropods 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.110
 modified which became 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.700
 vegetarians had small teeth 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.549
 they make up the anh, like others 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.349
 dinosaurs like plants are not 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:24.569
 they left sharp teeth as in the 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:26.020
 carnivores and in most of the 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:29.080
 theropods 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:31.420
 despite being herbivores the felines 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.340
 Auryn retained the upper limbs 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.520
 with three typical theropod claws 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.770
 Carnivores think might if any 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:41.470
 used to bring branches to their mouths like 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:43.750
 they used to do the lazy giants and 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.200
 also as a defense against dinosaurs 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.870
 carnivores 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.239
 and these dinosaurs do not just want 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.280
 be the strangest but the 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:54.680
 saurios telecino is believed to be very 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:59.080
 related to the birds that is believed 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.080
 they would be descendants of the dinosaurs
