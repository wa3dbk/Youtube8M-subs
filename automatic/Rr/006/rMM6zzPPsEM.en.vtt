00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:09.980
 greetings to all friends of 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:12.469
 androidworld.it would have recognized them 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:15.710
 we are ahead of the top of the range of 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:18.830
 moment or the capisci one m8 samsung 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:21.050
 galaxy s 5 sony xperia z2 and the 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:23.480
 brand new and still not available 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:26.869
 buying lgg 3 because it really 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.099
 the last presented then also last 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:30.469
 in a row 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:34.750
 I'll show them to you quickly too 

00:00:30.469 --> 00:00:34.750
 from the constructive point of view 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:41.690
 ok this I wanted a moment because I put 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:44.660
 inside that gold just to make you 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:48.489
 see more or less brushed metal 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:50.629
 then in order here we have an htc one 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:52.609
 which has a somewhat particular shape e 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:56.449
 different from the others because it is narrower 

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:58.190
 and long and made of metal and the 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:00.739
 non- removable battery memory 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:03.440
 expandable here we have s5 or instead 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:06.620
 know that all with this cover in 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.909
 I don't like plastic plaster effect 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:10.390
 much to use stereo 0 but here 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:12.590
 it is really hard not to do it 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.870
 resists water to memory is 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:18.800
 expandable and removable battery 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:21.650
 we then have xp that z2 with body in 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.280
 non-removable battery glass and memory 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.110
 expandable 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.630
 finally and expandable memory also for 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:29.660
 g3 so all are aligned on this 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:32.300
 removable battery point for g3 e 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:35.240
 body in what is a former destination 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:37.610
 china or earth and plastic but 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:41.060
 it looks as much metal as it looks 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:43.850
 metal the metal of htc one m le 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.880
 dimensions are different are 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.770
 different because htc can 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.270
 not even 8 as we know is very long at 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.970
 two front speakers that make it 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:55.830
 very very long as compactness 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:58.320
 economy probably at the expense of 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:01.440
 but still wins because s5 more 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.780
 compact and being made of soft plastic 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.390
 surely stands much better in 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.880
 but obviously the screens are obviously 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.070
 very different we have 15 inches a 5 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.520
 inches and 15 inches and two in 5 inches 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.840
 and 5 so you understand very well that 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.330
 optimization regarding the 5 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:22.050
 inches and 5 of this g3 are really 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:24.750
 remarkable because it is little more than a 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:27.630
 s5 is just more laredo than lance two 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:30.000
 but it is lower as it also appears to be 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:33.900
 high more or less like an m8 now there 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.850
 I put side by side so I would say that 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.720
 they are the same high then we have all the 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:42.930
 we will not cede this data calmly 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:45.750
 I bring in the clear version that it is 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:49.200
 the one where we have everything and I go to 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:52.200
 turn everyone as if they were cards 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:55.230
 other differences then these three have 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:58.380
 two will be three full hd screens then 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:02.700
 1920 x 1080 this a quad hd screen 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:06.660
 then 2560 x 1440 camera and here 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:09.570
 we have 14 megapixel duo so with one 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.640
 second camera you saw it for the 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:14.730
 depth a camera from 16 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.590
 megapixel 20.7 camera 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.180
 megapixels and a 13 megapixel camera 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:25.560
 with optical image stabilizer 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:27.900
 or ex plus e and autofocus laser cameras 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:31.230
 frontal is also good to list these 5 2 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:33.000
 2.2 and 2 globe 1 megapixel processors 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.470
 processors then we have two snapdragon 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.080
 801 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:43.220
 ab should be 2.3 gigahertz 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:46.370
 here we have instead the 25 gb 2 gb acs 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:48.049
 of ram 2gb of ram 3gb of ram and here two o 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.180
 three to choose of the model that you will go 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:52.900
 always buy in order always 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:58.750
 talking about boring battery data 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:04:01.790
 2600 2800 3300 thousand 200 milian per hour 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:06.470
 all technology is 150 megabits per 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:09.640
 second two-band wifi bluetooth 4.0 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:11.000
 therefore technologies however enough 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.160
 sorted 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.690
 let's turn them on then there or 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:22.190
 set all with brightness to 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:26.660
 maximum ok 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:31.210
 here are the three browsers with smartphones 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:33.440
 loaded and the verge already loaded then 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:35.570
 despite the white balance 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:39.320
 the camcorder the colors appear a 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:40.910
 a little more accentuated towards theirs 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.880
 worst sense really on all 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:45.800
 smartphones, however, do quite well 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.960
 the idea 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:51.530
 in all honesty I have to say that the screen 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:54.380
 dm 8 and the g3 screen are the ones that 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:57.860
 they probably have the best whites 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:59.030
 maybe a little bit brighter than the screen 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:01.070
 dm 8 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:02.780
 there is not the marked difference that yes 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:04.460
 sees instead in the video camera 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:05.750
 there is a minimal thing we try to 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:09.889
 incriminate them for maybe even 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:11.449
 the inclination I changed page too 

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:14.599
 the interaction really does a little bit 

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:17.150
 already notice how similar they are 

00:05:14.599 --> 00:05:18.820
 the g3 is now connected in hedge e 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:21.520
 therefore the fact of having changed page 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:27.110
 wait for it to top up ok 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:30.800
 here they are also incline these and 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:34.750
 the samsung of very bright colors in the 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:37.100
 sense of a very high contrast tends 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:39.020
 slightly perhaps the blue but really 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:40.700
 slightly while tending to a 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:43.340
 a little more reddish and this is true 

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:46.940
 he sees a little bit more clearly also 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:52.010
 live the z 2 the screen was 

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:54.770
 two tends a little more to the red vi 

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:57.230
 I'll show you a moment 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:06:00.200
 I go out a moment to show the four 

00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:01.730
 systems in a very very simple way 

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:05.570
 because then this is a text that 

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:08.150
 would require a very long trial 

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:12.650
 here we obviously have the sense of htc 

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:15.530
 with here to the side sees the blink feed 

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:19.130
 here we have and the applications I make you 

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:20.540
 see flowing in the horizontal 

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:23.720
 famous the lower of htc 

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:24.950
 samsung's touchwiz interface is 

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:27.980
 quite similar to itself but 

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:31.280
 renewed a bit like the idea of ddl g 

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:33.740
 so here the applications are here and there 

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:36.470
 next to the ever magazine is the magazine 

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:37.790
 staff as it was renamed I do 

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:40.760
 see also the notification bar 

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:44.260
 here we have a separate page here 

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:47.290
 we have all the usual applications 

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:49.420
 all in vertical with this menu for 

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:51.690
 handle it 

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:54.460
 here is the only one that is not present a 

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:56.500
 let's say a software for content 

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:58.360
 all together there is an application 

00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:01.240
 but not integrated into the home screen 

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:05.380
 this is the notification bar finally 

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:07.720
 this is the new launch of lg also here 

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:09.820
 vertically redesigned applications 

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:13.030
 notification bar here they are with 

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:17.530
 these are new in a circle and on the left 

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:19.420
 we have smart ips and lg is definitely a 

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:23.470
 pretty rough test but why 

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:27.310
 after all it's just a first try that 

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:30.250
 fra htc one m8 samsung galaxy s 5 sony 

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:31.990
 xperia z2 and lg trips 

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:35.460
 a greeting to all but it is not cisotti 

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:35.460
