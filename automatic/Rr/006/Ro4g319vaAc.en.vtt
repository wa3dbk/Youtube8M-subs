00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:30.610
 So friends I'm gonna say yes I do it 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:34.630
 will be nice and slow autumn of winter 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:37.350
 move slowly into the country, there is also 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:39.390
 bushkow that is in limestone 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.220
 I have a little thing 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:45.850
 present 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:48.940
 you have our ranger I believe you 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:57.600
 ever briefly mentioned i have that 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:01:02.680
 also are puffing bags a 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:08.440
 So he works with coal 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:15.009
 Chopsticks that you light you catch 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:18.630
 then to give or klose and if 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:25.090
 these are beginning to glose here 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:27.000
 glass fiber mats makes this one to me 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:31.180
 let's say safety again 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.540
 a rubber ring over it and put it 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:36.250
 then in the bags 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:42.310
 and one thing I can tell you will be 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:44.770
 so hot a rod holds in about four 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:48.939
 if you take it from one to five hours 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:50.500
 lit side now I have but before 

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:52.020
 a few years i am having a trick 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:56.049
 caught on 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:58.740
 I already have one here 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:58.740
 broken 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:09.140
 so that you go here and break it 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:13.660
 and all four sides light that the 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:17.360
 climate that brings even more heat 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:20.810
 So I can assure you with the 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:24.500
 two in the bag you can at minus 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:26.690
 20 degrees outside and I will be the 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:30.230
 pull out the phone to cool it 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:35.480
 that's how they were gonna be 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:36.820
 I'm buying more his costs five 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:46.040
 Euro 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:48.370
 I also got the same reserve 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.370
 With 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:55.890
 they are packed as a stadium but 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:03:01.420
 they'll break me right away where I get them 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:03.120
 already protected and thus you get warm 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.650
 through the winter 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.980
 There is also the second possibility 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:12.160
 which I have only been for a few years 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:17.230
 have these are the so-called bags 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:23.620
 Stoves that look like a big one 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:24.550
 zippo same function because you need here 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.300
 a gasoline 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:31.930
 You can see here filling one 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:35.530
 Gasoline 1 provided any gasoline from 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:40.720
 2001 or alcohol and put on this 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:43.930
 just stocking kemper tables 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:46.840
 The parents house would be such kitchen 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.520
 flows out of the camper for yet to know 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.040
 Time 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:53.860
 it's something similar i ask at the kloot 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:56.550
 touch storm but just here 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:59.380
 pull off again 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:02.620
 by vehicle five to ten seconds 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:03.959
 went to heat and then the wire starts 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:09.930
 to glow 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:14.230
 when the glow put on insert 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:18.150
 and guarantees up to 16 hours 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:20.380
 heat when they are full 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.840
 Of course you can also do it before 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:25.800
 make up 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:29.140
 but you should have inventory here 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:33.240
 and a knife one touches is you 

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:36.400
 Says it will be hot just here, of course 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:38.880
 do not let the part cool with the 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:41.880
 attacking the fingers gets damn hot 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:44.980
 and so it's off again 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:48.150
 is completely cold, you can do it without 

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:48.150
 put on rider and 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:59.140
 I have this as a gift 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:02.420
 get it 

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:04.820
 lutz is open from allgÃ¤uer pockets 

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:07.550
 I'm sure you will still be there 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:10.930
 to buy there and they are also in 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:13.610
 a price of about 10 euros 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:15.620
 maybe 12 13 now 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:20.000
 I can not say I do not have it 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:22.160
 looked up but true cases maybe 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.710
 also for the ladies the often cold in the 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.610
 winter or so you do not have to 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:29.150
 Embassies 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:31.130
 you might go by bus 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:31.990
 work is at the bus stop or 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:35.260
 anything else 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:39.110
 You can always use them 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:42.320

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:47.240
