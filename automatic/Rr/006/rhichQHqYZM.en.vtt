00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
okay this is teaching you how to teach

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.629 
okay this is teaching you how to teach
your<00:00:07.259> cat<00:00:07.799> Jilla<00:00:08.790> T<00:00:09.860> and<00:00:10.860> what<00:00:11.340> we<00:00:11.519> are

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
your cat Jilla T and what we are

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.839 
your cat Jilla T and what we are
starting<00:00:12.000> with<00:00:12.030> today<00:00:12.799> is<00:00:13.799> target<00:00:14.490> training

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
starting with today is target training

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.290 
starting with today is target training
because<00:00:16.070> and<00:00:17.070> for<00:00:17.400> target<00:00:17.789> training<00:00:18.090> you<00:00:18.180> need

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
because and for target training you need

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.840 
because and for target training you need
clicker<00:00:18.630> training<00:00:18.900> and<00:00:19.320> I'm<00:00:20.310> not<00:00:20.670> going<00:00:20.789> to

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
clicker training and I'm not going to

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.429 
clicker training and I'm not going to
show<00:00:20.970> you<00:00:21.060> that<00:00:21.210> because<00:00:21.510> it's<00:00:21.840> pretty<00:00:21.990> easy

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
show you that because it's pretty easy

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.689 
show you that because it's pretty easy
so<00:00:22.920> you<00:00:22.949> can<00:00:23.189> look<00:00:23.340> it<00:00:23.460> up<00:00:23.519> somewhere<00:00:23.850> else

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:25.699 
so you can look it up somewhere else

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:27.890 
so you can look it up somewhere else
target<00:00:26.699> training<00:00:26.939> is<00:00:27.150> useful<00:00:27.539> for<00:00:27.689> pretty

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
target training is useful for pretty

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.470 
target training is useful for pretty
much<00:00:27.990> everything<00:00:28.560> in<00:00:28.949> agility<00:00:29.519> so<00:00:30.210> that's

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
much everything in agility so that's

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.510 
much everything in agility so that's
where<00:00:30.689> we<00:00:30.929> start

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:31.520 
where we start

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.670 
where we start
so<00:00:32.960> first<00:00:33.960> you<00:00:34.170> need<00:00:34.200> to<00:00:34.350> find<00:00:34.940> something

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:36.680 
so first you need to find something

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.209 
so first you need to find something
unique<00:00:37.680> and<00:00:39.559> differently<00:00:40.559> colored<00:00:40.920> than

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
unique and differently colored than

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.100 
unique and differently colored than
everything<00:00:41.370> else<00:00:41.579> so<00:00:42.059> I<00:00:42.090> have<00:00:42.420> this<00:00:42.540> plate<00:00:42.930> on

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
everything else so I have this plate on

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.100 
everything else so I have this plate on
it<00:00:43.260> that's<00:00:43.500> very<00:00:45.829> bright<00:00:46.829> green<00:00:47.190> color<00:00:47.700> and

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.110 
it that's very bright green color and

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.200 
it that's very bright green color and
there's<00:00:49.110> stick<00:00:49.440> as<00:00:49.590> well<00:00:49.670> it's<00:00:50.670> nice<00:00:50.910> to<00:00:50.940> have

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
there's stick as well it's nice to have

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.750 
there's stick as well it's nice to have
a<00:00:51.239> stick<00:00:51.570> as<00:00:51.750> well<00:00:51.780> as<00:00:52.199> a<00:00:52.649> ground<00:00:53.100> target<00:00:53.340> and

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
a stick as well as a ground target and

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.110 
a stick as well as a ground target and
so<00:00:54.420> they're<00:00:54.570> about<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.110> same<00:00:55.289> color<00:00:55.590> I<00:00:56.120> also

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
so they're about the same color I also

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.119 
so they're about the same color I also
use<00:00:57.420> this<00:00:57.600> darker<00:00:58.020> one<00:00:58.170> sometimes<00:00:58.559> and<00:00:58.920> it's

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
use this darker one sometimes and it's

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.170 
use this darker one sometimes and it's
the<00:00:59.190> same<00:00:59.399> to<00:00:59.699> herself<00:01:01.489> I'm<00:01:02.489> going<00:01:02.969> to<00:01:03.030> show

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
the same to herself I'm going to show

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:15.750 
the same to herself I'm going to show
you<00:01:03.239> how<00:01:03.809> you<00:01:03.870> teach<00:01:04.140> it<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.409> them<00:01:04.530> so<00:01:05.540> first

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:15.760 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.390 

can<00:01:16.480> you<00:01:16.630> treat<00:01:17.020> something<00:01:17.680> positive

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:18.400 
can you treat something positive

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.840 
can you treat something positive
reinforcement<00:01:19.030> I<00:01:19.300> have<00:01:20.050> this<00:01:20.200> stuff<00:01:20.500> that's

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
reinforcement I have this stuff that's

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.430 
reinforcement I have this stuff that's
made<00:01:21.850> in<00:01:22.030> the<00:01:22.060> USA<00:01:22.660> so<00:01:22.690> if<00:01:23.050> you're<00:01:23.200> American

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:23.440 
made in the USA so if you're American

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.230 
made in the USA so if you're American

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:27.710 

Catherine<00:02:22.830> target<00:02:23.820> yes<00:02:25.430> so<00:02:26.430> it<00:02:26.760> it<00:02:27.240> takes<00:02:27.450> time

Catherine target yes so it it takes time

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.990 
Catherine target yes so it it takes time

it with agility as long as she just
stops<00:03:01.700> mine<00:03:02.000> that's<00:03:02.360> fine

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:05.270 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:07.990 

take<00:03:06.230> it

take it

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.440 
take it
like<00:03:08.420> it
