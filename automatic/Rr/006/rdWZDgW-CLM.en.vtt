00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.790 
combo and then we'll combine the two for
another<00:01:40.060> minute<00:01:40.630> so<00:01:41.020> you<00:01:41.050> get<00:01:41.320> about<00:01:41.500> three

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:41.800 
another minute so you get about three

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.710 
another minute so you get about three
minutes<00:01:42.220> worth<00:01:42.610> you<00:01:42.970> know<00:01:43.060> back<00:01:43.240> the<00:01:43.360> back<00:01:43.540> and

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 
minutes worth you know back the back and

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.240 
minutes worth you know back the back and
give<00:01:43.840> him<00:01:43.930> 60<00:01:44.200> seconds<00:01:44.560> to<00:01:44.590> rest<00:01:44.860> and<00:01:45.010> we'll<00:01:45.130> go

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
give him 60 seconds to rest and we'll go

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:46.290 
give him 60 seconds to rest and we'll go
ahead<00:01:45.370> throw<00:01:45.700> on<00:01:45.760> a<00:01:45.850> different<00:01:46.150> combination

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:46.300 
ahead throw on a different combination

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.870 
ahead throw on a different combination
so<00:01:46.870> after<00:01:47.530> it's<00:01:47.860> all<00:01:47.950> said<00:01:47.979> and<00:01:48.220> done<00:01:48.370> I'm<00:01:48.700> good

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
so after it's all said and done I'm good

00:01:48.880 --> 00:02:00.850 
so after it's all said and done I'm good
15-20<00:01:49.300> minutes<00:01:49.810> or<00:01:49.930> so

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860
