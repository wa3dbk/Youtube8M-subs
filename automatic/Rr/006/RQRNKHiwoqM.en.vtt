00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:06.210
 greet you friends call me romance 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:10.830
 our motives in this little video I would 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:14.429
 I wanted to show how I play one 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.340
 a little exercise that I posted 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:20.660
 online queen guitar 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:24.810
 kill the goal of this exercise to achieve 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:28.439
 qualitative change of position in the left hand 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.840
 in the performance of the planted technology here 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.690
 all so attention span 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.000
 happens on the left hand and therefore right 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.550
 arm in this case us not so wrong 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.750
 very interested in the right hand means I 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.079
 just play with your fingers and 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:46.530
 m their turn it can also be any 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:49.620
 a pair or or no pairs or three fingers or 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:53.940
 Four years like it is important that we do have 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.320
 hand fingering fingering left 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.360
 hands attached 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.960
 again in the article which is available on 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:03.270
 garden guitar here I would only 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.500
 I wanted to explain how I move 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:09.210
 fingers like i switch wilderness to say 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.360
 the game is an exercise 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:18.650
 there were some comments with 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:18.650
 appropriate questions and so we will begin 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.570
 but 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:46.160
 the most important thing though to show here 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:49.380
 exactly jump 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:51.020
 the jump that takes place on the last 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.800
 four sixteenth notes 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:58.830
 every tact when we jump 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:02.460
 play first note si 1 percent rub 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.740
 build on the fourth and then on play the note 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:08.030
 for sharp 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:24.720
 third finger on the next third fret 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:27.540
 Now here is the most important movement and it 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:30.240
 exercise repeat at least three 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:33.420
 times farther we move on to the next 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:39.050
 position that is, we play it higher and higher and 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:39.050
 above each position several times 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:03:00.530
 the most important thing again to achieve 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:04.990
 smoothness in transition to achieve such 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.990
 sounding so that there is no difference between and 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:30.970
 then through these twenty third fingers 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:34.310
 first press the last note 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:37.970
 the last note of the passage and the next new 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:45.170
 the new passage so begins half a tone 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:47.000
 above the previous one that is 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:48.890
 we are working on these very lines 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:54.080
 which are marked in notes 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:55.540
 in notes and other yes they are they 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:59.710
 were the actual issues 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.710
 comments i hope i explained 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:05.900
 it is by no means a glissando to 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:10.090
 carts them resant resant would be 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:10.090
 completely different it was for example here 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:20.600
 there is no purpose 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:21.199
 playing woods on here is purpose 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.889
 of this 

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:23.889
 of this place 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:48.440
 with me the position quickly seems to me 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:50.630
 not the most important thing as soon as possible 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.160
 the most important thing is that such places as possible 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:55.220
 better so if you haven't 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:59.500
 it turns out very quickly quite 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:02.420
 do not despair about it 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:05.840
 concentrate better on quality 

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:11.110
 sounds on a quality position change here 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:16.160
 she 3 1 3 finger 3 3 third country 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:17.170
 first finger 4 Vlad the first word is the same 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:20.650
 the most happening 

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:20.650
 consequences on relatives 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:03.480
 something like this, I hope it was clear 

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:07.910
 and I will be glad if you have more questions 

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:07.910
 I will be glad to answer them bye
