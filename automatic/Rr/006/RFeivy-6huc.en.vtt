00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.010
 budget and without tantrums and today I want 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.900
 talk to such a very relevant 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.719
 a topic that just wanted the internet to 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.330
 the speed of sound is goji berries 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.560
 help these berries lose weight do not help 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.630
 these berries lose weight let's go with you 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.220
 today we will understand and see 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.600
 when i just started getting ready for it 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.449
 I began to look for the video of course 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.220
 information to be x and the very beginning 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.810
 I began to fall on the page which 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.730
 offer to buy from goji berries 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.980
 again some kind of marketing 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.110
 the course of the divorce and probably hildren conti 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.360
 nonsense here but then when I became 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.070
 get ready and began to look for information on 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.379
 sites which is far away 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.239
 from the first search page began to search 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.100
 information on foreign sites then 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.410
 now did not read just fell in love 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.960
 in these berries and bought them samokhin 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.840
 so here they look these berries here 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.870
 such cute taste reminds 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.690
 raisins can be with dried apricots that's just me 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.609
 Seeds here and I will tell you why 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.530
 actually bought them give them such 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.030
 good in general, these bastards are not some 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.830
 know how they were already known 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.140
 a long time ago 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:09.390
 eastern oriental medicine and on the very 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.460
 it turns out that they just got to 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.470
 us these berries now maybe they 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.450
 reached earlier but now like this 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.460
 it began to develop badly and the first of course 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.619
 what I noticed is of course on 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.950
 vitamins there are a lot of vitamin c it 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.869
 2 500 times more than citrus 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.850
 large amounts of b vitamins 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.520
 B vitamins is very good 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.710
 vitamins for nerves here for communication on 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.540
 system for brain activity and if 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.740
 you want to be more energetic 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.460
 then of course you need to get vitamins 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.400
 group b 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.329
 the next is not something to play attention 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.590
 this beta carotene and it is very good for 

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:45.240
 view yes now everyone is sitting behind 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.280
 computers are now the sun oil 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.680
 sunglasses and it's very nice 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.259
 element for the retina even by some 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.149
 sources here come in for x1 this too 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.549
 very good trace element for the retina 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.920
 and now I'm just active in cynology 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.930
 domination of active additives which 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.640
 here we buy in these capsules for 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.560
 view next to what i drew 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.060
 attention is what amino acids come in 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.640
 and because really far from 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.410
 all berries include amino acids and if you 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.599
 remember doing video for how where speaking of 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.400
 that is very important to receive 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:14.810
 quality proteins about what 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.640
 must be complete proteins 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.769
 full picket just the same squirrels in 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.079
 which includes all amino acids here 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:23.420
 18 amino acids are included and 8 of them 

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:25.310
 irreplaceable and you imagine that 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.840
 practically perfume product and publish and 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.700
 This actually noticed that when you eat 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.109
 there is a small mountain of these berries there 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.150
 you feel full enough 

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:35.480
 the next moment that drew attention 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:37.400
 This composition of course on minerals the 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.650
 there is a lot of mineral in the world 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.720
 includes 21 mineral disrepair and pay 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.459
 attention to what I drew attention to 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.620
 also always very small in dosage 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:47.450
 iron walk here and you yourself know what 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.760
 for women and for girls is very important 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:52.549
 make up for the lack of iron because 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.680
 in fact we have regular 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:57.590
 processes that occur every month 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.840
 that’s why most often 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.980
 women suffer mild us for 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.170
 order to make up 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:06.500
 blood formation process we need iron 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.689
 that's why its here its here 15 times 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:12.230
 more than spinach and spinach was the leader 

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:14.510
 iron content is as follows 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.459
 paid attention and even heard it 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:19.340
 before the mandon before she even went 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:20.660
 this we have goji berries about that 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.480
 berries year is a very good source 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:25.069
 antioxidants antioxidants like already 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.290
 now recently medicine is a year about 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:29.840
 that if you take antioxidants 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.609
 then you will rarely get sick or you don’t 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.290
 you will be sick at all because you 

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:36.319
 always protects us from free 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:39.049
 radicals they protect us from aging 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:40.519
 premature to stop reaction 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:42.949
 lipid peroxidation 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:44.959
 which destroys our shells our 

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:45.739
 cell post is actually also very 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:50.269
 great source 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:52.250
 here and I want to say that there is here 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:54.099
 eastern medicine they used to 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:57.139
 cancer treatments to recover from 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:58.989
 this may be an operation like this 

00:03:57.139 --> 00:04:01.129
 anti-inflammatory and 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:03.349
 It is written that they improve exchange 

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:05.150
 processes that is written that they 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:06.739
 accelerate metabolic processes due to this 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.500
 actually goji berries enough 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:09.660
 such 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.310
 good option then native field 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:13.230
 vitamin a poly vitamin necessarily 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:15.420
 take during weight loss because 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.730
 Well, the principle is now medicine for a long time about 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.799
 it is said that we do not get one 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:22.590
 you need a set of vitamins that 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:24.090
 should get from here 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.740
 so goji berries seem to me in this 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:28.230
 case is just a great option here 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.880
 so i bought these berries myself i can 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:31.620
 say i'm very back with the fact that 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:34.440
 he didn't come real berries because 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:36.090
 I saw that in many forums on very 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.950
 many reviews and sour thing 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.960
 it comes not its berries come already 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:42.000
 some sort of dried cranberries and people are very 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.290
 get very upset that's why down below 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.370
 I will leave a reference where 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:46.370
 I bought these berries
