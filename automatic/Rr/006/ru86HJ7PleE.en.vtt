choose to do it as a set of stairs

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.320 
choose to do it as a set of stairs
although<00:01:14.250> that<00:01:14.460> can<00:01:14.670> be<00:01:14.850> a<00:01:14.880> very<00:01:14.939> effective

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
although that can be a very effective

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.280 
although that can be a very effective
way<00:01:15.600> of<00:01:15.630> doing<00:01:15.960> it

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
way of doing it

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.999 
way of doing it
I<00:01:16.369> prefer<00:01:17.369> that<00:01:17.720> later<00:01:18.720> like<00:01:19.020> this<00:01:19.259> now<00:01:19.860> you'll

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
I prefer that later like this now you'll

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.390 
I prefer that later like this now you'll
notice<00:01:20.189> I<00:01:20.369> have<00:01:20.400> not<00:01:20.700> included<00:01:21.090> meters<00:01:21.900> here

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:22.400 
notice I have not included meters here

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.429 
notice I have not included meters here
that's<00:01:23.400> because<00:01:23.790> we<00:01:24.570> can<00:01:24.720> put<00:01:24.840> a<00:01:24.869> variety<00:01:25.110> of

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
that's because we can put a variety of

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:26.780 
that's because we can put a variety of
different<00:01:25.530> units<00:01:26.009> here<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.430> three<00:01:26.640> most

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
different units here the three most

fine<00:02:12.330> or<00:02:13.330> anything<00:02:13.569> else<00:02:13.780> you<00:02:13.930> might<00:02:14.080> come<00:02:14.290> up

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
fine or anything else you might come up

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.110 
fine or anything else you might come up
with<00:02:14.620> the<00:02:14.890> key<00:02:15.099> thing<00:02:15.370> is<00:02:15.610> that<00:02:15.640> you<00:02:15.849> must

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
with the key thing is that you must

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.780 
with the key thing is that you must
memorize<00:02:16.420> this<00:02:17.380> pattern<00:02:17.890> in<00:02:18.310> order<00:02:18.610> to<00:02:18.700> be

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
memorize this pattern in order to be

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.130 
memorize this pattern in order to be
able<00:02:18.849> to<00:02:18.970> do<00:02:19.120> conversions<00:02:19.630> easily<00:02:21.780> in<00:02:22.780> earlier

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
able to do conversions easily in earlier

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.130

grades<00:02:23.520> you<00:02:24.520> have<00:02:24.700> been<00:02:24.880> taught<00:02:25.120> to<00:02:25.420> do

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
grades you have been taught to do

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.270 
grades you have been taught to do
conversions<00:02:26.739> like<00:02:26.830> this<00:02:27.220> if<00:02:28.209> we<00:02:28.360> have<00:02:28.480> 1<00:02:28.660> meter

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
conversions like this if we have 1 meter

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:35.070 
conversions like this if we have 1 meter
add<00:02:30.360> zeros<00:02:31.530> to<00:02:32.530> make<00:02:32.680> your<00:02:32.830> conversions<00:02:34.080> and

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
add zeros to make your conversions and

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.479 
add zeros to make your conversions and
that's<00:02:35.709> how<00:02:35.860> you<00:02:35.920> would<00:02:36.069> come<00:02:36.190> up<00:02:36.280> with<00:02:36.310> an

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489 
that's how you would come up with an

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:37.140 
that's how you would come up with an
answer<00:02:36.640> like<00:02:36.880> that

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
answer like that

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.690

find that is not beneficial and I want
to<00:02:42.340> show<00:02:42.459> you<00:02:42.519> why<00:02:46.230> allow<00:02:47.230> me<00:02:47.410> to<00:02:47.500> show<00:02:47.650> you<00:02:47.709> an

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
example of how adding zeros won't work

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.039 
example of how adding zeros won't work
what<00:02:51.400> if<00:02:51.610> I<00:02:51.880> have<00:02:52.360> five<00:02:52.680> point<00:02:53.680> three<00:02:53.819> meters

what if I have five point three meters
and<00:02:56.049> I'm<00:02:56.140> going<00:02:56.290> to<00:02:56.380> add<00:02:56.470> a<00:02:56.500> zero<00:02:56.910> and<00:02:57.910> I<00:02:57.970> need

and I'm going to add a zero and I need

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:06.750 
and I'm going to add a zero and I need
to<00:02:58.209> convert<00:02:58.510> them<00:02:58.720> to<00:02:58.870> centimeters

that's<00:03:15.320> why<00:03:15.590> when<00:03:15.860> I'm<00:03:16.010> teaching<00:03:16.430> this<00:03:16.580> I

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
that's why when I'm teaching this I

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.750 
that's why when I'm teaching this I
prefer<00:03:17.570> to<00:03:17.630> think<00:03:17.750> in<00:03:18.170> terms<00:03:18.440> of<00:03:18.740> moving<00:03:19.490> the

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
sitting right here I'm going to move it

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.110 
sitting right here I'm going to move it
over<00:03:48.230> once<00:03:48.560> more<00:03:48.650> and<00:03:49.430> I'm<00:03:49.850> gonna<00:03:49.940> need<00:03:50.030> a

over once more and I'm gonna need a

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.010 
over once more and I'm gonna need a

that's<00:03:54.020> how<00:03:54.260> I<00:03:54.290> prefer<00:03:54.560> to<00:03:54.680> teach<00:03:54.830> this<00:03:55.300> one<00:03:56.300> of

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:56.390 
that's how I prefer to teach this one of

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:58.660 
that's how I prefer to teach this one of
the<00:03:56.450> challenges<00:03:56.900> though<00:03:57.080> for<00:03:57.470> students<00:03:57.800> is<00:03:58.520> to

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670 
the challenges though for students is to

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:04.050 
the challenges though for students is to
remember<00:03:58.910> which<00:03:59.510> way<00:04:00.490> do<00:04:01.490> I<00:04:01.550> move<00:04:02.020> the<00:04:03.020> decimal

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
remember which way do I move the decimal

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.120 
remember which way do I move the decimal
because<00:04:05.060> it<00:04:05.150> often<00:04:05.510> won't<00:04:05.660> remember<00:04:06.100> so<00:04:07.100> I

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:07.130 
because it often won't remember so I

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:09.760 
because it often won't remember so I
always<00:04:07.400> suggest<00:04:08.090> if<00:04:08.930> someone<00:04:09.380> who's<00:04:09.500> writing

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:09.770 
always suggest if someone who's writing

from then on they'll know does it's

here<00:04:37.370> will<00:04:38.090> continue<00:04:38.270> to<00:04:38.600> move<00:04:38.690> over<00:04:38.960> here<00:04:38.990> and

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 
here will continue to move over here and

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.420 
here will continue to move over here and
here

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:44.430 
here

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:50.060 
here
and<00:04:45.240> of<00:04:45.330> course<00:04:45.540> here<00:04:48.710> let's<00:04:49.710> do<00:04:49.830> a<00:04:49.860> few<00:04:50.009> more

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.070 
and of course here let's do a few more

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:54.080 
and of course here let's do a few more
simple<00:04:50.520> examples<00:04:52.430> on<00:04:53.430> where<00:04:53.610> to<00:04:53.699> leave<00:04:53.850> this

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 
simple examples on where to leave this

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.570 
simple examples on where to leave this
city<00:04:54.330> here<00:04:54.630> is<00:04:54.690> an<00:04:54.810> example<00:04:55.169> and<00:04:55.889> I<00:04:56.009> like<00:04:56.310> to

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580 
city here is an example and I like to

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:58.189 
city here is an example and I like to
have<00:04:56.759> students<00:04:57.210> sitting<00:04:57.360> that<00:04:57.720> leave<00:04:58.020> that

00:04:58.189 --> 00:04:58.199 
have students sitting that leave that

00:04:58.199 --> 00:04:59.900 
have students sitting that leave that
sitting<00:04:58.470> there<00:04:58.620> as<00:04:58.710> an<00:04:58.830> example<00:04:59.160> so<00:04:59.639> that<00:04:59.669> they

00:04:59.900 --> 00:04:59.910 
sitting there as an example so that they

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:01.400 
sitting there as an example so that they
are<00:05:00.150> reminded<00:05:00.600> which<00:05:00.900> way<00:05:01.050> to<00:05:01.110> move<00:05:01.259> the

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:01.410 
are reminded which way to move the

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:04.040 
are reminded which way to move the
decimal<00:05:01.590> as<00:05:02.039> they<00:05:02.190> work<00:05:02.419> so<00:05:03.419> let's<00:05:03.630> say<00:05:03.780> we<00:05:03.960> are

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
decimal as they work so let's say we are

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:10.070 
decimal as they work so let's say we are
given<00:05:04.940> seven<00:05:06.080> decimal<00:05:07.080> six<00:05:08.240> seven<00:05:09.240> kilometers

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
given seven decimal six seven kilometers

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.740 
given seven decimal six seven kilometers
we're<00:05:11.039> asked<00:05:11.220> to<00:05:11.400> convert<00:05:11.759> that<00:05:11.970> into

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:12.750 
we're asked to convert that into

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:18.140 
we're asked to convert that into
millimeters<00:05:14.930> in<00:05:15.930> the<00:05:15.990> early<00:05:16.259> stages<00:05:17.150> you're

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:18.150 
millimeters in the early stages you're

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.439 
millimeters in the early stages you're
going<00:05:18.330> to<00:05:18.419> want<00:05:18.660> to<00:05:18.810> write<00:05:19.050> down<00:05:20.300> every<00:05:21.300> single

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:21.449 
going to want to write down every single

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:23.659 
going to want to write down every single
step<00:05:21.840> so<00:05:22.080> that<00:05:22.500> you<00:05:22.590> don't<00:05:22.740> miss<00:05:23.010> any<00:05:23.310> along

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:23.669 
step so that you don't miss any along

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:28.850 
step so that you don't miss any along
the<00:05:23.820> way<00:05:26.240> moving<00:05:27.240> the<00:05:27.360> decimal<00:05:27.570> each<00:05:28.500> time

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:28.860 
the way moving the decimal each time

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:40.390 
the way moving the decimal each time
adding<00:05:29.729> placeholder<00:05:30.740> zeros<00:05:31.740> as<00:05:32.010> necessary

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:40.400 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:45.290 

of<00:05:41.400> course<00:05:41.960> you<00:05:42.960> could<00:05:43.169> also<00:05:43.350> simply<00:05:43.830> count<00:05:44.300> if

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:45.300 
of course you could also simply count if

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:47.450 
of course you could also simply count if
I'm<00:05:45.419> going<00:05:45.660> from<00:05:45.810> here<00:05:45.990> to<00:05:46.229> here<00:05:46.380> I'm<00:05:47.100> going<00:05:47.370> to

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:47.460 
I'm going from here to here I'm going to

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:52.909 
I'm going from here to here I'm going to
move<00:05:47.580> it<00:05:47.699> 1<00:05:48.000> 2<00:05:48.630> 3<00:05:49.380> 4<00:05:50.160> 5<00:05:50.789> 6<00:05:51.630> places<00:05:52.169> and<00:05:52.560> simply

00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:52.919 
move it 1 2 3 4 5 6 places and simply

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:57.950 
move it 1 2 3 4 5 6 places and simply
take<00:05:53.130> this<00:05:53.400> number<00:05:53.990> go<00:05:54.990> like<00:05:55.169> this<00:05:56.840> move<00:05:57.840> the

00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:57.960 
take this number go like this move the

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:02.150 
take this number go like this move the

00:06:06.969 --> 00:06:06.979 

00:06:06.979 --> 00:06:11.240 

erase<00:06:07.979> the<00:06:08.669> original<00:06:09.060> decimal<00:06:10.070> and<00:06:11.070> you'll

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:11.250 
erase the original decimal and you'll

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:15.110 
erase the original decimal and you'll
note<00:06:11.570> do<00:06:12.570> you<00:06:12.690> have<00:06:12.900> the<00:06:13.320> same<00:06:13.500> answer<00:06:14.120> and
