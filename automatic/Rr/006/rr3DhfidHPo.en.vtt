00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:20.880 

my<00:00:18.050> best<00:00:18.349> race<00:00:18.650> was<00:00:18.919> either<00:00:19.070> Minako<00:00:19.730> in<00:00:19.849> 61

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:20.890 
my best race was either Minako in 61

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.829 
my best race was either Minako in 61
when<00:00:21.890> I<00:00:21.919> had<00:00:22.070> the<00:00:22.189> Ferraris<00:00:22.579> behind<00:00:22.939> me<00:00:23.089> 400

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:23.839 
when I had the Ferraris behind me 400

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:26.919 
when I had the Ferraris behind me 400
laps<00:00:24.050> or<00:00:24.939> the<00:00:25.939> Mille<00:00:26.239> Miglia<00:00:26.390> which<00:00:26.719> was<00:00:26.899> a

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:26.929 
laps or the Mille Miglia which was a

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:30.370 
laps or the Mille Miglia which was a
totally<00:00:27.590> different<00:00:27.890> sort<00:00:28.099> of<00:00:28.130> on<00:00:29.019> semi<00:00:30.019> closed

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:30.380 
totally different sort of on semi closed

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.170 
totally different sort of on semi closed
roads<00:00:30.739> they<00:00:30.980> weren't<00:00:31.189> close<00:00:31.429> but<00:00:31.669> people<00:00:31.969> kept

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:32.180 
roads they weren't close but people kept

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.430 
roads they weren't close but people kept
off<00:00:32.390> them<00:00:32.629> and<00:00:32.809> thousand<00:00:33.769> miles<00:00:33.980> round<00:00:34.280> Italy

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:35.440 
off them and thousand miles round Italy

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.049 
off them and thousand miles round Italy
averaging<00:00:36.440> 100<00:00:36.800> miles<00:00:36.979> an<00:00:37.159> hour<00:00:37.280> it's<00:00:37.879> quite

00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:38.059 
averaging 100 miles an hour it's quite

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:46.119 
averaging 100 miles an hour it's quite
exciting<00:00:43.629> Targa<00:00:44.629> Florio<00:00:44.750> was<00:00:45.170> only<00:00:45.409> that<00:00:45.769> was

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:46.129 
exciting Targa Florio was only that was

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:49.119 
exciting Targa Florio was only that was
about<00:00:46.399> 45<00:00:47.210> miles<00:00:47.719> of<00:00:47.899> lap<00:00:48.080> so<00:00:48.680> I<00:00:48.769> could<00:00:48.949> learn

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:49.129 
about 45 miles of lap so I could learn

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:51.100 
about 45 miles of lap so I could learn
it<00:00:49.369> but<00:00:49.519> the<00:00:49.670> Mille<00:00:49.879> Miglia<00:00:50.119> being<00:00:50.540> a<00:00:50.600> thousand

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.110 
it but the Mille Miglia being a thousand

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:52.420 
it but the Mille Miglia being a thousand
miles<00:00:51.290> there's<00:00:51.470> no<00:00:51.619> way<00:00:51.799> I<00:00:51.830> could<00:00:52.100> learn<00:00:52.250> that

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
miles there's no way I could learn that

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.910 
miles there's no way I could learn that
we<00:00:52.580> learn<00:00:52.909> the<00:00:53.059> circuit<00:00:53.420> just<00:00:53.600> wasn't<00:00:54.080> on<00:00:54.199> so

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
we learn the circuit just wasn't on so

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.460 
we learn the circuit just wasn't on so
therefore<00:00:55.369> that<00:00:55.549> in<00:00:55.729> itself<00:00:56.720> makes<00:00:57.019> it<00:00:57.229> quite

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:57.470 
therefore that in itself makes it quite

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.499 
therefore that in itself makes it quite
a<00:00:57.500> good<00:00:57.979> challenge<00:00:58.489> because<00:00:58.850> when<00:00:59.360> you're

00:00:59.499 --> 00:00:59.509 
a good challenge because when you're

00:00:59.509 --> 00:01:01.359 
a good challenge because when you're
racing<00:00:59.750> on<00:01:00.019> the<00:01:00.140> ordinary<00:01:00.500> circuit<00:01:01.009> even<00:01:01.159> like

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:01.369 
racing on the ordinary circuit even like

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:03.850 
racing on the ordinary circuit even like
they<00:01:01.549> like<00:01:02.000> would<00:01:02.150> read<00:01:02.329> the<00:01:02.540> Targa<00:01:03.259> Florio<00:01:03.290> I

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
they like would read the Targa Florio I

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.039 
they like would read the Targa Florio I
knew<00:01:04.579> that<00:01:04.850> so<00:01:05.000> I<00:01:05.030> knew<00:01:05.269> exactly<00:01:05.360> where<00:01:05.810> I<00:01:05.840> want

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:06.049 
knew that so I knew exactly where I want

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:07.390 
knew that so I knew exactly where I want
to<00:01:06.110> be<00:01:06.320> you<00:01:06.710> know<00:01:06.829> in<00:01:06.950> other<00:01:07.070> words<00:01:07.250> you<00:01:07.340> start

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400 
to be you know in other words you start

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.760 
to be you know in other words you start
wide<00:01:07.880> you<00:01:08.090> could<00:01:08.270> claim<00:01:08.540> clip<00:01:09.020> into<00:01:09.320> the<00:01:09.439> apex

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
wide you could claim clip into the apex

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.830 
wide you could claim clip into the apex
and<00:01:10.040> then<00:01:10.189> off<00:01:10.400> whereas<00:01:11.180> when<00:01:11.329> you're<00:01:11.450> when

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
and then off whereas when you're when

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.390 
and then off whereas when you're when
you're<00:01:11.869> racing<00:01:12.170> on<00:01:12.409> the<00:01:12.530> road<00:01:12.710> you<00:01:12.920> don't<00:01:13.159> know

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400 
you're racing on the road you don't know

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.069 
you're racing on the road you don't know
you<00:01:13.850> have<00:01:13.970> to<00:01:14.090> drive<00:01:14.299> quite<00:01:14.630> differently

00:01:15.069 --> 00:01:15.079 
you have to drive quite differently

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:17.080 
you have to drive quite differently
because<00:01:15.380> whenever<00:01:15.799> you<00:01:16.159> go<00:01:16.310> into<00:01:16.340> a<00:01:16.549> corner

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
because whenever you go into a corner

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.179 
because whenever you go into a corner
have<00:01:17.630> to<00:01:17.750> sit<00:01:17.960> the<00:01:18.079> car<00:01:18.290> up<00:01:18.409> so<00:01:18.439> if<00:01:18.829> suddenly

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:19.189 
have to sit the car up so if suddenly

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:20.770 
have to sit the car up so if suddenly
the<00:01:19.310> corner<00:01:19.549> gets<00:01:19.729> tighter<00:01:20.030> you<00:01:20.750> can

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
the corner gets tighter you can

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.530 
the corner gets tighter you can
accommodate<00:01:21.500> it<00:01:21.680> but<00:01:22.220> it<00:01:22.340> doesn't<00:01:22.550> get<00:01:22.760> to<00:01:22.909> get

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540 
accommodate it but it doesn't get to get

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.540 
accommodate it but it doesn't get to get
tighter<00:01:23.870> then<00:01:24.380> you<00:01:24.590> can<00:01:24.770> also<00:01:25.010> give<00:01:25.340> more

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:25.550 
tighter then you can also give more

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:27.670 
tighter then you can also give more
power<00:01:25.850> but<00:01:26.330> the<00:01:26.479> problem<00:01:26.930> with<00:01:27.080> that<00:01:27.110> is<00:01:27.409> when

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
power but the problem with that is when

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:28.600 
power but the problem with that is when
of<00:01:27.830> course<00:01:28.010> when<00:01:28.159> you're<00:01:28.280> in<00:01:28.310> the<00:01:28.430> Mille

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
of course when you're in the Mille

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:30.430 
of course when you're in the Mille
Miglia<00:01:28.850> you've<00:01:29.450> got<00:01:29.630> people<00:01:29.900> lining<00:01:30.170> the

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:30.440 
Miglia you've got people lining the

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.670 
Miglia you've got people lining the
roads<00:01:30.650> and<00:01:31.270> I<00:01:32.270> mean<00:01:32.659> I<00:01:32.870> don't<00:01:32.930> say<00:01:33.229> literally

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 
roads and I mean I don't say literally

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.649 
roads and I mean I don't say literally
all<00:01:33.799> thousand<00:01:34.310> miles<00:01:34.490> but<00:01:34.909> I<00:01:34.970> mean<00:01:35.180> really<00:01:35.450> you

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:35.659 
all thousand miles but I mean really you

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:37.630 
all thousand miles but I mean really you
do<00:01:35.810> get<00:01:36.020> tremendous<00:01:36.320> amounts<00:01:37.010> of<00:01:37.070> the<00:01:37.220> public

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
do get tremendous amounts of the public

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.680 
do get tremendous amounts of the public
as<00:01:38.450> close<00:01:38.750> as<00:01:38.990> you<00:01:39.110> are<00:01:39.140> to<00:01:39.320> me<00:01:39.620> or<00:01:39.950> even<00:01:40.250> closer

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:40.690 
as close as you are to me or even closer

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.240 
as close as you are to me or even closer
John<00:01:41.690> Fitch<00:01:41.960> actually<00:01:42.380> I<00:01:42.440> think<00:01:42.530> is<00:01:42.770> the<00:01:42.890> guy

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
John Fitch actually I think is the guy

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.160 
John Fitch actually I think is the guy
who<00:01:43.310> had<00:01:43.460> the<00:01:43.580> idea<00:01:44.030> he<00:01:44.510> went<00:01:44.659> around<00:01:44.810> making

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
who had the idea he went around making

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.060 
who had the idea he went around making
notes<00:01:45.530> about<00:01:45.860> the<00:01:46.040> whole<00:01:46.299> thousand<00:01:47.299> miles<00:01:47.540> and

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
notes about the whole thousand miles and

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.469 
notes about the whole thousand miles and
we<00:01:49.070> did<00:01:49.250> the<00:01:49.340> same<00:01:49.520> thing<00:01:49.580> Jenks<00:01:50.150> and<00:01:50.240> I<00:01:50.330> we

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
we did the same thing Jenks and I we

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:52.780 
we did the same thing Jenks and I we
went<00:01:50.659> round<00:01:50.840> I<00:01:51.229> cut<00:01:51.920> my<00:01:52.070> wings<00:01:52.250> did<00:01:52.460> four<00:01:52.670> or

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
went round I cut my wings did four or

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.640 
went round I cut my wings did four or
five<00:01:52.940> laps<00:01:53.210> but<00:01:53.390> one<00:01:53.600> lap<00:01:53.930> remember<00:01:54.440> would

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:54.650 
five laps but one lap remember would

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:56.890 
five laps but one lap remember would
take<00:01:54.860> two<00:01:55.130> days<00:01:55.340> going<00:01:56.119> really<00:01:56.390> hard<00:01:56.720> because

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:56.900 
take two days going really hard because

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.020 
take two days going really hard because
you're<00:01:57.110> talking<00:01:57.380> 500<00:01:58.159> miles<00:01:58.369> in<00:01:58.580> a<00:01:58.700> day<00:01:58.729> in

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
you're talking 500 miles in a day in

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.420 
you're talking 500 miles in a day in
Europe<00:01:59.360> or<00:01:59.780> in<00:01:59.869> Italy<00:02:00.020> it's<00:02:00.619> quite<00:02:00.860> a<00:02:00.890> mess

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 
Europe or in Italy it's quite a mess

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.460 
Europe or in Italy it's quite a mess
you've<00:02:01.700> been<00:02:01.820> doing<00:02:02.090> that<00:02:02.180> in<00:02:02.240> the<00:02:02.450> day<00:02:02.630> and<00:02:02.900> so

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470
