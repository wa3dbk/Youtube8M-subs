what<00:00:33.239> we<00:00:33.360> do<00:00:33.570> here<00:00:33.600> is<00:00:34.170> we<00:00:34.260> we<00:00:35.070> get<00:00:36.050> females

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
what we do here is we we get females

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.819 
what we do here is we we get females
that<00:00:37.379> are<00:00:37.680> carrying<00:00:38.520> eggs<00:00:39.380> female<00:00:40.380> lobsters

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
that are carrying eggs female lobsters

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.880 
that are carrying eggs female lobsters
that<00:00:41.040> are<00:00:41.250> carrying<00:00:41.550> eggs<00:00:41.820> and<00:00:42.620> they<00:00:43.620> carry

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
that are carrying eggs and they carry

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.650 
that are carrying eggs and they carry
those<00:00:44.040> eggs<00:00:44.370> through<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.670> winter<00:00:44.970> and<00:00:45.210> then

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
those eggs through the winter and then

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.120 
those eggs through the winter and then
when<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.840> water<00:00:46.020> warms<00:00:46.440> up<00:00:46.590> in<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.829> spring

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:47.130 
when the water warms up in the spring

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.370 
when the water warms up in the spring
and<00:00:47.400> then<00:00:47.730> in<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.060> natural<00:00:48.450> environment<00:00:48.540> they

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:49.380 
and then in the natural environment they

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.580 
and then in the natural environment they
those<00:00:49.950> eggs<00:00:50.250> hatch<00:00:50.640> into<00:00:51.120> small<00:00:51.540> larvae<00:00:52.050> so

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
those eggs hatch into small larvae so

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.110 
those eggs hatch into small larvae so
what<00:00:52.739> we<00:00:52.829> do<00:00:52.950> here<00:00:52.980> is<00:00:53.250> we<00:00:53.280> try<00:00:53.460> to<00:00:53.520> control<00:00:53.940> the

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
what we do here is we try to control the

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.020 
what we do here is we try to control the
process<00:00:54.329> a<00:00:54.600> bit<00:00:54.950> so<00:00:55.950> we<00:00:55.980> have<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.610> fishermen

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
process a bit so we have the fishermen

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.479 
process a bit so we have the fishermen
provide<00:00:57.329> us<00:00:57.540> with<00:00:57.829> buried<00:00:58.829> females<00:00:59.250> they're

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
provide us with buried females they're

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:00.620 
provide us with buried females they're
buried<00:00:59.760> because<00:01:00.030> they<00:01:00.120> have<00:01:00.239> these<00:01:00.360> small

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:00.630 
buried because they have these small

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:02.030 
buried because they have these small
eggs<00:01:00.840> in<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.110> admin<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:01.530> we'll<00:01:01.680> show<00:01:02.010> you

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:02.040 
eggs in the admin and we'll show you

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:07.219 
eggs in the admin and we'll show you
some<00:01:02.160> pictures<00:01:02.610> of<00:01:02.700> that<00:01:02.760> in<00:01:03.090> a<00:01:03.180> minute<00:01:03.360> and<00:01:06.229> we

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
some pictures of that in a minute and we

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.380 
some pictures of that in a minute and we
they<00:01:08.130> come<00:01:08.310> in<00:01:08.399> at<00:01:08.490> ambient<00:01:08.909> temperature<00:01:09.299> the

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
they come in at ambient temperature the

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.810 
they come in at ambient temperature the
seawater<00:01:09.810> which<00:01:09.990> right<00:01:10.200> now<00:01:10.229> is<00:01:10.500> around<00:01:10.830> 14<00:01:11.790> or

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
seawater which right now is around 14 or

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.860 
seawater which right now is around 14 or
15<00:01:12.240> degrees<00:01:12.330> Celsius<00:01:13.220> so<00:01:14.220> here<00:01:14.460> we<00:01:14.640> we<00:01:15.479> push

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:15.870 
15 degrees Celsius so here we we push

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:17.600 
15 degrees Celsius so here we we push
mother<00:01:16.110> nature<00:01:16.500> along<00:01:16.680> a<00:01:16.740> bit<00:01:17.040> we<00:01:17.190> raise<00:01:17.400> the

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
mother nature along a bit we raise the

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.430 
mother nature along a bit we raise the
temperature<00:01:17.820> up<00:01:18.210> over<00:01:18.570> over<00:01:18.960> a<00:01:18.990> period<00:01:19.229> of<00:01:19.350> a

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:19.440 
temperature up over over a period of a

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.800 
temperature up over over a period of a
week<00:01:19.470> and<00:01:19.890> we<00:01:20.370> hold<00:01:20.729> those<00:01:20.909> females<00:01:21.330> in<00:01:21.510> 20

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
week and we hold those females in 20

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.190 
week and we hold those females in 20
degrees<00:01:21.900> Celsius<00:01:22.560> water<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:23.960> when<00:01:24.960> we<00:01:25.049> raise

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
degrees Celsius water and when we raise

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.930 
degrees Celsius water and when we raise
the<00:01:25.229> temperature<00:01:25.530> and<00:01:26.040> there's<00:01:26.250> a<00:01:26.400> finished

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:26.940 
the temperature and there's a finished

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.880 
the temperature and there's a finished
development<00:01:27.330> they<00:01:27.720> start<00:01:27.990> to<00:01:28.110> hatch<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:28.710> they

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
development they start to hatch and they

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.130 
development they start to hatch and they
hatch<00:01:29.640> into<00:01:29.850> what<00:01:30.030> we<00:01:30.119> call<00:01:30.299> a<00:01:30.330> stage<00:01:30.750> one

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
hatch into what we call a stage one

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.910 
hatch into what we call a stage one
lobster<00:01:31.890> larvae<00:01:32.280> after<00:01:33.090> about<00:01:33.360> in<00:01:33.830> four<00:01:34.830> or

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
lobster larvae after about in four or

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.620 
lobster larvae after about in four or
five<00:01:35.130> days<00:01:35.549> depending<00:01:35.729> in<00:01:36.119> on<00:01:36.240> temperature

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
five days depending in on temperature

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.630 
five days depending in on temperature
but<00:01:36.840> within<00:01:36.990> a<00:01:37.140> week<00:01:37.320> they<00:01:37.680> they<00:01:38.130> molt<00:01:38.430> they

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
but within a week they they molt they

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.130 
but within a week they they molt they
lose<00:01:38.850> their<00:01:39.030> shell<00:01:39.299> they<00:01:39.479> grow<00:01:39.630> a<00:01:39.659> new<00:01:39.840> shell

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
lose their shell they grow a new shell

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.500 
lose their shell they grow a new shell
and<00:01:40.439> they<00:01:41.010> that's<00:01:41.280> called<00:01:41.549> a<00:01:41.640> stage<00:01:41.880> 2<00:01:42.240> and

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:42.510 
and they that's called a stage 2 and

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.510 
and they that's called a stage 2 and
stage<00:01:42.570> 2<00:01:43.140> they<00:01:43.740> start<00:01:44.010> to<00:01:44.100> look<00:01:44.159> a<00:01:44.280> little<00:01:44.369> bit

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
stage 2 they start to look a little bit

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.640 
stage 2 they start to look a little bit
more<00:01:44.729> like<00:01:44.880> a<00:01:44.909> lobster<00:01:45.210> they've<00:01:45.659> got<00:01:45.840> a<00:01:46.049> little

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:46.650 
more like a lobster they've got a little

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:48.020 
more like a lobster they've got a little
bit<00:01:46.740> more<00:01:46.770> of<00:01:47.010> a<00:01:47.070> tail<00:01:47.340> they've<00:01:47.729> got<00:01:47.880> they

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
bit more of a tail they've got they

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.690 
bit more of a tail they've got they
starting<00:01:48.330> to<00:01:48.420> grow<00:01:48.540> some<00:01:48.570> appendages<00:01:49.350> and

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
starting to grow some appendages and

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.450 
starting to grow some appendages and
they<00:01:50.700> last<00:01:50.970> on<00:01:51.119> that<00:01:51.180> stage<00:01:51.600> for<00:01:52.280> almost<00:01:53.280> a

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
they last on that stage for almost a

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.120 
they last on that stage for almost a
week<00:01:53.490> again<00:01:54.350> temperature<00:01:55.350> dependent<00:01:55.830> but<00:01:55.890> the

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
week again temperature dependent but the

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.890 
week again temperature dependent but the
temperatures<00:01:56.520> were<00:01:56.670> raised<00:01:56.850> them<00:01:57.119> takes

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:57.900 
temperatures were raised them takes

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.140 
temperatures were raised them takes
about<00:01:58.049> a<00:01:58.200> week<00:01:58.439> and<00:01:58.650> then<00:01:59.310> they<00:01:59.460> molt<00:01:59.670> again<00:01:59.970> to

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:00.150 
about a week and then they molt again to
