Princeton offense you know we came out a
little<00:00:30.770> slow<00:00:31.039> in<00:00:31.070> the<00:00:31.160> beginning<00:00:31.279> but<00:00:31.579> toward

00:00:32.319 --> 00:00:32.329 
little slow in the beginning but toward

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:33.549 
little slow in the beginning but toward
the<00:00:32.360> end<00:00:32.450> we<00:00:32.660> end<00:00:32.780> up<00:00:32.900> picking<00:00:33.050> it<00:00:33.260> up<00:00:33.410> and

00:00:33.549 --> 00:00:33.559 
the end we end up picking it up and

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:35.740 
the end we end up picking it up and
coming<00:00:34.460> out<00:00:34.520> with<00:00:34.579> the<00:00:34.730> W<00:00:35.000> we<00:00:35.329> came<00:00:35.480> out<00:00:35.629> with

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:35.750 
coming out with the W we came out with

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.390 
coming out with the W we came out with
the<00:00:35.870> wrong<00:00:36.020> approach<00:00:36.350> in<00:00:36.829> the<00:00:37.040> beginning

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:37.400 
the wrong approach in the beginning

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.600 
the wrong approach in the beginning
because<00:00:37.550> we're<00:00:38.120> a<00:00:38.150> little<00:00:38.269> dead<00:00:38.620> but<00:00:39.620> I<00:00:39.949> feel

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:40.610 
because we're a little dead but I feel

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.340

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:44.120 
three practices will talk about our

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.150 
three practices will talk about our
energy<00:00:44.300> that<00:00:44.989> we<00:00:45.080> need<00:00:45.230> to<00:00:45.260> put<00:00:45.500> forth<00:00:45.769> on

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:46.160 
energy that we need to put forth on

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.150 
energy that we need to put forth on
Monday<00:00:46.489> move<00:00:46.879> on<00:00:47.320> it's<00:00:48.320> our<00:00:48.440> 1st<00:00:48.650> game<00:00:48.739> our

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:49.160

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
first real game competitive and so I

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.729 
first real game competitive and so I
mean<00:00:52.699> we<00:00:53.360> tried<00:00:53.510> our<00:00:53.690> best<00:00:53.720> to<00:00:54.260> come<00:00:54.530> out

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:54.739 
mean we tried our best to come out

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:57.270 
mean we tried our best to come out
victorious<00:00:55.250> and<00:00:55.760> we<00:00:55.850> did<00:00:56.059> I<00:00:56.269> mean<00:00:56.510> we<00:00:56.600> just<00:00:56.750> met

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:57.280 
victorious and we did I mean we just met

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.680 
victorious and we did I mean we just met
if<00:00:58.280> we<00:00:58.400> would've<00:00:58.580> came<00:00:58.699> out<00:00:58.879> and<00:00:59.000> beaten<00:00:59.180> by<00:00:59.299> 40

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
if we would've came out and beaten by 40

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.509 
if we would've came out and beaten by 40
probably<00:01:00.500> got<00:01:00.619> legs<00:01:00.860> for<00:01:00.979> these<00:01:01.070> games<00:01:01.250> not<00:01:01.489> a

00:01:01.509 --> 00:01:01.519 
probably got legs for these games not a

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:04.030 
probably got legs for these games not a
role<00:01:01.729> so<00:01:01.909> we<00:01:02.030> need<00:01:02.210> this<00:01:02.330> test<00:01:02.629> you<00:01:02.839> know<00:01:03.440> you

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 
role so we need this test you know you

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.200 
role so we need this test you know you
know<00:01:04.190> hopefully<00:01:04.580> we<00:01:04.790> can<00:01:04.850> just<00:01:04.970> go<00:01:05.180> in

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
know hopefully we can just go in

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.570 
know hopefully we can just go in
practicing<00:01:05.810> watch<00:01:06.619> film<00:01:06.979> and<00:01:07.130> see<00:01:07.340> things

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:07.580 
practicing watch film and see things

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.370 
practicing watch film and see things
that<00:01:07.760> we<00:01:07.850> need<00:01:07.970> to<00:01:08.030> work<00:01:08.270> on<00:01:08.479> that's<00:01:09.110> no<00:01:09.229> help

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
that we need to work on that's no help

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.410 
that we need to work on that's no help
us<00:01:09.560> be<00:01:09.650> better<00:01:09.680> as<00:01:10.159> a<00:01:10.220> team<00:01:10.310> then<00:01:11.119> we<00:01:11.240> played

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420

okay defensively I mean that's nowhere
close<00:01:13.430> to<00:01:13.640> as<00:01:14.060> good<00:01:14.450> of<00:01:14.600> a<00:01:14.780> defensive<00:01:15.439> team

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:15.619

close to as good of a defensive team
that<00:01:15.770> we<00:01:15.860> are<00:01:16.040> I<00:01:16.280> mean<00:01:16.460> we're<00:01:16.580> capable<00:01:16.760> of

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
that we are I mean we're capable of

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.630 
that we are I mean we're capable of
being<00:01:17.240> a<00:01:17.360> lot<00:01:17.510> better<00:01:17.799> we<00:01:18.799> just<00:01:19.070> that<00:01:19.460> goes

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
being a lot better we just that goes

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.460 
being a lot better we just that goes
back<00:01:19.820> to<00:01:20.000> the<00:01:20.119> energy<00:01:20.420> factor<00:01:20.810> tonight<00:01:21.200> we

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
back to the energy factor tonight we

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.200

mean this is a hardstyle to play against
I<00:01:32.600> mean<00:01:33.200> we<00:01:33.290> can't<00:01:33.500> simulate<00:01:33.770> that<00:01:34.040> in

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
I mean we can't simulate that in

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.070 
I mean we can't simulate that in
practice<00:01:34.670> we<00:01:34.790> don't<00:01:35.180> play<00:01:35.420> like<00:01:35.450> this<00:01:35.810> it's

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:36.080 
practice we don't play like this it's

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.110 
practice we don't play like this it's
just<00:01:36.290> hard<00:01:36.500> as<00:01:36.710> it<00:01:37.070> was<00:01:37.220> good<00:01:37.460> for<00:01:37.640> our<00:01:37.790> fours

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:38.120 
just hard as it was good for our fours

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.390
