now we want to control the loss of
control<00:02:57.690> and<00:02:58.430> we<00:02:59.430> thinking<00:02:59.730> also<00:02:59.940> about<00:03:00.500> what

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
control and we thinking also about what

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.860 
control and we thinking also about what
is<00:03:01.650> the<00:03:01.970> transportation<00:03:02.970> and<00:03:03.480> what<00:03:03.660> is<00:03:03.780> the

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
is the transportation and what is the

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.979 
is the transportation and what is the
future<00:03:04.049> for<00:03:04.410> transportation<00:03:05.069> our<00:03:05.989> solution

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
future for transportation our solution

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:09.890 
future for transportation our solution
is<00:03:07.169> to<00:03:07.739> roll<00:03:07.980> them<00:03:08.220> to<00:03:09.120> make<00:03:09.329> this<00:03:09.569> project

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
is to roll them to make this project

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:15.349 
is to roll them to make this project
smaller<00:03:10.889> and<00:03:11.250> you<00:03:12.209> can<00:03:12.599> send<00:03:13.260> this<00:03:13.410> in<00:03:14.359> small

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:15.359 
smaller and you can send this in small

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:19.220 
smaller and you can send this in small
package<00:03:16.049> and<00:03:16.430> then<00:03:17.430> you<00:03:17.579> can<00:03:17.760> you<00:03:18.660> can<00:03:18.840> deform

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
package and then you can you can deform

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:24.880 
package and then you can you can deform
this

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:29.210
