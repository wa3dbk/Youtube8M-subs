you're familiar with tom danly designs
we've<00:00:42.899> incorporated<00:00:43.230> his<00:00:43.800> technology<00:00:44.460> into

00:00:44.689 --> 00:00:44.699 
we've incorporated his technology into

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:47.150 
we've incorporated his technology into
here<00:00:44.940> for<00:00:45.449> the<00:00:45.600> hunt<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:46.140> high<00:00:46.289> frequency<00:00:46.980> and

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
here for the hunt the high frequency and

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.849 
here for the hunt the high frequency and
on<00:00:47.670> that<00:00:47.940> tongue<00:00:48.120> danly<00:00:48.480> design<00:00:48.809> it<00:00:49.079> performs

00:00:49.849 --> 00:00:49.859 
on that tongue danly design it performs

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:51.919 
on that tongue danly design it performs
the<00:00:50.010> airflow<00:00:50.550> up<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:50.910> high<00:00:51.030> frequency<00:00:51.629> driver

00:00:51.919 --> 00:00:51.929 
the airflow up the high frequency driver

00:00:51.929 --> 00:00:54.410 
the airflow up the high frequency driver
so<00:00:52.530> that<00:00:52.559> it<00:00:52.859> all<00:00:53.070> is<00:00:53.280> time<00:00:53.609> aligned<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:54.120> comes

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
so that it all is time aligned and comes

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.740 
so that it all is time aligned and comes
out<00:00:54.660> at<00:00:54.899> one<00:00:55.589> peak<00:00:56.219> point<00:00:56.539> everything<00:00:57.539> comes

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
out at one peak point everything comes

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.419 
out at one peak point everything comes
out<00:00:57.870> of<00:00:57.960> that<00:00:58.079> driver<00:00:58.379> travels<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.160> same

00:00:59.419 --> 00:00:59.429 
out of that driver travels the same

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:01.669 
out of that driver travels the same
distance<00:00:59.850> and<00:01:00.120> you're<00:01:00.600> gonna<00:01:00.749> get<00:01:01.019> that<00:01:01.350> crisp

00:01:01.669 --> 00:01:01.679 
distance and you're gonna get that crisp

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:05.990 
distance and you're gonna get that crisp
clean<00:01:02.219> long<00:01:02.969> push<00:01:03.559> true<00:01:04.559> sound<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:05.250> this<00:01:05.820> is

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
clean long push true sound and this is

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.330 
clean long push true sound and this is
something<00:01:06.240> incorporated<00:01:07.079> in<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.259> PSA<00:01:07.740> one<00:01:07.950> it

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
something incorporated in the PSA one it

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.270 
something incorporated in the PSA one it
is<00:01:08.970> a<00:01:09.000> cabinet<00:01:09.630> that<00:01:10.110> you<00:01:10.170> can<00:01:10.530> put<00:01:10.770> on<00:01:10.920> a<00:01:10.950> stand

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
is a cabinet that you can put on a stand

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.179 
is a cabinet that you can put on a stand
mount<00:01:11.520> have<00:01:12.270> two<00:01:12.540> units<00:01:12.960> so<00:01:13.200> you're<00:01:13.799> getting<00:01:14.100> a

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
mount have two units so you're getting a

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.190 
mount have two units so you're getting a
hundred<00:01:14.520> and<00:01:14.610> ten<00:01:14.790> and<00:01:15.119> five<00:01:15.630> sixty

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
hundred and ten and five sixty

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.770 
hundred and ten and five sixty
dispersion<00:01:16.829> they're<00:01:17.460> on<00:01:17.640> a<00:01:17.670> 15<00:01:18.180> degree<00:01:18.329> so

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
dispersion they're on a 15 degree so

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.359 
dispersion they're on a 15 degree so
when<00:01:18.960> you<00:01:19.049> mount<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.500> two<00:01:19.680> of<00:01:19.799> them<00:01:19.920> you're

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
when you mount the two of them you're

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.280 
when you mount the two of them you're
getting<00:01:20.549> a<00:01:20.729> thirty<00:01:21.000> degree<00:01:21.240> coverage<00:01:21.689> off<00:01:22.079> of

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
getting a thirty degree coverage off of

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.819 
getting a thirty degree coverage off of
that<00:01:22.409> dispersion<00:01:23.100> they<00:01:24.090> are<00:01:24.240> locked<00:01:24.570> together

00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:24.829 
that dispersion they are locked together

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:28.010 
that dispersion they are locked together
with<00:01:25.829> jensen<00:01:26.520> technology<00:01:27.090> there<00:01:27.360> so

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
with jensen technology there so

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.840 
with jensen technology there so
therefore<00:01:28.439> it's<00:01:28.649> going<00:01:28.860> to<00:01:29.009> be<00:01:29.130> nice<00:01:29.399> and<00:01:29.610> true

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
therefore it's going to be nice and true

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.389 
therefore it's going to be nice and true
and<00:01:29.970> strong<00:01:30.270> you<00:01:30.630> will<00:01:31.500> notice<00:01:31.829> there<00:01:32.009> is<00:01:32.159> feet

00:01:32.389 --> 00:01:32.399 
and strong you will notice there is feet

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:34.459 
and strong you will notice there is feet
you<00:01:32.850> can<00:01:33.119> turn<00:01:33.329> them<00:01:33.540> over<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:33.930> stand<00:01:34.170> them<00:01:34.350> up

00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:34.469 
you can turn them over and stand them up

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:37.100 
you can turn them over and stand them up
but<00:01:35.250> on<00:01:35.369> a<00:01:35.399> pole<00:01:35.759> mount<00:01:36.030> you're<00:01:36.600> gonna<00:01:36.780> find

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
but on a pole mount you're gonna find

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.530 
but on a pole mount you're gonna find
this<00:01:37.350> to<00:01:37.829> be<00:01:37.860> quite<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.520> best<00:01:38.700> way<00:01:38.969> to<00:01:39.000> use<00:01:39.270> it

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
this to be quite the best way to use it

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.289 
this to be quite the best way to use it
notice<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.530> angle<00:01:40.710> on<00:01:41.040> here<00:01:41.310> it's<00:01:41.729> a<00:01:41.820> 15

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
notice the angle on here it's a 15

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.330 
notice the angle on here it's a 15
degree<00:01:42.479> slope<00:01:43.049> off<00:01:43.290> of<00:01:43.469> there<00:01:43.619> because<00:01:44.009> i've

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
degree slope off of there because i've

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.550 
degree slope off of there because i've
got<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.729> pole<00:01:44.969> mount<00:01:45.210> sitting<00:01:46.079> on<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.320> first

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
got the pole mount sitting on the first

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.789 
got the pole mount sitting on the first
position<00:01:47.240> if<00:01:48.240> you're<00:01:48.479> on<00:01:48.659> a<00:01:48.689> riser<00:01:49.020> you<00:01:49.439> need

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
position if you're on a riser you need

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.340 
position if you're on a riser you need
to<00:01:49.890> point<00:01:50.100> it<00:01:50.280> down<00:01:50.490> to<00:01:50.939> your<00:01:51.149> audience<00:01:51.630> but<00:01:52.200> if

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
to point it down to your audience but if

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.679 
to point it down to your audience but if
you're<00:01:52.500> down<00:01:52.680> at<00:01:52.860> ground<00:01:53.130> level<00:01:53.450> this<00:01:54.450> might

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
you're down at ground level this might

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.630 
you're down at ground level this might
not<00:01:54.719> be<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:55.200> right<00:01:55.320> angle<00:01:55.740> so<00:01:56.250> you'd<00:01:56.399> put<00:01:56.549> it

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
not be the right angle so you'd put it

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.849 
not be the right angle so you'd put it
in<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:56.820> back<00:01:57.000> position<00:01:57.270> which<00:01:58.200> is<00:01:58.409> a<00:01:58.439> 90
