00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.180
 hello good friends today I will present you a video of myths and legends of the 

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:05.480
 video game 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.289
 Do not jared more parts as they score 

00:00:08.289 --> 00:00:12.289
 good first myth or legend super mariobros jumping the flag of the goal 

00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:15.999
 when the 'super mario' triumphed revolutionizing platform games 

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:18.100
 known until then 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.050
 back in the 80s 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.380
 an urban legend emerged that ensured that it was possible to jump the flag of the 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.380
 goal that we were at the end of the levels obviously not counting the 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.779
 castles 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:32.420
 as a friend of a friend I had got it 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:36.190
 many try to repeat the feat wielding the harness pad 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.620
 but surely without getting the expected results 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.040
 it will be possible to jump the flag 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.070
 what will be behind the castle 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.960
 To answer these questions it is best that you watch the following video 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:56.190
 as you can see it is possible to jump the flag in the super mario bros 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.520
 at least at level 3 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.760
 3 although some say that at level 7 2 it is also possible 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.750
 when surpassing the it does not happen anything special 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.630
 and if we leave the castle behind we will enter a monotonous scenario 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.910
 from which we can not leave until Mario dies when the time runs out 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.280
 another way to jump the flags including the level 1 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.340
 1 is using a glitches that allows us to enter a troopa level 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.670
 end of the screen and use it as a trampoline 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.670
 Finally it should be added that in the super mario bros 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.820
 of homework it is also possible to jump the flag in several levels 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.880
 the cover of the super mario galaxy of wii sowed controversy in web forums and 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.830
 industry magazines when it was discovered that the letters of the title hid the 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:49.460
 message or rmr gay 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.050
 you are a gay gentleman 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.950
 to get it you just have to keep those letters that have 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.950
 a reflection of light in its lower part 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.020
 when arcade machine salons were a profitable business not like now 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.489
 that the only machines that give money are the slots 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:16.279
 talking to friends, stories about machines that were the same in the 

00:02:16.279 --> 00:02:18.349
 that the game was something different 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:22.459
 In many cases, this was favored by the owners' tax collection 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.489
 of the salons who had gotten into the configuration panel and 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:30.060
 they had increased the difficulty to get the quarters 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.080
 players in a faster way 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.590
 especially effective when the machines were new and formed 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:36.849
 tails 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:39.670
 but leaving the difficulty increases apart 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.850
 Once a machine appeared that again had nothing 

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:45.319
 a strict more hayter 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:49.340
 some said after playing the world war and orsi at the champion edition 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:50.579
 but none of that 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:53.789
 this machine was completely different 

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:58.459
 known as the strict hayter second champion rainbow edition this game is 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.919
 one of the original title of capcom to which are added a few novelties 

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:06.299
 quite strange but they add a plus of excitement and fun to a game 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:08.270
 that many of us had very trite 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:12.450
 magics are better many fighters have agok hens these are 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.480
 airships and we can have several at the same time on screen 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:19.890
 the game moved much faster than the original ark 

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:25.379
 you could change players during the game by pressing the player 1 key 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:28.510
 possibility of launching almost any type of attack in the air 

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:32.199
 etc 

00:03:35.779 --> 00:03:39.969
 an urban legend ensures that the original name of the first platforms of the 

00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:44.019
 story was monkey com but that would finally be called donkey with by 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:45.949
 fault of a translation error 

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:49.209
 let's see what is true and what is false after this story 

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:53.629
 sure we all agree with miyamoto that you eat a good name 

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:54.559
 for a gorilla 

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:58.389
 so good that the Japanese company had to go to trial because of the lawsuit 

00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:01.510
 interposed by the universal producer city studies 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.229
 holder of the rights to the movie king kong 

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:07.539
 in the end he won nintendo but this is another story 

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:10.779
 what interests us is because I don t 

00:04:10.779 --> 00:04:14.909
 at this point we can consider several theories of why the game did not end 

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:16.870
 calling himself monkey with 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.540
 the typo / translation error could have been an error of 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:21.529
 translation 

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:22.259
 you are right 

00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:24.419
 although it would be quite complicated 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:28.880
 On the one hand, a monkey and a donkey are two animals that are sufficiently different and 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.330
 roh the pronunciation of the letters d and m are well very different and it 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.999
 they find relatively far inside the keyboard layout 

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:40.830
 Some people say that when Nintendo realized the error 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.220
 decided not to correct it 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:45.430
 since he had thousands of stickers for the machines already printed 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.250
 marquis smith 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:51.410
 editor of the club magazine nintendo magazine opts for this theory 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:55.100
 ensuring that everything originated with a typo in a fax sent 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:57.289
 from nintendo japan 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:00.830
 the telephone conversation another legend tells us that it is terror 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:04.449
 came up in a telephone conversation between miyamoto and the importers 

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:05.669
 American people 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:09.030
 when miyamoto pronounced the game title monkey com 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:12.910
 importers understood touch and because of the poor quality of the 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:13.949
 line 

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:17.509
 the character of the protagonist this last story tells us that to the 

00:05:17.509 --> 00:05:21.229
 time to baptize the protagonist gorilla miyamoto looked for an adjective that 

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:23.449
 define the character of the ape 

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:26.460
 He took a dictionary and looked for a synonym for stupid 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.460
 stupid and there found the word don t 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.210
 there's really no indication that the name donkey kong is due to a fault 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:38.169
 typographical in a fax to a bad pronunciation or an error of 

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:39.089
 translation 

00:05:39.089 --> 00:05:40.360
 shigeru miyamoto 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.440
 that undoubtedly knows the name he chose 

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:46.420
 He stated on several occasions that he chose the word donkey to characterize the 

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:50.360
 stubbornness of the character and the word with so that we all thought of a gorilla 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:52.020
 good friends 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:54.560
 I hope you liked this first part 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:58.540
 I also forgot to say that I'm not going to talk about common myths or legends 

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:00.490
 like the stems of tollo polybius 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:01.189
 LOL 

00:06:01.189 --> 00:06:04.669
 Well the source from which I get this information is from a post taringa
