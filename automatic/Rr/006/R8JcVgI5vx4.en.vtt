is also another avatar of death in the
DC<00:00:34.710> Universe<00:00:35.360> now<00:00:36.360> all<00:00:36.600> three<00:00:36.930> of<00:00:36.960> these

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
DC Universe now all three of these

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.380 
DC Universe now all three of these
versions<00:00:37.410> of<00:00:37.770> death<00:00:37.980> and<00:00:38.280> by<00:00:38.430> association<00:00:38.790> are

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
versions of death and by association are

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.750 
versions of death and by association are
linked<00:00:40.020> lot<00:00:40.500> of<00:00:40.680> people<00:00:40.980> are<00:00:41.190> really<00:00:41.460> not

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
linked lot of people are really not

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.639 
linked lot of people are really not
aware<00:00:41.879> of<00:00:42.090> this<00:00:42.329> so<00:00:42.809> I<00:00:42.840> figured<00:00:43.200> we<00:00:43.440> might<00:00:43.469> as

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
aware of this so I figured we might as

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:44.930 
aware of this so I figured we might as
well<00:00:43.770> just<00:00:44.010> talk<00:00:44.280> about<00:00:44.430> it

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
well just talk about it

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.639 
well just talk about it
so<00:00:45.149> death<00:00:45.390> of<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.719> endless<00:00:46.170> is<00:00:46.379> not<00:00:46.620> a

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
so death of the endless is not a

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.650 
so death of the endless is not a
personification<00:00:47.039> of<00:00:47.610> death<00:00:47.879> she's<00:00:48.239> not<00:00:48.480> an

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
personification of death she's not an

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.510 
personification of death she's not an
avatar<00:00:49.260> of<00:00:49.289> death<00:00:49.379> and<00:00:49.770> she's<00:00:50.250> not<00:00:50.430> an

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
avatar of death and she's not an

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.700 
avatar of death and she's not an
incarnation<00:00:51.180> of<00:00:51.510> death<00:00:51.750> she<00:00:52.410> is<00:00:52.789> death<00:00:53.789> itself

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 
incarnation of death she is death itself

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.560 
incarnation of death she is death itself
meaning<00:00:55.710> that<00:00:56.010> any<00:00:56.280> other<00:00:56.670> avatars<00:00:57.390> and

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
meaning that any other avatars and

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.349 
meaning that any other avatars and
personifications<00:00:58.410> of<00:00:58.559> death<00:00:58.829> are<00:00:59.359> extensions

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
personifications of death are extensions

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.290 
personifications of death are extensions
of<00:01:00.570> her<00:01:01.260> obviously<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.370> other<00:01:02.520> avatars<00:01:02.940> and

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
of her obviously the other avatars and

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.179 
of her obviously the other avatars and
personifications<00:01:04.049> of<00:01:04.199> death<00:01:04.409> can<00:01:04.739> function

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
personifications of death can function

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.760 
personifications of death can function
under<00:01:05.460> their<00:01:05.760> own<00:01:05.939> freewill<00:01:06.439> but<00:01:07.439> none<00:01:07.740> of

under their own freewill but none of
them<00:01:08.010> are<00:01:08.250> above<00:01:08.790> her<00:01:09.060> when<00:01:09.330> it<00:01:09.450> comes<00:01:09.720> to

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
them are above her when it comes to

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.850 
them are above her when it comes to
death<00:01:10.140> because<00:01:10.409> she<00:01:10.590> is<00:01:11.310> death<00:01:12.060> itself<00:01:12.650> now<00:01:13.650> as

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
death because she is death itself now as

now<00:02:03.329> each<00:02:03.659> of<00:02:03.930> them<00:02:04.079> represents<00:02:04.649> something

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
now each of them represents something

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.219 
now each of them represents something
specific<00:02:05.880> to<00:02:06.090> do<00:02:06.240> with<00:02:06.360> death<00:02:06.630> in<00:02:06.869> the<00:02:06.990> DC

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
specific to do with death in the DC

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.529 
specific to do with death in the DC
Universe<00:02:07.729> meaning<00:02:08.729> they<00:02:08.910> don't<00:02:09.090> represent

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
Universe meaning they don't represent

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.020 
Universe meaning they don't represent
death<00:02:09.989> as<00:02:10.200> a<00:02:10.259> whole<00:02:10.800> let's<00:02:11.340> start<00:02:11.670> over<00:02:11.849> the

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
death as a whole let's start over the

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.790 
death as a whole let's start over the
black<00:02:12.180> racer<00:02:12.690> he<00:02:12.959> represents

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
black racer he represents

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.640 
black racer he represents
as<00:02:14.010> an<00:02:14.310> inevitability<00:02:14.940> it's<00:02:15.660> part<00:02:15.930> of<00:02:16.080> life<00:02:16.320> if

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
as an inevitability it's part of life if

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.350 
as an inevitability it's part of life if
you<00:02:16.770> want<00:02:16.950> to<00:02:17.040> live<00:02:17.250> you<00:02:17.520> gotta<00:02:17.700> die<00:02:17.970> as<00:02:18.150> well

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
you want to live you gotta die as well

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.080 
you want to live you gotta die as well
so<00:02:18.840> the<00:02:18.930> black<00:02:19.140> races<00:02:19.710> human<00:02:20.280> form<00:02:20.610> is<00:02:20.820> that<00:02:20.880> of

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
so the black races human form is that of

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.180 
so the black races human form is that of
a<00:02:21.240> man<00:02:21.480> named<00:02:21.930> Willie<00:02:22.260> Walker<00:02:22.650> who<00:02:23.010> was<00:02:23.160> a

a man named Willie Walker who was a

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.910 
a man named Willie Walker who was a
Vietnam<00:02:23.490> veteran<00:02:24.330> who<00:02:24.360> was<00:02:24.750> paralyzed<00:02:25.620> in

both legs

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.330 
both legs
eventually<00:02:27.900> dark<00:02:28.440> side<00:02:28.710> would<00:02:28.860> want<00:02:29.070> to<00:02:29.160> bring

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
eventually dark side would want to bring

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.940 
eventually dark side would want to bring
the<00:02:29.430> war<00:02:29.670> of<00:02:29.790> the<00:02:29.820> gods<00:02:30.120> to<00:02:30.570> earth<00:02:30.900> so<00:02:31.770> the

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
the war of the gods to earth so the

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.150 
the war of the gods to earth so the
source<00:02:32.310> chose<00:02:33.000> Willie<00:02:33.480> Walker<00:02:33.870> to<00:02:34.440> be<00:02:34.650> the<00:02:34.920> new

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
source chose Willie Walker to be the new

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
black racer the black racer uses a pair

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.370 
black racer the black racer uses a pair
of<00:02:38.340> skis<00:02:38.730> that<00:02:39.030> can<00:02:39.180> travel<00:02:39.420> at<00:02:39.720> the<00:02:39.900> speed<00:02:40.050> of

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
of skis that can travel at the speed of

of skis that can travel at the speed of

light and can deliver a stroke of death

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.010 
light and can deliver a stroke of death
think<00:02:44.400> of<00:02:44.490> the<00:02:44.580> skis<00:02:44.880> how<00:02:45.270> you<00:02:45.330> would<00:02:45.600> think<00:02:45.810> of

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
think of the skis how you would think of

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.560 
think of the skis how you would think of
the<00:02:46.500> silver<00:02:46.890> surfers<00:02:47.340> surfboard<00:02:48.150> which<00:02:48.420> is

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
the silver surfers surfboard which is

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.030 
the silver surfers surfboard which is
actually<00:02:48.990> a<00:02:49.020> good<00:02:49.260> point<00:02:49.530> to<00:02:49.650> bring<00:02:49.860> up

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
actually a good point to bring up

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.130 
actually a good point to bring up
because<00:02:50.640> both<00:02:50.850> of<00:02:51.030> these<00:02:51.120> characters<00:02:51.720> were

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
because both of these characters were

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.500 
because both of these characters were
created<00:02:52.740> by<00:02:53.040> Jack<00:02:53.340> Kirby<00:02:53.610> the<00:02:54.060> black<00:02:54.240> racer

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
created by Jack Kirby the black racer

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.210 
created by Jack Kirby the black racer
would<00:02:54.750> first<00:02:54.990> appear<00:02:55.200> in<00:02:55.590> new<00:02:55.770> God's<00:02:56.010> number

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.000 
would first appear in new God's number
three<00:02:56.520> in<00:02:56.900> 1971<00:02:57.900> there<00:02:58.350> are<00:02:58.530> few<00:02:58.740> appearances

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
three in 1971 there are few appearances

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.160 
three in 1971 there are few appearances
over<00:02:59.520> the<00:02:59.610> years<00:02:59.820> but<00:03:00.090> the<00:03:00.180> most<00:03:00.210> important<00:03:00.960> is

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
over the years but the most important is

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.340 
over the years but the most important is
probably<00:03:01.560> in<00:03:02.100> Final<00:03:02.550> Crisis<00:03:03.030> in<00:03:03.480> Final<00:03:03.960> Crisis

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
probably in Final Crisis in Final Crisis

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.130 
probably in Final Crisis in Final Crisis
the<00:03:04.560> black<00:03:04.740> racer<00:03:05.190> was<00:03:05.370> heavily<00:03:05.880> stylized<00:03:06.330> to

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
the black racer was heavily stylized to

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.290 
the black racer was heavily stylized to
give<00:03:07.290> the<00:03:07.410> feel<00:03:07.650> of<00:03:07.680> a<00:03:08.190> Black<00:03:08.580> Knight<00:03:08.610> as

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
give the feel of a Black Knight as

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.260 
give the feel of a Black Knight as
opposed<00:03:09.840> to<00:03:09.990> a<00:03:10.350> racer<00:03:10.980> of<00:03:11.160> skis<00:03:11.490> there's<00:03:12.150> also

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 
opposed to a racer of skis there's also

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.330 
opposed to a racer of skis there's also
a<00:03:12.420> saying<00:03:12.780> that<00:03:13.080> by<00:03:13.260> this<00:03:13.320> point<00:03:13.560> the<00:03:13.980> racer

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
a saying that by this point the racer

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:15.980 
a saying that by this point the racer
was<00:03:14.460> no<00:03:14.640> longer<00:03:14.820> connected<00:03:15.180> to<00:03:15.480> Willie<00:03:15.690> Walker

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:15.990 
was no longer connected to Willie Walker

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.230 
was no longer connected to Willie Walker
because<00:03:16.500> Willie<00:03:16.980> Walker<00:03:17.250> was<00:03:17.550> dead<00:03:17.850> by<00:03:18.180> this

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:18.240 
because Willie Walker was dead by this

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.510 
because Willie Walker was dead by this
point<00:03:18.780> so<00:03:19.350> the<00:03:19.440> black<00:03:19.650> racer<00:03:20.070> will<00:03:20.220> be<00:03:20.310> seen

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:20.520 
point so the black racer will be seen

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.970 
point so the black racer will be seen

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
instead of Barry and that's it really

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.330 
instead of Barry and that's it really

just think of a dark night of death on

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.940 
just think of a dark night of death on
skis<00:03:47.970> that<00:03:48.480> can<00:03:48.690> move<00:03:48.930> at<00:03:49.140> the<00:03:49.230> speed<00:03:49.410> of<00:03:49.710> light

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.310 
skis that can move at the speed of light
and<00:03:50.220> you<00:03:50.430> have<00:03:50.610> the<00:03:50.730> black<00:03:50.910> racer<00:03:51.180> he's<00:03:52.020> a<00:03:52.050> very

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
and you have the black racer he's a very

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.920 
and you have the black racer he's a very
interesting<00:03:52.740> concept<00:03:53.310> for<00:03:53.760> a<00:03:53.790> character<00:03:54.180> one
