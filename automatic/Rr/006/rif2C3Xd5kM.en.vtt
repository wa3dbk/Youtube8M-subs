00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:23.819 
then another vocal sample that's just

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:26.759 
then another vocal sample that's just
just<00:03:24.819> a<00:03:24.940> lot<00:03:25.090> of<00:03:25.239> stuttering<00:03:25.660> sounds<00:03:26.319> once<00:03:26.560> the

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:26.769 
just a lot of stuttering sounds once the

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:28.710 
just a lot of stuttering sounds once the
beat<00:03:26.950> gets<00:03:27.220> started<00:03:27.730> it's<00:03:27.970> it's<00:03:28.209> kind<00:03:28.600> of

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
beat gets started it's it's kind of

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.750 
beat gets started it's it's kind of
difficult<00:03:29.320> to<00:03:29.410> tell<00:03:29.650> where<00:03:29.890> it<00:03:29.920> begins<00:03:30.370> and

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
difficult to tell where it begins and

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.090 
difficult to tell where it begins and
where<00:03:31.000> it<00:03:31.030> ends<00:03:31.600> just<00:03:31.810> so<00:03:32.170> much<00:03:32.290> detail<00:03:32.650> goes

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100 
where it ends just so much detail goes

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:34.650 
where it ends just so much detail goes
into<00:03:33.370> this<00:03:33.489> beat<00:03:33.730> and<00:03:33.760> pretty<00:03:34.000> much<00:03:34.120> every

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
into this beat and pretty much every

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
something but I mean I think topically

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:38.850
