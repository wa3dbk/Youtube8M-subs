 internal 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.020

 the argentina 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:27.070

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:36.700
 tweets that are putting as the account 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:41.479
 regressive of the remaining days to 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:43.550
 give 10 15 in beating nothing I do not think so 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:45.940
 Quinn check in chelsea he created a boy 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:45.940
 20 years old 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:02:07.000
 but time does not regenerate if these 

00:01:53.929 --> 00:02:10.440
 guys are not successful better 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.440
 15 more or less 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:32.770
 and I'm going to add a data with respect to 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.420
 topic to dedicate what I'm talking about 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.760
 several sports journalists and I 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.260
 they said that regardless of this 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.380
 explosion that has to do with wanda 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.840
 nara before this they wanted to make him 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.580
 obviously interviews and only him 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.709
 I answered or the representative answered 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:51.190
 that he only did interviews by mail 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:55.390
 that is to speak to graphic media to be 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:57.310
 the middle working interviews 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.989
 sports that could not make a 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.360
 phone with him or an interview 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:04.030
 let's say with a camera that only 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:08.310
 he was driving by half good going back to 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.310
 barbican and everything he said 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.240
 and he said that the German does not sell the work 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:15.250
 who is obsessed with maradona and with 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:18.090
 what they tell him of the knowledge and that 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.090
 ernestina also 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:26.080
 all around a climate of peace and 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.280
 then they confess to me and the 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.020
 true that every time I look more like 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.030
 pamela david asking I'm here 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:33.400
 because people tell me it 's very 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.800
 incisive very pamela had a very role 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:39.390
 alright then people could be 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:41.709
 of closing well the doors of medical 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:46.290
 ironic 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:46.290
 I like American 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:04:03.010
 so that the important thing I do not imagine of 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.350
 another way but the important thing is that 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.720
 be healthy, what happens that does not 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:11.590
 I am healthy 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:13.830
 that's why we're going to make an invitation to 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.830
 Bank 

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:30.460
