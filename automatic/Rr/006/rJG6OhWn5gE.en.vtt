00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.599
 and greet everyone the one that 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.400
 I hope you are well 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:26.369
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:30.059
 very special corsican video a video of 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:32.340
 glitch on the dlc havok that comes from 

00:00:30.059 --> 00:00:35.640
 go out so there is very little time so 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.559
 on the map drift this little glitch between 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.989
 parentheses it's a spot absolutely 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:43.070
 huge on the drift map that you 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.360
 will have a view only 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.790
 beautiful on the hand on the map 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.190
 frankly business in private and and 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:52.110
 so first of all we'll go 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.000
 at a very very precise place on the map 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.829
 so I if you want to know the place 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.200
 accurate watch the death by the video 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:02.010
 so I will go near the market 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:04.379
 on a market hut so for 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.770
 can do a little stanzas jumps 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.719
 on an invisible edge so that's the 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.950
 part will start first of all i 

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:12.720
 also wanted to say that I had sent 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.170
 to this video where shell and 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.090
 community so I thank them heaven 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.880
 claude it would be nice to them 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.640
 So here we go so we are 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.650
 here in the market here's the map 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.229
 drift 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:30.119
 so here we go on the small 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.670
 building that I told you and we'll get 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.700
 to go there at the top of the cable car 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.080
 so I put some small information 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.390
 written if you have trouble following a 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.680
 little my commentry 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.420
 So here we start right away 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.310
 with a double jump on the ledge of the 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.479
 fir tree with my corpse yes because this 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.130
 that it is very very difficult 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.170
 then he makes you a leap forward 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.090
 act iv ex-aof at swimming and at the end 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.159
 do a double job is double dash this 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.490
 which will allow you to arrive on this step 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:58.180
 So 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:00.070
 on this light ends to the poles 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.320
 electric forgiveness so then he goes 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.780
 have to do a double jump and a 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.180
 double dash to the cabins of the 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:10.599
 cable car and redo double jump and 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.170
 a little h towards what holds the sons of the 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:14.200
 cable car 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:16.720
 and that's enjoy as I wanted to say ben 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.300
 here is the map frankly beautiful said 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.860
 if you have a perfect view of the map 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.840
 you can even jump on the cabin that 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.370
 just in front to have a view 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.970
 different from the map 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:31.239
 and here I hope this video 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:33.310
