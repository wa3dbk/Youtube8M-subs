00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
so my friend gave me his PSP along with

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.520 
so my friend gave me his PSP along with
two<00:02:34.890> games<00:02:35.130> seeing<00:02:36.090> you<00:02:36.360> can<00:02:36.570> see<00:02:36.959> here<00:02:37.200> it<00:02:37.380> is

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
two games seeing you can see here it is

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.920 
two games seeing you can see here it is
the<00:02:37.680> original<00:02:37.920> PSP<00:02:38.300> the<00:02:39.300> analog<00:02:39.630> sticks

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
the original PSP the analog sticks

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.690 
the original PSP the analog sticks
actually<00:02:40.320> off<00:02:40.500> but<00:02:40.980> tell<00:02:41.220> you<00:02:41.310> the<00:02:41.400> truth<00:02:41.610> I

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
actually off but tell you the truth I

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:42.830 
actually off but tell you the truth I
think<00:02:41.730> it's<00:02:41.940> actually<00:02:42.270> a<00:02:42.450> little<00:02:42.570> bit<00:02:42.750> more

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
think it's actually a little bit more

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.090 
think it's actually a little bit more
comfortable<00:02:43.260> without<00:02:43.500> it<00:02:43.709> so<00:02:43.860> I'm<00:02:43.920> not<00:02:43.980> really

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
comfortable without it so I'm not really

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.979 
comfortable without it so I'm not really
worried<00:02:44.370> about<00:02:44.400> that<00:02:44.670> other<00:02:44.880> than<00:02:45.690> that<00:02:45.870> it's

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
worried about that other than that it's

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:47.720 
worried about that other than that it's
in<00:02:46.080> great<00:02:46.200> condition<00:02:46.290> he<00:02:47.250> gave<00:02:47.430> it<00:02:47.520> to<00:02:47.550> me<00:02:47.640> for
