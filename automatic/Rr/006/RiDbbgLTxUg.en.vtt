is a tears 18th and 17th position with
Wigan<00:00:34.180> and<00:00:34.300> Sunderland<00:00:34.809> so<00:00:35.500> they're<00:00:36.460> pretty

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:36.760 
Wigan and Sunderland so they're pretty

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.000 
Wigan and Sunderland so they're pretty
much<00:00:36.969> down<00:00:37.239> it<00:00:37.510> kind<00:00:38.110> of<00:00:38.290> gone<00:00:38.530> for<00:00:38.770> that<00:00:38.860> of

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.010 
much down it kind of gone for that of

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.340 
much down it kind of gone for that of
that<00:00:39.580> kind<00:00:39.820> of<00:00:39.970> realization<00:00:40.930> that<00:00:41.050> they<00:00:41.200> are

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.350 
that kind of realization that they are

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.070 
that kind of realization that they are
pretty<00:00:41.680> much<00:00:41.860> gonna<00:00:42.430> be<00:00:42.520> relegated<00:00:43.080> they've

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:44.080 
pretty much gonna be relegated they've

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.800 
pretty much gonna be relegated they've
lost<00:00:44.320> the<00:00:44.560> last<00:00:44.590> six<00:00:45.070> matches<00:00:45.220> so<00:00:45.730> really<00:00:46.180> this

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:46.810 
lost the last six matches so really this

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:48.720 
lost the last six matches so really this
match<00:00:47.110> for<00:00:47.500> Liverpool<00:00:47.920> should<00:00:48.160> be<00:00:48.280> a<00:00:48.310> walkover

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:48.730 
match for Liverpool should be a walkover

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:50.610 
match for Liverpool should be a walkover
they<00:00:49.300> pretty<00:00:49.510> much<00:00:49.600> karma<00:00:50.200> to<00:00:50.290> do<00:00:50.380> anything

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:50.620 
they pretty much karma to do anything

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.410 
they pretty much karma to do anything
they'll<00:00:50.890> probably<00:00:51.130> battle<00:00:51.550> more<00:00:52.090> than<00:00:52.239> likely

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:52.420 
they'll probably battle more than likely

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.750 
they'll probably battle more than likely
they'll<00:00:52.810> want<00:00:52.989> to<00:00:53.079> try<00:00:53.320> but<00:00:53.950> I<00:00:54.010> really<00:00:54.610> it<00:00:54.730> is

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:54.760 
they'll want to try but I really it is

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.600 
they'll want to try but I really it is
pretty<00:00:55.450> much<00:00:55.660> near<00:00:56.110> impossible<00:00:56.890> and<00:00:57.130> they're

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:57.610 
pretty much near impossible and they're

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:59.550 
pretty much near impossible and they're
gonna<00:00:57.760> need<00:00:58.030> some<00:00:58.329> really<00:00:58.720> really<00:00:59.110> really

00:00:59.550 --> 00:00:59.560 
gonna need some really really really

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.889 
gonna need some really really really
magic<00:01:00.010> look<00:01:00.250> to<00:01:01.090> get<00:01:01.270> through<00:01:01.540> these<00:01:01.660> last

00:01:01.889 --> 00:01:01.899 
magic look to get through these last

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:03.720 
magic look to get through these last
couple<00:01:02.140> of<00:01:02.320> matches<00:01:02.440> and<00:01:02.800> actually<00:01:03.489> managed

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:03.730 
couple of matches and actually managed

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.690 
couple of matches and actually managed
to<00:01:03.790> win<00:01:04.059> but<00:01:04.869> Liverpool<00:01:05.320> they<00:01:06.130> could<00:01:06.340> be<00:01:06.460> fine

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:06.700 
to win but Liverpool they could be fine

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.510 
to win but Liverpool they could be fine
towards<00:01:07.329> maybe<00:01:07.600> the<00:01:07.979> Europa<00:01:08.979> League<00:01:09.009> spot

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
towards maybe the Europa League spot

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.090 
towards maybe the Europa League spot
maybe<00:01:09.700> get<00:01:10.060> into<00:01:10.270> fifth<00:01:10.540> and<00:01:10.749> they<00:01:11.409> aren't<00:01:11.590> 49

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 
maybe get into fifth and they aren't 49

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.270 
maybe get into fifth and they aren't 49
points<00:01:12.520> and<00:01:12.759> the<00:01:13.020> fifth<00:01:14.020> is<00:01:14.139> a<00:01:14.350> sling<00:01:14.619> with<00:01:14.740> 56

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
points and the fifth is a sling with 56

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.309 
points and the fifth is a sling with 56
so<00:01:15.520> again<00:01:16.149> quite<00:01:16.389> a<00:01:16.450> hard<00:01:16.689> challenge<00:01:16.929> that

00:01:17.309 --> 00:01:17.319 
so again quite a hard challenge that

00:01:17.319 --> 00:01:20.069 
so again quite a hard challenge that
need<00:01:17.530> a<00:01:17.729> Arsenal<00:01:18.729> to<00:01:18.909> to<00:01:19.299> lower<00:01:19.509> their<00:01:19.749> points

00:01:20.069 --> 00:01:20.079 
need a Arsenal to to lower their points

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:22.830 
need a Arsenal to to lower their points

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
prediction really is going to be

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.300 
prediction really is going to be
Liverpool<00:02:24.819> winning<00:02:25.319> red<00:02:26.319> in<00:02:26.470> there<00:02:26.950> just<00:02:27.099> not

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
Liverpool winning red in there just not

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.309 
Liverpool winning red in there just not
doing<00:02:27.580> it<00:02:27.640> for<00:02:27.700> me<00:02:27.910> they<00:02:28.090> they<00:02:28.390> get<00:02:28.989> a<00:02:29.019> couple

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 
doing it for me they they get a couple

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:30.690 
doing it for me they they get a couple
of<00:02:29.379> good<00:02:29.500> goals<00:02:29.739> but<00:02:30.010> then<00:02:30.129> they<00:02:30.280> just<00:02:30.489> can

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
of good goals but then they just can

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.690

that<00:02:33.910> they<00:02:34.209> must<00:02:34.590> have<00:02:35.590> a<00:02:35.650> kind<00:02:36.099> of<00:02:36.340> just<00:02:37.000> a<00:02:37.150> bit

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:37.299 
that they must have a kind of just a bit

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:38.580 
that they must have a kind of just a bit
