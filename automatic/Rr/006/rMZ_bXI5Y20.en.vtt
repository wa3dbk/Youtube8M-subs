you

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.070 

we<00:00:06.100> started<00:00:06.430> with<00:00:06.509> well<00:00:07.509> you<00:00:07.750> know<00:00:07.839> a<00:00:07.870> great

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:08.080 
we started with well you know a great

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.830 
we started with well you know a great
concept<00:00:08.559> from<00:00:08.920> why<00:00:09.340> in<00:00:09.400> our<00:00:09.580> San<00:00:10.330> Francisco

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:10.840 
concept from why in our San Francisco

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.790 
concept from why in our San Francisco
the<00:00:11.230> idea<00:00:11.440> there<00:00:11.620> was<00:00:11.799> student<00:00:12.400> athletes<00:00:12.760> were

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:13.800 
the idea there was student athletes were

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.080 
the idea there was student athletes were
under<00:00:14.800> construction<00:00:15.430> as<00:00:15.550> they<00:00:15.700> were<00:00:15.760> going

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:16.090 
under construction as they were going

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:18.689 
under construction as they were going
you<00:00:16.390> know<00:00:16.539> through<00:00:17.140> school<00:00:17.470> and<00:00:17.800> so<00:00:18.400> it

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:18.699 
you know through school and so it

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:21.419 
you know through school and so it
basically<00:00:18.820> goes<00:00:19.179> from<00:00:19.599> playing<00:00:20.529> field<00:00:20.890> to<00:00:21.339> the

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:21.429 
basically goes from playing field to the

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:25.499 
basically goes from playing field to the
class<00:00:21.669> 10<00:00:22.259> graduation<00:00:23.339> to<00:00:24.339> a<00:00:24.699> final<00:00:24.999> seed<00:00:25.300> in

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:25.509 
class 10 graduation to a final seed in

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:26.909 
class 10 graduation to a final seed in
which<00:00:25.689> you<00:00:26.050> know<00:00:26.079> the<00:00:26.259> construction<00:00:26.800> is

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:26.919 
which you know the construction is

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:28.439 
which you know the construction is
complete<00:00:27.339> in<00:00:27.579> student<00:00:27.970> interest<00:00:28.300> for

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:28.449 
complete in student interest for

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:31.229 
complete in student interest for

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:41.440 
for the overall piece because we didn't

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.790 
for the overall piece because we didn't
want<00:00:41.620> to<00:00:41.740> overwhelm<00:00:42.700> the<00:00:43.420> viewer<00:00:43.750> with<00:00:44.260> just

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:44.800 
want to overwhelm the viewer with just

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.260 
want to overwhelm the viewer with just
the<00:00:44.920> detail<00:00:45.280> of<00:00:45.310> the<00:00:45.580> visual<00:00:45.850> effects<00:00:46.150> we

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:46.270 
the detail of the visual effects we

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:47.400 
the detail of the visual effects we
wanted<00:00:46.480> to<00:00:46.510> make<00:00:46.630> sure<00:00:46.690> that<00:00:47.020> people<00:00:47.110> still

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:47.410 
wanted to make sure that people still

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:49.260 
wanted to make sure that people still
had<00:00:47.560> an<00:00:47.650> emotional<00:00:48.100> connection<00:00:48.250> to<00:00:48.790> each

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:49.270 
had an emotional connection to each

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:50.790 
had an emotional connection to each
student<00:00:49.480> with<00:00:49.930> every<00:00:50.260> one<00:00:50.620> of<00:00:50.710> our

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:50.800 
student with every one of our

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.200 
student with every one of our
construction<00:00:51.160> scenes<00:00:51.610> you<00:00:51.760> ran<00:00:51.910> in<00:00:52.060> the<00:00:52.150> same

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.210 
construction scenes you ran in the same

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.560 
construction scenes you ran in the same
optical<00:00:53.020> paradox<00:00:53.560> that's<00:00:53.740> what<00:00:53.860> we<00:00:54.010> sort<00:00:54.250> of

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
optical paradox that's what we sort of

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.390 
optical paradox that's what we sort of
wanted<00:00:55.570> to<00:00:55.690> get<00:00:55.870> super<00:00:56.200> close<00:00:56.560> to<00:00:56.590> objects<00:00:57.250> but

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:57.400 
wanted to get super close to objects but

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.130 
wanted to get super close to objects but
also<00:00:57.520> remain<00:00:58.030> wide<00:00:58.329> enough<00:00:58.660> to<00:00:58.870> where<00:00:59.020> we

00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.140 
also remain wide enough to where we

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.260 
also remain wide enough to where we
could<00:00:59.290> leave<00:00:59.440> space<00:00:59.800> for<00:00:59.829> our<00:01:00.460> for<00:01:01.240> our

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:01.270 
could leave space for our for our

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.300 
could leave space for our for our
construction<00:01:01.930> sites<00:01:02.170> so<00:01:02.620> what<00:01:02.980> that<00:01:03.100> meant

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:03.310 
construction sites so what that meant

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:06.660 
construction sites so what that meant
sometimes<00:01:03.790> was<00:01:04.170> sort<00:01:05.170> of<00:01:05.259> shooting<00:01:05.890> you<00:01:06.579> know

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:06.670 
sometimes was sort of shooting you know

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.219 
sometimes was sort of shooting you know
digging<00:01:06.880> into<00:01:07.150> the<00:01:07.299> baseball<00:01:07.720> field<00:01:07.960> for

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:08.229 
digging into the baseball field for

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:09.569 
digging into the baseball field for
instance<00:01:08.560> a<00:01:08.649> couple<00:01:08.920> of<00:01:09.009> feet<00:01:09.159> below<00:01:09.340> the

00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:09.579 
instance a couple of feet below the

00:01:09.579 --> 00:01:10.830 
instance a couple of feet below the
ground<00:01:09.609> so<00:01:09.999> the<00:01:10.090> camera<00:01:10.390> could<00:01:10.509> get<00:01:10.689> low

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
ground so the camera could get low

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.020 
ground so the camera could get low
enough<00:01:10.869> that<00:01:11.319> we<00:01:11.619> would<00:01:12.069> feel<00:01:12.249> like<00:01:12.520> we're<00:01:12.850> not

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.030 
enough that we would feel like we're not

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.300 
enough that we would feel like we're not
our<00:01:13.359> point<00:01:14.200> of<00:01:14.259> view<00:01:14.319> is<00:01:14.590> not<00:01:14.740> in<00:01:14.920> the<00:01:15.009> scale<00:01:15.249> of

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
our point of view is not in the scale of

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:16.980 
our point of view is not in the scale of
the<00:01:15.670> baseball<00:01:15.850> player<00:01:16.299> but<00:01:16.600> our<00:01:16.719> point<00:01:16.960> of

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
the baseball player but our point of

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:18.539 
the baseball player but our point of
view<00:01:17.049> is<00:01:17.259> in<00:01:17.649> the<00:01:17.799> scale<00:01:18.069> of<00:01:18.100> the<00:01:18.429> construction

workers<00:01:19.149> we<00:01:20.020> didn't<00:01:20.229> want<00:01:20.380> it<00:01:20.409> to<00:01:20.530> just<00:01:20.560> seemed

00:01:20.879 --> 00:01:20.889 
workers we didn't want it to just seemed

00:01:20.889 --> 00:01:22.679 
workers we didn't want it to just seemed
like<00:01:20.920> the<00:01:21.189> construction<00:01:21.969> pieces<00:01:22.119> were<00:01:22.450> toys

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:22.689 
like the construction pieces were toys

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:25.550 
like the construction pieces were toys
so<00:01:23.049> we<00:01:23.170> used<00:01:23.380> you<00:01:23.560> know<00:01:23.679> real<00:01:24.179> you<00:01:25.179> know<00:01:25.299> real

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
so we used you know real you know real

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.749 
so we used you know real you know real
people<00:01:26.560> in<00:01:26.710> the<00:01:26.829> construction<00:01:27.249> that<00:01:27.490> we<00:01:27.609> shot

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:27.759 
people in the construction that we shot

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:30.179 
people in the construction that we shot
against<00:01:28.030> green<00:01:28.240> screens<00:01:28.270> separately<00:01:29.189> you

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:30.189 
against green screens separately you

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:31.499 
against green screens separately you
know<00:01:30.340> we<00:01:30.520> use<00:01:30.639> a<00:01:30.670> lot<00:01:30.759> of<00:01:30.850> environment

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:31.509 
know we use a lot of environment

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:34.440 
know we use a lot of environment
environmental<00:01:32.109> elements<00:01:32.409> dust<00:01:33.159> and<00:01:33.490> smoke<00:01:33.759> to

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
environmental elements dust and smoke to

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.260 
environmental elements dust and smoke to
make<00:01:34.600> it<00:01:34.749> as<00:01:34.899> if<00:01:35.229> we<00:01:35.979> are<00:01:36.009> we<00:01:36.819> are<00:01:36.939> at<00:01:37.119> the

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
make it as if we are we are at the

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.410 
make it as if we are we are at the
construction<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:39.280> construction<00:01:39.420> workers

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
construction the construction workers

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.020 
construction the construction workers
scale<00:01:40.899> looking<00:01:41.799> up<00:01:42.009> at<00:01:42.189> this<00:01:42.310> monumental

scale looking up at this monumental

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:44.669 
scale looking up at this monumental
player<00:01:43.240> so<00:01:43.569> we<00:01:43.659> kind<00:01:43.840> of<00:01:43.869> knew<00:01:44.049> we<00:01:44.289> started<00:01:44.590> to

00:01:44.669 --> 00:01:44.679 
player so we kind of knew we started to

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:46.769 
player so we kind of knew we started to
lay<00:01:44.829> out<00:01:45.009> what<00:01:45.340> those<00:01:45.549> vehicles<00:01:46.299> were<00:01:46.630> going

00:01:46.769 --> 00:01:46.779 
lay out what those vehicles were going

00:01:46.779 --> 00:01:49.739 
lay out what those vehicles were going
to<00:01:46.840> be<00:01:47.039> in<00:01:48.039> our<00:01:48.249> rough<00:01:48.490> scenes<00:01:48.819> even<00:01:49.539> though<00:01:49.630> we

00:01:49.739 --> 00:01:49.749 
to be in our rough scenes even though we

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:51.029 
to be in our rough scenes even though we
hadn't<00:01:49.929> even<00:01:49.990> finished<00:01:50.200> the<00:01:50.409> edit<00:01:50.679> because<00:01:50.920> we

00:01:51.029 --> 00:01:51.039 
hadn't even finished the edit because we

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:52.709 
hadn't even finished the edit because we
knew<00:01:51.189> the<00:01:51.520> amount<00:01:51.759> of<00:01:51.819> detail<00:01:52.179> he<00:01:52.299> wanted<00:01:52.630> in

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:52.719 
knew the amount of detail he wanted in

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:53.999 
knew the amount of detail he wanted in
each<00:01:52.840> shot<00:01:53.109> was<00:01:53.289> going<00:01:53.409> to<00:01:53.499> be<00:01:53.560> a<00:01:53.590> challenge<00:01:53.829> to

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:54.009 
each shot was going to be a challenge to

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:57.209 
each shot was going to be a challenge to
achieve<00:01:54.459> in<00:01:54.939> our<00:01:55.209> time<00:01:55.450> frame<00:01:55.659> so<00:01:56.229> the<00:01:56.619> step

00:01:57.209 --> 00:01:57.219 
achieve in our time frame so the step

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:58.620 
achieve in our time frame so the step
after<00:01:57.639> kind<00:01:57.850> of<00:01:57.939> putting<00:01:58.209> the<00:01:58.329> basic

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
after kind of putting the basic

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.300 
after kind of putting the basic
animations<00:01:59.109> in<00:01:59.259> there<00:01:59.469> we're<00:01:59.619> sort<00:01:59.859> of<00:01:59.920> okay

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
animations in there we're sort of okay

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.059 
animations in there we're sort of okay
now<00:02:00.490> we<00:02:00.549> have<00:02:00.729> to<00:02:00.849> make<00:02:00.969> it<00:02:01.090> real<00:02:01.299> and<00:02:02.069> that

00:02:03.059 --> 00:02:03.069 
now we have to make it real and that

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:06.149 
now we have to make it real and that
became<00:02:03.579> the<00:02:03.999> bulk<00:02:04.450> of<00:02:04.659> our<00:02:04.749> work<00:02:04.810> in<00:02:05.349> moving

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159 
became the bulk of our work in moving

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:08.430 
became the bulk of our work in moving
forward<00:02:06.840> compositing<00:02:07.840> all<00:02:07.990> these<00:02:08.229> layers

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
forward compositing all these layers

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.559 
forward compositing all these layers
together<00:02:08.679> and<00:02:09.190> creating<00:02:10.119> enough<00:02:10.330> of<00:02:10.450> the

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 
together and creating enough of the

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:12.030 
together and creating enough of the
sense<00:02:10.750> of<00:02:10.840> environment<00:02:11.440> in<00:02:11.530> these<00:02:11.680> in<00:02:11.980> these

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
sense of environment in these in these

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.930 
sense of environment in these in these
each<00:02:12.730> of<00:02:12.940> these<00:02:13.030> construction<00:02:13.810> scenes<00:02:14.080> to

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
each of these construction scenes to

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.310 
each of these construction scenes to
bring<00:02:16.150> them<00:02:16.300> fully<00:02:16.570> to<00:02:16.780> life<00:02:16.990> and<00:02:17.200> that

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
bring them fully to life and that

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.490 
bring them fully to life and that
basically<00:02:17.890> was<00:02:18.510> almost<00:02:19.510> almost<00:02:20.020> half<00:02:20.320> the

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
basically was almost almost half the

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.470 
basically was almost almost half the
process<00:02:20.920> in<00:02:21.070> post<00:02:21.310> was<00:02:21.640> just<00:02:21.910> we<00:02:22.090> already<00:02:22.330> had

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
process in post was just we already had

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.330 
process in post was just we already had
the<00:02:22.570> stuff<00:02:22.810> model<00:02:23.230> we<00:02:23.830> already<00:02:24.070> had<00:02:24.220> the

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
the stuff model we already had the

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.100 
the stuff model we already had the
layers<00:02:24.550> that<00:02:24.760> we<00:02:24.880> needed<00:02:25.240> it<00:02:25.420> was<00:02:25.900> just

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
layers that we needed it was just

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.020 
layers that we needed it was just
fine-tuning<00:02:26.800> and<00:02:26.860> continuing<00:02:27.670> to<00:02:27.700> get<00:02:27.880> the

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
fine-tuning and continuing to get the

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:51.110 
fine-tuning and continuing to get the
animations<00:02:28.570> as<00:02:29.200> real<00:02:30.160> to<00:02:30.370> life<00:02:30.580> as<00:02:30.760> possible

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.949 

right<00:02:51.750> now<00:02:51.989> the<00:02:52.049> NCAA<00:02:53.040> is<00:02:53.069> building<00:02:53.549> over

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
right now the NCAA is building over

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:57.740 
right now the NCAA is building over
400,000<00:02:54.959> future<00:02:55.349> professionals

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
400,000 future professionals

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.320 
400,000 future professionals
and<00:02:57.900> most<00:02:58.500> of<00:02:58.680> us<00:02:58.830> will<00:02:59.340> go<00:02:59.460> pro<00:02:59.730> in<00:02:59.940> something

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
and most of us will go pro in something

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.940 
and most of us will go pro in something
other<00:03:00.540> than<00:03:00.870> sports

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950
