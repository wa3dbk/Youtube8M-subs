00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.650 
whole mod is based on keeping things
secret<00:00:19.590> from<00:00:20.490> other<00:00:20.760> players<00:00:21.090> if<00:00:21.420> it<00:00:21.570> is

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
secret from other players if it is

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.419 
secret from other players if it is
online<00:00:21.840> or<00:00:22.200> from<00:00:22.530> people<00:00:22.949> that<00:00:22.980> go<00:00:23.220> on<00:00:23.310> your

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
account so we'll start off by showing

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.560 
account so we'll start off by showing
you<00:00:25.769> this<00:00:25.920> first<00:00:26.160> block<00:00:26.490> which<00:00:26.820> is<00:00:27.029> called<00:00:27.300> the

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
you this first block which is called the

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.050 
you this first block which is called the
one-way<00:00:28.019> glass<00:00:28.050> I<00:00:28.800> find<00:00:29.490> this<00:00:29.640> pretty<00:00:29.820> cool

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
one-way glass I find this pretty cool

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.669 
one-way glass I find this pretty cool
because<00:00:30.179> it<00:00:30.449> seems<00:00:30.720> like<00:00:30.810> a<00:00:30.900> regular<00:00:31.199> window

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
because it seems like a regular window

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.580 
because it seems like a regular window
but<00:00:31.980> if<00:00:32.160> you<00:00:32.400> go<00:00:32.550> on<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:32.910> other<00:00:33.060> side<00:00:33.590> there's

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
but if you go on the other side there's

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:35.900 
but if you go on the other side there's
nothing<00:00:35.010> there<00:00:35.160> so<00:00:35.370> let's<00:00:35.580> just<00:00:35.730> say<00:00:35.790> if<00:00:35.880> you

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
nothing there so let's just say if you

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.430 
nothing there so let's just say if you
have<00:00:36.060> a<00:00:36.090> house<00:00:36.300> on<00:00:36.450> a<00:00:36.510> mountain<00:00:36.870> or<00:00:37.020> something

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
have a house on a mountain or something

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.810 
have a house on a mountain or something
and<00:00:37.620> you<00:00:37.770> don't<00:00:37.800> want<00:00:38.040> anyone<00:00:38.340> else<00:00:38.579> to<00:00:38.789> know

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
just like this so that actually

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.850 
just like this so that actually
activates<00:01:17.490> a<00:01:18.680> secret<00:01:19.680> trapdoor<00:01:20.780> which<00:01:21.860> is

actually<00:01:23.189> pretty<00:01:23.460> cool<00:01:23.579> because<00:01:23.700> you<00:01:23.909> just

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
actually pretty cool because you just

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.730 
actually pretty cool because you just
place<00:01:24.299> it<00:01:24.329> on<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.689> block<00:01:25.020> that<00:01:25.170> you<00:01:25.320> want<00:01:25.530> and

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
place it on the block that you want and

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.499 
place it on the block that you want and
it<00:01:25.829> will<00:01:25.920> camouflage<00:01:26.250> itself<00:01:26.939> with<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.210> block

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
it will camouflage itself with the block

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.260 
it will camouflage itself with the block
that<00:01:27.720> you<00:01:27.840> actually<00:01:28.020> want<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.439> use<00:01:28.500> and<00:01:29.270> here's

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
that you actually want to use and here's

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.039 
that you actually want to use and here's
the<00:01:30.570> secret<00:01:31.130> player<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:32.460> pressure<00:01:32.850> plate<00:01:33.049> the

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
the secret player and pressure plate the

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.359 
the secret player and pressure plate the
player<00:01:34.290> one<00:01:34.500> I<00:01:34.530> didn't<00:01:34.860> actually<00:01:34.950> use<00:01:35.130> because

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
player one I didn't actually use because

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.219 
player one I didn't actually use because
what<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.299> player<00:01:36.509> 1<00:01:36.720> does<00:01:36.899> is<00:01:37.079> that<00:01:37.170> it

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
what the player 1 does is that it

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.670 
what the player 1 does is that it
actually<00:01:37.470> only<00:01:37.860> activates<00:01:38.610> with<00:01:38.790> players<00:01:39.090> as

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680 
actually only activates with players as

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.499 
actually only activates with players as
with<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.890> pressure<00:01:41.159> plate<00:01:41.430> itself<00:01:41.970> it's<00:01:42.299> just

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
with the pressure plate itself it's just

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.300 
with the pressure plate itself it's just
you<00:01:42.600> can<00:01:42.750> throw<00:01:42.899> a<00:01:42.960> block<00:01:43.200> on<00:01:43.470> another<00:01:44.070> object

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
you can throw a block on another object

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.569 
you can throw a block on another object
on<00:01:44.640> it<00:01:44.790> and<00:01:44.939> it'll<00:01:45.119> open<00:01:45.329> up<00:01:46.070> so<00:01:47.070> here's<00:01:47.369> the

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
on it and it'll open up so here's the

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.399 
on it and it'll open up so here's the
ghost<00:01:47.850> block<00:01:48.119> which<00:01:48.299> I<00:01:48.420> find<00:01:48.600> also<00:01:49.020> pretty

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
ghost block which I find also pretty

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.490 
ghost block which I find also pretty
cool<00:01:49.680> and<00:01:50.009> this<00:01:50.610> one<00:01:50.850> it's<00:01:51.180> just<00:01:51.630> instead<00:01:52.409> of

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
cool and this one it's just instead of

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.139 
cool and this one it's just instead of
placing<00:01:52.680> a<00:01:52.890> door<00:01:53.130> or<00:01:53.280> anything<00:01:53.399> like<00:01:53.969> the

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
placing a door or anything like the

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.429 
placing a door or anything like the
secret<00:01:54.390> door<00:01:54.570> that<00:01:54.600> i'm<00:01:54.930> going<00:01:55.140> to<00:01:55.229> show<00:01:55.409> you
