00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
fix I guess is that the outside if you

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.860 
fix I guess is that the outside if you
look<00:03:52.080> through<00:03:52.320> the<00:03:53.030> dining<00:03:54.030> room<00:03:54.180> doors<00:03:54.600> I

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
guess right here it is still the outside

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.180 
guess right here it is still the outside
