the kinks was so perfect just outside of
LA<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.289> I<00:00:52.350> think<00:00:52.559> she's<00:00:52.680> gonna<00:00:52.800> be<00:00:52.949> able<00:00:53.039> to<00:00:53.129> do

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.070 

yeah<00:00:57.420> see<00:00:57.750> we<00:00:58.710> wanted<00:00:58.950> to<00:00:59.010> be<00:00:59.100> somewhat<00:00:59.550> near

yeah see we wanted to be somewhat near

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.420 
yeah see we wanted to be somewhat near
la<00:01:01.080> I<00:01:01.110> guess<00:01:01.380> because<00:01:01.560> we<00:01:01.860> know<00:01:01.980> we'll<00:01:02.130> be<00:01:02.160> up

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.250 
la I guess because we know we'll be up
here<00:01:02.700> a<00:01:02.730> lot<00:01:03.030> but<00:01:03.300> we<00:01:03.390> wanted<00:01:03.600> to<00:01:03.690> be<00:01:03.810> removed
