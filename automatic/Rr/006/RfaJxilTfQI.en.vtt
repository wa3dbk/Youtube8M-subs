realized<00:03:54.060> that<00:03:54.360> the<00:03:55.140> video<00:03:55.440> cut<00:03:55.680> off<00:03:55.800> or

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
realized that the video cut off or

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.460 
realized that the video cut off or
something<00:03:56.310> um<00:03:57.030> so<00:03:57.300> it's<00:03:57.480> two<00:03:57.720> days<00:03:57.900> after<00:03:58.440> I

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
something um so it's two days after I

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.220 
something um so it's two days after I
flat<00:03:59.069> ironed<00:03:59.489> it<00:03:59.670> and<00:03:59.880> it's<00:04:00.630> still<00:04:00.810> straight<00:04:01.200> I

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
flat ironed it and it's still straight I

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.540 
flat ironed it and it's still straight I
wrap<00:04:01.590> it<00:04:01.769> at<00:04:01.890> night<00:04:04.069> alternating<00:04:05.069> the<00:04:05.400> way

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:05.550 
wrap it at night alternating the way

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:08.720 
wrap it at night alternating the way
that<00:04:05.730> I<00:04:05.790> wrapped<00:04:06.090> it<00:04:06.239> so<00:04:06.480> that<00:04:06.750> my<00:04:07.550> hair<00:04:08.550> won't

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
that I wrapped it so that my hair won't

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.180 
that I wrapped it so that my hair won't
break<00:04:09.030> off<00:04:09.209> on<00:04:09.450> either<00:04:09.750> side<00:04:10.110> of<00:04:10.140> my<00:04:10.350> head<00:04:10.590> so<00:04:11.130> I

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
break off on either side of my head so I

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:12.740 
break off on either side of my head so I
found<00:04:11.430> that<00:04:11.580> when<00:04:11.730> you<00:04:11.850> wrap<00:04:12.030> it<00:04:12.239> on<00:04:12.269> one<00:04:12.540> side

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
found that when you wrap it on one side

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.110 
found that when you wrap it on one side
constantly<00:04:13.410> what's<00:04:13.950> the<00:04:14.310> one<00:04:14.760> side<00:04:14.970> that's

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
constantly what's the one side that's

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.300 
constantly what's the one side that's
being<00:04:15.330> pulled<00:04:15.600> over<00:04:15.750> this<00:04:16.049> way<00:04:16.320> it'll<00:04:16.859> break

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
being pulled over this way it'll break

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.849 
being pulled over this way it'll break
off<00:04:17.549> so<00:04:17.880> I<00:04:18.150> alternate<00:04:18.900> the<00:04:19.109> size<00:04:19.320> that<00:04:19.560> I<00:04:19.620> wrap

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
off so I alternate the size that I wrap

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:23.150 
off so I alternate the size that I wrap
it<00:04:19.889> so<00:04:20.280> that<00:04:21.030> it<00:04:21.209> doesn't<00:04:21.359> break<00:04:21.540> oh<00:04:22.019> I<00:04:22.740> put<00:04:23.070> it

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
it so that it doesn't break oh I put it

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.100 
it so that it doesn't break oh I put it
in<00:04:23.250> ponytail<00:04:23.700> today<00:04:23.970> I<00:04:24.150> worked<00:04:24.450> on<00:04:24.660> the<00:04:24.960> last

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
in ponytail today I worked on the last

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.620 
in ponytail today I worked on the last
two<00:04:25.350> days<00:04:25.380> and<00:04:25.560> wasn't<00:04:26.190> didn't<00:04:26.850> get<00:04:27.000> um<00:04:27.180> frizzy

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
two days and wasn't didn't get um frizzy

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.690 
two days and wasn't didn't get um frizzy
or<00:04:27.720> anything<00:04:27.930> and<00:04:28.200> it<00:04:28.260> was<00:04:28.350> really<00:04:28.530> hot<00:04:28.710> so<00:04:29.010> but

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:29.700 
or anything and it was really hot so but

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:32.240 
or anything and it was really hot so but
I<00:04:29.729> wasn't<00:04:29.910> exploding<00:04:30.360> here<00:04:31.070> just<00:04:32.070> what<00:04:32.190> it

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
I wasn't exploding here just what it

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.240 
I wasn't exploding here just what it
looks<00:04:32.400> like<00:04:32.490> I<00:04:32.669> said<00:04:32.820> the<00:04:32.880> ponytail<00:04:33.300> so<00:04:34.250> I'll

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
looks like I said the ponytail so I'll

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.230 
looks like I said the ponytail so I'll
just<00:04:35.430> take<00:04:35.610> that<00:04:35.790> down<00:04:35.850> to<00:04:36.479> show<00:04:36.870> you<00:04:36.930> guys

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 
just take that down to show you guys

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.610 
just take that down to show you guys
it's<00:04:39.240> pretty<00:04:39.450> much<00:04:39.540> the<00:04:39.780> same<00:04:39.810> it<00:04:40.260> looks<00:04:40.470> the

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 
it's pretty much the same it looks the

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.620 
it's pretty much the same it looks the
same<00:04:40.800> as<00:04:41.070> it<00:04:41.220> did<00:04:41.370> the<00:04:41.880> first<00:04:42.090> day<00:04:42.210> that<00:04:42.240> I<00:04:42.390> did

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
same as it did the first day that I did

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:50.480 
same as it did the first day that I did
it

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:54.170 

so<00:04:51.500> that's<00:04:52.500> how<00:04:52.650> it<00:04:52.830> comes<00:04:53.039> out<00:04:53.220> sometimes

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 
so that's how it comes out sometimes

00:04:54.180 --> 00:05:01.080 
so that's how it comes out sometimes
I'll<00:04:57.650> take<00:04:58.650> my<00:04:58.800> beans<00:04:59.069> out

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:01.090

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:06.000 
I'll take my beans out
down<00:05:01.930> or<00:05:02.919> sometimes<00:05:03.340> I<00:05:03.520> wear<00:05:03.699> headphones<00:05:05.010> like

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.010

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:12.270 
this one to keep it out of my face when
it's<00:05:08.530> hot<00:05:09.150> hot<00:05:10.150> hot<00:05:10.419> hot<00:05:10.889> just<00:05:11.889> push<00:05:12.100> it<00:05:12.250> back

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:14.169 
with that I usually like to wear my hair

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:17.730 
with that I usually like to wear my hair
like<00:05:14.229> this<00:05:14.760> anyway<00:05:15.870> because<00:05:16.870> it's<00:05:17.229> out<00:05:17.500> of<00:05:17.560> my

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:36.450 

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:39.900 

everything's<00:05:37.450> still<00:05:37.690> straight<00:05:38.020> so<00:05:38.760> it<00:05:39.760> came

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:39.910 
everything's still straight so it came

everything's still straight so it came
up<00:05:40.060> pretty<00:05:40.180> good<00:05:40.320> I'll<00:05:41.320> probably<00:05:41.590> do<00:05:42.010> a<00:05:42.220> braid

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:42.940 
up pretty good I'll probably do a braid

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:46.350 
up pretty good I'll probably do a braid
out<00:05:43.169> and<00:05:44.370> within<00:05:45.370> the<00:05:45.550> next<00:05:45.580> two<00:05:45.970> or<00:05:46.330> three

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:46.360 
out and within the next two or three

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.620 
out and within the next two or three
days<00:05:46.889> we'll<00:05:47.889> see<00:05:48.070> how<00:05:48.220> it<00:05:48.430> come<00:05:48.820> along<00:05:49.240> at<00:05:49.419> last

throughout the week and then that's

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.270 
throughout the week and then that's
probably<00:05:52.570> I'll<00:05:53.080> try<00:05:53.470> to<00:05:53.530> do<00:05:53.740> it<00:05:53.860> right<00:05:54.010> out<00:05:54.190> and

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:54.280 
probably I'll try to do it right out and

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.129 
probably I'll try to do it right out and
see<00:05:54.430> how<00:05:54.550> it<00:05:54.700> comes<00:05:54.789> out<00:05:55.000> and<00:05:55.389> I'll<00:05:55.990> definitely
