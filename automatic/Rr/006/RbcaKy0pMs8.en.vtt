00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:18.200
 There is something going on here 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:20.119
 and if down here on the satellites 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.250
 construction sites bustle prevails 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:23.599
 then the whole thing gets more exciting 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.340
 to look from above 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:28.540
 and that 's why I' ll go to the 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.540
 crane behind me 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.690
 I shut up ford I will have to 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.690
 first of all, equip properly 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.830
 they can not afford what they do not 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.180
 knew is the stuff you need 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:52.630
 Not at all to get on the phone 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.630
 climb 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.680
 that was quite exhausting this 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:08.080
 ascend and has my head for heights 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.119
 really put to the test everything has 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.509
 absolutely worth it as you behind them 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:13.740
 me 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:13.740
 a spectacular view 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.430
 in the east is the 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.500
 Construction site access via the construction sites 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.240
 staff and vehicles to the satellite 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.920
 reach 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.770
 the model east will be in the south 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.330
 area on the new terminal building 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.979
 satellites adapted and for one 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:40.560
 eventual second construction section 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:42.869
 Incidentally, the satellite is prepared 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.149
 almost 400 meters shorter than the terminal 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:49.619
 2 nevertheless there are more fingers 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:51.750
 positions namely 27 pieces of 46 meters 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.819
 High apron tower is in the satellites 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.450
 He is integrated throughout the whole 

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:58.679
 construction phase in operation even if the 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.060
 section really hard now 

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:02.250
 it's time to go back down to the 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.130
 depth to go up and there it goes 40 meters 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.640
 but behind it, that means down 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.640
 they all come
