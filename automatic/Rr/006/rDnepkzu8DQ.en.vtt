00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:08.930
 hi friends in this video les 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:11.330
 we will present the launch of a new 

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:13.519
 product of the chantilly brand where 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:16.189
 will know the recommendations uses 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:18.380
 suggestions and basic information for 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:21.380
 get the best result and performance 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:23.480
 of the cream to beat in siphon as 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.669
 basic information is important 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.800
 contemplate that they must stay in 

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:32.090
 Refrigeration between 2 and 6 degrees 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:34.850
 centigrade its expiration is 45 days to 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.890
 from its production date its 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:40.160
 Net content per piece is 2 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:43.030
 kilograms each box contains 4 pure 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.610
 pack of 2 kilograms each 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:48.489
 to be able to start with the process of use 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.700
 We use a half - liter siphon the 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:54.820
 which is composed of 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:57.320
 the container the lid 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:00.950
 yours 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:04.210
 cap for capsules and oxide capsules 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:07.600
 nitrous non- reusable 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:10.619
 As a first step we pour 400 milliliters 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.619
 of the product in the siphon 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:16.400
 and immediately we took the remaining 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.710
 our product to refrigerate one of the 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.600
 advantages of this product is that it counts 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.060
 with the perfect balance between sweetness and 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.820
 flavor but if you want to give it a 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.890
 Special flavor you can add 5% 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.659
 of natural syrup for beverages or 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.880
 any other flavor of those offered 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:34.009
 the brand from madrileña 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.070
 later we cover perfectly the 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:39.140
 siphon since by not doing so the gas can 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.540
 escape and cause the product to come out 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.390
 without consistency 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.370
 As next step place the capsule 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.640
 inside a small screw cap like 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:51.710
 this and joined to it turn the plug with 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.590
 the capsule in this way until it leaves 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.660
 to spin we'll hear when it bursts 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.990
 the seal of the capsule indicating 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:01.729
 that the gas is inside the siphon 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:04.180
 remember to close the lid perfectly 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:04.180
 of the siphon 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.270
 place the desired duya in the other 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:11.850
 extreme and subsequently shake 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:15.210
 vigorously siphon by at least 1 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:17.220
 minute this step is very important already 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:19.140
 that if not, the product will come out 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.720
 soft and will last less time with the 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.000
 adequate consistency in addition to that 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.940
 will consume more product and you will have a 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.280
 unpleasant appearance the contents of the 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:32.040
 siphon could end quickly after 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.930
 make several applications in case of 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.420
 that there is still product inside the siphon 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.750
 should be taken immediately to 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.580
 cooling for later downloads 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:44.870
 remember to shake it for at least a minute 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.870
 before each use 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:50.600
 this is the correct way to use 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:53.060
 our siphon vertically and mouth 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.670
 down since if we do it in a way 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:58.700
 inclined the gas escapes and our 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:01.190
 cream does not come out correctly 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.379
 the variety of foods and drinks in the 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:05.690
 that we can use our cream product 

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:07.910
 to beat in chantilly siphon for from 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.920
 the cold ones like malted frappés and 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:12.440
 hot ice creams like coffee 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:15.500
 American and express until desserts like 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.610
 the petit food breaks or the classic cocktail 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.380
 of fruit 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:21.510
 giving the touch of quality and flavor 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:23.400
 distinctive of the chantilly products 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.470
 It is worth mentioning that its color is 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.810
 slightly pearly and has the sweetness 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.269
 perfect besides that you get to get 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:33.000
 a better consistency higher performance 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:35.100
 and better price compared to other 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.040
 brands 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:40.110
 by not stirring properly the siphon leaves 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.030
 a loss in its consistency and 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:44.340
 comparing it to the siphon that was stirred 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.260
 for a minute vigorously you get 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.900
 better consistency and saving 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:51.120
 product since it has more gas which 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:54.320
 results in a better presentation and 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.320
 performance for the client 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:00.170
 do not forget our cream product 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:02.780
 to beat in chantilly siphon is very 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:06.580
 Useful for any place and occasion already 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.580
 which can be used in coffee shops 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:13.180

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.180
