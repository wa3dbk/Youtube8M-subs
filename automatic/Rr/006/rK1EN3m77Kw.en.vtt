that he made are fairly predictable I

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.970 
that he made are fairly predictable I
think<00:03:18.970> it's<00:03:19.150> something<00:03:19.450> that<00:03:19.900> he<00:03:20.470> may<00:03:20.650> feel

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.979 
think it's something that he may feel
but<00:03:21.250> it's<00:03:21.400> also<00:03:21.639> a<00:03:21.880> concerted<00:03:22.419> effort<00:03:22.690> to

but it's also a concerted effort to

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:25.470 
but it's also a concerted effort to
compete<00:03:23.650> to<00:03:23.950> appease<00:03:24.370> the<00:03:24.639> masses<00:03:24.669> to<00:03:25.269> some

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
compete to appease the masses to some

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.629 
degree which I'm finding relatively
