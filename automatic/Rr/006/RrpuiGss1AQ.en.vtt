00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 in this video I'll show you what 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.379
 you can do with the UFO you find in the 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.719
 map of gozzi then the new map 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:14.309
 tickle simulator then surely 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:18.300
 you will have seen that there is also a use in 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:20.460
 this new map is fine with the other map 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:24.710
 the UFO was brought here instead 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:27.590
 there is already found a crashed ufo already 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:31.289
 then in fact there is also the alien 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:34.829
 the alien is pretty dead enough 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:37.710
 see in you you can move it in fact I have 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.760
 maybe said this alien maybe 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:44.280
 I have to move and put in the center of the 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:46.350
 this ufo of this flying saucer 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.309
 I said maybe I try to move it try 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:53.280
 to do something with it but no there was nothing to do 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:56.520
 so and in the south cabbage i'm bringing it 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.460
 I don't know, I'm undermining it from all the 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.710
 parties then go well then then but yes 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.309
 ok then we thought maybe I should 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:09.210
 lick all the blue parts of the di 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:11.790
 this record because no but not 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.369
 I even had to do so bring the well 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.770
 being hathaway practically I have suffered 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:21.030
 thought you had to take a tool 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:23.790
 a wrench because I was 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.530
 wrong with I read wrong I thought 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:30.840
 tool the first time you want to read 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:33.689
 instead a tower powell the towel and 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.250
 so I thought I'd use a dowry bild 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.409
 glos builder 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.900
 in short, the minecraft goat dares that one 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.770
 who can build and then built 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:46.229
 one thing to go looking for a 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:49.170
 towel because now you see 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.270
 these on line or very practically two 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.979
 hours of video where I was looking for where 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.100
 could be a towel 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.840
 practically in for two hours of but then I have 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.829
 searched where this could be 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.780
 towel and I thought I saw that 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:06.450
 there was a part of the hotel that I didn't have 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.580
 still explored that this was it 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.819
 before I tried with fires 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:14.940
 see if I could glide 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:18.180
 here but I failed 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:21.629
 and then if failed to arrive then I have 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:25.370
 said island the guide two dates to do 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:29.160
 all the ladder to get there e 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:34.680
 meanwhile here is a golden goat if 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:37.920
 then plus there is the towel that a 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.420
 towel with written 42 that is that 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.480
 towel you need to bring 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:45.720
 the ship then why is this 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.579
 monkey hand with the inscription 42 because 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.880
 you have to take on a towel for 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:52.709
 then the spaceship here who knows the 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.910
 novel the galactic guide for 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:56.310
 hitchhikers 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.140
 or he saw the film that I like 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:01.319
 crazy 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:04.140
 It's a nonsense thing is a novel thing 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:05.569
 a demented comic thing about 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:09.510
 science fiction the galactic guide 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:11.340
 douglas adams hitchhikers must 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:14.130
 practically there is the character they say 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.889
 that you can't travel natural if that 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:21.780
 you do n't have a towel with you and then the 

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:23.850
 fact of 42 refers to the sense of the 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.989
 life that is asked of a mega 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:27.389
 computer 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:29.549
 what is the meaning of life what is there 

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:31.620
 in short, we are here to make sense of 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:33.600
 life and I'm better the computer processes 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.680
 for a lot of time then if instead in 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:39.500
 out this answer which is 42 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.819
 then anyway to by posizioniamo 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.920
 the towel then this all over 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:46.680
 a galactic guide quotation of 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:50.010
 hitchhikers in fact when we 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:52.370
 we bring the towel you will see that 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:57.120
 fall 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:04:01.379
 fish or fish shirt or gods 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:03.650
 mammals itc in short this strange ste 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:03.650
 things here 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:09.840
 however it is a situation 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:11.840
 if you are present there is this thing or 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.640
 thanks for all the fish that comes 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.620
 written both within the novel and 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.329
 then it is put as an initials it was 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.889
 also admitted as the theme song from driving 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:23.100
 galactic for hitchhikers 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:26.400
 thanks for all the fish is a motto of 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:30.180
 of this novel from three this is a 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:32.550
 absurd comic game very nonsense for 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.440
 certain things I would say this quote there 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:37.100
 compliments really well e 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.100
