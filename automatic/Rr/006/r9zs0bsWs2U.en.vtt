trainer there's also a test without
administrator<00:01:48.659> so<00:01:49.140> it's<00:01:49.320> not<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:50.159> spotlight

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
administrator so it's not the spotlight

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.149 
administrator so it's not the spotlight
will<00:01:51.060> not<00:01:51.180> just<00:01:51.420> be<00:01:51.540> on<00:01:51.780> me<00:01:51.930> as<00:01:52.140> a<00:01:52.170> test<00:01:52.530> you

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
will not just be on me as a test you

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.380 
will not just be on me as a test you
know<00:01:53.280> because<00:01:53.579> like<00:01:53.700> he<00:01:53.909> said<00:01:54.090> he<00:01:54.180> already

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
know because like he said he already

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.960 
know because like he said he already
said<00:01:54.780> they've<00:01:54.990> been<00:01:55.140> training<00:01:55.530> since<00:01:56.130> May<00:01:56.939> or

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 
said they've been training since May or

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.090 
said they've been training since May or
June<00:01:57.119> or<00:01:57.329> something<00:01:57.780> like<00:01:57.840> that<00:01:57.899> so<00:01:58.259> it's<00:01:58.979> a

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
June or something like that so it's a

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.210 
June or something like that so it's a
test<00:01:59.340> for<00:01:59.490> them<00:01:59.610> as<00:01:59.729> well<00:01:59.759> so<00:02:00.860> it's<00:02:01.860> a<00:02:01.979> test

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
test for them as well so it's a test

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.069 
test for them as well so it's a test
because<00:02:02.640> every<00:02:03.149> trainer<00:02:03.390> has<00:02:03.570> a<00:02:03.600> test<00:02:03.899> when<00:02:04.049> a

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
because every trainer has a test when a

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.160 
because every trainer has a test when a
fighter<00:02:04.350> fights<00:02:04.649> so<00:02:05.310> in<00:02:05.579> that<00:02:05.790> sense<00:02:06.090> yes<00:02:06.420> but

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
fighter fights so in that sense yes but

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.020 
fighter fights so in that sense yes but
in<00:02:07.380> some<00:02:07.649> ordinary<00:02:08.039> into<00:02:08.549> some<00:02:08.789> unexpected
