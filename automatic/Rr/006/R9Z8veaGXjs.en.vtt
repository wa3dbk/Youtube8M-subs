package that came from Nvidia to me
today<00:00:15.870> this<00:00:16.529> is<00:00:16.590> the<00:00:17.160> Nvidia<00:00:17.789> DIY<00:00:18.390> kit<00:00:18.750> for<00:00:19.140> the

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
today this is the Nvidia DIY kit for the

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.279 
today this is the Nvidia DIY kit for the
g-sync<00:00:19.890> upgrade<00:00:20.279> for<00:00:20.580> the<00:00:20.640> asus<00:00:21.330> v<00:00:21.600> g2<00:00:22.020> for<00:00:22.199> the

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
eq no 248 QE monitor so let's talk about

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.859 
eq no 248 QE monitor so let's talk about
them<00:00:26.490> on<00:00:26.550> real<00:00:26.760> quickly<00:00:26.939> so<00:00:27.180> this<00:00:27.300> monitor<00:00:27.720> is

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
them on real quickly so this monitor is

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.040 
them on real quickly so this monitor is
a<00:00:28.230> 3d<00:00:28.800> capable<00:00:29.250> so<00:00:29.490> it<00:00:29.609> has<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:30.029> nvidia<00:00:30.810> 3d

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
a 3d capable so it has the nvidia 3d

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.410 
a 3d capable so it has the nvidia 3d
vision<00:00:32.270> certification

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
vision certification

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.889 
vision certification
it<00:00:34.020> has<00:00:34.200> a<00:00:34.410> 144<00:00:35.309> hertz<00:00:35.790> refresh<00:00:36.149> rate<00:00:36.390> which

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
it has a 144 hertz refresh rate which

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.600 
it has a 144 hertz refresh rate which
can<00:00:36.989> go<00:00:37.110> down<00:00:37.260> 120<00:00:37.739> for<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.040> 3d<00:00:38.399> vision

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
can go down 120 for the 3d vision

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.170 
can go down 120 for the 3d vision
capabilities<00:00:39.329> and<00:00:39.950> it's<00:00:40.950> just<00:00:41.160> pretty<00:00:41.820> cool

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
capabilities and it's just pretty cool

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.430 
capabilities and it's just pretty cool
into<00:00:42.510> a<00:00:42.540> pretty<00:00:42.750> good<00:00:42.899> monitor<00:00:43.140> it's<00:00:43.260> really

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
into a pretty good monitor it's really

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.799 
into a pretty good monitor it's really
fast<00:00:43.770> i<00:00:44.129> already<00:00:44.940> played<00:00:45.180> around<00:00:45.390> with<00:00:45.480> it<00:00:45.600> a

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
fast i already played around with it a

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.869 
fast i already played around with it a
lot<00:00:46.140> so<00:00:46.649> it's<00:00:47.219> awesome<00:00:47.690> it's<00:00:48.690> 10<00:00:48.930> panels<00:00:49.410> so

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:49.879 
lot so it's awesome it's 10 panels so

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:52.420 
lot so it's awesome it's 10 panels so
color<00:00:50.879> quality<00:00:51.239> is<00:00:51.329> not<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.600> greatest<00:00:51.989> but

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
color quality is not the greatest but

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.310 
color quality is not the greatest but
the<00:00:53.430> video<00:00:53.640> is<00:00:53.760> all<00:00:53.850> about<00:00:53.879> g-sync<00:00:54.629> so<00:00:54.870> g-sync

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
the video is all about g-sync so g-sync

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.459 
the video is all about g-sync so g-sync
is<00:00:55.530> invidious<00:00:56.219> technology<00:00:57.000> to<00:00:57.300> allow<00:00:57.570> your

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
is invidious technology to allow your

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.770 
is invidious technology to allow your
graphics<00:00:59.160> card<00:00:59.340> to<00:00:59.460> communicate<00:01:00.210> directly<00:01:00.539> to

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
graphics card to communicate directly to

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.179 
graphics card to communicate directly to
your<00:01:01.079> monitor<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:01.559> support<00:01:02.160> things<00:01:02.520> like

00:01:04.179 --> 00:01:04.189 
your monitor and support things like

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:07.370 
your monitor and support things like
well<00:01:05.189> less<00:01:05.640> tearing<00:01:06.180> so<00:01:06.450> supporting<00:01:07.110> less

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
well less tearing so supporting less

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.070 
well less tearing so supporting less
tearing<00:01:07.979> it<00:01:08.820> also<00:01:08.970> helps<00:01:09.390> with<00:01:09.540> motion<00:01:10.049> blur

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
tearing it also helps with motion blur

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.080 
tearing it also helps with motion blur
because<00:01:10.619> apparently<00:01:11.430> this<00:01:11.610> would<00:01:11.820> be<00:01:11.909> some

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
because apparently this would be some

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.240 
because apparently this would be some
sort<00:01:12.210> of<00:01:12.299> upgrade<00:01:12.630> for<00:01:12.869> a<00:01:12.930> light<00:01:13.140> boost<00:01:13.439> here

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
sort of upgrade for a light boost here

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.499 
sort of upgrade for a light boost here
and<00:01:14.490> it's<00:01:14.640> gonna<00:01:14.760> be<00:01:14.850> its<00:01:14.970> own<00:01:15.210> little

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
and it's gonna be its own little

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.210 
and it's gonna be its own little
technology<00:01:15.869> so<00:01:16.320> we'll<00:01:16.590> talk<00:01:16.830> about<00:01:17.040> that<00:01:17.189> a

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
technology so we'll talk about that a

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.859 
technology so we'll talk about that a
bit<00:01:18.020> so<00:01:19.020> I<00:01:19.439> was<00:01:20.369> already<00:01:20.939> unboxed<00:01:21.299> like<00:01:21.659> once

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
bit so I was already unboxed like once

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.830 
bit so I was already unboxed like once
um<00:01:22.320> well<00:01:23.130> I<00:01:23.159> attempted<00:01:23.909> to<00:01:23.970> unbox<00:01:24.270> it<00:01:24.450> I<00:01:24.570> opened

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
um well I attempted to unbox it I opened

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.690 
um well I attempted to unbox it I opened
it<00:01:24.869> up<00:01:24.990> so<00:01:25.560> I<00:01:25.590> was<00:01:25.710> bit<00:01:25.890> disappointed<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:26.549> what

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
it up so I was bit disappointed and what

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.450 
it up so I was bit disappointed and what
I<00:01:26.729> actually<00:01:26.880> found<00:01:27.030> in<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.360> box<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:28.460> well

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
I actually found in the box and well

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.830 
I actually found in the box and well
we'll<00:01:29.610> see<00:01:29.759> why<00:01:29.880> so<00:01:30.090> in<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.479> box<00:01:30.659> which<00:01:30.810> is

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
we'll see why so in the box which is

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.960 
we'll see why so in the box which is
brown<00:01:31.110> boxes<00:01:31.500> g-sync<00:01:31.950> and<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.189> websites<00:01:32.729> on

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
brown boxes g-sync and the websites on

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.050 
brown boxes g-sync and the websites on
the<00:01:33.119> side<00:01:33.390> that's<00:01:33.720> all<00:01:33.869> there<00:01:34.079> is<00:01:34.140> on<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.350> box

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
the side that's all there is on the box

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.710 
the side that's all there is on the box
in<00:01:36.060> here<00:01:36.360> we<00:01:36.509> have<00:01:36.689> some<00:01:36.920> foam<00:01:37.920> soft<00:01:38.790> awesome

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
in here we have some foam soft awesome

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.530 
in here we have some foam soft awesome
and<00:01:40.259> here's<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.100> PCB<00:01:41.640> for<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.030> actual

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
and here's the PCB for the actual

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.050 
and here's the PCB for the actual
monitor<00:01:43.049> itself<00:01:43.890> which<00:01:44.340> is<00:01:44.520> is<00:01:44.790> a

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
monitor itself which is is a

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.030 
monitor itself which is is a
disappointment<00:01:45.689> already<00:01:46.020> and<00:01:46.860> I'm<00:01:46.950> gonna

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
disappointment already and I'm gonna

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.770 
disappointment already and I'm gonna
talk<00:01:47.159> about<00:01:47.189> that<00:01:47.579> in<00:01:47.970> just<00:01:48.210> a<00:01:48.360> moment<00:01:48.450> why

have<00:02:05.939> some<00:02:06.390> tools<00:02:06.780> and<00:02:07.140> brackets<00:02:07.770> and<00:02:08.039> I<00:02:08.099> mean

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
have some tools and brackets and I mean

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.680 
have some tools and brackets and I mean
who<00:02:08.399> has<00:02:08.610> and<00:02:09.149> what<00:02:09.300> not

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
who has and what not

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.840 
who has and what not
I'm<00:02:10.200> here<00:02:10.560> I<00:02:10.590> believe<00:02:10.830> this<00:02:10.979> Oh

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
I'm here I believe this Oh

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:13.490 
I'm here I believe this Oh
okay<00:02:12.120> now<00:02:12.270> what<00:02:12.390> this<00:02:12.480> is<00:02:12.630> for<00:02:12.780> this<00:02:13.260> is<00:02:13.380> to

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
okay now what this is for this is to

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.190 
okay now what this is for this is to
block<00:02:13.770> off<00:02:14.040> your<00:02:14.580> HDMI<00:02:15.180> and<00:02:15.420> dueling

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
block off your HDMI and dueling

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.730 
block off your HDMI and dueling
DisplayPort<00:02:16.980> a<00:02:17.180> dual<00:02:18.180> link<00:02:18.330> DVI<00:02:18.750> ports<00:02:19.230> on<00:02:19.380> the

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
DisplayPort a dual link DVI ports on the

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.740 
DisplayPort a dual link DVI ports on the
back<00:02:19.860> of<00:02:20.010> your<00:02:20.100> monitor<00:02:20.490> because<00:02:21.270> when<00:02:21.600> you

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
back of your monitor because when you

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.920 
back of your monitor because when you
install<00:02:22.080> this<00:02:22.290> you<00:02:22.770> lose<00:02:23.010> those<00:02:23.280> inputs<00:02:24.270> which

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
install this you lose those inputs which

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.180 
install this you lose those inputs which
is<00:02:25.050> awfully<00:02:25.440> disappointing<00:02:25.860> for<00:02:25.950> me<00:02:26.010> because

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
is awfully disappointing for me because

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.280 
is awfully disappointing for me because
I<00:02:26.250> just<00:02:26.280> bought<00:02:27.030> chromecast<00:02:27.660> to<00:02:27.900> work<00:02:28.140> with

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
I just bought chromecast to work with

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.570 
I just bought chromecast to work with
this<00:02:28.380> monitor<00:02:28.650> so<00:02:28.800> I<00:02:28.830> can<00:02:28.980> go<00:02:29.100> in<00:02:29.190> my<00:02:29.280> bed<00:02:29.430> and

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
this monitor so I can go in my bed and

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.850 
this monitor so I can go in my bed and
just<00:02:29.640> like<00:02:29.880> playing<00:02:30.210> on<00:02:30.810> my<00:02:31.050> phone<00:02:31.080> I'm<00:02:31.680> gonna

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
just like playing on my phone I'm gonna

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.470 
just like playing on my phone I'm gonna
lose<00:02:32.040> that<00:02:32.070> capability<00:02:32.730> we<00:02:32.820> hit<00:02:32.910> this<00:02:33.060> monitor

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
lose that capability we hit this monitor

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.690 
lose that capability we hit this monitor
now<00:02:36.440> yeah<00:02:37.440> that's<00:02:37.920> the<00:02:38.070> ready<00:02:38.250> disappointment

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
now yeah that's the ready disappointment

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.220 
now yeah that's the ready disappointment
and<00:02:38.820> here<00:02:38.940> you<00:02:39.030> have<00:02:39.180> a<00:02:39.210> power<00:02:39.480> brick<00:02:39.840> because

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
and here you have a power brick because

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.530 
and here you have a power brick because
in<00:02:40.770> here<00:02:41.070> there's<00:02:41.250> an<00:02:41.310> integrated<00:02:41.730> power

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
in here there's an integrated power

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.320 
in here there's an integrated power
supply<00:02:42.930> or<00:02:43.800> the<00:02:43.860> integrated<00:02:44.370> power<00:02:44.550> unit

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
supply or the integrated power unit

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.960 
supply or the integrated power unit
image<00:02:45.660> again<00:02:45.900> here<00:02:46.110> but<00:02:46.740> apparently<00:02:47.580> the

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
image again here but apparently the

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.470 
image again here but apparently the
juicing<00:02:48.300> module<00:02:48.660> doesn't<00:02:48.930> support<00:02:49.350> it<00:02:49.470> so

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
juicing module doesn't support it so

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:56.930 
juicing module doesn't support it so
yeah<00:02:52.760> okay<00:02:54.260> here<00:02:55.260> is<00:02:55.500> the<00:02:55.800> PCB<00:02:56.250> itself<00:02:56.340> so

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
yeah okay here is the PCB itself so

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.260 
yeah okay here is the PCB itself so
here's<00:02:57.210> a<00:02:57.300> PCB<00:02:57.870> for<00:02:58.770> the<00:02:58.860> entire<00:02:59.250> monitor<00:02:59.760> so

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
here's a PCB for the entire monitor so

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:01.550 
here's a PCB for the entire monitor so
you're<00:03:00.450> going<00:03:00.570> to<00:03:00.600> be<00:03:00.720> plugging<00:03:00.960> your<00:03:01.200> monitor

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
you're going to be plugging your monitor

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.740 
you're going to be plugging your monitor
you're<00:03:01.650> going<00:03:01.800> to<00:03:01.860> remove<00:03:02.130> the<00:03:02.280> PCB<00:03:02.550> then<00:03:03.390> you

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
you're going to remove the PCB then you

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.000 
you're going to remove the PCB then you
have<00:03:03.870> the<00:03:04.050> inputs<00:03:04.380> here<00:03:04.440> you<00:03:04.650> can<00:03:04.800> see<00:03:04.920> you

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
have the inputs here you can see you

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.000 
have the inputs here you can see you
have<00:03:05.070> DisplayPort<00:03:06.030> and<00:03:06.150> you<00:03:06.300> have<00:03:06.480> that<00:03:07.010> power

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
have DisplayPort and you have that power

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.700 
have DisplayPort and you have that power
supply<00:03:08.370> pinging<00:03:08.820> here<00:03:09.380> you're<00:03:10.380> gonna<00:03:10.530> be

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:10.710 
supply pinging here you're gonna be

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:12.740 
supply pinging here you're gonna be
losing<00:03:10.860> your<00:03:11.430> output<00:03:11.790> so<00:03:11.940> if<00:03:12.060> I<00:03:12.120> didn't<00:03:12.630> say

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
losing your output so if I didn't say

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.150 
losing your output so if I didn't say
that<00:03:12.870> already<00:03:12.990> you're<00:03:13.230> losing<00:03:13.470> dual<00:03:13.650> link<00:03:13.860> DVI

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
that already you're losing dual link DVI

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.990 
that already you're losing dual link DVI
and<00:03:14.490> you're<00:03:15.060> losing<00:03:15.240> HDMI<00:03:16.430> so<00:03:17.430> leave<00:03:17.970> that

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
and you're losing HDMI so leave that

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.150 
and you're losing HDMI so leave that
right<00:03:18.270> now<00:03:18.420> so<00:03:18.660> let's<00:03:19.140> open<00:03:19.200> this<00:03:19.500> up<00:03:19.650> and<00:03:19.710> see

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
right now so let's open this up and see

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.220 
right now so let's open this up and see
what<00:03:20.430> we<00:03:20.580> have<00:03:20.760> deserved<00:03:21.600> precautions<00:03:22.170> for

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
what we have deserved precautions for

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.810 
what we have deserved precautions for
handling<00:03:22.650> electrostatic<00:03:23.640> stuff<00:03:24.920> yeah<00:03:25.950> let's

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
handling electrostatic stuff yeah let's

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:30.710 
handling electrostatic stuff yeah let's
open<00:03:26.910> it<00:03:27.150> up<00:03:27.350> and<00:03:28.350> here<00:03:29.310> we<00:03:29.460> go<00:03:29.580> so<00:03:29.790> it's<00:03:30.180> a<00:03:30.240> PCB

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
open it up and here we go so it's a PCB

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.250 
open it up and here we go so it's a PCB
it's<00:03:31.350> very<00:03:31.560> simple<00:03:32.010> so<00:03:32.820> it<00:03:33.270> just<00:03:33.510> may<00:03:33.630> be<00:03:33.660> as

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
it's very simple so it just may be as

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:35.870 
it's very simple so it just may be as
flat<00:03:34.560> as<00:03:34.680> possible<00:03:34.710> so<00:03:35.340> you<00:03:35.430> could<00:03:35.580> tab<00:03:35.760> all

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
flat as possible so you could tab all

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:36.350 
flat as possible so you could tab all
your<00:03:36.000> stuff

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
your stuff

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.550 
your stuff
okay<00:03:37.200> so<00:03:37.500> on<00:03:37.860> the<00:03:38.040> bottom<00:03:38.190> here<00:03:38.490> you<00:03:38.520> have<00:03:38.910> your

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
okay so on the bottom here you have your

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.540 
okay so on the bottom here you have your
DisplayPort<00:03:40.560> and<00:03:40.680> you<00:03:41.370> have<00:03:41.520> your<00:03:41.670> power<00:03:41.850> in

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:43.550 
DisplayPort and you have your power in

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:48.530 
DisplayPort and you have your power in
that's<00:03:44.550> it<00:03:46.520> since<00:03:47.520> we're<00:03:47.670> paying<00:03:47.880> for<00:03:48.270> a<00:03:48.300> three

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
that's it since we're paying for a three

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.420 
that's it since we're paying for a three
hundred<00:03:48.630> dollar<00:03:48.930> monitor<00:03:49.530> I<00:03:49.770> would<00:03:50.340> have

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
hundred dollar monitor I would have

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.930 
hundred dollar monitor I would have
appreciated<00:03:50.790> if<00:03:51.660> I<00:03:52.440> know<00:03:52.710> it's<00:03:52.980> a<00:03:53.040> DIY<00:03:53.310> kit<00:03:53.490> now

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
appreciated if I know it's a DIY kit now

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.430 
appreciated if I know it's a DIY kit now
I'm<00:03:54.210> gonna<00:03:54.330> be<00:03:54.450> able<00:03:54.540> to<00:03:54.690> keep<00:03:54.810> the<00:03:54.990> peace<00:03:55.200> old

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
I'm gonna be able to keep the peace old

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.380 
I'm gonna be able to keep the peace old
PCB<00:03:55.950> but<00:03:56.610> I<00:03:56.640> would<00:03:56.850> have<00:03:56.970> liked<00:03:57.240> the

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
PCB but I would have liked the

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.090 
PCB but I would have liked the
opportunity<00:03:57.900> if<00:03:57.960> they<00:03:58.020> just<00:03:58.230> added<00:03:58.800> the<00:03:58.920> extra

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
opportunity if they just added the extra

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.660 
opportunity if they just added the extra
inputs<00:03:59.580> it'd<00:03:59.970> be<00:04:00.270> nice<00:04:00.540> but<00:04:01.350> I<00:04:01.620> see<00:04:02.160> where<00:04:02.370> they

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
inputs it'd be nice but I see where they

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:06.530 
inputs it'd be nice but I see where they
were<00:04:02.730> going<00:04:02.910> with<00:04:03.030> this<00:04:03.150> it<00:04:03.270> is<00:04:03.390> a<00:04:03.780> sample<00:04:05.540> and

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
were going with this it is a sample and

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.750 
were going with this it is a sample and
this<00:04:07.140> is<00:04:07.260> the<00:04:07.320> final<00:04:07.650> thing<00:04:08.160> I<00:04:08.370> don't<00:04:08.430> think

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
this is the final thing I don't think

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.790 
this is the final thing I don't think
people<00:04:09.000> are<00:04:09.120> gonna<00:04:09.240> want<00:04:09.750> to<00:04:09.930> buy<00:04:10.110> the<00:04:10.170> DIY

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:10.800 
people are gonna want to buy the DIY

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:16.370 
people are gonna want to buy the DIY
kits<00:04:11.100> so<00:04:12.060> that's<00:04:12.960> a<00:04:13.110> bit<00:04:13.230> iffy<00:04:14.120> so<00:04:15.230> here<00:04:16.230> is<00:04:16.350> a

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
kits so that's a bit iffy so here is a

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.960 
kits so that's a bit iffy so here is a
g-sync<00:04:16.739> module<00:04:17.130> so<00:04:18.170> has<00:04:19.170> a<00:04:19.200> heatsink<00:04:19.500> so<00:04:20.040> it

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
g-sync module so has a heatsink so it

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:22.850 
g-sync module so has a heatsink so it
has<00:04:21.270> to<00:04:21.390> be<00:04:21.510> as<00:04:22.080> have<00:04:22.320> a<00:04:22.350> process<00:04:22.770> to

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
has to be as have a process to

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.980 
has to be as have a process to
dynamically<00:04:23.340> get<00:04:23.760> the<00:04:23.940> input<00:04:24.300> and<00:04:24.510> translate

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
dynamically get the input and translate

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.680 
dynamically get the input and translate
it<00:04:25.110> to<00:04:25.140> the<00:04:25.229> display

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
it to the display

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:27.390 
it to the display
and<00:04:26.200> he<00:04:26.290> tunelessly<00:04:26.680> waiting<00:04:27.010> for<00:04:27.250> the

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
and he tunelessly waiting for the

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.220 
and he tunelessly waiting for the
graphics<00:04:27.730> card<00:04:27.910> to<00:04:28.030> send<00:04:28.330> it<00:04:28.480> information<00:04:29.080> so

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:29.230 
graphics card to send it information so

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:31.710 
graphics card to send it information so
it<00:04:29.350> does<00:04:29.860> need<00:04:30.040> a<00:04:30.070> heatsink<00:04:30.340> there<00:04:30.580> and<00:04:30.760> I

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 
it does need a heatsink there and I

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.330 
it does need a heatsink there and I
think<00:04:32.050> that's<00:04:32.200> it<00:04:32.470> so<00:04:32.770> we're<00:04:32.950> gonna<00:04:33.040> do<00:04:33.220> an

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
think that's it so we're gonna do an

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.130 
think that's it so we're gonna do an
installation<00:04:33.610> video<00:04:34.180> maybe<00:04:34.570> at<00:04:34.870> the<00:04:34.960> end<00:04:34.990> of

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:35.140 
installation video maybe at the end of

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:37.170 
installation video maybe at the end of
this<00:04:35.200> video<00:04:35.350> and<00:04:35.920> just<00:04:36.040> read<00:04:36.460> what's<00:04:36.850> gonna

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.180
