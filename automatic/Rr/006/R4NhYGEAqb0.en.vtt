00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
tree is now occurring in areas large

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.059 
tree is now occurring in areas large
enough<00:02:20.920> that<00:02:21.069> it's<00:02:21.190> actually<00:02:21.600> displacing<00:02:22.600> or

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
enough that it's actually displacing or

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.040 
enough that it's actually displacing or
removing<00:02:24.069> habitat<00:02:24.640> for<00:02:24.910> native<00:02:25.330> species<00:02:25.810> like

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
removing habitat for native species like

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.740 
removing habitat for native species like
the<00:02:26.560> lesser<00:02:26.769> prairie<00:02:27.069> chicken<00:02:27.489> so<00:02:28.420> as<00:02:28.569> simple

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
the lesser prairie chicken so as simple

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.449 
the lesser prairie chicken so as simple
and<00:02:29.200> funny<00:02:29.560> as<00:02:29.709> it<00:02:29.739> sounds

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
and funny as it sounds

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:33.150 
and funny as it sounds
prairie<00:02:31.209> chickens<00:02:31.720> are<00:02:31.930> Prairie<00:02:32.319> species<00:02:32.890> and

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
prairie chickens are Prairie species and

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.190 
prairie chickens are Prairie species and
so<00:02:34.230> plants<00:02:35.230> like<00:02:35.590> a<00:02:35.620> cedar<00:02:36.370> tree<00:02:37.080> represent<00:02:38.080> a

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
so plants like a cedar tree represent a

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.900 
so plants like a cedar tree represent a
habitat<00:02:38.680> that<00:02:38.860> the<00:02:38.980> bird<00:02:39.190> will<00:02:39.400> simply<00:02:39.760> not

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
habitat that the bird will simply not

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.509 
habitat that the bird will simply not
use<00:02:40.269> but<00:02:41.140> even<00:02:41.470> at<00:02:41.590> lower<00:02:41.799> densities<00:02:42.280> what

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 
use but even at lower densities what

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:43.979 
use but even at lower densities what
this<00:02:42.700> does<00:02:42.910> is<00:02:43.120> it<00:02:43.269> actually<00:02:43.600> provides

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
this does is it actually provides

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:46.440 
this does is it actually provides
predators<00:02:44.739> things<00:02:45.069> like<00:02:45.280> the<00:02:45.459> coyote<00:02:45.730> and<00:02:46.150> the

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
predators things like the coyote and the

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.570 
predators things like the coyote and the
hawk<00:02:46.690> it<00:02:46.900> provides<00:02:47.260> them<00:02:47.560> an<00:02:47.739> extra<00:02:48.310> advantage

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
hawk it provides them an extra advantage

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.539 
hawk it provides them an extra advantage
and<00:02:49.299> may<00:02:49.959> actually<00:02:50.200> increase<00:02:50.560> the<00:02:51.040> predation

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:51.549 
and may actually increase the predation

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:59.930 
and may actually increase the predation
rates<00:02:51.760> on<00:02:52.000> the<00:02:52.690> prairie<00:02:52.930> chicken

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.670 

so<00:03:00.940> the<00:03:01.120> wonderful<00:03:01.540> thing<00:03:01.780> that<00:03:02.110> happens<00:03:02.530> when

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
so the wonderful thing that happens when

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.589 
so the wonderful thing that happens when
you<00:03:02.709> remove<00:03:03.190> these<00:03:03.400> trees<00:03:03.790> as<00:03:04.090> we're<00:03:04.390> really

00:03:04.589 --> 00:03:04.599 
you remove these trees as we're really

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:06.960 
you remove these trees as we're really
returning<00:03:05.200> the<00:03:05.319> Prairie<00:03:05.709> to<00:03:06.190> its<00:03:06.430> historic

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
get along very good and the Cedars they

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.880 
get along very good and the Cedars they
also<00:03:14.069> use<00:03:15.120> groundwater<00:03:16.120> that<00:03:16.470> take<00:03:17.470> away<00:03:17.620> from

which it lives so far what we found is

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:51.410 
Delaware we've really done an aggressive

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:53.830

search<00:05:52.070> for<00:05:52.400> new<00:05:52.520> habitats<00:05:53.060> and<00:05:53.300> we<00:05:53.389> found<00:05:53.599> new

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:53.840 
search for new habitats and we found new

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.480 
search for new habitats and we found new
habitats<00:05:54.380> but<00:05:54.560> we're<00:05:54.710> not<00:05:54.860> finding<00:05:55.099> turtles

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:55.490 
habitats but we're not finding turtles

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:57.040 
habitats but we're not finding turtles
in<00:05:55.610> any<00:05:55.729> of<00:05:55.849> those<00:05:55.940> sites<00:05:56.180> so<00:05:56.690> that's<00:05:56.810> really

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:57.050 
in any of those sites so that's really

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:00.250 
in any of those sites so that's really
disappointing<00:05:57.940> turtles<00:05:58.940> today<00:05:59.389> we<00:06:00.110> don't

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:00.260 
disappointing turtles today we don't

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:01.300 
disappointing turtles today we don't
know<00:06:00.380> exactly<00:06:00.500> what<00:06:00.919> happened<00:06:01.190> to<00:06:01.220> those

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:01.310 
know exactly what happened to those

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:03.219 
know exactly what happened to those
populations<00:06:01.520> but<00:06:02.240> what's<00:06:02.539> happened<00:06:02.930> around

00:06:03.219 --> 00:06:03.229 
populations but what's happened around

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:04.240 
populations but what's happened around
those<00:06:03.500> is<00:06:03.680> there's<00:06:03.830> been<00:06:03.949> a<00:06:04.010> lot<00:06:04.160> of

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:04.250 
those is there's been a lot of

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:06.250 
those is there's been a lot of
development<00:06:04.789> when<00:06:05.539> you<00:06:05.630> put<00:06:05.810> in<00:06:05.960> something

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:06.260 
development when you put in something

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.350 
development when you put in something
like<00:06:06.410> a<00:06:06.500> whole<00:06:06.650> housing<00:06:07.190> development<00:06:07.789> that

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:08.360 
like a whole housing development that

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:10.300 
like a whole housing development that
changes<00:06:08.870> the<00:06:08.960> hydrology<00:06:09.620> of<00:06:09.650> the<00:06:09.740> whole<00:06:09.979> area

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:10.310 
changes the hydrology of the whole area

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:13.540 
changes the hydrology of the whole area
and<00:06:11.470> if<00:06:12.470> it<00:06:12.620> doesn't<00:06:12.800> actually<00:06:13.070> fill<00:06:13.430> the

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:13.550 
and if it doesn't actually fill the

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:15.820 
and if it doesn't actually fill the
wetland<00:06:13.880> itself<00:06:14.240> it<00:06:14.630> can<00:06:14.840> end<00:06:15.380> up<00:06:15.530> just

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:15.830 
wetland itself it can end up just

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:18.430 
wetland itself it can end up just
pulling<00:06:16.010> the<00:06:16.190> water<00:06:16.310> away<00:06:16.520> from<00:06:16.820> it

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:18.440 
pulling the water away from it

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.280 
pulling the water away from it
there<00:06:19.040> are<00:06:19.160> definitely<00:06:19.850> some<00:06:19.970> landowners<00:06:20.750> who

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:21.290 
there are definitely some landowners who

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:23.260 
there are definitely some landowners who
really<00:06:21.830> don't<00:06:22.070> want<00:06:22.400> endangered<00:06:22.850> species<00:06:23.030> on

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:23.270 
really don't want endangered species on

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:27.850 
really don't want endangered species on
their<00:06:23.360> property<00:06:25.360> there<00:06:26.360> is<00:06:26.390> a<00:06:26.840> lot<00:06:27.350> of<00:06:27.500> fear

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:27.860 
their property there is a lot of fear

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:29.860 
their property there is a lot of fear
surrounding<00:06:28.640> the<00:06:28.790> Endangered<00:06:29.240> Species<00:06:29.540> Act

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:31.960 
surrounding the Endangered Species Act
and<00:06:30.170> that's<00:06:30.740> one<00:06:31.040> of<00:06:31.070> the<00:06:31.250> things<00:06:31.490> we<00:06:31.640> wanted

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:31.970 
and that's one of the things we wanted

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:34.290 
and that's one of the things we wanted
to<00:06:32.030> overcome<00:06:32.600> with<00:06:33.050> that<00:06:33.230> to<00:06:33.500> change<00:06:33.710> it<00:06:33.980> from

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:34.300 
to overcome with that to change it from

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:37.900 
to overcome with that to change it from
confrontation<00:06:35.300> to<00:06:35.480> collaboration<00:06:36.730> so<00:06:37.730> if<00:06:37.790> we

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:37.910 
confrontation to collaboration so if we

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:39.760 
confrontation to collaboration so if we
control<00:06:38.300> the<00:06:38.450> vegetation<00:06:39.110> here<00:06:39.320> what<00:06:39.680> I'm

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:39.770 
control the vegetation here what I'm

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:42.040 
control the vegetation here what I'm
hoping<00:06:39.950> is<00:06:40.190> that<00:06:40.250> we<00:06:40.490> can<00:06:40.520> get<00:06:40.850> more<00:06:41.330> of<00:06:41.660> the

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:42.050 
hoping is that we can get more of the

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:44.020 
hoping is that we can get more of the

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:44.030 
open canopy areas where the turtles can

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:45.880 
open canopy areas where the turtles can
nest<00:06:44.300> and<00:06:44.570> hopefully<00:06:45.140> have<00:06:45.620> a<00:06:45.650> higher

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:45.890 
nest and hopefully have a higher

nest and hopefully have a higher
