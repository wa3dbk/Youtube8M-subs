00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
decline or incline it could actually

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.749 
decline or incline it could actually
take<00:01:03.870> off<00:01:04.050> so<00:01:04.680> just<00:01:04.920> from<00:01:04.979> a<00:01:05.100> safety<00:01:05.309> point<00:01:05.640> of

00:01:05.749 --> 00:01:05.759 
take off so just from a safety point of

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:07.069 
take off so just from a safety point of
view<00:01:05.820> so<00:01:06.119> first<00:01:06.390> thing<00:01:06.540> we<00:01:06.630> do<00:01:06.720> is<00:01:06.840> pull<00:01:07.020> the

00:01:07.069 --> 00:01:07.079 
view so first thing we do is pull the

00:01:07.079 --> 00:01:12.090 
view so first thing we do is pull the
brake<00:01:07.290> on<00:01:08.869> just<00:01:09.869> under<00:01:10.079> coupling

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 
brake on just under coupling

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.899 
brake on just under coupling
and<00:01:12.460> then<00:01:12.970> attach<00:01:13.480> the<00:01:13.690> jockey<00:01:13.900> wheel<00:01:14.170> to<00:01:14.909> the

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:15.909 
and then attach the jockey wheel to the

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:17.940 
and then attach the jockey wheel to the
trailer<00:01:16.300> and<00:01:16.450> then<00:01:16.960> once<00:01:17.590> we've<00:01:17.770> done<00:01:17.890> all

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
trailer and then once we've done all

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.850 
trailer and then once we've done all
that<00:01:18.100> we<00:01:18.250> can<00:01:18.760> actually<00:01:19.030> just<00:01:19.390> want<00:01:19.810> it<00:01:19.960> up<00:01:20.050> and

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
that we can actually just want it up and

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.410 
that we can actually just want it up and
that'll<00:01:21.130> actually<00:01:21.250> take<00:01:21.700> the<00:01:21.910> trailer<00:01:22.210> off

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
that'll actually take the trailer off

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
that'll actually take the trailer off
the<00:01:22.540> ball<00:01:22.750> of<00:01:22.870> the<00:01:22.960> car

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:23.440 
the ball of the car

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.790 
the ball of the car
unplug<00:01:24.190> the<00:01:24.340> electrics<00:01:25.090> off<00:01:25.210> the<00:01:25.330> car<00:01:25.800> and

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:26.800 
unplug the electrics off the car and

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.130 
unplug the electrics off the car and
then<00:01:27.220> that's<00:01:27.430> basically<00:01:27.850> it<00:01:28.119> the<00:01:28.720> next<00:01:28.960> main

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
then that's basically it the next main

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:30.960 
then that's basically it the next main
thing<00:01:29.410> is<00:01:29.560> to<00:01:29.590> actually<00:01:29.740> get<00:01:30.010> the<00:01:30.100> van<00:01:30.280> level

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:30.970 
thing is to actually get the van level

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.150 
thing is to actually get the van level
so<00:01:31.540> you<00:01:31.600> want<00:01:31.930> to<00:01:31.990> have<00:01:32.080> it<00:01:32.200> level<00:01:32.470> right<00:01:32.890> that

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:33.160 
so you want to have it level right that

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.540 
so you want to have it level right that
way<00:01:33.310> and<00:01:33.580> that<00:01:33.880> way<00:01:34.030> so<00:01:34.780> firstly<00:01:35.650> from<00:01:36.430> a

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:36.550 
way and that way so firstly from a

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:38.940 
way and that way so firstly from a
sweeping<00:01:37.030> perspective<00:01:37.780> you<00:01:38.530> don't<00:01:38.560> want<00:01:38.890> to

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
sweeping perspective you don't want to

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.150 
sweeping perspective you don't want to
be<00:01:39.040> rolling<00:01:39.820> either<00:01:40.030> way<00:01:40.350> and<00:01:41.350> also<00:01:41.710> the

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:42.160 
be rolling either way and also the

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.040 
be rolling either way and also the
fridge<00:01:42.430> that's<00:01:42.910> a<00:01:43.119> level<00:01:43.300> to<00:01:43.600> be<00:01:43.690> able<00:01:43.780> to<00:01:43.900> work

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:44.050 
fridge that's a level to be able to work

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.590 
fridge that's a level to be able to work
to<00:01:44.229> its<00:01:44.380> maximum<00:01:44.770> so<00:01:45.340> once<00:01:45.789> our<00:01:45.910> campus<00:01:46.360> level

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
to its maximum so once our campus level

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:47.850 
to its maximum so once our campus level
will<00:01:46.960> actually<00:01:47.229> know<00:01:47.380> to<00:01:47.440> put<00:01:47.619> down<00:01:47.770> the

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
will actually know to put down the

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.100 
will actually know to put down the
corner<00:01:48.190> steadies<00:01:48.520> which<00:01:49.360> will<00:01:49.479> help<00:01:49.600> keep<00:01:49.840> it

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
corner steadies which will help keep it

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.680 
corner steadies which will help keep it
steady<00:01:50.320> when<00:01:50.560> we're<00:01:50.710> walking<00:01:50.860> around<00:01:51.130> inside

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:51.690 
steady when we're walking around inside

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.560 
steady when we're walking around inside
you<00:01:52.690> simply<00:01:53.020> take<00:01:53.229> this<00:01:53.460> put<00:01:54.460> it<00:01:54.520> run<00:01:55.240> it<00:01:55.420> down

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 
you simply take this put it run it down

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.359 
you simply take this put it run it down
so<00:01:55.930> once<00:01:56.200> we<00:01:56.320> put<00:01:56.470> the<00:01:56.560> corner<00:01:56.860> cities<00:01:57.160> down

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369 
so once we put the corner cities down

00:01:57.369 --> 00:01:58.800 
so once we put the corner cities down
we're<00:01:57.520> going<00:01:57.610> to<00:01:57.670> put<00:01:57.820> the<00:01:57.910> roof<00:01:58.090> up<00:01:58.240> so<00:01:58.720> we

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
we're going to put the roof up so we

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.510 
we're going to put the roof up so we
need<00:01:58.960> to<00:01:59.050> worn<00:01:59.259> out<00:01:59.500> but<00:01:59.710> firstly<00:02:00.130> we<00:02:00.250> need<00:02:00.399> to

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
need to worn out but firstly we need to

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.430 
need to worn out but firstly we need to
actually<00:02:01.080> unhook<00:02:02.080> this<00:02:02.440> to<00:02:02.619> the<00:02:02.710> corner<00:02:04.440> what

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
actually unhook this to the corner what

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.990 
actually unhook this to the corner what
I'm<00:02:05.740> just<00:02:05.920> going<00:02:06.100> to<00:02:06.160> want<00:02:06.399> the<00:02:06.880> roof<00:02:07.090> up

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:17.980 

you<00:02:11.000> know

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:19.810 

ok<00:02:18.530> so<00:02:18.590> now<00:02:18.890> we've<00:02:19.070> got<00:02:19.190> the<00:02:19.280> roof<00:02:19.490> up<00:02:19.640> we're

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820 
ok so now we've got the roof up we're

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.300 
ok so now we've got the roof up we're
just<00:02:19.940> going<00:02:20.060> to<00:02:20.120> pull<00:02:20.300> beads<00:02:20.600> out<00:02:20.750> of<00:02:20.870> the<00:02:21.050> chin

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
just going to pull beads out of the chin

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.570 
just going to pull beads out of the chin
so<00:02:22.870> simply<00:02:23.870> come<00:02:24.050> out

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
so simply come out

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.740 
so simply come out
make<00:02:25.580> sure<00:02:25.730> there's<00:02:25.880> no<00:02:26.000> canvas<00:02:26.480> port

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
make sure there's no canvas port

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.300 
make sure there's no canvas port
anywhere<00:02:28.180> let's<00:02:29.180> pull<00:02:29.390> the<00:02:29.480> bed<00:02:29.630> out<00:02:30.100> it<00:02:31.100> feels

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
anywhere let's pull the bed out it feels

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.340 
anywhere let's pull the bed out it feels
like<00:02:31.520> it's<00:02:31.670> getting<00:02:31.910> caught<00:02:32.120> anywhere<00:02:32.600> just

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
like it's getting caught anywhere just

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.860 
like it's getting caught anywhere just
stop<00:02:33.680> and<00:02:34.430> make<00:02:34.610> fun<00:02:34.820> can't<00:02:35.120> exactly<00:02:35.510> lose

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
stop and make fun can't exactly lose

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.340 
stop and make fun can't exactly lose
otherwise<00:02:36.320> a<00:02:36.380> little<00:02:36.710> bit<00:02:37.120> so<00:02:38.200> actually<00:02:39.200> leave

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
otherwise a little bit so actually leave

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.170 
otherwise a little bit so actually leave
the<00:02:39.470> poles<00:02:39.740> in<00:02:39.950> the<00:02:40.040> NC<00:02:40.400> don't<00:02:40.640> go<00:02:40.880> chasing

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
the poles in the NC don't go chasing

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:47.230 
the poles in the NC don't go chasing
them<00:02:41.800> quite<00:02:42.800> as<00:02:42.920> simple<00:02:43.100> as<00:02:45.910> putting<00:02:46.910> that<00:02:47.090> in

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:47.240 
them quite as simple as putting that in

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.550 
them quite as simple as putting that in
there<00:02:47.390> get<00:02:47.960> your<00:02:48.020> solder<00:02:48.440> underneath<00:02:50.560> and

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
there get your solder underneath and

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:58.660 
there get your solder underneath and
putting<00:02:51.890> that<00:02:52.010> in<00:02:52.190> there

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:09.540 

on<00:02:59.670> the<00:02:59.849> other<00:02:59.940> side

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:09.550 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:12.430 

then<00:03:10.550> we<00:03:10.700> just<00:03:10.850> sit<00:03:11.060> sit<00:03:11.450> the<00:03:11.600> tip<00:03:11.840> over<00:03:12.320> there

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
then we just sit sit the tip over there

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.980 
then we just sit sit the tip over there
we<00:03:12.560> don't<00:03:12.590> build<00:03:12.920> up<00:03:13.280> yet<00:03:13.520> to<00:03:14.450> the<00:03:14.570> sign<00:03:14.780> on<00:03:14.810> the

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:14.990 
we don't build up yet to the sign on the

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:19.300 
we don't build up yet to the sign on the
other<00:03:15.080> end<00:03:16.570> so<00:03:17.570> I've<00:03:17.720> got<00:03:18.110> the<00:03:18.230> beds<00:03:18.440> pulled

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
other end so I've got the beds pulled

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.190 
other end so I've got the beds pulled
out<00:03:19.520> and<00:03:19.820> set<00:03:20.090> up<00:03:20.210> we<00:03:20.360> actually<00:03:20.420> walk<00:03:20.810> inside

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
out and set up we actually walk inside

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.800 
out and set up we actually walk inside
and<00:03:21.530> put<00:03:21.860> internal<00:03:22.400> clocks<00:03:22.640> and<00:03:22.940> as<00:03:23.360> I<00:03:23.420> said<00:03:23.720> we

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
and put internal clocks and as I said we

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.180 
and put internal clocks and as I said we
actually<00:03:23.900> leave<00:03:24.170> all<00:03:24.380> the<00:03:24.470> poles<00:03:24.710> underneath

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
actually leave all the poles underneath

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:30.040 
actually leave all the poles underneath
with<00:03:25.400> music<00:03:25.880> it<00:03:26.170> decides<00:03:27.170> hold<00:03:27.800> me<00:03:28.040> up<00:03:28.810> oops<00:03:29.810> if

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.050 
with music it decides hold me up oops if

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:31.900 
with music it decides hold me up oops if
we<00:03:30.170> put<00:03:30.350> in<00:03:30.470> there

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
we put in there

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:36.600 
we put in there
and<00:03:32.500> Stabler

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:36.610 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:39.760 

to<00:03:37.610> that<00:03:37.960> then<00:03:38.960> they'll<00:03:39.140> throw<00:03:39.290> that<00:03:39.500> down

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:39.770 
to that then they'll throw that down

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:41.800 
to that then they'll throw that down
next<00:03:40.190> we<00:03:40.310> actually<00:03:40.610> put<00:03:40.970> the<00:03:41.000> electrics<00:03:41.570> into

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
next we actually put the electrics into

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.540 
next we actually put the electrics into
the<00:03:41.900> roof<00:03:42.080> so<00:03:42.470> we<00:03:42.590> actually<00:03:42.680> isolate<00:03:43.340> that

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:43.550 
the roof so we actually isolate that

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:45.550 
the roof so we actually isolate that
from<00:03:43.700> a<00:03:43.790> safety<00:03:44.030> perspective<00:03:44.410> while<00:03:45.410> we're

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
from a safety perspective while we're

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:46.690 
from a safety perspective while we're
driving

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
driving

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.460 
driving
so<00:03:46.970> I'll<00:03:47.030> just<00:03:47.210> plug<00:03:47.420> that<00:03:47.450> in<00:03:47.810> and<00:03:48.170> that<00:03:48.410> will

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
so I'll just plug that in and that will

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.310 
so I'll just plug that in and that will
actually<00:03:48.800> set<00:03:49.130> the<00:03:49.430> roof<00:03:50.320> electricity

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:51.320 
actually set the roof electricity

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:58.450 
actually set the roof electricity
actually<00:03:53.530> put<00:03:54.530> the<00:03:54.620> bra<00:03:54.770> down<00:03:56.920> so<00:03:57.920> we<00:03:58.070> do<00:03:58.220> use

00:03:58.450 --> 00:03:58.460 
actually put the bra down so we do use

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:04.510 
actually put the bra down so we do use
is<00:03:58.670> take<00:03:58.880> the<00:03:59.000> weight<00:03:59.180> off<00:04:00.940> hold<00:04:01.940> that<00:04:02.120> it<00:04:03.520> move

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:04.520 
is take the weight off hold that it move

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.100 
is take the weight off hold that it move
it<00:04:04.670> down<00:04:04.880> so<00:04:04.910> it<00:04:05.270> actually<00:04:05.390> could<00:04:05.750> seem<00:04:05.990> to

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:06.110 
it down so it actually could seem to

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:14.650 
it down so it actually could seem to
that<00:04:06.290> oh<00:04:08.650> yeah

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:23.430 

also<00:04:15.230> I've<00:04:15.350> seen

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:29.410 

and<00:04:23.800> quick<00:04:24.010> days<00:04:24.660> and<00:04:25.660> then<00:04:25.780> we<00:04:25.870> have<00:04:26.020> a<00:04:26.050> duel

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:29.420 

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:34.890 

let's<00:04:29.810> tidy<00:04:30.020> it<00:04:30.230> up<00:04:30.290> so<00:04:31.510> don't<00:04:32.510> go<00:04:32.750> kick

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
let's tidy it up so don't go kick

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.200 
let's tidy it up so don't go kick
on<00:04:35.380> here

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:38.210 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:40.930 

yeah<00:04:38.930> and<00:04:39.800> then<00:04:39.920> we<00:04:39.980> go<00:04:40.100> outside<00:04:40.340> and<00:04:40.760> I'll

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:40.940 
yeah and then we go outside and I'll

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.150 
yeah and then we go outside and I'll
throw<00:04:41.180> up<00:04:41.360> around<00:04:41.660> the<00:04:41.840> beds<00:04:42.080> or<00:04:42.650> both<00:04:42.890> pins

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 
throw up around the beds or both pins

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.400 
throw up around the beds or both pins
and<00:04:43.850> then<00:04:44.030> we're<00:04:44.150> set<00:04:44.330> up<00:04:44.450> so<00:04:44.720> after<00:04:44.990> tidying

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:45.410 
and then we're set up so after tidying

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:48.280 
and then we're set up so after tidying
up<00:04:45.500> all<00:04:45.740> the<00:04:46.040> velcro<00:04:46.660> and<00:04:47.660> walking<00:04:47.990> around<00:04:48.050> the

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:48.290 
up all the velcro and walking around the

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:49.810 
up all the velcro and walking around the
coast

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:49.820 
coast
