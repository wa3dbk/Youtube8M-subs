 and that can stimulate the appetite in people 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:04.440
 that's why 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.650
 that most restaurants 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.650
 they have this color in their letters 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:13.110
 after its 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.350
 the company 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.640

 represents healthiness 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:21.120
 while 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.130
 it could be considered a little bit 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.150
 on the other hand it represents perseverance 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.520
 the simplicity 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:29.740

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.660
 as in chile 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.430
 fostering the qualities of trust and security 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:50.500
 often 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:51.770
 the brown color 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.990
 It is used to convey a product concept that does not fit 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.050
 that does not transmit diseases 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.360
 and that can be trusted 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:06.220
 Sometimes it replaces black when you want it offers a more sensation 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.219
 quality 

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:13.509
 this color connects us with tense and heavy feelings 

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:15.629
 the coffee 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:20.799
 can be used to create a good impression and that it is stable in the 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:23.129
 weather 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:25.249
 It is mainly associated 

00:02:25.249 --> 00:02:27.329
 to the states of monotony 

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:28.370
 tranquility 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.299
 and seriousness 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:31.619
 its a color 

00:02:31.619 --> 00:02:35.899
 viable mind smart if you adapt it properly 

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:37.619
 but above all 

00:02:37.619 --> 00:02:39.330
 It is a classic color 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.179
 old 

00:02:42.179 --> 00:02:43.289
 also 

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:45.020
 for the ancient Christians 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.099
 Cancer represents humility and service 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:49.180
 for this reason 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.700
 the religious were mostly 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.700
 this color in your wardrobe 

00:02:55.499 --> 00:02:59.999
 this color plus connects with tense and heavy feelings as we saw with 

00:02:59.999 --> 00:03:01.549
 anteriority 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:04.349
 why when we are sad 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:06.869
 or when we are depressed 

00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:09.049
 and we see a picture of this color 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:12.049
 we associate directly with this sense 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:16.009
 the use of coffee 

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:19.009
 It is also made to create a good impression 

00:03:21.429 --> 00:03:22.719
 older people 

00:03:22.719 --> 00:03:25.089
 like our grandparents 

00:03:25.089 --> 00:03:26.219
 teachers 

00:03:26.219 --> 00:03:27.739
 and some parents 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:32.039
 tend to prefer these colors and trends since coffee 

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:34.799
 also instills respect for people 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:37.799
 and is associated with the step 

00:03:39.339 --> 00:03:41.059
 the coffee the severe 

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:42.119
 male 

00:03:42.119 --> 00:03:43.719
 comfortable 

00:03:43.719 --> 00:03:47.069
 evokes the images neither 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:48.979
 leaves branches 

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:51.339
 trees and roots 

00:03:51.339 --> 00:03:52.899
 suggest commitment 

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:55.849
 responsibility and balance 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:57.859
 transmits objectivity 

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:02.019
 because intrinsically it remembers the earth that we tread because of its color 

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:06.229
 It is a very important color 

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:07.979
 symbolically speaking 

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:13.189
 in nature together with green because it is embedded in the processes of 

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:13.760
 lifetime 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.559
 various species 

00:04:16.559 --> 00:04:17.870

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.999
 it highlights its mailbox products associated with the greater public 

00:04:21.999 --> 00:04:24.080

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.210
 at a reasonable price 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:29.330
 coffee like other colors of its kind 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.080
 has an added value 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.520
 and it's perfect to highlight the quality suffered 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:35.800
 in chocolates 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.779
