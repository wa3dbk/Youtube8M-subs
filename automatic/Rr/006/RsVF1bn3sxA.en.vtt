00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.420
 What's up, people? 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:09.630
 bruno cabral who cindy and bringing to 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.610
 You are more like a video, how are you? 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.780
 can see the title the theme but the 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.610
 bright 3d 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.960
 only it is neither his name nor a 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.210
 tutorial is a video in which you are 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.890
 talking to you because the singer 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.160
 wanted to take some action within the 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.600
 tutorials on 3d videos and with you are 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.039
 the people that I wanted to help you 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.930
 are following the lessons are the most 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.340
 interested in this I would very much like to 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.439
 know your opinion because so I 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.420
 can take my actions so 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:38.579
 law are two very simple things and nothing 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:41.129
 quite the contrary I think it will help 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.140
 and you will help me're also good 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.820
 so the first time to talk with 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.820
 You are the fact you are thinking of doing. 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.440
 small videos of some ask to be able to 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.300
 explain to you the two that you 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.250
 They will have more applicants in the 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.170
 videos because I try to respond to them 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.750
 during tutorials only or are 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.820
 very small things that can collapse 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.550
 would it be to make a video of 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.729
 23 minutes and is answered doubt and 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.920
 Other things turn out to be a movie. 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.689
 It gets much more extensive video tutorial 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.150
 ends up getting much bigger because of it too 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.619
 to try to answer a certain doubt 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.979
 So you know that if you 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:19.259
 support the idea of going back doing so 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.439
 videos as you are not adult 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:25.290
 knew from 23 45 23 minutes at the most 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.670
 very short videos at most 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.150
 short videos answer only one 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.860
 doubt and I wanted to know the opinion of 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.329
 Do you guys agree with that? 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.990
 have some doubts prepared as per 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:39.119
 example put is the physics in the trees 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.040
 that you place when you create a 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.150
 many people asking this and now 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.390
 figured out we're doing this. 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.740
 cool is another doubt is also how 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.290
 make it rain at night 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.640
 it is a doubt trying to find an answer and 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.570
 I thinking that you will bring 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.939
 you 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.189
 But there are some that I'm not very 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.810
 able to respond as for example has 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.890
 a guy asked how to make rivers and 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.020
 oceans 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.420
 dude, this is a bit complicated because 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.630
 involves modeling if you know I'm not 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.580
 very good from there but depending on I can 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.610
 have like this account 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.990
 partners and where you know how to do is 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.870
 I do 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:17.330
 during a video in 3d one of these drops and 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.650
 I'm going to do it, I'll tell the guy the video. 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.270
 if you want to know how to make a river 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.580
 so that person made a video I'm going 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.620
 leave the link for you can access the 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.180
 jewel that I could not do or 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.710
 really asking for help from you is 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.940
 important also in these videos I will 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:32.060
 ask your help about things 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:34.460
 which I could not answer if I could 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.930
 make available help make available 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:39.140
 also the black channel announcing the 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:41.000
 video of this person joana and also 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.260
 make a friend a little of my 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.060
 Time more so, what are you doing? 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.010
 This type of video for you chooses which 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.750
 me too but will focus precisely on the 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.370
 life of several people fast you 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.770
 they will solve it here, they will be able to participate 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.390
 you play quietly and these 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:56.570
 questions when answering a separate project 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:58.670
 it's not going to be our 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:00.320
 their game on that side of the 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.790
 tutorials that I will not touch the 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.530
 to be able to make these little groups 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.270
 I'll create a new project, I'll leave it 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.930
 all set to ride just to respond to 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:08.150
 doubts 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.950
 so why do you want to know the opinion of 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.110
 You like the video format the 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.510
 dark is going to help or not is mine 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:17.000
 first question and the second question 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:19.310
 want to do you in relation to new 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.650
 unite versions because it is in the process of 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.610
 out version 4 during a stay 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.440
 beta version 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.630
 I recently had some people. 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.920
 asking if I 'm going to update if 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:30.350
 I will continue the project in the same version 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:33.470
 I'm if I'm not mistaken all 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:36.470
 using version 3.5 2 and already has the version 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:38.600
 3 with 54 or something like 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.400
 already released and so far does not update I 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:43.880
 I do not really like to authorize a project. 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:47.180
 while tinkering with it right then my 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:50.780
 The idea is to pass the oe of 4 after 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:53.330
 to achieve this is to delay the 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:55.459
 less than two months to think about 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:58.250
 start switching to it because you already have 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:04:01.370
 a lot of stuff done the night of this version 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.239
 3.5 2 and it may be that we move to 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.250
 the new version 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:05.810
 ends up giving several bugs and several things 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.850
 can work and I do not want this 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:09.100
 I want to finish the reasoning with you. 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:10.540
 then Czech 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.640
 in action the woman does anything 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.320
 that is a new project 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.550
 so my idea is not this but I 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:18.220
 I also want to know your opinion 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:21.790
 Do you mind keeping the version 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:23.980
 old g20 or if you want to rock 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:25.840
 last new version of ours I'll wait 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:28.000
 anyway it 's to wait at least 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.530
 two months to think about changing if you 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.640
 want to change a lot the last time 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:32.200
 people start a new project 

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:34.510
 regardless of the matter that I will 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.520
 until you stop to be able to avoid both 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:38.470
 happened in cash happened to the 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:41.230
 move from one version to another but there 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:43.000
 It will also depend on what you and 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:45.340
 I'm here to play and I'm here to 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.470
 Try to pass a little higher. 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:49.840
 knowledge for you and I need 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:51.490
 If you have this opinion you will not be able to 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.200
 a better way with the channel is to follow 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:54.490
 from now on a seventh of everything 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:57.160
 planned to have no surprises 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:59.320
 the front is a fun and everything the 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.670
 people made people lose ends 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.260
 disturbing you because you are going 

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:04.600
 also change the version 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:07.600
 Let's load the scripts and it will not go any further. 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:10.540
 To run then, I do not want to. 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:13.120
 I do not want to do with you with 12 heads 

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:15.310
 the idea of ​​learning now and I will have 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:17.920
 tries to put the version of the 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:19.630
 state.as 13 with 52 for download for 

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:21.970
 you leave the videos straight 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:24.940
 because you easier case some of 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:26.980
 you a lot of fun and want to go back to 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:28.870
 Olympic Games you can save up to 200 

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:30.670
 Patients can live perfectly well 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:32.950
 same tablet computer, I only know that you 

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:34.450
 were in classes in separate folders in the 

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:35.980
 installation time 

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:37.540
 Felipe continued, you want a 

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:39.490
 new piece is at the limit in that new 

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:42.220
