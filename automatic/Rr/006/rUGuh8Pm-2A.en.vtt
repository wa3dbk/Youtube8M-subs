the hardest set of em comes the first
set<00:00:17.670> and<00:00:17.820> there's<00:00:18.119> a<00:00:18.180> few<00:00:18.510> things<00:00:18.779> that<00:00:19.410> cause

the current state of the javelin the

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.019 
the current state of the javelin the
range<00:00:24.029> and<00:00:24.330> how<00:00:24.750> it<00:00:24.930> gives<00:00:25.140> you<00:00:25.230> a<00:00:25.260> critical

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:26.029 
range and how it gives you a critical

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:28.550 
range and how it gives you a critical
immobilization<00:00:27.029> where<00:00:27.210> you<00:00:27.330> can't<00:00:27.599> move<00:00:27.869> four

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
immobilization where you can't move four

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.179 
immobilization where you can't move four
five<00:00:28.830> six<00:00:29.310> or<00:00:29.580> seven<00:00:30.090> seconds<00:00:30.599> now<00:00:31.500> ApS

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
five six or seven seconds now ApS

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.770 
five six or seven seconds now ApS
doesn't<00:00:32.520> block<00:00:32.669> them<00:00:32.910> right<00:00:33.090> now<00:00:33.239> it<00:00:33.450> seems<00:00:33.600> to

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
doesn't block them right now it seems to

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.170 
doesn't block them right now it seems to
be<00:00:33.870> plugged<00:00:34.200> so<00:00:34.829> they<00:00:35.070> can<00:00:35.250> change<00:00:35.610> a<00:00:35.910> villein

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
be plugged so they can change a villein

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.580 
be plugged so they can change a villein
you<00:00:36.300> so<00:00:36.630> a<00:00:36.660> lot<00:00:36.870> of<00:00:36.899> times<00:00:37.140> you<00:00:37.290> can't<00:00:37.530> even

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
you so a lot of times you can't even

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:38.840 
you so a lot of times you can't even
make<00:00:37.890> it<00:00:38.010> up<00:00:38.129> to<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.340> front<00:00:38.460> of<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.670> carrier

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
make it up to the front of the carrier

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.959 
make it up to the front of the carrier
so<00:00:39.629> here's<00:00:39.960> what<00:00:40.140> I<00:00:40.170> traditionally<00:00:40.500> do<00:00:41.160> I'll

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
so here's what I traditionally do I'll

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.270 
so here's what I traditionally do I'll
sit<00:00:42.329> back<00:00:42.360> here<00:00:42.540> let<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.469> natural<00:00:43.710> flow<00:00:44.250> of

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
sit back here let the natural flow of

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.479 
sit back here let the natural flow of
the<00:00:44.460> waves<00:00:44.700> peak<00:00:45.510> and<00:00:45.780> drop<00:00:46.530> me<00:00:46.739> so<00:00:47.129> somebody

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
the waves peak and drop me so somebody

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.639 
the waves peak and drop me so somebody
does<00:00:47.700> get<00:00:47.910> a<00:00:47.940> lock<00:00:48.180> you're<00:00:49.050> gonna<00:00:49.140> notice<00:00:49.350> I

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
does get a lock you're gonna notice I

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.189 
does get a lock you're gonna notice I
pop<00:00:50.070> up<00:00:50.280> in<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.489> way<00:00:50.640> and<00:00:51.420> I<00:00:51.510> naturally<00:00:51.899> drop

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
pop up in the way and I naturally drop

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.260 
pop up in the way and I naturally drop
down<00:00:52.500> in<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.739> wave<00:00:52.920> so<00:00:53.579> it<00:00:53.730> takes<00:00:53.969> them<00:00:54.180> a

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
down in the wave so it takes them a

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.150 
down in the wave so it takes them a
second<00:00:54.629> to<00:00:54.690> have<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:55.050> obtain<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.770> lock<00:00:55.920> but

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
second to have to obtain the lock but

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.979 
second to have to obtain the lock but
then<00:00:56.280> they<00:00:56.370> must<00:00:56.520> keep<00:00:56.760> it<00:00:56.940> so<00:00:57.600> every<00:00:57.780> time<00:00:57.809> I

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
then they must keep it so every time I

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.290 
then they must keep it so every time I
drop<00:00:58.350> down<00:00:58.590> there<00:00:58.980> losing<00:00:59.190> lock<00:00:59.550> now<00:00:59.820> I<00:01:00.000> will

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
drop down there losing lock now I will

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.599 
drop down there losing lock now I will
move<00:01:00.480> up<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.930> whole<00:01:01.109> plan<00:01:01.410> is<00:01:01.440> do<00:01:02.160> some<00:01:02.399> damage

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
move up the whole plan is do some damage

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.060 
move up the whole plan is do some damage
up<00:01:03.180> close<00:01:03.570> because<00:01:03.750> i<00:01:03.930> am<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.320> mobile<00:01:04.799> spawn

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
up close because i am the mobile spawn

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.420 
up close because i am the mobile spawn
point<00:01:05.430> I'm<00:01:05.820> pretty<00:01:06.750> far<00:01:07.200> back<00:01:07.439> right<00:01:07.500> now<00:01:07.770> but

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
point I'm pretty far back right now but

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.429 
point I'm pretty far back right now but
again<00:01:08.520> with<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:08.970> way<00:01:09.090> ApS<00:01:09.630> works<00:01:09.960> and<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.320> way

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
again with the way ApS works and the way

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.140 
again with the way ApS works and the way
javelins<00:01:10.979> work<00:01:11.159> right<00:01:11.369> now<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.549> range<00:01:11.939> on

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
javelins work right now the range on

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.090 
javelins work right now the range on
them<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.750> critical<00:01:13.260> immobilization<00:01:13.979> well

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
them the critical immobilization well

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.280 
them the critical immobilization well
you<00:01:14.189> can't<00:01:14.460> move<00:01:14.700> you<00:01:14.850> can't<00:01:14.880> do<00:01:15.240> anything

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 
you can't move you can't do anything

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.020 
you can't move you can't do anything
even<00:01:16.290> if<00:01:16.350> you<00:01:16.470> got<00:01:16.619> 70<00:01:17.100> or<00:01:17.189> 80<00:01:17.340> health<00:01:17.580> left<00:01:17.850> and

even if you got 70 or 80 health left and

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.100 
even if you got 70 or 80 health left and
somebody's<00:01:18.330> preparing<00:01:18.750> you<00:01:18.840> you're<00:01:19.020> in

somebody's preparing you you're in

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.800 
somebody's preparing you you're in
trouble<00:01:19.259> so<00:01:20.070> I<00:01:20.400> had<00:01:20.759> to<00:01:20.790> pick<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:21.210> choose<00:01:21.420> when

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
trouble so I had to pick and choose when

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.600 
trouble so I had to pick and choose when
to<00:01:21.869> make<00:01:22.110> my<00:01:22.229> move<00:01:22.439> that<00:01:22.950> brings<00:01:23.130> me<00:01:23.220> to<00:01:23.490> my

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
to make my move that brings me to my

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.929 
to make my move that brings me to my
next<00:01:23.670> point<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.360> rib<00:01:25.040> try<00:01:26.040> not<00:01:26.250> to<00:01:26.310> beach<00:01:26.670> the

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
next point the rib try not to beach the

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.670 
next point the rib try not to beach the
red<00:01:27.119> number<00:01:27.360> once<00:01:27.540> a<00:01:27.689> mobile<00:01:27.990> spawn<00:01:28.229> point<00:01:28.530> if

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
red number once a mobile spawn point if

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.590 
red number once a mobile spawn point if
you<00:01:28.950> have<00:01:29.130> at<00:01:29.250> least<00:01:29.369> one<00:01:29.640> person<00:01:29.850> in<00:01:30.180> it<00:01:30.329> and

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
you have at least one person in it and

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.499 
you have at least one person in it and
if<00:01:31.170> you<00:01:31.290> give<00:01:31.470> it<00:01:31.590> to<00:01:31.619> them<00:01:31.890> it<00:01:32.310> will<00:01:32.520> shred<00:01:33.240> the

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
if you give it to them it will shred the

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.140 
if you give it to them it will shred the
transport<00:01:34.049> chopper<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.950> other<00:01:34.979> rib<00:01:35.549> and<00:01:35.970> of

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
transport chopper the other rib and of

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.020 
transport chopper the other rib and of
course<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.900> attack<00:01:37.229> mode<00:01:37.560> so<00:01:38.130> this<00:01:38.490> is<00:01:38.790> my

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
course the attack mode so this is my

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.469 
course the attack mode so this is my
secondary<00:01:39.509> position<00:01:40.110> this<00:01:40.770> entire<00:01:41.220> area<00:01:41.610> I'm

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
secondary position this entire area I'm

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:43.910 
secondary position this entire area I'm
going<00:01:42.540> to<00:01:42.689> be<00:01:42.750> treating<00:01:43.079> my<00:01:43.140> attack<00:01:43.470> mode<00:01:43.680> much

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920

of the wave the flow of the wave and
then<00:01:52.140> pull<00:01:52.409> back<00:01:52.439> when<00:01:52.890> I<00:01:52.920> need<00:01:53.130> cover

hopefully my Gunners are kind of paying
attention<00:01:56.189> to<00:01:56.549> my<00:01:56.700> flank<00:01:57.090> and<00:01:57.930> just<00:01:58.469> as<00:01:58.710> I

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
attention to my flank and just as I

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
think I'm getting in trouble I could

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.690 
think I'm getting in trouble I could
pull<00:02:00.930> for<00:02:01.200> remember<00:02:01.619> it's<00:02:01.770> very<00:02:02.100> slow<00:02:02.399> to<00:02:02.430> back

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
pull for remember it's very slow to back

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.070 
pull for remember it's very slow to back
up<00:02:02.909> it's<00:02:03.360> quick

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
up it's quick

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.530 
up it's quick
to<00:02:04.710> just<00:02:04.920> simply<00:02:05.370> slam<00:02:05.640> forward<00:02:06.030> so<00:02:06.150> sometimes

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
to just simply slam forward so sometimes

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.600 
to just simply slam forward so sometimes
the<00:02:06.930> wise<00:02:07.140> idea<00:02:07.410> is<00:02:07.740> sit<00:02:08.040> back<00:02:08.070> just<00:02:08.280> a<00:02:08.580> little

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
the wise idea is sit back just a little

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.639 
the wise idea is sit back just a little
bit<00:02:08.850> so<00:02:09.509> why<00:02:09.690> don't<00:02:09.899> I<00:02:10.020> Drive<00:02:10.080> around<00:02:10.440> the

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
bit so why don't I Drive around the

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.220 
bit so why don't I Drive around the
character<00:02:11.070> because<00:02:12.060> there<00:02:12.270> is<00:02:12.840> no<00:02:13.080> advantage

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
character because there is no advantage

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.950 
character because there is no advantage
to<00:02:13.770> me<00:02:14.040> doing<00:02:14.340> so<00:02:14.580> they<00:02:15.060> have<00:02:15.300> the<00:02:15.540> verticality

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
to me doing so they have the verticality

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.410 
to me doing so they have the verticality

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
a javelin but that's the other thing if

guess what it's going to hit above their
head<00:04:05.549> and<00:04:05.760> probably<00:04:06.090> kill<00:04:06.360> them<00:04:06.660> that's<00:04:07.410> a

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
head and probably kill them that's a

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:08.870 
head and probably kill them that's a
wonderful<00:04:07.680> thing<00:04:08.010> about<00:04:08.070> some<00:04:08.489> of<00:04:08.549> these<00:04:08.640> maps

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
wonderful thing about some of these maps

and<00:05:42.199> more<00:05:42.500> than<00:05:42.620> likely<00:05:42.680> to<00:05:43.099> transport

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:43.580 
and more than likely to transport

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:45.879 
and more than likely to transport
chopper<00:05:43.969> we<00:05:44.659> get<00:05:44.870> that<00:05:45.080> outcome<00:05:45.500> and<00:05:45.740> we

chopper we get that outcome and we

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:48.430 
chopper we get that outcome and we
actually<00:05:46.520> pull<00:05:47.030> out<00:05:47.210> to<00:05:47.389> be<00:05:47.539> as<00:05:47.810> always

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:48.440
