so it becomes like a bubble no matter

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:04.850 
so it becomes like a bubble no matter

there's people around or not once it

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.270 
there's people around or not once it
starts<00:01:12.270> it<00:01:12.810> starts<00:01:13.170> leading<00:01:13.380> you<00:01:13.650> and<00:01:13.920> once

you<00:01:14.370> start<00:01:14.520> trailing<00:01:14.850> it's<00:01:15.479> like<00:01:15.630> a

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:15.660 
you start trailing it's like a

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
you start trailing it's like a
high-pitched<00:01:16.020> frequency<00:01:16.110> you<00:01:16.500> can't

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
high-pitched frequency you can't

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.520 
high-pitched frequency you can't
actually<00:01:17.060> see<00:01:18.060> what<00:01:18.750> else<00:01:18.870> is<00:01:18.990> going<00:01:19.260> on<00:01:19.350> it

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
actually see what else is going on it

does<00:01:19.920> that<00:01:20.040> answer<00:01:20.160> the<00:01:20.250> question<00:01:20.420> it<00:01:21.420> does<00:01:21.660> so

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
does that answer the question it does so

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.350 
does that answer the question it does so
it's<00:01:22.200> in<00:01:22.800> a<00:01:23.160> way<00:01:23.280> like<00:01:23.610> you're<00:01:23.970> in<00:01:24.119> your<00:01:24.150> zone

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
it's in a way like you're in your zone

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.300 
it's in a way like you're in your zone
I've<00:01:25.080> made<00:01:25.259> a<00:01:25.290> few<00:01:25.470> drawings<00:01:25.680> a<00:01:25.860> few<00:01:26.009> days<00:01:26.130> ago

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
I've made a few drawings a few days ago

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.340 
I've made a few drawings a few days ago
and<00:01:26.640> then<00:01:27.180> it<00:01:27.270> was<00:01:27.390> kind<00:01:27.570> of<00:01:27.720> a<00:01:27.780> theme<00:01:27.990> op<00:01:28.140> that

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
and then it was kind of a theme op that

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.790 
and then it was kind of a theme op that
but<00:01:28.560> I<00:01:28.590> drew<00:01:29.550> this<00:01:30.479> on<00:01:30.720> here<00:01:30.900> in<00:01:30.990> fall<00:01:31.500> point

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:31.800 
but I drew this on here in fall point

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.940 
but I drew this on here in fall point
and<00:01:32.130> then<00:01:32.640> when<00:01:33.210> it's<00:01:33.360> unpolished<00:01:34.140> it

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
and then when it's unpolished it

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.670 
and then when it's unpolished it
actually<00:01:35.399> looks<00:01:36.090> great<00:01:36.360> and<00:01:36.570> it<00:01:36.899> changes<00:01:37.350> art

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
actually looks great and it changes art

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.560 
actually looks great and it changes art
changes<00:01:38.130> with<00:01:38.340> what<00:01:38.910> happens<00:01:39.180> in<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.390> world

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
changes with what happens in the world

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.540 
changes with what happens in the world
so<00:01:39.840> does<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.110> energy<00:01:40.259> of<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.740> crowd<00:01:40.979> affect

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:41.550 
so does the energy of the crowd affect

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:43.430 
so does the energy of the crowd affect

concrete to the place and so sometimes

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.590 
concrete to the place and so sometimes
it<00:02:13.799> can<00:02:13.860> take<00:02:14.070> forever<00:02:14.340> and<00:02:14.610> then<00:02:15.060> sometimes

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
it can take forever and then sometimes

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.110 
it can take forever and then sometimes
you'll<00:02:16.200> work<00:02:16.440> on<00:02:16.620> something<00:02:16.860> from<00:02:17.130> for<00:02:17.610> a<00:02:17.640> few

you'll work on something from for a few
weeks<00:02:18.299> and<00:02:18.690> as<00:02:19.170> well<00:02:19.380> as<00:02:19.470> other<00:02:19.650> things<00:02:19.739> for

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
weeks and as well as other things for

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.100 
weeks and as well as other things for
like<00:02:20.250> 60<00:02:20.580> 70<00:02:20.760> hours<00:02:21.330> a<00:02:21.420> week<00:02:21.510> and<00:02:21.870> then<00:02:21.989> you'll

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
like 60 70 hours a week and then you'll

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.830 
like 60 70 hours a week and then you'll
just<00:02:22.430> paint<00:02:23.430> over<00:02:23.790> them<00:02:23.850> so<00:02:24.120> this<00:02:24.239> is<00:02:24.299> a<00:02:24.420> larger

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
just paint over them so this is a larger

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.080 
just paint over them so this is a larger
piece<00:02:24.989> that<00:02:25.230> was<00:02:25.320> cut<00:02:25.500> down<00:02:25.709> from<00:02:26.040> a<00:02:26.160> from<00:02:27.060> a

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
than painting and the larger you paint

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.440 
than painting and the larger you paint
the<00:03:16.740> more<00:03:17.100> you<00:03:17.220> can<00:03:17.370> move<00:03:17.760> around<00:03:17.940> if<00:03:18.210> you<00:03:18.300> try
