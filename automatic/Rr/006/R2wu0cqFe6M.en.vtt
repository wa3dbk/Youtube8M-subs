00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:14.910
 within this topic we also talk about 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:18.150
 the posts in particular there are different 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.669
 posts but mainly the one that there 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.000
 to cover first has to do with the 

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:26.360
 quality of the food that is the chef or 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.460
 cook I was telling you that there's basically 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:32.910
 three types or four we could say 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:36.180
 four types of chefs or chefs in a 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.040
 restaurant there are the executive chefs that 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.350
 are those chefs who supervise 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.929
 other chefs this is when you have a 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.489
 very large restaurant and that you have 

00:00:42.929 --> 00:00:47.449
 an operation of the best about ten or 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.370
 fifteen people inside the kitchen 

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:52.829
 we need an executive chef 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.449
 that directs the entire operation who is going to 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.050
 be the appetizers who will do the 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:00.359
 soups who makes the broths who does 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:05.040
 the meat et cetera etcetera then comes 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:07.260
 a normal chef who supervises 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.990
 normally that the operations of the 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:13.440
 kitchen and the quality of the food design 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.670
 the menus etc. then comes the 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.799
 chef 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.900
 normally he is given a recipe he is given 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.479
 a slogan and they have to 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:25.710
 directly cook and produce always 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:28.350
 the same quality of food and finally 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.240
 there are some line chefs and these 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.670
 line chefs are those who 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.649
 prepare only meat or prepare 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:39.480
 only snacks or only 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:42.600
 cocktails or only drinks 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:45.060
 I would be a very specialized cook and 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.450
 hence it is important that they know the 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.090
 recipes that handle them well and that they know 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.350
 exactly what they are doing 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.140
 then that would be four types 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.380
 fundamentals of chefs 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.729
 what are some of the 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.430
 specifications that these should have 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.869
 posts to start hygiene have 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.780
 that be people that when you 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.179
 interview 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.789
 have a lot of hygiene before preparing 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.920
 the food you wash well and after 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:16.160
 prepare the food that has everything in 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:18.740
 order you hire a person 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.980
 that is not hygienic is going to have to be 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:24.250
 correcting the hygiene at every time every 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.530
 five minutes 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.650
 it also has to be the chef or the 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.060
 cook someone who planted the menu 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:34.180
 when we talk about menu planning 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.860
 it's breakfast lunch and dinner for example 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.720
 let's give an example of a restaurant 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.060
 which will serve breakfast lunch and dinner 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.070
 the first thing that has to be planned is 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.800
 that now that you hug her breakfast 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:46.840
 what time is the time for food and for 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.750
 what time what time is dinner out we go 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.580
 to assume that breakfast is given from 7 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:55.090
 the morning 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:57.700
 11 of the day then to plan that 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:00.010
 we should see that we will serve 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:03.100
 breakfast and what time are we going to start the 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:06.160
 preparation that we are going to prepare and that 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:08.590
 he prepares first second third of 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.810
 this way we're going to have the menu what 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.960
 We are serving at the right time 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:16.570
 and then maybe at eleven and 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:19.000
 we change everything from breakfast service to 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:22.970
 food service and then we plan 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:26.540
 and all the service how it's going to be 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:29.300
 if a chef a chef does not have that 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.640
 experience is going to have a little bit of 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:34.130
 lag customers are not going to have their 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:36.950
 food sometimes at the right time 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:39.880
 this can be plugged in some way 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:42.950
 correct in some way when 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.630
 we have a standard menu and 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.610
 then we already say good is 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:48.920
 this is served all day and you if 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:52.460
 he wants breakfast lunch or dinner is his 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:54.380
 own perspective then when 

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:56.510
 we plan the menu as we can 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:59.090
 also avoid that step 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:01.250
 making a menu much simpler 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:03.410
 the more complex the menu, the more 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:05.630
 time carry the menu more you have to 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:07.610
 plan while being simpler menu 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:09.320
 least you have to plan for the 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:12.260
 certain that we have to plan how we are going to 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:14.300
 prepare the food also the chef or 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.609
 the cook must know how 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:18.709
 prepare the food that is prepared 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:20.750
 first that they prepare second that 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:23.210
 prepares from the previous day that you have to 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:26.419
 have bought 23 days before for example 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:29.790
 If meats are to macerate or 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:32.850
 they have to prepare in advance 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:34.980
 they have to know how many days 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:37.350
 They carry in the refrigerator when they 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:41.160
 they have to prepare this whole question 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:43.530
 when that customer is pull out a 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:46.200
 Chef or chef has to be an expert in 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:47.820
 check the inventory you have to know 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:52.170
 missing that we have left and not 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:54.240
 waste nothing because in kitchen everything 

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:57.870
 what we waste not only 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:59.130
 contaminates the refrigerator but it 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:02.580
 causes other problems but 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:05.280
 mainly that we wasted money 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:07.080
 money is thrown when throwing food we throw 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.960
 money is a customer that has to 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:11.760
 review three inventories before 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:14.900
 all we need to prepare the 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:19.110
 raw materials that are on the side 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:21.120
 questions for desserts you have for 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:24.240
 snacks everything that is needed that 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:28.500
 I bought it in advance then also 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:31.260
 to verify how much can be prepared and 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:33.300
 three to see what the needs are 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:36.000
 than he of what we have to buy in 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:38.600
 the next days and that you know have a 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.820
 sensitivity that we are not selling 

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:44.430
 the lobster then do not buy it or 

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:46.470
 let's take the menu from the cook 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:49.320
 or the chef someone who does not feedback 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:52.530
 about our menu 

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:54.450
 constant cleaning and order we want the 

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:56.700
 order is very important in the inventory 

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:59.790
 because we can order from different 

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:03.180
 ways in the kitchen we can order the 

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:08.280
 breakfast inventory lunch and dinner or 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:09.990
 dry canned refrigerator depending 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:12.900
 of how the restaurant service is 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:15.480
 you also have to have all the 

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:17.760
 recipes from before you should have already 

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:21.240
 a whole recipe book and have them 

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:25.770
 tested we can not serve recipes that 

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:27.750
 we have never prepared nor have we tried and 

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:30.030
 you also have to offer the same quality 

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:33.000
 in food it can not be that one day 

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:35.670
 the chef came out very well the tamales and 

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:39.810
 the awful day depart tamales that 

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:41.700
 it has to do with maladministration and 

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:44.289
 we have to ensure that the quality 

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:46.659
 always be the correct 

00:06:44.289 --> 00:06:48.819
 also the chef or the chef will have to 

00:06:46.659 --> 00:06:51.369
 give the day's reports how was the 

00:06:48.819 --> 00:06:54.479
 Person who missed that left over can you 

00:06:51.369 --> 00:06:59.550
 mainly split the reports into 

00:06:54.479 --> 00:06:59.550
 staff can also divide them into 

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:04.260
 Incidents can also be divided into 

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:06.930
 Inventory 

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:09.120
 it depends on what you like yourself 

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:10.800
 administer also the chef or cook 

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:12.960
 must have experience in coordination 

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:15.240
 with the kitchen staff you should have 

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:18.880
 managerial skills if it is a 

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:22.540
 chef that you will have for several people 

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:24.880
 and let the chef know to select more 

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:27.100
 kitchen staff here we already 

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:28.510
 we made a vacancy that we're going to 

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:30.520
 teach within the exercises 

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:35.480
 practical so that you and nothing else 

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:37.820
 copy and paste and put it on the internet 

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:40.160
 I also want to tell you about the other topic 

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:42.760
 very important of the waiters or 

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:42.760
 Waiters
