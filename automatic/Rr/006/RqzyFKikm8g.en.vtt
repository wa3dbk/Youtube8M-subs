00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:10.290
 he is a hello man with you game show 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.929
 And now we will communicate with Andrei 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.509
 pigeon better known as jesus 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.310
 duet hello good evening good 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.940
 evening good evening and game show share 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.400
 monster 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.529
 Andrei how are you 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.170
 your feeling after two days 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.900
 tense games or not so tense 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.849
 Well, in general, on the first day there were no games 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.890
 quite tense I would call in 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.239
 second day of course yes it was less 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.540
 two games instead of three he was by nature 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.700
 wives were not even better 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.350
 we fought we fought for 1 day it 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.739
 there was some orgy just 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:47.239
 and it was extremely sad I think how 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.239
 observe and attend 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:52.230
 visitors are you a team or you personally 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:55.160
 tomorrow's starts have drimhak 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.840
 whether you look or already how exactly 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.770
 this bitterness of defeat will probably not give 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.370
 bitterness 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:05.339
 bitterness will not really come here with 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.770
 drooping head naturally 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.690
 maybe even sometimes going to the toilet and 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.210
 cry I can not worry 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.670
 quite simply and probably all the same not 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.640
 I can not no no budget come here 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:22.259
 Generally , one will not be a dreamhack 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:25.560
 anyway it's instead of being associated 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.479
 will be with this and here but I can not 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.729
 by chance here I was sitting yesterday 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.759
 just as you all the teams sat discussing 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:35.940
 replay watched 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:37.070
 you said that i don't understand this guys 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:40.740
 the game 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:46.290
 why why why about all lost 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:49.080
 how would it happen well well i don't understand 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:52.140
 I don't understand the game for 10 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.910
 let's say cancer maybe we are a team 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.560
 which let's say the score 14 won against 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:58.110
 the team that's where the top 1 they are 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.569
 give more and constantly because this batch 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.119
 everybody loses everybody wins everybody 

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:05.310
 and the community for how not to win with us 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.619
 the captain knows it seems yes says it is necessary here 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.979
 so I believe him of course we own 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:13.530
 we win but I do not know and can not 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.620
 so here are your future plans 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:19.769
 coming some tournaments 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:22.950
 maybe you will go bootkampy somewhere 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:24.959
 bootcamp ponders in principle yes tournaments 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.590
 all of which we will select all of which 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:26.610
 will invite 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.000
 everyone will try to play 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:32.760
 accordingly except here again something 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.879
 the atmosphere for already serving internet is not 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:40.440
 it is not the sorrow and sadness of all this bitterness 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:41.549
 she knows how she will wash 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.400
 we will try as much as possible 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:48.299
 act play to practice typing 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:50.609
 experience here so changes in the composition 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:52.260
 Naturally not planned, but who 

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:54.269
 would you pick out probably as a player here 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:58.140
 who did you like who played like 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:03:00.300
 your team yoga stomp on all 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.370
 bahai just along the way 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.230
 generally about the way here are the changes in 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.480
 teams that's exactly reshuffles 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.760
 How do you feel about them? Did you find the teams? 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.010
 here for example the same navi your game 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.570
 or else the guys have a long way to go 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.520
 long way to exactly 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:16.770
 become a team is not just 5 boys 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:19.800
 who gathered here to play Denmark 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:22.290
 navi is still a long long road from them 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.840
 new captain new style bell 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:27.300
 man of understanding is not himself already rude 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:30.270
 saying pretty old will be difficult here 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:32.250
 this bottom rise again because 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:33.260
 played all already play all long tail 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.390
 dandy 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.680
 accustomed to winning it all for on like 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:39.319
 how not to give that he went to 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:42.480
 egg and there ranked eighth out 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:45.360
 eight shorter and there still long 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:48.310
 about the rest of the solos like 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:50.230
 fit into empire what do you think 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.760
 Yes, I just fit in. I just think that 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.190
 solo need to play some more 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.569
 Significantly hero now emphasis because 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.670
 what to bury talent 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:59.920
 what is 7000 m m and just tear 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.569
 go anywhere here on sky monkey just ult 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:06.130
 they throw minutes on it all 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:09.790
 explodes and sits perfectly well the words 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:12.250
