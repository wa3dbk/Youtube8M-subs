00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
year's Moto G is also water resistant

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.470 
year's Moto G is also water resistant
that<00:00:47.190> means<00:00:47.399> it<00:00:47.489> should<00:00:47.520> be<00:00:47.850> able<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.180> survive

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
that means it should be able to survive

or<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:51.239> toilet<00:00:51.480> you<00:00:52.289> can't<00:00:52.530> actually<00:00:52.680> use<00:00:53.039> the

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
or the toilet you can't actually use the

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.529 
or the toilet you can't actually use the
phone<00:00:53.340> when<00:00:53.489> it's<00:00:53.610> underwater<00:00:53.789> but<00:00:54.329> you

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
phone when it's underwater but you

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:55.970 
phone when it's underwater but you
probably<00:00:54.870> don't<00:00:55.170> want<00:00:55.289> to<00:00:55.320> test<00:00:55.500> that<00:00:55.559> out<00:00:55.770> any

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
probably don't want to test that out any

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:56.959 
probably don't want to test that out any
more<00:00:56.129> than<00:00:56.190> you<00:00:56.340> have<00:00:56.550> to

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
more than you have to

my<00:00:57.210> one<00:00:57.390> real<00:00:57.719> gripe<00:00:58.020> about<00:00:58.170> this<00:00:58.410> year's

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
my one real gripe about this year's

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.200 
my one real gripe about this year's
design<00:00:58.859> is<00:00:59.100> that<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.250> Moto<00:00:59.430> G's<00:00:59.609> back<00:00:59.850> is<00:01:00.059> just

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
design is that the Moto G's back is just

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.750 
design is that the Moto G's back is just
a<00:01:00.300> bit<00:01:00.660> bulbous<00:01:01.020> a<00:01:01.440> lot<00:01:01.920> of<00:01:02.010> people<00:01:02.219> probably

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
a bit bulbous a lot of people probably

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:03.950 
a bit bulbous a lot of people probably
won't<00:01:02.940> have<00:01:03.030> a<00:01:03.090> problem<00:01:03.390> with<00:01:03.510> that<00:01:03.539> but<00:01:03.870> it

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
won't have a problem with that but it

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.719 
won't have a problem with that but it
makes<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.229> phone's<00:01:04.439> 5-inch<00:01:04.890> display<00:01:05.040> harder

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
makes the phone's 5-inch display harder

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.789 
makes the phone's 5-inch display harder
to<00:01:05.850> use<00:01:05.900> one-handed<00:01:06.900> then<00:01:07.260> on<00:01:07.380> a<00:01:07.409> phone<00:01:07.650> with

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
to use one-handed then on a phone with

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.070 
to use one-handed then on a phone with
slim<00:01:08.070> bezels<00:01:08.549> and<00:01:08.760> a<00:01:08.820> flat<00:01:09.060> back<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.750> display

slim bezels and a flat back the display
is<00:01:10.229> also<00:01:10.560> one<00:01:10.710> of<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.860> Moto<00:01:11.010> G's<00:01:11.189> weaker<00:01:11.520> spots

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
is also one of the Moto G's weaker spots

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.109 
is also one of the Moto G's weaker spots
if<00:01:12.360> 720p<00:01:13.170> resolution<00:01:13.320> is<00:01:13.830> fine<00:01:14.130> enough<00:01:14.460> but

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
if 720p resolution is fine enough but

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
the display is set back just a bit from

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.560 
the display is set back just a bit from
the<00:01:17.040> glass<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:17.640> its<00:01:17.729> color<00:01:18.030> to<00:01:18.119> me<00:01:18.330> a<00:01:18.360> bit

the glass and its color to me a bit

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.870 
the glass and its color to me a bit
muted<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:19.560> end<00:01:19.740> result<00:01:20.070> is<00:01:20.159> that<00:01:20.189> you<00:01:20.460> often

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
muted the end result is that you often

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.670 
muted the end result is that you often
feel<00:01:21.060> like<00:01:21.210> there's<00:01:21.450> an<00:01:21.540> imperceptible<00:01:22.110> haze

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
feel like there's an imperceptible haze

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.010 
feel like there's an imperceptible haze
between<00:01:23.189> you<00:01:23.400> and<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.610> screen<00:01:23.939> it's<00:01:24.540> entirely

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
between you and the screen it's entirely

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.050 
between you and the screen it's entirely
usable<00:01:25.710> but<00:01:25.950> it's<00:01:26.130> clear<00:01:26.340> that<00:01:26.369> this<00:01:26.580> is<00:01:26.759> part

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
usable but it's clear that this is part

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.280 
usable but it's clear that this is part
of<00:01:27.119> what<00:01:27.270> it<00:01:27.360> took<00:01:27.509> to<00:01:27.570> get<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.810> Moto<00:01:28.049> G's

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
of what it took to get the Moto G's

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.899 
of what it took to get the Moto G's
price<00:01:28.590> down<00:01:28.860> you'd<00:01:29.250> think<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.520> same<00:01:29.729> would<00:01:29.850> be

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
price down you'd think the same would be

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.580 
price down you'd think the same would be

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
turn the phone over what I really loved

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.520

was<00:02:02.729> its<00:02:03.000> gestures<00:02:03.659> especially<00:02:04.350> one<00:02:04.500> that

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
was its gestures especially one that

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.109 
was its gestures especially one that
lets<00:02:04.770> you<00:02:04.860> twist<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.250> phone<00:02:05.430> to<00:02:05.610> activate<00:02:05.969> its

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
lets you twist the phone to activate its

camera<00:02:06.509> the<00:02:06.869> camera<00:02:07.140> starts<00:02:07.409> fast<00:02:07.649> as<00:02:07.920> it<00:02:08.039> is

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
camera the camera starts fast as it is

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.010 
camera the camera starts fast as it is
so<00:02:08.580> this<00:02:08.700> made<00:02:08.849> it<00:02:08.940> incredibly<00:02:09.420> quick<00:02:09.869> to

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
so this made it incredibly quick to

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.900 
so this made it incredibly quick to
start<00:02:10.080> shooting<00:02:10.500> a<00:02:10.530> photo

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
start shooting a photo

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.770

unfortunately<00:02:11.910> the<00:02:12.180> actual

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
unfortunately the actual

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.140 
unfortunately the actual
photos<00:02:13.140> aren't<00:02:13.410> quite<00:02:13.830> as<00:02:13.980> amazing<00:02:14.430> photos

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150

look<00:02:15.330> pretty<00:02:15.690> good<00:02:15.930> when<00:02:16.080> you're<00:02:16.200> zoomed<00:02:16.470> out

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
look pretty good when you're zoomed out

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.290 
look pretty good when you're zoomed out
and<00:02:16.680> they're<00:02:16.980> filling<00:02:17.220> up<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.400> screen<00:02:17.700> once

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
and they're filling up the screen once

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.300 
and they're filling up the screen once
you<00:02:18.420> zoom<00:02:18.660> in<00:02:18.870> they<00:02:19.080> start<00:02:19.410> to<00:02:19.500> fall<00:02:19.680> apart

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
you zoom in they start to fall apart

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.550 
you zoom in they start to fall apart
basically<00:02:20.880> nothing<00:02:21.240> is<00:02:21.510> sharp<00:02:21.810> and<00:02:22.050> they<00:02:22.380> look

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
really digital you'll get some solid

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.670 
really digital you'll get some solid

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
with support for LTE it might seem weird

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.820 
with support for LTE it might seem weird
to<00:02:35.400> praise<00:02:35.700> that<00:02:35.910> in<00:02:36.030> 2015<00:02:36.600> but<00:02:36.840> LTE<00:02:37.440> hasn't
