00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
I guess the iPhone was kind of at a

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.030 
I guess the iPhone was kind of at a
weird<00:03:00.510> angle<00:03:00.750> and<00:03:01.140> I<00:03:01.230> didn't<00:03:01.500> really<00:03:01.620> frame<00:03:01.890> it

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
weird angle and I didn't really frame it

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.340 
weird angle and I didn't really frame it
