00:03:15.399 --> 00:03:15.409 
kilowatt and with gone but beside that

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:17.170 
kilowatt and with gone but beside that
that's<00:03:15.889> mostly<00:03:16.219> the<00:03:16.489> end<00:03:16.760> of<00:03:16.849> the<00:03:16.939> episode

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
that's mostly the end of the episode

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:18.699 
that's mostly the end of the episode
there<00:03:17.510> is<00:03:17.540> a<00:03:17.629> scene<00:03:17.870> at<00:03:17.989> the<00:03:18.079> very<00:03:18.290> end<00:03:18.500> which

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
there is a scene at the very end which

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:20.949 
there is a scene at the very end which
is<00:03:18.859> a<00:03:18.889> little<00:03:19.099> bit<00:03:19.280> of<00:03:19.489> a<00:03:19.609> tease<00:03:19.879> for<00:03:19.909> Morel<00:03:20.629> and

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
is a little bit of a tease for Morel and

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:22.569 
is a little bit of a tease for Morel and
poof<00:03:21.199> it's<00:03:21.680> pretty<00:03:21.889> much<00:03:22.010> just<00:03:22.069> Morrell

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:22.579 
poof it's pretty much just Morrell

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:24.159 
poof it's pretty much just Morrell
doubting<00:03:23.030> himself<00:03:23.150> as<00:03:23.540> he's<00:03:23.900> trying<00:03:24.079> to

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:24.169 
doubting himself as he's trying to

00:03:24.169 --> 00:03:26.259 
doubting himself as he's trying to
figure<00:03:24.440> out<00:03:24.560> what<00:03:24.739> the<00:03:24.859> hell<00:03:25.069> to<00:03:25.099> do<00:03:25.459> and<00:03:25.760> we

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269 
figure out what the hell to do and we

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:28.270 
figure out what the hell to do and we
get<00:03:26.419> to<00:03:26.510> see<00:03:26.629> that<00:03:26.780> poof<00:03:27.019> is<00:03:27.229> still<00:03:27.470> escaping

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
get to see that poof is still escaping

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.619 
get to see that poof is still escaping
or<00:03:28.549> going<00:03:28.819> through<00:03:28.849> some<00:03:29.180> weird<00:03:29.209> little

00:03:29.619 --> 00:03:29.629 
or going through some weird little

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:31.420 
or going through some weird little
transformation<00:03:30.560> if<00:03:30.979> you<00:03:31.069> look<00:03:31.220> at<00:03:31.340> the

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
transformation if you look at the

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.369 
transformation if you look at the
preview<00:03:31.819> I<00:03:31.849> saw<00:03:32.090> like<00:03:32.269> a<00:03:32.299> chibi<00:03:32.629> version<00:03:32.810> of

00:03:33.369 --> 00:03:33.379 
preview I saw like a chibi version of

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:35.069 
preview I saw like a chibi version of
poof<00:03:33.739> I'm<00:03:33.919> not<00:03:34.040> sure<00:03:34.310> what<00:03:34.459> to<00:03:34.549> take<00:03:34.699> from<00:03:34.879> this

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:35.079 
poof I'm not sure what to take from this

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:37.539 
poof I'm not sure what to take from this
but<00:03:36.079> otherwise<00:03:36.319> this<00:03:36.680> episode<00:03:37.159> was<00:03:37.310> a<00:03:37.370> pretty

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:37.549 
but otherwise this episode was a pretty

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:39.580 
but otherwise this episode was a pretty
nice<00:03:37.729> package<00:03:38.180> it<00:03:38.479> was<00:03:38.629> a<00:03:38.659> little<00:03:39.109> slow<00:03:39.560> in

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
nice package it was a little slow in

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.009 
nice package it was a little slow in
some<00:03:40.129> parts<00:03:40.519> mostly<00:03:41.329> the<00:03:41.540> stuff<00:03:41.780> in<00:03:41.930> the

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:42.019 
some parts mostly the stuff in the

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:43.569 
some parts mostly the stuff in the
middle<00:03:42.260> I<00:03:42.349> kind<00:03:42.590> of<00:03:42.650> wish<00:03:42.799> they'd<00:03:42.979> given<00:03:43.370> us<00:03:43.459> a

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:43.579 
middle I kind of wish they'd given us a

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:45.219 
middle I kind of wish they'd given us a
little<00:03:43.849> bit<00:03:44.000> more<00:03:44.269> with<00:03:44.449> the<00:03:44.540> whole<00:03:44.659> Morel<00:03:45.019> and

00:03:45.219 --> 00:03:45.229 
little bit more with the whole Morel and

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:47.379 
little bit more with the whole Morel and
poof<00:03:45.409> thing<00:03:45.680> but<00:03:46.340> otherwise<00:03:46.669> the<00:03:47.090> entire

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:47.389 
poof thing but otherwise the entire

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:49.809 
poof thing but otherwise the entire
scene<00:03:47.689> was<00:03:47.900> very<00:03:47.930> tense<00:03:48.500> it<00:03:49.009> was<00:03:49.159> unlike<00:03:49.519> any

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:49.819 
scene was very tense it was unlike any

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:51.099 
scene was very tense it was unlike any
other<00:03:50.000> battle<00:03:50.239> that's<00:03:50.569> been<00:03:50.720> in<00:03:50.840> the<00:03:50.930> series

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:51.109 
other battle that's been in the series

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:52.780 
other battle that's been in the series
if<00:03:51.349> you<00:03:51.439> even<00:03:51.590> want<00:03:51.829> to<00:03:51.859> call<00:03:52.099> it<00:03:52.250> a<00:03:52.310> battle<00:03:52.609> and

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
if you even want to call it a battle and

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:54.580 
if you even want to call it a battle and
of<00:03:53.150> course<00:03:53.239> you<00:03:53.509> had<00:03:53.689> that<00:03:53.810> incredibly

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
of course you had that incredibly

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:56.080 
of course you had that incredibly
awesome<00:03:54.769> scene<00:03:55.189> at<00:03:55.310> the<00:03:55.430> beginning<00:03:55.759> of<00:03:56.000> the

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
awesome scene at the beginning of the

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.149 
awesome scene at the beginning of the
episode<00:03:56.299> which<00:03:56.629> had<00:03:56.780> good<00:03:56.959> animation<00:03:57.560> was

00:03:58.149 --> 00:03:58.159 
episode which had good animation was

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:00.009 
episode which had good animation was
just<00:03:58.370> really<00:03:58.669> really<00:03:58.849> satisfying<00:03:59.509> and<00:03:59.840> just

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:00.019 
just really really satisfying and just

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:02.080 
just really really satisfying and just
getting<00:04:00.199> to<00:04:00.290> see<00:04:00.470> Kilowog<00:04:00.859> all-out<00:04:01.090> was

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
getting to see Kilowog all-out was

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:03.969 
getting to see Kilowog all-out was
really<00:04:02.870> really<00:04:03.049> cool<00:04:03.229> you<00:04:03.439> know<00:04:03.470> what<00:04:03.709> he

00:04:03.969 --> 00:04:03.979 
really really cool you know what he

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:05.439 
really really cool you know what he
probably<00:04:04.189> wasn't<00:04:04.489> going<00:04:04.879> all<00:04:05.000> out<00:04:05.150> he<00:04:05.329> was

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:05.449 
probably wasn't going all out he was

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:06.999 
probably wasn't going all out he was
probably<00:04:05.599> just<00:04:05.870> testing<00:04:06.349> out<00:04:06.439> his<00:04:06.470> abilities

00:04:06.999 --> 00:04:07.009 
probably just testing out his abilities

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:08.710 
probably just testing out his abilities
for<00:04:07.189> a<00:04:07.220> second<00:04:07.609> and<00:04:07.819> it's<00:04:08.419> pretty<00:04:08.629> obvious

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720 
for a second and it's pretty obvious

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.110 
for a second and it's pretty obvious
because<00:04:09.470> you<00:04:09.859> know<00:04:09.979> yuffie<00:04:10.370> obviously<00:04:10.970> could

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
because you know yuffie obviously could

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.520 
because you know yuffie obviously could
have<00:04:11.150> taken<00:04:11.389> a<00:04:11.569> lot<00:04:11.750> more<00:04:11.930> damage

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.530 
have taken a lot more damage

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:14.349 
have taken a lot more damage
he<00:04:12.829> was<00:04:12.979> basically<00:04:13.159> just<00:04:13.609> being<00:04:13.790> pushed<00:04:14.090> back

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:14.359 
he was basically just being pushed back

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:16.899 
he was basically just being pushed back
so<00:04:14.659> we're<00:04:15.409> probably<00:04:15.859> still<00:04:16.190> at<00:04:16.609> the<00:04:16.639> very

00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:16.909 
so we're probably still at the very

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:18.279 
so we're probably still at the very
beginning<00:04:17.449> of<00:04:17.630> the<00:04:17.810> battles<00:04:18.109> that<00:04:18.259> are

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:18.289 
beginning of the battles that are

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:20.080 
beginning of the battles that are
happening<00:04:18.709> for<00:04:18.829> this<00:04:18.979> arc<00:04:19.220> because<00:04:19.639> the<00:04:19.940> way<00:04:20.060> I

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.090 
happening for this arc because the way I

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.860 
happening for this arc because the way I
look<00:04:20.209> at<00:04:20.570> it

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
look at it

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:22.690 
look at it
poof<00:04:21.289> really<00:04:21.620> hasn't<00:04:21.949> done<00:04:22.099> anything<00:04:22.340> yet

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:22.700 
poof really hasn't done anything yet

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.810 
poof really hasn't done anything yet
never<00:04:23.510> pitot<00:04:23.960> is<00:04:24.229> still<00:04:24.500> healing<00:04:24.919> Kaimuki

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:29.740 
gaun is still probably sitting
