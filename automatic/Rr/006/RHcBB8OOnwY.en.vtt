hi<00:00:05.160> everyone<00:00:05.430> brick<00:00:05.759> waffle<00:00:06.089> here<00:00:06.270> and<00:00:06.420> today

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
hi everyone brick waffle here and today

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:07.880 
hi everyone brick waffle here and today
I'm<00:00:06.779> going<00:00:06.810> to<00:00:07.049> show<00:00:07.230> you<00:00:07.290> how<00:00:07.379> to<00:00:07.560> build<00:00:07.799> a

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
I'm going to show you how to build a

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.980 
I'm going to show you how to build a
bookcase<00:00:08.130> hidden<00:00:08.580> door<00:00:08.760> when<00:00:09.480> you<00:00:09.570> walk<00:00:09.690> up<00:00:09.750> to

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
bookcase hidden door when you walk up to

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.299 
bookcase hidden door when you walk up to
this<00:00:10.080> you'll<00:00:10.320> see<00:00:10.469> that<00:00:10.620> it<00:00:10.800> pulls<00:00:11.070> back

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
this you'll see that it pulls back

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:12.919 
this you'll see that it pulls back
revealing<00:00:11.639> a<00:00:11.910> hallway<00:00:12.059> to<00:00:12.240> the<00:00:12.360> right<00:00:12.480> and<00:00:12.870> to

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
revealing a hallway to the right and to

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.780 
revealing a hallway to the right and to
the<00:00:13.139> left<00:00:13.230> there's<00:00:14.099> a<00:00:14.160> pressure<00:00:14.400> plate<00:00:14.580> here

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
the left there's a pressure plate here

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:15.890 
the left there's a pressure plate here
on<00:00:14.880> the<00:00:14.940> floor<00:00:15.030> it's<00:00:15.269> a<00:00:15.450> little<00:00:15.630> bit<00:00:15.719> hard<00:00:15.870> to

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
on the floor it's a little bit hard to

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.450 
on the floor it's a little bit hard to
see<00:00:16.109> of<00:00:16.320> course<00:00:16.529> you<00:00:16.650> can<00:00:16.770> change<00:00:17.010> this<00:00:17.190> to<00:00:17.340> any

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
see of course you can change this to any

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:18.859 
see of course you can change this to any
kind<00:00:17.640> of<00:00:17.670> input<00:00:17.850> mechanism<00:00:18.090> you<00:00:18.510> want<00:00:18.690> if

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
kind of input mechanism you want if

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.060 
kind of input mechanism you want if
you'd<00:00:18.960> like<00:00:19.080> to<00:00:19.140> have<00:00:19.410> that<00:00:19.560> be<00:00:19.680> a<00:00:19.710> little<00:00:19.920> bit

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
you'd like to have that be a little bit

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.769 
you'd like to have that be a little bit
more<00:00:20.189> hidden<00:00:20.430> but<00:00:21.210> there's<00:00:21.449> also<00:00:21.600> two

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
more hidden but there's also two

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.179 
more hidden but there's also two
interesting<00:00:22.380> ways<00:00:22.529> that<00:00:22.680> you<00:00:22.710> can<00:00:22.890> come<00:00:23.010> back

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
interesting ways that you can come back

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.160 
interesting ways that you can come back
out<00:00:23.430> of<00:00:23.460> here<00:00:23.760> so<00:00:24.449> when<00:00:24.600> you<00:00:24.660> come<00:00:24.779> off<00:00:24.810> to<00:00:25.050> one

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
out of here so when you come off to one

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.720 
out of here so when you come off to one
side<00:00:25.199> this<00:00:25.859> is<00:00:26.010> one<00:00:26.130> example<00:00:26.220> there's<00:00:26.699> a

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
side this is one example there's a

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:27.890 
side this is one example there's a
pressure<00:00:26.910> plate<00:00:27.060> on<00:00:27.269> here<00:00:27.510> that's<00:00:27.689> pretty

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
pressure plate on here that's pretty

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.630 
pressure plate on here that's pretty
obvious<00:00:28.050> you<00:00:28.619> can<00:00:28.769> use<00:00:28.890> that<00:00:29.010> go<00:00:29.220> back<00:00:29.400> back

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
obvious you can use that go back back

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.790 
obvious you can use that go back back
out<00:00:29.990> however<00:00:30.990> if<00:00:31.140> we<00:00:31.230> go<00:00:31.320> to<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.560> right<00:00:31.679> you'll

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
out however if we go to the right you'll

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.440 
out however if we go to the right you'll
see<00:00:31.859> there<00:00:32.040> is<00:00:32.130> no<00:00:32.279> pressure<00:00:32.489> plate<00:00:32.820> and<00:00:33.030> it

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
see there is no pressure plate and it

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:34.549 
see there is no pressure plate and it
looks<00:00:33.600> like<00:00:33.750> you're<00:00:33.899> stuck<00:00:33.930> from<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.350> side

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
looks like you're stuck from the side

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.200 
looks like you're stuck from the side
the<00:00:35.340> interesting<00:00:35.640> thing<00:00:35.700> here<00:00:35.969> is<00:00:36.090> because

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
the interesting thing here is because

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.000 
the interesting thing here is because
we're<00:00:36.480> using<00:00:36.570> furnaces<00:00:37.290> to<00:00:37.559> keep<00:00:37.710> this<00:00:37.829> line

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
we're using furnaces to keep this line

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.770 
we're using furnaces to keep this line
blocks<00:00:38.250> from<00:00:38.340> moving<00:00:38.670> whenever<00:00:39.329> you<00:00:39.480> put<00:00:39.690> an

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
blocks from moving whenever you put an

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.299 
blocks from moving whenever you put an
item<00:00:39.899> in<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.170> bottom<00:00:40.410> furnace<00:00:40.680> it's<00:00:41.070> going<00:00:41.250> to

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
item in the bottom furnace it's going to

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:42.470 
item in the bottom furnace it's going to
go<00:00:41.399> ahead<00:00:41.489> and<00:00:41.610> power<00:00:41.820> that<00:00:41.910> off<00:00:42.120> until<00:00:42.450> you

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
go ahead and power that off until you

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.000 
go ahead and power that off until you
take<00:00:42.719> that<00:00:42.870> item<00:00:43.110> back<00:00:43.290> out<00:00:43.500> but<00:00:43.680> you<00:00:43.770> can<00:00:43.920> do

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
take that item back out but you can do

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.220 
take that item back out but you can do
from<00:00:44.129> this<00:00:44.280> side<00:00:44.460> and<00:00:44.660> the<00:00:45.660> bookcases<00:00:45.989> will

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
from this side and the bookcases will

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.010 
from this side and the bookcases will
come<00:00:46.350> flush<00:00:46.559> again<00:00:47.570> so<00:00:48.570> let<00:00:48.660> me<00:00:48.690> come<00:00:48.870> around

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
come flush again so let me come around

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.880 
come flush again so let me come around
back<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.379> I'll<00:00:49.440> show<00:00:49.559> you<00:00:49.649> what<00:00:49.710> this<00:00:49.829> looks

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
back and I'll show you what this looks

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.910 
back and I'll show you what this looks
like<00:00:50.160> underneath<00:00:51.379> there's<00:00:52.379> a<00:00:52.469> redstone

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
like underneath there's a redstone

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.260 
like underneath there's a redstone
wiring<00:00:53.250> from<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.550> pressure<00:00:53.760> plate<00:00:53.910> of<00:00:54.090> course

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
wiring from the pressure plate of course

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.490 
wiring from the pressure plate of course
you<00:00:54.360> can<00:00:54.510> bring<00:00:54.660> this<00:00:54.780> in<00:00:54.930> from<00:00:55.110> wherever<00:00:55.289> you

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
you can bring this in from wherever you

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.810 
you can bring this in from wherever you
want<00:00:55.710> that's<00:00:56.010> from<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.280> pressure<00:00:56.489> plate<00:00:56.640> on

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
want that's from the pressure plate on

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.160 
want that's from the pressure plate on
the<00:00:56.879> left<00:00:57.059> hand<00:00:57.180> side<00:00:57.300> if<00:00:57.600> you're<00:00:57.660> facing<00:00:57.719> the

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
the left hand side if you're facing the

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.779 
the left hand side if you're facing the
bookshelves<00:00:58.530> that<00:00:59.160> just<00:00:59.340> runs<00:00:59.460> into<00:00:59.760> a

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
bookshelves that just runs into a

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.060 
bookshelves that just runs into a
repeater<00:01:00.149> into<00:01:00.480> a<00:01:00.510> block<00:01:00.780> into<00:01:01.379> a<00:01:01.410> torch<00:01:01.859> and

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
repeater into a block into a torch and

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.889 
repeater into a block into a torch and
that<00:01:02.789> will<00:01:02.910> invert<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.390> signal<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.690> the

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
that will invert the signal to the

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.719 
that will invert the signal to the
sticky<00:01:04.170> pistons<00:01:04.500> pulling<00:01:05.129> this<00:01:05.220> line<00:01:05.430> blocks

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
sticky pistons pulling this line blocks

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.120 
sticky pistons pulling this line blocks
back<00:01:05.939> since<00:01:06.840> slime<00:01:07.080> blocks<00:01:07.350> bring<00:01:07.860> anything

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
back since slime blocks bring anything

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.859 
back since slime blocks bring anything
they're<00:01:08.369> attached<00:01:08.610> to<00:01:08.790> with<00:01:08.970> them<00:01:09.150> we've<00:01:09.689> got

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
they're attached to with them we've got

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.500 
they're attached to with them we've got
those<00:01:10.020> bookshelves<00:01:10.619> right<00:01:10.979> up<00:01:11.070> against<00:01:11.369> that

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:11.510 
those bookshelves right up against that

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.460 
those bookshelves right up against that
furnaces<00:01:12.510> and<00:01:12.540> a<00:01:12.750> few<00:01:12.869> other<00:01:13.049> blocks<00:01:13.260> like

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
furnaces and a few other blocks like

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.190 
furnaces and a few other blocks like
obsidian<00:01:13.740> are<00:01:14.729> not<00:01:15.000> drug<00:01:15.420> along<00:01:15.810> with<00:01:16.049> the

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
obsidian are not drug along with the

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.320 
obsidian are not drug along with the
slime<00:01:16.710> blocks<00:01:16.979> so<00:01:17.250> in<00:01:17.369> this<00:01:17.430> case<00:01:17.640> we<00:01:18.299> use

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
slime blocks so in this case we use

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.810 
slime blocks so in this case we use
those<00:01:18.689> for<00:01:18.990> aesthetics<00:01:19.530> and<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.580> bring<00:01:20.729> a

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
those for aesthetics and to bring a

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.130 
those for aesthetics and to bring a
signal<00:01:21.090> out<00:01:21.150> but<00:01:21.390> also<00:01:21.509> to<00:01:21.689> keep<00:01:21.930> them<00:01:22.110> from

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
signal out but also to keep them from

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.859 
signal out but also to keep them from
pulling<00:01:22.380> back<00:01:22.799> with<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.189> wall<00:01:23.570> so<00:01:24.570> see<00:01:24.750> them

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
pulling back with the wall so see them

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.960 
pulling back with the wall so see them
from<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.020> furnace<00:01:25.640> there's<00:01:26.640> simply<00:01:26.850> a

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
from the furnace there's simply a

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.690 
from the furnace there's simply a
comparator<00:01:27.479> redstone<00:01:28.320> repeater<00:01:28.700> bringing

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
comparator redstone repeater bringing

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.429 
comparator redstone repeater bringing
that<00:01:29.790> signal<00:01:30.240> down<00:01:30.420> into<00:01:30.750> a<00:01:30.780> repeater<00:01:31.170> on<00:01:31.229> the

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
that signal down into a repeater on the

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:32.600 
that signal down into a repeater on the
other<00:01:31.619> side<00:01:31.890> of<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.070> block<00:01:32.220> that<00:01:32.369> we<00:01:32.490> had

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
other side of the block that we had

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.630 
other side of the block that we had
earlier<00:01:33.590> so<00:01:34.590> next<00:01:34.740> step<00:01:34.860> is<00:01:35.159> I'll<00:01:35.430> show<00:01:35.579> you

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
earlier so next step is I'll show you

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.859 
earlier so next step is I'll show you
how<00:01:35.790> to<00:01:35.850> build<00:01:36.000> this<00:01:36.150> and<00:01:36.390> then<00:01:36.540> i'll<00:01:36.630> show<00:01:36.810> you

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
how to build this and then i'll show you

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.590 
how to build this and then i'll show you
how<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:37.140> build<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.560> variations<00:01:38.220> on<00:01:38.369> it

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
how to build the variations on it

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.490 
how to build the variations on it
alright<00:01:39.600> so<00:01:39.750> what<00:01:39.869> you'll<00:01:40.049> need<00:01:40.140> to<00:01:40.290> build

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
alright so what you'll need to build

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.929 
alright so what you'll need to build
this<00:01:40.650> is<00:01:40.860> some<00:01:41.070> building<00:01:41.400> materials<00:01:41.430> i'm

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
this is some building materials i'm

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.060 
this is some building materials i'm

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
plate for the first design now you'll

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.620 
plate for the first design now you'll
need<00:01:54.840> an<00:01:54.899> area<00:01:55.110> that<00:01:55.170> is<00:01:55.350> five<00:01:55.860> wide<00:01:56.250> by<00:01:57.000> five

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.050 
need an area that is five wide by five
deep<00:01:57.960> and<00:01:58.140> then<00:01:58.860> if<00:01:59.159> you<00:01:59.250> dig<00:01:59.430> two<00:01:59.640> down<00:01:59.850> that

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
deep and then if you dig two down that

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.219 
deep and then if you dig two down that
should<00:02:00.210> give<00:02:00.299> you<00:02:00.360> enough<00:02:00.390> room<00:02:00.689> to<00:02:00.840> put<00:02:01.020> all

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
should give you enough room to put all

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.719 
should give you enough room to put all
your<00:02:01.350> wiring<00:02:01.560> in<00:02:01.770> underneath<00:02:02.070> and<00:02:02.369> still<00:02:02.610> keep

thing we're going to want to do is put

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:06.830 
thing we're going to want to do is put
in<00:02:05.640> our<00:02:05.759> block<00:02:05.969> for<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.210> pressure<00:02:06.390> plate<00:02:06.570> and

and a redstone torch on top of the block

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.640 
and a redstone torch on top of the block
that's<00:02:17.570> really<00:02:17.810> it<00:02:17.960> for<00:02:18.080> down<00:02:18.230> here<00:02:18.410> for<00:02:18.590> the

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
that's really it for down here for the

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.160 
that's really it for down here for the
first<00:02:18.770> version<00:02:19.630> so<00:02:20.630> if<00:02:20.690> we<00:02:20.720> come<00:02:20.870> up<00:02:20.990> to<00:02:21.080> the

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
first version so if we come up to the

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.260 
first version so if we come up to the
top<00:02:21.320> of<00:02:21.380> the<00:02:21.500> redstone<00:02:21.860> torch<00:02:22.150> right<00:02:23.150> where

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
top of the redstone torch right where

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.180 
top of the redstone torch right where
that<00:02:23.300> comes<00:02:23.600> we<00:02:23.810> want<00:02:23.960> to<00:02:24.020> have<00:02:24.170> a<00:02:24.200> sticky

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
that comes we want to have a sticky

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:26.890 
that comes we want to have a sticky
piston<00:02:25.340> facing<00:02:25.640> towards<00:02:26.090> us<00:02:26.210> and<00:02:26.420> that'll

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
piston facing towards us and that'll

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.020 
piston facing towards us and that'll
automatically<00:02:27.350> power<00:02:27.590> it<00:02:27.770> on<00:02:27.940> then<00:02:28.940> we're

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
automatically power it on then we're

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.520 
automatically power it on then we're
gonna<00:02:29.120> want<00:02:29.240> to<00:02:29.330> put<00:02:29.450> sticky<00:02:29.780> blotter<00:02:30.140> slime

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
gonna want to put sticky blotter slime

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.860 
gonna want to put sticky blotter slime
blocks<00:02:30.770> rather<00:02:30.950> and<00:02:31.250> an<00:02:31.910> array<00:02:32.120> like<00:02:32.330> this<00:02:32.510> so

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
blocks rather and an array like this so

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.140 
blocks rather and an array like this so
that<00:02:33.050> the<00:02:33.260> bottom<00:02:34.190> Center<00:02:34.580> is<00:02:34.730> behind<00:02:35.000> the

blocks and a pressure plate on the front

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.740 
blocks and a pressure plate on the front
and<00:02:45.800> this<00:02:46.580> is<00:02:46.730> effectively<00:02:47.120> the<00:02:47.360> entire

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
and this is effectively the entire

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.470 
and this is effectively the entire
design<00:02:48.880> now<00:02:49.880> obviously<00:02:49.970> you're<00:02:50.300> going<00:02:50.420> to

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
design now obviously you're going to

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:51.640 
design now obviously you're going to
want<00:02:50.600> to<00:02:50.660> do<00:02:50.750> a<00:02:50.780> little<00:02:50.990> bit<00:02:51.140> more<00:02:51.260> work<00:02:51.320> you

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
want to do a little bit more work you

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.020 
want to do a little bit more work you
can<00:02:51.800> come<00:02:51.920> in<00:02:52.040> here<00:02:52.190> and<00:02:52.280> put<00:02:52.370> in<00:02:52.490> a<00:02:52.550> floor<00:02:52.790> that

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
can come in here and put in a floor that

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.110 
can come in here and put in a floor that
will<00:02:53.900> help<00:02:54.050> hide<00:02:54.260> some<00:02:54.500> of<00:02:54.530> this<00:02:54.880> most<00:02:55.880> of<00:02:56.030> what

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
will help hide some of this most of what

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.460 
will help hide some of this most of what
you<00:02:56.240> do<00:02:56.330> from<00:02:56.450> this<00:02:56.600> point<00:02:56.690> on<00:02:56.990> is<00:02:57.020> just<00:02:57.320> to

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
you do from this point on is just to

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:58.900 
you do from this point on is just to
fill<00:02:57.620> it<00:02:57.710> out<00:02:57.770> decorated<00:02:58.310> however<00:02:58.610> matches

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
fill it out decorated however matches

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.530 
fill it out decorated however matches
with<00:02:59.060> your<00:02:59.180> base<00:03:01.030> obviously<00:03:02.030> you'd<00:03:02.300> want<00:03:02.450> to

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
with your base obviously you'd want to

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.060 
with your base obviously you'd want to
cover<00:03:02.660> up<00:03:02.840> those<00:03:02.960> furnaces<00:03:03.500> so<00:03:03.620> you<00:03:03.710> can't<00:03:03.890> see

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:04.070 
cover up those furnaces so you can't see

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:05.860 
cover up those furnaces so you can't see
that<00:03:04.190> there's<00:03:04.370> another<00:03:04.640> passageway<00:03:05.540> there

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
that there's another passageway there

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.410 
that there's another passageway there
you<00:03:06.020> can<00:03:06.170> do<00:03:06.290> this<00:03:06.470> come<00:03:06.770> up<00:03:07.400> and<00:03:07.610> from<00:03:08.240> this

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
you can do this come up and from this

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:09.670 
you can do this come up and from this
point<00:03:08.480> it<00:03:08.930> looks<00:03:08.960> pretty<00:03:09.200> much<00:03:09.350> like<00:03:09.440> it<00:03:09.650> did

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
point it looks pretty much like it did

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.530 
point it looks pretty much like it did
at<00:03:09.800> the<00:03:09.860> beginning<00:03:09.950> of<00:03:10.160> the<00:03:10.250> video<00:03:10.460> you<00:03:10.700> can<00:03:11.390> go

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
at the beginning of the video you can go

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.350 
at the beginning of the video you can go
up<00:03:11.570> to<00:03:11.720> either<00:03:11.810> side<00:03:12.970> so<00:03:13.970> of<00:03:14.060> course<00:03:14.090> there

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
up to either side so of course there

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.090 
up to either side so of course there
were<00:03:14.450> two<00:03:14.570> mechanisms<00:03:14.750> for<00:03:15.320> reopening<00:03:15.830> the

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.100 
were two mechanisms for reopening the

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:17.800 
were two mechanisms for reopening the
door<00:03:16.250> if<00:03:16.490> you're<00:03:17.060> using<00:03:17.270> the<00:03:17.480> version<00:03:17.780> that

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
door if you're using the version that

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:19.210 
door if you're using the version that
has<00:03:17.930> the<00:03:18.200> pressure<00:03:18.410> plate<00:03:18.620> on<00:03:18.830> this<00:03:19.010> side

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
has the pressure plate on this side

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:20.470 
has the pressure plate on this side
that's<00:03:19.489> really<00:03:19.730> easy<00:03:19.880> you<00:03:20.000> just<00:03:20.120> stick<00:03:20.420> the

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
that's really easy you just stick the

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.210 
that's really easy you just stick the
pressure<00:03:20.690> plate<00:03:20.810> there<00:03:21.110> come<00:03:21.980> underneath

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
pressure plate there come underneath

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.240 
pressure plate there come underneath
that<00:03:22.430> and<00:03:22.640> add<00:03:23.090> some<00:03:23.360> redstone<00:03:23.690> and<00:03:24.250> you're

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
that and add some redstone and you're

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.760 
that and add some redstone and you're
done<00:03:26.110> that<00:03:27.110> will<00:03:27.260> work<00:03:27.290> you<00:03:27.470> already

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:27.770 
done that will work you already

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:29.590 
done that will work you already
connected<00:03:27.950> the<00:03:28.190> same<00:03:28.400> signal<00:03:28.730> for<00:03:29.390> the<00:03:29.450> other

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:29.600 
connected the same signal for the other

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:30.760 
connected the same signal for the other
side<00:03:29.750> it's<00:03:29.930> a<00:03:29.989> little<00:03:30.200> bit<00:03:30.320> more<00:03:30.440> complicated

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:30.770 
side it's a little bit more complicated

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:32.410 
side it's a little bit more complicated
and<00:03:31.070> you<00:03:31.220> will<00:03:31.370> need<00:03:31.550> a<00:03:31.580> few<00:03:31.790> more<00:03:31.910> materials

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
and you will need a few more materials

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:33.550 
and you will need a few more materials
you're<00:03:32.690> also<00:03:32.810> going<00:03:32.900> to<00:03:33.050> need<00:03:33.110> to<00:03:33.200> make<00:03:33.410> this

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
you're also going to need to make this

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.740 
you're also going to need to make this
area<00:03:33.950> a<00:03:34.010> little<00:03:34.220> bit<00:03:34.310> bigger<00:03:34.610> so<00:03:35.540> we're<00:03:35.660> going

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
area a little bit bigger so we're going

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.400 
area a little bit bigger so we're going
to<00:03:35.840> come<00:03:35.989> back<00:03:36.200> two<00:03:36.620> blocks<00:03:36.950> and<00:03:38.260> then<00:03:39.260> we're

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
to come back two blocks and then we're

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:40.750 
to come back two blocks and then we're
going<00:03:39.500> to<00:03:39.560> put<00:03:39.800> some<00:03:39.830> blocks<00:03:40.220> here<00:03:40.459> underneath

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
going to put some blocks here underneath

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.090 
going to put some blocks here underneath
so<00:03:41.360> one<00:03:41.690> to<00:03:41.930> put<00:03:42.110> a<00:03:42.140> comparator<00:03:42.650> and<00:03:42.830> then<00:03:43.070> a

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.100 
so one to put a comparator and then a

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:48.460 
so one to put a comparator and then a
repeater<00:03:43.459> and<00:03:46.060> then<00:03:47.060> a<00:03:47.420> few<00:03:47.810> more<00:03:47.989> just<00:03:48.410> to

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
repeater and then a few more just to

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.710 
repeater and then a few more just to
carry<00:03:48.650> some<00:03:48.830> redstone<00:03:49.010> dust<00:03:49.390> so<00:03:50.390> we'll<00:03:50.540> need<00:03:50.660> a

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
carry some redstone dust so we'll need a

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.150 
carry some redstone dust so we'll need a
repeater<00:03:51.170> facing<00:03:51.620> into<00:03:51.769> the<00:03:51.800> block<00:03:51.980> from<00:03:52.100> the

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
repeater facing into the block from the

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.820 
repeater facing into the block from the
other<00:03:52.310> side<00:03:52.989> one<00:03:53.989> block<00:03:54.200> away<00:03:54.260> from<00:03:54.590> the

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:54.830 
other side one block away from the

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:56.340 
other side one block away from the
furnace<00:03:55.040> will<00:03:55.280> need<00:03:55.400> another<00:03:55.580> review

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:56.350 
furnace will need another review

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:59.020 
furnace will need another review
redstone<00:03:57.350> coming<00:03:57.709> down<00:03:57.860> to<00:03:58.580> connect<00:03:58.820> those

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
redstone coming down to connect those

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.210 
redstone coming down to connect those
and<00:03:59.300> then<00:03:59.989> all<00:04:00.110> we'll<00:04:00.230> need<00:04:00.320> is<00:04:00.380> e<00:04:00.650> comparator

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 
and then all we'll need is e comparator

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:02.590 
and then all we'll need is e comparator
which<00:04:01.370> is<00:04:01.700> the<00:04:01.790> one<00:04:01.910> piece<00:04:02.060> I<00:04:02.180> didn't<00:04:02.450> have<00:04:02.540> on

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:02.600 
which is the one piece I didn't have on

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:03.850 
which is the one piece I didn't have on
the<00:04:02.660> hot<00:04:02.780> bar<00:04:02.959> from<00:04:03.110> the<00:04:03.200> previous<00:04:03.530> version

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:03.860 
the hot bar from the previous version

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.220 
the hot bar from the previous version
and<00:04:04.040> we<00:04:05.000> just<00:04:05.180> put<00:04:05.239> that<00:04:05.480> comparator<00:04:06.019> here

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
and we just put that comparator here

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.320 
and we just put that comparator here
coming<00:04:06.560> out<00:04:06.709> of<00:04:06.739> the<00:04:07.010> furnace<00:04:07.160> so<00:04:07.910> now<00:04:08.060> as<00:04:08.209> soon

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:08.330 
coming out of the furnace so now as soon

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:09.670 
coming out of the furnace so now as soon
as<00:04:08.450> you<00:04:08.540> have<00:04:08.690> anything<00:04:08.930> burnable<00:04:09.410> in<00:04:09.590> the

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
as you have anything burnable in the

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.190 
as you have anything burnable in the
fuel<00:04:09.920> slot<00:04:10.209> that<00:04:11.209> will<00:04:11.360> open<00:04:11.450> up<00:04:11.660> and<00:04:12.019> it<00:04:12.110> will

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 
fuel slot that will open up and it will

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.640 
fuel slot that will open up and it will
stay<00:04:12.290> open<00:04:12.380> as<00:04:12.709> long<00:04:12.860> as<00:04:12.980> you<00:04:13.070> keep<00:04:13.190> it<00:04:13.340> there
