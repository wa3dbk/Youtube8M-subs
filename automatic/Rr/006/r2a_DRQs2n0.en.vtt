00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 um everyone and everyone welcome in the 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.240
 review that has been taken from the trailer 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:09.920
 the film of hbo mourning the movie 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.720
 effectively more things about bolt 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.490
 and this time is immune from 

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:15.290
 which I expected a lot since there was 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:16.910
 seen that many youtubers which 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:19.130
 I follow which make reviews as well 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.380
 that I had raised the reaction 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.810
 I know what lot of things and giving a lot there 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.369
 about this trailer and suddenly I see it and 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.190
 I realize it's a trailer 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:29.539
 just about 49 seconds but 

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:32.239
 good although the trailer has not put 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:34.220
 a lot of information does contribute in this 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:36.470
 case the position that will occupy each 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.239
 important character which is 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.610
 pretty good and they've already confirmed it 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:42.260
 there is something more missed a lot from the trailer 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.150
 good to understand let's start to 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.860
 comment on that introduction in which 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.269
 we see that I really like it 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.860
 quite the truth so much the animation 

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:50.930
 as the introduction which has been seen 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.820
 that like ken to reuters the protagonist and 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.339
 suddenly he takes bold and like he throws 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.229
 painting like saying motherfucker no longer 

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:59.120
 is the protagonist you now I am 

00:00:57.229 --> 00:01:00.920
 you and good what is being said of 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.570
 that in this trailer is more than anything 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.369
 clarify the position of each character 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.920
 important in this story I say 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:09.260
 because basically when a 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.820
 word then later it appears as 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.290
 that word in the position that goes to 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.840
 occupy the character that appears to 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.220
 continuation is to say turn that 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.320
 it would be eros appears the light 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.600
 and eye because it puts master that is like 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.950
 teacher and you appear you know this is something 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.200
 quite interesting and quite 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:27.260
 important is to say you know it's going to be 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.510
 paul teacher because because 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.010
 presents like a goat whore in 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:33.230
 any time that is what can 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:35.630
 pluck the head to bolt this guy is 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:37.280
 very crazy I do not see it fit because in car 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.500
 because you have let those that are the 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.060
 master of bolt but good is that is not 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.310
 to appear yes he will be the teacher 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.170
 of voice and there are other things more surprised 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.090
 quite and removing this from those that 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.650
 as a teacher the truth is that I want to see 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.930
 that part because I do not imagine you know that 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:53.060
 as a teacher and we basically see 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:56.119
 that in when the rival word comes out 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:58.040
 appears salty is to say that what I am 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:59.930
 seeing here it seems that the 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.610
 relationship that will be between bolt and 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.220
 salty is not going to be the same relationship that 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.080
 there was in his day between naruto and sakura 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.450
 where naruto was not say sakura no 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.300
 it was Naruto Sakura's rival was the mistress 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.560
 to the bed vain then you have to appear 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.860
 sacred will take the place of those that 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.660
 and sada is going to be bolt's rival and he's not going 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.550
 to be someone who bolt is in love 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.590
 it's just going to be the voice rival and 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.370
 well that's basically what we see in the 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.379
 trailer 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.420
 so we also see a little bit that the 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:28.340
 date really confirms that it is 7 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.720

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.610

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.879
