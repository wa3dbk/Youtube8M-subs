 suppose this is a position 6 

00:00:22.569 --> 00:00:25.759
 able to identify 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:27.279
 a delegation from the 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:30.279
 this dc surpasses 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.510
 when I asked 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.440
 so little 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.130
 it's because you have 6 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:45.159
 means 

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:47.180
 this bait 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.180
 my mother 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.840
 felipe karan 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.080
 Yeah 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:00.230
 dilma may not be a patriotic war that this kitten makes happy 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.790
 and if you put a hand 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.790
 the case 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.500
 the afternoon of attack occurred in the evening 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.400
 they prepare 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.680
 to pack 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.150
 the reason 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:28.990
 he did not break up in the fight with dawn stickers in the region. 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:30.460
 autonomous 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:35.060
 clear in the afternoon with the Pope 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.530
 when this dawn 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.149
 I never imagined that 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:45.359
 you could maintain order and discipline when anyone can use 

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:46.920
 a little bit of criticality 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.420

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.460
 to these problems not only about maintaining order and discipline as 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.420

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:03.250
 When you have a little time, the commentator said, because this is the 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:04.310
 nothing now 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:05.940
 the cup 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:07.380
 and point 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.930
 rafael moura has not been this one yet 

00:02:12.899 --> 00:02:15.459
