going to be a lot more improvements to
the<00:00:40.570> AI<00:00:40.980> we<00:00:41.980> went<00:00:42.550> with<00:00:42.730> all<00:00:43.030> new<00:00:43.269> neural<00:00:43.690> Nets

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:43.960

the AI we went with all new neural Nets
including<00:00:44.920> we<00:00:45.010> have<00:00:45.430> neural<00:00:45.879> nets<00:00:46.030> for<00:00:46.300> the

including we have neural nets for the

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.150 
including we have neural nets for the
naval<00:00:46.720> platoons<00:00:47.050> now<00:00:47.290> so<00:00:47.680> they<00:00:47.980> will<00:00:48.100> be

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:48.160 
naval platoons now so they will be

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.009 
naval platoons now so they will be
controlled<00:00:48.550> by<00:00:48.640> neural<00:00:48.910> nets<00:00:49.089> which<00:00:49.900> is

00:00:50.009 --> 00:00:50.019 
controlled by neural nets which is

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:52.079

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
a big significant change in the AI

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.260 
a big significant change in the AI
behavior<00:01:27.729> since<00:01:28.000> launch<00:01:28.800> the<00:01:29.800> AI<00:01:29.979> today<00:01:30.670> is<00:01:30.880> is

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
behavior since launch the AI today is is

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.719 
behavior since launch the AI today is is
much<00:01:31.660> more<00:01:31.840> challenging<00:01:32.110> than<00:01:32.440> it<00:01:32.619> was<00:01:32.800> at

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:33.729 
much more challenging than it was at

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:35.820 
much more challenging than it was at
launch<00:01:34.090> I<00:01:34.390> tend<00:01:34.840> to<00:01:34.929> play<00:01:35.110> a<00:01:35.140> lot<00:01:35.380> now<00:01:35.590> with

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:35.830 
launch I tend to play a lot now with

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:37.589 
launch I tend to play a lot now with
nukes<00:01:36.099> turned<00:01:36.429> off<00:01:36.610> because<00:01:36.910> the<00:01:37.209> AI<00:01:37.390> has

00:01:37.589 --> 00:01:37.599 
nukes turned off because the AI has

00:01:37.599 --> 00:01:40.499 
nukes turned off because the AI has

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
and fire it at you which would give you

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:53.279

the AI today tends to build like two to
three<00:01:56.319> nukes<00:01:56.800> and<00:01:57.039> will<00:01:57.369> fire<00:01:57.750> typically<00:01:58.750> like

00:01:58.979 --> 00:01:58.989 
three nukes and will fire typically like

three nukes and will fire typically like

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:00.910 
three nukes on its first salvo which

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:03.029 
three nukes on its first salvo which
gives<00:02:01.149> you<00:02:01.270> less<00:02:01.450> morning<00:02:01.959> that<00:02:02.289> that<00:02:02.890> it's

going nucular so whereas in the old days
we<00:02:05.890> could<00:02:06.039> build<00:02:06.160> up<00:02:06.340> a<00:02:06.429> wall<00:02:06.670> of<00:02:07.030> defense<00:02:07.420> and

we could build up a wall of defense and

we could build up a wall of defense and
we<00:02:07.750> knew<00:02:07.869> that<00:02:07.899> the<00:02:08.110> day<00:02:08.140> I<00:02:08.259> would<00:02:08.530> just

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
we knew that the day I would just

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:11.400 
we knew that the day I would just
continually<00:02:09.340> push<00:02:10.060> against<00:02:10.479> that<00:02:10.660> wall<00:02:10.869> we're

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
continually push against that wall we're

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.559 
continually push against that wall we're
seeing<00:02:11.800> AI<00:02:12.010> that<00:02:12.400> now<00:02:12.520> will<00:02:12.730> teleport<00:02:13.060> behind

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
seeing AI that now will teleport behind

that<00:02:13.780> wall<00:02:14.020> and<00:02:14.200> start<00:02:14.470> attacking<00:02:14.560> you're

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:15.099 
that wall and start attacking you're

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:17.400 
that wall and start attacking you're

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
here at your base where you have perhaps

junior tester here at gas powered games
and<00:02:24.330> here<00:02:25.330> to<00:02:25.420> talk<00:02:25.569> about<00:02:25.660> the<00:02:25.870> AI<00:02:25.959> but<00:02:26.950> before

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
and here to talk about the AI but before

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:28.699 
and here to talk about the AI but before
where<00:02:27.610> you<00:02:27.730> can<00:02:27.879> do<00:02:28.000> is<00:02:28.150> you<00:02:28.270> could<00:02:28.390> fight

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
where you can do is you could fight

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:32.339 
where you can do is you could fight
three<00:02:29.709> or<00:02:29.830> four<00:02:29.890> hard<00:02:30.750> definitely<00:02:31.750> want<00:02:32.230> to

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:32.349 
three or four hard definitely want to

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:33.929 
three or four hard definitely want to
put<00:02:32.530> in<00:02:32.620> some<00:02:32.650> cheating<00:02:33.069> if<00:02:33.340> you<00:02:33.549> wanted<00:02:33.849> to

00:02:33.929 --> 00:02:33.939 
put in some cheating if you wanted to

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:35.380 
put in some cheating if you wanted to
just<00:02:34.090> have<00:02:34.269> some<00:02:34.450> challenge

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
just have some challenge

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.010 
just have some challenge
now<00:02:36.319> the<00:02:36.380> AI<00:02:36.890> uses<00:02:37.610> their<00:02:37.850> resources<00:02:38.300> very

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
now the AI uses their resources very

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.470 
now the AI uses their resources very
well<00:02:39.290> there<00:02:39.980> is<00:02:40.430> also<00:02:40.700> a<00:02:40.850> lot<00:02:41.000> more<00:02:41.120> efficient

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
well there is also a lot more efficient

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.690 
well there is also a lot more efficient
about<00:02:41.690> where<00:02:41.990> it<00:02:42.110> wants<00:02:42.350> to<00:02:42.380> go<00:02:42.470> down<00:02:42.800> the

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
about where it wants to go down the

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.610 
about where it wants to go down the
research<00:02:44.060> menu<00:02:44.390> we<00:02:44.750> looked<00:02:45.140> at<00:02:45.260> some<00:02:45.410> of<00:02:45.440> our

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
research menu we looked at some of our

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.550 
research menu we looked at some of our
top<00:02:45.800> players<00:02:46.130> and<00:02:46.520> so<00:02:47.450> how<00:02:47.810> they<00:02:48.080> like<00:02:48.290> to<00:02:48.440> go

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
top players and so how they like to go

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.070 
top players and so how they like to go
down<00:02:48.709> their<00:02:48.920> research<00:02:49.250> for<00:02:49.580> turtle<00:02:50.030> for<00:02:50.420> air

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
down their research for turtle for air

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.290 
down their research for turtle for air
and<00:02:51.530> then<00:02:52.010> I<00:02:52.100> guess<00:02:52.310> some<00:02:52.760> of<00:02:52.790> the<00:02:52.910> computer

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
and then I guess some of the computer

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.240 
and then I guess some of the computer

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
Wizards once they got that in place they
