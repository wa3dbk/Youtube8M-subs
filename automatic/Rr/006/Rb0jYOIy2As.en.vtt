00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
microtubules as you can see there's lots

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:55.970 
microtubules as you can see there's lots
of<00:02:50.620> different<00:02:50.680> parts<00:02:51.310> to<00:02:52.000> a<00:02:52.330> typical<00:02:52.900> cell<00:02:53.140> and

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
of different parts to a typical cell and

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.980 
of different parts to a typical cell and
finally<00:02:56.980> let's<00:02:57.190> look<00:02:57.340> at<00:02:57.610> cell<00:02:58.450> membranes<00:02:58.960> and

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:00.990 
finally let's look at cell membranes and

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:03.690 
finally let's look at cell membranes and
the<00:03:01.990> cell<00:03:02.200> membrane<00:03:02.230> can<00:03:02.860> be<00:03:03.010> explained<00:03:03.430> using

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
the cell membrane can be explained using

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.860 
the cell membrane can be explained using
the<00:03:04.090> fluid<00:03:04.480> mosaic<00:03:04.690> model<00:03:05.020> and<00:03:06.630> the<00:03:07.630> main

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
the fluid mosaic model and the main

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.310 
the fluid mosaic model and the main
components<00:03:08.470> of<00:03:08.650> cell<00:03:08.980> membranes<00:03:09.840> include<00:03:10.840> the

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
components of cell membranes include the

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.070 
components of cell membranes include the
phospholipid<00:03:12.130> bilayer<00:03:12.720> proteins<00:03:13.720> and

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 
phospholipid bilayer proteins and

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.010 
phospholipid bilayer proteins and
cholesterol<00:03:14.470> and<00:03:15.480> speaking<00:03:16.480> of<00:03:16.570> proteins

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:17.020 
cholesterol and speaking of proteins

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:19.920 
cholesterol and speaking of proteins
there's<00:03:17.380> two<00:03:17.709> main<00:03:17.920> types<00:03:18.480> integral<00:03:19.480> proteins

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
there's two main types integral proteins

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.890 
there's two main types integral proteins
and<00:03:20.230> peripheral<00:03:21.070> proteins<00:03:21.160> and<00:03:21.900> integral

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
and peripheral proteins and integral

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.690 
and peripheral proteins and integral
proteins<00:03:23.350> are<00:03:23.620> found<00:03:23.890> in<00:03:24.160> between

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
proteins are found in between

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.990 
proteins are found in between
phospholipid<00:03:25.420> molecules<00:03:26.110> while<00:03:27.000> peripheral

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
phospholipid molecules while peripheral

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.150 
phospholipid molecules while peripheral
proteins<00:03:28.330> are<00:03:28.900> found<00:03:29.230> outside<00:03:29.530> the

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
proteins are found outside the

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.410 
proteins are found outside the
phospholipid<00:03:31.090> bilayer<00:03:31.600> and<00:03:32.910> this<00:03:33.910> is<00:03:34.150> what

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
phospholipid bilayer and this is what

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.640 
phospholipid bilayer and this is what
the<00:03:34.990> cell<00:03:35.200> membrane<00:03:35.230> looks<00:03:35.890> like<00:03:37.500> thank<00:03:38.500> you

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
the cell membrane looks like thank you

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.250 
the cell membrane looks like thank you
