this<00:00:32.610> is<00:00:33.390> named<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:34.140> survivor<00:00:35.030> it's<00:00:36.030> intended

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
this is named the survivor it's intended

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.729 
this is named the survivor it's intended
to<00:00:36.780> be<00:00:37.050> a<00:00:37.350> bit<00:00:38.100> more<00:00:38.129> rugged<00:00:39.079> style<00:00:40.079> a<00:00:40.320> bit<00:00:40.350> more

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
to be a bit more rugged style a bit more

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.250 
to be a bit more rugged style a bit more
of<00:00:40.800> a<00:00:42.110> rugged<00:00:44.480> computer<00:00:45.480> lifestyle<00:00:46.050> or

of a rugged computer lifestyle or
whatever<00:00:46.559> you<00:00:46.680> want<00:00:46.860> to<00:00:46.920> call<00:00:47.100> it<00:00:47.160> something

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
whatever you want to call it something

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.240 
whatever you want to call it something
that<00:00:48.180> you<00:00:48.300> can<00:00:48.510> actually<00:00:48.660> carry<00:00:49.500> around<00:00:49.770> if

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
that you can actually carry around if

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.069 
that you can actually carry around if
you<00:00:50.370> want<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:50.789> take<00:00:51.059> it<00:00:51.090> to<00:00:51.300> LAN<00:00:51.480> parties<00:00:51.930> or

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
you want to take it to LAN parties or

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.020 
you want to take it to LAN parties or
your<00:00:52.199> body<00:00:52.350> cells<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:54.860> it's<00:00:55.860> not<00:00:56.070> rugged<00:00:56.610> in

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
your body cells and it's not rugged in

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.080 
your body cells and it's not rugged in
the<00:00:57.180> sense<00:00:57.510> that<00:00:57.739> it's<00:00:58.739> uglier<00:00:59.550> looks<00:00:59.879> like<00:01:00.059> a

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
the sense that it's uglier looks like a

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.590 
the sense that it's uglier looks like a
tractor<00:01:00.829> it's<00:01:01.829> still<00:01:02.579> kind<00:01:02.879> of<00:01:02.969> clean<00:01:03.210> design

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
tractor it's still kind of clean design

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.100 
tractor it's still kind of clean design
which<00:01:03.870> we<00:01:04.049> like<00:01:04.260> here<00:01:04.820> but<00:01:05.820> it's<00:01:06.659> quite

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
which we like here but it's quite

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.810 
which we like here but it's quite
rubberized<00:01:08.100> this<00:01:09.090> is<00:01:09.240> something<00:01:09.540> that<00:01:09.659> you

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
rubberized this is something that you

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.390 
rubberized this is something that you
cannot<00:01:11.820> actually<00:01:12.720> feel<00:01:13.229> with<00:01:13.860> your<00:01:13.950> visuals

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
cannot actually feel with your visuals

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.820 
cannot actually feel with your visuals
there<00:01:14.670> you<00:01:14.760> go<00:01:14.880> Cameron<00:01:15.270> touch<00:01:15.450> it<00:01:15.659> this<00:01:16.409> is<00:01:16.619> an

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
there you go Cameron touch it this is an

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.109 
there you go Cameron touch it this is an
extremely<00:01:17.790> smooth<00:01:18.299> rubber<00:01:18.990> coating<00:01:19.590> it<00:01:20.009> is<00:01:20.729> so

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
extremely smooth rubber coating it is so

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:29.060 
extremely smooth rubber coating it is so
soft<00:01:22.130> and<00:01:26.210> very<00:01:27.210> early<00:01:27.600> prototype<00:01:28.170> yet<00:01:28.740> again

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
soft and very early prototype yet again

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.270 
soft and very early prototype yet again
just<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.549> show<00:01:29.820> you<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:31.009> general<00:01:32.009> concept

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
just to show you the the general concept

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.890 
just to show you the the general concept
working<00:01:33.000> on<00:01:33.119> here<00:01:34.460> again<00:01:35.460> a<00:01:36.119> pretty<00:01:36.659> massive

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
working on here again a pretty massive

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
quite possibly when all the measuring is

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.080 
quite possibly when all the measuring is
done<00:01:54.470> another<00:01:55.470> big<00:01:55.740> fan<00:01:56.040> on<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.340> side<00:01:56.670> panel

done another big fan on the side panel

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.749 
done another big fan on the side panel
this<00:01:57.210> is<00:01:57.390> all<00:01:57.570> mesh<00:01:58.229> this<00:01:58.530> big<00:01:58.799> side<00:01:59.070> panel

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:01.759 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:04.069 

what<00:02:02.759> we're<00:02:02.939> thinking<00:02:03.090> about<00:02:03.360> doing<00:02:03.479> is

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
what we're thinking about doing is

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:09.290 
what we're thinking about doing is
actually<00:02:04.710> use<00:02:05.490> real<00:02:06.030> rubber<00:02:06.390> here<00:02:08.119> along<00:02:09.119> the

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
actually use real rubber here along the

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.059 
actually use real rubber here along the
edges<00:02:09.509> so<00:02:10.259> that

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
edges so that

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:14.789 
edges so that
the<00:02:12.640> survivors<00:02:13.269> should<00:02:13.719> be<00:02:13.840> able<00:02:14.019> to<00:02:14.319> survive

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:14.799 
the survivors should be able to survive

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:18.449 
the survivors should be able to survive
a<00:02:14.859> few<00:02:15.459> bumps<00:02:15.760> if<00:02:16.269> you<00:02:16.870> bring<00:02:17.650> this<00:02:17.920> on<00:02:18.159> the<00:02:18.249> bus

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
a few bumps if you bring this on the bus

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:20.369 
a few bumps if you bring this on the bus
or<00:02:18.790> throw<00:02:19.120> it<00:02:19.239> in<00:02:19.329> the<00:02:19.420> trunk<00:02:19.659> of<00:02:19.780> your<00:02:19.840> car<00:02:19.959> to

can see on top here the is not
mechanically<00:02:46.659> functional<00:02:47.260> yet<00:02:47.409> but<00:02:47.739> this

mechanically functional yet but this

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.300 
mechanically functional yet but this
will<00:02:48.250> be<00:02:48.609> a<00:02:48.849> handle<00:02:49.540> that<00:02:50.079> will<00:02:50.290> pop<00:02:50.650> open<00:02:50.919> like

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
will be a handle that will pop open like

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.050 
will be a handle that will pop open like
so<00:02:52.090> good<00:02:53.019> chunk<00:02:53.349> and<00:02:53.650> you<00:02:54.310> can<00:02:54.519> grab<00:02:54.730> it<00:02:54.879> and

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
so good chunk and you can grab it and

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:00.740 
so good chunk and you can grab it and
carry<00:02:55.329> it<00:02:55.419> away<00:02:56.250> and<00:02:58.829> quite<00:02:59.829> a<00:02:59.859> few<00:02:59.980> other

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
carry it away and quite a few other
