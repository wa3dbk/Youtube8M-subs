sent over a brand new panel which I will

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.170 
sent over a brand new panel which I will
install<00:03:22.090> today

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
install today

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.059

more<00:03:26.400> damage<00:03:27.180> on<00:03:27.299> it<00:03:27.480> so<00:03:28.200> now<00:03:28.709> in<00:03:29.310> order<00:03:29.459> to

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:29.609 
more damage on it so now in order to

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:32.539 
more damage on it so now in order to
place<00:03:30.150> this<00:03:30.329> piece<00:03:30.569> we'll<00:03:31.439> need<00:03:31.650> to<00:03:32.040> loosen

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
place this piece we'll need to loosen

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:35.569 
place this piece we'll need to loosen
the<00:03:32.819> bolts<00:03:33.120> on<00:03:33.359> the<00:03:33.599> front<00:03:33.930> carrying<00:03:34.530> the<00:03:35.129> side

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:35.579 
the bolts on the front carrying the side

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:38.319 
the bolts on the front carrying the side
bottle<00:03:36.329> pairings<00:03:36.659> well<00:03:36.870> that's<00:03:37.140> mat<00:03:37.409> one<00:03:37.650> and

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:38.329 
bottle pairings well that's mat one and

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:42.050 
bottle pairings well that's mat one and
one<00:03:39.329> bolt<00:03:39.569> here<00:03:39.959> it<00:03:40.290> goes<00:03:40.530> near<00:03:41.069> the<00:03:41.159> frame<00:03:41.459> to

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
one bolt here it goes near the frame to

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.569 
one bolt here it goes near the frame to
the<00:03:42.090> tank

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:43.579 
the tank

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:47.050 
the tank
so<00:03:44.579> again<00:03:44.849> we<00:03:45.060> go<00:03:45.209> into<00:03:45.420> our<00:03:45.780> KPM<00:03:46.170> toolkit<00:03:46.799> and

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
so again we go into our KPM toolkit and

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.729 
so again we go into our KPM toolkit and
there's<00:03:48.060> a<00:03:48.150> smaller<00:03:48.569> bolt<00:03:48.870> that<00:03:49.200> came<00:03:49.409> with<00:03:49.590> it

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
there's a smaller bolt that came with it

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:51.800 
there's a smaller bolt that came with it
also<00:03:49.980> has<00:03:50.280> the<00:03:50.400> KTM<00:03:50.819> logo<00:03:51.180> on<00:03:51.299> it<00:03:51.389> very<00:03:51.540> nice

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
also has the KTM logo on it very nice

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.039 
also has the KTM logo on it very nice
and<00:03:52.280> we're<00:03:53.280> going<00:03:53.400> to<00:03:53.459> use<00:03:53.670> it<00:03:53.849> to<00:03:54.659> take<00:03:54.840> off

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
and we're going to use it to take off

00:03:55.049 --> 00:04:01.149 
and we're going to use it to take off
all<00:03:55.379> these<00:03:55.920> bolts<00:03:56.400> on<00:03:56.549> the<00:03:56.730> pairings<00:03:59.870> so

00:04:01.149 --> 00:04:01.159 
all these bolts on the pairings so

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:05.539 
all these bolts on the pairings so
you're<00:04:02.159> taking<00:04:02.340> out<00:04:02.609> two<00:04:03.450> bolts<00:04:03.810> here<00:04:04.549> one

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:05.549 
you're taking out two bolts here one

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:09.080 
you're taking out two bolts here one
here<00:04:06.000> one<00:04:06.599> here<00:04:06.629> and<00:04:07.109> three<00:04:07.769> on<00:04:08.370> the<00:04:08.579> ciphering

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
here one here and three on the ciphering

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.990 
here one here and three on the ciphering
but<00:04:09.780> just<00:04:10.739> also<00:04:10.950> remember<00:04:11.489> that<00:04:11.639> there's<00:04:11.849> an

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
but just also remember that there's an

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.640 
but just also remember that there's an
extra<00:04:12.389> one<00:04:12.540> right<00:04:12.810> underneath<00:04:14.510> here<00:04:15.650> and

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
extra one right underneath here and

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.270 
extra one right underneath here and
after<00:04:17.160> taken<00:04:17.639> out<00:04:17.789> I<00:04:18.120> place<00:04:18.900> the<00:04:19.289> bolts<00:04:19.919> here<00:04:20.039> I

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
after taken out I place the bolts here I

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:21.830 
after taken out I place the bolts here I
like<00:04:20.459> to<00:04:20.489> do<00:04:20.699> it<00:04:20.820> in<00:04:21.060> the<00:04:21.180> shape<00:04:21.389> that<00:04:21.419> I<00:04:21.599> take

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
like to do it in the shape that I take

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.860 
like to do it in the shape that I take
them<00:04:22.380> off<00:04:22.560> in<00:04:22.770> so<00:04:23.009> I<00:04:23.039> could<00:04:23.419> figure<00:04:24.419> out<00:04:24.570> how<00:04:24.810> to

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
them off in so I could figure out how to

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:28.040 
them off in so I could figure out how to
put<00:04:25.110> each<00:04:25.229> one<00:04:25.440> back<00:04:25.620> after<00:04:26.070> I'm<00:04:26.190> done<00:04:27.050> next

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.050 
put each one back after I'm done next

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:32.270 
put each one back after I'm done next
step<00:04:28.289> is<00:04:28.500> just<00:04:28.530> to<00:04:29.360> pop<00:04:30.360> it<00:04:30.510> off<00:04:30.630> and<00:04:31.280> we'll

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
step is just to pop it off and we'll

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.350 
step is just to pop it off and we'll
need<00:04:32.400> to<00:04:32.610> transfer<00:04:33.560> these<00:04:35.150> little<00:04:36.150> thingies

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
need to transfer these little thingies

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.430 
need to transfer these little thingies
onto<00:04:36.870> the<00:04:36.960> new<00:04:37.110> one<00:04:37.349> and<00:04:37.580> bolt<00:04:38.580> it<00:04:38.699> back<00:04:38.760> up<00:04:39.440> so

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 
onto the new one and bolt it back up so

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.520 
onto the new one and bolt it back up so
now<00:04:40.470> it's<00:04:40.770> just<00:04:40.830> a<00:04:41.070> matter<00:04:41.250> of<00:04:42.380> putting<00:04:43.380> the

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
now it's just a matter of putting the

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.800 
now it's just a matter of putting the
bearing<00:04:44.010> back<00:04:44.190> on<00:04:44.400> it's<00:04:45.240> a<00:04:45.300> little<00:04:45.539> tricky

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
bearing back on it's a little tricky

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:51.020 
bearing back on it's a little tricky
here<00:04:46.490> attaching<00:04:47.490> to<00:04:47.729> the<00:04:48.620> front<00:04:49.620> fairing<00:04:50.130> it's

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
here attaching to the front fairing it's

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:52.730 
here attaching to the front fairing it's
almost<00:04:51.240> like<00:04:51.419> a<00:04:51.449> Lego<00:04:51.780> piece<00:04:52.199> that<00:04:52.409> has<00:04:52.530> to

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 
almost like a Lego piece that has to

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:56.390 
almost like a Lego piece that has to
snap<00:04:52.979> together<00:04:53.539> but<00:04:54.590> be<00:04:55.590> patient<00:04:55.800> about<00:04:56.099> it

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 
snap together but be patient about it

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.180 
snap together but be patient about it
don't<00:04:57.270> break<00:04:57.539> anything<00:04:57.900> and<00:04:58.380> don't<00:04:58.919> force

00:04:59.180 --> 00:04:59.190 
don't break anything and don't force

00:04:59.190 --> 00:04:59.719 
don't break anything and don't force
anything

00:04:59.719 --> 00:04:59.729 
anything

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:04.330 
anything
and<00:05:00.169> you<00:05:01.169> should<00:05:01.349> pop<00:05:01.560> it<00:05:01.770> into<00:05:01.949> place

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:04.340 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:10.189 

like<00:05:05.340> so<00:05:06.560> and<00:05:08.449> now<00:05:09.449> it's<00:05:09.689> just<00:05:09.810> a<00:05:09.900> matter<00:05:10.080> of

00:05:10.189 --> 00:05:10.199 
like so and now it's just a matter of

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:13.399 
like so and now it's just a matter of
bolting<00:05:11.039> everything<00:05:11.129> back<00:05:11.610> up<00:05:11.639> and<00:05:12.289> should<00:05:13.289> be

00:05:13.399 --> 00:05:13.409 
bolting everything back up and should be

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:14.800
