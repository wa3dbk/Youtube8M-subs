we're not able to do that we know that

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:04.499 
we're not able to do that we know that
we<00:01:02.389> put<00:01:02.659> in<00:01:02.779> our<00:01:02.899> time<00:01:03.139> at<00:01:03.319> the<00:01:03.350> range<00:01:03.679> and

we could to prepare for that hunt a lot
of<00:01:10.609> ranges<00:01:11.020> will<00:01:12.020> be<00:01:12.829> between<00:01:13.100> 35<00:01:13.729> and<00:01:13.759> 40

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:16.909 
yards for a recurve shooter and I would

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:18.700 
yards for a recurve shooter and I would
say<00:01:17.119> at<00:01:17.270> least<00:01:17.299> for<00:01:17.659> myself<00:01:18.020> that's<00:01:18.380> pushing

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
say at least for myself that's pushing

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.620 
say at least for myself that's pushing
the<00:01:18.890> envelope<00:01:19.130> of<00:01:19.579> what<00:01:19.640> I<00:01:19.820> would<00:01:20.060> shoot<00:01:20.359> I

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
the envelope of what I would shoot I

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.740 
the envelope of what I would shoot I
would<00:01:20.990> prefer<00:01:21.320> a<00:01:21.500> shot<00:01:21.859> around<00:01:22.189> 20<00:01:22.549> yards<00:01:22.939> we

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
would prefer a shot around 20 yards we

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.060 
would prefer a shot around 20 yards we
have<00:01:23.869> a<00:01:23.899> target<00:01:24.320> downrange<00:01:24.500> here<00:01:25.240> about<00:01:26.530> 35<00:01:27.530> 40

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
have a target downrange here about 35 40

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.999 
have a target downrange here about 35 40
yards<00:01:28.369> I<00:01:28.460> think<00:01:28.640> we're<00:01:28.789> at<00:01:28.880> 36<00:01:29.509> yards<00:01:29.899> here<00:01:30.109> and

downhill we're just going to take a shot
down<00:01:37.310> there<00:01:37.490> see<00:01:38.030> what<00:01:38.179> kind<00:01:38.390> of<00:01:38.509> penetration

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
down there see what kind of penetration

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
let's see what kind of penetration we

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.450 
let's see what kind of penetration we
get<00:02:47.780> out<00:02:47.930> of<00:02:47.960> that<00:02:50.560> that's<00:02:51.560> not<00:02:51.740> bad<00:02:51.980> for<00:02:52.010> a

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:52.460 
get out of that that's not bad for a

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.390 
get out of that that's not bad for a
recurve<00:02:52.820> bow<00:02:53.200> we<00:02:54.200> get<00:02:54.350> a<00:02:54.380> broad<00:02:54.650> head<00:02:54.950> on<00:02:55.160> that

we're<00:02:55.730> gonna<00:02:55.850> get<00:02:56.030> better<00:02:56.270> penetration<00:02:56.870> and

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
we're gonna get better penetration and

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.240 
we're gonna get better penetration and
languor<00:02:59.030> point<00:02:59.270> was<00:02:59.360> just<00:02:59.690> about<00:03:00.250> probably

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
languor point was just about probably

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.180 
languor point was just about probably
about<00:03:01.460> an<00:03:02.360> inch<00:03:02.540> and<00:03:02.690> a<00:03:02.720> half<00:03:02.750> to<00:03:02.930> two<00:03:03.110> inches

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
about an inch and a half to two inches

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.030 
about an inch and a half to two inches
off<00:03:04.190> of<00:03:04.420> what<00:03:05.420> would<00:03:05.570> have<00:03:05.660> been<00:03:05.750> full<00:03:06.020> drop<00:03:06.350> so

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
off of what would have been full drop so

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.880 
off of what would have been full drop so
in<00:03:07.190> other<00:03:07.310> words<00:03:07.550> my<00:03:08.030> draw<00:03:08.300> was<00:03:08.600> not<00:03:08.870> all<00:03:09.560> the

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
in other words my draw was not all the

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:12.820 
in other words my draw was not all the
way<00:03:10.010> at<00:03:10.370> the<00:03:10.820> complete<00:03:11.210> Anchor<00:03:11.600> Point<00:03:11.830> so

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
way at the complete Anchor Point so

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:14.700 
way at the complete Anchor Point so
that's<00:03:13.430> that's<00:03:13.640> good<00:03:13.970> penetration

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:14.710 
that's that's good penetration

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:17.640 
that's that's good penetration
