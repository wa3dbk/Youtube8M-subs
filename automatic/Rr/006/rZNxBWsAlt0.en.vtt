00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 In this video I'll show you how to decorate 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:08.160
 a cake topped with American pasta 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.139
 you will learn how to use the 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.940
 confectionery with real icing 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.190
 you will learn the techniques like 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.680
 cut and apply the American paste 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:21.300
 you will use in weddings birthdays 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:24.449
 and in celebrations of the confectionery school 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:28.890
 In the evening you will need 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:32.399
 To Make This Recipe Real Adhesive Glaze 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:36.540
 American dye in gel in yellow color 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:39.809
 here I have a cake is ready already 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.730
 covered with American briefcase and if you 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.050
 You want to know a little more about 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.629
 how to cover 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.660
 we have a video that teaches step to 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:52.829
 step of how to get here at this stage 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:55.739
 We're going to use a pitanga beak he is. 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.600
 medium so I can do 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:01.100
 this decoration 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:05.309
 the idea is that you do the lyrics and 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:08.240
 making the letter e continuously and I 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:12.740
 I will proceed in this way to cover 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.740
 all this side 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:24.070
 a good tip here for you to do this 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:27.330
 I always work the lyrics and finish. 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.780
 on the bottom and then you can 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:33.190
 Continue 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:35.470
 and you will not see the amendment that way 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:37.150
 We did here this work across the 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:39.580
 side of this first goal 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:43.210
 The big tip for this cake I go 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:47.080
 to use the same nozzle doing is works 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:50.290
 differentiated into this white cake from below 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:57.430
 I'm already going to make the letter i a higher one 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:59.410
 in a lower and higher and more 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:02.680
 low 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:03.700
 that way I'm doing all over the 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.270
 side 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:10.510
 I always had to stop at the bottom 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:13.330
 where I can go on making a 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:16.480
 do not be so receptive 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:19.480
 we had a goal here 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:23.350
 to the other doing the motorcycle finish 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:25.420
 in which we have the part already made with 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.260
 and the part that has not yet been 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.820
 made 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.520
 that way you cover these 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:33.520
 imperfections that may come to 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:36.340
 God, now that we have concluded the second 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:39.850
 part is that the proposal in the third part 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:43.420
 of the cake is to make the same move 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:46.120
 but now putting three letters and 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:50.730
 higher an average and a lower 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.730
 so the movement here is the same 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:06.790
 remembering that the peak is also the same 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:09.370
 always ending at the bottom 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.950
 the big secret for you to perform this 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:14.260
 decoration is to do very calmly and 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:17.110
 rest assured that you will arrive here 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:19.030
 at this point where we have already covered the three 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:21.790
 points to leave that cake still 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:24.850
 better and I will now use a 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:27.190
 I'll make a decoration on the 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:30.040
 the cake tray as if it were a 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:32.340
 That's why I'm going to go there. 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:35.830
 to use a smaller spout is a spout 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:39.040
 more closed then the same sleeve of 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:43.140
 I changed the beak and I'll do it 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.140
 then as if it were the beehive 

00:03:51.829 --> 00:04:02.430
 So I 'm joining here and I 'm going to do it. 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:06.299
 this on the back all the people finished a 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:10.590
 Back, I'm going to repeat that same job. 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:11.640
 making two effects of this 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:15.299
 bee house 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:19.019
 you're intercalating is pulling from a 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:22.919
 circle to the other you should start 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:24.690
 in the middle of the circle and goes 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:27.990
 another circle 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:28.800
 This way you will complete this 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.080
 extension 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.360
 now that we have completed the part of the 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.220
 decoration with nozzles and royal icing 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:38.070
 the finishing of it will be done with 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:39.780
 These American Foliage Flowers 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:42.419
 so to make the flowers I will 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:46.530
 always use American briefcase 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:49.800
 kneading before using I'm here 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:52.050
 opening a silicone surface 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:55.199
 you can also open the plastic 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:58.979
 firm that I need a person one 

00:04:55.199 --> 00:05:01.020
 little thinner back of 23mm 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:03.680
 here I have a cutter of the type 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:08.580
 star to make that purple flower 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:11.070
 cutting here using the entire folder 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:12.720
 that shelter how do I need to do these 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:15.419
 flowers and let dry 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:18.300
 the idea is that you put the flowers in 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:20.639
 somewhere that you ofa crooked movement 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:23.580
 even more circular movement here I 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:26.130
 I have a gutter for this kind of 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:29.520
 However, I do not have Roberto. 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:32.669
 What's it like to have this face that I'm going to make a 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:34.949
 I can also make glass containers. 

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:38.729
 this next day's movement will be 

00:05:34.949 --> 00:05:40.139
 I can take it out to make the 

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:44.660
 linen 

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:47.930
 I have here already it be real yellow 

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:55.670
 beak by le and with the beak by the law I 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:58.580
 I will make three dots seen how 

00:05:55.670 --> 00:06:00.200
 easy to make and make these flowers 

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:02.840
 Now I'm going to put these flowers in the 

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.710
 and I 'm going to stick these flowers with 

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:06.620
 Royal icing 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:09.080
 the suggestion here and there these flowers 

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:12.680
 the top bun are low forming a 

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:15.500
 waterfall how do I do this 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:18.800
 note that these flowers they have this is 

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:22.430
 this circumference they are not straight 

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:26.870
 then this idea of ​​movement of flowers 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:29.360
 that's why we did it the day before and 

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:30.890
 now we are commanded this idea of 

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:33.980
 cascade really like it's a 

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:40.930
 cascade of flowers down from the 

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:45.170
 top cake on the floor and here it is again 

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:48.050
 use the imagination I can overlap 

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:51.680
 one flower to another 

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:54.530
 Now that we have finished, we have put the 

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:57.890
 flowers all over the cake I'll observe if 

00:06:54.530 --> 00:07:00.680
 I need to complete with some more 

00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:04.280
 flowers with some space I want to show 

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:07.669
 for you guys putting it to be real I 

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:08.930
 I can overlay a subject on the 

00:07:07.669 --> 00:07:12.140
 other 

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:14.230
 This is our suggestion for a 

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:16.400
 decoration of a cake with american paste 

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:19.090
