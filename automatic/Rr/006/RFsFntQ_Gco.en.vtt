little hairs this will just give off the
most<00:01:02.180> natural<00:01:02.780> appearance<00:01:03.110> and<00:01:03.500> it<00:01:03.590> won't

and what I'm doing now is just giving

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.010 
and what I'm doing now is just giving
myself<00:01:26.850> more<00:01:27.390> of<00:01:27.450> an<00:01:27.540> arch<00:01:27.750> because

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
myself more of an arch because

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.810 
myself more of an arch because
unfortunately<00:01:28.440> I<00:01:28.980> don't<00:01:29.160> have<00:01:29.340> a<00:01:29.490> natural

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
unfortunately I don't have a natural

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.090 
unfortunately I don't have a natural
arch<00:01:30.270> in<00:01:30.570> my<00:01:30.720> brow<00:01:31.020> so<00:01:31.560> I'm<00:01:31.800> just<00:01:31.950> applying

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
arch in my brow so I'm just applying

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.860 
arch in my brow so I'm just applying
that<00:01:32.400> on<00:01:32.550> there<00:01:32.880> just<00:01:33.090> to<00:01:33.240> look<00:01:33.510> it<00:01:33.600> a<00:01:33.660> little

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:33.870 
that on there just to look it a little

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:36.050 
that on there just to look it a little
bit<00:01:34.020> more<00:01:34.170> lifted<00:01:34.710> to<00:01:34.950> lift<00:01:35.160> my<00:01:35.310> eyes<00:01:35.490> upwards

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
bit more lifted to lift my eyes upwards

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.150 
bit more lifted to lift my eyes upwards
and<00:01:36.330> I'm<00:01:36.780> always<00:01:37.020> using<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.710> stroking

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:38.160 
and I'm always using the stroking

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.500 
and I'm always using the stroking
motions<00:01:38.610> that's<00:01:38.820> probably<00:01:39.060> one<00:01:39.240> of<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.390> most

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:39.510 
motions that's probably one of the most

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:45.160 
motions that's probably one of the most
important<00:01:40.050> parts<00:01:40.560> of<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:41.220> way<00:01:41.340> I<00:01:41.370> do<00:01:41.580> my<00:01:41.610> brows

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
then I'm taking these Fuli side and

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.790 
then I'm taking these Fuli side and
