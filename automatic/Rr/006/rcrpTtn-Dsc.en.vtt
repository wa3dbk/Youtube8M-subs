00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:05.399
嘿 YouTube user is Charlie, because everyone is asking me to do the legend of Gona Q&amp;A 

00:00:05.399 --> 00:00:07.840
 I decided this was the last time. Since my last Gona video production team has been reduced 

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.240
 A little bit because they are working hard to complete 3 books and 4 and sound designer Benjamin 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.090
 Wynn will release some non-Gonna original music this year. He has not announced 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:14.920
 When? 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:21.490
 If you haven't seen it yet, I started to make a weekly video of the anime club to fill the huge 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.060
 When the avatar content of the hole leaves, it is not on the TV. I will post a new video 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.010
 ,later this day. Be sure to subscribe to get it. 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:34.749
 Just like the last time I picked up your question 20, so here we go to the 1st - the unjust warrior 

00:00:34.749 --> 00:00:39.280
 241 asks who you think the new villain will be what type of pipe bending machine? will 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.969
 We see toph and her children? 

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:47.199
 So, Gray DELYLE implicitly said in a radio interview that she would play an evil female water 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:50.879
 Bender. This does not mean her main villain, but it will be a similar 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.819
 Case 2 book, which has a super evil person, then there is just a medium 

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:55.389
 Bad guys. 

00:00:55.389 --> 00:00:59.010
 The creator of the species suggests that the Gona will have to solve this big problem. 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.999
 The season will not have any ability to bend with her. So, I guess the main one 

00:01:01.999 --> 00:01:03.940
 The villain is not an evil waterbender. 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.440
 As for toph, because we haven’t seen her grave yet, you can assume that this is her walking around. 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.190
 A country like ZUKO or her life with her family on the ground. Because she will be super 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.330
 old. 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.580
 Book 3 will be all about the land of the kingdom, Lin's family. So even if we don't do this 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.610
 Looking at toph, we will see the rest of the beifongs. 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.540
 Question 2 - Jellybeans 7854 asks Canna to enter the spiritual world and find her past 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.100
 Life is like Aon? 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:27.150
 Now I will say that it is her only way to communicate. 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.400
 they. Where people’s spiritual ideas go, except for the gods, they 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.040
 The mold has not been explored a lot. So until confirmed, let us say that they are 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.130
 The other side of the local portal. 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.430
 Question 3 - Alan Michael asks, you think we will see a new series after the song book 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:41.810
 4. With a new avatar? 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.060
 Not at Nickelodeon and not for the lowest 3-4 years. The creators say they are doing a 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.300
 Book 4 ends after a long break. So, you will see the contents of the avatar in the future. 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.880
 The comic. This will continue, longer than the performance, just because it costs less, so 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:46.880
 And don't take as many people as possible. 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.380
 Honestly, I think, unless Nick changed his mind in 2015, every time book 4 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.860
 Above, the creators will make different non-Gonna animation programs. They are still very 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.820
 Young, so they will definitely have a follow-up project in the end. 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.360
 Question 4 - When Malvape asks, will they release the book 2 score? 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.650
 They haven't announced their official yet, but sometimes before the premiere of Book 3, 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.190
 And I expect this year's late spring or early summer. So you might see that soundtrack 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:06.640
 In a month or two, if not earlier. 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.349
 At the same time, they put the book 1 on Spotify, so you don't have to buy it if you don't 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:10.459
 rich. They will do the same thing for the book 2 soundtrack. So you can 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:11.290
 Listen for free. 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.060
 Question 5 - Jojo Allen asks, can you explain what happened to ZUKO's mother? 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.480
 She changed her identity, her face and her memory, and eventually started a new family. 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.430
 ZUKO found her, but he did not appear in front of her, when he saw how happy she was with 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.639
 Her new life. But he did find her, so he got some closure. 

00:02:26.639 --> 00:02:29.590
 Question 6 - James Palace asks, who got the ball to tap Toph beifong? 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.029
 You ask Lin's father. This is a fairly common problem. most likely 

00:02:34.029 --> 00:02:37.739
 The candidate is the duke. My second guess will be a character, this is not part of 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:40.120
 The original series and others have not seen each other. There are rumors that Lin is 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.209
 Passed, but we won't get an answer until the book 3 premiere. 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.889
 Question 7 - darkwintre ask, would you want to see Book 3? 

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:52.719
 In fact, I want to see sharks and Bolin get more participation in the central plot. in 

00:02:52.719 --> 00:02:56.430
 Book 2, most of them are trapped in the capital to deal with Varrick. If you see the hobbit 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.040
 Then think about it, when they throw people as a unit how dwarves work 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.310
 Around or wash the dishes. I really want to see some good fires and snowballs or action. 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:03.200
 In battle or when they are just snooping the clues. 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.749
 Question 8 - Tommy Shen asks, will they go deeper into the concept of energy bending? 

00:03:07.749 --> 00:03:11.249
 I know what you are asking, they will give us a very descriptive analysis of the mechanism. 

00:03:11.249 --> 00:03:16.299
 The energy behind it bends. No, I don't think so. I don't think there are enough experts 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:20.569
 Energy bending is going to do this. Only the lion sea turtle can really explain it better 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:25.359
 I don't think we will see it until the book 4 is another. 

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:28.999
 Question 9 - Photon Lang Gaogen asks, do you think they will make a plot, Gona and 

00:03:28.999 --> 00:03:30.120
 Mami wants to help each other. 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.309
 I think we will see some different characters matching the UPS. But I don't think we will see 

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:40.469
 Many scenes are only Mami and Gona. The minor characters in Gona did not get 

00:03:40.469 --> 00:03:47.469
 A lot of pictures, just because the plot is so short. 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.049
 I suggest you start writing some fan fiction. As long as it is not too serious, I will 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:53.189
 Leave a message for you completely. 

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:56.859
 Question 10 - Matthew Levis asks you like the last Airbender or Gona? 

00:03:56.859 --> 00:04:01.409
 We will have a lot more air content than Gona now, so I really wait 

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:04.760
 Before I saw books 3 and 4, I made it clear that I liked it more. My opinion tends to 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.109
 Change every year according to what I see new things. So I try not to let the hang on the old 

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:08.889
 There are too many series. 

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:13.059
 Question 11 - Timelord Tannant asks who will win the battle. Toph Beifong or crying 

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:14.840
 Angel? 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.570
 If the angel can make toph not hesitate, they can definitely get her. 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:25.570
 Also, because angels can only move when you don't watch them, toph must constantly 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:29.650
 Use sound waves to the ground and her feet to obtain visual sensory information. 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:36.650
 If they struggle, she wants to win, she must be in the same place all the time. 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:47.630
 Question 12 - Adam Tolentino asks what is the book 2 about your least favorite thing? 

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:54.690
 The amount of time allocated to the secondary figures of developing countries. Because they only have 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:05:01.690
 In the end of the Airbender half of the plot, the secondary characters get almost no time on the screen. and so 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:05.690
 They just don't feel real because there are a lot of characters in the last Airbender. 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:09.940
 Question 13 - and Kristine silmaro asks the creator to have made an animated film 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.310
 Characters, what would you like to see? 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:16.870
 All of these courses. Really, although I hope to see the time this story moves forward. 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:22.060
 But I hope to see the flashback of all the classic characters. There are a lot of 90-minute movies. 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:29.060
 Extra character space. If we did see the movie, what would be the next thing? 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:39.250
 After 4 books, they did. 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:43.460
 Question 15 - Lily Anne Kitty asks, you think the Queen of the Earth will beifong 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:43.970
 sister? 

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:50.300
 I think that the new role opal that Allison Stoner plays is the Queen of the Earth, but I don’t think 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:54.500
 She is with beifong. I think that the family of beifong is really tied to politics. 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:54.990
 Although the land kingdom. 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:59.000
 Question 16 - Sarah Johnson asks what happened to ZUKO? 

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.720
 This is an indication that he is wandering around the world. I think we will see him again 

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:05.040
 Book 4 for a brief introduction. The biggest characters are always Gona, Grey Shark and Berlin, but 

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:08.670
 It does not mean that ZUKO can't show it and help them. 

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:13.650
 Question 17 - sweetkitty 013 multiple requirements are said to be the most important private 

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:18.190
 Budget, planned for a bunch of animated films in 2012 and the final Airbender is one of them 

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:21.190
 idea? What does it mean? 

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:25.920
 This means that the creators have worked with the supreme animated film. They may 

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:29.530
 You have to cast an idea, which means they know who they want to be. But because there is 

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:33.660
 So much money involved and those big deals have blown up a lot, I will wait to hear something 

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:34.900
 From the official creator. 

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:39.570
 Question 18 - Ivo Aboiltes asks you to think that Bolin will learn metalbending forever? 

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:46.570
 Yes, they will be in the country on the ground next season, so what better place to learn. 

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:50.780
 This will mean he needs a lot of scenes with beifong so I can't wait to see super 

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:54.070
 Serious Lin and stupid Bolin tried to communicate. 

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:57.920
 Question 19 - Randall Fisher asked how they dealt with Goa was cut off 

00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:58.710
 Her past life? 

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:05.710
 Yes, this will be an important part of the plot before Gona learns what is going on 

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:12.910
 The kingdom of the earth. They won't go there unless something really important is happening. 

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:17.790
 The last question number 20 - Roberto Mileiro asks, is that we will always learn how to Aon 

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:18.520
 died? 

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:25.520
 This is an indication that he died of natural causes. If it has been murdered or a huge fight 

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:34.340
 The character is likely to mention it when the book is 1. But everyone seems quite peaceful 

00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:43.360
 This matter, I just think that this is to say that he is old. 

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:46.750
 Thank you very much for submitting your question again! This is a lot of fun. I will post
