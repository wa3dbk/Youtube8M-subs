foam windscreen included so let's open
the<00:00:37.290> box<00:00:37.469> and<00:00:38.510> see<00:00:39.510> what<00:00:39.690> we've<00:00:39.899> got

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:52.340 

where<00:00:42.960> is<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.260> instruction<00:00:44.539> manual<00:00:50.300> it<00:00:51.350> tells

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
where is the instruction manual it tells

00:00:52.350 --> 00:01:00.099 
where is the instruction manual it tells
us<00:00:52.710> all<00:00:53.579> we<00:00:54.360> need<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:55.170> know<00:00:55.320> about<00:00:55.469> microphones

00:01:00.099 --> 00:01:00.109 

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:06.770 

yeah<00:01:02.329> after<00:01:03.329> this<00:01:03.570> here<00:01:04.530> is<00:01:04.920> our<00:01:05.780> foam

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
yeah after this here is our foam

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:20.330 
yeah after this here is our foam
windscreen<00:01:17.720> I<00:01:18.720> don't<00:01:19.560> recommend<00:01:19.830> it<00:01:20.159> because

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
windscreen I don't recommend it because

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.810 
windscreen I don't recommend it because
it<00:01:21.320> cuts<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.500> lot<00:01:22.650> of<00:01:22.799> your<00:01:23.009> high<00:01:23.189> frequencies

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
it cuts a lot of your high frequencies

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:30.080 
it cuts a lot of your high frequencies
so<00:01:24.290> while<00:01:25.290> recording<00:01:25.619> use<00:01:26.520> a<00:01:26.549> bow<00:01:26.850> filter<00:01:29.090> this

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
so while recording use a bow filter this

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:42.649 
so while recording use a bow filter this
is<00:01:33.409> and<00:01:34.409> here<00:01:34.680> is<00:01:34.829> our<00:01:35.040> shock<00:01:35.729> mount<00:01:41.659> let's

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
is and here is our shock mount let's

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:53.309 
is and here is our shock mount let's
open<00:01:42.869> this

00:01:53.309 --> 00:01:53.319 

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:58.480 

well<00:01:54.850> it's<00:01:55.850> pretty<00:01:56.810> nice<00:01:57.140> and<00:01:57.439> heavy<00:01:57.679> shock

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
well it's pretty nice and heavy shock

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:07.270 
well it's pretty nice and heavy shock
mount<00:01:58.789> and<00:02:00.939> I<00:02:01.939> think<00:02:02.179> it's<00:02:02.359> quite<00:02:02.600> durable<00:02:06.280> and

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
mount and I think it's quite durable and

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:13.890 
mount and I think it's quite durable and
