00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:32.029
 we arrived Monday morning a 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:34.460
 school after Sunday 6 to a choice 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:36.170
 an article from the republic where he said 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.780
 that to the copernicus was present in the la 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.430
 navigated of the false ceilings of 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.360
 carcinogenic and hazardous material for 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.329
 our health 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.609
 Tuesday afternoon we started 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:49.850
 we have the other two schools 

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:51.649
 stop almost afternoon at night 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.690
 next day I realized that then stay here 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:55.390
 it was n't enough to make us feel for 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.739
 understand what we wanted it was not 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.840
 don't let the school shut down all the costs 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:01.280
 but simply to know what was the 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.670
 real risk we don't stay here we have 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:08.360
 chosen the path of a mobilization not 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:10.700
 against someone but for that is to have 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.409
 transparent information because this 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.509
 we only have the information for 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:16.540
 heard and then we went 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:19.460
 directly to ask the institutions 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:22.070
 during the course of the week we have 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.659
 had the honor of being received of 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.430
 will insert just one day 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:28.189
 meeting with our leading prices 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.960
 district those of the Copernicus 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:32.470
 the councilor of the province and the 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.640
 general manager of asl torino1 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:37.369
 in which were taken 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.320
 decisions to relocate our students 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:39.950
 those of the Copernicus in some locations 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.990
 alternatives 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.340
 Wednesday morning we went ahead 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.740
 at the courthouse 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.990
 we were almost 800 people received 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:51.820
 a small delegation of professors 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.159
 students in the afternoon where we 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:57.789
 move in front of the building of the 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:59.439
 province and we participated in the 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:01.600
 advice with the councilor called vi 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:03.850
 however we understood that we did not have 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.049
 reality even the certainty of them there 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.759
 they had this material if 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:09.280
 really carcinogenic things that 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:11.049
 we ask politics are that the 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.720
 first is that a third is done 

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:16.510
 analysis that clarifies the results of 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.730
 two previous years whose result was 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.690
 discordant with each other a positive e 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.180
 a negative one 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.340
 the second thing we ask is that 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.410
 any decision is made for the 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:29.349
 our luxury school for copernicus 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:33.160
 is taken as a result of the result 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:35.319
 of this third examination that will give certainties 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.720
 we don't want to move until 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:39.790
 there is no such basket 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:43.360
 that is an opinion that in a certain sense 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:45.040
 come from a third party institution with respect to 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.620
 those who have already done or yes 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.900
 even asks another analysis, 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.299
 third thing we ask is that there is 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:56.380
 a guarantee for our safety e 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:58.840
 health of our professors and collaborates 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:01.540
 soy in the new school where we are going 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.340
 raising the afternoon we had invited 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.620
 again the doctor at the table for 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.329
 talk to our students and then from 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.030
 covered by parents and professors who 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:12.370
 however they want clarity and we wait 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.000
 further results from the institution 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.790
 competent 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.280
 we ask to be transferred to a 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:21.099
 adequate way compared to the possibility 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:24.040
 that a school is still a school 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:26.980
 only when this data 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:29.710
 of the risk are assessed as 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:32.890
 effective not when there are two appraisals 

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:35.280
 contrasting and more at 32 than there 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:38.370
 they say good air quality 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:41.140
 drop a stave because these checks 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.760
 they were made if it were not singing 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.010
 where the look now seems to be everything 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.940
 normal if we never know but 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.940
 we would never have known
