00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.490
 They began their journey through the states and support around the issue of 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:06.580
 inventors 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.580
 beck 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:16.929
 success in life men who know how to execute their ideas 

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:21.119
 the author of this phrase was the great inspirer of César Moreno Sanchez 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.839
 Mexican architect engineer who patented the ecological panel an element 

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:29.249
 constructive made from plastic waste 

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:33.969
 at 48 years of age this invention recalls that that phrase was bequeathed from its 

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:36.190
 father josé moreno rodríguez 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:41.230
 he heard it thousands of times during his childhood but for him being an inventor was 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.270
 an unattainable longing although he always had the desire for languages 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.910
 invent something 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:47.960
 have to 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.290
 arise from a 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.090
 lack of something of a need 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.250
 for a problem to solve brown Caesar says that perhaps his stay in the 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:58.830
 ranch san ysidro the moral 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:02.820
 located in the municipality allows them where he lived part of his childhood and 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:03.789
 adolescence 

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:05.980
 and helped develop their creativity 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:09.560
 it is a distant place 8 kilometers away from the population more 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.940
 close without public transport water or light so when there were needs 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.290
 he had to contrive them just like his brothers to solve them 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.110
 in the year 2000 precisely in this place his innovative interest was born 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.619
 we have a problem here is the plastic 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:29.030
 here is the cardboard the paper what we do with it 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.290
 it's much more expensive to take it and 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.270
 this transform recycle it 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.200
 Of course we have no other alternative 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.560
 that burn it country comes then he 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.890
 the challenge 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.580
 to do something 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:45.870
 That 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:47.000
 the different 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.250
 to continue polluting with the support of homemade instruments 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.690
 began to do the tests of what would later be the ecological panel 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:57.400
 also known as thermal wall 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:02.060
 Constructive element that is justified thermally more resistant 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.380
 lighter and more economical 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.640
 than traditional materials for construction 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.730
 we thought astrid our products and everything with the scales with which 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.309
 they use to do 

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:16.639
 the food for cattle 

00:02:16.639 --> 00:02:18.749
 o'shea artiñano there is someone to go 

00:02:18.749 --> 00:02:22.659
 adapting to the circumstances p taking advantage of what you have 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:27.400
 And not to say that nothing else is that the state of the polytechnic institute 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.460
 national 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:34.329
 obtained in 2004 the patent number 220 thousand 242 

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:37.079
 that gave him recognition as an inventor 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:40.189
 to fish from those who doubted their idea 

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:41.129
 forever 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:45.150
 There was someone who told me I was crazy and there is still someone who tells me that I am 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.209
 crazy when they just start to know the product somehow it's already a 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:51.829
 custom besides thank you 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:54.040
 why an idea that does not contain madness 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.379
 it will not transcend 

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:57.279
 that is 

00:02:57.279 --> 00:02:59.209
 this 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:01.629
 this rise in sea level 

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:06.019
 a little madness no yes no brown césar already has seen the first fruits 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:07.299
 of his invention 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:10.799
 to date he has made eight works among them 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:14.849
 the first now ecological karma of the world in technical secondary school 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:17.949
 number 5 of the municipality of nanacamilpa 

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:22.089
 the first thermo-ecological residence in the world that is located in the community 

00:03:22.089 --> 00:03:26.109
 of san diego metepec and is owned by apple cuesta galicia 

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:30.319
 hunt the socks committed to the environment and their own home 

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:35.359
 this house that towed logic result of a Mexican fire 

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:38.769
 that with perseverance managed to transform materials harmful to the environment 

00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:41.209
 San Miguel de Allende 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:44.719
 of the combination of cinema and television radio from tlaxcala to solórzano 

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:45.769
