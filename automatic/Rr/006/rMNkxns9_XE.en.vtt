I guess fizzled out on the back hey on
the<00:00:54.379> side<00:00:54.650> a<00:00:54.920> stack<00:00:55.250> card<00:00:56.170> not<00:00:57.170> that<00:00:57.290> you<00:00:57.440> can

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:57.650 
the side a stack card not that you can

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:00.070 
the side a stack card not that you can
really<00:00:57.830> cut<00:00:58.190> this<00:00:58.339> out<00:00:58.519> I<00:00:58.970> don't<00:00:59.479> I<00:00:59.720> wouldn't

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:00.080 
really cut this out I don't I wouldn't

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.869 
really cut this out I don't I wouldn't
suggest<00:01:00.260> cutting<00:01:00.710> out<00:01:00.979> the<00:01:01.159> side<00:01:01.400> of<00:01:01.430> the<00:01:01.640> can

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:01.879 
suggest cutting out the side of the can

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:03.700 
suggest cutting out the side of the can
and<00:01:02.150> keeping<00:01:02.570> it<00:01:02.690> that<00:01:03.229> would<00:01:03.350> be<00:01:03.470> extremely

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
and keeping it that would be extremely

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.780 
and keeping it that would be extremely
sharp<00:01:05.470> also<00:01:06.470> down<00:01:06.619> below<00:01:06.650> looks<00:01:07.369> like<00:01:07.520> you<00:01:07.640> can

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 
sharp also down below looks like you can

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.740 
sharp also down below looks like you can
pick<00:01:07.940> up<00:01:08.090> several<00:01:08.510> different<00:01:09.170> ciders<00:01:10.750> perhaps

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:11.750 
pick up several different ciders perhaps

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.080 
pick up several different ciders perhaps
each<00:01:11.960> one<00:01:12.170> would<00:01:12.320> be<00:01:12.440> a<00:01:12.470> different<00:01:12.710> flavor

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
each one would be a different flavor

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:18.370 
each one would be a different flavor
there<00:01:14.090> are<00:01:14.180> six<00:01:14.540> to<00:01:14.720> choose<00:01:14.960> from<00:01:15.200> and<00:01:17.380> aside

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
there are six to choose from and aside

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.469 
there are six to choose from and aside
from<00:01:18.409> that<00:01:18.650> let's<00:01:19.549> see<00:01:19.700> if<00:01:19.790> I<00:01:19.880> can<00:01:19.909> even<00:01:20.240> find

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:20.479 
from that let's see if I can even find

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:21.820 
from that let's see if I can even find
calories<00:01:21.080> so<00:01:21.170> I<00:01:21.200> can<00:01:21.350> tell<00:01:21.470> you<00:01:21.560> it's<00:01:21.680> three

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
sprite it kind of tastes like a sprite

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.820 
sprite it kind of tastes like a sprite
with<00:02:25.730> a<00:02:25.760> few<00:02:26.120> hints<00:02:26.420> of<00:02:26.660> an<00:02:26.870> energy<00:02:27.290> drink<00:02:27.590> to

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
with a few hints of an energy drink to

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.290 
with a few hints of an energy drink to
it<00:02:28.010> so<00:02:28.160> perhaps<00:02:28.340> there<00:02:28.640> is<00:02:28.730> some<00:02:29.030> sort<00:02:29.240> of

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
it so perhaps there is some sort of

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.030 
it so perhaps there is some sort of
energy<00:02:29.780> ingredients<00:02:30.530> inside<00:02:31.460> this<00:02:31.910> cider<00:02:32.450> can

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
energy ingredients inside this cider can

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.630 
energy ingredients inside this cider can
it<00:02:34.040> does<00:02:34.250> taste<00:02:34.520> like<00:02:34.670> sprite<00:02:35.210> though<00:02:35.480> and<00:02:36.640> I

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
it does taste like sprite though and I

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.790 
it does taste like sprite though and I
guess<00:02:37.850> if<00:02:38.060> from<00:02:38.420> the<00:02:38.570> realm<00:02:38.810> of<00:02:38.990> energy<00:02:39.380> drinks

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
guess if from the realm of energy drinks

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.260 
guess if from the realm of energy drinks
it's<00:02:39.950> one<00:02:40.100> of<00:02:40.190> the<00:02:40.280> better<00:02:40.459> ones<00:02:40.580> it's

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 
it's one of the better ones it's

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:43.660 
it's one of the better ones it's
refreshing<00:02:41.690> it's<00:02:42.110> not<00:02:42.440> overpowering<00:02:42.830> it's

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
refreshing it's not overpowering it's

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.710 
refreshing it's not overpowering it's
actually<00:02:43.970> quite<00:02:44.120> mild<00:02:44.480> indeed<00:02:46.450> if<00:02:47.450> you<00:02:47.570> are<00:02:47.690> a

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
actually quite mild indeed if you are a

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.500
