catches<00:00:39.830> I<00:00:40.250> know<00:00:40.760> the<00:00:40.970> standard<00:00:41.360> is<00:00:41.510> higher<00:00:41.650> in

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:42.650 
catches I know the standard is higher in

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:44.440 
catches I know the standard is higher in
China<00:00:43.010> I<00:00:43.190> think<00:00:43.220> it<00:00:43.550> could<00:00:43.880> have<00:00:43.970> been<00:00:44.180> the

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:44.450 
China I think it could have been the

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.260 
China I think it could have been the
last<00:00:44.480> Olympics<00:00:45.280> it's<00:00:46.280> pretty<00:00:46.670> exciting

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:47.270 
last Olympics it's pretty exciting

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.870 
last Olympics it's pretty exciting
and<00:00:47.540> so<00:00:47.960> the<00:00:48.110> program<00:00:48.560> of<00:00:49.130> course<00:00:49.400> is<00:00:49.670> always

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:49.880 
and so the program of course is always

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.420 
and so the program of course is always
increasing<00:00:50.660> in<00:00:50.750> intensity<00:00:51.200> as<00:00:51.590> the<00:00:51.920> athletes

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
increasing in intensity as the athletes

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.820 
increasing in intensity as the athletes
get<00:00:52.610> better<00:00:52.850> so<00:00:53.180> you<00:00:53.240> step<00:00:53.660> up<00:00:53.780> the<00:00:53.960> load<00:00:54.170> it's

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:54.830 
get better so you step up the load it's

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:57.100 
get better so you step up the load it's
like<00:00:55.010> in<00:00:55.220> a<00:00:55.310> gymnasium<00:00:55.700> you<00:00:56.330> know<00:00:56.510> a<00:00:56.540> guy<00:00:56.870> can

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:57.110 
like in a gymnasium you know a guy can

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.710 
like in a gymnasium you know a guy can
lift<00:00:57.290> 200<00:00:57.530> kilos<00:00:58.220> and<00:00:58.580> put<00:00:59.030> on<00:00:59.210> a<00:00:59.240> few<00:00:59.540> ounces

00:00:59.710 --> 00:00:59.720 
lift 200 kilos and put on a few ounces

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.930 
lift 200 kilos and put on a few ounces
and<00:01:00.230> keep<00:01:00.410> adding<00:01:00.740> the<00:01:00.860> ounces<00:01:01.250> and<00:01:01.520> so<00:01:01.850> of

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
and keep adding the ounces and so of

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.580 
and keep adding the ounces and so of
course<00:01:02.150> it's<00:01:02.390> going<00:01:02.630> to<00:01:02.720> be<00:01:02.870> more<00:01:03.050> intensive

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:03.590 
course it's going to be more intensive

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.620 
course it's going to be more intensive
than<00:01:03.620> last<00:01:03.920> year<00:01:04.250> but<00:01:04.640> not<00:01:04.820> just<00:01:05.150> because<00:01:05.480> it's

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
than last year but not just because it's

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.660 
than last year but not just because it's
Olympics<00:01:06.200> because<00:01:06.800> of<00:01:06.950> the<00:01:07.070> state<00:01:07.280> of<00:01:07.520> the

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
Olympics because of the state of the

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.999 
Olympics because of the state of the
athletes

00:01:11.999 --> 00:01:12.009 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:15.090 

we<00:01:12.520> didn't<00:01:12.759> use<00:01:12.789> the<00:01:13.000> word<00:01:13.030> pain<00:01:14.100> because

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
we didn't use the word pain because

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.090 
we didn't use the word pain because
that's<00:01:15.880> obviously<00:01:16.270> a<00:01:16.329> negative<00:01:16.780> in<00:01:16.899> itself<00:01:17.229> we

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100 
that's obviously a negative in itself we

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.669 
that's obviously a negative in itself we
train<00:01:18.369> this<00:01:18.520> hard<00:01:18.579> so<00:01:18.939> that<00:01:18.969> on<00:01:19.689> a<00:01:20.049> bad<00:01:20.289> day<00:01:20.469> we

00:01:20.669 --> 00:01:20.679 
train this hard so that on a bad day we

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:22.289 
train this hard so that on a bad day we
can<00:01:20.860> still<00:01:21.250> win<00:01:21.340> the<00:01:21.429> gold<00:01:21.640> and<00:01:21.939> that's<00:01:22.090> that's

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:22.299 
can still win the gold and that's that's

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:23.850 
can still win the gold and that's that's
the<00:01:22.570> bottom<00:01:22.689> line<00:01:23.020> that's<00:01:23.229> pretty<00:01:23.710> much

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860 
the bottom line that's pretty much

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.429 
the bottom line that's pretty much
pretty<00:01:24.429> much<00:01:24.490> everybody's<00:01:25.030> mantra<00:01:25.420> in<00:01:25.570> the<00:01:26.079> in

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:26.439 
pretty much everybody's mantra in the in

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:28.380 
pretty much everybody's mantra in the in
the<00:01:26.560> boat<00:01:26.740> is<00:01:26.920> that<00:01:26.970> we're<00:01:27.970> training<00:01:28.210> this

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390

00:01:33.419 --> 00:01:33.429 
good day when we all sync up it's so

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:35.309 
good day when we all sync up it's so
that<00:01:33.579> we<00:01:33.670> can<00:01:33.850> we<00:01:34.600> can<00:01:34.750> bring<00:01:34.899> home<00:01:35.049> the<00:01:35.170> gold

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:38.799 
on any day next catch that's cracking in

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:41.039 
on any day next catch that's cracking in
the<00:01:38.890> whole<00:01:39.100> way<00:01:39.880> the<00:01:40.030> program<00:01:40.390> is<00:01:40.420> designed<00:01:40.869> is

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:41.049 
the whole way the program is designed is

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:43.410 
the whole way the program is designed is
to<00:01:41.079> squeeze<00:01:41.950> the<00:01:42.130> last<00:01:42.340> drops<00:01:42.700> out<00:01:42.969> every<00:01:43.270> day

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
to squeeze the last drops out every day

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.059 
to squeeze the last drops out every day
and<00:01:43.719> especially<00:01:43.990> through<00:01:44.560> the<00:01:44.590> course<00:01:44.860> of<00:01:44.979> the

00:01:45.059 --> 00:01:45.069 
and especially through the course of the

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:47.730 
and especially through the course of the
week<00:01:45.250> it<00:01:46.240> involves<00:01:46.810> an<00:01:46.929> enormous<00:01:47.349> amount<00:01:47.560> of

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
week it involves an enormous amount of

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.309 
week it involves an enormous amount of
work<00:01:47.920> and<00:01:48.340> I'm<00:01:49.090> the<00:01:49.270> one<00:01:49.390> setting<00:01:49.780> that<00:01:50.140> work

00:01:50.309 --> 00:01:50.319 
work and I'm the one setting that work

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:55.139 
work and I'm the one setting that work
and<00:01:50.679> so<00:01:50.740> I'm<00:01:50.950> seen<00:01:51.250> as<00:01:51.520> the<00:01:51.700> taskmaster<00:01:54.149> well
