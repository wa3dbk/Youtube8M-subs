00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
your week one and this one is going to

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.960 
your week one and this one is going to
be<00:00:06.359> about<00:00:06.480> how<00:00:07.290> to<00:00:07.350> find<00:00:07.799> a<00:00:08.040> CPU<00:00:08.550> that<00:00:08.580> you're

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
be about how to find a CPU that you're

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.490 
be about how to find a CPU that you're
looking<00:00:09.150> for<00:00:09.360> some<00:00:09.870> of<00:00:09.960> you've<00:00:10.050> never<00:00:10.260> done

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
looking for some of you've never done

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:11.810 
looking for some of you've never done
this<00:00:10.620> before<00:00:10.800> don't<00:00:11.340> know<00:00:11.519> much<00:00:11.700> about

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
this before don't know much about

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.730 
this before don't know much about
hardware<00:00:12.269> and<00:00:12.389> computers<00:00:12.809> so<00:00:13.410> I'm<00:00:13.500> gonna<00:00:13.620> try

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
hardware and computers so I'm gonna try

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.709 
hardware and computers so I'm gonna try
to<00:00:13.799> make<00:00:13.889> it<00:00:14.070> easy<00:00:14.340> for<00:00:14.700> you<00:00:14.880> and<00:00:15.089> then<00:00:15.360> you<00:00:15.570> can

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
to make it easy for you and then you can

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.269 
to make it easy for you and then you can
do<00:00:15.839> the<00:00:15.960> understanding<00:00:16.560> on<00:00:16.680> your<00:00:16.710> own<00:00:16.980> by

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
do the understanding on your own by

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.840 
do the understanding on your own by
going<00:00:18.090> to<00:00:18.240> reviews<00:00:18.690> and<00:00:19.080> reading<00:00:19.320> your<00:00:19.439> book

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:19.850 
going to reviews and reading your book

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.490 
going to reviews and reading your book
the<00:00:20.850> first<00:00:21.090> discussion<00:00:21.689> asked<00:00:22.020> you<00:00:22.199> basically

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
the first discussion asked you basically

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.980 
the first discussion asked you basically
to<00:00:22.680> find<00:00:22.949> a<00:00:23.070> cpu<00:00:23.580> and<00:00:23.760> motherboard<00:00:23.939> in<00:00:24.449> between

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
to find a cpu and motherboard in between

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.779 
to find a cpu and motherboard in between
a<00:00:25.730> 350<00:00:26.730> and<00:00:27.000> 400<00:00:27.359> fifty<00:00:27.960> dollar<00:00:28.230> budget<00:00:28.920> you're

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
a 350 and 400 fifty dollar budget you're

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.160 
a 350 and 400 fifty dollar budget you're
going<00:00:29.970> to<00:00:30.029> use<00:00:30.210> this<00:00:30.390> for<00:00:30.689> assignment<00:00:31.109> number

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
going to use this for assignment number

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.319 
going to use this for assignment number
three<00:00:31.560> so<00:00:31.800> you<00:00:31.859> want<00:00:32.040> to<00:00:32.130> take<00:00:32.250> it<00:00:32.430> serious

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
three so you want to take it serious

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.120 
three so you want to take it serious
enough<00:00:33.540> that<00:00:33.840> when<00:00:34.200> you<00:00:34.320> build<00:00:34.559> a<00:00:34.649> computer<00:00:34.920> an

desk benchmark in some areas a lot
better<00:00:50.070> than<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.460> AMD<00:00:50.850> processor<00:00:51.539> but<00:00:52.079> in

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
better than the AMD processor but in

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.380 
better than the AMD processor but in
these<00:00:52.469> still<00:00:52.800> a<00:00:52.829> good<00:00:53.100> choice<00:00:53.399> nowadays<00:00:54.059> it

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
these still a good choice nowadays it

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.090 
these still a good choice nowadays it
depends<00:00:54.930> what<00:00:55.110> you<00:00:55.289> want<00:00:55.530> most<00:00:55.739> people<00:00:56.070> choose

intel<00:00:56.789> i<00:00:57.000> would<00:00:57.989> suggest<00:00:58.199> that<00:00:58.530> you<00:00:58.680> probably

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
intel i would suggest that you probably

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.360 
intel i would suggest that you probably
stick<00:00:59.309> with<00:00:59.340> a<00:00:59.609> core<00:01:00.059> two<00:01:00.329> quad<00:01:01.160> between<00:01:02.160> these

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
stick with a core two quad between these

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.350 
stick with a core two quad between these
numbers<00:01:02.850> with<00:01:03.629> a<00:01:03.660> socket<00:01:04.170> 775<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:05.670> socket<00:01:06.240> is

these<00:03:32.819> processors<00:03:33.629> and<00:03:33.900> many<00:03:34.620> of<00:03:34.739> them<00:03:34.829> are

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:34.859 
these processors and many of them are

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:37.309 
these processors and many of them are
good<00:03:35.190> it<00:03:36.060> doesn't<00:03:36.359> really<00:03:36.480> matter<00:03:36.659> which<00:03:36.930> one

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:37.319 
good it doesn't really matter which one

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:39.500 
good it doesn't really matter which one
you<00:03:37.590> start<00:03:38.340> looking<00:03:38.459> at<00:03:38.729> the<00:03:38.819> benchmarks<00:03:39.389> and

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
you start looking at the benchmarks and

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.149 
you start looking at the benchmarks and
start<00:03:39.750> seeing<00:03:39.989> which<00:03:40.139> one<00:03:40.319> is<00:03:40.409> best<00:03:40.709> for<00:03:40.979> you

00:03:41.149 --> 00:03:41.159 
start seeing which one is best for you

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:44.240 
start seeing which one is best for you
what<00:03:41.430> you<00:03:41.579> read<00:03:41.849> we<00:03:42.810> can<00:03:42.989> do<00:03:43.229> the<00:03:43.379> intel<00:03:43.709> core<00:03:44.010> 2

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
what you read we can do the intel core 2

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:48.389 
quad 6600 San example so from that point

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:50.479 
quad 6600 San example so from that point
i<00:03:48.629> would<00:03:48.690> go<00:03:48.989> to<00:03:49.019> price<00:03:49.379> watch<00:03:49.680> which<00:03:50.340> is

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
i would go to price watch which is

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:53.960 
i would go to price watch which is
another<00:03:51.620> example<00:03:52.620> link<00:03:53.220> that<00:03:53.489> we<00:03:53.609> give<00:03:53.819> you

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
another example link that we give you

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.149 
another example link that we give you
and<00:03:54.239> when<00:03:54.359> you<00:03:54.449> get<00:03:54.569> to<00:03:54.629> price<00:03:54.930> watch<00:03:55.199> click<00:03:56.010> on

00:03:56.149 --> 00:03:56.159 
and when you get to price watch click on
