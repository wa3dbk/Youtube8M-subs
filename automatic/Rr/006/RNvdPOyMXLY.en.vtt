we've<00:00:08.960> in<00:00:09.960> front<00:00:10.320> of<00:00:10.380> each<00:00:10.470> other<00:00:10.590> we're<00:00:10.860> in

we've in front of each other we're in
the<00:00:11.010> fighting<00:00:11.490> measure<00:00:11.760> right<00:00:12.420> from<00:00:12.600> here<00:00:12.809> and

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
the fighting measure right from here and

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.770 
the fighting measure right from here and
in<00:00:13.680> no<00:00:13.860> time<00:00:14.129> do<00:00:15.059> we<00:00:15.150> really<00:00:15.420> know<00:00:15.600> whether

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
in no time do we really know whether

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:16.910 
in no time do we really know whether
they're<00:00:15.930> going<00:00:16.020> to<00:00:16.080> close<00:00:16.320> the<00:00:16.500> distance<00:00:16.650> and

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
they're going to close the distance and

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.010 
they're going to close the distance and
we<00:00:17.010> want<00:00:17.550> to<00:00:17.670> start<00:00:17.910> to<00:00:18.240> train<00:00:18.539> ourselves<00:00:18.720> to

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
we want to start to train ourselves to

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.990 
we want to start to train ourselves to
be<00:00:19.170> into<00:00:19.410> that<00:00:19.650> start<00:00:20.160> watching<00:00:20.400> for<00:00:20.670> little

things in his preparation does this

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.580 
things in his preparation does this
breathing<00:00:22.890> change<00:00:23.310> does<00:00:23.850> his<00:00:24.060> hand<00:00:24.420> drop<00:00:25.320> so

breathing change does his hand drop so
slightly<00:00:26.010> does<00:00:26.520> he<00:00:26.640> change<00:00:26.880> levels<00:00:27.420> all<00:00:27.600> these

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
slightly does he change levels all these

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.660 
slightly does he change levels all these
little<00:00:28.230> things<00:00:28.350> would<00:00:28.680> seem<00:00:28.890> insignificant

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
little things would seem insignificant

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.049 
little things would seem insignificant
by<00:00:30.480> themselves<00:00:31.290> are<00:00:31.440> you<00:00:32.160> so<00:00:32.430> if<00:00:32.520> I<00:00:32.610> can<00:00:32.820> just

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
by themselves are you so if I can just

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.180 
by themselves are you so if I can just
get<00:00:33.180> a<00:00:33.239> jump<00:00:33.660> on<00:00:33.840> some<00:00:34.110> of<00:00:34.230> that<00:00:34.260> but<00:00:34.739> allow<00:00:35.160> me

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
get a jump on some of that but allow me

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.340 
get a jump on some of that but allow me
to<00:00:35.370> execute<00:00:35.790> my<00:00:36.030> escape<00:00:36.719> or<00:00:36.930> my<00:00:36.960> orderly

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
to execute my escape or my orderly

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.250 
to execute my escape or my orderly
retreat<00:00:37.559> a<00:00:37.949> half<00:00:38.370> a<00:00:38.519> second<00:00:38.879> sooner<00:00:39.260> it'll

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
retreat a half a second sooner it'll

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.079 
retreat a half a second sooner it'll
greatly<00:00:40.800> increase<00:00:41.129> my<00:00:41.309> ability<00:00:41.399> to<00:00:41.820> get<00:00:41.969> the

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:42.089 
greatly increase my ability to get the

00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:43.399 
greatly increase my ability to get the
heck<00:00:42.239> out<00:00:42.390> of<00:00:42.449> the<00:00:42.539> way<00:00:42.629> of<00:00:42.660> his<00:00:42.839> shot<00:00:43.050> so<00:00:43.230> right

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:43.409 
heck out of the way of his shot so right

00:00:43.409 --> 00:00:45.229 
heck out of the way of his shot so right
from<00:00:43.499> here<00:00:43.739> we're<00:00:44.010> squared<00:00:44.370> off<00:00:44.550> that<00:00:44.879> couple

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
from here we're squared off that couple

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.060 
from here we're squared off that couple
little<00:00:45.359> here<00:00:46.019> we<00:00:46.079> go<00:00:46.199> right<00:00:46.649> here<00:00:46.710> and<00:00:46.920> if<00:00:46.980> it

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
little here we go right here and if it

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.829 
little here we go right here and if it
make<00:00:47.219> comes<00:00:47.429> in<00:00:47.609> I'm<00:00:48.239> just<00:00:48.539> going<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:48.749> move

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:48.839 
make comes in I'm just going to move

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:50.660 
make comes in I'm just going to move
what<00:00:49.019> I'm<00:00:49.109> gonna<00:00:49.260> do<00:00:49.499> from<00:00:49.679> here<00:00:49.769> as<00:00:50.129> he<00:00:50.489> comes

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
what I'm gonna do from here as he comes

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.520 
what I'm gonna do from here as he comes
at<00:00:50.819> me<00:00:50.909> is<00:00:51.030> I'm<00:00:51.149> going<00:00:51.300> to<00:00:51.390> give<00:00:51.569> away<00:00:51.690> all

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
at me is I'm going to give away all

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.380 
at me is I'm going to give away all
right<00:00:52.710> so<00:00:53.039> what<00:00:53.190> I<00:00:53.219> did<00:00:53.309> how<00:00:53.640> I<00:00:53.670> gave<00:00:53.969> way<00:00:54.210> is

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
right so what I did how I gave way is

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.569 
right so what I did how I gave way is
when<00:00:54.539> he<00:00:54.719> was<00:00:54.870> directly<00:00:55.859> coming<00:00:56.069> and

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
when he was directly coming and

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.579 
when he was directly coming and
attacking<00:00:56.969> me<00:00:57.329> instead<00:00:58.319> of<00:00:58.379> maintaining

00:00:58.579 --> 00:00:58.589 
attacking me instead of maintaining

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:00.709 
attacking me instead of maintaining
distance<00:00:59.190> I<00:00:59.280> didn't<00:00:59.579> have<00:00:59.729> time<00:01:00.030> to<00:01:00.089> nest<00:01:00.569> so<00:01:00.690> I

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
distance I didn't have time to nest so I

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.569 
distance I didn't have time to nest so I
execute<00:01:01.260> this<00:01:01.409> and<00:01:01.589> by<00:01:01.979> the<00:01:02.039> way<00:01:02.190> just<00:01:02.370> because

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
execute this and by the way just because

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.440 
execute this and by the way just because
I<00:01:02.789> executed<00:01:03.680> that<00:01:04.680> pendulum<00:01:05.580> stat<00:01:05.970> backwards

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
I executed that pendulum stat backwards

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:07.670 
I executed that pendulum stat backwards
doesn't<00:01:06.600> mean<00:01:06.810> he<00:01:06.930> doesn't<00:01:07.050> bridge<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.500> gap

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
doesn't mean he doesn't bridge the gap

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.679 
doesn't mean he doesn't bridge the gap
so<00:01:07.920> what<00:01:08.040> I<00:01:08.070> chose<00:01:08.400> to<00:01:08.580> do<00:01:08.700> is<00:01:08.880> cut<00:01:09.360> an<00:01:09.509> angle

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
so what I chose to do is cut an angle

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.840 
so what I chose to do is cut an angle
out<00:01:10.200> and<00:01:10.590> away<00:01:10.770> from<00:01:10.799> my<00:01:11.070> opponent<00:01:11.490> so<00:01:11.610> if<00:01:11.670> this

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
out and away from my opponent so if this

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.030 
out and away from my opponent so if this
is<00:01:12.030> 12<00:01:12.329> o'clock<00:01:12.390> in<00:01:12.840> front<00:01:13.110> of<00:01:13.200> me<00:01:13.290> we<00:01:13.979> have

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
is 12 o'clock in front of me we have

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.330 
is 12 o'clock in front of me we have
three<00:01:14.460> six<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.329> nine<00:01:15.570> what<00:01:16.229> I<00:01:16.259> did<00:01:16.500> is<00:01:16.680> I<00:01:16.860> open

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
three six and nine what I did is I open

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.830 
three six and nine what I did is I open
the<00:01:17.430> door<00:01:17.549> I<00:01:17.670> took<00:01:17.969> this<00:01:18.149> foot<00:01:18.390> from<00:01:18.570> here

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
the door I took this foot from here

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.410 
the door I took this foot from here
and<00:01:18.990> opened<00:01:19.950> it<00:01:20.040> up<00:01:20.159> so<00:01:20.729> essentially<00:01:21.210> this

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
and opened it up so essentially this

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.560

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:40.490 
here we'll go slow his he comes at me I
open<00:01:37.859> the<00:01:37.950> door<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:38.340> let<00:01:39.119> him<00:01:39.299> pass<00:01:39.509> by<00:01:39.930> and

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
open the door and let him pass by and

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.840 
open the door and let him pass by and
you'll<00:01:40.590> find<00:01:40.799> a<00:01:40.829> guy<00:01:40.950> who's<00:01:41.100> bum-rushing<00:01:41.640> you

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
you'll find a guy who's bum-rushing you

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.990 
you'll find a guy who's bum-rushing you
coming<00:01:42.180> straight<00:01:42.390> forward<00:01:42.780> at<00:01:42.899> you<00:01:43.759> it's<00:01:44.759> very

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
coming straight forward at you it's very

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.490 
coming straight forward at you it's very
difficult<00:01:45.329> for<00:01:45.479> him<00:01:45.600> to<00:01:45.659> change<00:01:45.990> an<00:01:46.140> angle<00:01:46.439> of

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
difficult for him to change an angle of

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.550 
difficult for him to change an angle of
attack<00:01:46.619> so<00:01:47.009> by<00:01:47.159> us<00:01:47.340> changing<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:47.850> angle<00:01:48.560> and

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
attack so by us changing the angle and

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.630 
attack so by us changing the angle and
getting<00:01:49.950> out<00:01:50.039> of<00:01:50.130> his<00:01:50.189> way

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
getting out of his way

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.450 
getting out of his way
hence<00:01:51.299> help<00:01:51.570> more<00:01:52.020> likely<00:01:52.320> to<00:01:52.380> come<00:01:52.500> straight

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
hence help more likely to come straight

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.149 
hence help more likely to come straight
forward<00:01:53.729> and<00:01:53.939> we'll<00:01:54.270> miss<00:01:54.479> his<00:01:54.659> attack<00:01:55.130> one<00:01:56.130> of

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
forward and we'll miss his attack one of

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.620 
forward and we'll miss his attack one of
the<00:01:56.340> things<00:01:56.549> I<00:01:56.670> try<00:01:56.880> to<00:01:56.909> do<00:01:57.149> here<00:01:57.329> is<00:01:57.390> when<00:01:57.539> that

the things I try to do here is when that

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
guy comes at me if I know he's brushing

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.010 
guy comes at me if I know he's brushing
me<00:01:59.520> it<00:01:59.759> should<00:02:00.149> try<00:02:00.329> to<00:02:00.390> cut<00:02:00.689> that<00:02:00.810> angle

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
me it should try to cut that angle

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
grappling endeavour in that case I don't

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.830 
grappling endeavour in that case I don't
want<00:02:17.340> to<00:02:17.580> do<00:02:17.700> that<00:02:18.080> again

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
want to do that again

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.869 
want to do that again
multiple<00:02:20.840> times<00:02:21.080> is<00:02:21.379> multiple<00:02:22.370> opponents<00:02:22.580> of

00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:22.879 
multiple times is multiple opponents of

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:25.570 
multiple times is multiple opponents of
weapons<00:02:23.209> okay<00:02:23.510> so<00:02:24.019> my<00:02:24.170> first<00:02:24.470> choice<00:02:24.709> it<00:02:24.920> is<00:02:25.069> is

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
weapons okay so my first choice it is is

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.880 
weapons okay so my first choice it is is
together<00:02:25.760> way<00:02:26.150> a<00:02:26.330> sprawl<00:02:26.989> which<00:02:27.440> is<00:02:27.560> a<00:02:27.590> very

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
together way a sprawl which is a very

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.910 
together way a sprawl which is a very
good<00:02:28.040> defense<00:02:28.400> should<00:02:28.790> be<00:02:28.870> the<00:02:29.870> last<00:02:30.170> in<00:02:30.650> our

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
good defense should be the last in our

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.759 
good defense should be the last in our
continuum<00:02:31.760> of<00:02:31.879> what<00:02:32.150> to<00:02:32.330> do<00:02:32.480> first<00:02:33.379> thing<00:02:33.620> to

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:33.769 
continuum of what to do first thing to

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:35.559 
continuum of what to do first thing to
do<00:02:33.890> is<00:02:34.190> to<00:02:34.400> intercept<00:02:34.909> since<00:02:35.209> we<00:02:35.360> removed

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:35.569 
do is to intercept since we removed

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:37.990 
do is to intercept since we removed
interception<00:02:36.409> here<00:02:36.620> is<00:02:36.769> to<00:02:37.310> be<00:02:37.430> what<00:02:37.610> to<00:02:37.879> be

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
interception here is to be what to be

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.020 
interception here is to be what to be
evasive<00:02:38.360> and<00:02:38.930> so<00:02:39.920> by<00:02:40.069> being<00:02:40.220> evasive<00:02:40.579> we<00:02:40.849> need

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
evasive and so by being evasive we need

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.089 
evasive and so by being evasive we need
to<00:02:41.150> know<00:02:41.269> how<00:02:41.569> to<00:02:41.599> move<00:02:41.900> effectively<00:02:42.680> in<00:02:42.860> all

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:43.099 
to know how to move effectively in all

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:45.819 
to know how to move effectively in all
directions<00:02:43.280> at<00:02:43.790> all<00:02:43.940> times<00:02:44.299> left<00:02:45.290> lead<00:02:45.590> and

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:45.829 
directions at all times left lead and

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:48.489 
directions at all times left lead and
rightly
