third<00:00:29.310> 200<00:00:29.849> CPI<00:00:30.330> and<00:00:30.750> I<00:00:30.810> think<00:00:31.109> if<00:00:31.980> we<00:00:32.099> look<00:00:32.250> on

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
third 200 CPI and I think if we look on

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.979 
third 200 CPI and I think if we look on
the<00:00:32.489> back<00:00:32.640> here<00:00:33.170> 130<00:00:35.030> inches<00:00:36.030> per<00:00:36.239> second<00:00:36.780> and

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
the back here 130 inches per second and

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.450 
the back here 130 inches per second and
into<00:00:37.559> acceleration<00:00:37.920> at<00:00:38.579> 30<00:00:38.940> g<00:00:39.590> which<00:00:40.590> is<00:00:40.620> it's

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
into acceleration at 30 g which is it's

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.889 
into acceleration at 30 g which is it's
pretty<00:00:41.640> good<00:00:41.850> Mouse<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:42.300> for<00:00:42.719> some<00:00:42.870> reason

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
pretty good Mouse and for some reason

Walmart<00:00:43.590> was<00:00:43.739> like<00:00:43.890> having<00:00:44.100> a<00:00:44.250> fire<00:00:44.520> sale<00:00:44.550> on

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
Walmart was like having a fire sale on

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.680 
Walmart was like having a fire sale on
these<00:00:45.180> for<00:00:45.390> like<00:00:45.450> twenty<00:00:45.899> bucks<00:00:46.079> even<00:00:47.039> though

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
these for like twenty bucks even though

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.119 
these for like twenty bucks even though
these<00:00:48.690> normally<00:00:49.230> run<00:00:49.410> about<00:00:49.559> fifty<00:00:49.800> two<00:00:50.100> forty

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
these normally run about fifty two forty

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.319 
these normally run about fifty two forty
dollars<00:00:50.789> so<00:00:51.000> i<00:00:51.180> had<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:51.719> pick<00:00:51.840> one<00:00:51.899> of<00:00:52.140> these<00:00:52.199> up

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:53.329 
dollars so i had to pick one of these up

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:55.250 
dollars so i had to pick one of these up
that's<00:00:54.329> what<00:00:54.510> it<00:00:54.539> looks<00:00:54.750> like<00:00:54.870> it's<00:00:55.020> got<00:00:55.140> the

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
that's what it looks like it's got the

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.740 
that's what it looks like it's got the
fiber<00:00:55.440> braided<00:00:55.829> cable<00:00:56.219> and<00:00:56.399> I<00:00:57.120> think<00:00:57.539> the

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
fiber braided cable and I think the

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.410 
fiber braided cable and I think the
buttons<00:00:58.379> are<00:00:58.559> rated<00:00:58.859> for<00:00:58.890> like<00:00:59.190> 20<00:01:00.090> million

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
buttons are rated for like 20 million

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:06.109 
buttons are rated for like 20 million
clicks<00:01:00.750> uh<00:01:01.050> it's<00:01:01.829> ambidextrous<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:05.119> the

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
clicks uh it's ambidextrous and the

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.679 
clicks uh it's ambidextrous and the
scroll<00:01:06.510> wheel<00:01:06.540> glows<00:01:07.170> it<00:01:07.650> has<00:01:08.420> some<00:01:09.420> online

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
scroll wheel glows it has some online

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.840 
scroll wheel glows it has some online
people<00:01:10.260> say<00:01:10.560> it's<00:01:10.710> not<00:01:10.860> supported<00:01:11.280> by<00:01:11.310> Mac<00:01:11.580> but

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
people say it's not supported by Mac but

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.969 
people say it's not supported by Mac but
it<00:01:11.970> is<00:01:12.119> indeed<00:01:12.450> supported<00:01:12.930> by<00:01:13.049> win<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:13.590> mac<00:01:13.770> i

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
it is indeed supported by win and mac i

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.649 
it is indeed supported by win and mac i
don't<00:01:14.159> know<00:01:14.280> about<00:01:14.460> linux<00:01:14.939> i'll<00:01:15.450> certainly

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
don't know about linux i'll certainly

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.890 
don't know about linux i'll certainly
try<00:01:16.549> so<00:01:17.549> let's<00:01:17.700> go<00:01:17.820> ahead<00:01:17.850> and<00:01:18.060> open<00:01:18.240> it<00:01:18.479> up<00:01:18.600> now

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
try so let's go ahead and open it up now

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.450 
try so let's go ahead and open it up now
i<00:01:18.930> think<00:01:19.229> this<00:01:19.590> might<00:01:19.830> have<00:01:19.860> been<00:01:20.070> opened

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
i think this might have been opened

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.520 
i think this might have been opened
before<00:01:20.570> and<00:01:21.570> maybe<00:01:21.720> that's<00:01:21.990> why<00:01:22.140> it<00:01:22.200> was<00:01:22.320> on

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
before and maybe that's why it was on

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:34.280 
before and maybe that's why it was on
sale<00:01:22.939> we'll<00:01:23.939> take<00:01:24.090> a<00:01:24.119> look<00:01:32.750> like<00:01:33.750> it<00:01:33.869> has<00:01:34.259> a

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
sale we'll take a look like it has a

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.640 
sale we'll take a look like it has a
dual<00:01:34.770> twisted<00:01:35.340> braid<00:01:35.549> cable<00:01:36.000> so<00:01:36.240> it<00:01:36.540> should<00:01:37.470> be

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
dual twisted braid cable so it should be

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.350 
dual twisted braid cable so it should be
a<00:01:37.680> very<00:01:37.770> durable<00:01:38.220> cable<00:01:38.610> obviously<00:01:39.180> it's<00:01:39.329> not

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
a very durable cable obviously it's not

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.330 
a very durable cable obviously it's not
wireless<00:01:39.720> but<00:01:40.140> we<00:01:40.229> don't<00:01:40.409> use<00:01:40.560> wireless<00:01:40.890> mice

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
wireless but we don't use wireless mice

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.960 
wireless but we don't use wireless mice
around<00:01:41.700> here<00:01:43.369> see<00:01:44.369> there's<00:01:44.549> something<00:01:44.850> on<00:01:44.939> the

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
around here see there's something on the

you want to or change them out are the
replacement<00:02:06.390> pads<00:02:06.570> I<00:02:06.840> guess<00:02:08.390> honestly<00:02:09.390> it

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
replacement pads I guess honestly it

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.530 
replacement pads I guess honestly it
feels<00:02:09.989> kind<00:02:10.289> of<00:02:10.319> cheap<00:02:10.530> right<00:02:10.830> off<00:02:11.039> the<00:02:11.220> bat

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
feels kind of cheap right off the bat

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.910 
feels kind of cheap right off the bat
but<00:02:12.540> it<00:02:12.810> looks<00:02:12.989> like<00:02:13.050> it<00:02:13.230> would<00:02:13.319> fit<00:02:13.379> in

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
but it looks like it would fit in

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.680 
but it looks like it would fit in
and<00:02:14.190> now<00:02:14.340> the<00:02:14.400> only<00:02:14.640> other<00:02:14.880> two<00:02:15.150> gaming<00:02:15.540> mouse

believe a dpi setting I'm sure in the
scroll<00:02:32.280> wheel<00:02:32.310> it<00:02:33.120> has<00:02:33.569> some<00:02:33.780> resistance<00:02:34.290> it

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
scroll wheel it has some resistance it

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.510 
scroll wheel it has some resistance it
seems<00:02:34.680> about<00:02:34.950> right<00:02:36.560> clicks<00:02:37.560> down<00:02:37.739> nice<00:02:38.489> and

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
seems about right clicks down nice and

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.850 
seems about right clicks down nice and
clicky<00:02:39.030> we<00:02:39.360> got<00:02:39.510> that<00:02:39.690> fiber<00:02:39.989> braided<00:02:40.410> USB

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
clicky we got that fiber braided USB

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.699 
clicky we got that fiber braided USB
cable<00:02:41.330> so<00:02:42.330> let's<00:02:42.540> go<00:02:42.660> ahead<00:02:42.690> and<00:02:42.959> let's<00:02:43.530> hook

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
cable so let's go ahead and let's hook

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.009 
cable so let's go ahead and let's hook
it<00:02:43.800> up<00:02:43.920> and<00:02:43.950> see<00:02:44.130> what<00:02:44.400> it<00:02:44.430> does<00:02:44.989> alright<00:02:45.989> I

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
it up and see what it does alright I

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:48.259 
it up and see what it does alright I
haven't<00:02:46.920> hooked<00:02:47.069> up<00:02:47.280> to<00:02:47.489> my<00:02:47.640> mac<00:02:47.850> computer

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
haven't hooked up to my mac computer

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:51.440 
haven't hooked up to my mac computer
right<00:02:48.450> now<00:02:48.480> and<00:02:49.489> now<00:02:50.489> they're<00:02:50.730> not<00:02:50.910> lying<00:02:51.180> when

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
right now and now they're not lying when

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.580 
right now and now they're not lying when
they<00:02:51.510> say<00:02:51.900> it's<00:02:52.230> not<00:02:53.040> compatible<00:02:53.930> but<00:02:54.930> it

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
they say it's not compatible but it

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.800 
they say it's not compatible but it
doesn't<00:02:56.040> it's<00:02:56.160> not<00:02:56.250> Mac<00:02:56.819> isn't<00:02:57.060> supported<00:02:57.660> for

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
doesn't it's not Mac isn't supported for

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.780 
doesn't it's not Mac isn't supported for
the<00:02:57.900> firmware<00:02:58.319> update<00:02:58.709> utility<00:02:58.920> or<00:02:59.519> the

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
the firmware update utility or the

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.479 
the firmware update utility or the
steelseries<00:03:00.390> like<00:03:01.110> cattles<00:03:01.620> driver<00:03:01.980> system

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
steelseries like cattles driver system

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:05.390 
steelseries like cattles driver system
so<00:03:02.970> you<00:03:03.959> can't<00:03:04.230> really<00:03:04.319> customize<00:03:04.980> any<00:03:05.220> of<00:03:05.340> the

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
so you can't really customize any of the

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.270 
so you can't really customize any of the
buttons<00:03:05.610> or<00:03:05.940> change<00:03:06.870> the<00:03:07.049> DPI<00:03:07.200> or<00:03:07.650> anything<00:03:08.130> or

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
buttons or change the DPI or anything or

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.460 
buttons or change the DPI or anything or
I<00:03:08.340> mean<00:03:08.519> the<00:03:08.670> CPI<00:03:09.090> or<00:03:09.209> anything<00:03:09.989> on<00:03:10.140> this<00:03:10.230> mouse

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
I mean the CPI or anything on this mouse

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.949 
I mean the CPI or anything on this mouse
this<00:03:11.370> button<00:03:11.700> right<00:03:11.730> here<00:03:11.850> all<00:03:12.420> it<00:03:12.720> does<00:03:12.900> is

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
this button right here all it does is

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.890 
this button right here all it does is
turns<00:03:13.680> the<00:03:13.890> light<00:03:14.100> on<00:03:14.130> and<00:03:14.370> off<00:03:14.640> default<00:03:15.630> Lee

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
turns the light on and off default Lee

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.170 
turns the light on and off default Lee
now<00:03:16.440> I<00:03:16.470> assume<00:03:16.590> if<00:03:16.890> you<00:03:17.010> set<00:03:17.250> it<00:03:17.340> up<00:03:17.430> with<00:03:17.640> a<00:03:17.700> PC

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
now I assume if you set it up with a PC

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.970 
now I assume if you set it up with a PC
first<00:03:18.510> you<00:03:18.720> can<00:03:18.870> set<00:03:19.140> it<00:03:19.260> up<00:03:19.290> to<00:03:19.440> what<00:03:19.620> you<00:03:19.709> want

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
first you can set it up to what you want

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.930 
first you can set it up to what you want
on<00:03:20.459> Mac<00:03:21.030> it<00:03:21.299> seems<00:03:21.600> to<00:03:21.780> be<00:03:21.930> running<00:03:22.079> about

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
on Mac it seems to be running about

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.229 
on Mac it seems to be running about
2,000<00:03:23.940> CPI<00:03:24.470> I<00:03:25.470> can't<00:03:25.920> really<00:03:26.010> tell<00:03:26.280> so<00:03:26.820> let's

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
2,000 CPI I can't really tell so let's

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.150 
2,000 CPI I can't really tell so let's
go<00:03:27.390> ahead<00:03:27.420> and<00:03:27.600> we'll<00:03:27.840> hook<00:03:27.959> it<00:03:28.109> up<00:03:28.380> to<00:03:28.440> a<00:03:28.650> pc

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
go ahead and we'll hook it up to a pc

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.509 
go ahead and we'll hook it up to a pc
and<00:03:29.430> see<00:03:30.239> the<00:03:30.390> difference<00:03:30.810> there<00:03:31.380> are<00:03:32.220> we're

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
and see the difference there are we're

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:36.349 
and see the difference there are we're
back<00:03:32.700> we<00:03:32.940> got<00:03:33.090> the<00:03:33.620> the<00:03:34.620> kana<00:03:35.010> and<00:03:35.340> the<00:03:35.850> razer

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:36.359 
back we got the the kana and the razer

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:39.319 
back we got the the kana and the razer
deathadder<00:03:36.810> both<00:03:37.320> plugged<00:03:37.680> in<00:03:37.950> and<00:03:38.160> i<00:03:38.970> set<00:03:39.239> up

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
deathadder both plugged in and i set up

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:41.240 
deathadder both plugged in and i set up
some<00:03:39.540> of<00:03:39.630> the<00:03:39.720> software<00:03:40.109> that<00:03:40.260> comes<00:03:40.650> with<00:03:40.829> the

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
some of the software that comes with the

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.590 
some of the software that comes with the
Conner<00:03:41.820> of<00:03:42.060> the<00:03:42.180> steelseries<00:03:42.750> and<00:03:44.000> well<00:03:45.000> I'd

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
Conner of the steelseries and well I'd

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.630 
Conner of the steelseries and well I'd
like<00:03:45.840> the<00:03:46.079> software<00:03:46.620> it<00:03:46.859> was<00:03:47.040> very<00:03:47.280> easy<00:03:47.400> to

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
like the software it was very easy to

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.039 
like the software it was very easy to
set<00:03:47.820> up<00:03:47.850> and<00:03:48.060> you<00:03:48.180> actually<00:03:48.390> can<00:03:48.720> set<00:03:48.930> up

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:49.049 
set up and you actually can set up

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:52.069 
set up and you actually can set up
multiple<00:03:49.200> profiles<00:03:50.480> you<00:03:51.480> can<00:03:51.510> change<00:03:51.989> the

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079 
multiple profiles you can change the

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:54.140 
multiple profiles you can change the
profile<00:03:52.440> by<00:03:52.620> pressing<00:03:52.980> this<00:03:53.100> button<00:03:53.160> and<00:03:53.670> you

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
profile by pressing this button and you

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.330 
profile by pressing this button and you
can<00:03:54.180> turn<00:03:54.480> that<00:03:54.540> you<00:03:55.380> can<00:03:55.530> set<00:03:55.769> each<00:03:55.799> profile

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
can turn that you can set each profile

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.479 
can turn that you can set each profile
tears<00:03:56.609> certain<00:03:56.940> LED<00:03:57.359> intensity<00:03:58.220> so<00:03:59.220> you<00:03:59.280> can

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
tears certain LED intensity so you can

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:03.440 
tears certain LED intensity so you can
change<00:03:59.819> like<00:04:00.660> say<00:04:01.010> first<00:04:02.010> one<00:04:02.220> online<00:04:02.549> is<00:04:02.609> 1600

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
change like say first one online is 1600

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.289 
change like say first one online is 1600
CPI<00:04:04.109> and<00:04:04.530> then<00:04:04.650> the<00:04:04.739> second<00:04:05.069> one's<00:04:05.190> 3200<00:04:05.940> CPI

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:06.299 
CPI and then the second one's 3200 CPI

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:09.580 
CPI and then the second one's 3200 CPI
this<00:04:06.810> one<00:04:07.019> feels<00:04:07.620> a<00:04:08.010> lot<00:04:08.730> cheaper<00:04:09.299> in<00:04:09.510> the

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
this one feels a lot cheaper in the

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:12.949 
this one feels a lot cheaper in the
build<00:04:10.590> quality<00:04:10.940> then<00:04:11.940> compared<00:04:12.750> to<00:04:12.840> the

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
build quality then compared to the

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:17.060 
build quality then compared to the
deathadder<00:04:13.410> and<00:04:14.630> it<00:04:15.630> for<00:04:16.410> me<00:04:16.530> the<00:04:16.739> deathadder

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
deathadder and it for me the deathadder

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.099 
deathadder and it for me the deathadder
fits<00:04:17.430> better<00:04:18.120> in<00:04:18.359> my<00:04:18.479> hand<00:04:18.780> and<00:04:18.959> that's

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
fits better in my hand and that's

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:21.259 
fits better in my hand and that's
because<00:04:19.289> I<00:04:19.470> do<00:04:19.530> the<00:04:19.709> full<00:04:19.919> handed<00:04:20.310> grip<00:04:20.579> if<00:04:20.940> you

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
don't you know you do maybe the pinch or

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.020 
don't you know you do maybe the pinch or
something<00:04:23.580> like<00:04:23.669> that<00:04:23.870> this<00:04:24.870> one's<00:04:25.110> made<00:04:25.380> for

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030 
something like that this one's made for

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:27.830 
something like that this one's made for
multiple

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
multiple

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.770 
multiple
you<00:04:27.990> know<00:04:28.110> ambidextrous<00:04:28.889> users<00:04:29.310> and<00:04:29.780> multiple

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
grips so it's trying to address all of

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:34.790 
grips so it's trying to address all of
this<00:04:32.790> well<00:04:33.030> this<00:04:33.240> is<00:04:33.419> just<00:04:33.570> addressing<00:04:34.110> one<00:04:34.560> I

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
this well this is just addressing one I

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.490 
this well this is just addressing one I
think<00:04:35.580> for<00:04:36.000> me<00:04:36.180> i'll<00:04:36.750> be<00:04:37.080> using<00:04:37.260> the

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
think for me i'll be using the

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.800 
think for me i'll be using the
deathadder<00:04:37.919> more<00:04:38.310> however<00:04:38.790> if<00:04:39.090> you<00:04:39.479> can<00:04:39.630> find

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 
deathadder more however if you can find

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:41.120 
deathadder more however if you can find
this<00:04:39.990> for<00:04:40.229> cheap<00:04:40.410> of<00:04:40.590> course<00:04:40.620> you<00:04:40.949> should

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.130 
this for cheap of course you should

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:43.640 
this for cheap of course you should
probably<00:04:41.280> pick<00:04:41.850> this<00:04:42.060> up<00:04:42.240> so<00:04:42.870> the<00:04:43.260> mouse<00:04:43.440> in

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
probably pick this up so the mouse in

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.650 
probably pick this up so the mouse in
general<00:04:44.040> it's<00:04:44.250> a<00:04:44.460> good<00:04:44.580> mouse<00:04:44.790> but<00:04:45.330> I<00:04:45.360> still

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660 
general it's a good mouse but I still

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.450 
general it's a good mouse but I still
would<00:04:45.810> recommend<00:04:46.260> the<00:04:46.350> razer<00:04:46.530> deathadder<00:04:47.100> the

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:49.410 
deathadder for me just seems more

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:51.980
