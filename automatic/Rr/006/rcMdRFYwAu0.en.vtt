00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 Now I will tell you how to build a house by 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:05.759
 frame panel technology i am 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.950
 make the studio one without 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.480
 help and you will understand that it is simple and 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.400
 easy 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.929
 the panels of the future house are so light that 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.130
 do not require the use of heavy 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.560
 construction equipment 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.250
 so you can build in an open field and 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.000
 in limited assembly space 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.130
 prefab house required 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.580
 project and technical documentation 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.330
 The first stage of construction is 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.980
 foundation device 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.590
 determined by the project house and 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.390
 features of the selected area when 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.160
 the construction of the foundation is laid 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.079
 pipe for ventilation basement 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.329
 space and input communications 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:43.050
 the support bar fastens on the base with 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.670
 using fasteners is important 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.739
 make the timber horizontal 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.110
 fasteners must be at least 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.730
 3 for each beam the distance between 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.070
 fasteners 1 meter 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.230
 the support bar is processed by working off 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.180
 or bitumen mastic to protect against 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.070
 moisture also bitumen mastic 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.940
 processed by the underside of the panel 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.940
 overlap 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:10.890
 penny lags wad connect each other 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.890
 friend and stitched with screws 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:20.260
 base panels and lag mounting points 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.260
 filled with foam 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:27.310
 Lags are placed in the groove of the panels and 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.310
 secured with screws 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.920
 overlap panel 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.920
 mounted on support beam 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:46.160
 grooves are also filled with foam and panels 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.160
 the overlap joins together 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:57.600
 admissible gaps between panels from three 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.400
 up to five millimeters 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.130
 parallelism and horizontal 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.780
 Overlap panels are checked using 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.520
 two-meter level external clearance 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.340
 the perimeter of the foundation depends on 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:12.840
 selected finishing material 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:15.060
 the next stage is the assembly of the walls during installation 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.160
 guide rail under the walls of the house can be 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.880
 use any small panel for 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.730
 observance of necessary clearances 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.440
 stacked with screws in a checkerboard pattern 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.810
 in the same way is set 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.709
 guide rail for interior walls and 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.200
 partitions 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:37.260
 do not forget that all connections 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:38.990
 filled with foam mounting wall 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.450
 at home we start with corner panels 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:45.650
 install the first panel 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.650
 we fix the connecting bar 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.220
 install the second corner panel 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:00.980
 panel and fasten screws with step 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.980
 15 centimeters 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:14.280
 corner panels securely tightened 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:16.500
 grouse further build walls 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.570
 produced according to drawings and 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.990
 according to the marking applied to 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.990
 panels 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:41.209
 panel joints are filled with mounting 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:44.090
 foam before foam and seams of the panel 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:46.219
 are joined by the thorn groove principle for this 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.939
 use racks of two or more 

00:03:46.219 --> 00:03:48.939
 boards 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:03.450
 when assembling the panels must be left 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.450
 thermal gap and 5 millimeters 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:12.129
 frame-panel technology allows 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:13.180
 create a variety of architectural 

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:15.430
 forms 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.019
 approved at the project stage they are without 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.079
 labor are embodied on the construction 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:19.079
 the site 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:23.850
 door and window openings are formed when 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.380
 assembly of finished panels 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:28.540
 the slopes are perfectly prepared for 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:34.449
 installation of window blocks and door 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:36.550
 boxes if the house has more than one 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:38.139
 the floor then each subsequent floor 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:40.330
 going like 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:42.310
 all panels of the future house come in 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.470
 construction site with marking 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:46.960
 therefore, to assemble a house is not difficult 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:49.060
 after the walls were erected and 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:52.350
 installed the necessary beams time 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:54.850
 proceed to the installation of ceilings and roofs 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:57.039
 installation of floors and roof elements 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:05:00.210
 produced according to drawings in accordance with 

00:04:57.039 --> 00:05:00.210
 marking on the panels 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:37.540
 and complete our construction 

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:37.540
 installing roof panels 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:48.219
 the bottom panel is attached to 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:50.259
 gable wall grouse second panel 

00:05:48.219 --> 00:05:52.869
 rely on 1 short side and on 

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:55.449
 gabled long pass panel inserted 

00:05:52.869 --> 00:05:58.180
 whole beam i consisting of two or 

00:05:55.449 --> 00:06:00.279
 more boards next row of groove panels 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:02.830
 puts on the beam sewn into the first row 

00:06:00.279 --> 00:06:05.550
 panels on the skate panels are fastened 

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:05.550
 together 

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:32.590
 when assembling the house all the connections 

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:34.810
 filled in foam assembly and completes 

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:38.099
 the assembly of the binding board which 

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:38.099
 sewn into the ends of the panels 

00:06:38.409 --> 00:06:43.989
 as promised i single-handedly built here 

00:06:40.989 --> 00:06:50.789
 this house although I am not professional 

00:06:43.989 --> 00:06:50.789
 the builder can do it and wish you good luck
