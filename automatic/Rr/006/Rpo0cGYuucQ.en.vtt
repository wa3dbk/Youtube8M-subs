00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
we're going to take a look at a move set

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.450 
we're going to take a look at a move set
here<00:00:38.899> this<00:00:39.899> one<00:00:40.110> is<00:00:40.290> modest<00:00:40.710> because<00:00:41.040> even

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
here this one is modest because even

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.160 
here this one is modest because even
though<00:00:41.579> both<00:00:41.760> of<00:00:41.820> his<00:00:42.030> attack<00:00:42.420> stats<00:00:42.750> are<00:00:42.960> high

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
though both of his attack stats are high

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.680 
though both of his attack stats are high
the<00:00:43.860> special<00:00:44.280> attack<00:00:44.489> is<00:00:44.700> higher<00:00:45.059> so<00:00:45.390> you<00:00:45.450> want

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
the special attack is higher so you want

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.290

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
to lean him towards special attack so we

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.910 
to lean him towards special attack so we
got<00:00:48.420> a<00:00:48.450> modest<00:00:48.780> nature<00:00:48.960> here<00:00:49.440> would<00:00:49.620> levitate

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920
