00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:23.490

 here I was watching the inter did I am 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.270
 with a logbook here and there easy 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.410
 on here 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:02.370
 From 5:30 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. there is a place 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:04.970
 calls Tchibo and cap cry right and where 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:08.100
 this look where you will make the inscriptions 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:11.369
 The name of your baby should be washed or 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.510
 Launch your child anyway they will do 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.580
 an application 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.770
 there they will tell you how you have 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.509
 who do the hours procedure the works 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.360
 that will be open 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.670
 What kind of activities will you have? 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.520
 monitors you can leave the child there 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.439
 child but have fun and listen to you 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.720
 You can stay there, too. 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.759
 but if you want to let the child leave them 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.890
 stay with the kids, right? 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.470
 there are several types of games 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.590
 they make of the trails with the kids 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.930
 It is also not now on the form that I 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.909
 I went to see already had pajama party was 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.460
 very cool for them because they 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.210
 they put pajamas for the party 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.700
 I played with other kids 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.350
 so can you stay at rest 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.670
 because it has quite a reversal of these 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.369
 children, right? 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:59.619
 I also have sneakers that jeans 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:03.310
 teen jees né 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:06.070
 more or less beyond 10 to 15 years 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.530
 they usually meet and then have games 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.929
 board they talk also has 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.750
 rush age monitors we do 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:16.060
 a lot of jokes there a chance and I 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.700
 asked if she's going to have a ballad in this 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:22.000
 they can can teens them 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.440
 they can also go to ballads at 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.080
 partying at nightclubs 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.630
 just can not make use of the drink 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.920
 alcoholic that there is only from 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.959
 18 years 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.050
 but the teenager they can attend 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:36.900
 the same environments as adults 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:40.090
 including young children 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:42.310
 contrasting with such né 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.290
 and there for adolescents also has 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.630
 various activities, right? 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:50.650
 They'll meet at this club and then 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:53.680
 also on paper logbook 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.989
 He has been bringing schedules there and coming 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.420
 putting the team and club that kind of 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:00.940
 activity will take a look at you and 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:04.299
 children of the same type and the cap club 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:06.280
 also has those little ones more 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:07.870
 those smaller children lines but have 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.910
 fun for him too 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.829
 so it's good to be aware of your 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:14.980
 logbook that this one I already 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:18.100
 I showed in another video to this one 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:21.780
 because so all kind of activity 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:26.110
 it has to be any age is 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:27.430
 described in the logbooks 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.590
 and then you have to stay tuned because 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.080
 so the schedule that I have for the diary 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.730
 on board I do not know 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.350
 it's hardly going to be on the live cell phone 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.020
 This time, right? 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:40.150
 so it's good when you arrive 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:42.250
 they would arrive at the reception if they did not play 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:46.420
 alone going down on your way goes in the 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:49.660
 reception asks who gives they go newspaper 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:51.880
 and also do not inform you the exact deck 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:54.850
 where cups activities 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:58.360
 so it is so for example in the empress 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:04:01.300
 the activities of the adolescent excuse 98 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:03.940
 in prison does not feel this activity to 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:05.380
 teenagers they happened in the 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:07.900
 library 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:10.030
 I do not remember now which deck is the 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.610
 library but it should not 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:18.250
 library that held its activities 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:21.459
 now the children there no no no zenit 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.990
 the children they met in another in 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:25.180
 other since then 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:28.900
 for the children the last club 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:33.820
 chapter eight on deck 8 do not walk eight 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:37.630
 in the genes the empress is already the 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:40.930
 cress the activities happens happen 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:44.770
 teen pros happens on deck 6 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:47.980
 now for the kids it happens on the deck 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:49.840
 10 that was on the pool deck so the 

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:52.150
 parents should be aware of this and will 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:54.010
 receive a little card and come back with this 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:57.700
 zinho card walking back and forth to 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:05:00.280
 identify who is the father and the mother is 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:03.400
 who should be staying here 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:05.410
 nor command and such a cabin then it is 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.760
 It's really cool if the parents stay 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:09.160
 but they have enough 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:11.169
 activity without play 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.970
 they play theatrics with the 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:14.890
 children rehearses then presents themselves 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:16.660
 most theater pro im 

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:19.560
 then so is quite fun the 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:22.200
 children have dimensions for them 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:24.000
 with their age they will know 

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:27.000
 other adolescent children and also 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.220
 My brother made several friendships even 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.889
 Our family made friends with several 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:34.139
 teenagers who were west knew 

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:36.720
 a lot of people were super cool just to 

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:40.350
 They have board games. 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:42.810
 sometimes they will utter both in the video game 

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:45.870
 so they make many friendships between 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:49.490
 they do not end up being after 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:52.500
 ship and continues the friendship in the 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:54.990
 of life so it's very cool have 

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:56.490
 activity if the parents can stay 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:06:00.180
 that the children are in 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:02.370
 and receive a little card in this 

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:04.380
 room alone and yes there is a furinho 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:05.250
 then this shows that the youngest child 

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:07.800
 age 

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:09.810
 and then there is no way out of the ship 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:13.260
 so parents can rest easy 

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:15.180
 why not have someone take the ship 

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:17.150
 with this child can only leave if I 

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:19.320
 you have this card and still 

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:23.240
 accompanied by parents 

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:26.250
 these tips I give to those who 

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:29.100
 have minor children for whom 

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:30.539
 teenager is looking to know 

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:32.850
 information and I know it is 

00:06:30.539 --> 00:06:35.460
 difficult for someone to talk about 

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:37.050
 right activities have no children I have 

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:39.720
 my brother that the teenager was not 

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:42.000
 I know exactly the activities that 

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:43.590
 total travel will occur with the 

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.200
 Children, I know you had a party there. 

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:50.280

 Hawaiian necklace so they play a lot 

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:59.789
 with children there is quite a symptom 

00:06:58.139 --> 00:07:01.650

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:06.300

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:08.940
 made the games there own plane the 

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:11.850

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:16.020
 trained for the animation of these cities 

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:17.870
 and then you can inform them that you have 

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:20.390
 enough activity for children 

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:22.850
