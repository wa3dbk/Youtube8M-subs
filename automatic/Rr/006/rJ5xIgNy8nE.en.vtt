00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:38.629
 hello everybody here rafael montini o 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:40.760
 founder of the company and plants and a 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:43.340
 thesis another video for you 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:46.699
 I'm going to tell you about the law zone today. 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:49.010
 origins and characteristics old wheels 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:51.620
 of flowering and water because a 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:56.449
 how then sing come on will get 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:58.970
 sr azalea azalea comes from 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:02.180
 Asian continent they are easily 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:02.869
 found in countries such as China and 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.299
 Japan 

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:07.549
 in the case of severe winter and which end 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:09.890
 being responsible for some of the 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:10.970
 more attractive features of this 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.490
 plant 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.830
 one of the characteristics is that it can 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.320
 up to two meters in height and 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.320
 presents the cypher not knowing 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.939
 precisely during the coldest season 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.159
 while other types of flowers 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:28.960
 this is the one at rest by preparing 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:31.970
 to the next outside are the characteristic 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:34.850
 because it is a flower accustomed to conditions 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:37.789
 adverse climatic azalea has great 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:40.369
 resistance it adapts to various 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:43.130
 of sun that can be grown both with 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:46.249
 exposure to direct sunlight 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:49.310
 shade the azaleas can be found 

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:51.950
 naturally in the colors purple and white and 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.319
 pink but certain 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.439
 executive has created different arrays 

00:01:54.319 --> 00:02:00.560
 of these three colors by increasing the number of 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:03.170
 options available in floriculture 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.840
 parts can be simple with folds or 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.399
 roads being the most common colors 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.080
 for this plant 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:12.860
 Now let's talk a little bit let's do the 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:15.620
 preparation of the soil to our sun 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:19.430
 prefers a milder climate 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:22.520
 which gave the minimum area is can be 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.350
 forgiven nice lord money 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:27.260
 flowering after one year of 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:29.810
 formation and flowering takes place 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.750
 usually in April and July and their 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.470
 flowers depends on what you will choose good and 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.510
 with a 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:38.900
 this change was his 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:41.090
 correctly good adverse to s for 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.370
 start planting flower with the bottom 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:47.480
 most popular among Brazilians is the 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:49.910
 lenk rhododendron species that had 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.550
 genetic improvement and displays 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:56.270
 purple color cultivars white rose add 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:58.610
 lilac red and mixed environments 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:01.040
 it develops better in more 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.500
 mild climates but also in forest 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.720
 The hottest rules are needed when 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.690
 throughout the life of the plant but only 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:11.390
 every two or three days since the 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:13.910
 azalea are not demanding water 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:16.490
 they still grow better on soil with the 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:20.000
 well-trained substrates that allow 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:22.970
 the variation of moisture the propagation 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.670
 it is sexually realized of the mind through 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:28.490
 of seeds and is intended to meet 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:31.670
 education programs to obtain new 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:33.560
 cultivars when asexual is the 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:36.500
 method most used that producers 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:39.560
 are removed with the highlights colors of 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:42.590
 approximately 7 and 10 centimeters 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:45.680
 pointer of branches that are not very 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:48.019
 bright or very low which is not 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.519
 It can be very new or very old. 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:52.430
 It has to be more or less mature. 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:55.250
 I need to call it mature in this way of 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:57.800
 to generate as many equals as ever will not 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:01.160
 difference in color nothing will generate 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:03.170
 equal to the size where it was taken in 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:06.230
 then had to be treated with 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:09.170
 growth regulators that promotes 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:11.420
 acceleration and root formation but 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:13.900
 it is recommended that stacking be 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:16.940
 performed in a greenhouse 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:19.400
 especially the warmer months in general 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.799
 it takes six weeks to 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.610
 appropriate rooting of the 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:26.000
 stake 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:28.490
 planting should be in full sun but 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.440
 depending on the species or cultivar also 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:32.150
 It may be the half-light 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.970
 the sun must be composed of earth of 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:37.220
 garden and vegetable being a part of it 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:38.900
 for a sand of more than three percent 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:41.180
 of organic matter 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:44.510
 there is no need to perform liming 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:46.820
 Alex likes acid soils for 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:50.240
 fertilization adopt the formulation 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:52.940
 slow release which is 10 10 10 and 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:57.080
 which allows to be performed four times 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:59.750
 the year with the pit opens a space that has 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:02.300
 double the size of the lump of 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:05.240
 forms the background with 57 centimeters 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.770
 sand together with the mixture of a compound 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.290
 with that of the animal 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:11.930
 before the molt so that the roots are 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:14.330
 protected from direct contact with the 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:17.600
 material until the woman started the 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:20.180
 redd development on alternate days 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:22.820
 the poles are necessary for the formation 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:26.210
 of new shoots and renewal of foliage 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:28.730
 after flowering the thinning can be 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:31.340
 made according to the format in the plant 

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:34.490
 it's the height you want in the spring 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:37.520
 pruning of the dry branches or 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:40.340
 too long for higher evaluation 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:43.070
 through azaleas this process 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:44.870
 hinders the colonization of pests and 

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:47.750
 same time causes the 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:50.420
 twins also removes any dead flowers 

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:53.240
 to force the other buttons 

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:56.060
 care you should have 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:58.700
 bacterial fungi or viruses can 

00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:01.040
 to cause disease, it used the fall of 

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:03.710
 dark gray leaves that were once 

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:06.860
 white adas defendant hate attack signal 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:09.290
 whose control is refused a reduction of 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:10.340
 frequency of rules is the isolation of 

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:12.230
 house plant 

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:15.590
 in the case of the presence of 

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:17.540
 dark brown rodrigÃ£o 

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:19.580
 starts at the top of the ranking and can 

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:22.520
 reach the main stem of the assembly 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:26.210
 prune the diseased area and pass the 

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:29.660
 cut a base paste of 

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:31.910
 covers excess moisture from the sun or 

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:34.250
 environment and stimulate the emergence of 

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:36.290
 fungus and leaves leaves stained with 

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:38.270
 appearance of rust 

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:39.830
 This is why it is important to vote 

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:41.600
 planting time because it will help 

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:42.320
 drainage will not always leave the soil 

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:44.870
 youtube 

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:47.360
 the flowering by means of 

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:50.480
 control of the photo period and 

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:52.190
 appropriate temperature the azalea may 

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:54.919
 flourish within environments in 

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:57.320
 any season of the year by 

00:06:54.919 --> 00:06:59.270
 flower are also happens in April and 

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:00.440
 July which are the periods where they are little 

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:02.530
 soft 

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:04.520
 you do not have to gain momentum in this period 

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:06.890
 remembering after the flowering 

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:08.600
 pruning is recommended for cleaning and 

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:11.420
 maintenance for the next season of 

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:14.570
 sheet has always had that this is one 

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:16.370
 dry channel where while you stay here 

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:18.020
 I hope you have enjoyed the news of 

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:19.970
 week that was talking about the 

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:22.940
 the assembly can even do for a 

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:25.370
 website saleh if you want child is a 

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:27.800
 very cultivated plant many are up 

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:30.770
 planting a large scale will power 

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:32.900
 commercialize this plant, remembering that 

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:35.420
 liked your June this review 

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:37.850
 subscribe to the channel by reinforcing your 

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:40.250
 comment is always important if you 

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:42.410
 have any doubts about the zone is 

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:44.150
 have doubts about other plants that 

00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:46.340
 I'll be organizing to get 

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:48.470
 meet all orders 

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:50.060
 remembering also I will leave a link in the 

00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:52.190
 description of this video 

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:55.250
 if you want to be more news of 

00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:56.480
 plants or other kind of thing of the bation 

00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:58.070
 I will also have 

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:59.570
 so you may be signing up 

00:07:58.070 --> 00:08:02.000
 down here and another sending news 

00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:04.610
 for you every week is about 

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.270
 thank you and until the next plant 

00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:07.270
 week only
