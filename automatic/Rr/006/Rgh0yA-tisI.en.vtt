00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 hi in this video I will explain 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.690
 on how to fix the ip address in your 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.540
 router for wireless devices and 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:12.480
 be laptops tablets smartphones or maybe 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.880
 in a wireless printer in the case 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.070
 of wireless printers is ideal 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.289
 fix your ip address since according to 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.330
 seen in other tutorials or websites only 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.449
 show us how to install the printer 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.400
 in wifi mode but what they do not mention is 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.560
 that later they will have problems 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.019
 time to order an impression or scan 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.239
 wirelessly if it occurs to them 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.010
 call technical support they will tell you 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.290
 that you have to configure the printer 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.690
 do this do that or go back to 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.579
 install the driver etcetera or maybe you 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.710
 say at the end that you have to configure 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.719
 your ip and for that you must call your 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.180
 telephone or internet provider 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.980
 if you have bad luck they will not understand well 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.110
 your problem or easy they will tell you 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.390
 consult technical support of the 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.809
 printer that you bought and in the end never 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.820
 you will have a solution for this problem 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.039
 Well here is the solution for 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.600
 those who do not know the routers that 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.280
 provides them with the companies 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.100
 Internet telephony in their homes come 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.869
 defect configured with hcp which 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.729
 makes the router assign them a 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:14.170
 ip address different to each computer 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:16.000
 fixed or wireless 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.920
 this direction varies depending on the 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.170
 order in which the computer was connected to 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.540
 router the same thing happens with the printer 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.610
 so that if they installed 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.649
 correctly the driver of your printer 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.540
 during the safe installation it 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:30.190
 assigned an ip address by which 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.530
 the computer will connect with the 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.540
 printer obviously that address should 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.580
 of being fixed since every time you print 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.470
 the computer will always look for the 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.660
 printer with that ip address that 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.970
 assign this previously what happens is 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:45.220
 that when turning on the PC and the printer the 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.409
 router will assign you an ip address that 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.750
 it will be different from the one you chose so 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:51.720
 that your PC and printer will never connect 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.030
 and it will not work 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.160
 first after having installed the 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.040
 driver of your printer correctly 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.700
 turn off your printer and your router then 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.640
 one minute 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.010
 turn on only the second router here 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.310
 I'll show you how to fix the ip write 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.310
 this 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.310
 with one of these addresses you can 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.310
 enter the router 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.310
 now you see it 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:37.209
 third now you are already in the panel 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.790
 router control depending on each 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:41.440
 model the user interface varies but 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.350
 I suppose they must have the same 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:47.600
 characteristics for my case we're going 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:51.220
 here in this tab 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.220
 now we select this 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.870
 if you find out here you put the 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.560
 mac address with its respective 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.560
 address yp 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.100
 in my case the mac address is a 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.260
 unique address of each device 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:08.030
 factory so here I assigned the 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:11.350
 address of my printer with its 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.350
 respective ip address 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.090
 this means that every time you 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:19.610
 turn on the printer will connect to 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:22.160
 router will recognize your mac and assign it 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.510
 the respective ip address will click 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.849
 in this button 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.400
 finally turn on your printer and 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:29.500
 is 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.599
 if you still have problems with the 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.730
 printer may be that the router is 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:35.950
 very far from the printer or there is 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:41.010
 some good interference that was all 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:41.010
 I invite you to visit my blog thanks
