what's next something like that it's not
exactly<00:01:59.710> the<00:01:59.830> same<00:01:59.920> but<00:02:00.340> you<00:02:00.550> get<00:02:00.820> the<00:02:00.940> idea<00:02:02.790> in

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:03.790 
exactly the same but you get the idea in

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:54.530 
exactly the same but you get the idea in
composition<00:02:10.709> here<00:02:11.709> that<00:02:11.860> one<00:02:11.980> again

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:00.509

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
tada okay as you can see it was hard for

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.599 
tada okay as you can see it was hard for
me<00:03:28.540> to<00:03:28.689> remember<00:03:29.139> all<00:03:29.439> of<00:03:29.470> that<00:03:29.709> stuff<00:03:30.040> it

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:31.490 
me to remember all of that stuff it
really<00:03:30.700> doesn't<00:03:31.090> matter

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
really doesn't matter

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.039 
really doesn't matter

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:36.720 
again this is an improvised tune this is
it's<00:03:35.319> just<00:03:35.590> kind<00:03:35.829> of<00:03:35.889> you<00:03:36.010> get<00:03:36.159> in<00:03:36.250> the<00:03:36.370> spirit

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730

it's just kind of you get in the spirit
and<00:03:36.970> you<00:03:37.060> can<00:03:37.209> kind<00:03:37.420> of<00:03:37.480> feel<00:03:37.780> the<00:03:37.810> rhythm<00:03:38.139> and

00:03:38.399 --> 00:03:38.409 
and you can kind of feel the rhythm and

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:41.069 
and you can kind of feel the rhythm and
where<00:03:38.560> the<00:03:38.709> notes<00:03:38.920> can<00:03:39.189> go<00:03:39.400> and<00:03:39.670> you<00:03:40.359> just<00:03:40.870> go

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:41.079 
where the notes can go and you just go

there's a few trills in a couple places
in<00:03:51.549> any<00:03:51.849> place<00:03:52.150> where<00:03:52.180> I<00:03:52.419> notice<00:03:52.840> hell<00:03:53.230> there's

a little when you hold the note play

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:04.690 
a little when you hold the note play
some<00:04:01.449> vibrato

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:04.700 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.520

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 
previous video ok that's that one and of

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:16.630 
previous video ok that's that one and of
course<00:04:15.500> when<00:04:15.860> you're<00:04:15.950> playing<00:04:16.280> if<00:04:16.489> you're

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:16.640 
course when you're playing if you're

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:23.950 
course when you're playing if you're
doing<00:04:16.940> was<00:04:17.239> called<00:04:17.540> tonguing<00:04:18.019> really<00:04:22.960> and

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 
doing was called tonguing really and

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.710 
doing was called tonguing really and
that<00:04:24.950> really<00:04:25.250> works<00:04:25.970> nicely<00:04:26.270> on<00:04:26.540> these

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 
that really works nicely on these

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.409 
that really works nicely on these
hardwood<00:04:27.290> flutes<00:04:27.680> I<00:04:28.370> think<00:04:28.970> it's<00:04:29.120> a<00:04:29.240> real

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:29.419 
hardwood flutes I think it's a real

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:34.320 
hardwood flutes I think it's a real
crisp<00:04:29.750> little<00:04:30.020> bite<00:04:31.210> okay<00:04:32.210> and<00:04:32.510> that's<00:04:33.050> the

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.330 
crisp little bite okay and that's the

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.360 
crisp little bite okay and that's the
improvisation<00:04:35.330> in<00:04:35.570> see<00:04:35.900> on<00:04:36.230> the<00:04:36.740> Merlin<00:04:37.130> see

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320 
interestingly enough that little line

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:50.400 
interestingly enough that little line
that<00:04:42.500> I<00:04:42.590> had<00:04:42.770> at<00:04:42.860> the<00:04:42.890> beginning<00:04:43.040> okay<00:04:43.790> this<00:04:49.090> I

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:50.410 
that I had at the beginning okay this I

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:53.590 
that I had at the beginning okay this I
gave<00:04:51.410> them<00:04:51.770> a<00:04:51.800> swing<00:04:52.340> kind<00:04:52.820> of<00:04:52.970> a<00:04:53.030> feel<00:04:53.240> to<00:04:53.480> it

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600 
gave them a swing kind of a feel to it

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:58.990 
gave them a swing kind of a feel to it
in<00:04:53.810> the<00:04:54.440> bud<00:04:57.040> but<00:04:58.040> originally<00:04:58.250> it<00:04:58.520> wasn't<00:04:58.910> that

00:04:58.990 --> 00:04:59.000 
in the bud but originally it wasn't that

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:15.200 
in the bud but originally it wasn't that
it<00:04:59.180> was<00:04:59.270> more<00:04:59.480> like
