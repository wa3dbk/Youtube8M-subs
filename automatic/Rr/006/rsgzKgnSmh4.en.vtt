my most the most effective way that I

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.189 
my most the most effective way that I
found<00:00:21.689> through<00:00:22.410> on<00:00:22.560> start<00:00:22.949> of<00:00:23.070> a<00:00:23.130> new<00:00:23.160> level<00:00:23.490> um

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:24.199 
found through on start of a new level um

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:26.689 
found through on start of a new level um
this<00:00:25.199> is<00:00:25.380> really<00:00:25.650> only<00:00:25.769> good<00:00:26.070> for<00:00:26.279> people<00:00:26.460> who

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
this is really only good for people who

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.820 
this is really only good for people who
want<00:00:26.820> to<00:00:26.939> build<00:00:27.150> in<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.449> game<00:00:27.720> if<00:00:28.349> you<00:00:28.529> want<00:00:28.710> to

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
want to build in the game if you want to

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.679 
want to build in the game if you want to
just<00:00:29.039> make<00:00:29.340> it<00:00:29.550> to<00:00:29.699> survive<00:00:30.060> and<00:00:30.359> just<00:00:30.510> have

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
just make it to survive and just have

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.680 
just make it to survive and just have
fun<00:00:30.720> I<00:00:31.260> don't<00:00:31.590> recommend<00:00:31.890> this<00:00:32.250> because<00:00:32.690> sort

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
fun I don't recommend this because sort

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.569 
fun I don't recommend this because sort
of<00:00:33.809> rushes<00:00:34.290> through<00:00:34.620> one<00:00:35.130> of<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.309> crucial

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
of rushes through one of the crucial

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.290 
of rushes through one of the crucial
stages<00:00:36.120> of<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.540> game<00:00:37.309> but<00:00:38.309> first<00:00:38.730> of<00:00:38.910> all<00:00:39.030> when

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
stages of the game but first of all when

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.330 
stages of the game but first of all when
you<00:00:39.420> spawn<00:00:39.809> is<00:00:40.320> actually<00:00:40.770> really<00:00:40.890> cool<00:00:41.010> well

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340

you spawn is actually really cool well
when<00:00:42.300> you<00:00:42.420> spawn<00:00:42.780> you<00:00:43.050> want<00:00:43.260> to<00:00:43.379> just<00:00:44.340> sort<00:00:44.640> of

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
when you spawn you want to just sort of

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.900 
when you spawn you want to just sort of
rush<00:00:45.120> towards<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.719> tree<00:00:46.280> like<00:00:47.280> get<00:00:47.489> to<00:00:47.640> a<00:00:47.700> tree

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
rush towards the tree like get to a tree

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.139 
rush towards the tree like get to a tree
as<00:00:48.030> fast<00:00:48.270> as<00:00:48.480> you<00:00:48.570> can<00:00:48.809> um<00:00:49.739> and<00:00:50.399> then<00:00:50.789> you<00:00:51.000> want

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
as fast as you can um and then you want

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
to like grab out three blocks which

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.020 
to like grab out three blocks which
isn't<00:00:55.710> hard<00:00:55.890> because<00:00:56.280> doesn't<00:00:56.789> take<00:00:56.910> very

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
isn't hard because doesn't take very

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.160 
isn't hard because doesn't take very
long<00:00:59.120> there<00:01:00.120> we<00:01:00.180> go<00:01:00.300> three<00:01:00.570> blocks<00:01:00.600> and

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
long there we go three blocks and

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.640 
long there we go three blocks and
instantly<00:01:02.039> you<00:01:02.129> want<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.609> turn<00:01:03.210> them<00:01:03.359> all<00:01:03.600> into

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
update you just dig out eight blocks I

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.700 
update you just dig out eight blocks I
mean<00:02:03.600> most<00:02:03.810> of<00:02:03.930> you<00:02:04.049> probably<00:02:04.079> already<00:02:04.380> know

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
this but I find it a really cool feature

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.320 
this but I find it a really cool feature
um

um
so<00:02:10.259> ya<00:02:10.410> dig<00:02:10.650> out<00:02:10.770> eight<00:02:10.950> blocks<00:02:11.310> and<00:02:12.210> once

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
so ya dig out eight blocks and once

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.700 
so ya dig out eight blocks and once
you've<00:02:12.510> got<00:02:12.630> your<00:02:12.660> eight<00:02:12.930> blocks<00:02:13.200> you<00:02:13.470> want<00:02:13.620> to

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
drop down and go back to your arm thing

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.220
