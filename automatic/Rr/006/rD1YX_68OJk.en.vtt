started with like the basic competition
you<00:01:12.060> know<00:01:12.180> what's<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.690> main<00:01:12.870> things<00:01:13.170> are

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
you know what's the main things are

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.649 
you know what's the main things are
gonna<00:01:13.350> head<00:01:13.560> do<00:01:13.830> we<00:01:14.549> decide<00:01:14.880> you<00:01:15.120> know<00:01:15.270> basic

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
gonna head do we decide you know basic

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.570 
gonna head do we decide you know basic
wheel<00:01:15.810> design<00:01:16.260> and<00:01:16.799> we're<00:01:16.950> gonna<00:01:17.100> need<00:01:17.520> a

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
wheel design and we're gonna need a

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:18.980 
wheel design and we're gonna need a
throwing<00:01:17.909> arm<00:01:18.030> first<00:01:18.330> birthing<00:01:18.630> kind<00:01:18.869> of<00:01:18.930> a

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
throwing arm first birthing kind of a

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.539 
throwing arm first birthing kind of a
human<00:01:19.290> arm<00:01:19.440> thing<00:01:19.740> that<00:01:19.920> they<00:01:20.010> realize<00:01:20.369> it's

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
human arm thing that they realize it's

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.219 
human arm thing that they realize it's
not<00:01:20.790> quite<00:01:21.420> able<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:21.750> do<00:01:21.869> that<00:01:21.990> a<00:01:22.049> little

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
not quite able to do that a little

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.170 
not quite able to do that a little
beyond<00:01:22.500> our<00:01:22.650> abilities<00:01:23.010> so<00:01:23.670> he<00:01:23.729> thought<00:01:23.909> more

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
beyond our abilities so he thought more

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.940 
beyond our abilities so he thought more
of<00:01:24.210> like<00:01:24.420> kind<00:01:24.630> of<00:01:24.720> a<00:01:24.810> chuckit<00:01:25.260> toy<00:01:25.590> looking

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:03.150 
yeah I think they're pretty lucky I'm

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.390 
yeah I think they're pretty lucky I'm
lucky<00:02:03.509> to<00:02:03.659> be<00:02:04.170> able<00:02:04.259> to<00:02:04.409> do<00:02:04.470> this<00:02:04.590> to<00:02:04.799> you<00:02:05.159> is

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:05.400 
lucky to be able to do this to you is

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.280 
lucky to be able to do this to you is
students<00:02:05.670> were<00:02:05.790> our<00:02:05.909> mentors<00:02:06.299> they<00:02:07.110> did

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
students were our mentors they did

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.839 
students were our mentors they did
things<00:02:07.560> like<00:02:07.710> none<00:02:08.069> of<00:02:08.099> us<00:02:08.280> know<00:02:08.579> how<00:02:08.610> to

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
things like none of us know how to

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.180 
things like none of us know how to
solder<00:02:09.420> so<00:02:10.319> they<00:02:10.619> would<00:02:10.800> do<00:02:10.920> things<00:02:11.069> like

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
solder so they would do things like

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.920 
solder so they would do things like
solder<00:02:11.580> some<00:02:11.849> of<00:02:11.940> the<00:02:12.000> wires<00:02:12.209> into<00:02:12.510> the<00:02:12.660> boards

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
solder some of the wires into the boards

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.170 
solder some of the wires into the boards
for<00:02:13.170> us<00:02:13.319> they<00:02:14.099> would<00:02:14.220> explain<00:02:14.520> to<00:02:14.700> us<00:02:14.849> why<00:02:15.120> this

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
for us they would explain to us why this

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.010 
for us they would explain to us why this

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070

would<00:02:19.030> they<00:02:19.210> would<00:02:19.300> help<00:02:19.510> us<00:02:19.660> mount<00:02:19.990> certain

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740 
would they would help us mount certain

would they would help us mount certain
pieces<00:02:20.980> of<00:02:21.190> the<00:02:21.280> robot<00:02:21.520> together<00:02:21.880> so<00:02:22.150> that

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
pieces of the robot together so that

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.750 
pieces of the robot together so that
they<00:02:22.300> worked<00:02:22.630> correctly<00:02:23.340> there<00:02:24.340> were<00:02:24.460> a<00:02:24.490> big

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
what we have the camera set up to now

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.449 
what we have the camera set up to now
between<00:02:55.570> two<00:02:55.810> people<00:02:56.140> it<00:02:56.770> was<00:02:56.980> learning

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
this different way of programming this

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:04.470 
this different way of programming this
has<00:03:01.420> been<00:03:01.600> a<00:03:01.660> labor<00:03:02.170> of<00:03:02.350> love<00:03:02.500> it<00:03:03.010> is<00:03:03.280> six<00:03:04.270> weeks

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
has been a labor of love it is six weeks

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.310 
has been a labor of love it is six weeks
of<00:03:05.110> intensive<00:03:05.980> engineering<00:03:06.330> and<00:03:07.330> trial<00:03:08.050> and

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.320 
of intensive engineering and trial and

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.449 
of intensive engineering and trial and
error<00:03:08.650> and<00:03:09.780> frustration<00:03:10.780> and<00:03:11.050> then

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
error and frustration and then

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:14.160 
error and frustration and then
accomplishment<00:03:12.459> and<00:03:12.820> when<00:03:13.510> that<00:03:13.690> finally

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
accomplishment and when that finally

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.070 
accomplishment and when that finally
shot<00:03:14.410> that<00:03:14.650> first<00:03:14.950> basket<00:03:15.640> there<00:03:15.940> was<00:03:16.120> joy<00:03:16.570> we

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080 
shot that first basket there was joy we

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.229 
shot that first basket there was joy we
were<00:03:17.290> excited<00:03:17.890> I<00:03:18.459> think<00:03:18.670> there's<00:03:18.820> a<00:03:18.880> big<00:03:19.030> sense

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
were excited I think there's a big sense

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:21.600 
were excited I think there's a big sense
of<00:03:19.300> accomplishment<00:03:19.510> especially<00:03:20.440> since<00:03:21.400> I've

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:21.610 
of accomplishment especially since I've

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.360 
of accomplishment especially since I've
been<00:03:21.850> here<00:03:22.180> I've<00:03:22.500> been<00:03:23.500> here<00:03:23.680> constantly<00:03:24.070> I've

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
been here I've been here constantly I've

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.610 
been here I've been here constantly I've
been<00:03:24.670> able<00:03:24.760> to<00:03:24.910> see<00:03:25.180> it<00:03:25.299> from<00:03:25.380> just<00:03:26.380> movement

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
been able to see it from just movement

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.430 
been able to see it from just movement
to<00:03:27.040> the<00:03:27.070> first<00:03:27.519> time<00:03:27.670> we<00:03:27.820> shot<00:03:28.090> it<00:03:28.299> to<00:03:28.780> the

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
to the first time we shot it to the

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:30.990 
to the first time we shot it to the
first<00:03:29.650> time<00:03:29.830> we<00:03:29.950> got<00:03:30.070> the<00:03:30.160> camera<00:03:30.459> setup<00:03:30.820> and

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
first time we got the camera setup and

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.039 
first time we got the camera setup and
so<00:03:31.120> there's<00:03:31.299> a<00:03:31.360> big<00:03:31.540> sense<00:03:31.750> of<00:03:31.840> accomplishment

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:32.049 
so there's a big sense of accomplishment

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:33.990 
so there's a big sense of accomplishment
seeing<00:03:32.650> it<00:03:32.769> all<00:03:32.830> put<00:03:33.070> together<00:03:33.220> now<00:03:33.580> the<00:03:33.820> more

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
seeing it all put together now the more

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.310 
seeing it all put together now the more
you<00:03:34.030> put<00:03:34.299> into<00:03:34.450> the<00:03:34.630> project<00:03:34.780> the<00:03:35.049> more<00:03:35.230> you

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:35.320 
you put into the project the more you

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.500 
you put into the project the more you
get<00:03:35.410> out<00:03:35.470> of<00:03:35.590> it<00:03:35.799> because<00:03:36.700> if<00:03:37.120> you're<00:03:37.269> there

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
get out of it because if you're there

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.150 
get out of it because if you're there
every<00:03:37.600> day<00:03:37.720> like<00:03:38.110> you<00:03:38.260> know<00:03:38.350> working<00:03:38.680> on<00:03:38.980> it

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:40.500 
every day like you know working on it
and<00:03:39.310> then<00:03:39.459> you<00:03:39.820> finally<00:03:40.030> get<00:03:40.209> to<00:03:40.330> you<00:03:40.420> know

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
and then you finally get to you know

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.780
