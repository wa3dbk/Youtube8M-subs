00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:17.040
 video on a little my name is 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.790

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.520

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:22.560
 quiksilver games actually I had 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.349
 not to make a video before 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.820
 I have live stream this morning 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:29.279
 Some of you know that I have 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.960
 somehow I am somehow in the new often 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.850
 stood and then directly started like that 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.830
 to live stream otto though relatively early 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.710
 in the morning and everything was on the case 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:38.940
 relatively cool and stuff and it has a lot of fun 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.339
 because i will definitely tomorrow 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.449
 So again on saturday then will 

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:44.699
 I'll do it again if you're upset 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:46.170
 then you get up early in the morning and 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:48.390
 looks livestream and if not then 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.420
 but that should not be me the topic 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.589
 there i have no topic today it is 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.549
 just a basic war 

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:54.930
 fought because I had nothing 

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:57.420
 pre-produced actually thought now 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.989
 There is no such thing as joel live stream today 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.670
 Video 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.949
 but I'm also so in the live stream 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.210
 actually said but I was now 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.689
 just playing it and then I have 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:09.000
 I thought a little video is coming 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.799
 nothing special or round pixel games 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.689
 Can you really get out of here? 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.770
 so that you can still see something 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.149
 you then tell the 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.490
 maybe live streams do not track it 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:19.799
 edc and so on and yes that is often 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.780
 I am now the round again 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.149

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.719

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:27.090
 blown up 

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:29.310
 and I do not really have the damage 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.929
 getting it was nice so now 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.259
 I have to sort out now completely 

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:37.520

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:40.020
 had that was up one that was so lay 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.490
 It was a long time since that was up 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.530
 if it had been down one of them would have been me 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.700

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.259

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.850
 except that I still have a hard one too 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.920
 could get a sword could still 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.079
 be better but otherwise I have 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.439
 the best script was so i got that 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:58.170
 I have given thought still trying to 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:01.590

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.749

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.880
 gold from lindhorst in shooting at the 

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:09.630

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:13.290

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.000
 the round won was a nice round 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.810
 the video is extremely short 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.150
 White 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.340

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.420

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.780
 to say 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.880
 I just wanted something for a while 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.830
 raushauen because somehow I know too 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.989

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.360

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:38.610
 this short round quick survival games 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.930

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.700

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.840
