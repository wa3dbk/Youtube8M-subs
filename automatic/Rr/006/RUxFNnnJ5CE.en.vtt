this<00:00:11.849> is<00:00:11.969> le<00:00:12.179> it's<00:00:12.540> a<00:00:12.690> robot<00:00:13.080> that's<00:00:13.200> designed

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
this is le it's a robot that's designed

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.289 
this is le it's a robot that's designed
to<00:00:13.740> be<00:00:13.830> an<00:00:13.920> assistive<00:00:14.370> robot<00:00:14.730> for<00:00:14.940> people<00:00:15.210> with

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
to be an assistive robot for people with

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.900 
to be an assistive robot for people with
motor<00:00:15.540> impairments<00:00:15.650> it<00:00:16.650> has<00:00:16.859> two<00:00:17.160> main<00:00:17.460> ideas

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
motor impairments it has two main ideas

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.170 
motor impairments it has two main ideas
behind<00:00:18.119> it<00:00:18.449> the<00:00:18.900> first<00:00:19.140> idea<00:00:19.560> is<00:00:19.650> that<00:00:20.180> when

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
behind it the first idea is that when

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.029 
behind it the first idea is that when
commanding<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:21.840> robot<00:00:22.170> you<00:00:22.320> can<00:00:22.500> use<00:00:22.680> a<00:00:22.710> laser

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
commanding the robot you can use a laser

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.400 
commanding the robot you can use a laser
pointer<00:00:23.550> to<00:00:24.090> illuminate<00:00:24.539> an<00:00:24.660> object<00:00:25.109> and

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
pointer to illuminate an object and

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.109 
pointer to illuminate an object and
therefore<00:00:25.619> have<00:00:26.130> sort<00:00:26.400> of<00:00:26.430> this<00:00:26.580> clickable

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
therefore have sort of this clickable

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.080 
therefore have sort of this clickable
world<00:00:27.420> so<00:00:27.960> if<00:00:28.109> I<00:00:28.230> click<00:00:28.619> on<00:00:28.769> an<00:00:28.980> object<00:00:29.490> the

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
world so if I click on an object the

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.450 
world so if I click on an object the
robot<00:00:30.420> will<00:00:30.630> go<00:00:30.810> and<00:00:31.050> grasp<00:00:31.439> that<00:00:31.769> object<00:00:32.279> and

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
robot will go and grasp that object and

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.040 
robot will go and grasp that object and
pick<00:00:32.669> it<00:00:32.790> up<00:00:34.460> after<00:00:35.460> it's<00:00:35.850> gone<00:00:36.329> and<00:00:36.570> picked<00:00:36.840> up

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
pick it up after it's gone and picked up

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.440 
pick it up after it's gone and picked up
the<00:00:37.200> object<00:00:37.550> then<00:00:38.550> I<00:00:38.670> can<00:00:38.879> click<00:00:39.090> on<00:00:39.239> myself

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
the object then I can click on myself

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.750 
the object then I can click on myself
and<00:00:39.870> that<00:00:39.989> means<00:00:40.260> deliver<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:41.040> object<00:00:41.430> to<00:00:41.579> me

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
and that means deliver the object to me

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.380 
and that means deliver the object to me
if<00:00:42.690> I<00:00:43.200> click<00:00:44.190> on<00:00:44.340> somebody<00:00:44.700> else<00:00:44.850> will<00:00:45.120> deliver

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
if I click on somebody else will deliver

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.119 
if I click on somebody else will deliver
the<00:00:45.629> object<00:00:45.960> to<00:00:46.020> somebody<00:00:46.350> else<00:00:46.530> it's<00:00:46.890> also

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
the object to somebody else it's also

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.639 
the object to somebody else it's also
the<00:00:47.370> case<00:00:47.579> which<00:00:47.850> that<00:00:48.450> you<00:00:48.480> can<00:00:48.899> click<00:00:49.289> on<00:00:49.320> the

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
the case which that you can click on the

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.410 
the case which that you can click on the
top<00:00:49.829> of<00:00:50.010> a<00:00:50.070> table<00:00:50.280> and<00:00:50.670> it<00:00:50.730> will<00:00:50.789> deliver<00:00:51.270> the

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
top of a table and it will deliver the

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.610 
top of a table and it will deliver the
object<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:51.930> that<00:00:51.960> table<00:00:53.750> for<00:00:54.750> object<00:00:55.170> fetching

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
object to that table for object fetching

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.439 
object to that table for object fetching
you<00:00:56.010> have<00:00:56.250> to<00:00:56.460> be<00:00:56.610> able<00:00:56.730> to<00:00:56.850> tell<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.270> robot

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
you have to be able to tell the robot

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.990 
you have to be able to tell the robot
what<00:00:57.930> object<00:00:58.649> it<00:00:58.739> is<00:00:58.829> you<00:00:59.070> want<00:00:59.309> it<00:00:59.370> to<00:00:59.430> get<00:00:59.699> for

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
what object it is you want it to get for

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.380 
what object it is you want it to get for
you<00:01:00.090> and<00:01:00.989> right<00:01:01.199> now<00:01:01.489> robots<00:01:02.489> are<00:01:02.699> not<00:01:02.730> good<00:01:03.149> at

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
you and right now robots are not good at

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.509 
you and right now robots are not good at
understanding<00:01:04.140> language<00:01:04.379> they're<00:01:05.070> not<00:01:05.220> good

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
understanding language they're not good

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.320 
understanding language they're not good
at<00:01:05.850> understanding<00:01:06.630> your<00:01:07.590> gestures<00:01:08.400> but<00:01:09.210> they

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
at understanding your gestures but they

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.679 
at understanding your gestures but they
are<00:01:09.540> great<00:01:09.990> we<00:01:10.560> have<00:01:10.740> shown<00:01:11.010> an<00:01:11.689> understanding

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
are great we have shown an understanding

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.820 
are great we have shown an understanding
a<00:01:12.930> green<00:01:13.439> spot<00:01:13.860> put<00:01:14.549> on<00:01:14.729> top<00:01:14.939> of<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.180> object<00:01:15.830> so

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
a green spot put on top of the object so

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.350 
a green spot put on top of the object so
we<00:01:16.920> think<00:01:17.009> it's<00:01:17.189> a<00:01:17.220> really<00:01:17.400> powerful<00:01:17.640> new<00:01:18.090> way

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
we think it's a really powerful new way

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.359 
we think it's a really powerful new way
of<00:01:18.390> interacting<00:01:18.750> with<00:01:19.229> robots<00:01:19.770> this<00:01:20.070> is<00:01:20.340> a

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
of interacting with robots this is a

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.300 
of interacting with robots this is a
type<00:01:20.700> of<00:01:20.990> user<00:01:21.990> interface<00:01:22.560> it's<00:01:22.860> sort<00:01:23.070> of<00:01:23.159> like

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
type of user interface it's sort of like

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.980 
type of user interface it's sort of like
the<00:01:23.610> point-and-click<00:01:24.210> interface<00:01:24.390> that<00:01:24.930> you

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
the point-and-click interface that you

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.960 
the point-and-click interface that you
have<00:01:25.200> on<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.409> personal<00:01:25.830> computer<00:01:25.979> but<00:01:26.580> now<00:01:26.759> it's

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
have on a personal computer but now it's

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.149 
have on a personal computer but now it's
on<00:01:27.150> it's<00:01:27.509> on<00:01:27.630> a<00:01:27.689> robot<00:01:28.080> and<00:01:28.320> instead<00:01:28.920> of<00:01:29.009> just

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
on it's on a robot and instead of just

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.249 
on it's on a robot and instead of just
on<00:01:29.310> this<00:01:29.460> 2d<00:01:29.820> screen<00:01:30.210> you<00:01:30.420> have<00:01:30.600> it<00:01:30.750> for<00:01:30.990> that

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
on this 2d screen you have it for that

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.190 
on this 2d screen you have it for that
the<00:01:31.770> 3d<00:01:32.159> world<00:01:32.400> that<00:01:32.670> you're<00:01:32.850> inhabiting<00:01:33.360> what

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
the 3d world that you're inhabiting what

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.050 
the 3d world that you're inhabiting what
we've<00:01:34.350> done<00:01:34.530> is<00:01:34.710> we've<00:01:34.890> developed<00:01:34.920> an<00:01:35.610> object

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
we've done is we've developed an object

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.380 
we've done is we've developed an object
retrieval<00:01:36.630> application<00:01:37.320> for<00:01:38.250> a<00:01:38.490> robot<00:01:39.090> that

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
retrieval application for a robot that

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.569 
retrieval application for a robot that
is<00:01:39.540> supposed<00:01:40.140> to<00:01:40.200> be<00:01:40.320> a<00:01:40.350> companion<00:01:40.950> robot<00:01:41.130> that

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
is supposed to be a companion robot that

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.170 
is supposed to be a companion robot that
stays<00:01:41.909> by<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.659> side<00:01:43.140> of<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:44.070> user<00:01:44.310> throughout

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
stays by the side of the user throughout

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.240 
stays by the side of the user throughout
the<00:01:45.360> day<00:01:45.540> and<00:01:45.750> can<00:01:45.930> help<00:01:46.170> him<00:01:46.409> or<00:01:46.560> her<00:01:46.590> with

the day and can help him or her with
these<00:01:47.430> activities<00:01:47.790> of<00:01:48.060> daily<00:01:48.180> living

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
these activities of daily living

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.410 
these activities of daily living
specifically<00:01:49.259> fetching<00:01:49.860> objects<00:01:50.340> most<00:01:51.240> of

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
specifically fetching objects most of

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.510 
specifically fetching objects most of
what<00:01:51.570> you<00:01:51.689> see<00:01:51.930> are<00:01:52.079> these<00:01:52.229> flat<00:01:52.560> surfaces<00:01:53.220> and

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
what you see are these flat surfaces and

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.399 
what you see are these flat surfaces and
that's<00:01:54.030> where<00:01:54.240> you<00:01:54.329> find<00:01:54.570> objects<00:01:55.229> and<00:01:55.350> the

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
that's where you find objects and the

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.889 
that's where you find objects and the
objects<00:01:55.740> that<00:01:55.829> are<00:01:55.979> important<00:01:56.369> to<00:01:56.549> us<00:01:56.670> so<00:01:57.090> we

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
objects that are important to us so we

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.030 
objects that are important to us so we
wanted<00:01:58.140> to<00:01:58.200> build<00:01:58.259> a<00:01:58.380> robot<00:01:58.619> that<00:01:58.680> would<00:01:58.860> take

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
wanted to build a robot that would take

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.649 
wanted to build a robot that would take
advantage<00:01:59.520> of<00:01:59.610> that<00:01:59.729> structure<00:02:00.090> and<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.540> way

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
advantage of that structure and the way

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:01.940 
advantage of that structure and the way
that<00:02:00.869> le<00:02:01.079> takes<00:02:01.439> advantage<00:02:01.799> of<00:02:01.890> that

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
that le takes advantage of that

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.459 
that le takes advantage of that
structure<00:02:02.399> is<00:02:02.820> by<00:02:03.090> being<00:02:03.479> able<00:02:03.600> to<00:02:03.750> move<00:02:04.140> its

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
structure is by being able to move its

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.880 
structure is by being able to move its
arm<00:02:04.860> and<00:02:05.189> its<00:02:05.729> sensors<00:02:06.210> up<00:02:06.509> and<00:02:06.899> down<00:02:07.110> so<00:02:07.710> I<00:02:07.740> can

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
arm and its sensors up and down so I can

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.380 
arm and its sensors up and down so I can
move<00:02:07.979> all<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.340> way<00:02:08.459> down<00:02:08.729> to<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.060> floor<00:02:09.239> with

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.130 
its sensors and for any of those
different<00:02:15.280> heights<00:02:15.520> it's<00:02:15.970> able<00:02:16.240> to<00:02:16.420> use<00:02:16.930> the

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
different heights it's able to use the

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.380 
different heights it's able to use the
same<00:02:17.410> strategy<00:02:17.650> for<00:02:18.340> grasping<00:02:18.850> the<00:02:19.000> object

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
same strategy for grasping the object

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.540 
same strategy for grasping the object
that's<00:02:19.569> out<00:02:19.720> there<00:02:19.959> it<00:02:20.380> doesn't<00:02:20.590> have<00:02:20.860> to<00:02:21.100> to

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
that's out there it doesn't have to to

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.970 
that's out there it doesn't have to to
change<00:02:21.819> the<00:02:22.090> way<00:02:22.180> it<00:02:22.300> does<00:02:22.480> things<00:02:22.780> by<00:02:23.050> based

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
change the way it does things by based

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.160 
change the way it does things by based
on<00:02:24.190> the<00:02:24.310> height<00:02:24.490> of<00:02:24.730> these<00:02:24.850> various<00:02:25.209> surfaces

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
on the height of these various surfaces

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.530 
on the height of these various surfaces
this<00:02:26.950> is<00:02:27.130> a<00:02:27.190> collaboration<00:02:27.670> between<00:02:27.910> Georgia

important collaboration because what it
allows<00:02:35.530> us<00:02:35.560> to<00:02:35.860> do<00:02:35.980> is<00:02:36.100> make<00:02:36.340> sure<00:02:36.370> that<00:02:36.640> the

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
allows us to do is make sure that the

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.479 
allows us to do is make sure that the
robot<00:02:37.510> were<00:02:37.750> creating<00:02:38.650> is<00:02:39.010> going<00:02:39.280> to<00:02:39.370> meet

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
robot were creating is going to meet

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:42.479 
robot were creating is going to meet
real<00:02:39.819> needs<00:02:40.120> and<00:02:40.450> help<00:02:40.989> real<00:02:41.230> people<00:02:41.489> so

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
real needs and help real people so

real needs and help real people so
through<00:02:43.239> this<00:02:43.360> collaboration<00:02:43.870> we're<00:02:44.230> able<00:02:44.350> to

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
through this collaboration we're able to

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:45.840 
through this collaboration we're able to
work<00:02:44.590> with<00:02:44.890> patients<00:02:45.100> were<00:02:45.640> able<00:02:45.820> to

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
work with patients were able to

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:47.670 
work with patients were able to
interview<00:02:46.150> patients<00:02:46.390> and<00:02:46.870> eventually<00:02:47.530> we'll

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
interview patients and eventually we'll

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.650 
interview patients and eventually we'll
be<00:02:47.709> having<00:02:48.190> these<00:02:48.489> robots<00:02:48.910> actually

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
be having these robots actually

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.240 
be having these robots actually
interacting<00:02:50.200> with<00:02:50.320> patients<00:02:50.500> to<00:02:50.800> make<00:02:51.070> sure

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
interacting with patients to make sure

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.400 
interacting with patients to make sure
that<00:02:51.489> the<00:02:52.030> robot<00:02:52.390> meets<00:02:52.720> these<00:02:52.989> people's

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
that the robot meets these people's

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.680 
that the robot meets these people's
needs
