00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.120
 hello the world then today 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.679
 little video that is a video care 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.480
 so it's a care for the forks 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.150
 rotten then it's not mandatory to 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.500
 do this to do this only 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.300
 when the fork and could you 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.980
 create it very well when there you 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.510
 have a healthy range either at 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.189
 to be able to infect your 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.470
 fork even if it is not rotten 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.539
 so it's a care that has two 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.880
 parts a cleaning part and a 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.290
 part of the infective then there will be 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.059
 two videos care for the forks 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.489
 rotten so this one is another that 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.440
 will be right after I hope these 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.879
 small recipes will please you and I 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.890
 leave you right away with the video 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.750
 for the owners do not hesitate to 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.670
 do this method regularly for 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.120
 avoid rotting there is no 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.500
 against indication on this are to do 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.930
 it will be you will need several 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.399
 elements of a first serum 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.620
 physiological that can be found in 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.149
 supermarkets then you will need 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.250
 hydrogen peroxide that we can 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.140
 also find in supermarkets and 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.380
 betadine and yellow that we can 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:10.950
 find a pharmacy and also 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.659
 terrible gas compresses for 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.850
 start this care first 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.979
 perfectly clean the 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.070
 fork so you have to very well 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.380
 clear it remove all the earth turns 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.630
 all the dirt that's on the 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.360
 fork so for that one must first 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.790
 used the heart which then 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.040
 will use a hoof brush to 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.070
 really brush the fork for 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.689
 really that there is nothing left and 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.390
 then we can use a cloth 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:42.840
 to really absorb moisture in 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:45.380
 Too much too much if it's raining is really 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.000
 remove any mud that may remain 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:51.020
 stuck on the fork or who is 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.020
 really stuck to the fork 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.720
 no 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.720
 and 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.720
 2 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:43.760
 it's a really important step 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.959
 do not do it in their opinion 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.549
 that you really have to take your time 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:48.500
 is really taking his time from everything 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:50.510
 everything all removed so all the earth 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.549
 that there remains all the land that there is so 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.069
 it's really long but you have to 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:56.540
 really really really everything or 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:59.560
 remove that's really the key to the 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.560
 success for this treatment 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.739
 2 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.220
 2 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.340
 so first of all we'll start with 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:38.090
 the oxygenated water so what is it going to serve 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:40.220
 so oxygenated water will be used to eliminate 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.170
 the bacteria so in the range is 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.790
 find anaerobic bacteria so 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:45.680
 these are the bacteria that he without 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:48.680
 developing oxygen that is 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.840
 develops forgiveness without oxygen so the water 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.800
 oxygenated will bring oxygen and 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:56.390
 so will eliminate the bacteria 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.980
 oxygenate is not a basic 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:00.200
 disinfectant is a detergent 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:03.020
 but in this case it will serve as 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:05.030
 disinfectant so here we apply 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:09.050
 oxygenate people-there gaps do the dianes 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:11.000
 and lateral gaps on the side so 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:13.040
 in the case of a rotten fork but 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.260
 really rotten oxygenate will lather 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.209
 abundantly the zero rate range 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:19.790
 is not rotten so it does not foam 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:21.410
 So here it is very very well 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:24.650
 must be allowed to act on the hydrogen peroxide during 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:28.210
 30 seconds or so and then we go 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:28.210
 with reims and with saline 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:35.600
 then we go to reims and oxygenate with 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.430
 the cir in physiology 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.830
 so here is the pipe ethics is so 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:42.800
 at the reims the lateral and median gaps 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:44.480
 So here we must be well 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.820
 teeth the gaps with the small pipette 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:49.790
 it's used to that so you have to do well 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:53.360
 rinse thoroughly especially do not 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:55.660
 hesitate he sees himself there normally he 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.660
 would be standing 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:06.200
 then we would learn sterile gas and we 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:08.990
 just dry just 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:10.310
 fork of which wiped the serum 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:14.510
 physiological simply so that 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:16.160
 the fork is almost dry and 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:18.200
 then we will apply betadine 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.820
 yellow simply for good 

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:23.920
 thoroughly disinfect the fork for 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:23.920
 team signed more tub 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:30.610
 1 

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:43.640
 for 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:45.680
 and then we come to click so the 

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:48.910
 betadine still in the gaps 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:52.400
 lateral and median is where location 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:55.010
 most often the bacteria so that's it 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:58.280
 we're in Africa and we'll let it work 

00:05:55.010 --> 00:06:00.490
 betadine for about a good 

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.490
 minute 

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:18.979
 and last step so it's to try 

00:06:16.879 --> 00:06:21.020
 betadine that there is between high doubs 

00:06:18.979 --> 00:06:22.430
 which the surplus of betadine that there is on 

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:23.419
 the fork so between the gaps 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:26.389
 medial and lateral 

00:06:23.419 --> 00:06:28.610
 no that's with a sterile gauze have 

00:06:26.389 --> 00:06:31.129
 to wipe off betadine is normally 

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:33.139
 the care is over so here I hope 

00:06:31.129 --> 00:06:34.490
 that this little video care will have you 

00:06:33.139 --> 00:06:36.259
 more you would have helped for them 

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:38.810
 rotten forks do not hesitate to do 

00:06:36.259 --> 00:06:41.240
 this care regularly in winter for your 

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:43.279
 lousy so you wolf and less 

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:44.419
 the rotten forks because that's 

00:06:43.279 --> 00:06:47.319
 really something unpleasant 

00:06:44.419 --> 00:06:50.270
 as much for you as for him I imagine 

00:06:47.319 --> 00:06:51.800
 so do not hesitate to do this care 

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:53.779
 regularly there is no against 

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:55.099
 indications I hope once again that 

00:06:53.779 --> 00:06:56.810
 this video will have pleased you and we 

00:06:55.099 --> 00:06:58.520
 found very very very very very 

00:06:56.810 --> 00:07:00.919
 soon for the second part of 

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:02.449
 caring for rotten forks so at all 

00:07:00.919 --> 00:07:04.689
 immediately for the second big part 

00:07:02.449 --> 00:07:04.689
 kisses
