 I will appear 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:27.330
 I think the highlight of this musical is Heidi's way of life 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:31.320
 Live always cheerful and the innocent always strong in it without discouraged even in adversity 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:33.620
 Or go changed the people around us at the sight of the Heidi 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:39.440
 So say Heidi 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:40.880
 It would be nice to tell everyone who came to see how bright and invigorated 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.160

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:20.240
 I'm really nervous to go a total of 9 every time 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:26.780
