00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
this video we would like to explain why

this video we would like to explain why
that<00:01:16.799> would<00:01:16.979> be<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.250> case<00:01:17.280> in<00:01:17.700> at<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:17.909> same

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
that would be the case in at the same

that would be the case in at the same

time offer some of our solutions for
their<00:01:20.250> problem<00:01:20.490> let's<00:01:21.150> just<00:01:21.420> begin<00:01:21.570> with<00:01:21.869> the

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
their problem let's just begin with the

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.200 
their problem let's just begin with the
comparison<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.530> better<00:01:22.799> fit<00:01:22.979> three<00:01:23.250> if<00:01:23.460> you<00:01:23.909> as

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
comparison to better fit three if you as

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.270 
comparison to better fit three if you as
a<00:01:24.240> leaker<00:01:24.720> realized<00:01:25.259> that<00:01:25.530> an<00:01:25.650> enemy<00:01:25.950> jet<00:01:26.130> was

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
a leaker realized that an enemy jet was

a leaker realized that an enemy jet was
focusing<00:01:26.790> you<00:01:26.939> what<00:01:27.270> you<00:01:27.450> gonna<00:01:27.990> want<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.320> do

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
focusing you what you gonna want to do

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.230 
focusing you what you gonna want to do
is<00:01:28.650> to<00:01:28.890> fly<00:01:29.250> up<00:01:29.400> to<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.670> maximum<00:01:29.970> flight

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
is to fly up to the maximum flight

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.880 
is to fly up to the maximum flight
ceiling<00:01:30.600> or<00:01:30.780> at<00:01:30.900> least<00:01:31.110> gain<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:31.439> few<00:01:31.710> hundred

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
ceiling or at least gain a few hundred

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.340 
ceiling or at least gain a few hundred
meters<00:01:32.340> of<00:01:32.460> altitude<00:01:32.630> this<00:01:33.630> is<00:01:33.780> because<00:01:33.900> the

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
meters of altitude this is because the

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.440 
meters of altitude this is because the
enemy<00:01:34.560> jet<00:01:34.860> will<00:01:35.070> most<00:01:35.310> likely<00:01:35.640> use<00:01:36.090> its

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
enemy jet will most likely use its

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.660 
enemy jet will most likely use its
biggest<00:01:36.930> advantage<00:01:37.439> over<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.920> heli<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:38.310> that

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
biggest advantage over the heli and that

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.819 
biggest advantage over the heli and that
is<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:39.180> attack<00:01:39.450> him<00:01:39.630> from<00:01:39.659> a<00:01:39.930> very<00:01:40.140> steep<00:01:40.530> or

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
is to attack him from a very steep or

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.710 
is to attack him from a very steep or
maybe<00:01:41.070> even<00:01:41.159> 90<00:01:41.670> degree<00:01:42.000> angle<00:01:42.420> from<00:01:42.450> above

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
maybe even 90 degree angle from above

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.139 
maybe even 90 degree angle from above
because<00:01:43.409> that<00:01:43.619> way<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:44.189> helicopter<00:01:44.759> cannot

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
because that way the helicopter cannot

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.450 
because that way the helicopter cannot
shoot<00:01:45.329> back<00:01:45.630> at<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:45.930> jet<00:01:46.140> anymore<00:01:46.560> so<00:01:47.189> if

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
shoot back at the jet anymore so if

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.609 
shoot back at the jet anymore so if
you're<00:01:47.970> as<00:01:48.270> a<00:01:48.299> helicopter<00:01:48.570> pilot<00:01:48.930> are<00:01:49.350> flying

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
you're as a helicopter pilot are flying

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.319 
you're as a helicopter pilot are flying
close<00:01:49.860> to<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.130> ground<00:01:50.250> and<00:01:50.610> see<00:01:50.850> that<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.149> jet

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
close to the ground and see that the jet

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.149 
close to the ground and see that the jet
is<00:01:51.479> attacking<00:01:51.899> you<00:01:52.020> from<00:01:52.049> above<00:01:52.530> you<00:01:52.979> would

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
is attacking you from above you would

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.670 
is attacking you from above you would
pull<00:01:53.549> up<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.850> nose<00:01:54.030> to<00:01:54.329> give<00:01:54.630> your<00:01:54.840> gonna<00:01:55.350> some

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
pull up the nose to give your gonna some

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.649 
pull up the nose to give your gonna some
