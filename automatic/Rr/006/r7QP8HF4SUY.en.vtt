Apple 2 series as you can see right from

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:23.990 
Apple 2 series as you can see right from
the<00:00:23.460> design

the design

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.689

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
see an interesting thing about this 2 GS

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.970 
see an interesting thing about this 2 GS
is<00:00:51.000> that<00:00:51.270> it<00:00:51.899> wasn't<00:00:52.320> so<00:00:52.590> much<00:00:52.649> of<00:00:52.890> an

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
is that it wasn't so much of an

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.580 
is that it wasn't so much of an
all-in-one<00:00:53.370> unit<00:00:53.789> as<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.840> previous<00:00:55.350> ones

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
all-in-one unit as the previous ones

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.069 
all-in-one unit as the previous ones
work<00:00:55.860> where<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:57.000> keyboard<00:00:57.210> was<00:00:57.629> built<00:00:57.899> in

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
work where the keyboard was built in

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.310 
work where the keyboard was built in
this<00:00:58.770> was<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.100> first<00:00:59.430> Apple<00:00:59.879> 2<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:00.809> have<00:01:00.989> a

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
this was the first Apple 2 to have a

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.060 
this was the first Apple 2 to have a
separate<00:01:02.070> keyboard<00:01:02.449> from<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.600> unit<00:01:04.070> and

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
separate keyboard from the unit and

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.280 
separate keyboard from the unit and
since<00:01:05.400> it<00:01:05.519> was<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.700> last<00:01:06.030> Apple<00:01:06.510> 2<00:01:06.659> it<00:01:07.140> also

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
since it was the last Apple 2 it also

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.399 
since it was the last Apple 2 it also
used<00:01:07.619> a<00:01:07.830> mouse<00:01:08.070> as<00:01:08.400> its<00:01:08.610> primary<00:01:09.110> input<00:01:10.110> device

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
used a mouse as its primary input device

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.350 
used a mouse as its primary input device
here<00:01:11.280> you<00:01:11.340> can<00:01:11.460> see<00:01:11.610> just<00:01:11.790> some<00:01:12.000> more<00:01:12.150> of<00:01:12.270> the

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.420 
here you can see just some more of the
style<00:01:13.049> of<00:01:13.290> these<00:01:13.530> snow-white<00:01:14.070> design

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
back of the two gs we can see that

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.569 
back of the two gs we can see that
they're<00:01:30.329> very<00:01:30.630> much<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:31.079> same<00:01:31.350> as<00:01:31.619> some<00:01:32.460> of

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
have a very easy to open design so you

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.240 
have a very easy to open design so you

quarter inch drive and you can see you

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.150 
quarter inch drive and you can see you
can<00:03:06.420> kind<00:03:06.570> of<00:03:06.690> daisy<00:03:06.930> chain<00:03:07.320> the<00:03:07.680> disk<00:03:07.890> drives

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
can kind of daisy chain the disk drives

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.740 
can kind of daisy chain the disk drives
with<00:03:08.670> an<00:03:08.790> extra<00:03:09.150> part<00:03:09.360> of<00:03:09.420> the<00:03:09.540> back

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.440 
with an extra part of the back
considering<00:03:10.620> the<00:03:10.739> 2<00:03:10.980> GS<00:03:11.250> only<00:03:11.610> had<00:03:11.790> one<00:03:12.120> port

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
considering the 2 GS only had one port

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.660 
considering the 2 GS only had one port
for<00:03:13.020> a<00:03:13.050> floppy<00:03:13.500> drive<00:03:13.709> so<00:03:14.280> it's<00:03:14.370> similar<00:03:14.520> to

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
for a floppy drive so it's similar to

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.460 
for a floppy drive so it's similar to
have<00:03:14.790> thunder<00:03:15.090> rolls<00:03:15.300> of<00:03:15.450> today<00:03:15.690> and<00:03:16.200> of

have thunder rolls of today and of

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:17.570 
have thunder rolls of today and of
course<00:03:16.680> here's<00:03:16.890> the<00:03:16.950> five<00:03:17.190> and<00:03:17.370> a<00:03:17.400> quarter

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
course here's the five and a quarter

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.180 
course here's the five and a quarter
inch<00:03:17.760> drive<00:03:18.180> and<00:03:18.450> really<00:03:19.170> that<00:03:19.470> attention<00:03:20.040> and

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
inch drive and really that attention and

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:21.770 
inch drive and really that attention and
detail<00:03:20.280> is<00:03:20.580> amazing<00:03:21.000> even<00:03:21.150> in<00:03:21.360> the<00:03:21.450> power

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
detail is amazing even in the power

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.680 
detail is amazing even in the power
connectors<00:03:22.320> and<00:03:22.530> the<00:03:22.650> cords<00:03:23.610> it<00:03:23.820> is<00:03:24.450> very

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
connectors and the cords it is very

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.930 
connectors and the cords it is very
characteristic<00:03:25.019> of<00:03:25.560> Apple<00:03:25.920> so<00:03:26.549> of<00:03:26.610> course<00:03:26.760> you

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
characteristic of Apple so of course you

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.759 
characteristic of Apple so of course you
can<00:03:26.970> plug<00:03:27.269> that<00:03:27.420> into<00:03:27.480> the<00:03:27.840> back<00:03:28.049> and<00:03:28.560> along

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
can plug that into the back and along

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:30.289 
can plug that into the back and along
with<00:03:28.950> a<00:03:29.160> mouse<00:03:29.400> and<00:03:29.430> a<00:03:29.700> keyboard<00:03:29.730> you're

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
with a mouse and a keyboard you're

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:32.509 
with a mouse and a keyboard you're
almost<00:03:30.540> up<00:03:30.870> and<00:03:31.080> running<00:03:31.410> and<00:03:31.560> this<00:03:32.040> used<00:03:32.280> the

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
can see how the 2e is very similar uses

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.539

Emmett 2 plus were actually the least

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
how the 2 GS did it of course you can

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.430 
how the 2 GS did it of course you can
just<00:04:00.060> see<00:04:00.180> how<00:04:00.330> the<00:04:00.390> lack<00:04:00.720> of<00:04:00.900> a<00:04:00.989> keyboard

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
just see how the lack of a keyboard

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.620 
just see how the lack of a keyboard
maybe<00:04:01.980> the<00:04:02.100> two<00:04:02.250> Gs<00:04:02.519> just<00:04:02.820> much<00:04:03.030> smaller<00:04:03.390> than

its predecessors and of course you

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.150 
its predecessors and of course you
