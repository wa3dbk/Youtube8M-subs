the hill down the road here and see if

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:15.320 
the hill down the road here and see if
we<00:03:13.800> can<00:03:13.980> hit<00:03:14.100> that<00:03:14.130> 51<00:03:14.700> which<00:03:14.850> I'm<00:03:14.970> pretty<00:03:15.180> sure

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
we can hit that 51 which I'm pretty sure

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.630 
we can hit that 51 which I'm pretty sure
it<00:03:15.420> does<00:03:15.570> guarantee<00:03:16.380> you'll<00:03:16.530> hit<00:03:16.680> it<00:03:16.740> yeah<00:03:17.310> I

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
it does guarantee you'll hit it yeah I

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.350 
it does guarantee you'll hit it yeah I
hit<00:03:18.480> 50<00:03:18.630> fina<00:03:19.140> like<00:03:19.350> that<00:03:19.590> so<00:03:20.120> there's<00:03:21.120> that

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
hit 50 fina like that so there's that
