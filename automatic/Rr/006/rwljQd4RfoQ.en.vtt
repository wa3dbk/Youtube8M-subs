00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
you have to escape that room it's like a

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.349 
you have to escape that room it's like a
little<00:00:23.820> chain<00:00:24.180> reaction<00:00:25.849> this<00:00:26.849> second

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
little chain reaction this second

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.589 
little chain reaction this second
obstacle<00:00:27.990> right<00:00:28.349> here<00:00:28.619> is<00:00:28.980> some<00:00:29.939> really<00:00:30.179> steep

have to route jump up on go get the

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.350 
have to route jump up on go get the
library<00:00:37.739> jump<00:00:38.070> to<00:00:38.309> get<00:00:38.730> through<00:00:38.969> that<00:00:39.059> part

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
library jump to get through that part

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.950 
library jump to get through that part
the<00:00:40.140> third<00:00:40.379> part<00:00:40.739> there<00:00:41.190> is<00:00:41.399> a<00:00:41.629> dumpster<00:00:42.629> like

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
the third part there is a dumpster like

a dumpster trap and you have to grab it

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.220 
a dumpster trap and you have to grab it
and<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:47.280> lot<00:00:47.730> of<00:00:47.789> people<00:00:48.120> go<00:00:48.600> around<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:49.200> other

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
and a lot of people go around the other

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.590 
and a lot of people go around the other
side<00:00:49.530> so<00:00:50.160> they<00:00:50.280> grabbed<00:00:50.579> a<00:00:50.789> little<00:00:51.059> over<00:00:51.360> like

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
side so they grabbed a little over like

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.130 
side so they grabbed a little over like
a<00:00:51.920> envies<00:00:52.920> but<00:00:53.309> is<00:00:54.120> that<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.390> where<00:00:54.989> you're

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
a envies but is that the where you're

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.510 
a envies but is that the where you're
supposed<00:00:55.199> to<00:00:55.379> go<00:00:55.469> is<00:00:55.649> actually<00:00:55.949> behind<00:00:56.100> where

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
supposed to go is actually behind where

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.209 
supposed to go is actually behind where
the<00:00:56.640> dumpster<00:00:57.030> was<00:00:57.239> so<00:00:57.660> kinda<00:00:58.649> tricky<00:00:59.010> but

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
the dumpster was so kinda tricky but

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.920 
the dumpster was so kinda tricky but
most<00:00:59.940> people<00:01:00.270> figure<00:01:00.660> it<00:01:00.750> out<00:01:02.629> once<00:01:03.629> you<00:01:03.780> get

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
most people figure it out once you get

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.820 
most people figure it out once you get
through<00:01:04.140> this<00:01:04.700> we<00:01:05.700> on<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:05.880> third<00:01:06.299> one<00:01:06.830> which

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
through this we on the third one which

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.960 
through this we on the third one which
is<00:01:07.860> a<00:01:08.390> ballroom<00:01:09.680> talk<00:01:10.680> about<00:01:10.920> their<00:01:11.130> second

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.850 

sometimes<00:01:14.970> you<00:01:15.210> get<00:01:15.300> stuck<00:01:15.540> in<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.290> window

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
sometimes you get stuck in the window

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.520 
sometimes you get stuck in the window
panel<00:01:17.250> right<00:01:17.400> there<00:01:17.610> but<00:01:17.880> if<00:01:18.840> you<00:01:18.990> just<00:01:19.200> crouch

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
panel right there but if you just crouch

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.490 
panel right there but if you just crouch
and<00:01:19.710> jump<00:01:20.040> really<00:01:20.610> like<00:01:21.390> really<00:01:21.720> rapidly<00:01:22.200> then

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
and jump really like really rapidly then

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.790 
and jump really like really rapidly then
you<00:01:23.490> mostly<00:01:24.060> time<00:01:24.270> get<00:01:24.479> through<00:01:24.690> this<00:01:25.470> is<00:01:25.680> the

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:25.800 
you mostly time get through this is the

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.820 
you mostly time get through this is the
ballroom<00:01:26.400> and<00:01:26.729> you<00:01:27.360> have<00:01:27.479> to<00:01:27.630> get<00:01:28.440> to<00:01:28.560> avoid

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:28.830 
ballroom and you have to get to avoid

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:30.380 
ballroom and you have to get to avoid
the<00:01:28.979> teleporters<00:01:29.550> that<00:01:29.700> are<00:01:29.790> on<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:29.970> side<00:01:30.180> and

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
the teleporters that are on the side and

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.440 
the teleporters that are on the side and
maybe<00:01:30.600> people<00:01:30.810> on<00:01:31.020> a<00:01:31.080> bad<00:01:31.950> but<00:01:32.369> normally<00:01:33.300> these

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
maybe people on a bad but normally these

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.570 
maybe people on a bad but normally these
balls<00:01:33.780> are<00:01:33.990> like<00:01:34.110> bouncing<00:01:34.590> around<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:35.160> lot

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
balls are like bouncing around a lot

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.430 
balls are like bouncing around a lot
faster<00:01:36.060> than<00:01:36.119> what<00:01:36.300> they<00:01:36.420> are<00:01:36.450> now<00:01:36.570> because

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:37.440 
faster than what they are now because

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.469 
faster than what they are now because
people<00:01:37.830> shoot<00:01:38.070> them<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:39.000> that<00:01:39.150> makes<00:01:39.300> it<00:01:39.360> a

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
people shoot them and that makes it a

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.770 
people shoot them and that makes it a
lot<00:01:39.750> harder<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:40.260> get

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
lot harder to get

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.280 
lot harder to get
and<00:01:42.140> they<00:01:42.920> basically<00:01:43.130> stay<00:01:43.729> still<00:01:44.090> and<00:01:44.290> won't

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290 
and they basically stay still and won't

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:50.950 
and they basically stay still and won't
be<00:01:45.440> as<00:01:45.530> hard<00:01:46.180> the<00:01:47.180> the<00:01:48.140> fourth<00:01:48.500> one<00:01:48.830> is<00:01:49.900> kind<00:01:50.900> of

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
be as hard the the fourth one is kind of

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.719 
be as hard the the fourth one is kind of
like<00:01:51.049> a<00:01:51.110> brain<00:01:51.350> teaser<00:01:51.740> you<00:01:52.040> gotta<00:01:52.190> figure<00:01:52.580> you

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
like a brain teaser you gotta figure you

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:54.670 
like a brain teaser you gotta figure you
just<00:01:52.880> kind<00:01:53.060> of<00:01:53.119> figured<00:01:53.509> out<00:01:53.690> and<00:01:53.990> you<00:01:54.590> know

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 
just kind of figured out and you know

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.310 
just kind of figured out and you know
like<00:01:55.369> for<00:01:55.640> a<00:01:55.670> lot<00:01:55.820> of<00:01:55.850> people<00:01:55.940> take<00:01:56.330> some<00:01:56.540> quite

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
like for a lot of people take some quite

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.280 
like for a lot of people take some quite
a<00:01:57.350> bit<00:01:57.500> of<00:01:57.590> time<00:01:57.770> to<00:01:57.920> figure<00:01:58.130> it<00:01:58.310> out<00:01:58.720> they<00:01:59.720> they

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
a bit of time to figure it out they they

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.749 
a bit of time to figure it out they they
have<00:02:00.440> to<00:02:00.590> go<00:02:00.740> by<00:02:00.920> trial<00:02:01.250> and<00:02:01.369> error<00:02:03.430> there<00:02:04.430> is<00:02:04.729> a

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 
have to go by trial and error there is a

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:08.260 
have to go by trial and error there is a
palette<00:02:05.540> up<00:02:05.690> top<00:02:06.040> you<00:02:07.040> break<00:02:07.310> it<00:02:07.340> grab<00:02:08.030> with

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
palette up top you break it grab with

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.510 
palette up top you break it grab with
falls<00:02:08.600> and<00:02:09.080> this<00:02:09.560> is<00:02:09.739> where<00:02:09.920> people<00:02:10.039> go<00:02:10.220> crazy

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
falls and this is where people go crazy

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.059 
falls and this is where people go crazy
I<00:02:10.910> grab<00:02:11.239> the<00:02:11.390> grab<00:02:11.630> lifting<00:02:12.110> can't<00:02:12.739> figure<00:02:12.950> out

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
I grab the grab lifting can't figure out

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:14.699 
I grab the grab lifting can't figure out
what<00:02:13.220> to<00:02:13.310> do<00:02:13.489> with

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
what to do with

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:18.220 
what to do with
there's<00:02:15.709> like<00:02:15.860> a<00:02:15.890> little<00:02:16.660> door<00:02:17.660> right<00:02:18.050> there

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
there's like a little door right there

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.080 
there's like a little door right there
and<00:02:18.560> you<00:02:18.590> throw<00:02:19.160> it<00:02:19.190> in<00:02:19.310> between<00:02:19.430> the<00:02:19.760> door<00:02:19.970> in

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
and you throw it in between the door in

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.839 
and you throw it in between the door in
the<00:02:20.180> fence<00:02:20.420> wall<00:02:20.750> and<00:02:21.200> it<00:02:21.800> will<00:02:22.010> raise<00:02:22.489> up<00:02:22.819> the

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:22.849 
the fence wall and it will raise up the

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:29.070 
the fence wall and it will raise up the
Mongoose<00:02:25.989> eventually<00:02:26.989> it's<00:02:27.379> so<00:02:27.620> tight<00:02:27.980> like<00:02:28.220> a

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
Mongoose eventually it's so tight like a

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.509 
Mongoose eventually it's so tight like a
amount<00:02:30.080> of<00:02:30.170> space<00:02:30.379> between<00:02:30.590> Africans<00:02:31.280> wall

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519 
amount of space between Africans wall

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:34.089 
amount of space between Africans wall
and<00:02:31.730> doors<00:02:32.360> so<00:02:32.750> perfect<00:02:33.260> that<00:02:33.440> it<00:02:33.650> takes<00:02:33.860> a

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:34.099 
and doors so perfect that it takes a

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:35.650 
and doors so perfect that it takes a
while<00:02:34.250> for<00:02:34.310> the<00:02:34.610> gravel<00:02:35.000> to<00:02:35.150> actually<00:02:35.450> drop

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
while for the gravel to actually drop

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.870 
while for the gravel to actually drop
down<00:02:35.989> so<00:02:36.800> a<00:02:36.830> lot<00:02:37.010> of<00:02:37.040> people<00:02:37.190> will<00:02:37.370> throw<00:02:37.670> it<00:02:37.790> in

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
down so a lot of people will throw it in

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
down so a lot of people will throw it in
there<00:02:38.060> and<00:02:38.120> think<00:02:38.330> that<00:02:38.390> that's<00:02:38.569> the<00:02:38.720> wrong

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
there and think that that's the wrong

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.370 
there and think that that's the wrong
place<00:02:39.290> and<00:02:40.090> not<00:02:41.090> like<00:02:41.540> they'll<00:02:41.720> destroy<00:02:42.110> and

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
place and not like they'll destroy and

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.470 
place and not like they'll destroy and
try<00:02:42.590> to<00:02:42.650> place<00:02:43.130> won't<00:02:43.730> be<00:02:43.879> able<00:02:44.000> to<00:02:44.120> beat<00:02:44.269> the

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
try to place won't be able to beat the

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.410 
try to place won't be able to beat the
map<00:02:44.750> just<00:02:44.780> because<00:02:45.349> of<00:02:45.500> that<00:02:47.019> the<00:02:48.019> next<00:02:48.319> one

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420

it was kind of inspired all right he was

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:35.530 
it was kind of inspired all right he was
using<00:03:30.160> my

fusion coils rolling down

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.710 
fusion coils rolling down
then<00:03:42.040> you<00:03:42.220> go<00:03:42.460> down

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
then you go down

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.300 
then you go down

it's<00:03:47.310> kind<00:03:47.550> of<00:03:47.580> cool

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780

flying across the map but there's a part
that<00:04:34.490> I<00:04:34.639> can't<00:04:34.940> do<00:04:35.210> well<00:04:35.660> I<00:04:35.870> can<00:04:36.110> barely<00:04:36.440> do

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 
that I can't do well I can barely do

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.339 
that I can't do well I can barely do
I've<00:04:36.949> done<00:04:37.160> it<00:04:37.280> a<00:04:37.370> couple<00:04:37.400> times<00:04:37.780> if<00:04:38.780> they<00:04:38.990> get

00:04:39.339 --> 00:04:39.349 
I've done it a couple times if they get

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:43.930 
I've done it a couple times if they get
on<00:04:39.500> the<00:04:40.360> radio<00:04:41.360> antennas<00:04:42.080> and<00:04:42.669> try<00:04:43.669> to<00:04:43.729> make<00:04:43.880> it

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940 
on the radio antennas and try to make it

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.089 
on the radio antennas and try to make it
across<00:04:44.270> I<00:04:44.780> haven't<00:04:45.110> really<00:04:45.259> found<00:04:45.620> out<00:04:45.860> what

00:04:46.089 --> 00:04:46.099 
across I haven't really found out what

00:04:46.099 --> 00:04:48.820 
across I haven't really found out what
the<00:04:46.220> best<00:04:46.340> strategy<00:04:46.669> for<00:04:47.410> beating<00:04:48.410> that<00:04:48.530> part

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
the best strategy for beating that part

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:52.960 
the best strategy for beating that part
is<00:04:49.009> but<00:04:49.720> it's<00:04:50.720> pretty<00:04:50.870> hard<00:04:51.400> go<00:04:52.400> to<00:04:52.460> some

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:52.970 
is but it's pretty hard go to some

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:55.809 
is but it's pretty hard go to some
barricades<00:04:53.509> and<00:04:54.099> you<00:04:55.099> have<00:04:55.220> to<00:04:55.340> drive<00:04:55.550> really

00:04:55.809 --> 00:04:55.819 
barricades and you have to drive really

00:04:55.819 --> 00:04:57.850 
barricades and you have to drive really
fast<00:04:55.940> it's<00:04:56.509> like<00:04:56.599> its<00:04:56.840> best<00:04:57.050> possible<00:04:57.349> over

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:57.860 
fast it's like its best possible over

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.400 
fast it's like its best possible over
the<00:04:57.889> barricades<00:04:58.460> and<00:04:58.820> I<00:04:59.030> have<00:04:59.720> done<00:04:59.930> this<00:05:00.110> part

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:00.410 
the barricades and I have done this part

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:02.469 
the barricades and I have done this part
a<00:05:00.530> few<00:05:00.710> times<00:05:00.979> it's<00:05:01.340> not<00:05:01.520> as<00:05:01.759> hard<00:05:02.000> is<00:05:02.210> there<00:05:02.449> a

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:02.479 
a few times it's not as hard is there a

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:04.450 
a few times it's not as hard is there a
on<00:05:02.810> Jenna<00:05:03.020> part<00:05:03.349> but<00:05:03.590> it's<00:05:04.190> still<00:05:04.400> hard

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:04.460 
on Jenna part but it's still hard

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:08.050 
on Jenna part but it's still hard
because<00:05:05.120> there's<00:05:05.479> a<00:05:05.570> gap<00:05:05.780> and<00:05:06.789> micro<00:05:07.789> there's

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:08.060 
because there's a gap and micro there's

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.540 
because there's a gap and micro there's
a<00:05:08.120> gap<00:05:08.300> in<00:05:08.330> between<00:05:08.599> there<00:05:09.050> and<00:05:09.080> give<00:05:09.860> it<00:05:10.039> if

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:10.550 
a gap in between there and give it if

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:11.860 
a gap in between there and give it if
you're<00:05:10.699> not<00:05:10.789> going<00:05:11.120> fast<00:05:11.300> enough<00:05:11.479> you<00:05:11.660> won't

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:11.870 
you're not going fast enough you won't

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:15.659 
you're not going fast enough you won't
make<00:05:12.050> it<00:05:12.259> basically<00:05:12.770> then<00:05:14.080> here's<00:05:15.080> just<00:05:15.409> some

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:15.669 
make it basically then here's just some

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:19.149 
make it basically then here's just some
overviews<00:05:16.669> of<00:05:16.699> the<00:05:17.000> map<00:05:17.210> and<00:05:17.509> you<00:05:17.919> can<00:05:18.919> see<00:05:19.070> how

00:05:19.149 --> 00:05:19.159 
overviews of the map and you can see how

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:21.189 
overviews of the map and you can see how
pretty<00:05:19.430> it<00:05:19.639> looks<00:05:19.669> it<00:05:20.150> looks<00:05:20.180> actually<00:05:20.780> like<00:05:21.169> a

00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:21.199 
pretty it looks it looks actually like a

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:25.120 
pretty it looks it looks actually like a
actual<00:05:22.009> roller<00:05:22.280> coaster<00:05:23.169> well<00:05:24.169> that<00:05:24.889> was<00:05:24.979> too

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:25.130 
actual roller coaster well that was too

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:29.620 
actual roller coaster well that was too
many<00:05:25.310> actually's<00:05:26.530> but<00:05:28.000> that's<00:05:29.000> the<00:05:29.270> two<00:05:29.449> new

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:29.630 
many actually's but that's the two new

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:31.810 
many actually's but that's the two new
maps<00:05:29.990> will<00:05:30.349> one<00:05:30.800> of<00:05:30.919> them's<00:05:31.039> new<00:05:31.280> challenger

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:31.820 
maps will one of them's new challenger

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:36.129 
maps will one of them's new challenger
coaster<00:05:32.180> is<00:05:32.360> new<00:05:32.630> and<00:05:34.150> amazing<00:05:35.150> is<00:05:35.659> not<00:05:35.930> I

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:36.139 
coaster is new and amazing is not I

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:37.570 
coaster is new and amazing is not I
still<00:05:36.320> have<00:05:36.409> ninety<00:05:36.620> three<00:05:36.800> dollars<00:05:37.190> left<00:05:37.370> on

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:37.580 
still have ninety three dollars left on

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:39.580 
still have ninety three dollars left on
amazing<00:05:38.180> and<00:05:38.300> I'm<00:05:38.389> probably<00:05:38.659> going<00:05:38.960> to<00:05:39.050> find

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:39.590 
amazing and I'm probably going to find

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:41.950 
amazing and I'm probably going to find
some<00:05:39.860> more<00:05:40.219> stuff<00:05:40.490> to<00:05:40.669> put<00:05:40.849> on<00:05:40.909> it<00:05:41.210> make<00:05:41.930> a

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:41.960 
some more stuff to put on it make a

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.740 
some more stuff to put on it make a
little<00:05:42.199> bit<00:05:42.320> more<00:05:42.500> challenging<00:05:43.389> by<00:05:44.389> the<00:05:44.449> way

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:44.750 
little bit more challenging by the way

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:48.450 
little bit more challenging by the way
the<00:05:45.650> coaster<00:05:46.219> is<00:05:46.430> really<00:05:47.090> really<00:05:47.300> hard<00:05:47.630> so

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:48.460 
the coaster is really really hard so

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:51.909 
the coaster is really really hard so
just<00:05:49.460> be<00:05:49.639> warned
