00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
switch that comes with this particular

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.229 
switch that comes with this particular
amp<00:00:47.210> so<00:00:47.870> we're<00:00:47.989> gonna<00:00:48.079> go<00:00:48.289> in<00:00:48.379> to<00:00:48.469> clean<00:00:49.180> and<00:00:50.180> I
