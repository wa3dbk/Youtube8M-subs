00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
these loading boundaries you'll kind of

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.609 
these loading boundaries you'll kind of
you'll<00:01:36.390> get<00:01:36.509> interrupted<00:01:37.020> it's<00:01:37.290> not<00:01:37.470> like<00:01:37.590> a

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
you'll get interrupted it's not like a

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.149 
you'll get interrupted it's not like a
lag<00:01:38.040> out<00:01:38.250> but<00:01:38.549> you<00:01:38.670> can<00:01:38.820> definitely<00:01:39.030> notice<00:01:39.479> it

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
there's a loading boundary right across

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.899 
there's a loading boundary right across
the<00:01:43.380> wall<00:01:43.590> in<00:01:43.799> edgeville<00:01:44.130> going<00:01:44.610> into<00:01:44.820> the

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
the wall in edgeville going into the

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.499 
the wall in edgeville going into the
wildy<00:01:45.240> and<00:01:46.009> back<00:01:47.009> in<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.280> day<00:01:47.520> this<00:01:48.210> used<00:01:48.390> to

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
wildy and back in the day this used to

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:49.850 
wildy and back in the day this used to
kill<00:01:48.720> a<00:01:48.750> lot<00:01:48.899> of<00:01:48.930> people<00:01:49.020> because<00:01:49.530> it<00:01:49.710> gets

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
kill a lot of people because it gets

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.740 
kill a lot of people because it gets
pecked<00:01:50.159> out<00:01:50.340> they<00:01:50.729> like<00:01:50.759> hit<00:01:51.299> that<00:01:51.450> loading

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
pecked out they like hit that loading

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.319 
pecked out they like hit that loading
boundary<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:52.610> so<00:01:53.610> they<00:01:53.729> get<00:01:53.880> specked<00:01:54.180> out

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
boundary and so they get specked out

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.709 
boundary and so they get specked out
because<00:01:54.689> it<00:01:54.810> would<00:01:55.259> be<00:01:55.290> like<00:01:55.470> an<00:01:55.619> interruption

00:01:56.709 --> 00:01:56.719 
because it would be like an interruption

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:59.569 
because it would be like an interruption
just<00:01:57.719> a<00:01:57.810> slight<00:01:58.049> interruption<00:01:58.399> most<00:01:59.399> of<00:01:59.520> you

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
just a slight interruption most of you

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:00.709 
just a slight interruption most of you
probably<00:01:59.610> know<00:01:59.909> what<00:02:00.030> I'm<00:02:00.090> talking<00:02:00.240> about<00:02:00.420> if
