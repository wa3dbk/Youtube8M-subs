that<00:03:13.850> you're<00:03:14.000> going<00:03:14.209> to<00:03:14.300> do<00:03:14.510> you're<00:03:14.690> going<00:03:14.870> to

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.050 
that you're going to do you're going to

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.940 
that you're going to do you're going to
pin<00:03:15.380> that<00:03:15.560> down

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
pin that down

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.840 
pin that down
so<00:03:16.640> I'm<00:03:16.730> going<00:03:16.970> to<00:03:17.120> take<00:03:17.470> my<00:03:18.470> bobby<00:03:18.709> pin<00:03:19.160> I'm

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
so I'm going to take my bobby pin I'm

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:23.880 
so I'm going to take my bobby pin I'm
going<00:03:20.150> to<00:03:20.569> just<00:03:20.930> take<00:03:21.410> the<00:03:21.650> hair<00:03:21.920> and<00:03:21.950> swip<00:03:22.459> it

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:35.990 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:39.190 

so<00:03:36.740> then<00:03:36.890> you<00:03:37.010> basically<00:03:37.430> just<00:03:37.550> are<00:03:38.390> lifting

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
so then you basically just are lifting

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.970 
so then you basically just are lifting
just<00:03:40.000> to<00:03:41.000> get<00:03:41.180> the<00:03:41.330> height<00:03:41.770> that<00:03:42.770> you<00:03:42.830> desire

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.690 
just to get the height that you desire
and<00:03:45.010> then<00:03:46.010> you're<00:03:46.100> going<00:03:46.220> to<00:03:46.280> just<00:03:46.400> take<00:03:46.550> your

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
and then you're going to just take your

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.050 
and then you're going to just take your
comb<00:03:46.970> and<00:03:47.420> just<00:03:48.260> run<00:03:48.560> it<00:03:48.590> through<00:03:49.430> just<00:03:49.880> to

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
comb and just run it through just to

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.400 
comb and just run it through just to
make<00:03:50.210> sure<00:03:50.240> there's<00:03:50.570> no<00:03:50.750> gaps<00:03:51.020> and<00:03:51.290> spaces<00:03:53.410> so

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 
make sure there's no gaps and spaces so

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:56.130 
make sure there's no gaps and spaces so
next<00:03:54.650> you're<00:03:54.830> going<00:03:55.130> to<00:03:55.340> just<00:03:55.610> start<00:03:55.730> off<00:03:55.850> by

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:56.140 
next you're going to just start off by

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.290 
next you're going to just start off by
starting<00:03:57.140> sectioning<00:03:58.010> and<00:03:58.760> starting<00:03:59.120> with<00:03:59.240> a

00:03:59.290 --> 00:03:59.300 
starting sectioning and starting with a

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
starting sectioning and starting with a
very<00:04:00.020> small<00:04:00.470> tiny<00:04:00.860> player<00:04:01.870> you<00:04:02.870> want<00:04:02.960> to<00:04:03.050> comb

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:03.320 
very small tiny player you want to comb

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:07.480 
very small tiny player you want to comb
it<00:04:03.470> out<00:04:05.260> and<00:04:06.260> then<00:04:06.920> you're<00:04:07.010> going<00:04:07.130> to<00:04:07.220> take

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:07.490

your flat out or cut it out and you're
just<00:04:09.440> going<00:04:09.920> to<00:04:09.950> basically<00:04:10.420> going<00:04:11.420> to<00:04:11.570> slide

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.810 
just going to basically going to slide

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:13.900 
just going to basically going to slide
about<00:04:12.140> halfway<00:04:12.470> down<00:04:12.860> and<00:04:13.640> then<00:04:13.730> you're<00:04:13.880> going

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:13.910 
about halfway down and then you're going

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:17.830 
about halfway down and then you're going
to<00:04:14.150> start<00:04:14.360> to<00:04:14.690> turn<00:04:15.250> and<00:04:16.250> then<00:04:16.910> when<00:04:17.390> you<00:04:17.570> turn

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:22.040 
you just slide it through and you're

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.460 
you just slide it through and you're
going<00:04:22.160> to<00:04:22.220> get<00:04:22.430> like<00:04:22.700> a<00:04:22.880> loose<00:04:23.450> wavy<00:04:23.990> curl<00:04:24.260> like

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:24.470 
going to get like a loose wavy curl like

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:37.680 
going to get like a loose wavy curl like
this<00:04:26.260> I<00:04:27.610> want<00:04:28.610> to<00:04:28.760> section<00:04:29.240> off<00:04:29.480> another<00:04:29.870> piece

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:51.589 

slide<00:04:39.000> turn<00:04:40.050> and<00:04:41.250> discontinue<00:04:42.250> sliding

00:04:51.589 --> 00:04:51.599 

00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:53.540 

if<00:04:52.110> you're<00:04:52.409> done<00:04:52.559> with<00:04:52.770> that<00:04:52.800> you<00:04:53.219> can<00:04:53.369> just

section

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:07.070 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:30.600 

you

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:30.610 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.120 

when<00:05:31.450> you<00:05:31.600> get<00:05:31.750> to<00:05:31.930> the<00:05:32.140> very<00:05:32.440> bottom<00:05:32.560> layer

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:33.130 
when you get to the very bottom layer

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:36.000 
when you get to the very bottom layer
you<00:05:33.610> don't<00:05:33.640> have<00:05:33.970> to<00:05:34.150> curl<00:05:34.510> everything<00:05:35.290> you

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:36.010 
you don't have to curl everything you

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:40.950 
you don't have to curl everything you
can<00:05:36.220> just<00:05:36.940> curl<00:05:37.210> the<00:05:37.570> very<00:05:39.390> bottom<00:05:40.390> of<00:05:40.570> it<00:05:40.750> and

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:40.960 
can just curl the very bottom of it and

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:42.360 
can just curl the very bottom of it and
that<00:05:41.230> makes<00:05:41.410> any<00:05:41.650> type<00:05:41.800> of<00:05:41.830> since<00:05:42.130> you<00:05:42.220> can

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:42.370 
that makes any type of since you can

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:46.500 
that makes any type of since you can
start<00:05:42.580> really<00:05:42.940> low<00:05:43.180> and<00:05:44.010> just<00:05:45.010> like<00:05:45.510> loosely

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:46.510 
start really low and just like loosely

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:50.130 
start really low and just like loosely
