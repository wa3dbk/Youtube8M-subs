but let's have a look and see whether

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.700 
but let's have a look and see whether
after<00:00:32.640> three<00:00:33.270> weeks<00:00:33.540> of<00:00:33.809> chairman<00:00:34.320> really

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
after three weeks of chairman really

after three weeks of chairman really
intensely<00:00:35.160> and<00:00:35.520> even<00:00:36.059> really<00:00:36.510> struggling

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
extra calories that I was gonna give a

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.010 
extra calories that I was gonna give a
lot<00:00:50.520> of<00:00:50.579> Bobby<00:00:51.180> there<00:00:51.600> might<00:00:51.809> be<00:00:51.840> a

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
lot of Bobby there might be a

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.560 
lot of Bobby there might be a
little<00:00:52.410> bit<00:00:52.739> on<00:00:52.920> there<00:00:53.190> but<00:00:53.699> I'm<00:00:54.000> pretty

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570

little bit on there but I'm pretty
confident<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.440> majority<00:00:56.010> of<00:00:56.160> it<00:00:56.280> is<00:00:56.370> muscle

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
confident the majority of it is muscle

probably look at those measurements and

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.710 
probably look at those measurements and
see<00:01:15.840> how<00:01:16.020> many<00:01:16.229> inches<00:01:16.380> I've<00:01:16.710> gone<00:01:16.920> up<00:01:17.720> right

arms that are coming in at just over 16
inches<00:01:22.830> this<00:01:23.670> week<00:01:23.939> I<00:01:24.180> measure<00:01:24.450> them<00:01:24.689> under

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
inches this week I measure them under

happy of that rank ice on the money to

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.740 
happy of that rank ice on the money to
the<00:01:34.229> egg<00:01:34.350> measurement<00:01:34.920> we<00:01:35.400> were<00:01:35.579> 24<00:01:36.240> on<00:01:36.600> the
