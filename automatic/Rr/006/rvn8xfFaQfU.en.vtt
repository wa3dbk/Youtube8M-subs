as<00:02:04.130> I<00:02:04.460> mentioned<00:02:04.490> earlier<00:02:05.000> we<00:02:05.390> have<00:02:05.570> all<00:02:05.780> sorts

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.050 
as I mentioned earlier we have all sorts

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:07.990 
as I mentioned earlier we have all sorts
of<00:02:06.110> great<00:02:06.230> functionality<00:02:06.710> built<00:02:07.010> in<00:02:07.250> so<00:02:07.550> we

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
of great functionality built in so we

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.940 
of great functionality built in so we
have<00:02:08.119> your<00:02:08.210> capacitive<00:02:08.840> touch<00:02:09.020> wheels<00:02:09.290> so

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
have your capacitive touch wheels so

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.040 
have your capacitive touch wheels so
they're<00:02:10.100> touch<00:02:10.250> sensitive<00:02:10.729> and<00:02:10.940> also<00:02:11.300> give

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
they're touch sensitive and also give

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:13.900 
they're touch sensitive and also give
you<00:02:12.200> control<00:02:12.590> over<00:02:12.920> the<00:02:13.250> functionality<00:02:13.790> such

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
you control over the functionality such

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:15.790 
you control over the functionality such
as<00:02:14.000> scratching<00:02:14.600> and<00:02:14.720> pitch<00:02:14.840> spin<00:02:15.170> you<00:02:15.620> have

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
as scratching and pitch spin you have

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.740 
as scratching and pitch spin you have
sliders<00:02:16.130> such<00:02:16.460> as<00:02:16.580> your<00:02:16.730> pitch<00:02:16.910> slider<00:02:17.180> you

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
sliders such as your pitch slider you

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.630 
sliders such as your pitch slider you
have<00:02:17.930> all<00:02:18.080> your<00:02:18.200> looping<00:02:18.590> functions<00:02:19.070> you<00:02:19.430> also

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
have all your looping functions you also

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.490 
have all your looping functions you also
have<00:02:19.850> eq<00:02:20.360> control<00:02:20.780> because<00:02:21.080> of<00:02:21.200> course<00:02:21.380> you're

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
have eq control because of course you're

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.170 
have eq control because of course you're
doing<00:02:21.710> all<00:02:21.890> your<00:02:22.010> mixing<00:02:22.370> now<00:02:22.490> in<00:02:22.550> your<00:02:22.700> ipad

of<00:02:23.690> course<00:02:23.750> if<00:02:24.080> you<00:02:24.140> don't<00:02:24.320> just<00:02:24.560> want<00:02:24.680> to<00:02:24.710> mix

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
of course if you don't just want to mix

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:25.900 
of course if you don't just want to mix
with<00:02:24.950> your<00:02:25.100> ipad<00:02:25.460> you<00:02:25.580> want<00:02:25.700> to<00:02:25.760> plug

with your ipad you want to plug

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.430 
with your ipad you want to plug
something<00:02:25.940> else<00:02:26.390> in<00:02:26.630> if<00:02:26.990> you<00:02:27.110> take<00:02:27.290> a<00:02:27.320> look

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
something else in if you take a look

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:28.750 
something else in if you take a look
down<00:02:27.680> on<00:02:27.710> the<00:02:27.920> front<00:02:28.190> here<00:02:28.400> you'll<00:02:28.580> notice

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
down on the front here you'll notice

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.790 
down on the front here you'll notice
that<00:02:28.940> there's<00:02:29.270> a<00:02:29.330> microphone<00:02:29.750> input<00:02:30.350> you'll

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
that there's a microphone input you'll

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.830 
that there's a microphone input you'll
also<00:02:31.040> notice<00:02:31.430> that<00:02:31.640> there's<00:02:31.970> a<00:02:32.030> line<00:02:32.390> input<00:02:32.750> on

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
also notice that there's a line input on

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.140 
also notice that there's a line input on
the<00:02:32.960> front<00:02:32.990> of<00:02:33.230> it<00:02:33.320> for<00:02:33.530> volume<00:02:34.310> control<00:02:34.730> we

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
the front of it for volume control we

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.750 
the front of it for volume control we
have<00:02:35.180> knob<00:02:35.540> controls<00:02:36.040> which<00:02:37.040> is<00:02:37.160> ideal<00:02:37.400> in

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
have knob controls which is ideal in

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:38.980 
have knob controls which is ideal in
this<00:02:37.850> particular<00:02:38.030> working<00:02:38.570> environment

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:38.990 
this particular working environment

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:40.480 
this particular working environment
because<00:02:39.260> you<00:02:39.410> know<00:02:39.500> what<00:02:39.709> if<00:02:39.860> the<00:02:40.040> application

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:40.490 
because you know what if the application

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:42.400 
because you know what if the application
wants<00:02:40.730> to<00:02:40.880> change<00:02:41.060> the<00:02:41.150> volume<00:02:41.390> well<00:02:41.780> that

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
wants to change the volume well that

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.020 
wants to change the volume well that
happens<00:02:42.770> automatically<00:02:43.310> your<00:02:43.520> LEDs<00:02:43.850> will

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
happens automatically your LEDs will

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.120 
happens automatically your LEDs will
just<00:02:44.300> and<00:02:44.570> you'll<00:02:44.660> be<00:02:44.750> able<00:02:44.870> to<00:02:45.100> know<00:02:46.100> exactly

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
just and you'll be able to know exactly

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:47.860 
just and you'll be able to know exactly
where<00:02:46.670> you<00:02:46.790> are<00:02:46.820> at<00:02:47.060> all<00:02:47.120> times<00:02:47.390> and<00:02:47.600> it<00:02:47.780> will

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
where you are at all times and it will

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.720 
where you are at all times and it will
actually<00:02:48.050> move<00:02:48.380> for<00:02:48.650> you<00:02:48.800> when<00:02:49.340> it<00:02:49.430> needs<00:02:49.610> to

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
actually move for you when it needs to

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.840 
actually move for you when it needs to
you<00:02:50.330> have<00:02:50.450> a<00:02:50.480> crossfader<00:02:51.080> of<00:02:51.320> course<00:02:51.620> you<00:02:52.580> also

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
you have a crossfader of course you also

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.600 
you have a crossfader of course you also
have<00:02:53.240> effects<00:02:53.630> control<00:02:54.160> so<00:02:55.160> if<00:02:55.430> you're

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
have effects control so if you're

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.270 
have effects control so if you're
working<00:02:55.850> with<00:02:56.060> effects<00:02:57.050> control<00:02:57.440> on<00:02:57.620> this<00:02:57.800> we

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
working with effects control on this we

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.010 
working with effects control on this we
take<00:02:58.489> advantage<00:02:58.640> the<00:02:59.090> ipad<00:02:59.480> for<00:02:59.750> its<00:02:59.840> touch

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.020
