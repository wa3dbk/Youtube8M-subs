 times the crossover and lazy piece how 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.520
 it works because there are a lot of 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.650
 people who ordered the last fair 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.250
 how does it work from six pieces and the 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.630
 consumers 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.439

 if you like more than seven satellites 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.939
 the boats more or less accurate if 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.759

 now we're going to show here 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.060
 the jps how does it work now in 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.680
 go out with the boats if you see 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.750

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:45.609
 meters to the other side it's more 

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:47.560
 or less 500 m here and now for 

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:50.049
 save the spot now where 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.959
 the boats have at the moment one 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:56.019
 will take now position 1 have 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:59.799
 pushed here one can also if the blue blue 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:00.909
 and it says here recorded here is 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:03.849
 now six years the place and 

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:06.670
 recorded at 25 meters and if you want 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:09.970
 now during the night 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:12.489
 this even places if you ride on the 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:16.660
 same place to push only here 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:20.620
 once position 1 again the button 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:22.900
 blue is here once drive and after the 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.599
 boat and leave here from the edge until 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:28.560
 the 25 meters where you put the first 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:28.560
 your spot 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.879
 and now if you see I could 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:37.680
 he too still on a second place 

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:39.780
 it means now that not only 27 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:44.159
 but where is the first position before 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:46.739
 of the county after the 25 meters the 

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:49.379
 next will put more but he wanted 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:53.849
 put one more time 21 22 23 25 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:56.219
 meters plus here and now I 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:59.000
 want to save the second place I 

00:03:56.219 --> 00:04:01.560
 take now position number 2 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.889
 again the blue button hÃ©rault 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:11.280
 and again safe now the 

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:12.720
 two shots saved here 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.419
 now you see the boat and 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.160
 holds other side the universe and 

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:20.220
 now you show us show 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.329
 you if you come back from here begins 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.360
 how it works 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:26.340
 if you see here the blue button here the 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:29.310
 red button if the red button it 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:31.590
 got here in the middle of the white button the 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:35.300
 boats and the really in front of you and 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.300
 you take back your boat 

00:04:53.739 --> 00:04:58.579
 this is the boat he had now 

00:04:56.269 --> 00:05:01.189
 in front of you see you he is now 

00:04:58.579 --> 00:05:02.749
 body to put everything for you but if 

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:08.359
 you still want a little con room is 

00:05:02.749 --> 00:05:10.639
 exactly on the square that's it if you 

00:05:08.359 --> 00:05:13.639
 now buy a bow and 4 with 

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:17.539
 now reggie piece editing is 

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:20.059
 free in addition to me I will use already 

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:22.759
 the jps since two years and never the 

00:05:20.059 --> 00:05:25.189
 problems with sensible really nickel it 

00:05:22.759 --> 00:05:27.079
 roll to the point point point that wants 

00:05:25.189 --> 00:05:29.659
 to say if I wanted now on a 

00:05:27.079 --> 00:05:33.319
 spot the precise thirty centimeters 

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:35.239
 it's really effective with Egypt and 

00:05:33.319 --> 00:05:38.719
 hassoun does not need now 

00:05:35.239 --> 00:05:40.939
 markers proposed concerts you ask 

00:05:38.719 --> 00:05:41.360
 your spill love on the spot but during 

00:05:40.939 --> 00:05:44.479
 the night 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:46.039
 it's really very effective 

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:47.599
 in addition we still had one 

00:05:46.039 --> 00:05:50.919
 new product except guillaume naud 

00:05:47.599 --> 00:05:54.829
 now also had a portable gps 

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:58.849
 that means it's going to fix here on the 

00:05:54.829 --> 00:06:02.689
 Omega boat scratch and in addition this 

00:05:58.849 --> 00:06:04.459
 portable gps to use this anywhere 

00:06:02.689 --> 00:06:05.839
 which boat is now so in 

00:06:04.459 --> 00:06:08.299
 fraud attack 

00:06:05.839 --> 00:06:10.759
 you can serve on all boats 

00:06:08.299 --> 00:06:12.769
 and that's also very very interesting 

00:06:10.759 --> 00:06:15.069
 for people who suffered piece given 

00:06:12.769 --> 00:06:15.069
 per turn
