00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
for a new battery you will notice that

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.740 
for a new battery you will notice that
there<00:00:35.640> are<00:00:35.760> some<00:00:36.030> batteries<00:00:36.239> that<00:00:36.630> are

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
there are some batteries that are

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.770 
there are some batteries that are
labeled<00:00:36.930> OAM<00:00:37.620> and<00:00:37.950> some<00:00:38.250> that<00:00:38.370> are<00:00:38.489> not<00:00:38.780> you

labeled OAM and some that are not you

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.780 
labeled OAM and some that are not you
will<00:00:39.899> also<00:00:40.110> notice<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.920> significant<00:00:41.610> price

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
will also notice the significant price

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.479 
will also notice the significant price
difference<00:00:42.270> between<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.719> two<00:00:43.219> most<00:00:44.219> people

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
difference between the two most people

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.729 
difference between the two most people
assume<00:00:44.850> that<00:00:44.879> since<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.450> OEM<00:00:45.899> batteries<00:00:46.410> are

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
assume that since the OEM batteries are

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.350 
assume that since the OEM batteries are
more<00:00:46.920> expensive<00:00:47.280> they<00:00:47.789> are<00:00:47.940> much<00:00:48.149> higher

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
more expensive they are much higher

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.060 
more expensive they are much higher
quality<00:00:48.629> battery<00:00:49.289> but<00:00:49.590> this<00:00:49.770> isn't

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
quality battery but this isn't

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.029 
quality battery but this isn't
necessarily<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.700> case

00:00:52.029 --> 00:00:52.039 
necessarily the case

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:54.260

om stands for original equipment

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.150 
om stands for original equipment
manufacturers<00:00:55.140> so<00:00:55.440> when<00:00:55.620> looking<00:00:55.829> at

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
manufacturers so when looking at

manufacturers so when looking at
batteries<00:00:56.280> you<00:00:56.730> will<00:00:56.850> see<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.420> specific

00:01:33.599 --> 00:01:33.609 
confusing numbers but this is the rating

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:35.880 
confusing numbers but this is the rating
that<00:01:33.729> really<00:01:33.969> matters<00:01:34.299> keep<00:01:35.140> in<00:01:35.319> mind<00:01:35.530> that

00:01:37.529 --> 00:01:37.539 
this isn't a measurement of time it

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:39.839 
this isn't a measurement of time it
really<00:01:37.569> depends<00:01:38.259> on<00:01:38.319> how<00:01:38.979> long<00:01:39.310> you're<00:01:39.640> using

00:01:59.219 --> 00:01:59.229 
this battery will give you more battery

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:04.889 
this battery will give you more battery

batteries are batteries that have a much

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:08.759 
batteries are batteries that have a much

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:08.769 
higher milliamps an hour rating so they

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:10.859 
higher milliamps an hour rating so they
will<00:02:08.920> give<00:02:09.069> you<00:02:09.239> significantly<00:02:10.239> more<00:02:10.509> battery

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
will give you significantly more battery

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:12.930 
will give you significantly more battery

double<00:02:13.470> but<00:02:14.470> remember<00:02:14.980> that<00:02:15.010> the<00:02:15.400> physical

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
double but remember that the physical

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.280 
double but remember that the physical
size<00:02:16.150> of<00:02:16.299> the<00:02:16.390> battery<00:02:16.540> is<00:02:16.840> going<00:02:17.049> to<00:02:17.170> be

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
size of the battery is going to be

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.170 
size of the battery is going to be
slightly<00:02:17.650> larger<00:02:18.129> than<00:02:18.640> your<00:02:18.790> original

slightly larger than your original

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.089 
slightly larger than your original
battery<00:02:19.510> so<00:02:20.170> you<00:02:20.260> will<00:02:20.379> need<00:02:20.560> an<00:02:20.709> extended

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:21.099 
battery so you will need an extended

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:23.039 
battery so you will need an extended
door<00:02:21.519> in<00:02:21.849> order<00:02:22.090> for<00:02:22.450> the<00:02:22.510> extended<00:02:22.930> battery

to fit some extended batteries come with

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:28.020 
to fit some extended batteries come with
the<00:02:26.590> store<00:02:26.859> but<00:02:27.099> some<00:02:27.250> of<00:02:27.340> them<00:02:27.459> do<00:02:27.579> not<00:02:27.609> so

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
the store but some of them do not so

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.800 
the store but some of them do not so
it's<00:02:28.180> something<00:02:28.359> to<00:02:28.510> take<00:02:28.780> into

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
it's something to take into

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.599 
it's something to take into
consideration<00:02:29.049> when<00:02:30.040> purchasing<00:02:30.489> an

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:30.609

consideration when purchasing an
extended<00:02:31.060> battery<00:02:32.880> if<00:02:33.880> you<00:02:34.150> receive<00:02:34.540> your

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
extended battery if you receive your

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.539 
extended battery if you receive your
