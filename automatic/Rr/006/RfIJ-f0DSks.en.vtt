with<00:01:53.670> my<00:01:53.820> opportunity<00:01:54.299> that's<00:01:54.479> it<00:01:54.630> so<00:01:54.869> that's

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
with my opportunity that's it so that's

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.950 
with my opportunity that's it so that's
why<00:01:55.500> I<00:01:55.799> do<00:01:56.219> that<00:01:56.579> if<00:01:57.090> you<00:01:57.329> want<00:01:57.479> to<00:01:57.540> pair<00:01:57.750> it<00:01:57.780> up

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
why I do that if you want to pair it up

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.679 
why I do that if you want to pair it up
you<00:01:58.740> know<00:01:58.860> if<00:01:59.070> this<00:01:59.399> is<00:01:59.579> clicked<00:01:59.850> on<00:02:00.030> uncheck

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
you know if this is clicked on uncheck

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:01.730 
you know if this is clicked on uncheck
it

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
it

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.069 
it
and<00:02:01.829> you're<00:02:02.640> going<00:02:02.820> to<00:02:02.880> see<00:02:03.150> this<00:02:03.570> pair<00:02:03.930> right

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
and you're going to see this pair right

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.830 
and you're going to see this pair right
here<00:02:04.409> just<00:02:04.860> click<00:02:04.950> on<00:02:05.310> it<00:02:05.460> and<00:02:05.610> do<00:02:06.180> exactly

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
here just click on it and do exactly

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.290 
here just click on it and do exactly
what<00:02:07.049> it<00:02:07.170> tells<00:02:07.470> you<00:02:07.740> so<00:02:08.369> not<00:02:08.789> too<00:02:08.940> far<00:02:08.970> away

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
what it tells you so not too far away

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.089 
what it tells you so not too far away
from<00:02:09.420> your<00:02:09.750> you<00:02:09.929> can<00:02:10.080> be<00:02:10.200> a<00:02:10.229> couple<00:02:10.830> like<00:02:11.069> a

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
from your you can be a couple like a

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
you don't really have to do this pair

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.930 
you don't really have to do this pair
thing<00:02:36.000> it<00:02:36.540> should<00:02:36.900> work<00:02:37.049> automatically<00:02:37.940> if

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
thing it should work automatically if

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.360 
thing it should work automatically if
you<00:02:39.120> really<00:02:39.600> do<00:02:39.810> have<00:02:40.049> to<00:02:40.319> just<00:02:40.650> the<00:02:40.920> press

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.280 
you really do have to just the press
pair<00:02:41.730> but<00:02:42.360> before<00:02:42.720> the<00:02:42.840> one<00:02:42.959> that<00:02:42.989> I<00:02:43.140> would

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
pair but before the one that I would

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:44.660 
pair but before the one that I would
check<00:02:43.530> the<00:02:43.709> batteries<00:02:44.130> if<00:02:44.370> they're<00:02:44.580> all

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
check the batteries if they're all

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.220 
check the batteries if they're all
carrying<00:02:45.030> your<00:02:45.120> remote<00:02:45.390> control<00:02:45.720> they

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
carrying your remote control they

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.830 
carrying your remote control they
usually<00:02:46.350> last<00:02:46.980> a<00:02:47.220> very<00:02:47.250> long<00:02:47.970> time<00:02:48.209> I've<00:02:48.660> seen

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
usually last a very long time I've seen

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.330 
usually last a very long time I've seen
many<00:02:49.080> more<00:02:49.200> controls<00:02:49.590> with<00:02:49.769> the<00:02:49.860> same<00:02:50.040> battery

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
many more controls with the same battery

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.699 
many more controls with the same battery
after<00:02:50.760> three<00:02:51.030> years<00:02:51.060> that's<00:02:51.840> usually<00:02:52.680> because

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
after three years that's usually because

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.640 
after three years that's usually because
people<00:02:53.160> don't<00:02:53.310> use<00:02:53.400> them<00:02:53.549> as<00:02:53.730> much<00:02:54.060> but<00:02:54.840> it's

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
people don't use them as much but it's

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.020 
people don't use them as much but it's
also<00:02:55.860> because<00:02:56.100> they're<00:02:56.340> really<00:02:56.610> good<00:02:56.819> and

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
also because they're really good and

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.729 
also because they're really good and
doesn't<00:02:57.390> use<00:02:57.540> that<00:02:57.750> much<00:02:57.900> energy<00:02:58.140> anyways

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
doesn't use that much energy anyways

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:00.350 
doesn't use that much energy anyways
your<00:02:58.920> remote<00:02:59.130> control<00:02:59.459> so<00:02:59.880> that's<00:03:00.000> one<00:03:00.180> of<00:03:00.269> the

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
your remote control so that's one of the

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.650 
your remote control so that's one of the
reasons<00:03:00.660> why<00:03:00.810> these<00:03:01.049> last<00:03:01.319> so<00:03:01.830> long<00:03:02.660> however

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
reasons why these last so long however

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.140 
reasons why these last so long however
do<00:03:04.140> check<00:03:04.410> your<00:03:04.590> batteries<00:03:04.890> first<00:03:05.160> before<00:03:05.370> you

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
do check your batteries first before you

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.259 
do check your batteries first before you
have<00:03:06.480> to<00:03:06.720> go<00:03:07.019> through<00:03:07.350> the<00:03:07.470> pairing<00:03:07.799> process

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:08.269 
have to go through the pairing process

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:10.580 
have to go through the pairing process
that's<00:03:09.269> all<00:03:09.420> you<00:03:09.480> have<00:03:09.600> to<00:03:09.720> do<00:03:09.840> to<00:03:10.109> pair<00:03:10.410> your

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
that's all you have to do to pair your

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.280 
that's all you have to do to pair your
remote<00:03:11.040> controls<00:03:11.459> so<00:03:12.450> here<00:03:12.660> you<00:03:12.810> see<00:03:12.840> the<00:03:13.079> menu

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
remote controls so here you see the menu

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.479 
remote controls so here you see the menu
ok<00:03:14.510> Menu<00:03:15.510> key<00:03:15.540> and<00:03:15.900> then<00:03:15.959> the<00:03:16.140> next<00:03:16.410> keys<00:03:16.620> so

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
ok Menu key and then the next keys so

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.520 
ok Menu key and then the next keys so
just<00:03:18.030> do<00:03:18.209> exactly<00:03:18.450> what<00:03:18.930> it<00:03:19.019> tells<00:03:19.200> you<00:03:19.410> you

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
just do exactly what it tells you you

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.470 
just do exactly what it tells you you
should<00:03:19.709> be<00:03:19.739> able<00:03:19.859> to<00:03:20.010> pair<00:03:20.310> it<00:03:20.340> once<00:03:21.150> again

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
should be able to pair it once again

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.390 
should be able to pair it once again
check<00:03:21.989> your<00:03:22.260> batteries<00:03:22.650> if<00:03:22.769> it's<00:03:22.890> not<00:03:23.070> pairing

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
check your batteries if it's not pairing

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.979 
check your batteries if it's not pairing
right<00:03:23.579> away<00:03:23.820> because<00:03:24.030> you<00:03:24.150> really<00:03:24.570> don't<00:03:24.750> have

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
right away because you really don't have

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:28.610 
right away because you really don't have
to<00:03:25.489> click<00:03:26.489> on<00:03:26.640> this<00:03:26.760> option<00:03:26.970> usually<00:03:27.470> ok<00:03:28.470> it's

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
to click on this option usually ok it's

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.559 
to click on this option usually ok it's
really<00:03:28.890> odd<00:03:29.070> that<00:03:29.310> you<00:03:29.430> have<00:03:29.640> to<00:03:29.820> do<00:03:29.910> it

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:30.569 
really odd that you have to do it

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:32.870 
really odd that you have to do it
once<00:03:30.989> again<00:03:31.319> that<00:03:31.500> all<00:03:31.680> remote<00:03:32.100> control<00:03:32.519> for

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
once again that all remote control for

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.520 
once again that all remote control for
your<00:03:33.239> iMac<00:03:33.540> also<00:03:33.900> works<00:03:34.079> on<00:03:34.230> your<00:03:34.290> Apple<00:03:34.500> TV

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
your iMac also works on your Apple TV

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.220 
your iMac also works on your Apple TV
