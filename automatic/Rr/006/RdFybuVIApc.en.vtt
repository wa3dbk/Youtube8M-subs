00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:05.550
 now 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:11.620
 olatz so the stage here we are 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:14.590
 commenting and more for us of the 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:17.619
 curiosities of just cause 2 and I have you 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:19.510
 a pretty interesting that is going 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:22.420
 to say where we are it is worth as you see 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:25.610
 we are here in this islet is worth close 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:27.560
 here at the main airport this 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:29.960
 what is this mainly because this is 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.320
 a racing circuit is worth no 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.770
 no way to get there by car 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:38.770
 the bridge is what happens it passes by not 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:41.080
 you can get down here except for air 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.820
 or water with a bottle you go to the beach and 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:45.879
 then to the highway it is but good 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.620
 here in this area you have this car 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:49.870
 some cars that used before it is worth 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.670
 it was a little broken the wheels has 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.320
 disengaged and comes out a lot again 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.600
 that will use it now but good that in 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.610
 this piece of car that as I do not know 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.650
 you can exit by any road or the 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.150
 pains that you can not get out but with the 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.570
 importance of approving you have the 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:06.890
 circuit this one 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:08.530
 so there are no other cars too 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.150
 we have cars are destroyed because 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:14.960
 when you play a little bit a car I like you 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:16.790
 that I have a strength and exterior and you 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.220
 you send against the guardrails or against 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.979
 anything that is in the way 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.330
 it is a danger and the cars that 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:24.380
 have the others are not as fast as 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.030
 this one was a little faster but 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.500
 clear as you touch with some interest 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.500
 to the shit 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:38.420
 and here we go 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.200
 and I know it's also broken because I 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:47.150
 I charge but a question 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:50.230
 we go there I release the car a lot 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.230
 I leave it without windows 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:57.100
 the truth is not controlled very well 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:02:00.250
 It's a pretty good car, and I do not know 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.750
 controls as hard as others 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.440
 I do not think that I think it is I want 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.440
 sell the judge car 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.429
 and good enough 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:11.359
 255 points 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.909
 256 most of the points of 

00:02:11.359 --> 00:02:17.430
 bad driving was pulled out here because it happened 

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:20.400
 here 2 057 this goes faster 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.079
 the points what is 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.390
 when you reach the maximum speed you 

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:27.890
 they are giving points and the longer 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:30.640
 there are more points you will receive, of course 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:33.290
 it is fixed is when it slowed down with the speed 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.209
 and it happens with any car saying is not 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.830
 a limit is not an estimated speed 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:39.340
 but the maximum speed of the car that 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:43.180
 drive lifting head 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.859
 a few points of return 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.490
 and do not hire me with any car 

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:51.820
 your kids I say that kids 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:56.070
 good is that we find them 320 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:56.070
 kilometers driven alone 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.849
 and I think that when languages ​​but in the 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.849
 love 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.000
 well let's go there we find some 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:11.470
 Because is what 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.470
 good formative you have car 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:18.050
 what's up with the shit 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:21.050
 as you would with pinpoints of seriousness 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:21.050
 165 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.159
 and so without finding the damn cars 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.159
 Well, I want to teach 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.450
 I'm going to take care of hitting us financing 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.650
 if they could in the opposite direction that 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:38.459
 meeting 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.459
 definitely 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:44.650
 I've seen that control how it controls 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:44.650
 who draws deers 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:49.450
 If I do not buy, donate tourism because 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.610
 this but the object there left him for the 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:54.330
 floors up people 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.330
 that 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:00.830
 there are some also of the termites of 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:04.300
 the controls that are pretty cool 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:07.860
 but they control themselves a little worse 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.860
 arise is how most searched more 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:14.070
 once 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:21.079
 that is, there is no car 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:33.570
 a science of the circuit 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.570
 and my god my god 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:40.630
 well here it rains as soon as they come out 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:42.850
 the elephants if it 's raining during 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:45.150
 how many days together and the sun is over 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:45.150
 again 

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:50.710
 then you have to take it because 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:54.560
 they say the temperature changes 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:57.080
 they affect your 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.729
 what would happen if 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.909
 buy at very good levels for the 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:00.909
 Health 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.940
 it seems that he is saying this so that 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:05.940
 pay me 

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:17.400
 while here looking for the stroller 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:26.030
 Well, you are left without seeing the cars 

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:26.030
 what we found 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.590
 receive 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.240
 they are jobs the drivers of 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:33.360
 those good me well a little bit since 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.360
 Rains 

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:36.510
 well nothing 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:43.910
 I do not know if I like the academic track 

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:46.870
 world slows down my mother 

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:46.870
 as a niece 

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:56.069
 moved weirder to get out of the car 

00:05:54.449 --> 00:05:58.460
 He has missed a little, he does not think it's strange 

00:05:56.069 --> 00:05:58.460
 other magician 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.440
 and hey it's an alarm 

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:11.830
 my mother uncle 

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:16.140
 good 

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:16.140
 to the track and how are the cars 

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:21.210
 well 

00:06:19.289 --> 00:06:23.399
 well we left it and here today he taught 

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:25.110
 or if nothing else shows this curiosity 

00:06:23.399 --> 00:06:29.300
 I hope you liked that you can 

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:29.300
 like favorites and see you later 

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:33.560
