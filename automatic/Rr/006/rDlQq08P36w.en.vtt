there's two ways you can do it you can
there's<00:00:26.949> a<00:00:27.009> switch<00:00:27.279> obviously<00:00:28.080> right<00:00:29.080> now

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:29.109 
there's a switch obviously right now

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:30.929 
there's a switch obviously right now
it's<00:00:29.320> on<00:00:29.410> the<00:00:29.439> break<00:00:29.740> and<00:00:30.070> this<00:00:30.429> is<00:00:30.580> the<00:00:30.669> normal

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:30.939 
it's on the break and this is the normal

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:45.200 
it's on the break and this is the normal
setting<00:00:31.240> with<00:00:31.810> that<00:00:31.929> volume<00:00:32.050> at<00:00:32.290> 12<00:00:32.500> o'clock

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.790 

this<00:00:46.210> is<00:00:46.300> the<00:00:46.360> clean<00:00:46.570> sound<00:00:46.750> the<00:00:47.260> thing<00:00:47.649> is

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:47.800 
this is the clean sound the thing is

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.349 
this is the clean sound the thing is
that<00:00:47.980> the<00:00:48.190> magic<00:00:48.370> about<00:00:48.699> these<00:00:48.910> amps<00:00:49.239> these

00:00:49.349 --> 00:00:49.359 
that the magic about these amps these

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:50.970 
that the magic about these amps these
old<00:00:49.629> amps<00:00:49.960> that's<00:00:50.170> when<00:00:50.440> you<00:00:50.500> hit<00:00:50.620> him<00:00:50.739> hard

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:50.980 
old amps that's when you hit him hard

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:52.590 
old amps that's when you hit him hard
they<00:00:51.309> kind<00:00:51.520> of<00:00:51.609> crack<00:00:51.850> up<00:00:52.030> a<00:00:52.120> little<00:00:52.270> bit<00:00:52.420> and

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:52.600 
they kind of crack up a little bit and

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.430 
they kind of crack up a little bit and
then<00:00:53.050> when<00:00:53.140> you<00:00:53.199> hit<00:00:53.289> himself<00:00:55.170> they<00:00:56.170> kind<00:00:56.379> of

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.440 
then when you hit himself they kind of

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.650 
then when you hit himself they kind of
don't<00:00:56.590> and<00:00:57.460> when<00:00:57.760> you<00:00:57.850> get<00:00:58.030> is<00:00:58.210> this<00:00:58.329> really

00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:58.660 
don't and when you get is this really

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.319 
don't and when you get is this really
cool

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:01.329 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:03.430 

like<00:01:02.329> it<00:01:02.450> just<00:01:02.600> lasts<00:01:02.810> for<00:01:03.050> a<00:01:03.079> really<00:01:03.320> long

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:03.440 
like it just lasts for a really long

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.180 
like it just lasts for a really long
time<00:01:03.650> and<00:01:04.239> sounds<00:01:05.239> glassy<00:01:05.750> and<00:01:06.110> I<00:01:06.620> think<00:01:06.830> I

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:07.190 
time and sounds glassy and I think I

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:08.710 
time and sounds glassy and I think I
think<00:01:07.250> a<00:01:07.520> lot<00:01:07.670> of<00:01:07.729> more<00:01:07.910> people<00:01:08.210> a<00:01:08.240> lot<00:01:08.420> of<00:01:08.540> like

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
think a lot of more people a lot of like

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:09.910 
think a lot of more people a lot of like
young<00:01:08.840> guitar<00:01:09.020> players<00:01:09.410> need<00:01:09.590> to<00:01:09.650> know<00:01:09.740> stuff

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
young guitar players need to know stuff

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.170 
young guitar players need to know stuff
like<00:01:10.010> that<00:01:10.130> when<00:01:10.400> you<00:01:10.460> pick<00:01:10.610> really<00:01:10.880> light<00:01:11.060> you

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
like that when you pick really light you

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:12.880 
like that when you pick really light you
can<00:01:11.300> get<00:01:11.390> the<00:01:11.570> cleaner<00:01:11.780> tones<00:01:12.050> and<00:01:12.470> you<00:01:12.770> don't

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
can get the cleaner tones and you don't

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.490 
can get the cleaner tones and you don't
have<00:01:12.950> to<00:01:13.070> have<00:01:13.370> your<00:01:13.490> amp<00:01:13.670> really<00:01:13.880> clean<00:01:14.500> but

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
have to have your amp really clean but

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.410 
have to have your amp really clean but

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
there's also another setting on this amp

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.000 
there's also another setting on this amp
which<00:01:17.720> is<00:01:18.190> mellow<00:01:19.190> I<00:01:19.490> wasn't<00:01:20.330> my<00:01:20.420> idea<00:01:20.900> not<00:01:21.830> at

through the amp here I've had the tone
control<00:01:54.200> on<00:01:54.350> 10<00:01:54.619> if<00:01:55.250> you<00:01:55.310> want<00:01:55.490> it<00:01:55.910> a<00:01:56.030> little

one<00:01:56.720> a<00:01:56.750> little<00:01:56.960> less<00:01:57.289> bright<00:01:57.649> you<00:01:57.800> can<00:01:57.830> always

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
one a little less bright you can always

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:59.800 
one a little less bright you can always
turn<00:01:58.280> that<00:01:58.460> down<00:01:58.640> and<00:01:58.940> you<00:01:59.330> have<00:01:59.479> your<00:01:59.660> mellow

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
normal and bright switch and so this is

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.699 
normal and bright switch and so this is
right<00:02:04.460> back<00:02:04.640> on<00:02:04.820> bright<00:02:05.119> back<00:02:05.660> on<00:02:05.899> for<00:02:06.170> this

00:02:06.699 --> 00:02:06.709 
right back on bright back on for this

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:09.370 
right back on bright back on for this
amp<00:02:07.099> also<00:02:07.490> has<00:02:07.670> two<00:02:07.880> channels<00:02:08.179> now<00:02:09.110> they

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
amp also has two channels now they

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:10.570 
amp also has two channels now they
didn't<00:02:09.560> think<00:02:09.709> about<00:02:09.890> that<00:02:10.069> in<00:02:10.190> the<00:02:10.250> old<00:02:10.429> days

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
didn't think about that in the old days

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.089 
didn't think about that in the old days
but<00:02:11.420> you<00:02:11.510> can<00:02:11.660> actually<00:02:11.780> get<00:02:12.080> an<00:02:12.230> AV<00:02:12.500> box<00:02:12.770> and

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:13.099 
but you can actually get an AV box and

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:15.190 
but you can actually get an AV box and
use<00:02:13.580> both<00:02:13.790> channels<00:02:14.180> you<00:02:14.270> plug<00:02:14.480> you<00:02:14.870> plug<00:02:14.900> both

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
use both channels you plug you plug both

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.350 
use both channels you plug you plug both
channels<00:02:15.740> into<00:02:15.860> the<00:02:15.980> same<00:02:16.190> the<00:02:16.520> a/b<00:02:16.819> box<00:02:17.060> and

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
channels into the same the a/b box and

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.059 
channels into the same the a/b box and
then<00:02:17.900> you<00:02:17.990> can<00:02:18.140> have<00:02:18.230> one<00:02:18.260> set<00:02:18.590> on<00:02:18.709> clean<00:02:18.950> and

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.069 
then you can have one set on clean and

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:20.770 
then you can have one set on clean and
once<00:02:19.190> that<00:02:19.310> on<00:02:19.430> dirty<00:02:19.640> and<00:02:19.940> you<00:02:20.360> can<00:02:20.480> kind<00:02:20.750> of

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
once that on dirty and you can kind of

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.080 
once that on dirty and you can kind of
use<00:02:20.930> that<00:02:21.140> and<00:02:21.349> take<00:02:21.890> it<00:02:21.920> on<00:02:22.069> stage<00:02:22.370> and<00:02:22.880> put<00:02:23.060> a

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
use that and take it on stage and put a

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.449 
use that and take it on stage and put a
mic<00:02:23.300> on<00:02:23.480> it<00:02:23.660> and<00:02:23.840> it's<00:02:24.500> only<00:02:24.650> 18<00:02:25.010> watts<00:02:25.250> so<00:02:25.370> you

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
mic on it and it's only 18 watts so you

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:26.410 
mic on it and it's only 18 watts so you
probably<00:02:25.610> have<00:02:25.819> to<00:02:25.910> get<00:02:26.000> a<00:02:26.060> lot<00:02:26.240> in<00:02:26.360> your

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
probably have to get a lot in your

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.120 
probably have to get a lot in your
monitor<00:02:26.599> but<00:02:27.020> it'll<00:02:27.500> sound<00:02:27.620> amazing<00:02:28.040> the

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130
