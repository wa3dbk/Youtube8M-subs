card<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.489> thing<00:00:50.670> is<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:51.000> only<00:00:51.090> thing<00:00:51.180> that

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
card the thing is the only thing that

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.389 
card the thing is the only thing that
went<00:00:51.480> up<00:00:51.660> for<00:00:51.930> him<00:00:52.050> was<00:00:52.440> his<00:00:52.590> shooting<00:00:53.070> by<00:00:53.340> two

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
went up for him was his shooting by two

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.450 
went up for him was his shooting by two
stats<00:00:53.969> and<00:00:54.270> he's<00:00:54.960> paced<00:00:55.260> by<00:00:55.530> twos<00:00:55.710> dad<00:00:55.980> but

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
stats and he's paced by twos dad but

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.970 
stats and he's paced by twos dad but
he's<00:00:56.730> defending<00:00:57.300> went<00:00:57.480> down<00:00:57.809> by<00:00:58.079> two<00:00:58.140> surely

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
he's defending went down by two surely

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.709 
he's defending went down by two surely
it's<00:00:59.070> more<00:00:59.250> crucial<00:00:59.640> for<00:00:59.789> a<00:00:59.850> defender<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.420> have

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
it's more crucial for a defender to have

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.049 
it's more crucial for a defender to have
better<00:01:01.050> defensive<00:01:01.620> stats<00:01:01.890> hence<00:01:02.609> why<00:01:02.850> his

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
better defensive stats hence why his

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.240 
better defensive stats hence why his
rating<00:01:03.390> probably<00:01:03.840> should<00:01:04.080> have<00:01:04.350> been<00:01:04.589> lower

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
rating probably should have been lower

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.490 
rating probably should have been lower
after<00:01:05.640> actually<00:01:06.510> losing<00:01:06.869> two<00:01:07.020> defensive

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
after actually losing two defensive

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.810 
after actually losing two defensive
stats<00:01:07.650> when<00:01:07.799> he<00:01:07.860> moved<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.070> Newcastle<00:01:08.250> it's

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
stats when he moved to Newcastle it's

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.340 
stats when he moved to Newcastle it's
all<00:01:09.000> very<00:01:09.299> very<00:01:09.479> strange<00:01:09.810> some<00:01:10.020> of<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.170> things

that is my mistake I accidentally put
him<00:01:33.030> on<00:01:33.090> a<00:01:33.119> center<00:01:33.479> attacking<00:01:33.900> mid<00:01:34.020> position

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
in the squad builder and therefore he is

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.789 
in the squad builder and therefore he is
standing<00:01:36.840> out<00:01:36.960> as<00:01:37.049> a<00:01:37.079> center<00:01:37.350> attacking<00:01:37.680> mid

does that work

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.210 
does that work
it's<00:02:45.630> just<00:02:45.810> it's<00:02:46.200> just<00:02:46.380> bizarre<00:02:46.560> it<00:02:46.950> really

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
it's just it's just bizarre it really

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.190 
it's just it's just bizarre it really
really<00:02:47.489> is<00:02:47.670> but<00:02:48.360> anyway<00:02:48.660> you<00:02:48.720> can<00:02:48.900> see<00:02:49.019> that

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
really is but anyway you can see that

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.199 
really is but anyway you can see that
you<00:02:49.260> had<00:02:49.380> 84<00:02:49.860> page<00:02:50.069> 82<00:02:50.459> shooting<00:02:50.849> games<00:02:51.000> for

dribbling<00:02:51.540> and<00:02:51.660> 78<00:02:52.200> heading<00:02:52.440> those<00:02:52.560> are

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
dribbling and 78 heading those are

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.250 
dribbling and 78 heading those are
really<00:02:52.920> really<00:02:53.220> good<00:02:53.340> stuff<00:02:53.610> and<00:02:54.480> while<00:02:55.140> he

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
really really good stuff and while he

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.800 
really really good stuff and while he
was<00:02:55.380> at<00:02:55.440> Malmo<00:02:55.920> FC<00:02:56.220> I<00:02:56.250> believe<00:02:56.610> it<00:02:56.730> was<00:02:56.880> and<00:02:57.150> you

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
was at Malmo FC I believe it was and you

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.180 
was at Malmo FC I believe it was and you
can<00:02:57.930> see<00:02:57.959> that<00:02:58.290> his<00:02:58.410> stats<00:02:58.739> were<00:02:58.890> slightly

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
can see that his stats were slightly

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.410 
can see that his stats were slightly
though<00:02:59.340> that<00:02:59.549> was<00:02:59.670> just<00:02:59.880> at<00:03:00.000> the<00:03:00.090> end<00:03:00.209> of<00:03:00.329> his

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
though that was just at the end of his

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.479 
though that was just at the end of his
career<00:03:00.599> so<00:03:01.260> and<00:03:01.560> it's<00:03:01.680> understandable<00:03:02.280> but

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
career so and it's understandable but

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:04.670 
career so and it's understandable but
his<00:03:02.640> stats<00:03:02.940> would<00:03:03.180> be<00:03:03.360> slightly<00:03:03.599> lower<00:03:03.930> anyway

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
his stats would be slightly lower anyway

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.050 
his stats would be slightly lower anyway

pretty cool stats and it's quite

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:31.250 
pretty cool stats and it's quite
interesting<00:03:29.639> to<00:03:30.090> see<00:03:30.329> how<00:03:30.510> these<00:03:30.690> players<00:03:30.930> are

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.110 
interesting to see how these players are
you<00:03:31.620> know<00:03:31.739> changing<00:03:32.250> between<00:03:32.430> their<00:03:32.700> legend

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
you know changing between their legend

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.270 
you know changing between their legend
or<00:03:33.600> their<00:03:33.870> best<00:03:34.109> period<00:03:34.410> I<00:03:34.680> guess<00:03:34.859> what<00:03:35.160> you

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
or their best period I guess what you

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.099 
or their best period I guess what you
would<00:03:35.400> say<00:03:35.760> the<00:03:35.910> legend<00:03:36.209> cards<00:03:36.480> are<00:03:36.720> all

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:37.109 
would say the legend cards are all

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:38.479 
would say the legend cards are all
they're<00:03:37.440> great<00:03:37.709> compared<00:03:38.130> to<00:03:38.220> how<00:03:38.340> they

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
they're great compared to how they

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:41.270 
they're great compared to how they
finish<00:03:39.209> their<00:03:39.420> career<00:03:39.750> on<00:03:39.989> FIFA<00:03:40.590> now<00:03:41.040> we<00:03:41.100> can

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
finish their career on FIFA now we can

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.190 
finish their career on FIFA now we can
move<00:03:41.400> on<00:03:41.579> to<00:03:41.609> our<00:03:41.970> next<00:03:42.269> player<00:03:42.630> and<00:03:42.870> is<00:03:42.989> going

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
move on to our next player and is going

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.569
