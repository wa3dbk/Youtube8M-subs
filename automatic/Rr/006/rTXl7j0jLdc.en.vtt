00:03:23.219 --> 00:03:23.229 
everything let's look at the numbers

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:26.460 
everything let's look at the numbers
we've<00:03:23.440> got<00:03:23.620> six<00:03:24.239> one<00:03:25.239> four<00:03:25.540> chord<00:03:25.930> card<00:03:26.199> at

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
we've got six one four chord card at

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.199 
we've got six one four chord card at
seven<00:03:26.889> and<00:03:27.099> then<00:03:27.250> the<00:03:27.400> wheel<00:03:27.579> of<00:03:27.609> fortune

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
seven and then the wheel of fortune

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:32.490 
seven and then the wheel of fortune
that's<00:03:28.449> ten<00:03:28.780> so<00:03:29.260> that's<00:03:29.440> 17<00:03:30.180> 17<00:03:31.180> 1<00:03:31.599> and<00:03:31.870> 7<00:03:32.169> is<00:03:32.290> 8

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
that's ten so that's 17 17 1 and 7 is 8

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.580 
that's ten so that's 17 17 1 and 7 is 8
and<00:03:32.709> in<00:03:33.280> numerology<00:03:33.639> 8<00:03:34.209> means<00:03:34.569> power<00:03:35.199> and

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
and in numerology 8 means power and

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.890 
and in numerology 8 means power and
being<00:03:35.949> the<00:03:36.250> boss<00:03:36.459> and<00:03:36.699> being<00:03:36.970> in<00:03:37.120> challenge<00:03:37.540> so

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
being the boss and being in challenge so

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.479 
being the boss and being in challenge so
you<00:03:37.959> really<00:03:38.379> can<00:03:38.560> turn<00:03:38.799> this<00:03:38.949> day<00:03:39.190> into
