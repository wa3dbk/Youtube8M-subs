well<00:00:00.750> bad<00:00:01.199> news<00:00:02.659> went<00:00:03.659> to<00:00:03.750> the<00:00:03.870> drift<00:00:04.140> event

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
well bad news went to the drift event

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.099 
well bad news went to the drift event
today<00:00:04.560> didn't<00:00:05.100> I<00:00:05.720> guess<00:00:06.720> I'll<00:00:06.870> give<00:00:06.990> you<00:00:07.049> a

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
today didn't I guess I'll give you a

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.370 
today didn't I guess I'll give you a
little<00:00:07.230> bit<00:00:07.470> of<00:00:07.589> an<00:00:07.680> update<00:00:07.980> on<00:00:08.010> the<00:00:08.189> car<00:00:09.380> the

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
little bit of an update on the car the

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.620 
little bit of an update on the car the
last<00:00:10.559> drift<00:00:11.340> even<00:00:11.580> I<00:00:11.639> didn't<00:00:12.030> put<00:00:12.240> a<00:00:12.269> video<00:00:12.450> up

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
last drift even I didn't put a video up

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.049 
last drift even I didn't put a video up
yet<00:00:13.309> it'll<00:00:14.309> probably<00:00:14.490> be<00:00:14.670> on<00:00:14.759> there<00:00:14.910> but

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
yet it'll probably be on there but

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:21.470 
yet it'll probably be on there but
anyhow<00:00:15.320> last<00:00:16.320> drift<00:00:16.619> event<00:00:17.900> the<00:00:19.880> intake<00:00:20.880> pipe

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
anyhow last drift event the intake pipe

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.170 
anyhow last drift event the intake pipe
or<00:00:21.689> whatever<00:00:21.750> off<00:00:22.080> the<00:00:22.260> turbo<00:00:22.619> it<00:00:23.010> came<00:00:23.970> off

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
or whatever off the turbo it came off

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.700 
or whatever off the turbo it came off
and<00:00:24.359> it<00:00:24.449> dusted<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.080> motor<00:00:25.320> and<00:00:25.500> there<00:00:25.590> was

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
and it dusted the motor and there was

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.470 
and it dusted the motor and there was
like<00:00:25.859> dust<00:00:26.160> and<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.490> intercooler<00:00:26.910> piping<00:00:27.330> and

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
like dust and the intercooler piping and

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.839 
like dust and the intercooler piping and
stuff<00:00:27.630> like<00:00:27.779> that<00:00:28.429> anyhow<00:00:29.429> it<00:00:29.550> started

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
stuff like that anyhow it started

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.429 
stuff like that anyhow it started
smoking<00:00:30.119> a<00:00:30.359> whole<00:00:30.480> bunch<00:00:30.840> and<00:00:31.080> stuff<00:00:31.289> like

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
smoking a whole bunch and stuff like

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.350 
smoking a whole bunch and stuff like
that<00:00:31.650> so<00:00:32.480> anyhow<00:00:33.480> so<00:00:33.719> I<00:00:35.149> didn't<00:00:36.149> really<00:00:36.300> think

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
that so anyhow so I didn't really think

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.670 
that so anyhow so I didn't really think
too<00:00:36.660> much<00:00:36.809> of<00:00:37.020> it<00:00:37.170> I<00:00:37.230> just<00:00:37.260> thought<00:00:37.500> it<00:00:37.620> was

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
too much of it I just thought it was

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.380 
too much of it I just thought it was
blow-by<00:00:38.070> and<00:00:38.280> I<00:00:38.370> knew<00:00:38.520> it<00:00:38.640> was<00:00:38.760> you<00:00:39.059> know<00:00:39.149> gonna

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
blow-by and I knew it was you know gonna

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.450 
blow-by and I knew it was you know gonna
take<00:00:39.629> it's<00:00:40.500> gonna<00:00:40.620> take<00:00:40.829> a<00:00:40.860> toll<00:00:41.070> out<00:00:41.219> of<00:00:41.309> it<00:00:41.399> I

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
take it's gonna take a toll out of it I

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.510 
take it's gonna take a toll out of it I
didn't<00:00:41.670> it<00:00:41.760> was<00:00:41.850> gonna<00:00:41.969> go<00:00:42.090> this<00:00:42.120> fast

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:43.520 
didn't it was gonna go this fast

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.420 
didn't it was gonna go this fast
anyhow<00:00:44.520> last<00:00:44.789> night<00:00:44.969> I<00:00:45.000> went<00:00:45.120> ahead<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:45.390> I

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:46.430 
anyhow last night I went ahead and I

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.430 
anyhow last night I went ahead and I
there's<00:00:47.430> a<00:00:47.520> GT<00:00:48.410> 2871<00:00:49.410> R<00:00:49.739> that<00:00:50.280> I<00:00:50.309> put<00:00:50.579> on<00:00:50.700> here

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
there's a GT 2871 R that I put on here

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.689 
there's a GT 2871 R that I put on here
you<00:00:52.440> know<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.190> do<00:00:53.309> a<00:00:53.340> little<00:00:53.489> bit

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
you know and to do a little bit

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.310 
you know and to do a little bit
different<00:00:54.570> routing<00:00:54.719> with<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.050> intercooler

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
different routing with the intercooler

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.670 
different routing with the intercooler
piping<00:00:56.960> stuff<00:00:57.960> like<00:00:58.140> that<00:00:58.320> but<00:00:58.500> it<00:00:58.590> was

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
piping stuff like that but it was

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.410 
piping stuff like that but it was
running<00:00:58.890> great<00:00:59.190> I<00:00:59.219> had<00:00:59.460> it<00:00:59.550> on<00:00:59.609> twelve<00:00:59.940> pounds

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
running great I had it on twelve pounds

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.979 
running great I had it on twelve pounds
today<00:01:01.289> I<00:01:01.410> made<00:01:01.620> like<00:01:01.829> two<00:01:02.100> runs<00:01:02.539> on<00:01:03.539> twelve

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
today I made like two runs on twelve

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.840 
today I made like two runs on twelve
pounds<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:04.589> it<00:01:04.680> pretty<00:01:04.890> much<00:01:05.070> after<00:01:05.309> that<00:01:05.489> it

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
pounds and it pretty much after that it

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.030 
pounds and it pretty much after that it
kind<00:01:06.630> of<00:01:06.659> started<00:01:06.930> losing<00:01:07.380> boost<00:01:07.619> and<00:01:07.920> stuff

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
kind of started losing boost and stuff

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.750 
kind of started losing boost and stuff
like<00:01:08.130> that<00:01:08.340> wouldn't<00:01:08.670> build<00:01:08.850> boost<00:01:10.460> so<00:01:11.460> anyhow

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
like that wouldn't build boost so anyhow

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.570 
like that wouldn't build boost so anyhow
right<00:01:11.790> now<00:01:12.830> you<00:01:13.830> know<00:01:13.920> basically<00:01:14.369> at<00:01:14.520> the

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
right now you know basically at the

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.969 
right now you know basically at the
drift<00:01:14.760> event<00:01:15.000> it<00:01:15.090> just<00:01:15.240> almost<00:01:15.659> died<00:01:15.979> didn't

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
drift event it just almost died didn't

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.530 
drift event it just almost died didn't
didn't<00:01:17.520> want<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:17.759> do<00:01:17.850> anything<00:01:18.060> didn't<00:01:18.420> want

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
didn't want to do anything didn't want

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.149 
didn't want to do anything didn't want
to<00:01:18.630> start<00:01:18.900> didn't<00:01:19.140> want<00:01:19.290> to<00:01:19.380> run<00:01:19.590> didn't<00:01:19.979> build

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
to start didn't want to run didn't build

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.920 
to start didn't want to run didn't build
absolutely<00:01:20.909> any<00:01:21.030> boost<00:01:21.330> on<00:01:21.600> my<00:01:21.720> last

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
absolutely any boost on my last

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.710 
absolutely any boost on my last
qualifying<00:01:22.710> run<00:01:22.950> so<00:01:23.220> that<00:01:23.430> sucked<00:01:24.360> but<00:01:24.570> right

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
qualifying run so that sucked but right

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.120 
qualifying run so that sucked but right
now<00:01:24.840> I'm<00:01:24.930> doing<00:01:25.049> a<00:01:25.140> compression<00:01:25.470> test<00:01:25.650> as<00:01:26.040> you

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
now I'm doing a compression test as you

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:38.090 
now I'm doing a compression test as you
can<00:01:26.280> see<00:01:26.460> cylinder<00:01:27.360> number<00:01:27.540> one

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:46.020 

and<00:01:39.100> that's<00:01:39.280> it<00:01:39.520> not<00:01:39.730> even<00:01:40.000> 60<00:01:40.420> psi<00:01:44.970> you<00:01:45.970> know

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
and that's it not even 60 psi you know

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:53.330 
and that's it not even 60 psi you know
even<00:01:46.510> 60<00:01:46.870> psi<00:01:47.290> in<00:01:47.440> number<00:01:47.680> one<00:01:49.320> try<00:01:50.320> number<00:01:50.620> two

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.110 

but<00:01:54.450> yeah<00:01:55.450> pretty<00:01:55.720> much<00:01:55.840> this<00:01:56.760> kind<00:01:57.760> of<00:01:57.880> sucks

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:58.120 
but yeah pretty much this kind of sucks

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:02.370 
but yeah pretty much this kind of sucks
I<00:01:58.270> just<00:01:58.450> rebuilt<00:01:58.750> the<00:01:58.870> motor<00:02:01.380> it's

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
I just rebuilt the motor it's

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.640 
I just rebuilt the motor it's
unfortunate<00:02:03.010> that<00:02:03.040> the<00:02:03.600> turbo<00:02:04.600> inlet<00:02:05.470> or

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 
unfortunate that the turbo inlet or

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:07.770 
unfortunate that the turbo inlet or
whatever<00:02:05.890> it<00:02:06.130> popped<00:02:06.400> off<00:02:06.610> and<00:02:06.970> I<00:02:07.180> went<00:02:07.630> in<00:02:07.720> the

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
whatever it popped off and I went in the

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.240 
whatever it popped off and I went in the
dirt<00:02:07.960> a<00:02:08.110> few<00:02:08.290> times<00:02:08.500> if<00:02:08.710> you<00:02:08.800> looked<00:02:09.010> in<00:02:09.130> the

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
dirt a few times if you looked in the

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.580 
dirt a few times if you looked in the
last<00:02:09.490> video<00:02:09.880> or<00:02:10.119> whatever<00:02:10.360> or<00:02:11.260> one<00:02:11.410> of<00:02:11.530> the

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
last video or whatever or one of the

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.010 
last video or whatever or one of the
last<00:02:11.770> videos<00:02:12.060> where<00:02:13.060> it's<00:02:13.210> actually<00:02:13.360> drifting

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
last videos where it's actually drifting

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.880 
last videos where it's actually drifting
that<00:02:15.600> went<00:02:16.600> went<00:02:17.080> in<00:02:17.140> the<00:02:17.230> dirt<00:02:17.410> a<00:02:17.470> few<00:02:17.650> times

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
that went went in the dirt a few times

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:29.360 
that went went in the dirt a few times
and<00:02:18.220> I<00:02:18.400> guess<00:02:18.700> it<00:02:18.850> popped<00:02:19.090> it<00:02:19.240> off<00:02:19.390> so<00:02:21.030> number

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:35.699 

260<00:02:31.350> yeah<00:02:32.350> this<00:02:32.620> breaks<00:02:33.220> my<00:02:33.430> heart<00:02:33.459> I<00:02:34.709> don't

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
260 yeah this breaks my heart I don't

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:37.949 
260 yeah this breaks my heart I don't
know<00:02:35.860> it's<00:02:36.190> just<00:02:36.400> dumb<00:02:36.640> I<00:02:36.910> put<00:02:37.390> so<00:02:37.540> much<00:02:37.660> time

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
know it's just dumb I put so much time

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:40.260 
know it's just dumb I put so much time
and<00:02:38.020> money<00:02:38.470> into<00:02:39.340> this<00:02:39.580> thing<00:02:39.670> getting<00:02:40.180> it

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
and money into this thing getting it

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:41.880 
and money into this thing getting it
going<00:02:40.660> so<00:02:40.840> I'd<00:02:40.900> have<00:02:41.050> a<00:02:41.080> drift<00:02:41.410> car<00:02:41.500> so<00:02:41.770> I<00:02:41.830> could

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
going so I'd have a drift car so I could

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.080 
going so I'd have a drift car so I could
drift<00:02:42.190> all<00:02:42.400> season<00:02:42.850> and<00:02:44.459> now<00:02:45.459> I<00:02:45.489> got<00:02:45.790> to<00:02:45.820> put

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
drift all season and now I got to put

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:47.970 
drift all season and now I got to put
you<00:02:46.690> know<00:02:46.720> a<00:02:46.840> little<00:02:47.080> bit<00:02:47.290> more<00:02:47.500> a<00:02:47.739> little<00:02:47.830> bit

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
you know a little bit more a little bit

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.460 
you know a little bit more a little bit
more<00:02:48.100> money<00:02:48.430> and<00:02:48.580> a<00:02:48.640> lot<00:02:48.760> more<00:02:48.820> time<00:02:49.209> in<00:02:49.510> this

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
more money and a lot more time in this

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.380 
more money and a lot more time in this
damn<00:02:50.680> thing<00:02:51.010> in<00:02:51.190> order<00:02:51.280> to<00:02:51.430> there's<00:02:52.090> another

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
damn thing in order to there's another

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.810 
damn thing in order to there's another
event<00:02:52.600> today's<00:02:52.989> the<00:02:53.170> 20th<00:02:53.500> another<00:02:54.370> event<00:02:54.700> on

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820 
event today's the 20th another event on

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:58.430 
event today's the 20th another event on
the<00:02:54.970> second<00:02:55.540> that<00:02:56.200> I'd<00:02:56.290> like<00:02:56.500> to<00:02:56.650> make<00:02:56.830> it<00:02:56.980> to

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
the second that I'd like to make it to

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:10.750 
the second that I'd like to make it to
see<00:02:59.440> this<00:02:59.560> cylinder<00:03:00.100> number<00:03:00.220> three

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.830 

that's<00:03:11.760> 160<00:03:14.030> so<00:03:15.030> that's<00:03:15.210> that's<00:03:15.570> a<00:03:15.750> good

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
that's 160 so that's that's a good

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:22.100 
that's 160 so that's that's a good
compression<00:03:16.200> on<00:03:16.470> that<00:03:20.780> this<00:03:21.780> will<00:03:21.990> be

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
compression on that this will be

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:30.050 
compression on that this will be
cylinder<00:03:22.590> number<00:03:22.740> four<00:03:28.010> yeah<00:03:29.010> basically<00:03:29.820> I

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
cylinder number four yeah basically I

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.760 
cylinder number four yeah basically I
don't<00:03:30.270> know<00:03:30.360> I<00:03:30.390> might<00:03:30.660> try<00:03:31.260> and<00:03:31.350> pull<00:03:31.590> it<00:03:31.710> out

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:31.770 
don't know I might try and pull it out

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:35.060 
don't know I might try and pull it out
here<00:03:32.070> in<00:03:32.160> the<00:03:32.220> next<00:03:32.400> day<00:03:32.670> or<00:03:32.820> so<00:03:32.850> and<00:03:34.070> hopefully

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
here in the next day or so and hopefully

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:38.600 
here in the next day or so and hopefully
all<00:03:35.190> it<00:03:35.310> needs<00:03:35.490> is<00:03:35.610> rings<00:03:37.040> you<00:03:38.040> know<00:03:38.190> hone<00:03:38.400> it

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
all it needs is rings you know hone it

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.520 
all it needs is rings you know hone it
and<00:03:38.820> stuff<00:03:39.060> like<00:03:39.180> that<00:03:39.390> but<00:03:39.630> new<00:03:39.780> piston<00:03:40.320> rings

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
and stuff like that but new piston rings

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:50.050 
and stuff like that but new piston rings
in<00:03:40.770> it<00:03:47.000> yeah<00:03:48.000> so<00:03:48.450> that's<00:03:48.900> pretty<00:03:48.990> much<00:03:49.170> it<00:03:49.470> a

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
in it yeah so that's pretty much it a

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:51.890 
in it yeah so that's pretty much it a
little<00:03:51.060> bit<00:03:51.150> of<00:03:51.210> an<00:03:51.300> update<00:03:51.420> I'm<00:03:51.660> gonna<00:03:51.810> go

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
little bit of an update I'm gonna go

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
little bit of an update I'm gonna go
ahead<00:03:51.960> and<00:03:52.080> pour<00:03:52.230> a<00:03:52.290> little<00:03:52.410> bit<00:03:52.530> of<00:03:52.650> oil<00:03:52.710> in

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
ahead and pour a little bit of oil in

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.520 
ahead and pour a little bit of oil in
the<00:03:53.040> cylinder<00:03:53.400> walls<00:03:53.580> and<00:03:53.910> see<00:03:54.630> if<00:03:55.110> that<00:03:55.260> bumps

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
the cylinder walls and see if that bumps

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:56.930 
the cylinder walls and see if that bumps
up<00:03:55.650> the<00:03:55.680> compression<00:03:56.310> and<00:03:56.460> then<00:03:56.550> if<00:03:56.640> it<00:03:56.760> does

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
up the compression and then if it does

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.050 
up the compression and then if it does
I'll<00:03:57.150> know<00:03:57.270> it's<00:03:57.390> the<00:03:57.540> ring<00:03:57.750> so<00:03:58.760> okay<00:03:59.760> so<00:03:59.790> we're

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
I'll know it's the ring so okay so we're

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.780 
I'll know it's the ring so okay so we're
back<00:04:00.860> got<00:04:01.860> it<00:04:01.890> in<00:04:02.070> there<00:04:02.250> if<00:04:02.370> that's<00:04:02.490> feeling

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
back got it in there if that's feeling

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:14.690 
back got it in there if that's feeling
too<00:04:02.940> much<00:04:02.970> of<00:04:03.330> it<00:04:03.510> well<00:04:04.310> maybe

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:23.300 

1:20<00:04:19.410> so<00:04:20.609> part<00:04:21.609> of<00:04:21.669> its<00:04:21.820> rings<00:04:22.060> definitely

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
1:20 so part of its rings definitely

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.830 
1:20 so part of its rings definitely
could<00:04:24.310> be<00:04:24.340> something<00:04:24.820> else<00:04:24.970> -<00:04:25.270> maybe<00:04:25.600> the

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
could be something else - maybe the

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:31.340 
could be something else - maybe the
valves<00:04:26.430> aren't<00:04:27.430> 100%<00:04:27.850> sealing<00:04:28.540> properly

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:33.480 

basically<00:04:32.350> all<00:04:32.470> there's<00:04:32.680> left<00:04:32.740> to<00:04:33.010> do<00:04:33.190> is<00:04:33.340> just

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
basically all there's left to do is just

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:34.680 
basically all there's left to do is just
go<00:04:33.550> ahead<00:04:33.580> and<00:04:33.760> take<00:04:33.880> it<00:04:33.910> apart<00:04:34.060> after<00:04:34.419> taking

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
go ahead and take it apart after taking

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:37.830 
go ahead and take it apart after taking
part<00:04:34.930> in<00:04:35.110> anyhow<00:04:35.350> so<00:04:35.680> I<00:04:36.479> guess<00:04:37.479> I'm<00:04:37.630> gonna<00:04:37.720> have

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
part in anyhow so I guess I'm gonna have

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.060 
part in anyhow so I guess I'm gonna have
to<00:04:37.900> get<00:04:38.050> get<00:04:38.500> started<00:04:38.979> on<00:04:39.100> that<00:04:40.080> but<00:04:41.080> you<00:04:41.889> don't

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.070 
to get get started on that but you don't

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:43.530 
to get get started on that but you don't
know<00:04:42.160> like<00:04:42.430> I<00:04:42.580> was<00:04:42.639> saying<00:04:42.910> earlier<00:04:43.030> I<00:04:43.270> could

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:43.540 
know like I was saying earlier I could

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:45.480 
know like I was saying earlier I could
have<00:04:43.660> all<00:04:44.290> the<00:04:44.470> money<00:04:44.650> and<00:04:44.770> time<00:04:44.889> I<00:04:45.130> put<00:04:45.340> into

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.490 
have all the money and time I put into

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:47.730 
have all the money and time I put into
this<00:04:45.700> frickin<00:04:46.180> thing<00:04:46.210> I<00:04:46.720> could<00:04:47.440> have<00:04:47.470> just

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740 
this frickin thing I could have just

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:52.710 
this frickin thing I could have just
waited<00:04:48.750> an<00:04:49.750> extra<00:04:49.930> two<00:04:50.830> three<00:04:51.190> weeks<00:04:51.430> and<00:04:52.389> did

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
waited an extra two three weeks and did

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.390 
waited an extra two three weeks and did
the<00:04:52.840> LS<00:04:53.169> swapping<00:04:53.680> the<00:04:53.770> other<00:04:53.860> thing<00:04:54.160> and<00:04:54.310> out

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:54.400 
the LS swapping the other thing and out

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.170 
the LS swapping the other thing and out
had<00:04:54.610> a<00:04:54.639> LS<00:04:55.000> swap<00:04:55.150> coop<00:04:55.950> and<00:04:56.950> now<00:04:57.130> I<00:04:57.160> have<00:04:57.490> this

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.180 
had a LS swap coop and now I have this

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.150 
had a LS swap coop and now I have this
thing<00:04:58.240> and<00:04:58.750> I<00:04:59.110> still<00:04:59.320> got<00:04:59.470> to<00:04:59.500> do<00:04:59.650> the<00:04:59.770> LS<00:05:00.040> swap

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:00.160 
thing and I still got to do the LS swap

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.140 
thing and I still got to do the LS swap
so<00:05:00.580> oh<00:05:01.710> that's<00:05:02.710> it<00:05:02.860> for<00:05:03.040> now<00:05:03.160> runs<00:05:03.639> so

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.150 
so oh that's it for now runs so

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:05.190
