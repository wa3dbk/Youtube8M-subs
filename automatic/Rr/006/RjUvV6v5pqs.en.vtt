introduction I developed my own version
of<00:00:51.460> the<00:00:51.640> double-cross<00:00:52.120> by<00:00:52.720> combining<00:00:52.960> single

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:53.680 
of the double-cross by combining single

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.010 
of the double-cross by combining single
crosses<00:00:54.100> in<00:00:54.280> either<00:00:54.579> direction<00:00:54.820> the<00:00:55.660> single

crosses in either direction the single

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.290 
crosses in either direction the single
cross<00:00:56.260> is<00:00:56.469> executed<00:00:57.370> by<00:00:57.550> simply<00:00:57.910> taking<00:00:58.090> a

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:58.300 
cross is executed by simply taking a

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.750 
cross is executed by simply taking a
three-stroke<00:00:58.930> roll<00:00:59.200> right<00:00:59.860> left<00:01:00.190> right<00:01:00.489> left

from week it's a strong side the best
way<00:01:29.829> to<00:01:29.889> explain<00:01:30.279> the<00:01:30.549> double<00:01:30.850> cross<00:01:31.090> is<00:01:31.359> to

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
way to explain the double cross is to

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.870 
way to explain the double cross is to
break<00:01:31.810> it<00:01:31.959> down<00:01:32.079> into<00:01:32.499> two<00:01:32.770> five<00:01:33.219> stroke<00:01:33.579> rolls

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
break it down into two five stroke rolls
