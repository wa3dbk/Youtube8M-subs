00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.420 
region they're a powerhouse of rugby and
I<00:01:49.079> think<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.350> chance<00:01:49.590> to<00:01:49.799> see<00:01:49.979> them<00:01:50.159> here<00:01:50.280> in

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
I think the chance to see them here in

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.859 
I think the chance to see them here in
this<00:01:50.460> stadium<00:01:50.939> is<00:01:51.000> going<00:01:51.180> to<00:01:51.240> be<00:01:51.299> very<00:01:51.329> special

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
this stadium is going to be very special

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.240 
this stadium is going to be very special
how<00:01:52.170> do<00:01:52.229> you<00:01:52.320> think<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.619> stadium's<00:01:52.979> going<00:01:53.189> to

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
how do you think the stadium's going to

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.969 
how do you think the stadium's going to
suit<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:54.390> rugby<00:01:55.079> crowd<00:01:55.290> and<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.590> rugby<00:01:55.829> match

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
suit the rugby crowd and the rugby match

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.980 
suit the rugby crowd and the rugby match
oh<00:01:56.189> I<00:01:56.670> think<00:01:56.939> you're<00:01:57.270> all<00:01:57.420> going<00:01:57.630> to<00:01:57.659> love<00:01:57.960> it

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.230 
oh I think you're all going to love it
we've<00:01:58.829> actually<00:01:58.979> got<00:01:59.219> an<00:01:59.310> open<00:01:59.579> concourse<00:02:00.060> in

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
we've actually got an open concourse in

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.149 
we've actually got an open concourse in
Milton<00:02:00.570> Keynes<00:02:00.750> it's<00:02:01.020> very<00:02:01.350> unusual<00:02:01.560> for<00:02:01.979> a

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
Milton Keynes it's very unusual for a

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.760 
Milton Keynes it's very unusual for a
stadium<00:02:02.430> and<00:02:02.729> in<00:02:03.450> football<00:02:03.689> games<00:02:04.079> you<00:02:04.619> can

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
stadium and in football games you can

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.560 
stadium and in football games you can
only<00:02:04.890> use<00:02:05.009> it<00:02:05.280> as<00:02:05.369> a<00:02:05.399> walkway<00:02:05.700> you<00:02:06.000> can't<00:02:06.329> use

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
only use it as a walkway you can't use

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.449 
only use it as a walkway you can't use
it<00:02:06.750> as<00:02:06.869> an<00:02:06.990> area<00:02:07.320> to<00:02:07.500> observe<00:02:07.829> the<00:02:07.979> pitch<00:02:08.220> but

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
it as an area to observe the pitch but

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.910 
it as an area to observe the pitch but
in<00:02:08.580> rugby<00:02:08.849> you<00:02:09.390> actually<00:02:09.569> can<00:02:09.810> stand<00:02:10.709> there

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
in rugby you actually can stand there

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:11.400 
in rugby you actually can stand there
all<00:02:11.129> the

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
all the

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:12.960 
all the
way<00:02:11.500> around<00:02:11.620> the<00:02:12.010> stadium<00:02:12.250> having<00:02:12.670> a<00:02:12.730> view<00:02:12.940> of

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
way around the stadium having a view of

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.940 
way around the stadium having a view of
the<00:02:13.060> pitch<00:02:13.330> before<00:02:13.750> you<00:02:14.050> take<00:02:14.290> your<00:02:14.320> seats<00:02:14.740> I

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
the pitch before you take your seats I

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.830 
the pitch before you take your seats I
think<00:02:15.670> it<00:02:15.760> gives<00:02:15.880> it<00:02:16.000> a<00:02:16.120> very<00:02:16.150> special

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
think it gives it a very special

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.750 
think it gives it a very special
atmosphere<00:02:16.990> the<00:02:17.770> seats<00:02:18.010> are<00:02:18.100> very<00:02:18.160> close<00:02:18.580> to

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
atmosphere the seats are very close to

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.430 
atmosphere the seats are very close to
the<00:02:18.850> action<00:02:19.210> and<00:02:19.390> of<00:02:19.720> course<00:02:19.990> what<00:02:20.200> we've<00:02:20.320> been

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
the action and of course what we've been

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.140 
the action and of course what we've been
able<00:02:20.590> to<00:02:20.860> do<00:02:21.010> and<00:02:21.160> I<00:02:21.220> think<00:02:21.460> that<00:02:21.640> the<00:02:21.790> Saints

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
able to do and I think that the Saints

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.940 
able to do and I think that the Saints
and<00:02:22.210> our<00:02:22.360> ground<00:02:22.660> staff<00:02:22.990> have<00:02:23.410> worked<00:02:23.440> really

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
and our ground staff have worked really

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.100 
and our ground staff have worked really
hard<00:02:24.130> together<00:02:24.550> to<00:02:25.270> make<00:02:25.450> sure<00:02:25.660> that<00:02:25.840> we<00:02:25.930> can

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
hard together to make sure that we can

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.370 
hard together to make sure that we can
recreate<00:02:26.730> the<00:02:27.730> right<00:02:28.420> size<00:02:28.750> to<00:02:29.020> pitch<00:02:29.200> the

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
recreate the right size to pitch the

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.890 
recreate the right size to pitch the
hundred-meter<00:02:29.830> pitch<00:02:30.220> and<00:02:30.490> that<00:02:31.060> the<00:02:31.540> Saints

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
hundred-meter pitch and that the Saints

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.600 
hundred-meter pitch and that the Saints
fans<00:02:32.380> will<00:02:32.740> have<00:02:32.980> something<00:02:33.250> that<00:02:33.460> they're

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
fans will have something that they're

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.250 
fans will have something that they're
used<00:02:33.850> to<00:02:33.970> seeing<00:02:34.030> in<00:02:34.420> terms<00:02:34.540> of<00:02:34.900> the<00:02:34.990> rugby

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
used to seeing in terms of the rugby

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.960 
used to seeing in terms of the rugby
they're<00:02:35.290> watching<00:02:35.800> how<00:02:36.100> closely<00:02:36.400> from<00:02:36.790> your
