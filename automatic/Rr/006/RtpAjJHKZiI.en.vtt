 mapafre foundation presents educates your 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.050
 world 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:16.730
 educate your world in reused I reduce and 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.730
 I recycle paper at school and at home 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.939
 hello paula hello, have you noticed the 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:31.480
 amount of paper we spend all the 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:34.930
 days it's true we spend a lot of paper in 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:37.300
 class and also at home 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.880
 to make paper we have to cut down 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:42.670
 trees for every ton of paper that 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:46.350
 we make you have to cut 15 trees and 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.350
 a lot of water and energy is spent 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.020
 Today I 'm going to show you the rule of 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.239
 three Rs and how to apply it to 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:55.790
 use paper better to spend less 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:58.940
 water and energy and pollute less every 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:02.690
 day you know the story of the last sheet 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:04.420
 of paper I do not know you do not want you 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:09.030
 I count it 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:09.030
 tell me, it 's okay 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:17.600
 Once upon a time there was a sheet of paper that was 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:19.520
 the last leaf of the whole earth all the 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.070
 I wanted her to write in her 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.020
 print use it to wrap the 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.810
 sandwich or clean in the hands 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.299
 after eating 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:31.180
 all the children wanted to decorate with 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:34.180
 her drawings but she did not let 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:36.600
 because it was the last sheet of paper it 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:39.369
 I felt very loved by all humans 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.950
 his dream was to be part of a book 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:44.110
 but I could not get it because I did not 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.000
 there were more sheets of paper in the world with 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:49.329
 those that come together to be able to form a 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:53.439
 nice book the last sheet of paper is 

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:56.010
 I felt very lonely in the poor world and 

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:58.140
 why she was left alone 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:00.720
 because people had already used 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.360
 all the sheets of paper and they had 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:06.150
 cut all the trees so no longer 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.920
 could make more paper 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:11.550
 we can do to avoid that 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:14.220
 the paper runs out very easy you just have 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:17.340
 that apply a simple rule the rule 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:21.220
 of the three R's and what rule is that 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:24.670
 three R's I do not know 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:28.920
 each r that indicates a word 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:31.660
 look at the first r is to reduce 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.849
 reduce means we must spend 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:37.300
 less raw materials less water and less 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:40.840
 energy and therefore less paper the 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:42.790
 second r is to reuse that implies 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.160
 give a new use to the paper that has already 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:48.400
 been used instead of throwing it to the 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:50.739
 garbage and the third ere is that of 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.290
 recycle that involves re -manufacturing 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:55.650
 new paper from the paper that already 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.650
 we used 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.620
 and how can we apply each of those 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:04.370
 words to the paper that we use in the 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:06.620
 school or at home we can reduce spending 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.450
 of paper for example taking advantage of well 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.220
 the space on each sheet of the notebook and 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:13.459
 writing on both sides of the 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:15.580
 leaves and at home using napkins 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:18.530
 of cloth instead of paper napkins 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:20.480
 we can reuse the paper using 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.700
 example the old papers of dad or 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.160
 mom to do the accounts or to 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.410
 to draw 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.480
 and if we spare part of a notebook in 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.340
 We can use a course for the 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:34.060
 next course removing the leaves 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:37.150
 old it is very important to recycle 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:39.760
 paper at school at home is also 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:42.090
 very easy to recycle me there I have a cube 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.800
 where I just throw the papers and cartons 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.450
 very well and then you have to take the 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:50.820
 paper that we have separated to the container 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.820
 correct do you know what colors 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:57.810
 the container to which we must throw the 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:04:00.420
 paper is blue very well and for 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:03.540
 last as long as you can buy and 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:05.670
 use recycled paper how many things 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.650
 it has been learned today but you have not 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:12.410
 finished telling me what happened to the 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.410
 last sheet of paper is true 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:19.100
 the last sheet of paper felt very 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:21.170
 alone in the world but some children 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:24.740
 they decided to collect all the used paper 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:27.500
 of the planet they recycled and with it 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:30.440
 they made recycled paper 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:32.960
 so the last sheet of paper stopped being 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:35.360
 the only one in the world and could finally form 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.430
 the book that dreamed so much of 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:40.820
 children taught the rule of three 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:43.430
 rres to everyone and the last sheet 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:46.880
 of paper never again returned to stay 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:48.290
 alone that the more beautiful many 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.510
 Thank you 

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:52.850
 I will tell the others and also the 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:54.650
 rule of the three R's that will help us 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:56.889
 to prevent us from running out of paper in 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:05:00.350
 the world 

00:04:56.889 --> 00:05:02.919
 remember today we have learned the rule of 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:02.919
 the three Rs 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:08.660
 how to reduce paper spending in the 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:11.360
 school and at home how to reuse it 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:14.960
 giving it new uses and how to recycle it 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:18.110
 taking it to the right containers 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:20.870
 in your class you recycle paper if you have not yet 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:24.169
 do you can start from today 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:26.330
 It is very easy to ask your teacher to bring 

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:29.780
 a cardboard box and put a poster 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:32.120
 with the words just paper and cardboard and 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:34.520
 from that moment deposited there 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:37.750
 all the used paper that generated for 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:40.300
 then take it to the blue container 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:43.020
 See you soon see you guys in the 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:43.020
 next video
