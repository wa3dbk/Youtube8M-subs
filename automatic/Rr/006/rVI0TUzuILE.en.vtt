00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
uncomfortable this way um probably lack

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.340 
uncomfortable this way um probably lack
of<00:03:04.120> flexibility<00:03:04.660> it<00:03:04.780> problem<00:03:05.050> something<00:03:05.290> I

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
of flexibility it problem something I

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.140 
of flexibility it problem something I
could<00:03:05.560> train<00:03:05.800> for<00:03:05.830> but<00:03:06.250> should<00:03:06.670> I<00:03:06.760> just<00:03:06.940> do<00:03:07.060> it

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
could train for but should I just do it

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:08.790

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:13.360 
more in volume on big limits like this

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.229 
more in volume on big limits like this
and<00:04:14.360> then<00:04:14.540> this<00:04:14.570> is<00:04:14.750> me<00:04:15.080> trying<00:04:15.290> front<00:04:15.770> squats

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
and then this is me trying front squats

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:20.080 
and then this is me trying front squats
I<00:04:17.239> suck<00:04:18.140> at<00:04:18.290> this<00:04:18.470> group<00:04:18.770> it's<00:04:19.730> funny<00:04:20.000> how

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.090 
I suck at this group it's funny how

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:21.940 
I suck at this group it's funny how
there's<00:04:20.540> 25<00:04:20.959> on<00:04:21.140> each<00:04:21.260> side<00:04:21.440> which<00:04:21.650> is<00:04:21.680> what<00:04:21.920> I

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:21.950 
there's 25 on each side which is what I

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:23.380 
there's 25 on each side which is what I
did<00:04:22.010> in<00:04:22.250> that<00:04:22.340> other<00:04:22.490> video<00:04:22.730> and<00:04:22.940> I<00:04:23.150> tried<00:04:23.360> my

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:23.390 
did in that other video and I tried my

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:26.460 
did in that other video and I tried my
first<00:04:23.570> time<00:04:23.990> I<00:04:24.200> did<00:04:25.010> a<00:04:25.040> 1<00:04:25.310> rep<00:04:25.640> right<00:04:25.820> there<00:04:26.090> and

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
first time I did a 1 rep right there and

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:30.430 
first time I did a 1 rep right there and
decided<00:04:27.470> it<00:04:27.680> was<00:04:27.980> hurting<00:04:28.430> too<00:04:28.550> much<00:04:29.230> so<00:04:30.230> then

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440 
decided it was hurting too much so then

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.620 
decided it was hurting too much so then
I<00:04:30.920> dropped<00:04:31.610> the<00:04:31.820> weight<00:04:31.970> and<00:04:32.150> I'm<00:04:32.240> like<00:04:32.360> okay

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:32.630 
I dropped the weight and I'm like okay

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:34.360 
I dropped the weight and I'm like okay
well<00:04:32.780> it<00:04:32.930> must<00:04:33.110> be<00:04:33.320> like<00:04:33.620> the<00:04:33.800> way<00:04:33.920> I'm<00:04:34.040> holding

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370 
well it must be like the way I'm holding

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:35.690 
well it must be like the way I'm holding
it<00:04:34.520> so<00:04:34.640> I'm<00:04:34.700> really<00:04:34.910> going<00:04:35.030> to<00:04:35.120> drop<00:04:35.270> down

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:35.700 
it so I'm really going to drop down

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:36.920 
it so I'm really going to drop down
wait<00:04:35.850> doesn't<00:04:36.030> matter<00:04:36.300> it's<00:04:36.540> got<00:04:36.660> to<00:04:36.750> figure

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
wait doesn't matter it's got to figure

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:41.960 
wait doesn't matter it's got to figure
out<00:04:37.050> the<00:04:37.200> method<00:04:37.710> right<00:04:37.890> and<00:04:38.610> I<00:04:39.420> think<00:04:39.450> I<00:04:40.970> could

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 
out the method right and I think I could

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:44.210 
out the method right and I think I could
deal<00:04:42.120> with<00:04:42.270> it<00:04:42.420> but<00:04:42.810> afterlife<00:04:43.260> i<00:04:43.560> think<00:04:43.830> i<00:04:44.070> did

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 
deal with it but afterlife i think i did

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.340 
deal with it but afterlife i think i did
are<00:04:44.310> four<00:04:44.580> or<00:04:44.670> five<00:04:44.850> hear<00:04:45.150> see<00:04:46.110> and<00:04:46.140> then<00:04:46.320> i

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:46.350 
are four or five hear see and then i

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:47.570 
are four or five hear see and then i
stopped<00:04:46.680> because<00:04:46.950> i'm<00:04:47.010> trying<00:04:47.250> to<00:04:47.340> figure<00:04:47.460> it

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
stopped because i'm trying to figure it

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.130 
stopped because i'm trying to figure it
out<00:04:47.700> like<00:04:47.880> I'm<00:04:48.000> thinking<00:04:48.300> real<00:04:48.480> hard<00:04:48.510> about<00:04:48.840> no

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:49.140 
out like I'm thinking real hard about no

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:51.470 
out like I'm thinking real hard about no
wait<00:04:49.350> and<00:04:49.500> my<00:04:49.560> fingers<00:04:50.120> trying<00:04:51.120> to<00:04:51.240> keep<00:04:51.330> those

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:51.480 
wait and my fingers trying to keep those

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.230 
wait and my fingers trying to keep those
elbows<00:04:51.750> up<00:04:52.110> but<00:04:52.680> it's<00:04:52.830> still<00:04:53.100> like<00:04:53.520> doesn't<00:04:54.120> it

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 
elbows up but it's still like doesn't it

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.800 
elbows up but it's still like doesn't it
you're<00:04:54.600> right<00:04:55.430> so<00:04:56.430> i<00:04:56.490> said<00:04:57.030> screw<00:04:57.060> that<00:04:57.450> again

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810 
you're right so i said screw that again

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:00.920 
you're right so i said screw that again
and<00:04:58.740> then<00:04:59.430> I<00:04:59.520> try<00:04:59.580> a<00:04:59.820> cross<00:05:00.150> grip<00:05:00.510> and<00:05:00.750> it<00:05:00.780> was

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930 
and then I try a cross grip and it was

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:04.250 
and then I try a cross grip and it was
like<00:05:01.110> magic<00:05:02.030> yeah<00:05:03.030> I<00:05:03.390> think<00:05:03.810> it's<00:05:03.930> because<00:05:04.080> my

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:04.260 
like magic yeah I think it's because my

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.550 
like magic yeah I think it's because my
anterior<00:05:04.710> delt<00:05:05.150> kind<00:05:06.150> of<00:05:06.270> walk<00:05:06.960> sit<00:05:07.260> in<00:05:07.380> that

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 
anterior delt kind of walk sit in that

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.100 
anterior delt kind of walk sit in that
position<00:05:07.770> better<00:05:08.250> I<00:05:08.580> was<00:05:09.150> able<00:05:09.270> to<00:05:09.510> even<00:05:09.690> start

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.110 
position better I was able to even start
