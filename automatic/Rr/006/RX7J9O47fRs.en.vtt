they'll be best friends for a while and

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.400 
they'll be best friends for a while and
palm<00:03:25.130> I<00:03:25.580> believe<00:03:26.330> she's<00:03:26.570> dead<00:03:26.810> because<00:03:27.050> there

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
palm I believe she's dead because there

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:30.100 
palm I believe she's dead because there
was<00:03:27.500> too<00:03:27.530> much<00:03:27.890> emphasis<00:03:28.580> on<00:03:28.820> palm<00:03:29.690> this

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.110 
was too much emphasis on palm this

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:32.110 
was too much emphasis on palm this
episode<00:03:30.590> with<00:03:30.770> gone<00:03:31.010> you<00:03:31.280> know<00:03:31.310> him<00:03:31.550> asking

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
episode with gone you know him asking

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.180 
episode with gone you know him asking
everyone<00:03:32.840> have<00:03:33.260> you<00:03:33.380> heard<00:03:33.500> from<00:03:33.590> palm<00:03:33.890> and

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
everyone have you heard from palm and

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.100 
everyone have you heard from palm and
right<00:03:35.000> before<00:03:35.150> he<00:03:35.420> walked<00:03:35.630> out<00:03:35.750> he<00:03:35.930> thought

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.110 
right before he walked out he thought

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:38.500 
right before he walked out he thought
about<00:03:36.350> her<00:03:36.500> so<00:03:36.710> I'm<00:03:36.920> I'm<00:03:37.370> guessing<00:03:37.940> this<00:03:38.330> is<00:03:38.480> a

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
about her so I'm I'm guessing this is a

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:39.940 
about her so I'm I'm guessing this is a
foreshadowing<00:03:39.050> that<00:03:39.170> something<00:03:39.680> did<00:03:39.920> happen

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
foreshadowing that something did happen

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.280 
foreshadowing that something did happen
to<00:03:40.490> her<00:03:40.610> which<00:03:41.030> would<00:03:41.210> suck<00:03:41.480> hopefully<00:03:42.050> next

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
to her which would suck hopefully next

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.470 
to her which would suck hopefully next
episode<00:03:42.890> i<00:03:43.130> watch<00:03:43.520> the<00:03:43.670> preview<00:03:44.090> we<00:03:44.210> didn't

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
episode i watch the preview we didn't

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.140 
episode i watch the preview we didn't
get<00:03:44.600> any<00:03:44.840> palm<00:03:45.470> action<00:03:46.040> but<00:03:46.280> hopefully<00:03:46.850> we<00:03:47.000> get

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
get any palm action but hopefully we get

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:48.700 
get any palm action but hopefully we get
something<00:03:47.570> oh<00:03:47.870> yeah<00:03:48.020> how<00:03:48.200> could<00:03:48.320> I<00:03:48.410> forget<00:03:48.440> to

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:48.710 
something oh yeah how could I forget to

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:50.470 
something oh yeah how could I forget to
mention<00:03:48.830> kilowatt<00:03:49.610> says<00:03:49.820> that<00:03:50.090> he<00:03:50.150> will<00:03:50.240> cover

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
mention kilowatt says that he will cover

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.470 
mention kilowatt says that he will cover
gone<00:03:50.750> so<00:03:51.140> his<00:03:51.590> fight<00:03:51.920> with<00:03:51.950> Neffe<00:03:52.400> pito<00:03:52.790> will

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
gone so his fight with Neffe pito will

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.270 
gone so his fight with Neffe pito will
not<00:03:53.810> be<00:03:53.960> interrupted<00:03:54.380> and<00:03:54.710> he<00:03:54.830> will<00:03:54.950> protect

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 
not be interrupted and he will protect

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.880 
not be interrupted and he will protect
him<00:03:55.370> with<00:03:55.610> his<00:03:55.760> new<00:03:56.090> ability<00:03:56.660> and<00:03:57.110> he<00:03:57.440> did<00:03:57.590> some

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:57.890 
him with his new ability and he did some

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:59.830 
him with his new ability and he did some
awesome<00:03:58.190> no<00:03:58.730> static<00:03:59.120> stuff<00:03:59.300> with<00:03:59.450> his<00:03:59.540> hands

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
awesome no static stuff with his hands

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.510 
awesome no static stuff with his hands
so<00:04:00.140> I'm<00:04:00.230> guessing<00:04:00.470> that<00:04:00.740> he's<00:04:01.100> going<00:04:01.280> to<00:04:01.340> go

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:01.520 
so I'm guessing that he's going to go

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.430 
so I'm guessing that he's going to go
static<00:04:02.360> shock<00:04:02.660> at<00:04:02.810> his<00:04:02.900> bitch<00:04:03.080> he's<00:04:03.260> gonna

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:03.440 
static shock at his bitch he's gonna

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.500 
static shock at his bitch he's gonna
turn<00:04:03.650> do<00:04:04.130> like<00:04:04.340> a<00:04:04.370> little<00:04:04.550> blue<00:04:04.880> super<00:04:05.300> saiyan

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:33.450

them I'm pretty sure that all them won't
be<00:04:33.570> destroyed<00:04:33.960> because<00:04:34.140> you<00:04:34.500> know<00:04:34.620> the

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:34.950 
be destroyed because you know the

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:36.650 
be destroyed because you know the
hunters<00:04:35.250> are<00:04:35.340> coming<00:04:35.670> in<00:04:35.850> to<00:04:36.090> help<00:04:36.330> everyone

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 
but I'm pretty sure a lot of them while

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:40.910 
but I'm pretty sure a lot of them while
a<00:04:39.000> few<00:04:39.270> of<00:04:39.360> them<00:04:39.510> will<00:04:39.720> be<00:04:39.990> slaughtered<00:04:40.320> so<00:04:40.680> I

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:40.920 
a few of them will be slaughtered so I

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:41.960
