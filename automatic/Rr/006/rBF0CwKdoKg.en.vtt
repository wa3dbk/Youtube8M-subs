00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:06.090
 hello everyone I'm loir today I bring you the 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.309
 analysis of a little gadget that I 

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:11.340
 gave away makes good for the birthday 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.110
 of bought in day to xtreem I'm going to 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.940
 teach a little what the truth is for 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.450
 is that really very simple and cheap 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.400
 is this what you are seeing 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:20.600
 really the name I do not know but good 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.550
 you have the link of the description of 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.770
 where to buy it is really very cheap 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.780
 only about four dollars if I do not remember 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:29.330
 wrong and well I will teach you why 

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:30.650
 it serves to see if I do not give anything else 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.330
 well you are not going to see the screen very well 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.829
 of the iphone since it does not focus too much 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:36.320
 good but good 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:37.940
 what serves is to increase the sound 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.149
 As many of you have already deduced for your 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:44.960
 way and as you can see what it does is catch 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:47.089
 the sound of the speaker and increases it with 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.570
 this amplifier of agreement would work 

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:52.660
 like a grammar of the 18th century as well 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.610
 I teach you ghoga 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.910
 I do not know if the increase will be appreciated 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:59.260
 sound but good let's try it out 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.750
 I agree that I will put first 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.340
 sound as you see with the iphone without 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.950
 the housing according to this case is the 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:08.620
 iphone 4 and it would work equally for 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.780
 the 4s for 5 I do not know if it exists but 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.850
 surely yes but good I'll put you 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.770
 how do you see a song at maximum volume 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.470
 in this case it is a song hand of 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.390
 sheen with true agreement and we're going to 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:22.360
 try it after putting it inside the 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:25.140
 accessory souvenir I hope it is followed 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.140
 so strong 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.640
 yes 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:59.110
 Well , you have already seen the sound that has 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:02.640
 listened to in conditions 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.640
 let's try it again 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.440
 well I do not know if it really 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.239
 will appreciate in the video but I hope so 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.739
 and as I tell you the truth is that it increases 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:23.599
 very much the sound and it is something quite 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:26.270
 economic is practically increased as 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:27.860
 If you had a speaker and well you save 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:30.230
 a lot of money so much in buying the 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.209
 accessory as after in batteries batteries 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.590
 this as you see, you do not need to stop it 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:35.750
 absolutely no site also has 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.430
 this slot so we can load the 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.190
 iPhone while we are using the 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.260
 accessory so it's really perfect 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.730
 for the price it has and so on 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.410
 Well I hope you liked to give 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:49.660
 like favorites and do not forget 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.660
 subscribe we see you goodbye
