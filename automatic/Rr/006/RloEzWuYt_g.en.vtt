first thing is this point is in pro
league<00:00:23.140> constructions<00:00:23.860> so<00:00:24.160> it's<00:00:24.520> a<00:00:24.669> partial

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:25.090 
league constructions so it's a partial

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:26.999 
league constructions so it's a partial
carbon<00:00:25.509> wrap<00:00:25.689> it's<00:00:25.990> very<00:00:26.259> light<00:00:26.529> it's<00:00:26.800> very

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:27.009 
carbon wrap it's very light it's very

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:32.400 
carbon wrap it's very light it's very
strong<00:00:28.740> there's<00:00:29.740> a<00:00:30.160> full<00:00:30.609> deck<00:00:31.539> and<00:00:31.810> nose<00:00:32.080> area

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:32.410 
strong there's a full deck and nose area

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:35.570 
strong there's a full deck and nose area
running<00:00:33.370> back<00:00:33.580> on<00:00:33.820> the<00:00:33.970> deck<00:00:34.239> with<00:00:34.510> a<00:00:34.839> recessed

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:35.580 
running back on the deck with a recessed

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.700 
running back on the deck with a recessed
standing<00:00:36.580> area<00:00:36.910> so<00:00:37.300> the<00:00:37.629> actual<00:00:37.780> stem<00:00:38.230> here<00:00:38.410> is

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:38.710 
standing area so the actual stem here is

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.579 
standing area so the actual stem here is
a<00:00:38.949> couple<00:00:39.519> of<00:00:39.580> inches<00:00:39.730> below<00:00:40.180> the<00:00:40.330> foredeck<00:00:40.960> so

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:41.589 
a couple of inches below the foredeck so

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:43.350 
a couple of inches below the foredeck so
water<00:00:41.980> should<00:00:42.250> run<00:00:42.460> straight<00:00:42.850> off<00:00:43.000> the<00:00:43.030> top<00:00:43.329> of

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:43.360 
water should run straight off the top of

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.770 
water should run straight off the top of
there<00:00:43.600> and<00:00:43.960> after<00:00:44.530> off<00:00:45.070> the<00:00:45.190> board<00:00:45.430> so<00:00:46.360> it's

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:46.780 
there and after off the board so it's

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.310 
there and after off the board so it's
got<00:00:47.019> a<00:00:47.049> really<00:00:47.680> soft<00:00:48.190> squishing<00:00:48.970> EV<00:00:49.479> a<00:00:49.510> death

a much lower center of gravity and make

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.579 
a much lower center of gravity and make
a<00:00:59.530> board<00:00:59.769> more<00:00:59.920> stable<00:01:00.309> so<00:01:01.150> pop<00:01:01.960> racing<00:01:02.439> you

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.040 
water really quick so check it out at a

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.740 
water really quick so check it out at a
handle<00:01:06.400> in<00:01:06.460> the<00:01:06.549> center<00:01:06.850> here<00:01:06.880> thinks<00:01:07.630> it

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:07.750 
handle in the center here thinks it

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.450 
handle in the center here thinks it
really<00:01:07.990> is<00:01:08.110> to<00:01:08.380> quickly<00:01:08.650> pick<00:01:08.979> the<00:01:09.100> board<00:01:09.310> up

plenty<00:01:35.500> of<00:01:35.590> volume<00:01:35.950> in<00:01:36.100> them<00:01:36.250> so<00:01:36.520> it's<00:01:36.700> not

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:36.760 
plenty of volume in them so it's not

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.740 
plenty of volume in them so it's not
going<00:01:36.970> to<00:01:37.060> be<00:01:37.120> too<00:01:37.300> tippy<00:01:37.750> and<00:01:39.000> 29<00:01:40.000> inches<00:01:40.420> wide

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
going to be too tippy and 29 inches wide

further you go forward up into the nose

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.020 
further you go forward up into the nose
and<00:02:50.379> starts<00:02:50.709> become<00:02:51.010> more<00:02:51.190> of<00:02:51.220> a<00:02:51.370> role<00:02:51.610> being
