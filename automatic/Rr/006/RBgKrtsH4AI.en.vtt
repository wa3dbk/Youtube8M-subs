00:00:01.889 --> 00:00:12.420
 Today a wonderful morning on May 31 decided 

00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:12.420
 make measurements 

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:20.250
 car chevrolet cruze 14 turbo 2014 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:23.560
 Year of release 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:28.869
 means we will check first 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:30.779
 then we look at the speedometer which 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:33.960
 then you can double-check 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:39.420
 stopwatch overclocking to 100 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:44.620
 also using auto acceleration program 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:48.300
 which focuses on showing dps 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:54.210
 and accelerometer and also check 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:57.149
 what kind of love where does j oh boost 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:02.350
 we will do in the same conditions 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:05.290
 on a straight stretch at the time 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.880
 when the machines are not 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:10.150
 will not and will not interfere 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:13.590
 it means the first measurement we do it means albus 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:17.430
 set sport mode power 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:22.630
 last value 9 they are from 0 to 9 a 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:25.270
 then we will measure the same conditions 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:28.360
 but just put in the normal 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:32.380
 position that is as if without 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:35.290
 boost so here it seems like on the road now 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:39.960
 on whom there is no other way we are now 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:42.790
 turn around so that no one interferes 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:46.300
 tried to make measurements 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:48.510
 the car program is already driving the pride 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:54.940
 wait for the program 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:02:00.720
 measurement is inserted by a button just to them 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:03.990
 emergency gang while cars go there 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:06.789
 now they will pass us 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:12.150
 I set the button I do not know 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:13.840
 as far as can be seen after 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:17.590
 will be calibrated 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:22.930
 in the corner and the signal will know that you can 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:33.849
 will go so we leave for start 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:52.239
 position push ready waiting for all signal 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:58.590
 there you can go well, just go like that 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:03:01.060
 the signal was number passed the hour of the road 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.510
 to turn back 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:06.910
 side stand in the same place and 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:12.510
 let's see now how we will 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:15.609
 the result is so the roads have moved out 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:21.220
 wonderful night of scientists here 

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:27.340
 It shows 10 and 6 10 0 I do not know 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:30.090
 as far as the view, I think it highlights 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.090
 on us from all sides 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:41.380
 in fact and can not even understand 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:57.650
 okay shorter shows first 10 and 6 2 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:04:02.190
 0 10 was at a rate hundred. 78 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:05.340
 so that's all for now 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:08.900
 turned around going to the starting point 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.900
 for the second measurement
