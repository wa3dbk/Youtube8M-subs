hole and then you blue one two and three

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.550 
hole and then you blue one two and three
together<00:02:10.880> don't<00:02:11.880> move<00:02:12.060> and<00:02:12.360> draw<00:02:12.990> again<00:02:13.320> and

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
together don't move and draw again and

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.380

one<00:02:14.010> two<00:02:14.220> three<00:02:14.370> together

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
one two three together

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.850 
one two three together
and<00:02:16.010> then<00:02:17.010> you<00:02:17.130> blow<00:02:17.340> again<00:02:17.670> and<00:02:18.660> that's<00:02:19.410> all

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
and then you blow again and that's all

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
and then you blow again and that's all
so<00:02:20.459> do<00:02:20.820> it<00:02:20.850> just<00:02:21.240> one<00:02:21.690> time<00:02:21.950> first

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:03:05.230 

don't<00:02:52.880> try<00:02:53.240> to<00:02:53.300> do<00:02:53.630> that<00:02:53.840> for<00:02:53.900> example<00:03:03.940> so<00:03:04.940> I<00:03:04.970> do

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:05.240 
don't try to do that for example so I do

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.480 
don't try to do that for example so I do
like<00:03:05.900> I<00:03:06.320> don't<00:03:06.470> know<00:03:06.710> the<00:03:06.860> word<00:03:07.010> in<00:03:07.190> English

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:07.490 
like I don't know the word in English

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:09.810 
like I don't know the word in English
but<00:03:07.670> in<00:03:07.820> France<00:03:08.030> we<00:03:08.210> say<00:03:08.420> sallekhana

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
but in France we say sallekhana

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:22.690 
but in France we say sallekhana
okay<00:03:16.300> growing<00:03:17.300> oh<00:03:17.450> and<00:03:18.230> then<00:03:18.890> blowing<00:03:19.400> oh<00:03:21.700> and

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
okay growing oh and then blowing oh and

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.900 
okay growing oh and then blowing oh and
drawing<00:03:23.030> and<00:03:23.690> so<00:03:24.050> on<00:03:24.200> okay<00:03:25.480> do<00:03:26.480> it<00:03:26.600> very<00:03:27.020> slow<00:03:27.560> I

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
drawing and so on okay do it very slow I

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.270 
drawing and so on okay do it very slow I
think<00:03:28.910> it's<00:03:29.060> very<00:03:29.240> important<00:03:29.840> if<00:03:30.110> you<00:03:30.200> want<00:03:30.410> to

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
think it's very important if you want to

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.680 
think it's very important if you want to
get<00:03:31.460> precision<00:03:31.970> and<00:03:32.360> a<00:03:32.930> big<00:03:33.350> sound<00:03:33.650> to<00:03:34.310> work

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
get precision and a big sound to work

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:39.670 
get precision and a big sound to work
slow<00:03:35.860> and<00:03:36.860> then<00:03:37.160> you<00:03:37.340> can<00:03:37.640> accelerate<00:03:38.680> and

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
slow and then you can accelerate and

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.540 
slow and then you can accelerate and
when<00:03:40.220> you<00:03:40.340> lose<00:03:40.550> it<00:03:40.760> stop<00:03:41.690> it<00:03:41.900> and<00:03:42.190> do<00:03:43.190> it<00:03:43.310> again

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:43.550 
when you lose it stop it and do it again

00:03:43.550 --> 00:04:03.759 
when you lose it stop it and do it again
okay<00:03:44.150> like<00:03:44.930> this

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:03.769 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:23.800 

Walter<00:04:04.769> okay<00:04:05.610> one<00:04:06.209> two<00:04:06.810> three

okay<00:04:24.810> one<00:04:25.080> more<00:04:25.199> time

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
okay one more time

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:46.450 
okay one more time
do<00:04:25.710> it<00:04:25.800> with<00:04:25.949> me<00:04:26.130> one<00:04:26.820> two<00:04:27.419> three
