00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:47.989 
just two wheels in the ground you're

00:01:47.989 --> 00:01:50.499 
just two wheels in the ground you're
losing<00:01:48.319> a<00:01:48.349> little<00:01:48.469> bit<00:01:48.590> speed<00:01:49.360> excuse<00:01:50.360> me

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
losing a little bit speed excuse me

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:52.029 
losing a little bit speed excuse me
you're<00:01:50.659> losing<00:01:50.899> a<00:01:50.929> little<00:01:51.020> bit<00:01:51.200> of<00:01:51.289> speed<00:01:51.530> so

00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:52.039 
you're losing a little bit of speed so

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:53.499 
you're losing a little bit of speed so
they're<00:01:52.189> 40<00:01:52.520> a<00:01:52.549> bigger<00:01:52.819> wheel<00:01:52.969> and<00:01:53.239> your<00:01:53.329> times

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:53.509 
they're 40 a bigger wheel and your times

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:54.940 
they're 40 a bigger wheel and your times
making<00:01:53.750> up<00:01:53.959> for<00:01:54.079> the<00:01:54.140> speed<00:01:54.439> that<00:01:54.619> you<00:01:54.739> lost

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
making up for the speed that you lost

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.139 
making up for the speed that you lost
without<00:01:55.129> having<00:01:55.489> to<00:01:55.610> see<00:01:55.819> wheel

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
without having to see wheel

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.609 
without having to see wheel
I<00:01:57.179> know<00:01:57.719> it's<00:01:57.960> kind<00:01:58.109> of<00:01:58.140> a<00:01:58.200> lot<00:01:58.320> to<00:01:58.409> think<00:01:58.500> about

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
I know it's kind of a lot to think about

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.279 
I know it's kind of a lot to think about
but<00:01:58.820> just<00:01:59.820> trust<00:02:00.030> me<00:02:00.179> be<00:02:00.689> ready<00:02:00.810> at<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.109> rocker

00:02:01.279 --> 00:02:01.289 
but just trust me be ready at the rocker

you're running for your style you want a

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.109 
you're running for your style you want a
big<00:02:02.549> wheel<00:02:02.729> 58<00:02:03.630> 57<00:02:03.899> that's<00:02:04.649> what<00:02:04.770> I<00:02:04.829> go<00:02:04.979> for<00:02:05.119> you

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
big wheel 58 57 that's what I go for you

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.279 
big wheel 58 57 that's what I go for you
like<00:02:06.299> this<00:02:06.390> D<00:02:06.569> H<00:02:06.659> because<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:07.020> bigger<00:02:07.229> is

00:02:07.279 --> 00:02:07.289 
like this D H because the bigger is

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:08.229 
like this D H because the bigger is
better

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:08.239 
better

better
some<00:02:09.239> companies<00:02:09.810> make<00:02:09.929> fifty<00:02:10.170> nine<00:02:10.319> to<00:02:10.500> nine

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
some companies make fifty nine to nine

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.890 
some companies make fifty nine to nine
eleven<00:02:10.679> 259<00:02:11.269> or<00:02:12.269> right<00:02:12.390> forming<00:02:12.660> some<00:02:12.780> could

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
eleven 259 or right forming some could

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.180 
eleven 259 or right forming some could
be<00:02:12.959> no<00:02:13.200> engineer<00:02:13.560> so<00:02:13.650> you<00:02:13.739> can<00:02:13.860> go<00:02:13.950> for<00:02:14.099> those

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
be no engineer so you can go for those

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.670 
be no engineer so you can go for those
two<00:02:14.840> but<00:02:15.840> the<00:02:15.930> thing<00:02:16.049> I'm<00:02:16.170> what<00:02:16.260> frame<00:02:16.500> you

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
two but the thing I'm what frame you

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.559 
two but the thing I'm what frame you
have<00:02:16.860> so<00:02:17.069> I'm<00:02:17.129> going<00:02:17.340> to<00:02:17.400> fit<00:02:17.610> differently<00:02:18.299> in

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
have so I'm going to fit differently in

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:20.839 
have so I'm going to fit differently in
a<00:02:18.840> different<00:02:19.590> frame<00:02:20.069> so<00:02:20.400> if<00:02:20.519> you're<00:02:20.640> going<00:02:20.760> to

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
a different frame so if you're going to

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:22.880 
a different frame so if you're going to
write<00:02:20.970> a<00:02:21.000> bigger<00:02:21.180> wheel<00:02:21.330> like<00:02:21.510> that<00:02:21.739> I'm<00:02:22.739> gonna

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
write a bigger wheel like that I'm gonna

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.259 
write a bigger wheel like that I'm gonna
call<00:02:23.040> us<00:02:23.190> and<00:02:23.310> just<00:02:23.430> make<00:02:23.580> sure<00:02:23.730> I<00:02:23.760> can<00:02:23.910> fit<00:02:24.150> in

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
call us and just make sure I can fit in

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:28.009 
call us and just make sure I can fit in
your<00:02:24.299> skate<00:02:24.709> so<00:02:25.709> let's<00:02:25.860> deal<00:02:26.099> with<00:02:26.190> 58<00:02:26.760> 57<00:02:27.150> or

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019 
your skate so let's deal with 58 57 or

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:31.280 
your skate so let's deal with 58 57 or
59<00:02:28.470> but<00:02:29.340> I<00:02:29.370> here<00:02:29.579> I<00:02:29.610> have<00:02:29.730> pads<00:02:30.030> wheels<00:02:30.390> as<00:02:30.569> a<00:02:30.599> 55

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
59 but I here I have pads wheels as a 55

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.620 
59 but I here I have pads wheels as a 55
millimeter<00:02:31.650> and<00:02:32.209> this<00:02:33.209> is<00:02:33.360> going<00:02:33.480> to<00:02:33.540> be

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
millimeter and this is going to be

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.449 
millimeter and this is going to be
really<00:02:33.780> good<00:02:33.989> for<00:02:34.140> writing<00:02:34.290> flat<00:02:34.650> and<00:02:34.980> the

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
really good for writing flat and the

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:37.400 
really good for writing flat and the
reason<00:02:35.610> I<00:02:35.640> say<00:02:35.790> that<00:02:35.819> is<00:02:36.000> because<00:02:36.269> with<00:02:37.170> most

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
reason I say that is because with most

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.759 
reason I say that is because with most
frames<00:02:37.819> nowadays<00:02:38.819> at<00:02:38.940> least<00:02:39.140> putting<00:02:40.140> a<00:02:40.170> 57<00:02:40.680> or

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
frames nowadays at least putting a 57 or

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:43.400 
frames nowadays at least putting a 57 or
58<00:02:40.860> millimeter<00:02:41.340> in<00:02:41.700> a<00:02:42.150> flat<00:02:42.840> set<00:02:43.110> up<00:02:43.200> all<00:02:43.349> the

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
58 millimeter in a flat set up all the

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:44.869 
58 millimeter in a flat set up all the
way<00:02:43.440> across<00:02:43.709> might<00:02:44.129> not<00:02:44.310> fit<00:02:44.549> all<00:02:44.760> the<00:02:44.849> way

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:44.879 
way across might not fit all the way

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:46.850 
way across might not fit all the way
through<00:02:45.090> the<00:02:45.180> frame<00:02:45.390> so<00:02:46.200> it's<00:02:46.319> usually<00:02:46.440> better

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
through the frame so it's usually better

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.229 
through the frame so it's usually better
just<00:02:47.129> to<00:02:47.190> go<00:02:47.310> for<00:02:47.459> a<00:02:47.519> smaller<00:02:47.760> wheel<00:02:48.000> just<00:02:48.120> to

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
just to go for a smaller wheel just to

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.330 
just to go for a smaller wheel just to
make<00:02:48.390> sure<00:02:48.420> but<00:02:49.260> also<00:02:49.440> it's<00:02:49.799> kind<00:02:49.950> of<00:02:50.069> gives

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
make sure but also it's kind of gives

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.729 
make sure but also it's kind of gives
you<00:02:50.370> a<00:02:50.430> more<00:02:50.640> of<00:02:50.700> a<00:02:50.760> low<00:02:50.940> profile<00:02:51.420> and<00:02:51.720> with<00:02:52.620> all

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
you a more of a low profile and with all

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:53.780 
you a more of a low profile and with all
four<00:02:52.950> wheels<00:02:53.069> kind<00:02:53.190> of<00:02:53.340> sitting<00:02:53.489> lower<00:02:53.640> to<00:02:53.730> the

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
four wheels kind of sitting lower to the

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.789 
four wheels kind of sitting lower to the
ground<00:02:53.819> a<00:02:54.209> little<00:02:54.390> more<00:02:54.569> stable<00:02:54.810> and<00:02:55.200> you're

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
ground a little more stable and you're

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:57.589 
ground a little more stable and you're
going<00:02:55.920> to<00:02:55.950> get<00:02:56.040> a<00:02:56.099> lot<00:02:56.250> more<00:02:56.280> speed<00:02:56.640> out<00:02:56.700> of<00:02:57.000> the

00:02:57.589 --> 00:02:57.599 
going to get a lot more speed out of the

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:59.930 
going to get a lot more speed out of the
flat<00:02:57.810> settled<00:02:58.140> like<00:02:58.230> that<00:02:58.410> so<00:02:58.980> this<00:02:59.579> is<00:02:59.670> a<00:02:59.730> pass

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
flat settled like that so this is a pass

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.930 
flat settled like that so this is a pass
wheel<00:03:00.209> 55<00:03:00.989> you<00:03:01.799> can<00:03:01.829> write<00:03:02.069> an<00:03:02.190> Taraka<00:03:02.609> even

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
wheel 55 you can write an Taraka even

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.370 
wheel 55 you can write an Taraka even
write<00:03:03.060> a<00:03:03.090> freestyle<00:03:03.480> as<00:03:03.600> well<00:03:03.840> but<00:03:04.079> it's<00:03:04.290> going

write a freestyle as well but it's going
to<00:03:04.470> be<00:03:04.530> better<00:03:04.739> for<00:03:04.859> writing<00:03:05.280> flat<00:03:05.519> so<00:03:06.180> if

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
to be better for writing flat so if

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:07.910 
to be better for writing flat so if
you've<00:03:06.329> got<00:03:06.420> a<00:03:06.450> flat<00:03:06.660> set<00:03:06.900> up<00:03:07.049> you<00:03:07.680> want<00:03:07.769> to
