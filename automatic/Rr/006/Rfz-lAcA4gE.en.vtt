going to then start on the second note
of<00:02:12.070> the<00:02:12.160> pattern<00:02:12.490> and<00:02:12.640> play<00:02:12.790> up<00:02:13.000> three<00:02:13.240> notes

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
of the pattern and play up three notes

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.660 
of the pattern and play up three notes
from<00:02:13.540> there

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
from there

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.330 
from there
I'm<00:02:16.240> going<00:02:16.360> to<00:02:16.420> play<00:02:16.630> up<00:02:16.920> three<00:02:17.920> notes<00:02:18.099> from

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
I'm going to play up three notes from

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.059 
I'm going to play up three notes from
the<00:02:18.400> third<00:02:18.700> note<00:02:18.989> I<00:02:19.989> kind<00:02:20.170> of<00:02:20.530> think<00:02:20.739> of<00:02:20.890> this

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
the third note I kind of think of this

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:23.339 
the third note I kind of think of this
as<00:02:21.250> a<00:02:21.700> pattern<00:02:22.120> you<00:02:22.390> might<00:02:22.540> think<00:02:22.750> of<00:02:22.900> it<00:02:22.989> as<00:02:23.110> up

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:23.349 
as a pattern you might think of it as up

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:30.150 
as a pattern you might think of it as up
three<00:02:24.599> back<00:02:25.599> one<00:02:25.930> of<00:02:27.120> three<00:02:28.530> back<00:02:29.530> one<00:02:29.860> and

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
three back one of three back one and

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.300 
three back one of three back one and
start<00:02:30.430> there<00:02:30.670> and<00:02:30.700> go<00:02:30.819> up<00:02:30.970> three<00:02:31.209> from<00:02:31.360> there

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
start there and go up three from there

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.520 
start there and go up three from there
back<00:02:33.310> one<00:02:33.670> from<00:02:33.880> there<00:02:34.060> and<00:02:34.120> you<00:02:35.080> go<00:02:35.200> up<00:02:35.230> three

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
back one from there and you go up three

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.220 
back one from there and you go up three
from<00:02:35.680> there

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:49.380 

you

to play lead guitar a lot of times
people<00:03:10.010> learn<00:03:10.340> scale<00:03:10.640> patterns<00:03:11.000> which<00:03:11.420> you

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:11.570 
people learn scale patterns which you

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:14.320 
people learn scale patterns which you
have<00:03:11.780> to<00:03:12.020> do<00:03:12.430> but<00:03:13.430> then<00:03:13.580> when<00:03:13.700> they<00:03:13.790> try<00:03:13.970> to<00:03:14.030> do

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:15.800 
something with them they always come out

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.190 
something with them they always come out
sounding<00:03:16.040> like<00:03:16.340> scales<00:03:16.790> and<00:03:17.090> exercise<00:03:17.900> like

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
sounding like scales and exercise like

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.290 
sounding like scales and exercise like

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
going to start with that open D playing

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.110 
going to start with that open D playing
e<00:04:05.060> the<00:04:06.060> second<00:04:06.450> fret<00:04:06.600> and<00:04:06.870> then<00:04:06.930> back<00:04:07.170> to<00:04:07.350> knee

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120 
e the second fret and then back to knee

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.670 
e the second fret and then back to knee
then<00:04:09.120> i'm<00:04:09.240> going<00:04:09.390> to<00:04:09.510> move<00:04:09.780> up<00:04:09.990> one<00:04:10.260> note<00:04:10.530> in

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
then i'm going to move up one note in

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.110 
then i'm going to move up one note in
the<00:04:10.740> pattern<00:04:11.100> so<00:04:11.190> i'm<00:04:11.280> going<00:04:11.370> to<00:04:11.430> start<00:04:11.760> on<00:04:11.910> e

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
the pattern so i'm going to start on e

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:19.160 
the pattern so i'm going to start on e
and<00:04:12.330> play<00:04:12.630> e<00:04:12.900> f<00:04:13.260> e<00:04:14.960> and<00:04:15.960> then<00:04:16.200> f<00:04:16.500> g<00:04:16.950> f<00:04:17.750> mm-hmm<00:04:18.750> so

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:19.170 
and play e f e and then f g f mm-hmm so

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:36.250 
and play e f e and then f g f mm-hmm so
on<00:04:19.350> off<00:04:19.530> the<00:04:19.650> scale

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:36.260 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.730 

you
