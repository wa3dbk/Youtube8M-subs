00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
each individual piece is why you get the

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.510 
each individual piece is why you get the
face<00:01:41.970> hole<00:01:44.810> just<00:01:45.810> kinda<00:01:46.320> like<00:01:46.439> a<00:01:46.530> school<00:01:46.829> and

get<00:01:47.790> this<00:01:47.970> energy<00:01:48.540> when<00:01:48.780> looking<00:01:49.140> dingy<00:01:49.380> and

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:51.049 
get this energy when looking dingy and

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:58.700 
get this energy when looking dingy and
you<00:01:52.049> get<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:53.240> diffusion<00:01:54.240> wheel<00:01:57.259> and<00:01:58.259> then<00:01:58.560> you

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
you get the diffusion wheel and then you

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.410 
you get the diffusion wheel and then you
get<00:01:58.860> this<00:01:59.070> piece<00:01:59.340> which<00:01:59.549> holds<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.090> day

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
get this piece which holds the day

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:06.020 
get this piece which holds the day
together<00:02:00.659> and<00:02:01.219> the<00:02:02.219> spin<00:02:02.520> track<00:02:02.850> and<00:02:05.030> the

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
together and the spin track and the

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.690 
together and the spin track and the
performance<00:02:06.719> of<00:02:06.869> our<00:02:07.049> connect<00:02:07.290> together

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
performance of our connect together

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.090 
performance of our connect together
order<00:02:08.700> five<00:02:08.940> pieces<00:02:09.179> just<00:02:09.539> like

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.100 
order five pieces just like

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.420 
order five pieces just like
a<00:02:10.480> metal<00:02:11.480> fusion<00:02:11.810> beyblade<00:02:12.290> or<00:02:12.620> or<00:02:13.010> metal

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
a metal fusion beyblade or or metal

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.450 
a metal fusion beyblade or or metal
fight<00:02:13.580> beyblade<00:02:14.560> so<00:02:15.560> the<00:02:15.710> assemble<00:02:16.160> that<00:02:16.310> you

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460 
fight beyblade so the assemble that you

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:25.150 
fight beyblade so the assemble that you
would<00:02:17.740> grab<00:02:18.740> the<00:02:20.290> spin<00:02:21.290> track<00:02:23.860> you<00:02:24.860> can<00:02:25.010> grab

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
would grab the spin track you can grab

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.780 
would grab the spin track you can grab
the<00:02:25.430> fusion<00:02:25.820> go<00:02:25.970> see<00:02:26.240> is<00:02:26.450> to<00:02:26.750> open<00:02:27.050> spot

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
the fusion go see is to open spot

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:40.530 
the fusion go see is to open spot
connect<00:02:28.790> them<00:02:28.940> unto<00:02:29.240> these<00:02:29.450> two<00:02:30.140> black<00:02:30.380> paps

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.370 

notice<00:02:41.540> following<00:02:42.050> a<00:02:42.170> long<00:02:42.440> way<00:02:42.620> yep<00:02:44.230> that's<00:02:45.230> a

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
notice following a long way yep that's a

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.250 
notice following a long way yep that's a
long<00:02:45.560> way<00:02:45.770> then<00:02:46.370> you<00:02:46.550> would<00:02:46.700> get<00:02:46.940> the<00:02:47.840> energy

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
long way then you would get the energy

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.480 
long way then you would get the energy
ring<00:02:48.460> and<00:02:49.460> your<00:02:49.610> two<00:02:49.880> pairs<00:02:50.180> here<00:02:51.130> and<00:02:52.130> connect

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:52.490 
ring and your two pairs here and connect

00:02:52.490 --> 00:03:00.100 
ring and your two pairs here and connect
into<00:02:52.880> these<00:02:53.150> two<00:02:53.390> holes<00:02:58.870> then<00:02:59.870> you<00:02:59.960> would

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
into these two holes then you would

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:19.180 
into these two holes then you would
screw<00:03:00.290> this<00:03:00.830> arm<00:03:01.690> taste<00:03:02.690> ball<00:03:02.930> in<00:03:03.170> here<00:03:13.360> and
