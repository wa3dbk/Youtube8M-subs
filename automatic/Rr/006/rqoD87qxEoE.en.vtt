00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:59.940

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:03.399
 I am a player I'm home online 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.110
 now I play low limits of univision and 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:08.860

 and a very big surprises without many 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.770
 we knew you more than anything 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.810
 social networks because I am a person 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.460
 very active you have a blog but of 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.740
 suddenly we find this news 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.390
 that the room number one in the world 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.860
 he names you as part of his last level 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.680
 that feels 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:29.620
 and I tell you I still do not fall this is it 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.540
 like when I told you before when one 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.070
 plays at home especially not able 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.840
 the notoriety of tournament sites 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.390
 that are always like in the first 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.830
 flat so suddenly to move from 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.630
 be all day at my house playing 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.570
 online to be here sitting comfortable 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.030
 speaking is it something that I still do not fall 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:48.850
 how did you start in this poker 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:51.880
 start the truth in 2011 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.470
 I played recreationally mind or for me 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.390
 It was a hobby poker after 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.880
 work I had my career without function 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.490
 of management companies had a good 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.979
 work let's say and I just play but 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.200
 after after work after the 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:07.720
 night with the weekend until 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.070
 then I started last year was when 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.680
 I started taking it a little more in 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:13.600
 serious I started to study and good came the 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.070
 point as it happens to us a lot that we give ourselves 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.069
 account that we are gaining more in the 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:19.140
 poker that our work 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:24.510
 and well I decided to take the leap organization 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:27.510
 and I work and I'm here and I 'm still playing 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.189
 look at my goal of this mind I want 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.980
 learn as much as you can 

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:34.739
 I am a very competitive person always 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.599
 I was and for me it is above all 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:38.879
 challenge of good now I'm playing 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:41.159
 1100 but someday be when I'm this 

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:43.530
 xxi and why not high stakes some day or 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:46.230
 be the most important thing to me is 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.569
 learn and improve my game and be a 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:51.500
 best player be that challenge why 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:54.359
 do you think that pokerstars chose I think that 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.670
 it was mainly my blog the great 

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:58.980
 why I am also like very 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.930
 present on twitter on facebook but 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.659
 especially the fact of having started a 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:06.780
 blog and have given enough follow-up 

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:08.430
 to write in English yes and good and everything 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.209
 that's very very active in networks 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.310
 social 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.590
 I think it makes me a good ambassador in 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.510
 the game you feel responsibility for 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.489
 represent little more stars taking in 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.739
 note that you are entering a paper 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:21.930
 that a lot of players would like to have 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:25.230
 that they can not and that this time it's your turn 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.700
 If that's how it feels, I'm like 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.840
 starting to feel quite a bit of pressure 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.239
 big 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.640
 but hey I hope to live up to 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:35.129
 expectations and give my best or 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:38.760
 be my goal now is to be a good 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:40.110
 woman now to be yes good and 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.700
 represent above all all 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:43.620
 low-limit players or those 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.569
 players who are just starting 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.940
 that's also relatively a 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:49.920
 new player so she was playing 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:53.250
 to not limit 2 I would tell you a year ago and 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.900
 medium and I could upload and well that fact of 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.910
 represent all the players that 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.250
 they are in low limits learning and 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:02.130
 struggling and they want to climb so 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:05.040
 that's like my biggest goal good 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:08.489
 wave that dreams of heaven 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:10.049
 look now go to day 2 of the beat law 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:12.180
 and so I would tell you that my dream 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:15.689
 immediate would make a good result 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:18.150
 here this tournament and then in the future I think 

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:21.570
 that what I already told you what I want 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:24.570
 is to learn above all to learn the game 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:26.759
 be a good player seriously for me 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:28.289
 the study is very important or it was dedicated 

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:31.259
 a lot of time to study to look 

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:34.020
 videos to read books interests me a lot 

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:35.699
 study the theory of the game so my 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:37.620
 goal is that achieve a great 

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:39.389
 understanding of the game and go up to 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.919
 level of players that you are running to 

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:42.810
 how unequal he looks with whom I am 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:44.160
 I'm playing clapping palms and over the 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.470
 I'm representing them now too 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:50.400
 good yesterday share a table with fabian 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:52.349
 ortiz we had a couple of sparks from there 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:55.139
 we gave each other a pair of hands found 

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:58.110
 so it was a surprise 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:05:00.330
 just walk with him a champion 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:02.550
 of the equity so that was like 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:04.680
 quite pretty good and above all 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:07.349
 is the mental calm of realized with him 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:10.260
 so if you feel comfortable in the 

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:12.650
 transfer from online to live 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:16.320
 this is just my second live tournament 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:18.240
 so I'm like pretty novice no 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:20.910
 I have capable 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.560
 in the tournament in the live game is 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:25.050
 super important the theme of the tels and 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:26.759
 all that playing online and more people 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:30.120
 it does not exist is something that I am 

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:33.210
 absolutely I am I have no idea 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:35.069
 thesis issues and all this but without 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:37.259
 But I think it also gives me a 

00:05:35.069 --> 00:05:38.910
 advantage of the fact that I'm used to 

00:05:37.259 --> 00:05:42.199
 me when online game can do 

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:44.759
 sessions would be 10 12 continuous hours 

00:05:42.199 --> 00:05:46.289
 multiple tablet I'm taking a bunch 

00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:48.750
 of decisions at the same time so 

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:50.580
 good is like that that training 

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:51.900
 I think it also helps me to be here 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:54.229

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:54.229

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:21.020
 I can not create what is happening is 

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:23.890
 like living a dream since it was made 

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:26.890
 the announcement to ring the cell phone so 

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:26.890
