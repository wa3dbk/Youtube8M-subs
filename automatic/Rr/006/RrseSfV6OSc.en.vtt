00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
it I think it's actually good that I

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.920 
it I think it's actually good that I
went<00:02:29.650> through<00:02:29.739> and<00:02:30.270> played<00:02:31.270> black<00:02:31.510> ops<00:02:31.690> and

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
don't know it's a very time-consuming

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:58.140

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
from doing that with black ops and I can

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:03.660 
from doing that with black ops and I can
apply<00:03:02.470> whatever<00:03:02.800> I<00:03:02.980> learned<00:03:03.250> there<00:03:03.430> to

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:52.860 
focus on my 1v1 and my you know my 1v1
ladder<00:03:48.910> strategy<00:03:50.160> and<00:03:51.480> when<00:03:52.480> you're<00:03:52.630> training

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
ladder strategy and when you're training

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.160 
ladder strategy and when you're training
for<00:03:53.049> that<00:03:53.260> it<00:03:53.620> you<00:03:54.010> know<00:03:54.359> it<00:03:55.359> can<00:03:55.600> get<00:03:55.870> a<00:03:55.930> little

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.170 
for that it you know it can get a little

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.020 
for that it you know it can get a little
boring<00:03:56.500> because<00:03:56.739> when<00:03:56.980> you<00:03:57.070> play<00:03:57.340> you<00:03:57.700> really

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
boring because when you play you really

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.780 
boring because when you play you really
just<00:03:58.180> want<00:03:58.269> to<00:03:58.450> perfect<00:03:59.079> a<00:03:59.560> build<00:04:00.130> order<00:04:00.489> and

just want to perfect a build order and
when<00:04:00.940> you<00:04:01.030> do<00:04:01.209> that<00:04:01.980> you're<00:04:02.980> constantly<00:04:03.519> doing

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:03.820 
when you do that you're constantly doing

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:05.729 
when you do that you're constantly doing
the<00:04:04.000> same<00:04:04.180> build<00:04:04.450> over<00:04:04.720> quarter<00:04:05.140> over<00:04:05.590> and

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:05.739 
the same build over quarter over and
