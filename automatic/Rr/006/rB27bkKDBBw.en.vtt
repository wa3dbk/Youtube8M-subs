a l85a2 with heavy barrel and as a
control<00:00:19.020> and<00:00:19.140> this<00:00:19.199> could<00:00:19.380> go<00:00:19.470> full<00:00:19.650> auto<00:00:19.710> here

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
control and this could go full auto here

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.710 
control and this could go full auto here
to<00:00:20.279> show<00:00:20.460> you<00:00:20.520> just<00:00:20.820> why<00:00:21.240> you<00:00:21.270> don't<00:00:21.570> really

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
to show you just why you don't really

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.179 
to show you just why you don't really
want<00:00:21.990> to<00:00:22.050> go<00:00:22.170> full<00:00:22.350> auto<00:00:22.410> in<00:00:22.740> this<00:00:22.859> game<00:00:23.070> and

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
want to go full auto in this game and

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.230 
want to go full auto in this game and
this<00:00:23.279> is<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.460> most<00:00:23.609> accurate<00:00:23.850> gun<00:00:24.119> in<00:00:24.180> the

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
this is the most accurate gun in the

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.359 
this is the most accurate gun in the
game<00:00:24.420> by<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.600> way<00:00:24.720> and<00:00:25.050> it<00:00:25.590> produces<00:00:25.980> a<00:00:26.039> spread

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
game by the way and it produces a spread

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:27.769 
game by the way and it produces a spread
like<00:00:26.550> that<00:00:26.760> I'd<00:00:26.910> say<00:00:26.939> probably<00:00:27.510> approximately

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
like that I'd say probably approximately

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.380 
like that I'd say probably approximately
50<00:00:28.439> 50<00:00:29.160> meters<00:00:29.429> right<00:00:29.670> there<00:00:29.910> this<00:00:30.269> is

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
50 50 meters right there this is

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:31.609 
50 50 meters right there this is
Northshore<00:00:30.810> canal<00:00:31.109> on<00:00:31.230> top<00:00:31.380> of<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:31.529> aircraft

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
carrier shooting at this big - you'll be

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.750 
carrier shooting at this big - you'll be
able<00:00:34.350> to<00:00:34.469> see<00:00:34.590> it<00:00:34.920> kind<00:00:35.160> of<00:00:35.219> again<00:00:35.399> the

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
able to see it kind of again the

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.490 
able to see it kind of again the
differences<00:00:36.270> here<00:00:36.480> between<00:00:36.510> -<00:00:37.050> as<00:00:37.170> I<00:00:37.290> shoot

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
differences here between - as I shoot

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.290 
differences here between - as I shoot
from<00:00:37.649> left<00:00:37.920> to<00:00:37.980> right<00:00:38.219> but<00:00:38.850> pretty<00:00:39.090> tight

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
from left to right but pretty tight

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.450 
from left to right but pretty tight
spread<00:00:39.690> there<00:00:39.930> with<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.290> heavy<00:00:40.649> barrel<00:00:40.920> and

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
spread there with the heavy barrel and

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.770 
spread there with the heavy barrel and
I'll<00:00:41.670> just<00:00:41.850> do<00:00:42.000> it<00:00:42.030> one<00:00:42.149> more<00:00:42.239> time<00:00:42.360> here<00:00:42.690> to

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
I'll just do it one more time here to

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.740 
I'll just do it one more time here to
demonstrate<00:00:42.960> again<00:00:43.670> kind<00:00:44.670> of<00:00:44.760> burst<00:00:45.210> violent

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
demonstrate again kind of burst violent

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.500 
demonstrate again kind of burst violent
burst<00:00:46.110> firing<00:00:46.410> /<00:00:46.980> automatic<00:00:47.700> semi-automatic

burst firing / automatic semi-automatic

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:49.819 
burst firing / automatic semi-automatic
that's<00:00:49.140> kind<00:00:49.350> of<00:00:49.379> trying<00:00:49.590> to<00:00:49.649> use<00:00:49.800> a

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
that's kind of trying to use a

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.560 
that's kind of trying to use a
consistent<00:00:50.340> fire<00:00:50.789> rate<00:00:51.000> kind<00:00:51.360> of<00:00:51.420> what<00:00:51.539> I

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
consistent fire rate kind of what I

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.600 
consistent fire rate kind of what I
would<00:00:51.750> use<00:00:51.899> in<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.140> game<00:00:52.320> maybe<00:00:53.250> just<00:00:53.520> a

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
would use in the game maybe just a

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.100 
would use in the game maybe just a
little<00:00:53.640> bit<00:00:53.940> slower<00:00:54.180> to<00:00:54.270> kind<00:00:54.570> of<00:00:54.600> demonstrate

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
little bit slower to kind of demonstrate

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.410 
little bit slower to kind of demonstrate
a<00:00:55.140> little<00:00:55.469> better<00:00:55.800> what<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.270> attachment<00:00:57.270> does

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
a little better what the attachment does

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.819 
a little better what the attachment does
but<00:00:57.660> as<00:00:57.840> you<00:00:57.930> can<00:00:57.989> clearly<00:00:58.379> see<00:00:58.530> with<00:00:58.770> the

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
but as you can clearly see with the

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.549 
but as you can clearly see with the
heavy<00:00:59.010> barrel<00:00:59.039> a<00:00:59.430> little<00:00:59.460> 85<00:01:00.000> a<00:01:00.180> -<00:01:00.559> extremely

what<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.930> advantage<00:01:07.260> of<00:01:07.380> having<00:01:07.500> a<00:01:07.740> grip

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
what the advantage of having a grip

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.820 
what the advantage of having a grip
now<00:01:09.420> with<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.689> flash<00:01:09.900> suppressor<00:01:10.439> as<00:01:10.530> you<00:01:10.650> can

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
now with the flash suppressor as you can

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.890 
now with the flash suppressor as you can
see<00:01:11.040> at<00:01:11.189> 50<00:01:11.490> meters<00:01:11.640> again<00:01:12.000> approximate<00:01:12.720> this

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
see at 50 meters again approximate this

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.260 
see at 50 meters again approximate this
distance<00:01:13.460> considerable<00:01:14.460> amount<00:01:14.790> of<00:01:14.850> left<00:01:15.119> and

right hits at long range that's really

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.850 
right hits at long range that's really

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
gonna suffer with you and you're gonna

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.789 
gonna suffer with you and you're gonna
lose<00:01:20.070> headshots<00:01:20.869> if<00:01:21.869> I<00:01:22.049> had<00:01:22.170> a<00:01:22.200> pick<00:01:22.409> I'd<00:01:22.590> pick

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
lose headshots if I had a pick I'd pick

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.130 
lose headshots if I had a pick I'd pick
the<00:01:22.920> heavy<00:01:23.100> barrel<00:01:23.310> hands<00:01:23.640> down<00:01:23.880> over<00:01:24.210> on<00:01:24.930> the

the heavy barrel hands down over on the

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.219 
the heavy barrel hands down over on the
l85a2<00:01:25.799> so<00:01:26.460> I'd<00:01:26.549> say<00:01:26.759> heavy<00:01:27.119> barrel<00:01:27.540> on<00:01:27.810> that

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
l85a2 so I'd say heavy barrel on that

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.140 
l85a2 so I'd say heavy barrel on that

you got two separate clips but with the

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.600 
you got two separate clips but with the
heavy<00:02:15.510> barrel<00:02:15.720> here<00:02:16.190> kinda<00:02:17.190> looks<00:02:17.310> like<00:02:17.400> the

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
heavy barrel here kinda looks like the

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.880 
heavy barrel here kinda looks like the
g3<00:02:18.120> with<00:02:18.270> the<00:02:18.360> heavy<00:02:18.510> barrel<00:02:18.690> doesn't<00:02:19.020> it

try<00:02:20.340> the<00:02:20.400> flash<00:02:20.700> suppressor<00:02:21.270> and<00:02:21.540> again<00:02:21.930> I'm

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
try the flash suppressor and again I'm

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.740 
try the flash suppressor and again I'm
not<00:02:22.200> sure<00:02:22.610> the<00:02:23.610> flash<00:02:23.819> suppressor<00:02:24.180> reduces

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
not sure the flash suppressor reduces

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.680 
not sure the flash suppressor reduces
recoil<00:02:24.959> guys<00:02:25.410> now<00:02:26.160> and<00:02:26.490> you<00:02:27.300> don't<00:02:27.420> have<00:02:27.630> a

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
recoil guys now and you don't have a

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.630 
recoil guys now and you don't have a
penalty<00:02:28.170> with<00:02:28.380> that<00:02:28.530> full<00:02:28.860> fully<00:02:29.160> automatic

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
penalty with that full fully automatic

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.180 
penalty with that full fully automatic

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
fire with the flash suppressor so it's

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.070 
fire with the flash suppressor so it's
up<00:02:32.400> to<00:02:32.580> you<00:02:32.700> decide<00:02:32.880> what<00:02:33.270> you<00:02:33.390> want<00:02:33.420> to<00:02:33.660> do

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
up to you decide what you want to do

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.720 
up to you decide what you want to do
they've<00:02:34.380> also<00:02:34.650> reduced<00:02:34.980> a<00:02:35.100> recoil<00:02:35.489> with<00:02:35.640> the

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
they've also reduced a recoil with the

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.160 
they've also reduced a recoil with the
heavy<00:02:35.910> barrel<00:02:35.970> as<00:02:36.270> you<00:02:36.360> can<00:02:36.510> see<00:02:36.660> here<00:02:36.900> it

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
heavy barrel as you can see here it

heavy barrel as you can see here it
doesn't<00:02:37.530> it<00:02:37.709> looks<00:02:37.890> pretty<00:02:38.130> bad<00:02:38.340> if<00:02:38.520> he<00:02:38.610> asked

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
a little you know approximate this would

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.930 
a little you know approximate this would
be<00:02:45.209> about<00:02:45.330> 50<00:02:45.690> meters<00:02:46.580> more<00:02:47.580> about<00:02:47.820> the

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
something like that I'm just again this

is<00:03:12.840> all<00:03:12.989> relative<00:03:13.470> guys<00:03:13.650> but<00:03:13.980> you'll<00:03:14.940> be<00:03:15.060> able

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
is all relative guys but you'll be able

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.280 
is all relative guys but you'll be able
to<00:03:15.239> see<00:03:15.300> the<00:03:15.420> pattern<00:03:15.690> spread<00:03:15.930> here<00:03:16.080> that's

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
to see the pattern spread here that's

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.990 
to see the pattern spread here that's
the<00:03:16.410> point<00:03:16.650> this<00:03:16.920> is<00:03:16.980> I'm<00:03:17.190> just<00:03:17.220> kind<00:03:17.970> of

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
the point this is I'm just kind of

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.550 
the point this is I'm just kind of
guesstimate<00:03:18.390> an<00:03:18.480> average<00:03:18.840> distance<00:03:19.320> here

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
guesstimate an average distance here

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.170 
guesstimate an average distance here
with<00:03:19.709> the<00:03:19.860> you<00:03:19.980> know<00:03:20.100> engagement<00:03:20.850> so<00:03:20.910> it<00:03:21.000> looks

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
with the you know engagement so it looks

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.270 
with the you know engagement so it looks
up<00:03:21.329> nearly<00:03:21.630> identical<00:03:21.780> with<00:03:22.290> other<00:03:22.470> ones<00:03:22.769> so<00:03:23.040> I

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
up nearly identical with other ones so I

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.729 
up nearly identical with other ones so I
may<00:03:24.000> take<00:03:24.239> the<00:03:24.420> added<00:03:24.630> benefit<00:03:25.290> of<00:03:25.320> longer

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
may take the added benefit of longer

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:28.100 
may take the added benefit of longer

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
suppressor supposed to reduce recoil I

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.410 
suppressor supposed to reduce recoil I
feel<00:04:49.830> like<00:04:49.980> it<00:04:50.160> had<00:04:50.250> a<00:04:50.280> lot<00:04:50.520> more<00:04:50.550> recoil<00:04:51.120> there

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:51.420 
feel like it had a lot more recoil there

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:54.920

suppressor see if maybe they've kind of

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:07.670 
suppressor see if maybe they've kind of
mitigated<00:05:06.510> the<00:05:06.630> recoil<00:05:07.050> like<00:05:07.200> it<00:05:07.350> says<00:05:07.560> it

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 
mitigated the recoil like it says it

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.860 
mitigated the recoil like it says it
does<00:05:07.830> and<00:05:08.010> again<00:05:08.220> this<00:05:08.370> is<00:05:08.520> all<00:05:08.730> based<00:05:09.600> on
