00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.769 

that's<00:00:20.750> where<00:00:20.990> it<00:00:21.109> broke<00:00:22.269> and<00:00:23.269> all<00:00:23.329> the<00:00:23.539> pieces

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:23.779 
that's where it broke and all the pieces

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:32.290 
that's where it broke and all the pieces
went<00:00:24.169> flying<00:00:24.439> and<00:00:30.460> just<00:00:31.460> gonna<00:00:31.669> turn<00:00:31.880> my<00:00:31.939> light

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:32.300 
went flying and just gonna turn my light

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.640 
went flying and just gonna turn my light
on<00:00:32.329> so<00:00:32.689> you<00:00:32.809> can<00:00:32.989> see<00:00:33.019> here<00:00:35.500> there's<00:00:36.500> my

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:36.650 
on so you can see here there's my

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.210 
on so you can see here there's my
transfer<00:00:37.129> case<00:00:37.339> now<00:00:38.739> just<00:00:39.739> that<00:00:39.920> little<00:00:40.070> bit

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:40.220 
transfer case now just that little bit

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.149 
transfer case now just that little bit
of<00:00:40.339> torque<00:00:40.670> that<00:00:40.879> I<00:00:40.940> did<00:00:41.239> there<00:00:41.949> should<00:00:42.949> not

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:43.159 
of torque that I did there should not

00:00:43.159 --> 00:00:45.399 
of torque that I did there should not
have<00:00:43.220> been<00:00:43.430> enough<00:00:43.820> to<00:00:44.000> break<00:00:44.210> this<00:00:44.899> transfer

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:45.409 
have been enough to break this transfer

00:00:45.409 --> 00:00:51.700 
have been enough to break this transfer
case<00:00:45.620> and<00:00:47.170> I<00:00:49.510> would<00:00:50.510> assume<00:00:50.659> that<00:00:50.870> it<00:00:51.590> was

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
case and I would assume that it was

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.670 
case and I would assume that it was
probably<00:00:52.219> already<00:00:52.370> starting<00:00:52.969> to<00:00:53.680> break

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680 
probably already starting to break

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.040 
probably already starting to break
somewhere<00:00:55.100> I<00:00:55.160> must<00:00:55.489> have<00:00:55.660> possibly<00:00:56.660> cracked

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 
somewhere I must have possibly cracked

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.160 
somewhere I must have possibly cracked
it<00:00:57.230> or<00:00:57.350> something<00:00:57.649> over<00:00:57.769> at<00:00:58.010> gopher<00:00:58.519> dunes<00:00:59.170> but

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
it or something over at gopher dunes but

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:01.419 
it or something over at gopher dunes but
that<00:01:00.350> little<00:01:00.620> bit<00:01:00.710> of<00:01:00.739> torque<00:01:01.039> should<00:01:01.070> not

00:01:01.419 --> 00:01:01.429 
that little bit of torque should not

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:04.479 
that little bit of torque should not
have<00:01:02.230> caused<00:01:03.230> this<00:01:03.440> to<00:01:03.620> break<00:01:03.800> wide<00:01:04.009> open<00:01:04.339> like

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
have caused this to break wide open like

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.510 
have caused this to break wide open like
that<00:01:04.519> and<00:01:05.440> I<00:01:06.440> thought<00:01:06.619> I<00:01:06.679> heard<00:01:06.920> some<00:01:07.130> clunking

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
that and I thought I heard some clunking

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.510 
that and I thought I heard some clunking
already<00:01:07.850> and<00:01:08.119> I<00:01:08.950> couldn't<00:01:09.950> really<00:01:10.100> tell<00:01:10.340> where

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
already and I couldn't really tell where

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.060 
already and I couldn't really tell where
it<00:01:10.610> was<00:01:10.670> coming<00:01:10.759> from<00:01:11.060> so<00:01:11.479> I<00:01:11.960> think<00:01:12.890> it's<00:01:13.009> a

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
it was coming from so I think it's a

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:14.919 
it was coming from so I think it's a
good<00:01:13.220> thing<00:01:13.399> I<00:01:13.490> broke<00:01:13.700> it<00:01:13.850> here<00:01:14.030> before<00:01:14.420> I<00:01:14.450> got

00:01:14.919 --> 00:01:14.929 
good thing I broke it here before I got

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:16.480 
good thing I broke it here before I got
it<00:01:15.110> out<00:01:15.229> to<00:01:15.259> go<00:01:15.500> for<00:01:15.679> dunes<00:01:15.890> and<00:01:16.130> then<00:01:16.250> have<00:01:16.460> a

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
it out to go for dunes and then have a

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.469 
it out to go for dunes and then have a
fly<00:01:16.880> apart<00:01:17.270> in<00:01:17.770> mud<00:01:18.770> hole<00:01:18.950> somewhere<00:01:19.429> and<00:01:19.700> not

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:20.479 
fly apart in mud hole somewhere and not

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:25.059 
fly apart in mud hole somewhere and not
be<00:01:20.630> able<00:01:20.750> to<00:01:20.810> do<00:01:20.990> anything<00:01:21.229> with<00:01:21.440> it<00:01:21.470> so<00:01:24.069> yeah

00:01:25.059 --> 00:01:25.069 
be able to do anything with it so yeah

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:29.740 
be able to do anything with it so yeah
it's<00:01:25.160> got<00:01:25.340> another<00:01:25.520> job<00:01:25.759> to<00:01:25.940> do<00:01:28.630> there's<00:01:29.630> a

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
it's got another job to do there's a

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.120 
it's got another job to do there's a
piece<00:01:29.899> of<00:01:30.020> my<00:01:30.110> transfer<00:01:30.530> case<00:01:30.709> right<00:01:30.920> there

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
piece of my transfer case right there

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.899 
piece of my transfer case right there
too

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:34.909 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:43.179 

hmm<00:01:38.079> nice<00:01:39.969> so<00:01:40.969> anyway<00:01:41.270> I<00:01:41.799> got<00:01:42.799> the<00:01:42.890> transfer

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:43.189 
hmm nice so anyway I got the transfer

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:46.569 
hmm nice so anyway I got the transfer
case<00:01:43.430> off<00:01:43.700> and<00:01:44.740> you<00:01:45.740> see<00:01:45.950> the<00:01:46.070> damage<00:01:46.250> that<00:01:46.399> I

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:46.579 
case off and you see the damage that I

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:49.350 
case off and you see the damage that I
did<00:01:46.820> here<00:01:47.030> from<00:01:47.329> the<00:01:47.420> inside<00:01:47.780> there's<00:01:48.500> a

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 
did here from the inside there's a

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.149 
did here from the inside there's a
splines<00:01:50.360> where<00:01:50.600> the<00:01:50.719> gear<00:01:50.899> goes<00:01:51.170> on<00:01:51.409> and<00:01:51.710> if

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 
splines where the gear goes on and if

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:54.090 
splines where the gear goes on and if
you<00:01:52.250> look<00:01:52.429> down<00:01:52.610> in<00:01:52.670> there<00:01:52.970> farther<00:01:53.329> there's

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
you look down in there farther there's

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.760 
you look down in there farther there's
pieces<00:01:55.100> of<00:01:55.399> the<00:01:55.490> gear<00:01:55.700> still<00:01:56.289> stuck<00:01:57.289> back<00:01:57.319> in

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
pieces of the gear still stuck back in

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:06.219 
pieces of the gear still stuck back in
behind<00:02:03.340> just<00:02:04.340> completely<00:02:04.759> off<00:02:05.020> smash<00:02:06.020> the

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
behind just completely off smash the

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:10.029 
behind just completely off smash the
bottom<00:02:06.530> right<00:02:06.679> out<00:02:06.860> of<00:02:06.979> it<00:02:08.709> go<00:02:09.709> to<00:02:09.769> the<00:02:09.920> other

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
bottom right out of it go to the other

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.539 
bottom right out of it go to the other
end

00:02:12.539 --> 00:02:12.549 

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:20.309 

basically<00:02:13.549> bust<00:02:13.880> up<00:02:14.060> the<00:02:14.150> whole<00:02:14.299> top<00:02:14.569> o<00:02:14.750> the

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:28.920 

top<00:02:21.319> side<00:02:21.590> of<00:02:21.739> it<00:02:26.530> yeah

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
top side of it yeah

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.910 
top side of it yeah
move<00:02:29.930> up<00:02:30.079> good<00:02:30.319> anyway<00:02:32.530> and<00:02:33.530> those<00:02:33.680> are<00:02:33.829> the

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
move up good anyway and those are the

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:50.370 
move up good anyway and those are the
pieces<00:02:34.400> I<00:02:34.700> pulled<00:02:34.910> out<00:02:35.000> from<00:02:35.150> under<00:02:35.420> the<00:02:35.540> truck

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:03:08.349 

piece<00:02:51.380> of<00:02:51.530> my<00:02:51.620> gear<00:02:55.299> my<00:02:56.299> teeth<00:02:59.530> my<00:03:00.530> teeth<00:03:07.359> -

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:08.359 
piece of my gear my teeth my teeth -

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:12.069 
piece of my gear my teeth my teeth -
teeth<00:03:09.940> there's<00:03:10.940> more<00:03:11.359> teeth<00:03:11.600> than<00:03:11.630> lay<00:03:11.930> in

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:12.079 
teeth there's more teeth than lay in

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:15.970 
teeth there's more teeth than lay in
there<00:03:13.569> believe<00:03:14.569> that's<00:03:14.840> a<00:03:15.139> magnet<00:03:15.680> on<00:03:15.950> the

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
there believe that's a magnet on the

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:25.810 
there believe that's a magnet on the
inside<00:03:17.650> right<00:03:18.650> there<00:03:22.030> all<00:03:23.030> kinds<00:03:23.239> of<00:03:23.450> pieces
