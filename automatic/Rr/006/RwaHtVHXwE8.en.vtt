at<00:00:12.119> which<00:00:12.389> you'll<00:00:12.629> see<00:00:12.840> on<00:00:13.080> your<00:00:13.410> left<00:00:13.740> running

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
at which you'll see on your left running

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:15.799 
at which you'll see on your left running
out<00:00:14.400> of<00:00:14.430> samsung<00:00:14.879> focus<00:00:15.119> to<00:00:15.510> your<00:00:15.629> right

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
out of samsung focus to your right

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.260 
out of samsung focus to your right
another<00:00:16.680> focus<00:00:16.920> running<00:00:17.369> no<00:00:17.520> dough<00:00:17.580> so<00:00:18.180> we've

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
another focus running no dough so we've

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.640 
another focus running no dough so we've
got<00:00:18.359> a<00:00:18.390> great<00:00:18.570> comparison<00:00:18.930> here<00:00:19.290> now<00:00:19.530> we're

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
got a great comparison here now we're

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.130 
got a great comparison here now we're
going<00:00:19.740> to<00:00:19.800> take<00:00:19.890> a<00:00:19.980> look<00:00:20.100> at<00:00:20.220> AE<00:00:20.430> 9<00:00:20.910> and<00:00:21.300> see<00:00:21.990> how

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
going to take a look at AE 9 and see how

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.960 
going to take a look at AE 9 and see how
much<00:00:22.380> faster<00:00:22.680> and<00:00:22.950> better<00:00:23.160> that<00:00:23.520> is<00:00:23.670> in<00:00:23.910> our

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
much faster and better that is in our

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.580 
much faster and better that is in our
current<00:00:24.360> version<00:00:24.720> mind<00:00:25.200> you<00:00:25.350> this<00:00:25.530> is

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
current version mind you this is

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.040 
current version mind you this is
hardware<00:00:26.070> accelerated<00:00:26.610> so<00:00:26.910> in<00:00:27.120> theory<00:00:27.870> it

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
hardware accelerated so in theory it

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.600 
hardware accelerated so in theory it
should<00:00:28.080> be<00:00:28.380> a<00:00:28.440> big<00:00:28.680> difference<00:00:29.130> we're<00:00:29.460> going

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:29.610 
should be a big difference we're going

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:32.330 
should be a big difference we're going
to<00:00:29.670> launch<00:00:29.900> WPCentral<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:31.560> full<00:00:31.830> site<00:00:32.099> which

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
to launch WPCentral the full site which

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.979 
to launch WPCentral the full site which
is<00:00:32.460> pretty<00:00:32.579> graphic<00:00:33.000> intensive<00:00:33.270> and<00:00:33.719> normally

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
is pretty graphic intensive and normally

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.080 
is pretty graphic intensive and normally
takes<00:00:34.230> a<00:00:34.350> while<00:00:34.500> to<00:00:34.650> load<00:00:34.829> and<00:00:35.550> we'll<00:00:35.790> see<00:00:35.970> the

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
takes a while to load and we'll see the

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.360 
takes a while to load and we'll see the
difference<00:00:36.480> here<00:00:39.560> and<00:00:40.560> i<00:00:40.649> started<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.070> one<00:00:41.220> on

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
difference here and i started the one on

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.190 
difference here and i started the one on
the<00:00:41.489> left<00:00:41.940> just<00:00:42.120> by<00:00:42.329> a<00:00:42.360> second<00:00:42.690> earlier<00:00:42.960> but

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
the left just by a second earlier but

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.050 
the left just by a second earlier but
it's<00:00:43.770> not<00:00:44.010> going<00:00:44.130> to<00:00:44.220> matter<00:00:44.310> i<00:00:44.489> guarantee<00:00:44.910> you

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:45.060 
it's not going to matter i guarantee you

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:47.240 
it's not going to matter i guarantee you
because<00:00:45.329> we're<00:00:45.510> talking<00:00:46.100> pretty<00:00:47.100> big

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
because we're talking pretty big

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:57.069 
because we're talking pretty big
difference<00:00:47.670> here

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:57.079 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:58.720 

now<00:00:57.679> let<00:00:57.890> you<00:00:58.010> know<00:00:58.190> you<00:00:58.249> might<00:00:58.489> not<00:00:58.519> be<00:00:58.670> able

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
now let you know you might not be able

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:00.099 
now let you know you might not be able
to<00:00:58.820> see<00:00:58.999> the<00:00:59.120> bar<00:00:59.329> so<00:00:59.539> I'll<00:00:59.600> let<00:00:59.719> you<00:00:59.839> know<00:00:59.870> when

00:01:00.099 --> 00:01:00.109 
to see the bar so I'll let you know when

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:05.740 
to see the bar so I'll let you know when
they're<00:01:00.260> actually<00:01:00.559> finished<00:01:03.610> and<00:01:04.610> the<00:01:05.570> one<00:01:05.720> on

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
they're actually finished and the one on

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.710 
they're actually finished and the one on
the<00:01:05.899> left<00:01:06.049> just<00:01:06.200> finished<00:01:06.619> so<00:01:07.509> now<00:01:08.509> you<00:01:08.570> can

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
the left just finished so now you can

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.539 
the left just finished so now you can
start<00:01:08.899> your<00:01:09.049> countdown<00:01:09.350> clock<00:01:09.799> and<00:01:10.070> see<00:01:10.250> when

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:10.549 
start your countdown clock and see when

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:13.270 
start your countdown clock and see when
the<00:01:10.580> one<00:01:10.850> on<00:01:10.939> the<00:01:11.030> right<00:01:11.060> finishes<00:01:11.689> and<00:01:12.280> it's

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
the one on the right finishes and it's

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.639 
the one on the right finishes and it's
very<00:01:14.030> fast<00:01:14.390> I<00:01:14.630> mean<00:01:14.810> look<00:01:15.140> at<00:01:15.200> this<00:01:15.320> there's<00:01:15.530> no

00:01:15.639 --> 00:01:15.649 
very fast I mean look at this there's no

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:19.389 
very fast I mean look at this there's no
stuttering<00:01:16.130> or<00:01:16.310> anything<00:01:17.830> you<00:01:18.830> can<00:01:18.979> zoom<00:01:19.009> in

00:01:19.389 --> 00:01:19.399 
stuttering or anything you can zoom in

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:21.070 
stuttering or anything you can zoom in
very<00:01:19.909> quickly<00:01:20.210> to<00:01:20.330> pinch<00:01:20.630> it<00:01:20.720> zoom<00:01:20.899> works

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 
very quickly to pinch it zoom works

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.520 
very quickly to pinch it zoom works

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
great we're still waiting on the one the

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.429 
great we're still waiting on the one the
right<00:01:24.710> and<00:01:25.060> there<00:01:26.060> goes<00:01:26.240> it<00:01:26.450> just<00:01:26.479> finished<00:01:26.929> so

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:27.439 
right and there goes it just finished so

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:28.749 
right and there goes it just finished so
take<00:01:27.619> about<00:01:27.710> a<00:01:27.770> second<00:01:28.100> off<00:01:28.189> of<00:01:28.310> that<00:01:28.399> between

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:28.759 
take about a second off of that between

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:31.690 
take about a second off of that between
a<00:01:28.789> I<00:01:29.119> started<00:01:29.780> it<00:01:29.899> slightly<00:01:30.710> off<00:01:30.950> but<00:01:31.490> you<00:01:31.580> get

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
a I started it slightly off but you get

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.120 
a I started it slightly off but you get
the<00:01:31.759> idea<00:01:31.909> a<00:01:32.380> hardware<00:01:33.380> acceleration<00:01:33.799> is<00:01:34.100> a

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
the idea a hardware acceleration is a

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.520 
the idea a hardware acceleration is a
big<00:01:34.670> big<00:01:34.940> difference<00:01:35.149> you<00:01:35.810> can<00:01:35.899> also<00:01:36.020> see<00:01:36.259> much

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
big big difference you can also see much

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.320 
big big difference you can also see much
more<00:01:36.799> the<00:01:36.950> screen<00:01:37.369> now<00:01:37.549> between<00:01:37.880> the<00:01:38.149> two

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:38.330 
more the screen now between the two

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.870 
more the screen now between the two
because<00:01:38.869> it<00:01:39.080> got<00:01:39.170> rid<00:01:39.319> of<00:01:39.350> all<00:01:39.500> the<00:01:39.649> chrome<00:01:39.920> if

those options were of course listed up

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:52.930 
those options were of course listed up
here<00:01:51.649> before<00:01:52.130> so<00:01:52.369> in<00:01:52.459> essence<00:01:52.789> there's

here before so in essence there's
nothing<00:01:53.360> too<00:01:53.720> much<00:01:53.929> that's<00:01:54.229> different<00:01:54.729> in

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 
nothing too much that's different in

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:57.609 
nothing too much that's different in
that<00:01:55.819> regard<00:01:56.330> they<00:01:56.869> did<00:01:57.049> move<00:01:57.229> the<00:01:57.350> address

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
that regard they did move the address

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:00.130 
that regard they did move the address
bar<00:01:57.860> from<00:01:58.069> up<00:01:58.189> there<00:01:58.399> two<00:01:58.610> down<00:01:58.759> here<00:01:59.240> and<00:01:59.390> of

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
bar from up there two down here and of

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.160 
bar from up there two down here and of
course<00:02:00.170> if<00:02:00.560> you<00:02:00.649> go<00:02:00.770> to<00:02:00.830> landscape<00:02:01.869> that<00:02:02.869> works

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
course if you go to landscape that works

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.259 
course if you go to landscape that works
there<00:02:03.440> too<00:02:03.739> which<00:02:04.310> is<00:02:04.340> nice<00:02:04.640> to<00:02:04.940> make<00:02:05.060> a<00:02:05.090> lot<00:02:05.209> of

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:05.269 
there too which is nice to make a lot of

00:02:05.269 --> 00:02:08.199 
there too which is nice to make a lot of
people<00:02:05.509> happy<00:02:06.459> you<00:02:07.459> can<00:02:07.580> see<00:02:07.700> the<00:02:07.819> redraw

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209

Wi-Fi where it really really takes off I

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:20.350 
Wi-Fi where it really really takes off I
mean<00:02:19.280> because<00:02:19.370> it<00:02:19.550> could<00:02:19.670> just<00:02:19.760> swallow<00:02:20.030> data

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
mean because it could just swallow data

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.360 
mean because it could just swallow data
and<00:02:20.629> for<00:02:21.260> those<00:02:21.349> wondering<00:02:21.590> with<00:02:21.830> dual<00:02:21.980> cores

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
and for those wondering with dual cores

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.190 
and for those wondering with dual cores
I<00:02:22.640> mean<00:02:22.819> this<00:02:23.269> is<00:02:23.420> a<00:02:23.450> great<00:02:23.660> example<00:02:23.750> of<00:02:24.019> how<00:02:24.170> a

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
I mean this is a great example of how a

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.630 
I mean this is a great example of how a
dual<00:02:24.470> core<00:02:24.709> could<00:02:24.860> probably<00:02:25.010> take<00:02:25.190> advantage

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
dual core could probably take advantage

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.820 
dual core could probably take advantage
of<00:02:25.730> this<00:02:25.879> because<00:02:26.030> then<00:02:26.239> the<00:02:26.830> Internet

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
of this because then the Internet

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.680 
of this because then the Internet
Explorer<00:02:28.190> could<00:02:28.400> use<00:02:28.580> /<00:02:29.060> you<00:02:29.209> know<00:02:29.330> presumably

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
Explorer could use / you know presumably

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.420 
Explorer could use / you know presumably
one<00:02:30.140> of<00:02:30.230> those<00:02:30.349> cores<00:02:30.590> and<00:02:30.739> they<00:02:30.830> get<00:02:31.040> even<00:02:31.280> go

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
one of those cores and they get even go

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.030 
one of those cores and they get even go
faster<00:02:31.970> so<00:02:32.300> let's<00:02:33.290> take<00:02:33.500> a<00:02:33.530> look<00:02:33.739> at<00:02:33.830> something

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
faster so let's take a look at something

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:44.640 
faster so let's take a look at something
else<00:02:34.340> now<00:02:35.950> SiC<00:02:36.950> the<00:02:36.980> acid<00:02:37.550> three<00:02:37.760> test

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.530 

you<00:02:45.250> can<00:02:45.400> see<00:02:45.610> the<00:02:45.730> difference<00:02:46.090> between<00:02:46.209> the

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
you can see the difference between the

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.940 
you can see the difference between the
two<00:02:48.810> it's<00:02:49.810> a<00:02:49.930> little<00:02:50.110> dramatic<00:02:50.260> let's<00:02:50.799> just

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
two it's a little dramatic let's just

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.690 
two it's a little dramatic let's just
say<00:02:51.040> that<00:02:51.069> and<00:02:52.739> that's<00:02:53.739> pretty<00:02:53.980> much<00:02:54.099> it<00:02:54.280> I

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
say that and that's pretty much it I

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.679 
say that and that's pretty much it I
mean<00:02:55.650> the<00:02:56.650> one<00:02:56.920> here<00:02:57.370> so<00:02:57.849> this<00:02:58.030> drew<00:02:58.540> it

00:02:58.679 --> 00:02:58.689 
mean the one here so this drew it

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:00.569 
mean the one here so this drew it
exactly<00:02:59.170> the<00:02:59.260> way<00:02:59.349> it<00:02:59.530> supposed<00:02:59.920> to<00:03:00.129> if<00:03:00.430> you

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:00.579 
exactly the way it supposed to if you

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:05.610 
exactly the way it supposed to if you
look<00:03:00.730> at<00:03:00.849> the<00:03:01.120> the<00:03:02.310> sample<00:03:03.310> image<00:03:03.840> and<00:03:04.840> they

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
look at the the sample image and they

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.890 
look at the the sample image and they
cut<00:03:05.829> 5<00:03:06.069> out<00:03:06.310> of<00:03:06.340> 100<00:03:06.909> and<00:03:07.090> it<00:03:07.659> doesn't<00:03:07.780> even

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
cut 5 out of 100 and it doesn't even

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.259 
cut 5 out of 100 and it doesn't even
look<00:03:08.109> right<00:03:08.530> if<00:03:08.769> you<00:03:09.010> you<00:03:09.790> know<00:03:09.879> we<00:03:10.030> can<00:03:10.150> look

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269 
look right if you you know we can look

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:12.990 
look right if you you know we can look
at<00:03:10.329> the<00:03:11.220> that's<00:03:12.220> what<00:03:12.430> it's<00:03:12.579> supposed<00:03:12.879> to<00:03:12.939> look

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
at the that's what it's supposed to look

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.569 
at the that's what it's supposed to look
like<00:03:13.150> 100<00:03:13.810> out<00:03:13.900> of<00:03:13.930> 100<00:03:14.409> that's<00:03:14.530> the<00:03:14.799> ideal<00:03:15.280> and

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:15.579 
like 100 out of 100 that's the ideal and

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:18.390 
like 100 out of 100 that's the ideal and
if<00:03:16.150> you<00:03:16.239> look<00:03:16.299> here<00:03:17.040> that's<00:03:18.040> what<00:03:18.250> ours

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
if you look here that's what ours

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.339 
if you look here that's what ours
actually<00:03:18.639> looks<00:03:19.000> like<00:03:19.180> so<00:03:19.450> it<00:03:19.480> is<00:03:19.840> doing<00:03:20.260> a

00:03:20.339 --> 00:03:20.349 
actually looks like so it is doing a

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:25.110 
actually looks like so it is doing a
very<00:03:20.379> good<00:03:20.680> job<00:03:20.859> of<00:03:21.069> the<00:03:21.340> test<00:03:21.639> and<00:03:23.340> ie<00:03:24.340> no

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
very good job of the test and ie no

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.599 
very good job of the test and ie no
dough<00:03:25.269> is<00:03:25.450> pretty<00:03:25.900> pathetic<00:03:26.190> you<00:03:27.190> get'em<00:03:27.430> it<00:03:27.549> I

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:27.609 
dough is pretty pathetic you get'em it I

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:29.099 
dough is pretty pathetic you get'em it I
me<00:03:27.700> that's<00:03:27.819> a<00:03:27.909> huge<00:03:28.299> change<00:03:28.329> I<00:03:28.780> already<00:03:28.930> know

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:29.109 
me that's a huge change I already know

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:31.379 
me that's a huge change I already know
it's<00:03:29.409> all<00:03:29.560> right<00:03:29.650> to<00:03:29.680> go<00:03:29.829> up<00:03:29.859> to<00:03:30.099> 1,200<00:03:30.389> you

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:31.389 
it's all right to go up to 1,200 you

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:32.729 
it's all right to go up to 1,200 you
just<00:03:31.569> see<00:03:31.659> how<00:03:31.689> slow<00:03:32.139> its<00:03:32.349> running<00:03:32.530> though

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
just see how slow its running though

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:34.349 
just see how slow its running though
it's<00:03:32.980> just<00:03:33.250> chugging<00:03:33.609> through<00:03:33.760> these<00:03:33.939> tests

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:34.359 
it's just chugging through these tests

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:37.349 
it's just chugging through these tests
where<00:03:34.959> the<00:03:35.170> one<00:03:35.319> on<00:03:35.530> the<00:03:35.709> Left<00:03:36.310> mango<00:03:36.849> has<00:03:37.090> just

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:37.359 
where the one on the Left mango has just

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:39.690 
where the one on the Left mango has just
absolutely<00:03:38.290> trounced<00:03:38.709> it<00:03:38.859> I<00:03:38.980> mean<00:03:39.129> it's<00:03:39.310> it's

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
absolutely trounced it I mean it's it's

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.339 
absolutely trounced it I mean it's it's
night<00:03:40.120> and<00:03:40.150> day<00:03:40.329> difference<00:03:40.450> between<00:03:41.109> them<00:03:41.230> so

00:03:41.339 --> 00:03:41.349 
night and day difference between them so

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:43.050 
night and day difference between them so

that loading an asteroid belt you can

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:14.939 
that loading an asteroid belt you can
see<00:04:12.730> I<00:04:13.030> mean<00:04:13.720> this<00:04:13.780> this<00:04:14.169> might<00:04:14.500> not<00:04:14.590> be<00:04:14.650> like

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
browser which is pretty impressive and

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:23.070

as<00:04:20.889> far<00:04:21.039> as<00:04:21.099> I<00:04:21.280> know<00:04:21.340> mobile<00:04:22.330> browsers<00:04:22.690> just

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
as far as I know mobile browsers just

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.200 
as far as I know mobile browsers just
don't<00:04:23.260> do<00:04:23.530> this<00:04:23.770> and<00:04:24.190> once<00:04:24.760> again<00:04:24.820> where<00:04:25.090> were

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
don't do this and once again where were

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:26.879 
don't do this and once again where were
Wi-Fi<00:04:25.659> but<00:04:25.870> that's<00:04:26.020> still<00:04:26.229> went<00:04:26.440> incredibly

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:26.889 
Wi-Fi but that's still went incredibly

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:28.710 
Wi-Fi but that's still went incredibly
fast<00:04:27.280> and<00:04:27.639> so<00:04:27.970> things<00:04:28.180> are<00:04:28.330> floating<00:04:28.659> around

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
fast and so things are floating around

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.360 
fast and so things are floating around
and<00:04:29.110> you<00:04:29.409> know<00:04:29.500> you<00:04:29.560> can<00:04:29.620> kind<00:04:29.949> of<00:04:29.979> scroll<00:04:30.220> the

screen and you can see things so that

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.560 
screen and you can see things so that
one's<00:04:35.050> kind<00:04:35.289> of<00:04:35.349> neat<00:04:36.270> remember<00:04:37.270> what<00:04:37.419> other

both<00:04:44.199> sitting<00:04:44.500> bubbles<00:04:44.800> is<00:04:44.949> kind<00:04:45.160> of

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
both sitting bubbles is kind of

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:49.920 
both sitting bubbles is kind of
impressive<00:04:47.760> so<00:04:48.760> once<00:04:48.940> again<00:04:49.060> full<00:04:49.690> screen

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930 
impressive so once again full screen

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:57.560 
impressive so once again full screen
animation<00:04:50.880> rocking<00:04:51.880> on<00:04:52.000> the<00:04:52.030> Windows<00:04:53.020> Phone

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:57.570 

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:01.290 

and<00:04:58.570> maybe<00:04:58.780> we'll<00:04:58.930> do<00:04:59.050> one<00:04:59.290> more<00:04:59.680> I<00:05:00.210> don't<00:05:01.210> you

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300 
and maybe we'll do one more I don't you

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.050 
and maybe we'll do one more I don't you
think<00:05:01.449> I've<00:05:01.510> tried<00:05:01.540> some<00:05:01.930> of<00:05:02.020> these<00:05:02.110> so<00:05:03.060> you

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:04.060 
think I've tried some of these so you

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:05.580 
think I've tried some of these so you
try<00:05:04.240> the<00:05:04.300> speed<00:05:04.660> reading<00:05:04.900> one<00:05:05.139> I<00:05:05.169> think<00:05:05.500> this

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:05.590 
try the speed reading one I think this

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:21.050 
try the speed reading one I think this
is<00:05:05.650> the<00:05:05.770> one<00:05:05.979> that<00:05:06.130> they<00:05:06.280> demoed<00:05:06.669> before

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:24.290 

okay<00:05:21.870> I<00:05:22.020> mean<00:05:22.260> I<00:05:22.889> think<00:05:23.550> developers<00:05:23.880> will<00:05:24.210> be

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:24.300 
okay I mean I think developers will be

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.000 
okay I mean I think developers will be
more<00:05:24.480> impressed<00:05:24.750> than<00:05:24.870> this<00:05:25.110> than<00:05:25.440> you<00:05:25.919> know

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.010 
more impressed than this than you know

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:28.220 
more impressed than this than you know
you<00:05:26.070> and<00:05:26.280> I<00:05:26.400> but<00:05:26.700> still<00:05:26.970> the<00:05:27.120> the<00:05:27.720> idea<00:05:28.080> is<00:05:28.200> that

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:28.230 
you and I but still the the idea is that

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:30.350 
you and I but still the the idea is that
having<00:05:28.740> this<00:05:28.800> sort<00:05:28.980> of<00:05:29.070> animation<00:05:29.610> on<00:05:29.970> the

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.360 
having this sort of animation on the

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.260 
having this sort of animation on the
device<00:05:30.660> is<00:05:31.400> you<00:05:32.400> know<00:05:32.490> within<00:05:32.639> the<00:05:32.820> browser<00:05:32.940> is

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:33.270 
device is you know within the browser is

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:35.360 
device is you know within the browser is
pretty<00:05:33.300> impressive<00:05:33.810> stuff<00:05:34.139> so<00:05:34.800> overall<00:05:35.340> a

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:35.370 
pretty impressive stuff so overall a

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:36.800 
pretty impressive stuff so overall a
great<00:05:35.669> experience<00:05:36.240> with<00:05:36.360> the<00:05:36.419> browser<00:05:36.660> I

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:36.810 
great experience with the browser I

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:41.350 
great experience with the browser I
could<00:05:37.230> also<00:05:37.680> point<00:05:38.160> out<00:05:38.280> that<00:05:38.810> third<00:05:39.810> parties

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:41.360 
could also point out that third parties

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:45.470 
could also point out that third parties
let's<00:05:42.360> use<00:05:42.450> the<00:05:42.600> chump<00:05:42.840> list<00:05:43.080> here<00:05:44.240> like<00:05:45.240> surf

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:45.480 
let's use the chump list here like surf

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:49.040 
let's use the chump list here like surf
cube<00:05:45.810> do<00:05:46.020> work<00:05:47.389> so<00:05:48.389> in<00:05:48.540> case<00:05:48.750> you're<00:05:48.900> wondering

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:49.050 
cube do work so in case you're wondering

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:50.860 
cube do work so in case you're wondering
Dayton<00:05:49.560> they<00:05:50.250> may<00:05:50.370> have<00:05:50.520> to<00:05:50.610> do<00:05:50.730> some

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:50.870 
Dayton they may have to do some

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:52.879 
Dayton they may have to do some
optimization<00:05:51.870> for<00:05:52.110> but<00:05:52.410> for<00:05:52.620> the<00:05:52.680> most<00:05:52.800> part

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:52.889 
optimization for but for the most part

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:54.890 
optimization for but for the most part
it<00:05:53.160> works<00:05:53.550> just<00:05:53.639> like<00:05:53.820> a<00:05:53.880> normal<00:05:54.030> browser<00:05:54.300> so

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:54.900
