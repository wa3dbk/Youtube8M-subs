try<00:01:13.830> working<00:01:14.130> with<00:01:14.250> bubbles<00:01:14.670> which<00:01:15.090> can<00:01:15.299> be<00:01:15.390> a

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
try working with bubbles which can be a

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.090 
try working with bubbles which can be a
lot<00:01:15.630> of<00:01:15.659> fun<00:01:15.900> for<00:01:16.080> children<00:01:16.470> but<00:01:16.680> then<00:01:16.860> it<00:01:16.979> also

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
lot of fun for children but then it also

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.350 
lot of fun for children but then it also

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
can be a little bit tough and difficult

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.539 
can be a little bit tough and difficult
so<00:01:19.350> when<00:01:19.530> you<00:01:19.650> first<00:01:19.830> teach<00:01:20.070> them<00:01:20.189> how<00:01:20.280> to<00:01:20.310> blow

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
so when you first teach them how to blow

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:21.800 
so when you first teach them how to blow
bubbles<00:01:20.729> it'll<00:01:21.210> be<00:01:21.299> something<00:01:21.509> to<00:01:21.659> this

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
bubbles it'll be something to this

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.630 
bubbles it'll be something to this
effect<00:01:21.920> we'll<00:01:22.920> go<00:01:23.009> ahead<00:01:23.070> and<00:01:23.280> put<00:01:23.400> our<00:01:23.430> mouths

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
effect we'll go ahead and put our mouths

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.370 
effect we'll go ahead and put our mouths
just<00:01:24.030> at<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.210> top<00:01:24.360> of<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.570> water<00:01:24.750> miss<00:01:24.930> Cal

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.929 

and<00:01:28.380> that<00:01:29.009> way<00:01:29.220> they<00:01:29.400> don't<00:01:29.490> have<00:01:29.610> to<00:01:29.759> put

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
and that way they don't have to put

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.120 
and that way they don't have to put
their<00:01:30.090> nose<00:01:30.329> in<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.630> water<00:01:30.840> or<00:01:31.530> their<00:01:31.950> eyes
