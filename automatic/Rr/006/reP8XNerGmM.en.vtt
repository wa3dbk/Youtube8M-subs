better and i think that the great thing
about<00:03:26.310> acting<00:03:26.790> is<00:03:26.910> that<00:03:27.060> even<00:03:27.270> when<00:03:27.480> you're

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
about acting is that even when you're

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.230 
about acting is that even when you're
like<00:03:27.870> you<00:03:28.710> know<00:03:28.740> 90<00:03:29.460> years<00:03:29.640> old<00:03:29.760> you<00:03:29.940> can<00:03:30.060> still

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:30.240 
like you know 90 years old you can still

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:31.700 
like you know 90 years old you can still
act<00:03:30.480> and<00:03:30.720> you're<00:03:30.810> always<00:03:31.290> learning<00:03:31.440> and

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:31.710 
act and you're always learning and

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:32.690 
act and you're always learning and
always<00:03:31.950> getting<00:03:32.220> better<00:03:32.340> so<00:03:32.490> i<00:03:32.550> don't<00:03:32.670> really

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
always getting better so i don't really

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.000 
always getting better so i don't really

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
really I don't really think that there's

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:51.500 
really I don't really think that there's
a<00:03:46.610> like<00:03:47.610> a<00:03:47.640> gauge<00:03:48.030> exactly<00:03:48.860> but<00:03:50.120> because<00:03:51.120> it's

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
a like a gauge exactly but because it's

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.510 
a like a gauge exactly but because it's
just<00:03:51.810> constantly<00:03:52.230> evolving<00:03:52.950> you're

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:53.520 
just constantly evolving you're

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.040 
just constantly evolving you're
constantly<00:03:53.880> involving<00:03:54.330> as<00:03:54.450> a<00:03:54.480> person<00:03:54.840> and<00:03:54.930> as

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.050 
constantly involving as a person and as

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:58.180 
constantly involving as a person and as
an<00:03:55.200> artist<00:03:55.470> when<00:03:56.220> I<00:03:56.280> researched<00:03:56.730> Harley<00:03:57.300> I

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190 
an artist when I researched Harley I

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.620 
an artist when I researched Harley I
there's<00:03:59.190> loads<00:03:59.580> of<00:03:59.610> things<00:03:59.700> on<00:03:59.910> YouTube<00:04:00.090> but

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
there's loads of things on YouTube but

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.390 
there's loads of things on YouTube but
it<00:04:00.930> was<00:04:01.320> kind<00:04:01.560> of<00:04:01.620> difficult<00:04:01.800> because<00:04:02.160> there

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
it was kind of difficult because there

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.820 
it was kind of difficult because there
was<00:04:02.550> nothing<00:04:02.820> that<00:04:03.390> like<00:04:03.930> an<00:04:04.080> an<00:04:04.230> actual

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:04.830 
was nothing that like an an actual

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:06.620 
was nothing that like an an actual
person<00:04:04.980> was<00:04:05.310> doing<00:04:05.910> like<00:04:06.060> she's<00:04:06.300> never<00:04:06.420> really

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 
person was doing like she's never really

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:09.470 
person was doing like she's never really
been<00:04:06.780> portrayed<00:04:07.200> by<00:04:07.470> an<00:04:07.910> actor<00:04:08.910> it's<00:04:09.150> always

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
been portrayed by an actor it's always

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.250 
been portrayed by an actor it's always
been<00:04:09.660> cartoons<00:04:10.110> or<00:04:10.290> like<00:04:11.270> CGI<00:04:12.270> or<00:04:12.660> whatever

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
and but that's ok because she's such an

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.140 
and but that's ok because she's such an
like<00:04:16.049> over-the-top<00:04:16.830> kind<00:04:17.310> of<00:04:17.489> character

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:03.390 
as well like you know quite melodramatic

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:05.900 
as well like you know quite melodramatic
at<00:05:03.480> times<00:05:03.710> um<00:05:04.710> but<00:05:05.160> it<00:05:05.430> was<00:05:05.550> just<00:05:05.580> it<00:05:05.850> was

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:05.910 
at times um but it was just it was

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:09.320 
at times um but it was just it was
different<00:05:06.390> because<00:05:06.480> this<00:05:06.990> is<00:05:07.380> just<00:05:08.150> it<00:05:09.150> was

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:09.330 
different because this is just it was

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:13.430 
different because this is just it was
just<00:05:09.360> probably<00:05:09.840> the<00:05:10.230> most<00:05:10.880> the<00:05:11.880> most<00:05:12.660> free<00:05:13.200> I

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440 
just probably the most the most free I

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.070 
just probably the most the most free I
could<00:05:13.620> ever<00:05:13.740> be<00:05:13.950> on<00:05:14.340> a<00:05:14.400> set<00:05:14.700> or<00:05:14.880> doing<00:05:15.150> apart<00:05:15.480> um

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 
could ever be on a set or doing apart um

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:21.380 
could ever be on a set or doing apart um

kind<00:05:30.210> of<00:05:30.300> explore<00:05:30.690> things<00:05:30.840> and<00:05:31.080> just<00:05:31.320> you<00:05:31.500> know

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:31.530

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:33.890 
kind of explore things and just you know
do<00:05:31.830> do<00:05:32.700> this<00:05:32.880> how<00:05:33.030> you<00:05:33.090> think<00:05:33.300> it<00:05:33.420> would<00:05:33.510> how

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:33.900 
do do this how you think it would how

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:35.240

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:36.660 
think that was probably the most

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:38.090 
think that was probably the most
different<00:05:37.200> to<00:05:37.320> any<00:05:37.590> other<00:05:37.620> thing<00:05:37.890> that<00:05:37.920> I've

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:38.100 
different to any other thing that I've

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:41.210 
different to any other thing that I've
done<00:05:38.220> I<00:05:38.280> just<00:05:38.610> felt<00:05:38.850> I<00:05:39.060> felt<00:05:39.300> really<00:05:39.960> free<00:05:40.320> um<00:05:40.560> I
