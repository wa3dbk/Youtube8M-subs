hello<00:00:01.589> guys<00:00:01.800> this<00:00:01.829> quick<00:00:02.340> video<00:00:02.490> to<00:00:03.090> explain

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
hello guys this quick video to explain

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.809 
hello guys this quick video to explain
about<00:00:03.870> step<00:00:04.410> up<00:00:04.560> and<00:00:04.710> step<00:00:04.890> down<00:00:05.100> transformers

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
about step up and step down transformers

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:08.900 
about step up and step down transformers
and<00:00:06.589> when<00:00:07.589> we<00:00:07.770> talk<00:00:07.980> about<00:00:08.010> stepping<00:00:08.550> up<00:00:08.760> and

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
and when we talk about stepping up and

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.390 
and when we talk about stepping up and
stepping<00:00:09.030> down<00:00:09.420> what<00:00:09.630> we<00:00:09.750> mean<00:00:10.200> is<00:00:10.889> that<00:00:10.950> the

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
stepping down what we mean is that the

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.330 
stepping down what we mean is that the
output<00:00:12.210> voltage<00:00:12.240> of<00:00:12.900> the<00:00:13.530> transformer<00:00:13.740> is

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
output voltage of the transformer is

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.980 
output voltage of the transformer is
different<00:00:14.880> to<00:00:15.030> the<00:00:15.150> input<00:00:15.450> property<00:00:15.750> to<00:00:15.900> the

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
different to the input property to the

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.130 
different to the input property to the
transformer<00:00:16.619> so<00:00:17.490> let's<00:00:17.880> pick<00:00:18.150> a<00:00:18.359> simple

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
transformer so let's pick a simple

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:27.490 
transformer so let's pick a simple
transformer<00:00:19.859> we<00:00:20.460> will<00:00:20.699> have<00:00:23.300> an<00:00:24.920> input<00:00:25.920> coil

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:27.500 
transformer we will have an input coil

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.220 
transformer we will have an input coil
with<00:00:28.519> certain<00:00:29.519> voltage<00:00:29.970> voltage<00:00:30.810> on<00:00:31.140> the

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
with certain voltage voltage on the

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.979 
with certain voltage voltage on the
primary<00:00:31.500> and<00:00:31.920> it's<00:00:32.279> got<00:00:32.460> a<00:00:32.489> number<00:00:32.820> of<00:00:32.910> turns<00:00:33.329> n

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
primary and it's got a number of turns n

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.510 
primary and it's got a number of turns n
P<00:00:34.620> number<00:00:35.280> on<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:36.030> primary<00:00:36.890> and<00:00:37.890> that<00:00:38.160> goes<00:00:38.340> to

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
P number on the primary and that goes to

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.389 
P number on the primary and that goes to
some<00:00:38.760> output<00:00:39.079> of<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.260> transformer<00:00:43.190> which<00:00:44.190> has

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
some output of the transformer which has

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.600 
some output of the transformer which has
a<00:00:44.430> voltage<00:00:44.969> on<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.300> secondary<00:00:45.360> and<00:00:46.200> a<00:00:47.160> number

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
a voltage on the secondary and a number

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.750 
a voltage on the secondary and a number
of<00:00:47.700> turns<00:00:48.059> on<00:00:48.800> secondary<00:00:49.800> so<00:00:50.430> that's<00:00:50.610> the

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
of turns on secondary so that's the

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.040 
of turns on secondary so that's the
terminology<00:00:50.940> we<00:00:51.480> using

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
terminology we using

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.959 
terminology we using
there's<00:00:52.620> an<00:00:52.710> equation<00:00:52.980> that<00:00:53.340> governs<00:00:53.520> the

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
there's an equation that governs the

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.600 
there's an equation that governs the
relationship<00:00:54.059> between<00:00:54.690> these<00:00:55.020> and<00:00:55.579> it<00:00:56.579> is

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
relationship between these and it is

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.779 
relationship between these and it is
that<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.629> voltage<00:00:58.140> on<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.829> primary<00:00:59.340> divided

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
that the voltage on the primary divided

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.750 
that the voltage on the primary divided
by<00:00:59.910> the<00:00:59.969> voltage<00:01:00.300> on<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.570> secondary<00:01:01.039> is<00:01:02.039> equal

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
by the voltage on the secondary is equal

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.260 
by the voltage on the secondary is equal
to<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.750> number<00:01:04.019> on<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.530> primary<00:01:05.090> divided<00:01:06.090> by

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
to the number on the primary divided by

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.929 
to the number on the primary divided by
the<00:01:06.840> number<00:01:07.049> on<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.560> secondary<00:01:08.010> so<00:01:08.850> it

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
the number on the secondary so it

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.880 
the number on the secondary so it
doesn't<00:01:09.299> matter<00:01:09.479> which<00:01:09.840> way<00:01:10.080> you<00:01:10.140> get<00:01:10.560> this<00:01:10.680> up

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
doesn't matter which way you get this up

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.480 
doesn't matter which way you get this up
as<00:01:11.220> long<00:01:11.970> as<00:01:12.150> you<00:01:12.290> have<00:01:13.290> both<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.920> voltages<00:01:14.340> on

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
as long as you have both the voltages on

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.510 
as long as you have both the voltages on
one<00:01:14.670> side<00:01:15.710> both<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.890> numbers<00:01:17.189> on<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.400> other

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.210 
one side both the numbers on the other
side<00:01:17.759> we<00:01:18.540> could<00:01:18.750> equally<00:01:19.170> write<00:01:19.350> it<00:01:19.619> the

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
side we could equally write it the

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.520 
side we could equally write it the
voltage<00:01:20.549> on<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:20.790> secondary<00:01:21.380> divided<00:01:22.380> by<00:01:22.470> the

turns<00:02:18.900> secondary<00:02:20.579> we're<00:02:21.579> told<00:02:21.819> has<00:02:22.739> 1200

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
turns secondary we're told has 1200

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:28.709 
turns secondary we're told has 1200
turns<00:02:24.480> and<00:02:26.819> we<00:02:27.819> need<00:02:28.000> to<00:02:28.120> work<00:02:28.299> out<00:02:28.510> the

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:28.719 
turns and we need to work out the

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:33.929 
turns and we need to work out the
voltage<00:02:28.900> on<00:02:29.379> the<00:02:29.560> secondary<00:02:32.609> that's<00:02:33.609> what's

00:02:33.929 --> 00:02:33.939 
voltage on the secondary that's what's

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:36.899 
voltage on the secondary that's what's
unknown<00:02:34.680> so<00:02:35.680> how<00:02:35.920> do<00:02:35.980> we<00:02:36.069> do<00:02:36.219> this<00:02:36.400> let's<00:02:36.730> pick

00:02:36.899 --> 00:02:36.909 
unknown so how do we do this let's pick

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:38.459 
unknown so how do we do this let's pick
the<00:02:37.030> right<00:02:37.150> equation<00:02:37.599> we're<00:02:38.019> looking<00:02:38.290> for<00:02:38.409> the

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:38.469 
the right equation we're looking for the

00:02:38.469 --> 00:02:39.959 
the right equation we're looking for the
voltage<00:02:38.650> on<00:02:38.889> the<00:02:38.980> secondary<00:02:39.010> so<00:02:39.579> we<00:02:39.700> want<00:02:39.909> that

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:39.969 
voltage on the secondary so we want that

00:02:39.969 --> 00:02:43.259 
voltage on the secondary so we want that
on<00:02:40.180> the<00:02:40.299> top<00:02:40.829> so<00:02:41.829> we<00:02:42.040> can<00:02:42.219> pick<00:02:42.400> the<00:02:42.579> second<00:02:43.090> of

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:43.269 
on the top so we can pick the second of

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:45.569 
on the top so we can pick the second of
these<00:02:43.709> and<00:02:44.709> say<00:02:44.859> the<00:02:44.980> voltage<00:02:45.129> on<00:02:45.430> the

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:45.579 
these and say the voltage on the

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:47.759 
these and say the voltage on the
secondary<00:02:45.989> divided<00:02:46.989> by<00:02:47.079> the<00:02:47.139> voltage<00:02:47.319> on<00:02:47.650> the

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769 
secondary divided by the voltage on the

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:49.740 
secondary divided by the voltage on the
primary<00:02:48.040> is<00:02:48.489> equal<00:02:48.909> to<00:02:49.030> the<00:02:49.150> number<00:02:49.359> on<00:02:49.629> the

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
primary is equal to the number on the

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.929 
primary is equal to the number on the
secondary<00:02:50.250> divided<00:02:51.250> by<00:02:51.340> the<00:02:51.400> number<00:02:51.609> on<00:02:51.790> the

00:02:51.929 --> 00:02:51.939 
secondary divided by the number on the

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:55.140 
secondary divided by the number on the
primary<00:02:53.040> now<00:02:54.040> because<00:02:54.370> this<00:02:54.489> is<00:02:54.760> a

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
primary now because this is a

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.440 
primary now because this is a
denominator<00:02:55.930> over<00:02:56.439> here<00:02:56.700> on<00:02:57.700> the<00:02:57.879> bottom<00:02:58.060> of

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
denominator over here on the bottom of

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.670 
denominator over here on the bottom of
the<00:03:00.359> equation<00:03:01.359> we<00:03:01.689> need<00:03:01.870> to<00:03:01.930> take<00:03:02.200> it<00:03:02.349> up<00:03:02.500> to

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
the equation we need to take it up to

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.740 
the equation we need to take it up to
the<00:03:02.769> top<00:03:03.129> on<00:03:03.430> the<00:03:03.700> other<00:03:03.849> side<00:03:04.060> so<00:03:04.269> we<00:03:04.329> multiply

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
the top on the other side so we multiply

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:12.530 
the top on the other side so we multiply
both<00:03:04.989> sides<00:03:05.319> by<00:03:05.439> V<00:03:05.560> P<00:03:07.439> so<00:03:08.439> V<00:03:08.650> s<00:03:08.829> becomes<00:03:09.419> n<00:03:10.419> s<00:03:10.950> n<00:03:11.950> P

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
both sides by V P so V s becomes n s n P

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:18.210 
both sides by V P so V s becomes n s n P
multiplied<00:03:13.540> by<00:03:14.099> V<00:03:15.099> P<00:03:16.620> so<00:03:17.620> the<00:03:17.709> voltage<00:03:18.010> on<00:03:18.129> the

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
multiplied by V P so the voltage on the

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.520 
multiplied by V P so the voltage on the
secondary<00:03:18.280> in<00:03:18.760> this<00:03:18.909> case<00:03:19.150> is<00:03:19.870> the<00:03:20.169> number<00:03:20.440> on

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
secondary in this case is the number on

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.930 
secondary in this case is the number on
the<00:03:20.650> secondary<00:03:21.040> which<00:03:22.030> is<00:03:22.239> 1200<00:03:22.540> turns

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
the secondary which is 1200 turns

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.140 
the secondary which is 1200 turns
divided<00:03:24.940> by<00:03:25.949> number<00:03:26.949> of<00:03:26.979> the<00:03:27.099> primary<00:03:27.519> which

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
divided by number of the primary which

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:33.030 
divided by number of the primary which
is<00:03:28.359> 800<00:03:28.659> turns<00:03:30.000> multiplied<00:03:31.000> by<00:03:31.269> the<00:03:32.019> 300<00:03:32.829> volt

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
is 800 turns multiplied by the 300 volt

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:38.689 
is 800 turns multiplied by the 300 volt
input<00:03:34.769> mister<00:03:35.769> provide<00:03:36.129> the<00:03:36.340> calculator<00:03:37.560> so

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:38.699 
input mister provide the calculator so

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:44.420 
input mister provide the calculator so
1200<00:03:39.870> divided<00:03:40.870> by<00:03:40.989> 800<00:03:41.909> gives<00:03:42.909> us<00:03:43.030> 1<00:03:43.209> point<00:03:43.419> 5

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
1200 divided by 800 gives us 1 point 5

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:49.050 
1200 divided by 800 gives us 1 point 5
multiplied<00:03:45.430> by<00:03:45.669> 300<00:03:47.459> means<00:03:48.459> the<00:03:48.609> voltage<00:03:48.939> on

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
multiplied by 300 means the voltage on

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:55.740 
multiplied by 300 means the voltage on
the<00:03:49.180> secondary<00:03:49.379> is<00:03:50.639> 450<00:03:51.639> volts<00:03:53.280> so<00:03:54.750> because

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
the secondary is 450 volts so because

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.569 
the secondary is 450 volts so because
the<00:03:55.900> voltage<00:03:56.079> is<00:03:56.530> increased<00:03:56.979> we've<00:03:57.220> gone<00:03:57.370> from

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:57.579 
the voltage is increased we've gone from

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:04.110 
the voltage is increased we've gone from
300<00:03:58.419> volts<00:03:58.750> on<00:03:58.989> the<00:03:59.139> input<00:04:01.169> to<00:04:02.340> 450<00:04:03.340> volts<00:04:03.519> this

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
300 volts on the input to 450 volts this

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:10.080 
300 volts on the input to 450 volts this
is<00:04:04.180> a<00:04:04.709> step-up<00:04:06.359> transformer<00:04:07.859> and<00:04:08.939> you<00:04:09.939> can

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
is a step-up transformer and you can

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:11.819 
is a step-up transformer and you can
identify<00:04:10.209> the<00:04:10.750> fact<00:04:11.049> that<00:04:11.139> it's<00:04:11.349> a<00:04:11.470> step-up

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:11.829 
identify the fact that it's a step-up

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:14.460 
identify the fact that it's a step-up
transformer<00:04:12.549> because<00:04:13.209> you<00:04:13.509> have<00:04:13.689> more<00:04:14.049> turns

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470 
transformer because you have more turns

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.719 
transformer because you have more turns
on<00:04:15.189> the<00:04:16.030> output<00:04:16.479> than<00:04:16.690> you<00:04:16.810> do<00:04:16.959> on<00:04:17.079> the<00:04:17.199> input

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:17.729 
on the output than you do on the input

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:20.249 
on the output than you do on the input
so<00:04:18.729> if<00:04:18.820> you<00:04:18.940> have<00:04:19.030> more<00:04:19.239> turns<00:04:19.539> on<00:04:19.780> the<00:04:19.870> output

00:04:20.249 --> 00:04:20.259 
so if you have more turns on the output

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:26.279 
so if you have more turns on the output
it<00:04:20.769> is<00:04:20.919> a<00:04:20.949> step-up<00:04:22.169> transformer

00:04:26.279 --> 00:04:26.289 

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:29.950 

so<00:04:27.289> you<00:04:27.350> might<00:04:27.560> be<00:04:27.710> asked<00:04:27.889> to<00:04:28.009> find<00:04:28.280> the<00:04:29.180> number

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
so you might be asked to find the number

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.629 
so you might be asked to find the number
of<00:04:29.990> turns<00:04:30.289> let's<00:04:31.100> look<00:04:31.280> at<00:04:31.370> that<00:04:31.430> with<00:04:31.610> a

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:31.639 
of turns let's look at that with a

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:35.560 
of turns let's look at that with a
step-down<00:04:31.990> transformer<00:04:33.460> so<00:04:34.460> if<00:04:35.180> I<00:04:35.300> have<00:04:35.539> a

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:35.570 
step-down transformer so if I have a

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:42.010 
step-down transformer so if I have a
voltage<00:04:35.870> on<00:04:36.199> a<00:04:36.229> primary<00:04:36.590> of<00:04:38.680> 200<00:04:39.680> volts<00:04:41.020> the

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.020 
voltage on a primary of 200 volts the

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:52.080 
voltage on a primary of 200 volts the

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:52.090 
number on the primary of say 80 turns I

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:57.339 
number on the primary of say 80 turns I
have<00:04:53.090> a<00:04:53.120> voltage<00:04:53.470> on<00:04:54.470> the<00:04:54.710> secondary<00:04:54.740> of<00:04:56.349> 30

00:04:57.349 --> 00:05:01.420 
have a voltage on the secondary of 30
volts<00:04:58.360> then<00:04:59.360> only<00:04:59.960> unknown<00:05:00.590> is<00:05:00.889> the<00:05:01.099> number<00:05:01.370> of

turns on the secondary that's what we're
looking<00:05:03.979> for<00:05:04.720> so<00:05:05.720> if<00:05:05.990> we<00:05:06.110> fit<00:05:06.289> this<00:05:06.410> equation

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 
looking for so if we fit this equation

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.060 
looking for so if we fit this equation

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:45.260 
primary plug in our numbers so we have

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.050 
primary plug in our numbers so we have
the<00:05:45.530> voltage<00:05:45.860> on<00:05:45.949> the<00:05:46.070> secondary<00:05:46.099> being<00:05:46.760> 30

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:47.060 
the voltage on the secondary being 30

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:51.540 
the voltage on the secondary being 30
volts<00:05:48.280> voltage<00:05:49.280> on<00:05:49.430> the<00:05:49.490> primary<00:05:49.760> being<00:05:50.510> 200

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:51.550 
volts voltage on the primary being 200

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:55.029 
volts voltage on the primary being 200
volts<00:05:52.550> and<00:05:53.139> we're<00:05:54.139> going<00:05:54.259> to<00:05:54.320> multiply<00:05:54.800> that

00:05:55.029 --> 00:05:55.039 
volts and we're going to multiply that

00:05:55.039 --> 00:06:01.200 
volts and we're going to multiply that
by<00:05:55.220> 80<00:05:55.820> turns<00:05:58.330> put<00:05:59.330> this<00:05:59.419> into<00:05:59.630> the<00:05:59.720> calculator

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:01.210 
by 80 turns put this into the calculator

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:09.370 
by 80 turns put this into the calculator
so<00:06:03.669> 330<00:06:04.669> divided<00:06:05.090> by<00:06:05.240> 200<00:06:05.870> is<00:06:06.400> 0.15<00:06:08.380> multiplied

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:09.380 
so 330 divided by 200 is 0.15 multiplied

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:15.689 
so 330 divided by 200 is 0.15 multiplied
by<00:06:09.590> 80<00:06:11.560> number<00:06:12.560> on<00:06:12.650> the<00:06:12.740> secondary<00:06:13.250> it's<00:06:14.090> 12

00:06:15.689 --> 00:06:15.699 
by 80 number on the secondary it's 12

00:06:15.699 --> 00:06:20.400 
by 80 number on the secondary it's 12
turns

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:20.410 

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:22.690 

okay<00:06:21.440> we<00:06:22.010> know<00:06:22.130> that<00:06:22.250> was<00:06:22.370> a<00:06:22.400> step-down

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:22.700 
okay we know that was a step-down

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:23.710 
okay we know that was a step-down
transformer

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:23.720 
transformer

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:27.550 
transformer
definitely<00:06:25.000> because<00:06:26.000> the<00:06:26.840> voltage<00:06:27.200> dropped

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:27.560 
definitely because the voltage dropped

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:36.750 
definitely because the voltage dropped
from<00:06:27.740> 200<00:06:28.340> to<00:06:28.460> 300<00:06:29.060> so<00:06:29.780> that<00:06:29.930> was<00:06:30.080> step<00:06:30.350> down

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:36.760 

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:41.620 

and<00:06:38.530> if<00:06:39.530> a<00:06:39.980> step-up<00:06:40.340> has<00:06:40.550> more<00:06:40.880> turns<00:06:41.210> on<00:06:41.510> the

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:41.630 
and if a step-up has more turns on the

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:43.810 
and if a step-up has more turns on the
secondary<00:06:42.050> than<00:06:42.680> the<00:06:42.800> step-down<00:06:43.100> should<00:06:43.580> have

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:43.820 
secondary than the step-down should have

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:46.450 
secondary than the step-down should have
fewer<00:06:44.630> turns<00:06:44.870> on<00:06:45.110> the<00:06:45.200> secondary<00:06:45.710> and<00:06:45.920> if<00:06:46.310> we

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:46.460 
fewer turns on the secondary and if we

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:50.590 
fewer turns on the secondary and if we
look<00:06:46.610> at<00:06:46.700> that<00:06:46.820> we<00:06:47.030> went<00:06:47.210> from<00:06:47.330> 80<00:06:47.630> turns<00:06:49.600> down

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:50.600 
look at that we went from 80 turns down

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:53.230 
look at that we went from 80 turns down
to<00:06:50.810> 12<00:06:51.080> turns<00:06:51.430> so<00:06:52.430> I<00:06:52.610> hope<00:06:52.700> that<00:06:52.760> helps<00:06:53.120> if

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:53.240 
to 12 turns so I hope that helps if

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:55.360 
to 12 turns so I hope that helps if
