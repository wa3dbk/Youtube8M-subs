if it's a weekend workshop that's
absolutely<00:00:20.369> fine<00:00:20.550> because<00:00:20.699> I<00:00:20.880> can<00:00:20.910> just

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
absolutely fine because I can just

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.849 
absolutely fine because I can just
follow<00:00:21.449> my<00:00:21.660> own<00:00:21.689> usual<00:00:22.230> way<00:00:22.350> of<00:00:22.410> doing<00:00:22.650> things

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
follow my own usual way of doing things

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.550 
follow my own usual way of doing things
but<00:00:23.519> I've<00:00:23.670> been<00:00:23.789> asked<00:00:24.060> to<00:00:24.090> do<00:00:24.300> um<00:00:24.600> basically<00:00:25.320> a

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
but I've been asked to do um basically a

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.700 
but I've been asked to do um basically a
half-day<00:00:26.039> workshop<00:00:26.070> and<00:00:26.849> so<00:00:27.689> in<00:00:27.960> fact<00:00:28.529> it's

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
half-day workshop and so in fact it's

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:29.870 
half-day workshop and so in fact it's
probably<00:00:28.800> less<00:00:29.130> than<00:00:29.160> that<00:00:29.400> it's<00:00:29.490> probably<00:00:29.640> an

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
probably less than that it's probably an

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.790 
probably less than that it's probably an
hour<00:00:30.000> and<00:00:30.150> a<00:00:30.179> half<00:00:30.390> so<00:00:31.320> it's<00:00:31.470> going<00:00:31.560> to<00:00:31.650> be<00:00:31.740> an

water<00:01:42.899> that's<00:01:43.829> it<00:01:43.979> in<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.399> microwave<00:01:44.850> so<00:01:45.689> I

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
water that's it in the microwave so I

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:49.760 
water that's it in the microwave so I
had<00:01:47.369> a<00:01:47.810> parrot<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:49.290> only<00:01:49.409> one<00:01:49.530> I<00:01:49.560> could<00:01:49.740> find

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
had a parrot the only one I could find

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.130 
had a parrot the only one I could find
at<00:01:50.070> home<00:01:50.220> up<00:01:50.369> Eric's<00:01:50.729> dish<00:01:51.420> which<00:01:51.720> I<00:01:51.930> have

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
at home up Eric's dish which I have

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.240 
at home up Eric's dish which I have
lined<00:01:52.409> with<00:01:52.799> Anna<00:01:53.159> cling<00:01:54.119> film<00:01:54.500> off<00:01:55.500> so<00:01:55.920> quite

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
lined with Anna cling film off so quite

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.859 
lined with Anna cling film off so quite
roughly<00:01:56.610> really<00:01:57.030> because<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.479> cling<00:01:57.689> film

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
roughly really because the cling film

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.630 
roughly really because the cling film
only<00:01:58.229> stays<00:01:58.500> in<00:01:58.710> for<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.009> first<00:01:59.219> couple<00:01:59.460> of

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
only stays in for the first couple of

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.990 
only stays in for the first couple of
layers<00:01:59.850> and<00:02:00.270> then<00:02:01.369> try<00:02:02.369> and<00:02:02.399> push<00:02:02.670> it<00:02:02.820> to<00:02:02.969> the

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
layers and then try and push it to the

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.740 
layers and then try and push it to the
edge<00:02:03.240> of<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.630> bowl<00:02:03.810> as<00:02:04.020> much<00:02:04.200> as<00:02:04.380> possible<00:02:05.750> so

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
edge of the bowl as much as possible so

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.660 
edge of the bowl as much as possible so
that's<00:02:06.869> that<00:02:07.110> stage<00:02:08.000> then<00:02:09.000> it's<00:02:09.390> um<00:02:10.520> back<00:02:11.520> to

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
that's that stage then it's um back to

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.580 
that's that stage then it's um back to
front<00:02:11.879> we<00:02:12.300> call<00:02:12.510> it<00:02:12.629> corn<00:02:12.840> flour<00:02:13.080> over<00:02:13.349> here<00:02:13.530> in

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
front we call it corn flour over here in

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.770 
front we call it corn flour over here in
the

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
the

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.780 
the
okay<00:02:14.020> in<00:02:14.080> America<00:02:14.800> it's<00:02:14.920> called<00:02:14.980> cornstarch

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
okay in America it's called cornstarch

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.390 
okay in America it's called cornstarch
same<00:02:16.209> thing<00:02:16.450> so<00:02:17.200> a<00:02:17.230> little<00:02:17.530> bit<00:02:17.620> of<00:02:17.740> that<00:02:17.920> added

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
same thing so a little bit of that added

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.440 
same thing so a little bit of that added
to<00:02:18.580> the<00:02:18.730> plain<00:02:19.150> white<00:02:19.390> flour<00:02:20.550> here<00:02:21.550> just<00:02:22.330> an

ordinary cheap plain white flour and

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.930 
ordinary cheap plain white flour and
then<00:02:25.209> I<00:02:25.620> whisk<00:02:26.620> it<00:02:26.800> up<00:02:26.950> it's<00:02:27.160> kind<00:02:27.370> of<00:02:27.520> one<00:02:27.700> part

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
then I whisk it up it's kind of one part

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.880 
then I whisk it up it's kind of one part
flour<00:02:28.300> to<00:02:28.630> one<00:02:28.810> part<00:02:29.050> water<00:02:29.140> that's<00:02:29.680> where<00:02:29.860> I

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
flour to one part water that's where I

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.220 
flour to one part water that's where I
do<00:02:30.040> it<00:02:30.310> and<00:02:30.489> I<00:02:30.910> whisk<00:02:31.120> it<00:02:31.270> up<00:02:31.390> in<00:02:31.510> a<00:02:31.600> blender<00:02:31.810> and

do it and I whisk it up in a blender and

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.900 
do it and I whisk it up in a blender and
put<00:02:32.800> it<00:02:32.950> into<00:02:33.280> a<00:02:33.550> bowl<00:02:34.950> and<00:02:35.950> then<00:02:36.220> I<00:02:36.430> just<00:02:36.700> use

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
put it into a bowl and then I just use

so<00:02:44.620> basically<00:02:45.459> into<00:02:46.390> the<00:02:46.540> flour<00:02:47.500> water<00:02:47.709> mix

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
so basically into the flour water mix

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:55.729 
so basically into the flour water mix
like<00:02:49.120> so<00:02:49.450> and<00:02:50.370> then<00:02:51.810> carefully<00:02:52.810> just<00:02:53.850> push<00:02:54.850> it

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
like so and then carefully just push it

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:57.840 
like so and then carefully just push it
can<00:02:56.739> ship<00:02:57.010> there<00:02:57.400> it<00:02:57.489> is

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
can ship there it is

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.360 
can ship there it is
push<00:02:58.450> it<00:02:58.540> against<00:02:58.780> the<00:02:58.840> side<00:02:59.170> repeat<00:03:00.100> ad

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
push it against the side repeat ad

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.070 
push it against the side repeat ad
infinitum<00:03:00.790> and<00:03:01.590> then<00:03:02.850> stick<00:03:03.850> it<00:03:03.930> the<00:03:04.930> whole

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
infinitum and then stick it the whole

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.199 
infinitum and then stick it the whole
thing<00:03:05.110> with<00:03:05.500> a<00:03:05.530> paper<00:03:05.800> in<00:03:06.069> in<00:03:06.250> the<00:03:06.700> microwave

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
thing with a paper in in the microwave

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:12.630 
thing with a paper in in the microwave
and<00:03:07.510> I<00:03:08.200> reckon<00:03:08.709> on<00:03:09.310> a<00:03:09.370> medium<00:03:10.030> heat<00:03:10.690> um<00:03:11.640> 30

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
and I reckon on a medium heat um 30

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.479 
and I reckon on a medium heat um 30
seconds<00:03:13.330> and<00:03:13.690> open<00:03:14.200> the<00:03:14.290> door<00:03:14.470> take<00:03:15.190> it<00:03:15.310> out

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
seconds and open the door take it out

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:17.880 
seconds and open the door take it out
and<00:03:15.670> let<00:03:15.760> the<00:03:15.910> steam<00:03:16.269> come<00:03:16.600> off<00:03:16.750> then<00:03:17.530> pop<00:03:17.769> it

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
and let the steam come off then pop it

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:19.650 
and let the steam come off then pop it
back<00:03:17.920> in<00:03:18.220> again<00:03:18.459> and<00:03:18.730> just<00:03:18.880> keep<00:03:19.150> on<00:03:19.329> doing

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
back in again and just keep on doing

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.720 
back in again and just keep on doing
that<00:03:19.780> until<00:03:19.930> it's<00:03:20.260> dry<00:03:20.560> which<00:03:21.190> doesn't<00:03:21.549> take

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
that until it's dry which doesn't take

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.360 
that until it's dry which doesn't take
long<00:03:21.970> just<00:03:22.239> a<00:03:22.390> few<00:03:22.420> moments<00:03:22.780> minutes<00:03:23.440> and<00:03:23.680> then

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
long just a few moments minutes and then

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.780 
long just a few moments minutes and then
repeat<00:03:24.940> the<00:03:25.299> same<00:03:25.890> back<00:03:26.890> in<00:03:27.070> the<00:03:27.130> microwave<00:03:27.310> I

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
repeat the same back in the microwave I

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.930 
repeat the same back in the microwave I
did<00:03:28.299> it<00:03:28.390> three<00:03:28.600> times<00:03:28.890> for<00:03:29.890> that<00:03:30.040> and<00:03:30.370> it's

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
did it three times for that and it's

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.140 
did it three times for that and it's
really<00:03:31.030> hard<00:03:31.570> and<00:03:32.400> it's<00:03:33.400> hard<00:03:33.459> enough<00:03:33.760> to<00:03:33.970> use

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
really hard and it's hard enough to use

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.360 
really hard and it's hard enough to use
in<00:03:34.420> a<00:03:34.600> tutorial<00:03:34.959> for<00:03:35.500> decorative<00:03:36.100> techniques

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
in a tutorial for decorative techniques

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:39.360 
in a tutorial for decorative techniques
and<00:03:37.260> then<00:03:38.260> I<00:03:38.290> just<00:03:38.590> finished<00:03:38.980> off<00:03:39.100> the<00:03:39.250> edges

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
and then I just finished off the edges

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.759 
and then I just finished off the edges
and<00:03:39.820> put<00:03:40.209> a<00:03:40.269> few<00:03:40.510> bits<00:03:40.720> around<00:03:41.049> the<00:03:41.350> side<00:03:41.530> so<00:03:41.739> I

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:41.769 
and put a few bits around the side so I

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:44.940 
and put a few bits around the side so I
suppose<00:03:42.130> all<00:03:42.310> in<00:03:42.459> all<00:03:42.549> four<00:03:43.480> layers<00:03:43.780> and<00:03:44.470> it

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
suppose all in all four layers and it

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.140 
suppose all in all four layers and it
took<00:03:45.130> me<00:03:45.480> under<00:03:46.480> an<00:03:46.780> hour<00:03:46.900> and<00:03:47.519> I'm<00:03:48.519> really<00:03:48.910> and

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
took me under an hour and I'm really and

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:50.910 
took me under an hour and I'm really and
in<00:03:49.329> that<00:03:49.540> time<00:03:49.810> I<00:03:49.840> was<00:03:50.109> working<00:03:50.140> out<00:03:50.500> so<00:03:50.560> in<00:03:50.769> the

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
in that time I was working out so in the

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.349 
in that time I was working out so in the
corridor<00:03:51.280> I<00:03:51.310> was<00:03:51.489> stopping<00:03:51.850> and<00:03:51.970> talking<00:03:52.090> to

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:52.359 
corridor I was stopping and talking to

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:54.420 
corridor I was stopping and talking to
load<00:03:52.510> well<00:03:52.840> loads<00:03:53.829> of<00:03:53.920> people<00:03:53.980> were<00:03:54.220> stopping

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
load well loads of people were stopping

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.039 
load well loads of people were stopping
and<00:03:54.640> talking<00:03:54.910> to<00:03:55.000> me<00:03:55.120> so<00:03:55.359> I<00:03:55.390> stopped<00:03:55.690> work<00:03:55.870> and

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:56.049 
and talking to me so I stopped work and

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:58.890 
and talking to me so I stopped work and
talked<00:03:56.200> to<00:03:56.230> them<00:03:56.470> and<00:03:57.329> I'm<00:03:58.329> really<00:03:58.720> really

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900 
talked to them and I'm really really

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.120 
talked to them and I'm really really
thrilled<00:03:59.170> so<00:03:59.980> I<00:04:00.450> think<00:04:01.450> that<00:04:02.109> leads<00:04:02.350> it<00:04:02.650> open

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.130 
thrilled so I think that leads it open

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:05.370 
thrilled so I think that leads it open
to<00:04:03.250> doing<00:04:03.430> all<00:04:03.549> sorts<00:04:03.850> of<00:04:03.910> things<00:04:04.200> obviously<00:04:05.200> I

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:05.380 
to doing all sorts of things obviously I

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.699 
to doing all sorts of things obviously I
didn't<00:04:05.859> have<00:04:05.980> salt<00:04:06.340> salt<00:04:07.329> apparently<00:04:07.840> stops

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:08.709 
didn't have salt salt apparently stops

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:09.449 
didn't have salt salt apparently stops
it<00:04:08.859> going<00:04:08.890> mouldy

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:09.459 
it going mouldy

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:11.099 
it going mouldy
well<00:04:09.940> obviously<00:04:10.030> the<00:04:10.450> mold<00:04:10.660> will<00:04:10.870> come

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:11.109 
well obviously the mold will come

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:12.930 
well obviously the mold will come
because<00:04:11.680> the<00:04:11.950> flour<00:04:12.190> and<00:04:12.340> water<00:04:12.459> glue<00:04:12.790> is

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
because the flour and water glue is

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.759 
because the flour and water glue is
hydroscopic<00:04:13.690> meaning<00:04:14.200> it<00:04:14.290> will<00:04:14.410> attract

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:14.769 
hydroscopic meaning it will attract

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:16.650 
hydroscopic meaning it will attract
water<00:04:14.980> and<00:04:15.430> therefore<00:04:16.060> create<00:04:16.390> a<00:04:16.419> damp

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
water and therefore create a damp

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.650 
water and therefore create a damp
environment<00:04:17.470> for<00:04:17.650> mold<00:04:17.799> to<00:04:18.010> grow<00:04:18.100> but<00:04:18.850> having

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
environment for mold to grow but having

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.449 
environment for mold to grow but having
a<00:04:19.750> microwave<00:04:20.260> to<00:04:20.440> hand<00:04:20.650> means<00:04:20.979> that<00:04:21.160> you<00:04:21.250> can

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:21.459 
a microwave to hand means that you can

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:23.880 
a microwave to hand means that you can
keep<00:04:21.640> putting<00:04:22.270> in<00:04:22.479> the<00:04:22.570> microwave<00:04:22.990> and<00:04:23.320> then

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:23.890 
keep putting in the microwave and then

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:27.510 
keep putting in the microwave and then
when<00:04:24.490> it's<00:04:24.669> decorated<00:04:25.919> sealing<00:04:26.919> it

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
when it's decorated sealing it

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.839 
when it's decorated sealing it
and<00:04:27.639> with<00:04:28.090> either<00:04:29.080> you<00:04:29.620> know<00:04:29.800> mutt<00:04:30.069> varnish

00:04:30.839 --> 00:04:30.849 
and with either you know mutt varnish

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:33.540 
and with either you know mutt varnish
for<00:04:31.479> beeswax<00:04:32.229> but<00:04:32.650> making<00:04:33.129> sure<00:04:33.340> it's

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
for beeswax but making sure it's

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:36.390 
for beeswax but making sure it's
thoroughly<00:04:33.970> sealed<00:04:34.599> and<00:04:35.289> then<00:04:35.530> the<00:04:35.860> butt<00:04:36.039> mold

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 
thoroughly sealed and then the butt mold

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:41.129 
thoroughly sealed and then the butt mold
can't<00:04:37.240> get<00:04:37.479> in<00:04:37.599> so<00:04:39.270> I'll<00:04:40.270> show<00:04:40.599> you<00:04:40.659> the<00:04:40.870> next

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:41.139 
can't get in so I'll show you the next

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:44.250 
can't get in so I'll show you the next
stage<00:04:41.319> by
