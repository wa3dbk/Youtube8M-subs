it<00:01:55.070> kind<00:01:55.250> of<00:01:55.340> traits<00:01:55.580> better<00:01:56.320> you<00:01:57.320> don't<00:01:57.470> need

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
it kind of traits better you don't need

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.249 
it kind of traits better you don't need
to<00:01:57.860> use<00:01:58.070> a<00:01:58.100> high<00:01:58.520> volume<00:01:58.700> drug<00:01:59.420> site<00:01:59.690> if<00:02:00.020> you're

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:00.259 
to use a high volume drug site if you're

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:05.350 
to use a high volume drug site if you're
leaving<00:02:00.649> it<00:02:00.740> really<00:02:01.130> tiny<00:02:02.000> like<00:02:02.299> this<00:02:04.360> so

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
leaving it really tiny like this so

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:06.880 
leaving it really tiny like this so
basically<00:02:05.479> if<00:02:05.840> sort<00:02:06.050> of<00:02:06.140> leaving<00:02:06.380> your<00:02:06.649> weave

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
basically if sort of leaving your weave

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.990 
basically if sort of leaving your weave
just<00:02:08.530> fold<00:02:09.530> it<00:02:09.769> up<00:02:09.800> it<00:02:10.220> does<00:02:10.369> not<00:02:10.550> matter<00:02:10.789> how

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
just fold it up it does not matter how

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.320 
just fold it up it does not matter how
you<00:02:11.060> fold<00:02:11.360> a<00:02:11.540> as<00:02:11.630> long<00:02:11.870> as<00:02:12.050> they<00:02:12.200> are<00:02:12.350> covered

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.150 

so<00:02:17.330> can<00:02:17.510> I<00:02:17.540> leave<00:02:17.840> that<00:02:18.110> out<00:02:18.380> and<00:02:18.890> now<00:02:19.069> I'm

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
so can I leave that out and now I'm

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.630 
so can I leave that out and now I'm
going<00:02:19.310> to<00:02:19.400> weave<00:02:19.580> my<00:02:19.610> weave<00:02:21.010> and<00:02:22.010> it's<00:02:22.160> a<00:02:22.280> very

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
going to weave my weave and it's a very

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.070 
going to weave my weave and it's a very
very<00:02:22.730> very<00:02:23.060> fine<00:02:23.180> sections<00:02:25.750> and<00:02:26.750> this<00:02:26.870> will

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
very very fine sections and this will

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.340 
very very fine sections and this will
make<00:02:27.319> the<00:02:27.860> hair<00:02:28.100> blend<00:02:28.700> in<00:02:29.060> much<00:02:29.720> better<00:02:30.019> with

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
make the hair blend in much better with

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:41.620 
make the hair blend in much better with
the<00:02:30.470> finer<00:02:30.680> sections

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.580 

you<00:02:42.630> know<00:02:42.690> when<00:02:42.810> the<00:02:42.900> hairs<00:02:43.080> long<00:02:43.260> like<00:02:43.440> this

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
you know when the hairs long like this

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.070 
you know when the hairs long like this
and<00:02:43.770> it's<00:02:43.860> hanging<00:02:44.069> over<00:02:44.430> the<00:02:44.670> side<00:02:45.630> you<00:02:45.870> just

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
and it's hanging over the side you just

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.040 
and it's hanging over the side you just
sort<00:02:46.319> of<00:02:46.970> spaghetti<00:02:47.970> it<00:02:48.150> it<00:02:48.540> just<00:02:48.720> sort<00:02:48.989> of

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
sort of spaghetti it it just sort of

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:57.750 
sort of spaghetti it it just sort of
swirl<00:02:49.380> it<00:02:49.590> around

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:03.700 

again<00:02:58.760> I'm<00:02:58.910> going<00:02:59.030> to<00:02:59.120> leave<00:02:59.360> it<00:03:02.500> and<00:03:03.500> now<00:03:03.620> I'm

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:03.710 
again I'm going to leave it and now I'm

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:08.560 
again I'm going to leave it and now I'm
going<00:03:03.860> to<00:03:03.950> leave<00:03:04.130> my<00:03:04.430> weave<00:03:06.640> and<00:03:07.640> it's<00:03:08.150> still

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.570 
going to leave my weave and it's still

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:11.740 
going to leave my weave and it's still
too<00:03:08.750> thick<00:03:08.780> I'm<00:03:09.200> going<00:03:09.320> to<00:03:09.410> do<00:03:09.470> it<00:03:09.560> again<00:03:09.740> I<00:03:10.750> can

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
too thick I'm going to do it again I can

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.630 
too thick I'm going to do it again I can
actually<00:03:11.960> pick<00:03:12.350> it<00:03:12.470> up<00:03:12.620> and<00:03:12.920> I<00:03:12.980> can<00:03:13.160> see<00:03:13.310> that

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
actually pick it up and I can see that

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.270 
actually pick it up and I can see that
looks<00:03:13.880> really<00:03:14.300> thick<00:03:14.690> right<00:03:14.930> here<00:03:15.280> there's

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
looks really thick right here there's

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.040 
looks really thick right here there's
one<00:03:16.400> very<00:03:16.670> fine<00:03:17.060> sections<00:03:17.540> almost<00:03:17.930> like

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.050 
one very fine sections almost like

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:20.050

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:52.639 

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:56.230 

I'm<00:04:53.360> going<00:04:53.509> to<00:04:53.569> leave<00:04:53.689> this<00:04:53.900> again<00:04:55.060> you<00:04:56.060> think

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 
I'm going to leave this again you think

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.540 
I'm going to leave this again you think
just<00:04:56.419> a<00:04:56.599> little<00:04:56.840> bit<00:04:56.930> heavier<00:04:57.349> and<00:04:57.590> very<00:04:58.069> front

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 
just a little bit heavier and very front

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:15.330 
just a little bit heavier and very front
and<00:04:59.319> taking<00:05:00.319> out<00:05:00.469> somebody

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:15.340 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.030 

we're<00:05:16.210> taking<00:05:16.600> it<00:05:16.690> profile<00:05:17.260> like<00:05:17.470> this<00:05:17.740> it

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:18.040 
we're taking it profile like this it

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:21.690 
we're taking it profile like this it
also<00:05:18.250> goes<00:05:19.240> right<00:05:19.690> to<00:05:19.720> the<00:05:20.020> scalp<00:05:20.350> so<00:05:20.700> your

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:21.700 
also goes right to the scalp so your

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:22.980 
also goes right to the scalp so your
boots<00:05:21.880> aren't<00:05:22.060> going<00:05:22.240> to<00:05:22.300> come<00:05:22.450> out<00:05:22.570> as<00:05:22.750> fast

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:22.990 
boots aren't going to come out as fast

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:48.850 
boots aren't going to come out as fast
it'll<00:05:23.380> last<00:05:23.650> a<00:05:23.830> lot<00:05:23.980> longer

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:48.860 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:51.229 

now<00:05:49.860> I'm<00:05:50.099> just<00:05:50.279> going<00:05:50.429> to<00:05:50.489> be<00:05:50.610> doing<00:05:50.849> a<00:05:50.939> partial

00:05:51.229 --> 00:05:51.239 
now I'm just going to be doing a partial

00:05:51.239 --> 00:05:53.029 
now I'm just going to be doing a partial
so<00:05:51.659> I'm<00:05:51.749> only<00:05:51.869> going<00:05:52.049> to<00:05:52.110> be<00:05:52.169> doing<00:05:52.319> the<00:05:52.709> crown

00:05:53.029 --> 00:05:53.039 
so I'm only going to be doing the crown

00:05:53.039 --> 00:05:56.419 
so I'm only going to be doing the crown
right<00:05:53.309> in<00:05:53.489> here<00:05:53.729> because<00:05:55.069> natural<00:05:56.069> highlights

00:05:56.419 --> 00:05:56.429 
right in here because natural highlights

00:05:56.429 --> 00:05:58.879 
right in here because natural highlights
has<00:05:56.939> more<00:05:57.419> in<00:05:57.689> the<00:05:57.779> front<00:05:58.079> than<00:05:58.469> in<00:05:58.589> the<00:05:58.679> back

00:05:58.879 --> 00:05:58.889 
has more in the front than in the back

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:00.649 
has more in the front than in the back
because<00:05:59.309> you<00:05:59.579> want<00:05:59.729> to<00:05:59.879> look<00:05:59.999> like<00:06:00.149> the<00:06:00.329> Sun

00:06:00.649 --> 00:06:00.659 
because you want to look like the Sun

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:03.859 
because you want to look like the Sun
did<00:06:00.929> it<00:06:01.079> so<00:06:01.799> leaving<00:06:02.279> it<00:06:02.519> sort<00:06:03.089> of<00:06:03.179> darker<00:06:03.719> as

00:06:03.859 --> 00:06:03.869 
did it so leaving it sort of darker as

00:06:03.869 --> 00:06:06.889 
did it so leaving it sort of darker as
it<00:06:03.899> goes<00:06:04.049> down<00:06:04.409> is<00:06:04.709> totally<00:06:05.039> fine<00:06:05.629> so<00:06:06.629> it<00:06:06.719> just

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:06.899 
it goes down is totally fine so it just

00:06:06.899 --> 00:06:12.609 
it goes down is totally fine so it just
sort<00:06:07.079> of<00:06:07.139> do<00:06:08.749> been<00:06:09.749> here<00:06:09.959> to<00:06:10.079> here<00:06:10.319> in<00:06:10.709> the<00:06:10.800> time

00:06:12.609 --> 00:06:12.619

and I want this real gradual so we're
going<00:06:16.019> to<00:06:16.079> take<00:06:16.229> superfine<00:06:17.159> pieces

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:46.090
