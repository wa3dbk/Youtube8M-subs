I<00:02:41.680> think<00:02:41.950> the<00:02:42.489> Microraptor<00:02:42.880> is<00:02:43.480> not<00:02:44.170> far<00:02:44.500> from

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
I think the Microraptor is not far from

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.210 
I think the Microraptor is not far from
the<00:02:45.730> first<00:02:46.000> bird<00:02:46.330> if<00:02:46.989> the<00:02:47.350> aerodynamic

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
feathers on the legs of Microraptor can

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.250 
feathers on the legs of Microraptor can
be<00:02:51.130> confirmed<00:02:51.670> with<00:02:52.120> additional<00:02:52.720> specimens

be confirmed with additional specimens

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.069 
be confirmed with additional specimens
then<00:02:54.250> Microraptor<00:02:55.180> will<00:02:55.330> certainly<00:02:55.690> go<00:02:55.870> down

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:56.079 
then Microraptor will certainly go down

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:58.259 
then Microraptor will certainly go down
