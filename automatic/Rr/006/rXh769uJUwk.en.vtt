00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
was just perfect as 200 kilobytes and

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.840 
was just perfect as 200 kilobytes and
also<00:01:07.530> try<00:01:07.740> to<00:01:07.799> get<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.040> dimensions<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.670> same

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
also try to get the dimensions the same

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.899 
also try to get the dimensions the same
as<00:01:09.030> your<00:01:09.180> desktop<00:01:09.330> dimensions<00:01:10.140> so<00:01:10.830> it<00:01:11.549> looks<00:01:11.580> a

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
as your desktop dimensions so it looks a

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.760 
as your desktop dimensions so it looks a
little<00:01:12.360> better<00:01:12.600> if<00:01:12.840> it's<00:01:13.260> smaller<00:01:13.619> and

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
little better if it's smaller and

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.100 
little better if it's smaller and
dimension<00:01:14.340> what<00:01:14.490> Windows<00:01:15.270> was<00:01:15.600> going<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:15.960> do

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
dimension what Windows was going to do

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.420 
dimension what Windows was going to do
is<00:01:16.290> just<00:01:16.320> stretch<00:01:16.680> it<00:01:16.710> out<00:01:16.950> and<00:01:17.159> fill<00:01:17.310> the

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
is just stretch it out and fill the

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.789 
is just stretch it out and fill the
screen<00:01:17.700> so<00:01:18.659> you<00:01:18.750> might<00:01:18.930> get<00:01:19.020> some<00:01:19.080> distortion

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
screen so you might get some distortion

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.270 
screen so you might get some distortion
if<00:01:19.920> it's<00:01:20.070> too<00:01:20.310> small<00:01:21.140> alright<00:01:22.140> so<00:01:22.409> this<00:01:23.159> is

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
if it's too small alright so this is

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.740
