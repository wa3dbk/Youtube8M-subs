 Masu Tei multiplied by the number of interrupted 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.460
 I was busy 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.440
 Place 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:52.330
 This is the head I like something- 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.820
 It is like this 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.550
 This is connected out of the house, but on the left 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.350
 And the right ear 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.810

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:40.619
 I Toka parts of the portion of the stroke of Oni ne 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:42.210
 The rest is for charging with usb 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:47.560
 this 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:51.490
 ys 8 is also heavyweight, so it 's a wire for charging 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:54.450
 Here is the left side 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.150
 It is on the left side of here- 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:03.060
 8 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:05.810
 Here it is for charging usb palace 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.810
 There is a terminal 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:17.290
 This is it 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:20.500
 Connect us and connect usb terminal for 10 years 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:23.590
 The lid is closed quite well 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.670
 But it is place to put on the right side 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:29.989
 Here 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:35.900
 There is a button to switch the general of the volume 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:40.280
 You can turn on the power by turning on this button for a long time with the button plan here and vice versa 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:41.700
 Multifunction button to turn off the power This is the button here 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.530
 It was try in 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.530
 Sudo power turns on for 1 second 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:59.840
 It is in this kind of Fu because Yes and we have entered into such a condition does not now pairing 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:04.040
 I am shiny and interesting 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:08.650
 Well then this is the first time, but using the apple dynasty 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.650
 I would like to pair 0 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:21.460
 Tap the Tteyuu in bluetooth 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:25.830
 That ttb h 06 of meat to take Then is it the other has been paired with 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:25.830
 I will pass through this to tone 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.890
 This was connected to completion 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:51.270
 It would have played the role of the battery indicator, perhaps at a little while ago 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:56.580
 It is the after Yes in this 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:58.310
 The fact that it will be able to play songs that are in the approach will actually be installed next 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:03.800
 I would like to do 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:08.330
 If you are with that child volumes Toka power hydrogen is the right-hand side 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:12.290
 I don't have a lot of right-handed people on the north sun, but I'm not too indifferent 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:15.800
 Right-hand movie is on the third floor with everyone on the right 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:19.040
 It we have that Katsui a knob volume 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:22.670
 I think it is easy to put it on the right side 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:26.690
 The first is do or Solving Tan Tsukeru how do I is not terribly difficult 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:29.710
 At first I put on my neck 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.710
 It is with this kind of feeling 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:35.370
 Like this 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:44.680
 I will go for 3 days 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.680
 At high temperature 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:56.060
 It's like this, so it's a neck 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:56.060
 I have a strap 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:59.420
 Such Fu 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:03.480
 But it was N cat 

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:07.220
 Yes 

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:09.060
 Well then I don't really hear the sound but 4 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:11.830
 It is this apple watch 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:15.670
 I want to play a sound 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:21.090
 Yes I actually heard the sound 

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:23.030
 I think that I really bass are spawning also I think we seed the central Naa out well 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:29.540
 that 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:34.550
 I feel that I wonder if facing in what items Kana still lock Toka such amount 

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:36.500
 Toka or can it is if touched here in very even raise or lower Toka next empty Toka of volume 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:42.920
 I think that it is convenient to 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:48.610
 It's a place to put on too Well I 'm getting very like this and getting addicted well 

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:48.610
 I think that this wonder if not it good feeling going into a jerk say 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:51.669
 Shall we turn off the power? 

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:59.780
 Has been There are those who got off in this 

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:12.600
 It says that in a state that can be used in this 

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:18.620
 Well I think I might actually want to use walking or learning 

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:21.740
 Very lightly it is in well short over the neck a in is the speaker 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:25.580
 This way you can run and walk iphone Without iphone 

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:27.580
 The approach staff can also flow, so it is normal 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:33.310
 with apple watch 

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:36.729
 I feel like I can jog with this speaker 

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:41.199
 Oh, let's see what we do here 

00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:47.600
 You can say Gosogoso is I'm slightly firm I think that it is the way of this probably installed 

00:06:41.199 --> 00:06:51.170
 You will be rewarded and to enter the Toka in the individual deficiencies in that Tteyuu snare of sound Toka Dosudosu 

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:53.570
 Somehow in this device that I thought I try to kinda do I that I wonder it is kept at least 

00:06:51.170 --> 00:07:00.190
 I feel like I should not be 

00:06:53.570 --> 00:07:06.820
 Hae-I tried to use it Well that's quite together 

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:08.680
 I thought that the bass and medium noise often come out, but even if you raise the volume, it's the No. Sushi sushi coming feeling 

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:14.620
 I thought it was a speaker 

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:17.080
 Well, I know whether it is good to use it now or when it is time to go to work when I say landing and so on 

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:20.210
 This also Toka when I'm not commuting 

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:24.060
 It can be easily used in high groups 

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:29.550
 I thought it might be good 

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:33.150
 It is in you was cheap also very price in this is quite cost-effective high 

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:33.870
 Wasteful and I think I was pretty similar things in more than 1 million of those in or around or Toka to do 

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:37.449
 but 

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:41.639
 I think that good to that try are various comparison 

00:07:37.449 --> 00:07:46.580
