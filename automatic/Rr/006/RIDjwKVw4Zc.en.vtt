00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.300
 Welcome to our phone-uh President today Galaxy s3 Eve Bar 

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:15.160
 I'll try to put it in at the time of Moon. 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:18.430
 First of all, I am now in the fingerprint recognition screen when the market sucks and the iPhone 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:24.130
 I'll explain the sociality in 5s . 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:26.860
 What I actually saw on the screen was the blush spy fingerprint function and the iPhone 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:31.689
 I thought the class was the same. 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:36.010
 When you've registered Konkuk University to improve the quality of exercise several times yoreotge iPhone 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:40.899
 I got the car 5s and Galaxy s5 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:42.070
 Algon 8 Benson is to learn 2 Tables Learn what Reckoning looks like 

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:46.059
 Walking 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.500
 Galaxy s5 think is going to have a different language, so just remember 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:52.660
 If the 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:56.050
 When you do eight in the same way, the profit margin does not increase significantly 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:01:01.120
 I'll show you. 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:03.579
 He just memorized it as it is. 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:10.510
 Because of one finger 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:15.700
 Now, as well as several yoreotge several other fingers 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:22.180
 Well this time it will be registered to register 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:24.930
 So instead of one-finger eight-pointed protest, eight other fingers 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.930
 Let the input 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:35.320
 It's about recognition. 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:37.950
 Ah Yes bowl but also lead 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.950
 Recognize 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:48.079
 So you guys are now supported 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:51.500
 Like the iPhone 4, the air just when you register something that the number of multiple 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:54.930
 You can see that popularity does not increase 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:58.730
 In fact, the recognition required height Shinramyun 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:02.840
 Oh right, leaving ohgetda 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:04.640
 Now there is 3 to 5 that the damper on 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:10.100
 Three 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:12.540
 When you register, you can use other fingers and so on 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:17.689
 When you think 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:25.319
 You can do it by putting your fingers up to 24 . 

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:29.420
 Another is not to dalgeona just floating to the height of a ten years have Dumaguete 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:29.420
 Through many things you can do 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:38.230
 From another angle to another 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:42.459
 You have to be aware of 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:45.000
 It seems that the recognition rate will be higher if you store it in various ways . 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:45.000
 How did you do it? 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:54.800
 So we can do this in a wide variety of angles 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:58.670
 When you enter the same finger 24 times 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:04.030
 The recognition rate was high. 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:09.470
 It is still possible to do this, so when you do this in the id 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:12.770
 Because many times when the state does not love touching it 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:17.600
 I have to be superstitious . 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:19.490
 Now that I have used it several times , 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:24.200
 I could raise it. 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:27.230
 It is something to one before me always the same 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:31.670
 I 've been practicing to open up. 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:37.400
 And a common number i8 when the bath is full 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:39.020
 So evenly, the anchor fingers can do all of this. 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:44.330
 I have increased the timing 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:47.630
 I have to say that it is a high recognition rate for a child, but I do practice 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:53.690
 I'm so rattling deoraguyo 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:56.540
 In any case, as you saw that the iPhone 5s and Galaxy s5 between keeping 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:04:02.540
 This huge station hasiguyo different 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:05.630
 Of you now whether you use a misty face more questions from the Galaxy s5 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:10.550
 A little more height and 20 c of this site 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:15.080
 Please if you have to change things so the little toad register 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:18.730
 I think that's why I appreciate the people who sent me through today. 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.730
 These happy Can I come today Joowon
