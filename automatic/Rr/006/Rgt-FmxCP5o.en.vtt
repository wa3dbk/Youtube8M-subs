00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
this I was really worried about drying

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.380 
this I was really worried about drying
that<00:01:25.830> I've<00:01:26.070> heard<00:01:26.310> Pete<00:01:26.580> other<00:01:26.790> people<00:01:27.210> stay

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
that I've heard Pete other people stay

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.970 
that I've heard Pete other people stay
in<00:01:27.420> their<00:01:27.540> videos<00:01:27.810> that<00:01:28.200> it<00:01:28.320> dried<00:01:28.590> their<00:01:28.770> hair

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:28.980 
in their videos that it dried their hair

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:31.910 
in their videos that it dried their hair
out<00:01:29.010> I<00:01:29.430> haven't<00:01:30.150> had<00:01:30.300> that<00:01:30.330> problem<00:01:30.810> at<00:01:30.990> all<00:01:31.080> it

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
out I haven't had that problem at all it

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.450 
out I haven't had that problem at all it
does<00:01:32.400> feel<00:01:32.760> I<00:01:33.240> would<00:01:34.140> say<00:01:34.380> not<00:01:34.620> less<00:01:35.130> smooth

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
does feel I would say not less smooth

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.210 
does feel I would say not less smooth
but<00:01:35.760> it<00:01:36.260> does<00:01:37.260> feel<00:01:37.530> a<00:01:37.560> little<00:01:37.620> more<00:01:37.830> rough

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
but it does feel a little more rough

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.910 
but it does feel a little more rough
than<00:01:38.250> when<00:01:38.610> you<00:01:38.820> use<00:01:39.270> other<00:01:39.600> conditioners<00:01:40.200> but

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
than when you use other conditioners but

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.710 
than when you use other conditioners but
I<00:01:40.950> think<00:01:41.340> that's<00:01:41.520> part<00:01:41.880> of<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.150> products<00:01:42.690> that

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
I think that's part of the products that

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.260 
I think that's part of the products that
other<00:01:42.960> conditioners<00:01:43.680> put<00:01:44.010> in<00:01:44.310> to<00:01:44.940> make<00:01:45.120> your

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
other conditioners put in to make your

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.470 
other conditioners put in to make your
hair<00:01:45.450> full<00:01:45.690> more<00:01:45.930> greasy<00:01:46.650> and<00:01:46.770> smooth<00:01:47.240> this<00:01:48.240> is

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:48.480 
hair full more greasy and smooth this is

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.510 
hair full more greasy and smooth this is
more<00:01:48.720> natural<00:01:48.900> feeling<00:01:49.710> to<00:01:49.920> me<00:01:50.070> so<00:01:50.310> I<00:01:50.340> don't

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
more natural feeling to me so I don't

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.730 
more natural feeling to me so I don't
have<00:01:50.610> a<00:01:50.700> problem<00:01:51.030> with<00:01:51.180> that<00:01:51.450> i<00:01:51.720> would<00:01:52.350> really

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
have a problem with that i would really

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.310 
have a problem with that i would really
be<00:01:52.950> interested<00:01:53.160> in<00:01:53.490> purchasing<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:55.050> hair
