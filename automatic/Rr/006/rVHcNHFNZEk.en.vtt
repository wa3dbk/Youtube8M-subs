need to start this game up safe by the
way<00:01:21.180> curious<00:01:21.570> with<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.750> weird<00:01:21.990> opening<00:01:22.350> that

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
way curious with the weird opening that

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.550 
way curious with the weird opening that
me<00:01:22.799> curious<00:01:23.130> yeah<00:01:23.280> it's<00:01:23.880> very<00:01:24.060> curious<00:01:24.360> indeed

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
me curious yeah it's very curious indeed

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.190 
me curious yeah it's very curious indeed
with<00:01:25.560> a<00:01:25.590> fast<00:01:26.130> gas<00:01:26.700> now<00:01:27.450> this<00:01:27.479> is<00:01:27.869> going<00:01:28.020> to<00:01:28.080> be

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
with a fast gas now this is going to be

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.469 
with a fast gas now this is going to be
likely<00:01:28.590> just<00:01:28.860> reserving<00:01:29.400> speed<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:29.909> the

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
likely just reserving speed and the

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:31.940 
likely just reserving speed and the
probe<00:01:30.720> knows<00:01:30.960> about<00:01:31.170> this<00:01:31.380> so<00:01:31.619> he's<00:01:31.770> going<00:01:31.890> to

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
probe knows about this so he's going to

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.920 
probe knows about this so he's going to
go<00:01:32.070> forage<00:01:32.460> before<00:01:32.880> next<00:01:33.390> is<00:01:33.570> so<00:01:33.659> we<00:01:33.720> can<00:01:33.840> he

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
go forage before next is so we can he

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.210 
go forage before next is so we can he
make<00:01:34.079> sure<00:01:34.110> he<00:01:34.229> has<00:01:34.350> enough<00:01:34.409> cans<00:01:34.860> up<00:01:35.040> so<00:01:35.130> you

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
make sure he has enough cans up so you

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.640 
make sure he has enough cans up so you
can<00:01:35.310> prepare<00:01:35.700> well<00:01:35.909> not<00:01:36.869> stopping<00:01:37.439> for<00:01:37.619> a

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
can prepare well not stopping for a

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.350 
can prepare well not stopping for a
second<00:01:38.220> though<00:01:38.310> with<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.579> probe<00:01:38.790> arrest<00:01:39.090> this

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
second though with the probe arrest this

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.539 
second though with the probe arrest this
is<00:01:39.479> actually<00:01:39.840> really<00:01:40.140> well<00:01:40.409> done<00:01:40.619> by<00:01:41.250> rain<00:01:41.520> and

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
is actually really well done by rain and

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.190 
is actually really well done by rain and
he's<00:01:41.790> doing<00:01:42.090> it<00:01:42.299> on<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.479> closed<00:01:42.689> patch<00:01:42.930> which

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
he's doing it on the closed patch which

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.719 
he's doing it on the closed patch which
means<00:01:43.409> a<00:01:43.530> curious<00:01:43.829> losing<00:01:44.130> a<00:01:44.189> lot<00:01:44.340> of<00:01:44.399> mining

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
year ago the safest surg opening that he

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.550 
year ago the safest surg opening that he
could<00:01:53.970> have<00:01:54.149> every<00:01:54.540> survey<00:01:54.990> would<00:01:55.170> have<00:01:55.320> start

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
could have every survey would have start

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.399 
could have every survey would have start
off<00:01:55.740> with<00:01:56.009> fifa<00:01:56.399> 14<00:01:56.700> gansan<00:01:57.540> pool<00:01:57.750> to<00:01:58.170> get<00:01:58.290> the

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
off with fifa 14 gansan pool to get the

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.560 
off with fifa 14 gansan pool to get the
speed<00:01:58.680> out<00:01:58.890> early<00:01:59.310> and<00:01:59.490> at<00:01:59.759> some<00:02:00.060> points<00:02:00.420> are

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
speed out early and at some points are

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.719 
speed out early and at some points are
clear<00:02:00.810> figured<00:02:01.170> out<00:02:01.290> well<00:02:01.500> my<00:02:02.159> opponent<00:02:02.460> is

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
clear figured out well my opponent is

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.280 
clear figured out well my opponent is
playing<00:02:02.820> really<00:02:03.180> safely<00:02:03.689> he's<00:02:03.869> trying<00:02:04.140> to<00:02:04.200> get

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
playing really safely he's trying to get

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.050 
playing really safely he's trying to get
an<00:02:04.409> expansion<00:02:04.950> he<00:02:05.040> will<00:02:05.159> defend<00:02:05.490> it<00:02:05.610> i<00:02:05.729> can't

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
an expansion he will defend it i can't

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.550 
an expansion he will defend it i can't
really<00:02:06.329> do<00:02:06.450> all<00:02:06.659> that<00:02:06.810> much<00:02:06.960> with<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.290> speed

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
really do all that much with the speed

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.100 
really do all that much with the speed
so<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:07.770> time<00:02:08.310> that<00:02:08.520> i<00:02:08.550> have<00:02:08.819> to<00:02:08.970> spend<00:02:09.239> to<00:02:09.629> get

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
so the time that i have to spend to get

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.869 
so the time that i have to spend to get
the<00:02:10.289> gas<00:02:10.470> that's<00:02:11.129> something<00:02:11.459> that<00:02:11.489> i<00:02:11.640> missed

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
the gas that's something that i missed

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.250 
the gas that's something that i missed
when<00:02:12.030> it<00:02:12.120> comes<00:02:12.270> down<00:02:12.450> to<00:02:12.510> the<00:02:12.810> mineral<00:02:13.050> in

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
when it comes down to the mineral in

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.860 
when it comes down to the mineral in
come<00:02:13.379> so<00:02:13.680> moles<00:02:14.250> work<00:02:14.549> players<00:02:14.909> try<00:02:15.239> to<00:02:15.299> go<00:02:15.510> for

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
come so moles work players try to go for

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.350 
come so moles work players try to go for
a<00:02:15.900> spawning<00:02:16.439> pool<00:02:16.769> no<00:02:17.340> gas<00:02:17.640> and<00:02:17.970> transition

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
a spawning pool no gas and transition

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.270 
a spawning pool no gas and transition
into<00:02:18.480> an<00:02:18.629> expansion<00:02:19.170> and<00:02:19.560> with<00:02:19.709> curious<00:02:20.099> not

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
into an expansion and with curious not

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.250 
into an expansion and with curious not
going<00:02:20.549> for<00:02:20.760> an<00:02:20.819> early<00:02:20.939> speed<00:02:21.390> i'm<00:02:21.569> really

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
going for an early speed i'm really

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.899 
going for an early speed i'm really
interested<00:02:22.560> in<00:02:22.799> what<00:02:22.920> exactly<00:02:23.430> he's<00:02:23.549> up<00:02:23.730> to

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:23.909 
interested in what exactly he's up to

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:25.880 
interested in what exactly he's up to
because<00:02:24.450> he<00:02:24.629> is<00:02:24.780> still<00:02:25.019> mining<00:02:25.379> gas<00:02:25.530> but<00:02:25.769> now

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
because he is still mining gas but now

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.589 
because he is still mining gas but now
we<00:02:26.069> could<00:02:26.220> see<00:02:26.400> baneling<00:02:26.790> bust<00:02:26.819> we<00:02:27.239> could<00:02:27.420> see

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 
we could see baneling bust we could see

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:29.479 
we could see baneling bust we could see
a<00:02:27.629> fast<00:02:27.989> tech<00:02:28.319> but<00:02:28.650> what<00:02:28.799> he<00:02:28.860> definitely<00:02:29.159> wants

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
a fast tech but what he definitely wants

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:31.280 
a fast tech but what he definitely wants
to<00:02:29.579> achieve<00:02:29.670> this<00:02:30.030> chase<00:02:30.450> down<00:02:30.780> the<00:02:31.049> store

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
to achieve this chase down the store

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:32.390 
to achieve this chase down the store
would<00:02:31.409> make<00:02:31.590> sure<00:02:31.739> that<00:02:31.890> there's<00:02:32.040> no<00:02:32.129> scouting

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
would make sure that there's no scouting

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.970 
would make sure that there's no scouting
exactly<00:02:33.239> now<00:02:33.390> he<00:02:33.450> the<00:02:33.599> probe<00:02:33.959> did<00:02:34.290> check<00:02:34.650> the

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
exactly now he the probe did check the

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.250 
exactly now he the probe did check the
gas<00:02:35.159> mining<00:02:35.549> and<00:02:35.879> at<00:02:36.120> that<00:02:36.299> time<00:02:36.360> he<00:02:36.930> had<00:02:37.019> hold

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
gas mining and at that time he had hold

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.960 
gas mining and at that time he had hold
drones<00:02:37.530> out<00:02:37.709> he<00:02:38.190> pulled<00:02:38.430> them<00:02:38.489> out<00:02:38.610> one<00:02:38.819> by<00:02:38.849> one

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
drones out he pulled them out one by one

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.910 
drones out he pulled them out one by one
and<00:02:39.299> he<00:02:39.390> saw<00:02:39.629> one<00:02:39.870> drone<00:02:40.140> in<00:02:40.290> the<00:02:40.349> gas<00:02:40.530> and<00:02:40.829> then

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
and he saw one drone in the gas and then

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.009 
and he saw one drone in the gas and then
he<00:02:41.310> left<00:02:41.489> and<00:02:41.790> now<00:02:42.150> he<00:02:42.209> doesn't<00:02:42.450> know<00:02:42.720> what's

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
he left and now he doesn't know what's

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:44.360 
he left and now he doesn't know what's
happening<00:02:43.319> the<00:02:43.409> probe<00:02:43.590> comes<00:02:43.769> back<00:02:43.980> in<00:02:44.129> here

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
happening the probe comes back in here

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:45.800 
happening the probe comes back in here
he's<00:02:44.670> gonna<00:02:44.790> see<00:02:45.000> no<00:02:45.150> natural<00:02:45.480> but<00:02:45.599> he<00:02:45.659> will

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
he's gonna see no natural but he will

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.380 
he's gonna see no natural but he will
see<00:02:46.019> the<00:02:46.049> drone<00:02:46.440> and<00:02:47.040> this<00:02:47.849> is<00:02:47.970> gonna<00:02:48.090> lead<00:02:48.299> him

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
see the drone and this is gonna lead him

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:49.819 
see the drone and this is gonna lead him
to<00:02:48.450> believe<00:02:48.569> as<00:02:48.900> a<00:02:48.930> hatchery<00:02:49.140> will<00:02:49.440> in<00:02:49.530> fact<00:02:49.680> be

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:49.829 
to believe as a hatchery will in fact be

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
planted probe is taken out and curious

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.199 
planted probe is taken out and curious
is<00:02:52.530> actually<00:02:53.220> not<00:02:53.549> going<00:02:53.700> to<00:02:53.819> be<00:02:53.879> making<00:02:54.000> this

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
is actually not going to be making this

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:55.520 
is actually not going to be making this
at<00:02:54.359> all<00:02:54.450> he's<00:02:54.599> gonna<00:02:54.720> be<00:02:54.870> doing<00:02:54.959> for<00:02:55.139> the<00:02:55.230> super

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
at all he's gonna be doing for the super

cool<00:03:17.400> is<00:03:17.609> because<00:03:18.060> curious<00:03:18.959> is<00:03:19.230> going<00:03:19.620> for

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:19.889 
cool is because curious is going for

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:21.500 
cool is because curious is going for
very<00:03:20.099> aggressive<00:03:20.609> field<00:03:20.819> and<00:03:21.030> he<00:03:21.180> relies<00:03:21.480> on

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
very aggressive field and he relies on

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.009 
very aggressive field and he relies on
the<00:03:22.199> assumption<00:03:22.799> that<00:03:22.980> rain<00:03:23.819> is<00:03:24.030> not<00:03:24.389> able<00:03:24.690> to

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
the assumption that rain is not able to

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:26.900 
the assumption that rain is not able to
adapt<00:03:25.319> to<00:03:25.470> this<00:03:25.620> just<00:03:25.889> as<00:03:26.040> well<00:03:26.250> rain<00:03:26.639> didn't

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
adapt to this just as well rain didn't

so<00:03:28.889> far<00:03:28.919> as<00:03:29.280> skewers<00:03:29.609> yet<00:03:29.819> so<00:03:29.970> curious<00:03:30.359> is<00:03:30.599> way

00:03:31.369 --> 00:03:31.379 
so far as skewers yet so curious is way

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:32.720 
so far as skewers yet so curious is way
better<00:03:31.590> known<00:03:31.859> with<00:03:32.040> those<00:03:32.160> timings<00:03:32.430> and

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
better known with those timings and

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.970 
better known with those timings and
there's<00:03:33.269> only<00:03:33.419> one<00:03:33.540> cannon<00:03:34.049> out<00:03:34.199> so<00:03:34.590> the<00:03:34.769> ball

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
there's only one cannon out so the ball

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.920 
there's only one cannon out so the ball
is<00:03:35.160> really<00:03:35.609> really<00:03:35.940> vulnerable<00:03:36.209> and<00:03:36.599> this<00:03:36.750> is

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
is really really vulnerable and this is

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.199 
is really really vulnerable and this is
a<00:03:37.049> huge<00:03:37.379> ramp<00:03:37.680> this<00:03:37.919> is<00:03:38.129> very<00:03:38.340> possible<00:03:38.639> it's

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
a huge ramp this is very possible it's

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:42.050 
a huge ramp this is very possible it's
it's<00:03:39.540> not<00:03:39.810> even<00:03:39.989> four<00:03:40.169> walled<00:03:40.410> off<00:03:40.669> you<00:03:41.669> may<00:03:41.819> go

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
it's not even four walled off you may go

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.550 
it's not even four walled off you may go

for the pylon if you wants to actually
attack<00:03:44.280> it's<00:03:44.489> probably<00:03:44.699> an<00:03:44.790> approach<00:03:45.030> the
