 working in Spanish was a grip mc 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.850
 of the newest developers there 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.380
 hired this year decided to post a 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.230
 thing about series galera that is the 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.670
 His specialty is good that he spoke 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.700
 now he said the following 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.100
 I improved the list of games them and it 's him 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:51.539
 automatically fills the title and 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:53.190
 online status is coming in one MCP 00:11 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.449
 People who do not understand will go 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.440
 open here and I will give you a 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.360
 better explanation 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.879
 Now what does he mean? 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:03.690
 simply when you put the ip of the 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.210
 server simply it goes it goes 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.780
 put the server name 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.729
 automatically as you can see 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.920
 here is the name of the server from here life 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.740
 embeds sg yes guys 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.770
 You no longer need to rename the serv 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.659
 it will simply rename itself and 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.820
 you may realize that also underneath 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.430
 That will now be marked here. 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.100
 online or offline 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:29.400
 now it 's kind of a cool thing 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:32.970
 For people who play with friends because 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.880
 the service lbs gmpv for example are 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.560
 usually always online then the most 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.770
 interesting is for people who play in 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:44.189
 series of friends know when they are 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.110
 online and when they are not good have more 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.090
 some curious things here in the picture 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.909
 which is not the focus of the post 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.340
 but I decided to show you the good 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.979
 first thing is that now as you 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:59.219
 can see it already showing here 0.1 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:03.960
 11.0 alphahmi 1 and is already showing which 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:07.619
 o the device he is using in this 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:10.379
 photo he is using a lg nex 5 now 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.430
 yes the nexus 5 leave google in partnership 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.240
 with the lg 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.330
 so you can see 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.710
 practically finished everything ready for 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.750
 0.11 exit 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:22.060
 hope that in the coming weeks 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.550
 to leave guys have a very strong guess 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.370
 that can leave on the 30th because it is a 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.320
 monday and the bires usually leave 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.050
 on Mondays and the next 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:33.940
 Monday is the 30th day of March 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:36.790
 as they had said late March 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:39.550
 would throw 10 points so we waited 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.450
 there and hopefully even be the Day 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.190
 launch 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.080
 besides we can now see here 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.480
 also that we have here in the normal world 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.940
 a marking so galera is an icon 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.610

 creative neighborhood you will be able to exchange and 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:14.350
 It is also necessary to change the name 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:16.630
 without changing anything in folders 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:18.940
 or in applications and external 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:21.070

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:24.280
 some here to show you, right? 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.360

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:34.030

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:37.030

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:46.570

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.380
 boy for people asking for 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.480
 servers can add the counter and 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:58.390
 a player on top of the Serbian title and 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:01.060
 put colors there is no big deal but 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:02.770
 It's good, it's no big deal, and that's great. 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.300
 that 's what this means 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:07.330

 as I just showed you are the 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:16.150
 servers may make use of markup 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:18.820
 yes, I'll put it here in this space 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:21.040
 blank will be able to put that when 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:23.229
 the players have online is not good and also 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:25.639
 can change the colors of the words then 

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:27.680
 It's going to look really bad, people. Imagine there. 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:29.479

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.669

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:34.340

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:37.129
 enter the one that has less crowded and this 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:39.710
 It's just fuck, people, it's going to 

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:41.779
 help a lot is we chose not to 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:44.150
 to play at the time it was recorded 

00:04:41.779 --> 00:04:45.770
 for example we want to be less crowded 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:47.509
