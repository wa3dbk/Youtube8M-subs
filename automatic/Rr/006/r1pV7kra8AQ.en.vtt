00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
instead of having the torch key off to

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:22.880 
instead of having the torch key off to
the<00:00:21.210> side<00:00:21.420> like<00:00:21.449> maybe<00:00:21.810> over<00:00:22.050> here<00:00:22.470> or<00:00:22.680> maybe

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
whole entire toggleable torch key so if

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.199 
whole entire toggleable torch key so if
I<00:02:44.650> place<00:02:44.860> a<00:02:45.010> redstone<00:02:45.280> torch<00:02:45.430> or<00:02:45.760> even<00:02:46.000> a<00:02:46.060> piece

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
I place a redstone torch or even a piece

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:48.030 
I place a redstone torch or even a piece
of<00:02:46.330> redstone<00:02:46.480> dust<00:02:46.720> next<00:02:47.410> to<00:02:47.470> this<00:02:47.590> block<00:02:47.860> it

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
of redstone dust next to this block it

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.949 
of redstone dust next to this block it
will<00:02:48.160> update<00:02:48.400> this<00:02:48.730> piston<00:02:49.120> pushing<00:02:49.720> it<00:02:49.810> down

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
will update this piston pushing it down

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:51.570 
will update this piston pushing it down
so<00:02:50.110> if<00:02:50.200> we<00:02:50.260> place<00:02:50.470> a<00:02:50.500> torch<00:02:50.770> here<00:02:50.980> as<00:02:51.280> you<00:02:51.459> see

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
so if we place a torch here as you see

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.430 
so if we place a torch here as you see
it<00:02:51.700> goes<00:02:51.850> down<00:02:52.060> and<00:02:52.300> toggles<00:02:52.780> and<00:02:52.900> then<00:02:53.230> if<00:02:53.350> I

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
it goes down and toggles and then if I

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.110 
it goes down and toggles and then if I
put<00:02:53.680> a<00:02:53.709> redstone<00:02:54.040> torch<00:02:54.130> on<00:02:54.370> top<00:02:54.490> of<00:02:54.700> it<00:02:54.790> it

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
put a redstone torch on top of it it

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.550 
put a redstone torch on top of it it
will<00:02:55.420> close<00:02:55.630> it<00:02:55.900> and<00:02:56.020> that's<00:02:56.200> the<00:02:56.320> entire

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
will close it and that's the entire

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.140 
will close it and that's the entire
torch<00:02:56.890> key<00:02:57.070> guys<00:02:57.250> I<00:02:57.459> told<00:02:57.790> you<00:02:57.910> this<00:02:57.970> thing's

with a sand block on top of it this will

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.380 
with a sand block on top of it this will
create<00:06:24.530> our<00:06:24.740> monostable<00:06:25.580> circuit<00:06:26.090> so<00:06:26.180> if<00:06:26.300> you

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:26.390 
create our monostable circuit so if you

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:28.030 
create our monostable circuit so if you
see<00:06:26.540> if<00:06:26.660> I<00:06:26.720> press<00:06:26.930> this<00:06:27.169> we<00:06:27.530> just<00:06:27.710> get<00:06:27.830> a<00:06:27.860> quick

see if I press this we just get a quick

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:29.800 
see if I press this we just get a quick
bolt<00:06:28.370> then<00:06:28.610> coming<00:06:28.940> out<00:06:29.090> of<00:06:29.300> our<00:06:29.419> monostable

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:29.810 
bolt then coming out of our monostable

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:30.909 
bolt then coming out of our monostable
circle<00:06:30.140> we're<00:06:30.229> going<00:06:30.350> to<00:06:30.410> put<00:06:30.500> a<00:06:30.530> block<00:06:30.740> right

00:06:30.909 --> 00:06:30.919 
circle we're going to put a block right

00:06:30.919 --> 00:06:32.770 
circle we're going to put a block right
next<00:06:31.130> to<00:06:31.190> this<00:06:31.280> red<00:06:31.490> Sun<00:06:31.669> block<00:06:31.850> and<00:06:32.090> put<00:06:32.599> a

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:32.780 
next to this red Sun block and put a

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:34.690 
next to this red Sun block and put a
repeater<00:06:33.140> coming<00:06:33.680> out<00:06:33.860> of<00:06:34.010> the<00:06:34.099> sand<00:06:34.340> block

repeater coming out of the sand block

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:36.310 
repeater coming out of the sand block
just<00:06:35.090> like<00:06:35.240> that<00:06:35.390> and<00:06:35.630> it<00:06:35.690> will<00:06:35.810> activate<00:06:36.230> your
