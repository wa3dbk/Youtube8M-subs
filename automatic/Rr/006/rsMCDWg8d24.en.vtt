like amateur fighter in there the only

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.980 
like amateur fighter in there the only
great<00:00:45.000> maybe<00:00:45.240> we<00:00:45.360> didn't<00:00:45.570> see<00:00:45.660> a<00:00:45.690> little<00:00:45.870> bit

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:45.990 
great maybe we didn't see a little bit

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:47.180 
great maybe we didn't see a little bit
more<00:00:46.200> of<00:00:46.350> you<00:00:46.470> but<00:00:46.620> how<00:00:46.740> did<00:00:46.800> you<00:00:46.980> rate<00:00:47.100> your

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
more of you but how did you rate your

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.670 
more of you but how did you rate your
performance<00:00:47.870> probably<00:00:48.870> a<00:00:48.900> 6<00:00:49.170> out<00:00:49.380> of<00:00:49.410> 10<00:00:49.620> i

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
performance probably a 6 out of 10 i

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.990 
performance probably a 6 out of 10 i
didn't<00:00:50.100> get<00:00:50.190> out<00:00:50.310> of<00:00:50.490> a<00:00:50.630> second<00:00:51.630> gear<00:00:52.670> as<00:00:53.670> a<00:00:53.730> bit

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
didn't get out of a second gear as a bit

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.640 
didn't get out of a second gear as a bit
disappointing<00:00:54.540> if<00:00:54.600> anything<00:00:54.990> that<00:00:55.170> didn't<00:00:55.530> go

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:55.650 
disappointing if anything that didn't go

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:57.260 
disappointing if anything that didn't go
on<00:00:55.710> a<00:00:55.830> bit<00:00:55.980> longer<00:00:56.190> I<00:00:56.640> fought<00:00:56.880> with<00:00:57.000> all<00:00:57.150> the

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
on a bit longer I fought with all the

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.420 
on a bit longer I fought with all the
higher<00:00:57.480> plane<00:00:57.780> needle<00:00:58.140> I<00:00:58.320> think<00:00:58.980> called<00:00:59.250> a

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
higher plane needle I think called a

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.060 
higher plane needle I think called a
ball<00:00:59.610> a<00:00:59.760> little<00:01:00.030> bit<00:01:00.180> more<00:01:00.390> but<00:01:00.710> you<00:01:01.710> don't<00:01:01.920> get

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
ball a little bit more but you don't get

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.490 
ball a little bit more but you don't get
paid<00:01:02.220> for<00:01:02.250> overtime<00:01:02.430> so<00:01:03.090> I<00:01:03.330> said<00:01:04.110> I'm<00:01:04.199> happy

I think he was deaf and hearing David

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:40.700 
I think he was deaf and hearing David
Davis<00:01:38.670> there<00:01:38.850> so<00:01:39.119> hopefully<00:01:39.499> he's<00:01:40.499> been

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
Davis there so hopefully he's been
