00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.220 
with that I made some DIY wall decor so
I<00:00:19.920> recorded<00:00:20.340> that<00:00:20.580> and<00:00:21.090> I<00:00:21.570> want<00:00:21.930> to<00:00:22.020> show<00:00:22.170> you

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
I recorded that and I want to show you

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.630 
I recorded that and I want to show you
how<00:00:22.529> I<00:00:22.560> made<00:00:22.920> these<00:00:24.050> vinyl<00:00:25.099> butterflies<00:00:26.099> on<00:00:26.519> my

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
how I made these vinyl butterflies on my

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.779 
how I made these vinyl butterflies on my
wall<00:00:26.880> right<00:00:26.910> here<00:00:27.240> I<00:00:28.010> think<00:00:29.010> they're<00:00:29.490> pretty

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
wall right here I think they're pretty

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.810 
wall right here I think they're pretty
cool<00:00:29.910> and<00:00:30.480> I<00:00:31.109> found<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.769> idea<00:00:31.920> on<00:00:32.250> Pinterest

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
cool and I found the idea on Pinterest

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.900 
cool and I found the idea on Pinterest
so<00:00:32.969> I<00:00:33.030> don't<00:00:33.210> take<00:00:33.420> credit<00:00:33.600> for<00:00:33.870> that<00:00:34.700> but<00:00:35.700> um

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
so I don't take credit for that but um

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.569 
so I don't take credit for that but um
it<00:00:36.329> was<00:00:37.050> a<00:00:37.440> lot<00:00:37.710> easier<00:00:38.100> than<00:00:38.250> I<00:00:38.340> thought<00:00:38.370> it

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
it was a lot easier than I thought it

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.220 
it was a lot easier than I thought it
would<00:00:38.820> be<00:00:39.000> so<00:00:39.600> I<00:00:39.660> thought<00:00:39.930> I<00:00:39.989> would<00:00:40.110> just

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
would be so I thought I would just

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.840 
would be so I thought I would just
record<00:00:40.739> it<00:00:40.829> and<00:00:41.070> show<00:00:41.340> you<00:00:41.399> all<00:00:41.610> how<00:00:41.640> to<00:00:41.760> make

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
record it and show you all how to make

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:50.150 
record it and show you all how to make
it<00:00:47.899> so<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.050> first<00:00:49.260> thing<00:00:49.440> you'll<00:00:49.620> need<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:49.950> do

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
it so the first thing you'll need to do

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.000 
it so the first thing you'll need to do
is<00:00:50.460> get<00:00:50.879> records<00:00:51.149> I<00:00:51.629> bought<00:00:52.140> mine<00:00:52.350> for<00:00:52.590> 25

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
is get records I bought mine for 25

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
shape you like and then resize it a

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.369 
shape you like and then resize it a
couple<00:01:00.690> different<00:01:01.170> ways<00:01:02.539> next<00:01:03.539> just<00:01:03.899> simply

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
couple different ways next just simply

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.890 
couple different ways next just simply
outline<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.189> butterflies<00:01:05.670> onto<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.330> records

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
outline the butterflies onto the records

outline the butterflies onto the records
make<00:01:07.560> sure<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.890> hole<00:01:08.070> is<00:01:08.100> in<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.520> center<00:01:08.850> so

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
make sure the hole is in the center so

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:17.360 
make sure the hole is in the center so
you<00:01:09.119> can<00:01:09.240> put<00:01:09.750> a<00:01:09.780> thumbtack<00:01:10.110> in<00:01:10.470> it<00:01:10.590> later

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:17.370 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:19.680 

next<00:01:18.370> once<00:01:18.640> the<00:01:18.880> oven<00:01:19.030> is<00:01:19.270> already<00:01:19.450> preheated

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:19.690 
next once the oven is already preheated

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.070 
next once the oven is already preheated
to<00:01:20.410> 400<00:01:20.950> degrees<00:01:21.280> Fahrenheit<00:01:21.940> just<00:01:22.660> pop<00:01:22.900> the

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:23.080 
to 400 degrees Fahrenheit just pop the

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.150 
to 400 degrees Fahrenheit just pop the
record<00:01:23.410> in<00:01:23.560> the<00:01:23.710> oven<00:01:24.070> on<00:01:24.220> a<00:01:24.310> wrapped<00:01:24.880> foil<00:01:25.450> pan

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:26.160 
record in the oven on a wrapped foil pan

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:32.430 
record in the oven on a wrapped foil pan
for<00:01:27.160> 40<00:01:27.550> seconds<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:31.780> hardest<00:01:32.110> part<00:01:32.320> of

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:32.440 
for 40 seconds the hardest part of

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.110 
for 40 seconds the hardest part of
cutting<00:01:32.770> them<00:01:32.920> out<00:01:33.070> is<00:01:33.340> definitely<00:01:34.000> the

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:34.120 
cutting them out is definitely the

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.520 
cutting them out is definitely the
center<00:01:34.450> because<00:01:34.630> that's<00:01:34.900> the<00:01:35.110> part<00:01:35.350> that

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
center because that's the part that

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.070 
center because that's the part that
drives<00:01:35.680> the<00:01:36.040> fastest<00:01:36.580> the<00:01:37.300> sides<00:01:37.570> shouldn't

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.080 
drives the fastest the sides shouldn't

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.450 
drives the fastest the sides shouldn't
be<00:01:38.200> a<00:01:38.229> problem<00:01:38.440> because<00:01:38.950> they<00:01:39.070> fold<00:01:39.310> like

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
be a problem because they fold like

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.940 
be a problem because they fold like
rubber<00:01:40.080> but<00:01:41.080> you're<00:01:41.229> going<00:01:41.410> to<00:01:41.470> have<00:01:41.620> to<00:01:41.740> put

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
rubber but you're going to have to put

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.620 
rubber but you're going to have to put
it<00:01:42.040> in<00:01:42.160> and<00:01:42.370> out<00:01:42.430> of<00:01:42.610> the<00:01:42.700> oven<00:01:42.970> a<00:01:43.060> couple<00:01:43.390> times

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
it in and out of the oven a couple times

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:52.340 
it in and out of the oven a couple times
so<00:01:44.260> this<00:01:44.470> does<00:01:44.710> require<00:01:44.979> a<00:01:45.100> lot<00:01:45.340> of<00:01:45.400> patience

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.380 

once<00:01:53.350> your<00:01:53.530> butterfly<00:01:53.950> is<00:01:54.010> all<00:01:54.310> cut<00:01:54.610> out<00:01:54.640> all

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
once your butterfly is all cut out all

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.750 
once your butterfly is all cut out all
you<00:01:55.630> have<00:01:55.659> to<00:01:55.960> do<00:01:56.170> is<00:01:56.440> fold<00:01:56.890> both<00:01:57.220> the<00:01:57.520> wings

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:57.760 
you have to do is fold both the wings

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.330 
you have to do is fold both the wings
down<00:01:58.180> the<00:01:58.390> middle<00:01:58.630> so<00:01:59.200> they<00:01:59.320> fold<00:01:59.530> upwards<00:02:00.070> and

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
down the middle so they fold upwards and

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.730 
down the middle so they fold upwards and
then<00:02:00.820> curve<00:02:01.150> the<00:02:01.390> wings<00:02:01.570> outwards<00:02:02.200> to<00:02:02.470> make<00:02:02.590> it

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
then curve the wings outwards to make it

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:25.860 
then curve the wings outwards to make it
look<00:02:02.890> as<00:02:03.010> if<00:02:03.040> it's<00:02:03.340> flying<00:02:03.610> away

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.599 

now<00:02:26.870> once<00:02:27.200> all<00:02:27.379> your<00:02:27.590> butterflies<00:02:28.159> are<00:02:28.400> done

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:28.609 
now once all your butterflies are done

00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:30.819 
now once all your butterflies are done
just<00:02:28.849> stick<00:02:29.510> a<00:02:29.540> thumbtack<00:02:29.900> right<00:02:30.439> down<00:02:30.650> the

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:30.829 
just stick a thumbtack right down the

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:32.619 
just stick a thumbtack right down the
middle<00:02:30.859> where<00:02:31.549> the<00:02:31.579> hole<00:02:31.879> is<00:02:31.909> already<00:02:32.420> made

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:32.629 
middle where the hole is already made

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:34.809 
middle where the hole is already made
for<00:02:32.840> you<00:02:32.900> and<00:02:33.230> arrange<00:02:33.920> it<00:02:34.069> in<00:02:34.219> any<00:02:34.400> way<00:02:34.639> you'd
