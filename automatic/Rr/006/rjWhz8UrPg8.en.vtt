00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:37.400
 doing 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:40.430
 it's called virtual shopping between shopping 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:42.470
 and the beautiful because you can put the 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:46.750
 your things you can sell them buy 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:50.300
 definitely under the watchful eye of 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:52.250
 new start we're putting up for 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.680
 check that page those home to 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.690
 beats fake is sgam call eddy bathroom 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:00.650
 therefore at your own risk 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:03.290
 if you want anyway today I make a video 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:05.449
 unboxing and a boxing one 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.190
 unpacking so much for one 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:11.960
 splitter call it a script like 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:14.750
 you want the script was pretty much that 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:17.390
 thing and that thing that thing 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:20.240
 serves to attack and many headphones of a 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:23.140
 sol of corn so to afford you more 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:26.000
 entered his device or this 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:28.310
 splitter I bought today while 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.770
 back to the therapist you know how 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:33.080
 knows that I farm this incident here 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.730
 at the ankle and I am recovering I am 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.880
 of the vandal days doctor housing me not 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:39.770
 would like anything anyway 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.440
 this will be here that I purchased 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.690
 while I was coming back I found euro years 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:47.660
 pasta 15 euros in a crap there is a 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.730
 because tv was nothing i wanted i wanted 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:55.280
 do this has always connected a little 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:57.980
 cusco oled rai as cole sony elia is pur 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:01.670
 we are always just business and therefore 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:04.070
 I wanted to show you an ok little bag 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.440
 guys now we pass buy 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.390
 boxing of this skiability as they had 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:12.500
 said I already opened it to check 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:14.500
 15 and one of the rock star birkin here like 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:19.489
 you can see now that I open it 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:22.430
 then I triangle that I already have it 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:23.640
 open because the first piece I am 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.069
 manuals but 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.620
 where are they also because the boys are 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:30.810
 something quite trivial to use yes 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.650
 knows how to use it right away with the 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.510
 easy card 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.640
 the explanations are all behind how 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.290
 you can see then weight anyway 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.470
 written what you need 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:43.770
 logically I tell you already things not 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:47.280
 you make us an audio system so if there 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:49.350
 attack so many many speakers 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.959
 speakers so the sound goes down 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:54.810
 greatly so you can't make a 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:56.130
 sound system because you can 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.810
 listen to music for example the 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.180
 group with different things 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.850
 if for example in a hole as I tell you 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:05.790
 without the native school however in one 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:07.680
 hole you put yourself in taste 5 to 5 1 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:11.310
 write 5 more jackets to be connected to 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:14.760
 samsung ipod iphone and motorola device 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:17.130
 sony experiences are all inspired 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.900
 the ones you want and nothing to attack us 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.730
 music listened to me though 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.700
 the more more devices attached the more it lowers 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:26.580
 logically for that will send all to 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.709
 all headphones the amount of faces 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:32.180
 account in a page of sound g20 yes 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:34.560
 divide into uniform 5 is lowered understood 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:37.890
 therefore we do for example here I 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.260
 of dreams yesterday sony minyar I had 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:44.100
 taken for my sister because in series a 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:45.989
 read her then we have the ipod 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:48.420
 colors medicines invented randomly not 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:50.640
 I had to take everyone so then we have 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.440
 still stories with even the 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:55.110
 a little split jack in fact comes in half 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:58.130
 and then in the end we have flaps 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:02.489
 helps chris wood know that they are often 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:04.560
 most powerful I saw rai and so red nets 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:07.430
 no here as we are almost of the htc of the 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.230
 one that really is like 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:15.469
 they are really comfortable and similar we have 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:17.750
 supported and then finally the last ones 

00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:22.070
 even the studios are the last to say the least 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:24.259
 are of real study are so the 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:29.180
 old split all those companies 

00:04:24.259 --> 00:04:31.370
 well attacked I am practically inside 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.530
 I took all the bots 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:36.440
 for this for this thing because that 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:39.970
 iphone unfortunately register and see 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.970
 a little light up 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:55.699
 how can you hear some feel in the 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:55.699
 centers you will never feel or tell you 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:06.430
 perfect I hope you will hear now 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:14.650
 red proofs are all heard 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:18.580
 logically yes what I had tried 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:23.680
 these as sonic generation and click 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:25.720
 on the way it looks perfect yes 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:27.970
 feel all the g20 are lowers 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:31.449
 guys like the gene that goes down 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:34.599
 because you divide none of a device by 

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:37.090
 five among other things also escape 

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:38.889
 therefore with figs they require more sounds 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:41.830
 others, that is, you have understood, do not lower yourself 

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:45.490
 however you can listen to it not very much 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:48.190
 it's a problem and so nothing I wanted to do 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:51.520
 see this let's say this split 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:54.460
 all this speaker as I called 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:57.639
 as you call it the real 5 belkin is 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:06:01.539
 something that knows how to track the device i 

00:05:57.639 --> 00:06:03.550
 boys with boxing of this inter 5 

00:06:01.539 --> 00:06:06.820
 the hotels as you can see it 

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:10.080
 I revise coasts or the Romanissimo 

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:13.240
 15 hours together with several usurious but 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:15.400
 useful useful for those who want and however 

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:18.310
 said to attack tactics among many 

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:20.500
 inflates listen on the only there are 

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:22.330
 only the music on his or her cell phone 

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:25.300
 computer do as you like in one thing 

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:29.020
 professional of the thing so much 

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:35.229
 beautiful and nothing really of the comic k3 the 

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:38.229
 salute staff and the sasha carlino alex i 

00:06:35.229 --> 00:06:40.030
 bloody sunday bolton big and at the end 

00:06:38.229 --> 00:06:42.819
 I greet the comedian the body that is not there 

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:45.039
 for calamari anyway at the end then there 

00:06:42.819 --> 00:06:46.950
 I would like to see a video of my friend 

00:06:45.039 --> 00:06:49.770
 ports and concierge 

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:51.660
 that sharp torella is called on facebook 

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:53.100
 a great goalkeeper passes by in my opinion 

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:54.930
 also for us young people it is a big one 

00:06:53.100 --> 00:07:02.760
 goalkeeper 

00:06:54.930 --> 00:07:05.040
 I'll show you this game then 

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:07.590
 to the next the municipality where who knows maybe 

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:10.260
 we'll talk about the apple iphone event 

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:12.960
 5 c bear that the iPhone 5 will really be 

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:14.880
 these things call you scans of 

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:17.430
 city tips and I don't know I know 

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:20.870
 neither then I will at the next blog of 

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:20.870
 comic bells
