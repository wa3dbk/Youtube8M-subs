00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:04.930
 hello everybody it's still me 

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:05.830
 I have kenobi and so it will be my second 

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:07.720
 video for today 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:11.349
 so today I present to you is 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:13.869
 so a modified dassault time so 

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:15.490
 with the truck of the folios land 

00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:20.950
 that I find really super well done 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:21.400
 So first I added to be 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.580
 ground human 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:26.500
 finally I did a little trick there 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:30.220
 like on the real there are big 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:32.169
 pataky continues the cannon so I find 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.370
 that finally debate and I made some 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:34.960
 two sides 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.090
 the gun so there I think that is super 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:41.140
 well done here so here we are at the 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:45.010
 command with a droid 2 pilots so the 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:47.920
 gun can be lifted in piau there so we 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.300
 can lift up to 90 degrees it serves to 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.160
 nothing since if you have it is a 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.989
 little silly 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.090
 so here I always left the 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:57.430
 small cockpit the gun game 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.800
 to remove it I put it instead we 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:03.190
 here is this thing it's pretty funny 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.839
 little thing the ca is for nothing so here 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.600
 what their style so I put some 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:08.200
 little lights like in the real so 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:13.750
 a small light 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:15.479
 this is to support the barrel so ya 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.979
 not much to present 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.470
 So that's all I think he 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:24.100
 is super well done though if I so 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:25.420
 so that it ap a cd small bottle 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.830
 full no I do not think it 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.400
 looks like it's going to tell me and the 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:32.979
 carboys that we put in the barrel 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.409
 but by the apic voice, that's for sure 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:38.500
 so it was to tell you that's it 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:40.240
 so it would be nice for the ego to make a 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.670
 finally call the real assault temple as 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.750
 that with the cannon of defoliants hours 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.080
 so it would be nice if they did it 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.380
 what 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.150
 instead of being forced to create 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.530
 to come back to anything else that he has 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:50.890
 really nothing to do with the lego star 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.200
 wars 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.430
 yeah I wanted to show it this is a 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.070
 little delusion that we made with my brother 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:59.710
 so first of all we wanted to do the 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:01.329
 ship the finest possible so we 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.790
 scared I had really done everything 

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:05.530
 and after I wanted to add a little bit of 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.310
 fun of the coup I made reactors 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.200
 huge 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.970
 so here I find it's superman 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:14.420
 superman it's simple shrug 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:16.160
 so that's 1 it's fun so 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.610
 the reactors are really huge on 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.900
 can end in the stuff there is 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.120
 someone who can stand up 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.760
 so here's to show you to what 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.820
 point these big so here I find 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.920
 it's pretty mans So here thank you to
