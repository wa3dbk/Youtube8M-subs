00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.090
 that's her the huge game is being played by 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:14.260
 gtf 5 and the dear peter is next to me 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.430
 mentally and physically a wreck because he 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:16.900
 has the last days and nights with it 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:18.930
 spent the game gambling 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:21.849
 how many hours did it not need 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.640
 30 hours alone for the main story and 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:26.470
 I have a few side missions myself 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.970
 100 percent achieves what he 13th 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.220
 make up the opponent we play that 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.630
 it wants to do 550 hours 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.829
 busy and we do not have 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.360
 just sort of quickly 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:36.940
 Paired together a few game scenes 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.860
 around you now where the test is online 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.690
 just to give a few impressions 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.490
 and when shooting I have to say the same 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.100
 looks really good meadow person shooter 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:47.860
 yes that is very well done is oriented 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.300
 the strong at max payne 3 and the 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.940
 it's just not fun 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.290
 incredibly complex but you die very much 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.680
 fast so the cover must look for and 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:58.270
 what a little strange now 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.100
 The video will not be big 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:01.480
 between sequences show because the 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.190
 we were not allowed to publish yet 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.320
 because rockstar the developers like that 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:06.189
 a little bit afraid that we will boil something 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.170
 would you still something to the story 

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:10.450
 but do not worry spoiler free 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.909
 it's just these three characters 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.810
 Everyone now knows Michael Treber and 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:18.520
 franklin and they are all possible 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.479
 chaotic situations are wrong 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:27.069
 People are being harnessed for 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:28.659
 Dirty jobs is really a big one 

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:31.149
 plus point of the game so it makes a lot 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:32.560
 have fun from these three very much 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:34.569
 different characters of the 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.490
 follow history and above all just from 

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:38.560
 Treffers seen perspective out of here 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.130
 The guy is just a total one 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.090
 psychopath but always sympathetic 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.380
 I do not know how to do it myself 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.789
 because he does some 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.249
 really bad thing brings closer 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:49.749
 People around success have someone what that was 

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:51.850
 a scene for me then me 

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:54.850
 but it went a bit too far anyway 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:57.039
 somehow such a big kid that one 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.109
 loves characters and story telling that 

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:00.459
 rockstar just like it is in such a way 

00:01:59.109 --> 00:02:03.819
 a game that switch back and forth 

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:04.509
 between characters that brings that 

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:08.649
 is definitely an interesting one 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:09.789
 innovation because you always gave up others 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.020
 so you can do it within one 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:12.280
 mission also echoes the game 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:16.140
 automatically unknown also at any time 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:18.640
 change yourself and thereby 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.230
 a loosening gameplay so what 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.520
 not such an idle is always with the 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.200
 the same has the same tasks 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.380
 but then just turn up 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.570
 under operator city down there 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.310
 fight against the police and that makes 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:33.190
 already fun I'm just synonymous imagine it 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.690
 just outside in the open world net 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.790
 for mission if i'm just somewhere 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.360
 I play a boring against 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.670
 someone else 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.170
 that's the way it is, and you have to 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.630
 accept a small loading time because 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:46.630
 It takes a while to see him 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:48.370
 mimt to the next player character and 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.810
 I believe what should happen here 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.880
 we do not comment on it at all but it 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.830
 Everyone gives me some crazy games too 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.900
 yes that surprised me very positively 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:58.480
 the game is geared more to gta 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.410
 vice city and but dreas and also gta 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.240
 3 where it is a bit 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.770
 crazy was just one time 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:05.200
 little saints row is so pure 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:09.100
 here aliens yes we want to continue 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.570
 comment but they exist and there is 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.790
 a lot of sick shit in it 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:15.400
 I was very happy especially the 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.600
 dialogues are just great as in 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.610
 rockstar typical time only in english 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.990
 because you can speak english if 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.010
 you look at the German subtitles 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:24.100
 wants to leave 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:28.470
 but what is said there is unbelievable 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.470
 funny have laughed a lot and very much 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.720
 although you do not show any intermediate sequences 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.970
 You may try a rough one 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.220
 the main mission to explain exactly that 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.230
 one of the bank robbers the robbery 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:44.560
 which is just a central play element 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.580
 gta 5 are several 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.560
 Emission chains 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:50.230
 which then so must all 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.340
 given what you rob out there but you 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.050
 It has a bit of freedom too 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.090
 So how do you decide that? 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:57.340
 For example, such a jewelry store you can 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.440
 Example simply sleep gas in the store 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:03.670
 Pump or you just go with the 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:05.980
 come in and kill everyone and you 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.440
 must also have such a bit of planning 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.120
 in the front of the mission must be one 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.390
 get a flight car first photos 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.920
 shoot from the shop 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:16.780
 I hope buy guns and buy 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.000
 so on and so on that nice in 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:21.280
 In that case you have to buy a jeweler 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.810
 rob in the disguise of one 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.330
 kill some vermin and that's why 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.979
 are you beating the poor ockel ko he 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.849
 slumber peacefully now and then 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:32.300
 you put in reverse gear 

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:33.889
 and the asshole I know very angry 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.349
 but it has a good purpose for us 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:38.869
 That's enough, so you do it 

00:04:36.349 --> 00:04:41.809
 ever such things is dtm 5 mega 

00:04:38.869 --> 00:04:43.909
 gangster yes in any case so who 

00:04:41.809 --> 00:04:47.179
 There is nothing left for this office 

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:49.099
 and home i and leave this whole 

00:04:47.179 --> 00:04:51.529
 shit that is not fun because 

00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:54.080
 So it is but it is also 

00:04:51.529 --> 00:04:54.800
 a parody of this is extreme 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.050
 exaggerated 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:59.419
 there is a dialogue where they are almost all 2 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:04.519
 every other word is romy and groh and 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:09.589
 niger celebrated saying to himself and so 

00:05:04.519 --> 00:05:11.089
 only as absurd back to the gameplay you 

00:05:09.589 --> 00:05:12.619
 you have just committed burglary 

00:05:11.089 --> 00:05:15.199
 Also options like how much you steal or 

00:05:12.619 --> 00:05:16.129
 such as how fast and how safe yes that 

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:18.429
 depends a bit on which 

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:20.240
 culture dedicated because there you are 

00:05:18.429 --> 00:05:22.369
 freedom of choice if you prefer 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:24.979
 a type of nothing on it but has the 

00:05:22.369 --> 00:05:27.469
 it also costs less to live 

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:31.300
 engaged or just would have profi but 

00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:31.300
 also wants to have a large share of 

00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:49.249
 which also entertains me very well 

00:05:47.659 --> 00:05:50.719
 just what this game offers 

00:05:49.249 --> 00:05:53.029
 So we're seeing one here right now 

00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:54.800
 freak side missions that there are 

00:05:53.029 --> 00:05:56.689
 just a couple of those in the 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.429
 rumstehen landscape and the total 

00:05:56.689 --> 00:06:00.740
 we have absurd tasks right now 

00:05:58.429 --> 00:06:02.869
 play paparazzi and the guy takes pictures 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:06.349
 from the hollywood star in the limo 

00:06:02.869 --> 00:06:07.729
 just as they are getting drugged and easy 

00:06:06.349 --> 00:06:09.229
 is just one example of many wants there 

00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:10.699
 do not want too much they are really 

00:06:09.229 --> 00:06:12.319
 great 

00:06:10.699 --> 00:06:15.169
 general mission design is 

00:06:12.319 --> 00:06:17.300
 outstandingly well there are a few small ones 

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:18.740
 defects in these attacks just because 

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.029
 You often go to this procurement mission 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:21.919
 or simply has to steal such a car 

00:06:20.029 --> 00:06:25.219
 which does not necessarily save extremely 

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:26.990
 but is generally excellent so the 

00:06:25.219 --> 00:06:28.729
 the amount of content in the game so 

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:31.279
 not only in terms of disguise 

00:06:28.729 --> 00:06:33.349
 and and weapons and cars, too 

00:06:31.279 --> 00:06:35.809
 the huge size of the game that is 

00:06:33.349 --> 00:06:37.189
 something which made me a bit almost 

00:06:35.809 --> 00:06:38.629
 what scares me is because of this 

00:06:37.189 --> 00:06:40.459
 Giant game is really enough 

00:06:38.629 --> 00:06:42.380
 filled with interesting things she 

00:06:40.459 --> 00:06:44.120
 looks very organic 

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:45.290
 if I exist on every corner 

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:46.910
 something there are also many 

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:48.530
 random events where then you just 

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:50.120
 go the store and suddenly ambush 

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:52.550
 load a few notes and then you have the 

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:54.110
 Possibility to do that 

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:56.270
 all that illusion that there really 

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:59.290
 a world behind it is the art 

00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:01.130
 and where people live and work and 

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:02.810
 blowing people up in the air 

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:04.160
 And that's just a lot 

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:06.530
 mini-game you can engage yourself 

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:08.420
 what's next to the story as long as you want 

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:12.230
 So there is tennis playing golf 

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:13.370
 Doing yoga is meant to be a test 

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:16.490
 that you are not quite like that with the technology 

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:18.320
 I am pleased as gta 4 4 on it 

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:19.730
 the ps3 where is that time really geruckelt 

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:21.860
 I'm really happy for the huge one 

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:23.540
 sheer size of the game I think 

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:25.430
 personally the performance is sufficient 

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:27.440
 yes there are a few little things off and 

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:29.540
 To hummels sometimes textures will be slow 

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:31.190
 after loading but that is really critical 

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:32.360
 High level game looks great 

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:35.600
 is still running on the current 

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:37.670
 console generation and I recommend 

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:41.450
 So it does not matter to anyone 

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:43.160
 everyone is supposed to play the game now 42 is on 

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:45.820
 Best also christen give right now 

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:45.820
 to gamble
