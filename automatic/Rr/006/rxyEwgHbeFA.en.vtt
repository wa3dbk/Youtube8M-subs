00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.670
 romilson photo maniacs 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.390
 I see you here today in the first video lesson but the simple man is 

00:00:11.249 --> 00:00:12.949
 very high 

00:00:12.949 --> 00:00:15.079
 the river 

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:18.829
 - I do not want to show you what I do 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.789
 really when this type of problem occurs 

00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:28.749
 Is this the one we got this girl with her damaged eye here to tell 

00:00:30.819 --> 00:00:33.819
 well, it's very difficult to recover. 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.010
 tripoli than many of us are 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.030
 consultant 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.560
 used his first serve 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.280
 what 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.740
 I started to use something that I have never heard of for a year 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.880
 franklin really afraid 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.200
 truly sad 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.910
 The puzzle I started to make 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.980
 It's a thing that sometimes people do not know leaves the sunny day 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.220
 if it's not like that, why? 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.490
 think that they do not dominate the condition to take care of the works siurb the register of these 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.960
 girl girls 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.580
 let's go here 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.580
 first the former captain of the pen 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.680
 come on I love you 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.020
 on the other hand here 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.320
 in case 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.320
 on the sun side already the other 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:34.570
 let's demand this 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.610
 the loot 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.590
 between inactive 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.380
 to reverse 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.290
 ef 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.290
 like the saints but here 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.410
 we have two hectares 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.780
 so let's go here 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.050
 the brightness 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:08.050
 if the same is 

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:12.609
 let's go 

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:21.719
 We are going to close 

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:24.719
 your eye on the fiscal side that 

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:30.439
 by shock but we won nothing 

00:02:31.029 --> 00:02:33.609
 in this region 

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:36.609
 Let's play one against terror. 

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:43.469
 I usually arrive in Brazil to stay the same size 

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:47.829
 were damaged 

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:50.829
 the same 

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:54.809
 the same way 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:00.149
 wellington 

00:03:00.149 --> 00:03:01.879
 it was just good 

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:04.879
 mouth here in Brazil on 

00:03:07.399 --> 00:03:09.749
 Be alert 

00:03:09.749 --> 00:03:12.749
 put your name on the knee 

00:03:14.619 --> 00:03:16.029
 field 

00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:19.249
 click here to read apply 

00:03:19.249 --> 00:03:22.249
 why us women 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:26.319
 trail 

00:03:28.679 --> 00:03:31.679
 because there was nothing 

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:37.619
 not for the other five 

00:03:37.619 --> 00:03:40.619
 More tactics here 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:44.459
 Let's go inside here to see what's left 

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:49.889
 you stay 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:52.449
 clicking here na 

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:54.430
 do not give them anything 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.430
 Shooting you, it's more or less the way you are. 

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:02.779
 currently see that here 

00:04:02.779 --> 00:04:05.779
 there is more or less a right 

00:04:06.649 --> 00:04:09.649
 proposal a little more here 

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:15.409
 the little brothers 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:19.729
 let's go up 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:22.729
 optionally 

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:28.939
 so tell 

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:30.930
 on here 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:34.199
 as a leader a person died 

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:37.840
 with the enclosure closed and visit here your hand 

00:04:38.499 --> 00:04:41.819
 the polio 

00:04:41.819 --> 00:04:44.199
 so that's serious 

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:46.279
 The french 

00:04:46.279 --> 00:04:49.279
 I was sure it's okay. 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.919
 okay 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:53.900
 worse 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:57.210
 we started laughing 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.460
 this option 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.650
 this tool that I use a lot 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:04.550
 let's say it is one of those that humanizes 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:06.539
 that's why they are 

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:07.719
 your agent 

00:05:07.719 --> 00:05:09.439
 we are going to unite 

00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:11.449
 click here 

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:15.159
 remembering that one can go too, it's like a couple 

00:05:15.749 --> 00:05:17.330
 be queen 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:19.289
 the hotel chain 

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:20.960
 ef 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.960
 we work with the other subgroups 

00:05:26.809 --> 00:05:28.800
 in the present case 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.759
 with a good tone 

00:05:30.759 --> 00:05:33.759
 it's the 

00:05:35.569 --> 00:05:38.550
 is not for nothing 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:40.089
 the plan 

00:05:40.089 --> 00:05:42.029
 adjusting to it 

00:05:42.029 --> 00:05:44.300
 noeli purchases 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:47.160
 but if you're going to make the comparison, and you? 

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.569
 on the other hand 

00:05:49.569 --> 00:05:51.979
 it's a loop 

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:55.129
 do not miss 

00:05:55.129 --> 00:05:57.719
 from about to about 

00:05:57.719 --> 00:05:59.919
 grew up and here 

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:01.360
 that pen remained 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.580
 among the titles by Flemish 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:04.830
 So 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:06.009
 the ocde
