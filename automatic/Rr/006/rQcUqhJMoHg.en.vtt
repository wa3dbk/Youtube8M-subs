00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:06.299
 hi all friends youtube here is 97 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.280
 I'm here with a new special video from 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:13.200
 my eighteenth birthday 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:15.330
 best wishes to you enough just ok we have 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.580
 done 18 years but we are here for others 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.900
 things you make bovenga bis as I have you 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.119
 promised on the page 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.100
 so this March is the deck that 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.220
 I'll play star together in this one 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.980
 banner and I got a hand in the 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.050
 my friend to mount a list enough 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.090
 strong because I had different ideas 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.980
 and probably wrong by not having it 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.510
 never played so this is the dean 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:43.050
 file then as the konami wants it so 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:45.210
 lasts 1 and goes well as another start for 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.210
 compensate for the fact of the duty 13 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:51.120
 mathematical mathematicians what is needed then 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.210
 I send scanty and in and date nature or 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:57.030
 however what you need or 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:59.579
 Libyan mandate that makes them do special 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.559
 a ring of the hand with the effects 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.420
 negative with the mathematician in the cold 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.450
 night or whatever I need 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.220
 however mainly giving then to the 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.110
 bolling department we abyss between the caf 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:15.900
 obviously there was a lot of blow 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:17.640
 equally strong triple scarl and these 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.280
 are the ones I play internet because a 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.950
 my opinion are the strongest 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:25.310
 then we have double farfa fortfa 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.369
 because it takes away monstrous cars 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:32.460
 double rubik a route that I see it 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:34.200
 very heavy 3 and doubled bic therefore 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:38.880
 these are the burning abyss that 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:44.040
 game that by now always in the 69 46 15 15 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:47.009
 burning abc like other game monsters 2 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.140
 effect sails that I like 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:52.079
 I am so much destination and why not 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:55.619
 play them since the last one that person 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:58.649
 fucking dislike xdxd crociana merla e 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.770
 a bls gold because I am poor no no 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.070
 I had the apple to give the weight 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.490
 crazy goes well 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:09.810
 these framework in our then magic 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:12.599
 we have two male change 2 card 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.489
 very strong that turned at the right time 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:17.670
 makes you win alone against read 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:20.250
 because the crew is too strong type ea 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:25.140
 two okay to three seems exaggerated 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:27.090
 I'm playing two typhoons by email and by the 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.610
 moment I like I don't know if 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:32.700
 I will continue to play them but at the time of 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.319
 game and how because mine for mine 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.590
 comics because except what I do but 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:39.800
 mind st 12 and then the heads because they are 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.450
 book of humor and jackie and shock book of 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:45.150
 strong against crosses is very strong 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.430
 black match and jackie card that makes you 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:51.680
 win games and fool this 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:54.930
 bunch is something extraordinary 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:57.540
 traps tremble in crash 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.580
 the only card I play both of which is 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.640
 my favorite trap and it's strong 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:07.470
 against all the metal but then built 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:11.790
 between then double do lake far lake forte 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:14.190
 but not in 3 to heavy package then as 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.379
 shoes let's say game 2 phoenix a 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:19.739
 last innings and 2 jacks breaks 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:23.310
 then this is the department that still 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:25.200
 I have to think about it but then phoenix 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.590
 maximum you touch you have to play for 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.900
 force two or three copies and German two is 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.580
 offered by the jets the break instead of 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.340
 karmic cut because it destroys 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:38.159
 any kind of card or even magic 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.900
 trap while technical cut is its own 

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:42.299
 for monsters even if you remove them from 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:47.010
 very strong for the moment I am 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:49.830
 so fine and goes well against j'adore 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.060
 maybe cut meats there are stronger and up 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:57.090
 there is no doubt that they make you 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:59.400
 flag with structure, however, or meda 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.290
 there is more direction that breaks to make a hundred 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.409
 if these are the ones I played in le 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:06.269
 copies a single copy and of course a game 

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:10.140
 a vanity entity ness 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:15.120
 because with years he wants it so and then a 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:18.269
 strong virus crash apart with lo 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:21.299
 shuttle that on average'm destination 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:23.610
 strong against practically everything is the 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:26.990
 negro is very strong against stars is 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:29.030
 really really like a lot 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.560
 this trouble for the main deck 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:33.479
 we pass the very simple extra deck 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.060
 triple giving because I did it 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:38.069
 you absolutely can play it less 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:41.430
 absolutely if you can't play at 

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:44.550
 double baffled March knows where it's good 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:50.550
 between me it seems exaggerated in general but in 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:54.419
 it spring alucard 30gb of the sac 2 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:57.270
 vergilio fortissimo happens at a time in 

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:59.750
 whose premises 2 and then at the end two from 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:05.310
 what they saw coming then 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:07.919
 so sum if you can't thanks to the 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:10.520
 well so if you said it file is 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:14.039
 liked I invite you to leave a like 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:15.289
 we have at 200 220 I'd really like 

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:18.000
 much 

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:21.360
 let's put some papers in that 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.490
 represent this March you bak and sails 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:25.889
 and well represent this March 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:30.449
 we absolutely put then burning avis 

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:35.099
 randomly let me know if you have 

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:36.569
 some artix from gas with us because i am 

00:05:35.099 --> 00:05:38.370
 interested and never having played it 

00:05:36.569 --> 00:05:42.500
 this deck anyway I made the list 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:47.250
 against a good one to play it and then 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:50.310
 gladly guide mathematical tour and how 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:52.520
 last card obviously the dante well 

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:54.750
 benghazi to have seen the video left 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:57.449
