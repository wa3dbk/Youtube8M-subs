pages<00:04:23.340> or<00:04:23.760> smaller<00:04:24.360> I<00:04:24.979> think<00:04:25.979> we'll<00:04:26.130> it<00:04:26.310> was<00:04:26.340> a

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
pages or smaller I think we'll it was a

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:31.100 
pages or smaller I think we'll it was a
little<00:04:27.410> too<00:04:28.410> plastic<00:04:29.010> I<00:04:29.340> think<00:04:30.210> you<00:04:30.570> lose<00:04:30.660> but

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
little too plastic I think you lose but

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:36.110 
little too plastic I think you lose but
only<00:04:31.530> shaking<00:04:33.080> but<00:04:34.520> got<00:04:35.520> a<00:04:35.550> nice<00:04:35.789> quality

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
only shaking but got a nice quality

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:41.870 
only shaking but got a nice quality
overall<00:04:37.070> it<00:04:38.070> is<00:04:38.130> fair<00:04:38.550> smallest<00:04:39.830> leading<00:04:40.880> 100

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
overall it is fair smallest leading 100

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:49.029 
overall it is fair smallest leading 100
so<00:04:42.539> it<00:04:43.020> wasn't<00:04:43.640> expensive

00:04:49.029 --> 00:04:49.039
