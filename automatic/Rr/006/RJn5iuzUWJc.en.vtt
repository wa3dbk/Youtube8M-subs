then I'll cover it with the the wire

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:36.039 
then I'll cover it with the the wire
which<00:02:31.160> is<00:02:32.140> which<00:02:33.140> is<00:02:33.170> there<00:02:34.599> I'll<00:02:35.599> throw<00:02:35.870> it

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:36.049 
which is which is there I'll throw it

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:40.180 
which is which is there I'll throw it
back<00:02:36.080> on<00:02:36.500> top<00:02:37.360> and<00:02:38.360> put<00:02:39.349> the<00:02:39.380> thermometer<00:02:39.739> back

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
back on top and put the thermometer back

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:48.180 
back on top and put the thermometer back
in<00:02:40.810> and<00:02:43.930> let<00:02:44.930> let<00:02:45.350> us<00:02:45.380> sit<00:02:45.739> hopefully<00:02:46.609> it<00:02:46.700> won't

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
in and let let us sit hopefully it won't

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.130 
in and let let us sit hopefully it won't
freeze<00:02:49.190> this<00:02:49.970> winter<00:02:50.329> which<00:02:50.480> it<00:02:50.660> hasn't<00:02:50.840> in<00:02:51.109> a

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
long time quite a long time but that's

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.569
