00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
know you have to look around a little

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.460 
know you have to look around a little
bit<00:03:04.640> but<00:03:05.329> you<00:03:05.450> can<00:03:05.599> definitely<00:03:05.810> got<00:03:06.260> one

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
bit but you can definitely got one

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.699 
bit but you can definitely got one
fairly<00:03:07.010> cheap<00:03:07.430> under<00:03:07.849> ten<00:03:08.060> dollars<00:03:08.569> and<00:03:09.049> yeah

think the ones like this were about

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:15.670 
think the ones like this were about
thirty<00:03:13.160> dollars<00:03:13.760> these<00:03:14.450> bigger<00:03:14.720> heavy<00:03:15.230> duty
