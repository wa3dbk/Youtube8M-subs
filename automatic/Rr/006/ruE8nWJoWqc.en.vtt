00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.150
 looking for jean I had tears in my eyes 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:52.520

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:53.720

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.149
 also to your teammates 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:58.820
 the coaches a lot of support here that 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:00.079
 mean what for you ben it's like 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.570
 a big family so far 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:04.070
 that my sister is the team to provide a 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.409
 field in autumn in marseille cabinet 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:09.110
 from the outside as a super animator 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:10.729
 bowl ha to have that I know if it's 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.259
 a lot for me it's just to be this 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:14.899
 that I ate malaria people in 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:18.170
 life but go out the gifts I got 

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:20.600
 moments of inattention like style - 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.609
 I came here and gave me Jean the pangs 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.289
 witnesses and no it's just that 

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:27.529
 so it's like a lot for me 

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:29.450
 would pick me up and then it's like 

00:01:27.529 --> 00:01:31.939
 if emotionally it's after a big 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.859
 test as I lived it's just 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:36.770
 fell twice in a year that in 

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:38.090
 the dead country operation is animated and I 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.159
 look today I'm here but 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.920

 I went to the match but it comes 

00:01:48.349 --> 00:01:51.770

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.909
 with the organization then sooner 

00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:59.599
 possible for me it's better but I 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:01.849
 take the same time of two weeks 

00:01:59.599 --> 00:02:04.939
