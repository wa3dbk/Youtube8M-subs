00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:02.429 
it has been fun I've enjoyed doing it

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.510 
it has been fun I've enjoyed doing it
I've<00:00:02.639> learned<00:00:03.149> a<00:00:03.449> ton<00:00:03.840> of<00:00:03.870> stuff<00:00:04.290> and<00:00:05.250> I<00:00:05.370> want

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
I've learned a ton of stuff and I want

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:06.950 
I've learned a ton of stuff and I want
to<00:00:05.580> thank<00:00:05.730> everybody<00:00:06.000> that's<00:00:06.299> been<00:00:06.420> tuning<00:00:06.779> in

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
to thank everybody that's been tuning in

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.640 
to thank everybody that's been tuning in
a<00:00:07.109> month<00:00:07.730> it's<00:00:09.019> been<00:00:10.019> quite<00:00:10.230> an<00:00:10.349> experience

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
a month it's been quite an experience

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.700 
a month it's been quite an experience
and<00:00:11.160> it's<00:00:11.960> been<00:00:12.960> kind<00:00:13.170> of<00:00:13.230> a<00:00:13.290> challenge

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
and it's been kind of a challenge

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.560 
and it's been kind of a challenge
because<00:00:13.799> in<00:00:14.219> reality<00:00:14.460> I<00:00:14.790> pretty<00:00:15.240> much<00:00:15.330> do<00:00:15.540> the

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
because in reality I pretty much do the

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.990 
because in reality I pretty much do the
flight<00:00:15.870> of<00:00:15.900> myself<00:00:16.410> I<00:00:16.590> have<00:00:16.710> one<00:00:17.000> part-time

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
flight of myself I have one part-time

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.740 
flight of myself I have one part-time
instructor<00:00:18.660> and<00:00:19.730> virtually<00:00:20.730> no<00:00:21.180> office<00:00:21.539> help

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
instructor and virtually no office help

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.140 
instructor and virtually no office help
and<00:00:22.400> so<00:00:23.400> I<00:00:23.430> pretty<00:00:23.640> much<00:00:23.730> do<00:00:24.060> everything

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
and so I pretty much do everything

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.170 
and so I pretty much do everything
myself<00:00:24.539> so<00:00:25.310> it's<00:00:26.310> been<00:00:26.430> a<00:00:26.460> pretty<00:00:26.730> big<00:00:26.939> feat

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
myself so it's been a pretty big feat

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.570 
myself so it's been a pretty big feat
trying<00:00:27.570> to<00:00:27.900> keep<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:28.800> aircraft<00:00:28.890> going

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
trying to keep the aircraft going

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.189 
trying to keep the aircraft going
getting<00:00:29.789> it<00:00:29.880> for<00:00:29.970> maintenance<00:00:30.210> fly<00:00:30.990> with

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
getting it for maintenance fly with

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.400 
getting it for maintenance fly with
students<00:00:31.910> do<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.059> marketing<00:00:33.450> do<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.110> videos

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
students do the marketing do the videos

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.040 
students do the marketing do the videos
do<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:34.860> editing<00:00:34.980> so<00:00:35.489> and<00:00:35.610> so<00:00:35.730> forth<00:00:36.030> so<00:00:36.270> it's

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
do the editing so and so forth so it's

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.660 
do the editing so and so forth so it's
really<00:00:37.410> been<00:00:37.590> cool<00:00:37.920> and<00:00:38.250> I<00:00:38.910> want<00:00:39.570> to<00:00:39.660> end<00:00:39.840> with

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670 
really been cool and I want to end with

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.720 
really been cool and I want to end with
the<00:00:42.079> three<00:00:43.079> key<00:00:43.410> terms<00:00:43.829> for<00:00:44.219> learning<00:00:44.520> to<00:00:44.610> fly

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
the three key terms for learning to fly

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.290 
the three key terms for learning to fly
helicopters<00:00:44.940> and<00:00:46.489> three<00:00:47.489> key<00:00:47.670> terms<00:00:47.940> for

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
helicopters and three key terms for

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.119 
helicopters and three key terms for
perfecting<00:00:48.809> your<00:00:49.020> maneuvers<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:49.920> all<00:00:50.010> the

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
perfecting your maneuvers and all the

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.020 
perfecting your maneuvers and all the
things<00:00:50.309> that<00:00:50.340> you're<00:00:50.520> going<00:00:50.550> to<00:00:50.700> do<00:00:50.820> in<00:00:50.940> the

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
things that you're going to do in the

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:57.369 
things that you're going to do in the
aircraft<00:00:51.510> and<00:00:52.340> that<00:00:53.340> is<00:00:54.710> smooth<00:00:56.090> control

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 
aircraft and that is smooth control

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:01.639 
aircraft and that is smooth control
inputs<00:00:58.760> remember<00:00:59.760> those<00:00:59.940> three<00:01:00.270> words<00:01:00.649> every

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
inputs remember those three words every

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.870 
inputs remember those three words every
single<00:01:02.039> thing<00:01:02.070> we<00:01:02.430> do<00:01:02.609> in<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.820> helicopter<00:01:03.510> is

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:04.880 
single thing we do in the helicopter is

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.969 
single thing we do in the helicopter is
smooth<00:01:05.880> control<00:01:06.360> inputs<00:01:06.780> there's<00:01:06.990> never<00:01:07.290> any

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
smooth control inputs there's never any

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.840 
smooth control inputs there's never any
reason<00:01:08.939> of<00:01:09.150> any<00:01:09.600> kind<00:01:10.070> to<00:01:11.070> jerk<00:01:11.400> any<00:01:11.610> of<00:01:11.760> the

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
reason of any kind to jerk any of the

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.910 
reason of any kind to jerk any of the
controls<00:01:12.330> abruptly<00:01:12.869> in<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.080> helicopter<00:01:13.260> even

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
controls abruptly in the helicopter even

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.100 
controls abruptly in the helicopter even
the<00:01:14.010> emergency<00:01:14.460> stuff<00:01:14.700> we<00:01:14.909> do<00:01:15.110> everything

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
the emergency stuff we do everything

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.920 
the emergency stuff we do everything
that<00:01:16.259> we<00:01:16.350> do<00:01:16.530> is<00:01:16.680> nice<00:01:16.890> and<00:01:17.100> smooth<00:01:17.930> example

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
that we do is nice and smooth example

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.670 
that we do is nice and smooth example
quick<00:01:19.229> steps<00:01:19.530> I've<00:01:20.490> had<00:01:21.530> one<00:01:22.530> of<00:01:22.650> my

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
quick steps I've had one of my

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.530 
quick steps I've had one of my
instructors<00:01:23.159> early<00:01:23.790> on<00:01:23.909> said<00:01:24.150> you<00:01:24.270> know<00:01:24.390> we

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
instructors early on said you know we

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.510 
instructors early on said you know we
should<00:01:24.720> probably<00:01:24.930> call<00:01:25.229> them<00:01:25.259> slow<00:01:25.830> stop<00:01:26.220> not

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
should probably call them slow stop not

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.580 
should probably call them slow stop not
sure<00:01:26.820> not<00:01:27.150> call<00:01:27.420> them<00:01:27.570> quick<00:01:27.840> stop<00:01:28.140> because

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
sure not call them quick stop because

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.649 
sure not call them quick stop because
that<00:01:29.250> gives<00:01:29.400> you<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.880> impression<00:01:30.060> that<00:01:30.450> you

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
that gives you the impression that you

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.440 
that gives you the impression that you
gotta<00:01:30.840> yank<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.799> cyclic<00:01:32.220> back<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:32.790> trick<00:01:33.329> the

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
gotta yank the cyclic back and trick the

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.270 
gotta yank the cyclic back and trick the
collective<00:01:33.780> around<00:01:34.079> and<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:34.799> that's<00:01:34.920> not<00:01:35.159> the

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
collective around and and that's not the

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.350 
collective around and and that's not the
case<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:36.439> the<00:01:37.439> true<00:01:37.829> trick<00:01:38.790> to<00:01:39.030> learn<00:01:39.119> it<00:01:39.270> to

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
case the the true trick to learn it to

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.780 
case the the true trick to learn it to
fly<00:01:39.570> these<00:01:39.630> things<00:01:40.110> is<00:01:40.500> smoothing<00:01:41.340> control

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
fly these things is smoothing control

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.969 
fly these things is smoothing control
smooth<00:01:42.299> control<00:01:42.720> inputs<00:01:43.140> and<00:01:43.350> that's<00:01:43.470> like

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
smooth control inputs and that's like

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.889 
smooth control inputs and that's like
the<00:01:44.130> quick<00:01:44.310> stuff<00:01:44.520> even<00:01:44.820> though<00:01:44.850> it's<00:01:44.939> your

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
the quick stuff even though it's your

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.170 
the quick stuff even though it's your
quickly<00:01:46.380> slick<00:01:47.009> d<00:01:47.280> accelerating<00:01:48.060> the

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
quickly slick d accelerating the

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.929 
quickly slick d accelerating the
helicopter<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.560> control<00:01:50.040> inputs<00:01:50.490> should

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
helicopter the control inputs should

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.389 
helicopter the control inputs should
still<00:01:51.180> be<00:01:51.360> smooth<00:01:51.689> and<00:01:51.960> when<00:01:52.829> it<00:01:52.920> comes<00:01:53.100> to

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
still be smooth and when it comes to

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.899 
still be smooth and when it comes to
learning<00:01:54.360> to<00:01:54.509> fly<00:01:54.659> and<00:01:55.049> learning<00:01:55.290> to<00:01:55.380> hover<00:01:55.909> we

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
learning to fly and learning to hover we

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.520 
learning to fly and learning to hover we
got<00:01:57.090> little<00:01:57.390> video<00:01:57.600> here<00:01:57.659> in<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.049> background

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
got little video here in the background

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.139 
got little video here in the background
and<00:01:58.770> just<00:01:59.399> kind<00:01:59.579> of<00:01:59.610> showing<00:01:59.820> you<00:02:00.000> what<00:02:00.119> a

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
and just kind of showing you what a

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.510 
and just kind of showing you what a
typical<00:02:00.450> person<00:02:00.869> does<00:02:01.290> when<00:02:02.130> they<00:02:02.219> start

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
typical person does when they start

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.390 
typical person does when they start
learning<00:02:02.790> to<00:02:02.909> fly

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:03.400 
learning to fly

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.490 
learning to fly
they're<00:02:04.150> all<00:02:04.450> over<00:02:04.690> the<00:02:04.900> place<00:02:04.930> and<00:02:05.380> that's

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
they're all over the place and that's

and some headache and heartache just go

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.080 
and some headache and heartache just go
in<00:02:33.880> with<00:02:34.000> the<00:02:34.120> attitude<00:02:34.390> that<00:02:35.170> I<00:02:35.230> have<00:02:35.560> to<00:02:35.800> use

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
in with the attitude that I have to use

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.040 
in with the attitude that I have to use
smooth<00:02:37.470> control<00:02:38.760> inputs<00:02:39.760> that<00:02:40.060> those<00:02:40.720> really

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
smooth control inputs that those really

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.949 
smooth control inputs that those really
are<00:02:41.080> the<00:02:41.350> three<00:02:41.800> key<00:02:42.100> terms<00:02:42.970> and<00:02:43.240> I've<00:02:43.330> thought

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
are the three key terms and I've thought

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.320 
are the three key terms and I've thought
that<00:02:44.200> for<00:02:44.470> many<00:02:45.010> years<00:02:45.430> I<00:02:45.550> should<00:02:45.970> just<00:02:46.120> wear

that for many years I should just wear

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.930 
that for many years I should just wear
something<00:02:46.600> on<00:02:46.930> my<00:02:47.190> around<00:02:48.190> my<00:02:48.310> neck<00:02:48.550> hanging

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
off my chest that says smooth control

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.140 
off my chest that says smooth control
inputs<00:02:52.959> because<00:02:53.709> that's<00:02:53.920> what<00:02:54.310> people<00:02:54.670> have

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.080 
probably even sooner but we're going to
really<00:03:58.660> start<00:03:59.220> putting<00:04:00.220> the<00:04:00.310> pressure<00:04:00.489> on<00:04:00.700> it

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090
