00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:06.870
 a greeting from italian dry djen in this 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.269
 new video that I was requested by 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:13.740
 a user will explain how to go from 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:15.570
 a rom modified to stock firmware 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.840
 first we need to connect to 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.090
 this site samsung updates dot com 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.640
 I leave the link in the description e 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.769
 select from the drop-down list here a 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.189
 left our device 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:34.170
 this will be a general guide not 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:36.329
 single chose ours ours 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:40.350
 version of android to download 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:42.390
 we click on download a software that 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.360
 to download that does not need 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:48.149
 installation but it is fundamental today 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:53.100
 I leave the link in the description also 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:55.170
 for it once the firmware has been downloaded 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.870
 finished downloading you will find this 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.879
 rar files that unpacked you will find 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.859
 these two files but we don't just need them 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:06.360
 this is the first one downloaded today too 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:08.720
 let's open the rar file and lo 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.720
 we perform 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:24.590
 here we take now 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:27.260
 usb of our phone and it 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:30.220
 we connect to the phone and spend the 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.220
 our phone 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:42.290
 let it be disconnected from the phone but 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.970
 it is simply connected only to the 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:46.460
 computer 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:50.420
 now we will have to press the combination of 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:02:00.020
 volume keys down more meaning more 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:02:02.870
 switching off ok these keys pressed there 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:05.240
 the warning signal will come out e 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:07.340
 to continue we will have to press the volume 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.010
 upward 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.650
 now we will be the mode nodes and it will be enough for us 

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:16.430
 connect the phone to the computer via 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:21.020
 usb equals ours will be recognized 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:22.940
 phone can sometimes happen that should 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.489
 install the drivers as in this in 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:28.940
 this case and we will wait once 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:31.310
 finished installing the drivers we will have to 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:34.520
 make sure author is selected 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:37.340
 but after time and not shaun departments 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:40.700
 while others can leave it alone 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:47.060
 we click on api or pda depending on the 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:49.550
 version of oden and select this 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:52.880
 md5 file once the file is loaded 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:53.660
 simply click on start and it will start 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.420
 the procedure 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:03:00.290
 I don't do it now because I 'm me 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:03.170
 removes the rom anyway 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:06.250
 even when the 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.629
 device does not disconnect from usb 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:12.969
 unplug it only once here where 

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:16.370
 it says 0 with 4 or with two depends 

00:03:12.969 --> 00:03:17.810
 a green background will come with 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:21.920
 written pass 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:23.390
 at that point you can disconnect it in the evening 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.670
