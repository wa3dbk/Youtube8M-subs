00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.940 
go and I'm going to try to keep my pics
that<00:00:35.670> were<00:00:35.790> on<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:36.030> 2010<00:00:36.690> list<00:00:36.960> to<00:00:37.350> a<00:00:37.380> minimum

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
that were on the 2010 list to a minimum

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.139 
that were on the 2010 list to a minimum
despite<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.430> fact<00:00:38.550> that<00:00:38.640> I<00:00:38.760> all<00:00:38.850> thought<00:00:38.879> they

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
despite the fact that I all thought they

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.880 
despite the fact that I all thought they
had<00:00:39.270> a<00:00:39.300> legitimate<00:00:39.660> shot<00:00:39.840> only<00:00:40.379> a<00:00:40.410> few<00:00:40.590> of<00:00:40.649> them

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
had a legitimate shot only a few of them

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.880 
had a legitimate shot only a few of them
will<00:00:41.040> be<00:00:41.160> reappearing<00:00:41.820> so<00:00:42.570> first<00:00:43.140> is<00:00:43.440> the

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
will be reappearing so first is the

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.190 
will be reappearing so first is the
master<00:00:44.430> grade<00:00:44.640> Delta<00:00:45.120> plus<00:00:45.480> which<00:00:45.899> I<00:00:46.050> think

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
master grade Delta plus which I think

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.470 
master grade Delta plus which I think
we're<00:00:46.289> going<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.469> get<00:00:46.559> from<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:47.070> unicorn<00:00:47.610> ova

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
we're going to get from the unicorn ova

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.959 
we're going to get from the unicorn ova
and<00:00:48.780> made<00:00:48.899> a<00:00:48.930> little<00:00:49.140> cool<00:00:49.700> intro<00:00:50.700> it<00:00:50.820> had<00:00:50.940> a

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
and made a little cool intro it had a

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.610 
and made a little cool intro it had a
little<00:00:51.210> cool<00:00:51.360> cameo<00:00:51.809> at<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.050> end<00:00:52.170> of<00:00:52.230> episode

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
little cool cameo at the end of episode

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.430 
little cool cameo at the end of episode
to<00:00:52.860> episode<00:00:53.489> 3<00:00:53.850> will<00:00:54.629> be<00:00:54.719> coming<00:00:54.899> out<00:00:55.050> too<00:00:55.230> soon

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
to episode 3 will be coming out too soon

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.450 
to episode 3 will be coming out too soon
so<00:00:55.680> I<00:00:55.710> don't<00:00:55.890> think<00:00:55.949> it's<00:00:56.070> going<00:00:56.219> to<00:00:56.280> get<00:00:56.430> a

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
so I don't think it's going to get a

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.040 
so I don't think it's going to get a
march<00:00:56.730> or<00:00:56.940> april<00:00:56.969> release<00:00:57.570> but<00:00:57.809> anyway

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
march or april release but anyway

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.410 
march or april release but anyway
probably<00:00:58.320> a<00:00:58.859> Tober<00:00:59.370> i<00:00:59.550> think<00:01:00.180> that<00:01:00.270> has<00:01:00.359> a

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
probably a Tober i think that has a

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.180 
probably a Tober i think that has a
legitimate<00:01:00.780> shot<00:01:00.930> because<00:01:01.320> a<00:01:01.500> long<00:01:01.829> time<00:01:01.890> ago

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
legitimate shot because a long time ago

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.889 
legitimate shot because a long time ago
even<00:01:02.609> before<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:03.090> anime<00:01:03.449> version<00:01:03.629> was

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
even before the anime version was

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.410 
even before the anime version was
announced<00:01:04.040> band<00:01:05.040> i<00:01:05.220> SAT<00:01:05.640> a<00:01:05.670> survey<00:01:06.150> on<00:01:06.180> their

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
website and japanese for which unicorn

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:09.740 
website and japanese for which unicorn
suits<00:01:08.760> do<00:01:08.880> you<00:01:08.939> want<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.150> see<00:01:09.240> get<00:01:09.390> a<00:01:09.450> master

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
suits do you want to see get a master

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.020 
suits do you want to see get a master
grade<00:01:09.960> and<00:01:10.170> that<00:01:10.770> finished<00:01:11.159> in<00:01:11.310> number<00:01:11.580> one<00:01:11.729> so

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
grade and that finished in number one so

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.370 
grade and that finished in number one so
i<00:01:12.060> think<00:01:12.180> that<00:01:12.540> if<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.720> pilot<00:01:12.990> makes<00:01:13.110> a<00:01:13.229> good

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
i think that if the pilot makes a good

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.050 
i think that if the pilot makes a good
impression<00:01:13.439> on<00:01:13.830> everybody<00:01:14.189> that<00:01:14.790> has<00:01:15.030> a

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
impression on everybody that has a

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.590 
impression on everybody that has a
legitimate<00:01:15.390> shot<00:01:15.570> for<00:01:16.350> this<00:01:16.650> year<00:01:17.540> now<00:01:18.540> we

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
legitimate shot for this year now we

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.899 
legitimate shot for this year now we
recycled<00:01:19.229> one<00:01:19.380> here<00:01:19.619> i<00:01:19.650> think<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.130> v2<00:01:20.490> gundam

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
recycled one here i think the v2 gundam

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.969 
recycled one here i think the v2 gundam
will<00:01:21.090> finally<00:01:21.479> get<00:01:21.600> it<00:01:21.750> to<00:01:21.869> do<00:01:21.990> after<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.590> v1

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
will finally get it to do after the v1

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.740 
will finally get it to do after the v1
depending<00:01:23.369> on<00:01:23.460> how<00:01:23.580> well<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:23.880> v<00:01:24.030> 1<00:01:24.180> dash<00:01:24.420> sold

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
depending on how well the v 1 dash sold

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.840 
depending on how well the v 1 dash sold
and<00:01:24.960> stuff<00:01:25.200> like<00:01:25.350> that<00:01:25.409> but<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.280> v2<00:01:26.549> gundam

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
and stuff like that but the v2 gundam

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.719 
and stuff like that but the v2 gundam
really<00:01:27.330> does<00:01:27.630> deserve<00:01:28.350> a<00:01:28.560> lot<00:01:28.890> of<00:01:28.920> love<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:29.220> in

really does deserve a lot of love and in

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.249 
really does deserve a lot of love and in
gundam<00:01:30.000> vs<00:01:30.299> gundam<00:01:30.630> it's<00:01:30.810> quite<00:01:31.020> a<00:01:31.049> popular

let's<00:02:54.750> go<00:02:54.930> with<00:02:55.110> the<00:02:55.290> gundam<00:02:56.250> if<00:02:56.580> only<00:02:56.880> because

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
let's go with the gundam if only because

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.670 
let's go with the gundam if only because
it's<00:02:57.390> an<00:02:57.480> amoureux<00:02:57.720> suit<00:02:58.049> it<00:02:58.260> looks<00:02:58.500> so

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
it's an amoureux suit it looks so

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.800 
it's an amoureux suit it looks so
classic<00:02:59.010> takes<00:02:59.430> the<00:02:59.640> old<00:02:59.940> design<00:03:00.180> gives<00:03:00.630> it<00:03:00.750> a

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
classic takes the old design gives it a

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.840 
classic takes the old design gives it a
modern<00:03:00.989> twist<00:03:01.319> and<00:03:01.739> i<00:03:02.250> think<00:03:02.280> that<00:03:02.549> that<00:03:02.700> would

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
modern twist and i think that that would

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.670 
modern twist and i think that that would
be<00:03:02.910> a<00:03:03.060> very<00:03:03.239> difficult<00:03:03.510> master<00:03:04.019> grade<00:03:04.260> and<00:03:04.500> nor

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
be a very difficult master grade and nor

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.199 
be a very difficult master grade and nor
would<00:03:04.799> it<00:03:04.860> be<00:03:05.010> a<00:03:05.040> large<00:03:05.250> size<00:03:05.519> one<00:03:05.760> so<00:03:06.030> it's

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
would it be a large size one so it's

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.870

we will be getting a unicorn full armor
version<00:03:13.590> the<00:03:13.680> one<00:03:13.830> where<00:03:13.980> it<00:03:14.069> has<00:03:14.250> these<00:03:14.459> three

shields the bazookas and the Gatling
guns<00:03:17.910> it's<00:03:18.690> just<00:03:18.900> a<00:03:18.989> question<00:03:19.109> of<00:03:19.320> I<00:03:19.410> figured

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
guns it's just a question of I figured

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.500 
guns it's just a question of I figured
it<00:03:19.799> would<00:03:19.920> come<00:03:20.100> out<00:03:20.130> when<00:03:20.700> the<00:03:20.730> one<00:03:21.420> it

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
it would come out when the one it

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.569 
it would come out when the one it
actually<00:03:21.810> shows<00:03:22.019> up<00:03:22.230> in<00:03:22.350> the<00:03:22.470> anime<00:03:22.829> with<00:03:23.459> the

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:23.579 
actually shows up in the anime with the

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:25.580 
actually shows up in the anime with the
green<00:03:23.790> interframe<00:03:24.150> however<00:03:24.660> I<00:03:24.930> think<00:03:25.380> that

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
green interframe however I think that

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.380 
green interframe however I think that
I'm<00:03:25.920> a<00:03:26.100> milk<00:03:26.310> that<00:03:26.519> cow<00:03:26.700> a<00:03:26.730> little<00:03:27.030> bit<00:03:27.150> early

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
I'm a milk that cow a little bit early

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.080 
I'm a milk that cow a little bit early
so<00:03:27.420> it<00:03:27.690> could<00:03:27.900> make<00:03:28.049> an<00:03:28.200> appearance<00:03:28.440> this<00:03:28.769> year

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
so it could make an appearance this year

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.520 
so it could make an appearance this year
perhaps<00:03:30.090> that's<00:03:30.239> just<00:03:30.359> wishful<00:03:30.930> thinking

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
perhaps that's just wishful thinking

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.470 
perhaps that's just wishful thinking
continuing<00:03:32.519> with<00:03:32.640> some<00:03:32.790> wishful<00:03:32.970> thinking

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
continuing with some wishful thinking

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.199

how<00:03:33.630> about<00:03:33.690> the<00:03:34.049> master<00:03:34.380> grade<00:03:34.590> seed<00:03:34.920> destiny

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
how about the master grade seed destiny

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:37.280 
how about the master grade seed destiny
seed<00:03:36.209> doesn't<00:03:36.510> get<00:03:36.600> a<00:03:36.630> lot<00:03:36.690> of<00:03:36.870> love<00:03:37.109> I<00:03:37.230> don't

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
seed doesn't get a lot of love I don't

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:38.509 
seed doesn't get a lot of love I don't
think<00:03:37.530> we're<00:03:37.620> ever<00:03:37.709> going<00:03:37.859> to<00:03:37.950> get<00:03:38.040> a<00:03:38.100> justice

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
think we're ever going to get a justice

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:40.880 
think we're ever going to get a justice
or<00:03:38.670> things<00:03:38.850> like<00:03:38.940> that<00:03:39.060> but<00:03:39.420> legend<00:03:40.079> was<00:03:40.739> on

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
or things like that but legend was on

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.099 
or things like that but legend was on
the<00:03:41.040> survey<00:03:41.430> of<00:03:41.579> the<00:03:41.730> top<00:03:41.910> 30<00:03:42.299> that<00:03:42.630> band<00:03:42.810> i<00:03:42.959> was

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:43.109 
the survey of the top 30 that band i was

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:44.990 
the survey of the top 30 that band i was
looking<00:03:43.440> at<00:03:43.560> and<00:03:43.769> looking<00:03:43.890> for<00:03:44.220> fan<00:03:44.400> input<00:03:44.820> I

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
looking at and looking for fan input I

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.060 
looking at and looking for fan input I
think<00:03:45.630> legend<00:03:45.900> has<00:03:46.019> a<00:03:46.049> shot<00:03:46.380> just<00:03:46.709> to<00:03:46.739> complete

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.070 
think legend has a shot just to complete

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:48.680 
think legend has a shot just to complete
the<00:03:47.220> seed<00:03:47.459> destiny<00:03:47.640> lineup<00:03:48.269> and<00:03:48.450> it<00:03:48.540> would

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
the seed destiny lineup and it would

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.330 
the seed destiny lineup and it would
look<00:03:48.870> pretty<00:03:49.079> awesome<00:03:49.470> don't<00:03:50.070> hold<00:03:50.250> your

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
breath for Providence although I'd like

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.590 
breath for Providence although I'd like
that<00:03:51.840> too<00:03:52.140> but<00:03:53.100> continuing<00:03:53.700> with<00:03:53.850> newer<00:03:54.120> suits

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
that too but continuing with newer suits

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.809 
that too but continuing with newer suits
not<00:03:54.870> a<00:03:54.930> lot<00:03:55.109> of<00:03:55.140> you<00:03:55.290> see<00:03:55.530> on<00:03:55.709> here<00:03:55.890> for<00:03:56.100> me<00:03:56.250> but

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:56.819 
not a lot of you see on here for me but

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:58.520 
not a lot of you see on here for me but
i'm<00:03:57.180> going<00:03:57.329> to<00:03:57.420> say<00:03:57.510> sub<00:03:57.720> Danya<00:03:58.140> and<00:03:58.350> the

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
i'm going to say sub Danya and the

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.530 
i'm going to say sub Danya and the
reason<00:03:58.799> I<00:03:58.890> say<00:03:58.920> that<00:03:59.130> is<00:03:59.340> just<00:03:59.730> because<00:04:00.030> after

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
reason I say that is just because after

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.270 
reason I say that is just because after
the<00:04:00.810> double-o<00:04:01.260> quanta<00:04:01.620> if<00:04:01.680> the<00:04:01.829> master<00:04:01.980> great

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
the double-o quanta if the master great

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.580 
the double-o quanta if the master great
sold<00:04:02.549> well<00:04:02.819> these<00:04:03.600> abana<00:04:04.049> and<00:04:04.350> the<00:04:04.440> other

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
sold well these abana and the other

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.410 
sold well these abana and the other
movie<00:04:04.950> kits<00:04:05.190> don't<00:04:05.489> have<00:04:05.700> one<00:04:05.910> one-hundredth

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
movie kits don't have one one-hundredth

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.300 
movie kits don't have one one-hundredth
non<00:04:06.630> grade<00:04:06.989> so<00:04:07.290> rather<00:04:07.500> than<00:04:07.680> carry<00:04:07.950> them<00:04:08.130> I

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
non grade so rather than carry them I

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.099 
non grade so rather than carry them I
think<00:04:08.819> it<00:04:08.910> would<00:04:09.030> be<00:04:09.060> zamania<00:04:09.480> that<00:04:09.750> gets<00:04:09.930> the

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:10.109 
think it would be zamania that gets the

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:12.229 
think it would be zamania that gets the
next<00:04:10.350> shot<00:04:10.560> and<00:04:10.920> then<00:04:11.370> depending<00:04:11.790> on<00:04:11.910> how<00:04:12.030> well

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
next shot and then depending on how well

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:14.900 
next shot and then depending on how well
that<00:04:12.420> sells<00:04:12.750> harout<00:04:13.170> and<00:04:13.410> Raphael<00:04:13.859> may<00:04:14.459> follow

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
that sells harout and Raphael may follow

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.779 
that sells harout and Raphael may follow
and<00:04:15.329> in<00:04:16.079> the<00:04:16.200> double<00:04:16.470> O<00:04:16.530> line<00:04:16.739> the<00:04:17.340> Susanoo

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:17.789 
and in the double O line the Susanoo

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:20.629 
and in the double O line the Susanoo
which<00:04:18.660> was<00:04:18.930> a<00:04:19.289> gram<00:04:19.560> is<00:04:19.799> incredibly<00:04:20.370> popular

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:20.639 
which was a gram is incredibly popular

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:23.180

I<00:04:23.669> really<00:04:24.150> think<00:04:24.300> that<00:04:24.419> the<00:04:24.599> Susanoo<00:04:24.870> is<00:04:25.200> a

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:25.229 
I really think that the Susanoo is a

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:26.570 
I really think that the Susanoo is a
great<00:04:25.770> kit<00:04:26.070> that

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:16.199 
many master grades I think 12 is

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:18.230 
many master grades I think 12 is
probably<00:05:16.590> a<00:05:16.710> little<00:05:16.949> bit<00:05:17.129> optimistic<00:05:17.370> perhaps

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 
probably a little bit optimistic perhaps

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.180 
probably a little bit optimistic perhaps
but<00:05:18.990> what<00:05:19.199> about<00:05:19.500> some<00:05:19.680> of<00:05:19.770> the<00:05:19.830> other<00:05:19.949> lines

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:20.190 
but what about some of the other lines

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:21.409 
but what about some of the other lines

is going to be the mark 2 and then my
