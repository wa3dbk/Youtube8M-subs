00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:09.630
 I love that I am a rainbow of 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.240
 issues we are video one Thursday 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.769
 today we are in the mental blog of Thursday 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.350
 before starting with continued 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:19.740
 here left her below and I was going to 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.600
 say as proof because in the last 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.910
 videos have not seen a lot ie not 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.449
 I saw a lot you would participate on 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:30.449
 exalt on your part and perhaps because 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.850
 the gameplay was on destiny maybe who knows 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.649
 what other reason however we say that not 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.829
 I saw a holding part 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:41.309
 situation an participation is equal 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:44.340
 to the other, wired and superior to the other 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.899
 goals while or so people live 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.170
 already a nice live below for support e 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.750
 I recommend commenting on 100,000 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.070
 your thing today we speak if not 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.969
 call of Duty 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:59.840
 then watching this week here in 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.350
 around the web I found two things 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:05.010
 secure 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.420
 then one made in the link that I will make you 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.040
 see the video clip below 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.860
 even if you have seen it all by now 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:14.520
 while that other call of duty world at 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:17.490
 war ii that we are here today to discuss 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.409
 of this these two new ones at one 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.970
 of the chapters that should be there is one of the 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.820
 two should come out or none of the 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.100
 two is in my opinion they are both fake 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.020
 even if on world war ii I would put them there 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.460
 hands on 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.860
 maybe it could be a good war 2 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.350
 but let's say that on that other one instead 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.869
 borderlands border border in the call of 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.750
 duty borderlands and borderline 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:42.150
 I think there will be no one in my opinion 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.960
 powdery instead will be a happy one is a 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.640
 piece 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.150
 because I think so now you will stand 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.340
 simply asking why looking 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.440
 here here always videoricette every 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.210
 year I swear that at least once a 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:57.750
 trailer also beak a thing of this 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:00.180
 genus q fake and you are always seen indeed 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.770
 I think it will do something that I have that is 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.140
 already denied I do not know that either 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.970
 will disprove soon I think it's ok 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:10.410
 then we have these two chapters here 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:11.310
 the world tour and borderline border e 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.640
 borderline 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:17.400
 then according to the world at war 2 se 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:20.910
 had to look for him to go out and have one 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:23.640
 immense fear that it is a war 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.800
 futuristic still because why 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.780
 simply when black ops came out 1 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:31.410
 at the precaution exit all yes 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:33.989
 imagined a past tails it seems 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:36.870
 so was the present the past the 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:39.120
 past present with the city black ops there is 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:43.080
 the title if I already knew that a cod of 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.850
 past and while the black ops 21 sets 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.769
 who would have thought it had been 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.780
 when the future of tone and we are at 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:51.000
 maximum at many regimes then it is 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.620
 liked no it's another thing because a 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.209
 barely liked the same however must 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.870
 hold up very badly when he has 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:03:00.090
 said the co of the future, however, few 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.190
 or gaits according to me will happen 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.560
 almost the same thing 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:09.030
 and now tour one is structured on 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:11.220
 second world war while the 2nd 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.890
 I think they will do it in the future I don't know 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:16.530
 what links I don't know how I don't know 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.500
 nothing but my opinion is mine 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:21.390
 thought they will do it in the 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.520
 in the future, what do you think about it? 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:25.380
 about world tour 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.240
 but wait before commenting 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.980
 look at some video talkers 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.580
 where the fuck is he left to look under 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.950
 your 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:34.050
 according to me, world tour will be 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:38.010
 positive photo if a good one comes out 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:42.410
 war 2 while on borderline a title that 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.410
 it's too weird known horner type 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:50.040
 they don't sound like call of duty boden 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:52.770
 but never say never obviously said 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:56.160
 that is, they are already spreading 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:59.160
 many clues within the web of 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:01.709
 of coins manasse bride concerns i 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:04.740
 next call of duty then news 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:06.959
 as there are clues like those that can 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:09.030
 give those who are giving excuses 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:10.950
 lately on call of duty that 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:13.800
 obviously if you watch juan videos 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:16.519
 or is followed wagno you will already know of 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:18.630
 what I'm talking about using umbria 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:21.090
 how many other things are 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:22.620
 saying that they still leave certain 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.880
 sometimes they leave invitations I do n't know 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.560
 because but every time he logs in 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:29.940
 this place always or by the ears 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:31.950
 redheads there is a case and nothing is there this can 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.419
 in my opinion we say about the two chapters 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:35.520
 tell me yours 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:37.500
 tell me what you would like to see 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.510
 they are built of the past of the future 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.760
 of the president of the middle of the fra 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:45.360
 a year ago between two of the colonies 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:47.160
 of easy tell me that since second there is the 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.169
 cod that you would like what you think 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.969
 Sara 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:53.430
 because I'm telling you to talk about this 

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:55.590
 because obviously we are in the month that 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:58.139
 now let's say something should have been 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.939
 hopefully also because it is now a bridge 

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:02.279
 that is, it seems to be me 

00:04:59.939 --> 00:05:05.189
 released yesterday, however, is now there for months 

00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:07.560
 boh to me honestly it is strange then 

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:09.240
 nothing if this country we say for 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:12.150
 allow Thursday 2 we talk about 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.979
 We therefore discuss 10,000 things together 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:15.749
 leave me below in the comments 

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:17.819
 remember to do it and leave some 

00:05:15.749 --> 00:05:19.860
 live but I don't want to see you active 

00:05:17.819 --> 00:05:22.139
 all some tv even if it is slowly 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.729
 grows we grow quietly it doesn't matter 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:26.490
 if we reach 10,000 births it will be 

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:28.919
 impossible but slowly the assets e 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:31.139
 so nothing I remember as always 10 

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:33.449
