00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
damn it just feels so good and it's just

damn it just feels so good and it's just
I<00:01:01.950> just<00:01:02.160> don't<00:01:02.460> want<00:01:02.580> to<00:01:02.610> use<00:01:02.730> any<00:01:02.760> other<00:01:03.030> lmg

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
I just don't want to use any other lmg

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.840 
I just don't want to use any other lmg
that's<00:01:04.080> just<00:01:04.379> how<00:01:04.500> good<00:01:04.770> it<00:01:04.890> is<00:01:04.920> and<00:01:05.040> if<00:01:05.400> you

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
that's just how good it is and if you

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.460 
that's just how good it is and if you
look<00:01:06.000> at<00:01:06.120> the<00:01:06.210> weapon<00:01:06.479> stats<00:01:06.690> and<00:01:06.960> compared<00:01:07.290> to

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
look at the weapon stats and compared to

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.870 
look at the weapon stats and compared to
one<00:01:07.650> of<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.830> better<00:01:07.979> assault<00:01:08.310> rifles<00:01:08.700> like

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
one of the better assault rifles like

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.110 
one of the better assault rifles like
let's<00:01:09.270> say<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.660> the<00:01:10.470> m416<00:01:11.070> everyone<00:01:11.760> seems<00:01:12.060> to

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:12.120 
let's say the the m416 everyone seems to

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.810 
let's say the the m416 everyone seems to
like<00:01:12.270> that<00:01:12.510> one<00:01:12.860> everything<00:01:13.860> except<00:01:14.430> for<00:01:14.729> the

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
like that one everything except for the

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.440 
like that one everything except for the
recoil<00:01:15.350> the<00:01:16.350> m49<00:01:17.009> is<00:01:17.400> statistically<00:01:18.240> better

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
recoil the m49 is statistically better

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.469 
recoil the m49 is statistically better
than<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.410> m416<00:01:19.890> so<00:01:20.790> that's<00:01:21.210> kind<00:01:21.450> of

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
than the m416 so that's kind of

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.830 
than the m416 so that's kind of
interesting<00:01:21.690> the<00:01:22.440> m249<00:01:23.160> has<00:01:23.580> more<00:01:23.910> range<00:01:24.240> more

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
interesting the m249 has more range more

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.719 
interesting the m249 has more range more
bullet<00:01:25.170> speed<00:01:25.410> and<00:01:25.649> a<00:01:25.680> high<00:01:25.770> rate<00:01:26.009> of<00:01:26.040> fire<00:01:26.190> and

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
bullet speed and a high rate of fire and

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.540 
bullet speed and a high rate of fire and
a<00:01:26.759> lot<00:01:27.420> more<00:01:27.450> led<00:01:28.110> to<00:01:28.350> spit<00:01:28.590> out<00:01:28.619> but<00:01:29.430> that<00:01:29.460> I

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:29.550 
a lot more led to spit out but that I

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.540 
a lot more led to spit out but that I
mean<00:01:29.790> it's<00:01:29.940> got<00:01:30.060> a<00:01:30.090> large<00:01:30.540> magazine<00:01:30.810> size<00:01:31.550> at

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:32.550 
mean it's got a large magazine size at

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.480 
mean it's got a large magazine size at
recoil<00:01:33.000> on<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.360> m249<00:01:34.110> is<00:01:34.410> very<00:01:34.619> manageable<00:01:35.130> it

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
recoil on the m249 is very manageable it

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.249 
recoil on the m249 is very manageable it
pulls<00:01:35.790> up<00:01:35.970> a<00:01:36.119> little<00:01:36.390> bit<00:01:36.509> up<00:01:36.660> and<00:01:36.990> to<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.170> left

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
pulls up a little bit up and to the left

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.840 
pulls up a little bit up and to the left
so<00:01:37.649> the<00:01:37.770> only<00:01:37.890> thing<00:01:37.979> you<00:01:38.190> really<00:01:38.310> have<00:01:38.430> to<00:01:38.640> do

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
so the only thing you really have to do

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.639 
so the only thing you really have to do
to<00:01:39.119> counter<00:01:39.390> that<00:01:39.540> is<00:01:39.780> dragging<00:01:40.229> your<00:01:40.320> gun

00:01:40.639 --> 00:01:40.649 
to counter that is dragging your gun

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:43.460 
to counter that is dragging your gun
down<00:01:40.920> a<00:01:41.490> little<00:01:41.850> bit<00:01:42.030> too<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:42.899> left<00:01:43.110> I'm

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
down a little bit too to the left I'm

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.590 
down a little bit too to the left I'm
sorry<00:01:43.950> to<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.250> right<00:01:44.460> yeah<00:01:45.090> that<00:01:45.360> makes<00:01:45.510> more

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
sorry to the right yeah that makes more

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.770 
sorry to the right yeah that makes more
sense<00:01:46.700> it's<00:01:47.700> very<00:01:47.880> easy<00:01:47.970> to<00:01:48.150> do<00:01:48.360> with<00:01:48.659> the

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
sense it's very easy to do with the

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.020 
sense it's very easy to do with the
mouse<00:01:48.990> and<00:01:49.409> it's<00:01:49.860> a<00:01:49.920> very<00:01:49.950> small<00:01:50.370> adjustment

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
mouse and it's a very small adjustment

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.600 
mouse and it's a very small adjustment
really<00:01:51.330> don't<00:01:51.570> need<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:51.720> overdo<00:01:52.020> it<00:01:52.170> on

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
really don't need to overdo it on

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.190 
really don't need to overdo it on

players<00:01:55.380> out<00:01:55.680> there<00:01:55.710> I<00:01:55.920> know<00:01:56.100> you're<00:01:56.280> out

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
players out there I know you're out

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.180 
players out there I know you're out
there<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:56.670> you're<00:01:56.909> watching<00:01:57.060> videos<00:01:58.040> it's<00:01:59.040> a

00:01:59.180 --> 00:01:59.190 
there and you're watching videos it's a

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:00.649 
there and you're watching videos it's a
little<00:01:59.430> bit<00:01:59.520> trickier<00:01:59.909> for<00:01:59.940> you<00:02:00.270> to<00:02:00.390> counter

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
little bit trickier for you to counter

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.120 
little bit trickier for you to counter
that<00:02:00.780> kind<00:02:00.990> of<00:02:01.049> recoil<00:02:01.380> I<00:02:01.590> know<00:02:01.650> that<00:02:01.950> because

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
that kind of recoil I know that because

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.160 
that kind of recoil I know that because
I<00:02:02.280> used<00:02:02.400> to<00:02:02.520> play<00:02:02.610> on<00:02:02.760> xbox<00:02:03.150> and<00:02:03.600> it's<00:02:03.780> not<00:02:03.960> easy

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
I used to play on xbox and it's not easy

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.710 
I used to play on xbox and it's not easy
especially<00:02:04.320> on<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:04.799> LMGs<00:02:05.190> so<00:02:05.850> what<00:02:06.540> I<00:02:06.570> would

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 
especially on the LMGs so what I would

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.560 
especially on the LMGs so what I would
advise<00:02:07.260> you<00:02:07.290> guys<00:02:07.470> to<00:02:07.680> do<00:02:08.010> is<00:02:08.280> just<00:02:08.310> like<00:02:08.850> fire

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:09.570 
advise you guys to do is just like fire

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:11.930 
advise you guys to do is just like fire
smaller<00:02:10.140> bursts<00:02:10.950> pretty<00:02:11.310> much<00:02:11.489> so<00:02:11.700> that<00:02:11.850> the

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
smaller bursts pretty much so that the

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.789 
smaller bursts pretty much so that the

00:02:13.789 --> 00:02:13.799 
gun doesn't have that too big of a

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:16.340 
gun doesn't have that too big of a
chance<00:02:14.070> to<00:02:14.250> drift<00:02:14.519> off<00:02:14.730> your<00:02:15.420> target<00:02:15.900> too<00:02:16.110> much

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
chance to drift off your target too much

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.280 
chance to drift off your target too much
now<00:02:17.070> I<00:02:17.100> did<00:02:17.580> have<00:02:17.820> one<00:02:18.150> small<00:02:18.630> issue<00:02:18.660> with<00:02:19.140> this

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
now I did have one small issue with this

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.229 
now I did have one small issue with this
weapon<00:02:19.530> although<00:02:20.010> the<00:02:20.190> recoil<00:02:20.640> is<00:02:20.880> very<00:02:21.090> easy

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
weapon although the recoil is very easy

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.509 
weapon although the recoil is very easy
to<00:02:21.360> manage<00:02:21.660> i<00:02:22.080> noticed<00:02:22.890> that<00:02:23.010> i<00:02:23.130> wasn't

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
to manage i noticed that i wasn't

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:25.550 
to manage i noticed that i wasn't
getting<00:02:23.880> too<00:02:24.209> many<00:02:24.330> hitmarkers<00:02:25.019> sometimes<00:02:25.410> on

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
getting too many hitmarkers sometimes on

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.380 
getting too many hitmarkers sometimes on
my<00:02:25.650> enemies<00:02:25.980> you<00:02:26.130> know<00:02:26.220> even<00:02:26.400> though<00:02:26.670> i<00:02:26.940> had<00:02:27.209> my

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
my enemies you know even though i had my

my enemies you know even though i had my
sights<00:02:27.690> right<00:02:28.049> on<00:02:28.290> them<00:02:28.620> so<00:02:29.280> I<00:02:29.310> packed<00:02:29.549> up<00:02:29.730> my

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
sights right on them so I packed up my

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.520 
sights right on them so I packed up my
gun<00:02:30.120> I<00:02:30.360> caught<00:02:30.750> the<00:02:30.900> first<00:02:31.080> flight<00:02:31.260> to<00:02:31.380> the

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
gun I caught the first flight to the

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.440 
gun I caught the first flight to the
testing<00:02:31.890> range<00:02:32.070> and<00:02:32.250> decided<00:02:33.000> to<00:02:33.090> jump<00:02:33.299> out

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
testing range and decided to jump out

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.060 
testing range and decided to jump out
and<00:02:33.630> parachute<00:02:33.690> onto<00:02:34.200> the<00:02:34.410> island<00:02:34.769> because

son of a bitch so I'm on the island you
know<00:02:47.160> to<00:02:47.220> test<00:02:47.489> out<00:02:47.640> the<00:02:47.760> gun<00:02:48.000> and<00:02:48.030> I<00:02:48.390> start

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
know to test out the gun and I start

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.180 
know to test out the gun and I start
firing<00:02:48.900> at<00:02:49.080> the<00:02:49.230> wall<00:02:49.410> and<00:02:49.440> I<00:02:49.620> noticed<00:02:50.069> that

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
firing at the wall and I noticed that

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.120 
firing at the wall and I noticed that
the<00:02:50.670> spread<00:02:51.030> on<00:02:51.060> the<00:02:51.300> m249<00:02:52.050> really<00:02:52.560> starts<00:02:53.040> to

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
the spread on the m249 really starts to

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.320 
the spread on the m249 really starts to

firing between let's say 20 to 25 shots
while<00:02:57.270> performing<00:02:57.720> a<00:02:57.990> magnum<00:02:58.380> so<00:02:59.160> I<00:02:59.580> did<00:03:00.540> a

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
while performing a magnum so I did a

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.390 
while performing a magnum so I did a
little<00:03:00.810> bit<00:03:01.020> more<00:03:01.200> research<00:03:01.410> checked<00:03:02.250> out

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
little bit more research checked out

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.490 
little bit more research checked out
some<00:03:02.640> stats<00:03:02.970> on<00:03:03.300> sim<00:03:03.630> thick<00:03:03.870> got<00:03:04.110> back<00:03:04.290> through

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
some stats on sim thick got back through

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.650 
some stats on sim thick got back through
testing<00:03:04.860> range<00:03:05.010> and<00:03:05.190> I<00:03:05.310> found<00:03:05.580> out<00:03:05.790> that<00:03:06.060> the

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
testing range and I found out that the

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.660 
testing range and I found out that the
best<00:03:06.900> attachment<00:03:07.620> combo<00:03:07.980> to<00:03:08.040> counter<00:03:08.520> that

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
best attachment combo to counter that

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.390 
best attachment combo to counter that
spread<00:03:09.090> is<00:03:09.330> the<00:03:09.630> stubby<00:03:10.110> /<00:03:10.440> potato<00:03:10.860> grip<00:03:11.220> which

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
spread is the stubby / potato grip which

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.880 
spread is the stubby / potato grip which
by<00:03:11.550> the<00:03:11.610> way<00:03:11.700> people<00:03:11.970> is<00:03:12.390> not<00:03:12.840> edible<00:03:13.050> I<00:03:13.440> tried

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
by the way people is not edible I tried

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.640 
by the way people is not edible I tried
it<00:03:14.040> it<00:03:14.430> it's<00:03:15.060> it's<00:03:15.360> not<00:03:15.630> edible<00:03:15.810> don't<00:03:16.530> even

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
it it it's it's not edible don't even

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.360 
it it it's it's not edible don't even
ask<00:03:16.830> me<00:03:17.010> how<00:03:17.100> I<00:03:17.160> try<00:03:17.490> it<00:03:17.550> don't<00:03:18.180> ask<00:03:19.310> so<00:03:20.310> you

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
ask me how I try it don't ask so you

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.460 
ask me how I try it don't ask so you
combine<00:03:20.550> that<00:03:20.730> with<00:03:21.240> just<00:03:21.900> a<00:03:22.020> stock<00:03:22.260> barrel

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
combine that with just a stock barrel

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.020 
combine that with just a stock barrel
pretty<00:03:22.830> much<00:03:22.950> and<00:03:23.160> that's<00:03:23.250> it<00:03:23.580> you<00:03:23.820> know<00:03:23.910> the

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
pretty much and that's it you know the

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.420 
pretty much and that's it you know the
compensator<00:03:24.630> will<00:03:25.380> give<00:03:25.680> you<00:03:25.830> less<00:03:26.100> recoil

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
compensator will give you less recoil

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.240 
compensator will give you less recoil
but<00:03:26.850> it<00:03:26.940> will<00:03:27.060> give<00:03:27.210> you<00:03:27.330> more<00:03:27.480> spread<00:03:28.040> and<00:03:29.040> I

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
but it will give you more spread and I

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.820 
but it will give you more spread and I
will<00:03:29.460> take<00:03:29.700> less<00:03:30.120> spread<00:03:30.570> over<00:03:31.050> less<00:03:31.530> recoil

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
will take less spread over less recoil

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:34.520 
will take less spread over less recoil
any<00:03:32.340> day<00:03:32.760> of<00:03:32.790> the<00:03:32.940> week<00:03:33.060> because<00:03:33.780> recoil<00:03:34.290> is

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
any day of the week because recoil is

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.850 
any day of the week because recoil is
manageable<00:03:35.010> and<00:03:35.250> can<00:03:35.459> be<00:03:35.580> countered<00:03:36.030> however
