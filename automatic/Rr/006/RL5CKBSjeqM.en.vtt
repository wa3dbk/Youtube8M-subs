00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:13.260
 Once again, I greet all those gathered 

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:15.880
 and big 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:19.270
 to set out nurses dozens of onions 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:22.990
 I want to bring to you to teach ethics that already 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:24.760
 several months the office of the people 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:28.810
 human institution 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:31.500
 I spend a place with other specialists 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:36.540
 classes in Slavic Vedic 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:39.700
 culture and self awareness some 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.970
 I think that Slavic Vedic culture 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:46.000
 this is such a deep past where just 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:48.010
 need to be near the fire and jump on 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.890
 this is all Slavic Vedic culture 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:54.550
 ends really knowing this 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:57.520
 just a knowledge system and by and large 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.840
 I consider myself to be more likely to not even 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.900
 a man of the past 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:05.590
 them present and a man who goes 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:09.040
 from present to future because all 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:12.009
 the knowledge that is in the Vedas is that 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:14.939
 gives us the opportunity to build and our 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:17.650
 the future is the future of all mankind 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:20.829
 you may have heard of such a scientist 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:25.119
 because of traitors oppenheimer which 

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:28.960
 invented monthly god invented in america 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:33.329
 nukes but you know with what with 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.329
 what book did he go 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:44.049
 yes he loved to quote 

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:47.139
 and when passed the tests of nuclear weapons 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:49.929
 he said that he quoted 

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:53.200
 quote from mahabharata where they were described 

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:54.960
 similar tests like the use of 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.200
 similar weapons in 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:01.710
 this jealousy is also known that matte 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:04.700
 Croatian wanted china and in fact many 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:08.789
 all the people who made these or other 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:10.229
 modern discoveries that give 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.660
 development for the future 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:17.550
 they just studied Vedic culture 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:20.550
 and today I learned that we have sanatoriums 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:23.790
 a lot of common topics in principle because 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:26.190
 which is also in the framework of physical education 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:30.120
 because Vedic culture is like 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:31.280
 I would ritual life is partly 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:35.610
 stories 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:38.870
 Partly this and other science but I in the first 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:41.930
 turn doing science self-awareness 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:46.860
 self-awareness is the main science of the Vedas and 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:48.690
 let's say srila prabhupada so called 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.890
 even one of his books is science 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.320
 self-awareness 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:55.489
 because in the Vedas everywhere emphasized 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:59.220
 the importance of awareness and 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:03:01.980
 unconsciousness and not to mindfulness and 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:05.910
 unawareness all problems arise 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:08.610
 in fact humanity as a whole so 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:11.940
 and every single person if 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:14.010
 Someone does not believe you think somewhere 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:20.239
 someone is bad just because I'm ready 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:24.450
 prove to the factor that of personally personal 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:25.670
 misunderstandings are not personally aware or 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:30.550
 bowels 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:33.260
 and stem problem in principle people 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:37.580
 that's as far as classes are concerned 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:38.180
 but the very awareness of the Vedic classes 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:41.870
 culture 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:46.430
 they pass every sunday office 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:48.880
 national institute should be a man 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:52.330
 provided business cards other cart 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:56.480
 also since i do the information 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:58.970
 according to the national spirit of man, I want 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:04.640
 say that if you have any 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:08.060
 articles of your self-awareness experience your 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:10.160
 some personal developments then i will 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:14.480
 glad if you have accordingly 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:15.430
 desire to place your information on 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:19.900
 the site 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:23.510
 maybe some of you want to speak 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:25.639
 appropriate video so people don't 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:28.419
 only our team 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:31.250
 but also a wider audience 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:35.450
 humanity were able to familiarize themselves and 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:38.990
 join your spiritual experience but 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:43.360
 In principle, I wish you success 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:43.360
 development of our section
