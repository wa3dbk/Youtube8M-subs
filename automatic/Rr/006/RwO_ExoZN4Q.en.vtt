00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.870
 tips and advice with your arms to see the 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.910
 arms women are also very 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.910
 strong now where are they 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:57.300
 james 65 50 college of employment in health 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:01.200
 flora here a lot of sun a lot of atmosphere 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:03.690
 clear a lot of beauty and muscle 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:06.510
 and now what are we going to start with a 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.600
 betrayal routine you can change it 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.760
 If you want, you can do a lot of weight and 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.980
 is for more muscle mass you can do 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.810
 more repetitions with less weight for a 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:19.860
 definition in this case I migas yanexi 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.930
 the ceilings intensity to a definition I 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.520
 I'm going to make it a little stronger for 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.320
 a southern muscle mass 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.370
 you can change them a week you can 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:31.770
 do with a kiss even moderate to 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.780
 increase muscle mass and one day what 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.670
 can do with repetitions have to 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.430
 be varied because if not the body does not 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.130
 is going to change you 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:43.229
 obviously you can have a definition 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.909
 yes because it varies between 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.360
 certain bikinis categories a little more 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:50.970
 slight lighter and a little bit more is in 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:54.630
 Exact calm more marked not so much 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:57.710
 good volume but a good symmetry 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.710
 let's start 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:05.210
 my friends 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.009
 Never 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.100
 yes 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.310
 we are making little balls a little more 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.760
 volume 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:41.980
 you can increase the wings and the 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:44.440
 repetitions we are going to do four series 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:47.049
 of 20 repetitions each as they 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.879
 I say everything also the weight depends on the 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:51.700
 combat discs or if they are allowing 

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:53.819
 Orientation parties should keep that 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:57.890
 symmetry 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:57.890
 now he's doing practically 20 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.510
 Hello 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.220
 ok friend here my friend installing 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.840
 a little more weight doing well 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.810
 repetitions and those some 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:18.390
 categories of figures that messi either 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:23.000
 muscle mass is using one more weight 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:23.000
 heavy few repetitions do not you feel 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.270
 let's go 3 more 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:33.330
 of stress and now let's move on to another 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:36.510
 exercise without explaining that there are four 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:38.990
 series of 20 repetitions each with 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.990
 Lightweight 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:44.880
 your muscle mass 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:47.610
 second year of 13 as it came 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:50.310
 saying let's do 4 sets of 20 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:53.099
 repetitions each always the first 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.840
 repeat series is always counted the 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:57.360
 repetition of serial input is counted 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.910
 as heating and the three 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:02.310
 remaining are the strong to a boy of 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:04.350
 crumbs is no longer doing so to another 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.940
 weight as we were saying more 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:09.550
 definition arms thinner more tone 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:12.120
 not so marked and when I'm going to show you 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:12.120
 the look 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:23.120
 two 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:27.490
 ah 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:35.460
 we are not going to a kind of machine a bit 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:38.600
 more tense 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.600
 let's do it now yes 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.720
 4 

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:52.479
 6 nothing else 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:52.479
 we say 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:05:00.200
 ok now alexandra will not be able a little 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:02.570
 more weight because this category of 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:04.190
 calculation needs to increase a little more than 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:09.139
 do fewer repetitions 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:14.440
 away from those 25 also from your body 

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:14.440
 is conditioned to be enough 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:35.700
 We will not be passed to a next 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.700
 we will be 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:44.150
 he combed it well
