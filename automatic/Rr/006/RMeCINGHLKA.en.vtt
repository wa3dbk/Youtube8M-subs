00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:47.969 
that event and you'll see why in a

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:50.240 
that event and you'll see why in a
couple<00:01:48.270> of<00:01:48.299> weeks<00:01:48.359> I<00:01:48.719> cannot<00:01:49.289> move<00:01:49.619> that<00:01:49.679> event

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.889 
couple of weeks I cannot move that event
and<00:01:50.460> I<00:01:50.609> am<00:01:50.729> very<00:01:50.759> much<00:01:51.119> looking<00:01:51.149> forward<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:51.780> it

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
and I am very much looking forward to it

and I am very much looking forward to it
and<00:01:52.049> I<00:01:52.380> think<00:01:52.679> when<00:01:52.890> you<00:01:53.070> see<00:01:53.369> it<00:01:53.490> that<00:01:53.880> I

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
and I think when you see it that I

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.340 
and I think when you see it that I
understand<00:01:54.390> why<00:01:54.570> I<00:01:54.600> can't<00:01:54.960> push<00:01:55.200> the

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
understand why I can't push the

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.859 
understand why I can't push the
tournament<00:01:55.770> back<00:01:55.950> anymore<00:01:56.399> I<00:01:56.789> very<00:01:57.359> much<00:01:57.450> hope
