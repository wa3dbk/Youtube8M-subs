00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:14.580
 the southeast is passing by one of the 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.150
 dried 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:20.100
 perhaps the drought is bravest and the last 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.980
 years in the last decades 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.750
 and this situation is not far from thinking of 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.269
 reversal during the winter months 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.640
 because at this time of year it rains 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.349
 least in areas such as the 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.620
 great São Paulo who suffers with 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:37.079
 supply systems at their levels 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.430
 much lower than the normal 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.520
 this situation should not be different 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.280
 this year with the presence of the chicken in 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.440
 generally the cold fronts that are 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.270
 basically the only sources of rainfall 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.820
 at this time of the year they were restricted 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:54.539
 much in the extreme south of the country 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.219
 with this July / August of these two 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.530
 months must stay and with normal rainfall 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.600
 below the average in September may 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.270
 rain in practically every 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.280
 The areas we used are a very bumpy show by 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.170
 example it may rain above average here 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.780
 region or in the north-east of 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.159
 mines and the holy spirit in some 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.030
 areas of north of são paulo triangle 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.070
 miner 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.049
 but it's a rain, right? 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.110
 much expression in relation to volumes 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:21.600
 should generally continue to rain 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.640
 little in the next three months as it is 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.409
 normal for the time of year 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.540
 if the cold fronts do not have facility 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.700
 to reach southeastern Brazil 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.590
 generalized temperature and 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.880
 stay above normal 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.430
 The first question that we can not then 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.799
 have good cold is not so is the 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.530
 cold it will arrive but with little 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:43.740
 intensity and only in a few days 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.530
 in general we took the three months 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:50.659
 or even month to month on average 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.659
 we'll be hotter than normal
