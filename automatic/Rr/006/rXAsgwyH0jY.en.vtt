00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.760 
that's made to replace a 60 watt
incandescent<00:00:14.790> and<00:00:15.330> it<00:00:16.049> does<00:00:16.199> a<00:00:16.230> good<00:00:16.410> job<00:00:16.470> of

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
incandescent and it does a good job of

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.740 
incandescent and it does a good job of
it<00:00:16.830> it<00:00:16.949> puts<00:00:17.130> out<00:00:17.279> 800<00:00:17.520> lumens<00:00:18.029> compared<00:00:18.660> to

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
it it puts out 800 lumens compared to

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.019 
it it puts out 800 lumens compared to
the<00:00:18.840> 880<00:00:19.650> you'll<00:00:19.890> get<00:00:20.130> from<00:00:20.550> an<00:00:20.670> incandescent

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
the 880 you'll get from an incandescent

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.509 
the 880 you'll get from an incandescent
so<00:00:21.510> it's<00:00:21.720> plenty<00:00:22.410> bright<00:00:22.619> enough<00:00:22.859> now<00:00:23.369> this

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
so it's plenty bright enough now this

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
that's a great deal that bulb is a very

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.590 
that's a great deal that bulb is a very
tough<00:00:41.280> act<00:00:41.460> to<00:00:41.550> follow<00:00:41.640> so<00:00:42.180> this<00:00:42.329> is<00:00:42.450> their

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
tough act to follow so this is their

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.000 
tough act to follow so this is their
follow<00:00:42.809> this<00:00:43.020> is<00:00:43.170> their<00:00:43.260> attempt<00:00:43.649> at<00:00:43.770> it<00:00:43.890> and

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
follow this is their attempt at it and

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.369 
follow this is their attempt at it and
what<00:00:44.370> they've<00:00:44.520> done<00:00:44.820> is<00:00:45.120> they've<00:00:45.539> made<00:00:45.570> a<00:00:45.780> very

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
what they've done is they've made a very

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.950 
what they've done is they've made a very
strong<00:00:46.739> effort<00:00:46.980> to<00:00:47.280> increase<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.850> CRI<00:00:48.420> which

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
strong effort to increase the CRI which

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.049 
strong effort to increase the CRI which
is<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.260> color<00:00:49.620> rendering<00:00:50.100> index<00:00:50.370> of<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:50.850> bulb

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
is the color rendering index of the bulb

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.000 
is the color rendering index of the bulb
and<00:00:51.270> that's<00:00:51.750> why<00:00:51.930> this<00:00:52.020> bulb<00:00:52.379> has<00:00:52.620> kind<00:00:52.949> of

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
and that's why this bulb has kind of

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.740 
and that's why this bulb has kind of
this<00:00:53.129> bluish<00:00:53.399> hue<00:00:53.820> it's<00:00:54.059> got<00:00:54.210> a<00:00:54.239> little<00:00:54.600> bit<00:00:54.690> of

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
this bluish hue it's got a little bit of

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.139 
this bluish hue it's got a little bit of
a<00:00:54.809> tacky<00:00:55.199> feel<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.770> it<00:00:55.890> and<00:00:56.039> all<00:00:56.430> of<00:00:56.820> that<00:00:56.850> is

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
a tacky feel to it and all of that is

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.240 
a tacky feel to it and all of that is
part<00:00:57.539> of<00:00:57.660> an<00:00:57.780> effort<00:00:57.930> to<00:00:58.109> make<00:00:58.260> it<00:00:58.440> better<00:00:58.980> at

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
part of an effort to make it better at

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.459 
part of an effort to make it better at
rendering<00:00:59.579> colors<00:01:00.030> now<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.449> CRI<00:01:00.809> score<00:01:01.289> which

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
rendering colors now the CRI score which

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.670 
rendering colors now the CRI score which
runs<00:01:01.739> from<00:01:02.010> 1<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.309> 100<00:01:02.579> being<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.270> best<00:01:03.480> is<00:01:03.719> 93

bowl<00:01:33.420> of<00:01:33.540> cereal<00:01:33.780> using<00:01:34.320> just<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.799> Cree<00:01:35.040> light

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
bowl of cereal using just the Cree light

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.399 
bowl of cereal using just the Cree light
to<00:01:35.520> see<00:01:35.729> how<00:01:35.970> nice<00:01:36.659> it<00:01:36.689> makes<00:01:36.930> these<00:01:37.079> colors

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
to see how nice it makes these colors

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.200 
to see how nice it makes these colors
look<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:37.920> then<00:01:38.280> for<00:01:38.430> comparison<00:01:38.970> we'll<00:01:39.150> do

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
look and then for comparison we'll do

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.990 
look and then for comparison we'll do
the<00:01:39.329> same<00:01:39.509> thing<00:01:39.810> with<00:01:40.229> a<00:01:40.259> basic<00:01:40.860> standard<00:01:41.130> 60

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
the same thing with a basic standard 60

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.819 
the same thing with a basic standard 60
watt<00:01:42.150> incandescent<00:01:42.299> bulb<00:01:42.960> so<00:01:43.530> I'll<00:01:43.619> go<00:01:43.799> ahead

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
watt incandescent bulb so I'll go ahead

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.170 
watt incandescent bulb so I'll go ahead
and<00:01:44.130> I'll<00:01:44.189> take<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.490> Cree<00:01:44.700> bulb<00:01:44.939> and<00:01:45.090> I'll

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
and I'll take the Cree bulb and I'll

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.999 
and I'll take the Cree bulb and I'll
screw<00:01:45.509> it<00:01:45.540> into<00:01:45.720> this<00:01:45.990> apparatus<00:01:46.320> here<00:01:46.590> and

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
screw it into this apparatus here and

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.370 
screw it into this apparatus here and
we're<00:01:47.939> gonna<00:01:48.030> hold<00:01:48.240> it<00:01:48.390> up<00:01:48.420> above<00:01:48.750> let's<00:01:49.259> go

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
we're gonna hold it up above let's go

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.590 
we're gonna hold it up above let's go
ahead<00:01:49.439> and<00:01:49.619> kill<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:49.829> lights

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
ahead and kill the lights

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.630 
ahead and kill the lights
so<00:01:51.990> here<00:01:52.140> we<00:01:52.230> have<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.560> Cree<00:01:52.920> light<00:01:53.220> and<00:01:53.460> only

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
so here we have the Cree light and only

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.430 
so here we have the Cree light and only
the<00:01:53.909> cria<00:01:54.120> light<00:01:54.300> illuminating<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.020> cereal

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:55.440 
the cria light illuminating the cereal

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.560 
the cria light illuminating the cereal
and<00:01:55.650> as<00:01:55.979> you<00:01:56.130> can<00:01:56.250> see<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.640> colors<00:01:56.909> do<00:01:57.210> look<00:01:57.479> a

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
and as you can see the colors do look a

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.480 
and as you can see the colors do look a
little<00:01:57.720> bit<00:01:57.960> more<00:01:58.080> vivid<00:01:58.530> in<00:01:58.650> my<00:01:58.680> opinion<00:01:59.190> now

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
little bit more vivid in my opinion now

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.280 
little bit more vivid in my opinion now
here<00:01:59.820> we<00:02:00.030> have<00:02:00.060> an<00:02:00.300> incandescent<00:02:00.630> bulb<00:02:01.110> this

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
here we have an incandescent bulb this

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.650 
here we have an incandescent bulb this
is<00:02:01.470> 60<00:02:01.800> watts<00:02:02.010> this<00:02:02.250> is<00:02:02.430> the<00:02:02.670> comparable<00:02:03.450> bulb

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:03.660 
is 60 watts this is the comparable bulb

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.359 
is 60 watts this is the comparable bulb
to<00:02:03.900> the<00:02:03.930> Cree<00:02:04.290> this<00:02:04.740> is<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:04.920> type<00:02:05.070> of<00:02:05.100> bulb

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
to the Cree this is the type of bulb

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.250 
to the Cree this is the type of bulb
you'd<00:02:05.520> replace<00:02:05.790> using<00:02:06.210> this<00:02:06.300> crea<00:02:06.570> light<00:02:06.750> and

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:07.260 
you'd replace using this crea light and

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.230 
you'd replace using this crea light and
we're<00:02:07.409> gonna<00:02:07.530> hold<00:02:07.740> this<00:02:07.890> up<00:02:08.100> right<00:02:08.820> above<00:02:09.119> the

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 
we're gonna hold this up right above the

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:10.609 
we're gonna hold this up right above the
cereal<00:02:09.630> just<00:02:09.959> like<00:02:10.140> before

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
cereal just like before

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.620 
cereal just like before
let<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.400> filament<00:02:11.820> stop<00:02:12.000> wobbling<00:02:12.450> there<00:02:12.600> a

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
let the filament stop wobbling there a

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.830 
let the filament stop wobbling there a
little<00:02:12.810> bit<00:02:13.020> and<00:02:13.320> just<00:02:14.330> like<00:02:15.330> that<00:02:15.510> we<00:02:15.660> see

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
little bit and just like that we see

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.080 
little bit and just like that we see
that<00:02:16.170> it<00:02:16.500> looks<00:02:16.620> fine<00:02:16.980> you<00:02:17.250> can<00:02:17.400> see<00:02:17.730> it<00:02:17.850> you

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
that it looks fine you can see it you

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.610 
that it looks fine you can see it you
could<00:02:18.270> eat<00:02:18.450> this<00:02:18.600> bowl<00:02:18.959> of<00:02:19.080> cereal<00:02:19.260> in<00:02:19.560> the

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
could eat this bowl of cereal in the

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:20.900 
could eat this bowl of cereal in the
middle<00:02:19.980> of<00:02:20.040> the<00:02:20.130> night<00:02:20.310> if<00:02:20.459> you<00:02:20.580> use<00:02:20.700> this

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
middle of the night if you use this

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.850 
middle of the night if you use this
light<00:02:21.180> but<00:02:21.660> the<00:02:21.750> colors<00:02:22.110> might<00:02:22.380> not<00:02:22.620> look

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
light but the colors might not look

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.070 
light but the colors might not look
quite<00:02:23.100> as<00:02:23.250> vivid<00:02:23.940> as<00:02:24.090> the<00:02:24.270> Cree<00:02:24.510> looks<00:02:24.750> and

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
quite as vivid as the Cree looks and

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.470 
quite as vivid as the Cree looks and
this<00:02:25.620> is<00:02:25.739> because<00:02:26.070> the<00:02:26.250> incandescent<00:02:26.640> is<00:02:27.120> not

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
this is because the incandescent is not

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.600 
this is because the incandescent is not
going<00:02:27.810> to<00:02:27.900> be<00:02:28.050> as<00:02:28.260> accurate<00:02:28.709> at<00:02:29.220> rendering

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
going to be as accurate at rendering

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
going to be as accurate at rendering
colors<00:02:30.000> as<00:02:30.209> the<00:02:30.450> Cree<00:02:30.750> TW<00:02:31.380> series<00:02:32.540> so<00:02:33.540> the

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
colors as the Cree TW series so the

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.690 
colors as the Cree TW series so the
question<00:02:34.020> is<00:02:34.170> is<00:02:34.410> that<00:02:34.500> worth<00:02:35.130> it<00:02:35.310> is<00:02:35.489> that

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
question is is that worth it is that

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.729 
question is is that worth it is that
worth<00:02:35.880> seven<00:02:36.330> dollars<00:02:36.630> more<00:02:36.660> especially<00:02:37.620> if

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
worth seven dollars more especially if

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:39.949 
worth seven dollars more especially if
you<00:02:37.890> are<00:02:38.040> sacrificing<00:02:38.370> a<00:02:38.940> little<00:02:39.090> bit<00:02:39.360> of<00:02:39.540> the

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
you are sacrificing a little bit of the

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:41.750 
you are sacrificing a little bit of the
energy<00:02:40.320> efficiency<00:02:40.739> of<00:02:40.920> the<00:02:41.040> bulb<00:02:41.250> for<00:02:41.610> most

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
energy efficiency of the bulb for most

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.340 
energy efficiency of the bulb for most
consumers<00:02:42.060> I<00:02:42.390> think<00:02:42.630> that<00:02:42.750> efficiency<00:02:43.200> is

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
consumers I think that efficiency is

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.800 
consumers I think that efficiency is
probably<00:02:43.950> the<00:02:44.130> top<00:02:44.340> priority<00:02:45.030> so<00:02:45.450> I<00:02:45.630> would

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
probably the top priority so I would

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.290 
probably the top priority so I would
recommend<00:02:46.290> the<00:02:46.530> previous<00:02:47.010> cree<00:02:47.280> LED<00:02:47.430> bulb<00:02:47.910> but

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
recommend the previous cree LED bulb but

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.030 
recommend the previous cree LED bulb but
if<00:02:48.420> you<00:02:48.510> want<00:02:48.780> that<00:02:48.959> high<00:02:49.140> CRI<00:02:49.620> if<00:02:49.769> you<00:02:49.890> want

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
if you want that high CRI if you want

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.590 
if you want that high CRI if you want
accurate<00:02:50.459> colors<00:02:50.790> if<00:02:50.970> you're<00:02:51.090> displaying

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
accurate colors if you're displaying

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.990 
accurate colors if you're displaying
artwork<00:02:52.050> and<00:02:52.290> you<00:02:52.709> have<00:02:52.890> a<00:02:52.920> lot<00:02:53.190> of<00:02:53.220> need<00:02:53.820> for

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.640 
artwork and you have a lot of need for
that<00:02:54.150> type<00:02:54.330> of<00:02:54.390> bulb<00:02:54.720> this<00:02:55.140> is<00:02:55.320> a<00:02:55.350> fabulous

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
that type of bulb this is a fabulous

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.199 
that type of bulb this is a fabulous
bowl<00:02:56.040> you'll<00:02:56.220> be<00:02:56.340> very<00:02:56.519> happy<00:02:56.790> with<00:02:56.940> it
