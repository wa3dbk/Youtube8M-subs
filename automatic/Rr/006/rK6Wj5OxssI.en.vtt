a look got me right off the bat and I

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.200 
a look got me right off the bat and I
was<00:00:40.200> like<00:00:40.350> this<00:00:40.500> is<00:00:40.559> what<00:00:40.739> I<00:00:40.770> need<00:00:41.010> so<00:00:41.370> what<00:00:42.030> was

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
was like this is what I need so what was

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.360 
was like this is what I need so what was
it<00:00:42.390> about<00:00:42.510> this<00:00:42.899> that<00:00:43.200> made<00:00:44.100> you<00:00:44.219> decide

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
it about this that made you decide

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.540 
it about this that made you decide
against<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.090> 240sx<00:00:45.750> um<00:00:46.350> just<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:46.860> GTS<00:00:47.340> i

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
against the 240sx um just the GTS i

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.430 
against the 240sx um just the GTS i
guess<00:00:47.730> i<00:00:48.000> thought<00:00:48.390> i<00:00:48.420> had<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.629> cleaner<00:00:48.930> look<00:00:49.200> the

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
guess i thought i had a cleaner look the

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.069 
guess i thought i had a cleaner look the
240<00:00:50.070> i<00:00:50.100> was<00:00:50.309> looking<00:00:50.579> at<00:00:50.700> had<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.660> guy<00:00:51.840> had

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
240 i was looking at had the guy had

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.500 
240 i was looking at had the guy had
done<00:00:52.289> some<00:00:52.710> I<00:00:53.129> guess<00:00:53.850> he<00:00:54.000> had<00:00:54.090> put<00:00:54.239> a<00:00:54.300> little

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
done some I guess he had put a little

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.420 
done some I guess he had put a little
bit<00:00:54.660> of<00:00:54.719> done<00:00:55.050> a<00:00:55.079> little<00:00:55.289> bodywork<00:00:55.649> put<00:00:56.129> a<00:00:56.160> body

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
bit of done a little bodywork put a body

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.639 
bit of done a little bodywork put a body
kit<00:00:56.730> on<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.120> front<00:00:57.570> part<00:00:57.840> but<00:00:58.079> not<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.260> sides

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
kit on the front part but not the sides

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.639 
kit on the front part but not the sides
and<00:00:59.480> really<00:01:00.480> just<00:01:00.629> I<00:01:00.780> guess<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.140> solid

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
and really just I guess the solid

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.490 
and really just I guess the solid
original<00:01:02.280> GTS<00:01:02.879> sort<00:01:03.719> of<00:01:03.780> just<00:01:03.960> kind<00:01:04.170> of<00:01:04.260> one

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
original GTS sort of just kind of one

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.170 
original GTS sort of just kind of one
