00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:13.280
Hello, welcome to Caskeing TV. Today with a new aluminium chassis.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:21.800
Not from one of the brands you would think of probably.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:29.640
I think you would guess the wrong brand here. This case comes from Xigmatek

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:37.400
It´s called Gigas and comes in a decent 
 brushed aluminium look in silver and black.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:47.280
So Xigmatek has an aluminium chassis and we will 
 have a closer look how good they do.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:57.160
First detail you can see is that the front 
 and side panels are bent from one piece.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:05.200
You find a DVD/BluRay stealth bezel and another slot 
 below in the front of the cube.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:17.240
In the front panel we find audio jacks, power and reset 
 buttons, one USB 3.0 and two USB 2.0 jacks.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:31.480
In the left side panel we find some air vents for 
 the power supply, we come back on that later,

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:39.520
and additional vents for PCI cards like graphics cards.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:51.600
Two 120 mm fans are pre-installed in the front, very 
 slow fans to have a very silent case.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:02:01.520
In the back two of the same silent fans 
 pre-installed, so a lot of fans included.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:08.840
Branding is also done decent and elegant.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:19.600
The air vents in the front are done as an X for Xigmatek.

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:26.240
The only written logo can be found on the 
 top. Small X with the Xigmatek name.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:41.560
Let´s have a look inside. Different camera position for better inside look this time.

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:48.600
On the top you find two cages secured by screws.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:03:02.840
After loosening them you can dismount the 5,25" 
 drive cage and the HDD cage underneath.

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.040
All drives anti vibration mounted of course. 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:13.600
And the second one sliding towards the front for dismounting.

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:23.160
A lot of space for Micro ATX case, 4 PCI slots for that standard

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:33.280
You may fit a CPU cooler with 16 cm height. 
 Quite a lot of possible cooling power. 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:39.000
Xigmatek recommends a tower CPU cooler with 16 cm height.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:54.240
Length / depth offers a space of 32 cm for high 
 end graphics cards to do a high end system.

00:03:54.240 --> 00:04:04.120
Two fans in the front and two in the back.

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:18.200
The upper side air vents are intended for the power supply, 
 which also has a lot of space for mounting.

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:33.560
That was it with the Gigas aluminium chassis from Xigmatek, I 
 hope we see us next time on Caseking TV.
