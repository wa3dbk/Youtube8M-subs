00:00:05.149 --> 00:00:13.210
 title let's learn 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.930
 remove the password from windows 2.1 of 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:18.860
 Login 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:21.910
 that is sometimes annoying but so 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:21.910
 good for safety 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.000
 we do not know is to remove it put in my 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.740
 annoying occasion 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.260
 I do not think I have the problem 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.440
 to leave mind of my computer but 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.510
 by some and how good is this 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.039
 tutorial let's start 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.039
 first let's go to the start menu 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:51.110
 for those who have this menu here in 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.110
 execute that execute 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:57.720
 this one that is here if they do not have that menu 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.840
 start they go here in the part 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.360
 lower 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:05.320
 we will seek and we can here too 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.320
 write run 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.980
 and express will come out the same 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.370
 let's write this that is 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:15.210
 here it is black 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.210
 p lewis 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.610
 like of lewis 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:24.080
 the infection of the video is so that it 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:28.250
 they copy and paste it we are going to accept 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:30.380
 this window will come out but with a 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.150
 little difference that these will have 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:36.800
 marked 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:38.659
 so be it as well as it will guide you 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.800
 we go 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:43.730
 select 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:47.710
 your account 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:50.070
 eye that says administrator 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:53.390
 which is what they use I imagine 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:57.150
 once we click to select it 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:58.920
 and we are going to click on the one to select 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.840
 this option users should write 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.150
 your name and password to use for 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:07.210
 use the equipment we go to select 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:09.130
 and we will make accept as I said being in 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:12.160
 your administrator account 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:15.450
 let's apply we 're going to place the 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.450
 password that we currently have 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.340
 they are just going to place this time more nothing 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:29.690
 let's accept 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:32.240
 and here we have accepted 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.660
 once we do this let's restart 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:37.620
 our computer 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.940
 and the time to start we will not have 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:43.530
 have to put the password 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:45.959
 but windows will start directly 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:49.069
 I do not do the test here for the obvious 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:50.990
 why sing and if not 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:53.750
 no gravel 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:56.450
 when what is being restarted but 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:03:01.680
 I assure you that this will be 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:04.330
 well this was the tutorial today 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.540
 I hope you liked it 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:10.650

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.650
