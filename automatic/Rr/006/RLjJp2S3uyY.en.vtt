00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.230
 hello to all and mona 29 07 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.480
 and today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.680
 any new video tutorial where I'm going 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.220
 teach you how to put your 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.020
 your pc headset here the siberia for 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.380
 example who is also mayor had 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.820
 asked for forgiveness on your ps3 easily 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.369
 good it will have to do some shopping 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.219
 but it will return in total between 0 and 10 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.890
 euros 10 euros maximum 

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:37.290
 so I think a lot of people are going 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.180
 to be able to do it so we will start 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.800
 by the speaker level because there will be 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.510
 small speaker categories and 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.870
 micro because it takes very different not 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.270
 plugged so the title is for the 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.149
 people or who have helmets coming out 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.070
 of two sons like that green and red but 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.199
 you do not see on the camera is what 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.670
 it's just on the end so for the 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.070
 speaker it will have you bring 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.440
 of a cable triton pincemoi I have a cable 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.660
 triangle one must find to the parent who 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.030
 is green female on this side for dec 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.070
 and red and white on that side the 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.590
 particularity is that on the other side 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.080
 you can connect there will 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.590
 two plants of too many females for 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.060
 plug in other cables so it's very 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.360
 simple i will show you you have 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:25.049
 just plug the cable into the 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:28.049
 green hole and that will connect you to your 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:30.600
 amp or on your TV depending on the location 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.790
 where you have your sound and the other 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.189
 side you plug the sound coming out of 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.640
 your ps3 on red and white otherwise it 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:43.320
 not walk so that this little cable 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:45.299
 costs about last it costs $ 10 / on 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.040
 the triton site which is about 6.7 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.290
 euros but you can find it for 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.750
 cheaper but at all costs 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.820
 then the holes in the back that 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.810
 soloist as we will go to 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.610
 microphone our dishes it's a cable 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.540
 like that you will need to bring a 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.520
 small karski box 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:06.640
 which is an external sound card that 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.770
 costs between 1 and 5 euros on 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.990
 internet could go to the store but 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.250
 I'm not sure it's necessarily 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:13.930
 but with a little research 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.090
 would not close to him for a euro on 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.310
 yves and it works nickel and the sound is 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.440
 super so it's simple there is a small 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.230
 hole to put back the pickups you 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.780
 plug in 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.640
 then here I put an extension to 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.830
 my ps3 but it's like you plug in 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.690
 on the usb sockets a nephew do not occupy 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.180
 of this this is not too long for the 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.850
 video you just have to plug in the 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.630
 case on and it lights up you 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.090
 just go in settings 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:42.610
 accessories modify the device 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.410
 entry and exit and normally that 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.200
 should walk 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:50.800
 so that's the total tutorial is coming to an end 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:53.110
