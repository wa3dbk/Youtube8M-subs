00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:10.330
 Welcome on 

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:17.140
 extinct and we visit again 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:20.140
 and Malenkov in his amazing greenhouses 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:24.100
 where is a collection of different unusual 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:27.029
 plants and citrus and but different 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:31.480
 tropical species and today we have 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:34.050
 such an unusual lot here watermelon but 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:38.290
 watermelon is some kind of extraordinary 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:41.320
 tell me what sort of grade I don't know from and 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:43.900
 you do not know well, in general, the story is 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.600
 then last year to familiar neighbors 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.640
 went to Thailand and brought 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.649
 spoke very tasty watermelon there ate in 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.760
 Thailand is small here such 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:54.640
 somewhere in a kilo 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:57.579
 This and brought seeds from there well I 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.890
 not long think took this year in 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:03.100
 the pot wrote the exit videos and these are 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:05.560
 Here are watermelon grown they inside if their 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:08.229
 cut it is the wind we are already really it they 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.630
 inside yellow yellow crusts very 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:13.800
 thin or straight here literally 5 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:17.560
 millimeters is sweet and fragrant 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:20.709
 sweet and fragrant that is, we have a watermelon 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:24.869
 then almost did not smell and did not see 

00:01:20.709 --> 00:01:28.840
 it's all right here is 5 points 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.950
 Well, watermelon is such a refreshing welcome 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:34.149
 he smells 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:37.360
 perhaps even you are there ruining it straight 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:40.179
 called to the beds give us something driven 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:43.179
 them while on this pinched green some 

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:47.649
 withdrawn you don't reach to your 

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:50.439
 such a good condition and this 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:52.090
 the size reaches the maximum but no 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:54.069
 that's about a kilo they grow up 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:58.869
 which are these two watermelons that we ate 

00:01:54.069 --> 00:02:01.929
 they they burst right right so apparently 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:04.179
 it was I who poured them a lot they did it from 

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:08.410
 water hammer burst I thought but they 

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:11.620
 burst green onions when cut 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.690
 his already sweet straight gorgeous bones 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.709
 there are the same blueberries and little blacks 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.810
 small papers 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:21.610
 another interesting i can there he 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:22.569
 show here still many flowers and 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.690
 in this 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:28.599
 greenhouses you will be long enough 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:31.060
 warm yes yes probably I hope you will 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:33.190
 pinch that further so as not to 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.290
 evolved or so leave and how much 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.150
 grow your to grow to probably yes 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.989
 pinch because anyway already 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:42.630
 September we are here still ripening 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:45.760
 small raft 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:50.139
 so cute neat 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.580
 plates and inspect not so powerful 

00:02:50.139 --> 00:02:52.980
 and 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.590
 a little thick sense but now 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.240
 matures such well yes compared to 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:05.250
 ordinary watermelon he lived 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:08.040
 marked form so i want to say 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:11.100
 takes up quite a bit of space here somehow 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:14.610
 measures on the pots this time the seam with here 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:16.590
 this is all shoulders and even if we consider that 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:21.120
 that the pot is very tiny 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:23.580
 a half liter somewhere I think of it 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.620
 normal even if you plant them 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:29.430
 somewhere in the ground in the greenhouse they are us 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:32.209
 even give a good harvest tell 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:34.860
 please, that's what time you 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:35.490
 they planted like ordinary watermelons around May 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.640
 of the month 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:40.140
 here we are so I planted a pot 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:45.750
 so how could I any time 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:48.690
 plant put pot all here 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:52.260
 seedlings planted martin sometime in march on 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:55.280
 1 Well, and what kind of feeding like a normal 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:58.830
 pumpkin crops yes yes as usual all 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.870
 here I see that they are something just 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:03.000
 These were 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:07.620
 spraying citrus from the mite routine 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.280
 you tell them, in principle, this is them too 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.980
 I look 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:13.460
 periodically there was this speck 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:16.160
 our passed with a pony 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:18.760
 a carver that is well that is something special here 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:22.820
 kutunyo care 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:25.460
 Well, look here are expensive here 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:29.990
 charming fruits there further 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:31.550
 just two can still be shown too 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:35.330
 i will say i interrupt it 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:37.340
 It is able 4 bushes it planted it more 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:40.310
 4 bushes got stuck and so on 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:42.080
 some bushes plump it here 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:44.990
 so this stupor is long but 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:48.100
 since we will make it there again 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:51.860
 lie or there will be a second mine see 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:58.960
 here's another kid so hidden 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:58.960
 cute and here two 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:10.220
 here are these about debt tinki here 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:13.480
 such yellow melon watermelons from where else 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:16.580
 razochek Crimea from Thailand that Lansky 

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:18.770
 Watermelon can be grown in such 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:23.650
 greenhouse conditions probably in normal 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:23.650
 greenhouses can think too well
