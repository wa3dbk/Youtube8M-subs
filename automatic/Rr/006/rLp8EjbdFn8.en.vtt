00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
you can see it's taller so of course it

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.529 
you can see it's taller so of course it
will<00:00:56.280> be<00:00:56.370> doing<00:00:56.550> more<00:00:56.670> videos<00:00:56.730> comparing

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
will be doing more videos comparing

video today that people want to see is
the<00:01:02.370> boot<00:01:02.579> test<00:01:02.879> here<00:01:03.180> you<00:01:03.719> can<00:01:03.870> even<00:01:03.989> see

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
the boot test here you can even see

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.500 
the boot test here you can even see
their<00:01:04.470> also<00:01:04.920> when<00:01:05.070> I<00:01:05.100> was<00:01:05.339> in<00:01:05.549> when<00:01:06.390> i<00:01:06.450> was

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
their also when I was in when i was

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.750 
their also when I was in when i was
going<00:01:06.869> to<00:01:07.020> power<00:01:07.350> them<00:01:07.560> off<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:07.920> how<00:01:08.610> much

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
going to power them off and how much

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.420 
going to power them off and how much
much<00:01:09.119> more<00:01:09.330> vibrant<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:10.140> color<00:01:10.439> red<00:01:10.710> was<00:01:11.010> on

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
much more vibrant the color red was on

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.850 
much more vibrant the color red was on
the<00:01:11.580> iphone<00:01:11.820> 5<00:01:11.970> display<00:01:12.180> that<00:01:12.450> is<00:01:12.659> an<00:01:13.350> update

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
the iphone 5 display that is an update

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.030 
the iphone 5 display that is an update
in<00:01:14.220> terms<00:01:14.280> of<00:01:14.640> colors<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.470> with<00:01:16.470> more<00:01:16.619> vibrant

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
in terms of colors and with more vibrant

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.800 
in terms of colors and with more vibrant
than<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.490> earlier<00:01:17.909> iphones<00:01:18.299> like<00:01:18.509> that<00:01:18.659> from

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
than the earlier iphones like that from

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.920 
than the earlier iphones like that from
44s<00:01:19.770> which<00:01:20.460> is<00:01:20.610> pretty<00:01:20.790> nice<00:01:21.000> you<00:01:21.630> see<00:01:21.810> that

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
44s which is pretty nice you see that

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.170 
44s which is pretty nice you see that
the<00:01:21.990> beta<00:01:22.229> is<00:01:22.560> a<00:01:22.590> little<00:01:22.860> bit<00:01:22.950> slow<00:01:23.280> here<00:01:23.610> when

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
the beta is a little bit slow here when

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.999 
the beta is a little bit slow here when
you're<00:01:24.330> putting<00:01:24.570> it<00:01:24.780> off<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:25.409> putting<00:01:25.710> it

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
you're putting it off and putting it

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:33.289 
you're putting it off and putting it
down<00:01:26.780> let's<00:01:27.780> go<00:01:30.290> and<00:01:31.549> i<00:01:32.549> think<00:01:32.610> that<00:01:33.030> when<00:01:33.270> i

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
down let's go and i think that when i

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.880 
down let's go and i think that when i
did<00:01:33.540> this<00:01:33.810> boot<00:01:34.079> up<00:01:34.200> test<00:01:34.439> here<00:01:34.619> with<00:01:34.770> the

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
did this boot up test here with the

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.819 
did this boot up test here with the
iphone<00:01:35.220> 4<00:01:35.610> and<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:36.720> option<00:01:36.990> file<00:01:37.170> was<00:01:37.409> around

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
iphone 4 and the option file was around

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.340 
iphone 4 and the option file was around
10<00:01:38.040> to<00:01:38.130> 15<00:01:38.369> seconds<00:01:38.700> quicker<00:01:39.329> so<00:01:39.990> this<00:01:40.140> time

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
10 to 15 seconds quicker so this time

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.600 
10 to 15 seconds quicker so this time
we'll<00:01:40.500> probably<00:01:40.740> is<00:01:40.979> going<00:01:41.100> to<00:01:41.220> see<00:01:41.280> a<00:01:41.310> smaller

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
we'll probably is going to see a smaller

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.359 
we'll probably is going to see a smaller
maybe<00:01:42.000> five<00:01:42.270> seconds<00:01:42.600> quicker<00:01:42.979> iphone<00:01:43.979> 5<00:01:44.159> here

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
maybe five seconds quicker iphone 5 here

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.960 
maybe five seconds quicker iphone 5 here
compared<00:01:44.759> to<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:44.939> 4s<00:01:45.329> this<00:01:45.630> is<00:01:45.840> my<00:01:46.020> guess

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:55.039 

maybe<00:01:50.970> even<00:01:51.270> closer<00:01:53.479> maybe<00:01:54.479> around<00:01:54.869> three

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
maybe even closer maybe around three

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:03.160 
maybe even closer maybe around three
seconds

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.370 

okay<00:02:04.170> so<00:02:04.230> maybe<00:02:04.680> around<00:02:04.860> six<00:02:05.190> seven<00:02:05.610> seconds

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
okay so maybe around six seven seconds

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.810 
okay so maybe around six seven seconds
definitely<00:02:07.380> not<00:02:07.620> it's<00:02:07.950> super<00:02:08.340> far<00:02:08.640> behind

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:08.820 
definitely not it's super far behind

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:10.940 
definitely not it's super far behind
there<00:02:09.300> so<00:02:10.170> you<00:02:10.259> should<00:02:10.410> quickly<00:02:10.560> a<00:02:10.649> video

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
there so you should quickly a video

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.290 
there so you should quickly a video
checking<00:02:11.280> that<00:02:11.400> out<00:02:11.430> I'm<00:02:11.880> probably<00:02:11.970> going<00:02:12.210> to

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
checking that out I'm probably going to

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.000 
checking that out I'm probably going to
do<00:02:12.390> more<00:02:12.630> videos<00:02:12.990> check<00:02:13.530> out<00:02:13.650> the<00:02:13.800> browser

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
do more videos check out the browser
