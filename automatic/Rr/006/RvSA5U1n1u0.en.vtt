00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.580
 then to rejuvenate the face or even 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.649
 to keep it young we have to stimulate 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.250
 the collagen fibers because the fibers 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:13.110
 collagen is formed with birth 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:15.210
 they are all our life however with the 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.460
 time tend to decrease and even a little 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.680
 to give up then now is clear 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.660
 preparing a face for a while 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.720
 the trick is because the skin is a 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.820
 little hydrated then we will apply a gel and a 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.010
 three-pole handpiece with radio frequency 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.349
 which stimulates collagen fibers a 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.859
 contract and stimulate to form them 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.350
 new 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.960
 in america they call it the lifting of 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.450
 lunch break or launch therapy because 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.210
 in fact it is performed in half an hour not 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.910
 it's annoying and one can then go in 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:50.460
 office in store continue their own 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:54.059
 activity without redness or burns o 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.890
 ponfi that occur with other therapies 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.350
 then now this is the gel I owe 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.739
 announced first and then with this 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.409
 tripolar handpiece we're going to do 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:08.939
 of circular movements to stimulate the 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:11.520
 contraction by heat and light 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.560
 electricity coming out of this from 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.630
 this handpiece is not real 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.020
 electricity because radio frequency 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:22.049
 the one that is used precisely for 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:25.200
 stimulate fiber contraction 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:28.920
 collagen also has an effect on the skin 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.570
 because it reactivates the circulation and therefore 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.720
 also oxygenation now 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:37.450
 I'll show you when it's clear 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:40.510
 leave the machine and you will hear a 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.490
 slight heat and slight tension 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:44.619
 that will fade the moment we 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:48.100
 we have finished the treatment 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:53.259
 here are these small movements at the beginning 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:55.509
 you feel nothing but some small ones 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:57.040
 perception of heat then later you will feel 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:59.530
 all the part a little warmer in the 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.090
 moment in which you feel hot means it 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.970
 which has already been contracted and collagen 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.979
 we can move to another area 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.649
 the first three sessions are stimulation 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:10.750
 you can have a contraction and then we have 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:13.540
 a maintenance retention had 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.970
 done from the third to the eighth session 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.340
 who relies on these types of 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:21.430
 treatments you'll see that definitely 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.560
 when he is 50 60 70 he will not have 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.590
 need the classic facelift because 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:29.290
 practically it already holds the skin let's say 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:32.200
 as they say in america lift in this 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.390
 movement here we help see this 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:38.170
 movement from bottom to top 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:41.769
 after stimulating with heat in 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:45.420
 this helps to make the lifting effect either 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:48.970
 the maintenance maintenance effect 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:51.459
 liftato this is good for you who you are 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:54.940
 young to maintain however in people 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:55.690
 a little more with advanced age around 40 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.930
 and 50 years 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:02.790
 we see that in the turn of 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:05.140
 6 sets sitting the labial nose wrinkle that 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.780
 this one on the sides of the mouth that is 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:11.049
 quite marked comes to be reduced by 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:13.950
 50 percent because we have 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:13.950
 this lifting effect
