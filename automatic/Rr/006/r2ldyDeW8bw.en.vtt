supporting<00:00:25.320> multiple<00:00:25.470> locations<00:00:25.860> and<00:00:26.660> let's

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
supporting multiple locations and let's

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.630 
supporting multiple locations and let's
check<00:00:27.900> it<00:00:27.990> out<00:00:30.050> you'll<00:00:31.050> see<00:00:31.199> this<00:00:31.380> gives<00:00:32.220> you<00:00:32.400> a

available on unlike this body system

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.770 
available on unlike this body system
it's<00:01:13.890> a<00:01:13.979> very<00:01:14.640> good<00:01:14.820> very<00:01:15.119> very<00:01:15.479> very<00:01:15.659> good

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
it's a very good very very very good

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:24.790 
it's a very good very very very good
luck<00:01:20.870> now<00:01:21.870> it<00:01:22.050> chooses<00:01:22.500> a<00:01:22.530> safe<00:01:22.830> path<00:01:23.070> to<00:01:23.370> go<00:01:23.550> to

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:24.800 
luck now it chooses a safe path to go to

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:33.390 
luck now it chooses a safe path to go to
note<00:01:25.800> the<00:01:26.070> local<00:01:26.790> officers

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:33.400 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.230 

it's<00:01:34.090> an<00:01:34.210> excellent<00:01:34.540> but<00:01:34.870> actually<00:01:35.260> I<00:01:36.240> haven't

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
it's an excellent but actually I haven't

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.770 
it's an excellent but actually I haven't
used<00:01:37.480> it<00:01:37.600> very<00:01:37.630> much<00:01:37.870> but<00:01:39.120> I'm<00:01:40.120> testing<00:01:40.570> it<00:01:40.660> out

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
used it very much but I'm testing it out

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:52.830 
used it very much but I'm testing it out
and<00:01:40.960> it's<00:01:41.080> really<00:01:41.800> really<00:01:41.980> good

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:58.950 

and<00:01:53.439> just<00:01:54.450> exchanges<00:01:55.450> the<00:01:55.719> lobsters<00:01:56.140> and<00:01:57.960> it

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
and just exchanges the lobsters and it

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.910 
and just exchanges the lobsters and it
goes<00:01:59.109> back<00:01:59.140> and<00:01:59.560> does<00:01:59.619> the<00:01:59.710> same<00:01:59.829> thing<00:02:01.679> it<00:02:02.679> is

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
goes back and does the same thing it is

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.020 
goes back and does the same thing it is
a<00:02:03.189> very<00:02:03.310> very<00:02:03.819> efficient<00:02:04.390> code<00:02:04.659> pot<00:02:04.899> so<00:02:05.880> if<00:02:06.880> you

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
a very very efficient code pot so if you

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.400 
a very very efficient code pot so if you
probably<00:02:07.569> won<00:02:07.689> the<00:02:07.750> best<00:02:07.899> version<00:02:08.019> parts<00:02:08.349> you

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
probably won the best version parts you

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.430 
probably won the best version parts you
can<00:02:08.440> get<00:02:08.590> out<00:02:08.709> there<00:02:09.360> works<00:02:10.360> in<00:02:10.539> any<00:02:11.290> other

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
can get out there works in any other

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.229 
can get out there works in any other
locations<00:02:12.069> you<00:02:12.310> just<00:02:12.519> need<00:02:12.700> to<00:02:12.790> start<00:02:13.060> it<00:02:13.150> up

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:13.239 
locations you just need to start it up

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:16.890 
locations you just need to start it up
it<00:02:14.110> may<00:02:14.410> take<00:02:14.620> a<00:02:14.650> while<00:02:14.860> for<00:02:14.920> the<00:02:15.849> menu<00:02:16.569> to<00:02:16.720> pop

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
it may take a while for the menu to pop

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.589 
it may take a while for the menu to pop
up<00:02:17.220> because<00:02:18.220> it<00:02:18.340> needs<00:02:18.519> to<00:02:18.849> load<00:02:19.030> the<00:02:19.209> images

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599 
up because it needs to load the images

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:23.820 
up because it needs to load the images
but<00:02:19.840> once<00:02:20.080> it<00:02:21.269> comes<00:02:22.269> up<00:02:22.540> then<00:02:22.840> probably<00:02:23.590> fish

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
but once it comes up then probably fish

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.020 
but once it comes up then probably fish
in<00:02:23.950> any<00:02:24.099> location<00:02:25.890> you<00:02:26.890> guys<00:02:27.549> want<00:02:27.790> the<00:02:27.849> spot

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
in any location you guys want the spot

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.860 
in any location you guys want the spot
send<00:02:28.329> me<00:02:28.390> a<00:02:28.420> message<00:02:28.720> and<00:02:29.019> I<00:02:29.590> will<00:02:29.650> give<00:02:30.549> you

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
send me a message and I will give you

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.530 
send me a message and I will give you
the<00:02:31.870> bot<00:02:32.049> and<00:02:32.579> don't<00:02:33.579> don't<00:02:33.880> comment<00:02:34.120> saying

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
the bot and don't don't comment saying

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.030 
the bot and don't don't comment saying
that<00:02:34.660> you<00:02:34.750> want<00:02:34.930> the<00:02:34.989> bot<00:02:35.170> because<00:02:35.500> most

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
that you want the bot because most

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.460 
that you want the bot because most
likely<00:02:36.370> i<00:02:36.400> probably<00:02:36.700> won't<00:02:37.000> reply<00:02:37.269> or<00:02:37.569> I<00:02:38.049> just

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
likely i probably won't reply or I just

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.460 
likely i probably won't reply or I just
won't<00:02:38.739> see<00:02:38.950> it<00:02:39.420> but<00:02:40.420> remember<00:02:40.569> to<00:02:40.780> like<00:02:40.959> I'm

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
won't see it but remember to like I'm

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.309 
won't see it but remember to like I'm
going<00:02:41.590> to<00:02:41.680> like<00:02:41.769> it<00:02:41.799> and<00:02:42.870> that's<00:02:43.870> it<00:02:44.019> for<00:02:44.170> me

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319
