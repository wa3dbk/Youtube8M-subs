00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
temperatures as well and that's going to

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.050

as<00:01:39.210> we<00:01:39.360> head<00:01:39.509> to<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.659> weekend<00:01:40.079> here<00:01:40.290> low

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
as we head to the weekend here low

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.679 
as we head to the weekend here low
pressure<00:01:40.920> dominating<00:01:41.729> and<00:01:41.970> as<00:01:42.060> it<00:01:42.240> does<00:01:42.270> we're

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
pressure dominating and as it does we're

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.030

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
few days a few changes so we're cooling

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.440 
few days a few changes so we're cooling
first<00:01:52.799> and<00:01:53.070> then<00:01:53.340> by<00:01:53.460> next<00:01:53.820> week<00:01:54.030> we're
