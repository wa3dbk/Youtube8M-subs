00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 welcome to motocard.com he is neotec 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.350
 is a folding helmet that will be 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.929
 surprised more than one so much for their 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.330
 benefits as for your comfort in 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.940
 march is a helmet that belongs to the 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.490
 select group of folding helmets with 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.619
 fiber shell, in short, a helmet 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.720
 able to provide security and 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.560
 comfort in during all 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.560
 seasons 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.920
 for the construction of the shell he is 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:36.160
 neotec relies on the system 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:38.350
 m advanced integrated matrix which is a 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:41.110
 system by which there is a 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:44.400
 superposition of three layers of fiber 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:47.500
 organic and a multi fiber composite 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:51.940
 also the inner shell of the helmet is 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:54.550
 bs of two layers the system ay m what 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:57.699
 aims are two primary objectives 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:59.379
 one to offer great resistance and 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:01.780
 integrity of the helmet in case of a 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:04.930
 eventual impact and also 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:08.740
 reduce your weight the helmet set 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:10.149
 weighs about 1,600 grams something a very weight 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.810
 content if we take into account that 

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:15.820
 we are talking about a tourism helmet 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:19.240
 and that has built-in solar viewer 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:22.869
 integrated between the outer shell and the 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:25.770
 internal shell in gps in terms of 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:25.770
 helmet chinrest 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:31.819
 as a folding helmet that is found 

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:35.780
 that the chin bar can be lifted by 

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:38.600
 this button located inserted inside 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:41.539
 the chinrest does not protrude so it does not 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:45.740
 it can open accidentally and the 

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:49.579
 360 pivot locking system assures us a 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.980
 Easy set displacement and 

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:53.410
 soft 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:55.720
 we will also hear the clicks 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:58.680
 when the chin is raised and when 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:02.080
 is completely down for 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:04.020
 make sure that the set is 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:07.270
 completely open or completely 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.520
 closed there is another feature of the 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.160
 chin guard that needs to be mentioned and that is 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:15.190
 the number of 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:18.520
 moving parts of the chin bar 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:22.330
 in this way the helmet offers a greater 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:25.390
 integrity whole system 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:27.280
 Ventilation of the psoe neotec presents 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.880
 great advances compared to its predecessor 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:33.070
 the multi tech in fact the brand announces 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:37.860
 that the improvement of the ventilation system 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:40.640
 of the hull with respect to the multi tech is 1 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:43.220
 267% 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.860
 Soy neotec presents a grand opening 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:48.620
 located in the upper area of ​​the shell 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:51.370
 and has a mechanism for driving 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.370
 three positions 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.400
 Needless to say, it is very easy to 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.890
 handle even with gloves 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:01.310
 thick or winter opposite 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:03.650
 as for the chin guard the goal of 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:06.260
 the opening that we find in this area 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:09.920
 of the helmet is obviously to avoid 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:12.590
 or to prevent the appearance of steam in 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.330
 the inside of the screen just with 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.570
 press 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:21.200
 this opening we can open or close the 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:22.640
 passage of air in this area of the 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.310
 system that has been very studied 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.900
 presents some air channels to 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.480
 through the inner shell of the helmet 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.430
 to find your way out in the 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.720
 back of the shell that also 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.570
 we can 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.220
 act through an on-type tab 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:39.710
 off 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:43.310
 As for the vision of the helmet, you have to 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:47.540
 highlight the visor cn that one of him 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:50.840
 neotec that is very broad and that allows 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:53.780
 a large field of vision has a 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:56.960
 anti-fog and anti-scratch treatment and 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:58.970
 allows the incorporation of the sheet 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:02.660
 anti-fog pin lock that by the way comes 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:05.660
 standard with this helmet as for the 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:09.590
 solar viewer that has integrated into the 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:11.890
 the neotec psoe, we found that its 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:15.190
 drive 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:17.049
 is through this cam that we find in 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:19.650
 the left side of the helmet that we 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:23.130
 lets open 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:25.500
 or raise and lower this solar viewer 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.780
 very soft way 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:30.120
 this solar viewer also has a 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:32.840
 Anti-fog anti-scratch treatment and we 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:35.139
 protects 99% of the rays 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.749
 ultraviolet 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:41.520
 the interiors of the sun and neotec are 

00:04:37.749 --> 00:04:43.840
 they rely on a 3d quilt that offers 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:46.700
 comfort and ventilation in addition to 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:49.130
 isolation all 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:51.140
 Padding is removable and washable in addition 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:54.260
 It has been designed to be able to carry 

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:57.350
 spectacle rods 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:05:00.320
 and you see that here in your area at the base 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:02.950
 of the padding tends to close in 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:05.260
 pro of greater isolation 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:07.780
 you also have to comment that this 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:09.910
 Padded wants to offer an adjustment 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:12.520
 perfect and he gets it since when you 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:14.440
 you put the helmet 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:17.530
 the padding yields to return to its 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:20.860
 initial position and catch correctly 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:23.500
 all areas in an integral manner of the 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:25.540
 face and head you have to talk 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:27.220
 also from the soundproofing that is something 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:29.380
 a very important aspect in this helmet 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:31.690
 since thanks to this vortex that 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:33.540
 we found the helmet on the chin bar 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:36.520
 manages to generate some turbulence 

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:38.290
 around the helmet to avoid 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:41.680
 appearance of noise inside the 

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:44.470
 same and as final notes highlight 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:47.260
 that the closing of the psoe and neotec is the 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:48.940
 micrometer closure with the 

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:51.160
 particularity that we find that the 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:53.800
 metal buckle for safety 

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:57.370
 the micrometric closure is easy 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:59.680
 Adjust the sun and neotec also presents 

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:02.500
 some interiors that have been designed 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:06.970
 to house an intercom that is 

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:09.949
 the cardo sha1 the cardoose 1 

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:13.370
 in short you can see that it is a helmet 

00:06:09.949 --> 00:06:15.620
 which is a reference in helmets 

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:17.750
 folding with fiber shell 

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:19.849
 market and that has been designed so much 

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:21.680
 for users who need the bike 

00:06:19.849 --> 00:06:24.349
 for day to day as for those 

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:26.930
 users who need a helmet to 

00:06:24.349 --> 00:06:30.819
 make long routes any doubt or 

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:30.819
