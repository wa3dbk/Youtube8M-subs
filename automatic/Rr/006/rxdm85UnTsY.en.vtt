00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.460

 ballan concepts it's in London that everything 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.820
 starts at the end of the 90's at 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.770
 the time the chef at toul cochard opens 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.629
 his restaurant tamarind is a 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.980
 little revolution the place is glamorous 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.500
 sophisticated dishes 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.030
 success is immediate I think with 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.719
 an aggressiveness was already well established 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.910
 in the daily angles ike 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.730
 so suddenly there was a desire to 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.470
 renewal of news today 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.970
 in France a new generation of 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.619
 chefs and restaurateurs scented 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.619
 the opportunity to decrypt 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.030
 direction the little fine canteen 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.430
 Indian of the moment the noon wildlife 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.690
 trendy is found there many normal the 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.520
 place is friendly and pop 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.350
 here we play the menu of the kitchen 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.870
 merge evidence for the check 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.330
 mathias me I am of Indian origin 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:29.140
 but I grew up in France 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.510
 my grandparents are Indian have 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.710
 grown up in vietnam so the 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.930
 since I was little I learned the 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.240
 Indian cuisine is vegan a 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:38.680
 bar and Japanese associates and 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.080
 confidence and a few horizons 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.600
 different that made me want to 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.490
 to discover all that for proof in 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.680
 max cook prepares today a 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.330
 personal creation a bento 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.310
 Indian made from semolina and pis it's 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.440
 clearly original but which is anchored 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.229
 in the tradition it is a recipe of 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.330
 that I hold of my late grandparents 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:00.990
 my grandmother and you did 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.550
 a lot a lot when we were little 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.869
 became big our leader told himself 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.450
 that these Indian cuisines would 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:08.470
 amazing shots were far 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.270
 really try to take that to 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.590
 against the foot by working with 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.680
 market products and we wanted 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.330
 present Indian lego but 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.470
 reworked modernize sure that it does 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.019
 a much more digestible cuisine 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:23.519
 much lighter so we will do 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:25.900
 cook first in a little water backs 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:27.850
 opinions and dry hands like that was 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.130
 quickly to add serious matter a 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:32.140
 so light food but also full of 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:34.090
 ginger flavors mix of peace 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.620
 body yondre that there it starts to feel 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.390
 very good already 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.610
 remains to prepare and fry the 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.390
 dumplings of the antique here is the bento 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.400
 can be trained 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.140
 I really like having several small 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.970
 things in my month dish so next 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.769
 we add a cucumber salad 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.300
 today we did the Japanese 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:51.489
 so it's to bring the key a 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.920
 little different from the Indian whole we have 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:55.420
 put mirindi of achilles mustard and 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.459
 algae I think it's some 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.950
 pretty Asian thing enough enough 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:01.989
 modern also the result is there it's 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.630
 appetizing and here are fed the body 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:05.160
 and the imagination 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.170
 all natives and we will do the road so much 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:10.320
 that Indian yes he hesitates and that's not it 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.370
 which we miss at all and mathias is 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.950
 not the only one to have 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:16.410
 here is the marcel not French before you 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.940
 revamp interior design nothing do you 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.220
 suggest that this is yours 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.630
 we offer the world to my kitchen 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.860
 Indian everyone loves to move 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.590
 but often it's hard to go because 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.819
 than 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.709
 because it's a bit too 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:27.640
 kitsch good suddenly we live really make 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:29.260
 something much simpler 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.340
 compound mashed potatoes and we've got it 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.830
 give that side like that 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.720
 cocktail bar and atmospheric bars and 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.220
 and above all, here is the power to eat 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.870
 cheese born chicken engines in 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.810
 where you do not expect it from 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.700
 any successful bet the space and chic and 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.629
 cozy with its large bay window 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.610
 ceiling height 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:47.980
 here all the branches and the floor 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:49.720
 on the wall then there actually what we 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.190
 can find here on the wall if we are not 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.390
 not our wood who gave me that gives 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.430
 necessarily a little heat to 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:56.440
 places them there that are on the walls 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.940
 but actually replicates the 1930s 1930s 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.170
 and that just gives one more 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.840
 plus a rather felted light 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:03.370
 if the decor changes for your haliotika 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.810
 or your tandoori chicken 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.239
 this is also the case with your state 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:09.519
 of mind I think the change of 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:12.819
 frame I completely change the ratio 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:15.129
 in the kitchen that goes out the Indian cuisine 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:16.750
 from a purely ethnic cuisine to a 

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:19.419
 kitchen that you can eat 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:21.010
 regularly and this is the case this noon it 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:24.630
 there is crowd but for more privacy 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:24.630
 direction of the back of the restaurant 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:29.389
 here it is here we really wanted to create 

00:04:27.259 --> 00:04:31.340
 a lot more place much more 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:33.800
 cozy much more comfortable chair 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.910
 leather dimmed light colors at 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.590
 burin must 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:38.180
 so there we are rather on lunches 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:39.800
 business or dinners at night a little 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.270
 in love and romantic 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:44.090
 so that's pretty popular people 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:45.680
 claim this room regularly but 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.849
 restaurants are not the only ones 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.770
 ride this trend 

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:50.840
 home chefs like the one at them 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:52.580
 also take advantage of this new breath 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:54.039
 today this passionate cook 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:56.090
 Indian will do some shopping 

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:57.830
 revisit the classics since 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:01.160
 accuses then today we will realize 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:02.509
 a cupcake alva way carrot is 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.310
 a dessert makes the lgv carrot 

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:05.419
 a traditional Indian dessert what 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:08.240
 I like in Indian cuisine it's 

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:10.280
 true it is this spice blend 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.680
 invent things too with 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:14.570
 new flavors and flavors he goes there 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.530
 to have in this club kate direction the 

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:16.940
 radius of spices 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:20.180
 there are dozens and tens 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:21.830
 are so scared no then no cooking 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.599
 Indian is not that complicated at the 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:25.069
 cardamom that will bring a taste a 

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:27.110
 sweet enough actually it's not a spice 

00:05:25.069 --> 00:05:29.570
 who is going to sting we add to the level of the 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:30.800
 cinnamon ginger ginger good 

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:32.960
 we may not be able to take some pounds 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.699
 it will not be necessary with ginger 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.060
 fresh this will bring a little bit of 

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:37.340
 piquancy 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:38.360
 not to mention the fat and a 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.969
 touch who is running 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.479
 we will take bindi 

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:42.830
 traditionally it's going to be more 

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:44.719
 religious women will wear a 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:46.419
 red dot in the middle of the forehead we 

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:50.750
 will put that just for the little touch 

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:51.699
 for its part then that's okay 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:54.530
 not be possible 

00:05:51.699 --> 00:05:57.889
 let's go for the cupcake way 

00:05:54.530 --> 00:06:00.860
 bollywood 2 that's it I think I know 

00:05:57.889 --> 00:06:05.330
 do not you see there we gather all our 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:09.050
 ingredients first step we break them 

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:11.930
 water mix the dough and carrots 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:12.349
 in ginger couple a hint of 

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:14.509
 cinnamon 

00:06:12.349 --> 00:06:16.340
 but what do you do with cardamom so there 

00:06:14.509 --> 00:06:16.849
 we bought dakar lady in the form of 

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:18.620
 capsules 

00:06:16.849 --> 00:06:21.250
 so we will recover the small seeds 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:21.250
 which is inside 

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:28.160
 and it's the seeds that will come 

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:28.960
 our flavored cupcake that tab 

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:31.520
 puts in appetite 

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:33.650
 it's a colorful kitchen that 

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:36.110
 is fragrant it's not a kitchen that 

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:39.139
 is bland it's a kitchen that has 

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:42.349
 character and character it takes 

00:06:39.139 --> 00:06:44.720
 to finish the recipe we go we go 

00:06:42.349 --> 00:06:47.360
