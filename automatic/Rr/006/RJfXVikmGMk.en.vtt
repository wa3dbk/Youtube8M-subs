00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
this comes with two of these little guys

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:28.370 
this comes with two of these little guys
here<00:00:24.769> because<00:00:25.769> in<00:00:26.099> two<00:00:26.359> trash<00:00:27.359> cans<00:00:27.689> right

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
here because in two trash cans right

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.160 
here because in two trash cans right
there<00:00:28.590> it<00:00:28.830> comes<00:00:29.070> with<00:00:29.189> those<00:00:29.340> and<00:00:30.050> then<00:00:31.050> it

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
there it comes with those and then it

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.459 
there it comes with those and then it
comes<00:00:31.349> with<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:31.619> truck<00:00:31.890> here<00:00:32.279> and<00:00:33.320> then<00:00:34.320> I

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
comes with the truck here and then I

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.920 
comes with the truck here and then I
guess<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.680> bigger<00:00:35.010> trash<00:00:35.340> can<00:00:35.640> here<00:00:36.030> which

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
guess the bigger trash can here which

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.360 
guess the bigger trash can here which
attaches<00:00:37.320> here<00:00:38.780> like<00:00:39.780> that<00:00:39.989> and<00:00:40.260> then<00:00:40.370> this

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
attaches here like that and then this

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.520 
attaches here like that and then this
handle<00:00:41.850> here<00:00:44.059> just<00:00:45.059> by<00:00:45.239> pushing<00:00:45.420> that<00:00:45.719> you<00:00:46.379> can

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
handle here just by pushing that you can

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.930 
handle here just by pushing that you can
dump<00:00:46.800> it<00:00:46.950> in<00:00:47.539> you<00:00:48.539> could<00:00:48.690> take<00:00:48.899> these<00:00:49.170> cans<00:00:49.530> to

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:49.940 
dump it in you could take these cans to

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:55.189 
dump it in you could take these cans to
put<00:00:50.940> them<00:00:51.030> in<00:00:51.149> here<00:00:51.480> or<00:00:51.629> whatever<00:00:51.989> here<00:00:54.199> okay
