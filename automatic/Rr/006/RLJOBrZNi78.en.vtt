did<00:00:12.019> you<00:00:12.110> know<00:00:12.259> that<00:00:12.469> the<00:00:12.559> average<00:00:12.740> toilet

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:13.400 
did you know that the average toilet

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.630 
did you know that the average toilet
uses<00:00:13.730> 1.6<00:00:14.570> gallons<00:00:14.929> of<00:00:15.259> water<00:00:15.469> per<00:00:15.740> flush<00:00:16.279> and

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:16.640 
uses 1.6 gallons of water per flush and

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.510 
uses 1.6 gallons of water per flush and
if<00:00:17.240> your<00:00:17.390> toilet<00:00:17.570> was<00:00:17.810> installed<00:00:18.199> before<00:00:18.520> 1994

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:19.520 
if your toilet was installed before 1994

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.819 
if your toilet was installed before 1994
it's<00:00:20.060> at<00:00:20.210> least<00:00:20.329> double<00:00:20.869> that<00:00:20.900> amount<00:00:21.050> now

00:00:21.819 --> 00:00:21.829 
it's at least double that amount now

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:23.939 
it's at least double that amount now
that's<00:00:22.070> a<00:00:22.310> lot<00:00:22.640> of<00:00:22.699> wasted<00:00:23.240> water

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:23.949 
that's a lot of wasted water

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:25.859 
that's a lot of wasted water
conscientious<00:00:24.949> renters<00:00:25.460> and<00:00:25.789> homeowners

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:25.869 
conscientious renters and homeowners

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:28.569 
conscientious renters and homeowners
like<00:00:26.869> you<00:00:27.050> and<00:00:27.230> I<00:00:27.320> are<00:00:27.829> looking<00:00:28.070> for<00:00:28.399> ways<00:00:28.520> to

00:00:28.569 --> 00:00:28.579 
like you and I are looking for ways to

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:31.600 
like you and I are looking for ways to
cut<00:00:29.000> costs<00:00:29.540> anywhere<00:00:30.230> and<00:00:30.559> what<00:00:31.309> better<00:00:31.489> place

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:31.610 
cut costs anywhere and what better place

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:36.040 
cut costs anywhere and what better place
to<00:00:31.820> start<00:00:32.059> than<00:00:32.390> with<00:00:33.050> your<00:00:33.379> toilet<00:00:34.899> so<00:00:35.899> how

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.050 
to start than with your toilet so how

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.440 
to start than with your toilet so how
does<00:00:36.110> a<00:00:36.230> toilet<00:00:36.649> work<00:00:36.850> inside<00:00:37.850> the<00:00:38.030> tank<00:00:38.270> there

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:38.450 
does a toilet work inside the tank there

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:40.510 
does a toilet work inside the tank there
is<00:00:38.480> a<00:00:38.570> float<00:00:38.870> that<00:00:39.020> rises<00:00:39.440> as<00:00:39.680> the<00:00:39.739> water<00:00:40.190> level

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:40.520 
is a float that rises as the water level

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.880 
is a float that rises as the water level
rises<00:00:40.910> this<00:00:41.629> float<00:00:41.930> signals<00:00:42.350> the<00:00:42.469> water<00:00:42.680> to

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 
rises this float signals the water to

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.310 
rises this float signals the water to
turn<00:00:43.010> on<00:00:43.249> fulfilling<00:00:43.640> and<00:00:44.120> to<00:00:44.600> turn<00:00:44.780> off<00:00:45.050> when

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.320 
turn on fulfilling and to turn off when

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.340 
turn on fulfilling and to turn off when
full<00:00:45.589> pretty<00:00:46.190> basic<00:00:46.399> right<00:00:46.820> so<00:00:47.749> the<00:00:48.050> theory

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 
full pretty basic right so the theory

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.040 
full pretty basic right so the theory
goes<00:00:48.499> that<00:00:48.530> placing<00:00:49.280> a<00:00:49.429> weighted<00:00:49.969> item<00:00:50.329> inside

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
goes that placing a weighted item inside

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.009 
goes that placing a weighted item inside
of<00:00:51.199> the<00:00:51.289> tank<00:00:51.550> shuts<00:00:52.550> off<00:00:52.819> the<00:00:53.390> water<00:00:53.690> fill

00:00:54.009 --> 00:00:54.019 
of the tank shuts off the water fill

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:56.799 
of the tank shuts off the water fill
prematurely<00:00:54.649> that<00:00:55.579> means<00:00:55.850> when<00:00:56.269> you<00:00:56.600> flush

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:56.809 
prematurely that means when you flush

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:58.989 
prematurely that means when you flush
every<00:00:57.170> time<00:00:57.379> that<00:00:57.800> less<00:00:58.219> water<00:00:58.489> goes<00:00:58.699> into<00:00:58.909> the

00:00:58.989 --> 00:00:58.999 
every time that less water goes into the

00:00:58.999 --> 00:01:01.329 
every time that less water goes into the
bowl<00:00:59.149> from<00:00:59.749> the<00:00:59.899> tank<00:01:00.109> therefore<00:01:00.769> saving<00:01:01.100> you

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:01.339 
bowl from the tank therefore saving you

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:04.119 
bowl from the tank therefore saving you
water<00:01:01.609> and<00:01:02.239> money<00:01:02.559> while<00:01:03.559> the<00:01:03.679> premise<00:01:03.889> is

spot-on the logistics are not so much a

spot-on the logistics are not so much a

eventually crumble off and start to
