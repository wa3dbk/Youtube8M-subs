00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
pressuring them 9 out of 10 times they

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.190 
pressuring them 9 out of 10 times they
stick<00:01:47.759> to<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.000> bottom<00:01:48.149> of<00:01:48.390> your<00:01:48.540> pan<00:01:48.780> and<00:01:48.810> burn

stick to the bottom of your pan and burn

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.850 
stick to the bottom of your pan and burn
so<00:01:49.979> it's<00:01:50.340> very<00:01:50.549> important<00:01:51.509> that<00:01:51.780> you<00:01:52.170> always

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
so it's very important that you always

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.800 
so it's very important that you always
have<00:01:53.130> a<00:01:53.430> lot<00:01:53.880> of<00:01:53.909> water<00:01:54.210> in<00:01:54.390> your<00:01:54.509> pressure

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
have a lot of water in your pressure

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.130 
have a lot of water in your pressure
cooker<00:01:54.930> before<00:01:55.680> you<00:01:56.070> even<00:01:56.399> put<00:01:56.640> your<00:01:56.750> spoon<00:01:57.750> in

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
cooker before you even put your spoon in

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.899 
cooker before you even put your spoon in
the<00:01:58.560> pressure<00:01:58.770> cooker<00:01:58.890> you<00:01:59.280> will<00:01:59.430> be<00:01:59.549> able<00:01:59.729> to

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
the pressure cooker you will be able to

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.940 
the pressure cooker you will be able to
tell<00:02:00.090> if<00:02:00.240> your<00:02:00.360> by<00:02:00.570> are<00:02:00.750> done<00:02:00.930> or<00:02:01.079> not<00:02:01.110> and<00:02:01.409> the

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
tell if your by are done or not and the

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.910 
tell if your by are done or not and the
way<00:02:02.070> to<00:02:02.130> see<00:02:02.399> this<00:02:02.549> is<00:02:02.850> that<00:02:03.140> the<00:02:04.140> curry<00:02:04.469> is<00:02:04.860> a

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
way to see this is that the curry is a

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.210 
way to see this is that the curry is a
milky<00:02:05.520> color<00:02:05.759> so<00:02:06.420> stir<00:02:07.110> it<00:02:07.290> thoroughly<00:02:07.740> and

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
milky color so stir it thoroughly and

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.339 
milky color so stir it thoroughly and
we're<00:02:08.970> going<00:02:09.149> to<00:02:09.209> cook<00:02:09.360> this<00:02:09.509> on<00:02:09.660> a<00:02:09.720> high<00:02:09.929> heat

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
we're going to cook this on a high heat

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.729 
we're going to cook this on a high heat
and<00:02:10.469> dry<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:10.979> water<00:02:11.219> out<00:02:11.519> as<00:02:11.730> much<00:02:11.909> as<00:02:12.090> we<00:02:12.120> can

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:12.739 
and dry the water out as much as we can

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:15.739 
and dry the water out as much as we can
so<00:02:13.739> we<00:02:13.769> want<00:02:14.010> to<00:02:14.129> cook<00:02:14.280> it<00:02:14.459> until<00:02:14.670> the<00:02:15.480> curry

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:15.749 
so we want to cook it until the curry

00:02:15.749 --> 00:02:17.929 
so we want to cook it until the curry
becomes<00:02:16.170> a<00:02:16.260> little<00:02:16.469> bit<00:02:16.650> darker<00:02:17.099> so<00:02:17.280> once<00:02:17.819> you

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:17.939 
becomes a little bit darker so once you

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:19.970 
becomes a little bit darker so once you
stop<00:02:18.150> noticing<00:02:18.689> that<00:02:18.959> the<00:02:19.200> curry<00:02:19.439> is<00:02:19.620> a<00:02:19.650> little

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
stop noticing that the curry is a little

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.860 
stop noticing that the curry is a little
bit<00:02:20.099> thicker<00:02:20.340> and<00:02:20.489> a<00:02:20.790> little<00:02:21.030> bit<00:02:21.180> darker<00:02:21.389> add

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870
