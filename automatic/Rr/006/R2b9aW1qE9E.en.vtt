lot of violence goes on here there's a

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.259 
lot of violence goes on here there's a
lot<00:00:22.859> of<00:00:22.980> explaining<00:00:23.460> it<00:00:23.550> needs<00:00:23.730> to<00:00:23.820> go<00:00:23.939> on<00:00:23.970> but

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
lot of explaining it needs to go on but

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.269 
lot of explaining it needs to go on but
this<00:00:24.600> is<00:00:24.660> what<00:00:24.869> it<00:00:24.930> looks<00:00:25.080> like<00:00:25.140> this<00:00:25.949> is<00:00:26.099> what

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
this is what it looks like this is what

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:27.650 
this is what it looks like this is what
the<00:00:26.369> difference<00:00:26.490> between<00:00:26.730> let's<00:00:27.210> say<00:00:27.300> a

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
the difference between let's say a

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.890 
the difference between let's say a
somebody<00:00:28.590> making<00:00:28.769> a<00:00:28.859> little<00:00:29.010> three-wheel

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:29.900 
somebody making a little three-wheel

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.359 
somebody making a little three-wheel
imaginary<00:00:30.900> car<00:00:31.170> that<00:00:31.349> would<00:00:31.800> never<00:00:32.009> be<00:00:32.099> safe

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
imaginary car that would never be safe

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.080 
imaginary car that would never be safe
on<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.579> highway<00:00:33.170> so<00:00:34.399> this<00:00:35.399> is<00:00:35.520> our<00:00:35.640> very<00:00:35.790> first

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
on the highway so this is our very first

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.720 
on the highway so this is our very first
video<00:00:36.210> to<00:00:36.420> a<00:00:36.600> very<00:00:37.380> first<00:00:37.559> high-speed<00:00:38.129> crash

video to a very first high-speed crash
30<00:00:39.090> miles<00:00:39.239> an<00:00:39.329> hour<00:00:39.420> a<00:00:39.480> new<00:00:39.570> concrete<00:00:39.780> wall<00:00:40.140> and

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
30 miles an hour a new concrete wall and

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.110 
30 miles an hour a new concrete wall and
what<00:00:41.160> we<00:00:41.250> cared<00:00:41.460> about<00:00:41.520> of<00:00:41.760> course<00:00:41.969> was<00:00:42.090> that

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
what we cared about of course was that

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.600 
what we cared about of course was that
the<00:00:42.239> airbag<00:00:42.540> opened<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.770> g-forces<00:00:44.280> on<00:00:44.520> the

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
the airbag opened the g-forces on the

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.110 
the airbag opened the g-forces on the
driver<00:00:44.879> were<00:00:45.360> what<00:00:45.629> we<00:00:45.719> expected<00:00:46.460> the<00:00:47.460> crumple

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
driver were what we expected the crumple

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.760 
driver were what we expected the crumple
zones<00:00:48.300> worked<00:00:48.539> as<00:00:48.690> expected<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:49.289> door<00:00:49.500> still

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
zones worked as expected the door still

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.920 
zones worked as expected the door still
opened<00:00:50.039> after<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.370> crash<00:00:50.610> but<00:00:51.539> on<00:00:51.629> this<00:00:51.719> one

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
opened after the crash but on this one

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.869 
opened after the crash but on this one
actually<00:00:52.260> what<00:00:52.379> was<00:00:52.469> more<00:00:52.649> interesting<00:00:53.129> was

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
actually what was more interesting was

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.790 
actually what was more interesting was
that<00:00:53.910> when<00:00:54.360> we<00:00:54.809> analyzed<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.260> videos<00:00:55.530> of<00:00:55.680> this

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
that when we analyzed the videos of this

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.170 
that when we analyzed the videos of this
thing<00:00:55.949> taken<00:00:56.250> from<00:00:56.399> all<00:00:56.579> sides<00:00:56.820> here<00:00:57.030> it<00:00:57.059> is

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
thing taken from all sides here it is

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.720 
thing taken from all sides here it is
again<00:00:57.390> from<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.600> top<00:00:58.160> the<00:00:59.160> car<00:00:59.370> behaved

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
again from the top the car behaved

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.660 
again from the top the car behaved
exactly<00:00:59.910> as<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.359> computer<00:01:00.750> models<00:01:00.989> predicted

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
exactly as the computer models predicted

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.860 
exactly as the computer models predicted
the<00:01:02.670> back<00:01:02.850> looks<00:01:03.059> funny<00:01:03.270> here<00:01:03.510> you<00:01:03.600> see<00:01:03.750> is<00:01:03.809> a

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
the energy of this crash is a lot more

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:07.790 
the energy of this crash is a lot more
than<00:03:06.780> the<00:03:06.870> 30<00:03:07.080> mile<00:03:07.230> an<00:03:07.320> hour<00:03:07.380> crash<00:03:07.620> as<00:03:07.740> you

saw before

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.210

this<00:03:08.760> is<00:03:09.560> microseconds<00:03:10.560> before<00:03:10.830> that<00:03:10.950> trucks

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
this is microseconds before that trucks

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.590 
this is microseconds before that trucks
can<00:03:11.370> hit<00:03:11.550> the<00:03:11.670> car<00:03:11.850> all<00:03:12.120> right<00:03:12.270> you<00:03:12.330> guys<00:03:12.450> want

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
can hit the car all right you guys want

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.800 
can hit the car all right you guys want
C<00:03:12.750> go<00:03:12.900> here<00:03:13.830> we<00:03:13.890> go<00:03:15.560> that<00:03:16.560> truck<00:03:16.800> eats<00:03:17.010> the<00:03:17.190> car

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
C go here we go that truck eats the car

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.990 
C go here we go that truck eats the car
yeah<00:03:18.810> it's<00:03:19.500> a<00:03:19.620> lot<00:03:19.770> of<00:03:19.920> energy<00:03:20.220> there<00:03:20.370> that<00:03:20.820> the

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
yeah it's a lot of energy there that the

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.330 
yeah it's a lot of energy there that the
passenger<00:03:21.390> cell<00:03:21.570> remains<00:03:21.900> intact<00:03:22.290> which<00:03:23.190> is

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
passenger cell remains intact which is

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:24.800 
passenger cell remains intact which is
actually<00:03:23.610> not<00:03:23.700> strangely<00:03:24.180> a<00:03:24.240> requirement<00:03:24.750> of

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
actually not strangely a requirement of

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.210 
actually not strangely a requirement of
this<00:03:24.930> test<00:03:25.200> the<00:03:25.740> truck<00:03:25.950> is<00:03:26.100> completely

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
this test the truck is completely

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.690 
this test the truck is completely
airborne<00:03:26.910> bearing<00:03:27.270> down<00:03:27.390> on<00:03:27.450> this<00:03:27.630> little<00:03:27.750> car

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
airborne bearing down on this little car

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.430 
airborne bearing down on this little car
and<00:03:29.700> here's<00:03:30.360> the<00:03:30.480> thing<00:03:30.630> you<00:03:30.900> turn<00:03:31.230> it<00:03:31.320> over

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
and here's the thing you turn it over

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.070 
and here's the thing you turn it over
and<00:03:31.770> no<00:03:32.120> dangerous<00:03:33.120> liquids<00:03:33.480> leaked<00:03:33.630> out<00:03:33.780> but

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
and no dangerous liquids leaked out but

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.230 
and no dangerous liquids leaked out but
here's<00:03:34.230> the<00:03:34.380> key<00:03:34.530> here's<00:03:34.680> the<00:03:34.800> killer<00:03:35.250> the

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:36.240 
here's the key here's the killer the

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.810 
here's the key here's the killer the
battery<00:03:36.540> pack<00:03:37.070> remained<00:03:38.070> intact<00:03:38.370> we<00:03:38.610> broke

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
battery pack remained intact we broke

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.700 
battery pack remained intact we broke
the<00:03:38.910> transmission<00:03:39.090> in<00:03:39.480> half<00:03:39.660> we<00:03:40.380> smashed

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:40.710 
the transmission in half we smashed

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:41.990 
the transmission in half we smashed
everything<00:03:41.010> in<00:03:41.160> the<00:03:41.220> back<00:03:41.340> of<00:03:41.460> the<00:03:41.520> car<00:03:41.700> and

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
everything in the back of the car and

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.880 
everything in the back of the car and
the<00:03:42.330> battery<00:03:42.540> system<00:03:42.690> was<00:03:42.960> was<00:03:43.200> intact<00:03:43.710> no

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
the battery system was was intact no

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.040 
the battery system was was intact no
dangerous<00:03:44.280> voltages<00:03:44.700> on<00:03:44.850> the<00:03:44.910> car<00:03:45.120> driver<00:03:45.750> and

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:46.050 
dangerous voltages on the car driver and

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:47.380 
dangerous voltages on the car driver and
passenger<00:03:46.380> would<00:03:46.470> have<00:03:46.590> survived

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.390 
passenger would have survived

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.290 
passenger would have survived
so<00:03:48.390> I<00:03:49.070> guess<00:03:50.070> my<00:03:50.220> comment<00:03:50.460> does<00:03:50.760> the<00:03:51.000> car

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:51.300 
so I guess my comment does the car

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:52.610 
so I guess my comment does the car
crashes<00:03:51.690> frontal<00:03:52.020> it<00:03:52.110> fundamentally

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
crashes frontal it fundamentally

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.180 
crashes frontal it fundamentally
different<00:03:52.860> than<00:03:52.920> the<00:03:53.040> Saab<00:03:53.220> for<00:03:53.400> a<00:03:53.460> crash

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.190 
different than the Saab for a crash

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.520 
different than the Saab for a crash
thank<00:03:56.190> you<00:03:56.250> very<00:03:56.370> much
