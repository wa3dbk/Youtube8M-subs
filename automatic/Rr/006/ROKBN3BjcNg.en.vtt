00:00:09.619 --> 00:00:12.889
 Welcome to the planet Pandora 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:15.900
 risk your life and you will become an alien 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.900
 to know the points 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:23.989
 to see if this is much more in avatar 

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:26.970
 the videogame 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.970
 ourense attachments 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.830
 the video game as a visitor from new york 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:42.830
 we can choose between the two sexes a man or a woman 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.990
 we can modify the appearance of the protagonist with a total of ten 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:48.330
 different countries 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.710
 for both sexes 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.320
 the campaign is divided into two different stories when we control our 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.870
 human character when we play with the avatar character 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.880
 the injuries we can meet in the order we want 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:05.520
 also when you want you can move from one point to another in the 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.560
 pandora planet 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.380
 we will advance little by little gaining experience that we have in combats and in 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:12.700
 missions 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.190
 On the way we will find different vehicles that we can choose 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.810
 like a boat a spark plug a helicopter 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.450
 the hoteliers different visions like salvage rescue and protection or a 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.390
 attack the injuries follow a very common pattern that is to say that over time you 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.390
 may seem repetitive 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.740
 of the best that there is and is the exploration of Pandora's world, 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.450
 has the pandora asked for something like a database with deep 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.930
 universe created by james cameron 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:47.580
 if something catches our attention like a plant an animal we can change it with 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.420
 an analyzed device 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.299
 and so little by little we will unlock the encyclopedia 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:55.299
 of the great universe of 'avatar' 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.840
 as graphics will depend a lot on the kind of equipment what we are not 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.630
 Playing 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.899
 since in its version for xbox 360 and playstation 3 has the opportunity 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:10.720
 to see the graphics in third dimension these 3d graphics are the 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.980
 You can see if you have a TV specifically prepared for third 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:15.979
 dimension 

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:18.439
 this is the most important and relevant part of the game 

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:22.030
 you have to play in third dimension is truly spectacular 

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:27.239
 this same 3d technology was used in the movie and maybe it starts to mark the 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:29.019
 future of videogames 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:32.449
 since due to all movements are made to make the 

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:35.699
 player that something comes out of the screen 

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:39.529
 but this technology is still at a very early age in both television 

00:02:39.529 --> 00:02:42.529
 stereoscopic and 3d support 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:48.629
 and also something good is that the original version of videogames and comics very 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:52.389
 soon and if any of them is of health I stopped home all are from 

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:55.389
 new roles that already starred in the film 

00:02:56.699 --> 00:03:00.109
 We believe that this title will truly adjust to the new fans of the 

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:01.029
 movie 

00:03:01.029 --> 00:03:04.889
 the rest of us have a very nice time with the lakers in 3d and 

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:07.989
 discovering the whole universe of 'avatar' 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:11.150
 for more information on your favorite video games are still connected 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:12.840
