00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
that up as well keeping them off the

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.140 
that up as well keeping them off the
free-throw<00:00:57.590> line<00:00:57.710> that<00:00:58.070> was<00:00:58.220> big<00:00:58.460> for<00:00:58.640> us<00:00:58.700> I

00:00:59.140 --> 00:00:59.150 
free-throw line that was big for us I

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:01.120 
free-throw line that was big for us I
mean<00:00:59.420> this<00:00:59.660> dish<00:00:59.930> I<00:01:00.110> didn't<00:01:00.530> percent<00:01:00.830> but<00:01:01.010> it

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:01.130 
mean this dish I didn't percent but it

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:03.550 
mean this dish I didn't percent but it
got<00:01:01.250> only<00:01:01.460> 12<00:01:01.790> freedoms<00:01:02.180> how<00:01:02.990> much<00:01:03.170> was<00:01:03.350> I

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:03.560 
got only 12 freedoms how much was I

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.530 
got only 12 freedoms how much was I
guess<00:01:03.950> how<00:01:04.100> much<00:01:04.250> of<00:01:04.970> handling<00:01:05.390> those

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
guess how much of handling those

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.330 
guess how much of handling those
momentum<00:01:06.020> swings<00:01:06.290> was<00:01:06.530> coach<00:01:06.860> working<00:01:07.250> you

momentum swings was coach working you

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:08.830 
momentum swings was coach working you
through<00:01:07.580> it<00:01:07.700> how<00:01:07.820> much<00:01:07.970> it<00:01:08.180> was<00:01:08.300> you<00:01:08.450> guys<00:01:08.600> work

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
through it how much it was you guys work

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.780 
through it how much it was you guys work
with<00:01:08.990> each<00:01:09.080> other<00:01:09.290> through<00:01:09.560> all<00:01:10.400> those<00:01:10.550> runs

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 
we gotta take momentum just like going

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:27.760 
we gotta take momentum just like going
into<00:01:26.360> halftime<00:01:26.600> taking<00:01:27.229> the<00:01:27.290> momentum<00:01:27.619> by<00:01:27.710> the
