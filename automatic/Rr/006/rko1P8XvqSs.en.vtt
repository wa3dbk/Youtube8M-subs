do<00:02:05.189> that<00:02:05.310> eventually<00:02:05.520> when<00:02:05.939> I'm<00:02:06.030> done<00:02:06.210> filling

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
do that eventually when I'm done filling

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.900 
do that eventually when I'm done filling
around<00:02:07.320> do<00:02:07.560> three<00:02:07.890> we<00:02:08.489> also<00:02:08.610> don't<00:02:08.789> have<00:02:08.819> to

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
around do three we also don't have to

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.809 
around do three we also don't have to
worry<00:02:09.000> about<00:02:09.209> the<00:02:09.420> shitty<00:02:09.690> new<00:02:09.899> graphics

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
worry about the shitty new graphics

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.729 
worry about the shitty new graphics
like<00:02:12.819> the<00:02:13.120> the<00:02:13.689> pill<00:02:13.930> on<00:02:14.200> the<00:02:14.230> healthkit

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:14.739 
like the the pill on the healthkit

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:16.759 
like the the pill on the healthkit
that's<00:02:15.189> nice

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:16.769 
that's nice

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:18.959 
that's nice

another map see try map for got the

another map see try map for got the
focus<00:02:38.319> music<00:02:38.709> but<00:02:39.010> you<00:02:39.159> know<00:02:39.280> like<00:02:39.609> I<00:02:39.700> said

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
focus music but you know like I said

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.339 
focus music but you know like I said
before<00:02:39.909> you<00:02:40.239> can<00:02:40.359> just<00:02:40.510> change<00:02:40.810> that<00:02:41.079> with<00:02:41.319> a

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:41.349 
before you can just change that with a

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:45.330 
before you can just change that with a
map<00:02:41.590> info<00:02:43.409> the<00:02:44.409> focus<00:02:44.799> it<00:02:44.950> also<00:02:45.069> doesn't

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
map info the focus it also doesn't

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.759 
map info the focus it also doesn't
change<00:02:45.639> the<00:02:45.790> level<00:02:46.090> names<00:02:46.269> but<00:02:46.629> again<00:02:47.079> change

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769 
change the level names but again change

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:49.379 
change the level names but again change
that<00:02:47.919> with<00:02:48.040> map<00:02:48.189> info<00:02:48.519> it's<00:02:48.700> not<00:02:48.849> really<00:02:49.120> a<00:02:49.150> big

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:49.389 
that with map info it's not really a big

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:51.780 
that with map info it's not really a big
deal<00:02:49.439> you're<00:02:50.439> getting<00:02:50.709> the<00:02:50.769> maps<00:02:51.040> and<00:02:51.400> that's

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
deal you're getting the maps and that's

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.280 
deal you're getting the maps and that's
really<00:02:52.359> all<00:02:52.480> that<00:02:52.510> matters

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
really all that matters

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.610 
really all that matters
you<00:02:53.709> can<00:02:53.829> also<00:02:53.980> look<00:02:54.310> up<00:02:54.489> and<00:02:54.669> down<00:02:55.290> use<00:02:56.290> you

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
you can also look up and down use you

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:03.209 
you can also look up and down use you
know<00:02:56.769> crouch-jump<00:03:01.620> these<00:03:02.620> maps<00:03:02.829> are<00:03:02.980> actually

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:03.219 
know crouch-jump these maps are actually

00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:04.409 
know crouch-jump these maps are actually
pretty<00:03:03.370> tough<00:03:03.609> but<00:03:03.790> least<00:03:03.939> they<00:03:04.060> were<00:03:04.180> when<00:03:04.359> I

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:04.419 
pretty tough but least they were when I

00:03:04.419 --> 00:03:05.729 
pretty tough but least they were when I
was<00:03:04.449> using<00:03:04.900> with<00:03:05.139> an<00:03:05.230> Xbox<00:03:05.439> controller

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
was using with an Xbox controller

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:07.949 
was using with an Xbox controller
because<00:03:06.430> you<00:03:06.639> know<00:03:06.730> you<00:03:07.480> had<00:03:07.599> the<00:03:07.689> plate<00:03:07.870> on

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
because you know you had the plate on

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:14.459 
because you know you had the plate on
the<00:03:08.049> 360<00:03:08.349> for<00:03:11.099> but<00:03:12.150> grab<00:03:13.150> some<00:03:13.299> health<00:03:13.510> fucking

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:14.469 
the 360 for but grab some health fucking

00:03:14.469 --> 00:03:18.839 
the 360 for but grab some health fucking
jumping<00:03:14.829> over<00:03:15.040> it<00:03:17.099> but<00:03:18.099> it<00:03:18.280> pretty<00:03:18.430> much<00:03:18.519> works

00:03:18.839 --> 00:03:18.849 
jumping over it but it pretty much works

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:22.170 
jumping over it but it pretty much works
fine<00:03:19.120> let's<00:03:19.629> try<00:03:19.840> another<00:03:20.019> map<00:03:20.259> out<00:03:20.500> I<00:03:21.180> just

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
fine let's try another map out I just

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.240 
fine let's try another map out I just
almost<00:03:22.810> got<00:03:23.139> killed<00:03:23.349> I<00:03:23.560> didn't<00:03:23.949> get<00:03:24.040> killed

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
almost got killed I didn't get killed

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:30.699 
almost got killed I didn't get killed
that's<00:03:24.430> nice<00:03:24.930> let's<00:03:25.930> try<00:03:26.079> map<00:03:26.319> seven

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:33.289 

joins<00:03:31.709> us<00:03:31.860> dead<00:03:32.129> simple<00:03:32.489> of<00:03:32.640> course<00:03:32.670> yep

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
joins us dead simple of course yep

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:39.190 
joins us dead simple of course yep
uh<00:03:33.920> this<00:03:34.920> is<00:03:35.099> barons<00:03:35.549> banquet<00:03:36.120> I<00:03:36.239> believe

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.420 

again<00:03:40.200> I'm<00:03:40.439> probably<00:03:40.620> just<00:03:40.980> going<00:03:41.069> to<00:03:41.159> make<00:03:41.280> my

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
again I'm probably just going to make my

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.099 
again I'm probably just going to make my
own<00:03:41.459> map<00:03:41.790> info<00:03:42.180> you<00:03:42.420> can<00:03:42.450> probably<00:03:42.689> find<00:03:42.959> one

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:43.109 
own map info you can probably find one

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:46.580 
own map info you can probably find one
online<00:03:43.409> eventually<00:03:44.069> I<00:03:44.969> might<00:03:45.720> put<00:03:45.930> it<00:03:46.049> up<00:03:46.260> for

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
online eventually I might put it up for

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.250 
online eventually I might put it up for
download<00:03:46.769> if<00:03:47.069> anyone<00:03:47.400> wants<00:03:47.670> a<00:03:47.760> bit<00:03:47.909> like

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
download if anyone wants a bit like

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.390 
download if anyone wants a bit like
relatively<00:03:49.260> guarantee<00:03:49.829> that<00:03:49.980> no<00:03:50.099> one<00:03:50.250> will

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
relatively guarantee that no one will

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.250 
relatively guarantee that no one will
need<00:03:51.390> it<00:03:51.540> because<00:03:51.780> it's<00:03:51.900> not<00:03:51.989> really

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
need it because it's not really

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:53.780 
need it because it's not really
important<00:03:52.590> it's<00:03:52.739> just<00:03:52.799> aesthetic<00:03:53.310> changes

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
important it's just aesthetic changes

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:59.179 
important it's just aesthetic changes
and<00:03:54.720> I<00:03:54.900> guess<00:03:55.049> music<00:03:55.409> changes<00:03:57.739> but<00:03:58.739> you<00:03:58.950> get

00:03:59.179 --> 00:03:59.189 
and I guess music changes but you get

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:01.220 
and I guess music changes but you get
what<00:03:59.700> you<00:03:59.969> really<00:04:00.180> want<00:04:00.510> which<00:04:00.750> is<00:04:00.870> the<00:04:00.989> maps

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
what you really want which is the maps

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:08.640 
what you really want which is the maps
so<00:04:01.620> that's<00:04:01.739> cool

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.740
