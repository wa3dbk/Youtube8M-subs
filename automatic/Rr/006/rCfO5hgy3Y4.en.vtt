00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:04.850 
and now we're going to do the dot inlays

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:11.470 
and now we're going to do the dot inlays
on<00:00:05.299> the<00:00:05.390> fingerboard<00:00:09.339> now<00:00:10.339> I'm<00:00:10.490> using<00:00:10.670> a<00:00:10.969> sort

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:11.480 
on the fingerboard now I'm using a sort

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.280 
on the fingerboard now I'm using a sort
of<00:00:11.540> a<00:00:12.280> abalone<00:00:13.280> sort<00:00:13.669> of<00:00:13.759> dot

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:15.290 
of a abalone sort of dot

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:17.320 
of a abalone sort of dot
of<00:00:15.740> course<00:00:15.980> you<00:00:16.100> can<00:00:16.250> use<00:00:16.400> like<00:00:16.610> a<00:00:16.640> traditional

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:32.510 
painters tape and I'm going to just mark

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:35.590 
painters tape and I'm going to just mark
the<00:00:33.170> fret<00:00:33.500> areas<00:00:34.010> where<00:00:34.520> I<00:00:34.550> want<00:00:34.879> the<00:00:35.030> dots<00:00:35.300> to

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:35.600 
the fret areas where I want the dots to

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.430 
the fret areas where I want the dots to
be<00:00:36.460> which<00:00:37.460> I'm<00:00:37.610> just<00:00:37.640> doing<00:00:38.090> the<00:00:38.210> traditional

going<00:00:50.150> to<00:00:50.269> put<00:00:50.420> two<00:00:50.659> dots<00:00:50.839> on<00:00:51.229> that<00:00:51.320> one<00:00:52.190> so

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:52.339 
going to put two dots on that one so

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:54.040 
going to put two dots on that one so
basically<00:00:52.460> market<00:00:53.059> with<00:00:53.150> two<00:00:53.330> pieces<00:00:53.540> of<00:00:53.750> tape

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
basically market with two pieces of tape

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.380 
basically market with two pieces of tape
just<00:00:54.110> to<00:00:54.530> give<00:00:55.309> me<00:00:55.460> a<00:00:55.489> reminder<00:00:56.089> that<00:00:56.120> that's

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
just to give me a reminder that that's

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.219 
just to give me a reminder that that's
where<00:00:56.690> I<00:00:56.720> double<00:00:57.199> up<00:00:58.629> then<00:00:59.629> I'll<00:00:59.750> go<00:00:59.780> again

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:00.229 
where I double up then I'll go again

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:12.609 
where I double up then I'll go again
with<00:01:00.440> the<00:01:00.680> 15th<00:01:01.370> 17th<00:01:04.990> and<00:01:05.990> the<00:01:06.970> 19th

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
and the length of the board that I have

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.399 
and the length of the board that I have
allows<00:01:16.189> me<00:01:16.429> to<00:01:16.520> do<00:01:16.700> a<00:01:16.729> twenty<00:01:17.630> first<00:01:17.869> fret<00:01:18.200> dot

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:18.409 
allows me to do a twenty first fret dot

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:24.580 
allows me to do a twenty first fret dot
as<00:01:18.590> well<00:01:22.960> okay<00:01:23.960> and<00:01:24.109> then<00:01:24.200> we've<00:01:24.350> got<00:01:24.530> our

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
as well okay and then we've got our

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.580 
as well okay and then we've got our
center<00:01:25.069> line<00:01:25.280> and<00:01:26.170> we're<00:01:27.170> going<00:01:27.319> to<00:01:27.380> draw<00:01:27.560> some

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
center line and we're going to draw some

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.919 
center line and we're going to draw some
diagonals<00:01:28.429> in<00:01:28.610> these<00:01:28.789> areas<00:01:29.209> just<00:01:29.450> to<00:01:29.569> get<00:01:29.810> the

00:01:29.919 --> 00:01:29.929 
diagonals in these areas just to get the

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:32.410 
diagonals in these areas just to get the
exact<00:01:30.319> center<00:01:30.740> both<00:01:31.340> vertically<00:01:32.299> and

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
exact center both vertically and

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:39.370 
exact center both vertically and
horizontally<00:01:37.119> if<00:01:38.119> you<00:01:38.209> draw<00:01:38.420> two<00:01:38.659> diagonals

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
horizontally if you draw two diagonals

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.990 
horizontally if you draw two diagonals
in<00:01:39.619> a<00:01:40.539> rectangle<00:01:41.539> like<00:01:41.569> this<00:01:42.609> the<00:01:43.609> point<00:01:43.789> they

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
in a rectangle like this the point they

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.669 
in a rectangle like this the point they
cross<00:01:44.329> should<00:01:44.689> be<00:01:44.780> the<00:01:44.929> center<00:01:45.229> point<00:01:45.500> of<00:01:45.619> that

00:01:45.669 --> 00:01:45.679 
cross should be the center point of that

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:48.550 
cross should be the center point of that
rectangle<00:01:46.039> and<00:01:46.959> notice<00:01:47.959> how<00:01:48.110> that<00:01:48.140> cross

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
rectangle and notice how that cross

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.319 
rectangle and notice how that cross
lands<00:01:49.039> on<00:01:49.159> our<00:01:49.250> center<00:01:49.640> line<00:01:49.819> that<00:01:49.849> we<00:01:50.149> have

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:50.329 
lands on our center line that we have

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:55.209 
lands on our center line that we have
drawn<00:01:50.569> down<00:01:50.810> the<00:01:50.989> neck<00:01:53.530> so<00:01:54.530> I've<00:01:54.649> got<00:01:54.860> one

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:55.219 
drawn down the neck so I've got one

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:58.389 
drawn down the neck so I've got one
ahead<00:01:55.459> and<00:01:55.700> I<00:01:55.789> mark<00:01:56.539> those<00:01:56.810> frets<00:01:57.250> notice<00:01:58.250> on

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:58.399 
ahead and I mark those frets notice on

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:00.789 
ahead and I mark those frets notice on
the<00:01:58.489> 12th<00:01:58.849> where<00:01:59.030> I<00:01:59.060> did<00:01:59.299> the<00:01:59.450> double<00:01:59.840> I<00:02:00.020> just

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799 
the 12th where I did the double I just

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:02.859 
the 12th where I did the double I just
split<00:02:00.979> it<00:02:01.219> into<00:02:01.369> two<00:02:01.640> small<00:02:01.969> rectangles<00:02:02.659> and

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
split it into two small rectangles and

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:10.619 
split it into two small rectangles and
divided<00:02:03.860> those<00:02:04.009> equally<00:02:08.860> now<00:02:09.860> if<00:02:10.099> you're

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:10.629 
divided those equally now if you're

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:13.479 
divided those equally now if you're
careful<00:02:11.629> about<00:02:11.900> the<00:02:12.260> dots<00:02:12.620> that<00:02:12.860> you<00:02:13.010> select

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489 
careful about the dots that you select

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:17.740 
careful about the dots that you select
you<00:02:14.360> can<00:02:14.540> get<00:02:14.720> a<00:02:14.750> size<00:02:15.079> dot<00:02:15.590> that<00:02:16.459> is<00:02:16.510> the<00:02:17.510> same

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
you can get a size dot that is the same

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.590 
you can get a size dot that is the same
size<00:02:17.989> as<00:02:18.200> a<00:02:18.230> drill<00:02:18.590> bit<00:02:19.269> are<00:02:20.269> the<00:02:20.359> one<00:02:20.510> I'm

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
size as a drill bit are the one I'm

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:21.970 
size as a drill bit are the one I'm
using<00:02:20.780> I<00:02:20.959> believe<00:02:20.989> is<00:02:21.290> actually<00:02:21.620> a<00:02:21.650> quarter

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
using I believe is actually a quarter

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:28.979 
using I believe is actually a quarter
inch<00:02:24.130> which<00:02:25.130> is<00:02:25.220> uh<00:02:25.540> around<00:02:26.540> six<00:02:26.930> millimeters

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:28.989 
inch which is uh around six millimeters

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:31.809 
inch which is uh around six millimeters
but<00:02:29.989> they<00:02:30.170> sell<00:02:30.470> those<00:02:30.680> dots<00:02:31.010> in<00:02:31.310> different

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:31.819 
but they sell those dots in different

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:36.610 
but they sell those dots in different
sizes<00:02:33.579> and<00:02:34.579> here<00:02:35.359> I'm<00:02:35.450> just<00:02:35.630> taking<00:02:36.230> a<00:02:36.319> scrap

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
sizes and here I'm just taking a scrap

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.430 
sizes and here I'm just taking a scrap
piece<00:02:36.859> of<00:02:36.889> wood<00:02:37.250> and<00:02:37.609> just<00:02:37.989> testing<00:02:38.989> my<00:02:39.109> drill

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
piece of wood and just testing my drill

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.220 
piece of wood and just testing my drill
bit<00:02:39.620> out<00:02:39.849> to<00:02:40.849> make<00:02:41.030> sure<00:02:41.269> that<00:02:41.450> my<00:02:41.630> dots<00:02:41.870> will

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
bit out to make sure that my dots will

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.839 
bit out to make sure that my dots will
indeed<00:02:42.590> fit<00:02:42.950> snugly<00:02:43.579> inside<00:02:44.030> this<00:02:44.269> hole<00:02:45.849> you

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:48.819 
indeed fit snugly inside this hole you
can<00:02:46.970> see<00:02:47.090> the<00:02:47.209> little<00:02:47.419> dot<00:02:47.630> there<00:02:47.989> I'm<00:02:48.680> just

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:48.829 
can see the little dot there I'm just

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:52.539 
can see the little dot there I'm just
going<00:02:49.040> to<00:02:49.099> test<00:02:49.340> fit<00:02:49.639> it<00:02:50.889> see<00:02:51.889> if<00:02:52.010> it'll<00:02:52.160> fit<00:02:52.370> in

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:52.549 
going to test fit it see if it'll fit in

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:54.819 
going to test fit it see if it'll fit in
there<00:02:52.760> snug<00:02:53.090> and<00:02:53.480> that<00:02:53.900> it<00:02:54.019> can<00:02:54.169> be<00:02:54.200> pushed<00:02:54.530> in

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:54.829 
there snug and that it can be pushed in

00:02:54.829 --> 00:03:01.020 
there snug and that it can be pushed in
pretty<00:02:55.519> flush<00:02:55.849> with<00:02:56.120> the<00:02:56.269> surface

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.160 

and<00:03:01.630> I'm<00:03:01.720> just<00:03:01.870> gonna<00:03:02.050> take<00:03:03.630> that<00:03:04.630> little<00:03:04.870> end

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
and I'm just gonna take that little end

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.460 
and I'm just gonna take that little end
and<00:03:05.440> just<00:03:05.650> tap<00:03:06.070> it<00:03:06.250> in<00:03:06.370> place<00:03:06.990> once<00:03:07.990> I<00:03:08.110> see<00:03:08.320> that

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
and just tap it in place once I see that

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:15.590 
and just tap it in place once I see that
it<00:03:08.590> fits<00:03:09.000> I'll<00:03:10.000> just<00:03:10.270> pop<00:03:10.480> that<00:03:10.510> dot<00:03:10.900> back<00:03:11.110> out

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.230 

so<00:03:16.600> now<00:03:16.780> it's<00:03:16.930> just<00:03:17.020> a<00:03:17.320> matter<00:03:17.500> of<00:03:18.180> drilling<00:03:19.180> a

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:19.240 
so now it's just a matter of drilling a

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.590 
so now it's just a matter of drilling a
small<00:03:19.570> hole<00:03:20.730> and<00:03:21.730> you<00:03:21.820> don't<00:03:22.000> want<00:03:22.180> to<00:03:22.209> go<00:03:22.360> real

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
small hole and you don't want to go real

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.140 
small hole and you don't want to go real
deep<00:03:22.840> here<00:03:23.220> and<00:03:24.220> you<00:03:24.340> can<00:03:24.550> see<00:03:24.760> the<00:03:24.910> thickness

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
deep here and you can see the thickness

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.180 
deep here and you can see the thickness
on<00:03:25.480> your<00:03:25.630> dots<00:03:25.900> you<00:03:26.230> don't<00:03:26.500> have<00:03:26.680> to<00:03:26.800> go<00:03:26.950> much

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
on your dots you don't have to go much

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:31.290 
on your dots you don't have to go much
more<00:03:27.430> than<00:03:27.640> that<00:03:29.250> it's<00:03:30.250> just<00:03:30.490> a<00:03:30.610> very<00:03:30.910> shallow

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:31.300 
more than that it's just a very shallow

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:39.550 
more than that it's just a very shallow
little<00:03:31.690> drill<00:03:32.080> cut

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.590 

and<00:03:39.709> you<00:03:40.250> can<00:03:40.459> kind<00:03:40.640> of<00:03:40.670> play<00:03:40.910> with<00:03:40.940> it<00:03:41.360> and<00:03:41.450> get

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
and you can kind of play with it and get

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.309 
and you can kind of play with it and get
it<00:03:41.720> the<00:03:41.840> depth<00:03:42.110> you<00:03:42.230> want<00:03:43.390> until<00:03:44.390> you're<00:03:44.870> a<00:03:44.900> dot

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:45.319 
it the depth you want until you're a dot

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:47.860 
it the depth you want until you're a dot
fits<00:03:45.620> in<00:03:45.830> there<00:03:46.010> nice<00:03:46.220> and<00:03:46.250> snug<00:03:46.670> and<00:03:47.180> pretty

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
fits in there nice and snug and pretty

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.640 
fits in there nice and snug and pretty
flush<00:03:48.230> with<00:03:48.560> the<00:03:49.450> fretboard<00:03:50.450> and<00:03:50.990> since<00:03:51.470> that

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
flush with the fretboard and since that

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.390 
flush with the fretboard and since that
has<00:03:51.830> a<00:03:51.860> curvature<00:03:52.520> on<00:03:52.700> it<00:03:54.010> it's<00:03:55.010> not<00:03:55.190> going<00:03:55.340> to

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
has a curvature on it it's not going to

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.430 
has a curvature on it it's not going to
be<00:03:55.490> perfectly<00:03:56.060> flush<00:03:56.420> we'll<00:03:56.870> come<00:03:57.080> back<00:03:57.260> and

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440 
be perfectly flush we'll come back and

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.059 
be perfectly flush we'll come back and
sand<00:03:57.680> those<00:03:57.890> later<00:03:59.590> and<00:04:00.590> I'm<00:04:00.650> just<00:04:00.830> going<00:04:00.950> to

00:04:01.059 --> 00:04:01.069 
sand those later and I'm just going to

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:02.559 
sand those later and I'm just going to
tap<00:04:01.250> that<00:04:01.280> into<00:04:01.670> place<00:04:01.880> and<00:04:02.150> make<00:04:02.239> sure<00:04:02.390> I<00:04:02.420> get

00:04:02.559 --> 00:04:02.569 
tap that into place and make sure I get

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:11.680 
tap that into place and make sure I get
a<00:04:02.690> good<00:04:02.780> fit

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.410 

okay<00:04:12.380> then<00:04:13.130> once<00:04:13.370> you've<00:04:13.520> got<00:04:13.730> that<00:04:13.910> done<00:04:14.120> just

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:14.420 
okay then once you've got that done just

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:15.790 
okay then once you've got that done just
go<00:04:14.510> ahead<00:04:14.660> and<00:04:14.750> do<00:04:14.840> the<00:04:14.960> same<00:04:15.170> thing<00:04:15.500> with<00:04:15.680> the

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:15.800 
go ahead and do the same thing with the

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:20.380 
go ahead and do the same thing with the
rest<00:04:15.980> of<00:04:16.130> your<00:04:16.280> marks<00:04:16.640> and<00:04:19.030> then<00:04:20.030> I'm<00:04:20.209> actually

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:20.390 
rest of your marks and then I'm actually

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:24.090 
rest of your marks and then I'm actually
going<00:04:20.600> to<00:04:20.720> glue<00:04:20.900> these<00:04:21.080> in<00:04:21.350> with<00:04:21.560> superglue

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:24.100 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.860 

there's<00:04:25.100> several<00:04:25.700> different<00:04:25.850> kinds<00:04:26.210> in<00:04:26.630> there

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
there's several different kinds in there

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:28.360 
there's several different kinds in there
you<00:04:27.170> might<00:04:27.350> want<00:04:27.530> to<00:04:27.560> have<00:04:27.710> a<00:04:27.740> few<00:04:28.040> clamps

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
you might want to have a few clamps

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.330 
you might want to have a few clamps
ready<00:04:28.730> just<00:04:29.030> to<00:04:29.150> hold<00:04:29.330> it<00:04:29.480> in<00:04:29.630> place<00:04:30.340> while

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
ready just to hold it in place while

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.640 
ready just to hold it in place while
that<00:04:31.580> super<00:04:31.910> glue<00:04:31.940> dries<00:04:32.380> nice<00:04:33.380> thing<00:04:33.620> about

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:33.650 
that super glue dries nice thing about

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.070 
that super glue dries nice thing about
the<00:04:33.980> super<00:04:34.280> glue<00:04:34.460> is<00:04:34.580> it<00:04:34.730> dries<00:04:34.910> so<00:04:34.940> quick<00:04:35.570> you

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 
the super glue is it dries so quick you

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:40.150 
the super glue is it dries so quick you
don't<00:04:36.110> have<00:04:36.380> to<00:04:36.500> hold<00:04:36.650> it<00:04:36.830> very<00:04:36.950> long<00:04:39.130> I'm<00:04:40.130> just

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 
don't have to hold it very long I'm just

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:47.680 
don't have to hold it very long I'm just
gonna<00:04:40.490> put<00:04:40.790> a<00:04:41.030> couple<00:04:41.360> of<00:04:41.390> drops<00:04:41.540> in<00:04:41.900> here<00:04:46.690> just

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:47.690 
gonna put a couple of drops in here just

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:52.210 
gonna put a couple of drops in here just
sort<00:04:47.990> of<00:04:48.050> slide<00:04:48.320> your<00:04:48.590> dot<00:04:48.770> in<00:04:49.040> place<00:04:51.010> press<00:04:52.010> it

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:52.220 
sort of slide your dot in place press it

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:55.960 
sort of slide your dot in place press it
in<00:04:52.340> so<00:04:52.580> that<00:04:52.730> you<00:04:52.790> get<00:04:52.940> it<00:04:53.060> flush<00:04:54.820> and<00:04:55.820> if

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:55.970 
in so that you get it flush and if

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:57.250 
in so that you get it flush and if
you're<00:04:56.150> careful<00:04:56.420> enough<00:04:56.690> you<00:04:56.870> probably<00:04:57.140> won't

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:57.260 
you're careful enough you probably won't

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.050 
you're careful enough you probably won't
get<00:04:57.410> a<00:04:57.470> lot<00:04:57.530> of<00:04:57.800> squeeze<00:04:58.070> out<00:04:58.250> if<00:04:58.490> you<00:04:58.610> do<00:04:58.790> just

00:04:59.050 --> 00:04:59.060 
get a lot of squeeze out if you do just

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:00.430 
get a lot of squeeze out if you do just
be<00:04:59.180> careful<00:04:59.630> and<00:04:59.720> not<00:04:59.810> get<00:04:59.990> that<00:05:00.170> on<00:05:00.290> your

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:00.440 
be careful and not get that on your

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:04.630 
be careful and not get that on your
fingers<00:05:01.510> and<00:05:02.830> here<00:05:03.830> I'm<00:05:03.950> just<00:05:03.980> going<00:05:04.250> to<00:05:04.370> clamp

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:04.640 
fingers and here I'm just going to clamp

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:08.050 
fingers and here I'm just going to clamp
it<00:05:04.790> in<00:05:04.940> place<00:05:05.290> and<00:05:06.400> again<00:05:07.400> it<00:05:07.520> doesn't<00:05:07.700> have<00:05:07.940> to

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:08.060 
it in place and again it doesn't have to

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:13.150 
it in place and again it doesn't have to
stay<00:05:08.330> that<00:05:08.570> long<00:05:11.410> you<00:05:12.410> know<00:05:12.500> about<00:05:12.680> a<00:05:12.740> minute

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:13.160 
stay that long you know about a minute

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.660 
stay that long you know about a minute
or<00:05:13.250> so<00:05:13.520> and<00:05:13.550> then<00:05:13.790> move<00:05:14.090> on<00:05:14.300> to<00:05:14.390> the<00:05:14.480> next<00:05:14.780> dot

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:15.670 
or so and then move on to the next dot

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:18.070 
or so and then move on to the next dot
there<00:05:16.670> you<00:05:16.790> can<00:05:16.940> see<00:05:17.150> we've<00:05:17.300> got<00:05:17.510> all<00:05:17.720> our<00:05:17.750> dots

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:18.080 
there you can see we've got all our dots

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.610 
there you can see we've got all our dots
glued<00:05:18.440> in<00:05:18.590> place<00:05:20.020> then<00:05:21.020> I'm<00:05:21.140> going<00:05:21.410> back<00:05:21.440> with

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:21.620 
glued in place then I'm going back with

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:26.320 
glued in place then I'm going back with
our<00:05:22.510> radius<00:05:23.510> blocks<00:05:24.550> our<00:05:25.550> radius<00:05:25.910> sanding

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:26.330 
our radius blocks our radius sanding

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:36.250 
our radius blocks our radius sanding
blocks<00:05:27.160> I'm<00:05:28.160> using<00:05:28.370> some<00:05:28.669> 180<00:05:29.060> grit<00:05:29.360> paper

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:36.260 

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:40.890 

and<00:05:36.770> we're<00:05:37.010> going<00:05:37.190> to<00:05:38.500> just<00:05:39.500> gently<00:05:39.740> sort<00:05:40.250> of

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:40.900 
and we're going to just gently sort of

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:43.770 
and we're going to just gently sort of
Reece<00:05:41.900> and<00:05:42.140> the<00:05:42.410> top<00:05:42.620> of<00:05:42.770> that<00:05:42.860> fretboard

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:43.780 
Reece and the top of that fretboard

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:46.630 
Reece and the top of that fretboard
being<00:05:44.780> very<00:05:45.020> mindful<00:05:45.320> of<00:05:45.560> the<00:05:45.800> contours<00:05:46.310> and

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:46.640 
being very mindful of the contours and

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:48.390 
being very mindful of the contours and
the<00:05:46.730> curvature<00:05:47.000> that<00:05:47.390> you<00:05:47.480> have<00:05:47.690> in<00:05:47.870> there<00:05:48.050> and

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:48.400 
the curvature that you have in there and

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.950 
the curvature that you have in there and
we're<00:05:49.400> really<00:05:49.580> not<00:05:49.730> trying<00:05:50.000> to<00:05:50.180> dig<00:05:50.450> into<00:05:50.690> the

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:50.960 
we're really not trying to dig into the

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.110 
we're really not trying to dig into the
wood<00:05:51.140> as<00:05:51.410> much<00:05:51.650> as<00:05:51.890> just<00:05:52.100> level<00:05:52.580> off<00:05:52.730> the<00:05:52.910> top

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:53.120 
wood as much as just level off the top

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.590 
wood as much as just level off the top
of<00:05:53.150> those<00:05:53.390> frets<00:05:53.810> or<00:05:54.100> the<00:05:55.120> inlay<00:05:56.120> dots<00:05:56.390> I

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:56.600 
of those frets or the inlay dots I

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:00.310 
of those frets or the inlay dots I
should<00:05:56.810> say<00:05:58.660> there<00:05:59.660> you<00:05:59.780> can<00:05:59.930> see<00:06:00.110> we've<00:06:00.290> got

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:00.320 
should say there you can see we've got

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:03.700 
should say there you can see we've got
up<00:06:00.590> sanded<00:06:01.010> nice<00:06:01.190> and<00:06:01.430> flush
