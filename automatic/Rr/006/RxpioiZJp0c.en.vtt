00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 Have we had a bank break talking? 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.839
 Welcome to another video this time I 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.599
 I'm taking you out here like talking about 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:12.719
 totta for frozen throne s3 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.639
 it is not the game need not right and 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.520
 frozen throne expansion 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:20.490
 because it is primarily they will have to 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.859
 hit the zipped file in my case is 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.680
 doctor edson dairy products also 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:29.160
 doctor will have the pope this is what i came 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.330
 here inside another cornet by another 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:35.610
 map 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:38.000
 if it's the case again, I will not let it 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.000
 Open 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:45.420
 let's see on my computer the computer 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.680
 on local disk if you have 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.120
 installed elsewhere 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:01:01.079
 this place to move to emerson also 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:01:03.420
 crowded even the arc f3 né maps is capable 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.260
 or are the maps if you want to not 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.119
 stay the 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.720
 You'll put it here but it only works. 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:13.290
 if you put our philosophy of a 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:16.110
 chaos or frozen by the college if it is 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.119
 Little hand so it's because it's a problem. 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.470
 tax is blue, that's because 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:24.930
 it is the product of a house here 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:34.259
 craft file type spec 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:46.530
 So I'm going to go over here and done it. 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:48.630
 example to open the game if I could 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:52.619
 but I'm recording with eight ketsana that 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:56.930
 this program and then I will not open 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:02:00.020
 But after that, it's just you, right? 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:03.140
 sérgio that does not touch the scenario requires 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.850
 partnerships and neri not even in what 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:11.780
 was emptied and fiddling with the noise 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:14.140
 It's there and that's it, people here are just 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:17.030
 You open the game at home too. 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.490
 chose the map effect guys that's it 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:23.180
 I'll stick around for witches if you 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:27.670
 want more video lessons say that's right 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.670
 Well guys it was worth even more.
