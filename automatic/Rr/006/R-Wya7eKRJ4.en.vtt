00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.130 

now<00:01:13.250> I<00:01:13.460> really<00:01:13.790> often<00:01:13.940> like<00:01:14.510> to<00:01:14.750> leave<00:01:14.930> little

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
now I really often like to leave little

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.650 
now I really often like to leave little
pieces<00:01:15.440> of<00:01:15.650> hair<00:01:15.890> out<00:01:16.130> of<00:01:16.730> a<00:01:17.090> client's<00:01:17.480> own

pieces of hair out of a client's own

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.590 
pieces of hair out of a client's own
hair<00:01:18.050> because<00:01:18.800> they<00:01:18.950> will<00:01:19.190> possibly<00:01:19.550> be<00:01:20.180> able

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
hair because they will possibly be able

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.010 
hair because they will possibly be able
to<00:01:20.720> use<00:01:21.050> this<00:01:21.350> hair<00:01:21.680> in<00:01:21.890> the<00:01:22.280> hairline<00:01:23.020> when

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
to use this hair in the hairline when

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.380 
to use this hair in the hairline when
I'm<00:01:24.140> putting<00:01:24.440> the<00:01:24.530> wig<00:01:24.710> on<00:01:24.890> so<00:01:25.790> leave<00:01:26.030> it<00:01:26.060> as<00:01:26.270> an

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
I'm putting the wig on so leave it as an

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.270 
I'm putting the wig on so leave it as an
option<00:01:26.600> and<00:01:26.900> if<00:01:27.020> it<00:01:27.140> doesn't<00:01:27.590> work<00:01:27.770> out<00:01:27.980> you

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
option and if it doesn't work out you

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.820 
option and if it doesn't work out you
can<00:01:28.430> always<00:01:28.610> get<00:01:28.940> rid<00:01:29.090> of<00:01:29.120> it<00:01:29.270> afterwards<00:01:29.830> step

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:30.830 
can always get rid of it afterwards step

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.190 
can always get rid of it afterwards step
one<00:01:31.100> is<00:01:31.310> a<00:01:31.340> very<00:01:31.700> important<00:01:32.270> step<00:01:32.360> because<00:01:32.780> the

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
one is a very important step because the

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.320 
one is a very important step because the
base<00:01:33.470> is<00:01:33.860> the<00:01:34.100> most<00:01:34.280> important<00:01:34.790> thing<00:01:34.970> when

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:35.330 
base is the most important thing when

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.490 
base is the most important thing when
you're<00:01:35.450> using<00:01:35.690> a<00:01:36.020> wig<00:01:36.550> the<00:01:37.550> next<00:01:37.820> thing<00:01:37.940> to

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
you're using a wig the next thing to

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.380 
you're using a wig the next thing to
inside<00:01:39.500> the<00:01:39.650> wig<00:01:40.870> if<00:01:41.870> you<00:01:41.960> take<00:01:42.140> a<00:01:42.200> close<00:01:42.410> look

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
inside the wig if you take a close look

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.980 
inside the wig if you take a close look
there<00:01:44.390> are<00:01:44.420> these<00:01:44.630> little<00:01:44.690> velcro<00:01:45.670> straps

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
there are these little velcro straps

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.080 
there are these little velcro straps
where<00:01:47.990> you<00:01:48.080> can<00:01:48.200> either<00:01:48.350> have<00:01:48.650> it<00:01:48.680> wider<00:01:49.580> or

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
where you can either have it wider or

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.360 
where you can either have it wider or
tighter<00:01:51.190> according<00:01:52.190> to<00:01:52.370> the<00:01:52.490> head<00:01:52.730> size<00:01:54.370> we

I<00:02:29.079> get<00:02:30.079> your<00:02:30.260> your<00:02:30.680> wig<00:02:30.860> sitting<00:02:31.189> nicely<00:02:31.549> first

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
I get your your wig sitting nicely first

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.970 
I get your your wig sitting nicely first
of<00:02:32.150> all<00:02:32.360> now<00:02:32.720> these<00:02:32.870> pieces<00:02:33.200> here<00:02:33.590> I<00:02:33.709> can

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
of all now these pieces here I can

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.309 
of all now these pieces here I can
actually<00:02:34.159> bring<00:02:34.489> out<00:02:34.790> and<00:02:35.299> see<00:02:35.599> if<00:02:35.840> this<00:02:36.110> will

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:36.319 
actually bring out and see if this will

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:44.190 
actually bring out and see if this will
work<00:02:37.030> to<00:02:38.030> blend<00:02:38.659> the<00:02:39.170> real<00:02:39.409> hair<00:02:40.329> into<00:02:41.329> the<00:02:41.900> wig

work to blend the real hair into the wig

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.960 
work to blend the real hair into the wig
so<00:02:45.200> that<00:02:45.379> would<00:02:45.560> be<00:02:45.590> an<00:02:45.799> option<00:02:46.010> obviously

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
so that would be an option obviously

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.880 
so that would be an option obviously
when<00:02:47.120> you<00:02:47.209> blend<00:02:47.480> and<00:02:48.019> you<00:02:48.140> see<00:02:48.319> the<00:02:48.439> hairline

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
when you blend and you see the hairline

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.339 
when you blend and you see the hairline
you<00:02:49.700> get<00:02:49.849> a<00:02:49.879> much<00:02:50.120> more<00:02:50.150> realistic<00:02:50.659> effect<00:02:51.200> so

00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:51.349
