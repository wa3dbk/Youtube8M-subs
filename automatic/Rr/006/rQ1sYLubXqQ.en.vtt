00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:28.190
 knitting this pattern 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:32.140
 chain of air loops 

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:37.059
 the number of loops must be a multiple of 7 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:40.730
 plus 4 more 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:46.850
 first knit 2 air loops 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:51.040
 for lifting we do a hook covering and 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:56.920
 skipping two loops in the third loop 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:56.920
 we knit a column with one nakida and 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:08.810
 then knit 2 more posts with one 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:14.140
 nakida following loop 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:14.140
 one column in each loop 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:30.940
 Now we knit 2 air loops and 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:40.330
 skipping one loop 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:44.710
 knit in the base of the next loop 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.710
 single crochet 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:00.760
 then knit 2 air loops and 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:13.790
 skipping one loop at the base 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:22.610
 next loop knit column with 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:26.390
 one crochet and then knit three more 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:31.810
 single crochet one by one 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:31.810
 column in each loop of the base 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:39.820
 just get 4 columns with one 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.820
 nakidom 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:03:03.879
 and then knitting is repeated knit two 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:06.550
 air loops and passing one loop in 

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:11.730
 knit the base without crochet 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:16.720
 again two air loops and skipping 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:22.810
 one loop at the base of 4 columns with 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:27.940
 one look so connected 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:34.260
 first row and now knit one 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:39.849
 air loop and overturn knitting 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:43.019
 we will knit the second row to the top itself 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:51.579
 the first column we dress the hook and 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:04:00.970
 we knit a column without nakida then 

00:03:51.579 --> 00:04:07.620
 knit 2 air loops and to the top 4 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:07.620
 we knit a column without nakida 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:23.200
 knit 3 air loops 1 2 and 3 and then 

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:27.580
 to the top 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:30.870
 next column knit column 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.870
 without nakida 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:44.960
 and the share of luck we will be repeated 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:49.190
 knit 2 air loops then in 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:57.580
 fourth column knit column 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:57.580
 without crochet again 3 air loops and 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:13.120
 again the next bar column without 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:15.230
 nakida and so knit to the end of the row so 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:21.520
 looks related 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:25.700
 row now knit one air loop 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:28.790
 turn knitting and start knitting 

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:31.780
 third row the third row we knit 

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:36.110
 similar to the first 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:40.790
 knitting 2 more air loops for 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:44.630
 lifting do the hooks and under 

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:49.270
 knit a chain of air loops 3 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:49.270
 single crochet 1 

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:02.070
 2 and 3 

00:06:07.009 --> 00:06:13.210
 Now we knit 2 air loops and 

00:06:13.479 --> 00:06:22.960
 under the next chain of air 

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:29.569
 loops knit 1 column without nakida 

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:34.749
 then knit again d air loop and 4 

00:06:29.569 --> 00:06:39.039
 single crochet under the chain of 

00:06:34.749 --> 00:06:39.039
 air loops 1 

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:48.750
 2 

00:06:54.350 --> 00:07:02.050
 3 and 4 

00:07:06.449 --> 00:07:14.059
 further knitting pattern repeats 

00:07:10.099 --> 00:07:17.819
 we knit 2 air loops column 

00:07:14.059 --> 00:07:22.529
 without nakida under the next air 

00:07:17.819 --> 00:07:27.259
 chain again two air loops and 4 

00:07:22.529 --> 00:07:34.460
 single crochet under the next 

00:07:27.259 --> 00:07:37.740
 the air chain and here's a row ready 

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:40.050
 the next row we provyazyvaem accurately even 

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:44.219
 how to knit the previous one 

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:47.219
 and further knitting is repeated in each 

00:07:44.219 --> 00:07:50.310
 odd number we knit since knit 1 

00:07:47.219 --> 00:07:54.810
 row a in each even since knit 2 

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:56.969
 A number of this pattern is well suited for 

00:07:54.810 --> 00:08:00.689
 knitting cotton yarn 

00:07:56.969 --> 00:08:06.139
 so from woolen for example this pattern 

00:08:00.689 --> 00:08:06.139
 was bound from fine angora
