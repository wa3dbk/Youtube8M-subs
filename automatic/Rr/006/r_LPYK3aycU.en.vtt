00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 hello j their poorly trained expert 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.009
 running I'm delighted with you 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.049
 find for this video in which 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.610
 I will share with you the answer 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.260
 that I had brought to françois during 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.719
 of one of our coaching run appointments 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.790
 360 and during which françois 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.139
 question how to introduce 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.900
 physical preparation work 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.240
 specific during some warm-ups 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.920
 before some quality sessions for 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.400
 that we immediately find ourselves at 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.400
 jing pony 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:32.070
 and 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.079
 m 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:44.750
 so first of all it's good to 

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:44.980
 remember that to progress in the race to 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.629
 foot 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.010
 it is important to look after obviously 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:51.199
 of the engine ie all that 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.949
 touches on the physiological aspect of a 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:53.659
 effort in running 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:55.100
 but we must also take care of 

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:56.690
 body of the runner ie 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.699
 that it is also important to perform a 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.920
 muscle building work 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:02.570
 in order to get a crowd is a lot 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.129
 more effective and above all a football 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.869
 a crowd and have particularly effective 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:06.289
 when fatigue sets in over time 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:08.539
 kilometers 

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:10.640
 and to perform this type of 

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:12.050
 muscle building the course on foot 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.039
 has different tools and 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.440
 including preparation exercises 

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:17.140
 specified physical then of what he 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.460
 this is but it is simply 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.869
 from educational to exercise tic that 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.550
 do regularly in clubs 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:24.830
 athletics and that is for example 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.360
 to exercises from heels to buttocks 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.610
 to raise the knee of stretched legs 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.110
 of support leaping from two strides 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.810
 bouncy finally not a whole range 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:35.360
 of exercises that if you want to achieve 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.069
 on a regular basis this will contribute 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.350
 to improve your stride to make your 

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:40.789
 stride more effective then precisely these 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.600
 physical preparation exercises 

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:43.670
 specific 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.770
 it is possible to make some 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.179
 some during some quality sessions 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.099
 a particular when you make a 

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:50.810
 vma session then at the level precisely 

00:01:49.099 --> 00:01:52.759
 of the organization ben that's how it 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.289
 must do it then you go like 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:55.729
 any workout and all 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:57.349
 quality sessions start 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:58.879
 obligatory by jogging 

00:01:57.349 --> 00:02:01.160
 the fundamental audience 1 ie 

00:01:58.879 --> 00:02:03.080
 that there you will run for 20 to 25 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.209
 even 30 minutes in ten years we have mental 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.819
 that is, an intensity of effort that 

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:09.560
 is between 65 75 or even 

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:10.310
 finally jogging 80% of your frequency 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.290
 maximum heart rate 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.610
 once you have done this 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.890
 Ben jogging you are simply going 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.810
 enchain by ten minutes an area of 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.640
 specified physical preparation work 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.800
 there you have organized for example 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.120
 over a distance that is 50 is a 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.010
 the ideal is to do it on a 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.200
 lawn by donating a football field a 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.480
 lawn well well flat a good stable 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.250
 and on which you will chain 50 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.330
 m working and then 50 m from 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.260
 recovery you will be able 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.510
 operate as a round trip 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.269
 but you can also perform this type 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.190
 exercise on a well stabilized path 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:43.159
 well stable so you do for example 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.120
 50 m of buttocks then you 

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:45.950
 return quietly to the point of 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.930
 departure by walking when it is necessary 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.829
 recover softly is back 50 m 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.959
 e.g. knees mounted 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:52.999
 the device you recover will go back 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:53.610
 quietly walking after you 

00:02:52.999 --> 00:02:55.830
 go on 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:58.500
 so by 50 m of people of the same tone 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.820
 principle you are going to do your 50 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.200
 meters you come back by walking and then 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:03.690
 you're going to chain like that different 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.760
 types of exercises to achieve a 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.720
 working volume of around 10,000 and 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.400
 and then once you've done you 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.860
 ten minutes you go directly to 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.090
 your actual session was me 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.740
 for example if you are in the frame 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.700
 a payment session then 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:16.230
 question posed françois 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.420
 he was wondering about 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.530
 need or not to reprogram a 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.330
 little jogging to once you have 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.880
 does your preparation work 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.810
 specific physics for example this 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.640
 so your warm up jogging at 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.440
 physical preparation work that 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.330
 specific and therefore to what was needed 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.070
 then plan a short jog 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.690
 to start the session of vma properly 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.160
 says and the wave and then my question and 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.910
 no once you've done this 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.690
 physical preparation work 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.760
 specific 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:41.970
 Well, you'll go straight to 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:44.610
 on your notice to split pace 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.320
 vehement so obviously it'll create 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.880
 a little near muscle fatigue 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.200
 but hey it can be so interesting 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.420
 to work on this little near 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.250
 fatigue and that will allow your time 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:56.250
 like that to make your session still 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:58.230
 more effective so through these 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.150
 exercises well there's going to contribute to these 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:01.500
 exercises by so have contributed so is going 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.000
 work in France in muscles and then 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.590
 bah allow you to get an abut 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.090
 much more effective in running 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.070
 so obviously these exercises you 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.570
 will be able to also make advance 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:12.120
 some other quality sessions 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:14.310
 including specific work sessions 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:17.340
 10 km or so of work to split 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.299
 moderate pace type 85 90% of fortis 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.370
 maximum heart rate 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:23.790
 so when you do for example 3 x 8 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.660
 minutes at 80 81 85 for 90% of your 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:26.640
 maximum heart rate 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.990
 well you can predict between your 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:29.910
 warm-up jogging and your session 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.919
 proper this type of exercise has 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.650
 also then obviously against this 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:36.330
 type of exercise we will not program it 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:38.640
 during a recovery jog or a 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.979
 regeneration jogging it is important 

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:44.190
 not to do that day perform this type 

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:45.360
 exercise then and then also this guy 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:47.070
 of exercise you can obviously 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.810
 schedule before a storytelling session 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:51.720
 so as soon as at a quality session 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:53.280
 do not hesitate from time to time she not 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.050
 systematically once in two or 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.710
 two out of three times to program this 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:57.930
 type 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:00.540
 exercise is well in the meanwhile 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:02.610
 that you too would set up this 

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:03.120
 type of exercise during your games 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:05.220
 warm up 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.740
 Well, I invite you to click on the link 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:09.180
 present on this video or below 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:10.740
 this video to indicate your name 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.840
 your email address is so I want 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.160
 able to send you a series of

 free videos extracted from my 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.890
 coaching and coaching program 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:18.750
 run 360 

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:21.090
 and then it will be an opportunity for you to 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:22.550
 discover precisely through this 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:25.230
 series of videos to exercises 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:26.300
 to perform this work of 

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:28.380
 muscle building 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:30.780
 from here to here I wish you a good 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:33.740
 workout a good run and then I'll you
