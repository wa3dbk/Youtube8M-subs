00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:18.270
 hello and servus to another video 

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:21.090
 eswe traffic today with a new one 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.980
 follow from the series ESWE traffic close 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.869
 I go for her on behalf of her 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.460
 in situations you as a passenger 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.130
 normally can not experience and 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.489
 Today my way leads me to wiesbadens 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.650
 weirdest of bergbahn the landmark 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.600
 nerobergbahn is germany's oldest 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.010
 rack and pinion the with 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.239
 water ballast is operated 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:44.309
 she became the first on 25 September 1888 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.559
 once put into operation since then 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:50.699
 She always from april to october each 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:52.769
 day the 245 meter high mountain up the 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:54.900
 The track was built exactly in time 

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:56.519
 as Kaiser Wilhelm the second more common 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.710
 in and out of Wiesbaden 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:00.390
 but if the monarch ever with himself 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.960
 The train is driven is not 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.570
 traditional 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.489
 but it is clear that today I honor 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.549
 Once you have the choice to control 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.960
 and I'm really looking forward to that 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.520
 very glad i made my adventure today 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.170
 not alone must deny because at 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.729
 me peter is on the deputy 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.470
 manager nerobergbahn hello peter 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.610
 Hello, I am very glad that you are here today 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.100
 I do not need my side until then 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.600
 have so much fear and it is so 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.910
 that nerobergbahn almost from above 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.220
 So is controlled sitting up there 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:27.540
 He has to give the gas but I want 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.430
 Today nerobergbahn drive how do I get 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.440
 Now go up and sweat 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.880
 Nothing here the colleague of the above 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:37.609
 starts the first time must the track 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:40.079
 run well then soundless countries 

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:42.539
 440 meters long is the distance from the 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.280
 talstation upstairs peter smoke and me 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:46.319
 climb along the rails to the 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.750
 neroberg at the steepest point even 

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:51.090
 with an increase of 25 percent 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.500
 on the way we check the steel cable over 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.270
 the two dare each other 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.280
 are connected and also at the 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.380
 Dodge at both railcars 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.009
 We pass by each other 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.869
 the right one 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.119
 Finally, no stones on the 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.709
 Today it is with rope and rails 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.630
 Keep everything in order 

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:08.670
 the train is pulled up with the 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.250
 Stahlseil we already know why 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:14.060
 then need the gear in 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.890
 this rack is running a gear and 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.299
 This gear is by means of a 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.099
 brake drum, the left / right 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:21.569
 who is screwed on others 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:22.440
 delayed and until standstill 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:25.230
 brought 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.540
 that means that now we have a long way to go 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.269
 made it to the top or yes as good as 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:33.150
 Now almost half the monument we have 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:35.459
 still 250 meters ahead of us and I have 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.040
 I'm fine now then 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:40.019
 the last meters my breath goes 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.970
 much heavier but the mountain station 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:44.130
 is in sight directly under the monument 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.200
 protected stations is the 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:49.620
 the heart of the nerobergbahn the 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:52.079
 historic order wheel dating back to 1888 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.700
 over this the steel rope is laid with 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:53.970
 the two cars are connected 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.010
 are 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.930
 So it turns alternately to the left 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.350
 or to the right depending on which 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.450
 is pulled upwards 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.970
 peter the nerobergbahn works with yes 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.320
 water ballast so that the dare 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.190
 It's going to be really hard for the poor guy 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.570
 can pull up 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.300
 I do not see any here yet 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:13.520
 water so that he that we have 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:15.380
 hiding that is underground but we 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.000
 have the possibility of the water from the 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.840
 the ethical reads in the car 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.070
 to let and now he makes a 90 degrees 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:25.040
 movement that is a vettel revolution 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:27.290
 in the direction where it is possible and with it 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.880
 do you open the slide and you 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.170
 listening to what he does as much water 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.420
 completely ran 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:36.050
 even if there will not carry passengers 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.440
 but at least minimal at last of 3,500 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:37.730
 t 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:41.770
 and how do you know exactly when ? 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:44.240
 inside is showing plays too you see that 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:46.940
 glass want two meters long 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:49.190
 there we always have and this one 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:51.230
 Swimmer tells you how much water you are in 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:53.360
 your case fits so we know now 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.280
 It's important to start your bike 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.960
 importance and weight is important peter 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.650
 How is Oberbank 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:05.150
 we have a model here and free track 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:07.280
 dare mountain dare valley steel rope and ours 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:11.660
 our rope washer tells us about it 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:14.780
 have entertained the upper dare is 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:18.160
 filled with water is made heavier 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:21.080
 as the dare couple and someday 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:23.960
 did that when rolling down the 

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:27.760
 others dare to pull the uphill 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:30.410
 that's just the principle of our ground 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.030
 after a felt eternity that is 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:33.980
 water ran into the mountain carriage and 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:35.990
 now it can finally start 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:38.510
 armed with a crank I may now 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:39.830
 the nerobergbahn into the valley control the 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:42.550
 Incidentally, I need the crank for the crank 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:46.450
 brake of the mountain carriage to solve 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:52.670
 So crank well 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:54.740
 But that's not how it's made 

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:56.720
 bank again let go a bit 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.730
 okay that means when I let go meet 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:03.250
 to call oneself letting go 

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:03.250
 up to much and he up 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:11.820
 That's saying finger's ending in courtyards 

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:13.169
 fingertip feeling very minimal 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:16.020
 make movements 

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:17.849
 the vienna company does not have a good job there 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:19.129
 It is already stated correctly 

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:23.310
 it usually takes two weeks 

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:25.710
 lasts that we have to go there a few times 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:27.430
 now he is getting fast you can 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:30.220
 ever the brake 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:30.940
 connecting happened we are 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:34.540
 stopped 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:36.130
 I did that, so I have to 

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:38.260
 The direction is currently in the form of 

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:40.230
 We do not know how to do it 

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:44.170
 a lot of 

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:46.680
 until now it was okay the usual 

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:46.680
 have 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:53.009
 you dare the other one down there 

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:53.009
 hopefully come do not collide 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:06:00.870
 we stay I are so me as 

00:05:57.939 --> 00:06:00.870
 the last meters 

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:06.150
 a color did right then 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:08.020
 not even at all 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:20.319
 slow down 

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:21.610
 may we brake I have now 

00:06:20.319 --> 00:06:24.699
 but you are cordially from the prospect 

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:26.889
 It only takes a few minutes 

00:06:24.699 --> 00:06:29.470
 took but fun she made my 

00:06:26.889 --> 00:06:31.110
 first ride as a railway leader in the future 

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:33.819
 But I'm one of those again 

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:36.039
 270,000 ordinary passengers 

00:06:33.819 --> 00:06:38.289
 every year with the lifts in 

00:06:36.039 --> 00:06:40.960
 2013 celebrates wiesbaden weirdest 

00:06:38.289 --> 00:06:43.150

 look I've also made good 

00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:59.080
 if the election continues 

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:00.969

 They can drive there and if they are 

00:07:06.069 --> 00:07:09.009
