00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:07.930
 ee 

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:08.380
 But we want to continue to go there and Agnes eyes a Hello Ohori 123 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:13.660
 Also 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:16.960
 Te buy the first time acoustic guitar is entered is more of raw guitar instead of the area line 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:20.260
 I think that I want to talk I think or that it is a lot of people are Auzoya' Do not heard this called 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.730
 But if you say sakkuri I heard heartily 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:25.630
 Divided into two 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:30.340
 I want and do is I, for example, this I think I think is having 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:35.110
 gibson u a 40 this is no pickup at all 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:39.820
 Is to increase the output of the I sound of Tteyuu thing is the pick-up to be told off raw 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:41.720
 Well Well I'd say When me think that the system is that I'm not at all for 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.900
 This word, which has been pure Ako is 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:50.390
 I say that I did Nagi, but more 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:54.050
 Recently speaking well coming out in Namie poked Takami repair 16 place in my videos 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:57.710
 It is electric acoustic guitar that I though I know stands for electric acoustic guitar 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:01:01.740
 I wish I thought it was equipped with a pickup on a raw guitar 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:06.450
 In short, leave the sound of the raw guitar 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:10.770
 It is built under the concept of communicating loudly through big up 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.640
 It is so-called Kanae rare, but I thought it would be divided into these two 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.840
 I think it's good 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:18.990
 Well there is really even older but through this video 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.730
 Akogi I guess I'm going to pull back a bit, some people think that 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:26.710
 But I think that whether or not there is also that my opinion 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:31.660
 Ayla child for the first time face of the Tteyuu's too dark is but I'd like to hear Well by 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:32.860
 I 'm wondering what kind of science other people are better than 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:36.900
 Speaking of volume 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:40.680
 No I do a thing to say precisely because you do it is when the Kama experience different but 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:44.790
 After all the price rise turn method is acoustic itself 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:48.990
 In other words, the live guitar is the one that really sounds like an acoustic sound 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:54.150
 It keeps you give me if I still this is the thing what I described's most powerful example 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.960
 I think I want you to feel it with a raw guitar but it 's a Gibson j 45 though 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.070
 Hey 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.810
 Hmmm 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:02.700
 Well I think I don't understand quite well 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.480
 Goo 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:09.390
 ni 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:09.390
 Well born'm any different I 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:23.110
 me 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:25.330
 What is n't something like a barn tote on the whole surface ? 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:28.660
 I think there is something that doesn't work, but 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.560
 Formerly, the radar has stopped, so this raw guitar 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:34.989
 Hmmm 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:35.590
 I really feel that I'm pulling now, but the vibration stop warship of that raw sound is transmitted 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:38.830
 right 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:42.940
 Let's say the sound coming out of this guitar 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:47.590
 I press I to Ryoke provisions or kana become large that different 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:48.819
 Well there was a problem with the power giving racing that I'm making into this, or all this was 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.550
 I did my best 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:53.660
 In other words 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:59.300
 Although the concept of trying to become a guitar can be seen well 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:03:00.320
 And because the name mites were also there are exceptions, for example, that again when back material fatigue in the so-called plywood 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:06.170
 Some people 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:09.569
 Because I sometimes do it, I still have a completely different shape, but this is Ako 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:12.500
 I can realize that it is the sound of a stick guitar 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:15.280
 Yeah Hey for this net 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.280
 me 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:18.270
 me 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:22.319
 Great 

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:29.129
 car 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.939
 Now I yellow itself I think that can be seen in that mean I Ako stick guitar sound of 

00:03:34.219 --> 00:03:39.019
 Guitar 

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:41.659
 Well, I think that the real amount is still somewhat suppressed compared with Gibson raw guitar alone 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:46.189
 I have a feeling that I do not have ideaco 

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:51.459
 In most cases , the volume gold is often kept at a moderate level. 

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:51.459
 Well , on the stage to say something like a live guitar 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:10.170
 here is how it is a pickup and a little bit 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:14.740
 It is when You're a real howling that would I think I Nyotchi toward another canoe 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:19.209
 Another harsh sound that say that I think that there is an air and Poof 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:20.019
 Especially this acoustic guitar would be Ereako, but I was lazy but it was fine. 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:25.930
 huge 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:29.540
 Always that stretched the fruit of me easy to howling the ok what happens because the volume is out 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:34.190
 After all, you are forced to fight against howling, that is, you already have a glue store 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:35.450
 Order and say if you want to suppress the things Tteyuu maximum of reasons is I that Hanbingu 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:41.070
 As much as possible 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:44.220
 It's the d-amp 861 c what buy copper say but But increase in suppressing the volume 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:48.420
 A top bag 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:52.500
 I'm a end plate side is I know I this plywood 

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:55.800
 Since 5 of Tteyuu number is often the number of Ney and compared with the short version 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:05:01.060
 Well, that 's why it is possible to keep it down 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:04.240
 Somewhere, for example, you often on the side and bag at the time but But the plywood in such a place 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:08.320
 Play and control by using 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:13.060
 In other words, there is a policy to reduce the volume . 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:17.290
 Of course there are exceptions, and there are all the end plate stuff, but after all it's just like that 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:19.480
 For example, I would say that the design was done in bracing 

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:21.050
 I think that is suppressed Parry students I acoustic guitar 

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:25.849
 It is very many, but it is 0 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:26.960
 I think that there is also outside, but thinking about that is true, force is halved a little more 

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:31.699
 There is something to say 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:32.599
 Well, I say that getting used to it with my ears is a bit of a bad thing 

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:37.699
 I think like that 

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:40.580
 Well this Well my child nobody Well I'm entering a little this is true of the acoustic 

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:41.070
 I realized that it was the sound of 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:42.590
 All right 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:47.720
 Various acoustics 

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:51.380
 To say to Okiku' notes but it is I think the kana not a corner I say really 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:54.830
 It is compared Te Once upon a time also of course say evaluation of the electric acoustic guitar 

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:59.570
 Although there is an impression money that it seems to be rising somehow 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:06:02.580
 The thing away against thing called electric acoustic guitar and raw guitar and say true things from the Well 

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:07.379
 I think the there is been lost in such a 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:08.550
 Even in terms of shape , it's about to become an assistant even if you look at the volume 

00:06:07.379 --> 00:06:14.909
 I think but 

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:16.199
 At least I think it would be nice to start off with a live guitar first, not Eleako 

00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:18.950
 There were a lot of parts 

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:21.090
 I like a whether the anti-of Tteyuu raw sound 

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:22.430
 car 

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:28.850
 me 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:33.110
 I as the raw guitar thing I Tsukekata of cats of strength even to give a feeling for example, strength 

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:38.900
 Toka feeling out in front of the clear but also not not kana think why I'm sound 

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:39.530
 I want even in crowded But First sound felt the place such're interested in seeing a fool deca of the volume 

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:42.420
 right 

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:47.460
 Electric acoustic guitar that's in as just Well, I said earlier 

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:51.660
 Even so sound I was bending is there to some things that selfishness surprised of there only crowded human volume 

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:53.040
 I'm also or there to say Kke was Chitchaka' think that sort of a and in indescribably 

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:56.490
 There are some things I can not say 

00:06:53.040 --> 00:07:01.470
 To Well apart from not that Erya Koune first but he is I do not even mean I say 

00:06:56.490 --> 00:07:02.409
 Whether the guitar is not the eel and the encryption is good as long as the one step I among others choices to decorate 

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:06.039
 Naa 

00:07:02.409 --> 00:07:08.469
 It means that I have such an opinion but it is 

00:07:06.039 --> 00:07:09.790
 I hope to see you again next time 

00:07:08.469 --> 00:07:12.870
 1234 

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:13.770
 I I it Zorobai Vine 

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:16.490
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:16.490
 Ah ah ah 

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:24.670

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:27.480
 me 

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:32.830
 ni 

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:37.380
