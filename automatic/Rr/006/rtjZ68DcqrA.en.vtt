00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
move back in on the banks again when the

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.700 
move back in on the banks again when the
weather<00:00:36.329> cools<00:00:36.600> often<00:00:37.110> but<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.320> rest<00:00:37.530> of<00:00:37.649> the

weather cools often but the rest of the

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.350 
weather cools often but the rest of the
year<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:38.370> biggest<00:00:38.579> part<00:00:38.880> of<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:38.969> fish<00:00:39.180> in

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
year the biggest part of the fish in

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.510 
year the biggest part of the fish in
this<00:00:39.510> lake<00:00:39.570> turn<00:00:39.960> on<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.380> banks<00:00:40.770> so<00:00:41.190> people

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
this lake turn on the banks so people

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.130 
this lake turn on the banks so people
have<00:00:41.700> a<00:00:41.730> misconception<00:00:41.969> they<00:00:42.690> come<00:00:42.930> here<00:00:43.050> and

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
have a misconception they come here and

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.660 
have a misconception they come here and
they<00:00:43.230> see<00:00:43.320> a<00:00:43.500> beautiful<00:00:43.949> the<00:00:44.010> timbered<00:00:44.429> bank

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
they see a beautiful the timbered bank

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.369 
they see a beautiful the timbered bank
they<00:00:44.850> think<00:00:45.089> they<00:00:45.210> can<00:00:45.329> catch<00:00:45.480> bass<00:00:45.750> off<00:00:46.019> of<00:00:46.260> it

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
they think they can catch bass off of it

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.349 
they think they can catch bass off of it
and<00:00:46.530> really<00:00:47.070> most<00:00:47.339> of<00:00:47.519> the<00:00:47.640> year<00:00:47.820> you<00:00:47.850> can't<00:00:48.210> do

00:00:48.349 --> 00:00:48.359 
and really most of the year you can't do

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:49.610 
and really most of the year you can't do
that<00:00:48.539> you've<00:00:48.780> got<00:00:48.809> to<00:00:48.960> back<00:00:49.230> out<00:00:49.440> on<00:00:49.589> the

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
that you've got to back out on the

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.680 
that you've got to back out on the
points<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.219> use<00:00:50.399> your<00:00:50.519> electronics<00:00:51.239> find<00:00:51.570> the

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
points and use your electronics find the

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.989 
points and use your electronics find the
bait<00:00:51.870> fish<00:00:52.199> and<00:00:52.469> fish<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.370> techniques<00:00:53.879> that

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:53.999 
bait fish and fish the techniques that

00:00:53.999 --> 00:00:55.549 
bait fish and fish the techniques that
it<00:00:54.210> takes<00:00:54.420> to<00:00:54.600> catch<00:00:54.749> them<00:00:54.960> out<00:00:55.109> in<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.320> deeper

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
it takes to catch them out in the deeper

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.369 
it takes to catch them out in the deeper
water<00:00:55.769> I<00:00:56.280> think<00:00:56.940> that<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.600> hardest<00:00:58.079> part

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
water I think that the hardest part

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.739 
water I think that the hardest part
about<00:00:58.530> fishing<00:00:59.129> these<00:00:59.249> Lakes<00:00:59.309> is<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.359> clarity

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:00.749 
about fishing these Lakes is the clarity

00:01:00.749 --> 00:01:04.040 
about fishing these Lakes is the clarity
of<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.839> water<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.469> clear<00:01:01.739> of<00:01:02.100> water<00:01:02.370> is<00:01:03.050> no

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:04.050 
of the water the clear of water is no

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.470 
of the water the clear of water is no
matter<00:01:04.199> where<00:01:04.470> you're<00:01:04.650> fishing<00:01:05.150> the<00:01:06.150> harder

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:06.480 
matter where you're fishing the harder

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.750 
matter where you're fishing the harder
the<00:01:06.630> fish<00:01:06.780> are<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.110> catch<00:01:07.350> people<00:01:08.340> just<00:01:08.520> have<00:01:08.700> a

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
the fish are to catch people just have a

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.340 
the fish are to catch people just have a
natural<00:01:09.060> tendency<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:09.750> want<00:01:10.050> to<00:01:10.140> fish<00:01:10.320> a

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
natural tendency to want to fish a

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.040 
natural tendency to want to fish a
shoreline<00:01:10.800> and<00:01:11.220> really<00:01:11.909> on<00:01:12.060> these<00:01:12.240> Clearwater

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:13.050 
shoreline and really on these Clearwater

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:15.200 
shoreline and really on these Clearwater
Ozark<00:01:13.560> streams<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:14.159> lot<00:01:14.580> of<00:01:14.670> times<00:01:14.880> you<00:01:15.000> have<00:01:15.180> to

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
Ozark streams a lot of times you have to

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.150 
Ozark streams a lot of times you have to
get<00:01:15.450> away<00:01:15.690> from<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:16.020> back<00:01:16.230> to<00:01:16.410> catch<00:01:16.620> fish<00:01:16.950> and

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:17.160 
get away from the back to catch fish and

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.070 
get away from the back to catch fish and
usually<00:01:17.850> once<00:01:18.030> you<00:01:18.120> find<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.630> depth<00:01:18.840> of<00:01:18.960> the

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
usually once you find the depth of the

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.770 
usually once you find the depth of the
fish<00:01:19.260> are<00:01:19.440> in<00:01:19.640> they'll<00:01:20.640> be<00:01:21.210> in<00:01:21.300> that<00:01:21.450> area

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
fish are in they'll be in that area

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.320 
fish are in they'll be in that area
throughout<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.830> lake<00:01:23.040> you<00:01:23.940> know<00:01:24.030> if<00:01:24.150> they're

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
throughout the lake you know if they're

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.640 
throughout the lake you know if they're
in<00:01:24.450> 30<00:01:24.660> feet<00:01:24.900> of<00:01:25.020> water<00:01:25.170> they're<00:01:25.350> going<00:01:25.470> to<00:01:25.530> be

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
in 30 feet of water they're going to be

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.380 
in 30 feet of water they're going to be
in<00:01:25.740> 30<00:01:25.980> feet<00:01:26.160> of<00:01:26.250> water<00:01:26.430> in<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.880> majority<00:01:27.180> of

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
in 30 feet of water in the majority of

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.150 
in 30 feet of water in the majority of
the<00:01:27.660> late<00:01:27.870> so<00:01:28.260> once<00:01:28.500> they<00:01:28.650> find<00:01:28.890> where<00:01:29.070> they

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:29.160 
the late so once they find where they

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:30.500 
the late so once they find where they
start<00:01:29.400> getting<00:01:29.520> a<00:01:29.670> few<00:01:29.790> bites<00:01:30.030> they<00:01:30.210> can<00:01:30.330> just

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:30.510 
start getting a few bites they can just

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:32.420 
start getting a few bites they can just
repeat<00:01:30.810> that<00:01:30.870> process<00:01:31.230> on<00:01:31.650> different<00:01:32.070> points

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
repeat that process on different points

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.640 
repeat that process on different points
so<00:01:33.150> that<00:01:33.180> kind<00:01:33.480> of<00:01:33.570> makes<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.840> lake<00:01:34.050> fish<00:01:34.620> a

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
so that kind of makes the lake fish a

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:35.960 
so that kind of makes the lake fish a
little<00:01:34.950> smaller<00:01:35.190> for<00:01:35.490> you<00:01:35.520> because<00:01:35.730> you<00:01:35.850> come

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
little smaller for you because you come

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.340 
little smaller for you because you come
out<00:01:36.150> here<00:01:36.180> and<00:01:36.390> you're<00:01:36.510> looking<00:01:36.750> at<00:01:36.870> all<00:01:37.050> this

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
out here and you're looking at all this

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.560 
out here and you're looking at all this
water<00:01:37.590> there's<00:01:37.860> 45,000<00:01:38.760> acres<00:01:38.820> of<00:01:39.180> water<00:01:39.360> out

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
water there's 45,000 acres of water out

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.960 
water there's 45,000 acres of water out
here<00:01:39.890> it's<00:01:40.890> intimidating<00:01:41.250> for<00:01:41.700> a<00:01:41.760> lot<00:01:41.880> of

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
here it's intimidating for a lot of

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.970

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
in that clear water so that's one
