00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.980 

if<00:00:00.179> you<00:00:00.329> look<00:00:00.510> closely<00:00:00.890> you<00:00:01.890> can<00:00:01.920> see<00:00:02.429> that

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:02.990 
if you look closely you can see that

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:07.249 
if you look closely you can see that
we're<00:00:03.990> drawing<00:00:04.460> approximately<00:00:05.460> 18<00:00:06.210> inches<00:00:06.899> of

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
we're drawing approximately 18 inches of

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.749 
we're drawing approximately 18 inches of
vacuum<00:00:07.919> and<00:00:08.550> this<00:00:09.389> is<00:00:09.599> at<00:00:09.780> an<00:00:09.929> idol<00:00:10.519> so<00:00:11.519> what's

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
vacuum and this is at an idol so what's

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.560 
vacuum and this is at an idol so what's
happening<00:00:12.210> is<00:00:12.509> is<00:00:13.139> from<00:00:13.559> the<00:00:13.710> fuel<00:00:14.009> cell<00:00:14.570> over

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
happening is is from the fuel cell over

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.800 
happening is is from the fuel cell over
here<00:00:16.039> the<00:00:17.039> hydrogen<00:00:17.550> oxygen<00:00:17.880> is<00:00:18.210> being<00:00:18.390> drawn

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
here the hydrogen oxygen is being drawn

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.460 
here the hydrogen oxygen is being drawn
directly<00:00:19.410> down<00:00:19.920> line<00:00:20.930> directly<00:00:21.930> because<00:00:22.170> that

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
directly down line directly because that

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.370 
directly down line directly because that
bow<00:00:22.880> right<00:00:23.880> there<00:00:24.180> is<00:00:24.390> closed<00:00:24.750> off<00:00:25.080> because

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
bow right there is closed off because

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.410 
bow right there is closed off because
there's<00:00:25.560> more<00:00:25.740> vacuum<00:00:26.220> this<00:00:26.430> way<00:00:26.730> so<00:00:26.789> this<00:00:27.180> one

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
there's more vacuum this way so this one

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.290 
there's more vacuum this way so this one
closes<00:00:27.890> that<00:00:28.890> one<00:00:29.130> opens<00:00:29.580> and<00:00:29.880> it's<00:00:30.150> being

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
closes that one opens and it's being

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.170 
closes that one opens and it's being
drawn<00:00:30.630> directly<00:00:30.990> into<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:31.590> motor<00:00:32.030> now<00:00:33.030> I'm

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
drawn directly into the motor now I'm

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.639 
drawn directly into the motor now I'm
going<00:00:33.270> to<00:00:33.360> come<00:00:33.480> over<00:00:33.570> here<00:00:33.719> and<00:00:34.079> hit<00:00:34.530> the

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
going to come over here and hit the

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.170 
going to come over here and hit the
accelerator<00:00:34.950> and<00:00:35.489> you'll<00:00:35.610> be<00:00:35.730> able<00:00:35.820> to<00:00:35.940> see

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
accelerator and you'll be able to see

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.310 
accelerator and you'll be able to see
this<00:00:36.440> down<00:00:37.440> here<00:00:38.210> change<00:00:39.210> ok<00:00:39.870> it<00:00:40.079> will<00:00:40.200> be

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
this down here change ok it will be

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.690 
this down here change ok it will be
upside<00:00:40.710> down<00:00:41.010> but<00:00:41.250> you'll<00:00:41.340> be<00:00:41.430> able<00:00:41.520> to<00:00:41.610> watch

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
upside down but you'll be able to watch

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:48.840 
upside down but you'll be able to watch
the<00:00:42.030> needle<00:00:42.149> move

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:48.850 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.349 

I'm<00:00:49.780> over<00:00:50.019> here<00:00:50.170> at<00:00:50.260> the<00:00:50.350> throttle<00:00:50.620> now<00:00:51.359> now

00:00:52.349 --> 00:00:52.359 
I'm over here at the throttle now now

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:59.180 
I'm over here at the throttle now now
you<00:00:52.420> see<00:00:52.809> i'll<00:00:52.930> run<00:00:53.199> it<00:00:55.860> no<00:00:56.860> hesitation<00:00:57.129> no

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
you see i'll run it no hesitation no

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.579 
you see i'll run it no hesitation no
hesitation<00:01:00.190> at<00:01:00.219> all<00:01:00.629> now<00:01:01.629> we'll<00:01:01.870> go<00:01:01.960> over<00:01:01.989> and

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:02.589 
hesitation at all now we'll go over and

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:05.070 
hesitation at all now we'll go over and
we'll<00:01:02.800> look<00:01:02.980> at<00:01:03.129> that<00:01:03.190> gauge<00:01:03.629> it's<00:01:04.629> upside

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080 
we'll look at that gauge it's upside

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.289 
we'll look at that gauge it's upside
down<00:01:05.110> let's<00:01:05.950> see<00:01:06.100> we<00:01:06.250> can<00:01:06.369> turn<00:01:06.580> it<00:01:06.729> around<00:01:06.790> for

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:07.299 
down let's see we can turn it around for

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:10.149 
down let's see we can turn it around for
you

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:13.419 

well<00:01:10.670> that's<00:01:10.880> a<00:01:10.999> little<00:01:11.149> better<00:01:12.039> you<00:01:13.039> can<00:01:13.219> see

00:01:13.419 --> 00:01:13.429 
well that's a little better you can see

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:18.240 
well that's a little better you can see
it's<00:01:13.549> a<00:01:13.670> 22<00:01:14.119> now<00:01:15.079> normally<00:01:15.380> if<00:01:15.979> I<00:01:16.219> did<00:01:16.490> not<00:01:16.729> have

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
it's a 22 now normally if I did not have

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.690 
it's a 22 now normally if I did not have
this<00:01:19.250> setup<00:01:19.670> right<00:01:20.630> here<00:01:21.009> with<00:01:22.009> this<00:01:22.189> second

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
plenum box when I accelerated this would

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.940 
plenum box when I accelerated this would
drop<00:01:29.959> down<00:01:30.349> from<00:01:30.859> 0<00:01:31.240> where<00:01:32.240> it's<00:01:32.390> at<00:01:32.630> now

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
drop down from 0 where it's at now

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.770 
drop down from 0 where it's at now
somewhere<00:01:33.950> in<00:01:34.009> the<00:01:34.099> neighborhood<00:01:34.579> of<00:01:34.750> 20<00:01:35.750> or

somewhere in the neighborhood of 20 or

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.910 
somewhere in the neighborhood of 20 or
17<00:01:36.500> inches<00:01:37.179> when<00:01:38.179> i<00:01:38.209> accelerate<00:01:38.659> it<00:01:39.619> would<00:01:39.770> go

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
17 inches when i accelerate it would go

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.679 
17 inches when i accelerate it would go
all<00:01:40.069> the<00:01:40.159> way<00:01:40.219> down<00:01:40.429> to<00:01:40.459> seven<00:01:41.090> but<00:01:41.270> watch<00:01:41.479> it

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:41.689 
all the way down to seven but watch it

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:49.059 
all the way down to seven but watch it
now<00:01:46.209> and<00:01:47.209> you'll<00:01:47.509> seeing<00:01:47.869> it<00:01:48.110> no<00:01:48.289> longer<00:01:48.530> drops

00:01:49.059 --> 00:01:49.069 
now and you'll seeing it no longer drops

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:51.279 
now and you'll seeing it no longer drops
down<00:01:49.280> to<00:01:49.340> seven<00:01:49.819> inches<00:01:49.939> because<00:01:50.840> what's

00:01:51.279 --> 00:01:51.289 
down to seven inches because what's

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:53.889 
down to seven inches because what's
happening<00:01:51.379> as<00:01:52.009> I'm<00:01:52.879> calling<00:01:53.360> for<00:01:53.569> the<00:01:53.599> fuel

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:53.899 
happening as I'm calling for the fuel

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:56.770 
happening as I'm calling for the fuel
this<00:01:54.439> way<00:01:54.739> when<00:01:55.640> I<00:01:55.670> hit<00:01:55.909> the<00:01:56.060> throttle<00:01:56.329> it's

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
this way when I hit the throttle it's

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.100 
this way when I hit the throttle it's
now<00:01:57.020> calling<00:01:57.530> for<00:01:57.560> the<00:01:57.770> fuel<00:01:58.009> to<00:01:58.250> go<00:01:58.369> this<00:01:58.700> way

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
now calling for the fuel to go this way

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.469 
now calling for the fuel to go this way
so<00:02:00.110> in<00:02:00.259> other<00:02:00.349> words<00:02:00.619> it's<00:02:00.890> a<00:02:00.979> 2-way<00:02:01.399> set<00:02:01.759> up<00:02:01.909> at

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
so in other words it's a 2-way set up at

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:08.650 
so in other words it's a 2-way set up at
an<00:02:02.810> idle<00:02:03.729> at<00:02:04.729> cruising<00:02:05.509> and<00:02:06.340> deceleration<00:02:07.660> the

plenum when I'm accelerating needing to
use<00:02:16.609> fuel<00:02:17.090> and<00:02:17.450> the<00:02:18.260> vacuum<00:02:18.470> here<00:02:18.980> drops<00:02:19.370> down

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
use fuel and the vacuum here drops down

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.289 
use fuel and the vacuum here drops down
now<00:02:20.620> that<00:02:21.620> vacuum<00:02:22.099> doesn't<00:02:22.310> drop<00:02:22.760> down<00:02:23.030> it

00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:23.299 
now that vacuum doesn't drop down it

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:25.330 
now that vacuum doesn't drop down it
just<00:02:23.329> closes<00:02:23.840> off<00:02:24.230> and<00:02:24.560> the<00:02:24.650> vacuum<00:02:25.069> is<00:02:25.130> then

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
just closes off and the vacuum is then

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.720 
just closes off and the vacuum is then
pulled<00:02:25.639> this<00:02:25.880> way<00:02:26.230> from<00:02:27.230> out<00:02:27.410> of<00:02:27.590> here<00:02:27.919> out<00:02:28.099> of

these two this one
and<00:02:31.290> that<00:02:31.590> one<00:02:31.830> those<00:02:32.160> two<00:02:32.430> air<00:02:32.640> horns<00:02:33.090> they

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
and that one those two air horns they

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.479 
and that one those two air horns they
drop<00:02:33.569> in<00:02:33.810> creates<00:02:34.319> a<00:02:34.470> venturi<00:02:34.920> as<00:02:35.130> the<00:02:35.310> air

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
drop in creates a venturi as the air

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:40.280 
drop in creates a venturi as the air
goes<00:02:35.520> past<00:02:37.099> into<00:02:38.099> the<00:02:38.130> motor<00:02:38.400> and<00:02:38.870> then<00:02:39.870> into

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
goes past into the motor and then into

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.920 
goes past into the motor and then into
the<00:02:40.380> engines<00:02:40.680> so<00:02:40.920> we're<00:02:41.099> actually<00:02:41.310> getting

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
the engines so we're actually getting

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:48.130 
the engines so we're actually getting
our<00:02:42.930> hydrogen<00:02:43.410> fuel<00:02:43.830> now<00:02:44.250> at<00:02:44.700> an<00:02:45.660> idle

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.160 

deceleration<00:02:49.140> and<00:02:49.760> cruising<00:02:50.760> speed<00:02:51.090> and<00:02:51.390> now

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
deceleration and cruising speed and now

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.220 
deceleration and cruising speed and now
we<00:02:52.230> get<00:02:52.560> it<00:02:52.709> at<00:02:52.890> acceleration<00:02:53.700> speed<00:02:54.080> it's<00:02:55.080> a

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
we get it at acceleration speed it's a

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.550 
we get it at acceleration speed it's a
very<00:02:55.440> simple<00:02:55.709> process<00:02:56.690> the<00:02:57.690> cell<00:02:57.989> actually

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
very simple process the cell actually

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.520 
very simple process the cell actually
runs<00:02:58.860> on<00:02:59.190> one<00:02:59.430> and<00:02:59.610> a<00:02:59.670> half<00:02:59.700> volts<00:03:00.260> so<00:03:01.260> once

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
runs on one and a half volts so once

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.880 
runs on one and a half volts so once
it's<00:03:01.739> charged<00:03:02.160> you<00:03:02.880> can<00:03:03.090> disconnect<00:03:03.890> that

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
it's charged you can disconnect that

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.880 
it's charged you can disconnect that
positive<00:03:05.550> wire<00:03:05.760> or<00:03:06.030> flip<00:03:06.390> a<00:03:06.420> switch<00:03:06.660> and<00:03:07.050> the

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
positive wire or flip a switch and the

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.250 
positive wire or flip a switch and the
cell<00:03:08.160> itself<00:03:08.400> will<00:03:09.030> remain<00:03:09.390> and<00:03:09.720> hold<00:03:09.989> and

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
cell itself will remain and hold and

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:15.410 
cell itself will remain and hold and
maintain<00:03:10.410> a<00:03:11.090> 1.4<00:03:12.090> 2<00:03:12.930> 15<00:03:13.500> volt<00:03:13.860> charge<00:03:14.420> meaning

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
maintain a 1.4 2 15 volt charge meaning

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:16.580 
maintain a 1.4 2 15 volt charge meaning
it<00:03:15.510> doesn't<00:03:15.540> need<00:03:15.989> to<00:03:16.049> be<00:03:16.170> hooked<00:03:16.380> into

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
it doesn't need to be hooked into

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.559 
it doesn't need to be hooked into
battery<00:03:16.980> all<00:03:17.190> the<00:03:17.340> time<00:03:17.580> so<00:03:17.910> you<00:03:17.970> can<00:03:18.120> put<00:03:18.450> an

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:18.569 
battery all the time so you can put an

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:21.380 
battery all the time so you can put an
on/off<00:03:18.930> switch<00:03:19.350> on<00:03:19.620> there<00:03:20.280> or<00:03:20.489> under<00:03:21.269> your

on/off switch on there or under your

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.229 
on/off switch on there or under your
dashboard<00:03:21.989> so<00:03:22.860> in<00:03:23.100> the<00:03:23.190> morning<00:03:23.610> you<00:03:23.819> turn<00:03:24.060> it

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
dashboard so in the morning you turn it

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.240 
dashboard so in the morning you turn it
on<00:03:24.330> for<00:03:24.600> about<00:03:24.660> 30<00:03:25.080> seconds<00:03:25.620> hit<00:03:25.920> it<00:03:26.040> with<00:03:26.220> a

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
on for about 30 seconds hit it with a

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.000 
on for about 30 seconds hit it with a
charge<00:03:26.660> start<00:03:27.660> your<00:03:27.840> truck<00:03:28.110> up<00:03:28.319> and<00:03:28.530> then<00:03:28.739> turn

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
charge start your truck up and then turn

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.400 
charge start your truck up and then turn
it<00:03:29.040> off<00:03:29.280> and<00:03:29.459> it'll<00:03:29.760> continue<00:03:30.120> to<00:03:30.420> run<00:03:30.600> all

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
it off and it'll continue to run all

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.580 
it off and it'll continue to run all
thats<00:03:31.920> for<00:03:32.280> is<00:03:32.610> if<00:03:32.790> the<00:03:32.940> cell<00:03:33.269> drops<00:03:33.780> down<00:03:34.140> and

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
thats for is if the cell drops down and

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.030 
thats for is if the cell drops down and
loses<00:03:35.220> its<00:03:35.400> charge<00:03:35.820> like<00:03:36.329> a<00:03:36.359> dead<00:03:36.630> battery<00:03:37.040> you

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
loses its charge like a dead battery you

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.430 
loses its charge like a dead battery you
have<00:03:38.250> a<00:03:38.280> way<00:03:38.489> to<00:03:38.549> recharge<00:03:39.090> it<00:03:39.329> quickly<00:03:39.630> so<00:03:40.410> you

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
have a way to recharge it quickly so you

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.699 
have a way to recharge it quickly so you
can<00:03:40.590> be<00:03:40.829> underway<00:03:41.250> and<00:03:41.549> go<00:03:41.760> on<00:03:41.850> down<00:03:42.060> the<00:03:42.209> road

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
can be underway and go on down the road

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:45.440 
can be underway and go on down the road
anyway<00:03:43.709> that's<00:03:44.040> the<00:03:44.190> cell<00:03:44.579> that's<00:03:45.090> what<00:03:45.359> it

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
anyway that's the cell that's what it

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.400 
anyway that's the cell that's what it
looks<00:03:45.690> like<00:03:46.820> it's<00:03:47.820> made<00:03:48.060> of<00:03:48.120> PVC<00:03:48.450> half-inch

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
looks like it's made of PVC half-inch

you can see for yourself and as the

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:13.250 
you can see for yourself and as the
engine<00:04:09.120> runs<00:04:09.650> you<00:04:10.650> look<00:04:10.829> here<00:04:11.100> you<00:04:11.430> can<00:04:11.640> see

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
engine runs you look here you can see

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:18.800 
engine runs you look here you can see
the<00:04:13.769> actual<00:04:14.129> vacuum<00:04:15.829> has<00:04:17.209> actually<00:04:18.209> moved<00:04:18.510> up

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
the actual vacuum has actually moved up

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.610 
the actual vacuum has actually moved up
to<00:04:19.049> 18<00:04:19.680> inches<00:04:20.120> of<00:04:21.120> that<00:04:21.299> gun<00:04:21.540> from<00:04:21.720> 17<00:04:22.320> as<00:04:22.470> it

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
to 18 inches of that gun from 17 as it

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:27.830 
to 18 inches of that gun from 17 as it
runs<00:04:22.830> and<00:04:23.669> this<00:04:23.880> engine<00:04:24.300> has<00:04:24.919> 170<00:04:26.600> 4700<00:04:27.600> plus

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
runs and this engine has 170 4700 plus

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:36.379 
runs and this engine has 170 4700 plus
miles<00:04:28.199> and<00:04:28.620> it<00:04:29.280> runs<00:04:29.460> beautifully<00:04:35.210> so<00:04:36.210> we're

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:36.389 
miles and it runs beautifully so we're

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:39.020 
miles and it runs beautifully so we're
using<00:04:36.660> old<00:04:37.139> technology<00:04:37.460> with<00:04:38.460> a<00:04:38.490> newfangled

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
using old technology with a newfangled

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:43.520 
using old technology with a newfangled
idea<00:04:39.660> and<00:04:40.050> it<00:04:40.889> definitely<00:04:41.190> works<00:04:42.169> i'll<00:04:43.169> post

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
idea and it definitely works i'll post

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:46.189 
idea and it definitely works i'll post
