00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
magic but apparently all that she's not

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.039

magical<00:02:03.409> at<00:02:03.500> all<00:02:03.680> I<00:02:04.149> mean<00:02:05.149> how<00:02:05.479> could<00:02:05.659> she<00:02:05.719> be

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:06.049 
magical at all I mean how could she be

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:08.130 
magical at all I mean how could she be
magical<00:02:06.590> of<00:02:06.710> all<00:02:06.829> the<00:02:07.040> magics<00:02:07.430> in<00:02:07.490> the<00:02:07.640> stick

magical of all the magics in the stick

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.660 
magical of all the magics in the stick
