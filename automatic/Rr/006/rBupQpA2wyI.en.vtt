so<00:02:27.730> often<00:02:27.910> there'll<00:02:28.150> be<00:02:28.180> a<00:02:28.239> recipe<00:02:28.630> that<00:02:28.900> means

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
so often there'll be a recipe that means

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.020 
so often there'll be a recipe that means
it<00:02:29.260> but<00:02:29.500> anyway<00:02:30.010> this<00:02:30.250> is<00:02:30.310> a<00:02:30.430> good<00:02:30.640> cheap<00:02:30.850> way

to<00:03:47.410> wait<00:03:47.560> until<00:03:47.710> the<00:03:47.950> fat<00:03:48.130> chunks<00:03:48.520> start<00:03:48.790> to

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
to wait until the fat chunks start to

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.300 
to wait until the fat chunks start to
sink<00:03:49.300> in<00:03:50.140> which<00:03:50.380> they're<00:03:50.590> starting<00:03:50.950> to<00:03:50.980> do<00:03:51.130> now

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:36.850 
see all the steps last night that I went
through<00:06:34.670> I<00:06:35.030> took<00:06:35.900> the<00:06:36.020> one<00:06:36.200> out<00:06:36.410> of<00:06:36.440> the<00:06:36.620> jar

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:36.860 
through I took the one out of the jar

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:38.380 
through I took the one out of the jar
and<00:06:37.430> put<00:06:37.610> it<00:06:37.730> into<00:06:37.910> one<00:06:38.030> of<00:06:38.120> these<00:06:38.180> containers

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:38.390 
and put it into one of these containers

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:40.060 
and put it into one of these containers
and<00:06:38.870> Alisa<00:06:39.080> had<00:06:39.290> told<00:06:39.440> me<00:06:39.560> to<00:06:39.590> do<00:06:39.740> that<00:06:39.770> because

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:40.070 
and Alisa had told me to do that because

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:41.860 
and Alisa had told me to do that because
this<00:06:40.400> is<00:06:40.550> a<00:06:40.580> lot<00:06:40.760> easier<00:06:40.790> for<00:06:41.360> her<00:06:41.450> to<00:06:41.480> get<00:06:41.690> at

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:41.870 
this is a lot easier for her to get at

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:44.110 
this is a lot easier for her to get at
to<00:06:42.050> use<00:06:42.310> when<00:06:43.310> this<00:06:43.430> cools<00:06:43.700> down<00:06:43.790> it

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:44.120 
to use when this cools down it

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:46.180 
to use when this cools down it
automatically<00:06:44.570> seals<00:06:45.020> itself<00:06:45.380> so<00:06:45.800> this<00:06:45.980> can

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:46.190 
automatically seals itself so this can

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:48.340 
automatically seals itself so this can
sit<00:06:46.430> on<00:06:46.460> the<00:06:46.670> shelf<00:06:46.910> or<00:06:47.090> anything<00:06:47.330> and<00:06:48.170> this

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:48.350 
sit on the shelf or anything and this

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:50.710 
sit on the shelf or anything and this
one<00:06:48.530> here<00:06:48.710> is<00:06:48.800> easier<00:06:49.100> to<00:06:49.220> use<00:06:49.390> you<00:06:50.390> can<00:06:50.540> see

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:50.720 
one here is easier to use you can see

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:52.450 
one here is easier to use you can see
