00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
telling me like what's up a fire I've

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.299 
telling me like what's up a fire I've
been<00:00:12.719> slacking<00:00:13.110> other<00:00:13.500> protein<00:00:13.860> treatments

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
been slacking other protein treatments

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.670 
been slacking other protein treatments
because<00:00:14.870> micropower<00:00:15.870> was<00:00:16.080> attributed<00:00:16.650> to

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
because micropower was attributed to

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.550 
because micropower was attributed to
small<00:00:17.100> yes<00:00:17.760> because<00:00:18.090> I<00:00:18.240> bagged<00:00:18.960> my<00:00:19.170> coaching

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
small yes because I bagged my coaching

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.830 
small yes because I bagged my coaching
treatments<00:00:20.010> with<00:00:20.189> heat<00:00:20.460> under<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.210> dryer<00:00:21.510> so

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
treatments with heat under the dryer so

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.019 
treatments with heat under the dryer so
my<00:00:22.410> curls<00:00:22.710> were<00:00:23.010> you<00:00:23.279> know<00:00:23.430> a<00:00:23.460> little<00:00:23.850> too

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
tight so yes that's how you shrink your

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.679

thoughts<00:00:26.640> I<00:00:26.760> have<00:00:26.910> a<00:00:26.939> shrink<00:00:27.269> your<00:00:27.390> curls

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
thoughts I have a shrink your curls

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.259 
thoughts I have a shrink your curls
video<00:00:28.080> in<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:29.070> you<00:00:29.609> don't<00:00:29.789> have<00:00:29.880> to<00:00:29.939> find<00:00:30.119> that

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
video in the you don't have to find that

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.120 
video in the you don't have to find that
in<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.480> description<00:00:30.599> box<00:00:30.990> okay<00:00:31.199> so<00:00:31.349> my<00:00:31.890> calls

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
in the description box okay so my calls

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.950 
in the description box okay so my calls
are<00:00:32.250> going<00:00:32.369> to<00:00:32.610> tight<00:00:32.880> and<00:00:33.210> i<00:00:33.300> was<00:00:33.420> like<00:00:33.540> no<00:00:33.719> i'm

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
are going to tight and i was like no i'm

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.620 
are going to tight and i was like no i'm
not<00:00:34.170> feeling<00:00:34.559> they're<00:00:34.710> so<00:00:35.059> basically<00:00:36.059> i<00:00:36.090> could

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
not feeling they're so basically i could

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.330 
not feeling they're so basically i could
just<00:00:36.840> slack<00:00:37.290> off<00:00:37.320> all<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:37.980> protein

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
just slack off all the protein

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.920 
just slack off all the protein
treatments<00:00:38.760> and<00:00:38.879> it<00:00:38.940> was<00:00:39.059> doing<00:00:39.300> well<00:00:39.510> for<00:00:39.809> me

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
treatments and it was doing well for me

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.600 
treatments and it was doing well for me
I<00:00:39.960> curl<00:00:40.320> pattern<00:00:40.680> is<00:00:40.829> getting<00:00:41.129> a<00:00:41.190> little<00:00:41.340> bit

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
I curl pattern is getting a little bit

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.030 
I curl pattern is getting a little bit
smaller<00:00:42.000> than<00:00:42.180> it<00:00:42.480> naturally<00:00:43.050> is<00:00:43.260> so<00:00:43.620> I<00:00:43.649> can

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
smaller than it naturally is so I can

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.400 
smaller than it naturally is so I can
just<00:00:44.190> relax<00:00:44.579> but<00:00:44.969> I<00:00:45.059> can't<00:00:45.120> relax<00:00:45.690> too<00:00:46.140> long

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
just relax but I can't relax too long

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.119 
just relax but I can't relax too long
because<00:00:46.770> then<00:00:47.219> I<00:00:47.520> start<00:00:47.850> getting<00:00:48.090> like<00:00:48.510> this

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:49.129 
because then I start getting like this

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:51.380 
because then I start getting like this
unsavory<00:00:50.129> appearance<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:50.730> my<00:00:50.850> hair<00:00:51.030> that<00:00:51.059> only

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
unsavory appearance to my hair that only

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.510 
unsavory appearance to my hair that only
I<00:00:51.539> can<00:00:51.690> notice<00:00:52.199> but<00:00:52.410> if<00:00:52.800> I<00:00:52.920> let<00:00:53.100> it<00:00:53.219> go<00:00:53.309> too<00:00:53.370> long

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
I can notice but if I let it go too long

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.819 
I can notice but if I let it go too long
that<00:00:53.940> everybody<00:00:54.300> can<00:00:54.480> notice<00:00:54.719> it<00:00:54.809> I'm<00:00:55.289> walking

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
that everybody can notice it I'm walking

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.439 
that everybody can notice it I'm walking
your<00:00:55.920> protein<00:00:56.250> up<00:00:56.370> inside<00:00:56.640> relationship<00:00:57.329> as

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
your protein up inside relationship as

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.000 
your protein up inside relationship as
what<00:00:57.629> is<00:00:57.750> it<00:00:57.899> my<00:00:58.079> hair<00:00:58.109> gets<00:00:58.620> like<00:00:58.859> this

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
what is it my hair gets like this

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.130 
what is it my hair gets like this
feathery<00:00:59.520> appearance<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.359> it<00:01:00.390> I<00:01:00.750> don't<00:01:00.989> think

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
feathery appearance to it I don't think

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.049 
feathery appearance to it I don't think
you<00:01:01.230> can<00:01:01.379> detect<00:01:01.739> it<00:01:01.949> so<00:01:02.129> well<00:01:02.340> here<00:01:02.609> it's<00:01:02.820> not

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
you can detect it so well here it's not

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.640 
you can detect it so well here it's not
detectable<00:01:03.690> because<00:01:03.960> of<00:01:04.049> how<00:01:04.140> I<00:01:04.170> swapped<00:01:04.500> out

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
detectable because of how I swapped out

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.490 
detectable because of how I swapped out
my<00:01:04.710> hair<00:01:05.010> but<00:01:05.250> obviously<00:01:06.150> it<00:01:06.780> will<00:01:07.080> get<00:01:07.290> like

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
my hair but obviously it will get like

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.230 
my hair but obviously it will get like
this<00:01:07.650> feathering<00:01:08.250> kind<00:01:08.549> of<00:01:08.700> finish

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
this feathering kind of finish

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.840 
this feathering kind of finish
appearance<00:01:09.780> like<00:01:09.960> thin<00:01:10.320> like<00:01:10.799> sitters<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:11.640> I

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
appearance like thin like sitters and I

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.760 
appearance like thin like sitters and I
don't<00:01:12.060> like<00:01:12.270> thinners<00:01:12.780> okay<00:01:13.290> like<00:01:13.500> I<00:01:13.680> don't

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770

just like oh I have to do another

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.120 
just like oh I have to do another
protein<00:01:21.689> trade<00:01:21.990> back<00:01:22.229> it's<00:01:22.680> not<00:01:22.830> that<00:01:22.890> big

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
protein trade back it's not that big

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.320 
protein trade back it's not that big
with<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.340> Oba<00:01:23.580> enhance<00:01:23.880> because<00:01:24.180> now<00:01:24.299> I
