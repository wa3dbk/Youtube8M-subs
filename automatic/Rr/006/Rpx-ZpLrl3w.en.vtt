00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:06.839
 potatoes and you that I removed 10 August 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.509
 I began to clean potatoes on a bed of one 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.160
 a day well, as I said potatoes 

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:13.980
 removed 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:16.260
 immediately bend compost right away first 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:20.369
 by sowing rye then introduced compost and here 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:23.760
 so the beds will remain until spring means 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.920
 why am I so choose so early potatoes 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.080
 because i don't like when he 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.179
 begins to rot phytophthora comes somewhere 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.300
 in the second decade of August 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.550
 don't escape potatoes start to rot 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:38.910
 so I collect it until 15 became what 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.830
 started cleaning as 10 said that these ridges 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.370
 already and will remain so 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:46.580
 suspended rye will grow as much as she 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:50.100
 the task of this rye can grow 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:52.410
 loosen the soil I once said that 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.500
 one plant rye process its 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:58.110
 vegetation gives a root length of about 6000 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.030
 kilometers six thousand kilometers and their 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:02.100
 here are a lot of these plants you can imagine 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.949
 Imagine how the explosion will be Lena soil 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.560
 roots after these roots are eaten 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.020
 active elements i mean i practically 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.570
 no need to plow do not dig it will 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.450
 loose which is very important in loose soil 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.580
 comes besides that well 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.100
 precipitation goes there penetrates the most 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.720
 the main thing is the air from which 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.750
 plants take as we spoke 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.960
 over 95 percent of batteries 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.820
 only five on average from soil 95 of 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.780
 air it is necessary that this air was and in 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.730
 roots and in ridges and in the soil like this 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.570
 looks like a kitchen garden after picking 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:41.909
 harvest potatoes potatoes with these gry 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.650
 me exactly weaving potatoes 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.020
 year forty-two buckets collected 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:49.740
 that is, about three hundred and fifty 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:52.130
 a kilogram of potatoes a day is very important 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.409
 plant potatoes separately 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:58.210
 a separate bed a separate row 1 shorts 2 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:02.320
 3 if we plant 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:04.360
 here are 2 tubers next to different potatoes 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.490
 they begin to oppress each other either 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.530
 one nest pusta or in the other lower 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.950
 mail either in both nests empty one 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.430
 small change 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:14.739
 that is, the potato does not like the neighborhood 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:17.700
 different breeds need to separate varieties by 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:17.700
 Ridge moby for till on
