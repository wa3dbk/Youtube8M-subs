couple<00:02:21.650> extra<00:02:22.060> cards<00:02:23.060> on<00:02:23.180> each<00:02:23.330> side<00:02:23.690> and<00:02:24.160> then

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
couple extra cards on each side and then

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.970 
couple extra cards on each side and then
I<00:02:25.190> put<00:02:25.490> my<00:02:27.400> my<00:02:28.400> wood<00:02:28.640> on<00:02:29.090> the<00:02:29.390> front<00:02:29.660> the<00:02:29.780> back

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
I put my my wood on the front the back

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.780 
I put my my wood on the front the back
like<00:02:30.980> so<00:02:32.740> line<00:02:33.740> it<00:02:33.890> up<00:02:34.010> basically<00:02:34.490> and<00:02:34.760> then

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
like so line it up basically and then

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.640 
like so line it up basically and then
all<00:02:34.970> you'd<00:02:35.120> like<00:02:35.270> to<00:02:35.360> use<00:02:35.450> a<00:02:35.480> table<00:02:35.900> and<00:02:36.500> get

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
all you'd like to use a table and get

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.500 
all you'd like to use a table and get
them<00:02:36.800> perfectly<00:02:37.220> you<00:02:37.820> know<00:02:37.940> get<00:02:38.270> them<00:02:38.390> nice

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
them perfectly you know get them nice

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.100 
them perfectly you know get them nice
and<00:02:38.570> square<00:02:39.080> but<00:02:39.920> just<00:02:40.280> to<00:02:40.370> give<00:02:40.400> you<00:02:40.580> the<00:02:40.700> gist

and square but just to give you the gist

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:49.600 
and square but just to give you the gist
and<00:02:42.110> then<00:02:42.830> all<00:02:43.400> i<00:02:43.430> do<00:02:43.580> is<00:02:45.250> is<00:02:46.250> basically<00:02:48.610> you

and then all i do is is basically you
know<00:02:50.980> trying<00:02:51.980> to<00:02:52.040> get<00:02:52.190> us<00:02:52.280> someone<00:02:52.610> straight

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.500 

go<00:02:57.960> accel<00:02:58.530> give<00:02:59.430> it<00:02:59.550> a<00:02:59.580> quick<00:02:59.700> clamp<00:03:00.060> now<00:03:00.300> that

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
go accel give it a quick clamp now that

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.960 
go accel give it a quick clamp now that
baby<00:03:00.690> is<00:03:00.840> not<00:03:00.990> going<00:03:01.170> anywhere<00:03:01.730> and<00:03:02.730> basically

baby is not going anywhere and basically
I<00:03:03.270> mean<00:03:03.630> I<00:03:03.660> just<00:03:03.720> did<00:03:03.960> a<00:03:03.990> real<00:03:04.200> fast<00:03:04.410> in<00:03:04.530> the

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
I mean I just did a real fast in the

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:05.990 
I mean I just did a real fast in the
auto<00:03:04.740> I<00:03:04.830> would<00:03:05.130> normally<00:03:05.400> take<00:03:05.520> my<00:03:05.670> time<00:03:05.820> you

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
auto I would normally take my time you

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.700 
auto I would normally take my time you
get<00:03:06.150> it<00:03:06.240> a<00:03:06.300> lot<00:03:06.390> more<00:03:06.600> strength<00:03:06.900> but<00:03:07.080> this<00:03:07.560> is

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:07.710 
get it a lot more strength but this is

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:10.700 
get it a lot more strength but this is
just<00:03:07.740> to<00:03:07.950> kind<00:03:08.160> of<00:03:08.190> show<00:03:08.430> you<00:03:08.460> and<00:03:08.820> then<00:03:09.710> it

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:10.710 
just to kind of show you and then it

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:12.290 
just to kind of show you and then it
holds<00:03:10.980> it<00:03:11.070> squeezes<00:03:11.580> them<00:03:11.670> very<00:03:11.940> very<00:03:12.030> tight

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
holds it squeezes them very very tight

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.480 
holds it squeezes them very very tight
together<00:03:12.680> and<00:03:13.680> then<00:03:13.860> you<00:03:13.980> just<00:03:14.160> take<00:03:14.400> your

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:14.490 
together and then you just take your

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:16.340 
together and then you just take your
sharpie<00:03:14.910> and<00:03:14.940> you<00:03:15.510> know<00:03:15.600> you<00:03:15.660> can<00:03:15.750> go<00:03:15.990> over<00:03:16.020> a

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
sharpie and you know you can go over a

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:17.630 
sharpie and you know you can go over a
little<00:03:16.440> bit<00:03:16.650> on<00:03:16.800> each<00:03:16.830> side<00:03:17.190> because<00:03:17.520> you're

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
little bit on each side because you're

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.060 
little bit on each side because you're
going<00:03:17.760> to<00:03:17.850> have<00:03:17.940> those<00:03:18.120> extra<00:03:18.300> cards<00:03:18.840> and<00:03:19.710> then

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
going to have those extra cards and then

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:23.000 
going to have those extra cards and then
you<00:03:20.310> can<00:03:20.460> you<00:03:20.880> can<00:03:21.060> actually<00:03:21.240> reach<00:03:21.780> all<00:03:22.080> four

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
you can you can actually reach all four

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.910 
you can you can actually reach all four
sides<00:03:23.280> I<00:03:23.610> would<00:03:24.450> just<00:03:24.930> back<00:03:25.110> that<00:03:25.170> up<00:03:25.410> but<00:03:25.770> if

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
sides I would just back that up but if

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.220 
sides I would just back that up but if
if<00:03:26.610> you<00:03:26.970> have<00:03:27.120> one<00:03:27.360> of<00:03:27.480> these<00:03:27.600> or<00:03:27.900> you<00:03:27.990> can<00:03:28.110> pick

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
if you have one of these or you can pick

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:29.690 
if you have one of these or you can pick
up<00:03:28.410> one<00:03:28.560> of<00:03:28.590> these<00:03:28.710> are<00:03:28.890> about<00:03:29.070> 10<00:03:29.310> bucks<00:03:29.490> i

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
up one of these are about 10 bucks i

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.760 
up one of these are about 10 bucks i
guess<00:03:29.910> for<00:03:30.150> this<00:03:30.360> quick<00:03:30.660> grip<00:03:30.930> and<00:03:31.200> then<00:03:31.680> you

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:31.770 
guess for this quick grip and then you

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:33.230 
guess for this quick grip and then you
just<00:03:31.920> get<00:03:32.100> a<00:03:32.130> couple<00:03:32.370> pieces<00:03:32.610> of<00:03:32.760> wood<00:03:32.970> this

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:33.240 
just get a couple pieces of wood this

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:36.770 
just get a couple pieces of wood this
happens<00:03:33.570> to<00:03:33.600> be<00:03:33.690> wood<00:03:33.960> flooring<00:03:34.970> that<00:03:35.970> I<00:03:36.030> just

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
happens to be wood flooring that I just

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.550 
happens to be wood flooring that I just
cut<00:03:37.020> into<00:03:37.260> smaller<00:03:37.560> pieces<00:03:37.830> but<00:03:39.380> that's<00:03:40.380> all

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
cut into smaller pieces but that's all

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.140 
cut into smaller pieces but that's all
you<00:03:40.680> do<00:03:40.830> and<00:03:41.010> then<00:03:41.250> you<00:03:41.280> just<00:03:41.700> paint<00:03:42.000> it<00:03:42.030> up

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
you do and then you just paint it up

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.020 
you do and then you just paint it up
with<00:03:42.270> your<00:03:42.360> sharpie<00:03:42.810> and<00:03:42.840> and<00:03:43.820> then<00:03:44.820> you<00:03:44.910> can

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
with your sharpie and and then you can

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.630 
with your sharpie and and then you can
just<00:03:45.180> leave<00:03:45.390> it<00:03:45.510> in<00:03:45.600> the<00:03:45.720> clamp<00:03:46.220> for<00:03:47.220> it<00:03:47.280> to<00:03:47.370> dry

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
just leave it in the clamp for it to dry

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
just leave it in the clamp for it to dry
and<00:03:48.890> set<00:03:49.890> it<00:03:49.980> aside<00:03:50.100> and<00:03:50.490> there<00:03:50.640> you<00:03:50.760> go<00:03:50.910> and

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
and set it aside and there you go and

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.140 
and set it aside and there you go and
but<00:03:52.200> just<00:03:52.950> do<00:03:53.070> it<00:03:53.160> with<00:03:53.280> the<00:03:53.370> black<00:03:53.640> decks<00:03:53.970> do

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
but just do it with the black decks do

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.130 
but just do it with the black decks do
not<00:03:54.300> try<00:03:54.510> it<00:03:54.540> with<00:03:54.750> the<00:03:54.780> white<00:03:54.960> deck<00:03:56.210> so<00:03:57.210> I<00:03:57.540> just

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
not try it with the white deck so I just

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:01.729 
not try it with the white deck so I just
wanted<00:03:58.350> to<00:03:58.470> throw<00:03:58.620> that<00:03:58.680> out<00:03:58.860> there<00:03:59.600> just<00:04:00.739> just

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
wanted to throw that out there just just

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:03.350 
wanted to throw that out there just just
for<00:04:01.920> some<00:04:02.070> information<00:04:02.220> people<00:04:02.970> doing<00:04:03.239> this

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
for some information people doing this

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.250 
for some information people doing this
with<00:04:03.570> their<00:04:03.690> decks<00:04:03.900> now<00:04:05.330> it<00:04:06.330> looks<00:04:06.780> great<00:04:07.080> on

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
with their decks now it looks great on

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:08.810 
with their decks now it looks great on
the<00:04:07.380> black<00:04:07.560> you<00:04:08.220> know<00:04:08.340> it<00:04:08.459> for<00:04:08.580> the<00:04:08.640> Black

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
the black you know it for the Black

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:10.370 
the black you know it for the Black
Tiger<00:04:09.209> deck<00:04:09.390> that<00:04:09.570> I<00:04:09.660> did<00:04:09.840> I<00:04:09.870> think<00:04:10.170> it's

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
Tiger deck that I did I think it's

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:13.699 
Tiger deck that I did I think it's
awesome<00:04:10.590> now<00:04:10.920> but<00:04:12.050> that's<00:04:13.050> just<00:04:13.170> a<00:04:13.320> better<00:04:13.500> way

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
awesome now but that's just a better way

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:16.039 
awesome now but that's just a better way
to<00:04:13.770> do<00:04:13.950> it<00:04:14.100> using<00:04:14.640> the<00:04:14.850> clamp<00:04:15.180> so<00:04:15.840> you<00:04:15.900> don't

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
to do it using the clamp so you don't

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:17.060 
to do it using the clamp so you don't
have<00:04:16.109> to<00:04:16.200> hold<00:04:16.320> it<00:04:16.470> there<00:04:16.620> with<00:04:16.739> your<00:04:16.859> hands

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
have to hold it there with your hands

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.580 
have to hold it there with your hands
and<00:04:17.370> then<00:04:18.239> that<00:04:18.570> way<00:04:18.690> you<00:04:18.720> can<00:04:18.989> also<00:04:19.169> let<00:04:19.440> it
