because I need to have it down and I

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.690 
because I need to have it down and I
don't<00:02:51.170> necessarily<00:02:51.380> want<00:02:51.920> to<00:02:52.250> scratch<00:02:52.520> the

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
don't necessarily want to scratch the

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.229 
don't necessarily want to scratch the
glass<00:02:52.820> I<00:02:53.120> know<00:02:53.180> the<00:02:53.930> Gorilla<00:02:54.260> Glass<00:02:54.530> 2<00:02:54.860> is<00:02:55.239> has

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
glass I know the Gorilla Glass 2 is has

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:58.900 
glass I know the Gorilla Glass 2 is has
very<00:02:56.989> good<00:02:57.290> scratch<00:02:57.650> resistance<00:02:58.280> but<00:02:58.520> it<00:02:58.760> is

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
very good scratch resistance but it is

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.590 
very good scratch resistance but it is
it<00:02:59.600> will<00:02:59.959> scratch<00:03:00.290> when<00:03:00.680> you<00:03:00.770> have<00:03:01.010> sand<00:03:01.600> okay

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
it will scratch when you have sand okay

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.620 
it will scratch when you have sand okay
so<00:03:02.660> you<00:03:02.870> must<00:03:03.110> be<00:03:03.260> careful<00:03:03.530> so<00:03:04.520> I<00:03:04.820> realized

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
so you must be careful so I realized

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:08.800 
so you must be careful so I realized
that<00:03:06.350> the<00:03:06.709> best<00:03:06.739> place<00:03:07.280> to<00:03:07.340> put<00:03:07.520> it<00:03:07.880> is<00:03:08.000> if<00:03:08.660> you

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
that the best place to put it is if you

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.440 
that the best place to put it is if you
have<00:03:09.050> one<00:03:09.320> of<00:03:09.440> these<00:03:09.560> a<00:03:10.010> cover<00:03:10.489> at<00:03:11.209> the
