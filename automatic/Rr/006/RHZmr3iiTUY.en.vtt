00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.640
 hello friends my name is cristina 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:15.830
 martÃ­nez 

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:17.210
 this afternoon I find myself observing the 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.160
 roofs 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.140
 seeing all the triques that we left 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.770
 forgotten 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.660
 Sometimes there is good fencing 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:28.150
 there are people who even forget there 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:30.160
 your best friends 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.739
 we on green roofs are 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:35.710
 promoting the productive use of these 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:38.210
 spaces we can produce even 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:41.000
 our own food 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:43.430
 we are trying to concatenate this network 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.980
 of urban gardens in search of the 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.930
 sustainability, biodiversity and 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.940
 food sovereignty 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.410
 We begin this journey through the 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:55.990
 roofs of those who are already 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.990
 beginning to do accompany 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:01.580
 this time we visit our 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:04.370
 Friends of the project edible roofs 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:06.470
 let's tell us how how 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:09.080
 they are producing 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:13.610
 is producing yellow pepper 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:16.040
 red orange was producing lettuce 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:20.909
 the sangria let's start with the 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:22.950
 orejona we are producing cucumber 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.700
 to melon 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.700
 watermelon 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:31.260
 tomato of 34 varieties 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.290
 onion 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:35.960
 the courgettes actually step up to 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.880
 step 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:41.640
 more than that 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:45.060
 we have down 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.340
 technically good this 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.940
 may be feeding a week 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.530
 unity 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:54.350
 four or five members 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:58.850
 Seeing me as adjusted 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:01.250
 I'm not going over there are 67 people like that is the 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:04.190
 plant is not interesting 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:06.580
 Stage plant is what interests us 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:09.880
 it is below the earth 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:11.290
 in fact the potato one of the signs of 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.239
 that is already the plant is already 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.640
 all dry 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:17.530
 this 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:22.010
 soon you will not imagine that I may have 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:24.170
 that the watermelon was falling 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:27.469
 yes 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.469
 not much less 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:43.330
 and if this variety we do not know how to how 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:47.420
 it's called the good ones when bunches of 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:50.390
 more than thirty 30 fruits 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:52.730
 and good is a variety of yellow this 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:55.060
 ball of those seeds those that 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.060
 buy 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:02.659
 if you observed the characteristics in the 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:06.260
 size of their sizes and sizes are like 

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:09.250
 of 300 grams or so is the plant 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:11.220
 also follow up this is waka 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:16.390
 waka 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:19.030
 normalito of fruits and with how many 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:22.290
 lettuce are five plants and five 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:25.170
 plants of the variety of this 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.849
 bleeding are the holes that we do not 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.079
 we are in plant and it has to be in 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:29.600
 plant 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:32.300
 not in seeds because 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.860
 the essential yes does not work and has said to 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:36.890
 times greater week 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:40.990
 no pressure is reached but in there 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:40.990
 there you see the water through the tube 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:47.120
 that the idea is that we do not have to 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:47.120
 be watering every day 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:54.900
 the flowering is also the first time 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:57.540
 that we let jazz jazz from 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:00.510
 flowering and that is what will be the fruit 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.770
 we do not know if the structure is left 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.950
 this one or like the others 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:08.410
 and there come the tables that are the 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:13.020
 Sunflowers are among other plants 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:13.020
 definition this is a step 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.850
 also here in the afternoon 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.910
 when we have other other portions 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:28.580
 flowers also a lot of hummingbirds 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:30.850
 the cows baste all the 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.850
 leaflets 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.920
 all the while better with our 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:41.090
 closest 

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:43.280
 but as this will serve us for 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:45.520
 make infusions or put the 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:50.270
 forms for 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:54.940
 all these are three are the same as 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:54.940
 are in the peaks that make the 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:04.010
 lack of oxygenation what happens with the 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:07.850
 system and we still have to do 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:10.100
 more efficient is the oxygenation of the 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:12.770
 root and well the lung was below 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:16.120
 and it was on the whole sheet so it's very 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:16.120
 complicated to open one by one 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:23.770
 oil and soap presents us with a 

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:26.440
 problem that is called apical production 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:28.740
 is that they are covering work is not 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.740
 this 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:35.500
 we try to put more things in it but the 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:38.460
 compost 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.460
 if he takes it out but 

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:43.719
 and we here use eye 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:51.220
 on this planet what the pearlite does 

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:52.660
 it is that it gives even more 

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:55.750
 structure 

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:58.270
 it's purpose and substrate to breathe 

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:59.390
 but the ball can be replaced with 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:02.290
 jumps 

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:02.290
 who want to have 

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:10.470
 if you have to be very careful with 

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:12.120
 with the weight of the psoe 

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:14.230
 it's something that has to be taken a lot 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:17.650
 account is good 

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:19.509
 We are trying to make different 

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:22.780
 techniques making the most of 

00:06:19.509 --> 00:06:27.010
 space either vertically hanging 

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:29.730
 if the water line has increased 

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:29.730
 current 

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:35.490
 and has a treaty here that what 

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:37.590
 does it is that is only to measure the 

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:39.990
 level we want from water too 

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:42.720
 would have the horticulturist or the virgin tura 

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:46.940
 urban to worry about using 

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:46.940
 techniques that make the most of 

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:50.710
 we are not with the problem that is 

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:53.610
 is living 

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:53.610
 but we put 

00:06:54.710 --> 00:07:01.170
 and good water 

00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:01.170
 here we have the good nutrients 

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:09.940
 We are normally on Friday 

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:09.940
 6 and a half in the afternoon 

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:18.430
 people can come visit us see the 

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:21.430
 live system 

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:23.700
 ask good this is the project 

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:25.770
 associate with this english 

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:27.320
 that this is the project's garden 

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:29.910
 we want the project to be something more 

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:33.380
 more than this garden this is not a 

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:36.380
 client are more things is education is 

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:36.380
 transfer 

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:43.460
 more things than at this time yes that is 

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:45.759
 recent are not only people 

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:49.210
 we want to open at some point 

00:07:45.759 --> 00:07:53.229
 call for volunteers 

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:55.740
 to generate manual content x 

00:07:53.229 --> 00:07:55.740
 points
