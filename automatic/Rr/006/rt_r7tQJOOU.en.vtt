actually<00:00:41.700> i<00:00:42.329> believe<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.899> second<00:00:43.320> fastest

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
actually i believe the second fastest

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.229 
actually i believe the second fastest
champion<00:00:44.280> in<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.399> game<00:00:44.640> just<00:00:44.879> because<00:00:45.000> he

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
champion in the game just because he

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.260 
champion in the game just because he
gets<00:00:45.390> spammed<00:00:45.690> is<00:00:46.140> e<00:00:46.289> which<00:00:47.280> gives<00:00:47.550> him<00:00:47.730> him<00:00:48.149> a

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
gets spammed is e which gives him him a

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.360 
gets spammed is e which gives him him a
movement<00:00:48.750> speed<00:00:48.989> boost<00:00:49.530> especially<00:00:50.160> if<00:00:50.250> you

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
movement speed boost especially if you

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.119 
movement speed boost especially if you
have<00:00:50.399> a<00:00:50.520> blue<00:00:50.820> and<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:51.059> red<00:00:51.649> that<00:00:52.649> basically

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
have a blue and the red that basically

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.029 
have a blue and the red that basically
makes<00:00:53.489> you<00:00:54.170> ridiculously<00:00:55.170> fast<00:00:55.500> and<00:00:55.800> you<00:00:55.890> can

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
makes you ridiculously fast and you can

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.150 
makes you ridiculously fast and you can
just<00:00:56.840> annihilate<00:00:57.840> anything<00:00:58.379> but<00:00:58.620> other<00:00:58.920> than

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
just annihilate anything but other than

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.770 
just annihilate anything but other than
that<00:00:59.219> you<00:00:59.460> don't<00:00:59.640> really<00:00:59.730> have<00:00:59.940> a<00:01:00.000> lot<00:01:00.270> of<00:01:00.329> CC

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
that you don't really have a lot of CC

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.450 
that you don't really have a lot of CC
to<00:01:00.960> stop<00:01:01.230> people<00:01:01.410> you<00:01:01.680> just<00:01:01.710> have<00:01:01.980> to<00:01:02.100> keep<00:01:02.250> up

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.820 
gold / 5 like the Philosopher's Stone I
haven't<00:03:10.690> they<00:03:10.750> got<00:03:10.900> her<00:03:11.140> to<00:03:11.200> be<00:03:11.380> heart<00:03:11.590> of<00:03:11.709> gold

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:11.830 
haven't they got her to be heart of gold

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:16.320 
haven't they got her to be heart of gold
which<00:03:12.280> was<00:03:12.489> a<00:03:12.519> huge<00:03:12.820> item<00:03:14.910> but<00:03:15.910> anyways<00:03:16.209> you

which was a huge item but anyways you
can<00:03:16.420> still<00:03:16.570> get<00:03:16.660> a<00:03:16.720> philosopher's<00:03:17.320> stone<00:03:17.350> he

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
can still get a philosopher's stone he

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.020 
can still get a philosopher's stone he
can<00:03:17.799> build<00:03:17.920> a<00:03:18.040> tanky<00:03:18.489> you<00:03:18.580> can<00:03:18.730> build<00:03:18.910> them

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
can build a tanky you can build them

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.780 
can build a tanky you can build them
basically<00:03:19.420> however<00:03:19.959> you<00:03:20.140> like<00:03:20.470> a<00:03:20.769> lot<00:03:21.610> I<00:03:21.730> know

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
basically however you like a lot I know

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.310 
basically however you like a lot I know
a<00:03:21.880> lot<00:03:22.060> of<00:03:22.120> people<00:03:22.239> like<00:03:22.570> to<00:03:22.630> build<00:03:22.900> him<00:03:23.080> as<00:03:23.230> a

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
a lot of people like to build him as a

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:28.620 
a lot of people like to build him as a
tank<00:03:24.600> basically<00:03:26.340> how<00:03:27.340> people<00:03:27.730> really<00:03:28.239> like<00:03:28.480> to

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
tank basically how people really like to

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.930 
tank basically how people really like to
play<00:03:28.810> him<00:03:28.989> i<00:03:29.110> guess<00:03:29.370> but<00:03:30.370> i<00:03:30.430> don't<00:03:30.820> know<00:03:30.850> i

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
play him i guess but i don't know i

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.259 
play him i guess but i don't know i
liked<00:03:31.239> him<00:03:31.420> has<00:03:31.660> kind<00:03:32.290> of<00:03:32.380> a<00:03:32.500> loser<00:03:33.269> which

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:34.269 
liked him has kind of a loser which

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:36.180 
liked him has kind of a loser which
that's<00:03:34.690> I<00:03:34.989> think<00:03:35.440> that's<00:03:35.680> pretty<00:03:35.860> much<00:03:36.040> how

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
that's I think that's pretty much how

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.330 
that's I think that's pretty much how
it's<00:03:36.340> supposed<00:03:36.640> to<00:03:36.730> be<00:03:36.790> played<00:03:37.000> but<00:03:38.340> really

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
it's supposed to be played but really

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.250 
it's supposed to be played but really
the<00:03:39.579> skill<00:03:40.000> order<00:03:40.209> really<00:03:40.510> depends<00:03:41.110> on<00:03:41.200> what

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
the skill order really depends on what

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:42.760 
the skill order really depends on what
your

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:42.770 
your

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:46.840 
your
usually<00:03:43.370> for<00:03:44.210> getting<00:03:44.510> the<00:03:44.660> skills<00:03:45.850> actually

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:46.850 
usually for getting the skills actually

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:48.100 
usually for getting the skills actually
I<00:03:46.880> should<00:03:47.030> probably<00:03:47.150> review<00:03:47.720> what<00:03:47.870> all<00:03:47.960> the

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.110 
I should probably review what all the

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:51.910 
I should probably review what all the
skills<00:03:48.380> are<00:03:48.560> so<00:03:49.160> basically<00:03:50.110> as<00:03:51.110> passive<00:03:51.680> is

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
skills are so basically as passive is

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.970 
skills are so basically as passive is
whenever<00:03:52.160> he<00:03:52.400> changes<00:03:52.940> into<00:03:53.410> another<00:03:54.410> stance

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
whenever he changes into another stance

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.160 
whenever he changes into another stance
his<00:03:55.670> attack<00:03:56.060> speed<00:03:56.330> has<00:03:56.450> increased<00:03:56.570> by<00:03:56.960> ten

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 
his attack speed has increased by ten

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:59.470 
his attack speed has increased by ten
percent<00:03:57.200> for<00:03:57.650> five<00:03:57.830> seconds<00:03:58.370> and<00:03:58.520> it<00:03:59.360> can

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
percent for five seconds and it can

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.620 
percent for five seconds and it can
actually<00:03:59.630> set<00:04:00.140> stack<00:04:00.800> up<00:04:00.950> to<00:04:01.190> three<00:04:02.000> times<00:04:02.180> and

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:02.630 
actually set stack up to three times and

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:04.300 
actually set stack up to three times and
another<00:04:03.260> important<00:04:03.740> thing<00:04:03.860> to<00:04:03.950> note<00:04:04.130> is<00:04:04.160> that

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
another important thing to note is that

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.070 
another important thing to note is that
whenever<00:04:04.820> you<00:04:05.090> switch<00:04:05.240> stance<00:04:05.600> is<00:04:05.810> it<00:04:05.960> goes

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:06.080 
whenever you switch stance is it goes

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.800 
whenever you switch stance is it goes
off<00:04:06.260> with<00:04:06.440> a<00:04:06.620> 1.5<00:04:07.580> global<00:04:08.240> cooldown<00:04:08.420> so<00:04:08.720> you
