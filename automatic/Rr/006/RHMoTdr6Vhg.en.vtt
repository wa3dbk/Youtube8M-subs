they<00:00:31.619> did<00:00:31.830> they<00:00:32.009> just<00:00:32.250> removed<00:00:32.610> the

they did they just removed the

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.620 
they did they just removed the
complexity<00:00:34.350> organization<00:00:34.920> completely<00:00:35.370> so

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:35.630 
complexity organization completely so

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.150 
complexity organization completely so
what<00:00:36.630> basically<00:00:36.840> happened<00:00:37.500> is<00:00:37.590> that<00:00:37.739> evil

complexity<00:00:42.600> however<00:00:43.170> I<00:00:43.290> do<00:00:43.500> know<00:00:43.680> that<00:00:43.890> they

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
complexity however I do know that they

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.549 
complexity however I do know that they
got<00:00:44.700> a<00:00:44.760> better<00:00:45.030> deal<00:00:45.270> over<00:00:45.690> it<00:00:45.780> evil<00:00:46.050> geniuses

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
got a better deal over it evil geniuses

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.830 
got a better deal over it evil geniuses
then<00:00:46.890> they<00:00:47.550> had<00:00:47.760> it<00:00:47.910> Cole<00:00:48.120> I<00:00:48.149> believe<00:00:48.570> their

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
it and it was made official now they

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.530

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:00.890 
bought everything they bought them out
now<00:02:59.760> keemstar<00:03:00.030> said<00:03:00.480> something<00:03:00.780> about

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
now keemstar said something about

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.230 
now keemstar said something about
seventy<00:03:01.320> thousand<00:03:01.740> dollars<00:03:02.040> that<00:03:02.910> seems

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:03.240 
seventy thousand dollars that seems

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.120 
seventy thousand dollars that seems
pretty<00:03:03.600> low<00:03:03.900> price<00:03:04.200> to<00:03:04.410> me<00:03:04.530> but<00:03:04.710> maybe<00:03:04.920> I'm

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
pretty low price to me but maybe I'm

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.820 
pretty low price to me but maybe I'm
just<00:03:05.310> so<00:03:05.580> unaware<00:03:06.000> of<00:03:06.480> how<00:03:06.780> much<00:03:06.990> opportunity

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
just so unaware of how much opportunity

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.640 
just so unaware of how much opportunity
there<00:03:08.370> is<00:03:08.400> and<00:03:08.760> I<00:03:08.820> guess<00:03:09.030> for<00:03:09.270> complexity<00:03:09.900> the

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
there is and I guess for complexity the

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.530 
there is and I guess for complexity the
stream<00:03:11.040> revenue<00:03:11.490> opportunity<00:03:12.060> is<00:03:12.180> not<00:03:12.360> the

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
stream revenue opportunity is not the

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.000 
stream revenue opportunity is not the
same<00:03:12.780> because<00:03:13.140> complexity<00:03:13.710> had<00:03:13.860> their

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
same because complexity had their

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.560 
same because complexity had their
partnership<00:03:14.580> with<00:03:14.700> twitch<00:03:14.940> and<00:03:15.090> they<00:03:15.210> didn't

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
partnership with twitch and they didn't

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.870 
partnership with twitch and they didn't
they<00:03:16.020> couldn't<00:03:16.380> stream<00:03:16.680> on<00:03:16.830> lg<00:03:17.190> tv<00:03:17.220> and<00:03:17.820> I

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
they couldn't stream on lg tv and I

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.480 
they couldn't stream on lg tv and I
believe<00:03:18.120> they<00:03:18.270> still<00:03:18.330> can't<00:03:18.930> stream<00:03:19.290> on<00:03:19.620> MLG

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:20.490 
believe they still can't stream on MLG

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:23.230 
believe they still can't stream on MLG
TV<00:03:21.060> because<00:03:21.240> of<00:03:21.480> the<00:03:21.600> players<00:03:21.980> individual

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:23.240 
TV because of the players individual

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.910 
TV because of the players individual
commitment<00:03:24.240> to<00:03:24.510> twitch<00:03:24.810> so<00:03:25.110> we'll<00:03:25.680> see<00:03:25.890> how

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
commitment to twitch so we'll see how

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.320 
commitment to twitch so we'll see how
that<00:03:26.130> works<00:03:26.280> out<00:03:26.610> I<00:03:26.670> have<00:03:26.820> a<00:03:26.880> feeling<00:03:27.209> we're

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
that works out I have a feeling we're

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:28.699 
that works out I have a feeling we're
gonna<00:03:27.390> get<00:03:27.690> some<00:03:27.870> more<00:03:28.020> announcements<00:03:28.620> coming

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
gonna get some more announcements coming

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.280 
gonna get some more announcements coming
our<00:03:28.950> way<00:03:29.070> but<00:03:29.910> I'm<00:03:30.090> really<00:03:30.270> excited<00:03:30.600> for<00:03:30.990> what

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
our way but I'm really excited for what

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.949 
our way but I'm really excited for what
this<00:03:31.500> you<00:03:32.010> know<00:03:32.100> what<00:03:32.310> this<00:03:32.430> move<00:03:32.670> does<00:03:32.970> and<00:03:33.420> I

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
this you know what this move does and I

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:35.840 
this you know what this move does and I
think<00:03:34.170> it<00:03:34.260> was<00:03:34.410> the<00:03:34.560> best<00:03:34.800> for<00:03:35.160> those<00:03:35.280> guys<00:03:35.520> you

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
think it was the best for those guys you

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.420

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
as well as they've played you know they

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.560

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.520 
revenue they deserve it you know and I
think<00:03:50.970> that<00:03:51.209> I<00:03:51.420> think<00:03:51.810> this<00:03:51.870> was<00:03:52.050> a<00:03:52.080> good<00:03:52.200> move

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
think that I think this was a good move

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:53.990 
think that I think this was a good move
for<00:03:52.560> them<00:03:53.040> you<00:03:53.430> know<00:03:53.520> and<00:03:53.550> it's<00:03:53.730> going<00:03:53.820> to<00:03:53.880> be

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
for them you know and it's going to be

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.060 
for them you know and it's going to be

Games<00:03:59.190> or<00:04:00.230> will<00:04:01.230> we<00:04:01.490> see<00:04:02.490> the<00:04:02.610> opportunity

that's on the table right now is you got
players<00:04:04.590> like<00:04:04.860> fizzer<00:04:05.130> if<00:04:05.490> you<00:04:05.580> got<00:04:05.700> players

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
players like fizzer if you got players

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:07.640 
players like fizzer if you got players
like<00:04:06.180> Bryan<00:04:06.330> st.<00:04:06.840> that<00:04:07.140> just<00:04:07.380> played<00:04:07.620> with

like Bryan st. that just played with
phase<00:04:08.040> got<00:04:08.340> those<00:04:08.490> Pro<00:04:08.700> points<00:04:09.000> from<00:04:09.090> them<00:04:09.300> and

I<00:04:09.750> believe<00:04:09.989> he<00:04:10.110> now<00:04:10.230> has<00:04:10.380> like<00:04:10.560> twenty<00:04:10.830> four

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:14.309 
comments below just to recap this you
know<00:05:12.669> complexity<00:05:13.509> is<00:05:13.599> no<00:05:13.750> longer<00:05:14.020> in

00:05:14.309 --> 00:05:14.319 
know complexity is no longer in

00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:17.459 
know complexity is no longer in
existence<00:05:15.360> complexity<00:05:16.360> right<00:05:16.840> now<00:05:17.050> as<00:05:17.319> we

00:05:17.459 --> 00:05:17.469 
existence complexity right now as we

00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:19.379 
existence complexity right now as we
have<00:05:17.650> it<00:05:17.830> does<00:05:18.159> not<00:05:18.340> have<00:05:18.580> a<00:05:18.610> competitive<00:05:19.180> team

00:05:19.379 --> 00:05:19.389 
have it does not have a competitive team

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:21.629 
have it does not have a competitive team
call<00:05:20.050> of<00:05:20.139> duty<00:05:20.379> team<00:05:20.590> I<00:05:20.800> think<00:05:20.919> they<00:05:21.400> will

00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:21.639 
call of duty team I think they will

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:23.850 
call of duty team I think they will
we'll<00:05:22.150> just<00:05:22.360> see<00:05:22.539> who<00:05:22.840> that<00:05:23.199> ends<00:05:23.590> up<00:05:23.650> being

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:23.860 
we'll just see who that ends up being

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:25.860 
we'll just see who that ends up being
and<00:05:24.129> if<00:05:24.250> they<00:05:24.430> end<00:05:24.639> up<00:05:24.789> at<00:05:24.969> X<00:05:25.270> Games<00:05:25.389> this<00:05:25.750> is

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870 
and if they end up at X Games this is

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:27.390 
and if they end up at X Games this is
your<00:05:25.960> boy<00:05:26.050> Kingdom<00:05:26.379> soldier<00:05:26.710> and<00:05:26.889> i'll<00:05:27.219> see

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:27.400 
your boy Kingdom soldier and i'll see

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.939 
your boy Kingdom soldier and i'll see
you<00:05:27.460> in<00:05:27.520> the<00:05:27.550> next<00:05:27.669> video
