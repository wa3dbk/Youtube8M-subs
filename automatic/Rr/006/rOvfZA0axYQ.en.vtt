00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
curious about this is that all of them

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.870 
curious about this is that all of them
actually<00:00:26.010> require<00:00:26.630> reputation<00:00:27.630> in<00:00:28.880> various

the daily quests from your pandaren hub

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.819 
the daily quests from your pandaren hub
so<00:00:38.600> they're<00:00:39.600> not<00:00:39.719> going<00:00:39.780> to<00:00:40.079> let<00:00:40.170> you<00:00:40.440> get<00:00:40.649> it

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
so they're not going to let you get it

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.110 
so they're not going to let you get it
straight<00:00:41.070> off<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.250> bat<00:00:41.520> she's<00:00:41.940> definitely

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
straight off the bat she's definitely

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:50.000 
straight off the bat she's definitely
interesting<00:00:46.489> hmm<00:00:47.489> valor<00:00:48.480> also<00:00:49.020> requires<00:00:49.410> some

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
interesting hmm valor also requires some

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.000 
interesting hmm valor also requires some
reputation<00:00:50.940> they're<00:00:51.510> mostly<00:00:51.870> revered<00:00:52.350> but

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
reputation they're mostly revered but

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.279 
reputation they're mostly revered but
there<00:00:53.129> is<00:00:53.160> like<00:00:53.850> one<00:00:54.300> or<00:00:54.449> two<00:00:54.480> items<00:00:55.020> which

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
there is like one or two items which

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.459 
there is like one or two items which
don't<00:00:55.680> require<00:00:55.850> reputation<00:00:56.850> at<00:00:56.969> all<00:00:57.149> which

00:00:57.459 --> 00:00:57.469 
don't require reputation at all which

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:00.790 
don't require reputation at all which
again<00:00:58.469> is<00:00:58.739> definitely<00:00:59.640> interesting<00:00:59.879> I<00:01:00.300> mean

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
again is definitely interesting I mean

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.950 
again is definitely interesting I mean
it's<00:01:01.850> interesting<00:01:02.850> to<00:01:03.359> see<00:01:05.659> sort<00:01:06.659> of<00:01:06.750> how

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
it's interesting to see sort of how

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.210 
it's interesting to see sort of how
they're<00:01:07.170> going<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.409> work<00:01:07.619> this<00:01:07.860> really

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
they're going to work this really

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.630 
they're going to work this really
especially<00:01:08.700> that<00:01:09.240> justice<00:01:10.140> sells<00:01:10.409> gear<00:01:11.159> of<00:01:11.490> a

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
especially that justice sells gear of a

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.109 
especially that justice sells gear of a
lower<00:01:11.820> quality<00:01:12.030> than<00:01:12.299> heroics<00:01:12.840> I<00:01:13.880> guess<00:01:14.880> this

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
lower quality than heroics I guess this

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.359 
lower quality than heroics I guess this
is<00:01:15.270> going<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:15.659> be<00:01:15.810> filler<00:01:16.530> if<00:01:16.830> nothing<00:01:17.100> else

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
is going to be filler if nothing else

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.499 
is going to be filler if nothing else
but<00:01:18.180> so<00:01:18.479> far<00:01:18.689> on<00:01:19.020> justice<00:01:19.740> we<00:01:19.920> have<00:01:20.100> chest<00:01:20.729> back

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
but so far on justice we have chest back

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.600 
but so far on justice we have chest back
finger<00:01:22.350> hands<00:01:23.250> legs<00:01:24.470> neck<00:01:25.470> wrists<00:01:26.369> and

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
finger hands legs neck wrists and

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.109 
finger hands legs neck wrists and
trinkets<00:01:27.509> these<00:01:27.869> to<00:01:28.140> drink<00:01:28.350> it<00:01:28.470> seemed<00:01:28.740> a<00:01:28.770> bit

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 
trinkets these to drink it seemed a bit

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:33.740 
trinkets these to drink it seemed a bit
quirky<00:01:30.119> if<00:01:30.659> not<00:01:31.100> usable<00:01:32.240> as<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.450> shado-pan

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
quirky if not usable as the shado-pan

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.679 
quirky if not usable as the shado-pan
dragon<00:01:34.320> gun<00:01:34.470> and<00:01:35.000> the<00:01:36.000> Mogu<00:01:36.329> rune<00:01:36.540> of

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
dragon gun and the Mogu rune of

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.219 
dragon gun and the Mogu rune of
paralysis<00:01:38.720> which<00:01:39.720> that's<00:01:39.930> going<00:01:40.110> to<00:01:40.170> be

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
paralysis which that's going to be

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:46.020 
paralysis which that's going to be
usable<00:01:40.590> in<00:01:40.710> pvp<00:01:41.130> at<00:01:41.220> all<00:01:42.140> only<00:01:43.140> time<00:01:43.320> will<00:01:43.380> tell

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.760 

with<00:01:47.030> valor<00:01:47.270> you<00:01:47.570> seem<00:01:47.780> to<00:01:47.929> get<00:01:48.079> a<00:01:48.320> bit<00:01:48.560> more

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
with valor you seem to get a bit more

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.039 
with valor you seem to get a bit more
choice<00:01:49.070> and<00:01:49.460> obviously<00:01:50.179> you<00:01:50.270> have<00:01:50.509> them<00:01:50.750> for

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:51.049 
choice and obviously you have them for

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:53.679 
choice and obviously you have them for
the<00:01:51.619> different<00:01:51.920> specs<00:01:52.219> so<00:01:52.729> we<00:01:52.969> can<00:01:53.210> swap

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:53.689 
the different specs so we can swap

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:55.749 
the different specs so we can swap
between<00:01:53.869> these<00:01:54.280> brewmaster<00:01:55.280> and<00:01:55.399> wind<00:01:55.579> Walker

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
between these brewmaster and wind Walker

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:58.569 
between these brewmaster and wind Walker
share<00:01:56.509> some<00:01:56.840> and<00:01:57.140> mr.<00:01:58.009> Weaver<00:01:58.219> is<00:01:58.310> going<00:01:58.490> to

00:01:58.569 --> 00:01:58.579 
share some and mr. Weaver is going to

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:01.929 
share some and mr. Weaver is going to
have<00:01:58.729> a<00:01:58.759> completely<00:01:59.270> different<00:01:59.569> ballpark<00:02:00.939> but

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:01.939 
have a completely different ballpark but

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:05.499 
have a completely different ballpark but
once<00:02:02.270> again<00:02:02.630> we<00:02:02.990> have<00:02:03.460> some<00:02:04.460> similar<00:02:05.000> items<00:02:05.119> so

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:05.509 
once again we have some similar items so

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:08.949 
once again we have some similar items so
we<00:02:05.569> had<00:02:05.719> chest<00:02:05.990> back<00:02:06.969> fingers<00:02:07.969> guess<00:02:08.750> you<00:02:08.840> can

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
we had chest back fingers guess you can

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:13.449 
we had chest back fingers guess you can
use<00:02:09.080> two<00:02:09.259> hands<00:02:09.940> although<00:02:10.940> we<00:02:11.090> get<00:02:11.500> ahead<00:02:12.500> get

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
use two hands although we get ahead get

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:17.350 
use two hands although we get ahead get
shoulders<00:02:14.349> more<00:02:15.349> trinkets<00:02:15.790> get<00:02:16.790> a<00:02:16.819> waste<00:02:17.090> as

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
shoulders more trinkets get a waste as

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:07.609

grind on suppose it's another reason to
grind<00:03:07.850> these<00:03:08.000> reputations<00:03:08.720> I<00:03:08.930> mean<00:03:09.079> you'll<00:03:09.230> be

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
grind these reputations I mean you'll be

grind these reputations I mean you'll be
able<00:03:09.380> to<00:03:09.500> get<00:03:09.730> gear<00:03:10.730> from<00:03:11.030> the<00:03:11.180> reputation

vendors<00:03:12.290> and<00:03:12.470> quartermasters<00:03:13.160> anyway<00:03:13.519> so<00:03:13.810> I'm

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
vendors and quartermasters anyway so I'm

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.289 
vendors and quartermasters anyway so I'm
guessing<00:03:15.049> this<00:03:15.470> is<00:03:15.680> going<00:03:15.889> to<00:03:16.040> be<00:03:16.220> a<00:03:16.519> bit<00:03:17.030> of<00:03:17.209> a

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:17.299 
guessing this is going to be a bit of a

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:19.720 
guessing this is going to be a bit of a
wrap<00:03:17.540> grinding<00:03:18.139> expansion<00:03:18.799> at<00:03:19.220> least<00:03:19.459> at<00:03:19.639> the

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
wrap grinding expansion at least at the

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.229 
wrap grinding expansion at least at the
start<00:03:21.400> it's<00:03:22.400> definitely<00:03:22.579> curious<00:03:22.970> how

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
start it's definitely curious how

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:28.440 
start it's definitely curious how
they're<00:03:24.010> trying<00:03:25.010> to<00:03:25.160> almost<00:03:25.819> force<00:03:26.239> you<00:03:26.450> to

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
they're trying to almost force you to

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.699 
they're trying to almost force you to
grind<00:03:29.450> it<00:03:29.750> although<00:03:30.079> I<00:03:30.109> suppose<00:03:30.290> we'll<00:03:30.530> have

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709 
grind it although I suppose we'll have

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:35.500 
grind it although I suppose we'll have
the<00:03:30.919> looking<00:03:31.760> for<00:03:31.910> raid<00:03:32.120> which<00:03:32.510> drops<00:03:33.079> I<00:03:34.510> think

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
the looking for raid which drops I think

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:40.370 
the looking for raid which drops I think
they<00:03:35.599> do<00:03:35.660> drop<00:03:36.019> 489<00:03:36.829> actually

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.170 

either<00:03:41.380> way<00:03:41.650> if<00:03:42.340> you<00:03:42.550> want<00:03:42.700> to<00:03:42.790> have<00:03:42.910> a<00:03:42.940> look<00:03:43.060> at

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
either way if you want to have a look at

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:44.400 
either way if you want to have a look at
these<00:03:43.330> yourself<00:03:43.540> remember<00:03:44.020> that<00:03:44.230> these<00:03:44.350> are

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
these yourself remember that these are
