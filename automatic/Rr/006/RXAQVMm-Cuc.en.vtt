if you're planning already on getting
heart<00:00:22.619> beats<00:00:22.830> and<00:00:23.010> you<00:00:23.070> don't<00:00:23.279> want<00:00:23.400> any

to<00:00:25.289> watch<00:00:25.380> on<00:00:25.590> em<00:00:25.770> spine<00:00:26.100> okay<00:00:27.090> so<00:00:27.600> heart<00:00:28.170> beats

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
to watch on em spine okay so heart beats

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.519 
to watch on em spine okay so heart beats
it<00:00:29.220> is<00:00:29.460> and<00:00:29.760> I<00:00:30.420> suppose<00:00:30.930> it's<00:00:31.109> sort<00:00:31.320> of<00:00:31.350> like<00:00:31.470> a

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
it is and I suppose it's sort of like a

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.540 
it is and I suppose it's sort of like a
graphic<00:00:32.160> novel<00:00:32.610> that<00:00:32.790> you<00:00:33.860> interact<00:00:34.860> with<00:00:35.040> and

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
graphic novel that you interact with and

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.160 
graphic novel that you interact with and
it's<00:00:36.059> about<00:00:36.630> solving<00:00:37.380> these<00:00:37.559> puzzles<00:00:37.950> and

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:39.170 
it's about solving these puzzles and

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.819 
it's about solving these puzzles and
figuring<00:00:40.170> out<00:00:40.320> how<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.070> visuals<00:00:41.760> on<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.899> on

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
figuring out how the visuals on the on

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.150 
figuring out how the visuals on the on
the<00:00:44.070> page<00:00:44.309> I<00:00:44.610> suppose<00:00:45.000> relates<00:00:45.899> to<00:00:46.559> moving

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
the page I suppose relates to moving

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.610 
the page I suppose relates to moving
forward<00:00:47.760> in<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.030> story<00:00:48.300> and<00:00:48.629> obviously

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
forward in the story and obviously

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.549 
forward in the story and obviously
solving<00:00:50.070> puzzles<00:00:50.309> and<00:00:50.730> so<00:00:50.910> forth<00:00:51.410> he<00:00:52.410> might

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
solving puzzles and so forth he might

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.110 
solving puzzles and so forth he might
have<00:00:52.649> noticed<00:00:53.010> already<00:00:53.160> that<00:00:53.820> there's<00:00:54.000> no

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
have noticed already that there's no

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.000 
have noticed already that there's no
sound<00:00:54.450> in<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.780> game<00:00:54.960> that's<00:00:55.500> a<00:00:55.739> very

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
sound in the game that's a very

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.130 
sound in the game that's a very
deliberate<00:00:56.640> choice<00:00:56.850> by<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.420> by<00:00:58.079> the

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
deliberate choice by the by the

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.549 
deliberate choice by the by the
developer<00:00:58.680> and<00:00:58.980> in<00:00:59.579> some<00:00:59.910> ways<00:01:00.090> I<00:01:00.480> don't<00:01:01.260> think

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
developer and in some ways I don't think

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.650 
developer and in some ways I don't think
it's<00:01:01.649> much<00:01:01.770> of<00:01:01.829> an<00:01:01.980> issue<00:01:02.100> actually<00:01:02.520> that<00:01:03.300> he

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
it's much of an issue actually that he

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.269 
it's much of an issue actually that he
doesn't<00:01:03.960> go<00:01:04.049> there<00:01:04.259> was<00:01:04.499> the<00:01:04.619> I'll<00:01:05.100> leave<00:01:05.249> that

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:05.279 
doesn't go there was the I'll leave that

00:01:05.279 --> 00:01:07.279 
doesn't go there was the I'll leave that
for<00:01:05.519> a<00:01:05.579> little<00:01:05.670> bit<00:01:05.819> I<00:01:06.450> don't<00:01:06.959> actually<00:01:07.139> think

00:01:07.279 --> 00:01:07.289 
for a little bit I don't actually think

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:08.690 
for a little bit I don't actually think
it's<00:01:07.499> much<00:01:07.590> of<00:01:07.619> an<00:01:07.770> issue<00:01:07.889> you<00:01:08.069> don't<00:01:08.189> think<00:01:08.549> of

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
it's much of an issue you don't think of

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.769 
it's much of an issue you don't think of
books<00:01:09.299> as<00:01:09.630> having<00:01:09.959> sound<00:01:10.369> necessarily<00:01:11.369> so<00:01:12.149> you

00:01:12.769 --> 00:01:12.779 
books as having sound necessarily so you

00:01:12.779 --> 00:01:14.269 
books as having sound necessarily so you
know<00:01:12.899> a<00:01:13.049> graphic<00:01:13.380> novel<00:01:13.409> needn't<00:01:14.159> necessarily

00:01:14.269 --> 00:01:14.279 
know a graphic novel needn't necessarily

00:01:14.279 --> 00:01:16.160 
know a graphic novel needn't necessarily
be<00:01:14.789> the<00:01:14.969> same<00:01:14.999> and<00:01:15.450> I<00:01:15.719> think<00:01:15.749> it<00:01:15.959> might<00:01:16.079> be

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
be the same and I think it might be

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.779 
be the same and I think it might be
slightly<00:01:16.349> jarring<00:01:16.829> to<00:01:16.979> begin<00:01:17.279> with<00:01:17.399> but<00:01:17.579> at

00:01:17.779 --> 00:01:17.789 
slightly jarring to begin with but at

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:18.620 
slightly jarring to begin with but at
the<00:01:17.909> bottom<00:01:17.999> of<00:01:18.179> the<00:01:18.240> screen<00:01:18.389> you'll<00:01:18.599> see

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
the bottom of the screen you'll see

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.019 
the bottom of the screen you'll see
reset<00:01:19.109> music<00:01:19.469> credits<00:01:19.829> if<00:01:20.219> you<00:01:20.340> tap<00:01:20.520> on<00:01:20.609> music

00:01:21.019 --> 00:01:21.029 
reset music credits if you tap on music

00:01:21.029 --> 00:01:23.330 
reset music credits if you tap on music
which<00:01:21.420> I'll<00:01:21.599> do<00:01:21.719> now<00:01:21.749> you<00:01:22.709> can<00:01:22.859> see<00:01:23.039> that<00:01:23.189> there

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
which I'll do now you can see that there

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.129 
which I'll do now you can see that there
are<00:01:23.520> different<00:01:23.969> playlists<00:01:24.420> these<00:01:24.779> actually

00:01:25.129 --> 00:01:25.139 
are different playlists these actually

00:01:25.139 --> 00:01:27.529 
are different playlists these actually
go<00:01:25.170> out<00:01:25.409> to<00:01:25.439> Spotify<00:01:26.369> playlists<00:01:26.880> from<00:01:27.240> people

00:01:27.529 --> 00:01:27.539 
go out to Spotify playlists from people

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:29.300 
go out to Spotify playlists from people
that<00:01:27.779> the<00:01:27.899> developer<00:01:28.259> think<00:01:28.469> are<00:01:28.619> pretty<00:01:29.189> cool

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
that the developer think are pretty cool

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.039 
that the developer think are pretty cool
and<00:01:29.369> know<00:01:29.669> their<00:01:29.849> music<00:01:30.179> and<00:01:30.329> that<00:01:30.779> you<00:01:30.869> might

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
and know their music and that you might

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.800 
and know their music and that you might
want<00:01:31.229> to<00:01:31.289> that<00:01:32.009> you<00:01:32.099> might<00:01:32.279> want<00:01:32.459> to<00:01:32.520> listen<00:01:33.479> to

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
want to that you might want to listen to

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.690 
want to that you might want to listen to
while<00:01:34.109> playing<00:01:34.319> the<00:01:34.469> game<00:01:34.590> anyway<00:01:35.159> so<00:01:35.549> let's

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
while playing the game anyway so let's

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.239 
while playing the game anyway so let's
go<00:01:35.789> back<00:01:35.939> to<00:01:36.060> our<00:01:36.179> puzzle<00:01:36.529> so<00:01:37.529> we've<00:01:37.619> put<00:01:38.130> the

00:01:38.239 --> 00:01:38.249 
go back to our puzzle so we've put the

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:41.539 
go back to our puzzle so we've put the
title<00:01:38.700> into<00:01:39.209> the<00:01:39.419> key<00:01:39.840> so<00:01:40.679> the<00:01:40.799> key<00:01:41.009> to<00:01:41.189> open<00:01:41.459> up

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
title into the key so the key to open up

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.469 
title into the key so the key to open up
this<00:01:42.049> game<00:01:43.049> is<00:01:43.380> this<00:01:43.709> you<00:01:44.189> know<00:01:44.310> is<00:01:44.459> the<00:01:45.090> title

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
this game is this you know is the title

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:46.969 
this game is this you know is the title
and<00:01:45.630> then<00:01:45.719> we're<00:01:45.810> gonna<00:01:45.899> slam<00:01:46.409> this<00:01:46.679> into<00:01:46.889> the

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
and then we're gonna slam this into the

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.709 
and then we're gonna slam this into the
persons<00:01:47.359> where<00:01:48.359> hole<00:01:49.079> in<00:01:49.739> their<00:01:50.099> face<00:01:50.489> okay<00:01:51.090> so
