00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
to rip the paper and then I'm going to

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.369 
to rip the paper and then I'm going to
turn<00:02:35.840> it<00:02:36.079> around<00:02:36.319> twice<00:02:37.280> so<00:02:37.909> turn<00:02:38.360> it<00:02:38.450> once<00:02:38.720> and

00:02:39.369 --> 00:02:39.379 
turn it around twice so turn it once and

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:42.640 
turn it around twice so turn it once and
twice<00:02:39.980> and<00:02:40.879> then<00:02:41.209> score<00:02:41.599> it<00:02:41.720> again<00:02:41.989> at<00:02:42.200> four

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.380 
twice and then score it again at four
and<00:02:43.069> one-eighth<00:02:43.970> okay<00:02:44.780> so<00:02:45.500> two<00:02:45.560> flat<00:02:46.489> should

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
and one-eighth okay so two flat should

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.930 
and one-eighth okay so two flat should
be<00:02:47.599> created<00:02:48.140> like<00:02:48.349> this<00:02:48.680> and<00:02:49.040> then<00:02:49.640> I'm<00:02:49.760> going

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
be created like this and then I'm going

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.050 
be created like this and then I'm going
to<00:02:50.030> turn<00:02:50.239> it<00:02:50.420> around<00:02:51.069> this<00:02:52.069> time<00:02:52.400> I'm<00:02:52.670> going<00:02:52.940> to

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
to turn it around this time I'm going to

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:59.379 
to turn it around this time I'm going to
score<00:02:53.690> at<00:02:53.989> three<00:02:54.319> and<00:02:54.730> 18<00:02:57.609> and<00:02:58.609> then<00:02:58.819> turn<00:02:59.239> that

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:03.859 
around to the non scored corner there's

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:09.220 
around to the non scored corner there's
to<00:03:03.950> be<00:03:03.980> only<00:03:04.159> one<00:03:04.489> left<00:03:04.790> and<00:03:05.859> three<00:03:06.859> and<00:03:07.159> 18<00:03:08.230> so

short flop in like this and then the

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:16.599 
short flop in like this and then the
bottom<00:04:14.180> flood<00:04:14.479> up<00:04:14.750> this<00:04:15.530> is<00:04:15.739> the<00:04:15.889> longer<00:04:16.310> ones

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
part because it's

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.990 
part because it's
too<00:04:25.170> pointy<00:04:25.650> in<00:04:25.710> my<00:04:26.010> liking<00:04:26.460> so<00:04:26.670> I'm<00:04:26.790> just
