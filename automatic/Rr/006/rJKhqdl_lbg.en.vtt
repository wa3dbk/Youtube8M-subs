00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.860
 fits into the team 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.470
 however, it is impossible not to recognize his merits 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.900
 it was his game that helped buzz and reach 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.720

 grand final of the same t-34 but not yet 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.950
 whether it will be final 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.590
 by decision or singsing comes in

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:32.010
 came to an end the reason for this decision 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.530
 became the opinion of the management that there is no point 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:36.690

 The final gdt s4 was held at 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.960
 this and without funny situations the thing is 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.300
 that two players of the cable team reside 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.460
 in north america and therefore part of 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.680
 the match took place on the servers of y.s. of 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.720
 many European teams complained 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.580
 such a decision because most players 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.130
 I had to play with ping far from 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.020
 perfect however in spite of all this 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.570
 the match was more than interesting 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.770
 semifinal bottom grid held between 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.230

 navi and api it was clear that the players 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.900
 hard to play in high ping 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.660
 nevertheless, they were able to win 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:34.240
 victory and sent copy to fight with both 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:36.700

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:38.620
 between games and copy it turned out extremely 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.690
 no one wanted to leave 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.760
 tournament with third place 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:45.160
 but a few mistakes from the game 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.170
 several coups by the comp and 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.570
 the European team went to 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:52.360
 grand final ditch finale natus vincere 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:54.880
 once again showed that they are ready 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:57.640
 Intl to 3, and even despite the fact that 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.740
 the first game are not explicitly mentioned, they were able to 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:03.820
 take three cards in a row and earn 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:06.220
 champion title crash with season 4 2 andy 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:08.110
 prime rick came to the end of the finale 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.670
 faced HIV and gaming and orange 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.660
 which will soon go to 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.760
 international 3 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.680
 unfortunately the teams showed quite 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.140
 mediocre game in the grand final 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.390
 most likely not wanting to reveal the cards 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:23.350
 before the tournament from velv victory with the score 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:25.810

 winners corsair gaming samar 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.280
 but first it is worth noting the final match 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.830
 lower mesh between little sports fanatic 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.780
 the fact is that the decisive game between these 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:37.900
 two teams dragged on a half 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:40.150
 hours it is a game without taking pauses as 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.400
 it turned out that client t2 is not ready for 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.620
 so long games on the map have become 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.480
 appear graphic artifacts on 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.300

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.220
 professional game dota 2 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:53.500

 Faced virtus.pro and Mau Sport 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.600
 both teams showed great game 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.490
 worthy of the final separately worth noting

 who captured the hearts of all viewers 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:07.900
 however little sport turned out to be much 

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:10.090
 stronger virtus as a result with a score 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.550

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.819
