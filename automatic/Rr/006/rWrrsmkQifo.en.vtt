 his difficulties of the last weeks 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:51.400

 Lyon to return to the locker room 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:33.929

 fit on two consecutive victories 

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:37.630
 the men of Rolland Courbis did not 

00:01:35.889 --> 00:01:38.200

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.289
 met 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.569
 but lyon seems very inspired gourcuff 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:44.639
 indented cooks for the strike that 

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:46.450
 just go over 

00:01:44.639 --> 00:01:51.490
 many interesting opportunities 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:53.020
 for the ol still an action with 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.399
 gourcuff the chest pass is 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.149
 countered by second chance defense 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:56.859
 for gourcuff 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:59.770
 this time he can serve a clever 

00:01:56.859 --> 00:02:00.189
 fekir who offers himself a double in the 72nd 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.670
 minute 

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:05.889

 1 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.160
 and watch out for the reaction 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.440
 montpelliÃ©raine with paul lasne who 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.060
 enters the surface the tackle of samuel 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.490
 umtiti he seems to take the ball 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:22.120
 correctly but the referee granted a 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:23.770
 Montpellier penalty barrios 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.220
 can afford a double and raise his 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.470
 team 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.360
 but anthony lopes managed to save 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:31.240
 barrios is not going very well 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.850
 lopes advanced the Portuguese keeper 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.320
 allows his training to keep his 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:38.470
 advantage of two goals a benefit that 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:41.140
 go up to three goals in the 91st minute thanks 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.190
 to corentin tollis at the sixth goal of the 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.140

 the victory is now certain for 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:49.720
 lyon les gones had beaten montpellier 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.850
 5 goals to 1 in the first leg 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.740
 the final score of this return match will be 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.630
 the same because alexandre lacazette him 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:57.780

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:00.580
