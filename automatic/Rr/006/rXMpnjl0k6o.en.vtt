when you press the spacebar key it's

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.860 
when you press the spacebar key it's
going<00:00:49.379> to<00:00:49.680> continue<00:00:50.250> playing<00:00:50.730> and<00:00:51.120> in<00:00:51.780> this

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
move it's just going to loop back and

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.410 
move it's just going to loop back and
hit<00:00:55.260> here<00:00:55.500> again<00:00:55.879> you'll<00:00:56.879> know<00:00:57.000> if<00:00:57.120> it<00:00:57.210> works

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
if when I press my spacebar it's gonna

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.810 
if when I press my spacebar it's gonna
end<00:00:59.609> up<00:01:00.239> here<00:01:00.600> second<00:01:01.410> and<00:01:01.500> a<00:01:01.559> half<00:01:01.590> later<00:01:03.350> so

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.190 
created a new layer that has a frame

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.330 
created a new layer that has a frame
equal<00:01:50.190> to<00:01:50.720> the<00:01:51.720> frame<00:01:52.229> where<00:01:52.440> the<00:01:52.530> guy<00:01:52.679> shouts

hi so on that frame you're going to be
plugging<00:01:56.100> a<00:01:56.220> stop<00:01:56.490> action<00:01:56.759> in<00:01:57.380> which<00:01:58.380> looks

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.550 
to something you have to create an
object<00:02:26.670> that<00:02:27.030> will<00:02:27.120> handle<00:02:27.570> the<00:02:27.780> on<00:02:27.989> command

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
object that will handle the on command

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.340 
object that will handle the on command
because<00:02:28.769> if<00:02:29.160> you<00:02:29.640> just<00:02:29.850> type<00:02:30.000> in<00:02:30.239> on<00:02:30.450> keypress

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
because if you just type in on keypress

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.759 
because if you just type in on keypress
then<00:02:32.040> your<00:02:32.190> command<00:02:32.989> without<00:02:33.989> the<00:02:34.410> button

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
then your command without the button

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:37.759 
then your command without the button
it's<00:02:35.220> going<00:02:35.340> to<00:02:35.989> set<00:02:36.989> up<00:02:37.140> its<00:02:37.380> going<00:02:37.500> to<00:02:37.590> output

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:37.769 
it's going to set up its going to output

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:40.580 
it's going to set up its going to output
an<00:02:38.040> error<00:02:38.250> message<00:02:38.489> saying<00:02:39.000> that<00:02:39.359> it<00:02:40.230> has<00:02:40.440> to

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
an error message saying that it has to

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.580 
an error message saying that it has to
be<00:02:40.680> handled<00:02:40.950> by<00:02:41.130> button<00:02:41.519> so<00:02:42.510> to<00:02:42.570> keep<00:02:42.989> it<00:02:43.230> from

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
be handled by button so to keep it from

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.860 
be handled by button so to keep it from
what<00:02:44.310> you<00:02:44.430> do<00:02:44.579> is<00:02:44.700> just<00:02:44.970> create<00:02:45.329> a<00:02:45.390> button<00:02:45.600> off

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
what you do is just create a button off

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.050 
what you do is just create a button off
the<00:02:46.049> screen<00:02:46.380> that<00:02:47.070> nobody<00:02:47.400> can<00:02:47.579> really<00:02:47.730> see

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
the screen that nobody can really see

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.680 
the screen that nobody can really see
and<00:02:49.100> this<00:02:50.100> is<00:02:50.310> just<00:02:50.430> a<00:02:50.609> black<00:02:51.000> square<00:02:51.329> that<00:02:51.630> I

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
and this is just a black square that I

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.720 
and this is just a black square that I
converted<00:02:52.079> to<00:02:52.260> a<00:02:52.290> button<00:02:52.620> symbol<00:02:52.859> by<00:02:53.130> simply

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
converted to a button symbol by simply

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.940 
converted to a button symbol by simply
going<00:02:53.880> to<00:02:54.180> modify<00:02:54.660> convert<00:02:55.170> to<00:02:55.440> symbol<00:02:55.620> and

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
going to modify convert to symbol and

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.240 
going to modify convert to symbol and
choosing<00:02:56.280> button<00:02:56.609> and<00:02:57.600> then<00:02:57.720> on<00:02:57.750> that<00:02:57.989> button

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
choosing button and then on that button

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.890 
choosing button and then on that button
we<00:02:59.250> have<00:02:59.370> this<00:02:59.489> script<00:02:59.850> which<00:03:00.090> just<00:03:00.390> says<00:03:00.600> that

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
we have this script which just says that

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.170 
we have this script which just says that
when<00:03:01.620> the<00:03:01.739> person<00:03:02.160> presses<00:03:02.519> the<00:03:02.640> spacebar<00:03:03.150> on

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
when the person presses the spacebar on

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.490 
when the person presses the spacebar on
the<00:03:03.269> keyboard<00:03:03.359> the<00:03:03.840> movie<00:03:04.079> is<00:03:04.140> going<00:03:04.260> to<00:03:04.320> keep

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
the keyboard the movie is going to keep

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:10.460 
the keyboard the movie is going to keep
playing<00:03:05.030> pretty<00:03:06.030> simple<00:03:06.540> so<00:03:09.290> I'm<00:03:10.290> going<00:03:10.440> to

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
playing pretty simple so I'm going to

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.069 
playing pretty simple so I'm going to
copy<00:03:10.709> this<00:03:11.070> and<00:03:11.340> put<00:03:12.060> it<00:03:12.180> on<00:03:12.329> the<00:03:12.359> buttons<00:03:12.930> come

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:13.079 
copy this and put it on the buttons come

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:15.140 
copy this and put it on the buttons come
in<00:03:13.320> so<00:03:13.530> select<00:03:13.859> the<00:03:13.980> button<00:03:14.100> open<00:03:14.730> the<00:03:14.820> actions

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
in so select the button open the actions

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.630 
in so select the button open the actions
window<00:03:15.560> pop<00:03:16.560> that<00:03:16.799> command<00:03:17.160> in<00:03:17.280> there<00:03:17.430> and<00:03:17.549> it

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
window pop that command in there and it

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.450 
window pop that command in there and it
should<00:03:18.000> work

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:19.460 
should work

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:24.820 
should work
and<00:03:21.640> if<00:03:22.640> you<00:03:22.850> test<00:03:23.120> it<00:03:23.270> it's<00:03:23.690> going<00:03:23.930> to<00:03:23.990> start

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:24.830 
and if you test it it's going to start

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.810 
and if you test it it's going to start
off<00:03:24.950> BAM<00:03:25.730> he<00:03:26.090> shouts<00:03:26.360> high<00:03:26.540> and<00:03:26.810> it<00:03:26.870> stops

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:27.820 
off BAM he shouts high and it stops

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:29.590 
off BAM he shouts high and it stops
basically<00:03:28.820> what<00:03:28.940> you're<00:03:29.000> going<00:03:29.150> to<00:03:29.210> do<00:03:29.300> is<00:03:29.450> you

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:29.600 
basically what you're going to do is you

basically what you're going to do is you
press<00:03:30.290> the<00:03:30.470> key<00:03:30.650> the<00:03:30.980> space<00:03:31.580> bar<00:03:31.790> in<00:03:31.940> it

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
press the key the space bar in it

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.850 
press the key the space bar in it
continue<00:03:32.810> playing<00:03:33.020> and<00:03:33.140> you<00:03:33.290> end<00:03:33.440> up<00:03:33.500> looping

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:33.860 
continue playing and you end up looping

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:36.340 
continue playing and you end up looping
back<00:03:34.360> so<00:03:35.360> within<00:03:35.540> your<00:03:35.750> movie<00:03:36.110> when<00:03:36.260> the

back so within your movie when the
people<00:03:36.500> do<00:03:36.800> that<00:03:36.980> like<00:03:37.040> if<00:03:37.520> you're<00:03:37.940> going<00:03:38.030> to

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
people do that like if you're going to

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:39.820 
people do that like if you're going to
have<00:03:38.270> a<00:03:38.330> keyboard<00:03:38.900> commands<00:03:39.440> you<00:03:39.530> might<00:03:39.650> want

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:39.830 
have a keyboard commands you might want

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:42.430 
have a keyboard commands you might want
to<00:03:39.890> make<00:03:39.980> a<00:03:40.010> little<00:03:40.310> footnote<00:03:40.580> like<00:03:41.440> really

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440 
to make a little footnote like really

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:57.390 
to make a little footnote like really
small<00:03:43.000> saying<00:03:44.290> press<00:03:45.340> spacebar<00:03:46.340> to<00:03:46.730> continue

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.720 

so<00:03:59.350> that's<00:04:00.350> basically<00:04:00.560> all<00:04:00.920> you<00:04:01.370> have<00:04:01.490> to<00:04:01.610> do

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
keypress what it actually will do is

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:11.170 
keypress what it actually will do is
it'll<00:04:08.830> when<00:04:09.830> once<00:04:10.160> you<00:04:10.280> type<00:04:10.460> in<00:04:10.640> key<00:04:10.880> press

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
it'll when once you type in key press

it'll when once you type in key press
it's<00:04:11.360> going<00:04:11.540> to<00:04:11.660> list<00:04:12.380> down<00:04:12.620> a<00:04:12.650> bunch<00:04:12.980> of

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:13.100 
it's going to list down a bunch of

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:15.300 
it's going to list down a bunch of
different<00:04:13.250> keys<00:04:13.640> that<00:04:13.850> you<00:04:13.880> can<00:04:14.120> use<00:04:14.330> and

different keys that you can use and
really<00:04:16.310> you<00:04:16.430> can<00:04:16.489> use<00:04:16.730> anything<00:04:17.120> like<00:04:18.110> you<00:04:18.530> can

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:18.710 
really you can use anything like you can

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:21.520 
really you can use anything like you can
use<00:04:18.860> this<00:04:19.040> to<00:04:19.250> create<00:04:19.460> slideshows<00:04:20.320> using<00:04:21.320> gold

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
use this to create slideshows using gold

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:25.540 
use this to create slideshows using gold
arrow<00:04:21.770> keys<00:04:23.800> anything<00:04:24.800> you<00:04:24.890> really<00:04:25.040> can<00:04:25.280> think

arrow keys anything you really can think
of<00:04:25.760> that<00:04:26.000> will<00:04:26.180> work<00:04:26.930> will<00:04:27.860> most<00:04:28.100> likely<00:04:28.340> go

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:28.640 
of that will work will most likely go

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.940 
of that will work will most likely go
right<00:04:29.090> with<00:04:29.300> this<00:04:29.510> so<00:04:29.780> this<00:04:30.470> is<00:04:30.620> just<00:04:30.710> another

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:30.950 
right with this so this is just another

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.190 
right with this so this is just another
way<00:04:31.190> to<00:04:31.220> control<00:04:31.640> your<00:04:31.790> movies<00:04:32.180> or<00:04:32.360> however

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 
you really want to do it this is one way

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.760 
you really want to do it this is one way
to<00:04:35.990> do<00:04:36.170> it<00:04:36.200> some<00:04:36.470> people<00:04:36.740> do<00:04:36.860> it<00:04:37.010> but<00:04:38.770> that's
