00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
bunzy has got decent card i guess like

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.789

84<00:01:14.640> diamond<00:01:15.000> 84<00:01:15.390> reflexes<00:01:15.990> but<00:01:16.439> i<00:01:16.470> wouldn't

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
84 diamond 84 reflexes but i wouldn't

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.130 
84 diamond 84 reflexes but i wouldn't
say<00:01:16.920> that<00:01:16.950> was<00:01:17.220> 85<00:01:17.670> card<00:01:18.000> really<00:01:18.479> worthy<00:01:18.720> I

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140
