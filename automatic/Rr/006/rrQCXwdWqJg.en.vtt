on<00:00:00.390> the<00:00:00.659> fence<00:00:00.900> on<00:00:01.110> whether<00:00:01.140> you<00:00:01.560> should<00:00:01.620> buy

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:01.860 
on the fence on whether you should buy

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.370 
on the fence on whether you should buy
house<00:00:02.100> or<00:00:02.399> not<00:00:02.580> this<00:00:03.389> is<00:00:03.540> a<00:00:03.570> latke<00:00:03.870> price<00:00:04.110> tag

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
house or not this is a latke price tag

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:10.970 
house or not this is a latke price tag
with<00:00:04.680> five<00:00:04.950> reasons<00:00:05.430> why<00:00:05.580> you<00:00:05.640> shouldn't<00:00:09.980> so

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
with five reasons why you shouldn't so

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.740 
with five reasons why you shouldn't so
the<00:00:11.280> first<00:00:11.519> reason<00:00:11.759> why<00:00:12.030> you<00:00:12.090> shouldn't<00:00:12.450> might

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
the first reason why you shouldn't might

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.169 
the first reason why you shouldn't might
as<00:00:13.019> well<00:00:13.290> is<00:00:13.620> because<00:00:13.980> of<00:00:14.160> running<00:00:14.490> really

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
as well is because of running really

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.650 
as well is because of running really
really<00:00:15.630> hot<00:00:16.340> not<00:00:17.340> to<00:00:17.550> say<00:00:17.760> that<00:00:18.029> the<00:00:18.210> cpu

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
really hot not to say that the cpu

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.480 
really hot not to say that the cpu
inherently<00:00:19.670> generates<00:00:20.670> a<00:00:20.880> lot<00:00:21.060> of<00:00:21.090> heat<00:00:21.470> but

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:22.490 
inherently generates a lot of heat but

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.460 
inherently generates a lot of heat but
the<00:00:23.490> cores<00:00:23.850> are<00:00:24.060> so<00:00:24.269> close<00:00:24.600> together<00:00:25.080> in<00:00:25.439> the

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
the cores are so close together in the

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.400 
the cores are so close together in the
transistors<00:00:26.220> that<00:00:26.250> it<00:00:26.849> produces<00:00:27.420> heat<00:00:27.449> faster

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
transistors that it produces heat faster

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.380 
transistors that it produces heat faster
than<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:28.710> surface<00:00:29.160> area<00:00:29.490> can<00:00:29.699> dissipate<00:00:30.179> it

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
than the surface area can dissipate it

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.549 
than the surface area can dissipate it
so<00:00:31.130> it<00:00:32.130> runs<00:00:32.369> really<00:00:32.610> hot<00:00:33.079> reason<00:00:34.079> number<00:00:34.230> two

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
so it runs really hot reason number two

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.500 
so it runs really hot reason number two
while<00:00:34.890> you<00:00:35.010> shouldn't<00:00:35.399> buy<00:00:35.550> as<00:00:35.820> well<00:00:35.850> is

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
while you shouldn't buy as well is

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.350 
while you shouldn't buy as well is
because<00:00:36.570> they<00:00:37.230> have<00:00:37.350> moved<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.980> vrm<00:00:38.610> voltage

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
because they have moved the vrm voltage

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.020 
because they have moved the vrm voltage
regulator<00:00:39.780> modules<00:00:40.520> from<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.760> motherboard

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
regulator modules from the motherboard

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.590 
regulator modules from the motherboard
onto<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:42.989> cpu<00:00:43.530> so<00:00:44.219> basically<00:00:44.850> instead<00:00:45.329> of

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
onto the cpu so basically instead of

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.630 
onto the cpu so basically instead of
your<00:00:45.809> motherboard<00:00:46.140> determining<00:00:46.920> how<00:00:47.309> well

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
your motherboard determining how well

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.360 
your motherboard determining how well
you<00:00:47.850> can<00:00:47.969> overclock<00:00:48.360> now<00:00:49.320> your<00:00:49.620> cpu

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
you can overclock now your cpu

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.069 
you can overclock now your cpu
determines<00:00:50.969> how<00:00:51.120> well<00:00:51.329> your<00:00:51.510> CPU<00:00:51.899> can

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
determines how well your CPU can

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.680 
determines how well your CPU can
overclock<00:00:52.440> and<00:00:52.980> it<00:00:53.430> comes<00:00:53.670> all<00:00:54.030> down<00:00:54.480> to

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
overclock and it comes all down to

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.450

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
mind reason number three why has well

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.130 
mind reason number three why has well
sucks<00:01:07.080> and<00:01:08.040> it's<00:01:08.189> a<00:01:08.250> higher<00:01:08.490> TVP<00:01:09.210> than<00:01:09.479> ivy<00:01:09.869> Ivy

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
sucks and it's a higher TVP than ivy Ivy

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.890 
sucks and it's a higher TVP than ivy Ivy

design power and basically what that

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.620 
design power and basically what that
means<00:01:20.159> is<00:01:20.970> one<00:01:21.390> I<00:01:21.420> can<00:01:21.720> run<00:01:21.869> hotter<00:01:22.140> which<00:01:23.040> I

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
means is one I can run hotter which I

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.179 
means is one I can run hotter which I
really<00:01:24.630> run<00:01:24.960> around<00:01:25.110> around<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.920> same

typically<00:02:23.330> per<00:02:23.569> chip<00:02:24.069> you<00:02:25.069> can<00:02:25.280> achieve<00:02:25.370> total

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
typically per chip you can achieve total

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:28.990

as<00:02:33.080> well<00:02:33.319> as<00:02:33.470> better<00:02:33.680> but<00:02:33.980> sometimes<00:02:34.340> it<00:02:34.880> can

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
as well as better but sometimes it can

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.420 
as well as better but sometimes it can
perform<00:02:35.269> worse<00:02:35.870> and<00:02:36.440> that<00:02:36.739> is<00:02:36.920> completely

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
perform worse and that is completely

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.270 
perform worse and that is completely
unacceptable<00:02:38.000> in<00:02:38.420> my<00:02:38.450> mind<00:02:38.830> so<00:02:39.830> that<00:02:39.980> was<00:02:40.099> my

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
unacceptable in my mind so that was my

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.790 
unacceptable in my mind so that was my
top<00:02:40.580> five<00:02:40.880> reasons<00:02:40.910> why<00:02:41.390> I<00:02:41.840> think<00:02:42.200> has<00:02:42.470> what

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
top five reasons why I think has what

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.970 
top five reasons why I think has what
kind<00:02:43.069> of<00:02:43.280> sucks<00:02:43.580> I<00:02:44.200> know<00:02:45.200> a<00:02:45.380> lot<00:02:45.590> of<00:02:45.709> people

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
kind of sucks I know a lot of people

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.949 
kind of sucks I know a lot of people
might<00:02:46.130> be<00:02:46.160> arguing<00:02:46.730> against<00:02:47.180> me<00:02:47.360> that<00:02:47.720> there's

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
might be arguing against me that there's

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:49.930 
might be arguing against me that there's
a<00:02:48.019> lot<00:02:48.080> of<00:02:48.200> positives<00:02:48.799> and<00:02:49.160> I<00:02:49.310> agree<00:02:49.610> there<00:02:49.910> are

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
a lot of positives and I agree there are

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.780 
a lot of positives and I agree there are
I<00:02:50.450> think<00:02:51.230> even<00:02:51.950> more<00:02:52.160> positives<00:02:52.700> than

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
I think even more positives than

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.559 
I think even more positives than
negatives<00:02:53.110> but<00:02:54.110> the<00:02:54.290> negatives<00:02:54.769> are<00:02:55.160> more

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:55.569 
negatives but the negatives are more

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:59.350 
negatives but the negatives are more
buried<00:02:56.569> than<00:02:57.170> the<00:02:57.349> positives<00:02:57.860> you<00:02:58.220> know<00:02:58.400> chip

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
buried than the positives you know chip

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.309
