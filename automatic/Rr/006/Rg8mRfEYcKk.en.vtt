giant plant eater like a Brachiosaurus

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.319 
giant plant eater like a Brachiosaurus
the<00:00:40.110> named<00:00:40.260> sauropod<00:00:40.800> means<00:00:41.070> lizard<00:00:41.579> foot<00:00:41.850> is

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
the named sauropod means lizard foot is

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.119 
the named sauropod means lizard foot is
then<00:00:42.510> harried<00:00:42.899> her<00:00:42.989> back<00:00:43.170> yep<00:00:43.590> all<00:00:43.950> right

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
then harried her back yep all right

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.160 
then harried her back yep all right
anyway<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.940> fossils<00:00:45.360> are<00:00:45.450> headed<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:45.750> Museum

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
anyway the fossils are headed to Museum

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.750 
anyway the fossils are headed to Museum
on<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.770> other<00:00:47.010> side<00:00:47.309> of<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.460> world

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
on the other side of the world

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.880 
on the other side of the world
an<00:00:47.899> excavation<00:00:48.899> site<00:00:49.200> has<00:00:49.379> yielded<00:00:49.559> some

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
an excavation site has yielded some

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.799 
an excavation site has yielded some
promising<00:00:50.370> specimens<00:00:50.850> so<00:00:51.420> how<00:00:51.600> did<00:00:51.750> these

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
promising specimens so how did these

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.240 
promising specimens so how did these
dinosaurs<00:00:52.350> get<00:00:52.500> stuck<00:00:52.710> in<00:00:52.829> this<00:00:52.920> location

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
dinosaurs get stuck in this location

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.340 
dinosaurs get stuck in this location
looks<00:00:54.120> like<00:00:54.270> a<00:00:54.300> mudslide<00:00:54.899> killed<00:00:55.230> them

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
looks like a mudslide killed them

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.900 
looks like a mudslide killed them
because<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.739> fossils<00:00:56.190> that<00:00:56.219> were<00:00:56.370> found<00:00:56.640> are

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
because the fossils that were found are

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.540 
because the fossils that were found are
very<00:00:57.600> well<00:00:57.870> preserved<00:00:58.230> to<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:58.949> point<00:00:59.219> that

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
very well preserved to the point that

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.099 
very well preserved to the point that
the<00:00:59.699> brain<00:01:00.000> structure<00:01:00.480> of<00:01:00.539> these<00:01:00.629> dinosaurs

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
the brain structure of these dinosaurs

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.410 
the brain structure of these dinosaurs
can<00:01:01.410> be<00:01:01.559> studied<00:01:01.820> let's<00:01:02.820> talk<00:01:02.969> about<00:01:03.090> marine

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
can be studied let's talk about marine

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.020 
can be studied let's talk about marine
dinosaurs<00:01:03.930> any<00:01:04.199> objections<00:01:04.710> nope<00:01:05.250> all<00:01:05.820> right

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
dinosaurs any objections nope all right

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.000 
dinosaurs any objections nope all right
good<00:01:06.240> mosasaurs<00:01:07.200> were<00:01:07.350> thought<00:01:07.530> to<00:01:07.560> move<00:01:07.860> in

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
good mosasaurs were thought to move in

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.590 
good mosasaurs were thought to move in
the<00:01:08.070> water<00:01:08.250> like<00:01:08.490> an<00:01:08.640> eels<00:01:08.880> so<00:01:09.360> we're<00:01:09.450> talking

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
the water like an eels so we're talking

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.500 
the water like an eels so we're talking
about<00:01:09.810> a<00:01:10.020> snaking<00:01:10.979> slithery<00:01:11.670> kind<00:01:12.090> of<00:01:12.210> motion

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
about a snaking slithery kind of motion

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.270 
about a snaking slithery kind of motion
some<00:01:13.110> new<00:01:13.260> research<00:01:13.619> based<00:01:13.860> on<00:01:13.979> what<00:01:14.070> is<00:01:14.159> being

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
some new research based on what is being

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.070 
some new research based on what is being
called<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.670> finest<00:01:15.060> specimen<00:01:15.570> of<00:01:15.659> a<00:01:15.720> mosasaur

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
called the finest specimen of a mosasaur

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.249 
called the finest specimen of a mosasaur
says<00:01:16.950> they<00:01:17.220> move<00:01:17.460> more<00:01:17.700> like<00:01:17.909> a<00:01:17.939> shark<00:01:18.270> so<00:01:19.080> how

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
says they move more like a shark so how

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.289 
says they move more like a shark so how
is<00:01:19.409> this<00:01:19.530> figured<00:01:19.830> out<00:01:19.950> it<00:01:20.220> had<00:01:20.729> a<00:01:20.759> specialized
