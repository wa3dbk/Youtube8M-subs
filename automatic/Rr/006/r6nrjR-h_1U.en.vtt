is the same hair that I've been wearing

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.520 
is the same hair that I've been wearing
my<00:00:38.340> last<00:00:38.579> soin<00:00:39.000> that<00:00:39.149> I<00:00:39.180> had<00:00:39.480> I<00:00:39.840> literally<00:00:40.260> had

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
my last soin that I had I literally had

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.770 
my last soin that I had I literally had
heard<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:41.219> last<00:00:41.430> one<00:00:41.640> I<00:00:41.670> had<00:00:41.969> was<00:00:42.149> of<00:00:42.329> an<00:00:42.420> 18

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
heard the last one I had was of an 18

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.590 
heard the last one I had was of an 18
inch<00:00:42.930> in<00:00:43.020> a<00:00:43.110> 20<00:00:43.379> inch<00:00:43.530> it<00:00:44.129> was<00:00:44.250> 250<00:00:44.940> grams<00:00:45.180> and

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
inch in a 20 inch it was 250 grams and

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.569 
inch in a 20 inch it was 250 grams and
it<00:00:46.170> came<00:00:46.289> in<00:00:46.469> three<00:00:46.800> bundles<00:00:47.010> one<00:00:47.430> was

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
it came in three bundles one was

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.250 
it came in three bundles one was
significantly<00:00:48.239> smaller<00:00:48.600> than<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.809> others<00:00:49.110> I

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
significantly smaller than the others I

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.529 
significantly smaller than the others I
guess<00:00:49.410> to<00:00:49.590> make<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.860> extra<00:00:50.190> 40<00:00:50.579> grams<00:00:50.820> versus

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
guess to make the extra 40 grams versus

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.380 
guess to make the extra 40 grams versus
because<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.320> original<00:00:52.890> packages<00:00:53.520> were<00:00:53.640> 210

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
because the original packages were 210

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.590 
because the original packages were 210
grams<00:00:54.660> and<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:56.010> other<00:00:56.190> packages<00:00:56.610> are<00:00:56.730> 250<00:00:57.390> I

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
grams and the other packages are 250 I

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.020 
grams and the other packages are 250 I
suggest<00:00:58.469> getting<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.859> 250<00:00:59.640> if<00:00:59.730> you<00:00:59.850> have<00:01:00.000> a

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
suggest getting the 250 if you have a

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.130 
suggest getting the 250 if you have a
big<00:01:00.359> head<00:01:00.600> like<00:01:00.629> mine<00:01:02.030> because<00:01:03.030> you<00:01:03.690> know<00:01:03.899> it

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
big head like mine because you know it

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.050 
big head like mine because you know it
takes<00:01:04.320> a<00:01:04.439> lot<00:01:04.589> of<00:01:04.619> hair<00:01:04.860> to<00:01:04.890> fill<00:01:05.430> my<00:01:05.580> head<00:01:05.729> up

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
takes a lot of hair to fill my head up

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.109 
takes a lot of hair to fill my head up
so<00:01:06.540> I<00:01:06.900> suggest<00:01:07.680> getting<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:08.070> 250<00:01:08.760> Kris<00:01:08.939> is<00:01:09.090> the
