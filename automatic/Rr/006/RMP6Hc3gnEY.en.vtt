here<00:01:02.239> we<00:01:02.420> have<00:01:02.540> the<00:01:02.660> mid<00:01:02.840> mic<00:01:03.080> coming<00:01:03.380> in<00:01:03.590> on

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680 
here we have the mid mic coming in on

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.800 
here we have the mid mic coming in on
one<00:01:03.890> channel<00:01:04.339> and<00:01:04.489> the<00:01:04.760> side<00:01:05.030> mic<00:01:05.270> bolted<00:01:05.720> to

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
one channel and the side mic bolted to

one channel and the side mic bolted to
two<00:01:05.990> channels<00:01:06.440> the<00:01:07.130> mic<00:01:07.310> free<00:01:07.550> game<00:01:07.760> for<00:01:07.790> both

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
two channels the mic free game for both

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.510 
two channels the mic free game for both
mics<00:01:08.540> except<00:01:08.960> the<00:01:09.080> same<00:01:09.380> but<00:01:10.070> because<00:01:10.340> the

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
mics except the same but because the

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.550 
mics except the same but because the
side<00:01:10.760> mic<00:01:11.030> is<00:01:11.210> off<00:01:11.390> axis<00:01:11.960> you'll<00:01:12.140> notice<00:01:12.440> it

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
side mic is off axis you'll notice it

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.190 
side mic is off axis you'll notice it
meters<00:01:12.830> a<00:01:12.860> little<00:01:13.369> bit<00:01:13.550> lower<00:01:13.900> with<00:01:14.900> the<00:01:14.930> mid

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
meters a little bit lower with the mid

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.930 
meters a little bit lower with the mid
mic<00:01:15.410> you<00:01:15.590> basically<00:01:15.979> have<00:01:16.160> a<00:01:16.220> nice<00:01:16.490> sounding

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:16.940 
mic you basically have a nice sounding

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:21.700 
mic you basically have a nice sounding
mono<00:01:17.330> room<00:01:17.720> mic<00:01:19.900> now<00:01:20.900> let's<00:01:21.200> hear<00:01:21.380> the<00:01:21.410> side

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
mono room mic now let's hear the side

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:23.950 
mono room mic now let's hear the side
mic<00:01:21.950> the<00:01:22.820> reason<00:01:23.150> we<00:01:23.240> have<00:01:23.360> the<00:01:23.509> side<00:01:23.720> white

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
mic the reason we have the side white

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.780 
mic the reason we have the side white
bolted<00:01:24.380> to<00:01:24.470> two<00:01:24.650> channels<00:01:25.160> is<00:01:25.310> because<00:01:25.670> they

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790 
bolted to two channels is because they

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:27.850 
bolted to two channels is because they
need<00:01:26.000> to<00:01:26.030> be<00:01:26.180> panned<00:01:26.509> hard<00:01:26.720> left<00:01:26.990> and<00:01:27.590> far

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
need to be panned hard left and far

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.340 
need to be panned hard left and far
right<00:01:28.270> notice<00:01:29.270> that<00:01:29.420> it<00:01:29.570> still<00:01:29.869> sounds

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
right notice that it still sounds

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.520 
right notice that it still sounds
monotone<00:01:31.009> here's<00:01:31.940> where<00:01:32.180> it<00:01:32.270> gets<00:01:32.479> funky<00:01:32.750> we

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
monotone here's where it gets funky we

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.580 
monotone here's where it gets funky we
flip<00:01:33.890> the<00:01:34.070> right<00:01:34.340> side<00:01:34.670> out<00:01:34.970> of<00:01:35.240> phase<00:01:35.530> now<00:01:36.530> we

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
flip the right side out of phase now we

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.770 
flip the right side out of phase now we
have<00:01:36.830> a<00:01:36.860> very<00:01:37.130> wide<00:01:37.490> but<00:01:37.820> mostly<00:01:38.180> out<00:01:38.360> of<00:01:38.570> phase

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
have a very wide but mostly out of phase

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.660 
have a very wide but mostly out of phase
stereo<00:01:39.380> image<00:01:41.710> here's<00:01:42.710> where<00:01:43.010> the<00:01:43.159> magic

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
stereo image here's where the magic

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.790 
stereo image here's where the magic
happens<00:01:46.150> we<00:01:47.150> bring<00:01:47.360> the<00:01:47.510> mid<00:01:47.720> mic<00:01:47.930> back<00:01:48.260> up<00:01:48.560> and

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:48.800 
happens we bring the mid mic back up and

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.390 
happens we bring the mid mic back up and
we<00:01:49.159> get<00:01:49.310> a<00:01:49.370> big<00:01:49.760> full<00:01:50.510> phase<00:01:51.080> coherent<00:01:51.860> stereo

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:52.400 
we get a big full phase coherent stereo

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.940 
we get a big full phase coherent stereo
image<00:01:52.850> and<00:01:53.210> we<00:01:53.900> can<00:01:53.930> control<00:01:54.380> the<00:01:54.620> width<00:01:54.800> of

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
image and we can control the width of

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.890 
image and we can control the width of
this<00:01:55.100> image<00:01:55.460> by<00:01:55.640> adjusting<00:01:56.180> the<00:01:56.300> balance<00:01:56.510> of

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:56.900 
this image by adjusting the balance of

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:05.469 
this image by adjusting the balance of
the<00:01:57.080> mids<00:01:57.380> and<00:01:57.620> sizes<00:02:03.729> for<00:02:04.729> drums<00:02:05.060> the<00:02:05.330> most

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
the mids and sizes for drums the most

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:07.810 
the mids and sizes for drums the most

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.660 

now<00:02:33.410> we're<00:02:33.620> going<00:02:33.710> to<00:02:33.770> break<00:02:33.980> some<00:02:34.190> rules<00:02:34.370> by

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
now we're going to break some rules by

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.210 
now we're going to break some rules by
using<00:02:34.700> a<00:02:35.090> mismatched<00:02:35.540> pair<00:02:35.900> of<00:02:35.990> microphones

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
using a mismatched pair of microphones

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.740 
using a mismatched pair of microphones
we've<00:02:37.220> done<00:02:37.490> this<00:02:37.610> on<00:02:37.820> the<00:02:37.850> show<00:02:38.120> before<00:02:38.300> where

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
we've done this on the show before where

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.990 
we've done this on the show before where
we've<00:02:38.900> replaced<00:02:39.290> our<00:02:39.530> side<00:02:39.830> microphone<00:02:40.490> with

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
we've replaced our side microphone with

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.480 
we've replaced our side microphone with
the<00:02:41.030> Cascade<00:02:41.630> Fathead<00:02:42.200> -<00:02:42.410> ribbon<00:02:42.800> mic<00:02:42.980> which

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:45.820 
the Cascade Fathead - ribbon mic which
will<00:02:43.670> give<00:02:43.820> us<00:02:43.940> a<00:02:44.060> smooth<00:02:44.540> silky<00:02:45.140> top<00:02:45.350> end<00:02:45.650> and

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
will give us a smooth silky top end and

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.360 
will give us a smooth silky top end and
now<00:02:46.520> we<00:02:46.580> have<00:02:46.910> an<00:02:47.030> audio<00:02:47.300> technica<00:02:47.920> 4047<00:02:48.920> for
