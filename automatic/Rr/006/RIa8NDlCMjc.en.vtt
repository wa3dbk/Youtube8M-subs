00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:24.490 
out of this cold all right so today I'm

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:27.089 
out of this cold all right so today I'm
going<00:00:24.640> to<00:00:24.699> talk<00:00:24.849> about<00:00:25.329> salt<00:00:26.079> retention<00:00:26.230> and

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:27.099 
going to talk about salt retention and

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:30.870 
going to talk about salt retention and
I'm<00:00:27.999> gonna<00:00:28.210> sit<00:00:28.449> on<00:00:28.480> this<00:00:28.749> stump<00:00:29.169> and<00:00:29.880> I

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:30.880 
I'm gonna sit on this stump and I

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.580 
I'm gonna sit on this stump and I
decided<00:00:31.539> I've<00:00:31.839> never<00:00:32.020> really<00:00:32.290> talked<00:00:32.500> about

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:32.590 
decided I've never really talked about

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.639 
decided I've never really talked about
soul<00:00:33.100> retention<00:00:33.579> in<00:00:33.850> my<00:00:34.540> videos<00:00:34.870> before<00:00:35.440> or

00:00:35.639 --> 00:00:35.649 
soul retention in my videos before or

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:38.520 
soul retention in my videos before or
like<00:00:36.090> sodium<00:00:37.090> intake<00:00:37.660> ever<00:00:37.930> had<00:00:38.140> just<00:00:38.289> haven't

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:38.530 
like sodium intake ever had just haven't

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.619 
like sodium intake ever had just haven't
addressed<00:00:38.710> it<00:00:39.070> and<00:00:40.000> that's<00:00:40.210> probably<00:00:40.449> because

00:00:40.619 --> 00:00:40.629 
addressed it and that's probably because

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:44.099 
addressed it and that's probably because
I<00:00:40.809> basically<00:00:41.590> ate<00:00:42.210> for<00:00:43.210> the<00:00:43.269> last<00:00:43.480> like<00:00:43.750> six

00:00:44.099 --> 00:00:44.109 
I basically ate for the last like six

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:46.049 
I basically ate for the last like six
months<00:00:44.260> probably<00:00:44.649> I've<00:00:45.280> basically<00:00:45.550> eaten

00:00:46.049 --> 00:00:46.059 
months probably I've basically eaten

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:48.540 
months probably I've basically eaten
like<00:00:46.300> the<00:00:46.750> salt<00:00:47.019> that<00:00:47.170> I<00:00:47.230> wanted<00:00:47.980> really<00:00:48.370> I

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:48.550 
like the salt that I wanted really I

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:50.400 
like the salt that I wanted really I
haven't<00:00:49.030> really<00:00:49.390> paid<00:00:49.989> a<00:00:50.050> lot<00:00:50.260> of<00:00:50.289> attention

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:50.410 
haven't really paid a lot of attention

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.520 
haven't really paid a lot of attention
to<00:00:50.739> it<00:00:50.940> I've<00:00:51.940> tried<00:00:52.000> to<00:00:52.390> use<00:00:52.600> like<00:00:52.960> Himalayan

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:53.530 
to it I've tried to use like Himalayan

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.740 
to it I've tried to use like Himalayan
sea<00:00:53.800> salt<00:00:53.829> or<00:00:54.339> organic<00:00:54.609> sea<00:00:54.940> salt<00:00:55.179> wherever

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:55.750 
sea salt or organic sea salt wherever

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.810 
sea salt or organic sea salt wherever
possible<00:00:55.989> but<00:00:56.620> it<00:00:57.219> hasn't<00:00:57.550> been<00:00:57.609> something

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:57.820 
possible but it hasn't been something

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.549 
possible but it hasn't been something
that<00:00:58.000> I<00:00:58.030> paid<00:00:58.269> a<00:00:58.300> lot<00:00:58.449> of<00:00:58.480> attention<00:00:58.539> to<00:00:58.960> so<00:00:59.530> I

00:00:59.549 --> 00:00:59.559 
that I paid a lot of attention to so I

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:01.560 
that I paid a lot of attention to so I
was<00:00:59.949> going<00:01:00.100> through<00:01:00.219> some<00:01:00.399> videos<00:01:00.730> from<00:01:01.179> like

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:01.570 
was going through some videos from like

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:03.479 
was going through some videos from like
three<00:01:02.079> months<00:01:02.499> ago<00:01:02.589> maybe<00:01:02.980> a<00:01:03.070> little<00:01:03.219> bit<00:01:03.370> more

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:03.489 
three months ago maybe a little bit more

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:08.700 
three months ago maybe a little bit more
than<00:01:03.640> that<00:01:03.760> and<00:01:04.260> I<00:01:05.730> found<00:01:07.259> like<00:01:08.259> a<00:01:08.290> before<00:01:08.590> and

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:08.710 
than that and I found like a before and

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.920 
than that and I found like a before and
after<00:01:08.829> video<00:01:09.220> that<00:01:09.520> I<00:01:09.549> did<00:01:09.820> the<00:01:10.240> before<00:01:10.630> video

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:10.930 
after video that I did the before video

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.850 
after video that I did the before video
being<00:01:11.259> um<00:01:12.750> basically<00:01:13.750> at<00:01:14.200> a<00:01:14.229> time<00:01:14.470> when<00:01:14.650> I<00:01:14.680> was

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860 
being um basically at a time when I was

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.550 
being um basically at a time when I was
eating<00:01:15.100> anywhere<00:01:15.610> from<00:01:15.850> like<00:01:16.110> 1,500<00:01:17.110> to<00:01:17.350> like

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 
eating anywhere from like 1,500 to like

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.889 
eating anywhere from like 1,500 to like
even<00:01:18.100> upwards<00:01:18.399> of<00:01:18.700> 3,000<00:01:19.299> milligrams<00:01:19.540> of

00:01:19.889 --> 00:01:19.899 
even upwards of 3,000 milligrams of

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:22.340 
even upwards of 3,000 milligrams of
sodium<00:01:20.110> per<00:01:20.619> day<00:01:20.649> and<00:01:21.070> a<00:01:21.159> lot<00:01:21.369> of<00:01:21.399> that<00:01:21.610> was

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
sodium per day and a lot of that was

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.660 
sodium per day and a lot of that was
like<00:01:23.350> just<00:01:23.979> table<00:01:24.280> salt<00:01:24.490> from<00:01:25.240> condiments<00:01:26.229> and

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
like just table salt from condiments and

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.780 
like just table salt from condiments and
dining<00:01:27.670> out<00:01:27.790> quite<00:01:28.090> a<00:01:28.119> bit<00:01:28.180> which<00:01:28.479> I<00:01:28.600> was<00:01:28.750> doing

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
dining out quite a bit which I was doing

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.209 
dining out quite a bit which I was doing
and<00:01:30.990> when<00:01:31.990> I<00:01:32.020> first<00:01:32.320> came<00:01:32.469> to<00:01:32.530> the<00:01:32.710> lifestyle<00:01:33.040> I

00:01:33.209 --> 00:01:33.219 
and when I first came to the lifestyle I

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:34.889 
and when I first came to the lifestyle I
made<00:01:33.430> a<00:01:33.460> real<00:01:33.729> conscious<00:01:34.149> effort<00:01:34.420> to<00:01:34.509> keep<00:01:34.780> my

00:01:34.889 --> 00:01:34.899 
made a real conscious effort to keep my

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:37.230 
made a real conscious effort to keep my
sodium<00:01:35.320> down<00:01:35.649> because<00:01:36.040> you<00:01:36.850> know<00:01:36.939> I<00:01:36.969> really

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
sodium down because you know I really

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.310 
sodium down because you know I really
wanted<00:01:37.420> to<00:01:37.479> be<00:01:37.630> successful<00:01:38.140> in<00:01:38.229> this

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
wanted to be successful in this

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.490 
wanted to be successful in this
lifestyle<00:01:38.799> and<00:01:39.040> I<00:01:39.070> didn't<00:01:39.369> really<00:01:39.490> know<00:01:39.610> um

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
lifestyle and I didn't really know um

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.139 
lifestyle and I didn't really know um
you<00:01:41.500> know<00:01:41.560> if<00:01:41.770> eating<00:01:42.610> a<00:01:42.670> lot<00:01:42.790> of<00:01:42.820> salt<00:01:42.969> was

00:01:43.139 --> 00:01:43.149 
you know if eating a lot of salt was

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:45.779 
you know if eating a lot of salt was
going<00:01:43.360> to<00:01:43.479> sort<00:01:43.719> of<00:01:43.750> inhibit<00:01:44.290> my<00:01:44.469> success<00:01:45.460> so

00:01:45.779 --> 00:01:45.789 
going to sort of inhibit my success so

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:48.149 
going to sort of inhibit my success so
yeah<00:01:46.240> I<00:01:46.270> really<00:01:46.509> kept<00:01:46.899> my<00:01:47.020> salt<00:01:47.380> sodium<00:01:47.860> and

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:48.159 
yeah I really kept my salt sodium and

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:52.319 
yeah I really kept my salt sodium and
take<00:01:48.280> down<00:01:48.460> to<00:01:48.700> probably<00:01:48.880> about<00:01:51.329> 500

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:52.329 
take down to probably about 500

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:53.880 
take down to probably about 500
milligrams<00:01:52.869> a<00:01:52.930> day<00:01:52.960> on<00:01:53.170> average<00:01:53.350> something

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
milligrams a day on average something

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.109 
milligrams a day on average something
like<00:01:54.039> that<00:01:54.250> sometimes<00:01:54.700> it<00:01:54.820> was<00:01:54.939> lower

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:55.119 
like that sometimes it was lower

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:58.410 
like that sometimes it was lower
sometimes<00:01:55.570> it<00:01:55.659> was<00:01:55.750> a<00:01:55.780> bit<00:01:55.930> higher<00:01:56.140> but<00:01:57.090> and<00:01:58.090> I

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
sometimes it was a bit higher but and I

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.870 
sometimes it was a bit higher but and I
couldn't<00:01:59.140> really<00:01:59.740> measure<00:01:59.979> the<00:02:00.130> effect<00:02:00.549> that

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
couldn't really measure the effect that

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.260 
couldn't really measure the effect that
having<00:02:01.420> low<00:02:01.750> sodium<00:02:02.079> had<00:02:02.530> on<00:02:02.969> you<00:02:03.969> know<00:02:04.060> my

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
having low sodium had on you know my

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.539 
having low sodium had on you know my
waistline<00:02:04.780> basically<00:02:05.350> because<00:02:05.710> I<00:02:06.250> hadn't

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:06.549 
waistline basically because I hadn't

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:09.450 
waistline basically because I hadn't
lost<00:02:06.640> any<00:02:06.909> weight<00:02:07.030> at<00:02:07.270> that<00:02:07.420> point<00:02:07.689> and<00:02:08.310> it<00:02:09.310> was

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:09.460 
lost any weight at that point and it was

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.150 
lost any weight at that point and it was
just<00:02:09.520> a<00:02:09.850> hard<00:02:10.090> thing<00:02:10.390> to<00:02:10.450> measure

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
just a hard thing to measure

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.790 
just a hard thing to measure
yeah<00:02:12.970> the<00:02:13.330> effect<00:02:13.660> that<00:02:13.780> higher<00:02:14.319> sodium

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
yeah the effect that higher sodium

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.800 
yeah the effect that higher sodium
levels<00:02:15.099> had<00:02:15.370> on<00:02:15.550> my<00:02:15.760> body<00:02:16.120> so

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
levels had on my body so

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.350 
levels had on my body so
now<00:02:17.590> then<00:02:18.430> I'm<00:02:18.550> a<00:02:18.580> little<00:02:18.640> bit<00:02:18.910> lighter<00:02:19.060> it's

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
now then I'm a little bit lighter it's

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.240 
now then I'm a little bit lighter it's
easier<00:02:19.780> to<00:02:19.900> tell<00:02:20.050> different<00:02:20.470> and<00:02:20.680> I<00:02:20.709> have<00:02:20.740> more

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
easier to tell different and I have more

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.420 
easier to tell different and I have more
like<00:02:21.520> form-fitting<00:02:22.150> clothes<00:02:22.630> and<00:02:22.870> I<00:02:22.900> can<00:02:23.080> tell

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
like form-fitting clothes and I can tell

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.150 
like form-fitting clothes and I can tell
if<00:02:24.430> you<00:02:24.940> know<00:02:24.970> how<00:02:25.510> they<00:02:25.690> fit<00:02:25.900> based<00:02:26.740> on<00:02:26.980> what

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
if you know how they fit based on what

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.220 
if you know how they fit based on what
I'm<00:02:27.280> eating<00:02:27.430> so<00:02:27.790> yeah<00:02:28.600> about<00:02:28.780> three<00:02:29.080> months

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
I'm eating so yeah about three months

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.420 
I'm eating so yeah about three months
ago<00:02:29.410> I<00:02:30.660> took<00:02:31.660> some<00:02:31.840> video<00:02:32.110> at<00:02:32.709> a<00:02:32.770> time<00:02:33.190> when<00:02:33.400> I

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
ago I took some video at a time when I

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.790 
ago I took some video at a time when I
was<00:02:33.580> eating<00:02:33.730> like<00:02:34.180> like<00:02:34.690> I<00:02:34.810> said<00:02:35.050> quite<00:02:35.560> a<00:02:35.590> lot

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
was eating like like I said quite a lot

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.920 
was eating like like I said quite a lot
of<00:02:35.920> sodium<00:02:36.160> a<00:02:36.550> lot<00:02:36.730> of<00:02:36.850> processed<00:02:37.450> sodium

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
of sodium a lot of processed sodium

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.770 
of sodium a lot of processed sodium
table<00:02:38.410> salt<00:02:38.620> I'd<00:02:38.920> I<00:02:38.980> saw<00:02:39.430> all<00:02:39.790> that<00:02:39.970> bad<00:02:40.390> stuff

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
table salt I'd I saw all that bad stuff

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.270 
table salt I'd I saw all that bad stuff
and<00:02:41.650> then<00:02:42.250> I<00:02:42.640> did<00:02:43.360> like<00:02:43.840> I<00:02:44.170> think<00:02:44.739> it<00:02:44.830> was<00:02:44.950> five

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
and then I did like I think it was five

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.830 
and then I did like I think it was five
it<00:02:45.640> was<00:02:45.700> between<00:02:45.940> five<00:02:46.180> and<00:02:46.209> seven<00:02:46.450> days<00:02:46.690> and

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
it was between five and seven days and

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.729 
it was between five and seven days and
he<00:02:46.930> was<00:02:46.989> five<00:02:47.260> days<00:02:47.590> of<00:02:48.330> going<00:02:49.330> back<00:02:49.600> to<00:02:49.739> 500

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
he was five days of going back to 500

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:54.000 
he was five days of going back to 500
milligrams<00:02:51.130> a<00:02:51.280> day<00:02:51.310> and<00:02:51.760> it<00:02:52.720> was<00:02:52.840> all<00:02:53.050> like

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
milligrams a day and it was all like

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.630 
milligrams a day and it was all like
Himalayan<00:02:54.820> sea<00:02:55.810> salt<00:02:55.840> like<00:02:56.470> as<00:02:56.650> unprocessed

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
Himalayan sea salt like as unprocessed

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:02.070 
Himalayan sea salt like as unprocessed
as<00:02:57.880> possible<00:02:59.070> and<00:03:00.330> going<00:03:01.330> back<00:03:01.510> to<00:03:01.540> that<00:03:01.750> video

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
as possible and going back to that video

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.590 
as possible and going back to that video
I<00:03:02.140> had<00:03:02.739> no<00:03:02.890> idea<00:03:03.010> I<00:03:03.340> guess<00:03:03.670> I<00:03:03.850> hadn't<00:03:04.120> really<00:03:04.330> I

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
I had no idea I guess I hadn't really I

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.660 
I had no idea I guess I hadn't really I
don't<00:03:05.140> know<00:03:05.230> assessed<00:03:05.739> it<00:03:05.950> properly<00:03:06.400> but<00:03:06.610> I

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
don't know assessed it properly but I

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.490 
don't know assessed it properly but I
had<00:03:06.819> no<00:03:06.940> idea<00:03:07.030> the<00:03:07.360> difference<00:03:07.540> that<00:03:08.080> it

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
had no idea the difference that it

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.259 
had no idea the difference that it
really<00:03:08.709> did<00:03:09.190> make<00:03:09.220> so<00:03:09.700> I'm<00:03:09.850> going<00:03:10.000> to<00:03:10.060> show<00:03:10.209> you

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269 
really did make so I'm going to show you

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:12.809 
really did make so I'm going to show you
guys<00:03:10.420> that<00:03:10.630> video<00:03:10.900> now<00:03:11.140> so<00:03:11.440> this<00:03:12.340> is<00:03:12.400> the

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:12.819 
guys that video now so this is the

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:17.670 
guys that video now so this is the
before<00:03:13.540> video<00:03:13.900> and<00:03:14.340> as<00:03:15.340> I<00:03:15.580> said<00:03:16.470> anywhere<00:03:17.470> from

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
before video and as I said anywhere from

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.250 
before video and as I said anywhere from
1,500<00:03:18.340> to<00:03:18.370> 3,000<00:03:19.060> milligrams<00:03:19.300> a<00:03:19.720> day<00:03:19.750> of

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
1,500 to 3,000 milligrams a day of

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:25.020 
1,500 to 3,000 milligrams a day of
sodium<00:03:21.040> and<00:03:22.290> yeah<00:03:23.290> I<00:03:23.320> just<00:03:23.590> I<00:03:24.070> didn't<00:03:24.340> I<00:03:24.549> didn't

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
sodium and yeah I just I didn't I didn't

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:26.819 
sodium and yeah I just I didn't I didn't
feel<00:03:25.150> really<00:03:25.510> uncomfortable<00:03:25.750> but<00:03:26.500> I<00:03:26.560> could

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:26.829 
feel really uncomfortable but I could

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:28.259 
feel really uncomfortable but I could
notice<00:03:27.040> a<00:03:27.220> difference<00:03:27.519> in<00:03:27.730> the<00:03:27.880> way<00:03:28.000> that<00:03:28.180> my

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:28.269 
notice a difference in the way that my

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:30.090 
notice a difference in the way that my
clothes<00:03:28.540> fit<00:03:28.810> at<00:03:29.140> the<00:03:29.320> time<00:03:29.500> I<00:03:29.530> wasn't<00:03:29.799> sure

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100 
clothes fit at the time I wasn't sure

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.330 
clothes fit at the time I wasn't sure
you<00:03:30.489> know<00:03:30.579> it<00:03:30.790> was<00:03:31.230> due<00:03:32.230> to<00:03:32.500> just<00:03:33.010> eating<00:03:33.250> out

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
you know it was due to just eating out

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:34.620 
you know it was due to just eating out
more<00:03:33.400> and<00:03:33.700> maybe<00:03:33.850> I<00:03:33.910> had<00:03:34.060> gained<00:03:34.299> some<00:03:34.480> of<00:03:34.600> the

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
more and maybe I had gained some of the

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:36.150 
more and maybe I had gained some of the
white<00:03:34.870> back<00:03:35.079> but<00:03:35.410> it<00:03:35.530> was<00:03:35.650> just<00:03:35.890> I<00:03:36.130> was

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
white back but it was just I was

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.789 
white back but it was just I was
interested<00:03:36.549> in<00:03:36.910> testing<00:03:37.720> out<00:03:37.840> lower<00:03:38.440> sodium

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:38.799 
interested in testing out lower sodium

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:42.509 
interested in testing out lower sodium
levels<00:03:39.280> to<00:03:39.549> see<00:03:40.320> what<00:03:41.320> that<00:03:41.470> did<00:03:41.709> exactly<00:03:42.070> in

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519 
levels to see what that did exactly in

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:45.720 
levels to see what that did exactly in
terms<00:03:43.060> of<00:03:43.329> changing<00:03:43.930> my<00:03:44.200> shape<00:03:44.739> changing<00:03:45.340> how

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
terms of changing my shape changing how

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.330 
terms of changing my shape changing how
much<00:03:45.940> excess<00:03:46.690> water<00:03:46.930> I<00:03:47.049> was<00:03:47.230> holding<00:03:47.530> on<00:03:47.620> to<00:03:47.650> so

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
much excess water I was holding on to so

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.729 
much excess water I was holding on to so
this<00:03:48.670> is<00:03:48.730> the<00:03:48.940> after<00:03:49.329> video<00:03:49.600> and<00:03:49.959> this<00:03:50.590> is

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:50.739 
this is the after video and this is

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:53.550 
this is the after video and this is
after<00:03:51.040> five<00:03:51.459> to<00:03:51.760> six<00:03:52.000> days<00:03:52.209> of<00:03:52.450> 500<00:03:53.079> milligrams

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
after five to six days of 500 milligrams

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.150 
after five to six days of 500 milligrams
of<00:03:53.769> salt<00:03:54.010> per<00:03:54.280> day<00:03:54.489> very<00:03:55.150> low<00:03:55.780> processed<00:03:56.680> like

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
of salt per day very low processed like

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.449 
of salt per day very low processed like
I<00:03:57.280> said<00:03:57.570> organic<00:03:58.570> sea<00:03:58.989> salt<00:03:59.320> or<00:03:59.650> Himalayan<00:03:59.859> sea

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
I said organic sea salt or Himalayan sea

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:02.550 
I said organic sea salt or Himalayan sea
salt<00:04:00.489> and<00:04:01.359> I<00:04:01.900> think<00:04:02.079> that<00:04:02.170> you<00:04:02.260> can<00:04:02.380> see<00:04:02.530> a

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
salt and I think that you can see a

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.069 
salt and I think that you can see a
pretty<00:04:03.010> noticeable<00:04:03.579> difference<00:04:04.209> alright<00:04:04.750> so

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:05.079 
pretty noticeable difference alright so

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:08.460 
pretty noticeable difference alright so
that<00:04:05.920> is<00:04:06.180> yeah<00:04:07.180> my<00:04:07.329> little<00:04:07.450> before<00:04:07.870> and<00:04:07.930> after

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
that is yeah my little before and after

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.199 
that is yeah my little before and after
videos<00:04:08.859> for<00:04:09.160> you<00:04:09.250> guys<00:04:09.280> and<00:04:09.430> I<00:04:09.700> thought<00:04:09.970> that

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:10.209 
videos for you guys and I thought that

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:11.670 
videos for you guys and I thought that
it<00:04:10.299> was<00:04:10.420> pretty<00:04:10.570> interesting<00:04:10.870> going<00:04:11.170> back<00:04:11.470> to

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 
it was pretty interesting going back to

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.500 
it was pretty interesting going back to
it<00:04:11.829> because<00:04:12.549> sodium<00:04:13.000> is<00:04:13.150> something<00:04:13.390> that<00:04:13.480> a

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
it because sodium is something that a

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:14.970 
it because sodium is something that a
lot<00:04:13.660> of<00:04:13.690> people<00:04:13.930> talk<00:04:14.079> about<00:04:14.109> and<00:04:14.500> I<00:04:14.560> do<00:04:14.620> think

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
lot of people talk about and I do think

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:16.349 
lot of people talk about and I do think
it<00:04:15.040> is<00:04:15.160> a<00:04:15.190> personal<00:04:15.609> thing<00:04:15.790> some<00:04:16.030> people<00:04:16.269> have

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
it is a personal thing some people have

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:18.690 
it is a personal thing some people have
no<00:04:16.570> effect<00:04:16.989> whatsoever<00:04:17.590> eating<00:04:18.250> tons<00:04:18.459> and

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:18.700 
no effect whatsoever eating tons and

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.029 
no effect whatsoever eating tons and
tons<00:04:18.729> of<00:04:19.030> sodium<00:04:19.299> and<00:04:19.690> other<00:04:19.750> people<00:04:20.140> clearly

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:21.039 
tons of sodium and other people clearly

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:23.250 
tons of sodium and other people clearly
it<00:04:21.669> really<00:04:21.940> does<00:04:22.060> affect<00:04:22.210> how<00:04:22.690> much<00:04:23.050> they

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260 
it really does affect how much they

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.290 
it really does affect how much they
weigh<00:04:23.410> how<00:04:23.620> much<00:04:23.680> water<00:04:24.070> retention<00:04:24.700> their

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
weigh how much water retention their

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.240 
weigh how much water retention their
they've<00:04:25.630> got<00:04:25.840> so<00:04:26.140> I<00:04:26.470> probably<00:04:26.830> would<00:04:27.159> have

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
they've got so I probably would have

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:29.130 
they've got so I probably would have
said<00:04:27.460> that<00:04:27.490> I<00:04:27.640> didn't<00:04:28.150> personally<00:04:28.360> hold<00:04:28.750> on<00:04:28.930> to

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:29.140 
said that I didn't personally hold on to

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.700 
said that I didn't personally hold on to
a<00:04:29.169> lot<00:04:29.409> of

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
a lot of

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:31.980 
a lot of
as<00:04:29.950> a<00:04:30.070> result<00:04:30.340> of<00:04:30.580> eating<00:04:30.760> a<00:04:30.940> lot<00:04:31.090> of<00:04:31.180> salt<00:04:31.450> but

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990 
as a result of eating a lot of salt but

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:33.630 
as a result of eating a lot of salt but
clearly<00:04:32.590> that's<00:04:32.770> not<00:04:32.920> true

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:33.640 
clearly that's not true

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.430 
clearly that's not true
looking<00:04:33.910> back<00:04:34.060> at<00:04:34.210> these<00:04:34.300> videos<00:04:34.660> I<00:04:35.020> do<00:04:35.080> hold

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 
looking back at these videos I do hold

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.100 
looking back at these videos I do hold
on<00:04:35.590> to<00:04:35.740> quite<00:04:35.890> a<00:04:35.950> bit<00:04:36.040> of<00:04:36.420> water<00:04:37.420> retention

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
on to quite a bit of water retention

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.020 
on to quite a bit of water retention
especially<00:04:39.070> if<00:04:39.340> I'm<00:04:39.490> eating<00:04:39.670> a<00:04:39.850> lot<00:04:40.000> of

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
especially if I'm eating a lot of

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.430 
especially if I'm eating a lot of
processed<00:04:40.300> salts<00:04:40.990> and<00:04:41.310> I<00:04:42.310> didn't<00:04:42.700> change<00:04:43.120> my

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 
processed salts and I didn't change my

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.550 
processed salts and I didn't change my
diet<00:04:44.440> or<00:04:44.860> my<00:04:45.070> exercise<00:04:45.810> between<00:04:46.810> those<00:04:47.140> before

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:47.560 
diet or my exercise between those before

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.710 
diet or my exercise between those before
and<00:04:47.890> after<00:04:48.220> pictures<00:04:49.030> or<00:04:49.330> videos<00:04:49.630> at<00:04:50.470> all<00:04:50.800> and

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 
and after pictures or videos at all and

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.240 
and after pictures or videos at all and
five<00:04:52.720> or<00:04:52.870> six<00:04:53.020> days<00:04:53.170> is<00:04:53.500> not<00:04:53.740> enough<00:04:54.040> time<00:04:54.190> to

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:54.250 
five or six days is not enough time to

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:56.550 
five or six days is not enough time to
lose<00:04:54.610> fat<00:04:55.030> so<00:04:55.330> to<00:04:55.870> me<00:04:56.020> this<00:04:56.140> is<00:04:56.200> definitely

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560 
lose fat so to me this is definitely

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.980 
lose fat so to me this is definitely
water<00:04:56.920> retention<00:04:57.480> and<00:04:58.480> I<00:04:58.570> can<00:04:58.720> only<00:04:58.840> imagine

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
water retention and I can only imagine

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:00.600 
water retention and I can only imagine
the<00:04:59.260> result<00:04:59.560> that<00:04:59.650> it<00:04:59.770> would<00:04:59.860> have<00:05:00.010> if<00:05:00.250> I<00:05:00.370> had

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:00.610 
the result that it would have if I had

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:02.460 
the result that it would have if I had
stayed<00:05:00.910> with<00:05:00.970> it<00:05:01.210> for<00:05:01.360> you<00:05:01.810> know<00:05:01.900> two<00:05:01.960> three

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:02.470 
stayed with it for you know two three

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:05.880 
stayed with it for you know two three
four<00:05:02.710> weeks<00:05:02.950> so<00:05:03.990> personally<00:05:04.990> do<00:05:05.470> I<00:05:05.530> believe

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:05.890 
four weeks so personally do I believe

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:08.970 
four weeks so personally do I believe
that<00:05:05.950> you<00:05:06.850> know<00:05:06.970> salt<00:05:07.620> makes<00:05:08.620> you<00:05:08.740> retain

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:08.980 
that you know salt makes you retain

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:11.250 
that you know salt makes you retain
water<00:05:09.130> yes<00:05:09.850> it<00:05:10.210> does<00:05:10.690> depend<00:05:11.050> on<00:05:11.110> your

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:11.260 
water yes it does depend on your

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:12.860 
water yes it does depend on your
activity<00:05:11.710> level<00:05:12.010> if<00:05:12.190> you're<00:05:12.340> you<00:05:12.700> know

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:12.870 
activity level if you're you know

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.210 
activity level if you're you know
cycling<00:05:13.870> every<00:05:13.990> single<00:05:14.440> day<00:05:14.560> for<00:05:14.620> three<00:05:15.100> hours

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:15.220 
cycling every single day for three hours

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:17.940 
cycling every single day for three hours
maybe<00:05:16.030> not<00:05:16.210> so<00:05:16.390> much<00:05:16.570> but<00:05:16.630> even<00:05:17.110> then<00:05:17.290> I<00:05:17.680> think

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:17.950 
maybe not so much but even then I think

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:21.150 
maybe not so much but even then I think
that<00:05:18.400> a<00:05:18.460> lot<00:05:18.670> of<00:05:18.790> salt<00:05:19.030> can<00:05:19.270> definitely<00:05:20.160> affect

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:21.160 
that a lot of salt can definitely affect

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.620 
that a lot of salt can definitely affect
the<00:05:21.460> way<00:05:21.550> that<00:05:21.580> you<00:05:21.910> fit<00:05:22.090> into<00:05:22.210> your<00:05:22.330> clothes

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:22.630 
the way that you fit into your clothes

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:23.970 
the way that you fit into your clothes
and<00:05:23.170> affect<00:05:23.500> the<00:05:23.560> way<00:05:23.650> that<00:05:23.680> you<00:05:23.830> feel<00:05:23.920> about

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:23.980 
and affect the way that you feel about

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:25.560 
and affect the way that you feel about
yourself<00:05:24.220> so<00:05:24.610> if<00:05:24.790> you're<00:05:24.970> feeling<00:05:25.480> a<00:05:25.540> bit

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:25.570 
yourself so if you're feeling a bit

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:28.170 
yourself so if you're feeling a bit
discouraged<00:05:26.260> on<00:05:26.800> this<00:05:27.160> lifestyle<00:05:27.610> or<00:05:27.880> on<00:05:28.000> any
