Ford today we are test driving a 2014
Ford<00:00:14.740> Edge<00:00:15.040> all-wheel<00:00:15.730> drive<00:00:16.000> the<00:00:16.930> reason<00:00:17.110> why

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:17.200 
Ford Edge all-wheel drive the reason why

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.870 
Ford Edge all-wheel drive the reason why
we<00:00:17.320> picked<00:00:17.530> this<00:00:17.620> unit<00:00:17.950> today<00:00:18.100> because<00:00:18.700> it's

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:18.880 
we picked this unit today because it's

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.570 
we picked this unit today because it's
snowing<00:00:19.210> and<00:00:19.750> March<00:00:20.080> so<00:00:20.860> we<00:00:20.950> saw<00:00:21.100> a<00:00:21.130> couple

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:23.440 
cars off in the ditch and wanted to show

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.020 
cars off in the ditch and wanted to show
you<00:00:23.500> kind<00:00:24.190> of<00:00:24.340> the<00:00:24.400> all-wheel<00:00:24.760> drive

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:25.030 
you kind of the all-wheel drive

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:29.370 
you kind of the all-wheel drive
capability<00:00:25.810> off<00:00:25.960> these<00:00:26.170> edges<00:00:27.750> now<00:00:28.750> the<00:00:28.810> 2014

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:29.380 
capability off these edges now the 2014

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.270 
capability off these edges now the 2014
Edge<00:00:30.010> has<00:00:30.370> three<00:00:31.000> engine<00:00:31.600> choices<00:00:32.160> if<00:00:33.160> you

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:33.280 
Edge has three engine choices if you

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.400 
Edge has three engine choices if you
have<00:00:33.520> two<00:00:33.879> different<00:00:34.030> EcoBoost<00:00:34.690> engines<00:00:35.170> the

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:35.410 
have two different EcoBoost engines the

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.090 
have two different EcoBoost engines the
2.0<00:00:36.750> which<00:00:37.750> is<00:00:37.930> available<00:00:38.469> in<00:00:38.530> most<00:00:38.649> models

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:39.100 
2.0 which is available in most models

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.040 
2.0 which is available in most models
and<00:00:39.219> then<00:00:39.309> you<00:00:39.370> have<00:00:39.519> the<00:00:39.609> 3.5<00:00:40.239> liter<00:00:40.300> which<00:00:40.870> is

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.050 
and then you have the 3.5 liter which is

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.229 
and then you have the 3.5 liter which is
going<00:00:41.170> to<00:00:41.230> be<00:00:41.350> a<00:00:41.379> standard<00:00:41.649> v6<00:00:41.980> and<00:00:42.519> then<00:00:43.089> in

00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:43.239 
going to be a standard v6 and then in

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:47.069 
going to be a standard v6 and then in
the<00:00:43.329> sport<00:00:43.809> you<00:00:44.140> have<00:00:44.620> the<00:00:45.039> EcoBoost<00:00:46.079> engine

00:00:47.069 --> 00:00:47.079 
the sport you have the EcoBoost engine

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:50.939 
the sport you have the EcoBoost engine
as<00:00:47.170> well<00:00:47.460> for<00:00:48.460> 2014<00:00:49.239> the<00:00:49.570> Ford<00:00:49.809> Edge<00:00:50.079> has<00:00:50.499> four

00:00:50.939 --> 00:00:50.949 
as well for 2014 the Ford Edge has four

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:53.309 
as well for 2014 the Ford Edge has four
different<00:00:51.100> models<00:00:51.460> you<00:00:51.909> have<00:00:52.690> the<00:00:52.839> Ford<00:00:53.079> Edge

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:53.319 
different models you have the Ford Edge

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:58.559 
different models you have the Ford Edge
SE<00:00:53.920> the<00:00:54.760> SEL<00:00:56.100> be<00:00:57.100> limited<00:00:57.609> and<00:00:57.850> then<00:00:58.089> the<00:00:58.210> sport

00:00:58.559 --> 00:00:58.569 
SE the SEL be limited and then the sport

00:00:58.569 --> 00:01:00.180 
SE the SEL be limited and then the sport
so<00:00:59.199> it<00:00:59.260> gives<00:00:59.409> you<00:00:59.530> a<00:00:59.589> couple<00:00:59.800> different

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
so it gives you a couple different

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.399 
so it gives you a couple different
options<00:01:00.280> to<00:01:00.609> kind<00:01:00.789> of<00:01:00.879> pick<00:01:01.030> from<00:01:01.239> as<00:01:02.229> you'll

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:02.409 
options to kind of pick from as you'll

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:04.140 
options to kind of pick from as you'll
notice<00:01:02.589> the<00:01:02.769> car<00:01:02.949> handles<00:01:03.309> absolutely<00:01:03.879> great

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:04.150 
notice the car handles absolutely great

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.060 
notice the car handles absolutely great
around<00:01:04.510> the<00:01:04.809> corners<00:01:05.199> even<00:01:05.440> having<00:01:05.860> a<00:01:05.890> little

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070 
around the corners even having a little

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.840 
around the corners even having a little
bit<00:01:06.159> slick<00:01:06.490> roads<00:01:06.930> going<00:01:07.930> about<00:01:08.080> 4045<00:01:09.070> and<00:01:09.520> the

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
bit slick roads going about 4045 and the

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.670 
bit slick roads going about 4045 and the
roads<00:01:10.030> are<00:01:10.120> pretty<00:01:10.270> icy<00:01:10.750> but<00:01:11.380> with<00:01:11.560> the

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
roads are pretty icy but with the

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.950 
roads are pretty icy but with the
all-wheel-drive<00:01:12.070> how<00:01:12.640> it<00:01:12.759> actually<00:01:12.939> works<00:01:13.360> is

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:13.960 
all-wheel-drive how it actually works is

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.319 
all-wheel-drive how it actually works is
your<00:01:14.229> front<00:01:14.530> wheel<00:01:14.680> drive<00:01:14.950> most<00:01:15.820> of<00:01:16.030> the<00:01:16.119> time

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:16.329 
your front wheel drive most of the time

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:17.850 
your front wheel drive most of the time
so<00:01:17.020> that<00:01:17.200> way<00:01:17.320> you're<00:01:17.500> actually<00:01:17.619> getting

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860 
so that way you're actually getting

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.950 
so that way you're actually getting
better<00:01:18.100> fuel<00:01:18.399> economy<00:01:18.700> but<00:01:19.180> whenever<00:01:19.659> the

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 
better fuel economy but whenever the

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.889 
better fuel economy but whenever the
tire<00:01:20.399> whenever<00:01:21.399> the<00:01:21.520> sensor<00:01:21.939> feels<00:01:22.240> it's<00:01:22.509> slip

00:01:22.889 --> 00:01:22.899 
tire whenever the sensor feels it's slip

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:24.630 
tire whenever the sensor feels it's slip
it<00:01:23.110> automatically<00:01:23.649> engages<00:01:23.950> it<00:01:24.250> into

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
it automatically engages it into

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.670 
it automatically engages it into
all-wheel-drive<00:01:25.030> for<00:01:25.630> you<00:01:25.750> so<00:01:25.990> you<00:01:26.560> don't

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 
all-wheel-drive for you so you don't

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.859 
all-wheel-drive for you so you don't
have<00:01:26.829> to<00:01:27.070> do<00:01:27.219> it<00:01:27.250> I'll<00:01:27.549> make<00:01:27.789> like<00:01:28.000> a<00:01:28.119> salt<00:01:28.600> so

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:28.869 
have to do it I'll make like a salt so

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:30.899 
have to do it I'll make like a salt so
that<00:01:29.140> way<00:01:29.530> you<00:01:29.740> can<00:01:29.950> actually<00:01:30.100> maximize<00:01:30.460> the

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:30.909 
that way you can actually maximize the

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:34.319 
that way you can actually maximize the
most<00:01:31.149> fuel<00:01:32.310> efficiency<00:01:33.310> as<00:01:33.399> possible<00:01:33.820> and

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:34.329 
most fuel efficiency as possible and

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:35.880 
most fuel efficiency as possible and
then<00:01:34.600> just<00:01:34.630> making<00:01:35.350> sure<00:01:35.500> that<00:01:35.649> you're<00:01:35.799> gonna

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
then just making sure that you're gonna

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.440 
then just making sure that you're gonna
be<00:01:36.009> safe<00:01:36.189> on

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.780 

and<00:01:38.990> on<00:01:39.200> this<00:01:39.409> unit<00:01:39.830> this<00:01:40.100> one<00:01:40.280> actually<00:01:40.460> has

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
and on this unit this one actually has

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.050 
and on this unit this one actually has
the<00:01:41.350> automatic<00:01:42.350> wipers<00:01:42.979> so<00:01:43.580> whenever<00:01:43.909> it

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
the automatic wipers so whenever it

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.210 
the automatic wipers so whenever it
actually<00:01:44.390> is<00:01:44.630> rain<00:01:44.870> sensitive<00:01:45.440> so<00:01:45.979> whatever

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 
actually is rain sensitive so whatever

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:47.620 
actually is rain sensitive so whatever
has<00:01:46.430> any<00:01:46.580> kind<00:01:46.760> of<00:01:46.790> moisture<00:01:46.940> actually<00:01:47.450> on<00:01:47.540> the

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
has any kind of moisture actually on the

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.200 
has any kind of moisture actually on the
windshield<00:01:47.869> automatically<00:01:48.770> turn<00:01:49.340> on<00:01:49.580> and<00:01:50.030> off

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
windshield automatically turn on and off

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.030 
windshield automatically turn on and off
for<00:01:50.750> you<00:01:50.930> so<00:01:51.170> depending<00:01:51.530> on<00:01:51.619> the<00:01:51.770> severity

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040 
for you so depending on the severity

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.310 
for you so depending on the severity
about<00:01:52.400> wet<00:01:52.580> bank<00:01:52.850> which<00:01:53.720> is<00:01:53.750> a<00:01:53.900> nice<00:01:54.050> feature

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
about wet bank which is a nice feature

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:55.930 
about wet bank which is a nice feature
that<00:01:54.440> we<00:01:54.650> have<00:01:54.920> to<00:01:55.160> worry<00:01:55.310> about<00:01:55.490> what<00:01:55.670> speed

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:55.940 
that we have to worry about what speed

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.180 
that we have to worry about what speed
actually<00:01:56.380> you<00:01:57.380> should<00:01:57.560> put<00:01:57.740> it<00:01:57.860> on<00:01:57.979> because

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:58.190 
actually you should put it on because

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:59.830 
actually you should put it on because
depending<00:01:58.520> on<00:01:58.759> how<00:01:58.940> much<00:01:59.090> it<00:01:59.270> starts<00:01:59.600> raining

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
depending on how much it starts raining

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.780 
depending on how much it starts raining
or<00:02:00.080> snowing<00:02:00.200> they'll<00:02:00.890> do<00:02:01.070> it<00:02:01.190> all<00:02:01.250> for<00:02:01.460> you<00:02:01.520> so

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:01.790
