if we date a buck from Miller Harris now

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.239 
if we date a buck from Miller Harris now
I<00:00:42.079> know<00:00:42.260> it's<00:00:42.350> a<00:00:42.379> little<00:00:42.469> bit<00:00:42.679> hard<00:00:42.859> to<00:00:42.920> see

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:43.249 
I know it's a little bit hard to see

00:00:43.249 --> 00:00:45.910 
I know it's a little bit hard to see
here<00:00:44.149> but<00:00:44.210> this<00:00:45.140> is<00:00:45.289> the<00:00:45.409> design<00:00:45.710> of<00:00:45.739> the

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
here but this is the design of the

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.649 
here but this is the design of the
bottle<00:00:46.129> now<00:00:46.429> you're<00:00:46.969> gonna<00:00:47.089> see<00:00:47.329> this<00:00:47.510> it

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:47.659 
bottle now you're gonna see this it

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:48.880 
bottle now you're gonna see this it
doesn't<00:00:47.780> really<00:00:47.960> have<00:00:48.170> a<00:00:48.199> stopper<00:00:48.649> and<00:00:48.739> that's

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:48.890 
doesn't really have a stopper and that's

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:50.739 
doesn't really have a stopper and that's
because<00:00:49.219> the<00:00:49.670> way<00:00:49.789> that<00:00:49.969> the<00:00:50.089> fragrance<00:00:50.269> comes

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:50.749 
because the way that the fragrance comes

00:00:50.749 --> 00:00:53.470 
because the way that the fragrance comes
and<00:00:50.989> it<00:00:51.079> comes<00:00:51.409> with<00:00:51.530> a<00:00:51.999> just<00:00:52.999> a<00:00:53.059> screw<00:00:53.329> on<00:00:53.390> cap

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.480 
and it comes with a just a screw on cap

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.200 
and it comes with a just a screw on cap
and<00:00:53.989> it<00:00:54.050> kind<00:00:54.230> of<00:00:54.319> serves<00:00:54.890> as<00:00:55.100> a<00:00:55.159> taffy<00:00:55.729> save

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 
and it kind of serves as a taffy save

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.860 
and it kind of serves as a taffy save
splash<00:00:56.539> or<00:00:56.929> you<00:00:57.109> can<00:00:57.289> screw<00:00:57.559> this<00:00:57.769> one<00:00:57.979> on<00:00:58.219> and

00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:58.870 
splash or you can screw this one on and

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.479 
splash or you can screw this one on and
serve<00:00:59.870> have<00:01:00.350> a<00:01:00.379> little<00:01:00.710> sprayer<00:01:01.010> to<00:01:01.219> kind<00:01:01.429> of

as he said it I was like that's what it

as he said it I was like that's what it
is<00:03:49.439> that's<00:03:50.159> why<00:03:50.519> this<00:03:50.579> smells<00:03:50.970> feels<00:03:51.209> so

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:51.389

is that's why this smells feels so
familiar<00:03:51.540> and<00:03:52.019> that's<00:03:52.590> why<00:03:52.829> I<00:03:52.859> can't<00:03:53.220> wear<00:03:53.400> it

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:53.579 
familiar and that's why I can't wear it

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:55.490 
familiar and that's why I can't wear it
he<00:03:54.389> said<00:03:54.629> that<00:03:54.659> it<00:03:54.810> smells<00:03:54.989> like<00:03:55.109> old<00:03:55.259> spice

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.619 
he said that it smells like old spice
and<00:03:55.979> it<00:03:56.340> immediately<00:03:56.669> jogged<00:03:57.150> my<00:03:57.239> memory<00:03:57.329> I

00:03:57.619 --> 00:03:57.629 
and it immediately jogged my memory I

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:00.020 
and it immediately jogged my memory I
was<00:03:57.780> like<00:03:57.959> yes<00:03:58.439> it<00:03:58.919> smells<00:03:59.099> like<00:03:59.370> a<00:03:59.430> more

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
was like yes it smells like a more

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.390 
was like yes it smells like a more
refined<00:04:00.569> version<00:04:00.689> of<00:04:01.109> Old<00:04:01.349> Spice<00:04:01.500> and<00:04:01.919> the

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
refined version of Old Spice and the

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.069 
refined version of Old Spice and the
reason<00:04:02.729> why<00:04:02.849> I<00:04:02.879> can't<00:04:03.180> wear<00:04:03.329> it<00:04:03.479> is<00:04:03.569> because<00:04:03.930> my

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:04.079 
reason why I can't wear it is because my

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:05.869 
reason why I can't wear it is because my
father<00:04:04.409> used<00:04:04.680> to<00:04:04.739> wear<00:04:04.919> Old<00:04:05.099> Spice<00:04:05.310> like<00:04:05.609> crazy

00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:05.879 
father used to wear Old Spice like crazy

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:07.369 
father used to wear Old Spice like crazy
growing<00:04:06.269> up<00:04:06.359> and<00:04:06.599> that<00:04:06.870> was<00:04:06.959> one<00:04:07.079> of<00:04:07.109> the<00:04:07.229> most

00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:07.379 
growing up and that was one of the most

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:09.890 
growing up and that was one of the most
familiar<00:04:08.009> sense<00:04:08.639> to<00:04:08.790> me<00:04:08.909> kind<00:04:09.150> of<00:04:09.269> growing<00:04:09.689> up

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
familiar sense to me kind of growing up

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.089 
familiar sense to me kind of growing up
that<00:04:10.049> was<00:04:10.139> one<00:04:10.290> of<00:04:10.379> the<00:04:10.439> sense<00:04:10.799> that<00:04:10.889> he

00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:11.099 
that was one of the sense that he

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:13.460 
that was one of the sense that he
actually<00:04:11.310> wore<00:04:11.729> and<00:04:12.150> because<00:04:13.019> of<00:04:13.049> it<00:04:13.229> that's

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
actually wore and because of it that's

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.189 
actually wore and because of it that's
why<00:04:13.709> it<00:04:13.769> never<00:04:14.669> really<00:04:15.060> stopped<00:04:15.810> to<00:04:15.930> me<00:04:16.049> as<00:04:16.169> a

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:16.199 
why it never really stopped to me as a

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:18.259 
why it never really stopped to me as a
scent<00:04:16.530> that<00:04:16.680> I<00:04:16.739> can<00:04:16.919> wear<00:04:17.190> it<00:04:17.459> stuck<00:04:18.030> to<00:04:18.150> me

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269 
scent that I can wear it stuck to me

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:20.240 
scent that I can wear it stuck to me
more<00:04:18.479> like<00:04:18.690> a<00:04:18.720> scent<00:04:19.049> around<00:04:19.199> meal<00:04:19.709> as<00:04:19.919> a<00:04:19.949> room

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
more like a scent around meal as a room

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:21.529 
more like a scent around meal as a room
scent<00:04:20.579> because<00:04:20.970> that's<00:04:21.090> what<00:04:21.269> I<00:04:21.299> always

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:21.539

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.810 
smelled around
it<00:04:22.930> was<00:04:23.080> him<00:04:23.260> basically<00:04:23.800> wearing<00:04:24.190> something

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
it was him basically wearing something

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.180 
it was him basically wearing something
that<00:04:24.970> smelt<00:04:25.360> that<00:04:25.540> as<00:04:25.930> some<00:04:26.140> very<00:04:26.650> old<00:04:26.860> spice

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
that smelt that as some very old spice

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:28.560 
that smelt that as some very old spice

basically and this smells like old spice

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:30.690 
basically and this smells like old spice
that's<00:04:29.410> why<00:04:29.680> I<00:04:29.710> wasn't<00:04:29.950> able<00:04:30.100> to<00:04:30.250> get<00:04:30.370> into<00:04:30.580> it

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:30.700 
that's why I wasn't able to get into it

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:32.850 
that's why I wasn't able to get into it
so<00:04:30.730> going<00:04:31.060> off<00:04:31.270> with<00:04:31.450> Old<00:04:31.630> Spice<00:04:31.690> I<00:04:32.200> honestly

so going off with Old Spice I honestly
say<00:04:33.040> yes<00:04:33.280> this<00:04:33.520> does<00:04:33.790> smell<00:04:34.060> like<00:04:34.120> our<00:04:34.480> more

refined version of Old Spice hence the

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.750 
refined version of Old Spice hence the
