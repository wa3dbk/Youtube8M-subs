00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
called this side up and it is made by me

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.690 
called this side up and it is made by me
like<00:00:09.450> I<00:00:09.570> said<00:00:09.830> known<00:00:10.830> as<00:00:10.980> really<00:00:11.400> helped<00:00:11.639> with

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
like I said known as really helped with

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.400 
like I said known as really helped with
the<00:00:11.969> construction<00:00:12.509> of<00:00:12.599> it<00:00:12.750> and<00:00:12.990> it<00:00:13.170> wasn't

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
the construction of it and it wasn't

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:14.509 
the construction of it and it wasn't
really<00:00:13.530> all<00:00:13.620> that<00:00:13.710> hard<00:00:14.040> it<00:00:14.160> only<00:00:14.309> took<00:00:14.460> me

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
really all that hard it only took me

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.609 
really all that hard it only took me
probably<00:00:15.240> like<00:00:15.570> an<00:00:15.660> hour<00:00:15.870> or<00:00:16.170> less<00:00:16.199> to<00:00:16.500> get

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
probably like an hour or less to get

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.500 
probably like an hour or less to get
everything<00:00:16.949> out<00:00:17.130> completely<00:00:18.029> right<00:00:18.240> but<00:00:18.420> we

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
everything out completely right but we

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:19.670 
everything out completely right but we
were<00:00:18.600> testing<00:00:18.810> it<00:00:19.020> out<00:00:19.109> and<00:00:19.289> I<00:00:19.350> had<00:00:19.439> a<00:00:19.470> lobby

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
were testing it out and I had a lobby

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.950 
were testing it out and I had a lobby
and<00:00:19.830> everything<00:00:20.130> and<00:00:20.539> duquesne<00:00:21.539> was<00:00:21.720> in<00:00:21.840> there

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
and everything and duquesne was in there

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.390 
and everything and duquesne was in there
and<00:00:22.080> he<00:00:22.140> was<00:00:22.230> like<00:00:22.320> hey<00:00:22.529> you<00:00:22.590> should<00:00:22.740> try<00:00:23.340> it

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
and he was like hey you should try it

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.500 
and he was like hey you should try it
with<00:00:23.490> thruster<00:00:23.820> packs<00:00:24.029> because<00:00:24.210> originally

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
with thruster packs because originally

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.000 
with thruster packs because originally
it<00:00:24.779> had<00:00:24.869> Promethean<00:00:25.410> vision<00:00:25.680> just<00:00:25.800> because

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
it had Promethean vision just because

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.890 
it had Promethean vision just because
it's<00:00:26.160> it<00:00:26.910> can<00:00:27.060> get<00:00:27.150> a<00:00:27.210> little<00:00:27.330> bit<00:00:27.510> hard<00:00:27.660> to<00:00:27.689> see

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
it's it can get a little bit hard to see

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.620 
it's it can get a little bit hard to see
where<00:00:28.050> people<00:00:28.140> are<00:00:28.410> so<00:00:28.740> uh<00:00:29.179> but<00:00:30.179> thruster

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
where people are so uh but thruster

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.010 
where people are so uh but thruster
packs<00:00:30.840> are<00:00:31.520> definitely<00:00:32.520> a<00:00:33.030> game-changer<00:00:33.690> in

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
packs are definitely a game-changer in

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.690 
packs are definitely a game-changer in
this<00:00:34.170> map<00:00:34.320> it<00:00:34.620> makes<00:00:34.770> it<00:00:34.860> a<00:00:34.920> lot<00:00:35.010> easier<00:00:35.070> to

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
this map it makes it a lot easier to

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.479 
this map it makes it a lot easier to
save<00:00:36.480> yourself<00:00:36.600> when<00:00:37.050> you<00:00:37.620> you<00:00:38.190> have<00:00:38.309> a<00:00:38.340> little

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
save yourself when you you have a little

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:39.889 
save yourself when you you have a little
bit<00:00:38.610> of<00:00:38.700> momentum<00:00:38.790> it's<00:00:39.270> pushing<00:00:39.480> you<00:00:39.660> you're

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
bit of momentum it's pushing you you're

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.600 
bit of momentum it's pushing you you're
trying<00:00:40.079> to<00:00:40.140> go<00:00:40.200> off<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.410> edge<00:00:40.530> you<00:00:41.460> just

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
trying to go off the edge you just

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.040 
trying to go off the edge you just
thrust<00:00:41.850> your<00:00:42.000> pack<00:00:42.120> and<00:00:42.360> then<00:00:42.510> boom<00:00:42.870> you're

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
thrust your pack and then boom you're

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.139 
thrust your pack and then boom you're
still<00:00:43.260> alive<00:00:43.469> so<00:00:43.800> it's<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.399> exact<00:00:44.670> opposite

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
still alive so it's the exact opposite

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.369 
still alive so it's the exact opposite
of<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.360> thruster<00:00:45.750> pack<00:00:45.870> when<00:00:46.079> you're<00:00:46.200> playing

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
of the thruster pack when you're playing

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.860 
of the thruster pack when you're playing
and<00:00:46.739> matchmaking<00:00:47.460> because<00:00:47.670> it's<00:00:47.870> basically

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
and matchmaking because it's basically

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.389 
and matchmaking because it's basically
useless<00:00:49.260> but<00:00:49.680> in<00:00:49.770> this<00:00:49.890> it's<00:00:50.039> actually<00:00:50.280> really

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
useless but in this it's actually really

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.630 
useless but in this it's actually really
awesome<00:00:50.789> but<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.719> point<00:00:51.930> is<00:00:52.140> you<00:00:52.949> stick<00:00:53.430> up<00:00:53.520> at

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
awesome but the point is you stick up at

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:54.860 
awesome but the point is you stick up at
this<00:00:53.730> grid<00:00:53.940> up<00:00:54.059> here<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:54.300> I<00:00:54.329> used<00:00:54.510> a<00:00:54.600> grid

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
this grid up here and I used a grid

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.689 
this grid up here and I used a grid
instead<00:00:55.230> of<00:00:55.350> pieces<00:00:55.680> because<00:00:56.010> sometimes<00:00:56.550> in

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
instead of pieces because sometimes in

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.279 
instead of pieces because sometimes in
the<00:00:56.760> pieces<00:00:57.090> are<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.690> pieces<00:00:57.870> when<00:00:58.079> you<00:00:58.170> go

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
the pieces are the pieces when you go

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.080 
the pieces are the pieces when you go
and<00:00:58.890> you<00:00:59.010> play<00:00:59.160> in<00:00:59.219> customs<00:00:59.640> they<00:00:59.789> shift

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
and you play in customs they shift

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.029 
and you play in customs they shift
around<00:01:00.359> a<00:01:00.510> little<00:01:00.629> bit<00:01:00.809> just<00:01:01.079> because<00:01:01.199> of<00:01:01.680> lag

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
around a little bit just because of lag

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.789 
around a little bit just because of lag
or<00:01:02.309> who<00:01:02.460> knows<00:01:02.489> what<00:01:02.670> I<00:01:02.850> don't<00:01:03.090> know<00:01:03.439> so<00:01:04.439> I<00:01:04.470> did

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
or who knows what I don't know so I did

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:05.990 
or who knows what I don't know so I did
it<00:01:04.860> with<00:01:04.949> a<00:01:05.010> grid<00:01:05.250> because<00:01:05.430> then<00:01:05.700> there<00:01:05.850> are<00:01:05.909> no

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
it with a grid because then there are no

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.760 
it with a grid because then there are no
little<00:01:06.240> bumps<00:01:06.570> you<00:01:06.630> can<00:01:06.810> hit<00:01:06.960> because<00:01:07.320> if<00:01:07.619> you

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
little bumps you can hit because if you

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.260 
little bumps you can hit because if you
hit<00:01:07.890> a<00:01:07.920> bump<00:01:08.159> it<00:01:08.369> could<00:01:08.549> push<00:01:08.700> you<00:01:08.820> down<00:01:09.000> and

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
hit a bump it could push you down and

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.539 
hit a bump it could push you down and
you<00:01:09.330> could<00:01:09.479> fall<00:01:09.720> out<00:01:09.960> of<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.549> gravity

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
you could fall out of the gravity

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:12.770 
you could fall out of the gravity
volumes<00:01:11.850> that<00:01:11.970> are<00:01:12.030> actually<00:01:12.210> holding<00:01:12.540> you<00:01:12.659> up

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
volumes that are actually holding you up

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.590 
volumes that are actually holding you up
to<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:12.990> ceiling<00:01:13.170> here<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:14.299> there's<00:01:15.299> just<00:01:15.479> a

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
to the ceiling here and there's just a

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.010 
to the ceiling here and there's just a
little<00:01:15.869> sliver<00:01:16.590> of<00:01:16.740> it<00:01:17.009> maybe<00:01:17.400> half<00:01:17.909> of<00:01:18.119> the

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
little sliver of it maybe half of the

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.510 
little sliver of it maybe half of the
height<00:01:19.140> of<00:01:19.170> your<00:01:19.380> body<00:01:19.590> that's<00:01:19.680> sticking<00:01:20.310> down

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
height of your body that's sticking down

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.010 
height of your body that's sticking down
through<00:01:20.790> here<00:01:20.939> to<00:01:21.090> hold<00:01:21.720> you<00:01:21.810> up<00:01:21.840> to<00:01:21.930> the

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
through here to hold you up to the

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.690 
through here to hold you up to the
ceiling<00:01:22.200> because<00:01:23.100> I<00:01:23.189> didn't<00:01:23.369> wanna<00:01:23.490> have<00:01:23.549> too

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
ceiling because I didn't wanna have too

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.100 
ceiling because I didn't wanna have too
much<00:01:23.820> of<00:01:23.880> it<00:01:24.060> because<00:01:24.270> if<00:01:24.390> you<00:01:24.479> fall<00:01:24.630> off<00:01:24.869> and

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
much of it because if you fall off and

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.050 
much of it because if you fall off and
you<00:01:25.200> could<00:01:25.320> thruster<00:01:25.650> pack<00:01:25.770> back<00:01:26.340> into<00:01:26.759> it<00:01:26.880> and

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
you could thruster pack back into it and

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.359 
you could thruster pack back into it and
then<00:01:27.479> like<00:01:28.080> fly<00:01:28.470> back<00:01:28.680> up<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:28.950> ceiling<00:01:29.280> and

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
then like fly back up the ceiling and

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.460 
then like fly back up the ceiling and
that's<00:01:29.520> not<00:01:29.700> very<00:01:29.850> cool<00:01:30.090> because<00:01:30.930> when<00:01:31.200> you're

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
that's not very cool because when you're

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.929 
that's not very cool because when you're
gonna<00:01:31.590> die<00:01:31.829> we<00:01:32.040> want<00:01:32.220> you<00:01:32.310> to<00:01:32.400> die<00:01:32.579> because

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
gonna die we want you to die because

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.370 
gonna die we want you to die because
that's<00:01:33.119> kinda<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.390> whole<00:01:33.509> point<00:01:33.689> so<00:01:34.229> pretty

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
that's kinda the whole point so pretty

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.530 
that's kinda the whole point so pretty
much<00:01:34.470> it's<00:01:34.799> just<00:01:35.070> set<00:01:35.460> up<00:01:35.579> to<00:01:35.820> you<00:01:36.420> have

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
much it's just set up to you have

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.630 
much it's just set up to you have
concussion<00:01:37.020> rifles<00:01:37.350> with<00:01:37.619> unlimited<00:01:38.130> ammo

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
concussion rifles with unlimited ammo

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.190 
concussion rifles with unlimited ammo
but<00:01:38.759> it's<00:01:38.880> not<00:01:39.030> bottomless<00:01:39.450> clips<00:01:39.689> but<00:01:39.960> you<00:01:40.049> do

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
but it's not bottomless clips but you do

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.289 
but it's not bottomless clips but you do
have<00:01:40.320> dexterity<00:01:40.759> when<00:01:41.759> you're<00:01:41.850> on<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.030> bottom

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
have dexterity when you're on the bottom

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.940 
have dexterity when you're on the bottom
you're<00:01:42.659> invisible<00:01:43.020> and<00:01:43.470> there<00:01:43.710> are<00:01:43.770> shield

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
you're invisible and there are shield

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.160 
you're invisible and there are shield
doors<00:01:44.070> down<00:01:44.340> there<00:01:44.520> so<00:01:44.729> you<00:01:44.790> can't<00:01:45.090> shoot<00:01:45.899> up

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
doors down there so you can't shoot up

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.950 
doors down there so you can't shoot up
and<00:01:46.470> they<00:01:46.590> can't<00:01:46.799> shoot<00:01:46.950> down<00:01:47.130> of<00:01:47.280> you<00:01:47.509> so<00:01:48.509> that

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
and they can't shoot down of you so that

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.960 
and they can't shoot down of you so that
solves<00:01:49.140> all<00:01:49.290> that<00:01:49.560> problem<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:50.670> really

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
solves all that problem and really

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.370 
solves all that problem and really
wouldn't<00:01:51.270> do<00:01:51.509> all<00:01:51.570> that<00:01:51.659> much<00:01:51.810> anyway<00:01:52.140> and

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
wouldn't do all that much anyway and

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.859 
wouldn't do all that much anyway and
while<00:01:52.710> you're<00:01:52.829> down<00:01:52.920> there<00:01:52.979> you<00:01:53.159> do<00:01:53.310> no<00:01:53.549> damage

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:53.869 
while you're down there you do no damage

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:56.270 
while you're down there you do no damage
while<00:01:54.869> you're<00:01:55.020> up<00:01:55.079> on<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.229> top<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.860> regular

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
while you're up on the top the regular

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.950 
while you're up on the top the regular
traits<00:01:56.579> are<00:01:56.790> that<00:01:56.969> you<00:01:57.060> have<00:01:57.210> two<00:01:57.570> thousand

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
traits are that you have two thousand

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.100 
traits are that you have two thousand
percent<00:01:58.200> health<00:01:58.590> and<00:01:59.360> you<00:02:00.360> do<00:02:00.600> twenty-five

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
percent health and you do twenty-five

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.840 
percent health and you do twenty-five
percent<00:02:01.229> damage<00:02:01.500> so<00:02:02.159> as<00:02:02.280> you<00:02:02.399> can<00:02:02.460> see<00:02:02.640> my

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
percent damage so as you can see my

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.039 
percent damage so as you can see my
shield<00:02:03.119> is<00:02:03.560> it<00:02:04.560> barely<00:02:05.490> fazed<00:02:06.420> at<00:02:06.659> all<00:02:06.780> and<00:02:06.990> I

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
shield is it barely fazed at all and I

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.119 
shield is it barely fazed at all and I
was<00:02:07.140> up<00:02:07.259> there<00:02:07.380> getting<00:02:07.590> knocked<00:02:07.710> around<00:02:07.860> for

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
was up there getting knocked around for

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.460 
was up there getting knocked around for
a<00:02:08.160> good<00:02:08.190> bit<00:02:08.520> and<00:02:08.840> it<00:02:09.840> just<00:02:10.020> really<00:02:10.379> doesn't

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
a good bit and it just really doesn't

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.170 
a good bit and it just really doesn't
matter<00:02:10.739> the<00:02:10.979> whole<00:02:11.129> are<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.610> only<00:02:11.730> way<00:02:11.910> you

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
matter the whole are the only way you

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.780 
matter the whole are the only way you
can<00:02:12.270> really<00:02:12.330> kill

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
can really kill

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.149 
can really kill
is<00:02:13.090> by<00:02:13.629> shooting<00:02:13.959> up<00:02:14.049> a<00:02:14.140> bunch<00:02:14.349> and<00:02:14.560> it<00:02:14.890> forces

00:02:15.149 --> 00:02:15.159 
is by shooting up a bunch and it forces

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:18.750 
is by shooting up a bunch and it forces
them<00:02:15.370> off<00:02:15.519> the<00:02:15.670> edge<00:02:16.650> this<00:02:17.650> was<00:02:17.799> made<00:02:18.010> i<00:02:18.370> don't

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
them off the edge this was made i don't

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:19.740 
them off the edge this was made i don't
know<00:02:18.849> i<00:02:18.879> wish<00:02:19.120> i<00:02:19.239> could<00:02:19.359> give<00:02:19.510> them<00:02:19.569> credit

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
know i wish i could give them credit

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.780 
know i wish i could give them credit
somebody<00:02:20.260> made<00:02:20.379> this<00:02:20.590> probably<00:02:21.400> originally

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
somebody made this probably originally

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.569 
somebody made this probably originally
and<00:02:22.030> reach<00:02:22.269> no<00:02:23.079> idea<00:02:23.290> who<00:02:23.530> but<00:02:23.920> I<00:02:24.129> mean<00:02:24.430> we've

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:24.579 
and reach no idea who but I mean we've

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:25.709 
and reach no idea who but I mean we've
all<00:02:24.700> done<00:02:24.879> things<00:02:25.090> like<00:02:25.239> this<00:02:25.329> where<00:02:25.629> you

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:25.719 
all done things like this where you

00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:27.000 
all done things like this where you
stick<00:02:25.870> the<00:02:26.019> ceiling<00:02:26.349> usually<00:02:26.590> it's<00:02:26.709> done<00:02:26.859> with

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
stick the ceiling usually it's done with

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.670 
stick the ceiling usually it's done with
shield<00:02:27.250> doors<00:02:27.430> but<00:02:28.239> actually<00:02:28.510> I<00:02:28.780> guess<00:02:29.530> it

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
shield doors but actually I guess it

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:30.960 
shield doors but actually I guess it
sort<00:02:29.859> of<00:02:29.890> depends<00:02:30.159> on<00:02:30.280> how<00:02:30.430> high<00:02:30.640> the<00:02:30.700> shield

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
sort of depends on how high the shield

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.520 
sort of depends on how high the shield
door<00:02:31.120> is<00:02:31.239> but<00:02:31.510> if<00:02:31.780> you<00:02:31.900> stick<00:02:32.079> yourself<00:02:32.260> to<00:02:32.500> a

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
door is but if you stick yourself to a

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:33.869 
door is but if you stick yourself to a
shield<00:02:32.799> or<00:02:32.920> to<00:02:33.189> the<00:02:33.280> ceiling<00:02:33.459> with<00:02:33.640> a<00:02:33.670> shield

00:02:33.869 --> 00:02:33.879 
shield or to the ceiling with a shield

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:35.670 
shield or to the ceiling with a shield
door<00:02:34.090> and<00:02:34.299> you<00:02:34.390> crouch<00:02:34.780> it'll<00:02:35.560> likely

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
door and you crouch it'll likely

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.520 
door and you crouch it'll likely
actually<00:02:36.459> detach<00:02:36.849> it<00:02:37.030> from<00:02:37.060> the<00:02:37.239> ceiling<00:02:37.329> so<00:02:37.689> I

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
actually detach it from the ceiling so I

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.500 
actually detach it from the ceiling so I
also<00:02:39.010> decided<00:02:39.340> to<00:02:39.579> do<00:02:39.700> with<00:02:39.879> gravity<00:02:40.180> volumes

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
also decided to do with gravity volumes

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.550 
also decided to do with gravity volumes
because<00:02:40.720> they're<00:02:41.439> a<00:02:41.470> lot<00:02:41.590> bigger<00:02:41.799> I<00:02:42.099> used<00:02:42.280> the

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
because they're a lot bigger I used the

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.910 
because they're a lot bigger I used the
10<00:02:44.560> by<00:02:44.769> 10<00:02:44.950> or<00:02:45.010> whatever<00:02:45.400> they<00:02:45.549> are<00:02:45.579> and<00:02:46.920> it's

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
10 by 10 or whatever they are and it's

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.759 
10 by 10 or whatever they are and it's
actually<00:02:48.189> two<00:02:48.340> by<00:02:48.489> three<00:02:48.819> of<00:02:49.000> these<00:02:49.510> so<00:02:49.959> it's

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
actually two by three of these so it's

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:53.069 
actually two by three of these so it's
pretty<00:02:50.980> big<00:02:51.220> area<00:02:51.400> really<00:02:51.909> really<00:02:52.450> large<00:02:52.629> so

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:53.079 
pretty big area really really large so

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:55.319 
pretty big area really really large so
you<00:02:53.139> can<00:02:53.319> have<00:02:53.470> I<00:02:53.709> think<00:02:54.040> we<00:02:54.099> had<00:02:54.220> 12<00:02:54.579> or<00:02:55.030> so

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:55.329 
you can have I think we had 12 or so

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:56.759 
you can have I think we had 12 or so
people<00:02:55.569> when<00:02:55.810> we<00:02:55.930> played<00:02:56.139> so<00:02:56.319> I<00:02:56.349> imagine<00:02:56.590> what

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:56.769 
people when we played so I imagine what
