00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:04.740
 Welcome to your channel, Mirna and her manus 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.440
 Today we will make, some puffed rice balls 

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.080
 I hope you like them and make them 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:12.760
 Now for valentines 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.700
 And the ingredients that we are going to use are 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.600
 150 grms of inflated rice chocolate flavor 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.480
 half butter bar 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.600
 and a deep dish full of chocolates 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.580
 We're going to use a teflon pan, 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.600
 and we're going to put it on low heat 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:38.440
 and what we are going to be, it will melt completely 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.220
 our butter 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:51.720
 While it melts, spread it by the edges, from our pot 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:56.220
 so that it is not going to stick, our mixture 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:16.920
 Now, we will mix the butter with the chocolates until they melt 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:24.000
 And today I have you happy, for my facebook page 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.040
 Mirna and her manus 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.180
 for my group Crafts and Tutorials, My passion for recycling 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.020
 For my sister Claudia Cantu, who never misses my videos 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.680
 For lily jara, mercedes lopez 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.240
 and for Reyna Urias Hernandez 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.780
 And now we incorporate our inflated rice 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:55.920
 in the melted chocolates, and we are going to integrate it with the chopstick, very very well. 

00:02:20.236 --> 00:02:22.236
 To a mold, we will put butter, 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.900
 to put our mix 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:35.280
 and leave 2 to 3 minutes to cool down to work, on our balls 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:49.180
 And now, since time has passed, we are making our little balls 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.080
 very well washed our hands 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.960
 Here my daughter, is helping me to realize them 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:05.040
 And she's making a heart, and I get my fingers a little bit 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:12.040
 with butter, not to struggle so much, with rice 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:18.660
 since it feels very sticky, and sticks in the hands 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.480
 Also do not flatten too much 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.300
 because when flattening too much 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.160
 you push the puffed rice, and you get too hard 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.200
 So slight, and if you can not form hearts 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.680
 it's easier, make the balls 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.960
 So we will prepare all of our balls 

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.960
 of puffed rice 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.060
 And here come out, keep making balls 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:12.120
 thanks daughter. 

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:25.220
 And here we have already made them. 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.600
 Now let's introduce them, in a little bag 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:33.000
 and decorate it, or it can also be 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:38.180
 this type of cake tray and decorate it only with a ribbon 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:48.960
 Here I take about one meter, from this list 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.240
 which is called curly, and the only thing we're going to do 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.200
 is to make chinitos, with the help of scissors 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.960
 there are people who know how to do with the 3 together 

00:05:31.062 --> 00:05:33.062
 but then I do not get it 

00:05:33.062 --> 00:05:35.060
 so I do it one by one 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.440
 I feel it's easier 

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.680
 and so my chinitos come out better 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.620
 and here, we have finished our work 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:10.600
 and our puffed rice balls 

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:12.720
 chocolate flavour 

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:16.820
 I hope you liked it, and make them for little gifts 

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:19.700
