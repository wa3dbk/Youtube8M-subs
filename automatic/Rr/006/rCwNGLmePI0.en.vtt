00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.010 
depending on who you speak with you

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:03.830 
depending on who you speak with you
might<00:00:02.190> hear<00:00:02.550> that<00:00:02.580> genetic<00:00:03.060> engineering<00:00:03.600> is

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
might hear that genetic engineering is

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.420 
might hear that genetic engineering is
the<00:00:03.959> most<00:00:04.140> dangerous<00:00:04.290> thing<00:00:04.620> ever<00:00:04.980> or<00:00:05.250> that

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
the most dangerous thing ever or that

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.540 
the most dangerous thing ever or that
there<00:00:05.580> are<00:00:05.609> no<00:00:05.730> dangers<00:00:06.480> at<00:00:06.750> all<00:00:07.189> well<00:00:08.189> I'll

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
there are no dangers at all well I'll

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.839 
there are no dangers at all well I'll
try<00:00:08.790> and<00:00:08.970> give<00:00:09.150> you<00:00:09.769> an<00:00:10.769> objective<00:00:11.550> view

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
try and give you an objective view

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.490 
try and give you an objective view
although<00:00:12.179> iYou<00:00:12.630> know<00:00:12.719> I<00:00:12.840> personally<00:00:12.990> am<00:00:13.469> a

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
although iYou know I personally am a

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.340 
although iYou know I personally am a
scientist<00:00:13.889> so<00:00:14.040> I<00:00:14.070> do<00:00:14.160> have<00:00:14.519> I<00:00:15.020> lean<00:00:16.020> towards

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
scientist so I do have I lean towards

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.720 
scientist so I do have I lean towards
there's<00:00:16.590> not<00:00:16.770> a<00:00:16.800> lot<00:00:17.010> of<00:00:17.039> dangers<00:00:17.460> but<00:00:17.609> if

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
there's not a lot of dangers but if

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.040 
there's not a lot of dangers but if
there<00:00:17.940> were<00:00:18.060> dangerous<00:00:18.510> this<00:00:18.660> is<00:00:18.779> what<00:00:18.930> they

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
there were dangerous this is what they

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.279 
there were dangerous this is what they
would<00:00:19.230> be<00:00:19.380> essentially<00:00:20.720> say<00:00:21.720> you<00:00:21.779> could<00:00:22.170> you

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
would be essentially say you could you

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.230 
would be essentially say you could you
know<00:00:22.439> you<00:00:22.500> you're<00:00:22.890> creating<00:00:23.400> creatures<00:00:23.820> here

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
know you you're creating creatures here

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.710 
know you you're creating creatures here
in<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.720> laboratory<00:00:25.250> who<00:00:26.250> don't<00:00:26.699> exist<00:00:27.359> in<00:00:27.570> the

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
in the laboratory who don't exist in the

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.410 
in the laboratory who don't exist in the
natural<00:00:27.900> world<00:00:28.560> so<00:00:29.340> most<00:00:29.550> of<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:29.820> time<00:00:30.029> we

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
natural world so most of the time we

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.999 
natural world so most of the time we
have<00:00:30.570> to<00:00:30.689> try<00:00:30.869> really<00:00:31.199> hard<00:00:31.289> to<00:00:31.619> keep<00:00:31.769> these

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
have to try really hard to keep these

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.660 
have to try really hard to keep these
creatures<00:00:32.489> alive<00:00:32.960> because<00:00:33.960> all<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:35.130> microbes

and bacteria that are floating around in

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.850 
and bacteria that are floating around in

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
know how to fight really well and they

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.310 
know how to fight really well and they
know<00:00:44.850> how<00:00:44.969> to<00:00:45.000> eat<00:00:45.120> something<00:00:45.629> that's<00:00:45.989> that

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
know how to eat something that's that

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.040 
know how to eat something that's that
you<00:00:47.219> know<00:00:47.340> a<00:00:47.370> genetic<00:00:47.910> engineer<00:00:48.270> just<00:00:48.570> created

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
you know a genetic engineer just created

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.170 
you know a genetic engineer just created
in<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.200> lab<00:00:49.469> but<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.190> problem<00:00:50.579> comes<00:00:50.820> in<00:00:50.969> when

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
in the lab but the problem comes in when

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.979 
in the lab but the problem comes in when
we're<00:00:51.770> engineering<00:00:52.770> things<00:00:53.100> to<00:00:53.510> maybe<00:00:54.510> live

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
we're engineering things to maybe live

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.590 
we're engineering things to maybe live
longer<00:00:55.410> you<00:00:56.190> know<00:00:56.309> or<00:00:56.489> be<00:00:56.699> more<00:00:56.969> Hardy<00:00:57.420> than

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
longer you know or be more Hardy than

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.139 
longer you know or be more Hardy than
the<00:00:57.750> natural<00:00:58.289> kind<00:00:58.559> what<00:00:59.280> we<00:00:59.460> risk<00:00:59.760> here<00:01:00.120> is

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
the natural kind what we risk here is

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.200 
the natural kind what we risk here is
that<00:01:00.390> our<00:01:00.960> engineered<00:01:01.920> version<00:01:02.460> will

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
that our engineered version will

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.980 
that our engineered version will
overcome<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:04.140> destroy<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:05.010> natural<00:01:05.990> natural

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
overcome and destroy the natural natural

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.140 
overcome and destroy the natural natural
niche<00:01:07.530> so<00:01:07.799> say<00:01:08.010> we're<00:01:08.220> making<00:01:08.369> a<00:01:08.640> genetically

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
niche so say we're making a genetically

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.200 
niche so say we're making a genetically
engineered<00:01:09.270> rice<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.290> we<00:01:11.130> lose<00:01:11.670> control<00:01:12.180> of

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
engineered rice and we lose control of

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.330 
engineered rice and we lose control of
this<00:01:12.479> rice<00:01:12.750> crop<00:01:13.110> and<00:01:13.320> soon<00:01:13.560> this<00:01:13.799> rice<00:01:14.040> crop

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
this rice crop and soon this rice crop

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.670 
this rice crop and soon this rice crop
is<00:01:14.520> going<00:01:14.790> around<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.150> country<00:01:15.439> taking<00:01:16.439> over

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
is going around the country taking over

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.980 
is going around the country taking over
other<00:01:16.830> people's<00:01:17.280> rice<00:01:17.520> paddies<00:01:17.970> and<00:01:18.240> then

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
other people's rice paddies and then

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.010 
other people's rice paddies and then
before<00:01:19.920> we<00:01:20.100> know<00:01:20.430> it<00:01:20.610> 90%<00:01:21.390> of<00:01:21.479> all<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.840> rice

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
before we know it 90% of all the rice

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.960 
before we know it 90% of all the rice
crop<00:01:22.320> in<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.500> country<00:01:22.920> is<00:01:23.100> coming<00:01:23.400> from<00:01:23.580> this

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
crop in the country is coming from this

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.830 
crop in the country is coming from this
one<00:01:25.220> rice<00:01:26.220> and<00:01:26.580> if<00:01:26.909> this<00:01:27.090> one<00:01:27.390> rice<00:01:27.630> is

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
one rice and if this one rice is

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.780 
one rice and if this one rice is
susceptible<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:28.470> a<00:01:28.680> disease<00:01:29.040> that<00:01:29.340> means<00:01:29.549> all

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
susceptible to a disease that means all

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.249 
susceptible to a disease that means all
the<00:01:30.030> rice<00:01:30.180> in<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.659> country<00:01:30.990> is<00:01:31.110> now

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
the rice in the country is now

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.950 
the rice in the country is now
susceptible<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:31.920> a<00:01:32.100> disease<00:01:32.460> so<00:01:33.360> we<00:01:33.630> really

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
susceptible to a disease so we really

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.460 
susceptible to a disease so we really
have<00:01:34.170> to<00:01:34.490> think<00:01:35.490> that<00:01:35.759> just<00:01:36.540> because<00:01:36.780> we<00:01:37.259> can

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
have to think that just because we can

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.630 
have to think that just because we can
create<00:01:37.680> our<00:01:37.890> own<00:01:38.130> creatures<00:01:40.310> doesn't<00:01:41.310> mean

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
create our own creatures doesn't mean

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.219 
create our own creatures doesn't mean
that<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.030> creatures<00:01:42.360> that<00:01:42.630> nature<00:01:43.079> had

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
that the creatures that nature had

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.920 
that the creatures that nature had
already<00:01:43.560> has<00:01:43.740> out<00:01:43.950> there<00:01:44.390> aren't<00:01:45.390> good<00:01:45.780> to

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
already has out there aren't good to

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.569 
already has out there aren't good to
keep<00:01:46.110> because<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.409> key<00:01:46.619> is<00:01:46.950> to<00:01:47.399> keep

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
keep because the key is to keep

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.670 
keep because the key is to keep
diversity<00:01:48.450> up<00:01:48.630> you<00:01:49.140> know<00:01:49.229> genetic

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
diversity up you know genetic

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.039 
diversity up you know genetic
engineering<00:01:50.100> is<00:01:50.310> main<00:01:50.670> issue<00:01:51.000> is<00:01:51.299> that<00:01:51.329> once

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
engineering is main issue is that once

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.749 
engineering is main issue is that once
we<00:01:52.229> make<00:01:52.470> something<00:01:52.799> really<00:01:53.159> nice<00:01:53.310> like<00:01:53.579> wow

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
we make something really nice like wow

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.030 
we make something really nice like wow
every<00:01:54.509> one<00:01:54.689> of<00:01:54.720> these<00:01:54.930> apples<00:01:55.380> will<00:01:55.619> be<00:01:55.770> sweet

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
every one of these apples will be sweet

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.280 
every one of these apples will be sweet
you<00:01:56.250> will<00:01:56.399> never<00:01:56.610> have<00:01:56.820> a<00:01:56.880> sour<00:01:57.240> apple<00:01:57.780> you

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
you will never have a sour apple you

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.950 
you will never have a sour apple you
know<00:01:58.409> then<00:01:58.920> everybody<00:01:59.430> wants<00:01:59.790> the<00:02:00.000> tree<00:02:00.719> which

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
know then everybody wants the tree which

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.690 
know then everybody wants the tree which
will<00:02:01.110> only<00:02:01.259> give<00:02:01.530> sweet<00:02:01.860> apples<00:02:02.250> everybody

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
will only give sweet apples everybody

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.190 
will only give sweet apples everybody
wants<00:02:02.939> that<00:02:03.090> but<00:02:03.210> the<00:02:03.299> problem<00:02:03.479> with<00:02:03.840> that<00:02:03.869> is

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
wants that but the problem with that is

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.410 
wants that but the problem with that is
now<00:02:04.710> we're<00:02:04.920> taking<00:02:05.070> away<00:02:05.399> genetic<00:02:05.880> diversity

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
now we're taking away genetic diversity

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.070 
now we're taking away genetic diversity
so<00:02:07.079> the<00:02:07.200> dangers<00:02:07.560> of

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
so the dangers of

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.000 
so the dangers of
engineering<00:02:08.770> and<00:02:09.100> medicine<00:02:10.230> I<00:02:11.230> think<00:02:11.860> you

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
engineering and medicine I think you

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.100 
engineering and medicine I think you
know<00:02:12.130> the<00:02:12.610> pros<00:02:13.000> far<00:02:13.390> outweigh<00:02:13.810> the<00:02:13.990> dangers

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
know the pros far outweigh the dangers

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.620 
know the pros far outweigh the dangers
but<00:02:14.530> the<00:02:14.620> dangers<00:02:14.950> in<00:02:15.310> this<00:02:15.820> situation<00:02:16.390> would

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
but the dangers in this situation would

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:21.840 
but the dangers in this situation would
be<00:02:17.220> creating<00:02:18.220> things<00:02:18.490> which<00:02:20.670> because<00:02:21.670> we're

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
be creating things which because we're

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.570 
be creating things which because we're
using<00:02:22.120> other<00:02:22.540> creatures<00:02:23.320> to<00:02:23.620> create<00:02:24.370> things

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
using other creatures to create things

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.370 
using other creatures to create things
that<00:02:24.760> are<00:02:24.880> useful<00:02:25.180> to<00:02:25.420> us<00:02:25.690> that<00:02:25.900> we<00:02:26.050> will<00:02:26.260> be

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
that are useful to us that we will be

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.520 
that are useful to us that we will be
putting<00:02:26.530> into<00:02:26.800> our<00:02:27.100> body<00:02:27.520> and<00:02:28.110> our<00:02:29.110> immune

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
putting into our body and our immune

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.040 
putting into our body and our immune
system<00:02:30.040> has<00:02:30.340> a<00:02:30.370> wonderful<00:02:31.060> ability<00:02:31.300> to<00:02:31.720> attack

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
system has a wonderful ability to attack

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:33.990 
system has a wonderful ability to attack
foreign<00:02:32.440> substances<00:02:33.160> in<00:02:33.340> our<00:02:33.430> body<00:02:33.670> and<00:02:33.880> it

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
foreign substances in our body and it

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.990 
foreign substances in our body and it
will<00:02:34.180> just<00:02:35.050> attack<00:02:35.380> and<00:02:35.620> eat<00:02:35.800> it<00:02:35.950> up<00:02:36.100> so<00:02:36.760> we

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
will just attack and eat it up so we

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.510 
will just attack and eat it up so we
don't<00:02:37.030> want<00:02:37.480> to<00:02:37.680> create<00:02:38.680> something<00:02:39.130> in<00:02:39.430> a

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
don't want to create something in a

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.850 
don't want to create something in a
bacteria<00:02:40.180> or<00:02:40.300> create<00:02:40.810> something<00:02:41.320> in<00:02:41.410> a<00:02:41.500> goat

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860

into<00:02:44.560> medicine<00:02:45.120> which<00:02:46.120> has<00:02:46.150> traces<00:02:46.840> of<00:02:47.140> that

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
into medicine which has traces of that

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.430 
into medicine which has traces of that
bacterias<00:02:48.430> proteins<00:02:49.390> or<00:02:49.600> traces<00:02:49.990> of<00:02:50.110> that<00:02:50.230> cow

your<00:02:53.290> body<00:02:53.560> might<00:02:54.150> start<00:02:55.150> attacking<00:02:55.420> it<00:02:55.720> which

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
your body might start attacking it which

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.020 
your body might start attacking it which
would<00:02:56.020> be<00:02:56.140> a<00:02:56.170> problem<00:02:56.380> for<00:02:56.740> you<00:02:56.890> not<00:02:57.610> only<00:02:57.640> that

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
would be a problem for you not only that

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.960 
would be a problem for you not only that
the<00:02:58.330> you<00:02:58.900> know<00:02:59.100> when<00:03:00.100> we're<00:03:00.310> using<00:03:00.459> genetic

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
the you know when we're using genetic

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.810 
the you know when we're using genetic
engineering<00:03:01.360> think<00:03:01.720> of<00:03:01.840> it<00:03:01.990> as<00:03:02.700> simply<00:03:03.700> a

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:03.820 
engineering think of it as simply a

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.420 
engineering think of it as simply a
factory<00:03:04.570> to<00:03:05.050> make<00:03:05.080> the<00:03:05.530> medicine<00:03:05.860> that<00:03:06.250> we

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
factory to make the medicine that we

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.720 
factory to make the medicine that we
want<00:03:06.760> instead<00:03:07.600> of<00:03:07.660> machines<00:03:08.320> and<00:03:08.650> gears<00:03:09.040> you

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
want instead of machines and gears you

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.970 
want instead of machines and gears you
have<00:03:09.760> creatures<00:03:10.360> you<00:03:10.540> have<00:03:10.720> bacteria<00:03:10.990> or<00:03:11.800> you

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
have creatures you have bacteria or you

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.910 
have creatures you have bacteria or you
have<00:03:12.190> you<00:03:12.580> know<00:03:12.959> plants<00:03:13.959> or<00:03:14.050> you<00:03:14.110> have<00:03:14.260> cows<00:03:14.560> we

have you know plants or you have cows we

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.550 
have you know plants or you have cows we
just<00:03:15.130> program<00:03:15.580> into<00:03:16.000> them<00:03:16.209> what<00:03:16.959> we<00:03:17.110> want<00:03:17.350> them

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
just program into them what we want them

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.070 
just program into them what we want them
to<00:03:17.709> make<00:03:17.920> and<00:03:18.190> their<00:03:18.400> cells<00:03:18.700> will<00:03:18.940> make<00:03:19.090> it<00:03:19.330> now

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 
to make and their cells will make it now

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.440 
to make and their cells will make it now
what<00:03:20.470> the<00:03:20.560> problem<00:03:20.950> is<00:03:21.130> what<00:03:21.730> if<00:03:21.850> you<00:03:21.970> program

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
what the problem is what if you program

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.250 
what the problem is what if you program
something<00:03:22.750> wrong<00:03:23.290> you<00:03:23.590> know<00:03:23.709> what<00:03:24.400> if<00:03:25.260> your

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
something wrong you know what if your

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.470 
something wrong you know what if your
medicine<00:03:26.590> the<00:03:27.519> molecule<00:03:28.030> in<00:03:28.090> your<00:03:28.150> medicine

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
medicine the molecule in your medicine

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.300 
medicine the molecule in your medicine
should<00:03:28.870> you<00:03:29.080> know<00:03:29.200> look<00:03:29.470> a<00:03:29.620> certain<00:03:29.860> way<00:03:30.010> but

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
should you know look a certain way but

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:31.680 
should you know look a certain way but
it<00:03:30.430> looks<00:03:30.640> a<00:03:30.790> little<00:03:31.000> different<00:03:31.510> because<00:03:31.570> of

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
it looks a little different because of

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.780 
it looks a little different because of
what<00:03:31.989> you<00:03:32.110> programmed<00:03:32.560> wrong<00:03:32.800> and<00:03:33.040> then<00:03:33.489> you

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
what you programmed wrong and then you

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.310 
what you programmed wrong and then you
don't<00:03:34.060> get<00:03:34.209> to<00:03:34.360> test<00:03:34.630> that<00:03:34.780> medicine<00:03:35.080> out

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:35.320 
don't get to test that medicine out

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.860 
don't get to test that medicine out
properly<00:03:36.130> and<00:03:36.340> you<00:03:36.459> realize<00:03:36.820> that<00:03:36.850> 10%<00:03:37.269> of<00:03:37.720> the

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
properly and you realize that 10% of the

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.500 
properly and you realize that 10% of the
human<00:03:38.140> population<00:03:38.830> will<00:03:39.250> have<00:03:40.120> a<00:03:40.150> fatal

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
human population will have a fatal

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.240 
human population will have a fatal
reaction<00:03:41.080> because<00:03:41.380> that<00:03:41.560> molecule<00:03:42.040> is

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
reaction because that molecule is

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.610 
reaction because that molecule is
missing<00:03:42.970> an<00:03:43.090> extra<00:03:43.480> tail<00:03:43.750> or<00:03:44.019> it's<00:03:44.170> missing<00:03:44.500> an
