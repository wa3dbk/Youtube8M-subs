00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
gaming was one of like the reasons how I

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.610 
gaming was one of like the reasons how I
my<00:04:01.480> whole<00:04:01.630> YouTube<00:04:02.020> thing<00:04:02.050> really<00:04:02.320> started

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
my whole YouTube thing really started

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.430 
my whole YouTube thing really started
and<00:04:03.210> like<00:04:04.210> I<00:04:04.300> used<00:04:04.840> to<00:04:04.870> post<00:04:05.110> a<00:04:05.230> bunch<00:04:05.320> of

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
and like I used to post a bunch of

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.590 
and like I used to post a bunch of
competitive<00:04:05.920> gaming<00:04:06.160> stuff<00:04:06.460> and<00:04:06.700> first<00:04:07.480> thing
