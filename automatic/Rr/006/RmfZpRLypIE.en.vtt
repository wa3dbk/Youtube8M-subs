00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.740 
well I think there's a lot going on but

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
and to me it seems to be sort of the

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.160 
and to me it seems to be sort of the

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
the black fans that I know who live in

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.259

Cleveland<00:00:28.890> live<00:00:29.130> in<00:00:29.250> that<00:00:29.369> area<00:00:29.550> they're

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
Cleveland live in that area they're

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.690 
Cleveland live in that area they're
still<00:00:30.570> with<00:00:30.779> LeBron<00:00:31.170> James<00:00:31.500> and<00:00:31.740> excluding

still with LeBron James and excluding

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.639 
still with LeBron James and excluding
from<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:32.940> markets<00:00:33.300> of<00:00:33.450> maybe<00:00:33.719> New<00:00:33.930> York<00:00:34.170> LA

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
from the markets of maybe New York LA

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.560 
from the markets of maybe New York LA
and<00:00:35.190> you<00:00:35.309> know<00:00:35.399> where<00:00:35.579> you<00:00:35.670> expect<00:00:36.059> that<00:00:36.300> fans

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
and you know where you expect that fans

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.540 
and you know where you expect that fans
would<00:00:36.840> have<00:00:37.320> a<00:00:37.350> low<00:00:37.590> opinion<00:00:37.710> of<00:00:38.100> them<00:00:38.280> anyway

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
would have a low opinion of them anyway

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.060 
would have a low opinion of them anyway
I<00:00:39.030> think<00:00:39.420> it's<00:00:39.719> it's<00:00:40.230> it's<00:00:40.469> a<00:00:40.649> definite

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
I think it's it's it's a definite

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.369 
I think it's it's it's a definite
difference<00:00:41.489> um<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:42.120> major<00:00:42.329> thing<00:00:42.690> is<00:00:42.899> that

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
difference um the major thing is that

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.229 
difference um the major thing is that
once<00:00:43.680> that<00:00:43.770> Gilbert<00:00:44.219> came<00:00:44.640> out<00:00:44.850> with<00:00:45.059> those

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
once that Gilbert came out with those

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.299 
once that Gilbert came out with those
statements<00:00:45.840> I<00:00:45.960> think<00:00:46.410> LeBron<00:00:46.649> got<00:00:46.920> a<00:00:46.980> lot<00:00:47.190> of

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
statements I think LeBron got a lot of

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.100 
statements I think LeBron got a lot of
people<00:00:47.610> on<00:00:47.789> his<00:00:48.090> side<00:00:48.329> in<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.930> black

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
people on his side in the black

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.600 
people on his side in the black
community<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:49.590> particularly<00:00:50.010> was<00:00:50.280> Jesse

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
Jackson went out there and threw a short

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.319 
Jackson went out there and threw a short
of<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.770> racial<00:00:53.160> grenade<00:00:53.309> on<00:00:53.730> it<00:00:53.910> that's<00:00:54.149> great

think<00:01:37.560> you<00:01:37.860> do<00:01:38.070> have<00:01:38.280> a<00:01:38.310> big<00:01:39.000> split<00:01:39.590> among<00:01:40.590> fans

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
think you do have a big split among fans

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.060 
think you do have a big split among fans
racially<00:01:41.909> yeah<00:01:42.659> that's<00:01:42.960> extremely<00:01:43.500> well<00:01:43.770> said

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
racially yeah that's extremely well said

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.490 
racially yeah that's extremely well said
I<00:01:44.310> have<00:01:44.610> not<00:01:44.820> stepped<00:01:45.750> back<00:01:45.930> and<00:01:46.170> thought<00:01:46.320> of

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
I have not stepped back and thought of

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.450 
I have not stepped back and thought of
it<00:01:46.619> quite<00:01:46.829> that<00:01:47.009> way

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
it quite that way

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.450 
it quite that way
in<00:01:47.520> part<00:01:48.030> because<00:01:48.420> this<00:01:49.380> is<00:01:49.590> an<00:01:49.710> extremely

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
in part because this is an extremely

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.109 
in part because this is an extremely
small<00:01:50.670> sample<00:01:51.420> size<00:01:51.630> but<00:01:51.990> my<00:01:52.799> black<00:01:53.490> followers

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
small sample size but my black followers

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.880 
small sample size but my black followers
on<00:01:54.390> just<00:01:55.079> my<00:01:55.200> Twitter<00:01:55.590> page<00:01:57.619> again<00:01:58.619> I'm<00:01:58.710> just

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
on just my Twitter page again I'm just

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:05.749 
on just my Twitter page again I'm just
this<00:01:59.280> is<00:01:59.460> it's<00:01:59.579> not<00:01:59.670> that<00:01:59.850> small<00:02:00.090> at<00:02:00.270> 75<00:02:04.759> that's

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
this is it's not that small at 75 that's

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:06.959 
this is it's not that small at 75 that's
me

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:06.969 
me

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:10.150 
me
and<00:02:07.969> again<00:02:08.209> I'm<00:02:08.330> I'm<00:02:08.690> even<00:02:09.170> stereotyping<00:02:09.950> this

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
and again I'm I'm even stereotyping this

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.589 
and again I'm I'm even stereotyping this
because<00:02:10.459> I'm<00:02:10.580> just<00:02:10.610> sort<00:02:10.940> of<00:02:11.000> doing<00:02:11.209> a<00:02:11.330> feel<00:02:11.569> of

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:11.599 
because I'm just sort of doing a feel of

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:14.530 
because I'm just sort of doing a feel of
it<00:02:11.959> but<00:02:12.170> but<00:02:12.650> a<00:02:12.709> number<00:02:13.099> of<00:02:13.250> them<00:02:13.430> on<00:02:13.970> a<00:02:14.209> daily

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
it but but a number of them on a daily

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.650 
it but but a number of them on a daily
basis<00:02:15.019> are<00:02:15.709> still<00:02:16.160> spewing<00:02:17.030> some<00:02:17.360> real

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
basis are still spewing some real

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.839 
basis are still spewing some real
negativity<00:02:18.530> toward<00:02:18.890> LeBron<00:02:19.280> that<00:02:19.670> they're

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:19.849 
negativity toward LeBron that they're

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:23.380 
negativity toward LeBron that they're
just<00:02:20.150> fed<00:02:20.629> up<00:02:20.660> a<00:02:20.989> racial<00:02:21.980> divide<00:02:22.160> no<00:02:22.790> it<00:02:23.120> didn't

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
just fed up a racial divide no it didn't

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:24.789 
just fed up a racial divide no it didn't
strike<00:02:23.599> me<00:02:23.720> and<00:02:23.959> I'd<00:02:24.019> be<00:02:24.140> the<00:02:24.260> first<00:02:24.290> to<00:02:24.560> tell

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.470

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
also have to understand that I think as

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.080 
also have to understand that I think as
as<00:02:38.630> he<00:02:38.989> makes<00:02:39.200> the<00:02:39.440> comments<00:02:39.860> in<00:02:39.980> in<00:02:40.190> Jeju<00:02:40.760> and

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
as he makes the comments in in Jeju and

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.660 
as he makes the comments in in Jeju and
certain<00:02:41.599> things<00:02:41.720> that<00:02:41.959> he<00:02:42.110> said<00:02:42.380> he<00:02:43.010> is<00:02:43.250> sort

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
certain things that he said he is sort

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.520 
certain things that he said he is sort
of<00:02:43.730> gradually<00:02:44.450> losing<00:02:44.959> people<00:02:45.140> because

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
of gradually losing people because

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.140 
of gradually losing people because
they're<00:02:45.680> wondering<00:02:46.130> what<00:02:46.610> is<00:02:46.700> he<00:02:46.849> really

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
they're wondering what is he really

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.360 
they're wondering what is he really
about<00:02:47.360> what<00:02:47.599> is<00:02:47.690> he<00:02:47.810> really<00:02:48.110> trying<00:02:49.010> to<00:02:49.160> say

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
about what is he really trying to say

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.369 
about what is he really trying to say
but<00:02:49.430> I<00:02:49.790> do<00:02:49.849> think<00:02:50.239> that<00:02:50.450> there's<00:02:50.810> a<00:02:50.930> yacht<00:02:51.140> a

00:02:51.369 --> 00:02:51.379 
but I do think that there's a yacht a

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:53.500 
but I do think that there's a yacht a
lot<00:02:51.620> of<00:02:51.769> young<00:02:52.010> black<00:02:52.280> men<00:02:52.519> that<00:02:52.849> still<00:02:53.269> look

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
lot of young black men that still look

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.050 
lot of young black men that still look
up<00:02:53.690> to<00:02:53.750> LeBron<00:02:54.079> just<00:02:54.890> like<00:02:55.069> people<00:02:55.760> couldn't

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
up to LeBron just like people couldn't

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.059 
up to LeBron just like people couldn't
understand<00:02:56.480> why<00:02:57.019> Atlanta<00:02:57.440> won't<00:02:57.620> let<00:02:57.799> go<00:02:57.920> of

00:02:58.059 --> 00:02:58.069 
understand why Atlanta won't let go of

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:59.440 
understand why Atlanta won't let go of
Michael<00:02:58.370> Vick<00:02:58.549> and<00:02:58.700> that's<00:02:58.910> because<00:02:59.269> LeBron

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
Michael Vick and that's because LeBron

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.839 
Michael Vick and that's because LeBron
James<00:02:59.989> is<00:03:00.230> a<00:03:00.260> picture<00:03:00.739> of<00:03:00.769> success<00:03:01.099> to<00:03:01.579> young

00:03:01.839 --> 00:03:01.849 
James is a picture of success to young

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:04.089 
James is a picture of success to young
black<00:03:02.150> America<00:03:02.780> and<00:03:03.079> he's<00:03:03.290> gonna<00:03:03.410> always<00:03:03.890> be

00:03:04.089 --> 00:03:04.099 
black America and he's gonna always be

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:05.949 
black America and he's gonna always be
that<00:03:04.340> so<00:03:04.730> they<00:03:04.879> see<00:03:04.940> a<00:03:05.090> young<00:03:05.209> black<00:03:05.690> guy<00:03:05.900> who

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959 
that so they see a young black guy who

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:08.680 
that so they see a young black guy who
was<00:03:06.379> able<00:03:06.560> to<00:03:06.829> control<00:03:07.700> his<00:03:07.940> destiny<00:03:08.450> he's<00:03:08.660> a

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
was able to control his destiny he's a

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:10.720 
was able to control his destiny he's a
major<00:03:09.019> businessman<00:03:09.739> he's<00:03:10.160> making<00:03:10.459> all<00:03:10.579> these

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
major businessman he's making all these

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.879 
major businessman he's making all these
moves<00:03:11.030> and<00:03:11.299> even<00:03:11.720> better<00:03:11.930> he's<00:03:12.230> kept<00:03:12.560> his<00:03:12.650> high

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:12.889 
moves and even better he's kept his high

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:14.620 
moves and even better he's kept his high
school<00:03:13.130> friends<00:03:13.459> around<00:03:13.700> him<00:03:13.940> so<00:03:14.389> they<00:03:14.569> see

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630 
school friends around him so they see

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.900 
school friends around him so they see
that<00:03:14.930> as<00:03:15.139> sort<00:03:15.290> of<00:03:15.410> an<00:03:15.530> empowering<00:03:16.040> empowering

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
that as sort of an empowering empowering

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.420 
that as sort of an empowering empowering
thing<00:03:17.209> so<00:03:17.660> I<00:03:17.690> think<00:03:17.780> he<00:03:18.049> still<00:03:18.319> has<00:03:18.560> this<00:03:18.889> sort

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
thing so I think he still has this sort

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.370 
thing so I think he still has this sort
of<00:03:19.489> image<00:03:19.970> in<00:03:20.120> the<00:03:20.480> black<00:03:20.690> community<00:03:21.200> as<00:03:21.350> a

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
of image in the black community as a

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.620 
of image in the black community as a
real<00:03:21.709> leader<00:03:22.099> and<00:03:22.370> a<00:03:22.430> superstar<00:03:22.910> I<00:03:23.180> can<00:03:23.389> see

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 
real leader and a superstar I can see

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.009 
real leader and a superstar I can see
that<00:03:23.840> but<00:03:24.739> the<00:03:25.489> reason<00:03:25.670> I<00:03:25.910> lost<00:03:26.209> sight<00:03:26.599> was

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:27.019 
that but the reason I lost sight was

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:29.319 
that but the reason I lost sight was

am<00:03:51.889> i<00:03:51.980> right<00:03:52.190> yeah<00:03:53.030> that's<00:03:53.540> so<00:03:53.720> that's<00:03:53.989> the<00:03:54.230> way

00:03:54.339 --> 00:03:54.349 
am i right yeah that's so that's the way

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:56.080 
am i right yeah that's so that's the way
it<00:03:54.470> was<00:03:54.590> going<00:03:54.769> skip<00:03:55.130> and<00:03:55.310> then<00:03:55.549> Dan<00:03:55.819> Gilbert

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
it was going skip and then Dan Gilbert

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.210 
it was going skip and then Dan Gilbert
let<00:03:56.540> him<00:03:56.750> off<00:03:56.930> the<00:03:56.959> hook<00:03:57.169> and<00:03:57.530> I<00:03:57.620> think<00:03:57.919> that

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
let him off the hook and I think that

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:59.740 
let him off the hook and I think that
changed<00:03:58.910> the<00:03:59.030> course<00:03:59.060> of<00:03:59.450> the<00:03:59.540> conversation

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
changed the course of the conversation

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:02.620 
changed the course of the conversation
hasn't<00:04:00.680> changed<00:04:01.250> the<00:04:01.310> public<00:04:01.700> opinion<00:04:02.269> no<00:04:02.450> of

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:02.630 
hasn't changed the public opinion no of

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:05.289 
hasn't changed the public opinion no of
no<00:04:02.870> but<00:04:03.440> I<00:04:03.500> think<00:04:03.889> again<00:04:04.430> within<00:04:04.760> the<00:04:04.970> black

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:05.299 
no but I think again within the black

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:08.319 
no but I think again within the black
community<00:04:05.329> it<00:04:05.989> totally<00:04:06.739> changed<00:04:07.310> it<00:04:07.489> because

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:08.329 
community it totally changed it because

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:10.479 
community it totally changed it because
again<00:04:08.840> you<00:04:09.049> had<00:04:09.260> him<00:04:09.410> put<00:04:09.620> out<00:04:09.709> this<00:04:09.889> vitriol

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:10.489 
again you had him put out this vitriol

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:13.180 
again you had him put out this vitriol
he's<00:04:10.790> putting<00:04:11.090> curses<00:04:11.569> up<00:04:11.959> LeBron<00:04:12.169> and<00:04:13.069> I

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
he's putting curses up LeBron and I

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.150 
he's putting curses up LeBron and I
think<00:04:13.459> they<00:04:13.579> saw<00:04:13.819> the<00:04:13.880> response<00:04:14.299> you<00:04:14.930> know

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.160 
think they saw the response you know

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.830 
think they saw the response you know
the<00:04:15.460> of<00:04:15.820> the<00:04:15.970> police<00:04:16.269> having<00:04:16.540> to<00:04:16.600> stand

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
the of the police having to stand

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.509 
the of the police having to stand
outside<00:04:17.019> as<00:04:17.290> murals<00:04:17.680> supposedly<00:04:18.220> they<00:04:18.310> went

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 
outside as murals supposedly they went

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:20.790 
outside as murals supposedly they went
to<00:04:18.580> his<00:04:18.700> home<00:04:18.910> outside<00:04:19.810> of<00:04:20.019> Cleveland<00:04:20.530> because

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:20.800 
to his home outside of Cleveland because

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.530 
to his home outside of Cleveland because
they<00:04:20.920> feared<00:04:21.190> that<00:04:21.310> somebody<00:04:21.700> may<00:04:21.850> do<00:04:22.000> do

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:22.540 
they feared that somebody may do do

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.420 
they feared that somebody may do do
something<00:04:22.810> to<00:04:23.050> them<00:04:23.170> so<00:04:23.380> I<00:04:23.410> think<00:04:23.830> it<00:04:24.190> just

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
something to them so I think it just

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.420 
something to them so I think it just
really<00:04:24.910> triggered<00:04:25.510> some<00:04:25.780> images<00:04:26.620> at<00:04:27.220> least

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430 
really triggered some images at least

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:28.800 
really triggered some images at least
for<00:04:27.880> a<00:04:27.910> lot<00:04:28.060> of<00:04:28.090> black<00:04:28.300> people<00:04:28.450> out<00:04:28.600> there

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
for a lot of black people out there

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.420 
for a lot of black people out there
there's<00:04:29.050> no<00:04:29.170> question<00:04:29.440> but<00:04:29.500> even<00:04:29.770> yesterday<00:04:29.980> I

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.430 
there's no question but even yesterday I

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:31.800 
there's no question but even yesterday I
think<00:04:30.730> some<00:04:30.970> black<00:04:31.150> people<00:04:31.510> would<00:04:31.630> probably

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
think some black people would probably

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.980 
think some black people would probably
have<00:04:32.110> read<00:04:32.290> those<00:04:32.470> comments<00:04:33.190> to<00:04:33.550> GQ<00:04:34.270> and<00:04:34.780> step

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:40.560 
have read those comments to GQ and step
back<00:04:35.170> LeBron<00:04:38.400> and<00:04:39.400> I<00:04:39.520> did<00:04:39.670> not<00:04:39.850> know<00:04:40.060> I'm
