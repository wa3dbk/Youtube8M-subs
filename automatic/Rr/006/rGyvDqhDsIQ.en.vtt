00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.920
 wonderful exercises are also one of 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:17.700
 the most difficult question is not 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:20.330
 settling on one leg it is done so 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:23.429
 keeps all weight on one leg with horns 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:26.970
 rises from the ground and we crouch and 

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:29.310
 innogames this leg is not sold concerns 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:33.050
 whom it will be according to 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:35.700
 or you straight and raise 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:39.360
 how close you squat depends 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:42.030
 from your petri and ankle stretching 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.280
 needle of the tower so if some place 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.399
 something of the tour you can not sit down 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.480
 how much can you do and what 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.879
 note 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.719
 when you sit down look at 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.269
 sit down and touch touch stop 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:00.300
 concerns our hips 

00:00:56.269 --> 00:01:03.570
 foot made the air can be her beavers 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:06.150
 so you can pull out as you prefer hands 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.040
 if ahead it is easier for us to hold it 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.170
 in place as all the same all month 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:14.040
 only on one leg 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:17.880
 We rise if suddenly pain in the knee 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:20.220
 or somewhere else that means exercise 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:24.150
 done wrong and check every 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:26.850
 moment of lowering and raising next 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:30.270
 the moment we go down we 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:33.020
 do it slowly and although made friend 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:36.390
 new train on the background always 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:41.369
 we start slowly and just as slowly we 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:43.860
 rise slowly if you do 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.530
 fast fast down and try for it 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.680
 already streams climb run you can 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.920
 to injure this bunch we 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:54.500
 to form knees and generally it is impossible 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:59.450
 doing exercises fast she is done 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:02.150
 slowly we sat down watching my leg 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:04.580
 the foot fully touches the floor 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:07.790
 I do not roll from heel to toe and 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:10.070
 vice versa if you roll 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:13.540
 you can hurt this rewards here 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:16.820
 detached from the floor and all the time on weight and 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.600
 Marie tilted slightly forward tilted 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:23.450
 to this leg 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:24.739
 to keep me in the moment moskaleva 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.989
 if you do several in a row 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:29.930
 exercises for nut din to touch the floor 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:31.450
 if you can not keep the balance 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:36.890
 use the system 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:38.840
 it will be a little bit of hack as but 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:46.850
 improve your technique you can use 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:50.300
 all so keep going advise 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:52.220
 use the wall as a separate support 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.140
 also bring him a nearby look 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:57.850
 Exercise can be entitled to receive 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:03:01.070
 make and you some other supports 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:03.910
 if you have some kind of table or beast 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:08.480
 or something like that to you 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:11.239
 wound and lean and so if you take in 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.720
 hands forward then ours is better 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:16.760
 balance so we go down 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:20.299
 keep elin now you can a little bit 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:22.340
 use it to raise our 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:23.900
 prop and don't forget to do but both 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.390
 parties because it is always the same 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:29.299
 more stable than the other need to develop them 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:32.209
 the same way and if you can't do it 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:34.720
 exercise because you are missing 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:37.140
 flexibility start 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.140
 activity
