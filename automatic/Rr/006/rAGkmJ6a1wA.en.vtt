got a pretty good dose of noodles this
time<00:02:31.620> I<00:02:31.920> hope<00:02:32.190> I<00:02:32.340> have<00:02:32.520> enough<00:02:32.550> water<00:02:33.000> I<00:02:33.390> think

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
time I hope I have enough water I think

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.980 
time I hope I have enough water I think
I<00:02:34.320> do<00:02:34.640> so<00:02:35.640> i<00:02:35.670> think<00:02:35.880> i'm<00:02:36.240> going<00:02:36.420> to<00:02:36.510> let<00:02:36.720> these

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
I do so i think i'm going to let these

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.900 
I do so i think i'm going to let these
noodles<00:02:37.320> relax<00:02:37.920> and<00:02:38.220> get<00:02:38.310> down<00:02:38.520> into<00:02:38.760> the

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
noodles relax and get down into the

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.540 
noodles relax and get down into the
water<00:02:39.620> then<00:02:40.620> i'm<00:02:40.740> going<00:02:40.890> to<00:02:40.950> put<00:02:41.130> a<00:02:41.160> cover<00:02:41.430> on

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
water then i'm going to put a cover on

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.230 
water then i'm going to put a cover on
it<00:02:41.730> and<00:02:42.090> let<00:02:42.540> the<00:02:42.600> whole<00:02:42.750> thing<00:02:42.900> set<00:02:43.560> for<00:02:43.980> a<00:02:44.280> few

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
it and let the whole thing set for a few

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.810 
it and let the whole thing set for a few
minutes<00:02:45.510> and<00:02:45.930> i<00:02:46.710> think<00:02:47.040> that<00:02:47.310> will<00:02:47.520> cook<00:02:47.790> the

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
minutes and i think that will cook the

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:54.800 
minutes and i think that will cook the
noodles<00:02:49.220> and<00:02:52.040> allow<00:02:53.040> the<00:02:53.670> vegetables<00:02:54.630> to

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
noodles and allow the vegetables to

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.760 
noodles and allow the vegetables to
rehydrate<00:02:55.200> quite<00:02:56.070> nicely<00:02:57.170> but<00:02:58.170> i<00:02:58.260> do<00:02:58.320> want<00:02:58.710> to

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
rehydrate quite nicely but i do want to

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:01.790 
rehydrate quite nicely but i do want to
get<00:02:59.960> everything<00:03:00.960> below<00:03:01.320> the<00:03:01.350> waterline

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
get everything below the waterline

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.340 
get everything below the waterline
before<00:03:02.340> i<00:03:02.370> put<00:03:02.580> the<00:03:02.670> lid<00:03:02.880> on<00:03:02.910> and<00:03:03.810> these

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
before i put the lid on and these

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.290 
before i put the lid on and these
noodles<00:03:04.650> are<00:03:04.950> really<00:03:05.490> starting<00:03:05.760> to<00:03:06.000> relax

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
noodles are really starting to relax

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.870 
noodles are really starting to relax
nicely<00:03:06.930> now<00:03:07.110> and<00:03:07.320> go<00:03:07.470> go<00:03:08.130> down<00:03:08.160> and<00:03:08.750> I<00:03:09.750> think

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
nicely now and go go down and I think

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.310 
nicely now and go go down and I think
while<00:03:11.880> I'd<00:03:12.090> get<00:03:12.270> everything<00:03:12.630> right<00:03:12.810> here<00:03:13.140> I

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
while I'd get everything right here I

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.430 
while I'd get everything right here I
think<00:03:13.770> I've<00:03:13.920> got<00:03:13.950> to<00:03:14.160> put<00:03:14.370> I<00:03:14.750> I<00:03:15.750> know<00:03:16.110> whether<00:03:16.380> I

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
think I've got to put I I know whether I

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.370 
think I've got to put I I know whether I
mention<00:03:16.890> not<00:03:17.100> but<00:03:17.730> the<00:03:17.850> garlic<00:03:18.270> was<00:03:18.959> already

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
mention not but the garlic was already

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.690 
mention not but the garlic was already
in<00:03:19.500> there<00:03:19.770> and<00:03:20.690> I'm<00:03:21.690> going<00:03:21.900> to<00:03:22.050> put<00:03:22.340> if<00:03:23.340> i<00:03:23.489> can

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
in there and I'm going to put if i can

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:30.949 
in there and I'm going to put if i can
get<00:03:23.820> it<00:03:23.880> open<00:03:28.880> put<00:03:29.880> in<00:03:30.000> the<00:03:30.090> liquid<00:03:30.300> bullion<00:03:30.720> of

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
get it open put in the liquid bullion of

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:37.620 
get it open put in the liquid bullion of
the<00:03:31.020> boy<00:03:31.200> and<00:03:31.380> paste<00:03:33.020> and<00:03:34.020> let<00:03:34.200> that

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.480 

simmer<00:03:38.320> with<00:03:38.530> the<00:03:38.680> rest<00:03:38.860> of<00:03:38.980> it<00:03:39.130> for<00:03:39.340> a<00:03:39.370> little

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:39.490 
simmer with the rest of it for a little

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:43.140 
simmer with the rest of it for a little
while<00:03:40.740> you<00:03:41.740> should<00:03:41.980> add<00:03:42.160> some<00:03:42.430> flavor<00:03:42.700> to<00:03:42.850> it<00:03:43.000> I

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
while you should add some flavor to it I

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:48.120 
while you should add some flavor to it I
think<00:03:43.770> get<00:03:44.770> it<00:03:44.890> dispersed<00:03:45.370> evenly<00:03:46.950> this<00:03:47.950> will

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.130 
think get it dispersed evenly this will

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.070 
think get it dispersed evenly this will
give<00:03:48.160> the<00:03:48.310> noodles<00:03:48.760> a<00:03:48.880> chance<00:03:49.180> to<00:03:49.420> soak<00:03:49.750> up<00:03:49.900> the

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:50.080 
give the noodles a chance to soak up the

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.380 
give the noodles a chance to soak up the
flavor<00:03:50.410> of<00:03:50.560> everything<00:03:51.430> else<00:03:51.910> and<00:03:52.210> give

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.390 
flavor of everything else and give

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:56.810 
flavor of everything else and give
everything<00:03:52.720> a<00:03:52.930> chance<00:03:53.230> to<00:03:54.150> theoretically

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
everything a chance to theoretically

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.580 
everything a chance to theoretically

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.200 
all the way around i think that i think
that<00:04:47.830> was<00:04:48.010> a<00:04:48.040> good<00:04:48.130> way<00:04:48.400> to<00:04:48.430> go<00:04:48.640> i<00:04:48.670> think<00:04:49.060> that

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
that was a good way to go i think that

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:54.900 
that was a good way to go i think that
was<00:04:49.360> a<00:04:49.890> good<00:04:50.890> command<00:04:51.340> decision<00:04:52.920> but<00:04:53.920> in<00:04:54.760> the

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:54.910 
was a good command decision but in the

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:59.880 
was a good command decision but in the
end<00:04:55.060> the<00:04:55.750> proof<00:04:56.050> is<00:04:56.230> in<00:04:56.260> the<00:04:56.440> taste<00:04:56.770> so<00:04:58.800> see<00:04:59.800> if

00:04:59.880 --> 00:04:59.890 
end the proof is in the taste so see if

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:01.350 
end the proof is in the taste so see if
i<00:04:59.980> can<00:05:00.130> get<00:05:00.250> enough<00:05:00.520> in<00:05:00.640> this<00:05:00.730> up<00:05:00.970> here<00:05:01.180> to<00:05:01.270> get

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.360 
i can get enough in this up here to get

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.870 
i can get enough in this up here to get
it<00:05:01.420> my<00:05:01.660> mouth<00:05:01.870> to<00:05:02.050> taste<00:05:02.080> it<00:05:02.500> I<00:05:02.890> know<00:05:03.550> right<00:05:03.850> now
