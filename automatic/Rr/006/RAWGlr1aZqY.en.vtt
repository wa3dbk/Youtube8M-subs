00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:24.960 

just<00:03:19.209> a<00:03:19.359> little<00:03:19.510> and<00:03:19.889> then<00:03:20.889> I<00:03:23.280> just<00:03:24.280> run<00:03:24.819> it

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
just a little and then I just run it

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:34.140 
just a little and then I just run it
through<00:03:26.849> like<00:03:27.849> this

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.190 

make<00:03:34.840> sure<00:03:34.870> the<00:03:35.349> ends<00:03:35.560> are<00:03:36.299> get<00:03:37.299> all<00:03:37.450> of<00:03:37.659> it<00:03:37.810> is

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
make sure the ends are get all of it is

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:46.710 
make sure the ends are get all of it is
pretty<00:03:39.069> well<00:03:42.000> and<00:03:43.000> what<00:03:43.329> I<00:03:43.360> do<00:03:43.510> is<00:03:43.659> um<00:03:45.689> when<00:03:46.689> I

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720

attention to is when you blow dry your
hair<00:04:25.680> there<00:04:26.680> is<00:04:26.800> kind<00:04:27.010> of<00:04:27.130> a<00:04:27.250> science<00:04:27.669> behind

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 
hair there is kind of a science behind

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.610 
hair there is kind of a science behind
it<00:04:28.240> it's<00:04:28.389> very<00:04:28.599> important<00:04:29.080> that<00:04:29.110> you<00:04:29.289> don't

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620 
it it's very important that you don't

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.219 
it it's very important that you don't
just<00:04:29.979> blow<00:04:30.729> dryer<00:04:31.000> here<00:04:31.270> in<00:04:31.360> any<00:04:31.539> different

00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:32.229 
just blow dryer here in any different

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:34.650 
just blow dryer here in any different
direction<00:04:32.860> you<00:04:33.460> really<00:04:33.759> want<00:04:33.970> to<00:04:34.060> focus<00:04:34.240> on

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
direction you really want to focus on

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:37.080 
direction you really want to focus on
blow<00:04:35.410> drying<00:04:35.650> down<00:04:35.979> and<00:04:36.370> the<00:04:36.550> reason<00:04:36.849> for<00:04:36.880> that

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
blow drying down and the reason for that

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:41.040 
blow drying down and the reason for that
is<00:04:37.599> because<00:04:37.979> your<00:04:38.979> scalp<00:04:39.910> produces<00:04:40.870> natural

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.050 
is because your scalp produces natural

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:45.450 
is because your scalp produces natural
oils<00:04:41.680> for<00:04:42.370> your<00:04:42.550> hair<00:04:42.789> and<00:04:43.830> when<00:04:44.830> you<00:04:44.949> blow<00:04:45.190> dry

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460 
oils for your hair and when you blow dry

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.370 
oils for your hair and when you blow dry
all<00:04:45.639> over<00:04:45.910> the<00:04:46.030> place<00:04:46.270> you're<00:04:47.169> not

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:47.380 
all over the place you're not

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.490 
all over the place you're not
distributing<00:04:48.160> the<00:04:48.760> oils<00:04:49.180> properly<00:04:49.870> when<00:04:50.409> you

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500 
distributing the oils properly when you

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.710 
distributing the oils properly when you
blow<00:04:50.680> dry<00:04:50.919> down<00:04:50.979> you're<00:04:51.970> distributing<00:04:52.360> the

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
blow dry down you're distributing the

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.589 
blow dry down you're distributing the
oil<00:04:52.930> and<00:04:53.380> the<00:04:53.409> product<00:04:54.190> that<00:04:54.220> you<00:04:54.340> also<00:04:54.669> added

00:04:55.589 --> 00:04:55.599 
oil and the product that you also added

00:04:55.599 --> 00:04:57.629 
oil and the product that you also added
into<00:04:55.840> your<00:04:55.900> hair<00:04:56.199> down<00:04:56.800> the<00:04:57.070> shaft<00:04:57.310> of<00:04:57.580> the

00:04:57.629 --> 00:04:57.639 
into your hair down the shaft of the

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:02.129 
into your hair down the shaft of the
hair<00:04:57.909> and<00:04:58.210> it's<00:04:58.990> getting<00:04:59.349> to<00:04:59.680> the<00:05:01.020> ends<00:05:02.020> of<00:05:02.080> the

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:02.139 
hair and it's getting to the ends of the

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:05.189 
hair and it's getting to the ends of the
cuticles<00:05:02.800> of<00:05:03.039> each<00:05:03.870> individual<00:05:04.870> strand

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:05.199 
cuticles of each individual strand

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:07.200 
cuticles of each individual strand
whereas<00:05:06.070> when<00:05:06.250> you<00:05:06.310> go<00:05:06.460> all<00:05:06.580> over<00:05:06.789> the<00:05:06.970> place

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:07.210 
whereas when you go all over the place

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:10.170 
whereas when you go all over the place
you<00:05:07.479> kind<00:05:08.320> of<00:05:08.470> don't<00:05:09.130> distribute<00:05:09.490> the<00:05:09.849> oils

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:10.180 
you kind of don't distribute the oils

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:11.790 
you kind of don't distribute the oils
properly<00:05:10.690> and<00:05:10.870> therefore<00:05:11.199> your<00:05:11.320> hair<00:05:11.530> feels

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:11.800 
properly and therefore your hair feels

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.700
