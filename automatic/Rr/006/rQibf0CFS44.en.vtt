00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.620
 there 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:15.529
 the common cathode configuration display 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:18.020
 which we send to the peak each one 

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:21.320
 it's like the common cathode configuration what 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:23.810
 he says pulls out a negative then they would be 10 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.150
 negative that go to the peak at the port that 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.220
 I am here pointing and here the port 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.080
 revealed would be the letters the letters that 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.029
 they come each with their color and here 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.739
 we can see that each cable if it has a 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:35.780
 color and that color is the difference 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:38.570
 because they are my catch behind the 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.940
 elements the display then we go to 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.470
 look at the operation let's see the 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.660
 operation of the board to which 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.520
 You can look at the panel that you have 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.470
 eight buttons this is a reset button 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.970
 this is a button start button 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.340
 run to the right to run to the 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:55.280
 left to increase comment 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.470
 correct cali same visiting we are going to 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.360
 try out 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:03.860
 under one minute the minute time 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.860
 let's press start 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:11.450
 and he's going to run the 55 minutes we want 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.750
 remember you and we will enter 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:17.690
 goals we have for example a goal from 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:20.630
 we can see it with this button 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.430
 what it says and for a visitor goal with 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.100
 this button we see ourselves in another 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:28.370
 hit and we have let's say no goals 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:30.860
 for through the expelled 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:32.990
 we will not call between thirty and two 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.180
 seconds of period one of the part of 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.490
 party then now that the 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.140
 account automatically reset the system 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.420
 I will be put on rest period 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.670
 that appears in the letter d as well 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.160
 automatically in the one of the posted 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:49.010
 'network time is going to take a while 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:51.350
 of 15 minutes of rest those 15 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.330
 Rest minutes can be canceled if 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.700
 I want with the start button and it happens 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.580
 automatically to the period if you 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:01.540
 they want for your application can 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:03.890
 set up 90 minutes with the panel 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:06.440
 increase and decrease of left and 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.960
 you're good here but we can see that 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:11.870
 went to rest time every 15 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:14.420
 minutes here as a chair I start to 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.490
 press visitor and local can not 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.500
 as they realize at rest they do not 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:20.060
 can add goals 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.220
 now there is a possibility is that 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:25.950
 get ahead be 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:27.840
 let's say for the second seconds passes 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.090
 periods begins the accounting that 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.860
 We gave it at the beginning the configuration in 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.960
 initial configuration was one minute 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.120
 as we can see there being returned is 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:38.760
 of the minute then here you can already 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.640
 look at the LEDs how LEDs work 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:44.340
 are are are we made some segments 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:47.000
 of four LEDs per segment and the 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:50.250
 we connect in parallel so that the 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.500
 board will work better and turn on 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.940
 one way in a more correct way the 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.070
 we can use for what they want or 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:59.430
 be for any football match 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:01.530
 basketball is that they have possibilities 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.170
 of driving because we have big values 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.890
 for for markers and also for 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:09.690
 time web 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:11.800
 the wiring management was done with 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.230
 using the different colors that 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.180
 they have the braided cable then with 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.940
 that we can guide and save and we 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:22.290
 saved a lot of time in the organization 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:25.990
 in isis let's see the simulation in x 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:29.290
 I'm going to start at zero and I'll 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:31.480
 set 10 minutes into the game as 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.550
 I'm going to do the configuration starts in 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.680
 this display then what I'm going to do 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:40.380
 is that it moves to the right as in 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.380
 it is here is the right button 

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:46.440
 now what we are going to do is here we go 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:48.570
 to enter here we are going to place for 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:52.010
 two hours here we have two hours 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:55.819
 now let's run with start 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:58.730
 and there starts to decrease two 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:04:01.069
 hours of play per time and we're going to 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.439
 increase the goals of local and of 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:06.049
 visitor and a home goal and a goal from 

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:10.090
 visitor if we want we can put another 

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:13.189
 reset and reconfigure 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:15.450
 for example in this case I'm going to give 

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:18.109
 I'm going to configure 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:20.959
 10 minutes 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:24.280
 and now look here ten minutes and 60 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:29.290
 seconds then start 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:33.400
 and in the first time 10 minutes goes 0 0 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:37.090
 I'm going to add a goal to the local and a 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:40.139
 goal to the visitor ivÃ¡n this is our 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.139
 simulation in crisis
