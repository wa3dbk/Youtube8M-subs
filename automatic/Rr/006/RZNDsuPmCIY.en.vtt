00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:11.059
 attention this video is dedicated to 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:13.490
 all the people who want to improve 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:15.620
 in the art of trolling in the explain 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:18.230
 classes to troll common failures of 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:20.740
 troll what a troll should do and how 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:20.740
 must go 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:27.600
 here we are with the troll classes in 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.760
 first place to search and destroy van 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.290
 to be the first two mainly in 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.820
 first place for when to look and 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:35.489
 destroy our team is attacking 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.559
 a class as a riot shield 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:41.520
 Assault shield in this game forgiveness is 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:43.140
 fundamental to to mare the enemy 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.760
 our goal is worth when we do 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.339
 to be catching an enemy or several 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.469
 and Mariano variable or enclose the 

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:52.809
 variable we throw a confusion adore 

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:54.820
 a shock load or a blinding and you 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:56.379
 let's go around if the enemy has 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.229
 little sensitivity will be impossible 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:01.110
 for him to kill us and it's going to be something 

00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:03.450
 quite fun 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.370
 and in our second attempt it's going to be 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.960
 locked up if we're playing a group or 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:09.659
 if the enemy is a camper and he gets in 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.609
 a corner we alone can 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.429
 in this assault shield as I've already 

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:16.530
 said bulletproof vest advantages for 

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:18.270
 that they do not kill us with the text 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.270
 grenades that we throw ourselves if they try us 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.700
 throw 11 4 over light weight for 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.439
 move faster obviously but not 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.350
 let's go in a turtle against an enemy 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.240
 trying to run away running agile hands 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.829
 to throw the shocked hours very 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.049
 fast and not give him time to kill us 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.599
 if he shoots us when we take off the 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.399
 tactical mask shield well the same as 

00:01:36.599 --> 00:01:40.229
 bulletproof vest for if they throw us 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:42.030
 shocked the instigators or charges 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.739
 of shock that do not affect us and 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.289
 extreme conditioning to get 

00:01:43.739 --> 00:01:48.569
 before to the conflict sites if not 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:50.369
 we take them round the end and we have not 

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:53.759
 reached the goal because the shield 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.469
 it weighs a lot of lethal c4 just in case 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.840
 complicate things and I see that I know 

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:59.369
 three enemies together as we throw the c4 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.530
 to one side we charge two and already 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:05.039
 we can troll and the shocked now 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:07.349
 to spin the enemy or try 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:09.450
 enclose I recommend if we go to 

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:11.849
 troll the group that one in eight times 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.700
 4 and carry 2 with function adoras or 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:16.700
 blinding or loads of chone 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.560
 perfect now the second class for 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.890
 trolling this is for when we defend 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.690
 in search and destroy main or 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.390
 secondary a weapon with which we are 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.700
 as I recommend this weapon is 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:32.750
 will use to kill until the last 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:35.209
 enemy or if we are not playing the group 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.730
 bulky if we're playing between 1 and 3 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:39.440
 people then simply if we go to 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.390
 make a ninja and there are people defending 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.160
 while the other is activating then 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.500
 we kill those around and that 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.840
 reactivates a weapon 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.000
 Main with two fundamental accessories 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.230
 silencer is mandatory if it is a 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.959
 sub-machine gun, I recommend for 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.849
 weaken the other accessory to yours 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:57.799
 layout but a silencer 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:03:00.170
 mandatory because we're going to kill glued 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:01.519
 the uncle who is activating if not then 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.120
 turn around and kill them if we take 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:05.489
 judgment 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.470
 advantage a few light weights so that for 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:09.710
 get to the downtown area before 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.550
 weigh less we got here 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:14.720
 and we do not fall if we are uploaded 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.310
 we are living somewhere high 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.800
 to do online as it happens in some 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.270
 maps so we do not hurt ourselves by falling and 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.820
 it sounds 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:24.980
 2 fundamental cold blood advantage if you 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:27.680
 not tuning out is like Cecilio 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:30.050
 of modern warfare 3 cold advantage in 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.240
 Cold blood is mandatory 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:34.070
 advantage 3 extreme conditioning what 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:37.310
 same as hero person to get before 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:39.740
 to the place and deadly silence good and 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:42.470
 extreme conditioning to get 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:45.320
 before the switch and deadly silence is 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:48.170
 fundamental for when we get up 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:50.060
 that the enemy does not hear us from lethal 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.090
 lethal we can take them in text the 11th and 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:55.580
 petti with the grenade we died 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:58.190
 unbearable the c4 looks a little 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:59.810
 clamor you can not and the battle ax 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:03.080
 the elbow comes out tilted so that we 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:06.200
 see here bulls we invest between the people 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:08.090
 it makes noise when it comes out but if they kill us 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.160
 Well, the people who have many 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:13.150
 possibilities of killing the one who has 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:15.129
 killed because it falls to the ground and explodes 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:19.060
 but nevertheless I to do the ninja 

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:22.210
 I would recommend hi bulls inventive centex 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:24.850
 it can also be and if we do not want 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.800
 none of those two hitters but now 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:28.479
 because I have put on signs because with 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.889
 we can carry the grenade 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:33.639
 smoke and a ninja will always be 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:35.620
 better with the smoke so perfect and as 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:37.600
 third class if what we are looking for are 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.910
 cries of the enemy we make ourselves a class 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:43.180
 with the rpg it does not have to be gold 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:44.800
 like mine and fundamental blind eye we 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.660
 it does not matter what we are going to 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.490
 reappear let's kill one let's go to 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:51.130
 record their screams or listen to them and 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:53.440
 let's die played no more will it be 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:54.760
 kill kill kill and die can you 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.500
 stay in positive we will lower the 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:59.020
 proportion and nothing but a proportion gives 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:02.199
 same blind eye so we can leave 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:04.810
 when it is against a team there is 

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:07.840
 gray of 62 good ones that have been taken out 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:10.419
 very high gusts because for example the 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:12.430
 Helicopter Helicopter being the 

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:15.580
 white helicopter 2 then we went out with 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:17.020
 this and they do not do us any advantage 2 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.420
 Cold blood so you do not see them 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:22.140
 equally and agile hands to pull 

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:24.310
 before the c4 of advantage 3 

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:27.070
 conditioning extreme condition 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:28.600
 extreme and be test with conditioning 

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:30.340
 extreme we can is to ask myself in time 

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:32.740
 that lower them weigh more than the shield and 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:34.420
 It makes us very tired and with stress 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:36.370
 we aim faster if we go running 

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:38.980
 and we see a guy because we aim faster 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:40.630
 and it's much more than 4 for when we see 

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:42.520
 a guy up close and not enough time 

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:44.650
 we killed ourselves and killed the enemy 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:47.430
 and black hat to deactivate all 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:49.930
 its gusts or airplanes this is quite 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:52.090
 so nothing these are the three classes 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:53.980
 the third does not mention it the beginning 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:56.290
 because it is optional only for who goes 

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:58.330
 to record screams or have a good time 

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:59.920
 well listening to others' screams and 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:01.900
 for a few occasions but both 

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:04.120
 first are the main ones now let's go 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:06.280
 with what a troll should not do 

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:08.620
 troll must kill the last enemy 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:10.960
 bring fragmentation grenade because 

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:14.620
 he would kill himself they shoot without silencer 

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:16.960
 you can not tell the enemies that you 

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:19.240
 are going to troll or wear badge 

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:22.890
 clan things like troll pigs or things 

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:22.890
 similar because already give me the cante 

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:30.930
 a good troll should never be alarmed 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:33.210
 when he sees an enemy pass by he does not go 

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:35.520
 he the troll only gets up when they see 

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:37.950
 that an enemy is lying or standing or 

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:39.300
 on your knees next to the pump and see that 

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:41.700
 is placing the pump that you see 

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:45.030
 clearly in that case it's time the 

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:46.590
 throne comes near and deactivates we can 

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:48.860
 say that we have become a ninja of 

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:48.860
 fixed 

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:55.950
 congratulations if you have seen this video 

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:57.390

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:59.640
