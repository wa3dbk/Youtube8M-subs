00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
two different types of f-35 the first

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:25.189 
two different types of f-35 the first
one<00:00:17.490> we<00:00:17.850> have<00:00:20.060> is<00:00:21.560> on<00:00:22.970> the<00:00:23.970> first<00:00:24.330> up<00:00:24.539> 35<00:00:24.990> that

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
one we have is on the first up 35 that

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:33.620 
one we have is on the first up 35 that
came<00:00:25.410> out<00:00:26.000> on<00:00:27.000> explain<00:00:27.420> 9<00:00:27.599> org<00:00:28.019> phone<00:00:30.289> and<00:00:32.630> you

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
came out on explain 9 org phone and you

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.139 
came out on explain 9 org phone and you
can't<00:00:33.870> start<00:00:34.170> off<00:00:34.350> going<00:00:35.219> in<00:00:35.399> stubble<00:00:36.000> mode

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
can't start off going in stubble mode

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.850 
can't start off going in stubble mode
you<00:00:36.690> so<00:00:36.899> you<00:00:36.960> have<00:00:37.200> to<00:00:37.410> switch<00:00:38.010> to<00:00:39.860> forward

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
you so you have to switch to forward

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.680 
you so you have to switch to forward
mode<00:00:41.300> one<00:00:42.300> goes<00:00:42.480> straight<00:00:42.780> forward<00:00:44.539> breaks<00:00:45.539> it

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
mode one goes straight forward breaks it

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:56.020 
mode one goes straight forward breaks it
off<00:00:45.840> no<00:00:46.440> flats<00:00:46.770> really<00:00:47.250> necessary<00:00:54.170> those<00:00:55.170> have

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
off no flats really necessary those have

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.900 
off no flats really necessary those have
fling<00:00:57.030> become<00:00:57.420> this<00:00:58.379> is<00:00:58.649> a<00:00:58.829> one<00:00:59.219> aircraft<00:00:59.640> that

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
fling become this is a one aircraft that

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:15.430 
fling become this is a one aircraft that
does<00:01:00.149> have<00:01:00.420> airfoil

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
so as you can see pretty good playing

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.710 
so as you can see pretty good playing

has three libraries there's a us unite

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.580 
has three libraries there's a us unite
there's<00:01:24.380> a<00:01:24.470> British<00:01:25.360> Library<00:01:26.360> Blue<00:01:27.200> Angels

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
there's a British Library Blue Angels

library and this lightning f-35 stubble
library<00:01:34.660> you<00:01:35.660> have<00:01:35.690> to<00:01:35.930> turn<00:01:36.110> on<00:01:36.380> and<00:01:36.560> off<00:01:36.650> the

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
library you have to turn on and off the

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.650 
library you have to turn on and off the
fuel<00:01:38.050> and<00:01:39.050> for<00:01:39.680> all<00:01:39.770> have<00:01:40.460> to<00:01:40.790> control<00:01:41.240> that<00:01:41.480> or

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:41.660 
fuel and for all have to control that or

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.990 
fuel and for all have to control that or
else<00:01:41.810> they'll<00:01:42.500> get<00:01:42.740> wobble<00:01:43.250> and<00:01:43.460> I'll<00:01:43.700> go<00:01:43.880> out

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
else they'll get wobble and I'll go out

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000 
else they'll get wobble and I'll go out
of<00:01:44.030> control<00:01:46.870> yeah<00:01:47.870> you<00:01:47.930> can't<00:01:48.320> really<00:01:48.620> go<00:01:48.890> in

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:49.010 
of control yeah you can't really go in

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:50.890 
of control yeah you can't really go in
hover<00:01:49.220> mode<00:01:49.490> if<00:01:49.670> you<00:01:49.820> take<00:01:50.030> off<00:01:50.240> you<00:01:50.540> have<00:01:50.630> to

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:50.900 
hover mode if you take off you have to

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.020 
hover mode if you take off you have to
get<00:01:51.860> a<00:01:51.890> lot<00:01:52.070> of<00:01:52.100> training<00:01:52.430> in<00:01:52.670> but<00:01:52.880> there's

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
get a lot of training in but there's

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.940 
get a lot of training in but there's
also<00:01:53.210> an<00:01:53.960> other<00:01:54.620> version<00:01:56.260> that<00:01:57.260> I<00:01:57.290> have<00:01:57.590> which

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
also an other version that I have which

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:06.820 
also an other version that I have which
is<00:01:57.980> the

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:18.460 

auto<00:02:08.320> script<00:02:09.320> version

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.400 

this<00:02:19.190> one<00:02:19.400> you<00:02:19.520> can<00:02:19.550> take<00:02:19.880> off<00:02:20.060> has<00:02:20.450> just<00:02:21.170> one

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
this one you can take off has just one

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.130 
this one you can take off has just one
in<00:02:21.590> painting<00:02:22.130> and<00:02:22.340> then<00:02:23.210> some<00:02:23.390> marine<00:02:23.660> bending

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
in painting and then some marine bending

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.850 
in painting and then some marine bending
over<00:02:24.610> breaks<00:02:25.610> off<00:02:26.020> so<00:02:27.020> you<00:02:27.140> can<00:02:27.290> go<00:02:27.470> straight

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
over breaks off so you can go straight

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:33.430 
over breaks off so you can go straight
up<00:02:28.070> gear<00:02:28.640> up<00:02:30.160> around<00:02:31.160> all<00:02:31.490> in<00:02:31.820> all<00:02:31.970> you<00:02:32.150> can<00:02:32.440> go

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
up gear up around all in all you can go

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.310 
up gear up around all in all you can go
and<00:02:33.740> hover<00:02:33.980> in<00:02:34.370> midair<00:02:34.750> then<00:02:35.750> it<00:02:35.960> lets<00:02:36.140> you

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
and hover in midair then it lets you

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:41.020 
and hover in midair then it lets you
take<00:02:36.560> off<00:02:36.800> straight<00:02:37.340> like<00:02:37.760> this<00:02:39.070> so<00:02:40.070> all<00:02:40.250> the

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
take off straight like this so all the

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:42.700 
take off straight like this so all the
other<00:02:41.180> one<00:02:41.390> has<00:02:41.540> more<00:02:41.720> features<00:02:42.020> but<00:02:42.380> this<00:02:42.590> is

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:42.710 
other one has more features but this is

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:49.030 
other one has more features but this is
just<00:02:42.740> a<00:02:43.010> better<00:02:43.190> plane<00:02:43.840> overall<00:02:47.590> this<00:02:48.590> doesn't

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
just a better plane overall this doesn't

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.540 
just a better plane overall this doesn't
have<00:02:49.160> the<00:02:49.310> detail<00:02:49.730> but<00:02:50.150> um<00:02:50.980> the<00:02:51.980> taking<00:02:52.400> off

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
have the detail but um the taking off

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.850 
have the detail but um the taking off
abilities<00:02:53.510> and<00:02:53.780> just<00:02:54.050> the<00:02:54.140> overall<00:02:54.290> flight

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
abilities and just the overall flight

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.340 
abilities and just the overall flight
plane<00:02:55.190> is<00:02:56.150> way<00:02:56.360> better<00:02:56.570> on<00:02:56.720> this<00:02:56.959> one<00:02:57.140> but<00:02:57.320> this

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
plane is way better on this one but this

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:03.910 
plane is way better on this one but this
one<00:02:57.500> doesn't<00:02:57.890> have<00:02:58.160> air<00:02:58.340> foil<00:02:58.760> so<00:03:02.680> as<00:03:03.680> you<00:03:03.830> guys

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
one doesn't have air foil so as you guys

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.120 
one doesn't have air foil so as you guys
can<00:03:04.130> see<00:03:04.190> now<00:03:04.520> on<00:03:05.270> the<00:03:05.470> weather<00:03:06.470> is<00:03:06.680> a<00:03:06.709> bit<00:03:06.800> bad

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
change the vertical mode all right gear

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.699 
change the vertical mode all right gear
down<00:04:08.150> always<00:04:08.569> so<00:04:09.319> it's<00:04:10.720> good<00:04:11.720> site<00:04:12.019> I<00:04:12.260> have<00:04:12.560> it
