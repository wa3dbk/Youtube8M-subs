my<00:01:48.540> predictions<00:01:49.079> on<00:01:49.259> these<00:01:49.439> two<00:01:49.619> pools<00:01:49.890> I

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
my predictions on these two pools I

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.859 
my predictions on these two pools I
think<00:01:50.340> EG<00:01:50.729> and<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:50.970> opticnation<00:01:51.329> are<00:01:51.720> going

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
think EG and the opticnation are going

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.600 
think EG and the opticnation are going
to<00:01:51.930> advance<00:01:52.140> from<00:01:52.320> a<00:01:52.470> I<00:01:52.530> think<00:01:52.799> us<00:01:52.950> and<00:01:53.310> NVR

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
to advance from a I think us and NVR

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.520 
to advance from a I think us and NVR
going<00:01:53.880> to<00:01:53.939> advance<00:01:54.180> from<00:01:54.360> Group<00:01:54.600> B<00:01:54.780> and<00:01:55.049> how<00:01:55.409> it

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
going to advance from Group B and how it

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.410 
going to advance from Group B and how it
works<00:01:55.710> after<00:01:56.159> that<00:01:56.340> you<00:01:56.610> guys<00:01:56.759> saw<00:01:57.000> all<00:01:57.270> the

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
works after that you guys saw all the

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.209 
works after that you guys saw all the
teams<00:01:58.130> how<00:01:59.130> it<00:01:59.189> works<00:01:59.340> after<00:01:59.700> that<00:01:59.850> is<00:02:00.060> um<00:02:01.219> it's

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
teams how it works after that is um it's

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.370 
teams how it works after that is um it's
basically<00:02:02.610> like<00:02:02.850> cross<00:02:03.149> multiplication<00:02:03.689> so

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
basically like cross multiplication so

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.950 
basically like cross multiplication so
number<00:02:05.100> one<00:02:05.310> from<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:05.729> a<00:02:05.820> pool<00:02:06.240> is<00:02:06.479> going<00:02:06.899> to

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
number one from the a pool is going to

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.260 
number one from the a pool is going to
play<00:02:07.110> number<00:02:07.380> 2<00:02:07.590> from<00:02:07.890> BP<00:02:08.039> and<00:02:08.700> number<00:02:09.060> one

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
play number 2 from BP and number one

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.760 
play number 2 from BP and number one
from<00:02:09.479> be<00:02:09.660> pool<00:02:09.899> is<00:02:10.020> going<00:02:10.140> to<00:02:10.200> play<00:02:10.319> number<00:02:10.590> two

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
from be pool is going to play number two

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.940 
from be pool is going to play number two
from<00:02:10.979> a<00:02:11.160> pool<00:02:11.430> and

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.170 

going<00:02:14.069> to<00:02:14.129> be<00:02:14.190> a<00:02:14.220> single<00:02:14.520> elimination<00:02:15.060> bracket

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
going to be a single elimination bracket

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.270 
going to be a single elimination bracket
after<00:02:15.810> that<00:02:15.989> so<00:02:16.230> the<00:02:16.349> top<00:02:16.530> two<00:02:16.680> teams<00:02:16.890> advance

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280

group plays number to an opposite group
and<00:02:23.450> single<00:02:24.450> imitation<00:02:24.810> I'm<00:02:24.900> not<00:02:25.019> sure<00:02:25.080> if<00:02:25.260> its

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
and single imitation I'm not sure if its

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.500 
and single imitation I'm not sure if its
best<00:02:25.590> of<00:02:25.680> five<00:02:25.739> our<00:02:26.099> best<00:02:26.370> of<00:02:26.550> seven<00:02:26.940> but<00:02:27.420> it's

a<00:03:05.819> it's<00:03:06.150> nerve-racking<00:03:06.810> be<00:03:07.079> if<00:03:07.319> the<00:03:07.440> other

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
a it's nerve-racking be if the other

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.100 
a it's nerve-racking be if the other
team<00:03:07.769> comes<00:03:08.040> out<00:03:08.160> hot<00:03:08.430> when<00:03:08.640> you're<00:03:08.760> cold<00:03:09.110> it's

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
team comes out hot when you're cold it's

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.410 
team comes out hot when you're cold it's
really<00:03:10.470> really<00:03:10.680> hard<00:03:10.860> to<00:03:11.010> win<00:03:11.190> uh<00:03:11.819> and<00:03:12.390> that

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
really really hard to win uh and that

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.509 
really really hard to win uh and that
just<00:03:12.810> it<00:03:13.049> it<00:03:13.410> doesn't<00:03:13.650> really<00:03:13.890> show<00:03:14.130> you<00:03:14.190> know

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
just it it doesn't really show you know

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:17.120 
just it it doesn't really show you know
how<00:03:14.760> prepared<00:03:15.569> you<00:03:15.690> are<00:03:15.810> I<00:03:16.319> mean<00:03:16.530> it<00:03:16.650> does<00:03:16.829> in<00:03:17.069> a

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
how prepared you are I mean it does in a

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.069 
how prepared you are I mean it does in a
sense<00:03:17.400> but<00:03:17.670> like<00:03:17.849> you<00:03:18.510> guys<00:03:18.660> know<00:03:18.870> what<00:03:18.959> I'm

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
sense but like you guys know what I'm

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:21.080 
sense but like you guys know what I'm
saying<00:03:19.319> it's<00:03:19.560> it<00:03:19.769> all<00:03:19.920> relies<00:03:20.190> on<00:03:20.250> one<00:03:20.639> series

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
saying it's it all relies on one series

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.180 
saying it's it all relies on one series
the<00:03:21.269> better<00:03:21.450> team<00:03:21.690> doesn't<00:03:22.139> always<00:03:22.560> win<00:03:22.920> in

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
the better team doesn't always win in

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.960 
the better team doesn't always win in
call<00:03:23.670> of<00:03:23.700> duty<00:03:23.850> and<00:03:24.209> I<00:03:25.370> think<00:03:26.370> that's<00:03:26.549> why<00:03:26.670> pool

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
call of duty and I think that's why pool

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.690 
call of duty and I think that's why pool
play<00:03:27.180> is<00:03:27.389> a<00:03:27.420> very<00:03:27.720> very<00:03:27.959> good<00:03:28.319> thing<00:03:29.010> for<00:03:29.459> the

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
play is a very very good thing for the

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.460 
play is a very very good thing for the
pros<00:03:29.970> especially<00:03:30.630> for<00:03:30.750> x<00:03:30.870> games<00:03:31.049> because<00:03:31.350> it

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
pros especially for x games because it

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.410 
pros especially for x games because it
is<00:03:31.590> such<00:03:31.769> a<00:03:31.799> big<00:03:32.010> tournament<00:03:32.340> just<00:03:33.239> like
