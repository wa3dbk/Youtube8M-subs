00:00:00.509 --> 00:00:03.750
 The next step is how to inflict 

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:07.970
 and a whole bunch of ACI's to add to videos and photos 

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:14.089
 the click will open the corresponding directory can do 

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:15.809
 what else I change 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.300
 MEMA animal 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.630

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.989
 with several albums 

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:24.429
 Biker meeting

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.769
 Banksy imported are shown here on the left side of 

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:32.910
 refers to here now when I get up 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.010
 Retrieving the replay press was dated since the escape 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.950
 I can now synonymous these videos differently on the outskirts 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:42.930
 I can go home 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.020
 and everyone gets their child 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:46.350
 would have here 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.240
 and it can also move the Vitus 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.550
 I can still see a video for example in the Fairmont 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:55.890
 go to the club 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.120
 and it is gutted again 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.120
 Knaus Publishing still remove 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.100

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.340
 NetSuite Obama to enter 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.340
 the length of the representations here 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.690
 shows still still manages the distance of important points two 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:24.130
 Support Springer days 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.800

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.550
 longer day deleted 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.140
 Thomas Dietsche to clarify 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.140
 because it fits it knows everybody knows it for example 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.160
 what we are advancing 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.350
 he has a shift Bush as smaller 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.290

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.290
 to present the child Janssen 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.460
 I can watch this video 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.300

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.309
 that's nothing to start with 

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:12.309
 even harder 

00:02:14.639 --> 00:02:17.319
 this does not seem to be at hand 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:19.179
 Gehlen here 

00:02:19.179 --> 00:02:21.189

 the civil occur 

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:46.249
 By now we are doing Patrick Kurth 

00:02:46.249 --> 00:02:49.339
 to have too 

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:52.159

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:04.229
 Now have a quick way out 

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:06.209
 Beyond that 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:09.209
 I can not even to her back to start plus 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:12.829
 I suppose I have inserted it 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:14.169

00:03:14.169 --> 00:03:16.099
 find the little ones 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:19.299

 cheap development delightfully inserted in front of these areas 

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:30.599
 I can fix it now, for example 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:31.759
 BLE 

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:33.639
