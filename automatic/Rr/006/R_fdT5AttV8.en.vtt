00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:30.730 
performance of our in pgl it's really
good<00:04:26.660> but<00:04:27.370> some<00:04:28.370> some<00:04:29.270> unexpected<00:04:30.199> results

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740 
good but some some unexpected results

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.460

first<00:04:33.740> and<00:04:34.100> then<00:04:34.910> was<00:04:35.150> really<00:04:35.870> it<00:04:36.050> was<00:04:36.080> really

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:36.260 
first and then was really it was really

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.100

hard<00:04:36.740> to<00:04:36.770> win<00:04:36.979> against<00:04:37.400> him<00:04:37.550> is<00:04:37.699> to<00:04:38.060> one<00:04:38.270> score

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
hard to win against him is to one score

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:40.689 
hard to win against him is to one score
I<00:04:39.139> didn't<00:04:39.680> expected<00:04:40.100> that<00:04:40.160> because<00:04:40.400> I<00:04:40.550> am

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:40.699 
I didn't expected that because I am

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:42.070 
I didn't expected that because I am
really<00:04:40.850> good<00:04:41.090> against<00:04:41.419> night<00:04:41.600> off<00:04:41.780> and

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
really good against night off and

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.050 
really good against night off and
yesterday<00:04:42.680> I<00:04:42.710> played<00:04:42.830> pretty<00:04:43.220> bad<00:04:43.520> against

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
yesterday I played pretty bad against

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.300 
yesterday I played pretty bad against
League<00:04:44.240> or<00:04:44.660> well<00:04:44.990> I<00:04:45.410> honestly<00:04:45.860> I<00:04:45.919> think<00:04:46.100> he

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.310 
League or well I honestly I think he

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:48.100 
League or well I honestly I think he
just<00:04:46.520> watched<00:04:46.729> my<00:04:46.970> replace<00:04:47.330> against<00:04:47.630> soo<00:04:47.810> hand

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.110 
just watched my replace against soo hand

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:50.200 
just watched my replace against soo hand
made<00:04:48.590> some<00:04:48.860> strategy<00:04:49.370> just<00:04:49.639> against<00:04:50.060> my

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.210 
made some strategy just against my

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:53.400 
made some strategy just against my
strategy<00:04:50.930> so<00:04:51.139> he<00:04:51.590> was<00:04:51.680> better<00:04:51.889> already

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:53.410 
strategy so he was better already

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:56.080 
strategy so he was better already
the<00:04:54.410> rest<00:04:54.620> I<00:04:54.770> think<00:04:55.040> most<00:04:55.550> pretty<00:04:55.760> okay

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.090 
the rest I think most pretty okay

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:59.620 
the rest I think most pretty okay
between<00:04:56.630> grabby<00:04:57.050> is<00:04:57.200> very<00:04:57.590> good<00:04:57.889> so<00:04:58.510> what<00:04:59.510> is

00:04:59.620 --> 00:04:59.630 
between grabby is very good so what is

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:03.370 
between grabby is very good so what is
the<00:04:59.750> best<00:04:59.960> matchup<00:05:00.229> right<00:05:00.530> now<00:05:00.680> my<00:05:02.380> first

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:03.380 
the best matchup right now my first

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:06.070 
the best matchup right now my first
night<00:05:03.680> of<00:05:03.860> I<00:05:03.979> think<00:05:04.270> together<00:05:05.270> is<00:05:05.720> against

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080 
night of I think together is against

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.400 
night of I think together is against
dark<00:05:06.350> but<00:05:06.700> it's<00:05:07.700> harder<00:05:08.000> to<00:05:08.030> win<00:05:08.270> orc<00:05:08.510> anyway

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:09.410 
dark but it's harder to win orc anyway

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:14.080 
dark but it's harder to win orc anyway
400<00:05:11.440> do<00:05:12.440> you<00:05:12.530> think<00:05:12.919> there's<00:05:13.100> some<00:05:13.610> imbalance

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.090 
400 do you think there's some imbalance

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:17.200 
400 do you think there's some imbalance
there<00:05:14.300> between<00:05:14.600> oaken<00:05:15.229> and<00:05:15.530> undead<00:05:16.250> only<00:05:17.060> this

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:17.210 
there between oaken and undead only this

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:21.670 
there between oaken and undead only this
matchup<00:05:17.740> in<00:05:18.740> cycle<00:05:19.280> is<00:05:20.120> a<00:05:20.840> bit<00:05:21.260> more<00:05:21.470> a<00:05:21.620> bit

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:21.680 
matchup in cycle is a bit more a bit

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.400 
matchup in cycle is a bit more a bit
more<00:05:21.919> strong<00:05:22.820> as<00:05:23.030> an<00:05:23.180> undead<00:05:23.539> and<00:05:23.720> Blademaster

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:24.410 
more strong as an undead and Blademaster

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:25.930 
more strong as an undead and Blademaster
is<00:05:24.530> really<00:05:24.830> hard<00:05:25.070> around<00:05:25.550> it

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:25.940 
is really hard around it

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:29.050 
is really hard around it
so<00:05:26.539> for<00:05:27.080> Warcraft<00:05:27.770> in<00:05:27.889> general<00:05:28.280> everything<00:05:28.789> is

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:29.060 
so for Warcraft in general everything is

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:31.270 
so for Warcraft in general everything is
quite<00:05:29.330> balanced<00:05:30.169> as<00:05:30.350> I<00:05:30.470> thought<00:05:30.650> oh<00:05:30.710> and<00:05:30.979> and

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:31.280 
quite balanced as I thought oh and and

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.040 
quite balanced as I thought oh and and
and<00:05:31.880> it<00:05:32.060> is<00:05:32.240> that<00:05:32.419> what<00:05:32.539> you're<00:05:32.660> trying<00:05:32.720> to<00:05:32.840> say

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:33.050 
and it is that what you're trying to say

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:36.219 
and it is that what you're trying to say
no<00:05:33.530> orc<00:05:34.130> is<00:05:34.520> pretty<00:05:34.850> weak<00:05:35.030> against<00:05:35.539> human<00:05:35.930> and

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:36.229 
no orc is pretty weak against human and

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:39.520 
no orc is pretty weak against human and
that<00:05:37.160> just<00:05:37.669> very<00:05:38.000> match<00:05:38.300> my<00:05:38.510> chaps<00:05:38.810> to<00:05:39.410> be

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:39.530 
that just very match my chaps to be

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:41.469 
that just very match my chaps to be
discussed<00:05:39.919> about<00:05:40.220> but<00:05:40.490> if<00:05:40.700> we<00:05:40.910> will<00:05:41.240> change

00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:41.479 
discussed about but if we will change

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:44.140 
discussed about but if we will change
something<00:05:41.780> in<00:05:42.200> this<00:05:42.590> the<00:05:43.280> whole<00:05:43.639> balance<00:05:43.820> will

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:44.150 
something in this the whole balance will

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:45.969 
something in this the whole balance will
be<00:05:44.300> broken<00:05:44.539> I<00:05:44.840> think<00:05:45.139> it's<00:05:45.260> pretty<00:05:45.380> ok<00:05:45.770> right

00:05:45.969 --> 00:05:45.979 
be broken I think it's pretty ok right

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:50.950 
be broken I think it's pretty ok right
now<00:05:46.240> but<00:05:47.240> that<00:05:47.960> of<00:05:48.169> its<00:05:48.620> trunk<00:05:49.130> overall<00:05:49.970> that's

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:50.960 
now but that of its trunk overall that's

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:52.260 
now but that of its trunk overall that's
my<00:05:51.139> personal<00:05:51.560> opinion

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:52.270
