not<00:02:32.280> but<00:02:33.090> I<00:02:33.120> have<00:02:33.210> to<00:02:33.420> say<00:02:33.600> the<00:02:33.780> exam<00:02:34.050> was<00:02:34.560> very

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
not but I have to say the exam was very

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.220 
not but I have to say the exam was very
similar<00:02:35.400> to<00:02:35.580> the<00:02:35.730> CPC<00:02:36.240> practice<00:02:36.390> exam<00:02:36.780> I

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
similar to the CPC practice exam I

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.010 
similar to the CPC practice exam I
purchased<00:02:38.130> through<00:02:38.430> the<00:02:38.460> site<00:02:39.030> I<00:02:39.420> actually

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
purchased through the site I actually

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.020 
purchased through the site I actually
think<00:02:40.380> the<00:02:40.590> practice<00:02:41.010> exam<00:02:41.370> may<00:02:41.640> have<00:02:41.820> been

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
think the practice exam may have been
