00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
didn't say this whether that's actually

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.220 
didn't say this whether that's actually
going<00:00:59.460> to<00:00:59.520> be<00:00:59.610> in<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.850> chest<00:01:00.150> once<00:01:00.840> you<00:01:00.960> find

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
going to be in the chest once you find

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.250 
going to be in the chest once you find
that<00:01:01.350> simply<00:01:01.860> read<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.130> notes<00:01:02.600> by<00:01:03.600> going<00:01:04.050> into

that simply read the notes by going into
your<00:01:04.410> inventory<00:01:05.070> and<00:01:05.280> after<00:01:06.090> that<00:01:06.240> you<00:01:06.570> I

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
your inventory and after that you I

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.690 
your inventory and after that you I
think<00:01:07.050> it's<00:01:07.440> under<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.890> quest<00:01:08.130> items<00:01:08.520> and

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
think it's under the quest items and

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:09.770 
think it's under the quest items and
after<00:01:08.940> that<00:01:09.060> you<00:01:09.270> want<00:01:09.450> to<00:01:09.509> read<00:01:09.660> the

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
after that you want to read the

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:19.950 
after that you want to read the
interrogation<00:01:10.560> report

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:33.370 

you

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:34.810

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
so once you read that interrogation

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.390 
so once you read that interrogation
report<00:01:35.720> and<00:01:35.960> the<00:01:36.140> notes<00:01:36.380> pretty<00:01:36.950> much<00:01:37.159> it's
