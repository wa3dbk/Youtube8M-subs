conditions<00:00:22.949> I've<00:00:23.160> had<00:00:23.310> some<00:00:23.490> experience<00:00:23.910> with

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970

conditions I've had some experience with
that

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:24.439 
that

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:27.080 
that
however<00:00:25.439> it's<00:00:25.680> affordable<00:00:26.189> I<00:00:26.310> mean<00:00:26.430> the<00:00:26.519> sk5

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
however it's affordable I mean the sk5

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.509 
however it's affordable I mean the sk5
version<00:00:27.539> is<00:00:27.660> running<00:00:28.010> well<00:00:29.010> under<00:00:29.310> a<00:00:29.340> hundred

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
version is running well under a hundred

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.030 
version is running well under a hundred
dollars<00:00:29.670> now<00:00:30.060> and<00:00:30.300> I<00:00:30.750> suppose<00:00:31.170> at<00:00:31.349> that<00:00:31.380> sk5

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
dollars now and I suppose at that sk5

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.110 
dollars now and I suppose at that sk5
steel<00:00:32.369> even<00:00:32.669> though<00:00:32.730> I<00:00:32.790> don't<00:00:32.880> have

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
steel even though I don't have

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.150 
steel even though I don't have
experience<00:00:33.420> with<00:00:33.780> it<00:00:33.840> but<00:00:34.559> I'm<00:00:34.680> thinking<00:00:34.710> it's

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
experience with it but I'm thinking it's

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.290 
experience with it but I'm thinking it's
probably<00:00:35.340> pretty<00:00:35.730> good<00:00:36.860> but<00:00:37.860> this<00:00:38.040> is<00:00:38.190> a

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300 
probably pretty good but this is a

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.670 
probably pretty good but this is a
carbon<00:00:39.300> 5<00:00:39.510> version<00:00:39.960> I've<00:00:40.110> had<00:00:40.379> it<00:00:40.500> for<00:00:40.620> a

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
carbon 5 version I've had it for a

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.410 
carbon 5 version I've had it for a
number<00:00:40.770> of<00:00:40.950> years<00:00:41.190> as<00:00:41.370> you<00:00:41.850> can<00:00:41.969> tell<00:00:42.120> it's<00:00:42.300> had

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
number of years as you can tell it's had

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.090 
number of years as you can tell it's had
a<00:00:42.450> lot<00:00:42.660> of<00:00:42.690> use<00:00:42.899> let's<00:00:43.590> get<00:00:43.770> to<00:00:43.920> it

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
a lot of use let's get to it

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.680 
a lot of use let's get to it
and<00:00:44.250> let<00:00:44.670> me<00:00:44.760> review<00:00:45.030> again<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.360> things<00:00:45.570> I

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.959 
and let me review again the things I
like<00:00:45.870> about<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.230> recon<00:00:46.559> scout<00:00:46.890> it's<00:00:47.879> a

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
like about the recon scout it's a

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.810 
like about the recon scout it's a
quarter<00:00:48.270> inch<00:00:48.420> thick<00:00:48.480> full<00:00:49.469> flat<00:00:49.739> grind<00:00:49.820> by

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
quarter inch thick full flat grind by

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.369 
quarter inch thick full flat grind by
the<00:00:50.879> way<00:00:51.000> that<00:00:51.149> quarter<00:00:51.420> inch<00:00:51.539> thick<00:00:51.719> is<00:00:51.989> huge

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
the way that quarter inch thick is huge

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.889 
the way that quarter inch thick is huge
I<00:00:52.590> know<00:00:53.070> it's<00:00:53.340> heavier<00:00:53.699> but<00:00:54.059> that<00:00:54.270> heft<00:00:54.510> like<00:00:54.780> I

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
I know it's heavier but that heft like I

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.540 
I know it's heavier but that heft like I
showed<00:00:55.079> you<00:00:55.230> on<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.440> strip<00:00:55.680> stripping<00:00:56.309> of<00:00:56.460> the

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
showed you on the strip stripping of the

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.880 
showed you on the strip stripping of the
limbs<00:00:56.730> video<00:00:57.090> really<00:00:58.050> is<00:00:58.170> good<00:00:58.410> weight<00:00:58.590> in<00:00:58.800> a

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
limbs video really is good weight in a

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.580 
limbs video really is good weight in a
lot<00:00:59.070> of<00:00:59.100> situations<00:00:59.340> and<00:01:00.030> then<00:01:00.660> another<00:01:01.379> good

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
lot of situations and then another good

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.770 
lot of situations and then another good
thing<00:01:01.620> about<00:01:01.800> it<00:01:02.190> is<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.609> full<00:01:02.789> flat<00:01:03.000> grind<00:01:03.030> it

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
thing about it is the full flat grind it

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.960 
thing about it is the full flat grind it
basically<00:01:04.140> makes<00:01:04.409> it<00:01:04.559> into<00:01:04.830> a<00:01:04.860> wedge<00:01:05.159> so<00:01:05.880> it

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
basically makes it into a wedge so it

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.940 
basically makes it into a wedge so it
sheers<00:01:06.210> really<00:01:06.510> good<00:01:06.689> again<00:01:07.530> mine<00:01:07.770> has

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
sheers really good again mine has

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.520 
sheers really good again mine has
regrind<00:01:08.880> on<00:01:09.060> it<00:01:09.210> and<00:01:09.330> I've<00:01:09.540> run<00:01:09.780> in<00:01:09.930> about<00:01:10.080> a<00:01:10.110> 20

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
regrind on it and I've run in about a 20

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.609 
regrind on it and I've run in about a 20
degree<00:01:10.890> angle<00:01:11.159> on<00:01:11.880> it<00:01:12.060> as<00:01:12.210> I'm<00:01:12.930> a<00:01:13.080> back<00:01:13.409> that

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
degree angle on it as I'm a back that

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.590 
degree angle on it as I'm a back that
relief<00:01:14.030> cut<00:01:15.030> on<00:01:15.210> it

of doors however that means said it's

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.219 
of doors however that means said it's
not<00:01:44.399> like<00:01:44.640> hugely<00:01:45.210> dull<00:01:45.540> it's<00:01:45.780> just<00:01:45.990> not

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
not like hugely dull it's just not

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.859 
not like hugely dull it's just not
shaving<00:01:46.619> sharp<00:01:46.860> let's<00:01:47.549> get<00:01:47.700> to<00:01:47.850> it<00:01:47.880> and<00:01:50.869> again

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
shaving sharp let's get to it and again

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.690 
shaving sharp let's get to it and again
this<00:01:52.170> is<00:01:52.380> dead<00:01:52.590> wood<00:01:52.799> I<00:01:52.829> could<00:01:53.100> easily<00:01:53.280> push

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
this is dead wood I could easily push

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:04.050 
this is dead wood I could easily push
this<00:01:53.909> over<00:01:54.240> this<00:01:54.659> is<00:01:54.810> just<00:01:55.020> a<00:01:55.110> cutting<00:01:55.380> demo

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.569 

you<00:02:05.060> can<00:02:05.210> see<00:02:05.390> when<00:02:05.570> I<00:02:05.600> cut<00:02:06.189> I'm<00:02:07.189> making

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:07.579 
you can see when I cut I'm making

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:10.900 
you can see when I cut I'm making
notches<00:02:09.009> kind<00:02:10.009> of<00:02:10.099> hard<00:02:10.280> cuz<00:02:10.429> I<00:02:10.489> have<00:02:10.640> a<00:02:10.670> live

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
notches kind of hard cuz I have a live

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:18.820 
notches kind of hard cuz I have a live
tree<00:02:11.150> on<00:02:11.269> this<00:02:11.390> side<00:02:16.150> just<00:02:17.150> like<00:02:17.360> an<00:02:17.510> axe<00:02:17.830> your

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
tree on this side just like an axe your

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:25.089 
tree on this side just like an axe your
survival<00:02:19.340> knife<00:02:19.489> should<00:02:19.970> not<00:02:22.569> that<00:02:23.569> wood<00:02:24.099> and

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:25.099 
survival knife should not that wood and

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:27.910 
survival knife should not that wood and
again<00:02:25.519> the<00:02:25.879> Saab<00:02:26.120> Iver<00:02:26.390> is<00:02:26.750> a<00:02:27.260> much<00:02:27.680> more

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
again the Saab Iver is a much more

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.250 
again the Saab Iver is a much more
efficient<00:02:28.400> way<00:02:28.519> to<00:02:28.549> cut<00:02:28.910> this<00:02:29.090> but<00:02:30.019> I'm

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
efficient way to cut this but I'm

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.650 
efficient way to cut this but I'm
demonstrating<00:02:30.530> that<00:02:31.069> you<00:02:31.190> can<00:02:31.459> do<00:02:31.700> it<00:02:31.849> with<00:02:32.630> a

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
demonstrating that you can do it with a

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:43.089 
demonstrating that you can do it with a
seven-inch<00:02:33.290> blade<00:02:41.049> cutting<00:02:42.049> safety<00:02:42.590> remember

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:43.099 
seven-inch blade cutting safety remember

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:44.860 
seven-inch blade cutting safety remember
if<00:02:43.220> I<00:02:43.310> drop<00:02:43.640> it's<00:02:44.239> going<00:02:44.390> to<00:02:44.450> go<00:02:44.510> through<00:02:44.750> the

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
if I drop it's going to go through the

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.890 
if I drop it's going to go through the
legs<00:02:45.079> never<00:02:45.829> put<00:02:46.099> your<00:02:46.190> arm<00:02:46.400> your<00:02:47.209> hand<00:02:47.480> your

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
legs never put your arm your hand your

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:58.630 
legs never put your arm your hand your
thigh<00:02:48.170> your<00:02:49.010> foot<00:02:49.220> anywhere<00:02:49.670> near<00:02:49.880> your<00:02:50.060> swing

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.630 

now<00:02:59.240> I<00:02:59.300> got<00:02:59.510> to<00:02:59.630> be<00:02:59.690> careful<00:03:00.310> because<00:03:01.310> this

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
now I got to be careful because this

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.660 
now I got to be careful because this
wood<00:03:02.150> wants<00:03:02.570> to<00:03:02.660> tilt<00:03:02.900> this<00:03:03.050> way<00:03:03.280> so<00:03:04.280> as<00:03:04.490> I

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
wood wants to tilt this way so as I

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.210 
wood wants to tilt this way so as I
finish<00:03:05.000> it<00:03:05.150> I'm<00:03:05.300> going<00:03:05.450> to<00:03:05.510> apply<00:03:05.660> pressure

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
finish it I'm going to apply pressure

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.890 
finish it I'm going to apply pressure
that<00:03:07.220> way<00:03:07.460> granted<00:03:07.880> this<00:03:07.970> is<00:03:08.030> a<00:03:08.180> small<00:03:08.510> tree

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
that way granted this is a small tree

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.260 
that way granted this is a small tree
it's<00:03:09.140> not<00:03:09.200> very<00:03:09.440> large<00:03:09.730> but<00:03:10.730> maybe<00:03:10.910> the<00:03:11.120> one

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:11.270 
it's not very large but maybe the one

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:12.750 
it's not very large but maybe the one
that<00:03:11.420> you're<00:03:11.510> going<00:03:11.600> to<00:03:11.660> be<00:03:11.750> falling<00:03:12.020> is<00:03:12.320> not

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
that you're going to be falling is not

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.220 
that you're going to be falling is not
be<00:03:13.760> smart<00:03:14.090> but<00:03:14.390> you<00:03:14.480> know<00:03:14.630> where<00:03:14.780> no<00:03:15.080> where

be smart but you know where no where
it's<00:03:15.320> going<00:03:15.470> to<00:03:15.530> fall<00:03:15.940> apply<00:03:16.940> pressure

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
it's going to fall apply pressure

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.170 
it's going to fall apply pressure
preferably<00:03:17.810> you<00:03:17.930> have<00:03:18.080> someone<00:03:18.350> helping<00:03:18.470> you
