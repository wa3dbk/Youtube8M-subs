00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.690 
around the edges it and you know not so
much<00:02:02.700> it's<00:02:03.149> too<00:02:03.780> bulky<00:02:04.079> it<00:02:04.469> feels<00:02:04.649> like<00:02:04.860> and<00:02:05.159> so

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
much it's too bulky it feels like and so

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.399 
much it's too bulky it feels like and so
that's<00:02:06.210> kind<00:02:06.630> of<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:06.780> reason<00:02:06.869> why<00:02:06.990> i<00:02:07.079> don't

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
that's kind of the reason why i don't

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.850 
that's kind of the reason why i don't
really<00:02:07.649> like<00:02:08.009> it<00:02:08.610> too<00:02:08.729> much<00:02:08.879> but<00:02:09.739> you<00:02:10.739> know

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
really like it too much but you know

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.490 
really like it too much but you know
using<00:02:11.099> the<00:02:11.370> specter<00:02:11.730> actually<00:02:12.660> using<00:02:12.930> any<00:02:13.110> gun

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
using the specter actually using any gun

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.830 
using the specter actually using any gun
if<00:02:13.980> you<00:02:14.190> get<00:02:14.340> used<00:02:14.520> to<00:02:14.610> iron<00:02:14.880> sights<00:02:15.210> you<00:02:15.570> get

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
if you get used to iron sights you get

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.380 
if you get used to iron sights you get
used<00:02:16.020> to<00:02:16.170> them<00:02:16.290> like<00:02:16.770> completely<00:02:17.190> and<00:02:17.580> you

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
used to them like completely and you

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:19.760 
used to them like completely and you
won't<00:02:18.570> need<00:02:18.720> a<00:02:18.780> red<00:02:18.990> dot<00:02:19.200> you<00:02:19.440> want<00:02:19.620> in<00:02:19.740> a

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
won't need a red dot you want in a

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.590 
won't need a red dot you want in a
reflex<00:02:20.160> sight<00:02:20.520> and<00:02:20.790> I<00:02:21.270> think<00:02:21.360> that's

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
reflex sight and I think that's

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:22.640 
reflex sight and I think that's
something<00:02:21.720> that<00:02:21.870> people<00:02:22.140> don't<00:02:22.200> understand

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
something that people don't understand

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.630 
something that people don't understand
is<00:02:23.130> is<00:02:23.730> that<00:02:24.740> that<00:02:25.740> very<00:02:25.950> thing<00:02:26.130> I<00:02:26.250> just<00:02:26.460> said

sites in the law on a lot of guns don't
help<00:02:37.290> you<00:02:37.500> the<00:02:38.250> recoil<00:02:38.730> on<00:02:38.970> each<00:02:39.240> gun<00:02:39.510> is<00:02:39.750> is

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
help you the recoil on each gun is is

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.010 
help you the recoil on each gun is is
made<00:02:41.180> this<00:02:42.180> is<00:02:42.360> going<00:02:42.510> to<00:02:42.570> sound<00:02:42.720> weird<00:02:42.840> but

the<00:02:43.260> recall<00:02:43.709> each<00:02:44.040> gun<00:02:44.370> is<00:02:44.640> set<00:02:45.300> so<00:02:46.140> if<00:02:46.320> you<00:02:46.440> add

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
the recall each gun is set so if you add

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.729 
the recall each gun is set so if you add
a<00:02:46.620> sight<00:02:46.980> you<00:02:47.730> know<00:02:47.880> the<00:02:48.270> way<00:02:48.390> cakes<00:02:48.959> might

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
fuck it up a little bit it might make it

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.130

the Galil to actually be great as it is
and<00:03:02.459> so<00:03:02.760> my<00:03:02.910> tip<00:03:02.970> of<00:03:03.239> the<00:03:03.330> day<00:03:03.360> is<00:03:03.780> to<00:03:04.200> practice

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
and so my tip of the day is to practice

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.880 
and so my tip of the day is to practice
and<00:03:04.920> don't<00:03:05.310> use<00:03:05.989> attachment<00:03:06.989> site<00:03:07.200> just<00:03:07.590> use

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
and don't use attachment site just use

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.890 
and don't use attachment site just use
the<00:03:08.040> iron<00:03:08.190> site<00:03:08.459> because<00:03:09.390> ninety<00:03:09.690> nine

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
the iron site because ninety nine

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.390 
the iron site because ninety nine
percent<00:03:10.050> of<00:03:10.230> the<00:03:10.290> guns<00:03:10.440> out<00:03:10.560> there<00:03:10.590> don't<00:03:11.160> need

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
percent of the guns out there don't need

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.830 
percent of the guns out there don't need
sites<00:03:12.770> and<00:03:13.770> way<00:03:14.040> back<00:03:14.250> to<00:03:14.370> this<00:03:14.459> game<00:03:14.840> the

spectre<00:03:16.170> is<00:03:16.200> great<00:03:16.500> at<00:03:16.709> medium<00:03:17.610> range<00:03:17.850> in<00:03:18.420> in

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
spectre is great at medium range in in

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.750 
spectre is great at medium range in in
everything<00:03:19.290> below<00:03:19.530> that<00:03:19.560> when<00:03:20.340> it<00:03:20.459> gets<00:03:20.580> up

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
everything below that when it gets up

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.990 
everything below that when it gets up
past<00:03:21.239> to<00:03:21.540> the<00:03:21.570> point<00:03:21.870> where<00:03:22.019> you're<00:03:22.110> trying<00:03:22.290> to

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
past to the point where you're trying to

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.310 
past to the point where you're trying to
snipe<00:03:24.000> somebody<00:03:24.420> or<00:03:24.600> shoot<00:03:24.840> them<00:03:24.870> far<00:03:25.230> away

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
snipe somebody or shoot them far away

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.520 
snipe somebody or shoot them far away
it'd<00:03:25.830> be<00:03:26.040> kind<00:03:26.250> of<00:03:26.310> difficult<00:03:27.440> part<00:03:28.440> of<00:03:28.470> the

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
it'd be kind of difficult part of the

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:29.990 
it'd be kind of difficult part of the
reason<00:03:28.799> again<00:03:29.040> is<00:03:29.190> because<00:03:29.310> yet<00:03:29.640> these<00:03:29.730> more

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
reason again is because yet these more

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.729 
reason again is because yet these more
bullets<00:03:30.330> than<00:03:30.390> you<00:03:30.540> really<00:03:30.810> need<00:03:30.840> to<00:03:31.260> kill

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
bullets than you really need to kill

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:33.860 
bullets than you really need to kill
somebody<00:03:32.030> but<00:03:33.030> other<00:03:33.239> than<00:03:33.330> that<00:03:33.540> you<00:03:33.840> know

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
somebody but other than that you know

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.140 
somebody but other than that you know
it's<00:03:34.110> not<00:03:34.320> a<00:03:34.380> bad<00:03:34.590> gun<00:03:34.830> to<00:03:35.070> to<00:03:35.610> use<00:03:35.820> every<00:03:36.120> day

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
it's not a bad gun to to use every day

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.770 
it's not a bad gun to to use every day
you<00:03:37.019> know<00:03:37.049> to<00:03:37.140> sleep<00:03:37.560> with<00:03:37.739> in<00:03:37.890> bed<00:03:38.100> to<00:03:38.780> just
