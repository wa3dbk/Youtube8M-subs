00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:45.000 

where<00:02:41.920> your<00:02:42.159> curve<00:02:42.549> your<00:02:43.540> tip<00:02:43.900> would<00:02:44.290> be<00:02:44.349> like

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
where your curve your tip would be like

okay<00:02:51.490> and<00:02:51.910> then<00:02:52.150> you're<00:02:52.210> going<00:02:52.480> to<00:02:52.540> paint<00:02:52.870> the

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
okay and then you're going to paint the

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.900 
okay and then you're going to paint the
white<00:02:53.700> right<00:02:54.700> over<00:02:55.300> your<00:02:55.720> tip<00:02:56.050> and<00:02:56.350> the<00:02:56.560> tape

white right over your tip and the tape
and<00:02:57.910> this<00:02:58.120> is<00:02:58.270> a<00:02:58.300> lot<00:02:58.569> easier<00:02:58.810> and<00:02:59.260> faster<00:02:59.970> so<00:03:00.970> I

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
and this is a lot easier and faster so I

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.670 
and this is a lot easier and faster so I
like<00:03:01.300> this<00:03:01.510> way<00:03:01.810> a<00:03:01.840> lot<00:03:03.390> and<00:03:04.390> then<00:03:04.630> after<00:03:05.140> wait

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
like this way a lot and then after wait

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:12.480 
like this way a lot and then after wait
a<00:03:05.709> couple<00:03:05.920> seconds<00:03:07.500> and<00:03:08.500> just<00:03:11.100> peel<00:03:12.100> off<00:03:12.370> the

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:12.490 
a couple seconds and just peel off the

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:20.320 
a couple seconds and just peel off the
tape<00:03:12.820> too<00:03:13.450> slow

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:25.950 

that's<00:03:21.330> how<00:03:21.540> it<00:03:21.659> looks

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:25.960 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:30.110 

and<00:03:26.280> the<00:03:27.280> third<00:03:27.610> way<00:03:27.880> that<00:03:28.660> you<00:03:29.020> could<00:03:29.260> use

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
and the third way that you could use

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.700 
and the third way that you could use
different<00:03:31.120> try<00:03:31.330> to<00:03:31.390> cure<00:03:31.660> is<00:03:31.960> by<00:03:32.110> using<00:03:32.290> nail

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:32.710 
different try to cure is by using nail

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:35.640 
different try to cure is by using nail
stencils<00:03:33.340> and<00:03:33.700> they<00:03:34.510> look<00:03:34.690> like<00:03:34.840> this<00:03:35.140> they're

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
stencils and they look like this they're

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.220 
stencils and they look like this they're
just<00:03:35.680> basically<00:03:36.340> stickers<00:03:37.090> that<00:03:37.120> are<00:03:37.420> the

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
just basically stickers that are the

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:44.430 
just basically stickers that are the
curvy<00:03:38.710> shape<00:03:39.600> like<00:03:40.600> that<00:03:40.870> and<00:03:42.930> it's<00:03:43.930> basically

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
curvy shape like that and it's basically

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.300 
curvy shape like that and it's basically
the<00:03:44.560> same<00:03:44.890> way<00:03:45.130> as<00:03:45.430> the<00:03:45.730> tape<00:03:46.090> but<00:03:47.100> this<00:03:48.100> gives

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
the same way as the tape but this gives

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.330 
the same way as the tape but this gives
you<00:03:48.550> a<00:03:48.580> more<00:03:48.880> curvy<00:03:49.630> shape<00:03:49.930> so<00:03:50.890> if<00:03:51.070> you<00:03:51.190> like

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
you a more curvy shape so if you like

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:59.840 
you a more curvy shape so if you like
that<00:03:51.610> more<00:03:51.910> than<00:03:51.940> you<00:03:52.240> can<00:03:52.390> use<00:03:52.540> this<00:03:52.750> way

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:02.550 

and<00:04:00.850> then<00:04:01.390> you're<00:04:01.540> going<00:04:01.690> to<00:04:01.750> paint<00:04:02.020> the<00:04:02.380> white

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
and then you're going to paint the white

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:09.030 
and then you're going to paint the white
over<00:04:02.920> it<00:04:06.750> and<00:04:07.750> what<00:04:07.930> I<00:04:07.960> like<00:04:08.200> about<00:04:08.260> these<00:04:08.680> is

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
over it and what I like about these is

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:14.940 
over it and what I like about these is
that<00:04:09.130> I<00:04:11.250> just<00:04:12.250> reuse<00:04:12.850> them<00:04:13.150> I<00:04:13.410> just<00:04:14.410> peel<00:04:14.920> it

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:14.950 
that I just reuse them I just peel it

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:19.410 
that I just reuse them I just peel it
off<00:04:15.160> stick<00:04:16.860> it<00:04:17.860> back<00:04:17.980> on<00:04:18.190> right<00:04:18.430> here<00:04:18.700> let<00:04:19.150> dry

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:19.420 
off stick it back on right here let dry

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:22.920 
off stick it back on right here let dry
I<00:04:19.900> can<00:04:20.590> use<00:04:20.709> it<00:04:20.739> again<00:04:21.100> so<00:04:21.340> these<00:04:22.120> can<00:04:22.390> last<00:04:22.690> me

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
I can use it again so these can last me

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.780 
I can use it again so these can last me
a<00:04:22.960> really<00:04:23.410> long<00:04:23.530> time<00:04:23.740> you<00:04:24.490> don't<00:04:24.640> have<00:04:24.730> to

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:24.790 
a really long time you don't have to

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:27.090 
a really long time you don't have to
keep<00:04:24.940> buying<00:04:25.270> them<00:04:25.390> over<00:04:25.810> and<00:04:25.870> over<00:04:25.960> again<00:04:26.230> so

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.100 
keep buying them over and over again so
