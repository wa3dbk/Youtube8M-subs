are actually two versions of this case

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.810 
are actually two versions of this case
the<00:00:14.700> ultra<00:00:15.059> fit<00:00:15.269> and<00:00:15.480> the<00:00:15.540> ultra<00:00:15.929> fit<00:00:16.350> s<00:00:16.820> both

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
the ultra fit and the ultra fit s both

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:18.890 
the ultra fit and the ultra fit s both
of<00:00:18.000> them<00:00:18.119> come<00:00:18.300> in<00:00:18.420> three<00:00:18.600> different<00:00:18.630> colors

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
of them come in three different colors

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.040 
of them come in three different colors
there<00:00:19.410> is<00:00:19.500> a<00:00:19.560> black<00:00:19.890> a<00:00:20.189> slate<00:00:21.060> and<00:00:21.330> a<00:00:21.420> white<00:00:21.720> in

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
there is a black a slate and a white in

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.500 
there is a black a slate and a white in
each<00:00:22.500> version<00:00:22.859> and<00:00:23.330> basically<00:00:24.330> the

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
each version and basically the

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.870 
each version and basically the
difference<00:00:24.840> is<00:00:25.019> the<00:00:25.230> S<00:00:25.410> looks<00:00:26.279> more<00:00:26.369> like<00:00:26.580> the

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
difference is the S looks more like the

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.210 
difference is the S looks more like the
tradition<00:00:27.539> of<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.960> iphone<00:00:28.380> 5s<00:00:28.740> back<00:00:28.949> so<00:00:29.189> i

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
tradition of the iphone 5s back so i

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.070 
tradition of the iphone 5s back so i
just<00:00:29.369> pull<00:00:29.550> my<00:00:29.670> iphone<00:00:29.910> 5<00:00:30.150> it<00:00:30.570> has<00:00:30.779> like

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
just pull my iphone 5 it has like

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.470 
just pull my iphone 5 it has like
grooves<00:00:31.470> running<00:00:32.460> along<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:32.969> top<00:00:33.180> and<00:00:33.210> bottom

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
so kind of a distinct separation between

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.119 
so kind of a distinct separation between
