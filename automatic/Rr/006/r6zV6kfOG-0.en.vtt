00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.300
 hello friends my name is Olga 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.370
 ermilova 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.649
 and today I want to give you one more 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.750
 interesting advice within your 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.769
 training which I will be soon 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.360
 spend is called 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.420
 the perfect wedding from idea to realization 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.949
 which is dedicated directly 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:22.529
 creating the wedding itself creating such 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:25.830
 individual weddings are not like 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.599
 all others but in general that task 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.420
 let's say this training help find 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.410
 you your own personality 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.480
 individuality of your agency and 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.850
 bring it to your customers do 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.850
 so that your customers buy better 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.340
 so that your customers fall in love with these 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.829
 weddings that you do and thats probably 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.440
 with this and start because one of 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.460
 such typical problems of the organizers 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.780
 who notice 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.539
 to be honest not only 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.309
 organizers and generally people who 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:57.899
 sell various services 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:59.879
 this inability is colorful and interesting 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.399
 tell you about what you are 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.400
 specifically suggest 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:07.799
 so many of us are so boring 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.080
 generally talk talk so 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.549
 uninteresting that even the nicest 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.869
 product and the best offer 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.900
 just losing 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.970
 generally any sense because here 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.520
 notice when a person communicates and 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.250
 He says it has something burning as well, so well, 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.920
 calm well think well well well 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.590
 here 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:29.500
 We are engaged in weddings when a person has 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:32.250
 his eyes do not burn when he can not 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:35.710
 charge the other and bring it to him 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:40.539
 own idea with emotions with some 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:42.850
 different but maybe so auditory 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:44.680
 moments yes there emotional such 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:48.009
 when something sounds quiet when something 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:50.920
 sounds really loud it kills 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:52.750
 full sale and kills this story 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.520
 which you want to give to these people and 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.539
 even if you are very cool organizers 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.509
 but you can't 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:02:00.640
 to convey to people the meaning of communicating it so 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:03.670
 so that it is absorbed by them is big 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:06.940
 The problem I always call this exercise 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:09.190
 burning eyes try to train 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.950
 tell something to your acquaintances 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:15.519
 to your husband or your friend there is something very 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:17.260
 emotionally but not just just like 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:19.660
 crazy up to some man a 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.790
 trying to get across and trying to do so 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.040
 for a person to see the same picture 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.230
 which you see you imagine that 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.359
 it is a filmstrip which is passed through 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.489
 your head comes in like this 

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:31.260
 get out of here and get into the head 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:34.900
 customer 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:37.380
 try to make it so 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:40.150
 I saw the picture in the same colors that 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:42.459
 which you lay yes just as well 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.470
 how did you figure it out yourself try 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:46.269
 do this learn from it actually 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.670
 very cool and of course for that 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:51.310
 to do this is very important to yourself 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:54.519
 clearly understand what you are offering very 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:57.910
 it's important to love yourself to fall in love with that idea 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:59.829
 which you have and manage then it 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.420
 bring to the client because when us 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:04.270
 something like 8 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.610
 animated and and we are included in us 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:08.860
 any such channels that help 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:11.680
 tells us from other people and if to us 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:14.260
 you yourself are not interested in how you understand 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:17.319
 Well, do not deceive anyone because 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:20.080
 not interesting but not so interesting 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:21.910
 and we are bored talking about it we never 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.470
 in we try to quickly with this matter all 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.780
 finish but then don't be surprised 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:28.060
 why your customers don't buy any 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.069
 your ideas are bad 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.440
 buy you or react to what you 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:33.370
 offer love what you do 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.739
 inform 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.750
 and try to train last minute 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:39.760
 eyes and then you are crazy yourself 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.350
 like no need for this bulge 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.260
 do some such weird stuff 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:46.810
 just then when you really 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.440
 offer what you believe and what 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.989
 love 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:52.120
 Well, it is impossible to say this with some 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:54.750
 with extinct eyes here and good luck to you all 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.750
 until
