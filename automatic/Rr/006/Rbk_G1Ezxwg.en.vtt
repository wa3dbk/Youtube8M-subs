see how well it fares with the ground so

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:41.200 
see how well it fares with the ground so
this<00:00:38.840> is<00:00:39.110> really<00:00:39.980> nervous<00:00:40.190> but<00:00:41.000> we're<00:00:41.120> gonna

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.210 
this is really nervous but we're gonna

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.090 
this is really nervous but we're gonna
do<00:00:41.390> this<00:00:41.510> and<00:00:41.809> see<00:00:42.110> if<00:00:42.320> the<00:00:42.500> screen<00:00:42.800> cracks

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:43.100

do this and see if the screen cracks
enough<00:00:43.399> ready<00:00:44.030> set<00:00:44.989> go

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:53.230 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.139 

this<00:00:54.230> is<00:00:54.350> the<00:00:54.469> first<00:00:54.710> drop<00:00:54.920> right<00:00:55.190> here<00:00:55.250> on

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:56.149 
this is the first drop right here on

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:58.720 
this is the first drop right here on
that<00:00:56.690> so<00:00:56.870> you<00:00:56.930> can<00:00:57.140> see<00:00:57.170> a<00:00:57.559> dent<00:00:58.100> in<00:00:58.280> there<00:00:58.520> and

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:00.860 
as you go across the device and see a

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.770 
as you go across the device and see a
few<00:01:01.070> more<00:01:01.250> dense<00:01:03.640> so<00:01:04.640> you<00:01:04.729> can<00:01:04.850> see<00:01:05.000> the<00:01:05.479> device

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
few more dense so you can see the device

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.730 
few more dense so you can see the device
got<00:01:06.470> scuffed<00:01:07.009> up<00:01:07.250> quite<00:01:07.820> a<00:01:07.850> bit<00:01:08.210> on<00:01:08.390> the<00:01:08.509> bottom

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
got scuffed up quite a bit on the bottom

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.859 
got scuffed up quite a bit on the bottom
but<00:01:09.740> there's<00:01:09.979> no<00:01:10.369> damage<00:01:10.670> to<00:01:10.850> the<00:01:11.270> screen<00:01:11.569> it

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:11.869 
but there's no damage to the screen it

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:13.690 
but there's no damage to the screen it
did<00:01:12.289> get<00:01:12.470> a<00:01:12.500> bunch<00:01:12.800> of<00:01:12.950> scuffs<00:01:13.250> which<00:01:13.459> we'll<00:01:13.610> be

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
did get a bunch of scuffs which we'll be

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.859 
did get a bunch of scuffs which we'll be
showing<00:01:13.910> you<00:01:14.500> in<00:01:15.500> the<00:01:15.679> future<00:01:16.240> but<00:01:17.240> no<00:01:17.450> damage

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
showing you in the future but no damage

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:19.809 
showing you in the future but no damage
is<00:01:18.050> done<00:01:18.200> to<00:01:18.229> the<00:01:18.440> screen<00:01:18.709> everything<00:01:19.610> but<00:01:19.759> the

00:01:19.809 --> 00:01:19.819 
is done to the screen everything but the

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:21.400 
is done to the screen everything but the
corner<00:01:20.090> looks<00:01:20.270> pretty<00:01:20.479> good<00:01:20.660> so<00:01:21.259> the<00:01:21.349> next

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:21.410 
corner looks pretty good so the next

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:23.320 
corner looks pretty good so the next
test<00:01:21.830> we're<00:01:22.220> gonna<00:01:22.310> be<00:01:22.399> doing<00:01:22.670> is<00:01:22.819> dropping<00:01:23.030> it

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
test we're gonna be doing is dropping it

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:40.390 
test we're gonna be doing is dropping it
on<00:01:23.450> its<00:01:23.630> back<00:01:25.179> go

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.400 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.890 

so<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.520> device<00:01:41.820> definitely<00:01:42.450> fared<00:01:42.690> pretty

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:42.900 
so the device definitely fared pretty

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.410 
so the device definitely fared pretty
well<00:01:43.050> with<00:01:43.770> that<00:01:43.800> fall<00:01:44.190> there's<00:01:44.610> a<00:01:44.670> little<00:01:44.910> few

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
well with that fall there's a little few

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.690 
well with that fall there's a little few
scuffs<00:01:45.930> in<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.230> back<00:01:46.410> but<00:01:47.010> there's<00:01:47.190> no<00:01:47.370> damage

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
scuffs in the back but there's no damage

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:48.860 
scuffs in the back but there's no damage
to<00:01:47.730> the<00:01:47.850> screen<00:01:48.150> even<00:01:48.479> though<00:01:48.570> it<00:01:48.660> flipped

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:48.870 
to the screen even though it flipped

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:50.810 
to the screen even though it flipped
onto<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.290> screen<00:01:49.560> so<00:01:50.160> the<00:01:50.190> last<00:01:50.400> test<00:01:50.670> we're

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
onto the screen so the last test we're

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.340 
onto the screen so the last test we're
gonna<00:01:50.940> be<00:01:51.030> doing<00:01:51.300> is<00:01:51.450> dropping<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:52.050> ipod

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
gonna be doing is dropping the ipod

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.920 
gonna be doing is dropping the ipod
touch<00:01:52.670> face-first<00:01:53.670> onto<00:01:54.120> the<00:01:54.450> ground<00:01:54.660> now

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
touch face-first onto the ground now

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.140 
touch face-first onto the ground now
this<00:01:55.110> could<00:01:55.290> be<00:01:55.440> a<00:01:55.680> definite<00:01:56.430> game-changer<00:01:57.030> in

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:57.150 
this could be a definite game-changer in

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:58.730 
this could be a definite game-changer in
the<00:01:57.240> durability<00:01:57.510> of<00:01:57.900> this<00:01:58.170> device<00:01:58.470> so<00:01:58.650> we're

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
the durability of this device so we're

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:04.160 
the durability of this device so we're
gonna<00:01:58.830> be<00:01:58.920> trying<00:01:59.100> that<00:01:59.280> right<00:01:59.610> now<00:02:03.170> from

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
gonna be trying that right now from

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.320 
gonna be trying that right now from
shoulder<00:02:04.590> height<00:02:07.610> so<00:02:08.610> it<00:02:08.880> tilted<00:02:09.240> a<00:02:09.300> little

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
shoulder height so it tilted a little

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.550 
shoulder height so it tilted a little
bit<00:02:09.600> with<00:02:09.690> that<00:02:09.810> we're<00:02:09.989> going<00:02:10.080> to<00:02:10.170> do<00:02:10.229> it<00:02:10.320> one

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
bit with that we're going to do it one

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.590 
bit with that we're going to do it one
more<00:02:10.619> time<00:02:10.770> and<00:02:11.280> see<00:02:11.580> if<00:02:11.910> we<00:02:12.360> can<00:02:12.510> actually

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
more time and see if we can actually

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:19.430 
more time and see if we can actually
break<00:02:12.870> the<00:02:13.050> screen<00:02:17.630> you<00:02:18.630> see<00:02:18.690> the<00:02:18.989> screen<00:02:19.200> is

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
break the screen you see the screen is

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.920 
break the screen you see the screen is
fine<00:02:19.920> there's<00:02:20.520> tons<00:02:20.850> of<00:02:21.030> scuff<00:02:21.239> marks<00:02:21.570> around

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
fine there's tons of scuff marks around

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.020 
fine there's tons of scuff marks around
the<00:02:22.050> device<00:02:22.290> but<00:02:22.920> everything<00:02:23.400> is<00:02:23.489> completely

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
the device but everything is completely

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.990 
the device but everything is completely
operational<00:02:25.310> so<00:02:26.310> here's<00:02:26.489> a<00:02:26.550> quick<00:02:26.790> look<00:02:26.940> at

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
operational so here's a quick look at

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.479 
operational so here's a quick look at
the<00:02:27.330> device<00:02:27.630> after<00:02:28.110> the<00:02:28.620> Falls<00:02:28.860> you<00:02:29.190> can<00:02:29.280> see

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
the device after the Falls you can see

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:31.760 
the device after the Falls you can see
the<00:02:29.970> side<00:02:30.180> is<00:02:30.360> definitely<00:02:30.540> scuffed<00:02:31.200> up<00:02:31.380> a<00:02:31.530> bit

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
the side is definitely scuffed up a bit

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.680 
the side is definitely scuffed up a bit
I<00:02:32.010> definitely<00:02:32.850> this<00:02:32.940> is<00:02:33.000> the<00:02:33.239> first<00:02:33.480> drop

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
I definitely this is the first drop

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.320 
I definitely this is the first drop
right<00:02:33.989> here<00:02:34.410> on<00:02:34.709> that<00:02:34.770> side<00:02:35.670> you<00:02:35.760> can<00:02:35.910> see<00:02:35.940> a

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
right here on that side you can see a

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.990 
right here on that side you can see a
dent<00:02:36.840> in<00:02:37.049> there<00:02:37.290> and<00:02:37.500> as<00:02:38.370> you<00:02:38.489> go<00:02:38.610> across<00:02:38.700> the

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
dent in there and as you go across the

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.150 
dent in there and as you go across the
device<00:02:39.239> and<00:02:39.450> see<00:02:39.600> a<00:02:39.630> few<00:02:39.840> more<00:02:39.989> dense<00:02:40.260> the<00:02:40.980> back

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
device and see a few more dense the back

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.090 
device and see a few more dense the back
is<00:02:41.430> relatively<00:02:42.060> protected<00:02:42.420> by<00:02:43.260> the<00:02:43.320> sides<00:02:43.709> on

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
is relatively protected by the sides on

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.340 
is relatively protected by the sides on
those<00:02:44.250> drops<00:02:44.549> so<00:02:45.330> there's<00:02:45.540> no<00:02:45.660> real<00:02:45.870> damage<00:02:45.989> to

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
those drops so there's no real damage to

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.380 
those drops so there's no real damage to
the<00:02:46.470> back<00:02:46.680> and<00:02:47.010> then<00:02:47.430> the<00:02:47.580> front<00:02:47.610> screen<00:02:48.180> I

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:49.940 
the back and then the front screen I
don't<00:02:48.630> even<00:02:48.750> think<00:02:48.900> it<00:02:49.140> got<00:02:49.230> a<00:02:49.290> scratch<00:02:49.709> I

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
don't even think it got a scratch I

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.590 
don't even think it got a scratch I
tried<00:02:50.190> to<00:02:50.310> drop<00:02:50.489> it<00:02:50.610> multiple<00:02:50.940> times<00:02:51.180> on<00:02:51.480> the

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
no breaking in the screen so this device

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.270 
no breaking in the screen so this device
is<00:02:56.400> very<00:02:56.640> durable<00:02:57.230> it'll<00:02:58.230> just<00:02:58.470> take<00:02:59.010> a<00:02:59.070> few
