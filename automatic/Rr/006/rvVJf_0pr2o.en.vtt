00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
start the weaving okay so we're going to

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.390 
start the weaving okay so we're going to
take<00:02:15.480> the<00:02:15.630> string<00:02:15.840> that<00:02:15.960> what<00:02:16.440> I<00:02:16.470> do<00:02:16.590> is<00:02:16.950> I<00:02:17.130> take

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.270 
go into the next hole across okay now
this<00:02:24.630> is<00:02:24.690> this<00:02:25.170> is<00:02:25.320> where<00:02:25.470> people<00:02:25.740> mess<00:02:25.920> up<00:02:25.950> and

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
this is this is where people mess up and

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.350 
this is this is where people mess up and
this<00:02:26.340> is<00:02:26.490> where<00:02:26.610> you<00:02:26.700> get<00:02:26.820> those<00:02:27.000> really

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
this is where you get those really

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.910

really<00:02:27.570> ugly<00:02:27.750> shooting<00:02:28.200> string<00:02:28.410> jobs<00:02:28.620> that

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
really ugly shooting string jobs that

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.730 
really ugly shooting string jobs that
everyone<00:02:29.220> tries<00:02:29.400> to<00:02:29.430> do<00:02:29.930> instead<00:02:30.930> of<00:02:31.080> putting

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
everyone tries to do instead of putting

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.130 
everyone tries to do instead of putting
it<00:02:31.830> just<00:02:32.460> putting<00:02:32.730> through<00:02:32.910> the<00:02:32.970> hole<00:02:33.150> then

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
it just putting through the hole then

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.920 
it just putting through the hole then
pulling<00:02:34.740> it<00:02:34.920> it<00:02:35.610> needs<00:02:35.940> to<00:02:36.120> be<00:02:36.210> alternating<00:02:36.840> if

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
pulling it it needs to be alternating if

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.790 
pulling it it needs to be alternating if
you're<00:02:37.020> holding<00:02:37.410> it<00:02:38.750> on<00:02:39.750> its<00:02:40.320> side<00:02:40.380> like<00:02:40.560> this

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
you're holding it on its side like this

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.760 
you're holding it on its side like this
it's<00:02:41.640> going<00:02:41.820> to<00:02:41.910> be<00:02:42.260> the<00:02:43.260> string<00:02:43.530> the

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
it's going to be the string the

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.140 
it's going to be the string the
shootings<00:02:44.250> need<00:02:44.370> to<00:02:44.430> be<00:02:44.520> going<00:02:44.820> to<00:02:44.910> the<00:02:45.000> left

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
shootings need to be going to the left

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.250 
shootings need to be going to the left
and<00:02:45.390> to<00:02:45.450> the<00:02:45.510> right<00:02:45.600> of<00:02:45.750> each<00:02:45.870> other<00:02:46.050> every

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
and to the right of each other every

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.810 
and to the right of each other every
single<00:02:46.290> time<00:02:46.650> if<00:02:47.160> you're<00:02:47.310> holding<00:02:47.580> like<00:02:47.640> this

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
single time if you're holding like this

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.780 
single time if you're holding like this
it<00:02:48.570> would<00:02:48.750> be<00:02:48.870> up<00:02:49.050> and<00:02:49.230> down<00:02:49.380> okay<00:02:49.950> so<00:02:50.640> they

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
it would be up and down okay so they

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:56.510 
it would be up and down okay so they
need<00:02:50.970> to<00:02:51.180> weave<00:02:51.660> like<00:02:52.550> this<00:02:54.950> okay<00:02:55.950> don't<00:02:56.430> know

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
need to weave like this okay don't know

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:57.440 
need to weave like this okay don't know
if<00:02:56.610> you'll<00:02:56.730> see<00:02:56.820> what<00:02:57.000> I'm<00:02:57.060> saying<00:02:57.270> in<00:02:57.390> a

over to my left okay I notice how the

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.920 
over to my left okay I notice how the
string<00:03:14.310> starts<00:03:14.550> weaving<00:03:15.240> okay<00:03:15.540> now<00:03:15.720> that's

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
string starts weaving okay now that's

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.350 
string starts weaving okay now that's
that's<00:03:16.230> really<00:03:16.320> all<00:03:16.620> there<00:03:16.650> is<00:03:16.800> to<00:03:17.100> it<00:03:17.130> um<00:03:17.459> in

that's really all there is to it um in
terms<00:03:18.420> of<00:03:18.780> tightness<00:03:19.020> that's<00:03:19.440> going<00:03:19.590> to

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
terms of tightness that's going to

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.130 
terms of tightness that's going to
affect<00:03:19.920> earth<00:03:20.010> or<00:03:20.190> your<00:03:20.790> shot<00:03:21.090> and<00:03:21.420> you're<00:03:21.750> the
