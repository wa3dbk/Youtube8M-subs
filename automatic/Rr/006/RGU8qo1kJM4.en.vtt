Conrad is going to show us this product

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:31.000 
Conrad is going to show us this product
called<00:00:29.870> the<00:00:29.960> eyeball<00:00:30.350> which<00:00:30.590> you<00:00:30.710> can<00:00:30.830> see

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:31.010 
called the eyeball which you can see

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.160 
called the eyeball which you can see
over<00:00:31.130> here<00:00:31.330> now<00:00:32.330> this<00:00:32.510> is<00:00:32.570> some<00:00:32.840> kind<00:00:33.050> of

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:33.170 
over here now this is some kind of

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:34.990 
over here now this is some kind of
microphone<00:00:33.560> screen<00:00:34.100> we've<00:00:34.430> seen<00:00:34.670> lots<00:00:34.850> of

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:35.000 
microphone screen we've seen lots of

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.330 
microphone screen we've seen lots of
different<00:00:35.150> curved<00:00:35.690> screens<00:00:36.170> yes<00:00:36.710> angled

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:37.340 
different curved screens yes angled

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.400 
different curved screens yes angled
screens<00:00:37.760> flat<00:00:38.120> screens<00:00:38.480> this<00:00:39.140> looks<00:00:39.350> very

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 
screens flat screens this looks very

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.710 
screens flat screens this looks very
different<00:00:39.620> so<00:00:40.280> how<00:00:40.460> does<00:00:40.520> this<00:00:40.880> differ<00:00:41.150> in<00:00:41.420> in

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:41.720 
different so how does this differ in in

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.570 
different so how does this differ in in
the<00:00:42.200> way<00:00:42.290> that<00:00:42.440> it<00:00:42.559> works<00:00:42.770> from<00:00:43.070> everything

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:43.580 
the way that it works from everything

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.119 
the way that it works from everything
we've<00:00:43.760> seen<00:00:43.910> before<00:00:44.500> definitely<00:00:45.500> so<00:00:45.739> this<00:00:45.770> is

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:46.129 
we've seen before definitely so this is

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:47.799 
we've seen before definitely so this is
this<00:00:46.340> is<00:00:46.550> of<00:00:46.700> course<00:00:46.910> your<00:00:47.180> standard<00:00:47.390> pop

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:47.809 
this is of course your standard pop

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:50.200 
this is of course your standard pop
screen<00:00:48.200> right<00:00:48.440> here<00:00:48.739> your<00:00:49.340> own<00:00:49.460> custom<00:00:50.090> a

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
screen right here your own custom a

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.590 
screen right here your own custom a
material<00:00:50.750> this<00:00:51.290> is<00:00:51.410> the<00:00:51.530> Noi<00:00:51.739> Minh<00:00:51.950> 103

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:52.600 
material this is the Noi Minh 103

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.270 
material this is the Noi Minh 103
basically<00:00:53.600> this<00:00:53.750> conforms<00:00:54.170> to<00:00:54.470> any<00:00:54.650> large

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
basically this conforms to any large

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.940 
basically this conforms to any large
diaphragm<00:00:55.670> condenser<00:00:55.960> microphones<00:00:56.960> 1.5<00:00:57.680> to

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:57.950 
diaphragm condenser microphones 1.5 to

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:01.030 
diaphragm condenser microphones 1.5 to
2.75<00:00:58.910> inches<00:00:59.240> in<00:00:59.390> diameter<00:00:59.540> you<00:01:00.470> pop<00:01:00.739> it<00:01:00.950> in

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:01.040 
2.75 inches in diameter you pop it in

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.580 
2.75 inches in diameter you pop it in
like<00:01:01.250> so<00:01:01.550> this<00:01:02.420> is<00:01:02.480> the<00:01:02.720> regular<00:01:02.900> shock<00:01:03.350> mount

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:03.590 
like so this is the regular shock mount

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.109 
like so this is the regular shock mount
comes<00:01:03.860> with<00:01:04.009> anointment<00:01:04.400> a<00:01:04.550> little<00:01:04.850> short

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:05.119 
comes with anointment a little short

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:08.139 
comes with anointment a little short
here<00:01:05.330> but<00:01:05.630> the<00:01:05.840> eyeball<00:01:06.560> just<00:01:06.770> sits<00:01:06.979> on<00:01:07.190> it<00:01:07.369> you

00:01:08.139 --> 00:01:08.149 
here but the eyeball just sits on it you

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:10.060 
here but the eyeball just sits on it you
pop<00:01:08.360> the<00:01:08.630> pop<00:01:08.810> filter<00:01:09.050> back<00:01:09.440> on<00:01:09.649> and<00:01:09.950> it

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
pop the pop filter back on and it

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.889 
pop the pop filter back on and it
basically<00:01:10.160> isolates<00:01:10.970> your<00:01:11.119> microphone<00:01:11.660> from

00:01:11.889 --> 00:01:11.899 
basically isolates your microphone from

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:13.630 
basically isolates your microphone from
the<00:01:12.020> external<00:01:12.560> environment<00:01:12.649> so<00:01:13.399> you<00:01:13.490> can

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
the external environment so you can

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.330 
the external environment so you can
professional<00:01:13.820> record<00:01:14.479> anywhere<00:01:14.869> okay<00:01:15.830> so<00:01:15.890> as

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
professional record anywhere okay so as

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.040 
professional record anywhere okay so as
I<00:01:16.490> can<00:01:16.759> see<00:01:17.000> it<00:01:17.119> the<00:01:17.300> way<00:01:17.420> that<00:01:17.450> it<00:01:17.750> differs

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:18.050 
I can see it the way that it differs

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.499 
I can see it the way that it differs
from<00:01:18.080> the<00:01:18.410> competition<00:01:18.950> is<00:01:19.190> that<00:01:19.460> you<00:01:20.180> don't

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:20.509 
from the competition is that you don't

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:21.850 
from the competition is that you don't
need<00:01:20.630> so<00:01:20.780> much<00:01:20.869> screening<00:01:21.350> behind<00:01:21.649> you

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
need so much screening behind you

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.160 
need so much screening behind you
because<00:01:22.220> your<00:01:23.030> head<00:01:23.210> is<00:01:23.360> actually<00:01:23.540> masking

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
because your head is actually masking

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:25.570 
because your head is actually masking
the<00:01:24.320> reflections<00:01:24.830> that<00:01:24.950> would<00:01:25.100> otherwise<00:01:25.340> get

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580 
the reflections that would otherwise get

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.550 
the reflections that would otherwise get
into<00:01:25.850> the<00:01:25.940> front<00:01:26.120> of<00:01:26.240> the<00:01:26.330> mic<00:01:26.510> exactly<00:01:27.350> this

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
into the front of the mic exactly this

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.880 
into the front of the mic exactly this
takes<00:01:27.950> more<00:01:28.130> care<00:01:28.370> of<00:01:28.520> the<00:01:28.640> sides<00:01:28.880> yeah<00:01:29.810> so<00:01:30.140> so

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
takes more care of the sides yeah so so

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.010 
takes more care of the sides yeah so so
in<00:01:31.100> regards<00:01:31.520> to<00:01:31.580> reflections<00:01:32.240> this<00:01:32.510> has<00:01:32.720> to

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
in regards to reflections this has to

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.260 
in regards to reflections this has to
basically<00:01:33.470> dampening<00:01:34.010> quantities<00:01:34.549> one<00:01:35.120> of

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
basically dampening quantities one of

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.210 
basically dampening quantities one of
course<00:01:35.510> is<00:01:35.720> that<00:01:35.750> its<00:01:36.110> encircle<00:01:36.680> the<00:01:36.830> second

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
course is that its encircle the second

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:38.800 
course is that its encircle the second
one<00:01:37.340> is<00:01:37.460> actually<00:01:37.880> channels<00:01:38.299> your<00:01:38.540> sound

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
one is actually channels your sound

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.469 
one is actually channels your sound
directly<00:01:39.380> to<00:01:39.590> the<00:01:39.740> microphone<00:01:40.280> so<00:01:41.060> whatever

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
directly to the microphone so whatever

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:43.359 
directly to the microphone so whatever
is<00:01:41.659> not<00:01:41.840> absorbed<00:01:42.320> by<00:01:42.409> the<00:01:42.470> microphone<00:01:43.070> then

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
is not absorbed by the microphone then

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:45.609 
is not absorbed by the microphone then
is<00:01:43.490> absorbed<00:01:43.909> by<00:01:43.970> the<00:01:44.030> distance<00:01:44.540> traveled<00:01:45.110> for

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619 
is absorbed by the distance traveled for

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:47.289 
is absorbed by the distance traveled for
the<00:01:45.680> small<00:01:45.950> end<00:01:46.159> frequencies<00:01:46.369> or<00:01:46.970> the<00:01:47.090> foam

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.299 
the small end frequencies or the foam

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:50.260 
the small end frequencies or the foam
itself<00:01:47.780> so<00:01:48.020> it's<00:01:48.140> a<00:01:48.260> pure<00:01:48.530> clean<00:01:49.220> that<00:01:49.880> sound

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
itself so it's a pure clean that sound

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.090 
itself so it's a pure clean that sound
okay<00:01:50.720> so<00:01:50.900> what<00:01:51.409> you're<00:01:51.500> saying<00:01:51.740> there<00:01:51.860> is<00:01:51.979> it

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
okay so what you're saying there is it

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.080 
okay so what you're saying there is it
doesn't<00:01:52.280> change<00:01:52.490> the<00:01:52.640> sound<00:01:52.939> of<00:01:53.030> your

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
doesn't change the sound of your

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.149 
doesn't change the sound of your
microphone<00:01:53.600> significantly<00:01:54.290> no<00:01:54.619> not<00:01:54.920> at<00:01:55.070> all

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 
microphone significantly no not at all

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:57.370 
microphone significantly no not at all
because<00:01:55.400> because<00:01:56.330> it's<00:01:56.479> basically<00:01:56.840> channeled

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
because because it's basically channeled

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:58.870 
because because it's basically channeled
within<00:01:57.680> a<00:01:57.770> free<00:01:58.040> field<00:01:58.280> so<00:01:58.549> there's<00:01:58.729> no

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
within a free field so there's no

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.789 
within a free field so there's no
coloration<00:01:59.600> to<00:01:59.630> the<00:01:59.780> sound<00:02:00.080> you<00:02:00.320> stand<00:02:00.590> one

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799 
coloration to the sound you stand one

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:03.670 
coloration to the sound you stand one
two<00:02:00.979> three<00:02:01.220> inches<00:02:01.340> away<00:02:02.229> well<00:02:03.229> it<00:02:03.409> looks<00:02:03.619> like

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
two three inches away well it looks like

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.080 
two three inches away well it looks like
the<00:02:03.979> sort<00:02:04.159> of<00:02:04.220> thing<00:02:04.369> we<00:02:04.460> hope<00:02:04.580> to<00:02:04.700> try<00:02:04.909> out

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
the sort of thing we hope to try out
