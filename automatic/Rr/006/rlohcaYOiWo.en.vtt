00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:16.109
 san marcos chapter 16 verse 17 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:19.470
 and these signs will follow those who believe 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:22.750
 in my name they will cast out demons 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:25.570
 they will speak new languages will take in the 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:28.630
 hands snakes and if they lived thing 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:34.199
 deadly will not harm them 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:34.199
 sick people will put their hands and they will heal 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:44.600
 Matthew chapter 14 verse 34 says what 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:48.199
 next get ready 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:52.100
 and after the crossing they came to 

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:55.579
 land of genesaret when they met him 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:58.219
 the men of that place sent 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:01.820
 news throughout that land 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:05.539
 around and brought to him all the 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:09.229
 sick and begged him to stop them from 

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:16.390
 touch only the edge of his cloak and 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:16.390
 all who touched it were healthy 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:25.030
 these two powerful words speak to me 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:27.460
 of a Jesus who still heals talks to me about 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:30.850
 a powerful god that although many 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:34.000
 religions deny that jesus still heals 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:36.369
 in this 2013 he wants to do something 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.920
 powerful in your life if you are watching 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:41.979

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.750

00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:00.229

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:26.860
 in Matthew 1434 remember he said and begged 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.310
 that stops them from touching only the edge 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:32.310
 of his cloak and all those who touched him 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.310
