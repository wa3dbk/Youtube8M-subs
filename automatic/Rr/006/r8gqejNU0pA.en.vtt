that's<00:02:00.840> a<00:02:00.930> reason<00:02:01.200> we<00:02:01.290> don't<00:02:01.409> expect<00:02:01.740> a

that's a reason we don't expect a
tornado<00:02:02.219> threat<00:02:02.520> there's<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.240> outlook<00:02:03.810> from

chattanooga of course every run is going
to<00:03:40.680> look<00:03:40.830> different<00:03:40.860> on<00:03:41.250> the<00:03:41.370> specifics<00:03:41.970> but<00:03:42.240> I

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
to look different on the specifics but I

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.780 
to look different on the specifics but I
no<00:03:43.260> doubt<00:03:43.410> it<00:03:43.560> will<00:03:43.680> be<00:03:43.710> a<00:03:43.830> much<00:03:44.160> cooler<00:03:44.460> day

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
no doubt it will be a much cooler day

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.030 
no doubt it will be a much cooler day
with<00:03:45.000> highs<00:03:45.150> dropping<00:03:45.630> into<00:03:45.750> the<00:03:45.840> mid<00:03:46.320> 60s<00:03:46.800> and

with highs dropping into the mid 60s and

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.180 
with highs dropping into the mid 60s and
by<00:03:47.160> Wednesday<00:03:47.910> morning<00:03:48.710> we'll<00:03:49.710> just<00:03:49.890> have<00:03:50.040> to

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
by Wednesday morning we'll just have to

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.430 
by Wednesday morning we'll just have to
see<00:03:50.220> now<00:03:50.580> this<00:03:50.820> run<00:03:51.120> does<00:03:51.330> not<00:03:51.510> look<00:03:51.690> as<00:03:51.870> frosty

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
see now this run does not look as frosty

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.550 
see now this run does not look as frosty
as<00:03:52.560> other<00:03:52.800> runs<00:03:53.660> this<00:03:54.660> would<00:03:54.870> suggest<00:03:55.080> the<00:03:55.410> low

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
as other runs this would suggest the low

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.090 
as other runs this would suggest the low
in<00:03:55.680> the<00:03:55.710> upper<00:03:56.100> 30s<00:03:57.050> frost<00:03:58.050> possible<00:03:58.440> but<00:03:59.010> it

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
in the upper 30s frost possible but it

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.820 
in the upper 30s frost possible but it
would<00:03:59.250> not<00:03:59.370> be<00:03:59.550> especially<00:03:59.850> widespread<00:04:00.830> it's

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830 
would not be especially widespread it's

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:03.410 
would not be especially widespread it's
just<00:04:01.980> too<00:04:02.100> early<00:04:02.160> to<00:04:02.490> be<00:04:02.610> specific<00:04:03.150> but<00:04:03.240> just

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
just too early to be specific but just

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:04.940 
just too early to be specific but just
keep<00:04:03.540> in<00:04:03.690> mind<00:04:03.750> that's<00:04:04.080> the<00:04:04.230> old<00:04:04.380> blackberry

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
of next week a week from today hey look

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:27.620 
of next week a week from today hey look
at<00:04:26.669> the<00:04:26.760> shortwave

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
at the shortwave

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.450 
at the shortwave
coming<00:04:27.840> at<00:04:27.960> us<00:04:27.990> and<00:04:28.260> that<00:04:28.380> looks<00:04:28.680> a<00:04:28.920> little<00:04:29.070> wet

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
coming at us and that looks a little wet

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.470 
coming at us and that looks a little wet
and<00:04:29.670> stormy<00:04:30.950> I<00:04:31.950> don't<00:04:32.550> think<00:04:32.610> the<00:04:32.880> instability

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:33.480 
and stormy I don't think the instability

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:34.910 
and stormy I don't think the instability
will<00:04:33.630> be<00:04:33.720> all<00:04:33.870> that<00:04:34.020> great<00:04:34.290> because<00:04:34.470> the<00:04:34.770> air

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:34.920 
will be all that great because the air

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.500 
will be all that great because the air
is<00:04:34.950> going<00:04:35.070> to<00:04:35.160> be<00:04:35.250> pretty<00:04:35.460> cool<00:04:35.700> and<00:04:36.030> if<00:04:36.240> we<00:04:36.450> if

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:36.510 
is going to be pretty cool and if we if

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:38.120 
is going to be pretty cool and if we if
it<00:04:36.630> was<00:04:36.690> unstable<00:04:37.170> that<00:04:37.380> could<00:04:37.650> be<00:04:37.770> a<00:04:37.800> big

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130 
it was unstable that could be a big

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:40.970 
it was unstable that could be a big
severe<00:04:38.640> weather<00:04:38.790> issue<00:04:39.320> but<00:04:40.320> if<00:04:40.440> that<00:04:40.590> happens

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:40.980 
severe weather issue but if that happens

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.500 
severe weather issue but if that happens
to<00:04:41.100> be<00:04:41.220> right<00:04:41.400> it<00:04:41.520> would<00:04:41.640> suggest<00:04:41.850> a<00:04:42.090> chance<00:04:42.270> of

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:42.510 
to be right it would suggest a chance of

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:44.300 
to be right it would suggest a chance of
rain<00:04:42.540> and<00:04:42.720> storms<00:04:43.260> will<00:04:43.800> check<00:04:44.010> the<00:04:44.130> end<00:04:44.250> of
