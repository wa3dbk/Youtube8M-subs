00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:07.440
 very good as you can see have happened 

00:00:03.759 --> 00:00:09.450
 seven days and the evolution is incredible 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.730
 with some temperature conditions and 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.260
 correct humidity the production is 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.350
 being more excellent 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:20.400
 as you can see 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:23.640
 this one here has gotten a little crazy 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.720
 and a crazy growth is going to be the 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:31.500
 first that the cut 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:33.390
 and here 178 are also to cut 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.300
 the diameter can vary a lot I go to 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.590
 prepare the first collection today 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:40.170
 put simple reasons that I want 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.059
 to try them 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.300
 to carry out the collection we are going to 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.940
 follow some very simple steps 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:50.210
 we will avoid direct contact 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:53.560
 we will use the gloves the holder 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:56.840
 what kind whenever they are new 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:58.910
 to avoid contaminating the crop 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.040
 then there is the issue of whether to start the 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.830
 I've cut them off, I've investigated a lot on the internet 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.630
 apparently on a self - cultivation best 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:08.210
 is to start 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.799
 to avoid production foci this 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.899
 differs a lot from what is done in the 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:14.659
 field there are many doubts on whether you 

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:18.140
 better start or cut to legal issues 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:20.289
 I think it's illegal to tear them out if 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.399
 You have to carry a knife and cut them 

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:26.110
 that always before doing anything 

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:26.110
 informed and be very careful 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:32.420
 and well I'm going to catch and I'm going to cut this 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.970
 this used installed this cutex 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.950
 sorry 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.380
 with a lighter I'm going to make a cut 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.200
 down here since there are two others 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.189
 stuck 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.189
 not just a little 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.270
 and so we see this 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:07.780
 it's amazing the size is bigger 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.780
 even that the palm of my hand 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.120
 I think this has left him too 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:13.120
 weather 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:23.659
 from the veins 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.659
 are the spores 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:31.050
 then and it will change the taste of what 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.050
 I have left so long but 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:34.540
 remaining beautiful 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:42.349
 and good now I will remove very carefully 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.349
 the remains so that their brothers grow 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:50.650
 as you can see there are about 89 already great or more 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:54.780
 less fit to eat and still they are 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.780
 starting to leave other little ones 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:04.180
 I will continue collecting and now 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:07.490
 from a while we continue with the video 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:09.520
 good as you can see it's over 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:12.280
 I have started 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:14.440
 this time everything is rooted by removing 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.110
 the remains 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:20.310
 to avoid the position focus 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.310
 here I have the harvest 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:26.170
 As you can see, it's not bad for 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:28.910
 be my first crop 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:31.140
 with the precocity that has been 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:34.170
 I have to say that 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:36.660
 I have been with a controlled humidity 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:39.120
 minimum controlled risks but 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.860
 keeping the humidity that does not have a 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.850
 very high evolution when doing an effect 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.650
 greenhouse 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.280
 the issue that do not give light so 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.930
 direct 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.840
 and with regard to the questions that I 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:53.209
 you did for youtube and for facebook to 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:56.800
 see the first would be the content of the 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:04:00.200
 box is a hummus base 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:01.910
 with two fingers of substrate 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.980
 As for irrigation, what I have already 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:07.150
 commented on other occasions is how much 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:09.340
 the better the less the better 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:12.310
 since a very prolonged irrigation kills 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:15.000
 the little ones and the harvest it looks 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:15.000
 diminished 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:21.980
 and other questions that you asked me and it was 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:23.900
 the self-cultivation from scratch that's something 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:26.510
 quite complicated and that apparently 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:29.240
 has many failures by issues of 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:30.730
 infections and so on so in principle 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:34.360
 what I recommend is that you buy 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:37.479
 seeds or packages 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:39.789
 and try and from then on and every 

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:43.199
 one that is testing what is better than 

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:43.199
 it was what best suits 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:48.350
 and good to remember that you can ask me 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.350
 what you want in this video 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:53.030
 and now I will leave for the comments how 

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:55.690
 they are good they will surely be 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:55.690
 delicious 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:00.850
 remember also that you can share 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:03.310
 this video and in the previous one in the networks 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:05.080
 social that helps growth a lot 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:07.569
 of the Chanel 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:10.409
 do not forget to give me a like and we 

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:10.409
 we see the next video 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:27.580
 yes
