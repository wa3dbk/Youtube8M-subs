ago the cruise the next difference is

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.490 
ago the cruise the next difference is
that<00:00:55.340> this<00:00:56.340> part<00:00:56.579> right<00:00:56.670> here<00:00:56.960> you<00:00:57.960> can't<00:00:58.170> spin

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
that this part right here you can't spin

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.099 
that this part right here you can't spin
it<00:00:58.649> which<00:00:59.039> is<00:00:59.219> really<00:00:59.879> good<00:01:00.149> because<00:01:00.359> in<00:01:00.930> the

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
it which is really good because in the

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.959 
it which is really good because in the
olden<00:01:01.440> Victor<00:01:01.800> I<00:01:01.980> really<00:01:02.309> hate<00:01:02.550> it<00:01:02.699> when<00:01:02.730> it

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
olden Victor I really hate it when it

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.410 
olden Victor I really hate it when it
spins<00:01:03.439> so<00:01:04.439> like<00:01:04.680> this<00:01:05.489> thing<00:01:05.850> would<00:01:06.060> be<00:01:06.210> like

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
spins so like this thing would be like

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.590 
spins so like this thing would be like
right<00:01:06.810> here<00:01:07.439> and<00:01:07.619> this<00:01:07.939> 35<00:01:08.939> will<00:01:09.090> be<00:01:09.210> right

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
right here and this 35 will be right

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.380 
right here and this 35 will be right
here<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:09.930> it<00:01:10.140> like<00:01:11.100> confuses<00:01:11.939> me<00:01:12.090> so<00:01:12.240> like

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
here and it like confuses me so like

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.300 
here and it like confuses me so like
it<00:01:12.570> makes<00:01:12.750> it<00:01:12.869> useless<00:01:13.590> out<00:01:13.890> like<00:01:14.159> I<00:01:14.250> don't

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
it makes it useless out like I don't

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.740 
it makes it useless out like I don't
even<00:01:14.490> know<00:01:14.700> why<00:01:14.880> they<00:01:15.090> have<00:01:15.240> that<00:01:15.479> in<00:01:15.659> the

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
even know why they have that in the

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.660 
even know why they have that in the
first<00:01:15.960> place<00:01:16.110> so<00:01:16.830> at<00:01:16.920> least<00:01:17.009> they<00:01:17.189> removed<00:01:17.580> it

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
first place so at least they removed it

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.550 
first place so at least they removed it
and<00:01:17.909> this<00:01:18.240> one<00:01:18.420> has<00:01:18.570> more<00:01:18.720> numbering<00:01:19.200> than

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
and this one has more numbering than

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.310 
and this one has more numbering than
other<00:01:19.710> one<00:01:19.950> like<00:01:20.100> it<00:01:20.250> just<00:01:20.430> stops<00:01:20.640> at<00:01:20.850> like

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
other one like it just stops at like

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.140 
other one like it just stops at like
well<00:01:22.320> yeah<00:01:22.799> it<00:01:23.009> just<00:01:23.040> stops<00:01:23.400> at<00:01:23.580> like<00:01:23.759> this

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
well yeah it just stops at like this

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.260 
well yeah it just stops at like this
this<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:24.840> then<00:01:24.990> it<00:01:25.229> just<00:01:25.350> stops<00:01:26.030> like<00:01:27.030> it<00:01:27.119> just

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
this and then it just stops like it just

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.960 
this and then it just stops like it just
stops<00:01:27.450> at<00:01:27.600> fifteen<00:01:28.049> and<00:01:28.530> then<00:01:28.710> that<00:01:29.549> very

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
stops at fifteen and then that very

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.749 
stops at fifteen and then that very
difference<00:01:30.299> you<00:01:30.360> can<00:01:30.509> tell<00:01:30.750> is<00:01:30.840> that<00:01:31.460> Wow<00:01:32.460> it's

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
difference you can tell is that Wow it's

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.289 
difference you can tell is that Wow it's
one<00:01:33.210> two<00:01:33.540> three<00:01:33.990> and<00:01:34.799> it<00:01:35.430> just<00:01:35.670> goes<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:36.150> like

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
one two three and it just goes to like

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.219 
one two three and it just goes to like
that<00:01:36.420> maybe<00:01:36.720> it's<00:01:36.960> like<00:01:38.689> second<00:01:39.689> counting<00:01:40.110> or

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
that maybe it's like second counting or

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.690 
that maybe it's like second counting or
something<00:01:40.590> so<00:01:40.740> that's<00:01:41.009> another<00:01:41.250> difference

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
something so that's another difference

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.389 
something so that's another difference
you<00:01:41.790> can<00:01:41.939> tell<00:01:43.640> right<00:01:44.640> here<00:01:44.820> from<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.180> old<00:01:45.270> one

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399 
you can tell right here from the old one

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:48.590 
you can tell right here from the old one
there's<00:01:47.399> less<00:01:47.670> of<00:01:47.700> a<00:01:48.000> grip<00:01:48.329> right<00:01:48.570> here

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
there's less of a grip right here

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.330 
there's less of a grip right here
because<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:48.990> old<00:01:49.170> one<00:01:49.380> it's<00:01:49.590> like<00:01:49.770> part<00:01:50.189> of

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
because the old one it's like part of

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.149 
because the old one it's like part of
that<00:01:50.640> like<00:01:50.820> this<00:01:51.060> string<00:01:51.630> this<00:01:52.009> part<00:01:53.009> here

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
that like this string this part here

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.270 
that like this string this part here
it's<00:01:53.310> part<00:01:53.759> of<00:01:53.909> like<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:55.290> watch<00:01:55.500> itself<00:01:55.950> like

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
it's part of like the watch itself like

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.370 
it's part of like the watch itself like
it's<00:01:56.460> connected<00:01:56.670> but<00:01:57.540> this<00:01:57.719> one<00:01:57.899> is<00:01:58.049> just<00:01:58.229> like

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
it's connected but this one is just like

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.499 
it's connected but this one is just like
connected<00:01:58.920> by<00:01:59.070> like<00:01:59.280> a<00:01:59.310> little<00:01:59.670> by<00:02:00.299> like<00:02:00.479> a

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
connected by like a little by like a

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.389 
connected by like a little by like a
screw<00:02:00.930> everything<00:02:01.079> right<00:02:01.409> here<00:02:01.590> so<00:02:02.219> that's

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
screw everything right here so that's

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.730 
screw everything right here so that's
not<00:02:02.579> a<00:02:02.640> difference<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:03.750> this<00:02:04.170> is<00:02:04.229> different

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
not a difference and this is different

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:10.520 
not a difference and this is different
