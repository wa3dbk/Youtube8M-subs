of<00:01:22.110> mine<00:01:22.350> there<00:01:22.740> I'm<00:01:23.189> not<00:01:23.520> sure<00:01:23.580> what<00:01:24.090> that<00:01:24.119> is

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
of mine there I'm not sure what that is

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.719 
of mine there I'm not sure what that is
but<00:01:24.810> yeah<00:01:25.470> not<00:01:25.860> a<00:01:25.920> massive<00:01:26.310> fan<00:01:26.460> of<00:01:26.490> that

otherwise<00:01:27.119> I<00:01:27.180> do<00:01:27.420> you<00:01:27.479> think<00:01:27.659> it<00:01:27.750> looks<00:01:27.900> very

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140
