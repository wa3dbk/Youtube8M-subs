things some harder things and I'll show
you<00:00:24.830> a<00:00:24.980> couple<00:00:25.369> of<00:00:25.579> ways<00:00:25.730> to<00:00:25.880> apply<00:00:26.060> them<00:00:26.560> but

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:27.560 
you a couple of ways to apply them but

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.669 
you a couple of ways to apply them but
getting<00:00:27.920> started<00:00:29.199> free<00:00:30.199> to<00:00:30.289> those<00:00:30.470> of<00:00:30.650> you

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:30.679 
getting started free to those of you

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:33.310 
getting started free to those of you
that<00:00:30.980> don't<00:00:31.429> know<00:00:31.550> there<00:00:31.699> are<00:00:32.540> inverters<00:00:33.290> and

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:33.320 
that don't know there are inverters and

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.470 
that don't know there are inverters and
minecraft<00:00:34.220> which<00:00:34.460> allow<00:00:34.730> you<00:00:34.790> to<00:00:34.970> switch<00:00:35.210> a

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:35.480 
minecraft which allow you to switch a

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.619 
minecraft which allow you to switch a
current<00:00:35.780> from<00:00:35.930> off<00:00:36.140> to<00:00:36.170> on<00:00:36.410> and<00:00:37.150> as<00:00:38.150> you<00:00:38.480> can

00:00:38.619 --> 00:00:38.629 
current from off to on and as you can

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:41.680 
current from off to on and as you can
tell<00:00:38.660> this<00:00:39.140> current<00:00:39.530> is<00:00:39.800> in<00:00:40.220> the<00:00:40.400> off<00:00:40.690> position

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:41.690 
tell this current is in the off position

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.549 
tell this current is in the off position
and<00:00:42.610> this<00:00:43.610> current<00:00:43.790> over<00:00:44.120> here<00:00:44.299> is<00:00:44.479> on<00:00:44.659> because

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:45.559 
and this current over here is on because

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:48.969 
and this current over here is on because
of<00:00:45.589> the<00:00:45.769> torch<00:00:46.030> but<00:00:47.030> we<00:00:47.299> can<00:00:47.510> reverse<00:00:47.780> this<00:00:48.080> by

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:48.979 
of the torch but we can reverse this by

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:50.680 
of the torch but we can reverse this by
pushing<00:00:49.369> this<00:00:49.640> button<00:00:49.699> and<00:00:50.030> sending<00:00:50.600> a

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
pushing this button and sending a

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.560 
pushing this button and sending a
current<00:00:50.930> to<00:00:51.229> this<00:00:51.440> redstone<00:00:52.059> which<00:00:53.059> will<00:00:53.330> then

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:53.570 
current to this redstone which will then

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.450 
current to this redstone which will then
in<00:00:53.839> turn<00:00:53.869> turn<00:00:54.470> this<00:00:54.650> torch<00:00:54.920> off<00:00:55.159> and

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
in turn turn this torch off and

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.719 
in turn turn this torch off and
unpowered<00:00:56.150> this<00:00:56.449> bed<00:00:56.989> soon<00:00:57.260> so<00:00:58.129> let's<00:00:58.369> show

00:00:58.719 --> 00:00:58.729 
unpowered this bed soon so let's show

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:02.380 
unpowered this bed soon so let's show
you<00:00:58.760> that<00:00:59.530> goes<00:01:00.530> off<00:01:00.739> for<00:01:00.920> a<00:01:00.979> second<00:01:01.390> comes

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
you that goes off for a second comes

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.469 
you that goes off for a second comes
back<00:01:02.600> on<00:01:02.809> and<00:01:03.309> the<00:01:04.309> way<00:01:04.460> that<00:01:04.760> this<00:01:05.150> can<00:01:05.360> be

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:05.479 
back on and the way that this can be

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:07.750 
back on and the way that this can be
used<00:01:05.720> is<00:01:06.080> for<00:01:06.409> an<00:01:06.530> indicator<00:01:07.040> light<00:01:07.340> or

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:07.760 
used is for an indicator light or

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.179 
used is for an indicator light or
anything<00:01:08.540> like<00:01:08.570> that<00:01:08.720> let<00:01:09.350> me<00:01:09.860> go<00:01:10.040> ahead<00:01:10.100> and

00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:10.189 
anything like that let me go ahead and

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:11.609 
anything like that let me go ahead and
show<00:01:10.310> you<00:01:10.430> how<00:01:10.549> that<00:01:10.909> would<00:01:11.060> work<00:01:11.090> just

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:11.619 
show you how that would work just

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:14.709 
show you how that would work just
destroy<00:01:12.619> some<00:01:12.770> of<00:01:12.799> this<00:01:12.890> redstone<00:01:13.159> and<00:01:13.570> if<00:01:14.570> I

00:01:14.709 --> 00:01:14.719 
destroy some of this redstone and if I

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:16.569 
destroy some of this redstone and if I
slap<00:01:14.960> another<00:01:15.229> torch<00:01:15.590> over<00:01:15.710> here<00:01:16.100> see<00:01:16.460> it's

00:01:16.569 --> 00:01:16.579 
slap another torch over here see it's

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:19.899 
slap another torch over here see it's
off<00:01:16.759> because<00:01:17.420> this<00:01:17.659> turns<00:01:17.960> off<00:01:18.490> but<00:01:19.490> then<00:01:19.670> when

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:19.909 
off because this turns off but then when

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:21.580 
off because this turns off but then when
I<00:01:19.939> push<00:01:20.270> the<00:01:20.450> button<00:01:20.719> to<00:01:20.869> apply<00:01:20.990> the<00:01:21.170> current

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
I push the button to apply the current

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.789 
I push the button to apply the current
the<00:01:22.070> torch<00:01:22.310> comes<00:01:22.520> on<00:01:22.780> so<00:01:23.780> that<00:01:23.929> can<00:01:24.140> be<00:01:24.170> used

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:24.799 
the torch comes on so that can be used

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:26.950 
the torch comes on so that can be used
as<00:01:25.009> a<00:01:25.039> feedback<00:01:25.549> for<00:01:25.909> testing<00:01:26.329> currents<00:01:26.840> and

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
as a feedback for testing currents and

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.149 
as a feedback for testing currents and
whatnot<00:01:27.759> now<00:01:28.840> one<00:01:29.840> thing<00:01:29.869> that<00:01:30.109> I<00:01:30.380> used<00:01:30.649> in<00:01:30.950> the

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:31.159 
whatnot now one thing that I used in the

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:33.399 
whatnot now one thing that I used in the
station<00:01:32.060> is<00:01:32.270> something<00:01:32.929> entirely<00:01:33.200> different

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
station is something entirely different

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:36.880 
station is something entirely different
but<00:01:34.100> important<00:01:34.820> nonetheless<00:01:35.060> is<00:01:35.649> the<00:01:36.649> ability

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
but important nonetheless is the ability

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.749 
but important nonetheless is the ability
to<00:01:37.670> slow<00:01:38.270> down<00:01:38.450> currents<00:01:39.020> by<00:01:39.560> using<00:01:40.219> repeaters

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:40.759 
to slow down currents by using repeaters

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:47.260 
to slow down currents by using repeaters
and<00:01:40.909> what<00:01:41.630> repeaters<00:01:42.079> do<00:01:42.289> are<00:01:43.030> they<00:01:45.670> delay<00:01:46.670> the

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
and what repeaters do are they delay the

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:54.279 
and what repeaters do are they delay the
current<00:01:47.749> a<00:01:47.929> certain<00:01:48.590> way<00:01:48.770> so<00:01:49.479> that<00:01:53.289> it's

00:01:54.279 --> 00:01:54.289 
current a certain way so that it's

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:58.330 
current a certain way so that it's
easily<00:01:54.590> manipulated<00:01:56.649> it<00:01:57.649> changes<00:01:58.100> the<00:01:58.249> amount

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
easily manipulated it changes the amount

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.419 
easily manipulated it changes the amount
of<00:01:58.490> time<00:01:58.729> that<00:01:58.759> it<00:01:59.149> takes<00:01:59.240> from<00:01:59.929> one<00:02:00.530> block<00:02:01.100> to

00:02:01.419 --> 00:02:01.429 
of time that it takes from one block to

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:08.230 
of time that it takes from one block to
another<00:02:02.889> so<00:02:03.889> torch<00:02:04.639> is<00:02:04.819> on<00:02:04.969> and<00:02:07.149> schedule<00:02:08.149> a

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:08.240 
another so torch is on and schedule a

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.600 
another so torch is on and schedule a
control<00:02:08.899> just<00:02:09.709> to<00:02:09.800> show<00:02:09.950> you<00:02:09.979> how<00:02:10.069> fast<00:02:10.369> would

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
control just to show you how fast would

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:19.740 
control just to show you how fast would
you

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.000 

alright<00:02:20.490> put<00:02:21.490> a<00:02:21.520> button<00:02:21.730> on<00:02:21.850> this<00:02:22.950> all<00:02:23.950> right

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
alright put a button on this all right

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.680 
alright put a button on this all right
so<00:02:24.280> that's<00:02:24.760> how<00:02:24.970> fast<00:02:25.240> that<00:02:25.420> would<00:02:25.570> normally

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
so that's how fast that would normally

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.940 
so that's how fast that would normally
go<00:02:27.060> and<00:02:28.060> now<00:02:28.240> if<00:02:28.540> we<00:02:28.840> change<00:02:29.230> the<00:02:29.410> time<00:02:29.440> on

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
go and now if we change the time on

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.260 
go and now if we change the time on
these<00:02:30.430> repeaters<00:02:30.820> to<00:02:31.120> go<00:02:31.240> slow<00:02:31.510> and<00:02:32.250> I<00:02:33.270> that's

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
these repeaters to go slow and I that's

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.370 
these repeaters to go slow and I that's
normal<00:02:35.080> speed<00:02:35.290> right<00:02:35.620> there<00:02:36.720> delayed<00:02:37.720> delayed

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
normal speed right there delayed delayed

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.890 
normal speed right there delayed delayed
more<00:02:38.620> and<00:02:38.920> then<00:02:39.040> delayed<00:02:39.340> most<00:02:39.870> so<00:02:41.160> once<00:02:42.160> again

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
more and then delayed most so once again

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.970 
more and then delayed most so once again
normal<00:02:43.900> speed<00:02:44.110> for<00:02:44.260> the<00:02:44.320> current<00:02:44.470> to<00:02:44.620> travel

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
normal speed for the current to travel

and then delayed with four repeaters as

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:51.860

you<00:02:49.750> can<00:02:49.870> see<00:02:50.050> it<00:02:50.170> traveled<00:02:50.500> very<00:02:50.620> slowly<00:02:50.950> and

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
you can see it traveled very slowly and

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.900 
you can see it traveled very slowly and
ways<00:02:52.870> that<00:02:53.080> this<00:02:53.200> can<00:02:53.380> be<00:02:53.500> applied<00:02:53.709> well<00:02:54.700> there

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
ways that this can be applied well there

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.280 
ways that this can be applied well there
are<00:02:55.000> a<00:02:55.030> lot<00:02:55.209> of<00:02:55.239> them<00:02:55.830> in<00:02:56.830> the<00:02:57.580> mine<00:02:58.150> card<00:02:58.450> train

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
thing that I made I used it to delay how

another demonstration of it being
delayed<00:03:15.989> you<00:03:16.989> can<00:03:17.200> use<00:03:17.410> it<00:03:17.590> to<00:03:17.860> apply<00:03:18.370> current

time something or if you just need like

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.680 
time something or if you just need like
an<00:04:12.340> additional<00:04:12.820> couple<00:04:13.090> seconds<00:04:13.480> of<00:04:13.600> a

than<00:04:15.640> just<00:04:15.880> a<00:04:15.940> button<00:04:17.160> so<00:04:18.160> you<00:04:18.400> can<00:04:18.790> use<00:04:18.940> that

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 
than just a button so you can use that

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.820 
than just a button so you can use that
like<00:04:19.540> I<00:04:19.660> said<00:04:19.720> just<00:04:20.200> to<00:04:20.380> continue<00:04:20.890> on<00:04:21.190> currents

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
like I said just to continue on currents

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.340 
like I said just to continue on currents
over<00:04:23.830> here<00:04:24.160> is<00:04:24.419> what<00:04:25.419> i<00:04:25.450> call<00:04:25.690> a<00:04:25.750> charged<00:04:26.169> cell

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.350 
over here is what i call a charged cell

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:29.670 
over here is what i call a charged cell
if<00:04:26.800> you<00:04:27.520> need<00:04:27.550> one<00:04:28.030> single<00:04:28.660> input<00:04:28.870> to<00:04:29.380> charge

something<00:04:29.950> continuously<00:04:30.700> but<00:04:31.240> you<00:04:31.360> don't

00:04:31.589 --> 00:04:31.599 
something continuously but you don't

00:04:31.599 --> 00:04:32.390 
something continuously but you don't

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
want it to be 11

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.690 
want it to be 11
you<00:04:33.400> can<00:04:33.670> push<00:04:33.970> the<00:04:34.120> button<00:04:34.420> and<00:04:34.650> then<00:04:35.650> each<00:04:36.430> of

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:36.700 
you can push the button and then each of

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.600 
you can push the button and then each of
the<00:04:37.300> repeaters<00:04:37.780> power<00:04:38.200> itself<00:04:38.650> so<00:04:39.580> it

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 
the repeaters power itself so it

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:42.300 
the repeaters power itself so it
continually<00:04:40.350> powers<00:04:41.350> the<00:04:41.620> next<00:04:41.890> repeater<00:04:42.190> and

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
continually powers the next repeater and

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.790 
continually powers the next repeater and
flows<00:04:42.700> out<00:04:42.880> the<00:04:43.000> current<00:04:43.150> and<00:04:43.470> it<00:04:44.470> keeps<00:04:44.650> the

numbers<00:05:06.540> but<00:05:07.540> it<00:05:07.690> has<00:05:07.840> to<00:05:07.870> be<00:05:08.050> greater<00:05:08.230> than

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:08.590 
numbers but it has to be greater than

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.430 
numbers but it has to be greater than
three<00:05:09.240> if<00:05:10.240> it's<00:05:10.450> set<00:05:10.600> up<00:05:10.630> with<00:05:10.870> three<00:05:11.140> it'll

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:11.440 
three if it's set up with three it'll

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:16.200 
three if it's set up with three it'll
just<00:05:11.650> burn<00:05:11.800> out<00:05:14.010> but<00:05:15.010> this<00:05:15.370> can<00:05:15.610> be<00:05:15.700> used<00:05:15.910> as

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:16.210 
just burn out but this can be used as

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:19.140 
just burn out but this can be used as
you<00:05:16.510> saw<00:05:16.720> to<00:05:17.200> create<00:05:17.800> the<00:05:17.950> flashing<00:05:18.280> light<00:05:18.460> now

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:19.150 
you saw to create the flashing light now

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:21.270 
you saw to create the flashing light now
it's<00:05:19.600> solid<00:05:20.050> right<00:05:20.200> now<00:05:20.350> because<00:05:20.950> the

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:21.280 
it's solid right now because the

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.760 
it's solid right now because the
currents<00:05:21.610> no<00:05:21.700> long<00:05:21.880> you're<00:05:22.090> switching<00:05:22.770> but

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:23.770 
currents no long you're switching but

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:27.180 
currents no long you're switching but
what<00:05:24.370> happens<00:05:24.880> is<00:05:25.200> this<00:05:26.200> current<00:05:26.530> is<00:05:26.770> off

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:27.190 
what happens is this current is off

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:29.430 
what happens is this current is off
which<00:05:27.850> goes<00:05:28.030> into<00:05:28.060> here<00:05:28.420> the<00:05:28.600> inverter<00:05:28.900> so

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:29.440 
which goes into here the inverter so

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:32.100 
which goes into here the inverter so
this<00:05:29.590> one's<00:05:29.770> on<00:05:30.090> one<00:05:31.090> current<00:05:31.510> goes<00:05:31.720> into<00:05:31.930> here

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:32.110 
this one's on one current goes into here

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:39.540 
this one's on one current goes into here
inverter<00:05:32.500> off<00:05:32.740> off<00:05:33.300> on<00:05:34.980> on<00:05:35.980> off<00:05:36.570> off<00:05:38.010> and<00:05:39.010> then

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:39.550 
inverter off off on on off off and then

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:42.300 
inverter off off on on off off and then
when<00:05:39.790> I<00:05:39.820> put<00:05:40.150> this<00:05:40.270> on<00:05:40.950> it's<00:05:41.950> going<00:05:42.190> to<00:05:42.250> change

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:42.310 
when I put this on it's going to change

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:45.510 
when I put this on it's going to change
this<00:05:42.760> off<00:05:42.970> current<00:05:43.270> to<00:05:44.050> a<00:05:44.380> non<00:05:44.650> current<00:05:44.980> and<00:05:45.280> so

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:45.520 
this off current to a non current and so

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:46.950 
this off current to a non current and so
on<00:05:45.700> it's<00:05:45.910> going<00:05:46.150> to<00:05:46.210> flip<00:05:46.420> all<00:05:46.540> the<00:05:46.660> currents

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:46.960 
on it's going to flip all the currents

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:50.460 
on it's going to flip all the currents
and<00:05:47.250> it'll<00:05:48.250> do<00:05:48.370> that<00:05:48.550> continually<00:05:49.180> and<00:05:49.470> just

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:50.470 
and it'll do that continually and just

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:53.160 
and it'll do that continually and just
continue<00:05:50.890> to<00:05:50.920> flash<00:05:51.280> the<00:05:51.460> way<00:05:51.580> outside<00:05:52.170> now

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:53.170 
continue to flash the way outside now

00:05:53.170 --> 00:06:00.860 
continue to flash the way outside now
this<00:05:53.680> can<00:05:53.920> be<00:05:53.950> used<00:05:54.370> to<00:05:58.710> switch<00:05:59.710> tracks<00:06:00.130> too<00:06:00.400> if

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:00.870 
this can be used to switch tracks too if

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:03.450 
this can be used to switch tracks too if
you<00:06:01.870> want<00:06:02.020> to<00:06:02.110> continually<00:06:02.500> switch<00:06:02.830> a<00:06:02.920> track<00:06:03.190> I

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:03.460 
you want to continually switch a track I

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:06.120 
you want to continually switch a track I
don't<00:06:03.970> know<00:06:04.030> why<00:06:04.090> put<00:06:04.270> the<00:06:04.330> red<00:06:04.450> send<00:06:04.690> out<00:06:05.130> if

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:06.130 
don't know why put the red send out if

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:08.370 
don't know why put the red send out if
you<00:06:06.400> need<00:06:06.550> to<00:06:06.700> continually<00:06:07.120> switch<00:06:07.990> a<00:06:08.080> track

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:08.380 
you need to continually switch a track

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:12.630 
you need to continually switch a track
or<00:06:08.680> I<00:06:09.780> will<00:06:10.780> show<00:06:11.050> a<00:06:11.080> video<00:06:11.350> of<00:06:11.800> another

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:12.640 
or I will show a video of another

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:15.150 
or I will show a video of another
application<00:06:13.060> later<00:06:13.390> but<00:06:13.840> it<00:06:14.800> doesn't<00:06:15.040> really

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:15.160 
application later but it doesn't really

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:18.420 
application later but it doesn't really
have<00:06:15.280> a<00:06:15.310> use<00:06:15.400> but<00:06:15.790> it's<00:06:15.940> a<00:06:16.000> flashing<00:06:16.480> floor<00:06:17.430> you

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:18.430 
have a use but it's a flashing floor you

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:21.600 
have a use but it's a flashing floor you
need<00:06:18.580> one<00:06:18.730> of<00:06:18.760> those<00:06:19.260> but<00:06:20.260> if<00:06:20.680> you<00:06:21.070> had<00:06:21.400> any

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:21.610 
need one of those but if you had any

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:25.620 
need one of those but if you had any
questions<00:06:21.850> of<00:06:22.450> what<00:06:23.350> went<00:06:23.530> on<00:06:23.650> today<00:06:23.680> or<00:06:24.630> how

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:25.630 
questions of what went on today or how

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:28.650 
questions of what went on today or how
things<00:06:25.960> could<00:06:26.170> be<00:06:26.230> used<00:06:26.950> or<00:06:27.400> what<00:06:28.270> you<00:06:28.360> want<00:06:28.540> me

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:28.660 
things could be used or what you want me

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:31.110 
things could be used or what you want me
to<00:06:28.780> display<00:06:29.140> in<00:06:29.260> my<00:06:29.350> next<00:06:29.530> video<00:06:29.830> I<00:06:30.130> just<00:06:31.000> need

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:31.120 
to display in my next video I just need

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:34.170 
to display in my next video I just need
to<00:06:31.210> comment<00:06:31.420> send<00:06:31.930> us<00:06:32.080> a<00:06:32.140> message<00:06:33.030> just<00:06:34.030> give

to comment send us a message just give

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:38.280 
to comment send us a message just give
us<00:06:34.270> some<00:06:34.300> feedback<00:06:34.450> really<00:06:36.660> but<00:06:37.660> that's<00:06:38.050> it
