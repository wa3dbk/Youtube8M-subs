 two spider-man is that I love you 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.040
 present this time that you could 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:39.899

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:41.370
 of my hunts well I have I want 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.780
 introduce you this coming spider-man 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:48.030
 here of the series of 2009 is a 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.790
 spider-man that has a version with the 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.160
 classic suit in 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:55.410
 red with blue but hey this is the 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.200
 black version is a pretty space 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:01.410
 quite well achieved very good figures 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:05.220
 more I would dare say that after 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:07.680
 from spider-man that you see here from network hold 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.360
 this figure is very good the only thing that 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.720
 missing a little height but good not 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.570
 nothing happens is a very excellent figure 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:17.340
 in it in its black version I know 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.140
 that the figure does not have the great 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.880
 articulation but the work of 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.550
 sculpted is quite pretty good 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.220
 As you can see here, look, let's go 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.940
 measure the figure 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:31.970
 the well-erect figure measures a little more 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:34.280
 of 14 centimeters and good your head 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.020
 can rotate 360 can be done towards 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.090
 down up a little bit us well 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.730
 returns to your place you can also 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:43.040
 do sideways he sculpted is 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:44.870
 quite well managed to know then a 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:48.300
 image of the black suit pretty well 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:51.300
 made the shoulder can rotate 360 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:53.580
 and it can also be limited 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.710
 up do not have any 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.330
 articulation in the biceps has a point 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.970
 of articulation in the elbow but it is 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:02.460
 you can rotate to 360 and you do not have any 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:05.430
 articulation in what is your wrist or your 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:08.340
 hand and nothing else comes with the fingers 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:11.610
 facts as if spun web now 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:14.370
 remember that this side suit spider 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:17.160
 it comes out on the top then 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:20.580
 Well, nothing happens, this is not the 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:23.340
 spider-man costume without being symbiote 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:26.250
 like who says good his torso can 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:29.040
 turn 360 you can be down and your 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.510
 place you can be afraid the sides will 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.480
 can open completely legs 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.610
 he has 360 in which his thigh has nothing 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.310
 plus a point of articulation in what 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.950
 They are your knees and your foot can turn 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.020
 360 and has no articulation in 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.970
 what their calves because of 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:48.240
 joints I think is the worst 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:50.310
 figure but they have sculpted the truth to me 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.050
 I liked it a lot, it's a very good 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.720
 figure 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:56.670
 I do know, I recommend them because, besides, 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.100
 it's very expensive, it's not expensive to get the 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.530
 they get it then I think that pretty 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:04.350
 economic should not exceed 200 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:06.120
 good pesos 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.820
 and there is high figure that I love you 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:12.630
 present then is the spider-man the 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:15.690
 version of the orient series in this 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:18.450
 mold because I have really improved the 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:20.940
 spiderman classic this spider-man good 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:23.360
 with his first release come out with 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:27.080
 a step 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:29.690
 it is with an accessory that can 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:31.940
 make fly and good strong and sexual and the 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.260
 truth is that I 'm not interested in what 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:37.010
 myth is the figure that is pretty good 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:39.710
 made up the touch of this his suit does not 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:41.510
 is blank is in a pretty silver 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:43.730
 low that almost looks white but it's 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:48.050
 silver color what makes it a figure 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:50.780
 different and there is another version already with the 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:55.490
 touch totally blank not good 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:58.520
 we can see the figure well erect 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:01.130
 look a little more of the 14 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:04.070
 centimeters is not a very figure 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:07.430
 high but it is very well made good 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:09.740
 we have this joint in your shoulders 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:12.260
 butterfly that allows you to expand 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:14.390
 more without making any kind of hole 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:17.360
 see in the back see how it 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:19.820
 he sees pretty well his head turns 

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:23.120
 360 and it can be done down towards 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:24.950
 top thing that improved contact against 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.990
 the mold of spider-man classics that this 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:29.360
 Well, it looks a lot like that, because 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.670
 head is the same but the joint 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:34.160
 see if they change see that 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:36.680
 head down and up and 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.849
 you can also rotate 360 ​​the neck and the 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.789
 head 

00:04:37.849 --> 00:04:43.969

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:46.429

 down and also the fingers can open and 

00:04:59.899 --> 00:05:03.649
 close however they do not have any 

00:05:01.459 --> 00:05:06.110
 articulation in the fingers nothing else is the 

00:05:03.649 --> 00:05:09.830
 pretty well articulated hand 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:11.960
 the torso can rotate to generate 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:14.870
 I walk but can not turn anything you can 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:17.450
 do two sides and the bottom 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:19.820
 of the abdomen if you can move a little 

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:21.980
 make a little laugh down the 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:24.530
 waist can rotate 360 that is 

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:27.500
 is quite this joint is very 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:29.840
 rare because it is in 3 has 33 points of 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:32.660
 articulation what your waist up your 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:35.900
 shoulders can be opened completely from 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:37.820

 knees your calf rotates 360 and you 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:45.470
 can do downward up 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:47.480
 see the tip and well do not have 

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:50.570
 joints of the sides is a 

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:53.060
 excellent figure the truth has better 

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:56.210
 articulation than that of spiderman classic 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:58.820
 and well then this is if it is 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:02.270
 different although the mold on the face is 

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:04.190
 the same practically good 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:06.800
 Well that's how these figures are 

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:10.520
 I want to teach them now if I can 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:12.770
 say that on scale of 15 centimeters or 

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:15.490
 scale laws these are all figures 

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:18.890
 of spider-man who bring the black suit 

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:20.990
 remember that there is already a video with the 

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:23.000
 three other figures that we did not see today and 

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:24.800
