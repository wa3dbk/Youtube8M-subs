00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:15.329
 Copper 11 the syndicate 

00:00:15.329 --> 00:00:19.489
 for the first time reported what appeal and indeed in the genes game of 

00:00:19.489 --> 00:00:22.489
 penultimate or last video I know that I'm exactly 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.320
 Here then looks similar 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.239
 over right 

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:30.529
 who have been misplaced with the earth 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:32.620
 Wine no 

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:36.359
 that's going to widen on Wednesday the 23rd 

00:00:36.359 --> 00:00:38.030
 so join in 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.720
 he then gets a link 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.130
 put on four times 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:47.070
 the stressed commentary but the act initially lived modestly in 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:47.910
 the video 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.850
 through certain swimming 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.640
 everything you already have 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.640
 then never put on 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.080
 and the old game I forgot to make Tanner 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.989
 Oakley's death donations 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.989
 Dairy products 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:18.490
 I have that 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.060
 Wish I did not say more cars needed 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.870
 Blue light on top 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:27.090
 everything around the half round 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.090
 technically then the same 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.200
 her posed with the press 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:41.610
 those are the most beautiful 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.360
 from the values 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.360
 Hermann understand 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.640
 Bangkok morning still have prisoners or something 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.279
 need to transport 

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:11.539
 if yes, it lacks tremendous 

00:02:11.539 --> 00:02:14.099
 the 1 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:16.569
 Naki is packed fresh 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:19.579
 Carlos go 

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:22.579
 or Thomas Mann 

00:02:28.149 --> 00:02:31.379
 the old game with the prisoner transport 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:34.379
 it is not convincing 

00:02:36.679 --> 00:02:39.290
 Flamini wants to see me just write it nice 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.279
 the comments then makes it easy to hang up 

00:02:42.279 --> 00:02:45.279
 and always jump in a video 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:53.709
 they just have to write everything improvement suggestions 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:02.049
 the car is not even bad 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:07.069
 I like that quite well 

00:03:09.029 --> 00:03:12.029

 sometime had to 

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:43.509
 Way to have everything in it 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:47.569

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:11.949
 not because I am satisfied 

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:21.959

00:06:38.349 --> 00:06:39.949
