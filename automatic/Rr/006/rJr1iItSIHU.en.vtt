00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 in this video we are going to show you the 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.230
 operation of the updates in 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.809
 background and how can you improve 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.269
 your user experience and save 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.490
 enough battery and enough resources to 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.470
 phone modifying some parameters 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.750
 what can we do from the application of 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.449
 adjustments that we want to say then good if 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.769
 we access a multitasking you see that in 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.689
 the bottom part at the bottom 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.090
 well, we have different 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.859
 applications all are all are 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.349
 open although it seems that they are not 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:34.050
 just so they are and well then every 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.329
 one is saving the state for example 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.610
 in the case of mountain-bike tics routes 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.350
 Well, it will be ready for you 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.930
 any time we are ready 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.610
 to leave for a session in the case of 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.590
 second hand because if we have the 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.390
 application run in the background in 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.059
 second plane well it will be us 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.820
 looking for the location therefore to 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.739
 will spend enough battery in the case of 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.050
 wal aft, possibly not 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.820
 nothing since good because the application if 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.219
 it is not open and you have not logged in 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.750
 does not do anything in the case of spotify by 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.850
 example then good what you are going to do is 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.530
 that if we are subscribed any 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.240
 of reproduction and this is updated 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.520
 it will automatically be updated in 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.799
 background therefore also we 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.570
 will spend battery then the option 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.250
 What we can do is good once 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.170
 that we are using the applications 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.630
 Well, we can close them as 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.630
 you see like this the applications are closed in 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.909
 both in years 8 with a year 7 but good 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.649
 because there is a method by which 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.450
 you need to be closing the 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:33.149
 applications in this way every time 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.240
 the 16th but we're going to block the use 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:38.490
 of updates in the background 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.080
 of the current applications how 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.899
 you get this good so let's go to 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:46.050
 adjustments and once we 're in adjustments 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:48.450
 let's go down a bit we 're going to go 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.159
 general and in general as you see here we 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.640
 an option appears that is update 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:56.369
 in the background we are going to enter and 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.399
 we have the option to say first 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:02.399
 that applications are not updated in 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:04.979
 background neither by wifi nor by mobile or 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:07.140
 if we want good then we can allow 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.479
 or not allow certain 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.530
 good apps are not updated in 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.880
 background 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.890
 example let's give some examples 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.230
 the application of bags if we do not use it 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.030
 it does not make any sense to 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.670
 update in the background therefore 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.530
 we can remove other applications by 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.780
 example that we do not want you to update 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.760
 our state or have information 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.470
 in the background are social networks 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.810
 since they will spend enough batteries that 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.030
 they are in the background since good 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.520
 they will only receive notifications that only 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.410
 they will do the same but good 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.810
 that once we enter it will be already 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.340
 loaded the last notification or the 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.890
 last event of one of our friends 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.019
 therefore we can also remove them 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.060
 this how many forms with which we have 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:49.590
 better is going to go functioning the 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.040
 phone and we will get save 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.480
 battery and the state of the phone is not going to 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.160
 change is to say let's continue 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.500
 receiving the same things that 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.989
 we received for example something that does not have 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.340
 too much sense that we do not allow in 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:04.590
 second plane are for example the 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.810
 podcast if this is not allowed the 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.209
 update in the background here 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.560
 we are listening to a podcast that 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.270
 not downloaded to our phone 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.740
 whatever and we deny access 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:17.080
 the update in the background as 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:19.150
 it just is not going to listen as 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.670
 You see, we are in the same case as 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.080
 in with spotify if we are with a list 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.760
 of reproduction that we do not have 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.040
 downloaded to the phone we tell you that 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.890
 we do not want it to be updated in second 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:33.240
 flat because we can not listen to it with 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:36.030
 whatsapp then three quarters of the same 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:38.220
 and well, how many more applications and 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:42.920
 thames good so more duration of 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.920
 battery will have your phone
