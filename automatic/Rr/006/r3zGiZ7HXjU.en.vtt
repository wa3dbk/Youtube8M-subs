00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 course of 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.080
 this Russian ship the freighter that was carrying 2 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.289
 tons and done is still in the 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.930
 air and already has an impact date in the 

00:00:10.289 --> 00:00:15.330
 land this is a freighter that now 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:19.410
 it's out of control and you can see it 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:21.960
 going around and around in a way 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.930
 that you can not stop what's going to be 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:28.500
 directly the earth with this impact 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.210
 that already would be predicted the certain thing is that 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.629
 from the flight control center 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.449
 Russian space companies said that they 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:38.339
 lost control of this freighter 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:41.370
 after its release it had 

00:00:38.339 --> 00:00:44.640
 located in a wrong orbit and stopped 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.829
 send data after several attempts 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.889
 failed to regain control of the 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.899
 progress the Russian technicians observed 

00:00:49.889 --> 00:00:54.659
 This freighter began to turn to a 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:57.389
 incredible speed on its own axis 

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:58.889
 they can see it from inside the 

00:00:57.389 --> 00:01:01.909
 freighter can see it through the 

00:00:58.889 --> 00:01:03.629
 cameras as it goes around without control but 

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:06.570
 obviously they can not do it 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.180
 return in a controlled manner weighs two 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.680
 tons and a half 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.360
 has supplies for the station 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.910
 international space they do not 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:17.540
 those who are 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:20.090
 there the astronauts but this ship does not 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:23.570
 manned is arriving at any 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:28.600
 moment towards the earth and it's going to be between 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:32.150
 May 3 and 7 these days would fall 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:34.040
 this ship that is not controlled in 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:38.570
 some point of the earth and of course 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:41.390
 will impact these are the data from 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:44.300
 this progress 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:48.650
 had as objective to arrive with food 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:50.750
 with different elements to supply 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:52.880
 the international space station well 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:56.210
 where you are working intensively and 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:59.030
 they always do it in this case good is 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:02.800
 it waits between the 3 and the 7 of May that 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.800
 make impact with the earth
