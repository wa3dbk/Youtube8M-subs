diet<00:01:03.750> that<00:01:04.170> you<00:01:04.379> get<00:01:04.500> a<00:01:04.530> lot<00:01:04.769> of<00:01:04.890> that<00:01:05.010> zinc<00:01:05.820> is

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
diet that you get a lot of that zinc is

very<00:01:06.210> healthy<00:01:06.420> for<00:01:06.720> prostate<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.350> obviously

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
very healthy for prostate and obviously

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.630 
very healthy for prostate and obviously
other<00:01:08.840> nutrition's<00:01:09.840> such<00:01:10.470> as<00:01:10.680> selenium<00:01:11.040> for

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
other nutrition's such as selenium for

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.609 
other nutrition's such as selenium for
years<00:01:12.000> was<00:01:12.330> a<00:01:12.360> big<00:01:12.600> topic<00:01:12.960> but<00:01:12.990> that<00:01:13.260> hasn't

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
years was a big topic but that hasn't

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.320 
years was a big topic but that hasn't
played<00:01:13.830> a<00:01:13.860> big<00:01:14.130> role<00:01:14.159> so<00:01:14.520> think<00:01:15.030> of<00:01:15.119> lycopene

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
played a big role so think of lycopene

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
played a big role so think of lycopene
and<00:01:15.689> zinc

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
and zinc

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.219 
and zinc
those<00:01:16.590> are<00:01:16.770> good<00:01:17.310> for<00:01:17.610> healthy<00:01:18.210> prostate<00:01:18.450> then

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
those are good for healthy prostate then

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.620 
those are good for healthy prostate then
you<00:01:19.380> think<00:01:19.619> about<00:01:19.830> healthy<00:01:20.340> heart<00:01:20.600> what<00:01:21.600> I

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
you think about healthy heart what I

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.039 
you think about healthy heart what I
take<00:01:21.990> is<00:01:22.170> usually<00:01:22.619> flaxseed<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.340> fish<00:01:24.210> oil<00:01:24.479> in

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
take is usually flaxseed and fish oil in

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.929 
take is usually flaxseed and fish oil in
order<00:01:25.200> to<00:01:25.409> lower<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.890> triglyceride<00:01:26.670> and

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
order to lower the triglyceride and

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.969 
order to lower the triglyceride and
reduce<00:01:27.479> any<00:01:27.689> kind<00:01:27.930> of<00:01:27.990> inflammation<00:01:28.290> in<00:01:28.860> the

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
reduce any kind of inflammation in the

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.149 
reduce any kind of inflammation in the
vessel<00:01:29.400> so<00:01:29.579> those<00:01:29.729> are<00:01:29.909> very<00:01:30.180> very<00:01:30.390> important

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:31.159 
vessel so those are very very important

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:33.050 
vessel so those are very very important
when<00:01:32.159> you<00:01:32.250> think<00:01:32.520> would<00:01:32.640> form<00:01:32.880> of<00:01:32.970> the

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
when you think would form of the

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.609 
when you think would form of the
fisherman<00:01:33.450> what<00:01:33.570> form<00:01:33.780> is<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:33.960> fish<00:01:34.110> just<00:01:34.470> the

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
fisherman what form is the fish just the

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.170 
fisherman what form is the fish just the
peel<00:01:34.799> that<00:01:34.979> I<00:01:35.009> take<00:01:35.340> you<00:01:35.670> know<00:01:35.790> this<00:01:36.030> really

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.679 
of that should you take well that's an
excellent<00:01:53.189> question<00:01:53.399> because<00:01:54.030> you<00:01:54.360> know<00:01:54.390> most

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
excellent question because you know most

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.120 
excellent question because you know most
doctors<00:01:54.869> would<00:01:55.229> probably<00:01:55.590> recommend<00:01:55.829> about<00:01:56.009> a

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
doctors would probably recommend about a

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.100 
doctors would probably recommend about a
thousand<00:01:56.640> unit<00:01:56.909> but<00:01:57.360> I<00:01:57.390> think<00:01:57.719> somewhere<00:01:57.990> in

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
thousand unit but I think somewhere in

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.569 
thousand unit but I think somewhere in
the<00:01:58.140> range<00:01:58.320> of<00:01:58.500> two<00:01:58.680> thousand<00:01:59.159> it's<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.430> way

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
the range of two thousand it's the way

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.459 
the range of two thousand it's the way
to<00:01:59.610> go<00:01:59.880> now<00:02:00.360> where<00:02:00.659> do<00:02:00.719> you<00:02:00.810> get<00:02:00.899> your<00:02:00.960> vitamin

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
outside like commuting to work whatever

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.850 
outside like commuting to work whatever
that's<00:02:39.540> exactly<00:02:40.019> right<00:02:40.080> because<00:02:40.230> you<00:02:40.709> can

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
that's exactly right because you can

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.380 
that's exactly right because you can
generate<00:02:41.220> a<00:02:41.280> lot<00:02:41.519> of<00:02:41.549> vitamin<00:02:41.910> D<00:02:42.000> under<00:02:42.239> your

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
generate a lot of vitamin D under your

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.240 
generate a lot of vitamin D under your
skin<00:02:42.660> so<00:02:42.840> you<00:02:42.870> don't<00:02:43.170> want<00:02:43.379> to<00:02:43.500> overdo<00:02:43.799> it<00:02:43.950> and

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
skin so you don't want to overdo it and

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.300 
skin so you don't want to overdo it and
that's<00:02:44.910> the<00:02:45.150> big<00:02:45.450> ticket<00:02:45.660> for<00:02:46.230> a<00:02:46.260> long<00:02:46.799> time<00:02:47.099> we

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
that's the big ticket for a long time we

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.830 
that's the big ticket for a long time we
thought<00:02:47.340> vitamin<00:02:47.880> D<00:02:47.970> is<00:02:48.030> very<00:02:48.269> helpful<00:02:48.480> for

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
thought vitamin D is very helpful for

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.050 
thought vitamin D is very helpful for
just<00:02:49.290> bone<00:02:49.500> absorptions<00:02:50.099> but<00:02:50.579> now<00:02:50.730> there's<00:02:51.000> a

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
just bone absorptions but now there's a

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.729 
just bone absorptions but now there's a
lot<00:02:51.299> of<00:02:51.420> studies<00:02:51.780> that<00:02:51.930> it<00:02:52.079> shows<00:02:52.319> link

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
lot of studies that it shows link

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.979 
lot of studies that it shows link
between<00:02:52.920> vitamin<00:02:53.459> D<00:02:53.610> and<00:02:53.790> prostate<00:02:54.599> cancer

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
between vitamin D and prostate cancer

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.020 
between vitamin D and prostate cancer
breast<00:02:55.170> cancer<00:02:55.410> and<00:02:55.769> colon<00:02:55.920> cancer<00:02:56.220> so<00:02:57.000> you

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
breast cancer and colon cancer so you

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.789 
breast cancer and colon cancer so you

00:02:58.789 --> 00:02:58.799 
really want to measure it first and if

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:00.589 
really want to measure it first and if
you're<00:02:58.950> deficient<00:02:59.250> you<00:02:59.610> want<00:02:59.970> to<00:03:00.060> supply<00:03:00.390> them

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:00.599 
you're deficient you want to supply them

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:02.150 
you're deficient you want to supply them
