00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:06.710 

look<00:00:04.470> we<00:00:04.950> asked<00:00:05.279> far<00:00:05.940> more<00:00:06.150> controversial

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
look we asked far more controversial

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:07.970 
look we asked far more controversial
question<00:00:06.960> we<00:00:07.020> talked<00:00:07.140> about<00:00:07.259> race<00:00:07.560> I<00:00:07.799> mean

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
question we talked about race I mean

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.470 
question we talked about race I mean
which<00:00:08.580> always<00:00:08.760> come<00:00:08.970> for<00:00:09.150> something<00:00:09.300> you

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
which always come for something you

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.350 
which always come for something you
asking<00:00:09.809> about<00:00:09.960> race<00:00:10.670> what<00:00:11.670> one<00:00:12.179> of<00:00:12.210> the<00:00:12.330> things

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
asking about race what one of the things

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.400 
asking about race what one of the things
we<00:00:12.570> study<00:00:12.750> it's<00:00:12.960> a<00:00:13.019> black/white<00:00:13.380> test-score

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
we study it's a black/white test-score

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.320 
we study it's a black/white test-score
gap<00:00:13.830> it's<00:00:14.190> exactly<00:00:14.670> the<00:00:14.820> pair<00:00:15.030> of<00:00:15.120> why<00:00:15.269> is

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
gap it's exactly the pair of why is

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.060 
gap it's exactly the pair of why is
there<00:00:15.570> black/white<00:00:16.020> test-score<00:00:16.230> gap<00:00:16.619> well

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
there black/white test-score gap well

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.550 
there black/white test-score gap well
what's<00:00:17.369> interesting<00:00:17.550> is<00:00:18.090> in<00:00:18.930> this<00:00:19.170> book<00:00:19.350> the

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
what's interesting is in this book the

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:20.960 
what's interesting is in this book the
research<00:00:19.859> I<00:00:19.949> did<00:00:20.100> with<00:00:20.250> Roland<00:00:20.520> fryer<00:00:20.730> at

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
research I did with Roland fryer at

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.240 
research I did with Roland fryer at
Harvard<00:00:21.330> what<00:00:21.990> we<00:00:22.140> show<00:00:22.380> is<00:00:22.830> that<00:00:23.010> if<00:00:23.100> you<00:00:23.189> just

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
Harvard what we show is that if you just

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.810 
Harvard what we show is that if you just
controlled<00:00:23.820> for<00:00:24.000> a<00:00:24.029> handful<00:00:24.570> of<00:00:24.630> variables

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:25.820 
controlled for a handful of variables

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.910 
controlled for a handful of variables
when<00:00:26.820> black<00:00:27.119> children<00:00:27.510> show<00:00:27.720> up<00:00:27.900> in<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.619> first

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
when black children show up in the first

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.800 
when black children show up in the first
year<00:00:29.279> school<00:00:29.580> in<00:00:29.880> kindergarten<00:00:30.449> they

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
year school in kindergarten they

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.840 
year school in kindergarten they
actually<00:00:31.170> test<00:00:31.439> as<00:00:31.619> well<00:00:31.769> as<00:00:32.189> white<00:00:32.460> students

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
actually test as well as white students

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.510 
actually test as well as white students
and<00:00:33.090> as<00:00:33.239> a<00:00:33.270> result<00:00:33.690> in<00:00:33.950> all<00:00:34.950> of<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.309> tests

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
and as a result in all of the tests

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.030 
and as a result in all of the tests
that's<00:00:35.700> ever<00:00:35.940> been<00:00:36.149> done<00:00:36.210> of<00:00:36.829> achievement<00:00:37.829> of

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
that's ever been done of achievement of

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.410 
that's ever been done of achievement of
black<00:00:38.280> and<00:00:38.460> white<00:00:38.550> students<00:00:38.910> in<00:00:39.030> that<00:00:39.120> states

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
black and white students in that states

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.260 
black and white students in that states
is<00:00:39.600> my<00:00:40.320> to<00:00:41.010> my<00:00:41.129> belief<00:00:41.399> have<00:00:41.550> never<00:00:42.059> been<00:00:42.239> a

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
is my to my belief have never been a

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.850 
is my to my belief have never been a
case<00:00:42.480> where<00:00:42.719> you<00:00:42.780> could<00:00:42.930> get<00:00:43.469> rid<00:00:43.649> of<00:00:43.680> his

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
case where you could get rid of his

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.279 
case where you could get rid of his
black/white<00:00:44.219> test-score<00:00:44.250> yeah<00:00:44.700> and<00:00:44.969> so<00:00:45.600> we

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
black/white test-score yeah and so we

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.799 
black/white test-score yeah and so we
show<00:00:46.500> it<00:00:46.620> early<00:00:46.920> in<00:00:47.010> life<00:00:47.360> really<00:00:48.360> if<00:00:48.420> you<00:00:48.539> if

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
show it early in life really if you if

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.540 
show it early in life really if you if
all<00:00:48.960> you<00:00:49.140> knew<00:00:49.260> about<00:00:49.379> a<00:00:49.559> child<00:00:49.890> were<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.280> few

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
all you knew about a child were a few

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.950 
all you knew about a child were a few
background<00:00:50.730> characteristics<00:00:51.600> like<00:00:51.719> their

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
background characteristics like their

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.139 
background characteristics like their
income<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.440> education<00:00:52.860> of<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.039> parents<00:00:53.340> you

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
income the education of the parents you

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.340 
income the education of the parents you
wouldn't<00:00:54.329> be<00:00:54.480> able<00:00:54.539> to<00:00:54.629> knowing<00:00:55.079> where<00:00:55.230> their

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
wouldn't be able to knowing where their

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.479 
wouldn't be able to knowing where their
black<00:00:55.469> and<00:00:55.680> white<00:00:55.800> would<00:00:55.949> tell<00:00:56.070> you<00:00:56.160> nothing

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
black and white would tell you nothing

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:57.830 
black and white would tell you nothing
about<00:00:56.579> their<00:00:56.850> test<00:00:57.030> scores<00:00:57.059> know<00:00:57.420> what's

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
about their test scores know what's

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.930 
about their test scores know what's
interesting<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.379> data<00:00:58.590> is<00:00:59.460> three<00:00:59.760> years

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
interesting the data is three years

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.049 
interesting the data is three years
later<00:01:00.710> these<00:01:01.710> big<00:01:01.949> gaps<00:01:02.160> emerge<00:01:02.520> it's<00:01:02.789> a<00:01:02.850> lie

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
later these big gaps emerge it's a lie

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.880 
later these big gaps emerge it's a lie
well<00:01:03.480> we<00:01:03.690> don't<00:01:03.780> know<00:01:03.930> why<00:01:04.110> it's<00:01:04.379> it's<00:01:04.619> a<00:01:04.739> it's

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
well we don't know why it's it's a it's

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.320 
well we don't know why it's it's a it's
a<00:01:05.010> hard<00:01:05.250> question<00:01:05.519> and<00:01:05.970> then<00:01:06.119> that's

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
a hard question and then that's

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
a hard question and then that's
something<00:01:06.420> we<00:01:06.600> ought<00:01:06.689> to<00:01:06.780> find<00:01:06.930> out<00:01:07.110> quickly

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
something we ought to find out quickly

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.770 
something we ought to find out quickly
what's<00:01:07.650> Ryan<00:01:07.920> we're<00:01:08.430> trying<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:09.000> we<00:01:09.150> we<00:01:09.479> put

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
what's Ryan we're trying and we we put

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.750 
what's Ryan we're trying and we we put
everything<00:01:10.320> we<00:01:10.500> put<00:01:10.799> into<00:01:10.950> it<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:11.280> we<00:01:11.400> don't

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
everything we put into it and we don't

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.609 
everything we put into it and we don't
understand<00:01:12.210> I<00:01:12.420> mean<00:01:12.630> we've<00:01:12.780> out<00:01:13.260> a<00:01:13.290> lot<00:01:13.530> of

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
understand I mean we've out a lot of

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.080 
understand I mean we've out a lot of
things<00:01:13.799> we'll<00:01:14.100> give<00:01:14.220> me<00:01:14.340> one<00:01:14.369> possible

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
things we'll give me one possible

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:24.499 
things we'll give me one possible
explanation<00:01:22.820> Amin<00:01:23.820> on<00:01:23.909> is<00:01:23.970> very<00:01:24.150> real<00:01:24.479> and

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
explanation Amin on is very real and

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.929 
explanation Amin on is very real and
very<00:01:24.720> why<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.439> acting<00:01:25.890> white<00:01:26.070> phenomenon<00:01:26.700> is

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
very why the acting white phenomenon is

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.819 
very why the acting white phenomenon is
very<00:01:27.210> significant<00:01:27.840> very<00:01:28.049> damaging<00:01:28.500> which<00:01:28.680> is

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
very significant very damaging which is

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.580 
very significant very damaging which is
that<00:01:29.070> if<00:01:29.310> you<00:01:30.060> know<00:01:30.180> depending<00:01:30.590> school

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
that if you know depending school

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.140 
that if you know depending school
depending<00:01:32.040> on<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.250> racial<00:01:32.549> composition<00:01:32.670> it

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
depending on the racial composition it

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.480 
depending on the racial composition it
differs<00:01:33.509> in<00:01:33.659> magnitude<00:01:34.140> but<00:01:34.380> that<00:01:34.590> black<00:01:35.130> kids

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
differs in magnitude but that black kids

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.300 
differs in magnitude but that black kids
in<00:01:35.700> a<00:01:35.880> school<00:01:36.240> will<00:01:37.110> often<00:01:37.560> be<00:01:37.710> discouraged

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
in a school will often be discouraged

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.249 
in a school will often be discouraged
from<00:01:38.520> accomplishing<00:01:39.420> in<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:39.630> same<00:01:39.840> way<00:01:40.049> that

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
from accomplishing in the same way that

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.719 
from accomplishing in the same way that
white<00:01:40.409> kids<00:01:40.710> are<00:01:40.829> encouraged<00:01:41.220> to<00:01:41.250> accomplish

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
white kids are encouraged to accomplish

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:42.980 
white kids are encouraged to accomplish
it's<00:01:41.909> that<00:01:42.060> simple<00:01:42.390> that<00:01:42.509> they're<00:01:42.689> that

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
it's that simple that they're that
