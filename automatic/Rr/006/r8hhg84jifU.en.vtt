00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.500 
what's happening on the top you can see
an<00:01:00.090> effort<00:01:00.270> to<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.690> modulated<00:01:01.440> signal

as far as the colors are concerned red

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.960 
as far as the colors are concerned red
means<00:01:36.119> a<00:01:36.420> lot<00:01:36.750> of<00:01:36.780> vibration<00:01:37.110> energy<00:01:37.970> counting

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
means a lot of vibration energy counting

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.620 
means a lot of vibration energy counting
off<00:01:39.119> to<00:01:39.330> orange<00:01:39.750> green<00:01:40.759> blue<00:01:41.759> and<00:01:42.270> then

off to orange green blue and then

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.109 
off to orange green blue and then
finally<00:01:43.110> white<00:01:43.619> where<00:01:44.070> there's<00:01:44.280> no<00:01:44.460> energy<00:01:44.759> at

finally white where there's no energy at

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.419 
finally white where there's no energy at
all<00:01:45.210> that<00:01:45.570> frequency<00:01:46.020> that's<00:01:46.259> pretty<00:01:46.530> pretty

00:01:47.419 --> 00:01:47.429 
all that frequency that's pretty pretty

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:51.800 
all that frequency that's pretty pretty
high<00:01:47.610> up<00:01:47.640> there<00:01:48.920> if<00:01:49.920> you<00:01:50.130> look<00:01:50.369> at<00:01:50.690> what<00:01:51.690> is

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
high up there if you look at what is

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.249 
high up there if you look at what is
going<00:01:51.840> on<00:01:52.350> I'll<00:01:52.979> create<00:01:54.200> assimilation<00:01:55.200> of

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
going on I'll create assimilation of

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.490 
going on I'll create assimilation of
vibration<00:01:55.920> by<00:01:56.520> just<00:01:57.060> running<00:01:57.330> my<00:01:57.600> hand<00:01:57.899> over

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
vibration by just running my hand over

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.139 
vibration by just running my hand over
the<00:01:58.800> table<00:01:59.250> or<00:01:59.909> jockey

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:01.149 
the table or jockey

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:04.669 
the table or jockey
then<00:02:01.719> you<00:02:01.840> can<00:02:01.960> see<00:02:02.109> on<00:02:02.259> this<00:02:02.409> side<00:02:02.710> again<00:02:03.299> the

00:02:04.669 --> 00:02:04.679 
then you can see on this side again the

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:07.410 
then you can see on this side again the
table<00:02:05.679> is<00:02:05.890> seeing<00:02:06.159> a<00:02:06.280> lot<00:02:06.490> more<00:02:06.520> vibration

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
table is seeing a lot more vibration

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.699 
table is seeing a lot more vibration
than<00:02:08.410> the<00:02:08.590> unit<00:02:09.220> mounted<00:02:09.429> on<00:02:09.759> our<00:02:09.970> platform<00:02:10.709> on

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709 
than the unit mounted on our platform on

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:15.180 
than the unit mounted on our platform on
the<00:02:11.769> left<00:02:12.190> you<00:02:12.730> can<00:02:12.910> see<00:02:13.230> vibration<00:02:14.230> content<00:02:14.860> a

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
the left you can see vibration content a

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.699 
the left you can see vibration content a
lot<00:02:15.940> of<00:02:16.120> red<00:02:16.360> over<00:02:16.660> here<00:02:16.930> at<00:02:17.440> these

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
lot of red over here at these

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:21.059 
lot of red over here at these
frequencies<00:02:18.430> a<00:02:18.760> lot<00:02:19.360> less<00:02:19.660> at<00:02:20.410> the<00:02:20.500> same<00:02:20.530> time

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
frequencies a lot less at the same time

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:26.160 
frequencies a lot less at the same time
over<00:02:21.700> here<00:02:23.220> this<00:02:24.220> is<00:02:24.280> happening<00:02:25.000> that<00:02:25.180> there's

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
over here this is happening that there's

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.710 
over here this is happening that there's
a<00:02:26.260> significant<00:02:26.950> amount<00:02:27.010> here<00:02:27.580> at<00:02:28.120> sixty

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
a significant amount here at sixty

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.839 
a significant amount here at sixty
that's<00:02:29.140> being<00:02:29.500> reduced<00:02:30.040> I'll<00:02:30.549> talk<00:02:30.819> about

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:30.849 
that's being reduced I'll talk about

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:33.030 
that's being reduced I'll talk about
this<00:02:31.299> straight<00:02:31.599> line<00:02:31.629> which<00:02:32.170> is<00:02:32.349> looks<00:02:32.799> pretty

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
this straight line which is looks pretty

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.130 
this straight line which is looks pretty
strong<00:02:33.430> on<00:02:33.819> the<00:02:34.000> right<00:02:34.180> side<00:02:34.420> in<00:02:34.630> the<00:02:34.720> second

and<00:02:35.470> we<00:02:35.530> see<00:02:35.709> a<00:02:35.739> lot<00:02:35.980> more<00:02:36.010> red<00:02:36.579> tapering<00:02:37.269> off

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
and we see a lot more red tapering off

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.830 
and we see a lot more red tapering off

it's not me knocking on the table it is
it's<00:03:02.500> significant<00:03:03.340> because<00:03:03.489> it's<00:03:04.239> picking<00:03:04.599> up

it's significant because it's picking up

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.550 
it's significant because it's picking up
