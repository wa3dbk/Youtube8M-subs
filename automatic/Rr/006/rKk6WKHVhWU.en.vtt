the hardest part you know from right
here<00:03:37.250> it<00:03:37.370> looks<00:03:37.519> good<00:03:37.810> once<00:03:38.810> you<00:03:38.930> get<00:03:39.109> to<00:03:39.319> get

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
here it looks good once you get to get

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:46.559 
here it looks good once you get to get
up<00:03:39.590> on<00:03:39.950> it<00:03:40.159> and<00:03:40.280> it<00:03:40.370> really<00:03:41.030> ain't<00:03:42.459> inspect<00:03:43.459> it

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:46.569 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:51.339 

so<00:03:47.569> you<00:03:47.720> got<00:03:47.900> a<00:03:47.930> little<00:03:48.290> bit<00:03:48.790> sloppy<00:03:49.790> on<00:03:50.299> Jo<00:03:50.989> are

so you got a little bit sloppy on Jo are
right<00:03:51.650> there<00:03:52.239> but<00:03:53.239> hey<00:03:53.390> Who<00:03:53.689> am<00:03:53.720> I<00:03:53.959> to<00:03:54.019> say<00:03:54.230> that

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
right there but hey Who am I to say that

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.140 
right there but hey Who am I to say that
because<00:03:54.500> this<00:03:54.709> is<00:03:54.950> a<00:03:54.980> hard<00:03:55.310> thing<00:03:55.519> to<00:03:55.730> deal

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
because this is a hard thing to deal

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.539 
because this is a hard thing to deal
with<00:03:56.180> don't<00:03:56.510> dwell<00:03:56.690> on<00:03:56.989> everything<00:03:57.980> else

00:03:58.539 --> 00:03:58.549 
with don't dwell on everything else

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:02.699 
with don't dwell on everything else
looks<00:03:58.879> good

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:02.709 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:07.660 

maybe<00:04:05.560> the<00:04:06.560> only<00:04:06.769> thing<00:04:06.859> I<00:04:07.069> was<00:04:07.250> maybe<00:04:07.400> say

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:07.670 
maybe the only thing I was maybe say

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:09.610 
maybe the only thing I was maybe say
also<00:04:07.849> is<00:04:08.150> it's<00:04:08.299> a<00:04:08.420> little<00:04:08.569> shiny<00:04:09.019> a<00:04:09.349> little

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
also is it's a little shiny a little

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.240 
also is it's a little shiny a little
glossy<00:04:09.859> you<00:04:10.280> see<00:04:10.459> that<00:04:11.349> try<00:04:12.349> to<00:04:12.379> get<00:04:12.799> that<00:04:12.980> down

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
glossy you see that try to get that down

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.610 
glossy you see that try to get that down
to<00:04:13.310> a<00:04:13.519> more<00:04:13.730> flat<00:04:14.120> black<00:04:14.480> and<00:04:14.780> a<00:04:14.840> flat<00:04:15.319> blue

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
to a more flat black and a flat blue

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.240 
to a more flat black and a flat blue
like<00:04:15.799> this<00:04:16.209> matte<00:04:17.209> so<00:04:18.049> it<00:04:18.229> isn't<00:04:18.500> so<00:04:18.680> glossy

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
like this matte so it isn't so glossy

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:24.219 
like this matte so it isn't so glossy
that's<00:04:19.880> probably<00:04:20.120> the<00:04:20.209> only<00:04:20.359> thing<00:04:20.840> I<00:04:23.229> mean

00:04:24.219 --> 00:04:24.229 
that's probably the only thing I mean

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:25.719 
that's probably the only thing I mean
from<00:04:24.349> a<00:04:24.410> distance<00:04:24.979> but<00:04:25.130> somebody<00:04:25.430> got<00:04:25.580> this
