00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:14.650
 and everything if I am austere and as always 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.990
 bringing you a new video and good people 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.029
 we are on the check out map so it is 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:20.860
 we are playing gears of war they already have and 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:24.390
 knowing the map the first thing we're going 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:27.399
 to see is the very good skin that we bring 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.460
 that's how we have our armor skin 

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:32.559
 yesterday and our shotgun kim very 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.280
 striking that I do not remember how it 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:35.920
 call 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.020
 synosis or I do not know how to hypnosis 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.710
 thing well and good to know the check map 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.460
 out 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.460
 Really 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:48.240
 I think it's the same 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:52.860
 Apparently proportions 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:56.130
 and we have to vote ok here they replaced 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:59.280
 the bags by boxes of ammunition that 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:03.320
 good as you see they do not give grenades anymore 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.320
 pretty good pretty good 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:11.060
 we have the electronics that is 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.050
 completely the same can be tightened the 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:17.300
 same button 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.300
 let's see if he follows the famous 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:27.359
 extinguisher not seemingly this they have 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.890
 removed we have no extinguisher in 

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:31.930
 purchases 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:36.460
 follow the TV follows everything the same 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:38.740
 what is this like I was, I wish I did not 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:41.580
 have seen shit 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.890
 there we see another box of ammunition 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.530
 the reason of the other side 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.150
 very similar we will ride the boat to 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:52.690
 can go to the area of grenades 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:55.290
 let's hope that we do not read another I love 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.290
 cage 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:00.110
 do not 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:02.570
 ok here are fragmentation grenades 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:06.800
 so we can already take grenades from 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:10.490
 fragmentation there digger comes out 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:14.450
 ok then let's see here that comes out 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:16.840
 sniper and here comes granada de tinta 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.840
 ok way 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:24.220
 I really like the animation here 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:26.300
 As you get off the stage you feel more 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.580
 lightweight 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:34.460
 will have to see if the grenades 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:37.190
 fragmentation are put as past no no 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:40.510
 they get stuck in the termite so 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.840
 It will be a little easier to avoid them 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:46.000
 and good here the snyder already to finish 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:48.189
 the map is completely equal 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.769
 Check completely symmetric as 

00:02:48.189 --> 00:02:52.769
 we asked and 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:03:00.490
 I hope you liked the map 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:03.490
 it really is just like gears of war 3 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:05.590
 it's pretty good enough let's see 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:07.320
 how it works in game modes and in 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.880
 the speed of gears of war judgment 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:12.430
 now with already the changes that were 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.770
 applied in private as we can 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:17.320
 be playing here execution and feel 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:19.450
 a little bit in gears of war three keys and 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.010
 for this is what we want 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.830
 we just go we put our disk 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.760
 the course of war 3 and we started playing 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:27.019
 the game 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.870
 and good people, I hope you have them 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:32.239
 liked the map many already know him 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:34.159
 others not some new people and this 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:36.079
 is a very good map in gears of war 3 

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:37.909
 what good was brought to gears of war already 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:40.370
 they are many say that good is not 

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:42.440
 completely changed nothing but I think 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.239
 that is fine, not us, so 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.310
 what we would do we wanted it the same 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:49.239
 many said that good that minimum that 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:52.630
 the pillar is destroyed here or I do not know what 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:55.360
 but good are things 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:57.970
 extras not the truth if they did not change it 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:00.660
 nothing happened and if it was the same 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.660
 the map 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:05.570
 and we are going to show this vote 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:12.340
 well here the drawers do not fall 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:17.230
 how it happened in my software 3 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:19.359
 this is done in the same way and not only in 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:21.639

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:22.810
 the check-out map if you are on 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:25.419
 agreement that they have left it the same 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:29.080
 would have preferred some change in what 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:31.870
 staff I think it's pretty good 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:33.460

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:35.290
