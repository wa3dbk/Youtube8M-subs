00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.799
 Welcome to a new one 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.029
 round ender games we are there with the 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.069
 kangaroo is ok I have this time 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.660
 one exception, the selected kangaroo 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.259
 because now wanted to see now 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.340
 already written a few times and 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.650
 That's why I just have it now 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.410
 I really have to say 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.470
 it's actually worse now 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.060
 become 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.890
 you could do a lot what you now 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.460
 no longer can and that is today 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.230
 Just here in the video and about 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.260
 such also say i just invite everyone 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.660
 round from now on no matter whether good or 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.700
 Bad because I do not feel like it 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.399
 do not take two hours or recordings 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:44.480
 so and then everyone can always be 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.950
 bad are such springer times down 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.760
 Of course, the protection time loses there 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.920
 you do not live 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.640
 but if you are not protection time anymore 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.500
 then you lose love, that means something 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.850
 means that you have lost life if 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.059
 you are blown up because you are too high 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:03.180
 jumps that I think hold you have 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:08.130
 badly made a gold threesome 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:10.830
 someone thank someone please someone and thank you 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.740
 It goes without saying that it is great that you 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.090
 can now move faster here 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.040
 I'm a bit faster if 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.900
 I could jump normally if I'm fine 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.780
 I'm here as the others 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.479
 in my opinion but much good for me 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.360
 that too, not because I could do it back then 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.799
 Also here if I'm in the water 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.720
 double jump that does not work now 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:36.270
 remember what everything ok I need 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.119
 first of all a bit of wood 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:43.409
 I have 23 iron, that is to say, it is her 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:45.479
 Of course, having a sword is not 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.799
 just the desire of every just a 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:51.060
 hard to have any iron in the 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:54.899
 but for the beginning it should be and 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:57.110
 it must be enough says disappears 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.110
 easy 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:09.930
 Toni will surely change me 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:11.870
 not good I celebrate oh so on the 

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:15.210
 Cases do not matter to me 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.650
 jockey hockey he is the first of me 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:19.830
 not attacked right from the start 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:24.150
 prop sandy boy only if you see me in front 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:26.150
 god in hedge- and are you right you have 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.550
 right there 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:34.140
 i am double jumping and loser 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:39.900
 survive for that yes that's it 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:41.990
 What I need so without joke I leave 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.990
 path 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:48.750
 I hope that's not the end of a web 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:51.510
 where the end of the violence I find the end 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:54.540
 the map has been buffeted and have synonymous 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:57.330
 still got a knight effect so has 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.970
 otherwise China will not be able to rear up 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.850
 that could be good but also 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:07.410
 Bad time I take a look 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:13.410
 I think that's good for me 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:14.670
 stick two diaz and so no one to me 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.170
 can leave a headshot because otherwise 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:20.209
 I would really enjoy this 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:23.840
 just not that if we did not 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:23.840
 razed a helmet 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:39.840
 ok yes there you have me that I'm fine me 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:43.590
 have the complicated posters we can 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:48.110
 yes now only age first attacks and 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:48.110
 then no longer not here 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.060
 that would be mean now but hey 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:13.760
 again just with me around cakes so 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:16.060
 But scrap is there too, I want to be happy 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:24.919
 that I was not waiting for it 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:28.970
 ok big meat again so there and go 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:32.949
 I need arrows and again 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.949
 eat something and more 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:38.060
 I think it's a pity because 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:39.710
 there is a tower of the front to the tower 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:42.139
 everyone tries with his tower easy 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:44.229
 to win that is totally boring 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:44.229
 here 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:51.289
 I mean you would theoretically if you 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:54.020
 Know that you build the tower throughout 

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:56.050
 walk around because then you can not 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:05:00.710
 fall down 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:02.360
 I found that great at the kangaroo, for example 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:04.400
 last time I fell down from the tower and 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:06.310
 did not get any harm now 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.570
 Again, you click that unfortunately 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:14.840
 That's why I say yes was the kangaroo 

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:19.659
 that's a little worse 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:19.659
 pig haya pig another pig 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:24.400
 Give me food for ever 

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:41.129
 where am I so dark here 

00:05:30.619 --> 00:05:42.599
 wtf where am I really down 

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:49.289
 he came underneath it 

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:54.899
 or what's not funny worry me 

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:58.619
 that brings no joke that is not 

00:05:54.899 --> 00:06:06.439
 funny and I can not get out of it 

00:05:58.619 --> 00:06:06.439
 or what is there 

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:11.460
 older 

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:16.720
 but a little bit annoying 

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:20.150
 of course doubles jumps have that 

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:24.350
 I almost forgot again 

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:25.070
 was yes but how to step so okay from 

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:28.190
 Here we come 

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:30.710
 I will lie again because if 

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:32.780
 I posted it again so perfect 

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:33.949
 I knew it would be ford but me 

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:36.229
 did not know if I brought upstairs 

00:06:33.949 --> 00:06:38.540
 are or will put you down 

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:39.979
 because there are so many people right now 

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:42.199
 built to the tower and that makes 

00:06:39.979 --> 00:06:45.889
 a lot of fun if you through such a 

00:06:42.199 --> 00:06:51.350
 tower dies i say s 

00:06:45.889 --> 00:06:52.970
 and i am being persecuted yes i am dead 

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:54.979
 the bin by two times I attack 

00:06:52.970 --> 00:07:00.010
 dead that's impossible ne actually 

00:06:54.979 --> 00:07:03.080
 but then attacked twice 

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:04.340
 cool , let's see if there for a moment 

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:11.240
 still who is on top of the tower or already 

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:12.770
 died by that yes I knew it 

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:14.720
 that there is no exit somewhere like that 

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:18.139
 open is no longer that is there is 

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:23.120
 unfortunately already died by saying 

00:07:18.139 --> 00:07:27.260
 okay i would say i lost 

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:28.550
 yes I unfortunately lost kangaroo pack 

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:31.610
 my conclusion in any case 

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:35.720
 It was better in any case it was 

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:38.060
 better it's okay you's just a 

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:39.460
 a bit faster then that 

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:41.660
 other 

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:43.070
 I think you have shoes on then 

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:45.699
 if you lose your life no more if 

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:49.729
 you jump but on the jump makes 

00:07:45.699 --> 00:07:52.760
 but otherwise I would not be so often 

00:07:49.729 --> 00:07:53.930
 take well then I would say 

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:55.060
 Just write me in the 

00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:58.550
 Comments 

00:07:55.060 --> 00:08:00.590
 like any small Rocat is all part 

00:07:58.550 --> 00:08:06.320
 already by the cat as her 

00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:08.740
 kangaroo kit finds and then until the 

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:08.740
 next time
