here's<00:00:14.160> the<00:00:14.309> temperature<00:00:14.580> gauge<00:00:14.910> in<00:00:15.330> our

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
here's the temperature gauge in our

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.440 
here's the temperature gauge in our
vegetable<00:00:16.020> garden<00:00:16.049> and<00:00:16.439> outside<00:00:17.150> and<00:00:18.150> it<00:00:18.420> is

saying it it's over still over 100
degrees<00:00:21.000> out<00:00:21.420> here<00:00:23.449> so<00:00:24.449> lets<00:00:24.660> us<00:00:24.869> check<00:00:25.470> on<00:00:25.680> our

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:26.600 
degrees out here so lets us check on our

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.900 
degrees out here so lets us check on our
chickens<00:00:27.600> and<00:00:27.869> see<00:00:28.189> how<00:00:29.189> we're<00:00:29.400> keeping<00:00:29.760> them

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
chickens and see how we're keeping them

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
summer heat so here's our makeshift

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.190 
summer heat so here's our makeshift
thing<00:00:41.250> until<00:00:41.489> we<00:00:41.610> get<00:00:41.730> our<00:00:41.879> house<00:00:42.090> which<00:00:43.050> will

be here in a few days order form a
chicken<00:00:45.239> coop<00:00:45.920> I've<00:00:46.920> done<00:00:47.190> some<00:00:47.399> research<00:00:47.579> for

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
chicken coop I've done some research for

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.100 
chicken coop I've done some research for
the<00:00:48.090> heat<00:00:48.329> is<00:00:48.510> very<00:00:48.930> dangerous<00:00:49.230> to<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.770> birds

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.110 
the heat is very dangerous to the birds

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.840 
the heat is very dangerous to the birds
so<00:00:52.110> we've<00:00:52.379> been<00:00:52.829> putting<00:00:53.100> a<00:00:53.340> lot<00:00:53.460> of<00:00:53.520> ice

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
so we've been putting a lot of ice

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.139 
so we've been putting a lot of ice
inside<00:00:54.510> of<00:00:54.660> their<00:00:54.780> water<00:00:55.020> thing<00:00:56.010> here<00:00:56.430> I've

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
inside of their water thing here I've

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.630 
inside of their water thing here I've
also<00:00:57.239> read<00:00:57.539> that<00:00:57.809> watermelon<00:00:58.620> these<00:00:58.949> out<00:00:59.430> of

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640

kind<00:01:21.650> of<00:01:21.710> makeshift<00:01:22.100> put<00:01:22.370> over<00:01:22.640> here<00:01:22.820> for<00:01:23.090> now

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350 
kind of makeshift put over here for now

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.230 
kind of makeshift put over here for now
to<00:01:24.350> keep<00:01:24.590> it<00:01:24.770> nice<00:01:24.890> and<00:01:24.950> shaded<00:01:25.550> there<00:01:26.000> under<00:01:26.210> a

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
to keep it nice and shaded there under a

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.340 
to keep it nice and shaded there under a
tree<00:01:26.600> but<00:01:26.870> I<00:01:26.900> just<00:01:27.020> want<00:01:27.170> to<00:01:27.230> make<00:01:27.320> sure

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
tree but I just want to make sure

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.070 
tree but I just want to make sure
there's<00:01:27.800> no<00:01:28.010> Sun<00:01:28.400> Ginn<00:01:28.780> beaming<00:01:29.780> on<00:01:29.900> them

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.080 
there's no Sun Ginn beaming on them

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.510 
there's no Sun Ginn beaming on them
because<00:01:30.230> they<00:01:30.470> were<00:01:30.500> panting<00:01:31.070> quite<00:01:31.310> a<00:01:31.340> bit

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
because they were panting quite a bit

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.990 
because they were panting quite a bit
earlier<00:01:32.350> and<00:01:33.350> we<00:01:33.500> don't<00:01:33.710> want<00:01:34.130> to<00:01:34.250> let<00:01:34.820> them

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
earlier and we don't want to let them

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.010 
earlier and we don't want to let them
have<00:01:35.210> a<00:01:35.240> heatstroke

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.289 

so<00:01:40.770> that's<00:01:41.070> a<00:01:41.280> few<00:01:41.670> things<00:01:41.909> we're<00:01:42.060> doing<00:01:42.149> to

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
so that's a few things we're doing to

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.700 
so that's a few things we're doing to
keep<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.659> chickens<00:01:43.020> cool<00:01:43.640> also<00:01:44.640> read<00:01:44.820> to<00:01:44.850> at

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
keep the chickens cool also read to at

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.850 
keep the chickens cool also read to at
where<00:01:46.710> they<00:01:46.829> do<00:01:47.220> a<00:01:47.250> dust<00:01:47.790> bath<00:01:48.649> where<00:01:49.649> it<00:01:49.770> would

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
where they do a dust bath where it would

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.859 
where they do a dust bath where it would
be<00:01:49.979> a<00:01:50.009> big<00:01:50.430> pile<00:01:50.670> of<00:01:50.700> dirt<00:01:51.180> and<00:01:51.210> they<00:01:51.509> roll

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
be a big pile of dirt and they roll

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.929 
be a big pile of dirt and they roll
around<00:01:51.990> in<00:01:52.380> it<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:52.799> where<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.250> dirt<00:01:53.610> is<00:01:53.729> real

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
around in it and where the dirt is real

00:01:53.939 --> 00:02:02.590 
around in it and where the dirt is real
cool<00:01:54.409> that's<00:01:55.409> next<00:01:55.860> on<00:01:56.039> my<00:01:56.100> list<00:01:56.189> to<00:01:56.520> do

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.240 

but<00:02:03.200> this<00:02:03.350> looks<00:02:03.560> like<00:02:03.710> it's<00:02:03.860> working<00:02:03.979> pretty

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
but this looks like it's working pretty

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:13.880 
but this looks like it's working pretty
good<00:02:04.369> they're<00:02:05.360> really<00:02:05.600> enjoying<00:02:05.720> this

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.430 

we<00:02:14.890> were<00:02:15.040> expecting<00:02:15.370> to<00:02:15.730> get<00:02:16.020> day-old<00:02:17.020> chicks

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
we were expecting to get day-old chicks

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.350 
we were expecting to get day-old chicks
but<00:02:17.800> these<00:02:17.980> are<00:02:18.160> actually<00:02:18.550> about<00:02:18.790> seven<00:02:19.120> weeks

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
but these are actually about seven weeks

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.800 
but these are actually about seven weeks
old<00:02:19.600> now<00:02:19.750> so<00:02:20.650> that's<00:02:21.550> why<00:02:21.760> we're<00:02:22.090> behind<00:02:22.480> on

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
old now so that's why we're behind on

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.660 
old now so that's why we're behind on
their<00:02:23.020> permanent<00:02:23.320> shelter<00:02:23.950> I<00:02:23.980> was<00:02:24.160> expecting

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
their permanent shelter I was expecting

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.000 
their permanent shelter I was expecting
to<00:02:24.850> have<00:02:25.570> a<00:02:25.630> little<00:02:25.900> baby<00:02:25.990> chicks<00:02:26.440> and<00:02:26.740> you

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
to have a little baby chicks and you

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.300 
to have a little baby chicks and you
know<00:02:27.220> keep<00:02:28.030> them<00:02:28.180> in<00:02:28.300> a<00:02:28.330> little<00:02:28.470> thing<00:02:29.470> so<00:02:30.190> they

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
know keep them in a little thing so they

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.610 
know keep them in a little thing so they
got<00:02:30.490> older<00:02:30.910> for<00:02:31.810> several<00:02:32.140> weeks<00:02:32.170> that<00:02:32.560> would

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
got older for several weeks that would

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.040 
got older for several weeks that would
gave<00:02:32.830> us<00:02:32.950> plenty<00:02:33.160> of<00:02:33.250> time<00:02:33.340> to<00:02:33.490> get<00:02:33.670> our

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
gave us plenty of time to get our

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.080 
gave us plenty of time to get our
