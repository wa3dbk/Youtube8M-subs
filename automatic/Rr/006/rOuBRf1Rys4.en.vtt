lasts my opponent I started to think why

this game and still after Knight F 24

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.560 
this game and still after Knight F 24
it's<00:03:23.100> very<00:03:23.400> complicated<00:03:23.940> and<00:03:24.180> interesting

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
it's very complicated and interesting

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.110 
it's very complicated and interesting
but<00:03:25.560> of<00:03:25.740> course<00:03:25.950> black<00:03:26.160> has<00:03:26.430> some<00:03:26.610> other<00:03:26.790> moves

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
but of course black has some other moves

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:32.510 
but of course black has some other moves

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
possible and here you can see that I am

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.860 
possible and here you can see that I am
thinking<00:03:36.990> again<00:03:37.860> about<00:03:38.070> Mahmoud<00:03:38.880> and<00:03:39.090> because

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
thinking again about Mahmoud and because

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.510 
thinking again about Mahmoud and because
of<00:03:39.990> course<00:03:40.230> I<00:03:40.350> couldn't<00:03:40.680> remember<00:03:40.830> all<00:03:41.250> the

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:41.520 
of course I couldn't remember all the

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.060 
of course I couldn't remember all the
lines<00:03:41.940> that<00:03:42.090> I<00:03:42.270> looked<00:03:42.510> at<00:03:42.630> home<00:03:42.900> but<00:03:43.560> the<00:03:43.860> most

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.070 
lines that I looked at home but the most

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:45.980 
lines that I looked at home but the most
important<00:03:44.670> thing<00:03:44.850> is<00:03:45.030> to<00:03:45.150> remember<00:03:45.390> the<00:03:45.600> main

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:45.990 
important thing is to remember the main

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:48.830 
important thing is to remember the main
ideas<00:03:46.620> of<00:03:46.770> the<00:03:46.830> position<00:03:47.370> and<00:03:47.580> here<00:03:48.060> that's

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
ideas of the position and here that's

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.190 
ideas of the position and here that's
how<00:03:49.260> I<00:03:49.290> could<00:03:50.190> recall<00:03:50.640> this<00:03:50.910> bishop<00:03:51.330> h4<00:03:51.960> move

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
how I could recall this bishop h4 move

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.600 
how I could recall this bishop h4 move
because<00:03:52.530> the<00:03:52.650> main<00:03:52.860> idea<00:03:53.220> of<00:03:53.280> the<00:03:53.430> position

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
because the main idea of the position

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:57.110 
because the main idea of the position
for<00:03:54.120> white<00:03:54.480> is<00:03:54.750> to<00:03:54.960> attack<00:03:55.320> the<00:03:55.490> black<00:03:56.490> points

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
for white is to attack the black points

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.570 
for white is to attack the black points
which<00:03:57.680> I'm<00:03:58.680> on<00:03:59.070> g7<00:03:59.520> on<00:03:59.790> f7<00:04:00.330> which<00:04:00.480> black<00:04:01.580> cannot

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580 
which I'm on g7 on f7 which black cannot

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.440 
which I'm on g7 on f7 which black cannot
protect<00:04:03.180> and<00:04:04.400> we<00:04:05.400> should<00:04:05.610> still<00:04:05.880> remember

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
protect and we should still remember

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:09.260 
protect and we should still remember
that<00:04:06.480> I<00:04:06.870> sacrificed<00:04:07.680> the<00:04:08.160> piece<00:04:08.430> for<00:04:08.700> just<00:04:09.000> one

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:09.270 
that I sacrificed the piece for just one

that I sacrificed the piece for just one
poll<00:04:09.600> and<00:04:09.810> I'm<00:04:10.230> trying<00:04:10.560> to<00:04:10.709> use<00:04:10.830> the<00:04:11.040> fact<00:04:11.340> that

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:30.540 
but that's not as easy as it sounds so

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:33.500 
but that's not as easy as it sounds so
here<00:04:31.170> my<00:04:31.440> opponent<00:04:31.860> spent<00:04:32.190> quiet<00:04:32.610> quite<00:04:33.120> a<00:04:33.150> few

I'm leading in time and after queen

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:50.750

takes<00:05:48.840> his<00:05:49.110> six<00:05:49.380> the<00:05:49.560> last<00:05:49.590> my<00:05:49.890> first<00:05:50.160> black

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:52.500 
I'm also have a very big advantage

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:58.250 
I'm also have a very big advantage
because<00:05:53.100> after<00:05:53.820> Queen<00:05:54.090> takes<00:05:54.330> g7<00:05:55.020> rook<00:05:55.890> g8<00:05:57.260> his

00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:58.260 
because after Queen takes g7 rook g8 his

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.550 
because after Queen takes g7 rook g8 his
pawn<00:05:58.590> on<00:05:58.740> f7<00:05:59.100> is<00:05:59.370> hanging<00:05:59.880> and<00:06:00.290> after<00:06:01.290> some

pawn on f7 is hanging and after some

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:04.820 
pawn on f7 is hanging and after some
thought<00:06:01.920> I<00:06:02.280> took<00:06:02.550> the<00:06:02.940> pawn<00:06:03.210> and<00:06:03.480> here<00:06:04.440> he

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:04.830 
thought I took the pawn and here he

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:08.000 
thought I took the pawn and here he
played<00:06:05.070> night<00:06:05.340> c2<00:06:05.850> for<00:06:06.240> and<00:06:06.510> probably<00:06:07.440> before

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:08.010 
played night c2 for and probably before

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:11.420 
played night c2 for and probably before
playing<00:06:08.580> Queen<00:06:09.000> takes<00:06:09.270> c6<00:06:10.170> my<00:06:10.920> opponent

playing Queen takes c6 my opponent

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:14.060 
playing Queen takes c6 my opponent
missed<00:06:11.760> my<00:06:12.360> next<00:06:12.690> move<00:06:12.900> here<00:06:13.290> which<00:06:13.500> is<00:06:13.680> Bishop

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:14.070 
missed my next move here which is Bishop

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:18.560 
missed my next move here which is Bishop
takes<00:06:14.340> f6<00:06:14.850> and<00:06:15.120> suddenly<00:06:16.580> he<00:06:17.580> realized<00:06:18.180> that

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:18.570 
takes f6 and suddenly he realized that

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:22.040 
takes f6 and suddenly he realized that
here<00:06:19.470> his<00:06:20.010> rook<00:06:20.340> on<00:06:20.520> g8<00:06:20.880> is<00:06:21.030> not<00:06:21.240> protected<00:06:21.840> if

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:22.050 
here his rook on g8 is not protected if

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:24.860 
here his rook on g8 is not protected if
he<00:06:22.290> takes<00:06:22.590> with<00:06:22.830> the<00:06:22.980> night<00:06:23.190> I<00:06:23.520> will<00:06:24.210> take<00:06:24.570> the

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:24.870

bishop<00:06:25.050> on<00:06:25.410> e7<00:06:25.800> Queen<00:06:26.250> takes<00:06:26.490> b7<00:06:27.210> checkmate

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:27.720 
bishop on e7 Queen takes b7 checkmate

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:29.510 
bishop on e7 Queen takes b7 checkmate
that's<00:06:28.080> probably<00:06:28.350> what<00:06:28.680> my<00:06:28.860> opponent<00:06:29.280> missed

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:29.520 
that's probably what my opponent missed

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:32.570 
that's probably what my opponent missed
and<00:06:30.230> he's<00:06:31.230> in<00:06:31.350> a<00:06:31.410> very<00:06:31.560> big<00:06:31.860> trouble<00:06:32.310> here

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:32.580 
and he's in a very big trouble here

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:37.610 
and he's in a very big trouble here
