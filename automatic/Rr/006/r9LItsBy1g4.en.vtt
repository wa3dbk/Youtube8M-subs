we have now the classic experiment that

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:20.349 
we have now the classic experiment that
we<00:00:17.869> do<00:00:18.019> during<00:00:18.259> our<00:00:18.439> super<00:00:19.339> splatter<00:00:19.730> science

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:20.359 
we do during our super splatter science

we do during our super splatter science
a<00:00:20.539> summer<00:00:20.810> camp<00:00:21.109> is<00:00:21.589> okay<00:00:21.829> that<00:00:22.039> three<00:00:22.279> times

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:22.460 
a summer camp is okay that three times

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.029 
a summer camp is okay that three times
fast<00:00:22.640> place<00:00:23.029> super<00:00:23.390> spike<00:00:23.810> ant<00:00:24.050> out<00:00:24.710> of<00:00:24.859> cancer

but<00:00:25.310> well<00:00:25.640> we<00:00:25.730> can<00:00:25.970> do<00:00:26.179> some<00:00:26.689> really<00:00:26.929> cool

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:27.109 
but well we can do some really cool

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:29.139 
but well we can do some really cool
crazy<00:00:27.619> science<00:00:28.009> let's<00:00:28.130> do<00:00:28.399> it<00:00:28.609> what<00:00:28.939> I<00:00:28.970> had

00:00:29.139 --> 00:00:29.149 
crazy science let's do it what I had

00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:30.939 
crazy science let's do it what I had
this<00:00:29.300> hydrogen<00:00:29.810> peroxide<00:00:30.319> okay<00:00:30.589> it's<00:00:30.739> not<00:00:30.890> the

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:30.949 
this hydrogen peroxide okay it's not the

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:32.970 
this hydrogen peroxide okay it's not the
stuff<00:00:31.249> you<00:00:31.339> have<00:00:31.489> at<00:00:31.609> home<00:00:31.729> this<00:00:31.880> is<00:00:31.939> 35%

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:32.980 
stuff you have at home this is 35%

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.860 
stuff you have at home this is 35%
concentration<00:00:33.980> you<00:00:34.280> have<00:00:34.309> 3%<00:00:34.850> at<00:00:35.120> home<00:00:35.269> okay

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:35.870 
concentration you have 3% at home okay

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:37.720 
concentration you have 3% at home okay
more<00:00:36.079> than<00:00:36.230> 10<00:00:36.410> times<00:00:36.530> more<00:00:36.980> concentrated<00:00:37.219> I

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:37.730 
more than 10 times more concentrated I

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:38.979 
more than 10 times more concentrated I
definitely<00:00:38.359> don't<00:00:38.420> wanna<00:00:38.600> get<00:00:38.690> it<00:00:38.809> on<00:00:38.899> our

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:38.989 
definitely don't wanna get it on our

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:40.119 
definitely don't wanna get it on our
hands<00:00:39.170> that's<00:00:39.320> why<00:00:39.500> I<00:00:39.530> have<00:00:39.679> some<00:00:39.890> done<00:00:40.039> in

00:00:40.119 --> 00:00:40.129 
hands that's why I have some done in

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:42.279 
hands that's why I have some done in
this<00:00:40.219> container<00:00:40.519> all<00:00:40.820> right<00:00:41.030> some<00:00:41.809> food

00:00:42.279 --> 00:00:42.289 
this container all right some food

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:44.619 
this container all right some food
coloring<00:00:42.710> probably<00:00:43.280> a<00:00:43.340> lifetime<00:00:43.879> supply<00:00:44.149> of

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:44.629 
coloring probably a lifetime supply of

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:46.060 
coloring probably a lifetime supply of
green<00:00:44.989> food<00:00:45.199> coloring<00:00:45.559> go<00:00:45.649> ahead<00:00:45.800> and<00:00:45.890> dump

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 
green food coloring go ahead and dump

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.700 
green food coloring go ahead and dump
that<00:00:46.190> one<00:00:46.519> okay<00:00:47.359> we<00:00:48.050> want<00:00:48.199> this<00:00:48.289> stuff<00:00:48.379> to<00:00:48.530> be

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
that one okay we want this stuff to be

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.290 
that one okay we want this stuff to be
very<00:00:49.100> very<00:00:49.280> bright<00:00:49.519> when<00:00:49.670> we<00:00:49.760> do<00:00:49.879> it<00:00:50.000> ya<00:00:50.210> know

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
very very bright when we do it ya know

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.720 
very very bright when we do it ya know
the<00:00:50.750> hydrogen<00:00:51.170> peroxide<00:00:51.320> is<00:00:51.739> actually<00:00:52.039> h2o<00:00:52.550> -

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 
the hydrogen peroxide is actually h2o -

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:54.939 
the hydrogen peroxide is actually h2o -
sounds<00:00:53.539> a<00:00:53.570> lot<00:00:53.690> like<00:00:53.749> water<00:00:54.109> right<00:00:54.649> that<00:00:54.829> it

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:54.949 
sounds a lot like water right that it

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:56.979 
sounds a lot like water right that it
does<00:00:55.070> has<00:00:55.579> an<00:00:55.699> extra<00:00:55.940> oxygen<00:00:56.059> molecule<00:00:56.719> what

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
does has an extra oxygen molecule what

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:58.090 
does has an extra oxygen molecule what
we<00:00:57.109> are<00:00:57.260> gonna<00:00:57.350> do<00:00:57.559> is<00:00:57.710> we<00:00:57.829> are<00:00:57.920> gonna<00:00:57.980> release

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
we are gonna do is we are gonna release

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.149 
we are gonna do is we are gonna release
that<00:00:58.699> extra<00:00:58.969> oxygen<00:00:58.999> atom<00:00:59.899> create<00:01:00.859> a<00:01:00.890> lot<00:01:01.070> of

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:01.159 
that extra oxygen atom create a lot of

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:03.579 
that extra oxygen atom create a lot of
oxygen<00:01:01.519> gas<00:01:01.670> now<00:01:02.449> we<00:01:02.809> want<00:01:02.989> to<00:01:03.079> capture<00:01:03.379> that

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:03.589 
oxygen gas now we want to capture that

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:05.050 
oxygen gas now we want to capture that
in<00:01:03.829> some<00:01:03.980> soap<00:01:04.190> can<00:01:04.370> you<00:01:04.460> just<00:01:04.670> add<00:01:04.850> a<00:01:04.880> whole

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 
can see but if we add a catalyst to this

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.500 
can see but if we add a catalyst to this
some<00:01:30.830> potassium<00:01:31.280> iodide<00:01:31.610> we<00:01:32.090> are<00:01:32.210> going<00:01:32.450> to

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:32.510 
some potassium iodide we are going to

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:33.880 
some potassium iodide we are going to
very<00:01:32.810> very<00:01:32.870> quickly<00:01:33.230> break<00:01:33.590> down<00:01:33.770> that

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
very very quickly break down that

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.500 
very very quickly break down that
hydrogen<00:01:34.160> peroxide<00:01:34.340> we're<00:01:35.210> gonna<00:01:35.300> get<00:01:35.450> a

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:35.510 
hydrogen peroxide we're gonna get a

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:37.780 
hydrogen peroxide we're gonna get a
ginormous<00:01:36.380> well<00:01:36.860> let's<00:01:37.070> just<00:01:37.220> do<00:01:37.340> it<00:01:37.460> and<00:01:37.610> find

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:37.790 
ginormous well let's just do it and find

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:39.550 
ginormous well let's just do it and find
out<00:01:37.940> okay<00:01:38.210> I'm<00:01:38.870> not<00:01:38.990> gonna<00:01:39.110> tell<00:01:39.320> you<00:01:39.410> what's

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
out okay I'm not gonna tell you what's

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.950 
out okay I'm not gonna tell you what's
gonna<00:01:39.710> go<00:01:40.100> back<00:01:40.340> no<00:01:40.850> I<00:01:40.880> think<00:01:41.030> it'd<00:01:41.240> be<00:01:41.270> okay<00:01:41.390> so

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
gonna go back no I think it'd be okay so

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.450 
gonna go back no I think it'd be okay so
we<00:01:42.440> give<00:01:42.590> you<00:01:42.620> a<00:01:42.680> little<00:01:42.770> countdown<00:01:43.100> just<00:01:43.340> go

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
we give you a little countdown just go

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.280 
we give you a little countdown just go
ahead<00:01:43.550> and<00:01:43.700> pour<00:01:43.880> that<00:01:44.030> in<00:01:44.210> so<00:01:44.660> get<00:01:44.780> to<00:01:44.840> a<00:01:44.930> three

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290 
ahead and pour that in so get to a three

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.340 
ahead and pour that in so get to a three
to<00:01:45.590> one<00:01:45.950> dump<00:01:46.430> it<00:01:46.580> in<00:01:46.790> yep<00:01:47.090> all<00:01:47.360> at<00:01:47.780> once<00:01:47.960> what

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
to one dump it in yep all at once what

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:49.720 
to one dump it in yep all at once what
that's<00:01:48.500> gonna<00:01:48.620> do<00:01:48.800> is<00:01:48.920> break<00:01:49.250> down<00:01:49.550> the

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:49.730 
that's gonna do is break down the

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:51.310 
that's gonna do is break down the
hydrogen<00:01:50.060> peroxide<00:01:50.210> inside<00:01:50.900> there<00:01:51.110> and<00:01:51.200> we're

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
hydrogen peroxide inside there and we're

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:52.870 
hydrogen peroxide inside there and we're
gonna<00:01:51.380> start<00:01:51.770> to<00:01:51.890> generate<00:01:52.310> a<00:01:52.340> lot<00:01:52.580> of<00:01:52.700> oxygen

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
gonna start to generate a lot of oxygen

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.300 
gonna start to generate a lot of oxygen
gas<00:01:53.300> the<00:01:53.960> soap<00:01:54.260> that<00:01:54.290> you<00:01:54.500> put<00:01:54.740> inside<00:01:54.890> there

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
gas the soap that you put inside there

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.230 
gas the soap that you put inside there
is<00:01:55.550> gonna<00:01:55.790> help<00:01:56.000> capture<00:01:56.390> that<00:01:57.200> gas<00:01:57.260> and<00:01:58.240> it's

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
is gonna help capture that gas and it's

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.030 
is gonna help capture that gas and it's
a<00:01:59.300> look<00:01:59.420> hole<00:01:59.600> down<00:01:59.810> here<00:01:59.840> today<00:02:00.080> so<00:02:00.230> most

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
a look hole down here today so most

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.650 
a look hole down here today so most
chemical<00:02:01.460> reactions<00:02:01.490> slow<00:02:02.150> down<00:02:02.420> when<00:02:02.600> the

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:02.660 
chemical reactions slow down when the

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.390 
chemical reactions slow down when the
temperature<00:02:03.050> is<00:02:03.170> called<00:02:03.350> are<00:02:03.470> you<00:02:03.530> true<00:02:03.860> but

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:04.400 
temperature is called are you true but

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.950 
temperature is called are you true but
as<00:02:04.580> this<00:02:04.730> begins<00:02:04.970> to<00:02:05.360> come<00:02:05.600> out<00:02:05.750> we're<00:02:05.900> gonna

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
as this begins to come out we're gonna

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.850 
as this begins to come out we're gonna
generate<00:02:06.500> a<00:02:06.820> ginormous<00:02:07.820> bundle<00:02:08.509> of<00:02:08.750> foam<00:02:09.289> look

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
generate a ginormous bundle of foam look

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:10.840 
generate a ginormous bundle of foam look
at<00:02:10.100> that

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
at that

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:12.070 
at that
kind<00:02:10.970> of<00:02:11.000> looks<00:02:11.270> like<00:02:11.360> a<00:02:11.510> tube<00:02:11.870> of<00:02:11.900> toothpaste

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
kind of looks like a tube of toothpaste

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.750 
kind of looks like a tube of toothpaste
being<00:02:12.860> squashed<00:02:13.160> and<00:02:13.460> that's<00:02:13.580> where<00:02:13.700> the

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
being squashed and that's where the

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.630 
being squashed and that's where the
elephant's<00:02:14.390> toothpaste<00:02:14.570> comes<00:02:15.050> from<00:02:15.290> now<00:02:15.800> you

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
elephant's toothpaste comes from now you

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.360 
elephant's toothpaste comes from now you
had<00:02:16.850> a<00:02:16.880> flat<00:02:17.600> and<00:02:18.350> graduated<00:02:18.800> cylinder<00:02:19.190> there

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
had a flat and graduated cylinder there

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:20.770 
had a flat and graduated cylinder there
okay<00:02:19.640> so<00:02:19.700> you<00:02:19.880> get<00:02:20.060> this<00:02:20.180> kind<00:02:20.420> of<00:02:20.450> stuff<00:02:20.660> that

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
okay so you get this kind of stuff that

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.450 
okay so you get this kind of stuff that
comes<00:02:20.930> out<00:02:21.080> and<00:02:21.230> flows<00:02:21.470> over<00:02:21.830> we're<00:02:22.160> gonna<00:02:22.250> see

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:22.460 
comes out and flows over we're gonna see

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:23.830 
comes out and flows over we're gonna see
what<00:02:22.580> happens<00:02:22.670> if<00:02:22.910> we<00:02:22.970> do<00:02:23.060> the<00:02:23.180> same<00:02:23.390> reaction

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
what happens if we do the same reaction

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:24.730 
what happens if we do the same reaction
you<00:02:24.080> don't<00:02:24.200> want<00:02:24.320> to<00:02:24.380> touch<00:02:24.530> it<00:02:24.560> because

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
you don't want to touch it because

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.110 
you don't want to touch it because
that's<00:02:25.010> and<00:02:25.250> really<00:02:25.520> do<00:02:25.640> want<00:02:25.820> to<00:02:25.850> touch<00:02:26.000> on

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
that's and really do want to touch on

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.970 
that's and really do want to touch on
some<00:02:26.330> steam<00:02:26.660> coming<00:02:26.690> off<00:02:27.080> you<00:02:27.290> see<00:02:27.470> that<00:02:27.620> is<00:02:27.770> an

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
some steam coming off you see that is an

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.520 
some steam coming off you see that is an
exothermic<00:02:28.600> it'll<00:02:29.600> burn<00:02:29.720> it<00:02:30.200> will<00:02:30.350> actually

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
exothermic it'll burn it will actually

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.290 
exothermic it'll burn it will actually
be<00:02:31.010> a<00:02:31.040> little<00:02:31.280> bit<00:02:31.520> warm<00:02:31.760> okay<00:02:32.030> I<00:02:32.150> definitely

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
be a little bit warm okay I definitely

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.540 
be a little bit warm okay I definitely
don't<00:02:32.570> want<00:02:32.750> to<00:02:32.810> touch<00:02:32.930> it<00:02:32.960> and<00:02:33.370> you<00:02:34.370> might

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
don't want to touch it and you might

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.520 
don't want to touch it and you might
want<00:02:34.760> to<00:02:34.820> remove<00:02:35.150> your<00:02:35.390> phone<00:02:35.750> from<00:02:36.020> the<00:02:36.170> table

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
want to remove your phone from the table

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.170 
want to remove your phone from the table
there<00:02:36.680> I'm<00:02:37.040> gonna<00:02:37.250> do<00:02:37.340> the<00:02:37.460> same<00:02:37.490> sort<00:02:38.090> of

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
there I'm gonna do the same sort of

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.210 
there I'm gonna do the same sort of
thing<00:02:38.360> you<00:02:38.690> did<00:02:38.900> okay<00:02:39.380> but<00:02:39.740> again<00:02:39.920> in<00:02:40.100> the

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
thing you did okay but again in the

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:41.500 
thing you did okay but again in the
flask<00:02:40.430> so<00:02:40.670> we're<00:02:40.850> gonna<00:02:40.940> generate<00:02:41.330> some

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
flask so we're gonna generate some

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:42.940 
flask so we're gonna generate some
pressure<00:02:41.750> here<00:02:41.870> I'm<00:02:42.230> gonna<00:02:42.590> see<00:02:42.740> what<00:02:42.860> happens

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
pressure here I'm gonna see what happens

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.300 
pressure here I'm gonna see what happens
so<00:02:43.220> a<00:02:43.250> poured<00:02:43.550> Ian<00:02:43.700> and<00:02:44.590> as<00:02:45.590> that<00:02:45.830> reaction

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
so a poured Ian and as that reaction

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.530 
so a poured Ian and as that reaction
proceeds<00:02:46.670> we're<00:02:47.360> gonna<00:02:47.480> get<00:02:48.970> that<00:02:49.970> scared<00:02:50.360> me

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
proceeds we're gonna get that scared me

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.830 
proceeds we're gonna get that scared me
today

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
today

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.230 
today
nice<00:02:51.050> little<00:02:51.290> squirting<00:02:51.980> of<00:02:52.190> oxygen<00:02:52.790> gas<00:02:52.970> and

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:53.240 
nice little squirting of oxygen gas and

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.000 
nice little squirting of oxygen gas and
look<00:02:53.780> at<00:02:53.870> the<00:02:53.960> steam<00:02:54.200> coming<00:02:54.230> off<00:02:54.620> it<00:02:54.800> I<00:02:54.860> can

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
look at the steam coming off it I can

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:56.290 
look at the steam coming off it I can
stick<00:02:55.160> your<00:02:55.190> hands<00:02:55.460> of<00:02:55.640> it<00:02:55.730> we<00:02:56.060> can<00:02:56.180> actually

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300 
stick your hands of it we can actually

good it is really really warm so this is
one<00:03:01.730> of<00:03:01.820> the<00:03:01.910> things<00:03:02.120> that<00:03:02.360> our<00:03:02.540> campers<00:03:02.960> will

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
one of the things that our campers will

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:04.540 
one of the things that our campers will
do<00:03:03.260> in<00:03:03.530> super<00:03:03.920> spider<00:03:04.100> summer<00:03:04.400> science

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
do in super spider summer science

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:05.980 
do in super spider summer science
they'll<00:03:04.730> do<00:03:04.790> a<00:03:04.850> small<00:03:05.180> version<00:03:05.390> and<00:03:05.750> then

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:05.990 
they'll do a small version and then

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:07.660 
they'll do a small version and then
we'll<00:03:06.080> do<00:03:06.170> the<00:03:06.200> giant<00:03:06.530> version<00:03:06.950> outside<00:03:07.280> and

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
we'll do the giant version outside and

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:08.830 
we'll do the giant version outside and
what's<00:03:07.850> cool<00:03:08.060> is<00:03:08.090> I<00:03:08.210> can<00:03:08.360> talk<00:03:08.540> about<00:03:08.660> the

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
what's cool is I can talk about the

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.450 
what's cool is I can talk about the
chemistry<00:03:09.140> behind<00:03:09.380> it<00:03:09.740> and<00:03:09.890> have<00:03:10.220> a<00:03:10.250> little

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:10.460 
chemistry behind it and have a little

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:12.520 
chemistry behind it and have a little
fun<00:03:10.700> as<00:03:10.850> well<00:03:11.090> what<00:03:11.390> is<00:03:11.570> my<00:03:11.720> favorite<00:03:12.140> part<00:03:12.320> I

fun as well what is my favorite part I
do<00:03:12.590> love<00:03:13.130> the<00:03:13.310> chemistry<00:03:13.760> behind<00:03:13.910> all<00:03:14.300> of<00:03:14.330> this

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:14.570 
do love the chemistry behind all of this

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:16.360 
do love the chemistry behind all of this
the<00:03:14.900> education<00:03:15.680> that<00:03:15.800> you<00:03:15.950> get<00:03:16.160> at<00:03:16.280> the

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
the education that you get at the

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.880 
the education that you get at the
imagine<00:03:16.760> station<00:03:17.210> is<00:03:17.450> um<00:03:17.720> you<00:03:18.410> you<00:03:18.650> can't

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
imagine station is um you you can't

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:20.740 
imagine station is um you you can't
match<00:03:19.130> that<00:03:19.160> almost<00:03:19.760> anywhere<00:03:20.090> I<00:03:20.150> happened<00:03:20.600> I

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
match that almost anywhere I happened I

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.090 
match that almost anywhere I happened I
can't<00:03:21.110> get<00:03:21.260> this<00:03:21.350> by<00:03:21.500> reading<00:03:21.650> a<00:03:21.830> book<00:03:21.950> or

watching Discovery Channel anything like

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.660 
watching Discovery Channel anything like
that<00:03:23.720> you<00:03:24.200> actually<00:03:24.680> have<00:03:24.830> to<00:03:24.950> physically<00:03:25.370> do

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
that you actually have to physically do

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.460 
that you actually have to physically do
it<00:03:25.700> when<00:03:26.120> you<00:03:26.210> feel<00:03:26.240> the<00:03:26.690> heat<00:03:26.900> coming<00:03:27.200> off<00:03:27.290> an

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
it when you feel the heat coming off an

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:28.900 
it when you feel the heat coming off an
exothermic<00:03:27.740> reaction<00:03:28.010> like<00:03:28.460> that<00:03:28.640> when<00:03:28.820> you

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910 
exothermic reaction like that when you

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:30.970 
exothermic reaction like that when you
see<00:03:29.120> the<00:03:29.240> oxygen<00:03:29.570> generated<00:03:30.200> it's<00:03:30.680> something

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
see the oxygen generated it's something

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.530 
see the oxygen generated it's something
you're<00:03:31.100> gonna<00:03:31.250> remember<00:03:31.460> especially<00:03:32.420> when
