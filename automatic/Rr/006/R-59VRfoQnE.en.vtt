00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.980
 when the heart of the grinch increases by 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.330
 three sizes I are always rumors 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.430
 tears justified the thickening 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.779
 of cardiac walls or cardiomyopathy 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.890
 hypertrophic can lead to one 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.890
 congestive heart failure 

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:27.660
 la la la la la 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:29.790
 you don't like this fairy tale jokes at 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.960
 otherwise I find that in many points of 

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:33.300
 given that of the green is a 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.800
 extremely appealing character e 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.390
 I was completely identified with 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.769
 him until he collapsed under the 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.039
 conventions returning gifts e 

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:43.429
 not saving him from Christmas 

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:43.429
 I never expected 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.499
 hi sheldon you make it the tree of 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.749
 Christmas 

00:00:46.499 --> 00:00:53.039
 no because we do not celebrate the old 

00:00:48.749 --> 00:00:55.140
 pagan festival of Saturnalia Saturnalia 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.429
 veneto children the moment of the special 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.569
 is finally sheldon 's Christmas 

00:00:56.429 --> 00:01:02.370
 arrived in the pre-Christian era when 

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:04.199
 the winter solstice approached and 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.820
 the plants died the pagans wore 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.740
 always green branches in homes like 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.210
 auspicious magic act intended to 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.260
 protect the vital absences of the 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.340
 plants until spring 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.770
 this custom was later 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.850
 adopted by northern Europeans and finally 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.770
 become the so-called Christmas tree 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:24.060
 it is this dear charlie brown a and fear 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.710
 true essence of the mother ok well thanks 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.420
 for the lesson but I took why 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.940
 leonard some nonsense then the 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.640
 will put under my expectation you have me 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:36.030
 bought a gift because you made one 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.640
 I don't know why it is like that 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.410
 Christmas and I know you think you are 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.480
 generous but the foundation of an exchange 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:44.340
 of gifts is reciprocity you are not me 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.399
 giving a gift you're actually giving me 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.750
 a commitment 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:50.429
 Don't get down Penny is a classic 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:54.409
 rookie mistake to my first year 

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:56.460
 caco sheldon shouted at me for 86 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:58.530
 darling does nothing you don't have to give me 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.240
 nothing in the field but of course I have to 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.860
 basis of this custom that I should now 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.329
 go out and look for a gift of value e 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.950
 proportionate and that represents it 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.420
 same perceived level of friendship 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.269
 symbolized by the gift you have 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:12.269
 done to me it does not surprise me that the rate 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:13.890
 of suicides goes from the stars to Christmas 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:15.900
 forget it I won't give you any gifts 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.420
 no it's too late i've already seen the sticker 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.459
 with written chosen 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.440
 the die is taken the fate is now 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:30.599
 was written annibale crossed the 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:32.970
 alpi a space when there is no don mi 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:34.769
 I'm really really sorry tonon no me 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.540
 I am sought after by myself being one 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:39.569
 so dear important part of yours 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:42.000
 life accompanies themes at the center 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:43.470
 commercial hundred have not seen here 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.720
 he said because I did n't buy it 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.700
 because I don't ask the whole institution 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.590
 of exchange of gifts does not have any 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.389
 meaning to vote we say that I go out and 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.220
 spend $ 50 for your gift 

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:54.660
 it would be a laborious activity because 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.700
 I should imagine what you need 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.590
 while you are already what you need you can 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.139
 simplify it by giving you 50 bucks 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.940
 directly and you could give me 50 to 

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:04.739
 my birthday and so on until one of 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:10.530
 we will die leaving the other richer 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:14.250
 of $ 50 15 question is it worth it 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.930
 I told you I'm a well saldana 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.950
 his friend and friends exchange gods 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.450
 presents 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.030
 I accept the premise but I reject the 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.740
 conclusion 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.530
 i have an idea try to tell him it's one 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:30.450
 non-optional social convention and what 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:33.480
 they just do it and sheldon is one 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:36.290
 non-optional social convention or 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.290
 OK then 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:43.190
 they sell it with the manual and the shardans 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.080
 you made the Christmas tree we were 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:47.000
 on the front line 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.530
 there was a decorated tree every year 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.210
 the manger was a Santa Claus 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:52.100
 inflatable in the garden with stock of 

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:53.630
 renders in plastic 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.370
 we also put out so many of them 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:57.610
 flashing lights to cause attacks 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:59.960
 apoplectic disease in the whole neighborhood 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:02.360
 I think I guess you don't want to 

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:03.650
 help him great intuition though if 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.270
 love to decorate that 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.910
 potential crystal hell in mine 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:11.209
 salon officially ask her to come 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:12.800
 added this what is not 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:16.760
 recognizes 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:18.950
 is a mini bust in the evening isaac newton no 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.810
 but certainly a true symbol of Christmas so much 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:22.460
 to clear up pennies and much more 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:26.030
 symbol of this whatever you have 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:27.770
 already prepared here it is based on the 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:30.740
 Julian calendar and Isaac Newton is 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:32.690
 born December 25, 1642 while true 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:34.520
 jesus birth took place in the summer the 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:35.870
 his birthday has been moved so by 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.040
 coincide with the pagan festival in the 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.390
 which the solstice was celebrated 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:41.210
 in winter lighting fires e 

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:43.070
 killing coffee that incidentally looks like 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:46.190
 more fun than 12 hours in church with 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:49.330
 my mother a fruit cake and good 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:49.330
 tonal to everyone
