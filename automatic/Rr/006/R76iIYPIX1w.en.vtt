00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:30.260 
and this is an open D tuning mean that's

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.479

a<00:00:30.620> B<00:00:31.070> a<00:00:31.340> g-sharp<00:00:32.240> ve<00:00:32.980> just<00:00:33.980> sounds<00:00:34.190> like<00:00:34.250> it's

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:34.489 
a B a g-sharp ve just sounds like it's

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:40.690 
a B a g-sharp ve just sounds like it's
ecord<00:00:35.060> but<00:00:35.300> I<00:00:35.480> can<00:00:35.720> use<00:00:35.840> a<00:00:35.870> slider<00:00:39.460> she<00:00:40.460> keeps

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:40.700 
ecord but I can use a slider she keeps

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.950 
ecord but I can use a slider she keeps
it<00:00:40.820> very<00:00:40.850> simple

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:43.960 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.410 

and<00:00:44.050> then<00:00:44.230> I<00:00:44.559> start<00:00:45.430> off<00:00:45.579> just<00:00:45.879> very<00:00:46.059> simple

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:46.420
