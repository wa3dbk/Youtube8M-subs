getting<00:01:07.979> made<00:01:08.310> I<00:01:08.549> know<00:01:09.240> that<00:01:09.600> there<00:01:09.780> was

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
getting made I know that there was

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.289

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
another variant of harry potter i think

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.990 
another variant of harry potter i think
it<00:01:12.360> was<00:01:12.420> with<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.770> sorting<00:01:13.770> hat<00:01:13.799> that<00:01:14.250> got<00:01:14.880> the

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
it was with the sorting hat that got the

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.670 
it was with the sorting hat that got the
knicks<00:01:16.009> but<00:01:17.009> there<00:01:17.340> should<00:01:17.640> be<00:01:17.850> continuous

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
knicks but there should be continuous

lines<00:01:19.680> of<00:01:19.890> these<00:01:20.040> pops<00:01:20.310> coming<00:01:20.640> out<00:01:21.170> hopefully

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
lines of these pops coming out hopefully

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.050 
lines of these pops coming out hopefully
i<00:01:22.500> mean<00:01:22.740> i<00:01:22.770> think<00:01:22.920> all<00:01:23.250> these<00:01:23.400> are<00:01:23.640> based<00:01:23.820> off

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
i mean i think all these are based off

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.080 
i mean i think all these are based off
of<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.570> Sorcerer's<00:01:25.229> Stone<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.590> first<00:01:26.090> book

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
of the Sorcerer's Stone the first book

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.960 
of the Sorcerer's Stone the first book
first<00:01:27.689> movie<00:01:28.229> and<00:01:28.439> I<00:01:28.979> think<00:01:29.189> as<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.490> pop<00:01:29.670> lines

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
first movie and I think as the pop lines

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.600 
first movie and I think as the pop lines
progress<00:01:30.390> Harry<00:01:30.990> will<00:01:31.259> obviously<00:01:31.590> get<00:01:32.549> the

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
progress Harry will obviously get the

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.899 
progress Harry will obviously get the
older<00:01:33.030> variations<00:01:33.630> until<00:01:33.960> we<00:01:34.140> get<00:01:34.409> to<00:01:34.909> the

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
older variations until we get to the

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.649 
older variations until we get to the
last<00:01:36.689> book<00:01:37.049> last<00:01:37.590> movie<00:01:37.979> so<00:01:38.670> take<00:01:39.150> a<00:01:39.180> look<00:01:39.360> here
