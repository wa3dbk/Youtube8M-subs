 that indicator 

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:24.569
 the cell phone and the young

 keep a dollar is like we send to society 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.170
 and sometimes called to say as a companion because if we start stuck 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:36.670
 to the 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.640
 this technology has helped to transform the comics between 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:41.530
 people 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.640
 the people who use the internet and on social networks if this time 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.190
 so stuck a cell 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.090
 even sometimes we pretend that several entities we win eat well 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.290
 being born homework and you see that music no longer 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.290
 there are some examples 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.049
 great demand is also spoken of that level pressing 

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:03.479
 plus capacity 

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:06.430
 internet games good a lot of things 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:07.390
 and head 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.630
 for these reasons they are distracting and in schools like that does not allow us 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.260
 a lot but good 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.480
 sometimes he can tell us to hurt even though we never want to see him 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.890
 ametic trends the expert explains these lenses appliances emit radiation 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.150
 electromagnetic that can damage 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.180
 with affecting 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.540
 this shelter was added the master portal in my childhood the optic nerve epp and many 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.310
 more things but good 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.650
 because they do not give it away so important in young people 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.700
 since we were born in the cell phone and choose communication the same idepa

 invitation to short pieces from luismi copextel to chávez 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.810
 those of us who were born in the 90s have been created for cell phones 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.050
 from our earliest childhood 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.570
 On the other hand, the parents complain sometimes because we are writing because 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.100
 nothing we spent stuck on the phone keys sending messages to everything 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.430
 world 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:58.340
 but nevertheless 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.689
 for dads of some times it would not be 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.780
 They need to know where we are with who we are or things like that 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.870
 In fi cell phone has its advantages and disadvantages you just have to know 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:10.310
 use it without clarifying because as they say 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.899
 there is also a year 

00:02:12.899 --> 00:02:15.899
 alex ferguson 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:20.889
 obama is out we went to interview our colleagues who do have 

00:02:20.889 --> 00:02:22.049
 cellular and what 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:25.049
 In total the results are rising and are 

00:02:26.139 --> 00:02:29.299
 yes because it facilitates communication with others 

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:33.340
 yes yes we believe in the importance of having cell phones that could not maintain 

00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:36.339
 communicated with my relatives and my friends 

00:02:37.719 --> 00:02:40.719
 following the principle of augmented reality very 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:43.090
 its important part since 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.399
 I must communicate with anyone 

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:48.959
 yes because when I have a measured cheek communicate with my parents 

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:54.799
 If I have to talk and it is very important to communicate with my family 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:57.579
 i at this point 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:01.150
 if they decide to do diversity to communicate with my friends and 

00:03:01.839 --> 00:03:04.569
 talk to anyone 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:07.859
 the socialist party that have descended until the previous day 

00:03:11.869 --> 00:03:12.790
 after opening 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.790
 and you to use your cell phone 

00:03:16.469 --> 00:03:17.650
 on another note 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.910
 how can we remember that in the past the government has implemented new 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.970
 sanctions in the ecological aspect to talk about it is my partner 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:26.169
 yasmin and jimena 

00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:29.169
 forward companions 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:32.279
 greece is serious 

00:03:32.279 --> 00:03:36.419
 fiji mine and we're in the campaign yes men she started talking about the 

00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:39.889
 application of the law of the entity 

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:42.209
 this law has been drawn up ten years ago 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:45.209
 remained record in mind applied last year 

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:50.419
 now our colonies pass separate organic and inorganic trucks quito 

00:03:50.419 --> 00:03:53.719
 it does not separate from all hours probably this is the pearl of the festival 

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:57.619
 gully 

00:03:57.619 --> 00:04:01.149
 with the person who was approximately one kilogram previous 

00:04:01.149 --> 00:04:02.369
 go figure 

00:04:02.369 --> 00:04:05.569
 when the doctor we collect per doctor per year 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:08.400
 us in the decent turn 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.989
 nonsense today we have in recycling 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:13.820
 in the East Sea for inorganic garbage 

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:16.650
 in power from parana the garbage to spout 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:18.190
 and in the heart 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.259
 unwrinkled paper 

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:22.599
 the tastings 

00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:23.750
 Has pets 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:24.870
 what they should do 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.870
 poker waste to avoid polluting the environment 

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:31.719
 Another important fair point 

00:04:31.719 --> 00:04:35.139
 plastic bags take more than 50 years to biodegrade 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.430
 for that now in the shopping centers that use ecological bags 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.900
 remember 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.639
 that if the companies that continue to give those bags 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:47.860
 they will be fined 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.499
 that's why a good option 

00:04:50.499 --> 00:04:54.099
 that your compound is ecological and that would help salt the environment 

00:04:55.789 --> 00:04:57.659
 by size of the environment 

00:04:57.659 --> 00:05:00.659
 until the next for terán clay 

00:05:01.779 --> 00:05:04.779
 we return legal content 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.960
 three compañeras and you that is to take care of the environment 

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:15.539
 on the other hand in the last news we talked about social networks as 

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:19.650
 samuel everything so popular in the world or practice my partner was about 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:22.650
 puppets forward he argued 

00:05:23.499 --> 00:05:24.320
 for there 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:28.770
 today besides the puppet ito you know that it is the twitter if you have expensive in the 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:32.590
 dictionary the meaning more would see something like chat or for another 

00:05:35.029 --> 00:05:39.599
 but what is twitter this free service that allows users 

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:41.809
 send texas called tweets 

00:05:41.809 --> 00:05:44.900
 of 140 characters each text to the maximum 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:47.689
 what he has done is attractive to the 

00:05:47.689 --> 00:05:52.000
 that we can send you while being on the website as via SMS from a cell phone 

00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:55.759
 and also perform the tests that send us in the same way 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:59.389
 but what do we need to be on twitter 

00:05:59.389 --> 00:06:02.889
 first will triple them to two set points against so 

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:05.309
 and we will enter the main page 

00:06:05.309 --> 00:06:08.419
 we will click on what is falling to create an account 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:12.050
 Enter your data and you are not even on twitter 

00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:16.909
 the next step will be to recognize the window and actions of pt 

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:20.539
 at the top they found the adjustment tools 

00:06:20.539 --> 00:06:24.999
 in the right panel is our name the statistics in which we 

00:06:24.999 --> 00:06:28.270
 will indicate how many people we follow and how many followers we have 

00:06:29.069 --> 00:06:32.010
 in the center of the screen we will find the box 

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:32.930
 What's up 

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:37.750
 there we will write the 13 140 characters and that in average such 

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:40.750
 will appear to all my followers 

00:06:41.879 --> 00:06:45.249
 and under this box we will find the timeline 

00:06:45.249 --> 00:06:48.899
 there all messages are shown both children and people 

00:06:48.899 --> 00:06:50.669
 that I follow 

00:06:50.669 --> 00:06:53.669
 but now we need to know that it will continue to stand 

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:57.930
 they do not have great friend present is easy to find them for example 

00:06:57.930 --> 00:06:58.939
 in the part 

00:06:58.939 --> 00:07:03.029
 left behind we will find inti podenco seek people there are programs the 

00:07:03.029 --> 00:07:06.119
 name of the person someone will take electronic 

00:07:06.119 --> 00:07:10.539
 in any list television program danía preached inviting 

00:07:10.539 --> 00:07:12.629
 the people to follow them on twitter 

00:07:12.629 --> 00:07:16.029
 for example I knew that President Felipe Calderón also have to 

00:07:16.029 --> 00:07:16.589
 to have 

00:07:16.589 --> 00:07:19.969
 in the balance of all his public acts that will have 

00:07:19.969 --> 00:07:22.159
 important commands 

00:07:22.159 --> 00:07:26.860
 famous artists are also sad so every renowned journalists and 

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:30.339
 TV shows also have satellites 

00:07:30.339 --> 00:07:35.759
 all this time from 1911 to today since yesterday customers register you list 

00:07:35.759 --> 00:07:39.580
 in the news phrasing we will talk district almassora so that she is a 

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:40.439
 expert 

00:07:40.439 --> 00:07:42.690
 they were no longer equal before the law 

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:45.050
 until next time 

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:47.409
 three of those my title with followers on your twitter
