glove box light adi club was actually

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.800 
glove box light adi club was actually
the<00:03:18.650> first<00:03:18.680> one<00:03:19.070> that<00:03:19.100> came<00:03:19.340> on<00:03:19.690> you<00:03:20.690> would

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
the first one that came on you would

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.570 
the first one that came on you would
think<00:03:20.840> there'd<00:03:21.680> be<00:03:21.680> others<00:03:22.070> but<00:03:22.990> that's<00:03:23.990> great

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580 
think there'd be others but that's great

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.380 
think there'd be others but that's great
there's<00:03:25.580> person<00:03:25.970> on<00:03:26.030> there<00:03:26.150> they<00:03:26.240> made<00:03:26.360> a

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:26.390 
there's person on there they made a

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:29.560 
there's person on there they made a
modification<00:03:26.950> using<00:03:27.950> the<00:03:28.220> existing<00:03:29.150> wiring

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:29.570 
modification using the existing wiring

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:32.790 
modification using the existing wiring
and<00:03:29.990> LEDs<00:03:30.500> pretty<00:03:31.190> detailed<00:03:31.780> instructions

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:32.800 
and LEDs pretty detailed instructions

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.960 
and LEDs pretty detailed instructions
seemed<00:03:33.800> like<00:03:33.950> it<00:03:34.070> was<00:03:34.160> the<00:03:34.250> best<00:03:34.460> option<00:03:34.640> from

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
seemed like it was the best option from

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:36.910 
seemed like it was the best option from
all<00:03:35.180> the<00:03:35.300> other<00:03:35.420> ones<00:03:35.630> that<00:03:35.750> i<00:03:35.930> was<00:03:36.470> looking<00:03:36.800> at

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
all the other ones that i was looking at

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.540 
all the other ones that i was looking at
some<00:03:37.190> people<00:03:37.430> were<00:03:37.520> making<00:03:37.670> some<00:03:38.090> out<00:03:38.240> of

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:39.550 
some people were making some out of

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:43.090 
some people were making some out of
lights<00:03:40.550> that<00:03:40.670> they<00:03:40.790> found<00:03:41.120> it<00:03:41.740> was<00:03:42.740> that<00:03:42.890> one<00:03:43.070> I

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.100 
lights that they found it was that one I

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:45.040 
lights that they found it was that one I
can't<00:03:43.430> remember<00:03:43.700> basically<00:03:44.480> taking<00:03:44.810> apart

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:45.050 
can't remember basically taking apart

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:48.420 
can't remember basically taking apart
LEDs<00:03:45.620> and<00:03:45.650> putting<00:03:46.340> a<00:03:46.520> switch<00:03:47.090> in<00:03:47.390> so<00:03:47.840> we<00:03:47.960> would

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
LEDs and putting a switch in so we would

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.220 
LEDs and putting a switch in so we would
an<00:03:49.430> actual<00:03:49.820> what<00:03:50.330> was<00:03:50.480> that<00:03:50.600> a<00:03:50.660> mercury<00:03:51.020> switch

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
an actual what was that a mercury switch

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.730 
an actual what was that a mercury switch
so<00:03:51.890> when<00:03:52.010> he<00:03:52.070> tilted<00:03:52.340> the<00:03:52.400> box<00:03:52.850> let<00:03:53.120> me<00:03:53.210> turn<00:03:53.360> on

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:53.740 
so when he tilted the box let me turn on

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:57.070 
so when he tilted the box let me turn on
closed<00:03:54.740> it<00:03:54.950> like<00:03:55.730> we<00:03:55.850> turn<00:03:56.000> off<00:03:56.210> what<00:03:56.930> should

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:57.080 
closed it like we turn off what should

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.740 
closed it like we turn off what should
interesting<00:03:57.650> intriguing<00:03:58.330> ideas<00:03:59.330> people<00:03:59.510> came

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
interesting intriguing ideas people came

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:01.600 
interesting intriguing ideas people came
up<00:03:59.840> with<00:04:00.080> but<00:04:00.320> the<00:04:00.740> 1i<00:04:01.040> to<00:04:01.100> clubs<00:04:01.340> I<00:04:01.430> thought

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:01.610 
up with but the 1i to clubs I thought

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:03.250 
up with but the 1i to clubs I thought
was<00:04:01.760> pretty<00:04:01.820> good<00:04:02.120> cool<00:04:02.510> so<00:04:02.900> I<00:04:02.990> would<00:04:03.140> take<00:04:03.230> a

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
was pretty good cool so I would take a

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:04.900 
was pretty good cool so I would take a
look<00:04:03.470> at<00:04:03.560> that<00:04:03.680> one<00:04:03.860> see<00:04:04.250> if<00:04:04.340> it'll<00:04:04.490> work<00:04:04.610> for

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:04.910 
look at that one see if it'll work for
