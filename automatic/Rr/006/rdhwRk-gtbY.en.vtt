 ingredients that will be used to make the 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.770
 dough 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:44.650
 I have them here the flour the semolina oil 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:47.140

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:50.470
 fresh yeast and salt ingredients 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:53.230
 which will serve as farsi and I will 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:56.320
 need for it caster sugar 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:59.830

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:02.290
 little sugar syrup and fine semolina 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:04.960
 and finally I'm going to need to 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:08.680
 sugar syrup so I will prepare 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:11.290
 with water sugar semolina juice 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.479
 lemon and I'm going to scent it because 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.710
 I like the rose water with 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:17.110
 Rose water that can be replaced 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.000
 by orange blossom water 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.100
 according to the top and I will start with 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.140
 prepare the dough so for the 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.570
 preparation of the dough we mix 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:29.740
 fat but it will have to 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:32.289
 Melt the butter beforehand so 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:35.170
 the butter is melted and then 

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:37.360
 let it cook on this sweet to prepare 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:40.600
 a nutty butter so a butter 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.850
 hazelnut center that hosted up 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.729
 what he starts to smell or 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:49.119
 a scent of hazelnuts in the kitchen 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:51.250
 so you cut off the fire and you 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:53.590
 filter to remove impurities 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.000
 you have to be very careful when 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.590
 hazelnut butter preparation 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.590
 do not burn it 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.230
 and 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.960
 and 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.620
 he 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.230
 after mixing all the 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.049
 dough ingredients 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:32.239
 I got a dough of course very 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:34.159
 friable slips away to his friend from 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:36.470
 butter and we put oil 

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:37.370
 so I recommend you place and 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.659
 to place the dough 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.910
 offer me I work them is immediately 

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:43.340
 but it was a bit complicated for 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:44.599
 spread it out and place it in the mold but 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.810
 you can very well place it at 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:49.400
 refrigerator for a fortnight 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.579
 minutes the time that the butter 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:54.860
 harden and compact well the fat of 

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:56.810
 so that during the showcase also 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:58.340
 when you are in the process of 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.920
 the mold with the dough 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:03.349
 it will not crumble and then it's going 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.920
 the operation will be much more 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:06.769
 easily 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:08.660
 so I lined the mold with a 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:12.260
 ball of dough I spread out in a fine to 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:14.540
 drop of about 3 mm and the second 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:18.350
 frozen de facto ball reserved on the side 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:20.329
 after having it I reserve it here 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:23.300
 I have now gone over to the preparation 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:27.410
 the stuffing that will serve me to garnish 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:30.130
 inside this seizure has or 7 rounds 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:30.130
 out of the ordinary 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:02.780
 he 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.780
 we 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:19.660
 I put the cake in the oven now 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:22.750
 we will go to the preparation of the syrup 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:25.389
 so a medium density syrup that's at 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:27.550
 to say that we will place a liter of water in 

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:32.139
 a saucepan with a kilo and a half of 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:34.389
 sugar casts the juice of a lemon and at the 

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:37.330
 end of cooking syrup once 

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:39.669
 we got a density syrup 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:42.819
 mean I the perfumer is with a 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:44.349
 little bit of rose water very simple all 

00:05:42.819 --> 00:05:49.470
 the world knows how to make a sugar syrup 

00:05:44.349 --> 00:05:53.919
 so there the syrup is ready I 'm just going 

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:56.250
 corpore link of rose water for the 

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:56.250
 left 

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:20.750
 once spoils for then frozen watered 

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:22.910
 syrup and I left them well 

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:25.460
 absorb before decorating it with 

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:27.650
 slivered almonds bake in the oven 

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:29.480
