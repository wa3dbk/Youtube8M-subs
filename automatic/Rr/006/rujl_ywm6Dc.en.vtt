it there's a possibility they don't
scientists<00:02:11.880> don't<00:02:12.000> think<00:02:12.240> that<00:02:12.390> can<00:02:12.540> happen

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
scientists don't think that can happen

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.960 
scientists don't think that can happen
by<00:02:12.930> 2012<00:02:13.440> though<00:02:13.680> that<00:02:14.220> takes<00:02:14.520> so<00:02:15.209> long<00:02:15.569> to<00:02:15.810> do

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
by 2012 though that takes so long to do

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.330 
by 2012 though that takes so long to do
and<00:02:17.090> not<00:02:17.630> in<00:02:17.810> our<00:02:18.140> generation<00:02:18.650> that<00:02:19.040> will<00:02:19.160> not

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
and not in our generation that will not

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.900 
and not in our generation that will not
happen<00:02:19.940> anyways<00:02:20.890> so<00:02:21.890> the<00:02:22.100> main<00:02:22.280> can<00:02:22.430> series

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
happen anyways so the main can series

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:24.790 
happen anyways so the main can series
are<00:02:23.120> an<00:02:23.360> asteroid<00:02:24.050> could<00:02:24.290> hit<00:02:24.440> the<00:02:24.650> earth

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
are an asteroid could hit the earth

us um and why they would hide the end of
the<00:03:23.540> world<00:03:23.780> from<00:03:24.230> us<00:03:24.470> is<00:03:24.820> beyond<00:03:25.820> me<00:03:26.090> I<00:03:26.620> what

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
the world from us is beyond me I what

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.650 
the world from us is beyond me I what
are<00:03:27.709> they<00:03:27.830> saving<00:03:28.130> it<00:03:28.400> for<00:03:28.610> I<00:03:28.850> know<00:03:29.330> they're

are they saving it for I know they're
trying<00:03:29.930> to<00:03:29.989> save<00:03:30.200> a<00:03:30.470> mass<00:03:30.890> panic<00:03:31.340> obviously

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
trying to save a mass panic obviously

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:36.430 
trying to save a mass panic obviously
but<00:03:33.080> really<00:03:34.040> I<00:03:34.070> think<00:03:34.190> most<00:03:34.610> people<00:03:35.350> for<00:03:36.350> those

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
but really I think most people for those

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.060 
but really I think most people for those
of<00:03:36.620> you<00:03:36.739> that<00:03:36.890> don't<00:03:37.040> know<00:03:37.780> 2012<00:03:38.780> is<00:03:39.140> not<00:03:39.620> the

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.070 
of you that don't know 2012 is not the

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:42.100 
of you that don't know 2012 is not the
first<00:03:40.280> conspiracy<00:03:41.239> of<00:03:41.269> the<00:03:41.390> world<00:03:41.660> ending

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:42.110 
first conspiracy of the world ending

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:46.300 
first conspiracy of the world ending
there<00:03:42.800> has<00:03:43.070> been<00:03:43.150> y2k<00:03:44.150> that's<00:03:45.080> the<00:03:45.769> only<00:03:46.130> ones

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
there has been y2k that's the only ones

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.250 
there has been y2k that's the only ones
of<00:03:46.430> our<00:03:46.580> generation<00:03:46.820> really<00:03:47.510> than<00:03:47.690> y2k<00:03:48.049> in

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
of our generation really than y2k in

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.860 
of our generation really than y2k in
2012<00:03:48.830> I<00:03:49.040> guess<00:03:49.580> my<00:03:49.790> generation<00:03:50.360> is<00:03:50.480> not<00:03:50.690> old

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
2012 I guess my generation is not old

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.670 
2012 I guess my generation is not old
because<00:03:51.709> I'm<00:03:51.830> only<00:03:52.040> 16<00:03:52.549> years<00:03:52.700> old<00:03:52.940> but<00:03:53.810> there

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
because I'm only 16 years old but there

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.259 
because I'm only 16 years old but there
have<00:03:54.890> been<00:03:54.920> like<00:03:55.370> a<00:03:55.430> ridiculous<00:03:56.150> amount

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:56.269 
have been like a ridiculous amount

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:59.020 
have been like a ridiculous amount
probably<00:03:56.900> in<00:03:56.989> the<00:03:57.080> 20s<00:03:57.610> most<00:03:58.610> people<00:03:58.880> don't

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
probably in the 20s most people don't

end<00:04:47.449> to<00:04:48.380> me<00:04:48.500> that's<00:04:48.860> just<00:04:48.949> bullshit<00:04:49.550> someone

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 
end to me that's just bullshit someone

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.879 
end to me that's just bullshit someone
looking<00:04:50.360> for<00:04:50.570> attention<00:04:50.780> and<00:04:51.199> the<00:04:51.740> other

looking for attention and the other

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:54.939 
looking for attention and the other
thing<00:04:51.949> is<00:04:52.190> a<00:04:52.370> pole<00:04:52.760> shift<00:04:53.120> if<00:04:53.419> a<00:04:54.380> pole<00:04:54.650> shift

00:04:54.939 --> 00:04:54.949 
thing is a pole shift if a pole shift

00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:57.790 
thing is a pole shift if a pole shift
were<00:04:55.250> to<00:04:55.490> occur<00:04:56.169> it<00:04:57.169> would<00:04:57.350> probably<00:04:57.620> destroy

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 
were to occur it would probably destroy

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.580 
were to occur it would probably destroy
the<00:04:58.280> earth<00:04:58.660> it's<00:04:59.660> when<00:04:59.870> the<00:04:59.960> south<00:05:00.139> poor<00:05:00.470> in

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.490 

that<00:05:07.580> is<00:05:07.880> really<00:05:08.270> the<00:05:08.300> only<00:05:08.510> possibility<00:05:09.350> that

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:09.500 
that is really the only possibility that

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.529 
that is really the only possibility that
scientists<00:05:10.070> can<00:05:10.100> really<00:05:10.520> conclude<00:05:11.180> could

00:05:11.529 --> 00:05:11.539 
scientists can really conclude could

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:14.950 
scientists can really conclude could
happen<00:05:12.110> on<00:05:12.530> december<00:05:13.100> 21st<00:05:13.610> 2012<00:05:14.210> a<00:05:14.449> pole
