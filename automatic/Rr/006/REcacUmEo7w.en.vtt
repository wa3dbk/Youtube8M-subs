00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.819
 good how are my men joseph 

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:05.770
 techno fanatic dotcom and today I want 

00:00:03.819 --> 00:00:08.050
 tell you my experience that I had in the 

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:11.250
 apple store with respect to iphone 5 

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:11.250
 so let's go with the video 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.060
 many will wonder why jose helps 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.220
 because conchudo after having had 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.590
 tremendous scratch then go to contribute to that 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.960
 you change your good mobile device 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.180
 I'm going to tell you the story when I 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.850
 I uploaded the unpacking video of the 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.500
 am iphone 5 boxing many people 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.290
 they told me that the device 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:44.040
 had two silver points in one 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.750
 from the ends of the iphone 5 is I decided 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.840
 verify and indeed there were two 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.030
 puntitos that 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.910
 they were silver and they did not match with 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:55.190
 the black color of the cell phone I decided 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:57.800
 Lords of truth try your luck decide 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.360
 to apple and see if it's that deep down I 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.010
 they could change the device by the 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.339
 fact that he had come from the factory with 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:07.430
 those two little dots that did not affect in 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:08.960
 nothing the cell phone performance went to 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.630
 Polo DÃ­az was to visit the one in the afternoon 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.670
 I decided to teach the person that I 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.130
 attended I have these two little dots and 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.380
 Factory came and told me to and what 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.840
 happened here I told him that the cell phone 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.850
 this one had a small mishap no and 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.170
 I hope that deep down, that's not 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.540
 justifies the fact that the product 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:29.210
 live with those two little dots in the 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.950
 extreme left the person very 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.860
 He graciously gave me an explanation 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:36.560
 He said they do not change devices 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:39.110
 that simple, there are also expenses that 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.119
 in case I had the eye care I would have 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.440
 to pay I think two hundred 200 money 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:44.360
 depending on the model that one has 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.880
 so you replace the device 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.200
 but I told them that I was using 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.350
 the Iphone 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.570
 those who had them on the 44th and now 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.130
 I bought this and that in the background then this 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.950
 it seemed strange to me that the product 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:01.039
 come that way the person at the end 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:03.350
 very graciously decided to give me an iphone 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:05.840
 5 new gentlemen replaced me the 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.789
 device for a new one then I said 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.690
 why not make a video because in the 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:10.759
 background of many people who 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.800
 possibly looking inside a 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:14.630
 product that buys a service 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.030
 After-sale a good after-sales service 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.760
 the experience that I had today 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.920
 as much as I feel bad for what I 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.510
 I have done because in the background there were two 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.519
 concepts that possibly not 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.349
 they justified a cell phone replacement 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:28.790
 but last name of several people and that 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:31.579
 I'm going to do the preview and see in the background 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.140
 if indeed the service that 

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:35.720
 apple has is like many people 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.579
 they speak that it is excellent is very good and 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.989
 that there are moments that they know well 

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:41.410
 if this until they replace the 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:43.990
 device have a new one 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.580
 Now that I went, I can confirm that 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:47.980
 that effectively gentlemen in the service 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.600
 apple is very good I replaced the 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.040
 device for a new one I'm going to have 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.500
 now that it's nothing to synchronize my 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.360
 applications no but I changed the 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.880
 device now I know there are many 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.890
 people who are apple fan there are other 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.380
 people who are android fans of 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.510
 samsung or him and I do not have to 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.820
 leaving aside is the service that one 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:09.580
 You can have post 20 you buy a 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.960
 device and if a problem happens then 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.340
 The idea is that you have a store in 

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:15.460
 where you can go to the store of the 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.530
 dam where the device was sold 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:20.050
 or the brand that supposedly represents 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.870
 your device and be able to request the 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:25.330
 repair or replacement of that 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.980
 product then in my case and because of 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.780
 the apple store request the 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.360
 replacement then gentlemen rejected me the 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.950
 device and now I have an iphone 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.840
 again now I do not want you to be surprised 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.400
 gentlemen because I 've made videos with 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.099
 about 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.260
 and cases for iphone 5 with my 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:42.970
 previous device that supposedly 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.620
 it was damaged so do not be surprised if 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:48.769
 you watch videos later with 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:51.049
 the iphone5 scratched again because as they 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:52.250
 I say I have videos already made with 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:53.540
 regarding new cases that we 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.700
 I will be presenting this week and the 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.379
 next week then later 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.450
 You can present her with this new 

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:01.010
 iphone without scratched of gentlemen but what 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:03.049
 has happened to me today is really something 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.849
 what happened to me, no, I'm not lying 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:06.769
 I do not want to do anybody's favor if I do not 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:08.209
 it's an experience that I had and that I'm going to 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:09.799
 share it with all of you for 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:12.409
 also those who basically seek 

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:14.569
 an after-sales service because apple has 

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:16.040
 Excellent after-sales service so 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:18.410
 I wish you liked this video that 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:19.489
