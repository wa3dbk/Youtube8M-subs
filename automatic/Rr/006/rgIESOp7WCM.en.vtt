in<00:02:01.500> it<00:02:01.860> so<00:02:02.130> it's<00:02:02.310> not<00:02:02.460> that<00:02:02.520> huge<00:02:03.149> of<00:02:03.390> a

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
in it so it's not that huge of a

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.539 
in it so it's not that huge of a
surprise<00:02:03.810> that<00:02:04.079> they<00:02:04.200> would<00:02:04.350> embrace<00:02:04.829> it<00:02:05.340> so

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
surprise that they would embrace it so

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:06.230 
surprise that they would embrace it so
tightly

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
tightly

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.300

what's<00:02:06.450> unchanged<00:02:07.110> about<00:02:07.350> this<00:02:07.560> band<00:02:07.799> and<00:02:08.129> I

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
what's unchanged about this band and I

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.839 
what's unchanged about this band and I
think<00:02:08.610> it's<00:02:08.759> their<00:02:08.970> most<00:02:09.649> unique

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:10.849 
think it's their most unique

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:13.280 
think it's their most unique
characteristic<00:02:11.849> are<00:02:12.090> the<00:02:12.780> vocal

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
characteristic are the vocal

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.140 
characteristic are the vocal
and<00:02:13.560> the<00:02:14.159> vocals<00:02:14.549> on<00:02:14.730> this<00:02:14.909> thing<00:02:15.120> are<00:02:15.420> man

they're whiny they're geeky they're

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:23.440

awkward<00:02:21.140> they<00:02:22.140> aren't<00:02:22.980> all<00:02:23.099> that

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
awkward they aren't all that

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.300 
awkward they aren't all that
intelligible<00:02:24.450> they<00:02:24.959> kind<00:02:25.290> of<00:02:25.379> bleed<00:02:25.739> like<00:02:26.280> a

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310

production-wise<00:02:28.680> I<00:02:29.010> think<00:02:29.189> the<00:02:29.280> strange<00:02:29.579> boys

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:47.480 
the lyrics on this album but I can't
because<00:04:44.820> the<00:04:45.120> vocals<00:04:45.540> are<00:04:45.660> just<00:04:46.250> they've<00:04:47.250> just

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490

got this whine to them they carry more

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:52.160 
got this whine to them they carry more
of<00:04:49.830> a<00:04:50.070> wine<00:04:50.340> than<00:04:50.730> they<00:04:50.850> do<00:04:50.910> a<00:04:51.030> tune<00:04:51.390> I<00:04:51.750> know<00:04:51.930> the

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:52.170 
of a wine than they do a tune I know the

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:54.920

flavor of the strange boys music but I

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:58.850 
flavor of the strange boys music but I
think<00:04:57.840> they<00:04:57.960> could<00:04:58.020> have<00:04:58.200> been<00:04:58.410> altered<00:04:58.770> a

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860 
think they could have been altered a

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.010 
think they could have been altered a
little<00:04:58.890> bit<00:04:59.250> without<00:04:59.630> losing<00:05:00.630> this<00:05:00.750> bands

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
little bit without losing this bands

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.200 
little bit without losing this bands
really<00:05:01.290> standout<00:05:01.830> personality<00:05:02.730> still

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210 
really standout personality still

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:05.900 
really standout personality still
despite<00:05:03.630> all<00:05:03.780> that<00:05:03.810> the<00:05:04.680> songs<00:05:05.340> on<00:05:05.580> this<00:05:05.760> are

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:05.910 
despite all that the songs on this are

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:08.660 
despite all that the songs on this are
pretty<00:05:05.940> catchy<00:05:06.300> the<00:05:06.570> solos<00:05:07.080> are<00:05:07.320> great<00:05:07.710> and<00:05:07.980> I

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:08.670 
pretty catchy the solos are great and I

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:12.170 
pretty catchy the solos are great and I
think<00:05:08.940> this<00:05:09.090> LP<00:05:09.660> sounds<00:05:10.170> like<00:05:10.380> a<00:05:10.680> younger<00:05:11.490> more

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.180
