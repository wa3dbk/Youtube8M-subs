00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 hello all well be welcome my channel the 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.200
 name ronaldo and today I thought and solved 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.809
 record this video because many people 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.840
 I wonder how I do mine. 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:16.610
 tapioca at home is very easy and simple and 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.610
 So stay with me, I'll explain. 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.699
 Good to get started then we need the 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:29.580
 ingredients is here in my city 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.500
 calls the society of that here is a 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.840
 meeting per kilo here we have one 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.030
 packer here in town was the video of 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.770
 south that this first bulletin that 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.370
 People are going to make a prescription. 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:45.120
 use a medium that returns 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:49.200
 the second ingredient for 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:52.440
 remained at 12 is approximately 350 ml of 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:55.230
 filtered water why do we go 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.370
 need a pot because you have to 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.590
 be tough 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.660
 I use it here when stainless steel 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:04.260
 Not to worry, at the time you 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:07.470
 you have scrambling southall way 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:14.939
 something in the ingredients a spoon 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:17.340
 large container and a container to place the 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:21.810
 tapioca so let's go there where the first 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:24.509
 so there is already the video that does not 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:35.930
 there is in it and now I will put water here 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:35.930
 I'm pouring water on myself and failing 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:44.040
 Let's do this and let's see how it is. 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.299
 Stay, we have to move the 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.990
 world 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:52.409
 We'll spread the word there. 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.960
 mixing by mixing the dough into the 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.450
 sweet sprinkle it be hydrated with 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.159
 This water that we put inside is 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.399
 So you 're doing this, here I go. 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:05.040
 stirring and you'll see when it's going 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.020
 stay after you have the people continue 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:12.860
 moving 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:14.480
 looking good and still carry on 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.580
 stirring people, look, this is a 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.680
 a little more work that part 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:23.569
 here we have to distribute a lot 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:25.340
 water in the mass has still had to 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:28.310
 be very uniform we'll have to move 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:31.549
 It is quite complex to move here to make 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:34.819
 hydration of our most delicious purinol 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:37.610
 she'll be in a bit is getting the 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:40.610
 I got a cup from here a little bit 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.049
 you will see she will appear is with a 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.930
 shore mass 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:47.780
 We're going to do this so the dough goes 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:51.940
 get pretty pebbles 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.940
 it will look like a block Recopa 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:03:01.220
 Good, I had to put a little 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:03.049
 more listening because the amount of 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.840
 water was a little walk away, is not it? 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:08.930
 Doing this, you too. 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:12.950
 now the mass is over, it's loose 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:16.970
 the result of the panela 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:20.060
 dinho so here's the point for us 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:23.239
 can penetrate more a little help to 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:24.019
 get goods including even water in 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:27.730
 pasta 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:27.730
 We'll leave later for the pear tree. 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:33.290
 well it's ready 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:35.180
 It is each person depending on the way 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.750
 Sometimes you need to put a 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.489
 Water 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:41.030
 sometimes it 's a little bit more to put 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:43.989
 vildozo the important thing is that the mass of this 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:47.959
 the way the old man well loosened 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:52.340
 with the pebbles and looking like 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:59.120
 more pop we going to do now 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:04:00.739
 people going to put it is very simple and 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.370
 calm now you're doing it more 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:05.440
 here o 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:09.000
 You'll do what you'll do alone. 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:12.360
 but nothing and cooks 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.120
 is being formed down here I can 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:18.299
 that you will put it in the frying pan 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:20.850
 already to make your tapioca with stuffing 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:25.320
 Whatever you want, it 's fine, calm down. 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:28.710
 I'll do it here I'll put it 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:31.290
 plus the pp not worth what I'm using 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.970
 a little bit to facilitate the 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:34.920
 work if you have small stone 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:37.380
 It can be too but it's better than you. 

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:39.870
 has made it like a little bit bigger 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:45.390
 that there work yields more 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:49.310
 Look how you see this is already the 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:49.310
 ready to eat 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:58.620
 I usually do this amount and already 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:04.350
 I just got to call me and I'll have a 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:10.770
 week of January until one week in the 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:12.990
 way to eat done promptly fried 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:14.190
 I found it as you want and 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:16.440
 it was very good 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:19.380
