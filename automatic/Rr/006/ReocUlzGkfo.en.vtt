00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
what it's all going to contain is that

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.130 
what it's all going to contain is that
you're<00:00:30.150> going<00:00:30.240> to<00:00:30.330> be<00:00:30.420> pretty<00:00:30.630> much<00:00:30.840> fighting

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.340 
class or whatever you want to call it is
pretty<00:00:44.610> much<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:45.210> opposite<00:00:45.780> of<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:46.140> boss

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
pretty much the opposite of the boss

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.900 
pretty much the opposite of the boss
that<00:00:46.680> you're<00:00:47.010> going<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.219> be<00:00:47.340> fighting<00:00:47.550> in<00:00:47.820> the

expansion so and also notice that
there's<00:00:50.250> also<00:00:50.489> be<00:00:50.730> an<00:00:50.820> expanded<00:00:51.329> Paragon

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
there's also be an expanded Paragon

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.959 
there's also be an expanded Paragon
system<00:00:52.230> there's<00:00:52.920> gonna<00:00:53.070> be<00:00:53.250> more<00:00:53.460> game<00:00:53.760> own

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
system there's gonna be more game own

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.540 
system there's gonna be more game own
game<00:00:54.600> modes<00:00:54.899> like<00:00:55.110> a<00:00:55.289> loot<00:00:55.649> runs<00:00:55.860> so<00:00:56.309> pretty

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
game modes like a loot runs so pretty

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.639 
game modes like a loot runs so pretty
much<00:00:56.670> like<00:00:56.910> a<00:00:56.940> you<00:00:57.600> know<00:00:57.629> probably<00:00:58.440> like<00:00:58.620> a

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
much like a you know probably like a

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.360 
much like a you know probably like a
keyboard<00:00:59.190> and<00:00:59.280> type<00:00:59.460> thing<00:00:59.789> but<00:01:00.059> you

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
keyboard and type thing but you

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.590 
keyboard and type thing but you
specifically<00:01:02.370> go<00:01:02.640> for<00:01:02.910> loot<00:01:03.090> drops<00:01:03.420> so

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
specifically go for loot drops so

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.149 
specifically go for loot drops so
probably<00:01:03.930> like<00:01:03.989> boss<00:01:04.439> runs<00:01:04.710> kind<00:01:04.949> of<00:01:05.040> like<00:01:05.129> a

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
probably like boss runs kind of like a

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.780 
probably like boss runs kind of like a
in<00:01:05.489> diablo<00:01:06.090> 2<00:01:06.240> with<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.420> bail<00:01:06.689> runs<00:01:06.990> and

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 
in diablo 2 with the bail runs and

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.310 
in diablo 2 with the bail runs and
there's<00:01:08.790> also<00:01:09.380> going<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.500> be<00:01:10.619> Nephilim<00:01:11.340> trials

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
there's also going to be Nephilim trials

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.359 
there's also going to be Nephilim trials
they<00:01:13.320> really<00:01:13.619> didn't<00:01:13.860> say<00:01:13.979> much<00:01:14.010> on<00:01:14.310> that

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
they really didn't say much on that

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.070 
they really didn't say much on that
either<00:01:14.760> but<00:01:15.119> I'm<00:01:15.240> assuming<00:01:15.360> it's<00:01:15.720> gonna<00:01:15.840> be

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
either but I'm assuming it's gonna be

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.080 
either but I'm assuming it's gonna be
like<00:01:16.290> a<00:01:16.320> gauntlet<00:01:16.860> type<00:01:17.159> thing<00:01:17.430> where<00:01:17.460> you

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
like a gauntlet type thing where you

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.990 
like a gauntlet type thing where you
fight<00:01:19.049> off<00:01:19.229> waves<00:01:19.650> of<00:01:20.040> monsters<00:01:20.610> and<00:01:20.640> more

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
fight off waves of monsters and more

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.070 
fight off waves of monsters and more
waves<00:01:21.210> or<00:01:21.390> more<00:01:21.540> waves<00:01:21.750> and<00:01:21.930> they

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
waves or more waves and they

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.740 
waves or more waves and they
progressively<00:01:22.590> get<00:01:22.890> higher<00:01:23.159> and<00:01:23.750> depending

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
progressively get higher and depending

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.359 
progressively get higher and depending
on<00:01:24.840> how<00:01:25.020> far<00:01:25.200> you<00:01:25.350> make<00:01:25.500> it<00:01:25.680> you<00:01:25.770> get<00:01:25.920> loot<00:01:26.159> I'm

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
on how far you make it you get loot I'm

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.249 
on how far you make it you get loot I'm
assuming<00:01:26.970> so<00:01:27.180> I<00:01:27.210> don't<00:01:27.570> take<00:01:27.689> my<00:01:27.869> word<00:01:28.020> for<00:01:28.229> it
