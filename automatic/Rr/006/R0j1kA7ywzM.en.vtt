will help with us being able to open
this<00:03:36.430> whole<00:03:36.670> part<00:03:37.000> up<00:03:37.240> so<00:03:37.540> that<00:03:37.660> we<00:03:37.690> can<00:03:37.900> smoosh

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
this whole part up so that we can smoosh

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.560 
this whole part up so that we can smoosh
it<00:03:38.260> down<00:03:38.590> once<00:03:39.580> you've<00:03:39.700> gotten<00:03:39.970> both<00:03:40.150> parts

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:40.570 
it down once you've gotten both parts

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:43.020 
it down once you've gotten both parts
started<00:03:41.080> get<00:03:41.350> them<00:03:41.980> both<00:03:42.160> poofed<00:03:42.550> out<00:03:42.730> at<00:03:42.940> the

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
started get them both poofed out at the

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.300 
started get them both poofed out at the
same<00:03:43.270> time<00:03:43.650> put<00:03:44.650> a<00:03:44.680> little<00:03:44.800> pressure<00:03:44.980> right

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
same time put a little pressure right

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.070 
same time put a little pressure right
there<00:03:45.490> on<00:03:45.610> the<00:03:45.640> top<00:03:45.910> and<00:03:46.209> bring<00:03:46.450> it<00:03:46.570> down<00:03:46.600> bring

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:47.080 
there on the top and bring it down bring

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.580 
there on the top and bring it down bring
the<00:03:47.800> center<00:03:48.220> straight<00:03:49.090> down<00:03:49.660> so<00:03:50.140> that<00:03:50.170> you<00:03:50.410> can

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
the center straight down so that you can

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.860 
the center straight down so that you can
get<00:03:50.739> everything<00:03:51.010> lined<00:03:51.310> up<00:03:51.550> so<00:03:52.209> that<00:03:52.360> it<00:03:52.480> opens

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
get everything lined up so that it opens

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.380 
get everything lined up so that it opens
up<00:03:52.989> into<00:03:53.170> this<00:03:53.290> nice<00:03:53.680> big<00:03:54.100> rectangular<00:03:54.850> space

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390 
up into this nice big rectangular space

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.949 
up into this nice big rectangular space
I<00:03:56.670> know<00:03:57.670> this<00:03:57.820> pattern<00:03:58.239> is<00:03:58.270> super<00:03:58.660> busy<00:03:58.780> so

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
I know this pattern is super busy so

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:00.479 
I know this pattern is super busy so
it's<00:03:59.200> hard<00:03:59.350> to<00:03:59.410> see<00:03:59.650> these<00:03:59.800> creases<00:04:00.130> and<00:04:00.340> folds

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489 
it's hard to see these creases and folds

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:01.830 
it's hard to see these creases and folds
but<00:04:00.910> you<00:04:01.030> should<00:04:01.209> get<00:04:01.330> something<00:04:01.660> that<00:04:01.780> looks

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
but you should get something that looks

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.820 
but you should get something that looks
like<00:04:01.989> this<00:04:03.330> turn<00:04:04.330> it<00:04:04.480> around<00:04:04.570> and<00:04:04.959> then<00:04:05.050> I'm

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:05.830 
like this turn it around and then I'm

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:07.949 
like this turn it around and then I'm
just<00:04:05.920> going<00:04:06.160> to<00:04:06.250> smooth<00:04:06.640> out<00:04:06.820> this<00:04:07.120> side<00:04:07.480> here

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 
just going to smooth out this side here

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:10.979 
just going to smooth out this side here
by<00:04:08.200> folding<00:04:08.709> these<00:04:09.250> edges<00:04:09.850> down<00:04:10.090> now<00:04:10.570> doesn't

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:10.989 
by folding these edges down now doesn't

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:14.310 
by folding these edges down now doesn't
create<00:04:11.230> a<00:04:11.290> perfect<00:04:11.530> point<00:04:12.400> because<00:04:13.090> of<00:04:13.420> how

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:14.320 
create a perfect point because of how

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.400 
create a perfect point because of how
narrow<00:04:14.860> the<00:04:15.070> paper<00:04:15.280> was<00:04:15.900> but<00:04:16.900> you<00:04:16.989> should<00:04:17.020> get

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410 
narrow the paper was but you should get

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:19.830 
narrow the paper was but you should get
a<00:04:17.680> nice<00:04:18.130> little<00:04:18.340> top<00:04:18.609> there<00:04:18.910> and<00:04:19.120> then<00:04:19.630> just

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
a nice little top there and then just

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.659 
a nice little top there and then just
fold<00:04:20.020> that<00:04:20.260> straight<00:04:20.739> down<00:04:20.950> flush<00:04:21.400> with<00:04:21.640> the

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:21.669 
fold that straight down flush with the

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:23.820 
fold that straight down flush with the
edge<00:04:21.880> to<00:04:22.540> give<00:04:22.690> yourself<00:04:22.840> a<00:04:23.260> finished<00:04:23.620> piece

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
edge to give yourself a finished piece

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.150 
edge to give yourself a finished piece
and<00:04:25.289> inside<00:04:26.289> you've<00:04:26.530> got<00:04:26.650> this<00:04:26.800> nice<00:04:26.979> little

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
and inside you've got this nice little

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.460 
and inside you've got this nice little
pocket<00:04:27.430> area<00:04:27.700> here<00:04:28.030> to<00:04:28.210> keep<00:04:28.390> things<00:04:28.660> if<00:04:28.870> you

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
pocket area here to keep things if you

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:30.600 
pocket area here to keep things if you
prefer<00:04:29.860> to<00:04:30.100> point

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610 
prefer to point

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:33.510 
prefer to point
you<00:04:30.969> can<00:04:31.270> of<00:04:31.599> course<00:04:31.629> tuck<00:04:32.289> this<00:04:32.590> inside<00:04:33.280> to

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
you can of course tuck this inside to

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.149 
you can of course tuck this inside to
this<00:04:33.669> pocket<00:04:34.150> to<00:04:34.810> create<00:04:35.229> kind<00:04:35.620> of<00:04:35.800> what<00:04:36.009> would

00:04:36.149 --> 00:04:36.159 
this pocket to create kind of what would

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:40.529 
this pocket to create kind of what would
look<00:04:36.310> like<00:04:36.520> a<00:04:36.819> envelope<00:04:37.689> if<00:04:38.229> you<00:04:38.349> will<00:04:39.539> and

00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:40.539 
look like a envelope if you will and

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:42.689 
look like a envelope if you will and
that's<00:04:40.780> just<00:04:40.930> sort<00:04:41.110> of<00:04:41.169> up<00:04:41.319> to<00:04:41.500> you<00:04:41.530> it<00:04:42.430> takes<00:04:42.610> a

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:42.699 
that's just sort of up to you it takes a

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:44.820 
that's just sort of up to you it takes a
little<00:04:43.080> maneuvering<00:04:44.080> to<00:04:44.289> get<00:04:44.409> that<00:04:44.560> in<00:04:44.710> there

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 
little maneuvering to get that in there

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:46.679 
little maneuvering to get that in there
but<00:04:45.099> once<00:04:45.580> you've<00:04:45.729> got<00:04:45.909> it<00:04:45.939> in<00:04:46.180> there<00:04:46.389> you<00:04:46.569> can

00:04:46.679 --> 00:04:46.689 
but once you've got it in there you can

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:49.050 
but once you've got it in there you can
have<00:04:46.900> that<00:04:47.139> kind<00:04:47.439> of<00:04:47.469> sealed<00:04:47.770> off<00:04:48.009> to<00:04:48.400> close<00:04:48.639> to

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 
have that kind of sealed off to close to

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.200 
have that kind of sealed off to close to
be<00:04:49.539> complete<00:04:49.930> or<00:04:50.139> you<00:04:50.830> can<00:04:51.009> leave<00:04:51.129> it<00:04:51.189> out<00:04:51.490> and

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:52.210 
be complete or you can leave it out and

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:53.580 
be complete or you can leave it out and
I<00:04:52.270> think<00:04:52.539> this<00:04:52.659> just<00:04:52.810> looks<00:04:53.080> kind<00:04:53.319> of<00:04:53.379> cool

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:53.590 
I think this just looks kind of cool

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:54.749 
I think this just looks kind of cool
like<00:04:53.830> I<00:04:53.889> said<00:04:54.129> if<00:04:54.219> you<00:04:54.250> just<00:04:54.460> put<00:04:54.610> like<00:04:54.729> a

00:04:54.749 --> 00:04:54.759 
like I said if you just put like a

00:04:54.759 --> 00:04:56.219 
like I said if you just put like a
little<00:04:54.879> gold<00:04:55.300> sticker<00:04:55.629> or<00:04:55.810> something<00:04:55.840> that<00:04:56.199> I

00:04:56.219 --> 00:04:56.229 
little gold sticker or something that I

00:04:56.229 --> 00:04:57.629 
little gold sticker or something that I
could<00:04:56.349> look<00:04:56.439> like<00:04:56.590> a<00:04:56.620> little<00:04:56.919> clutch<00:04:57.099> handbag

00:04:57.629 --> 00:04:57.639
