saying they're lighter than your boots

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:16.570 
saying they're lighter than your boots
that<00:02:13.950> you<00:02:14.010> got<00:02:14.540> definitely<00:02:15.540> probably<00:02:15.900> about<00:02:16.200> a

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
that you got definitely probably about a

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.949 
that you got definitely probably about a
quarter<00:02:17.580> of<00:02:17.790> the<00:02:17.970> weights<00:02:18.330> of<00:02:18.569> my<00:02:18.840> boots<00:02:20.959> so

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
quarter of the weights of my boots so

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:23.330 
quarter of the weights of my boots so
this<00:02:22.110> said<00:02:22.319> it's<00:02:22.470> going<00:02:22.620> to<00:02:22.680> take<00:02:22.950> several

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
this said it's going to take several

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.280 
this said it's going to take several
coats<00:02:24.680> to<00:02:25.680> really<00:02:25.980> do<00:02:26.099> the<00:02:26.190> job<00:02:27.080> I'll<00:02:28.080> do<00:02:28.230> the

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
coats to really do the job I'll do the

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.160 
coats to really do the job I'll do the
first<00:02:28.470> code<00:02:28.709> now<00:02:29.150> this<00:02:30.150> is<00:02:30.390> pretty<00:02:30.569> repetitive

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
first code now this is pretty repetitive

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.009 
first code now this is pretty repetitive
I<00:02:31.500> probably<00:02:31.890> wants<00:02:32.099> to<00:02:32.160> judge<00:02:32.370> you<00:02:32.489> guys<00:02:32.670> to

you an idea but viewers love that little

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.229 
you an idea but viewers love that little
repetition<00:02:42.870> you<00:02:43.200> ever<00:02:43.319> heard<00:02:43.500> anybody<00:02:43.709> right
