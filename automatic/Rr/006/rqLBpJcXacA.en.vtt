00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
manifolds and without this you can have

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.049 
manifolds and without this you can have
nothing<00:00:41.040> but<00:00:41.129> troubles<00:00:41.520> you<00:00:41.579> have<00:00:41.760> all<00:00:41.850> kinds

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059

of<00:00:42.120> vacuum<00:00:42.480> leaks<00:00:42.690> just<00:00:43.469> so<00:00:43.559> you<00:00:43.620> know<00:00:43.710> what<00:00:44.010> a

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
of vacuum leaks just so you know what a

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.560 
of vacuum leaks just so you know what a
square<00:00:44.280> bore<00:00:44.460> manifold<00:00:44.910> looks<00:00:45.120> like<00:00:45.270> in<00:00:45.420> case

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
square bore manifold looks like in case

you<00:00:45.690> do<00:00:45.840> have<00:00:46.050> one<00:00:46.850> they<00:00:47.850> look<00:00:48.000> like<00:00:48.030> this<00:00:48.329> and

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
you do have one they look like this and

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.470 
you do have one they look like this and
of<00:00:49.289> course<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.559> gasket<00:00:49.950> fits<00:00:50.129> very<00:00:50.340> nicely

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.480 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.209 

now<00:00:54.480> our<00:00:54.629> adapter<00:00:54.989> kits<00:00:55.260> come<00:00:55.530> complete<00:00:55.980> they

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
now our adapter kits come complete they

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.520 
now our adapter kits come complete they
come<00:00:56.370> with<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.579> adapter<00:00:56.940> plate<00:00:57.530> the

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
come with the adapter plate the

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.529 
come with the adapter plate the
necessary<00:00:58.980> gaskets<00:00:59.550> and<00:00:59.760> all<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.210> mounting

hardware we're going to go Edd and put

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:07.700 
hardware we're going to go Edd and put
this<00:01:01.920> on<00:01:02.329> start<00:01:03.329> with<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.539> gasket<00:01:06.650> and<00:01:07.650> of

this on start with the gasket and of

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.350 
this on start with the gasket and of
course<00:01:07.770> this<00:01:08.010> has<00:01:08.130> got<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:08.310> go<00:01:08.490> down<00:01:08.520> on<00:01:09.060> the

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
course this has got to go down on the

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.140 
course this has got to go down on the

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
correct way in the manifold we're going

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:25.889 
correct way in the manifold we're going
to<00:01:15.210> install<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.570> mounting<00:01:15.720> screws

00:01:25.889 --> 00:01:25.899 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:28.060 

when<00:01:26.899> you're<00:01:27.020> tightening<00:01:27.170> these<00:01:27.469> don't<00:01:27.740> cinch

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
when you're tightening these don't cinch

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.639 
when you're tightening these don't cinch
one<00:01:28.490> down<00:01:28.880> and<00:01:29.270> then<00:01:29.359> the<00:01:29.479> others<00:01:29.780> just<00:01:30.350> snug

00:01:30.639 --> 00:01:30.649 
one down and then the others just snug

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:33.880 
one down and then the others just snug
them<00:01:30.799> up<00:01:30.859> a<00:01:31.009> little<00:01:31.039> bit<00:01:31.310> first<00:01:31.549> and<00:01:32.799> then<00:01:33.799> go

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
them up a little bit first and then go

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.770 
them up a little bit first and then go
around<00:01:34.100> to<00:01:34.250> each<00:01:34.280> one<00:01:34.700> and<00:01:34.939> just<00:01:35.509> give<00:01:35.630> it<00:01:35.719> a

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
around to each one and just give it a

we're<00:01:41.240> going<00:01:41.329> to<00:01:41.420> install<00:01:41.509> the<00:01:41.780> four<00:01:41.959> mounting

00:01:42.309 --> 00:01:42.319 
we're going to install the four mounting

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:56.800 
we're going to install the four mounting
studs<00:01:50.740> now<00:01:51.740> install<00:01:52.130> the<00:01:52.250> top<00:01:52.429> gasket<00:01:55.810> and
