00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
add a lot of bulk so it doesn't really

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.940

it is raised up so if you set it down

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.300 
it is raised up so if you set it down
like<00:02:00.110> that<00:02:00.260> of<00:02:00.530> course<00:02:00.710> you've<00:02:01.010> got<00:02:01.159> a<00:02:01.190> little

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.219 
like that of course you've got a little
bit<00:02:01.520> of<00:02:01.549> protection<00:02:01.760> so<00:02:02.210> it's<00:02:02.360> not<00:02:02.510> straight

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
bit of protection so it's not straight

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:05.440 
bit of protection so it's not straight
down<00:02:03.470> that<00:02:04.430> of<00:02:04.520> course<00:02:04.580> the<00:02:04.880> same<00:02:05.060> with<00:02:05.330> the

playing<00:02:17.120> them<00:02:17.360> in<00:02:17.569> some<00:02:17.870> cases<00:02:18.140> do<00:02:18.530> but

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
playing them in some cases do but

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.120 
playing them in some cases do but

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
about this thing ever really stretching

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.050

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
out or flopping up or getting any kind

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.680 
out or flopping up or getting any kind
of<00:02:26.270> dirt<00:02:27.140> or<00:02:27.320> dust<00:02:27.770> of<00:02:28.580> course<00:02:28.940> durand<00:02:29.360> us<00:02:29.540> are

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
of dirt or dust of course durand us are

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.840 
of dirt or dust of course durand us are
going<00:02:29.780> to<00:02:29.900> find<00:02:30.140> their<00:02:30.590> way<00:02:30.830> through<00:02:31.160> here<00:02:31.580> but

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850
