00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
rate information so this is a two drive

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.760 
rate information so this is a two drive
unit<00:01:14.490> so<00:01:14.880> you<00:01:14.939> can<00:01:15.030> see<00:01:15.180> both<00:01:15.330> of<00:01:15.540> our<00:01:15.659> two<00:01:16.590> disk

particular<00:01:19.200> device<00:01:19.409> ships<00:01:19.799> in<00:01:19.950> raid<00:01:20.159> zero<00:01:20.490> so

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
particular device ships in raid zero so

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.490 
particular device ships in raid zero so
most<00:01:21.240> of<00:01:21.390> our<00:01:21.479> users<00:01:21.659> actually<00:01:22.140> shipped<00:01:22.380> to

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
most of our users actually shipped to

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.899 
most of our users actually shipped to
raid<00:01:22.680> one<00:01:22.979> because<00:01:23.280> it<00:01:23.369> provides<00:01:23.670> you<00:01:23.880> that

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
raid one because it provides you that

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.090 
raid one because it provides you that
disk<00:01:24.659> mirroring<00:01:24.960> redundancy<00:01:25.740> that<00:01:25.770> raids

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
disk mirroring redundancy that raids

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.740 
disk mirroring redundancy that raids
through<00:01:26.310> it<00:01:26.430> is<00:01:26.520> not<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:27.060> protects<00:01:27.450> your<00:01:27.600> data

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.929 
through it is not the protects your data
a<00:01:27.869> lot<00:01:27.990> more<00:01:28.259> so<00:01:28.950> actually<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.340> start<00:01:29.610> we<00:01:29.790> need

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
a lot more so actually to start we need

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.090 
a lot more so actually to start we need
to<00:01:30.030> delete<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.600> existing<00:01:30.720> raid<00:01:31.290> array<00:01:31.590> and

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
to delete the existing raid array and

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.980 
to delete the existing raid array and
all<00:01:32.220> Buffalo<00:01:32.640> Nass<00:01:32.850> devices<00:01:33.329> do<00:01:33.509> ship<00:01:33.750> with<00:01:33.960> a

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
all Buffalo Nass devices do ship with a

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.630 
all Buffalo Nass devices do ship with a
default<00:01:34.380> rate<00:01:34.619> array<00:01:34.860> so<00:01:35.130> you<00:01:35.220> will<00:01:35.369> have<00:01:35.520> to

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
default rate array so you will have to

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.100 
default rate array so you will have to
delete<00:01:35.790> them<00:01:36.119> if<00:01:36.240> you<00:01:36.329> want<00:01:36.509> to<00:01:36.570> change<00:01:36.900> the

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
delete them if you want to change the

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.990 
delete them if you want to change the
mode<00:01:37.320> to<00:01:37.530> do<00:01:37.950> that<00:01:38.100> you<00:01:38.189> will<00:01:38.280> select<00:01:38.520> on<00:01:38.759> the

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
mode to do that you will select on the

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.969 
mode to do that you will select on the
array<00:01:39.450> in<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.780> raid<00:01:40.020> array<00:01:40.290> area<00:01:40.619> so<00:01:40.829> you<00:01:40.920> can

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
array in the raid array area so you can

array in the raid array area so you can
scroll<00:01:41.340> down<00:01:41.400> here<00:01:41.820> and<00:01:41.970> this<00:01:42.390> device<00:01:42.659> has<00:01:42.869> one

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
make sure you definitely want to blow

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.580 
make sure you definitely want to blow
out<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.340> raid<00:02:11.489> array

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
out the raid array

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:14.960 
out the raid array
once<00:02:13.890> doing<00:02:14.190> that<00:02:14.340> it<00:02:14.490> will<00:02:14.550> verify<00:02:14.790> the

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
once doing that it will verify the

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.380 
once doing that it will verify the
number<00:02:15.390> and<00:02:15.510> then<00:02:15.630> it'll<00:02:15.810> start<00:02:16.110> the<00:02:17.390> deletion

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
number and then it'll start the deletion

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.090 
number and then it'll start the deletion
of<00:02:18.450> the<00:02:18.569> rate<00:02:18.750> array<00:02:19.020> once<00:02:19.410> this<00:02:19.530> bleated<00:02:19.950> will

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
of the rate array once this bleated will

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.040 
of the rate array once this bleated will
go<00:02:20.250> ahead<00:02:20.340> and<00:02:20.550> create<00:02:20.819> create<00:02:21.510> a<00:02:21.540> new<00:02:21.690> one<00:02:21.840> so

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
go ahead and create create a new one so

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:33.980 
go ahead and create create a new one so
this<00:02:22.410> process<00:02:22.650> may<00:02:23.010> take<00:02:23.040> about<00:02:23.370> a<00:02:23.490> minute

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.500 

okay<00:02:34.650> now<00:02:34.800> that<00:02:35.010> the<00:02:35.100> process<00:02:35.490> is<00:02:35.670> done<00:02:35.850> you'll

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
okay now that the process is done you'll

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.720 
okay now that the process is done you'll
be<00:02:36.780> sent<00:02:37.290> back<00:02:37.410> to<00:02:37.470> the<00:02:37.650> default<00:02:38.100> folder<00:02:38.490> setup

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
be sent back to the default folder setup

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:39.800 
be sent back to the default folder setup
area<00:02:38.940> and<00:02:39.090> you'll<00:02:39.180> see<00:02:39.330> that<00:02:39.450> there's<00:02:39.630> no

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
area and you'll see that there's no

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.780 
area and you'll see that there's no
shares<00:02:40.140> there<00:02:40.380> anymore<00:02:40.770> you'll<00:02:41.340> also<00:02:41.490> see

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
shares there anymore you'll also see

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.640 
shares there anymore you'll also see
that<00:02:41.820> both<00:02:42.120> disks<00:02:42.570> are<00:02:42.720> in<00:02:42.840> RAW<00:02:43.050> native<00:02:43.440> mode

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
that both disks are in RAW native mode

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.500 
that both disks are in RAW native mode
so<00:02:44.130> now<00:02:44.220> we<00:02:44.280> need<00:02:44.490> to<00:02:44.580> create<00:02:44.760> the<00:02:45.030> raid<00:02:45.210> array

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
so now we need to create the raid array

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.390 
so now we need to create the raid array
which<00:02:46.110> has<00:02:46.230> actually<00:02:46.380> done<00:02:46.680> the<00:02:46.830> same<00:02:47.010> exact

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
which has actually done the same exact

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.400 
which has actually done the same exact
ways<00:02:47.820> we've<00:02:48.060> just<00:02:48.240> deleted<00:02:48.600> it<00:02:48.690> going<00:02:49.260> to<00:02:49.320> the

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
ways we've just deleted it going to the

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.470 
ways we've just deleted it going to the
system<00:02:49.800> tab<00:02:50.070> and<00:02:50.430> then<00:02:50.580> click<00:02:50.880> on<00:02:51.000> the<00:02:51.150> storage

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
system tab and then click on the storage

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.770 
system tab and then click on the storage
tab<00:02:51.870> and<00:02:52.790> you'll<00:02:53.790> see<00:02:53.850> there'll<00:02:54.240> be<00:02:54.270> no<00:02:54.540> raid

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
tab and you'll see there'll be no raid

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.750 
tab and you'll see there'll be no raid
arrays<00:02:55.050> present<00:02:55.620> in<00:02:55.710> the<00:02:55.770> raid<00:02:55.920> array<00:02:56.130> box<00:02:56.400> so

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
arrays present in the raid array box so

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:57.950 
arrays present in the raid array box so
there<00:02:56.880> is<00:02:56.970> this<00:02:57.120> default<00:02:57.540> one<00:02:57.780> that's

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:57.960 
there is this default one that's

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.140 
there is this default one that's
basically<00:02:58.470> not<00:02:58.710> configured<00:02:59.370> so<00:02:59.730> we'll<00:02:59.910> click

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
basically not configured so we'll click

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.850 
basically not configured so we'll click
on<00:03:00.180> this<00:03:00.540> one<00:03:00.720> which<00:03:00.900> is<00:03:01.020> called<00:03:01.230> array<00:03:01.440> 1<00:03:01.710> in

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
on this one which is called array 1 in

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.920 
on this one which is called array 1 in
this<00:03:01.950> case<00:03:02.010> and<00:03:02.940> it'll<00:03:03.120> scan<00:03:03.390> for<00:03:03.660> all<00:03:03.720> of<00:03:03.810> your

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
this case and it'll scan for all of your

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.380 
this case and it'll scan for all of your
disks<00:03:04.440> we'll<00:03:05.010> use<00:03:05.040> this<00:03:05.370> drop-down<00:03:05.760> menu<00:03:06.360> to

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
disks we'll use this drop-down menu to

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.510 
disks we'll use this drop-down menu to
toggle<00:03:06.960> which<00:03:07.320> RAID<00:03:07.560> mode<00:03:07.590> so<00:03:08.100> in<00:03:08.220> this<00:03:08.340> case

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520 
toggle which RAID mode so in this case

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.090 
toggle which RAID mode so in this case
we<00:03:08.670> want<00:03:08.820> to<00:03:08.880> go<00:03:08.940> to<00:03:09.240> raid<00:03:09.780> 1<00:03:10.020> so<00:03:10.320> select<00:03:10.650> raid<00:03:10.860> 1

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
we want to go to raid 1 so select raid 1

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.340 
we want to go to raid 1 so select raid 1
and<00:03:11.340> then<00:03:11.760> we<00:03:11.850> can<00:03:11.970> individually<00:03:12.540> check<00:03:12.810> the

and then we can individually check the

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.830 
and then we can individually check the
disks<00:03:13.770> or<00:03:13.980> we<00:03:14.160> can<00:03:14.310> use<00:03:14.490> this<00:03:14.730> master<00:03:15.030> check

in<00:03:23.280> the<00:03:23.520> random<00:03:24.030> verification<00:03:24.810> code<00:03:25.020> again

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
in the random verification code again

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.220 
in the random verification code again
and<00:03:25.530> it'll<00:03:26.310> take<00:03:26.550> again<00:03:26.850> a<00:03:26.880> moment<00:03:27.420> or<00:03:27.570> two<00:03:27.600> for

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
and it'll take again a moment or two for

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.220 
and it'll take again a moment or two for
the<00:03:28.470> rate<00:03:28.770> array<00:03:29.010> to<00:03:29.070> set<00:03:29.490> up<00:03:29.960> so<00:03:30.960> you'll<00:03:31.110> go

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
the rate array to set up so you'll go

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:41.680 
the rate array to set up so you'll go
through<00:03:31.530> a<00:03:31.560> process<00:03:31.860> to<00:03:32.310> set<00:03:32.520> it<00:03:32.640> up

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:43.660 

so<00:03:42.380> now<00:03:42.470> that<00:03:42.560> rate<00:03:42.830> array<00:03:43.070> is<00:03:43.130> created<00:03:43.370> you

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
so now that rate array is created you

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:45.820 
so now that rate array is created you
can<00:03:43.820> see<00:03:44.030> we<00:03:44.150> have<00:03:44.270> one<00:03:44.540> array<00:03:44.810> that's<00:03:45.140> in<00:03:45.680> this

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:45.830 
can see we have one array that's in this

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:47.590 
can see we have one array that's in this
case<00:03:46.070> just<00:03:46.670> under<00:03:46.850> a<00:03:46.880> terabyte<00:03:47.360> and<00:03:47.510> these

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:47.600 
case just under a terabyte and these

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:48.970 
case just under a terabyte and these
have<00:03:47.780> terabyte<00:03:48.170> drives<00:03:48.470> in<00:03:48.680> them

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
have terabyte drives in them

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:50.740 
have terabyte drives in them
you'll<00:03:49.730> also<00:03:49.880> notice<00:03:50.180> you're<00:03:50.390> back<00:03:50.510> in<00:03:50.660> the

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
you'll also notice you're back in the

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.110 
you'll also notice you're back in the
folder<00:03:51.080> setup<00:03:51.460> because<00:03:52.460> we<00:03:52.580> erased<00:03:52.850> all<00:03:53.030> the

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
folder setup because we erased all the

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.760 
folder setup because we erased all the
information<00:03:53.570> on<00:03:53.690> the<00:03:53.840> array<00:03:54.110> there<00:03:54.440> will<00:03:54.590> not

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:54.770 
information on the array there will not

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:57.220 
information on the array there will not
be<00:03:54.800> any<00:03:55.310> shared<00:03:55.670> data<00:03:55.940> there<00:03:56.180> so<00:03:56.510> may<00:03:57.080> be<00:03:57.140> a

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
be any shared data there so may be a

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.530 
be any shared data there so may be a
good<00:03:57.560> first<00:03:57.800> step<00:03:58.070> would<00:03:58.250> be<00:03:58.310> to<00:03:58.430> create<00:03:58.910> the

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
good first step would be to create the

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.020 
good first step would be to create the
default<00:04:00.140> share<00:04:00.440> again<00:04:00.770> or<00:04:01.040> whatever<00:04:01.640> share
