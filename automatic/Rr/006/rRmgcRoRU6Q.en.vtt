00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
weekend it's given us a clear format in

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.700 
weekend it's given us a clear format in
terms<00:01:50.100> of<00:01:50.329> what<00:01:51.329> we<00:01:51.479> need<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:51.810> do<00:01:51.930> obviously

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
terms of what we need to do obviously

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.179 
terms of what we need to do obviously
we're<00:01:53.189> in<00:01:53.310> line<00:01:53.520> with<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:54.060> IFBB<00:01:54.930> in<00:01:55.740> America
