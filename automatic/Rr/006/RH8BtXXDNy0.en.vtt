the kick drum is eight ply seven
millimeters<00:02:00.930> thick<00:02:01.170> and<00:02:01.200> that<00:02:01.439> a<00:02:01.680> couple

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
millimeters thick and that a couple

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:03.920 
millimeters thick and that a couple
extra<00:02:02.909> plies<00:02:03.119> that<00:02:03.360> a<00:02:03.390> little<00:02:03.600> bit<00:02:03.689> of<00:02:03.780> extra

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
extra plies that a little bit of extra

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.420 
extra plies that a little bit of extra
thickness<00:02:04.229> really<00:02:04.680> gives<00:02:04.860> this<00:02:04.979> kick<00:02:05.219> drum<00:02:05.250> a

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
thickness really gives this kick drum a

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.760 
thickness really gives this kick drum a
nice<00:02:05.670> beef<00:02:06.060> and<00:02:06.299> attack<00:02:06.689> to<00:02:06.930> it<00:02:07.079> we<00:02:07.500> play<00:02:07.649> that

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
nice beef and attack to it we play that

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.430 
nice beef and attack to it we play that
for<00:02:07.920> you<00:02:07.950> right<00:02:08.039> now

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.770 

it's<00:02:12.440> got<00:02:12.560> a<00:02:12.590> really<00:02:12.860> really<00:02:13.069> cool<00:02:13.220> snap<00:02:13.610> and<00:02:13.940> a

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
it's got a really really cool snap and a

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.420 
it's got a really really cool snap and a
good<00:02:15.020> kind<00:02:15.200> of<00:02:15.290> low-end<00:02:15.680> thud<00:02:15.980> to<00:02:16.160> it<00:02:16.250> all<00:02:16.340> at

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
good kind of low-end thud to it all at

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.699 
good kind of low-end thud to it all at
the<00:02:16.520> same<00:02:16.670> time<00:02:16.730> I<00:02:17.240> have<00:02:17.900> just<00:02:18.260> a<00:02:18.350> little<00:02:18.530> bit

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
the same time I have just a little bit

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:20.440 
the same time I have just a little bit
of<00:02:18.890> dampening<00:02:19.340> inside<00:02:19.670> to<00:02:19.850> have<00:02:19.910> the<00:02:20.030> Evans

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
of dampening inside to have the Evans

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.199 
of dampening inside to have the Evans
drum<00:02:21.290> pillow<00:02:21.560> so<00:02:21.890> there's<00:02:22.069> just<00:02:22.250> the<00:02:22.790> resonant

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
drum pillow so there's just the resonant

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:24.340 
drum pillow so there's just the resonant
side<00:02:23.300> in<00:02:23.450> the<00:02:23.510> batter<00:02:23.690> side<00:02:23.959> have<00:02:24.140> just<00:02:24.290> a

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
side in the batter side have just a

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:25.690 
side in the batter side have just a
little<00:02:24.590> the<00:02:24.709> pillows<00:02:24.950> just<00:02:24.980> barely<00:02:25.280> touching

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
little the pillows just barely touching

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.699 
little the pillows just barely touching
the<00:02:25.790> head<00:02:25.940> really<00:02:26.240> and<00:02:26.420> I'm<00:02:27.080> using<00:02:27.260> a<00:02:27.410> Remo

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
the head really and I'm using a Remo

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:30.640 
the head really and I'm using a Remo
power<00:02:27.950> stroke<00:02:28.310> for<00:02:28.970> head<00:02:29.900> on<00:02:30.020> the<00:02:30.110> resident<00:02:30.590> on

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
power stroke for head on the resident on

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.590

the<00:02:30.680> batter<00:02:30.920> side<00:02:31.220> here<00:02:31.489> excuse<00:02:31.880> me<00:02:32.000> and<00:02:32.480> that

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
the batter side here excuse me and that

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:33.880 
the batter side here excuse me and that
combination<00:02:32.870> seems<00:02:33.319> to<00:02:33.410> work<00:02:33.560> really<00:02:33.800> really

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
combination seems to work really really

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:40.479 
combination seems to work really really
well<00:02:34.069> with<00:02:34.190> this<00:02:34.400> kick<00:02:34.580> drum<00:02:39.280> really<00:02:40.280> really

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:40.489 
well with this kick drum really really

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:41.949 
well with this kick drum really really
nice

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
nice

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:43.660 
nice
I<00:02:41.989> really<00:02:42.769> think<00:02:42.860> the<00:02:43.010> Tom's<00:02:43.190> on<00:02:43.370> this<00:02:43.489> kit

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
I really think the Tom's on this kit

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.250 
I really think the Tom's on this kit
because<00:02:43.819> there's<00:02:44.090> a<00:02:44.180> great<00:02:44.420> pitch<00:02:44.690> definition

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
because there's a great pitch definition

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.020 
because there's a great pitch definition
between<00:02:45.590> each<00:02:46.010> of<00:02:46.069> the<00:02:46.340> Tom's<00:02:46.580> so<00:02:46.760> they<00:02:46.879> play

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
between each of the Tom's so they play

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:55.509 
between each of the Tom's so they play
this<00:02:47.150> way<00:02:47.330> right<00:02:47.480> now<00:02:54.099> the<00:02:55.099> Tom's<00:02:55.340> are

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 
this way right now the Tom's are

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:56.920 
this way right now the Tom's are
resonant<00:02:55.940> and<00:02:56.060> they<00:02:56.209> ring<00:02:56.480> in<00:02:56.659> a<00:02:56.720> really

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
resonant and they ring in a really

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.690 
resonant and they ring in a really
Pleasant<00:02:57.409> way<00:02:57.560> but<00:02:57.890> there's<00:02:58.040> a<00:02:58.099> great<00:02:58.400> tone

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
Pleasant way but there's a great tone

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:09.789 
Pleasant way but there's a great tone
between<00:02:59.150> each<00:02:59.269> drum<00:02:59.480> it's<00:02:59.629> nice<00:03:08.140> and<00:03:09.140> like<00:03:09.709> I

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:09.799 
between each drum it's nice and like I

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:11.170 
between each drum it's nice and like I
said<00:03:10.010> earlier<00:03:10.220> the<00:03:10.340> snare<00:03:10.519> drum<00:03:10.730> is<00:03:10.760> really

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180

00:03:22.839 --> 00:03:22.849 
double strokes this really feels really

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:23.559
