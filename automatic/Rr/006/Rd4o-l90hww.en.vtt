00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:15.610
 about how to type our banners 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:19.869
 for our YouTube channels of the 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:22.750
 banners are these good here is to put them 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:25.419
 niko is obviously what makes them worth 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:28.239
 the truth this I remind you that this 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:30.689
 option is only this for partners like this 

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:33.010
 that is not going to be for everyone this tutorial 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.130
 not the first thing we're going to do is 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:39.150
 design our banner in this case not 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:44.790
 I designed it what it is 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:44.790
 I leave the link of your channel 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:55.280
 very well the subject is that they are going to 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:57.890
 design my channel 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:01.489
 they will design it and once they have it 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:05.960
 we are going to go to what is this page 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:08.030
 it's imax jon maps dotcom here we go to 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.659
 do lesson file and we're going to 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:13.679
 select in our banana 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:13.679
 in the case of this one 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.490
 and we will be better 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.290
 I do not know how to tell the truth 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.720
 but let's always from 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.400
 this may take some some 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.830
 minutes 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:34.230
 and it is being processed how to program 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:36.800
 who gets the image of his mana 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:36.800
 we wait 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:44.090
 we hope we hope and we will give 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:46.369
 where it says continuous a exists 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.579
 and here we are here we are going to go to 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:52.189
 where is rectangle you in my case 

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:54.140
 we are projecting what you can 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:56.860

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:00.990

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.750
 and point 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.939
 here I will be absent snake so that what 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:21.019

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:24.780

 a point of dot com 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.430
