00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 the implantation of a breast prosthesis or 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.379
 breast augmentation is one of the 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.410
 more plastic surgery procedures 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.830
 currently carried out with the 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.980
 over time factors such as age 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:19.439
 pregnancy genetics changes in weight 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:22.650
 exposure to sun and gravity may change 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:25.199
 the size and shape of women's breasts 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.510
 that are dissatisfied with the size or 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.660
 had changes in the form of their 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:33.180
 breasts can get firmer breasts and 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.300
 attractive with hand magnifying plasti 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.820
 In this type of procedure the prosthesis is 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.079
 placed in a bag formed in the fabric 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.210
 mammary 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.270
 surgery can increase the size of the 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:48.420
 breasts or leave it symmetrical to return 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.190
 their volume or rebuild them after loss 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.440
 total or partial 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.930
 it is important to remember that the implant 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.039
 breast can not fix breasts 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.680
 falls 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.079
 in such cases usually need one 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.879
 breast augmentation that can be 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:09.390
 carried out in conjunction with this 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:12.360
 procedure approved by fbi a food 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.820
 and drug administration in 2006 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.280
 silicone implants are 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.009
 silicone elastomer filled with 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.049
 silicone gel there is no evidence 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.630
 significant that the implants of 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.909
 silicone prostheses increase the risk of 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.509
 breast cancer tissue disorders 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:32.640
 connective tissue disease or autoimmune 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:36.180
 implants has a variety of forms 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.850
 textures and profiles can be round or 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.310
 anatomical surfaces and have a smooth 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:45.360
 textured the profile of an implant 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:48.840
 may be moderate or high standard 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:51.299
 finally the volume vary in size 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.549
 type style and size of children's 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:56.180
 chosen are determined by your 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:59.340
 lifestyle body contour 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:01.500
 amount of breast tissue and size and 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.540
 desired appearance 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:07.610
 talk to your doctor about the type of 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.610
 ideal breast implant 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.930
 the breast is formed by glands and ducts 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.760
 surrounded by fatty tissue that gives 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:19.150
 her shape and lightness 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:22.150
 the elasticity of the skin also contributes 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.730
 to be formed certain factors like 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:27.790
 pregnancy can affect the 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:30.090
 elasticity of the skin of the breast tissue 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:33.550
 that changes its shape and appearance 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:36.700
 the breast prostheses can be placed 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:39.730
 in two different sub muscular and 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.920
 climb when there in sub muscular 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.100
 the implant is placed partially or 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:47.590
 totally below the pectoral muscle 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:51.010
 against the chest wall in placement 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:54.070
 up the prosthesis positioned below 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.060
 of the breast tissue and above the muscle 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:57.760
 breastplate 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:00.570
 the surgeon can help determine the 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.570
 most suitable type 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:06.520
 the duration of procedures to increase 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:10.120
 usually one or two 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:12.220
 hours before the beginning of the procedure to 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.400
 area to be treated is clean and a 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.989
 anesthetic be administered 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.660
 depending on the surgeon and the nature of the 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:22.209
 procedure is applied anesthesia 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.470
 site with intravenous sedation or 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:26.800
 general anesthesia 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:28.570
 the perry areola incision is one of the most 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.269
 common in the implant procedure 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:34.150
 usually a small amount of 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:36.160
 incision at the perimeter of the halo as the 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:39.070
 the aid of an instrument known as 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:41.769
 portrayed the surgeon makes the incision to 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:42.940
 better access to the tissue below the 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:45.370
 mammary gland 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:48.610
 although the decision is placed in places 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:50.500
 less noticeable its size and appearance 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:52.690
 may vary according to the type and 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:57.870
 implant size the body contour 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:57.870
 of the patient and the surgeon's preference 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.820
 carefully separate the fabric 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.920
 with a device 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:09.440
 least invasive characterization and 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:12.620
 a scalpel to reach the breast area in 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:14.120
 that the bag will be formed with the 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.880
 an instrument known as 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:19.400
 lift and the fingers themselves 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:22.000
 the doctor will create a bag where 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.000
 the implant 

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:42.679
 unlike the saline implants that 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:45.110
 are usually inserted empty of 

00:04:42.679 --> 00:04:49.269
 silicone are filled what 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:49.269
 usually require a larger incision 

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:55.309
 the surgeon will introduce the implant and 

00:04:53.149 --> 00:05:00.919
 to inspect the breasts to maintain 

00:04:55.309 --> 00:05:03.559
 symmetry he can adjust the bag and 

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:07.389
 position of the implant itself to meet the 

00:05:03.559 --> 00:05:07.389
 to the patient's expectations 

00:05:07.749 --> 00:05:14.269
 the incisions are closed consultants in the 

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:17.240
 breast tissue can be used in the future 

00:05:14.269 --> 00:05:17.929
 adhesive or surgical tape to close the 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:20.559
 skin 

00:05:17.929 --> 00:05:23.119
 the surgeon can use future 

00:05:20.559 --> 00:05:24.860
 Indissolubles that will be removed in 

00:05:23.119 --> 00:05:27.740
 seven to ten days 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:30.740
 the scars disappeared slowly 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:34.699
 within a few months but can lead to 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:37.999
 year until it completely disappeared as in 

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:40.279
 the whole surgical procedure to patient 

00:05:37.999 --> 00:05:41.059
 You may experience pain and swelling in the 

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:44.569
 operated 

00:05:41.059 --> 00:05:48.369
 swelling decreased in a few days but 

00:05:44.569 --> 00:05:48.369
 may persist for a few weeks 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:56.919
 the use of a special bra a mesh of 

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:58.240
 helps in the process of 

00:05:56.919 --> 00:06:00.699
 healing 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:03.669
 the compression meshes provide 

00:06:00.699 --> 00:06:06.310
 comfort and support decreases swelling 

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:09.160
 and help maintain the position of 

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:12.300
 implants the importance of using 

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:12.300
 according to medical advice 

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:18.789
 you can probably go back to 

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:21.400
 work after three to seven days of 

00:06:18.789 --> 00:06:23.470
 procedure is however important. 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:25.630
 avoid intense activities and 

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:29.110
 weight loading for three or four 

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:31.659
 weeks otherwise the process of 

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:33.940
 healing will be more time-consuming and 

00:06:31.659 --> 00:06:36.669
 implants may be damaged 

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:38.530
 the definitive result will be visible 

00:06:36.669 --> 00:06:41.050
 after the implants are 

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:44.229
 and the swelling has disappeared 

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:46.270
 it is important to remember that the 

00:06:44.229 --> 00:06:48.729
 breast shape will continue to suffer 

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:51.430
 changes over time 

00:06:48.729 --> 00:06:53.289
 However, the results of the 

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:54.340
 breast implants are usually 

00:06:53.289 --> 00:06:55.930
 lasting 

00:06:54.340 --> 00:07:00.389
 which means that the breasts 

00:06:55.930 --> 00:07:00.389
 remained firm for many years
