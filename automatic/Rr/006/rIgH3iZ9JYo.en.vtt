00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:26.710
 and to me 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:35.660
 friends as they are I am Luis that of that 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.449
 we are already here we continue 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.820
 the intermediate intermediate tv team 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:42.829
 here in new york 'and we are doing 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.690
 a direct comparison with the samsung 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:47.089
 galaxy s 4 that you can see 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.920
 here that the truth is that the s4 

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:52.850
 instrument was a team that amazed me 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:55.250
 for the quality of your screen and the 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.109
 truth is that I did not trust much the 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.329
 team but when I saw the screen I 

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:02.119
 I liked it very much I want that 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:05.390
 you see that at this moment the 

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:08.240
 team the samsung galaxy s 4 is in its 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.860
 maximum brightness there is no issue of 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.380
 saving energy or something like that 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:15.799
 is not activated and we see here we do the 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:19.100
 direct comparison with the screen 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:21.619
 the g2 that is equal to 100% and without the 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.530
 automatic mode and you can see the 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:28.130
 direct comparison of how it was sold 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:30.799
 here I see much more quality much more 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:33.530
 detail in the g2 we can see also 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:36.110
 have the comparison of how they look in the 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:38.570
 back here you can 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:42.680
 see if I can rate what 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:45.229
 here I feel that the casing of the s 4 is 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:48.200
 fills less let's say spots by 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:50.000
 fingers but well we can see here that if 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.170
 can stay as a kind of 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.310
 fingerprint inside d 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:59.920
 the 4 s camera here we see for example 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:03.970
 that in this sense then good at the end 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:05.259
 it's plastic is an element that also 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.080
 it has certain spots but when in 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:10.590
 theory is not going to scratch we see it here in 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.270
 the middle button on the back 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:16.120
 here obviously there is no such button in the 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.800
 back of the s 4 this button the 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.130
 main control button is this 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:23.900
 side on the sides of in this case the 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:27.140
 g2 we do not see anything 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:29.150
 here is the entry of the sim 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.140
 there's the sim here are some of 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:34.930
 the microphones in the part 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:37.150
 but really there's nothing the speakers 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:41.530
 we find them here 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:46.850
 in the back to like the 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:49.400
 jack for hearing aids 3.5 and good 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:51.590
 what you owe in this case also the 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.470
 microusb connector will be here right 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.820
 where is this security element 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.950
 but good to you can have here 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:01.400
 the direct comparison at this time 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:03.110
 when the star is the g2 that good 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.850
 we have talked a lot we will try to 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:07.490
 be trying to give you our 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:10.220
 impressions but good at a glance in 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:11.750
 this first team view I think that 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.930
 it looks like a one option an option 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:19.460
 powerful a quad-core processor of 2.62 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:21.470
 travel 5.2 screen full hd and good 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:24.230
 the most interesting part is a team 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:27.020
 that will possibly come in first 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:30.980
 place with telcel because good because it's 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:32.900
 a 4g team and that obviously good 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.850
 you can get much out of the network 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.400
 of this operator in mexico 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:39.680
 I am luis gg we are still here in new 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.430
 york 'at the launch of the gym g22 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.430
 we continue
