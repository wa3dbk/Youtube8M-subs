up<00:00:58.869> here<00:00:59.049> at<00:00:59.110> where<00:00:59.229> it<00:00:59.290> says<00:00:59.409> a<00:00:59.589> and<00:00:59.619> C<00:00:59.979> so

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:00.549 
up here at where it says a and C so

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:02.100 
up here at where it says a and C so
right<00:01:00.760> now<00:01:00.970> when<00:01:01.449> it's<00:01:01.570> selected<00:01:01.989> to<00:01:02.080> a

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:02.110 
right now when it's selected to a

right now when it's selected to a
anything<00:01:03.010> I<00:01:03.280> do<00:01:03.339> on<00:01:03.820> the<00:01:04.000> controller<00:01:04.390> will

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:05.049 
anything I do on the controller will

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:08.789 
anything I do on the controller will
manipulate<00:01:05.680> channel<00:01:06.670> a<00:01:06.820> so<00:01:07.780> it's<00:01:08.290> on<00:01:08.409> a<00:01:08.439> and

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:08.799 
manipulate channel a so it's on a and

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:11.550 
manipulate channel a so it's on a and
I'm<00:01:08.860> playing<00:01:09.280> with<00:01:09.430> the<00:01:09.549> volume<00:01:10.380> I'll<00:01:11.380> play

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
I'm playing with the volume I'll play

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:17.230 
I'm playing with the volume I'll play
with<00:01:11.680> the<00:01:11.799> pitch<00:01:12.900> EQ

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.130 

I<00:01:17.360> should<00:01:18.049> play<00:01:18.200> some<00:01:18.380> audio

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.980 

speed<00:01:21.740> it<00:01:21.830> up<00:01:21.920> a<00:01:21.980> bit<00:01:22.270> slow<00:01:23.270> it<00:01:23.390> down

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.250 

but<00:01:26.530> now<00:01:26.650> if<00:01:26.740> I<00:01:26.830> want<00:01:27.010> to<00:01:27.070> switch<00:01:27.280> over<00:01:27.520> to<00:01:27.670> see

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:28.260 
but now if I want to switch over to see

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:33.690 
but now if I want to switch over to see
and<00:01:29.260> do<00:01:29.380> the<00:01:29.470> same<00:01:29.650> thing

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:40.850 

I<00:01:33.990> have<00:01:34.990> all<00:01:35.140> the<00:01:35.259> controls<00:01:35.619> there<00:01:35.920> EQ

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.860 

so<00:01:41.400> this<00:01:41.730> is<00:01:41.880> strictly<00:01:42.120> a<00:01:42.300> MIDI<00:01:42.630> controller

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:42.870 
so this is strictly a MIDI controller

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.950 
so this is strictly a MIDI controller
you<00:01:43.680> will<00:01:43.860> need<00:01:44.070> a<00:01:44.100> sound<00:01:44.370> card<00:01:44.550> we<00:01:45.510> have<00:01:45.720> this

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
you will need a sound card we have this

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.190 
you will need a sound card we have this
tr1<00:01:46.470> connected<00:01:47.190> to<00:01:47.310> our<00:01:47.460> tank<00:01:47.850> at<00:01:48.270> our<00:01:48.420> Vai<00:01:48.750> 80

which is the red sound card unit next to

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:53.360 
which is the red sound card unit next to
it<00:01:51.990> you<00:01:52.470> could<00:01:52.620> see<00:01:52.770> why<00:01:52.890> it's<00:01:53.070> called<00:01:53.100> the

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:53.370 
it you could see why it's called the

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:57.740 
it you could see why it's called the
tank<00:01:53.610> it<00:01:53.790> looks<00:01:54.000> like<00:01:54.150> a<00:01:54.180> tank<00:01:55.340> this<00:01:56.340> has<00:01:56.750> four

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
tank it looks like a tank this has four

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.050 
tank it looks like a tank this has four
