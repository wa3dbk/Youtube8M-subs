tagged it with hashtag minecraft xbla

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.770 
tagged it with hashtag minecraft xbla
exactly<00:03:05.040> why<00:03:05.310> this<00:03:05.370> is<00:03:05.790> is<00:03:06.000> slightly<00:03:06.540> beyond

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
exactly why this is is slightly beyond

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.270 
exactly why this is is slightly beyond
me<00:03:06.930> maybe<00:03:07.170> it's<00:03:07.290> coming<00:03:07.530> out<00:03:07.590> later<00:03:07.710> piss<00:03:08.010> free

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
me maybe it's coming out later piss free

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.620 
me maybe it's coming out later piss free
but<00:03:08.670> they<00:03:08.760> haven't<00:03:08.910> actually<00:03:09.090> mentioned<00:03:09.540> it

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
but they haven't actually mentioned it

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.100 
but they haven't actually mentioned it
at<00:03:09.810> all<00:03:10.080> so<00:03:10.470> I<00:03:11.030> think<00:03:12.030> this<00:03:12.330> is<00:03:12.390> the<00:03:12.600> staff<00:03:12.840> them

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
at all so I think this is the staff them

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:14.480 
at all so I think this is the staff them
trying<00:03:13.380> to<00:03:13.470> make<00:03:13.650> more<00:03:13.890> unique<00:03:14.250> things

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:14.490 
trying to make more unique things

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:17.420 
trying to make more unique things
reached<00:03:14.790> a<00:03:15.000> platform<00:03:15.810> because<00:03:16.500> right<00:03:17.220> now<00:03:17.250> all

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
reached a platform because right now all

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.060 
reached a platform because right now all
of<00:03:17.880> the<00:03:18.200> consolations<00:03:19.200> or<00:03:19.380> for<00:03:19.590> from<00:03:19.770> that<00:03:19.920> is

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
of the consolations or for from that is

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.130 
of the consolations or for from that is
all<00:03:20.730> set<00:03:20.970> to<00:03:21.180> be<00:03:21.330> really<00:03:21.690> pretty<00:03:21.810> much<00:03:21.990> the

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
all set to be really pretty much the

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:23.930 
all set to be really pretty much the
same<00:03:22.350> besides<00:03:22.830> graphical<00:03:23.430> and<00:03:23.640> world

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
same besides graphical and world

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.120 
same besides graphical and world
differences<00:03:24.480> and<00:03:24.660> maybe<00:03:25.620> for<00:03:25.920> whatever

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
differences and maybe for whatever

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:27.980 
differences and maybe for whatever
reason<00:03:26.460> they<00:03:26.610> want<00:03:26.970> to<00:03:27.270> you<00:03:27.630> know<00:03:27.750> add<00:03:27.960> a

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:27.990 
reason they want to you know add a

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:29.870 
reason they want to you know add a
little<00:03:28.170> bit<00:03:28.290> variety<00:03:28.980> for<00:03:29.220> some<00:03:29.400> reason<00:03:29.760> I

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
little bit variety for some reason I

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.420 
little bit variety for some reason I
don't<00:03:30.390> entirely<00:03:30.870> know<00:03:31.050> what<00:03:31.680> they<00:03:31.890> add<00:03:32.160> that

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
don't entirely know what they add that

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.370 
don't entirely know what they add that
unless<00:03:33.120> maybe<00:03:33.390> it's<00:03:33.570> just<00:03:33.630> a<00:03:33.900> thing<00:03:34.170> where

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
unless maybe it's just a thing where

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:35.870 
unless maybe it's just a thing where
they<00:03:34.500> want<00:03:34.680> you<00:03:34.770> to<00:03:34.890> buy<00:03:34.980> all<00:03:35.130> four<00:03:35.310> editions<00:03:35.700> I

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
they want you to buy all four editions I

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:36.770 
they want you to buy all four editions I
don't<00:03:36.180> think<00:03:36.240> it's<00:03:36.450> a<00:03:36.540> great<00:03:36.660> thing

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
don't think it's a great thing

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.750 
don't think it's a great thing
personally<00:03:37.170> I<00:03:37.590> would<00:03:37.980> like<00:03:38.250> for<00:03:38.280> all<00:03:38.490> four<00:03:38.730> to

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
personally I would like for all four to

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.970 
personally I would like for all four to
be<00:03:38.910> the<00:03:39.210> same<00:03:39.420> besides<00:03:40.020> the<00:03:40.500> technical

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
be the same besides the technical

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.100 
be the same besides the technical
limitations<00:03:41.490> unless<00:03:42.480> it's<00:03:42.660> literally

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
limitations unless it's literally

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.050 
limitations unless it's literally
holding<00:03:43.410> one<00:03:43.590> platform<00:03:43.830> back<00:03:44.250> to<00:03:44.580> not<00:03:44.850> put<00:03:45.000> it

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
holding one platform back to not put it

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.150 
holding one platform back to not put it
on<00:03:45.150> for<00:03:45.300> all<00:03:45.450> I'd<00:03:46.230> really<00:03:46.620> like<00:03:46.740> to<00:03:46.800> see<00:03:46.980> that

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
on for all I'd really like to see that

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.890 
on for all I'd really like to see that
but<00:03:47.310> it<00:03:47.459> doesn't<00:03:47.880> seem<00:03:48.090> like<00:03:48.150> that's<00:03:48.540> the

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
but it doesn't seem like that's the

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.710 
but it doesn't seem like that's the
forge<00:03:49.170> a<00:03:49.380> vision<00:03:49.740> so<00:03:50.010> far<00:03:50.360> this<00:03:51.360> obviously

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
forge a vision so far this obviously

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.060 
forge a vision so far this obviously
could<00:03:51.900> change<00:03:52.170> but<00:03:52.350> right<00:03:52.530> now<00:03:52.709> it's<00:03:52.890> not

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
could change but right now it's not

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:55.970 
could change but right now it's not
sounding<00:03:53.310> too<00:03:53.610> great<00:03:53.850> so<00:03:54.150> um<00:03:54.590> new<00:03:55.590> text<00:03:55.800> pack

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
sounding too great so um new text pack

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.130 
sounding too great so um new text pack
is<00:03:56.190> coming<00:03:56.640> in<00:03:56.880> two<00:03:57.180> days<00:03:57.300> one<00:03:57.510> more<00:03:57.660> time<00:03:57.840> it's

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140

you know it's a it's a cool exciting
thing<00:04:04.110> I<00:04:04.320> might<00:04:04.709> you<00:04:04.800> know<00:04:04.830> sure<00:04:05.010> my<00:04:05.130> let's

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
thing I might you know sure my let's

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:06.440 
thing I might you know sure my let's
play<00:04:05.370> rolling<00:04:05.670> again<00:04:05.880> because<00:04:06.150> that<00:04:06.270> seems

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
play rolling again because that seems

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.870 
play rolling again because that seems
big<00:04:06.570> thing<00:04:07.110> ever<00:04:07.380> I<00:04:07.770> might<00:04:08.459> also<00:04:08.490> do<00:04:08.850> a

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
big thing ever I might also do a

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.400 
big thing ever I might also do a
comparison<00:04:09.300> of<00:04:09.480> all<00:04:09.630> text<00:04:09.930> packs<00:04:10.080> to<00:04:10.230> date

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
comparison of all text packs to date

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:11.840 
comparison of all text packs to date
because<00:04:10.590> this<00:04:10.860> will<00:04:10.980> be<00:04:11.130> like<00:04:11.250> the<00:04:11.400> eighth<00:04:11.550> one

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
because this will be like the eighth one

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:13.130 
because this will be like the eighth one
and<00:04:12.030> it<00:04:12.090> could<00:04:12.300> you<00:04:12.420> know<00:04:12.510> divided<00:04:12.780> into<00:04:13.080> a

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 
and it could you know divided into a

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.980 
and it could you know divided into a
screen<00:04:13.440> nicely<00:04:13.830> and<00:04:14.760> I'll<00:04:15.480> do<00:04:15.750> some<00:04:15.930> other

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:15.990 
screen nicely and I'll do some other

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:17.510 
screen nicely and I'll do some other
