side stars that are missing right now

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.040 
side stars that are missing right now
because<00:00:33.059> that<00:00:33.390> they<00:00:33.510> were<00:00:33.570> leaning<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:34.020> little

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
because that they were leaning a little

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.709 
because that they were leaning a little
bit<00:00:34.380> into<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:34.770> cake<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:35.309> I<00:00:36.030> decided<00:00:36.570> to

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
bit into the cake and I decided to

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.290 
bit into the cake and I decided to
remove<00:00:36.960> them<00:00:37.200> until<00:00:37.590> it's<00:00:38.219> time<00:00:38.520> to<00:00:38.550> serve<00:00:39.090> the

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
remove them until it's time to serve the

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.340 
remove them until it's time to serve the
cake<00:00:40.910> the<00:00:41.910> soccer<00:00:42.180> ball<00:00:42.300> is<00:00:42.629> actually<00:00:43.110> a

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
cake the soccer ball is actually a

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:49.130 
cake the soccer ball is actually a
styrofoam<00:00:44.250> and<00:00:44.579> I<00:00:45.270> cut<00:00:46.020> out<00:00:47.840> hexagons<00:00:48.840> and

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
styrofoam and I cut out hexagons and

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.100 
styrofoam and I cut out hexagons and
black<00:00:49.649> Pentagon's<00:00:50.610> and<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.360> soccer<00:00:51.570> ball<00:00:51.690> was

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
black Pentagon's and the soccer ball was

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.450 
black Pentagon's and the soccer ball was
one<00:00:52.289> of<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.469> hardest<00:00:52.590> things<00:00:53.010> I've<00:00:53.190> ever<00:00:53.219> had

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
one of the hardest things I've ever had

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.959 
one of the hardest things I've ever had
to<00:00:53.610> make<00:00:53.960> the<00:00:54.960> shapes<00:00:55.230> did<00:00:55.500> not<00:00:55.770> fit<00:00:56.129> exactly

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
to make the shapes did not fit exactly

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.910 
to make the shapes did not fit exactly
the<00:00:57.539> way<00:00:57.660> that<00:00:57.690> they<00:00:57.930> were<00:00:57.989> supposed<00:00:58.440> to<00:00:58.559> so<00:00:58.890> I

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
the way that they were supposed to so I

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.970 
the way that they were supposed to so I
I<00:00:59.340> mean<00:00:59.699> I<00:00:59.910> did<00:01:00.539> have<00:01:00.780> quite<00:01:01.590> a<00:01:01.739> bit<00:01:01.829> of

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
I mean I did have quite a bit of

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.620 
I mean I did have quite a bit of
problems<00:01:03.559> constructing<00:01:04.559> that<00:01:04.739> soccer<00:01:05.010> ball

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
problems constructing that soccer ball

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.700 
problems constructing that soccer ball
there's<00:01:06.630> really<00:01:06.840> not<00:01:07.049> too<00:01:07.110> much<00:01:07.350> I<00:01:07.530> can<00:01:07.680> say

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
there's really not too much I can say

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.429 
there's really not too much I can say
about<00:01:07.979> this<00:01:08.220> cake<00:01:08.540> it's<00:01:09.540> my<00:01:09.750> first<00:01:09.960> time<00:01:10.140> using

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
about this cake it's my first time using

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.310 
about this cake it's my first time using
ganache<00:01:10.890> under<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.460> cake<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:12.000> I<00:01:12.630> did<00:01:13.020> make<00:01:13.290> a

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
ganache under the cake and I did make a

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.990 
ganache under the cake and I did make a
slight<00:01:13.920> mistake<00:01:14.189> with<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.760> ratios<00:01:15.650> so<00:01:16.650> I<00:01:17.610> I

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
slight mistake with the ratios so I I

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.090 
slight mistake with the ratios so I I
now<00:01:18.540> know<00:01:18.780> for<00:01:18.990> next<00:01:19.140> time<00:01:19.320> and<00:01:19.740> that's<00:01:19.890> what

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
now know for next time and that's what

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.530 
now know for next time and that's what
this<00:01:20.220> is<00:01:20.280> all<00:01:20.490> about<00:01:20.549> for<00:01:20.970> me<00:01:21.000> it's<00:01:21.270> just<00:01:21.420> a

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
this is all about for me it's just a

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.249 
this is all about for me it's just a
learning<00:01:21.689> curve<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:22.619> I<00:01:23.720> now<00:01:24.720> know<00:01:24.960> for<00:01:25.140> next

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
learning curve and I now know for next

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.679 
learning curve and I now know for next
time<00:01:25.439> how<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:25.799> fix<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.220> ratio<00:01:26.549> and<00:01:26.970> I<00:01:27.420> mean<00:01:27.570> it

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
time how to fix the ratio and I mean it

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.810 
time how to fix the ratio and I mean it
worked<00:01:27.810> out<00:01:28.049> okay<00:01:28.110> it<00:01:28.590> was<00:01:28.710> a<00:01:28.740> lot<00:01:29.159> softer<00:01:29.460> than

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
worked out okay it was a lot softer than

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.510 
worked out okay it was a lot softer than
I<00:01:29.880> had<00:01:30.119> wanted<00:01:30.329> it<00:01:30.570> to<00:01:30.689> be<00:01:30.810> it<00:01:31.799> didn't<00:01:32.159> form

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
I had wanted it to be it didn't form

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.590 
I had wanted it to be it didn't form
that<00:01:32.759> hard<00:01:33.090> shell<00:01:33.450> so<00:01:34.670> you<00:01:35.670> know<00:01:35.790> I<00:01:35.820> just<00:01:36.240> went

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
that hard shell so you know I just went

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.179 
that hard shell so you know I just went
with<00:01:36.659> it<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:37.079> and<00:01:37.350> I<00:01:37.650> think<00:01:37.829> it<00:01:37.920> turned<00:01:38.100> out

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
with it and and I think it turned out

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:43.120 
with it and and I think it turned out
okay<00:01:38.610> it's<00:01:39.270> a<00:01:39.390> little<00:01:39.810> lumpy<00:01:40.020> in<00:01:40.560> areas<00:01:41.460> but

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
okay it's a little lumpy in areas but

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.670 
okay it's a little lumpy in areas but
it's<00:01:44.130> okay<00:01:44.490> first<00:01:45.299> time<00:01:45.509> using<00:01:45.720> a<00:01:45.899> nosh<00:01:46.049> that

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
it's okay first time using a nosh that

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.420 
it's okay first time using a nosh that
was<00:01:47.159> my<00:01:47.310> first<00:01:47.610> bow<00:01:48.479> up<00:01:48.840> there<00:01:49.100> first<00:01:50.100> dress
