web hosting plan you're going to need a

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.480 
web hosting plan you're going to need a
dedicated<00:01:18.080> server<00:01:19.080> because<00:01:19.500> what<00:01:20.040> happens<00:01:20.369> is

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
dedicated server because what happens is

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.399 
dedicated server because what happens is
when<00:01:20.759> people<00:01:21.090> start<00:01:21.390> signing<00:01:21.930> up<00:01:22.200> for

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
to take up a lot of space on your server

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.080 
to take up a lot of space on your server
so<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.200> standard<00:01:28.439> web<00:01:28.860> host<00:01:29.159> is<00:01:29.460> not<00:01:29.820> going<00:01:29.970> to

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
so the standard web host is not going to

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.600 
so the standard web host is not going to
be<00:01:30.150> enough<00:01:30.329> space<00:01:30.540> and<00:01:31.079> bandwidth<00:01:31.860> for<00:01:32.310> a<00:01:32.369> site

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
like that so you're going to need a

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.429 
like that so you're going to need a

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
creating sites like this so you can't

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.620 
creating sites like this so you can't
just<00:02:23.260> open<00:02:23.410> a<00:02:23.590> front<00:02:23.890> page<00:02:24.100> or<00:02:24.490> dreamweaver<00:02:25.090> or

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
just open a front page or dreamweaver or

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.720 
just open a front page or dreamweaver or
home<00:02:25.870> site<00:02:26.170> or<00:02:26.320> coffee<00:02:26.530> cup<00:02:26.890> and<00:02:27.040> expect<00:02:27.670> to

home site or coffee cup and expect to

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.940 
home site or coffee cup and expect to
create<00:02:28.090> a<00:02:28.120> site<00:02:28.420> similar<00:02:29.050> to<00:02:29.260> myspace<00:02:29.650> it<00:02:29.800> just

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
create a site similar to myspace it just

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.290 
create a site similar to myspace it just
doesn't<00:02:30.220> work<00:02:30.340> like<00:02:30.550> that<00:02:30.610> because<00:02:30.910> of<00:02:31.270> the

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
doesn't work like that because of the

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.230 
doesn't work like that because of the
type<00:02:31.540> of<00:02:31.570> programming<00:02:32.110> that<00:02:32.710> is<00:02:33.070> involved<00:02:33.580> so

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:34.240 
type of programming that is involved so

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.450 
type of programming that is involved so
before<00:02:34.690> you<00:02:34.960> jump<00:02:35.350> into<00:02:35.500> this<00:02:35.830> I<00:02:35.980> just<00:02:36.220> want

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:36.460 
before you jump into this I just want

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.790 
before you jump into this I just want
you<00:02:36.730> to<00:02:37.060> think<00:02:37.420> about<00:02:37.780> that<00:02:37.930> it's<00:02:38.560> not

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
you to think about that it's not

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.100 
you to think about that it's not
something<00:02:39.400> that's<00:02:39.670> easy<00:02:39.910> to<00:02:40.300> create<00:02:40.720> if

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
something that's easy to create if

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.410 
something that's easy to create if
you're<00:02:41.500> not<00:02:41.620> going<00:02:41.920> to<00:02:42.040> learn<00:02:42.280> how<00:02:42.970> to<00:02:43.030> create

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
you're not going to learn how to create

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.260 
you're not going to learn how to create
or<00:02:43.840> cold<00:02:44.230> or<00:02:44.500> program<00:02:44.980> these<00:02:45.550> sites<00:02:45.850> yourself

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 
or cold or program these sites yourself

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:47.340 
or cold or program these sites yourself
and<00:02:46.480> you're<00:02:46.570> going<00:02:46.660> to<00:02:46.720> have<00:02:46.840> to<00:02:46.930> pay<00:02:47.080> someone

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
and you're going to have to pay someone

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.640 
and you're going to have to pay someone
and<00:02:47.820> you<00:02:48.820> can<00:02:48.970> easily<00:02:49.090> pay<00:02:49.420> someone<00:02:49.900> for<00:02:50.320> 25

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
and you can easily pay someone for 25
