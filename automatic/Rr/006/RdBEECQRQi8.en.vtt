 Chickpea glasses stewed to 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:55.540

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.010

 Then we grate a potato 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.670
 average size 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.399
 Y 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.759
 we mix all the ingredients 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:24.740
 crumbling all the chickpeas for 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:27.310
 prevent whole pieces from being left 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.310
 i 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:38.039
 Once this is done, we add 5 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.039
 tablespoons of raw sunflower seeds 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:45.210
 to 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:48.710
 we will also put a spoonful or a 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.710
 vegetable broth pill 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.060
 ah 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.679
 to give more consistency to the mass 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:08.109
 add 2 slices of toast or 

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:08.109
 dry and we are crumbling it 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.550
 ah 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.320
 ah 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.739
 ah 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:32.680
 then we will add about 4 or 5 tablespoons 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:36.080
 of oil and we keep mixing and 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:38.690
 crumbling the ingredients 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.319
 to 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.409
 to 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:42.409
 i 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:58.069
 then we will add a couple of 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.069
 Spoons of sweet paprika 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.010
 yes 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.519
 i 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.940
 here we see how the dough goes to 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:16.110
 give it a better color and flavor and 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:18.280
 we will add 5 tablespoons of soy sauce 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:20.500
 normally this sauce comes with 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:24.960
 quite salt so we should have it in 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.960
 account for then not spend with salt 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.510
 ah 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.079
 i 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:39.079
 ah 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.880
 the time has come to add a 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.730
 handful of oatmeal flakes so that 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:50.840
 absorb moisture and enrich our 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.840
 hamburger with more nutrients 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:59.680
 We heat the oven to about 200 degrees and 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:02.870
 prepare the tray with baking paper 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.959
 so that the hamburgers do not stick 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:04.959
 i 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.650
 once arrived at this point 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.020
 we will start to form our 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.780
 burgers 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:15.850
 We must be careful that which 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:18.250
 are well formed and have a thickness 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:20.970
 acceptable so that they do not break and a 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.970
 once baked 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:38.610
 we put them in the oven for 20 30 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:40.970
 minutes according to the oven that is 200 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:40.970
 degrees 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:47.090
 Once baked we take out the tray and 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:48.510
 we prepare to give you the last 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:50.570
 I touched 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:50.570
 to 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:55.020
 do not 

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:07.370
 in a bowl previously prepared with 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:08.180
 raw and cold oil we wet our 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:11.360
 burgers 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:14.600
 in this way we get a food 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:17.060
 nutritious and healthy since we have not 

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:19.210
 believed and keeps a good look and 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.210
 taste 

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:24.730
 this burger we can prepare 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:27.430
 different ways either to go from 

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:30.510
 picnic or to eat at home we have a 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:30.510
 practical solution 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:33.690
 all right 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:41.020
 accompanied with a good salad 

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:41.020
 we have a full plate good profit 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:44.830
 ah 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:44.830
 i 

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:57.369
 Y 

00:05:54.369 --> 00:05:57.369
