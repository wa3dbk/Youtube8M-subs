00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:06.340
 hi my name is q strong warming 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:11.290
 I have long wanted to take off 

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:17.730
 I'm a video channel how I started telecom 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:17.730
 carburetors now you 'll see show 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.810
 on line we have the very first sat 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.970
 site cover functionality to break away from 1 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:31.270
 score 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:34.110
 You see for yourself then there are even markirovochka 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:38.400
 no matter 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:42.250
 I think it will be clear that the apartment when 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:44.430
 like all people I wanted a little bit 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:49.809
 increase power characteristics 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:55.030
 carburetor and I decided to cut it like 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:57.070
 that's right and should not happen 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.020
 just like cylinder cylinder shaped 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:03.220
 diffusers 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.760
 Well, for example a choir diffuser 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.979
 cut 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.450
 see for yourself he must be like him 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:09.100
 oak as it really is 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:15.310
 manufacturing plant 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:18.430
 but here a little bit is increased from the edge 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:21.910
 wall diffusers smooth under the cone 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:25.200
 was shot in one millimeter naturally 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:27.819
 already standard 0 1 carburetor 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:34.929
 23 mm diffuser has been increased to 

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:39.450
 25 and with throttle 36 on 36 

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:39.450
 like the secondary chamber 0 7 carburetor 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.380
 here 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:47.920
 farther farther farther these words themselves 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:51.590
 already going to work 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:53.330
 not just rescued me on true racing 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:02:01.550
 it was several times just superfluous 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:02:04.700
 molded went on 6 there is no stove and a friend 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:08.390
 were giving it to the race functionally 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:11.290
 myself on the auto classics showed classic 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:17.570
 very good characteristics 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:22.700
 that here so here and still with us like everyone 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:26.920
 people didn't want anything more I did here 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:31.760
 such a carburetor 0 1 carburetor here 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:36.130
 call screw adjusting and with 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:38.040
 mixing chamber from the machine model 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:41.579
 here 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.980
 such installed diffusers little diffuser 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:48.540
 pgs again see what 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:54.569
 and double elephant from k-151 carburetors 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:58.439
 picard painted pretty truth 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:03:03.989
 Looks and throttle at us 

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:07.430
 here you see now 38 millimeters on 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:11.569
 this carburetors were borrowed from 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:14.939
 aviator 07 secondary camera here already 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:17.430
 carburetor state sung 38 years in 

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:19.970
 which I could not find in nature on 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:23.609
 back on carburetors 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:25.889
 K-129 and 133 single-chamber such 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:27.120
 the carburetor is ancient and there is more on when 

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:30.180
 grass 156 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:32.819
 capital cameras 38 well I found it was necessary 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:37.829
 make their summit mom at the factory 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:39.629
 under 78 degrees 78 degrees with us 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:51.560
 manufactured flaps exactly like 

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:51.560
 relies for yourself see further with us 

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:56.159
 05 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:04:02.220
 well it does not matter already 0 5 does not look like 

00:03:56.159 --> 00:04:05.639
 see for yourself the usual carburetor here 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:07.470
 which was darling there 26 diffusers 

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:10.040
 Well, here, in principle, there was no further 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:13.639
 cut the meaning just the walls are hidden and 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:17.130
 I had to make typhus patterns separately 

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:18.850
 naturally you could roam here 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:22.560
 already see 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:24.850
 few diffusers worth 10 present 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:29.010
 the bedside table is so horizontal with 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:29.010
 holes zigzag drilling 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:36.400
 borrow the carburetor system with my 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:38.670
 one such american single chamber 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:41.770
 such a big throttle 

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:44.650
 I do not know what to call well who wants youtube 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:50.580
 and see the weight in one carburetor too 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:50.580
 we have rain and dampers 40 millimeters 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:55.780
 diffusers 30 millimeters and how 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:05:00.510
 relies step there is present in 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:03.400
 the beginning of the diffuser for the desired twists 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:05.500
 the system is full run was removed in volume 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:09.000
 that you don't need a car 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:13.930
 carburetor made for the summer version 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:19.150
 so here so here and again double 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:22.720
 elephant from k-151 carburetor to 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:28.510
 there is no hole further we have a carburetor 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:32.530
 Solex favorite I wanted from Alex 

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:37.639
 finalize this 80 don't remember what that 

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:40.719
 consider it seems the operator suffix here 

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:43.759
 I first found a carburetor in the garbage 

00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:49.699
 Solex cut in half barbaric 

00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:53.870
 In a way, I understood that like everyone else 

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:58.629
 I know why and cast cylinders shaped 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:06:04.219
 made and do them I don't know but here I am 

00:05:58.629 --> 00:06:08.749
 agreed with the turner and the scheme which 

00:06:04.219 --> 00:06:09.650
 did well in principle how was it clear and 

00:06:08.749 --> 00:06:12.020
 it is clear that 

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:12.830
 the diffuser should have been present as 

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:14.659
 and relies 

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:17.349
 factory because the system 

00:06:14.659 --> 00:06:20.469
 cooperation must be present 

00:06:17.349 --> 00:06:24.919
 low pressure below the diffuser boundary 

00:06:20.469 --> 00:06:27.139
 as I understand, well, of course 

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:29.199
 just the diffusers were uninteresting before 

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:32.539
 because the well-known procedure 

00:06:29.199 --> 00:06:36.469
 so I decided to increase and mixing 

00:06:32.539 --> 00:06:38.930
 here's the camera as you see here it is with us 

00:06:36.469 --> 00:06:44.169
 large 36 millimeters 

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:48.979
 both sides here and of course we 

00:06:44.169 --> 00:06:54.310
 let's go became a little gasoline and 

00:06:48.979 --> 00:06:54.310
 card diffuser nose 25 millimeters 

00:06:54.370 --> 00:07:00.529
 the compiler was checked in principle 

00:06:57.129 --> 00:07:02.750
 no wire like some 

00:07:00.529 --> 00:07:05.120
 carburetors produce sold in 

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:08.330
 online store and read comments 

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:11.779
 there are such talk about them and passionate 

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:17.379
 things so so that's okay principle all on 

00:07:11.779 --> 00:07:17.379
 this is goodbye
