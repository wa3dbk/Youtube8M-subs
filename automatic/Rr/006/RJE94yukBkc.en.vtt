00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:19.970
 it seems to me the group 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:23.000
 strong group and they did I am new 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:26.360
 they won excellence by making everyone 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.750
 the records and it seems we seem to be strong 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:31.790
 but no one has ever made the series 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.530
 we don't know but we know how 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:36.350
 category is therefore a bit unknown 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:39.500
 But doubts about my companions do not have 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:42.800
 they are strong already there is enthusiasm then there is the 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:46.970
 curiosity of the category that that 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:49.100
 he practically does not make us there does not 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:51.650
 look forward to starting this this 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.420
 championship I was away for four 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.460
 years in sectal where I did a little more 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.010
 of experience and I was looking forward to 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.800
 return and the series d is an opportunity 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.809
 important for me but since the 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.879
 category I never did before 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:06.500
 however, I have really good people and 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.600
 really strong 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.640
 I'm happy to make some presence e 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.030
 then if they come well, then it's not a 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.630
 problem 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:17.690
 no it is always the same good person 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:21.110
 good person both as a coach and a 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.340
 keeping the group is the strength of this 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.520
 company of this he school 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:29.210
 because it's all he is on the group 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:31.490
 very good impressions those of the year 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.310
 last year's boys and 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:38.120
 two years ago he kept a big one 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:40.100
 want a great enthusiasm the many 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.740
 new guys too very young that 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:45.200
 have arrived are working well e 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.740
 so there is great confidence that they can 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.940
 to give spare parts to the height 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:53.120
 let's say it 's Sunday the first taste 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:54.810
 true d standard d against your own the 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.119
 pro piacenza that 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.460
 they tell me that last year he did the 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.320
 play off to go in series then ce 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.140
 it will be Sunday away from home in a stadium 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:07.829
 true with a d series team 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:11.280
 Sunday we will already have some small ones 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:13.680
 We never really thought about answers 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:17.790
 that they put us in the group of us 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:20.430
 we are gorgonzola we are short 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:23.220
 we thought just the only thought 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:27.049
 our era were two for the truth the 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:30.530
 girone b surely we thought no 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:32.610
 the Sardinian teams were the danger 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.019
 someone spoke to are those that 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.170
 a few years that are not in these 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:39.599
 gironi here feared this danger 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.150
 escaped this danger we thought 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:45.599
 really really everyone in the group b are 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:48.420
 instead instead nothing short patience 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:50.130
 in short, now the thing like that would be 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.190
 however changed because the series of 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:55.590
 another thing compared to excellence e 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.900
 even more this year because we do 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.150
 a tour or we would have never dreamed of 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.640
 do going to Piedmont of Liguria 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:06.900
 and so on with long travels 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:08.970
 to prepare and you must also prepare yourself 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.890
 on this with regard to the 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:15.209
 the technical side we will find out about it 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:17.870
 even though everyone tells me to be tough and physical 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:17.870
 and technical
