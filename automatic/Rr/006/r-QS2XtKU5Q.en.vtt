00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 Hello you and welcome 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.750
 to a new video of game with me 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.330
 children's toys today I have the 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.849
 hello kitty magic payne posters for you 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.980
 The set is made by Sanrio and 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.980
 suitable for children over four years of age 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.390
 Maybe it was in the north block 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.930
 Do you have the previous video 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.119
 seen 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.910
 Today we will be the hello 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.480
 kitty magic campus the try or 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.179
 imagine 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.650
 Here you can see the poster 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:33.140
 different brushes and down here too 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.570
 different colors I'm curious 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:38.010
 and well these phases are mostly 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.960
 it's more like it a bit 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:44.460
 disillusioned wants to paint the whole 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.410
 does not really discover that 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.980
 I'm especially looking forward to the 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.980
 to dye 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.690
 I 'll do that here 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.330
 we probably have for every color 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.410
 A brush you could also brush 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.380
 just wash out 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:25.050
 but here are a lot of brushes too 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:29.670
 and also different posters here 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:30.810
 how hello kitty would be in a theater 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.990
 I say here she is such a kind 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.610
 puppet 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:39.020
 then here we have hello kitty with whole 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:42.110
 many grinding in thought bubbles 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:44.850
 hello kitty in the plane 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:47.120
 hello kitty in the garden like the vegetables 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:51.920
 to harvest 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:56.430
 We have that twice as well 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:02:03.050
 and that too we have from everyone 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:06.660
 There are two copies in total 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:11.940
 four different ones I decide 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:14.010
 now for 1 I think I take 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.530
 hello kitty in the plane and that will 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.739
 I'm with you now 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.440
 imagine 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:21.150
 so then we start what already 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.790
 maybe not said under 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.550
 Every poster is so different here 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.440
 Colors are not pots or anything 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.870
 They are easy on this paper and 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:36.200
 if you now the brush here 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:39.150
 water tower and this paper goes on 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:42.150
 then the color dissolves so I say 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:45.709
 had something never even so this 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.709
 I do not know any variation from the table 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:52.820
 and now let's just do this 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.820
 wing rests here 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.310
 you really need a lot of water 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:04.340
 take this color here as well 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.990
 triggers and then the color is total 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.820
 westrich so I can not find that now 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:09.820
 she discovered so beautiful 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:28.040
 probably one is more correct 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:31.580
 paintbrush colors better off 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:33.170
 So just the poster then in common with 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.990
 maybe a table box still 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:38.210
 out of school or something like that or 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:38.950
 maybe with dog or fat 

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:41.920
 cause 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:44.540
 because these colors were here 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:47.240
 honestly, they are not so good now 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:52.100
 I'll take another one 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:55.010
 find and also a different color though 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:57.160
 now scold me for this turquoise 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.160
 here 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.890
 By that I mean back here 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.890
 plane 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:14.079
 that too is a pity that 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:17.229
 This paper then totally soaked 

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:20.500
 where the bag is attached 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:24.460
 because you constantly brush with this then 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:26.470
 in the color here must therefore completely on 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:29.919
 start thinking the color still pretty good 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:34.380
 here for example but here is then 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:39.039
 Overall, the color already used up 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:41.340
 then it's pretty watery that's how it looks 

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:41.340
 because out 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:47.669
 then I take another driver 

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:59.130
 Just this orange here that one 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:02.830
 still has to say is that the brush 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:06.419
 pretty nice were the brushes 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:06.419
 lose their bristles totally fast 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:18.810
 the orange is not so synonymous 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:21.420
 Great and the more often you get here in this 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:24.600
 color goes in the less color it is 

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:25.890
 then of course that's clear but if 

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:28.350
 you do not have the poster yet 

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:34.260
 has fully painted then the 

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:38.330
 color already empty and you have everywhere 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:41.790
 these bristles are here on the foot now 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:46.910
 Can be done with the table very tender 

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:46.910
 so to speak, the airplane here at main 

00:05:52.009 --> 00:05:57.750
 So the colors are not as said 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:00.210
 great but the idea is actually quite 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:02.810
 Cool that you just paint here 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:05.100
 But there is something in the paper as well 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:06.630
 disadvantageous in that the paper then 

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:09.240
 totally softened I'll take it again 

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:12.199
 the other colors just to test how 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:12.199
 these are 

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:27.090
 that's green now 

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:46.470
 for such small places it goes on everyone 

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:46.470
 case then I take now 

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:14.710
 so and money we have now 

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:32.760
 If you look closely then you see 

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:34.500
 here on the brush all the bristles off 

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:37.520
 So these are really the ones 

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:40.170
 bristles brush you then loses 

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:44.040
 not so nice that overall 

00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:45.660
 a cool idea for the set but at the 

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:47.880
 Implementation is a bit of a hitch 

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:48.990
 I hope you like my video 

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:50.940
 Give me a thumbs up 

00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:52.470
 leave the agent comments and 

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:53.790

00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:56.090
