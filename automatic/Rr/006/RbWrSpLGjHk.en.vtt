00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240
 this time I want to explain how 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:08.250
 have any tablet loaded 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.380
 cellular although I have already said many 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.820
 Sometimes I want to make a replacement 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.160
 a review for those who have not 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.310
 understood well the subject is very simple 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.630
 this tablet arrives because it does not charge anymore 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.369
 They have changed the pin in another side 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.160
 we even change the pin 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:26.550
 for suspicions in the tablet still without 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.400
 charge although it lights the bulb and we 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.189
 sometimes it indicates that it is loading but it is 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:35.040
 a false charge this is due to a series 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.260
 of behaviors that the 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.760
 labor although the positive pin and 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.860
 negative the voltage is coming 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.410
 correctly the data lines are 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:47.100
 in short how this tablet is a bit 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.989
 this is not common the experience that 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.940
 we have include you can not get the plane 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.129
 to do a precise follow-up like 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.500
 I have explained in the course about 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.300
 load circuits and the client as 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.040
 He needs it fast and wants it to be 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.680
 give a solution 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.540
 quick then for that let's try 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.159
 here I will test the voltage that has 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:08.659
 Battery 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:12.840
 voltage that has the battery has 3.5 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:14.250
 it has 3.5 and when we connect the 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.000
 charger here is already made the 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.000
 repair 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:27.140
 we see that it goes up to 3.6 and starts to go up 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:30.460
 slowly 3.16 3.17 3.18 there they see or 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:33.130
 which is accumulating charge in the battery 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:36.700
 is a definitive solution what is the 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:38.560
 solution I have brought the positive line of 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.330
 charger to the positive line of the 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.430
 the battery is equal weldable here 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.680
 that solve is condensed because 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.060
 the line is the same if health here does not 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.369
 There is a problem if the welded house 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:51.140
 condensed there's no problem there either 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:53.240
 where the voltage is coming 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:56.960
 the same voltage that is reaching the 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:59.000
 battery as I did then we already know 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.950
 that one of the pins should be the 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:06.310
 purpose of the battery that is not 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.310
 confusing the other I took it and brought it 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:13.040
 from the positive pin loading the ping 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.080
 of cargo there we see what am I going through 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.390
 here for this hole to make it more 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.360
 comfortable and let's look at what it was that 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:23.960
 I did to explain to you well 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:26.990
 how to disconnect the battery 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:30.010
 disconnect the battery and I will 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.010
 explain them well 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:35.400
 because that way they will solve any 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:37.710
 problem is not the best way but yes 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.830
 it is a definitive way and a solution 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:43.530
 for people that what matters most 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:47.040
 here for example we have 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:49.440
 the load pin welded normally with 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.410
 in the failure the next fails the 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.810
 fails is that the data pins that are 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:57.630
 those who follow after the positive this 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.670
 and this has continuity to land and 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:02.400
 by some circuit some component that 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:05.160
 what is controlling it is short but 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.920
 in the review that says I did not find it 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.930
 a quick review I did not find it but 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.239
 the client needs the tablet he needs 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:15.570
 use it then the solution that I gave him 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:17.970
 was grabbing the positive pin of the pin 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:22.650
 of cargo that exist as long as 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:25.739
 This style of pin that wide part 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:28.049
 that the wide part is the one above 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:31.500
 they know that the pin has a wide shape 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:33.840
 up and a narrower down when 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.310
 it's like that in that position because we're going to 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.620
 can find pins that are 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:40.980
 inverted when in this position 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:43.230
 equal to this similar to that of b 8 then 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.150
 this will be the positive this will be negative 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.519
 the negative can go anywhere 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:50.640
 negative that is originally soldier 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:53.549
 normal the positive here is the trick I 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:55.349
 I have to solder the base where 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:58.290
 original as this is in soldier 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:04:00.389
 originally this one not because then because 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.489
 that's not loading because there's a short 

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:04.270
 internal if I leave it there soldier and 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:06.460
 I send the cable 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:09.190
 it will be able to load but it will be downloaded 

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:11.860
 quickly or even will not load 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:13.990
 then I take it from the welded with the cau 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:16.360
 he has a little needle he picked it up he left it on 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:19.300
 the air that does not touch the base down by 

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:21.340
 that has a tape that isolating that does not 

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:23.530
 I touch that part can not touch 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:26.620
 that metallic part that is here 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:29.350
 understanding this foundation already 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:31.780
 understanding this then DÃ­az almost pulled out 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:34.060
 in the positive line aligns the battery 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:36.400
 will load directly is not going to 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.020
 damage if they ask if it is years 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.690
 Add the same as charging a battery 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:42.280
 with a universal charger with charger 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:44.410
 wall 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:47.280
 Here we are already sending voltage 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:49.650
 I saw you take out the charger 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:52.020
 what is it that will load the tablet 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:54.810
 a little faster it can be an hour 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:56.970
 before then we will leave it for 34 hours 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:59.190
 maximum and we will not leave all the 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:02.010
 loading night because we add the 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:03.750
 battery quickly and because it also 

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:06.180
 may be overheating the tablet 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:08.970
 So with this principle, I'm going to 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:11.389
 can this give solution to any 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:14.850
 tablet that can not find a solution 

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:18.490
 be so professional saying that 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:20.590
 replacing its components 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:23.860
 like this I already explained it in others 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:25.960
 videos then I'm just doing the 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:27.819
 explanation of what I did 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:30.580
 for welding we already know in the channel 

00:05:27.819 --> 00:05:31.539
 explained a lot also explained other 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:33.370
 Similar cases 

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:35.590
 let's test if it's true that this is going 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:37.840
 to serve here there are between the pins 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:42.630
 positive and negative let's see what 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:42.630
 There is no voltage 3.5 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:51.050
 3,538 milliamps 3 volts with 538 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:55.040
 This shows me the full scale 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:59.390
 Now let's leave it, I'll let it go 

00:05:55.040 --> 00:06:01.510
 to remember that value 3.5 38 and we're going to 

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:04.130
 wait in 10 minutes 

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:05.870
 here the tablet connection to the exchange does not 

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:07.880
 turn on try to turn on and go back and you 

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:10.160
 turn off let's wait 10 minutes and let's go 

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:13.310
 to see if accumulates accumulate 10 minutes 

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:15.880
 then the work is well done and the 

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:17.980
 tablet will work perfectly 

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:20.380
 here we have the stopwatch to do 

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:23.520
 that count and that you can see if 

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:23.520
 this solution works 

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:36.290
 and they are eleven minutes general cargo 

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:36.290
 go 

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:39.270
 here 

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:46.980
 3.83 point 8 but this is because 

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:54.360
 has the charger inserted but now 

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:58.439
 if the actual load 3.7 accumulated a load 

00:06:54.360 --> 00:07:00.150
 good acceptable in those 10 minutes 11 

00:06:58.439 --> 00:07:03.419
 minutes and now the tablet should 

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:05.230
 turn on and show me the percentage that 

00:07:03.419 --> 00:07:08.980
 should have 

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:11.440
 and although it is not fully charged we 

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:15.160
 should show the percentage that 

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:17.680
 It represents 3.7 volts in the bar 

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:21.090
 indicator 

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:21.090
 wait for it to turn on 

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:31.120
 and you know this solution is applicable to 

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:34.200
 any phone to any tablet and 

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:37.890
 to any device that carries this 

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:37.890
 a lithium battery 

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:58.570
 there is it shows us already lit 

00:07:56.500 --> 00:08:00.060
 shows us 8 percent of the 

00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:03.650
 drums 

00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:03.650
 our 8% 

00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:09.349
 and it is operating the solution 

00:08:07.729 --> 00:08:11.449
 we did service of the arauca service 

00:08:09.349 --> 00:08:14.289
 professional technician in mobile telephony and 

00:08:11.449 --> 00:08:14.289
 mobile devices
