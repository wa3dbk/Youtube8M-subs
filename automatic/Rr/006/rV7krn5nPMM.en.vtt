00:00:59.850 --> 00:00:59.860 
lately so let me grab the plane here and

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:01.549 
lately so let me grab the plane here and
I'm<00:00:59.949> gonna<00:01:00.100> bring<00:01:00.280> it<00:01:00.430> over<00:01:00.489> and<00:01:00.760> show<00:01:00.940> you

I<00:01:07.600> know<00:01:07.780> that<00:01:08.050> there<00:01:08.229> is<00:01:08.350> a<00:01:08.380> little<00:01:08.619> bit<00:01:08.740> of

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860 
I know that there is a little bit of

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.570 
I know that there is a little bit of

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:12.580 
setup that has to be done on each plane

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.210 
setup that has to be done on each plane
but<00:01:13.270> once<00:01:13.479> the<00:01:13.630> setup<00:01:13.840> is<00:01:14.050> done<00:01:14.259> once<00:01:14.950> you<00:01:15.040> have

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.220 
but once the setup is done once you have

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.270 
but once the setup is done once you have
the<00:01:15.369> the<00:01:15.790> hole<00:01:15.970> carved<00:01:16.390> out<00:01:16.570> for<00:01:16.869> the<00:01:17.190> for<00:01:18.190> the

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
the the hole carved out for the for the

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.450 
the the hole carved out for the for the
sound<00:01:18.490> module<00:01:18.700> and<00:01:19.149> stuff<00:01:19.380> it's<00:01:20.380> really<00:01:20.800> easy

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
sound module and stuff it's really easy

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.999 
sound module and stuff it's really easy
to<00:01:21.670> do<00:01:21.940> so<00:01:22.270> what<00:01:22.390> I'm<00:01:22.479> gonna<00:01:22.660> do<00:01:22.869> here<00:01:23.110> so<00:01:23.350> I'm

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.469 
off and turn off my transmitter so they
pull<00:01:29.950> the<00:01:30.039> battery<00:01:31.440> turn<00:01:32.440> off<00:01:32.590> my<00:01:32.740> transmitter

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
pull the battery turn off my transmitter

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.020 
pull the battery turn off my transmitter
so<00:01:34.479> I'm<00:01:34.539> not<00:01:34.690> wasting<00:01:34.840> the<00:01:35.170> juice<00:01:35.380> on<00:01:35.590> that<00:01:36.030> I'm

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
just gonna unbell crow the sound module

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.380 
just gonna unbell crow the sound module
there<00:01:40.720> it<00:01:40.810> is<00:01:40.899> right<00:01:41.050> there<00:01:41.880> unhook<00:01:42.880> the<00:01:43.030> servo

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
there it is right there unhook the servo

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.130 
there it is right there unhook the servo
weed<00:01:44.759> unhook<00:01:45.759> the<00:01:45.880> battery<00:01:46.030> connector<00:01:46.660> that

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
weed unhook the battery connector that

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.100 
weed unhook the battery connector that
goes<00:01:47.200> to<00:01:47.530> the<00:01:47.590> ESC<00:01:48.100> and<00:01:48.399> this<00:01:49.209> out<00:01:49.420> it's<00:01:49.929> ready

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
goes to the ESC and this out it's ready

00:01:50.110 --> 00:02:01.450 
goes to the ESC and this out it's ready
to<00:01:50.200> go<00:01:50.289> in<00:01:50.590> so<00:01:51.429> over<00:01:51.670> here<00:01:51.849> on<00:01:51.880> the<00:01:52.740> cosna

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:03:39.970 

this<00:02:02.460> one<00:02:02.640> here<00:02:04.009> myself

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:49.720 

there<00:03:40.700> we<00:03:40.790> go<00:03:47.590> with<00:03:48.590> the<00:03:48.680> sound<00:03:48.980> unit<00:03:49.340> all<00:03:49.549> in

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730 
there we go with the sound unit all in

00:03:49.730 --> 00:04:29.900 
there we go with the sound unit all in
place<00:03:50.000> so<00:03:50.959> let's<00:03:51.409> start<00:03:52.250> it<00:03:52.340> up<00:03:52.430> here<00:03:52.700> take<00:03:53.659> off

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:29.910 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:32.220 

so<00:04:30.910> as<00:04:31.030> you<00:04:31.120> could<00:04:31.270> see<00:04:31.390> it<00:04:31.510> was<00:04:31.540> real<00:04:31.780> easy<00:04:31.810> to

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:32.230 
so as you could see it was real easy to

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:34.380 
so as you could see it was real easy to
change<00:04:32.410> from<00:04:32.560> plane<00:04:32.920> to<00:04:32.950> plane<00:04:33.070> took<00:04:34.030> probably

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:34.390 
change from plane to plane took probably

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:35.820 
change from plane to plane took probably
less<00:04:34.690> than<00:04:34.720> two<00:04:34.990> minutes<00:04:35.140> I<00:04:35.410> don't<00:04:35.590> know<00:04:35.650> when

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 
less than two minutes I don't know when

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:37.470 
less than two minutes I don't know when
I<00:04:35.860> edit<00:04:36.190> the<00:04:36.370> video<00:04:36.580> I'll<00:04:36.820> see<00:04:37.030> how<00:04:37.150> long<00:04:37.180> it

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:37.480 
I edit the video I'll see how long it

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:41.100 
I edit the video I'll see how long it
took<00:04:37.630> but<00:04:38.350> real<00:04:38.980> quick<00:04:39.220> easy<00:04:39.430> and<00:04:39.780> now<00:04:40.780> I<00:04:40.810> want
