you get your proform on set each size

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.970 
you get your proform on set each size
depend<00:02:00.240> on<00:02:00.360> what<00:02:00.480> size<00:02:00.630> you<00:02:00.660> get<00:02:00.960> I<00:02:01.170> like<00:02:01.440> these

in<00:02:19.110> the<00:02:19.230> video<00:02:19.380> with<00:02:20.240> the<00:02:21.240> braids<00:02:21.540> out<00:02:21.720> using

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
in the video with the braids out using

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.840 
in the video with the braids out using
Chrome<00:02:22.260> for<00:02:22.470> birth<00:02:22.650> I<00:02:22.830> use<00:02:22.980> the<00:02:23.160> skinnier<00:02:23.610> one

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
Chrome for birth I use the skinnier one

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.430 
Chrome for birth I use the skinnier one
so<00:02:24.660> I<00:02:24.720> had<00:02:24.960> these<00:02:25.850> you<00:02:26.850> could<00:02:27.300> use<00:02:27.990> these<00:02:28.230> on

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
so I had these you could use these on

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.210 
so I had these you could use these on
your<00:02:28.470> whole<00:02:28.800> head<00:02:29.070> I<00:02:30.110> don't<00:02:31.110> want<00:02:31.440> to<00:02:31.590> put

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
your whole head I don't want to put

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.120 
your whole head I don't want to put
necessarily<00:02:33.000> because<00:02:33.900> it<00:02:34.140> would<00:02:34.350> take<00:02:34.770> a<00:02:34.800> long

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
necessarily because it would take a long

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:36.450 
necessarily because it would take a long
time

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:36.460 
time

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.070 
time
I<00:02:36.520> would<00:02:36.700> have<00:02:36.850> very<00:02:37.030> small<00:02:37.360> girls<00:02:37.690> and<00:02:38.020> you

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
I would have very small girls and you

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.720 
I would have very small girls and you
can<00:02:38.230> pull<00:02:38.410> em<00:02:38.500> apart<00:02:38.590> it<00:02:38.950> would<00:02:39.040> be<00:02:39.190> more<00:02:39.460> like

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
can pull em apart it would be more like

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.210 
can pull em apart it would be more like
if<00:02:40.300> you<00:02:40.480> ever<00:02:40.510> do<00:02:40.810> a<00:02:40.840> flexi<00:02:41.350> rod<00:02:41.560> set<00:02:41.890> it<00:02:42.070> would

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
if you ever do a flexi rod set it would

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.110 
if you ever do a flexi rod set it would
look<00:02:42.370> like<00:02:42.850> that<00:02:43.770> but<00:02:44.770> for<00:02:45.010> this<00:02:45.190> I<00:02:45.460> want<00:02:45.880> a

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
look like that but for this I want a

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.420 
look like that but for this I want a
looser<00:02:46.780> bigger<00:02:47.200> curl<00:02:47.560> because<00:02:48.040> I'm<00:02:48.190> going<00:02:48.370> to

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
looser bigger curl because I'm going to

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.430 
looser bigger curl because I'm going to
do<00:02:48.550> different<00:02:49.060> styles<00:02:49.660> I'm<00:02:49.810> not<00:02:49.990> necessarily

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
do different styles I'm not necessarily

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.700 
do different styles I'm not necessarily
going<00:02:50.590> to<00:02:50.650> just<00:02:50.860> clear<00:02:51.220> my<00:02:51.610> hair<00:02:52.420> as<00:02:53.050> it<00:02:53.350> is<00:02:53.440> my

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:53.710 
going to just clear my hair as it is my

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:56.580 
going to just clear my hair as it is my
takes<00:02:53.950> it<00:02:54.100> out<00:02:54.540> but<00:02:55.540> what<00:02:55.870> you<00:02:56.020> will<00:02:56.200> notice

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
takes it out but what you will notice

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.100 
takes it out but what you will notice
with<00:02:56.830> the<00:02:57.070> curlformers<00:02:57.760> is<00:02:58.060> that<00:02:58.540> each<00:02:58.780> size

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
with the curlformers is that each size

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.040 
with the curlformers is that each size
comes<00:02:59.650> in<00:02:59.860> two<00:03:00.100> different<00:03:00.130> colors<00:03:00.820> and<00:03:01.210> the

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.050 
comes in two different colors and the

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:06.420 
comes in two different colors and the
color<00:03:03.330> determines<00:03:04.330> the<00:03:04.570> direction<00:03:05.050> that<00:03:05.980> the

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
color determines the direction that the

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.890 
color determines the direction that the
curls<00:03:07.180> the<00:03:07.360> curls<00:03:07.660> are<00:03:07.930> in<00:03:09.000> so<00:03:10.000> like<00:03:10.330> the<00:03:10.630> green

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
curls the curls are in so like the green

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.280 
curls the curls are in so like the green
one<00:03:11.140> it<00:03:11.380> curls<00:03:11.800> this<00:03:12.130> way<00:03:12.400> and<00:03:13.120> the<00:03:13.900> blue<00:03:14.140> one

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
one it curls this way and the blue one

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.330 
one it curls this way and the blue one
curls<00:03:14.620> the<00:03:14.800> opposite<00:03:15.280> leaves<00:03:15.430> or<00:03:15.640> curl<00:03:15.910> family

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
curls the opposite leaves or curl family

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.480 
curls the opposite leaves or curl family
and<00:03:18.340> it's<00:03:18.730> the<00:03:18.880> same<00:03:19.120> with<00:03:19.740> the<00:03:20.740> pink<00:03:21.010> and<00:03:21.280> the

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:21.490 
and it's the same with the pink and the

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:24.650 
and it's the same with the pink and the
yellow<00:03:21.520> so<00:03:22.300> the<00:03:22.510> yellow<00:03:22.750> curls<00:03:23.440> this<00:03:23.800> way<00:03:24.040> and

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
yellow so the yellow curls this way and

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.530 
yellow so the yellow curls this way and
the<00:03:25.660> pink<00:03:25.930> pros

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
the pink pros

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.810 
the pink pros
just<00:03:29.200> a<00:03:29.320> few<00:03:29.470> pointers<00:03:29.950> so<00:03:30.250> when<00:03:30.640> you're

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:30.820 
just a few pointers so when you're

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:32.910 
just a few pointers so when you're
putting<00:03:31.060> the<00:03:31.360> cross<00:03:31.570> borders<00:03:31.990> in<00:03:32.170> you'll

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
putting the cross borders in you'll

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.210 
putting the cross borders in you'll
notice<00:03:33.310> I<00:03:33.750> try<00:03:34.750> to<00:03:34.810> put<00:03:35.260> it<00:03:35.350> in<00:03:35.470> a<00:03:35.590> grid<00:03:35.920> so

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
notice I try to put it in a grid so

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.930 
notice I try to put it in a grid so
think<00:03:36.550> about<00:03:36.670> like<00:03:36.850> maybe<00:03:37.240> box<00:03:37.570> braids<00:03:37.930> and

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
think about like maybe box braids and

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.400 
think about like maybe box braids and
that's<00:03:39.940> about<00:03:40.120> the<00:03:40.300> size<00:03:40.630> you<00:03:40.870> want<00:03:41.050> you<00:03:41.290> don't

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
that's about the size you want you don't

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.830 
that's about the size you want you don't
want<00:03:41.530> it<00:03:41.800> too<00:03:42.130> big<00:03:42.400> you<00:03:43.270> don't<00:03:43.480> want<00:03:43.600> it<00:03:43.660> too

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
want it too big you don't want it too

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.660 
want it too big you don't want it too
small<00:03:44.020> because<00:03:44.350> it's<00:03:44.650> too<00:03:44.920> small<00:03:45.070> you<00:03:45.400> can

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
small because it's too small you can

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.730 
small because it's too small you can
wait<00:03:46.390> to<00:03:46.540> be<00:03:46.630> rollers<00:03:46.990> and<00:03:47.200> these<00:03:47.350> things<00:03:47.530> are

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:47.740 
wait to be rollers and these things are

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.730 
wait to be rollers and these things are
not<00:03:47.890> cheap<00:03:48.100> so<00:03:48.600> use<00:03:49.600> a<00:03:49.630> good<00:03:50.200> amount<00:03:50.410> of<00:03:50.530> hair

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:50.740 
not cheap so use a good amount of hair

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:51.810 
not cheap so use a good amount of hair
but<00:03:50.980> not<00:03:51.160> too<00:03:51.370> much

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:51.820 
but not too much

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:55.080 
but not too much
if<00:03:52.060> you<00:03:52.330> feel<00:03:52.830> tension<00:03:53.830> on<00:03:54.370> the<00:03:54.610> hair<00:03:54.640> when

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
if you feel tension on the hair when

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.850 
if you feel tension on the hair when
you're<00:03:55.210> pulling<00:03:55.660> it<00:03:55.840> through<00:03:56.070> stop<00:03:57.510> go<00:03:58.510> back

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
you're pulling it through stop go back

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.650 
you're pulling it through stop go back
take<00:03:59.860> some<00:04:00.040> of<00:04:00.130> that<00:04:00.250> hair<00:04:00.490> out<00:04:00.520> and<00:04:01.030> then

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:01.660 
take some of that hair out and then

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.790 
take some of that hair out and then
start<00:04:02.170> over<00:04:02.290> because<00:04:03.010> you<00:04:03.310> don't<00:04:03.520> want<00:04:03.850> to

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:04.800

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
of your hair is in here because if you

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.380 
of your hair is in here because if you

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:18.390 
have a little bit bent like hanging out

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:20.750 
have a little bit bent like hanging out
also<00:04:19.390> not<00:04:19.570> going<00:04:19.720> to<00:04:19.810> be<00:04:19.930> good

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
also not going to be good

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.110 
also not going to be good
so<00:04:20.850> it's<00:04:21.090> gonna<00:04:21.300> rip<00:04:21.570> your<00:04:21.870> hair<00:04:22.140> and<00:04:23.120> that's

so it's gonna rip your hair and that's

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.420 
so it's gonna rip your hair and that's
why<00:04:24.240> you'll<00:04:24.480> notice<00:04:24.900> when<00:04:25.230> I'm<00:04:25.860> putting<00:04:26.280> the

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
why you'll notice when I'm putting the

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.270 
why you'll notice when I'm putting the
threader<00:04:26.730> on<00:04:26.940> my<00:04:27.120> hair<00:04:27.360> that<00:04:27.690> I<00:04:27.750> actually

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
threader on my hair that I actually

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.880 
threader on my hair that I actually
twist<00:04:29.280> it<00:04:29.430> a<00:04:29.520> little<00:04:29.550> bit<00:04:29.940> and<00:04:30.180> that<00:04:30.390> just

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:30.890 
twist it a little bit and that just

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:33.980 
twist it a little bit and that just
ensures<00:04:31.890> that<00:04:31.920> all<00:04:32.610> of<00:04:33.000> the<00:04:33.150> hair<00:04:33.420> in<00:04:33.690> that

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
ensures that all of the hair in that

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.800 
ensures that all of the hair in that
section<00:04:34.290> is<00:04:34.590> in<00:04:34.830> here<00:04:35.190> because<00:04:36.060> if<00:04:36.390> you<00:04:36.420> just

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
section is in here because if you just

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.140 
section is in here because if you just
kind<00:04:37.170> of<00:04:37.230> clamp<00:04:37.620> it<00:04:37.830> and<00:04:38.070> then<00:04:38.280> try<00:04:38.730> to<00:04:38.790> hook<00:04:38.970> it

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
kind of clamp it and then try to hook it

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.330 
kind of clamp it and then try to hook it
there's<00:04:39.450> strands<00:04:39.870> that<00:04:40.110> are<00:04:40.170> hanging<00:04:41.040> out<00:04:41.130> and

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
there's strands that are hanging out and

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.100 
there's strands that are hanging out and
also<00:04:41.550> the<00:04:41.940> twisting<00:04:42.420> method<00:04:42.720> it<00:04:42.810> puts<00:04:43.050> a

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
also the twisting method it puts a

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:44.800 
also the twisting method it puts a
little<00:04:43.230> more<00:04:43.380> attention<00:04:43.860> on<00:04:43.950> my<00:04:44.100> roots<00:04:44.370> so

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
little more attention on my roots so

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:47.570 
little more attention on my roots so
you'll<00:04:45.810> notice<00:04:46.230> that<00:04:46.500> the<00:04:46.770> curl<00:04:46.980> former<00:04:47.310> it

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
you'll notice that the curl former it

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.000 
you'll notice that the curl former it
will<00:04:47.850> get<00:04:48.090> your<00:04:48.270> roots<00:04:48.540> very<00:04:48.660> straight<00:04:49.260> there

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 
will get your roots very straight there

you should notice that you're dry time
is<00:04:51.930> a<00:04:51.960> lot<00:04:52.230> faster<00:04:52.530> than<00:04:53.160> traditional<00:04:53.580> rollers

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:54.450 
is a lot faster than traditional rollers

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:59.660 
is a lot faster than traditional rollers
and<00:04:54.690> also<00:04:55.700> flexi<00:04:56.700> rods<00:04:57.290> perm<00:04:58.290> rods<00:04:58.670> because

00:04:59.660 --> 00:04:59.670 
and also flexi rods perm rods because

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:01.220 
and also flexi rods perm rods because
your<00:04:59.910> hair<00:05:00.210> it's<00:05:00.540> all<00:05:00.780> in<00:05:00.960> a<00:05:01.050> different

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:01.230 
your hair it's all in a different

your hair it's all in a different
section<00:05:01.770> of<00:05:01.890> the<00:05:01.950> roller<00:05:02.190> that's<00:05:02.550> getting<00:05:02.910> its

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090 
section of the roller that's getting its

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.600 
section of the roller that's getting its
own<00:05:03.330> ventilation<00:05:03.630> and<00:05:04.410> all<00:05:04.650> its<00:05:04.860> own<00:05:05.100> air<00:05:05.400> is

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610 
own ventilation and all its own air is

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:08.060 
own ventilation and all its own air is
coming<00:05:05.820> in<00:05:06.120> there<00:05:06.330> on<00:05:06.630> every<00:05:07.380> piece<00:05:07.710> of<00:05:07.740> your

coming in there on every piece of your
hair<00:05:08.280> there's<00:05:08.970> I<00:05:09.270> use<00:05:09.510> it's<00:05:09.900> close<00:05:10.200> to<00:05:10.440> 50

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:10.920 
hair there's I use it's close to 50

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:18.670 
hair there's I use it's close to 50
rollers<00:05:11.340> that<00:05:11.730> I<00:05:12.510> actually<00:05:12.660> use<00:05:12.990> in<00:05:13.200> my<00:05:13.320> hair

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:18.680 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.680 

what<00:05:19.680> I<00:05:19.710> do<00:05:19.830> when<00:05:20.520> I'm<00:05:20.970> taking<00:05:21.450> the

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:21.690 
what I do when I'm taking the

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:24.410 
what I do when I'm taking the
curlformers<00:05:22.290> out<00:05:22.470> I<00:05:22.920> typically<00:05:23.850> start<00:05:23.940> in<00:05:24.300> the

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:24.420 
curlformers out I typically start in the

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:26.480 
curlformers out I typically start in the
back<00:05:24.720> but<00:05:25.230> just<00:05:25.500> so<00:05:25.680> it<00:05:25.920> makes<00:05:25.950> a<00:05:26.220> little<00:05:26.340> bit

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:26.490 
back but just so it makes a little bit

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:27.980 
back but just so it makes a little bit
easier<00:05:26.850> so<00:05:26.880> that<00:05:27.150> you<00:05:27.270> guys<00:05:27.420> can<00:05:27.690> see<00:05:27.810> what<00:05:27.900> I'm

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:27.990 
easier so that you guys can see what I'm

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:30.680 
easier so that you guys can see what I'm
doing<00:05:28.290> I'll<00:05:28.470> start<00:05:28.890> is<00:05:29.250> the<00:05:29.610> price<00:05:29.880> so<00:05:30.510> what

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:30.690 
doing I'll start is the price so what

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:34.820 
doing I'll start is the price so what
you<00:05:30.810> want<00:05:30.990> to<00:05:31.050> do<00:05:31.260> is<00:05:31.860> you<00:05:32.550> want<00:05:32.730> to<00:05:32.870> take<00:05:33.870> the

you want to do is you want to take the

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:37.850 
you want to do is you want to take the
curl<00:05:35.070> performer<00:05:35.940> I'll<00:05:36.750> loosen<00:05:37.080> it<00:05:37.290> up<00:05:37.410> and

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:37.860 
curl performer I'll loosen it up and

00:05:37.860 --> 00:06:28.670 
curl performer I'll loosen it up and
it'll<00:05:38.340> slide<00:05:38.460> right<00:05:38.790> off
