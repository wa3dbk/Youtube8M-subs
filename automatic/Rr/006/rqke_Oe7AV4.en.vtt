00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:22.630
 and I want to show what a village would be 

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:23.950
 troll really subway reads this village 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.919
 sorry just write a little different 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:30.759
 but and got a vacation and I'm 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:32.890
 recording here but because in the house that 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:34.300
 I am and casually they have internet 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.760
 then today taking advantage to play a 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:39.370
 little bit going up a couple of glasses and what 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:42.100
 that I did not want to show you is this village 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:44.469
 with which I stumbled upon really me 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:47.589
 trolleo enough because they will see 

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:49.269
 what is it like maybe they will realize 

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:51.159
 in several clans they are moving me 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:54.239
 because I'm trying to know certain 

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:56.980
 new people and such then first 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.710
 I tried to go down here because 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.600
 to get the punishment but because subway 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.949
 me because he is leaving to you those of 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.960
 here and I did not expect me to leave 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:06.460
 this one really complicated everything 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.060
 the attack since well he had to 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.009
 attack from above 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.280
 to try to quickly reach the 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:15.110
 center and even if I was even though I know 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.079
 I knew I was going to see the trope in the 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:22.159
 castle and I did not find another for another 

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:24.289
 side where where you can get the troops 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:26.840
 can almost destroy then 

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:30.190
 unfold in a very foolish way all 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.530
 these troops here waste them 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.330
 Ivan is assembled by serious overhead cost 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.880
 error since I had to see first the 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.920
 classrooms pigs up and over 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.360
 behind the pigs start to start 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.640
 throw what would be the troops so that 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:45.510
 were cleaning all that once 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:48.460
 zone up and earning a percentage and 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:49.900
 a very bad spell thrown I had to 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.390
 hope that it will come together a little more 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:56.530
 the troops to be able to launch is the 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:59.770
 spell really and at that time not 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.700
 I knew what to do and I lost focus 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.700
 I lost control a little bit 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:07.260
 but good really she 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.240
 the nerves rather than the entire game 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:12.090
 when you are at a point 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.490
 where you do not get something that you do not 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.350
 you expected 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:19.970
 but to me more or less and adding 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:22.130
 percentage 33 percent 34 of there more or 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.650
 less we went adding it came to true 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:27.110
 point where good did not really know what 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:30.530
 do 35 percent here, it was my turn 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:32.120
 throw the barbarian king to see if what 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.720
 I managed to add a little more 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:39.290
 38 percent percentage 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:41.570
 to 39 40 and at this point really not 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.340
 I knew what to do I had to wait for the 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:47.090
 another healing spell that really 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:49.130
 I do not think that helped by anything else 43 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.260
 hundred here and why there was not a point 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.820
 where me and the queen arches perhaps what 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.210
 I said good or good in Wizard is then 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:59.930
 what do I have punishment so I launched 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:01.550
 castilla I put invisible to the queen 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.960
 to be able to get the archers that 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.810
 I had and they really support me 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:07.990
 they could nothing for the castle really 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.010
 it was that I finished doing the job 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:12.110
 48 percent at this time was 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.990
 biting my nails because really I 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.459
 I did not want to lose glasses I do not remember 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:20.840
 how many glasses were I think they were not 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:23.000
 many who dodged it lose 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.940
 but good you are always in your life 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.349
 if you least want to lose glasses 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.989
 then imagine how could I be 

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:32.690
 in that moment to see that I could 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:34.040
 stay up with that maybe even with 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.950
 49 percent as a space 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:40.819
 previously I think that the repetition 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:44.020
 I already lost it, I'm not sure but I 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:51.050
 I was stayed with 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:54.110
 with 49 percent 49 percent 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:55.490
 it really was pretty hard I'm 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:58.790
 raising drinks but I'm really 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:00.500
 stealing is acceptably well testing 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.880
 well of the lic been dark in some 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.260
 Sometimes they have not stolen anything 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.480
 find also all outside so 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.100
 you have to break them and because you did not want 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.860
 show them this other repetition also 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:12.500
 apart from this troll village that hurt me 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:13.870
 I never quite expected me to get out 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.849
 Hence you the 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.880
 and this repetition because I wanted them 

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:20.380
 show more than everything by the end was a 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.459
 attack he could see a first amount for 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.510
 ccoo progression there was nothing in the 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:24.699
 castle nothing came out then 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:27.010
 we started with the attack comes out all over the 

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:29.229
 group of pigs moment we hope that 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:31.150
 come to an area where they see 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:33.729
 enough defenses that walks from 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:38.080
 splash and they can hurt my 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:41.430
 pigs then here destroy first the 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:44.949
 first hell sending the turn 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:48.160
 another healing spell so that where 

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:51.280
 come together and they can go healing 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.960
 and for good around the troops what 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.810
 I wanted to show you more everything is going to be 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:58.030
 the end to kameni that bomb people 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:59.170
 It destroyed a lot and because it left me very 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:01.660
 damaged he rode it because then 

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:03.830
 practically with a tap - 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:05.690
 they destroyed all 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:09.200
 what I wanted to show would be the end 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:12.160
 because it really was an ending that 

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:12.160
 I was more or less like 

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:19.320
 ten seconds for the attack to end 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:21.030
 but he is not telling me here and in 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.260
 this point I said good then I 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:25.230
 they study all mountain pigs two 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:27.120
 stars there are happy but seeing 

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:28.800
 that I had a few seconds left and 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:31.410
 days only these three good four 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:34.710
 defenses said good it is possible to make a 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:35.580
 100% so come on let's see what 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:36.990
 make 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:39.240
 let the troops keep advancing 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:41.280
 I did not want to finish the game because 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:44.340
 I wanted to see if it was possible in 100% 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:45.900
 funny that I could find that good 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:47.880
 I had a lightning spell and that I had to spare 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:51.360
 event I told them or ideal balance is dance 

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:54.800
 the lightning spell and why not 100% 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:57.450
 28 drinks that came to me great 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:59.040
 then nothing more or less what 

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:00.139
 we wanted that to go to what I wanted them 

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:02.539
 to show 

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:05.780
 and also tell them that they are not in fear 

00:06:02.539 --> 00:06:07.550
 I infer them as you can see good if 

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:09.319
 they have mounted pigs in attacking comments 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:11.330
 because with level 4 I do not recommend that 

00:06:09.319 --> 00:06:14.330
 attack with the inferno in multi 

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:16.009
 objective I tried several times of 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:19.960
 do it like a plug thing level 4 and I 

00:06:16.009 --> 00:06:22.069
 it came out and the attacks were fatal 

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:24.499
 because he mounts it with level 4 not 

00:06:22.069 --> 00:06:26.539
 they have as much life as much attack as the 

00:06:24.499 --> 00:06:30.080
 Level 5 since I have the level 

00:06:26.539 --> 00:06:31.430
 maximum level 5 if I am attacking villages 

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:34.610
 buying in the previous middle attack 

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:38.120
 a village with all that hell 

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:40.099
 then it can be 100% but it is 

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:42.860
 that's why I have advanced the 

00:06:40.099 --> 00:06:44.689
 ride pigs with level 4 I tried 

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:47.599
 do and it really came out to me fatal noble 

00:06:44.689 --> 00:06:49.909
 I managed to do even a star 

00:06:47.599 --> 00:06:52.150
 I think I stayed like 37 percent 

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:53.920
 that attack was fatal 

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:55.750
 but also with experience you go more 

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:58.000
 or less 

00:06:55.750 --> 00:07:00.190
 Knowing when to use the 

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.630
 spells sometimes and where 

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:03.520
 should enter or where he should 

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:05.110
 enter with a rides power things in a 

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:09.210
 village then more or less with the 

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:12.070
 experience you are improving the attacks 

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:14.020
 so then we want you in this 

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:17.020
 video that really seemed to me 

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:20.500
 pretty funny village that well for 

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:23.470
 little bit I get it costs me more or less 

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:26.140
 like 17 19 drinks more or less is something that 

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:29.740
 It has cost me but well I hope you have 

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:32.230
 liked the video I hope I have 

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:34.210
 taken this this repetition as a 

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:37.240
 example to not trust the villages 

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:40.060
 and because no luck to everyone when they go up 

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:42.790
 glasses and nothing we see until a next 

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:43.840
 episode until a next video and what 

00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:45.220
 we can do for they are many people 

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:46.930
 thanks for the support provided to them 

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:48.940
 I thank in each video for the support that 

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:50.290
 they are giving me the channel and support to 

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:54.030
 each of the videos good people 

00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:54.030
 thank you very much rules to the next chau
