two broad categories there's the

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.100 
two broad categories there's the
category<00:00:52.860> where<00:00:53.550> there's<00:00:54.000> a<00:00:54.090> large<00:00:54.480> hole<00:00:54.870> in

chambers of the heart and in those
children<00:01:00.140> repair<00:01:01.140> is<00:01:01.350> generally<00:01:01.770> necessary

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
children repair is generally necessary

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.130 
children repair is generally necessary
relatively<00:01:02.969> early<00:01:03.000> in<00:01:03.329> life<00:01:03.570> because<00:01:03.989> they

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
relatively early in life because they

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.679 
relatively early in life because they
behave<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.860> same<00:01:05.129> way<00:01:05.430> a<00:01:05.460> large<00:01:05.939> hole<00:01:06.360> in<00:01:06.570> the

behave the same way a large hole in the

the upper chambers of the heart those

the upper chambers of the heart those
holes<00:01:20.040> will<00:01:20.880> behave<00:01:21.210> more<00:01:21.659> like<00:01:21.689> a<00:01:21.930> hole<00:01:22.290> in
