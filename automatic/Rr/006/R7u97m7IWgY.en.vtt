00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:11.009 
here and i am here with a not really a
how-to<00:00:09.190> video<00:00:09.580> but<00:00:09.970> kind<00:00:10.150> of<00:00:10.210> a<00:00:10.300> cutaway<00:00:10.599> video

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:11.019 
how-to video but kind of a cutaway video

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:14.459 
how-to video but kind of a cutaway video
to<00:00:11.139> show<00:00:11.470> you<00:00:11.500> guys<00:00:11.679> how<00:00:11.889> this<00:00:12.370> works<00:00:12.669> now<00:00:13.469> one

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:14.469 
to show you guys how this works now one

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:16.860 
to show you guys how this works now one
of<00:00:14.559> the<00:00:14.620> things<00:00:14.860> that<00:00:15.040> I've<00:00:15.570> read<00:00:16.570> in<00:00:16.780> the

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:16.870 
of the things that I've read in the

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:18.840 
of the things that I've read in the
comments<00:00:17.380> is<00:00:17.500> there's<00:00:17.710> just<00:00:17.800> so<00:00:18.250> much<00:00:18.460> hate

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:18.850 
comments is there's just so much hate

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:21.240 
comments is there's just so much hate
and<00:00:19.120> I<00:00:19.240> don't<00:00:19.300> understand<00:00:19.810> why<00:00:20.019> because<00:00:20.800> this

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:21.250 
and I don't understand why because this

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:23.429 
and I don't understand why because this
is<00:00:21.400> my<00:00:21.609> design<00:00:21.970> this<00:00:22.210> is<00:00:22.390> what<00:00:22.599> I<00:00:22.630> did<00:00:22.960> it's<00:00:23.289> a

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:23.439 
is my design this is what I did it's a

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:24.929 
is my design this is what I did it's a
three<00:00:23.650> by<00:00:23.769> three<00:00:23.800> piston<00:00:24.429> door<00:00:24.640> and<00:00:24.820> yeah

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:24.939 
three by three piston door and yeah

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:26.730 
three by three piston door and yeah
anybody<00:00:25.240> can<00:00:25.449> make<00:00:25.689> a<00:00:25.750> three<00:00:26.019> by<00:00:26.140> three<00:00:26.170> piston

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:26.740 
anybody can make a three by three piston

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.620 
anybody can make a three by three piston
door<00:00:26.920> well<00:00:27.519> this<00:00:27.640> is<00:00:27.759> different<00:00:28.179> and<00:00:28.330> I<00:00:28.420> told

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:28.630 
door well this is different and I told

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.210 
door well this is different and I told
you<00:00:28.779> in<00:00:28.869> the<00:00:28.929> beginning<00:00:29.019> of<00:00:29.410> it<00:00:29.589> that<00:00:29.859> it<00:00:30.070> was

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:30.220 
you in the beginning of it that it was

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.790 
you in the beginning of it that it was
bulky<00:00:30.460> this<00:00:31.060> was<00:00:31.240> for<00:00:31.509> my<00:00:31.750> own<00:00:32.080> project<00:00:32.680> this

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:32.800 
bulky this was for my own project this

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.710 
bulky this was for my own project this
wasn't<00:00:33.070> to<00:00:33.640> give<00:00:33.820> you<00:00:33.970> guys<00:00:34.150> something<00:00:34.450> it<00:00:34.630> was

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:34.720 
wasn't to give you guys something it was

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.450 
wasn't to give you guys something it was
just<00:00:34.750> to<00:00:34.960> show<00:00:35.020> you<00:00:35.230> what<00:00:35.530> I<00:00:35.560> did<00:00:35.680> that's<00:00:36.280> all

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:36.460 
just to show you what I did that's all

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.700 
just to show you what I did that's all
it<00:00:36.610> was<00:00:36.790> in<00:00:37.060> granite<00:00:37.540> there<00:00:37.660> are<00:00:37.780> other<00:00:37.990> stuff

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:38.710 
it was in granite there are other stuff

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.040 
it was in granite there are other stuff
out<00:00:38.860> there<00:00:38.980> there's<00:00:39.190> 5x5<00:00:39.820> doors<00:00:40.120> there's<00:00:40.540> you

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.050 
out there there's 5x5 doors there's you

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.280 
out there there's 5x5 doors there's you
know<00:00:41.170> 15<00:00:42.010> by<00:00:42.250> 5<00:00:43.060> doors<00:00:43.420> or<00:00:43.690> whatever<00:00:44.050> there's

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:44.290 
know 15 by 5 doors or whatever there's

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:45.510 
know 15 by 5 doors or whatever there's
all<00:00:44.410> kinds<00:00:44.770> of<00:00:44.800> doors<00:00:44.980> out<00:00:45.160> there<00:00:45.340> and<00:00:45.460> I<00:00:45.490> think

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:45.520 
all kinds of doors out there and I think

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:46.710 
all kinds of doors out there and I think
that's<00:00:45.760> great<00:00:45.970> and<00:00:46.180> they've<00:00:46.270> done<00:00:46.450> a<00:00:46.480> good<00:00:46.660> job

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:46.720 
that's great and they've done a good job

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.840 
that's great and they've done a good job
with<00:00:47.110> them<00:00:47.290> this<00:00:47.770> is<00:00:47.920> what<00:00:48.070> I<00:00:48.100> did<00:00:48.400> and<00:00:48.610> I

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:48.850 
with them this is what I did and I

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.130 
with them this is what I did and I
wanted<00:00:49.150> to<00:00:49.210> share<00:00:49.420> with<00:00:49.570> you<00:00:49.630> guys<00:00:49.780> and

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:50.140 
wanted to share with you guys and

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.470 
wanted to share with you guys and
instead<00:00:50.530> I<00:00:50.740> get<00:00:51.040> like<00:00:51.430> a<00:00:51.610> bunch<00:00:51.850> of<00:00:51.970> hate<00:00:52.180> which

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:52.480 
instead I get like a bunch of hate which

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.210 
instead I get like a bunch of hate which
is<00:00:52.810> like<00:00:53.170> ridiculous<00:00:53.800> and<00:00:54.010> I<00:00:54.040> don't

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:54.220 
is like ridiculous and I don't

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.190 
is like ridiculous and I don't
understand<00:00:54.580> why<00:00:54.730> so<00:00:55.420> I'm<00:00:55.720> going<00:00:55.990> to<00:00:56.020> show<00:00:56.140> you

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:56.200 
understand why so I'm going to show you

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.080 
understand why so I'm going to show you
guys<00:00:56.380> how<00:00:56.440> it<00:00:56.830> works<00:00:57.070> because<00:00:57.310> it<00:00:57.610> works<00:00:57.790> a<00:00:57.940> lot

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.090 
guys how it works because it works a lot

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.540 
guys how it works because it works a lot
different<00:00:58.540> than<00:00:58.660> a<00:00:58.720> lot<00:00:58.900> of<00:00:58.930> other<00:00:59.170> doors<00:00:59.550> so

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:00.550 
different than a lot of other doors so

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:02.760 
different than a lot of other doors so
as<00:01:00.850> you<00:01:01.120> can<00:01:01.210> see<00:01:01.450> this<00:01:01.780> is<00:01:01.960> the<00:01:02.080> piston<00:01:02.260> setup

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:02.770 
as you can see this is the piston setup

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:05.670 
as you can see this is the piston setup
down<00:01:03.040> here<00:01:03.659> just<00:01:04.659> like<00:01:04.869> this<00:01:05.049> I've<00:01:05.290> got<00:01:05.439> four

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680 
down here just like this I've got four

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.889 
down here just like this I've got four
Pistons<00:01:06.100> stacked<00:01:06.430> here<00:01:06.700> I've<00:01:07.210> got<00:01:07.420> a<00:01:07.450> piston

00:01:07.889 --> 00:01:07.899 
Pistons stacked here I've got a piston

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:10.139 
Pistons stacked here I've got a piston
here<00:01:08.170> now<00:01:08.679> the<00:01:09.100> piston<00:01:09.429> that<00:01:09.460> it's<00:01:09.700> holding<00:01:10.000> on

00:01:10.139 --> 00:01:10.149 
here now the piston that it's holding on

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:12.090 
here now the piston that it's holding on
to<00:01:10.359> right<00:01:10.539> now<00:01:10.689> is<00:01:10.929> a<00:01:10.960> non<00:01:11.259> sticky<00:01:11.740> piston

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 
to right now is a non sticky piston

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.160 
to right now is a non sticky piston
that's<00:01:12.280> the<00:01:12.579> piston<00:01:12.969> that<00:01:13.119> pushes<00:01:13.630> the<00:01:13.960> block

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
that's the piston that pushes the block

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.469 
that's the piston that pushes the block
up<00:01:14.439> the<00:01:14.890> first<00:01:15.159> block<00:01:15.429> all<00:01:15.670> the<00:01:15.880> way<00:01:16.000> up<00:01:16.270> and

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:16.479 
up the first block all the way up and

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:19.020 
up the first block all the way up and
that's<00:01:16.960> what<00:01:17.140> enables<00:01:17.500> me<00:01:17.770> to<00:01:17.799> have<00:01:18.700> a<00:01:18.729> block

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
that's what enables me to have a block

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.200 
that's what enables me to have a block
in<00:01:19.240> the<00:01:19.329> middle<00:01:19.359> so<00:01:20.490> what<00:01:21.490> that<00:01:21.640> does<00:01:21.880> is<00:01:22.119> when

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 
in the middle so what that does is when

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.749 
in the middle so what that does is when
that<00:01:22.329> pulls<00:01:22.600> away<00:01:23.070> that<00:01:24.070> pushes<00:01:24.369> that<00:01:24.549> block

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:24.759 
that pulls away that pushes that block

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:26.849 
that pulls away that pushes that block
up<00:01:24.999> this<00:01:25.270> block<00:01:25.570> back<00:01:25.840> here<00:01:26.200> gets<00:01:26.409> pushed<00:01:26.649> out

00:01:26.849 --> 00:01:26.859 
up this block back here gets pushed out

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:29.069 
up this block back here gets pushed out
by<00:01:27.100> this<00:01:27.159> piston<00:01:27.850> here<00:01:28.179> which<00:01:28.749> is<00:01:28.899> then

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:29.079 
by this piston here which is then

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:30.959 
by this piston here which is then
brought<00:01:29.320> up<00:01:29.499> by<00:01:29.679> these<00:01:29.740> pistons<00:01:30.399> to<00:01:30.609> the<00:01:30.700> next

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:30.969 
brought up by these pistons to the next

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:33.209 
brought up by these pistons to the next
area<00:01:31.149> once<00:01:31.810> it<00:01:31.960> comes<00:01:32.140> up<00:01:32.319> there<00:01:32.679> then<00:01:33.100> the

00:01:33.209 --> 00:01:33.219 
area once it comes up there then the

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:35.010 
area once it comes up there then the
whole<00:01:33.399> thing<00:01:33.640> shuts<00:01:33.969> in<00:01:34.270> so<00:01:34.569> it<00:01:34.689> looks<00:01:34.869> like

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
whole thing shuts in so it looks like

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.510 
whole thing shuts in so it looks like
this<00:01:35.229> just<00:01:35.700> like<00:01:36.700> this<00:01:37.710> let's<00:01:38.710> watch<00:01:38.799> as<00:01:39.429> it

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
this just like this let's watch as it

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.209 
this just like this let's watch as it
pushes<00:01:39.759> it<00:01:40.030> up<00:01:40.119> comes<00:01:40.719> down<00:01:41.020> that<00:01:41.740> one<00:01:41.950> pulls

00:01:42.209 --> 00:01:42.219 
pushes it up comes down that one pulls

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:44.130 
pushes it up comes down that one pulls
it<00:01:42.369> to<00:01:42.490> the<00:01:42.609> side<00:01:42.850> then<00:01:43.359> this<00:01:43.539> one<00:01:43.749> comes<00:01:43.960> up

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
it to the side then this one comes up

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.980 
it to the side then this one comes up
and<00:01:44.439> it<00:01:45.069> goes<00:01:45.219> up<00:01:45.490> again<00:01:46.119> and<00:01:46.359> the<00:01:46.659> whole<00:01:46.749> door

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
and it goes up again and the whole door

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:48.389 
and it goes up again and the whole door
shuts<00:01:47.289> just<00:01:47.829> like<00:01:47.979> that

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:48.399 
shuts just like that

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:51.059 
shuts just like that
same<00:01:48.969> with<00:01:49.240> closing<00:01:49.869> it<00:01:49.990> so<00:01:50.380> if<00:01:50.469> you<00:01:50.590> close<00:01:50.829> it

00:01:51.059 --> 00:01:51.069 
same with closing it so if you close it

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:53.639 
same with closing it so if you close it
it<00:01:51.369> pulls<00:01:51.999> the<00:01:52.179> first<00:01:52.420> one<00:01:52.600> down<00:01:52.780> and<00:01:53.350> then

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:53.649 
it pulls the first one down and then

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:55.739 
it pulls the first one down and then
that<00:01:53.920> pulls<00:01:54.159> down<00:01:54.249> that<00:01:54.909> pulls<00:01:55.210> down<00:01:55.420> again

00:01:55.739 --> 00:01:55.749 
that pulls down that pulls down again

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:58.050 
that pulls down that pulls down again
then<00:01:56.289> it<00:01:56.439> pulls<00:01:56.619> it<00:01:56.770> back<00:01:56.799> then<00:01:57.639> it<00:01:57.759> goes<00:01:57.909> up

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
then it pulls it back then it goes up

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.090 
then it pulls it back then it goes up
grabs<00:01:58.359> the<00:01:58.509> other<00:01:58.719> one<00:01:58.960> that<00:01:59.259> grabs<00:01:59.560> that<00:01:59.889> one

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
grabs the other one that grabs that one

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.480 
grabs the other one that grabs that one
and<00:02:00.389> grabs<00:02:01.389> that<00:02:01.659> one<00:02:01.899> and<00:02:02.170> it<00:02:02.950> pulls<00:02:03.280> it<00:02:03.459> down

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
and grabs that one and it pulls it down

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.149 
and grabs that one and it pulls it down
and<00:02:03.999> resets<00:02:04.929> it<00:02:05.139> and<00:02:05.319> there<00:02:05.619> it<00:02:05.740> goes

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159 
and resets it and there it goes

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:09.900 
and resets it and there it goes
it's<00:02:06.310> open<00:02:06.639> so<00:02:07.240> that's<00:02:07.389> how<00:02:07.539> it<00:02:07.689> works<00:02:08.160> and<00:02:09.160> you

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
that this is the way I chose to do it

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.379 
that this is the way I chose to do it
and<00:03:16.750> that's<00:03:16.840> the<00:03:17.079> way<00:03:17.200> I<00:03:17.230> did<00:03:17.500> it<00:03:17.680> and<00:03:17.829> I<00:03:18.819> want

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:19.389 
and that's the way I did it and I want

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:20.909 
and that's the way I did it and I want
like<00:03:19.599> I<00:03:19.720> said<00:03:19.900> wanted<00:03:20.260> to<00:03:20.349> show<00:03:20.530> you<00:03:20.590> guys<00:03:20.859> how

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:20.919 
like I said wanted to show you guys how

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:23.580 
like I said wanted to show you guys how
it<00:03:21.280> works<00:03:21.310> so<00:03:21.760> I<00:03:21.790> cut<00:03:22.090> it<00:03:22.209> away<00:03:22.299> so<00:03:23.019> you<00:03:23.109> can<00:03:23.349> see

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
it works so I cut it away so you can see

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.920 
it works so I cut it away so you can see
how<00:03:23.859> every<00:03:24.489> bit<00:03:24.700> of<00:03:24.730> it<00:03:24.940> works<00:03:25.180> that's<00:03:25.480> all<00:03:25.780> it

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
how every bit of it works that's all it

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.199 
how every bit of it works that's all it
is<00:03:26.019> down<00:03:26.349> there<00:03:26.590> is<00:03:26.769> it's<00:03:27.340> those<00:03:27.639> Pistons

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
is down there is it's those Pistons

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:30.270 
is down there is it's those Pistons
right<00:03:28.930> there<00:03:29.200> that<00:03:29.769> are<00:03:29.889> basically

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
right there that are basically

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.670 
right there that are basically
controlling<00:03:30.940> everything<00:03:31.510> so<00:03:32.260> there's<00:03:32.500> the

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
controlling everything so there's the

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.170 
controlling everything so there's the
piston<00:03:32.980> cut<00:03:33.160> away<00:03:33.340> I'll<00:03:33.549> show<00:03:33.790> you<00:03:33.849> it<00:03:34.030> one

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
piston cut away I'll show you it one

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.979 
piston cut away I'll show you it one
more<00:03:34.389> time<00:03:34.569> you<00:03:36.000> can<00:03:37.000> see<00:03:37.180> how<00:03:37.239> this<00:03:37.419> works<00:03:37.599> so

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
more time you can see how this works so

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:40.500 
more time you can see how this works so
that<00:03:38.139> pushes<00:03:38.379> that<00:03:38.620> up<00:03:38.829> that<00:03:39.760> pushes<00:03:40.150> that<00:03:40.299> up

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
that pushes that up that pushes that up

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.690 
that pushes that up that pushes that up
grabs<00:03:40.810> that<00:03:41.049> that<00:03:41.440> one<00:03:41.590> pulls<00:03:41.829> the<00:03:42.010> non<00:03:42.340> sticky

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
grabs that that one pulls the non sticky

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.849 
grabs that that one pulls the non sticky
piston<00:03:43.030> back<00:03:43.209> this<00:03:43.720> one<00:03:43.959> pushes<00:03:44.290> that<00:03:44.470> one<00:03:44.650> up

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:44.859 
piston back this one pushes that one up

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:47.339 
piston back this one pushes that one up
and<00:03:45.099> the<00:03:45.430> whole<00:03:45.579> door<00:03:45.760> closes<00:03:46.239> if<00:03:46.930> we<00:03:47.139> do<00:03:47.230> it

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:47.349 
and the whole door closes if we do it

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:51.750 
and the whole door closes if we do it
again<00:03:48.540> and<00:03:49.540> it<00:03:49.629> will<00:03:49.750> pull<00:03:49.930> it<00:03:50.049> down<00:03:50.579> pulls<00:03:51.579> it

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
again and it will pull it down pulls it

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.849 
again and it will pull it down pulls it
down<00:03:51.910> again<00:03:52.269> then<00:03:53.019> this<00:03:53.230> one<00:03:53.410> will<00:03:53.620> pull<00:03:53.769> it

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:53.859 
down again then this one will pull it

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:57.210 
down again then this one will pull it
back<00:03:54.090> that<00:03:55.090> comes<00:03:55.359> up<00:03:55.569> that<00:03:56.019> grabs<00:03:56.349> it<00:03:56.590> that

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
back that comes up that grabs it that

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.129 
back that comes up that grabs it that
pulls<00:03:57.459> that<00:03:57.669> one<00:03:57.730> down<00:03:58.060> pulls<00:03:58.569> that<00:03:58.780> one<00:03:58.840> down

00:03:59.129 --> 00:03:59.139 
pulls that one down pulls that one down

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:03.240 
pulls that one down pulls that one down
and<00:03:59.430> grabs<00:04:00.430> it<00:04:00.609> and<00:04:00.900> opens<00:04:01.900> and<00:04:02.109> it's<00:04:02.319> done<00:04:02.500> so

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
and grabs it and opens and it's done so

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.089 
and grabs it and opens and it's done so
it<00:04:03.370> may<00:04:03.489> not<00:04:03.519> be<00:04:03.699> fast<00:04:04.030> or<00:04:04.930> whatever<00:04:05.319> it<00:04:05.769> works

00:04:06.089 --> 00:04:06.099 
it may not be fast or whatever it works

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:08.490 
it may not be fast or whatever it works
and<00:04:06.459> it<00:04:06.760> works<00:04:06.970> pretty<00:04:07.239> well<00:04:07.389> and<00:04:07.810> that's<00:04:08.349> how

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 
and it works pretty well and that's how

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:09.030 
and it works pretty well and that's how
it<00:04:08.620> goes

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
it goes

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.729 
it goes
that's<00:04:09.220> that's<00:04:09.579> how<00:04:09.699> it<00:04:09.849> works<00:04:10.030> so<00:04:10.620> once<00:04:11.620> again

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:11.739 
that's that's how it works so once again

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:14.729 
that's that's how it works so once again
I<00:04:12.069> didn't<00:04:12.639> mean<00:04:12.760> to<00:04:12.879> cause<00:04:13.090> a<00:04:13.120> big<00:04:13.480> ruckus<00:04:14.169> with

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:14.739 
I didn't mean to cause a big ruckus with

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:17.219 
I didn't mean to cause a big ruckus with
this<00:04:15.040> this<00:04:15.549> is<00:04:15.760> just<00:04:16.000> my<00:04:16.269> design<00:04:16.599> it's<00:04:16.959> the

00:04:17.219 --> 00:04:17.229 
this this is just my design it's the

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:19.259 
this this is just my design it's the
design<00:04:17.530> I<00:04:17.560> came<00:04:17.949> up<00:04:18.130> with<00:04:18.160> I'm<00:04:18.760> not<00:04:19.000> claiming

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:19.269 
design I came up with I'm not claiming

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:21.390 
design I came up with I'm not claiming
that<00:04:19.570> I<00:04:19.599> made<00:04:19.870> the<00:04:20.049> 3<00:04:20.260> by<00:04:20.380> 3<00:04:20.410> piston<00:04:21.039> door<00:04:21.220> by

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
that I made the 3 by 3 piston door by

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.459 
that I made the 3 by 3 piston door by
any<00:04:21.669> means<00:04:22.030> there's<00:04:22.630> a<00:04:22.690> lot<00:04:22.900> of<00:04:23.020> other<00:04:23.139> people

00:04:23.459 --> 00:04:23.469 
any means there's a lot of other people

00:04:23.469 --> 00:04:24.480 
any means there's a lot of other people
that<00:04:23.590> have<00:04:23.650> done<00:04:23.770> it

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 
that have done it

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.820 
that have done it
I<00:04:24.880> can<00:04:25.300> claim<00:04:25.509> that<00:04:25.569> it<00:04:26.020> has<00:04:26.199> no<00:04:26.410> Pistons

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
I can claim that it has no Pistons

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.760 
I can claim that it has no Pistons
showing<00:04:27.280> whatsoever<00:04:27.880> when<00:04:28.180> it's<00:04:28.360> done<00:04:28.770> either

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
showing whatsoever when it's done either

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.800 
showing whatsoever when it's done either
in<00:04:30.069> the<00:04:30.160> open<00:04:30.550> or<00:04:30.759> closed<00:04:31.090> position<00:04:31.210> so

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
in the open or closed position so

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:33.749 
in the open or closed position so
there's<00:04:31.990> no<00:04:32.169> Pistons<00:04:32.620> exposed<00:04:33.099> anywhere<00:04:33.520> and

00:04:33.749 --> 00:04:33.759 
there's no Pistons exposed anywhere and

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:35.670 
there's no Pistons exposed anywhere and
yes<00:04:34.210> it's<00:04:34.449> in<00:04:34.539> a<00:04:34.630> hallway<00:04:34.870> but<00:04:35.080> I<00:04:35.229> think<00:04:35.470> if<00:04:35.560> I

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
yes it's in a hallway but I think if I

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.290 
yes it's in a hallway but I think if I
revamp<00:04:36.099> this<00:04:36.280> I<00:04:36.460> could<00:04:36.669> put<00:04:36.819> it<00:04:36.910> in<00:04:37.030> a<00:04:37.060> few

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300 
revamp this I could put it in a few

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:38.850 
revamp this I could put it in a few
things<00:04:37.509> I<00:04:37.630> could<00:04:37.780> make<00:04:37.960> it<00:04:38.139> a<00:04:38.259> lot<00:04:38.470> different

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
things I could make it a lot different

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.159 
things I could make it a lot different
but<00:04:39.430> like<00:04:39.729> I<00:04:39.819> said<00:04:39.880> before<00:04:40.030> you<00:04:40.509> can<00:04:40.539> do<00:04:40.810> a<00:04:40.840> lot

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:41.169 
but like I said before you can do a lot

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:43.890 
but like I said before you can do a lot
of<00:04:41.319> things<00:04:41.650> with<00:04:42.370> what<00:04:43.000> I'm<00:04:43.120> doing<00:04:43.150> here<00:04:43.690> with

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 
of things with what I'm doing here with

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.260 
of things with what I'm doing here with
this<00:04:44.080> card<00:04:44.410> reader<00:04:44.620> this<00:04:45.160> thing<00:04:45.460> over<00:04:45.849> here<00:04:46.150> I

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
this card reader this thing over here I

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:48.029 
this card reader this thing over here I
mean<00:04:46.509> this<00:04:46.750> is<00:04:47.020> literally<00:04:47.349> like<00:04:47.530> a<00:04:47.560> program

00:04:48.029 --> 00:04:48.039 
mean this is literally like a program

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:50.370 
mean this is literally like a program
it's<00:04:48.310> running<00:04:48.729> a<00:04:48.789> program<00:04:49.210> around<00:04:49.660> there<00:04:50.169> and

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:50.380 
it's running a program around there and

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:52.680 
it's running a program around there and
telling<00:04:50.710> that<00:04:50.740> door<00:04:51.160> to<00:04:51.310> open<00:04:51.340> and<00:04:51.729> close<00:04:52.000> so

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:52.690 
telling that door to open and close so

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:55.350 
telling that door to open and close so
once<00:04:53.199> again<00:04:53.319> I<00:04:53.620> stand<00:04:53.919> by<00:04:54.130> what<00:04:54.310> I<00:04:54.340> said<00:04:54.430> I<00:04:54.789> feel
