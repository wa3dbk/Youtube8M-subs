00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:14.639
 between fans of the two wheels there are two 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.619
 types of those in love 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.350
 always taking care of the bike to keep her 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.060
 always with the original face and also the 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.340
 who are never satisfied with what 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:33.180
 have and think they can make the model 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:35.670
 understand a little more and when the 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.410
 to generate a better performance than 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.440
 there is no shortage of equipment in the market 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:44.329
 with the promise of improving torque strength 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.329
 consumption and more 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.030
 and among all the items one of the most 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:57.570
 sports exhaust is 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:00.030
 first came the aesthetic the snoring is and 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.120
 then the personal power gain touches 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.339
 of the king for esthetics is aesthetics and noise 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.810
 but it still leaves a lot of people with 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.040
 doubts about your true 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.049
 virtues 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.570
 after all, the exhaust is not the part of 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:15.560
 then it does not only change the 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.560
 visual death 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.229
 the sports exhaust has a 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.420
 more direct system than what common 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.060
 causes the engine gases to be 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.710
 released with greater speed 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.220
 influencing directly the power of the 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.320
 moto 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.630
 The manufacturer for this brand speaks 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.850
 you change the complete exhaust is can 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.140
 to win from 5 to 7 horses pointed 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.509
 sports you have a performance 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.680
 when you install as much weight as the 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.540
 released on 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.180
 Ideally, you should do all the 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.520
 motorcycle also to receive 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.860
 The power gain indicator may not 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.320
 seem much but another virtue of 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.960
 exhaust is the relief in the weight of the bike 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.720
 where any grass - gets to do 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:04.950
 difference there is complete exhaust 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:06.119
 it titanium stainless steel from the collector by pulling 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.860
 the catalyst 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.229
 the border finish equal to that 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.480
 we have some bikes that you 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.560
 take up to 12 kilos of your own 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.630
 motorcycle 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.519
 this reduction is due to the 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.280
 exhaust materials that 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:23.310
 are very light director of issuing thani 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.739
 all titanium with will happen with 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.500
 carbon finish but the price to be 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:30.959
 paid for these materials is not cheap and 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.730
 it is worth remembering that to really improve 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:35.400
 Motorcycle performance the 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:38.720
 modifications go much further since all 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.720
 the interconnected mechanics
