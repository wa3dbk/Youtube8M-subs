00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 hello friends of the movie welcome to 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.960
 dvd review and in today's star trek 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.599
 double feature here on dvd review because 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.460
 i had the great luck star trek into 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.139
 darkness already yesterday at the 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.420
 See Germany premiere here in Berlin 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.400
 of course it is the criticism 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.529
 Guilty and there are 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:26.550
 now just star trek into darkness 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:28.429
 you think your world would be safe that is 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.689
 an illusion 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:33.349
 enjoy these last moments of the 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.349
 peace 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.449
 of the ones in London know the 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.839
 Most of the other the bike was one 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:46.839
 our best 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.450
 their commander committed a crime 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:55.950
 that I can not forgive 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:55.950
 none of them is safe 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.370
 I have your attention now 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.520
 maybe or otherwise 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.899
 not willing to bring in the amplifier 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.829
 City people are not about revenge 

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:11.829
 perhaps should, however, 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.590
 because you are not really 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.100
 afterwards I have no idea what I am 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.060
 to do 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.060
 I only know what I can do 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.470
 do you have 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:32.800
 but I do not think so 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.800
 that you can call it that 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:36.460
 I got this innocent cash 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:39.780
 has acquired people for what we do 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.780
 they will pay 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.030
 They have no idea what they did 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:48.010
 to have 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.010
 as soon as i talk about your old canada 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.030
 the company 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.380
 Not 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.380
 completely wrong 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.130
 I'm better 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.130
 almost in all 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:38.960
 star trek this is from the year 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:41.610
 2012 is 129 minutes starts on 9 may 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:43.290
 2013 in German cinemas is from twelve 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.570
 released years and tells the 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.070
 story just made the 2009 a movie star 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:48.690
 trek who is also the eleventh star 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:51.000
 trek films where star trek into 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.220
 darkness the twelfth film is consistent 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.170
 further after having got told how exactly 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.760
 spock and kirk become to have the 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.770
 she just wanted and how she maybe 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.870
 especially theirs will find each other 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:02.850
 ties star trek into darkness 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.170
 deepened deeply and after the film 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:06.060
 so that it begins to tell how the 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.770
 some others never rescind 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.630
 as half Vulcan can not lie and 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.950
 always the rules followed the other 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.840
 again in the pan skin what 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.100
 demotion and displacement result 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.530
 has both land then again 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.180
 somehow on the enterprise to that 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.070
 history around the bike unterhuber the 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.390
 time intermittently sometimes stress 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:23.220
 have and all the very funny 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:26.070
 fashion is shown dives 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:28.560
 all at once a villain played by 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:30.240
 benedict cumberbatch and who or what 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.590
 really behind it and what its 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.690
 intention are the job 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.910
 really not betrayed because that would be 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:38.100
 just a surprise incidentally what 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.270
 for a nice word, because you have to 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.190
 do not know then you can watch the movie too 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:42.930
 enjoy much better and all the around 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.100
 to be aware of the figure already be little 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.750
 should perhaps also in the 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.040
 hold back comments that would be nice 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.600
 to all others 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.100
 That's why I like the content here 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.900
 maybe a little left and 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.190
 More about the film and talk to each other 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.690
 because I already have my criticism 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.970
 To start, I'm not the big one 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:59.730
 spaceship enterprise fan on the spot 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.710
 but both star trek the 2009er version 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.780
 I found really good entertaining game 

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:06.240
 at once star trek into darkness 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.710
 is quite a hammer and really fun 

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:09.900
 makes to watch the movie in the cinema 

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:11.490
 The movie is unbelievable 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.170
 funny at many places but not so 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:15.000
 stupid funny but especially for 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.109
 insider and trekkies has the film of 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.120
 between the individual binding of the 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:19.820
 figures are a lot of fun and cool 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.450
 and the characters are so beautiful too 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:23.190
 different in the place that 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:24.720
 really fun makes this act 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.700
 to watch them act and 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.770
 lots of little looks and money right in 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.720
 direction vulkanier there is yes k victory 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.130
 The cinema is really light on the floor 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.720
 laugh and that's really fun 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:36.090
 but from the point where then if the 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:38.370
 Comeback will show up at the latest 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:40.560
 the film the necessary seriousness and hardness 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.300
 and that's really fun while 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.770
 we beside christine the whole 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:46.199
 very neat always played so the 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:47.520
 the solid core is in the middle 

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:49.440
 we have zachary quinto the me again 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.449
 incredibly like those very rare 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.280
 that makes it really great we have the 

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:54.599
 I totally like the pill I do the 2 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.699
 And last but not at all here 

00:04:54.599 --> 00:04:58.020
 in star trek into darkness as well 

00:04:56.699 --> 00:04:59.520
 I really like him in star trek 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.870
 lsf gives the blonde a bit 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.699
 beauty that somehow you take that way 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.620
 Consumers have the feeling you pack 

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:05.849
 as god this will be great again 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.229
 especially with his older buddy 

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:09.210
 here are two more gigs 

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:11.159
 more in which it is really fun in 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:13.139
 Kinosaal to his johnny again 

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:14.849
 we are the first Czech really 

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:16.409
 cool the figure it has really cool too 

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:17.879
 here again when she whirled around with 

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:20.400
 accent talks is fun and fun 

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:22.379
 next benedict cumberbatch one should 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.810
 necessarily the film in the 

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:26.069
 original voice original sound to mr 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:28.020
 the voice of the then even deeper 

00:05:26.069 --> 00:05:29.520
 patched it's just awesome 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:31.199
 and while everyone else is cast 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:32.819
 really good to very well acting creates 

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:33.539
 the cumberbatch nevertheless all of them to the 

00:05:32.819 --> 00:05:36.090
 wall to play 

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:38.280
 The man is just an exceptional talent 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:39.930
 and that makes it great here would be that 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:42.090
 not enough as if we had a great one 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:44.099
 cast we would have really good music in 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:45.509
 The effects of the movie are great 

00:05:44.099 --> 00:05:47.819
 and a small comparison what that 

00:05:45.509 --> 00:05:48.840
 3d to a m3 times to pull in 

00:05:47.819 --> 00:05:50.819
 the saving of the week in the 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:52.380
 German cinemas on all three is everything 

00:05:50.819 --> 00:05:54.029
 subsequently completed the 3d victory 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:55.380
 unbelievably bad from what i got from 

00:05:54.029 --> 00:05:56.729
 Marvin's were used to it all at once 

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:57.750
 here in star trek a week later 

00:05:56.729 --> 00:06:00.389
 we get a movie in the german 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:01.740
 Cinemas are looking forward to a really great 3d 

00:06:00.389 --> 00:06:03.389
 so it's really worth it 

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:06.120
 Supplement to the number that is really fun 

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:07.949
 and above all an unprecedented effect 

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:09.840
 was perfect if the enterprise then 

00:06:07.949 --> 00:06:11.940
 at all speed, he moved 

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:14.430
 really cool looks from the tonia class 

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:16.199
 made that 3d just the hall to 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:17.690
 you bring great light 3d you see 

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:20.009
 we had done right so fun 

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:21.750
 think about the few euros more for it 

00:06:20.009 --> 00:06:23.550
 if you have been watching the movie since then 

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:25.379
 otherwise the film is just as said 

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:27.270
 for trekkies the right one as many 

00:06:25.379 --> 00:06:29.069
 Newbies entertaining and the 129th 

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:31.770
 minutes over two hours 

00:06:29.069 --> 00:06:32.669
 they just look that way 

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:33.750
 would have been an hour longer 

00:06:32.669 --> 00:06:35.310
 the movies we can go 

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:37.050
 not at all bad and it was 

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:39.000
 is there for me the so-called batman 

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:40.919
 Effect of the second part much better than 

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.659
 the first of these two of the 2009 on 

00:06:40.919 --> 00:06:44.460
 these always belong together so here 

00:06:42.659 --> 00:06:45.750
 roughly summarized correctly glass and 

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:47.129
 always from me gives great thumbs up 

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:48.900
 goes to the cinema all on the 

00:06:47.129 --> 00:06:49.770
 movie friend are happy to right he is 

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:51.340
 great class 

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:52.750
 I hope I have not revealed anything 

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:54.130
 absolutely restrain myself what the 

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:55.360
 In terms of content I wanted something else 

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:57.370
 important things to say right now 

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:59.169
 ok friends that was it otherwise 

00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:00.970
 we come to the evaluation family first drake 

00:06:59.169 --> 00:07:04.180
 into darkness as science fiction 

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:06.280
 action-strong, nine out of ten 

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:08.500
 possible points only deductions are me 

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:10.210
 to explain that in a nutshell 

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:12.010
 topic between kirk and spock and 

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:13.960
 Your friendship will be very much in the movie 

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:15.520
 often tackled and once it will be 

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:16.990
 but a bit too intense and too 

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:18.699
 whiny that's kind of not like that 

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:20.350
 quite fit but that would be itself 

00:07:18.699 --> 00:07:21.970
 See in the cinema and can tell me how 

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:24.220
 you find that and overall it gets 

00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:26.169
 film for me strong 8 out of 10 possible 

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:26.979
 delighted to score going to the cinema so 

00:07:26.169 --> 00:07:28.450
 I have a lot of fun 

00:07:26.979 --> 00:07:30.220
 if you still feel like it, click on it 

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:32.380
 any case my criticism to star trek that 

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:34.240
 preliminary for the just from the year 2009 

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:35.470
 or my last trailer check looks 

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:36.729
 have past twitter and facebook 

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:38.470
