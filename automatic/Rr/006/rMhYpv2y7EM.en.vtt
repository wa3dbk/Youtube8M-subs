00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
this one's round it's not the 2x4 brick

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:19.229 
this one's round it's not the 2x4 brick
that<00:02:17.060> we<00:02:17.150> looked<00:02:17.359> at<00:02:17.480> with<00:02:17.689> both<00:02:17.930> fennekin<00:02:18.829> and

gonna do for this first things first is
you<00:02:25.670> gotta<00:02:25.879> open<00:02:26.090> this<00:02:26.450> up

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
you gotta open this up

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.800 
you gotta open this up
just<00:02:28.430> like<00:02:28.700> that<00:02:28.969> so<00:02:29.329> you<00:02:29.389> want<00:02:29.599> something

just like that so you want something
that<00:02:30.139> is<00:02:30.439> flat

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:31.549 
that is flat

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:35.860 
that is flat
well<00:02:31.700> flat<00:02:32.120> I<00:02:32.150> should<00:02:32.420> say<00:02:32.569> on<00:02:32.629> one<00:02:32.840> side<00:02:34.870> then

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
well flat I should say on one side then

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.020 
well flat I should say on one side then
you're<00:02:36.139> gonna<00:02:36.230> spin<00:02:36.769> around<00:02:36.889> and<00:02:37.340> you'll<00:02:37.790> see

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
you're gonna spin around and you'll see

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.619 
you're gonna spin around and you'll see
that<00:02:38.329> there's<00:02:38.629> sections<00:02:39.500> for<00:02:39.829> for<00:02:40.340> brick<00:02:40.700> for

00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:41.629 
that there's sections for for brick for

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:45.039 
that there's sections for for brick for
peg<00:02:41.959> bricks<00:02:42.439> on<00:02:42.709> either<00:02:42.859> side<00:02:43.389> take<00:02:44.389> the<00:02:44.419> belly

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:45.049 
peg bricks on either side take the belly

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:50.220 
peg bricks on either side take the belly
first<00:02:46.000> chespin<00:02:47.000> and<00:02:48.040> paint<00:02:49.040> that<00:02:49.159> into<00:02:49.609> place

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
first chespin and paint that into place

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.599 
first chespin and paint that into place
the<00:02:51.230> hardest<00:02:51.560> part<00:02:51.739> I<00:02:51.829> think<00:02:51.859> of<00:02:52.099> anything<00:02:52.340> is

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:52.609 
the hardest part I think of anything is

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:54.909 
the hardest part I think of anything is
just<00:02:53.180> it<00:02:53.329> is<00:02:53.389> just<00:02:53.599> lining<00:02:54.049> up<00:02:54.139> the<00:02:54.319> pegs

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:54.919 
just it is just lining up the pegs

00:02:54.919 --> 00:02:59.830 
just it is just lining up the pegs
to<00:02:55.250> the<00:02:55.370> holes<00:02:55.989> then<00:02:56.989> take<00:02:57.680> the<00:02:57.859> head<00:02:58.840> snap

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
to the holes then take the head snap

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.220 
to the holes then take the head snap
that<00:03:00.109> into<00:03:00.230> place<00:03:00.290> like<00:03:00.709> that<00:03:02.049> then<00:03:03.049> you're

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
that into place like that then you're

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.729 
that into place like that then you're
gonna<00:03:03.319> take<00:03:03.590> the<00:03:03.650> legs<00:03:04.900> making<00:03:05.900> sure<00:03:06.260> that<00:03:06.500> you

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:06.739 
gonna take the legs making sure that you

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:10.089 
gonna take the legs making sure that you
have<00:03:06.980> them<00:03:07.250> going<00:03:07.430> the<00:03:07.609> right<00:03:07.760> way<00:03:08.949> we<00:03:09.949> go

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:10.099 
have them going the right way we go

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:15.129 
have them going the right way we go
there's<00:03:10.310> leg<00:03:10.669> number<00:03:10.939> one<00:03:11.769> and<00:03:12.769> leg<00:03:14.139> leg

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:15.139 
there's leg number one and leg leg

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:17.039 
there's leg number one and leg leg
number<00:03:15.319> two<00:03:15.620> there<00:03:15.919> we<00:03:15.980> go

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.049 
number two there we go

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:20.229 
number two there we go
chespin<00:03:18.049> all<00:03:18.169> obviously<00:03:19.129> needs<00:03:19.489> himself<00:03:19.849> some

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 
chespin all obviously needs himself some

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:22.839 
chespin all obviously needs himself some
arms<00:03:20.629> don't<00:03:21.019> put<00:03:21.139> the<00:03:21.259> arms<00:03:21.560> into<00:03:21.799> place<00:03:22.009> like

00:03:22.839 --> 00:03:22.849 
arms don't put the arms into place like

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:29.140 
arms don't put the arms into place like
that<00:03:23.859> the<00:03:24.859> other<00:03:24.979> arm<00:03:25.689> like<00:03:26.689> that<00:03:26.989> and<00:03:28.150> last

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
that the other arm like that and last

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:30.990 
that the other arm like that and last
but<00:03:29.449> certainly<00:03:29.509> not<00:03:29.810> least<00:03:30.079> flip<00:03:30.560> them<00:03:30.769> around

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
but certainly not least flip them around

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.119 
but certainly not least flip them around
and<00:03:32.000> you're<00:03:32.239> gonna<00:03:32.359> take<00:03:32.659> the<00:03:32.870> tail<00:03:33.530> and<00:03:33.859> take

00:03:34.119 --> 00:03:34.129 
and you're gonna take the tail and take

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:37.990 
and you're gonna take the tail and take
that<00:03:34.280> into<00:03:34.459> place<00:03:36.459> and<00:03:37.459> just<00:03:37.489> like<00:03:37.819> that

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
that into place and just like that

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.879 
that into place and just like that
you've<00:03:38.389> got<00:03:38.599> yourself<00:03:38.720> chespin

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:39.889 
you've got yourself chespin

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:46.030 
you've got yourself chespin
I<00:03:42.459> like<00:03:43.459> how<00:03:43.639> they've<00:03:43.790> taken<00:03:44.090> a<00:03:44.680> brick<00:03:45.680> like

display stand so you can take chespin

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.539 
display stand so you can take chespin
and<00:04:09.799> peg<00:04:10.129> him<00:04:10.250> onto<00:04:10.459> his<00:04:10.489> displaced<00:04:11.000> and<00:04:12.549> just
