00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.880
 The next business day begins. 

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.160
 But do you get what you need 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.920
 in terms of operational and commercial efficiency? 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.400
 Perhaps, if you take a closer look at the new robust and versatile Volvo FE, 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.360
 you will be able to decide. 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.640
 The truck has a new impressive look, 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.840
 which is the successor to Volvo's classic design. 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.160
 Another significant improvement is that Volvo FE 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.480
 is already available with our widely recognized I-Shift transmission system. 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.120
 For the driver this means more comfort 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.160
 and less workload at work, 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.400
 , and for the carrier - greater fuel economy. 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.600
 The completely new range of Euro 6 engines, 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.520
 ensures that the appropriate power is always available. 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.200
 A stable, sturdy chassis 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.720
 means that the truck can reach more places 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.360
 easier and more efficient. 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:08.000
 So from the city's boulevards to the suburban streets, or even in slightly intersected areas, 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.520
 the new Volvo FE will not mislead you. 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.280
 The carefully designed cabin makes the new Volvo FE ideal 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.720
 for convenient and intuitive operation, as well as for multiple uploads and descents from the truck. 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.080
 This is the truck that has the same respect 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.680
 to pedestrians and other road users. 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.320
 From regional transport to light construction work, 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.360
 communal services and transport of frozen products - 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.520
 all these features allow the new Volvo FE 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.000
 to respond to a wide range of challenges. 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.960
 Good news for you, great news and for your business.
