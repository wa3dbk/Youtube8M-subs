all<00:00:02.220> right<00:00:02.429> so<00:00:02.820> this<00:00:03.210> is<00:00:03.389> a<00:00:03.419> quick<00:00:03.720> demo<00:00:04.380> of<00:00:04.759> the

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
all right so this is a quick demo of the

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.400 
all right so this is a quick demo of the
endless<00:00:07.069> two<00:00:08.069> deterrent<00:00:08.580> generator<00:00:09.059> and<00:00:09.410> you

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
endless two deterrent generator and you

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.230 
endless two deterrent generator and you
can<00:00:10.590> see<00:00:10.830> this<00:00:11.040> is<00:00:11.190> a<00:00:11.219> simple<00:00:11.460> endless<00:00:12.000> runner

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
can see this is a simple endless runner

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.690 
can see this is a simple endless runner
with<00:00:12.900> the<00:00:13.110> default<00:00:13.889> character<00:00:14.280> controller

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
with the default character controller

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.370 
with the default character controller
being<00:00:15.030> used<00:00:15.269> and<00:00:16.730> the<00:00:17.730> terrain<00:00:18.330> is<00:00:18.690> generated

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
being used and the terrain is generated

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.170 
being used and the terrain is generated
as<00:00:19.529> it's<00:00:19.920> needed<00:00:20.130> and<00:00:20.490> it's<00:00:21.420> destroyed<00:00:22.279> as<00:00:23.279> it

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
as it's needed and it's destroyed as it

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.050 
as it's needed and it's destroyed as it
passes<00:00:24.689> out<00:00:24.869> of<00:00:24.930> the<00:00:25.109> camera<00:00:25.560> view<00:00:25.590> so<00:00:26.490> you're

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
passes out of the camera view so you're

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.030 
passes out of the camera view so you're
only<00:00:27.359> using<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:28.500> resources<00:00:29.039> that<00:00:29.160> you<00:00:29.279> need

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:31.040 
only using the resources that you need

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.370 
only using the resources that you need
it's<00:00:32.040> also<00:00:32.219> very<00:00:32.520> easy<00:00:32.669> to<00:00:32.940> change<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.660> look

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
it's also very easy to change the look

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.729 
it's also very easy to change the look
and<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:35.190> feel<00:00:35.820> of<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.540> terrain<00:00:36.840> right<00:00:37.530> now

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
and the feel of the terrain right now

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.220 
and the feel of the terrain right now
we're<00:00:37.980> using<00:00:38.010> a<00:00:38.520> rock<00:00:39.300> material<00:00:39.899> for<00:00:40.140> the

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
we're using a rock material for the

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.970 
we're using a rock material for the
front<00:00:40.969> with<00:00:41.969> a<00:00:42.000> height<00:00:42.270> of<00:00:42.300> 50<00:00:42.930> so<00:00:43.590> we<00:00:43.829> can

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
front with a height of 50 so we can

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.979 
front with a height of 50 so we can
adjust<00:00:44.070> that<00:00:44.460> height<00:00:44.730> make<00:00:45.120> it<00:00:45.300> taller<00:00:45.600> or

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
adjust that height make it taller or

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.160 
adjust that height make it taller or
shorter<00:00:46.430> we<00:00:47.430> can<00:00:47.610> adjust<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.969> material<00:00:48.539> so

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
shorter we can adjust the material so

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.189 
shorter we can adjust the material so
right<00:00:49.350> now<00:00:49.500> I'm<00:00:49.620> going<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:49.860> swap<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.340> material

00:00:51.189 --> 00:00:51.199 
right now I'm going to swap the material

00:00:51.199 --> 00:01:02.000 
right now I'm going to swap the material
for<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.500> top<00:00:53.430> at<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.760> front<00:00:55.430> and<00:01:00.739> you<00:01:01.739> can<00:01:01.770> see

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
for the top at the front and you can see

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.859 
for the top at the front and you can see
I<00:01:02.550> can<00:01:02.760> adjust<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:04.250> the<00:01:05.250> size<00:01:05.760> of<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.030> top<00:01:06.270> and

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
I can adjust the the size of the top and

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.740 
I can adjust the the size of the top and
the<00:01:07.680> terrain<00:01:08.549> is<00:01:08.729> regenerated<00:01:09.360> every<00:01:09.540> time

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
the terrain is regenerated every time

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.100 
the terrain is regenerated every time
because<00:01:10.049> it's<00:01:10.229> random<00:01:11.040> right<00:01:11.250> now<00:01:11.460> so<00:01:12.450> we

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
because it's random right now so we

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.230 
because it's random right now so we
changed<00:01:13.439> it<00:01:13.500> to<00:01:13.560> repeat<00:01:14.010> it<00:01:14.189> and<00:01:14.369> you<00:01:14.790> can<00:01:14.970> see

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
changed it to repeat it and you can see

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.289 
changed it to repeat it and you can see
that<00:01:15.540> it<00:01:15.720> has<00:01:15.990> a<00:01:16.470> very<00:01:16.890> different<00:01:17.250> look<00:01:18.150> and

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
that it has a very different look and

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.880 
that it has a very different look and
feel<00:01:18.360> than<00:01:18.810> what<00:01:18.960> it<00:01:19.080> had<00:01:20.119> just<00:01:21.119> a<00:01:21.299> moment<00:01:21.600> ago

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
feel than what it had just a moment ago

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.420 
feel than what it had just a moment ago
with<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.630> the<00:01:24.630> other<00:01:24.840> settings<00:01:25.350> so<00:01:25.830> you<00:01:26.130> can

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
with the the other settings so you can

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.850 
with the the other settings so you can
get<00:01:26.610> a<00:01:26.640> lot<00:01:26.970> of<00:01:27.060> different<00:01:27.360> looks<00:01:27.590> with<00:01:28.590> very

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
get a lot of different looks with very

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.039 
get a lot of different looks with very
little<00:01:29.040> effort<00:01:29.250> and<00:01:29.670> you<00:01:30.420> can<00:01:30.630> spend<00:01:30.990> your

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
little effort and you can spend your

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:36.039 
little effort and you can spend your
time<00:01:31.170> focusing<00:01:31.770> more<00:01:32.280> on<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:33.710> gameplay<00:01:34.710> and

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
time focusing more on the gameplay and

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:38.780 
time focusing more on the gameplay and
then<00:01:37.049> getting<00:01:37.259> your<00:01:37.560> your<00:01:38.009> terrain<00:01:38.340> working

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
then getting your your terrain working

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.069 
then getting your your terrain working
so<00:01:38.970> this<00:01:39.119> is<00:01:39.299> great<00:01:39.509> for<00:01:39.689> rapid<00:01:40.049> prototyping

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
so this is great for rapid prototyping

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.880 
so this is great for rapid prototyping
and<00:01:41.060> you<00:01:42.060> can<00:01:42.210> also<00:01:42.390> see<00:01:42.689> the

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
and you can also see the

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.850 
and you can also see the
the<00:01:44.890> prefabs<00:01:45.369> here<00:01:45.759> are<00:01:45.970> pooled<00:01:46.960> so<00:01:47.380> there's<00:01:47.590> a

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
the prefabs here are pooled so there's a

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:54.240 
the prefabs here are pooled so there's a
a<00:01:49.680> those<00:01:50.680> get<00:01:50.920> reused<00:01:51.400> as<00:01:52.150> needed<00:01:52.750> and<00:01:53.140> we<00:01:54.070> have

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
a those get reused as needed and we have

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.070 
a those get reused as needed and we have
a<00:01:54.280> bunch<00:01:54.580> of<00:01:54.670> different<00:01:54.850> twelve<00:01:55.540> edge<00:01:55.750> pieces

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.080 
a bunch of different twelve edge pieces

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.310 
a bunch of different twelve edge pieces
are<00:01:57.000> being<00:01:58.000> dynamically<00:01:58.570> generated<00:01:59.140> at

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 
are being dynamically generated at

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.550 
are being dynamically generated at
making<00:01:59.649> up<00:01:59.740> our<00:01:59.920> terrain<00:02:00.280> so<00:02:00.940> I<00:02:01.869> hope<00:02:02.409> you

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
making up our terrain so I hope you

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.609 
making up our terrain so I hope you
enjoyed<00:02:02.920> it<00:02:03.039> and<00:02:03.630> I'd<00:02:04.630> love<00:02:04.960> for<00:02:05.020> you<00:02:05.470> all<00:02:05.500> to
