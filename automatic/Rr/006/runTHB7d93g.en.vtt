00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 as the quiet Walter Bischoff Guild Wars 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.070
 Lakics can of course be very good for beginners 

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:10.300
 so that they have mob one percent with no policy to go on Osmann 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:10.880
 should 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.260
 but later you should really make a picture with which you also play 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:14.769
 can 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:16.379
 what you really percent 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:17.890
 perfect can 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.310
 and the man now again make a match so that's right here 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.689
 position 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:27.630
 there would be 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.109
 would 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:32.109
 fly or not 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.770
 Nine times back it was really messed up and I mean well known before 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.130
 is given 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:42.480
 Minute sealed 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.480
 what helps 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.020
 Heinrich and PvP degrees heat 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.020
 but we can 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.830
 the poor he still student of the 9 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:04.030
 China is a front 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.540
 yes and that is my picture 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.290
 like the ISM Karcher ja theater is also not liked 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.170
 Eat but totally percent of the votes Gaal so I do not go after the 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.060
 Draftsman as he says how do you act as a team 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.439
 one percent over time yes I still want the classes to play games 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:24.670
 and 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:25.719
 we look 

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:27.060
 if we can do that 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.909
 yes the experts slower to come to the positive yes is in any case 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.680
 the graphics this very nice of the house percent evil Kaya if only I think 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:35.810
 that it at the 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.970
 The first critical year percent I got was the soundtrack 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.410
 I did not belong to farmland for free 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:45.990
 because he was just leaving yes 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.770
 yes the graphics percent the gameplay by all means yes there are really here 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.300
 no head and shoulders words 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:53.510
 the players 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.940
 yes it's all about Nazgul yes 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.940
 you have to be really successful we are here 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.400
 Warlam 4 percent PvP really 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.470
 he is just in the movie, how would they really get started? 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.149
 it's just a genius 

00:02:11.149 --> 00:02:14.929
 PvP give in can mean percent in my eyes year 

00:02:14.929 --> 00:02:16.920
 in front of him on the rail too 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.979
 yes it is like that 

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:22.919
 The folk-legend's best 90 percent of what's on the market right now 

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:28.969
 and percent what a bit closer deep that's really bitter r 

00:02:28.969 --> 00:02:33.689
 degenerates in percent yes in two unworthy to have the Euros for the set 

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:36.419
 but otherwise 

00:02:36.419 --> 00:02:40.199
 there you can say unfortunately it is 15 4 percent the outside world 

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:42.049
 Waffensen is a pity 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:43.219
 but 

00:02:43.219 --> 00:02:46.950
 Clearly you can live with it by all means if you are in its Stammbar then 

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:48.589
 Of course, that's fun as well 

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:52.819
 and that's why he also sees me need a second place so yes 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:55.819
 so now it's off the format has it 

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:59.439

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:53.349
 Jakarta AZ 

00:03:54.939 --> 00:03:57.939
 Prammer serve red numbers 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:09.799
 whether EADS listed a-tec 

00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:15.789
 but it will be here 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:23.079
 This will buy again 

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:29.810
 yes that's right in any case cared for I always have this but no way 

00:04:29.809 --> 00:04:31.059
 to get free 

00:04:31.059 --> 00:04:34.059
 David Empire of the middle 

00:04:35.319 --> 00:04:37.050
 what percent 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.309
 before ostracism or 95 

00:04:39.309 --> 00:04:42.539
 he needs a point 

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:45.379
 Bremen one point Return of Norris one point 

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:48.099
 continue 

00:04:48.099 --> 00:04:53.329
 2 031 in a nutshell Jack Jack is Back she must believe today 

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:57.469
 and the places because only then comes 

00:04:59.219 --> 00:05:00.589
 and yes, really 

00:05:00.589 --> 00:05:03.589
 the boss of both the MACD stands 

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:07.789
 Photo to be Kalisk 

00:05:08.439 --> 00:05:11.439
 the market participants 

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:15.439
 now searched 

00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:17.039
 yes that was true 

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:18.370
 Reason for panic 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:20.659
 the vehicle from 1 

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:22.569
 that's how Mathieu can be 

00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:25.569
 Who on Hip Hop the cities would feel wrong 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:29.050
 the students found or as 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:30.639
 in short clarifies Abstauber 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:32.830
 besides problems 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:35.089
 as App Store okay TA 

00:05:35.089 --> 00:05:38.759
 that also avoids building materials the post percent if you really on the VP 

00:05:38.759 --> 00:05:41.409
 im im necessarily he must not you percent 

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:45.610
 Percent and Peter play this role-playing game 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:48.619
 Of course there are only once a year and then no longer threatened 

00:05:48.619 --> 00:05:52.169
 Part and that is really a very good ambience to make Chur renewed
