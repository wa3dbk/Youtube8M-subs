of<00:01:51.409> the<00:01:51.619> blade<00:01:51.799> especially<00:01:52.399> in<00:01:52.520> the<00:01:52.840> area<00:01:53.840> of

00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:54.219 
of the blade especially in the area of

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:56.889 
of the blade especially in the area of
reactive<00:01:55.219> steel<00:01:55.520> and<00:01:55.789> then<00:01:56.209> lacquer

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:56.899 
reactive steel and then lacquer

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:58.749 
reactive steel and then lacquer
sometimes<00:01:57.409> gets<00:01:57.679> down<00:01:57.920> on<00:01:58.100> the<00:01:58.219> actual<00:01:58.549> edge

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759 
sometimes gets down on the actual edge

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:00.309 
sometimes gets down on the actual edge
so<00:01:59.060> even<00:01:59.240> though<00:01:59.329> the<00:01:59.450> edges<00:01:59.749> aren't<00:01:59.929> too<00:02:00.139> bad

00:02:00.309 --> 00:02:00.319 
so even though the edges aren't too bad

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:02.889 
so even though the edges aren't too bad
out<00:02:00.889> of<00:02:01.069> the<00:02:01.130> box<00:02:01.340> that<00:02:01.549> can<00:02:01.729> be<00:02:01.789> not<00:02:02.689> very

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:02.899 
out of the box that can be not very

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:05.859 
out of the box that can be not very
sharp<00:02:03.200> because<00:02:03.560> of<00:02:03.679> that<00:02:03.770> lacquer<00:02:04.639> so<00:02:05.090> you

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
sharp because of that lacquer so you

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:08.109 
sharp because of that lacquer so you
need<00:02:06.289> to<00:02:06.380> hit<00:02:06.499> these<00:02:06.679> with<00:02:06.979> a<00:02:07.119> sharpening

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
need to hit these with a sharpening

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.240 
need to hit these with a sharpening
stone<00:02:08.420> or<00:02:08.600> two<00:02:08.810> right<00:02:09.500> out<00:02:09.619> of<00:02:09.649> the<00:02:09.800> box<00:02:09.950> in<00:02:10.220> my

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
stone or two right out of the box in my

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.070 
stone or two right out of the box in my
opinion<00:02:10.789> to<00:02:10.940> get<00:02:11.030> that<00:02:11.240> lacquer<00:02:11.510> off<00:02:11.810> the<00:02:11.959> edge

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
opinion to get that lacquer off the edge

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.530 
opinion to get that lacquer off the edge
so<00:02:12.290> you<00:02:12.319> can<00:02:12.560> experience<00:02:13.010> the<00:02:13.280> true<00:02:13.610> sharpness

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
so you can experience the true sharpness

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:15.890 
so you can experience the true sharpness
that<00:02:14.569> lies

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
that lies

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.589 
that lies
thin<00:02:16.110> and<00:02:16.670> if<00:02:17.670> you<00:02:17.849> don't<00:02:18.030> sharpen<00:02:18.269> maybe

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
thin and if you don't sharpen maybe

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:20.000 
thin and if you don't sharpen maybe
order<00:02:18.900> they're<00:02:19.019> sharpening<00:02:19.409> service<00:02:19.769> so<00:02:19.980> you

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
order they're sharpening service so you

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.940 
order they're sharpening service so you
can<00:02:20.280> get<00:02:20.400> these<00:02:20.549> sharp<00:02:20.819> out<00:02:21.000> of<00:02:21.120> the<00:02:21.180> box

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
can get these sharp out of the box

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.130 
can get these sharp out of the box
let's<00:02:22.950> take<00:02:23.159> a<00:02:23.189> look<00:02:23.400> at<00:02:23.610> the<00:02:23.879> closeup<00:02:24.840> of<00:02:24.870> the

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
let's take a look at the closeup of the

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.929 
let's take a look at the closeup of the
knife<00:02:25.319> I've<00:02:25.829> been<00:02:26.099> using<00:02:26.310> this<00:02:26.519> particularly

00:02:26.929 --> 00:02:26.939 
knife I've been using this particularly

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:29.149 
knife I've been using this particularly
one<00:02:27.209> to<00:02:27.360> get<00:02:27.480> a<00:02:27.510> feel<00:02:27.870> for<00:02:28.200> this<00:02:28.860> line<00:02:29.129> of

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:29.159 
one to get a feel for this line of

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:30.619 
one to get a feel for this line of
knives<00:02:29.489> so<00:02:29.790> you'll<00:02:29.939> see<00:02:30.090> a<00:02:30.120> little<00:02:30.299> bit<00:02:30.540> of

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:30.629 
knives so you'll see a little bit of

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:32.899 
knives so you'll see a little bit of
patina<00:02:31.069> starting<00:02:32.069> a<00:02:32.129> little<00:02:32.280> bit<00:02:32.519> on<00:02:32.640> the<00:02:32.760> edge

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:32.909 
patina starting a little bit on the edge

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:34.520 
patina starting a little bit on the edge
with<00:02:33.150> a<00:02:33.209> lacquer<00:02:33.420> starting<00:02:33.810> to<00:02:33.900> wear<00:02:34.049> off<00:02:34.230> and

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
with a lacquer starting to wear off and

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.130 
with a lacquer starting to wear off and
then<00:02:35.069> also<00:02:35.250> actually<00:02:35.760> on<00:02:35.849> the<00:02:36.319> cladding<00:02:37.459> and

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
then also actually on the cladding and

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.009 
then also actually on the cladding and
again<00:02:40.140> these<00:02:40.290> are<00:02:40.349> really<00:02:40.730> well<00:02:41.730> ground<00:02:42.180> the

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
again these are really well ground the

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:44.210 
again these are really well ground the
performance<00:02:43.560> and<00:02:43.709> this<00:02:43.829> knife<00:02:44.010> is

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
performance and this knife is

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.130 
performance and this knife is
outstanding<00:02:44.909> it's<00:02:45.060> got<00:02:45.180> a<00:02:45.209> great<00:02:45.480> balance<00:02:45.959> of

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
outstanding it's got a great balance of

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.860 
outstanding it's got a great balance of
a<00:02:46.200> thin<00:02:46.470> tip<00:02:46.709> that<00:02:47.250> flies<00:02:47.879> through<00:02:48.209> onions<00:02:48.599> for

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
a thin tip that flies through onions for

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.050 
a thin tip that flies through onions for
example<00:02:49.290> and<00:02:49.440> soft<00:02:49.680> ingredients<00:02:50.250> as<00:02:50.400> well<00:02:50.790> as

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
example and soft ingredients as well as

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.379 
example and soft ingredients as well as
a<00:02:51.269> thin<00:02:51.510> enough<00:02:51.810> behind<00:02:52.709> the<00:02:52.799> edge<00:02:53.060> style<00:02:54.060> to

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:54.389 
a thin enough behind the edge style to

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:56.270 
a thin enough behind the edge style to
it<00:02:54.569> that<00:02:54.780> it<00:02:54.930> doesn't<00:02:55.230> wedge<00:02:55.409> much<00:02:55.680> at<00:02:55.859> all<00:02:56.010> in

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
it that it doesn't wedge much at all in

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.399 
it that it doesn't wedge much at all in
ingredients<00:02:57.180> so<00:02:57.359> it's<00:02:57.629> it's<00:02:57.930> a<00:02:57.989> pretty<00:02:58.139> good

00:02:58.399 --> 00:02:58.409 
ingredients so it's it's a pretty good

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:00.110 
ingredients so it's it's a pretty good
compromise<00:02:58.709> of<00:02:59.129> balance<00:02:59.459> of<00:02:59.609> features<00:02:59.940> so

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
compromise of balance of features so

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.690 
compromise of balance of features so
overall<00:03:00.480> again<00:03:00.689> this<00:03:00.810> is<00:03:00.989> a<00:03:01.019> fairly<00:03:01.650> thin<00:03:02.069> high

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
overall again this is a fairly thin high

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.129 
overall again this is a fairly thin high
performance<00:03:03.389> style

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:04.139 
performance style

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:07.069 
performance style
kayuu<00:03:04.620> style<00:03:04.950> blade<00:03:05.220> the<00:03:06.030> balance<00:03:06.629> point<00:03:06.900> on

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:07.079 
kayuu style blade the balance point on

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:09.679 
kayuu style blade the balance point on
this<00:03:07.290> is<00:03:07.530> just<00:03:08.010> a<00:03:08.849> little<00:03:09.000> bit<00:03:09.239> behind<00:03:09.420> the

00:03:09.679 --> 00:03:09.689 
this is just a little bit behind the

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:11.449 
this is just a little bit behind the
pinch<00:03:09.959> grip<00:03:10.200> these<00:03:10.620> handles<00:03:11.099> aren't<00:03:11.310> the

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
pinch grip these handles aren't the

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:12.949 
pinch grip these handles aren't the
world's<00:03:11.700> lightest<00:03:12.120> handle<00:03:12.480> so<00:03:12.750> that

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
world's lightest handle so that

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:14.720 
world's lightest handle so that
contributes<00:03:13.829> a<00:03:13.889> little<00:03:13.980> bit<00:03:14.129> to<00:03:14.220> that<00:03:14.489> but

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
contributes a little bit to that but

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.610 
contributes a little bit to that but
it's<00:03:14.849> right<00:03:15.030> about<00:03:15.299> there<00:03:15.569> and<00:03:15.750> my<00:03:16.200> pinch<00:03:16.439> grip

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
it's right about there and my pinch grip

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.020 
it's right about there and my pinch grip
it's<00:03:16.769> just<00:03:16.980> a<00:03:17.099> touch<00:03:17.310> in<00:03:17.459> front<00:03:17.700> of<00:03:17.760> that<00:03:17.879> but

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
it's just a touch in front of that but

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.879 
it's just a touch in front of that but
it<00:03:18.120> has<00:03:18.239> a<00:03:18.269> nimble<00:03:18.720> feel<00:03:18.959> despite<00:03:19.470> the<00:03:19.650> size

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:19.889 
it has a nimble feel despite the size

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:24.319 
it has a nimble feel despite the size
and<00:03:20.329> height<00:03:21.329> of<00:03:21.540> the<00:03:21.629> blade<00:03:22.190> the<00:03:23.190> profile<00:03:23.970> I

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:24.329 
and height of the blade the profile I

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:26.300 
and height of the blade the profile I
should<00:03:24.540> say<00:03:24.690> the<00:03:24.870> soil<00:03:25.590> shot<00:03:25.919> these<00:03:26.190> are

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
should say the soil shot these are

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.979 
should say the soil shot these are
pretty<00:03:26.549> thin<00:03:27.230> behind<00:03:28.230> the<00:03:28.319> edge<00:03:28.440> like<00:03:28.739> I<00:03:28.889> said

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:29.989 
pretty thin behind the edge like I said

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:35.869 
pretty thin behind the edge like I said
let's<00:03:30.989> take<00:03:31.260> a<00:03:31.319> look<00:03:31.590> at<00:03:34.400> what<00:03:35.400> it<00:03:35.489> looks<00:03:35.669> like

00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:35.879 
let's take a look at what it looks like

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:39.490 
let's take a look at what it looks like
on<00:03:36.090> a<00:03:36.120> cutting<00:03:36.419> board<00:03:36.540> so<00:03:37.109> here's<00:03:37.319> the<00:03:37.470> profile

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
on a cutting board so here's the profile

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.409 
on a cutting board so here's the profile
and<00:03:40.500> your<00:03:40.709> focus<00:03:40.949> here<00:03:41.340> so<00:03:42.090> here's<00:03:42.299> your

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:42.419

00:03:43.899 --> 00:03:43.909 
profile and this actually has a

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:47.390 
profile and this actually has a
reasonable<00:03:44.909> flat<00:03:45.569> enough<00:03:45.840> heel<00:03:46.409> area<00:03:46.799> with

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
reasonable flat enough heel area with

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.490 
reasonable flat enough heel area with
just<00:03:47.430> a<00:03:47.699> touch<00:03:47.909> of<00:03:47.940> back<00:03:48.299> bevel<00:03:48.750> or<00:03:48.870> back<00:03:49.229> belly

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
just a touch of back bevel or back belly

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.949 
just a touch of back bevel or back belly
that<00:03:50.220> it<00:03:50.760> works<00:03:50.940> pretty<00:03:51.150> well<00:03:51.299> even<00:03:51.840> on

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
that it works pretty well even on

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:54.110 
that it works pretty well even on
chopping<00:03:52.470> type<00:03:53.190> stuff<00:03:53.489> although<00:03:53.849> it<00:03:53.970> does

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
chopping type stuff although it does

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.390 
chopping type stuff although it does
have<00:03:54.150> some<00:03:54.569> belly<00:03:54.750> to<00:03:55.049> it<00:03:55.199> so<00:03:55.769> let's<00:03:56.159> take<00:03:56.370> a

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
have some belly to it so let's take a

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.119 
have some belly to it so let's take a
look<00:03:56.669> here<00:03:57.199> so<00:03:58.199> you<00:03:58.260> do<00:03:58.440> have<00:03:58.470> a<00:03:58.590> little<00:03:58.769> bit<00:03:58.919> of

00:03:59.119 --> 00:03:59.129 
look here so you do have a little bit of

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:01.729 
look here so you do have a little bit of
a<00:03:59.190> flat<00:03:59.400> area<00:03:59.699> towards<00:04:00.000> the<00:04:00.180> back<00:04:00.449> I<00:04:00.780> didn't

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
a flat area towards the back I didn't

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:02.719 
a flat area towards the back I didn't
hear<00:04:01.799> really<00:04:02.040> have<00:04:02.159> much<00:04:02.340> problem<00:04:02.699> with

00:04:02.719 --> 00:04:02.729 
hear really have much problem with

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:04.869 
hear really have much problem with
accordion<00:04:03.599> cuts<00:04:03.840> on<00:04:04.019> this<00:04:04.229> knife<00:04:04.440> and

00:04:04.869 --> 00:04:04.879 
accordion cuts on this knife and

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:07.729 
accordion cuts on this knife and
sometimes<00:04:05.879> I<00:04:06.030> do<00:04:06.139> so<00:04:07.139> you'll<00:04:07.319> see<00:04:07.470> you've<00:04:07.620> got

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739 
sometimes I do so you'll see you've got

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:09.379 
sometimes I do so you'll see you've got
a<00:04:07.769> fair<00:04:08.129> amount<00:04:08.220> of<00:04:08.400> belly<00:04:08.639> towards<00:04:09.030> the<00:04:09.150> tip

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:09.389 
a fair amount of belly towards the tip

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:11.960 
a fair amount of belly towards the tip
on<00:04:09.599> this<00:04:09.919> so<00:04:10.919> I<00:04:11.010> can<00:04:11.129> get<00:04:11.250> really<00:04:11.489> high<00:04:11.760> with

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
on this so I can get really high with

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.539 
on this so I can get really high with
this<00:04:12.120> particular<00:04:12.449> knife<00:04:12.900> but<00:04:13.680> it<00:04:13.859> rolls<00:04:14.129> into

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549 
this particular knife but it rolls into

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:16.099 
this particular knife but it rolls into
a<00:04:14.669> gentle<00:04:15.180> curve<00:04:15.359> it<00:04:15.510> doesn't<00:04:15.750> have<00:04:15.840> a<00:04:15.900> long

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
a gentle curve it doesn't have a long

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:19.520 
a gentle curve it doesn't have a long
flat<00:04:16.470> spot<00:04:16.769> so<00:04:17.430> it's<00:04:17.609> not<00:04:17.760> a<00:04:17.789> true<00:04:18.150> chopper<00:04:18.840> but

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
flat spot so it's not a true chopper but

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.899 
flat spot so it's not a true chopper but
pretty<00:04:20.250> versatile<00:04:20.669> profile<00:04:22.340> you<00:04:23.340> can<00:04:23.520> see<00:04:23.729> the

00:04:23.899 --> 00:04:23.909 
pretty versatile profile you can see the

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:27.050 
pretty versatile profile you can see the
spine<00:04:24.840> definitely<00:04:25.320> comes<00:04:25.469> down<00:04:25.800> the<00:04:26.010> meat<00:04:26.219> the

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
spine definitely comes down the meat the

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.029 
spine definitely comes down the meat the
edge<00:04:27.240> versus<00:04:27.930> the<00:04:28.050> edge<00:04:28.139> coming<00:04:28.440> way<00:04:28.710> up<00:04:28.740> to

00:04:29.029 --> 00:04:29.039 
edge versus the edge coming way up to

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:29.730 
edge versus the edge coming way up to
meet<00:04:29.190> the<00:04:29.310> spa

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
meet the spa

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:34.980 
meet the spa
it's<00:04:30.280> that<00:04:30.520> shape<00:04:30.880> of<00:04:31.090> blade<00:04:33.120> so<00:04:34.120> you<00:04:34.150> can<00:04:34.660> like

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990 
it's that shape of blade so you can like

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:36.420 
it's that shape of blade so you can like
I<00:04:35.080> said<00:04:35.110> you<00:04:35.380> can<00:04:35.470> get<00:04:35.530> fairly<00:04:35.890> high<00:04:36.070> on<00:04:36.100> the

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:41.260 
to the height actually didn't bother me

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.410
