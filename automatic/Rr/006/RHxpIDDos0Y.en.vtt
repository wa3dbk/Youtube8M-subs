00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:03.200
 Nikon 35mm f / 1.8G - Review in English 

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:06.740
 Hello guys! Welcome to one more video from Blood Sweat and Photo. 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.320
 And today's long-awaited video about the Nikon 35mm f / 1.8 DX. Beauty? 

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.000
 And how did I split this video? 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.980
 First I'm going to talk about who's got the DX body, okay? 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:21.960
 Because that would be a good choice. 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.960
 In the second part of the video I will talk to those who have a Full Frame. 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.500
 Because that still, despite being a DX lens, is an interesting lens. 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:36.120
 In the third part of the video I will make some considerations about the lens in particular. OK? 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.580
 And in the fourth part ... I said it was three, right? 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:39.580
 Yeah, it's four parts! 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:45.940
 In the fourth part I will show some images and make some considerations about them. Beauty? 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:47.100
 So let's go! 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.420
 Why is it a good lens for anyone who has a DX body? 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.880
 Because a 35mm in a camera with cropado sensor, ... 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 it will turn into more or less what would be a 50mm. 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:06.380
 And for those who do not know why 50mm is one of the best ranges to work with, ... 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.380
 watch the video I made of the review of Nikon 50mm f / 1.8. 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.160
 Because in the first part of the video I talk a lot and I explain this idea a lot. 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.840
 Which is basically that, it will not even distort the person, for example as a ... 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.540
 telephoto that would make the person very thin and will not even leave the super big person with big nose. 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.380
 In case if you have a wide angle for example. 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:36.140
 It's the perfect range to take pictures without distortion in general. 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.520
 Which is what most imitates our vision, what our eyes see. 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.960
 Anyway, a 50mm ... 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.160
 It's super interesting. Watch the video, I talk a lot about it there. 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.000
 And now for those who own a Full Frame camera. Why is it cool? 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.060
 Because, despite being a DX lens .... 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.340
 What happens? We'll have a little bit of dark vignette. 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.940
 But in some cases it is even desirable. It has a legal effect. 

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:11.160
 It's not at all undesirable, it's not a problem at all. 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:17.140
 I myself often use this 35mm lens on my D600, which is Full Frame. 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.660
 And most of the images can not even see that there is a sticker there. 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.920
 Even if you click on those links I'm leaving, ... 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:33.240
 were video lessons that I did here including I used Full Frame and 35mm. 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.080
 And then you'll see what the sticker looks like there. 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.080
 And, if that's the case, you can use it. 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.560
 Why do I like to use 35mm in Full Frame? 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.620
 Because from there it really becomes a 35mm, has a greater angle of vision ... 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:53.820
 which is very good for taking photos on the street or internal photos, for example, that has little space ... 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.200
 and that maybe 50mm is a bit too short. 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:04.700
 I use this lens, despite being DX, in my Full Frame and I like it a lot. 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.280
 I believe that ...... 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.520
 Well, anyway, watch the videos where I put the links. Just click here ... 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.200
 that you will have a better idea of ​​what I'm talking about. OK? 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.620
 And now I'm going to make some considerations about the lens in particular. 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.560
 I will not talk much about, for example, that it has manual and automatic mode, ... 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:27.180
 that he can manually control the focus here and such ... 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.360
 because I think this is a little rain in the wet. 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.700
 All you have to do is look at a picture of her that will connect you with these things. 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.340
 So what considerations do I have to make especially about it? 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:41.660
 It is a fixed lens, so it has few internal elements ... 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.480
 and you have a much sharper image, it is much faster to focus. 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.240
 Precisely because of this, it has few internal elements. 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.040
 It's a clear lens, it's f / 1.8. 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:57.880
 It is ideal for indoor environments, for taking pictures taking advantage of natural lighting. 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.820
 It's cool to blur, for those people who like to work the bokeh of images, for example. 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:08.100
 I have how to focus here from my first finger and that finger here in the background will get blurred. 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.700
 Because it's f / 1.8, it's a pretty big gap. Right? 

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:15.140
 As I said, it's a quick lens to focus on. 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:17.240
 Especially for those who work with events for example ... 

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:20.280
 that you can not stand there thinking, waiting for the machine to calculate. 

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:26.360
 Gee, the guy's going to put alliance there on the bride's finger, for example, ... No! have to aim and TUM! Right? 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:28.420
 What else? 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:32.800
 Well, let's go to the fourth part of the video where I'm going to show some pictures. 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.440
 First some pictures showing the bokeh. 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:40.160
 Then some flowers you can see how you can blur the background there. 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.500
 This third image too. 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:47.180
 Good to take pictures of wedding details mostly, right? 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.580
 That gives the playful air the images. 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:53.860
 And speaking of wedding photos, it is also good to take advantage of natural lighting. 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.460
 Here are some photos I made the night. 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:00.320
 There a nice photo too, showing some windows to see how we ... 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.680
 you get good illumination even without flash. 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:10.360
 Then again showing the bokeh. But moving on, ... 

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:15.440
 a photo on the street right? How interesting is the angle of view of it. 

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:19.460
 And here are some photos I chose to show the colors. 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.020
 Look how interesting, look how colorful it gets. 

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:29.060
 These images I used ... I did not even edit them in any post processing. 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:34.500
 As I photographed in RAW, then of course I had to give a little stir. But it was the least possible. 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:40.960
 I basically adjusted contrast. I did not move in sharpness, saturation, and none of that. 

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:43.260
 And look how beautiful the image is. 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:44.760
 Look at the sharpness. 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.740
 Everything is super clear and very colorful. 

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:52.380
 Look how beautiful the colors that this lens gives us. 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:56.800
 Here some pictures of portraits, to show what I had talked about. 

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:03.660
 That it does not deform people, it leaves in the closest thing to our vision, okay? 

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:06.720
 Well, that's it folks! I hope I have helped you. 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.960
