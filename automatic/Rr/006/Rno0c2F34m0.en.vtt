than once we did the warm-up set again
same<00:03:53.930> idea<00:03:55.060> on<00:03:56.060> the<00:03:56.210> advice

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:13.099 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:16.340 

my<00:04:14.099> guess<00:04:14.340> time<00:04:14.670> for<00:04:15.000> a<00:04:15.030> have<00:04:15.239> your<00:04:15.420> sense<00:04:15.720> this

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
my guess time for a have your sense this

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.439 
my guess time for a have your sense this
time<00:04:16.410> we're<00:04:16.709> going<00:04:16.799> to<00:04:16.859> go<00:04:16.949> 60<00:04:17.370> aircrafts<00:04:17.850> are

00:04:18.439 --> 00:04:18.449 
time we're going to go 60 aircrafts are

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:21.920 
time we're going to go 60 aircrafts are
pretty<00:04:18.780> heavy<00:04:19.109> with<00:04:19.410> so<00:04:20.310> same<00:04:20.699> idea<00:04:21.090> again<00:04:21.209> get

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
pretty heavy with so same idea again get

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.950 
pretty heavy with so same idea again get

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:18.810 
are the muscles to recap capital logic

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:20.600 
are the muscles to recap capital logic
also<00:05:19.560> better<00:05:19.740> than<00:05:19.830> before<00:05:20.039> they<00:05:20.370> hit<00:05:20.490> the
