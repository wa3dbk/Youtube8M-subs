 Hello everyone, Hermes again today 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.820
 I present you a new thin which I 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:27.369
 decided to name 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:30.160
 Legend I do not know why I just decided 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:33.720
 In general, in the archive you will have two versions 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:38.530
 bad 1 with legend and the second without 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:41.670
 it already tastes and color as they say not 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:44.080
 decide whom to choose 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.230
 let's see what is present in 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:51.550
 This Hoodie Namely Author Icons 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:54.309
 beautiful strip hp nice font well and 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:58.840
 basically everything is fine 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:01:03.070
 I removed such armor but left digital 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:04.630
 the armor counter I think it's useful there 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.259
 and let's still see how he 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:07.259
 looks like 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:33.250
 so now I will show you how 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:36.489
 unpack my ude because they 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:40.599
 there will be only one file unpacker 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:43.180
 there's nothing wrong with that 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:44.920
 afraid of raw style is not there but if you are not 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:49.160

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:56.290

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.790
 start you have a window immediately 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:04.400
 with the choice of language here I indicated only three 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.770
 tongue no longer need to think worms 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.680
