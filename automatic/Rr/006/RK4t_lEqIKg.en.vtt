00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.749
 good guys welcome to a new 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.430
 gt5 video online and we are here whose 

00:00:03.749 --> 00:00:07.290
 episode of the series is from school of 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.790
 Sana'a flight and a boy for trial as 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.320
 you know previously I made the first 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.849
 episode that was about making a curl 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.830
 outside that the truth that cost me what 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.970
 his saying it clear good in this 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.800
 second episode I bring you a new 

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.449
 episode which is going to try to fail 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.010
 of the engine is titled this our new 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.180
 lesson to say it some way and 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.160
 Well, the information you give us is 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.359
 that we have to land the thousand jet that 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.369
 it's the new plane that has got into this 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.199
 last dlc with a failure in the engines 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.789
 I think it's going to be pretty easy a lot 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.019
 easier than the previous one really is 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.640
 the first one to try is more this 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.470
 This recording this episode after 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.480
 record the first so good because we will 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.890
 go there with this lesson to see if you 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.200
 it costs a little bit more, it costs me a lot 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.880
 to see ahead so let's give 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.200
 reed to see how we're going to see what 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.090
 Man says this stage does not dominate 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.399
 these favorites because in it we lose 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.320
 many recruits are worth the pilots of the 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.879
 Air forces should know what to do 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.160
 Whether things are going well or if they are going 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.510
 wrong so get on the plane and overcome 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.510
 any difficulty that arises 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:02.540
 ok perfect has been an information 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:04.460
 short let's go there come and see how it is 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:07.610
 we will land our super 1010 goes 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.590
 of 321 we go there look like the gala 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.760
 first of two first guys worth 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.780
 good boy distanced 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.160
 there are two kilometers left and more to turn it off 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.470
 engines and when we promise enough 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.360
 high so it's supposed to be 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.640
 easy to go towards military sight and 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.040
 try to gently extend two no longer 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.390
 I know how the fuck he wants me to feel with 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.190
 softness like I have engines but webb 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.870
 land on the track trying 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:33.820
 stop at the end of the same vale 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:35.290
 let's see we're taking the wheel, not because 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.150
 I think neither take the wheels slower 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:39.310
 so better so I take it out already 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:44.410
 alignment imagine I have a plane of 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:45.400
 is without gas basically to see in 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:46.810
 what clues on the right of the left 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.350
 uncle to not worth they are entities 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.730
 Medieval I'm personally silly 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.500
 to have 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:58.150
 it was softly worth while there is the point of 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:59.650
 control the fund is worth a little bit to 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.380
 little bit 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:04.030
 ok my mother model castrista here I the 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.100
 yes it is that it seems that the votes 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.200
 days look look I'm going to end up in the middle 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.310
 of the goal gave master look at the eels and 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.890
 the firefighters since I what good 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:15.250
 You are watching 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.900
 Look, look, my mother, my boy. 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.000
 say that now it happened to me takes away 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:22.830
 Uncle points if you do not stop before 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.450
 uncle good then 58 meters 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:28.860
 I would not call a landing 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:31.860
 have come closer to the goal of a 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:34.890
 gold star uncle I will not repeat what 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.180
 it's really another to repeat I could 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.740
 see being in the middle of the goal has 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.720
 to get there and forward I think it has 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.700
 to be behind the goal not in 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.010
 the middle so come on let's 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.150
 dismiss him to see if this charges because 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.590
 you know that the rockstar cloud always 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.040
 goes at your pace 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.319
 come rock band is you can see 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:54.799
 we go 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:57.260
 to see what comes out why to pursue 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:59.030
 parachute jump 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.079
 this one has to be very handsome uncle but 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.120
 well let's go with this let's go with the 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:03.409
 second episode already because last morning 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.090
 tomorrow the third episode will go up when 

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:06.290
 come, we have to get the medal 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.209
 of gold in all vices and I the 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.340
 true that would be a good challenge so 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:11.989
 come see if we get it we go there 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.310
 it's worth seeing down already because 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:14.480
 we are really very very close though 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.709
 perfect even if we seem to be 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.550
 far we're really quite 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:20.680
 effective so come 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:22.000
 there was an error I would not see that 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.840
 towards the military coast and tries to 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.840
 descend gently 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:27.520
 and this very beautiful view in that path and 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.170
 the background look there the city of the 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.910
 saints it seems that making it holy is 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.440
 as a crack throws me the no if you look 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.200
 This angle is stuck to and 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.460
 between montana 23 truth seems to be a 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.320
 character shot city so good 

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:40.000
 the case we are here on the second floor 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.260
 of this fair so let's stop 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.270
 talk about volcanoes and tartlets losantos 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.520
 to see come to this one if I get 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:47.050
 gold medal because he calls me dan didio 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:48.780
 OK 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:53.700
 OK 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:54.780
 ok, be careful, ok, the 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.709
 ambulances the fire engine by 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.170
 there ok 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:59.819
 perfect, I'm going to slow down a bit 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:05.780
 little bit 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:05.780
 I'm going calm 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.550

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:22.700
 attentions of stars of the pÃ©rez 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.720
 this we go there pilot but not for that 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.760
 I fell better 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.080
 this is the critical sergeant that although 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.990
 do it right, it will always be giving you 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:32.060
 by sac to see good distance 3 as 24 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:33.950
 meters and the truth and you have a boy

 with gold medal works that are not 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.090
 nothing bad, yes, because they give me less money 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:40.160
