the end of the 19th century after a

couple of big banking crises how can

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.080 
couple of big banking crises how can
investors<00:00:40.200> best<00:00:40.500> prepare<00:00:40.920> for<00:00:40.950> that<00:00:41.250> in<00:00:42.030> the

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
investors best prepare for that in the

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.090 
investors best prepare for that in the
Great<00:00:42.390> reflation<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.260> big<00:00:43.469> lesson<00:00:43.890> is<00:00:44.040> that

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
Great reflation the big lesson is that

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.720 
Great reflation the big lesson is that
returns<00:00:44.760> will<00:00:45.090> be<00:00:45.270> very<00:00:45.510> low<00:00:45.780> for<00:00:46.050> bars<00:00:46.730> real

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
returns will be very low for bars real

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.000 
returns will be very low for bars real
returns<00:00:48.120> will<00:00:48.360> be<00:00:48.510> adjacent<00:00:48.899> to<00:00:49.260> zero<00:00:49.530> perhaps

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
returns will be adjacent to zero perhaps

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.799 
returns will be adjacent to zero perhaps
a<00:00:50.100> bit<00:00:50.219> below<00:00:50.550> perhaps<00:00:50.820> a<00:00:50.969> bit<00:00:51.120> above<00:00:51.420> the

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
a bit below perhaps a bit above the

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.049 
a bit below perhaps a bit above the
question<00:00:52.199> is<00:00:52.460> what's<00:00:53.460> going<00:00:53.579> to<00:00:53.640> happen<00:00:53.730> with

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
question is what's going to happen with

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.569 
question is what's going to happen with
equities<00:00:54.600> first<00:00:55.379> point<00:00:55.710> is<00:00:55.920> that<00:00:56.219> equity

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
equities first point is that equity

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.170 
equities first point is that equity
returns<00:00:56.879> will<00:00:57.120> be<00:00:57.270> higher<00:00:58.640> the<00:00:59.640> second<00:01:00.030> point

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
returns will be higher the second point

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.660 
returns will be higher the second point
is<00:01:00.449> that<00:01:01.079> we<00:01:01.199> don't<00:01:01.320> know<00:01:01.559> yet<00:01:01.800> just<00:01:02.250> how<00:01:02.489> much

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
is that we don't know yet just how much

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.240 
is that we don't know yet just how much
higher<00:01:02.969> but<00:01:03.840> in<00:01:04.080> that<00:01:04.110> period<00:01:04.650> that<00:01:04.890> I<00:01:05.010> was

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
higher but in that period that I was

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.969 
higher but in that period that I was
referring<00:01:05.580> to<00:01:05.790> then<00:01:06.540> there<00:01:07.229> was<00:01:07.409> a<00:01:07.439> period<00:01:07.770> in

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
referring to then there was a period in

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.880 
referring to then there was a period in
which<00:01:08.570> real<00:01:09.570> equity<00:01:09.720> returns<00:01:10.260> in<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.470> United

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
which real equity returns in the United

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.750 
which real equity returns in the United
States<00:01:11.060> were<00:01:13.100> considerably<00:01:14.100> about<00:01:14.460> their

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
States were considerably about their

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.090 
States were considerably about their
long-term<00:01:15.090> trend<00:01:15.479> of<00:01:15.689> six<00:01:16.200> percent<00:01:16.619> per<00:01:16.799> annum

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
long-term trend of six percent per annum

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.870 
long-term trend of six percent per annum
greater<00:01:17.880> than<00:01:18.180> inflation<00:01:18.650> so<00:01:19.650> to<00:01:20.189> talk<00:01:20.700> about

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
greater than inflation so to talk about

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.929 
greater than inflation so to talk about
six<00:01:21.689> seven<00:01:22.170> eight<00:01:22.350> percent<00:01:23.159> real<00:01:23.430> returns<00:01:23.790> is

six seven eight percent real returns is

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.370 
six seven eight percent real returns is
not<00:01:24.180> impossible<00:01:25.080> even<00:01:25.890> with<00:01:26.400> a<00:01:26.970> very<00:01:27.570> low<00:01:27.840> real

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
not impossible even with a very low real

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.890 
not impossible even with a very low real
Bonnie<00:01:28.619> intent<00:01:28.979> indeed<00:01:29.640> it<00:01:30.119> will<00:01:30.450> require

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
Bonnie intent indeed it will require

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.140 
Bonnie intent indeed it will require
bond<00:01:31.380> yields<00:01:31.680> to<00:01:31.829> stay<00:01:32.040> late<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.640> get<00:01:32.790> such

bond yields to stay late to get such

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.450 
bond yields to stay late to get such
returns<00:01:33.600> from<00:01:33.810> other<00:01:34.079> equities<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:35.100> problem

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
returns from other equities the problem

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.010 
returns from other equities the problem
for<00:01:35.490> investors<00:01:36.090> is<00:01:36.240> that<00:01:36.479> they<00:01:36.659> are<00:01:36.810> now

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
for investors is that they are now

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.679 
for investors is that they are now
overweight<00:01:37.740> a<00:01:37.799> fixed<00:01:38.250> income<00:01:38.400> so<00:01:39.270> they've<00:01:39.479> got

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
overweight a fixed income so they've got

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.690 
overweight a fixed income so they've got
a<00:01:39.720> bat<00:01:40.049> they're<00:01:40.320> already<00:01:40.740> starting<00:01:40.950> from

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
a bat they're already starting from

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.109 
a bat they're already starting from
behind<00:01:42.000> so<00:01:42.570> clearly<00:01:43.250> greater<00:01:44.250> allocation<00:01:45.000> to

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
behind so clearly greater allocation to

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.780 
behind so clearly greater allocation to
equities<00:01:45.649> but<00:01:46.649> it's<00:01:46.770> going<00:01:46.920> to<00:01:47.009> be<00:01:47.130> a<00:01:47.159> volatile

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
equities but it's going to be a volatile

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.469 
equities but it's going to be a volatile
period<00:01:48.720> and<00:01:49.079> lower<00:01:49.860> volatility<00:01:50.479> returns

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479

I've<00:02:14.320> designed<00:02:14.970> I've<00:02:15.970> designed<00:02:16.330> a<00:02:16.510> system<00:02:16.750> for

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
I've designed I've designed a system for

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.810 
I've designed I've designed a system for
doing<00:02:17.470> market<00:02:17.800> timing<00:02:18.010> using<00:02:18.430> our<00:02:18.580> risk

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
doing market timing using our risk

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.900 
doing market timing using our risk
appetite<00:02:19.650> measures<00:02:20.650> which<00:02:21.250> is<00:02:21.430> designed<00:02:21.790> to

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
appetite measures which is designed to

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.330 
appetite measures which is designed to
compensate<00:02:22.240> for<00:02:22.840> the<00:02:23.050> human<00:02:23.590> emotion<00:02:24.100> that

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
compensate for the human emotion that

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.720 
compensate for the human emotion that
goes<00:02:24.400> into<00:02:24.880> market<00:02:25.390> timing<00:02:25.630> of<00:02:25.840> decisions

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
goes into market timing of decisions

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.310 
goes into market timing of decisions
everybody<00:02:27.730> wants<00:02:28.209> to<00:02:28.330> buy<00:02:29.220> low<00:02:30.220> and<00:02:30.250> sell<00:02:30.610> high

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
everybody wants to buy low and sell high

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.440 
everybody wants to buy low and sell high
everybody<00:02:32.320> in<00:02:32.530> fact<00:02:32.830> tends<00:02:33.400> to<00:02:34.060> do<00:02:34.240> the

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
everybody in fact tends to do the

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.080 
everybody in fact tends to do the
opposite<00:02:34.890> if<00:02:35.890> you<00:02:36.190> program<00:02:36.520> something

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
opposite if you program something

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.320 
opposite if you program something
systemic<00:02:38.010> carefully<00:02:39.010> enough<00:02:39.250> you<00:02:39.330> can

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
systemic carefully enough you can

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:46.880 
systemic carefully enough you can
basically<00:02:41.280> force<00:02:42.280> people<00:02:43.500> by<00:02:44.500> the<00:02:45.040> systematic

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
basically force people by the systematic

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.640 
basically force people by the systematic
models<00:02:47.890> to<00:02:48.489> buy<00:02:49.180> when<00:02:49.480> dupler<00:02:49.900> in<00:02:50.050> panic<00:02:50.440> and

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
models to buy when dupler in panic and

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.500 
models to buy when dupler in panic and
to<00:02:50.800> sell<00:02:51.040> when<00:02:51.250> people<00:02:51.610> are<00:02:51.790> you<00:02:52.120> following

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
to sell when people are you following

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.199 
to sell when people are you following
and<00:02:52.890> although<00:02:53.890> there's<00:02:54.100> quite<00:02:54.430> a<00:02:54.459> lot<00:02:54.760> more<00:02:54.970> to

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
and although there's quite a lot more to

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:58.050 
and although there's quite a lot more to
it<00:02:55.360> than<00:02:55.570> that<00:02:55.709> what<00:02:56.709> we<00:02:56.860> basically<00:02:57.040> do<00:02:57.640> is<00:02:57.670> we

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
it than that what we basically do is we

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.600 
it than that what we basically do is we
use<00:02:58.420> a<00:02:58.660> systematic<00:02:59.500> approach<00:02:59.590> to<00:02:59.860> compensate

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
use a systematic approach to compensate

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.520 
use a systematic approach to compensate
for<00:03:00.850> human<00:03:01.180> emotion<00:03:01.810> the<00:03:02.020> biases<00:03:02.500> of

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
for human emotion the biases of

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.770 
for human emotion the biases of
overconfidence<00:03:03.160> of<00:03:03.670> herding<00:03:04.150> of<00:03:04.330> sort<00:03:04.720> of

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
overconfidence of herding of sort of

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.690 
overconfidence of herding of sort of
loss<00:03:04.989> aversion<00:03:05.380> that<00:03:06.130> behavioral

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
loss aversion that behavioral

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.580 
loss aversion that behavioral
psychologists<00:03:07.570> talk<00:03:07.720> about<00:03:07.989> so<00:03:08.260> we<00:03:08.410> have<00:03:08.560> a

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
psychologists talk about so we have a

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.800 
psychologists talk about so we have a
product<00:03:08.920> which<00:03:09.250> essentially<00:03:10.180> does<00:03:10.510> that

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
product which essentially does that

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.810 
product which essentially does that
which<00:03:11.200> is<00:03:11.230> between<00:03:11.680> bonds<00:03:11.920> and<00:03:12.100> equities<00:03:12.220> to

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
which is between bonds and equities to

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.910 
which is between bonds and equities to
do<00:03:12.940> that<00:03:13.120> so<00:03:13.810> your<00:03:13.989> robot<00:03:14.410> is<00:03:14.440> based<00:03:14.769> on

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
do that so your robot is based on

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.250 
do that so your robot is based on
behavioral<00:03:15.519> finance<00:03:15.780> essentially<00:03:16.780> and<00:03:17.019> it's

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
behavioral finance essentially and it's

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.229 
behavioral finance essentially and it's
also<00:03:17.440> for<00:03:18.160> that<00:03:18.310> matter<00:03:18.549> based<00:03:18.910> on<00:03:19.120> my

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
also for that matter based on my

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:21.120 
also for that matter based on my
experience<00:03:19.780> of<00:03:19.900> working<00:03:20.049> with<00:03:20.290> the<00:03:20.590> smartest

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
experience of working with the smartest

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.090 
experience of working with the smartest
investors<00:03:21.640> and<00:03:22.140> traders<00:03:23.140> in<00:03:23.440> the<00:03:23.709> world<00:03:23.920> for

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100 
investors and traders in the world for

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.880 
investors and traders in the world for
the<00:03:24.190> last<00:03:24.370> 35<00:03:24.760> years<00:03:24.970> I<00:03:25.450> noticed<00:03:25.930> that<00:03:26.049> they

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
the last 35 years I noticed that they

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.670 
the last 35 years I noticed that they
are<00:03:27.160> the<00:03:27.370> individuals<00:03:28.299> that<00:03:28.540> best<00:03:29.110> control

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
are the individuals that best control

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.160 
are the individuals that best control
their<00:03:30.400> emotions<00:03:30.549> during<00:03:31.239> times<00:03:31.600> of<00:03:31.810> stress

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
their emotions during times of stress

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.949 
their emotions during times of stress
and<00:03:32.650> I<00:03:32.890> try<00:03:33.100> to<00:03:33.130> design<00:03:33.549> that<00:03:33.790> into<00:03:34.060> the<00:03:34.150> one<00:03:34.299> so

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
and I try to design that into the one so

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:37.110 
and I try to design that into the one so
how<00:03:35.140> can<00:03:35.200> investors<00:03:35.709> best<00:03:36.010> time<00:03:36.310> risk<00:03:36.850> on

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
how can investors best time risk on

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.360 
how can investors best time risk on
versus<00:03:37.630> risk-off<00:03:38.049> investment<00:03:38.709> strategies<00:03:39.190> I

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
versus risk-off investment strategies I

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.050 
versus risk-off investment strategies I
don't<00:03:39.610> think<00:03:39.700> that<00:03:40.209> there<00:03:40.450> is<00:03:40.480> a<00:03:40.650> case<00:03:41.650> for

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
don't think that there is a case for

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.920 
don't think that there is a case for
most<00:03:43.060> investors<00:03:43.690> trying<00:03:44.079> to<00:03:44.350> be<00:03:45.130> overly

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
most investors trying to be overly

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.020 
most investors trying to be overly
geared<00:03:46.930> towards<00:03:47.380> risk<00:03:47.829> on<00:03:48.100> and<00:03:48.400> whisk<00:03:48.640> whisk

geared towards risk on and whisk whisk

geared towards risk on and whisk whisk
off<00:03:49.360> I<00:03:49.600> think<00:03:49.989> for<00:03:50.260> large<00:03:50.590> institutional

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
off I think for large institutional

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.840 
off I think for large institutional
investors<00:03:51.880> with<00:03:52.090> longer-term<00:03:52.450> time<00:03:52.989> horizons

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
investors with longer-term time horizons

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:58.350 
investors with longer-term time horizons
that's<00:03:54.850> more<00:03:55.090> a<00:03:55.150> question<00:03:55.360> of<00:03:57.360> gradually

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:58.360 
that's more a question of gradually

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.600 
that's more a question of gradually
changing<00:03:58.959> one's<00:03:59.170> asset<00:03:59.500> allocation<00:04:00.160> taking

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:00.610 
changing one's asset allocation taking

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:03.199 
changing one's asset allocation taking
on<00:04:00.730> more<00:04:00.940> equity<00:04:01.450> which<00:04:01.630> taking<00:04:02.049> it<00:04:02.140> on<00:04:02.290> in

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
on more equity which taking it on in

on more equity which taking it on in
more<00:04:04.209> sensible<00:04:04.750> ways<00:04:04.959> and<00:04:05.320> for<00:04:06.010> example<00:04:06.100> the

more sensible ways and for example the

more sensible ways and for example the
