00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
side of my battery and I'm going to take

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.770 
side of my battery and I'm going to take
and<00:00:37.440> insert<00:00:37.800> it<00:00:37.980> into<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.850> ground<00:00:39.180> side<00:00:39.750> of

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
and insert it into the ground side of

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.030 
and insert it into the ground side of
the<00:00:40.140> circuit<00:00:40.590> as<00:00:41.329> you<00:00:42.329> can<00:00:42.480> see<00:00:42.690> my<00:00:43.649> test<00:00:43.950> light

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
the circuit as you can see my test light

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.000 
the circuit as you can see my test light
lights<00:00:44.370> up<00:00:44.579> that<00:00:45.110> indicates<00:00:46.110> that<00:00:46.649> the

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
lights up that indicates that the

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.569 
lights up that indicates that the
circuit<00:00:47.610> has<00:00:47.789> all<00:00:47.969> of<00:00:48.000> its<00:00:48.210> integrity<00:00:48.539> and

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:49.579 
circuit has all of its integrity and

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:51.860 
circuit has all of its integrity and
you're<00:00:50.579> going<00:00:50.730> to<00:00:50.760> want<00:00:50.940> to<00:00:51.030> take<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.420> repeat

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
you're going to want to take and repeat

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.490 
you're going to want to take and repeat
this<00:00:52.199> step<00:00:52.559> for<00:00:53.480> the<00:00:54.480> other<00:00:54.690> fog<00:00:55.289> light

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
this step for the other fog light

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.380 
this step for the other fog light
connector<00:00:56.329> which<00:00:57.329> is<00:00:57.360> over<00:00:57.750> here<00:00:59.149> as<00:01:00.149> you<00:01:00.210> can

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
connector which is over here as you can

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.569 
connector which is over here as you can
see<00:01:00.539> that<00:01:01.260> side<00:01:01.620> of<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:01.829> circuit<00:01:02.190> is<00:01:02.309> fine

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
see that side of the circuit is fine

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.549 
see that side of the circuit is fine
what<00:01:03.570> you're<00:01:03.719> going<00:01:03.840> to<00:01:03.899> want<00:01:04.080> to<00:01:04.170> do<00:01:04.320> is

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
what you're going to want to do is

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.420 
what you're going to want to do is
switch<00:01:05.220> your<00:01:05.970> connector<00:01:06.540> at<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.689> battery

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430 
switch your connector at the battery

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.990 
switch your connector at the battery
from<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.490> positive<00:01:09.450> side<00:01:09.810> to<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.950> ground<00:01:11.549> or

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
from the positive side to the ground or

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.330 
from the positive side to the ground or
negative<00:01:12.390> side<00:01:12.570> of<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.750> battery<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:13.340> check

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
negative side of the battery and check

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.850 
negative side of the battery and check
the<00:01:14.580> other<00:01:14.820> wire<00:01:15.299> and<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:16.200> connector<00:01:16.650> as<00:01:16.770> you

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
the other wire and the connector as you

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.070 
the other wire and the connector as you
can<00:01:16.979> see<00:01:17.130> there's<00:01:17.340> two<00:01:17.750> you're<00:01:18.750> going<00:01:18.869> to<00:01:18.930> want

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
can see there's two you're going to want

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.810 
can see there's two you're going to want
to<00:01:19.110> repeat<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.619> procedure<00:01:19.979> just<00:01:20.580> switch<00:01:20.790> your

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
to repeat the procedure just switch your

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.149 
to repeat the procedure just switch your
bat<00:01:21.090> it<00:01:21.330> splits<00:01:21.630> it<00:01:21.780> from<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.650> positive<00:01:22.860> to

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
bat it splits it from the positive to

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.160 
bat it splits it from the positive to
the<00:01:23.189> negative<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:23.780> select<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.900> other

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
the negative and select the other

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.170 
the negative and select the other
terminal<00:01:25.650> now<00:01:26.340> we'll<00:01:26.460> check<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.729> continuity

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
terminal now we'll check the continuity

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.870 
terminal now we'll check the continuity
of<00:01:27.210> both<00:01:27.420> sides<00:01:27.689> in<00:01:28.200> some<00:01:28.680> cases<00:01:29.220> in<00:01:29.430> order<00:01:29.579> to

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
of both sides in some cases in order to

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.420 
of both sides in some cases in order to
test<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.630> ground<00:01:30.869> side<00:01:31.290> of<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.470> circuit<00:01:31.560> if

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
test the ground side of the circuit if

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.130 
test the ground side of the circuit if
it<00:01:32.579> happens<00:01:32.850> to<00:01:32.880> have<00:01:33.030> a<00:01:33.090> ground<00:01:33.420> side<00:01:33.720> switch

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
it happens to have a ground side switch

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.350 
it happens to have a ground side switch
you<00:01:34.890> will<00:01:35.040> need<00:01:35.220> to<00:01:35.400> turn<00:01:35.610> on<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:36.000> vehicle

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
you will need to turn on the vehicle

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.810 
you will need to turn on the vehicle
