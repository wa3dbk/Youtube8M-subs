clan fights and moves is at is as you

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.820 
clan fights and moves is at is as you
can<00:01:09.390> see<00:01:09.479> they're<00:01:09.750> very<00:01:09.900> very<00:01:10.320> fast<00:01:10.560> very

acrobatic you can also pay attention to
where<00:01:14.250> I'm<00:01:14.549> shooting<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:16.320> bandits<00:01:16.680> because

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
where I'm shooting the bandits because

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.590 
where I'm shooting the bandits because
they'll<00:01:17.189> react<00:01:17.520> to<00:01:17.759> where<00:01:17.939> they<00:01:18.060> get<00:01:18.150> hit<00:01:18.390> and

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
they'll react to where they get hit and

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.630 
they'll react to where they get hit and
they'll<00:01:19.439> grab<00:01:19.650> areas<00:01:20.009> of<00:01:20.100> their<00:01:20.189> body<00:01:20.369> of<00:01:20.580> the

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
they'll grab areas of their body of the

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.670 
they'll grab areas of their body of the
slow<00:01:20.909> down<00:01:21.150> they'll<00:01:21.600> go<00:01:21.960> change<00:01:22.290> their<00:01:22.500> pace

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
and it really adds a neat aspect to the

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.060 
and it really adds a neat aspect to the
game<00:01:25.560> and<00:01:26.070> it<00:01:26.610> gives<00:01:26.820> a<00:01:27.090> gives<00:01:27.840> you<00:01:28.110> a<00:01:28.560> lot<00:01:29.009> of

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
game and it gives a gives you a lot of

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.210 
game and it gives a gives you a lot of
feedback<00:01:29.369> to<00:01:30.470> to<00:01:31.470> how<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.650> action<00:01:32.100> is

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
feedback to to how the action is

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.850 
feedback to to how the action is
unfolding<00:01:32.700> so<00:01:33.689> there's<00:01:34.229> some<00:01:34.380> more<00:01:34.500> bandits

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
unfolding so there's some more bandits

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.530 
unfolding so there's some more bandits
that<00:01:35.009> around<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.340> corner<00:01:35.670> I've<00:01:36.119> brought<00:01:36.360> up

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
that around the corner I've brought up

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.530

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.720 
my crossbow with my electric pole I'm
going<00:01:39.720> to<00:01:39.810> try<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:39.990> sneak<00:01:40.380> around

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:41.730 
going to try to sneak around

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.690 
going to try to sneak around
slap<00:01:42.660> the<00:01:43.020> water<00:01:43.230> there<00:01:43.470> we<00:01:43.560> go<00:01:43.740> before<00:01:44.550> they

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
slap the water there we go before they

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.690 
slap the water there we go before they
have<00:01:44.820> a<00:01:44.850> chance<00:01:44.940> to<00:01:45.620> realize<00:01:46.620> that<00:01:46.950> i<00:01:46.980> am<00:01:47.250> a<00:01:47.310> i'm

the fact that you know it was built in
the<00:03:52.550> ground<00:03:52.850> up<00:03:53.150> we<00:03:53.480> have<00:03:53.570> all<00:03:53.780> these<00:03:54.110> systems

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
the ground up we have all these systems

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.310 
the ground up we have all these systems
that<00:03:54.830> it'll<00:03:55.220> run<00:03:55.370> on<00:03:55.400> so<00:03:56.120> it<00:03:56.840> will<00:03:57.020> actually
