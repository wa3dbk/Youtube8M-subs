so<00:00:12.180> therapy<00:00:12.690> is<00:00:12.870> not<00:00:13.139> surgery<00:00:13.860> it's<00:00:14.370> not

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
so therapy is not surgery it's not

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.280 
so therapy is not surgery it's not
plastic<00:00:15.510> surgery<00:00:16.139> but<00:00:16.560> ultherapy<00:00:17.310> is<00:00:18.290> bull

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:19.290 
plastic surgery but ultherapy is bull

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.769 
plastic surgery but ultherapy is bull
can<00:00:19.740> give<00:00:19.950> you<00:00:20.099> effects<00:00:20.550> similar<00:00:21.180> to<00:00:21.390> plastic

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
can give you effects similar to plastic

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.870 
can give you effects similar to plastic
surgery<00:00:21.810> because<00:00:22.110> actually<00:00:22.560> targets<00:00:23.430> the

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
surgery because actually targets the

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.730 
surgery because actually targets the
same<00:00:24.210> fiber<00:00:24.480> muscular<00:00:25.050> layer<00:00:25.199> that<00:00:25.410> same

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
same fiber muscular layer that same

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.070 
same fiber muscular layer that same
layer<00:00:26.039> that<00:00:26.279> plastic<00:00:26.730> surgeons<00:00:26.939> target<00:00:27.660> when

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
layer that plastic surgeons target when

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.540 
layer that plastic surgeons target when
they<00:00:28.260> do<00:00:28.320> plastic<00:00:28.710> surgery<00:00:28.920> when<00:00:29.310> they<00:00:29.400> use

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
they do plastic surgery when they use

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.020 
they do plastic surgery when they use
facebook<00:00:30.000> so<00:00:30.869> othera<00:00:31.349> p<00:00:31.619> is<00:00:31.949> based<00:00:32.760> on

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
facebook so othera p is based on

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.369 
facebook so othera p is based on
ultrasound<00:00:33.570> and<00:00:33.870> that's<00:00:34.140> why<00:00:34.230> it's<00:00:34.350> called

00:00:34.369 --> 00:00:34.379 
ultrasound and that's why it's called

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:36.530 
ultrasound and that's why it's called
ultherapy<00:00:34.710> for<00:00:35.280> ultrasound<00:00:35.640> this<00:00:36.269> is<00:00:36.360> what<00:00:36.480> it

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
ultherapy for ultrasound this is what it

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.290 
ultherapy for ultrasound this is what it
looks<00:00:36.720> like<00:00:36.840> it's<00:00:37.050> right<00:00:37.199> here<00:00:37.410> and<00:00:37.620> it<00:00:38.550> has<00:00:38.730> an

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
looks like it's right here and it has an

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.049 
looks like it's right here and it has an
ultrasound<00:00:39.839> screen<00:00:40.290> and<00:00:40.850> it<00:00:41.850> has<00:00:42.030> a

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
ultrasound screen and it has a

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.150 
ultrasound screen and it has a
transducer<00:00:42.660> that<00:00:42.930> we<00:00:43.050> use<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.469> generate<00:00:43.800> the

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
transducer that we use to generate the

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.500 
transducer that we use to generate the
energy<00:00:44.250> that's<00:00:44.610> delivered<00:00:45.030> to<00:00:45.120> this<00:00:45.210> gift

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
energy that's delivered to this gift

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.139 
energy that's delivered to this gift
it's<00:00:46.410> actually<00:00:46.530> five<00:00:46.920> to<00:00:47.129> six<00:00:47.430> hundred<00:00:47.520> lines

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
it's actually five to six hundred lines

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.330 
it's actually five to six hundred lines
of<00:00:48.539> energy<00:00:48.930> is<00:00:48.989> actually<00:00:49.320> ten<00:00:49.620> thousand

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
of energy is actually ten thousand

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.069 
of energy is actually ten thousand
little<00:00:50.700> points<00:00:51.180> in<00:00:51.270> your<00:00:51.360> face<00:00:51.629> when<00:00:51.899> we<00:00:51.960> do

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
little points in your face when we do

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.990 
little points in your face when we do
your<00:00:52.230> whole<00:00:52.410> face<00:00:52.649> and<00:00:52.980> underneath<00:00:53.550> your<00:00:53.789> chin

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
your whole face and underneath your chin

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.720 
your whole face and underneath your chin
there's<00:00:54.539> 10,000<00:00:55.500> energy<00:00:55.949> depositions<00:00:56.579> in

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
there's 10,000 energy depositions in

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.910 
there's 10,000 energy depositions in
your<00:00:56.910> skin<00:00:57.210> so<00:00:57.870> this<00:00:58.020> is<00:00:58.170> Barbara<00:00:58.530> actually

marked you know very carefully and then
she<00:01:07.050> we<00:01:07.680> delivered<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.430> energy<00:01:08.820> between<00:01:08.970> the

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
she we delivered the energy between the

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.109 
she we delivered the energy between the
lines<00:01:09.660> and<00:01:10.340> you'll<00:01:11.340> see<00:01:11.550> that<00:01:11.580> she's<00:01:11.880> getting

00:01:19.699 --> 00:01:19.709 
anything and you can see that there's a

00:01:19.709 --> 00:01:21.740 
anything and you can see that there's a
there's<00:01:20.190> a<00:01:20.399> screen<00:01:20.789> in<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.090> background<00:01:21.569> where

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
there's a screen in the background where

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.080 
there's a screen in the background where
we<00:01:21.929> want<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:22.920> make<00:01:23.099> sure<00:01:23.130> that<00:01:23.550> we're<00:01:23.729> treating

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
we want to make sure that we're treating

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.279 
we want to make sure that we're treating
the<00:01:24.179> exact<00:01:24.450> level<00:01:24.660> because<00:01:24.929> there's<00:01:25.110> places

00:01:25.279 --> 00:01:25.289 
the exact level because there's places

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:26.900 
the exact level because there's places
on<00:01:25.530> your<00:01:25.619> face<00:01:25.830> where<00:01:26.039> the<00:01:26.130> bone<00:01:26.340> is<00:01:26.369> close<00:01:26.729> to

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:26.910 
on your face where the bone is close to

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:27.889 
on your face where the bone is close to
the<00:01:27.030> skin<00:01:27.240> that<00:01:27.360> you<00:01:27.420> have<00:01:27.569> to<00:01:27.660> be<00:01:27.750> careful

00:01:27.889 --> 00:01:27.899 
the skin that you have to be careful

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:29.809 
the skin that you have to be careful
there's<00:01:28.470> also<00:01:28.590> places<00:01:29.130> on<00:01:29.250> your<00:01:29.369> face<00:01:29.580> where

00:01:29.809 --> 00:01:29.819 
there's also places on your face where

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:31.339 
there's also places on your face where
the<00:01:29.970> where<00:01:30.360> there's<00:01:30.539> nerves<00:01:30.780> close<00:01:31.050> to<00:01:31.229> the

00:01:31.339 --> 00:01:31.349 
the where there's nerves close to the

00:01:31.349 --> 00:01:32.510 
the where there's nerves close to the
skin<00:01:31.560> so<00:01:31.770> you<00:01:31.860> have<00:01:31.950> to<00:01:32.039> be<00:01:32.099> careful<00:01:32.250> but

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
skin so you have to be careful but

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.969 
skin so you have to be careful but
that's<00:01:32.670> all<00:01:32.849> visualized<00:01:33.509> and<00:01:33.869> that's<00:01:34.349> why<00:01:34.590> L

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
that's all visualized and that's why L

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.660 
that's all visualized and that's why L
therapy<00:01:35.459> is<00:01:35.610> so<00:01:35.940> special<00:01:37.220> ok<00:01:38.220> so<00:01:38.310> who's<00:01:38.550> the

good results really the age to do this

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:49.969 
good results really the age to do this
is<00:01:47.280> probably<00:01:47.520> around<00:01:47.910> probably<00:01:48.750> 40s<00:01:49.590> to<00:01:49.770> 60s

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
is probably around probably 40s to 60s

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.210 
is probably around probably 40s to 60s
is<00:01:50.520> probably<00:01:50.910> the<00:01:51.090> best<00:01:51.270> maybe<00:01:51.479> 30<00:01:51.840> s<00:01:51.989> 2<00:01:52.619> 60<00:01:53.190> s

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.109 
is probably the best maybe 30 s 2 60 s
so<00:01:53.700> somebody<00:01:54.239> who<00:01:54.509> has<00:01:54.750> a<00:01:55.200> lot<00:01:56.099> of<00:01:56.130> laxity<00:01:56.789> is

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
so somebody who has a lot of laxity is

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.809 
so somebody who has a lot of laxity is
not<00:01:57.599> really<00:01:57.989> a<00:01:58.020> good<00:01:58.590> candidate<00:01:59.099> and<00:01:59.459> then

00:01:59.809 --> 00:01:59.819 
not really a good candidate and then

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:01.760 
not really a good candidate and then
tissue<00:02:00.209> volume<00:02:00.479> so<00:02:00.869> look<00:02:01.140> at<00:02:01.229> this<00:02:01.259> guy<00:02:01.530> I<00:02:01.560> mean

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
tissue volume so look at this guy I mean

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.830 
tissue volume so look at this guy I mean
he<00:02:01.830> has<00:02:02.099> a<00:02:02.130> good<00:02:02.369> result<00:02:02.759> actually<00:02:03.569> he<00:02:03.660> look

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
he has a good result actually he look

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.869 
he has a good result actually he look
slimmer<00:02:04.289> you<00:02:04.649> can<00:02:04.770> see<00:02:04.920> his<00:02:05.009> cheekbone<00:02:05.550> more

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:05.879 
slimmer you can see his cheekbone more

00:02:05.879 --> 00:02:08.270 
slimmer you can see his cheekbone more
he<00:02:06.360> has<00:02:06.450> a<00:02:06.479> nice<00:02:06.780> jaw<00:02:07.110> line<00:02:07.349> he's<00:02:07.770> pretty<00:02:08.039> heavy

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
he has a nice jaw line he's pretty heavy

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.369 
he has a nice jaw line he's pretty heavy
but<00:02:08.670> it<00:02:08.789> kind<00:02:08.940> of<00:02:09.030> pulled<00:02:09.330> everything<00:02:09.599> up<00:02:09.869> she

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
but it kind of pulled everything up she

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.680 
but it kind of pulled everything up she
has<00:02:10.530> too<00:02:10.920> much<00:02:11.250> flat<00:02:11.790> she<00:02:12.030> has<00:02:12.150> too<00:02:12.450> much

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
has too much flat she has too much

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.960 
has too much flat she has too much
tissue<00:02:13.020> volume<00:02:13.319> the<00:02:14.010> lower<00:02:14.220> part<00:02:14.580> of<00:02:14.640> her<00:02:14.790> face

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
tissue volume the lower part of her face

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.970 
tissue volume the lower part of her face
cuz<00:02:15.540> she<00:02:15.690> didn't<00:02:15.930> get<00:02:16.050> that<00:02:16.230> good<00:02:16.379> of<00:02:16.410> a<00:02:16.620> result

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
cuz she didn't get that good of a result

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.210 
cuz she didn't get that good of a result
and<00:02:17.880> then<00:02:18.330> the<00:02:18.450> tissue<00:02:18.690> quality<00:02:18.990> or<00:02:19.620> your<00:02:19.950> skin

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
and then the tissue quality or your skin

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.320 
and then the tissue quality or your skin
quality<00:02:20.430> is

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
quality is

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.030 
quality is
is<00:02:21.390> good<00:02:21.630> quality<00:02:21.930> of<00:02:22.260> her<00:02:22.380> skin<00:02:22.590> her<00:02:22.770> brows

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
is good quality of her skin her brows

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.120 
is good quality of her skin her brows
are<00:02:23.340> listed<00:02:23.730> but<00:02:24.150> if<00:02:24.360> your<00:02:24.540> skin<00:02:24.960> is<00:02:25.260> very

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
are listed but if your skin is very

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.750 
are listed but if your skin is very
lacks<00:02:26.550> and<00:02:26.970> your<00:02:27.870> skin<00:02:28.110> quality<00:02:28.320> is<00:02:28.650> thin<00:02:29.100> you

lacks and your skin quality is thin you

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.910 
lacks and your skin quality is thin you
again<00:02:30.120> this<00:02:30.270> woman<00:02:30.690> has<00:02:30.840> lost<00:02:30.870> the<00:02:31.410> ability<00:02:31.440> to

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
again this woman has lost the ability to

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.370 
again this woman has lost the ability to
really<00:02:32.730> produce<00:02:33.090> elastin<00:02:33.930> and<00:02:34.140> collagen

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
really produce elastin and collagen

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.310 
really produce elastin and collagen
fibers<00:02:35.190> when<00:02:35.400> she<00:02:35.520> stimulated<00:02:36.180> so<00:02:36.810> you<00:02:37.170> can

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
fibers when she stimulated so you can

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.600 
fibers when she stimulated so you can
see<00:02:37.440> this<00:02:37.560> is<00:02:37.710> a<00:02:37.740> before<00:02:38.130> and<00:02:38.250> after<00:02:38.340> and

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
see this is a before and after and

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:39.680 
see this is a before and after and
there's<00:02:38.760> no<00:02:38.910> early<00:02:39.090> not<00:02:39.240> much<00:02:39.420> of<00:02:39.570> an

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
there's no early not much of an

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.840 
there's no early not much of an
improvement<00:02:40.010> excessive<00:02:41.010> wrinkling<00:02:41.460> if<00:02:41.700> you

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
improvement excessive wrinkling if you

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.760 
improvement excessive wrinkling if you
very<00:02:42.300> heavy<00:02:42.600> and<00:02:42.720> you<00:02:42.930> have<00:02:43.050> that<00:02:43.170> redundancy

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
very heavy and you have that redundancy

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.310 
very heavy and you have that redundancy
from<00:02:44.190> from<00:02:44.730> just<00:02:45.000> that<00:02:45.540> you're<00:02:45.990> not<00:02:46.140> a<00:02:46.170> good

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
from from just that you're not a good

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.660 
from from just that you're not a good
cavity<00:02:46.650> if<00:02:46.710> you<00:02:46.770> have<00:02:46.860> excessive<00:02:47.340> scarring

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
cavity if you have excessive scarring

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.670 
cavity if you have excessive scarring
you're<00:02:48.090> not<00:02:48.240> a<00:02:48.270> good<00:02:48.480> candidate<00:02:48.900> if<00:02:49.230> you<00:02:49.440> have

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
you're not a good candidate if you have

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.710 
you're not a good candidate if you have
excessive<00:02:50.400> laxity<00:02:50.880> you're<00:02:51.420> not<00:02:51.540> a<00:02:51.570> good

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
excessive laxity you're not a good

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.150 
excessive laxity you're not a good
candidate<00:02:52.110> where<00:02:52.290> you<00:02:52.380> really<00:02:52.860> have<00:02:53.040> that

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
candidate where you really have that

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.220 
candidate where you really have that
really<00:02:53.610> droopy<00:02:53.850> skin<00:02:54.030> and<00:02:54.870> what<00:02:55.020> kind<00:02:55.170> of

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
really droopy skin and what kind of

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.260 
really droopy skin and what kind of
results<00:02:55.380> can<00:02:55.770> you<00:02:55.800> expect<00:02:55.940> well<00:02:56.940> you<00:02:56.970> can

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
results can you expect well you can

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:58.880 
results can you expect well you can
reach<00:02:57.390> expect<00:02:57.870> that<00:02:58.020> your<00:02:58.140> brows<00:02:58.440> will<00:02:58.770> be

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
reach expect that your brows will be

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.010 
reach expect that your brows will be
lifted<00:02:59.340> and<00:02:59.520> you<00:03:00.120> can<00:03:00.270> see<00:03:00.450> that<00:03:00.480> this<00:03:00.720> is<00:03:00.870> only

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.020 
lifted and you can see that this is only

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.080 
lifted and you can see that this is only
19<00:03:01.440> days<00:03:01.650> after<00:03:02.040> the<00:03:02.130> procedure<00:03:02.310> you<00:03:02.790> can<00:03:02.940> see

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
19 days after the procedure you can see

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.090 
19 days after the procedure you can see
that<00:03:03.240> her<00:03:03.330> name<00:03:03.510> is<00:03:03.570> improved<00:03:04.110> and<00:03:04.320> then<00:03:04.950> you

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
that her name is improved and then you

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.590 
that her name is improved and then you
can<00:03:05.280> see<00:03:05.430> that<00:03:05.610> her<00:03:05.790> face<00:03:06.090> like<00:03:06.390> we<00:03:06.480> were

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
can see that her face like we were

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.270 
can see that her face like we were
talking<00:03:06.900> about<00:03:06.959> before<00:03:07.170> she<00:03:07.920> lost<00:03:08.100> these

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
talking about before she lost these

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.010 
talking about before she lost these
jowls<00:03:08.610> her<00:03:08.820> face<00:03:09.000> actually<00:03:09.420> has<00:03:09.540> become<00:03:09.840> more

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020 
jowls her face actually has become more

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.350 
jowls her face actually has become more
oval<00:03:10.530> and<00:03:10.709> less<00:03:11.220> rectangular<00:03:11.970> because<00:03:12.240> that

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
oval and less rectangular because that

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.170 
oval and less rectangular because that
rectangular<00:03:12.900> face<00:03:13.290> is<00:03:13.560> a<00:03:13.950> characteristic<00:03:14.760> of

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
rectangular face is a characteristic of

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.390 
rectangular face is a characteristic of
aging<00:03:15.600> I<00:03:15.810> wanted<00:03:16.500> to<00:03:16.560> remind<00:03:16.890> everybody<00:03:17.190> that

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
aging I wanted to remind everybody that

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.190 
aging I wanted to remind everybody that
this<00:03:17.550> again<00:03:17.940> this<00:03:18.060> is<00:03:18.209> not<00:03:18.240> plastic<00:03:18.810> surgery

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
this again this is not plastic surgery

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.930 
this again this is not plastic surgery
so<00:03:19.470> you<00:03:19.530> know<00:03:19.950> it's<00:03:20.130> not<00:03:20.310> you<00:03:20.550> have<00:03:20.820> to

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
so you know it's not you have to

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.460 
so you know it's not you have to
understand<00:03:21.390> it's<00:03:21.540> non-invasive<00:03:21.870> you're<00:03:22.350> not

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
understand it's non-invasive you're not

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.230 
understand it's non-invasive you're not
going<00:03:22.650> to<00:03:22.709> get<00:03:22.830> those<00:03:23.160> results<00:03:23.400> necessarily

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:24.240 
going to get those results necessarily

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.330 
going to get those results necessarily
you<00:03:24.330> would<00:03:24.480> get<00:03:24.630> for<00:03:24.990> plastic<00:03:25.410> surgery<00:03:25.440> it's<00:03:26.220> a

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
you would get for plastic surgery it's a

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.940 
you would get for plastic surgery it's a
one-time<00:03:26.790> thing<00:03:27.150> it<00:03:27.480> takes<00:03:28.290> throughout<00:03:28.590> three

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
one-time thing it takes throughout three

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.040 
one-time thing it takes throughout three
to<00:03:29.100> six<00:03:29.370> months<00:03:29.459> to<00:03:30.090> get<00:03:30.570> your<00:03:30.750> results

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
to six months to get your results

there's lifting and toning of the skin
as<00:03:33.300> well<00:03:33.600> as<00:03:33.959> tightening<00:03:34.709> of<00:03:34.860> the<00:03:34.890> skin<00:03:35.010> and

as well as tightening of the skin and

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:38.350 
as well as tightening of the skin and
what<00:03:36.630> I<00:03:36.660> tell<00:03:36.900> people<00:03:36.930> to<00:03:37.230> it's<00:03:37.500> like<00:03:37.680> putting

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:38.360 
what I tell people to it's like putting

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.550 
what I tell people to it's like putting
collagen<00:03:39.360> in<00:03:39.510> the<00:03:39.540> bank<00:03:39.840> even<00:03:40.230> if<00:03:40.320> you're<00:03:40.440> in

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
collagen in the bank even if you're in

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.199 
collagen in the bank even if you're in
your<00:03:40.680> 30s<00:03:41.070> and<00:03:41.220> you<00:03:41.340> did<00:03:41.489> this<00:03:41.610> for<00:03:41.790> example<00:03:42.000> I

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
your 30s and you did this for example I

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:43.640 
your 30s and you did this for example I
mean<00:03:42.360> you're<00:03:42.480> still<00:03:42.720> building<00:03:43.110> collagen<00:03:43.560> and

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
mean you're still building collagen and

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:44.990 
mean you're still building collagen and
why<00:03:43.769> you<00:03:43.830> have<00:03:44.070> that<00:03:44.220> ability<00:03:44.459> to<00:03:44.790> generate

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
why you have that ability to generate

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.509 
why you have that ability to generate
all<00:03:45.330> that<00:03:45.480> collagen<00:03:45.959> maybe<00:03:46.470> in<00:03:46.830> 20<00:03:47.040> or<00:03:47.220> 30

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
all that collagen maybe in 20 or 30

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:49.790 
all that collagen maybe in 20 or 30
years<00:03:47.790> from<00:03:47.910> now<00:03:48.000> you<00:03:48.570> won't<00:03:48.750> need<00:03:49.050> to<00:03:49.680> have

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:49.800 
years from now you won't need to have

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.009 
years from now you won't need to have
plastic<00:03:50.250> surgery<00:03:50.280> the<00:03:51.180> thing<00:03:51.390> about<00:03:51.420> it<00:03:51.750> is<00:03:51.870> it

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
plastic surgery the thing about it is it

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:53.330 
plastic surgery the thing about it is it
does<00:03:52.260> hurt<00:03:52.440> a<00:03:52.500> little<00:03:52.650> bit<00:03:52.800> and<00:03:52.920> if<00:03:53.010> you<00:03:53.100> read

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
does hurt a little bit and if you read

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.520 
does hurt a little bit and if you read
about<00:03:53.370> it<00:03:53.730> online<00:03:53.850> you'll<00:03:54.269> find<00:03:54.570> that<00:03:54.810> it<00:03:55.019> can

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
about it online you'll find that it can

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.009 
about it online you'll find that it can
potentially<00:03:55.709> hurt<00:03:56.340> somewhat<00:03:56.880> however<00:03:57.570> it

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
potentially hurt somewhat however it

00:03:58.019 --> 00:03:59.960 
potentially hurt somewhat however it
only<00:03:58.380> hurts<00:03:58.709> while<00:03:59.010> it's<00:03:59.250> being<00:03:59.430> done<00:03:59.730> there's

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
only hurts while it's being done there's

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.090 
only hurts while it's being done there's
no<00:04:00.209> lasting<00:04:00.810> sensation<00:04:01.410> afterwards<00:04:01.890> for<00:04:02.010> the

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
no lasting sensation afterwards for the

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.040 
no lasting sensation afterwards for the
first<00:04:02.340> part<00:04:02.580> and<00:04:02.730> then<00:04:03.239> I<00:04:03.480> can<00:04:03.660> always<00:04:03.780> give

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.050 
first part and then I can always give

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:05.990 
first part and then I can always give
oral<00:04:04.380> anesthesia<00:04:04.980> like<00:04:05.220> four<00:04:05.550> tab<00:04:05.790> or

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
oral anesthesia like four tab or

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.550 
oral anesthesia like four tab or
something<00:04:06.269> like<00:04:06.360> or<00:04:06.780> valium<00:04:07.410> or<00:04:07.530> something

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
something like or valium or something

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.220 
something like or valium or something
that<00:04:07.860> but<00:04:08.130> I<00:04:08.400> found<00:04:09.209> something<00:04:09.420> better<00:04:09.690> so

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
that but I found something better so

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:11.630 
that but I found something better so
what<00:04:10.380> I<00:04:10.410> do<00:04:10.530> is<00:04:10.680> I<00:04:10.920> noticed<00:04:11.310> that<00:04:11.370> over

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
what I do is I noticed that over

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.550 
what I do is I noticed that over
particular<00:04:12.269> points<00:04:12.600> like<00:04:12.720> over<00:04:12.989> the<00:04:13.140> bone<00:04:13.320> or

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
particular points like over the bone or

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.229 
particular points like over the bone or
over<00:04:13.739> places<00:04:14.100> where<00:04:14.220> there's<00:04:14.370> nerves<00:04:14.700> it

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
over places where there's nerves it

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:16.909 
over places where there's nerves it
hurts<00:04:15.540> a<00:04:15.600> little<00:04:15.720> bit<00:04:15.840> more<00:04:16.019> so<00:04:16.260> what<00:04:16.440> I<00:04:16.470> do<00:04:16.560> now

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
hurts a little bit more so what I do now

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:20.509 
hurts a little bit more so what I do now
is<00:04:17.220> I<00:04:17.880> do<00:04:17.940> local<00:04:18.630> anesthesia<00:04:19.169> and<00:04:20.010> then<00:04:20.190> just

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
is I do local anesthesia and then just

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:22.820 
is I do local anesthesia and then just
in<00:04:20.669> summary<00:04:20.940> so<00:04:21.780> it's<00:04:22.080> a<00:04:22.290> non-surgical

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
in summary so it's a non-surgical

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.830 
in summary so it's a non-surgical
non-invasive<00:04:23.760> treatment<00:04:24.210> there's<00:04:24.360> really<00:04:24.570> no

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
non-invasive treatment there's really no

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.780 
non-invasive treatment there's really no
downtime<00:04:25.380> it's<00:04:25.710> proven<00:04:26.310> ultrasound

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.790 
downtime it's proven ultrasound

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:28.610 
downtime it's proven ultrasound
technology<00:04:27.360> so<00:04:27.540> it's<00:04:27.690> very<00:04:27.870> safe<00:04:28.169> and<00:04:28.440> it's

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
technology so it's very safe and it's

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.800 
technology so it's very safe and it's
very<00:04:28.830> innovative<00:04:29.070> and<00:04:29.550> natural<00:04:30.270> and<00:04:30.390> gradual

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
very innovative and natural and gradual

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:32.360 
very innovative and natural and gradual
results<00:04:31.229> which<00:04:31.350> is<00:04:31.470> very<00:04:31.680> important<00:04:32.100> it's

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
results which is very important it's

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:33.790 
results which is very important it's
short<00:04:32.940> together

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 
short together

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.770

done there's no recuperation needs it's

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.830

one treatment and you get visible and
