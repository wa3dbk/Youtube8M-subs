00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:56.880 
will make a shortcut forward I already

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.760 
will make a shortcut forward I already
have<00:00:57.180> one<00:00:57.210> so<00:00:57.510> I'm<00:00:57.600> not<00:00:57.720> gonna<00:00:57.810> put<00:00:58.500> it<00:00:58.620> there

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
have one so I'm not gonna put it there

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.350 
have one so I'm not gonna put it there
make<00:00:59.130> sure<00:00:59.160> you<00:00:59.400> don't<00:00:59.580> accidentally<00:01:00.000> put<00:01:00.240> it

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:00.360 
make sure you don't accidentally put it

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.210 
make sure you don't accidentally put it
in<00:01:00.480> one<00:01:00.630> of<00:01:00.690> these<00:01:00.870> holders<00:01:01.380> because<00:01:01.950> that

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:02.220 
in one of these holders because that

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.149 
in one of these holders because that
would<00:01:02.340> be<00:01:02.460> pretty<00:01:02.700> bad<00:01:02.940> so<00:01:03.930> if<00:01:04.409> you<00:01:04.649> do<00:01:04.829> just

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
would be pretty bad so if you do just

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.620 
would be pretty bad so if you do just
take<00:01:05.399> it<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:05.969> drag<00:01:06.960> it<00:01:06.990> out<00:01:07.200> into<00:01:08.299> it<00:01:09.299> back

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
take it and drag it out into it back

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.749 
take it and drag it out into it back
into<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:09.990> dock<00:01:10.320> so<00:01:12.890> what<00:01:13.890> we're<00:01:14.009> gonna<00:01:14.130> do

00:01:14.749 --> 00:01:14.759 
into the dock so what we're gonna do

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:19.279 
into the dock so what we're gonna do
next<00:01:14.939> is<00:01:16.700> click<00:01:17.700> on<00:01:17.850> texture<00:01:18.329> packs<00:01:18.569> and<00:01:18.899> again

00:01:19.279 --> 00:01:19.289 
next is click on texture packs and again

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:21.859 
next is click on texture packs and again

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
and that's your temperature rack holder

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.899 
and that's your temperature rack holder
so<00:01:22.229> next<00:01:23.039> you're<00:01:23.159> gonna<00:01:23.219> have<00:01:23.399> to<00:01:23.549> obviously
