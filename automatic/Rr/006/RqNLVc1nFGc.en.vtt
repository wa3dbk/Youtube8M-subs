00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
design well the first the first thing we

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.440

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
thing about maintenance and I don't you

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.060 
thing about maintenance and I don't you
know<00:00:35.850> maintenance<00:00:36.750> is<00:00:36.899> huge<00:00:37.170> and<00:00:37.440> being<00:00:37.950> able

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
know maintenance is huge and being able

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.670 
know maintenance is huge and being able
to<00:00:38.250> have<00:00:38.460> people<00:00:39.210> that<00:00:39.600> can<00:00:40.020> come<00:00:40.230> work<00:00:40.440> on<00:00:40.590> the

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
to have people that can come work on the

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.260 
to have people that can come work on the
boat<00:00:40.860> readily<00:00:41.399> available<00:00:41.520> wherever<00:00:41.910> you<00:00:42.239> are

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
boat readily available wherever you are

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.209 
boat readily available wherever you are
that's<00:00:43.140> really<00:00:43.500> important<00:00:43.890> if<00:00:43.980> you're<00:00:44.100> gonna

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
that's really important if you're gonna

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.790 
that's really important if you're gonna
travel<00:00:44.399> around<00:00:44.550> on<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:44.910> boat<00:00:45.059> so<00:00:45.390> if<00:00:46.379> you

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
travel around on the boat so if you

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.440 
travel around on the boat so if you
think<00:00:46.950> of<00:00:47.100> that<00:00:47.219> cat<00:00:47.520> I<00:00:47.760> mean<00:00:47.910> it's<00:00:48.030> really<00:00:48.300> the

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
think of that cat I mean it's really the

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.639 
think of that cat I mean it's really the
first<00:00:48.570> thing<00:00:48.780> I<00:00:48.870> think<00:00:49.079> about<00:00:49.170> is<00:00:49.440> they're

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
first thing I think about is they're

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.040 
first thing I think about is they're
their<00:00:49.860> dealer<00:00:50.100> network<00:00:50.460> their<00:00:50.760> ability<00:00:51.149> to<00:00:51.480> to

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
their dealer network their ability to to

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.400 
their dealer network their ability to to
service<00:00:52.489> parts<00:00:53.489> pieces<00:00:53.809> there<00:00:54.809> they<00:00:55.230> do<00:00:55.289> a

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
service parts pieces there they do a

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.900 
service parts pieces there they do a
really<00:00:55.800> really<00:00:55.920> good<00:00:56.280> job<00:00:56.460> with<00:00:56.579> that<00:00:56.760> and

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
really really good job with that and

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.029 
really really good job with that and
then<00:00:57.000> of<00:00:57.120> course<00:00:57.300> their<00:00:57.899> products<00:00:58.350> are<00:00:58.500> really

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
then of course their products are really

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.729 
then of course their products are really
really<00:00:59.430> sought-after<00:01:00.239> he'll<00:01:00.780> find<00:01:01.620> his

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
really sought-after he'll find his

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.590 
really sought-after he'll find his
yachts<00:01:01.920> in<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.160> world<00:01:02.340> have<00:01:03.120> caterpillar

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
yachts in the world have caterpillar

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.359 
yachts in the world have caterpillar
engines<00:01:03.899> in<00:01:04.049> them<00:01:04.170> so<00:01:04.470> for<00:01:05.070> me<00:01:05.189> it's<00:01:05.339> a

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
engines in them so for me it's a

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.880 
engines in them so for me it's a
no-brainer<00:01:05.519> I<00:01:05.850> mean<00:01:06.090> it<00:01:06.409> they<00:01:07.409> immediately

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
no-brainer I mean it they immediately

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:08.990 
no-brainer I mean it they immediately
from<00:01:08.100> day<00:01:08.280> one<00:01:08.490> when<00:01:08.610> I<00:01:08.670> started<00:01:08.909> thinking

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
from day one when I started thinking

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.640 
from day one when I started thinking
about<00:01:09.150> this<00:01:09.390> project<00:01:09.630> that<00:01:10.080> was<00:01:10.229> gonna<00:01:10.350> be<00:01:10.500> the

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
about this project that was gonna be the

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.670 
about this project that was gonna be the
power<00:01:11.610> of<00:01:11.790> choice<00:01:12.030> I<00:01:12.450> went<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.320> them<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:13.619> I

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
power of choice I went to them and I

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.499 
power of choice I went to them and I
said<00:01:13.740> okay<00:01:14.070> I'm<00:01:14.130> gonna<00:01:14.220> build<00:01:14.400> this<00:01:14.520> vote<00:01:14.760> but

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
said okay I'm gonna build this vote but

Gina's cat genset in the boat and you

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.100 
Gina's cat genset in the boat and you
know<00:01:43.430> the<00:01:43.729> reason<00:01:44.000> I'm<00:01:44.090> doing<00:01:44.180> that<00:01:44.479> you're

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:46.540 
know the reason I'm doing that you're
honest<00:01:45.380> isn't<00:01:45.590> because<00:01:45.800> they're<00:01:45.920> my<00:01:46.100> sponsor

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:46.550 
honest isn't because they're my sponsor

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.490 
honest isn't because they're my sponsor
is<00:01:46.700> because<00:01:47.060> if<00:01:47.750> you<00:01:47.900> look<00:01:47.930> at<00:01:48.170> the<00:01:48.260> dealer

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
is because if you look at the dealer

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:49.840 
is because if you look at the dealer
network<00:01:48.830> and<00:01:49.430> you<00:01:49.520> look<00:01:49.670> at<00:01:49.790> the

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
network and you look at the

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:51.670 
network and you look at the
serviceability<00:01:50.300> of<00:01:50.600> their<00:01:50.720> farts<00:01:50.960> and<00:01:51.560> you

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
serviceability of their farts and you

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.140 
serviceability of their farts and you
look<00:01:51.860> at<00:01:51.979> the<00:01:52.100> reliability<00:01:52.340> of<00:01:52.760> their<00:01:52.910> pieces

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:53.150 
look at the reliability of their pieces

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.120 
look at the reliability of their pieces
it's<00:01:53.630> that's<00:01:54.229> the<00:01:54.350> right<00:01:54.500> thing<00:01:54.530> to<00:01:54.710> do

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
it's that's the right thing to do

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:56.320 
it's that's the right thing to do

that's<00:02:53.720> you<00:02:54.650> know<00:02:54.739> that's<00:02:54.890> a<00:02:55.070> godsend<00:02:55.519> I<00:02:55.730> mean

that's you know that's a godsend I mean
I<00:02:55.940> think<00:02:56.239> that<00:02:56.470> itself<00:02:57.470> gives<00:02:58.160> a<00:02:58.280> lot<00:02:58.519> of

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
I think that itself gives a lot of

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.640 
I think that itself gives a lot of
people<00:02:58.970> including<00:02:59.390> myself<00:02:59.510> confidence<00:03:00.320> to<00:03:00.500> go

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
people including myself confidence to go

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.270 
people including myself confidence to go
and<00:03:00.860> vote<00:03:01.250> where<00:03:01.459> you<00:03:01.519> otherwise<00:03:01.730> you<00:03:01.880> may<00:03:02.209> not

and vote where you otherwise you may not
the<00:03:04.280> other<00:03:04.430> benefit<00:03:04.910> is<00:03:05.090> the<00:03:05.209> size<00:03:05.450> you<00:03:05.840> all<00:03:06.110> of

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
the other benefit is the size you all of

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.780 
the other benefit is the size you all of
a<00:03:06.230> sudden<00:03:06.500> now<00:03:06.650> have<00:03:06.890> the<00:03:07.040> room<00:03:07.340> that<00:03:07.700> you

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
never had before because the engines are

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.199 
never had before because the engines are
smaller<00:03:09.650> the<00:03:09.860> engines<00:03:10.160> moves<00:03:10.400> ass<00:03:10.640> you<00:03:10.910> end<00:03:11.060> up

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
smaller the engines moves ass you end up

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:12.460 
smaller the engines moves ass you end up
with<00:03:11.329> space<00:03:11.570> in<00:03:11.780> the<00:03:11.870> boat<00:03:12.049> that<00:03:12.170> you<00:03:12.230> never
