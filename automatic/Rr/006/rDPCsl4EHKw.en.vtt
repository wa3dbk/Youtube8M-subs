00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:41.050 
little oil but that's that's expected

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:43.950

so I'm will fire it up I haven't have it

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:44.950 
so I'm will fire it up I haven't have it
started<00:03:19.410> it<00:03:19.530> today<00:03:26.480> we'll<00:03:27.480> see<00:03:27.690> how<00:03:27.810> she<00:03:27.870> runs

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:44.960 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:05:20.030 

yeah<00:03:47.060> stay

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:20.040 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:28.440 

it's<00:05:21.040> definitely<00:05:21.190> burning<00:05:21.670> some<00:05:21.850> more<00:05:27.450> the

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:28.450 
it's definitely burning some more the

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:40.560 
it's definitely burning some more the
coolest<00:05:28.840> parts<00:05:29.110> about<00:05:29.200> the<00:05:29.500> truck<00:05:29.800> right<00:05:30.130> here

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:40.570

as<00:05:41.570> you<00:05:41.750> can<00:05:41.900> see<00:05:42.139> oil<00:05:43.150> pressure<00:05:44.150> is<00:05:44.360> not<00:05:44.570> that

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:44.810 
as you can see oil pressure is not that

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:48.400 
as you can see oil pressure is not that
good<00:05:45.070> it<00:05:46.070> used<00:05:46.280> to<00:05:46.430> be<00:05:46.610> like<00:05:46.639> all<00:05:47.300> the<00:05:48.050> way<00:05:48.199> up

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:48.410

good it used to be like all the way up
here<00:05:48.440> oh<00:05:49.900> it's<00:05:50.900> over<00:05:51.080> here

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:51.910 
here oh it's over here

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:54.430 
here oh it's over here
sometimes<00:05:52.910> it'll<00:05:53.150> be<00:05:53.300> about<00:05:53.720> right<00:05:54.050> there<00:05:54.229> but

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:54.440 
sometimes it'll be about right there but

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:55.260

you<00:05:55.720> see<00:05:55.870> if<00:05:55.990> I<00:05:56.050> can<00:05:56.169> get<00:05:56.289> it<00:05:56.380> to<00:05:56.470> go<00:05:56.590> up<00:05:56.680> over

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:11.880 

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:14.000 

temperature<00:06:12.690> sits<00:06:12.930> pretty<00:06:13.110> good<00:06:13.410> on<00:06:13.530> just

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:14.010 
temperature sits pretty good on just

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:19.310 
temperature sits pretty good on just
usually<00:06:14.970> never<00:06:15.150> really<00:06:15.480> past<00:06:15.720> this<00:06:15.930> line<00:06:18.320> I'm

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:19.320
