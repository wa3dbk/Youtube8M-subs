go for a toxic and miss so things aren't

go for a toxic and miss so things aren't
looking<00:02:22.830> too<00:02:23.070> bad<00:02:23.520> I<00:02:23.880> suppose<00:02:24.450> right<00:02:24.720> he<00:02:24.840> goes

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
looking too bad I suppose right he goes

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:26.840 
looking too bad I suppose right he goes
from<00:02:25.170> protected<00:02:25.650> he<00:02:25.710> gets<00:02:25.890> HP<00:02:26.310> back<00:02:26.580> and<00:02:26.790> i

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
from protected he gets HP back and i

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.180 
from protected he gets HP back and i
seed<00:02:27.450> bond<00:02:27.690> know<00:02:28.230> that<00:02:28.470> they<00:02:28.560> could<00:02:28.980> score

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
seed bond know that they could score

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.600 
seed bond know that they could score
easily<00:02:29.280> carry<00:02:29.550> protect<00:02:29.910> but<00:02:30.180> i<00:02:30.560> guess

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
easily carry protect but i guess

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.590 
easily carry protect but i guess
Skarmory<00:02:32.610> just<00:02:32.790> walls<00:02:33.000> of<00:02:33.180> thing<00:02:33.360> completely

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
Skarmory just walls of thing completely

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.720 
Skarmory just walls of thing completely
i<00:02:33.690> guess<00:02:33.900> all<00:02:34.170> right<00:02:34.320> so<00:02:34.860> he<00:02:34.920> goes<00:02:35.010> for<00:02:35.250> toxic

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
i guess all right so he goes for toxic

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.550 
i guess all right so he goes for toxic
and<00:02:35.970> gets<00:02:36.630> me<00:02:36.780> talks<00:02:37.020> commence<00:02:37.320> worry<00:02:37.440> about
