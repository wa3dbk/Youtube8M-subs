 EISER the ecca here she speaking in 

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:17.440
 recipe and all welcome to one more 

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:19.869
 video and as it was by the title of the 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:22.630
 video is known what the video is about 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:25.450
 today should be coming in a play line 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:28.539
 the black ops two maybe do not know how 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:29.980
 but if you still choose gameplay but will 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:32.680
 stay in the background and even just to not 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.539
 getting a screen is black I'd like 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.210
 to say that you would like to thank 

00:00:34.539 --> 00:00:38.800
 yesterday I was able to complete a brand 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.380
 here for me is an impressive brand 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.820
 of 500 thousand views 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:46.899
 not counting all the videos that already 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:48.880
 I did until now it's porn to think and a half. 

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:51.130
 million visualization is a lot 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:53.320
 face much more nor even reach that number 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.520
 so I just have to thank you 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.230
 to all of you 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.000
 and something else that I did not know 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.129
 that I could not become a writer 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.860
 changed I was a little lost do not know 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:04.930
 where to research this where you see it is that 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.789
 three months ago I completed two 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.170
 years of channel so I wanted to do 

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:10.539
 something but really went through 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.590
 I did not even know I do not know where 

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:12.840
 of today is giving a researched 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.969
 affirmed 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.460
 A mess on youtube, I just saw that it is 

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:18.210
 in the month four times I felt nothing more 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.280
 huh 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.109
 so here they spend more for two years 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.990
 the channel has a lot of expensive not 

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:27.329
 he had imagined that he would donate two 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.340
 years ago there is no doing the 

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:31.860
 video of commemoration of the two years in 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.630
 concacaf position making a video as is 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.729
 what is this and today I know how it is 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.640
 this every two years making the video does 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.109
 more than six months I've been doing 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.250
 five times a week from Monday to 

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:44.399
 friday 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.929
 and I just have to thank you and that's what 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.170
 I'm really happy to get to that 

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:48.170
 brand 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.259
 I think it will be cool if I died 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:59.729
 while recording an audio right 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:02.939
 but not this time at last I know 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.979
 Many will think of mine I was going to stay 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:08.659
 making no video really has a face 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.659
 which does much more visualization than I 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:15.980
 I always try to think like that 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:21.020
 in my specific case and not really 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:24.350
 did not imagine arriving and completing 500 thousand 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:27.860
 views of fact doing 270 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:29.630
 completing the 270 days is a lot of video that 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.000
 take a look at the old videos for tv 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.350
 as it is coarser to get by 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.510
 incredible as it seems I could do 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:37.040
 video rougher than I do today 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.690
 take a look there we'll see there already 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.240

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:45.200
