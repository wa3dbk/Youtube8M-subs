beginning<00:02:08.539> saying<00:02:09.080> that<00:02:09.259> a<00:02:09.289> lot<00:02:09.590> of<00:02:09.619> the

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:09.739 
beginning saying that a lot of the

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:12.180 
beginning saying that a lot of the
content<00:02:10.099> is<00:02:10.280> in<00:02:10.310> 2d<00:02:10.789> it's<00:02:11.090> all<00:02:11.269> of<00:02:11.390> it<00:02:11.510> isn't<00:02:11.780> 3d

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
content is in 2d it's all of it isn't 3d

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.979 
content is in 2d it's all of it isn't 3d
that's<00:02:13.190> just<00:02:13.430> the<00:02:13.519> way<00:02:13.640> it<00:02:13.760> was<00:02:13.880> shot<00:02:13.910> I<00:02:14.330> guess

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:22.720 

so<00:02:17.989> there's<00:02:18.470> the<00:02:18.730> blu-ray<00:02:19.730> 3d<00:02:21.400> then<00:02:22.400> there's

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
so there's the blu-ray 3d then there's

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:29.170 
so there's the blu-ray 3d then there's
the<00:02:24.220> regular<00:02:25.220> blu-ray<00:02:26.620> yeah<00:02:28.030> this<00:02:29.030> is

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
the regular blu-ray yeah this is

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:34.650 
the regular blu-ray yeah this is
difficult<00:02:29.720> to<00:02:29.930> get<00:02:30.110> out<00:02:31.750> jeez

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
difficult to get out jeez

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.550 
difficult to get out jeez
so<00:02:35.660> that's<00:02:35.840> the<00:02:36.069> regular<00:02:37.069> blu-ray<00:02:38.560> drawn

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
so that's the regular blu-ray drawn

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:45.360 
so that's the regular blu-ray drawn
classic<00:02:40.750> which<00:02:41.750> I<00:02:41.900> already<00:02:42.049> have<00:02:42.549> the<00:02:44.170> was<00:02:45.170> it

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
classic which I already have the was it

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.650 
classic which I already have the was it
25th<00:02:46.370> anniversary<00:02:47.000> or<00:02:47.180> something<00:02:47.299> or

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
25th anniversary or something or

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
something anniversary Tron it was nice

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:56.699 
something anniversary Tron it was nice
to<00:02:51.320> have<00:02:51.470> oh<00:02:53.620> I<00:02:54.620> think<00:02:54.769> that<00:02:54.980> wasn't<00:02:55.220> blu-ray

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
to have oh I think that wasn't blu-ray

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:02.930 
to have oh I think that wasn't blu-ray
and<00:02:57.709> then<00:02:57.890> here's<00:02:58.100> a<00:02:58.160> Tron<00:02:58.730> Legacy

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:08.120 

on<00:03:03.750> DVD<00:03:05.990> why<00:03:06.990> they<00:03:07.350> would<00:03:07.500> have<00:03:07.620> this<00:03:07.740> on<00:03:07.950> there

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
on DVD why they would have this on there

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.410 
on DVD why they would have this on there
I<00:03:08.160> don't<00:03:08.550> know

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:16.640 

so<00:03:12.420> that's<00:03:13.410> drawn<00:03:14.130> on<00:03:14.730> regular<00:03:15.060> DVD<00:03:15.450> and<00:03:15.750> then

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650
