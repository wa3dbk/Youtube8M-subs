00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:07.240
 What is the difference between our contributions and contributions from competitors? 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:10.260
 the answer is simple 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.280
 quality, diligence and affordable price 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.740
 When buying a fireplace, it is worth paying attention to the following details 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:20.480
 height of the smoke pipe 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.320
 the material from which the water jacket is made 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:24.620
 damper 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:26.780
 the number of smoke tubes 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.780
 it is important that the fireplace has a high flue 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.020
 which can contain fumes 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.480
 before the chimney becomes properly strong 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.880
 the jacket of the inserts is made of boiler steel, 4 mm thick 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.720
 during operation, the fireplace is exposed to high temperatures 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.460
 therefore, cartridges with thinner walls made of other materials 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:54.320
 they are not able to guarantee continuous operation without emergency work 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.980
 chimney, which in our fireplace is built in the standard 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.340
 allows you to adjust the chimney draft 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.760
 it affects the burning rate, or the economics of the contribution 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.600
 burning in a fireplace without a window is ineffective and increases the cost of smoking 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:18.160
 flames are located in the flue of the fireplace, they fulfill similar functions as the deflector in the air cartridges 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:23.080
 flames flow around the flames that take away the remaining heat 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.520
 the fireplace power depends to a large extent on the number of fireplaces 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.520
 thus, a contribution of the same dimensions, but having a larger number of flames will have 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.620
 more power and efficiency 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.380
 our cartridges are equipped with aesthetic handles 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:40.140
 knobs 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.120
 they have a clean glass system 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.300
 additionally, decorative strips can be mounted 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.220
 the fireplace is equipped with a so-called safe handle 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.600
 in addition, you can mount the GLASS system in it 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.300
 additional glass with an aesthetic finish 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.580
 which reduces the risk of burns 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:06.360
 for more demanding customers, our company offers a number of additional options such as 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.060
 intake 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:13.960
 the intake of cold air from the outside of the building, taking no air from the rooms in which the refill works 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.360
 in combination with the microprocessor controller of the fireplace 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.660
 it optimizes the combustion process and saves up to 30% of wood 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.900
 said microprocessor controller 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:31.980
 it can control the work of two circulating water pumps and any additional device 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.720
 coil or a special copper pipe built into the fireplace 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.580
 which can be used both in the production of hot utility water and 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.840
 serves to protect the fireplace from overheating also in the absence of electricity 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.960
 closing the door 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.080
 ash removal system 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.500
 automatic baffle
