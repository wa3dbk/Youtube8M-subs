00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
while the biggest challenge is the

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:54.050 
while the biggest challenge is the
logistic<00:02:50.700> time<00:02:50.970> and<00:02:51.300> cost<00:02:52.160> in<00:02:53.160> China<00:02:53.459> the<00:02:53.820> cost

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
logistic time and cost in China the cost

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.690 
logistic time and cost in China the cost
the<00:02:54.330> largest<00:02:54.690> cost<00:02:55.050> the<00:02:55.590> our<00:02:55.770> manufacturing

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
the largest cost the our manufacturing

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.210 
the largest cost the our manufacturing
is<00:02:56.760> around<00:02:57.120> 2<00:02:57.360> percent<00:02:57.600> but<00:02:58.260> right<00:02:58.500> now<00:02:58.680> unity

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
is around 2 percent but right now unity

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.610 
is around 2 percent but right now unity
ok<00:02:59.489> it's<00:02:59.580> about<00:02:59.730> eight<00:03:00.090> percent<00:03:00.330> so<00:03:01.170> this<00:03:01.350> is<00:03:01.590> a

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
ok it's about eight percent so this is a

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.979 
ok it's about eight percent so this is a
big<00:03:01.950> issue<00:03:02.190> if<00:03:02.520> we<00:03:02.550> cannot<00:03:03.000> reduce<00:03:03.540> the<00:03:03.570> cost

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
big issue if we cannot reduce the cost

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:07.100 
big issue if we cannot reduce the cost
secondly<00:03:04.800> is<00:03:05.010> the<00:03:05.250> time<00:03:05.489> in<00:03:06.030> China<00:03:06.360> the<00:03:06.900> lead

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
secondly is the time in China the lead

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.229 
secondly is the time in China the lead
time<00:03:07.380> for<00:03:07.410> us<00:03:07.830> for<00:03:08.130> produce<00:03:08.340> for<00:03:08.880> producing
