actually after the next puzzle I'm going
to<00:05:06.110> split<00:05:06.410> this<00:05:06.650> into<00:05:07.400> the<00:05:07.640> next<00:05:07.910> one<00:05:08.090> and

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:09.040 
to split this into the next one and

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.470 
to split this into the next one and
start<00:05:10.040> the<00:05:10.160> next<00:05:10.280> one<00:05:10.430> really<00:05:10.790> quick<00:05:11.000> after<00:05:11.390> it
