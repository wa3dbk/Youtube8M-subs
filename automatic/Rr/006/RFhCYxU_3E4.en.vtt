00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:14.529
 Hello everyone today, I'll show you how 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:17.950
 make a flower of ribbon 

00:00:14.529 --> 00:00:20.860
 width 0 5 to 6 centimeters to 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:22.360
 get a petal or our flower from 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:24.939
 we need to make small tapes 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:27.790
 loop for this cut the ribbon on 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:30.520
 small lengths of 6 centimeters 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:33.270
 apply glue to one edge and glue 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.270
 two ends together 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.600
 I will stick a flower on such 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:47.109
 clip I cut out two circles of felt 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.850
 one circle with a diameter of 4 centimeters 2 on 

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:54.120
 few millimeters less 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:54.120
 I put thermo glue on a bigger club 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:06.310
 open hairpin and stick lifted 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:10.350
 now the storm and our wedge on small 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.350
 circle completely 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.710
 and 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:21.840
 sticking on top 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:34.710
 so the base is ready the petals too now 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.710
 circle the petals on the base 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:16.570
 petals are glued next to each other and 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:19.130
 I went on 1 row 14 petals 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:21.650
 the next row we will glue between 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:24.790
 petals of the first row on a few 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.790
 millimeters below 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.640
 I also went to the second row 14 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.580
 petals 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:07.160
 next we go down again by a few 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:10.000
 millimeters below and glue the petals 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.000
 next to each other 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:33.020
 On the third row I glued 9 years with 4 rows 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.930
 we will stick between the petals 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:38.560
 previous row and we also get 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.560
 9 petals 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:13.460
 fifth row we'll stick again 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:16.630
 petals are next to me 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:16.630
 got 7 petals 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:53.430
 so we stuck 5 rows I think of that 

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:56.129
 will be sufficient 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:57.439
 further to finish the flower we need 

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:59.999
 make a middle 

00:04:57.439 --> 00:05:02.939
 the middle for this flower can be done 

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:06.060
 in two ways the first way is to take 

00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:08.779
 some beautiful strazik here is an example 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:12.120
 I have such a flower here and 

00:05:08.779 --> 00:05:14.520
 stick in the center of the flower principle 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:16.229
 there is nothing complicated here and if you 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:18.930
 want you can do it 

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:21.539
 alone in this flower I want 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:23.580
 do the second way and for the second 

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:29.250
 Ways I need such ones 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:31.879
 stamens I took them 8 pieces and glued 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:31.879
 them in half 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:48.590
 then I need a few more here 

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:52.539
 There are such petals and we will 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:52.539
 stick already in the aura stamens 

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:34.520
 I got this middle 

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:36.650
 I stabbed petals around the stamens 

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:39.800
 several rows on my first row 

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:43.039
 went three petals on 2 row 5 petals 

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:44.900
 and on the third row of 8 petals stuck 

00:06:43.039 --> 00:06:46.659
 I just like them next to each other 

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:49.099
 it turned out and glued 

00:06:46.659 --> 00:06:52.189
 further I want from the back 

00:06:49.099 --> 00:07:02.900
 shorten the leg to color to it 

00:06:52.189 --> 00:07:04.940
 too high and now glue in 

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:07.909
 the middle in the center of the flower 

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:09.740
 that's all as you see , depending on 

00:07:07.909 --> 00:07:10.819
 midway flower looks absolutely 

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:13.009
 differently 

00:07:10.819 --> 00:07:15.680
 the first option is very ordinary 

00:07:13.009 --> 00:07:18.259
 simpotichny floret and the second option 

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:20.449
 this lush flower looks more like a bow 

00:07:18.259 --> 00:07:22.580
 write me in the comments what 

00:07:20.449 --> 00:07:24.650
 you will like the flower version 

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:26.210
 very interesting to read your opinion 

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:28.789
 now let's see how he is 

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:31.189
 looks on the head and see you already with 

00:07:28.789 --> 00:07:33.400
 you in the next video all good luck everyone 

00:07:31.189 --> 00:07:33.400
 until
