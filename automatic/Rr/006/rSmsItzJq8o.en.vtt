00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:23.140
 episode 545 how to decorate a mirror to 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.140
 your school or school klaus 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:33.430
 materials box of cereal cans of 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:36.640
 refreshment mirror for pencil locker 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:39.670
 glue and scissors optional elements 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.890
 decorative here we have a mirror 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:45.100
 local that comes with a magnet in the part 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:47.140
 from behind if they do not have the mirror of what 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.839
 that can also take a mirror 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:52.390
 regular and put a magnet on the part of 

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:55.480
 back here we have a box of cereal and 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:01:00.129
 what I 'm going to do is draw a frame 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:05.050
 around my mirror here so 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:07.570
 can decorate the frame 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:10.630
 and as you can see I left a little bit of 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:13.300
 space between the mirror what is going to 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.610
 see from the mirror and the frame is the space 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.950
 little one that you can see here that is a 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:21.150
 fine edge so that when 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:25.210
 put my mirror then the edge is 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:27.640
 over the mirror and thus sticking now 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:30.400
 what I'm going to do is cut out the cardboard 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.650
 I have here 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:35.800
 and we are going to use the front 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.600
 of the cardboard to make the decoration 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:42.630
 I'm cutting in on the inside 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.630
 of the mirror as you can see here 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.790
 this craft can also do it 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.729
 with adhesive tape to give it a touch 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.740
 different or with foami if they wish 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:57.170
 they can also do it with paper 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:59.640
 gift or with marbles or with also 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:03.300
 different decorative elements like 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:06.840
 plastic gems I'm just giving 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:09.030
 a touch of recycling here in the mirror and 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.130
 I'm going to show you in another video how 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:15.160
 they can do the same 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:17.590
 mirror with different decorations I've 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:21.220
 put some glue on the edge 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:23.830
 so that the mirror is stuck to the 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:26.060
 frame and here then what I'm going to do 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.930
 is to start decorating 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:33.080
 as you can see here the magnet and the mirror 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:35.180
 and everything is ready to start 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:38.590
 decorate and what we are going to do to 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.590
 decorate is to use 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:45.489
 cans recycled cans and cans that I 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:47.530
 I have previously washed then what 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:51.400
 I'm going to do with the cans is cut them 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:53.760
 in small pieces in bits like 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:58.810
 squares and I have already opened a 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:03:00.819
 hole using this tool that 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.400
 they can do it at home using a 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:06.549
 knife and what I'm going to do is take 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:09.370
 my scissors are scissors 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:12.340
 very large as you can see and has already 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:14.799
 cut the whole bit here now I'm going 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:18.250
 to start sticking along the frame 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:20.409
 from the mirror I'm going to take my glue 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:25.540
 again I put a little bit of glue 

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:28.359
 and I take a bit of the can in the 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:30.280
 part where the color is due to the can and 

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:33.220
 then I will keep hitting this 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:36.010
 way the other bit by alternating 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:40.270
 colors with cans of different colors 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:43.620
 for example red green yellow 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:46.920
 the decoration is much more 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:50.640
 pretty I only had a can of color 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:52.680
 red and silver here, so 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:55.980
 how can you see the colors that I have 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:58.650
 they are a little more neutral and also 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:02.549
 can use black tin and 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:06.360
 silver or gold color and it would look very 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:08.909
 pretty in the decoration once there 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:12.180
 finished decorating the frame then 

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:16.420
 what we are going to do is put a 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:18.820
 small to a small decoration in the 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:21.820
 corner if they wish they can also 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:24.880
 put a little bag on the bottom 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:27.310
 to put pencils and so here I put a 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.960
 little bit of glue I take my decoration 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:32.410
 of scrapbooking that I have already done 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:35.650
 previously and I'm going to move it up 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:39.160
 get to a part of the mirror that is 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:41.620
 much more in keeping with the mirror here as 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.090
 can see are the cans already stuck 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.920
 they have to be very careful of 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:48.880
 paste them well because if you can not 

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:53.410
 cut and as you see here already here is the 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:55.210
 finished mirror and that's all it's a 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:57.760
 simple craft is a 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:59.350
 recycled craft does not need 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:02.110
 put the flower as I said earlier 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:03.940
 that's optional I hope you do this 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:06.970
 craft at home and see you at the 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:11.230
