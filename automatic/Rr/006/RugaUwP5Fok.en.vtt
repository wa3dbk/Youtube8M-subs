models that are advertising them but I

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:13.140 
models that are advertising them but I
think<00:03:10.750> it<00:03:11.230> actually<00:03:11.380> does<00:03:11.620> wonders<00:03:12.400> for<00:03:12.730> the

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
think it actually does wonders for the

think it actually does wonders for the
muscles<00:03:13.959> the<00:03:14.139> chest<00:03:14.410> the<00:03:14.650> back<00:03:14.859> even<00:03:15.400> your

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
muscles the chest the back even your

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.140 
muscles the chest the back even your
abdomen<00:03:16.120> and<00:03:16.510> I<00:03:16.900> noticed<00:03:17.290> a<00:03:17.410> little<00:03:17.650> bit<00:03:17.859> of

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
abdomen and I noticed a little bit of

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.089 
abdomen and I noticed a little bit of
even<00:03:19.150> a<00:03:19.239> little<00:03:19.599> bit<00:03:19.780> of<00:03:20.019> strength<00:03:20.530> of<00:03:20.709> my<00:03:20.829> legs

00:03:21.089 --> 00:03:21.099 
even a little bit of strength of my legs

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:22.620 
even a little bit of strength of my legs

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
because whenever you do two pull-ups

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.770 
because whenever you do two pull-ups
your<00:03:23.440> legs<00:03:23.769> after<00:03:24.700> you<00:03:25.120> got<00:03:25.299> to<00:03:25.389> kind<00:03:25.569> of<00:03:25.599> hold
