we<00:00:09.150> were<00:00:09.240> looking<00:00:09.510> for<00:00:09.719> something<00:00:09.870> that<00:00:10.320> was

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
we were looking for something that was

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.560 
we were looking for something that was
the<00:00:10.530> next<00:00:10.769> generation<00:00:11.340> something<00:00:12.179> that<00:00:12.389> would

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
the next generation something that would

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.289 
the next generation something that would
allow<00:00:12.809> us<00:00:13.049> to<00:00:13.259> grow<00:00:13.500> even<00:00:13.830> further<00:00:14.160> and<00:00:15.030> more

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
allow us to grow even further and more

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.689 
allow us to grow even further and more
enhancements<00:00:16.289> in<00:00:16.590> it<00:00:16.740> than<00:00:16.949> the<00:00:17.250> analog

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
enhancements in it than the analog

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.900 
enhancements in it than the analog
allowed<00:00:18.359> our<00:00:19.109> previous<00:00:19.619> analog<00:00:20.130> system<00:00:20.670> there

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
allowed our previous analog system there

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.800 
allowed our previous analog system there
was<00:00:21.060> a<00:00:21.090> lot<00:00:21.390> of<00:00:21.420> background<00:00:21.750> noise<00:00:23.150> the<00:00:24.150> analog

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
was a lot of background noise the analog

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.859 
was a lot of background noise the analog
system<00:00:25.350> could<00:00:26.340> take<00:00:26.609> a<00:00:26.640> period<00:00:27.150> of<00:00:27.210> time<00:00:27.480> a

the closest tower there was a lot of

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.910 
the closest tower there was a lot of
dead<00:00:34.200> spots<00:00:34.530> and<00:00:34.920> a<00:00:35.610> lot<00:00:35.790> of<00:00:35.820> lost<00:00:36.440> calls<00:00:37.440> to<00:00:37.800> me
