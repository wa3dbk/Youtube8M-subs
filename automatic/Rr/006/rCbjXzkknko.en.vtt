00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:12.820
 Hi, I'm going to show you an idea of ​​makeup. 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:15.160
 for the night with a faded 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.289
 lipstick wine that I love and now that the 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.870
 Cold is coming, I do not know. 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:22.750
 It's kind of not, but we see who 

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:25.300
 I would say it could be an interesting idea 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.340
 I already did the skin after the police 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:31.930
 the end of the video and then I go 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:34.300
 then start by passing a basic shadow 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:37.030
 this is a basic brown that is the 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:42.550
 exams cycle of band I'll pass 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:46.350
 not in the whole eye that is to create the 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:51.070
 base of human effort 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:54.040
 Then I'll make a dash with the pencil. 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:01:02.290
 to fade after is a half pencil 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:01:07.749
 wine paraná with button and there it goes 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:09.399
 I'm going straight not to be dry. 

00:01:07.749 --> 00:01:13.179

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:33.420
 shadow 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:43.550
 Then I'll get a shadow that is this. 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:48.610
 the palette of the molds of who it is 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:53.510
 which is kind a gray so silver and I go 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:02:03.369

00:01:53.510 --> 00:02:07.460
 concave is coming right over here so 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:10.580

 the bonus is another oil 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:53.330
 now is the boring time that has to stay 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:56.990
 the two identical cats can take too long 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:03:00.040

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:03.260
 another was less and the execution that 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:10.930
 refining and there also helps to have a 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:17.950
 brush pradal do here addresses the mix of 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:27.790

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:49.310
 whole face 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:52.780

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:52.780
 if you go with the brush
