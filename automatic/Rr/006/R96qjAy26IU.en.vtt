00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:07.490
 a few months ago I had to undergo a 

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:10.849
 delicate surgical intervention 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:12.709
 in very difficult times I had the honor 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:14.719
 of receiving from the most excellent lord 

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:17.540
 president of the republic commander 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:20.990
 Hugo Chávez chills a warm message from 

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:23.900
 noble and generous breath that I appreciated 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:27.439
 deeply today I have to correspond 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:30.080
 the message by publicly expressing 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:31.820
 Excellency Mr. President on behalf 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.559
 of all the young people and children that 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.769

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:39.559
 teacher gustavo dudamel's coral and in 

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:41.960
 my own the feeling of our 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:45.379
 prayer and our vows for your prompt 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:49.010
 recovery in the name of good god 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:51.710
 of course the best wishes so that 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:54.790
 and the best energies we can 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:57.939
 express to the president that 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:01:00.500
 He has evidently been a tutor 

00:00:57.939 --> 00:01:02.720
 wonderful the orchestra has given 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.990
 all your support 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:08.630
 and really sincere support, because here 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.280
 We were like I told you before, I think 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.799
 what a year and a half when we inaugurated 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.180
 straits this center and it was not only 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:18.040
 the inauguration of the center 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:21.050
 but he expressed the immediate idea of 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:23.870
 deconstruct and not only have it in 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:26.390
 caracas but take it to other 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:29.560
 regions of the country fill the country with 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:33.500
 wonderful and worthy spaces for 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:35.960
 all young people and children well that's how it is 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:39.550
 because it is not there is not that there is not another 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:42.220
 thing but really our our 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:46.940
 our message of early recovery 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:50.420
 of the energy improvement the music is a 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:54.080
 energy is a very particular art because 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:56.869
 it looks subjectively but objectively 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.880
 what we feel and what we hear is 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:02.869
 a region really energy that goes to 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.460
 soul and good here we are all be 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:07.460

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:10.700
 Abreu of wishing the president a 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:13.160
 question recovery and how good that 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:16.610
 here we continue because we have to build 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.910
 this country all together and good to do 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.140

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:24.950

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.720
