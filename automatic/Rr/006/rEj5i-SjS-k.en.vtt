00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.060
 everyone is worth here bruce what was going to 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.160
 bring today that was 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.040
 the configuration that I have them lol 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.410
 so you can upload more fps look 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.030
 30 to 100 charges and there are people who are 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.100
 is always permanent in the same 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.940
 number but good there is a configuration 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:23.550
 good a button that we say gives it and 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:26.599
 let's say the screen moves a bit 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.970
 faster and does so a little faster 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:31.949
 but it does have marked 13 say 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.870
 it does not move so fast for you 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.490
 control more rap to control 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:41.070
 better let's say the screen and so what 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:44.580
 what takes away in return are the fps 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:48.120
 but good good here I for example 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:49.980
 I have a quick release so I do not 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.650
 I have to mark it, that is, there are people who 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.020
 give here and me but and click left 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:58.190
 me not me directly without clicking anything 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.710
 it stops the skill is put 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.090
 so, better I be, I presented the 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.040
 I have number 7 that each one as 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:07.700
 want 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:10.040
 It's worth here according to the screen 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:13.010
 resolutions to record I have it like that 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.650
 no edges good shadows 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.300
 shadows remove them is not not the same is what 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.850
 same is the same thing that only goes to you 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:22.070
 eating is going to be the fps sure is that you 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:25.990
 will eat the fps something else does not have to 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:28.570
 shadow is worth nothing is that it is worth nothing 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.610
 you have to let it go to for example this 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:34.119
 leave it as is 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:36.490
 medium is also low and medium so that 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:41.170
 you see also the domain and all those 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:43.869
 things look normal then 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.730
 savage and look at the minimum it looks good 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:48.240
 etc 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:51.420
 good 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.460
 here 80 fps what happens if I put it to 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.040
 more for example I can call but 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.710
 now I put it to 150 170 but when I 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.170
 I want to move to the best when I move 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:04.320
 very fast or I'm fighting sometimes 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.100
 let's say I'm missing for one side or 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.860
 as yes 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.990
 how to apply it as if I'm here and from 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.030
 suddenly when electric here you see 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:16.030
 shadow and it gets now it's not me 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:21.250
 happening but it happened to me now I do not know but 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:24.310
 it happened to me that I recommend it according to 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:26.490
 the graphics card would put it 80 and it's going 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.540
 rising little by little 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:32.700
 I leave it better 80 I like it much more 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.680
 here it's not going to go up so much the fps do not 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:38.280
 can give you so many pulls because you 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:41.360
 can give jerks and well that's the volume 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:44.070
 ok here is according to the scale that is 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:47.260
 this 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:49.330
 from here and what I'm atypical about 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.700
 example, I think you show me all the 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:56.260
 I experience the damage I make 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:57.730
 the typical all good level of here is already 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:02.590
 according to each one to whom to touch 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:05.290
 nothing here attentive this European is where 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:08.800
 comes the issue of the fps to earn more 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:12.100
 fps you will almost certainly have this 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.410
 activated box is worth this you can 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.840
 leave it 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:18.900
 ok you can leave it because to be able 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.850
 move this for the attack boot to 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.040
 move and move the camera when they are 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:26.910
 dead but this is free we activate it 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:30.450
 Now look, we activate and it does not go up so much 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:33.150
 I do not get to 100, it does not come to me 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:35.040
 online game does not arrive because I'm 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:40.380
 playing against you in normal games 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:43.880
 he will not get there he does not remove this because 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.880
 there's a lot better 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:46.940
 and this is 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.710
 OK 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:58.390
 so that it moves if I do not want to leave it 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:04:02.300
 so this is worth we leave it like this and so 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:07.940
 much better you remove the box is 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:11.840
 the one that will take you away and perfect and this 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:13.970
 it is already this it takes away that it is nonsense if 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.579
 I have enabled will not serve 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:20.180
 nothing and good 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:22.610
 then we remove it and it will improve and 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:25.520
 also what also improves with the 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:27.500
 true fps are this this external 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.840
 touch it because we're going away from all these 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:32.660
 four moves is without you catch 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:37.550
 you put this it takes it and medium that is 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:40.160
 perfect the low is low and medium and the 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:43.760
 here in the shadow you remove it and you will see 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:46.190
 it is almost certain if not if it does not come out that has 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:47.750
 uploaded tell me in the comments and I 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:50.030
 I am going to answer today I am going to help you 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:52.370
 sky or by any other place of 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:54.590
 contact and I will tell you how to improve it 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:57.740
 almost sure if you always go to the same 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:59.720
 can make it increase almost certainly 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.400
 it's not from youtube that also goes up 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:03.590
 video also says and 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.569
 they were a lot going up from 20 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:07.340
 when I was recording now what happens 

00:05:05.569 --> 00:05:08.240
 that I am in fact cooperative with 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:09.530
 the bots 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:13.009
 well then it does not show but when 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:15.410
 is playing my friend was going 20 fps 20 

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:17.479
 but I put a configuration 

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:20.210
 almost equal to mine because according to the 

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:23.060
 graphics card and there my friend now 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:25.849
 it goes to 60 to 70, so it was better that way 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:27.560
 that it's worth it if they had a problem what 

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:29.630
 leave in the comments 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:32.300
 I will answer it I will try to help or as 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:34.729
 improve fps for me say it is 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:37.250
 in trujillo in quotes because not a 

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:39.159
 game but in a configuration and good 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:41.960
 I have already worked two as promised 

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:44.630
 videos and good morning let's hope that 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:46.610
