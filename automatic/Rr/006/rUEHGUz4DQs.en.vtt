00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.670
 I go 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.629
 all right 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.950
 no no 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.510
 and good friends hundreds welcome to what 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.850
 that would be the last one we are when 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:24.590
 now yes the part of the nights 5 already 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.630
 we are ending in fact I had to 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.820
 advance a little until this part that 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.200
 we can play well and have my apology 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:34.280
 for not uploading some videos 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.240
 Quickly allows cameras throughout 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.770
 moment we have not had big 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.470
 difficulties although we have seen that 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.850
 we have moved a lot this good about 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.340
 I would like to give you all a request 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.080
 sorry, you know that's how I am, I hope 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.880
 What I studied was that an illness 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.399
 very seriously ill above all of what 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.750
 that was this all and all that was not 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:53.560
 almost around what was the day 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.560
 Monday martinez 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:02.380
 then I had this sick I could not even 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:05.119
 talk could not record then that's why 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.220
 imagine if these movements because if 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:08.899
 let's see if we need to save 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.429
 energy because if not we will not get 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.050
 not even the psychologist is already four 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:14.030
 in the morning 27 percent energy 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.830
 we're almost alive and I told them I had to 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.930
 advance it so that the 12 17 started to 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.160
 put all night full since you 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.110
 we had seen in the previous gameplay 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.910
 then well let's close the door 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.990
 let's check a little light and let's 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:31.070
 go see because it actually offers 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:32.840
 and madrid boxing we are going to open line and fox 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:36.500
 and you're going to knock on the door action now 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.850
 let's check ok if I do not think it's going to 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.840
 be until you check the camera so 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:45.230
 we tried to check the running 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:47.390
 we take camera is fox and playing but 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.550
 Freddy is already on this side and that's what 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:52.130
 that worries me because it's a big 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:54.050
 problem so let's stop what we're going 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.280
 to check let's say it 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.260
 I will be checking the door of this 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.000
 side and I'll be checking mid is that 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.620
 frei is already here is already there 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.480

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.480

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.710
 let's go let's go 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.520
 I do not know what we do what we do know 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:24.320
 little energy left 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:27.410

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:30.410
 open better left closed and 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:31.580
 that we are not going to check anymore 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.110
 explain the thing I can not even 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.420
 finish it as I tell you I 'm 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:37.700
 sick about three days then I did not want 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.440
 upload anything until after I went this 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.330
 I'm seeing what my disease is 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.400
 so it's already five o'clock in the morning 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:45.170
 we are currently carrying out with 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.300
 this so that you can see what 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:48.860
 is this in some videos we are going to 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:50.060
 make other videos again 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.280
 problem is that if I get sick I can not 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.930
 talk about how they have to also 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.820
 apart from that by test I remember that 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:58.210
 I had been told something about the poster 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:00.920
 the posters I think I 'm going to leave it 

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:03.230
 with a little energy I think so 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:07.060
 already if the yurta fuchsia kills me 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.060
 while he touched the nose to freddy 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:14.600
 we use a little bit for editing 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.600

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:24.840

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:35.170
