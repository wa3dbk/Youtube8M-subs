that way I don't have to adjust the
height<00:02:37.310> it'll<00:02:37.850> automatically<00:02:38.530> determine

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
height it'll automatically determine

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.949 
height it'll automatically determine
that<00:02:39.650> so<00:02:40.640> but<00:02:41.060> there<00:02:41.180> are<00:02:41.239> other<00:02:41.330> options<00:02:41.570> you

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
that so but there are other options you

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:43.870 
that so but there are other options you
can<00:02:42.080> go<00:02:42.230> by<00:02:42.350> percentage<00:02:42.950> and<00:02:43.220> go<00:02:43.280> by<00:02:43.400> inches

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
can go by percentage and go by inches

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.479 
can go by percentage and go by inches
millimeters<00:02:44.600> and<00:02:45.470> those<00:02:45.709> are<00:02:45.860> all<00:02:45.980> under<00:02:46.310> the

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
millimeters and those are all under the

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:51.320 
millimeters and those are all under the
tabs<00:02:46.730> there

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.699 

and<00:02:52.330> you<00:02:53.200> can<00:02:53.380> also<00:02:53.530> choose<00:02:54.010> the<00:02:54.069> resolution

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
and you can also choose the resolution

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:00.479 
and you can also choose the resolution
keep<00:02:56.709> one<00:02:56.890> in<00:02:56.920> 600<00:02:57.790> and<00:02:59.010> then<00:03:00.010> again<00:03:00.310> the

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
keep one in 600 and then again the

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:01.979 
keep one in 600 and then again the
constraint<00:03:01.060> proportions<00:03:01.540> make<00:03:01.720> sure<00:03:01.840> you

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
constraint proportions make sure you

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:04.080 
constraint proportions make sure you
have<00:03:02.140> that<00:03:02.319> check<00:03:02.620> and<00:03:02.860> the<00:03:03.520> program<00:03:03.910> will

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
have that check and the program will

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.220 
have that check and the program will
automatically<00:03:05.459> determine<00:03:06.720> the<00:03:07.720> height<00:03:07.930> or

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
automatically determine the height or

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:09.479 
automatically determine the height or
the<00:03:08.260> width<00:03:08.590> depending<00:03:09.040> on<00:03:09.160> which<00:03:09.280> one<00:03:09.459> you

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
the width depending on which one you

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:13.380 
the width depending on which one you
filled<00:03:09.819> in<00:03:11.310> now<00:03:12.310> you<00:03:12.370> can<00:03:12.610> convert<00:03:12.940> your<00:03:13.120> files
