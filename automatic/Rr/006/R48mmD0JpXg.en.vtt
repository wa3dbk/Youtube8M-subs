 A lot of you are seeing here level 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:45.540
 level 15 which is very very difficult until 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:50.610
 for me it's a little bit like 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:55.010
 architecture kill them but for me to 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:59.579
 I do not care much but it takes the level 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:02.850

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:35.830
 There's only going to be skeleton here. 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:39.190

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:02.230
 advisable you see here do not take the 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:05.320

 Yes, but one. 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:58.509
 one is very difficult to raise neither here nor only 

00:04:55.669 --> 00:05:02.030
 a little bit luckier than the roni 

00:04:58.509 --> 00:05:05.090
