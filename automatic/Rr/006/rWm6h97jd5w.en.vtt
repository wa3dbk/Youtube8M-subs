00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.779 
is my FTP server down here it is a
service<00:00:58.469> so<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.829> computer<00:00:59.250> actually<00:00:59.609> needs

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
service so the computer actually needs

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.639 
service so the computer actually needs
to<00:00:59.850> have<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.300> account<00:01:00.629> logged<00:01:00.870> on<00:01:01.079> before<00:01:01.559> it

using pleases or whatever they want to
do<00:01:10.680> with<00:01:10.860> it<00:01:12.049> so<00:01:13.049> this<00:01:13.409> tutorial<00:01:13.590> is<00:01:13.950> basically

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
do with it so this tutorial is basically

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.320 
do with it so this tutorial is basically
how<00:01:14.729> you<00:01:15.119> can<00:01:15.270> do<00:01:16.040> that<00:01:17.040> particular<00:01:17.909> function

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
how you can do that particular function

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.570 
how you can do that particular function
log<00:01:18.810> on<00:01:18.960> your<00:01:19.110> computer<00:01:19.500> providing<00:01:20.159> service

log on your computer providing service
but<00:01:21.060> still<00:01:21.360> lock<00:01:21.600> it<00:01:21.840> so<00:01:21.990> that<00:01:22.140> nobody<00:01:22.350> can

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
but still lock it so that nobody can

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.649 
but still lock it so that nobody can
visibly<00:01:23.130> go<00:01:23.369> up<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.640> it<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:23.939> actually<00:01:24.390> mess

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
visibly go up to it and actually mess

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.179 
visibly go up to it and actually mess
around<00:01:24.780> with<00:01:24.990> it<00:01:25.400> so<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:28.470> stops<00:01:29.070> that

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
around with it so the the the stops that

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.520 
around with it so the the the stops that
are<00:01:29.310> required<00:01:29.700> for<00:01:29.970> this<00:01:30.060> tutorial<00:01:31.020> is<00:01:31.409> very
