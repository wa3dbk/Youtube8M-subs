movie i'm mr. blue summers so this week
i<00:00:14.360> got<00:00:14.570> a<00:00:14.599> question<00:00:15.049> from<00:00:15.289> a<00:00:15.589> viewer<00:00:15.679> on<00:00:16.219> my

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:16.460 
i got a question from a viewer on my

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.630 
i got a question from a viewer on my
blog<00:00:16.780> asking<00:00:17.780> about<00:00:18.590> a<00:00:18.650> problem<00:00:19.220> that<00:00:19.400> he<00:00:19.520> was

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:19.640 
blog asking about a problem that he was

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.400 
blog asking about a problem that he was
having<00:00:19.820> with<00:00:20.120> some<00:00:20.270> architecture<00:00:20.780> brought<00:00:21.260> in

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:21.410 
having with some architecture brought in

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:24.850 
having with some architecture brought in
from<00:00:21.590> AutoCAD<00:00:22.010> 2009<00:00:22.730> and<00:00:23.290> the<00:00:24.290> problem<00:00:24.590> was

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:24.860 
from AutoCAD 2009 and the problem was

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:26.620 
from AutoCAD 2009 and the problem was
that<00:00:24.890> there<00:00:25.370> were<00:00:25.490> a<00:00:25.520> lot<00:00:25.820> of<00:00:25.850> transforms<00:00:26.510> that

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:26.630 
that there were a lot of transforms that

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.930 
that there were a lot of transforms that
were<00:00:26.720> being<00:00:26.870> applied<00:00:27.230> to<00:00:27.980> that<00:00:28.340> architecture

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:28.940 
were being applied to that architecture

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.810 
were being applied to that architecture
that<00:00:29.090> weren't<00:00:29.330> necessarily<00:00:30.400> being<00:00:31.400> stacked

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:31.820 
that weren't necessarily being stacked

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:33.700 
that weren't necessarily being stacked
up<00:00:32.059> onto<00:00:32.689> the<00:00:32.809> objects<00:00:33.199> and<00:00:33.350> so<00:00:33.440> that<00:00:33.559> caused

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:33.710 
up onto the objects and so that caused

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:34.989 
up onto the objects and so that caused
all<00:00:33.890> kinds<00:00:33.920> of<00:00:34.190> problems<00:00:34.339> if<00:00:34.699> you<00:00:34.760> tried<00:00:34.969> to

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:34.999 
all kinds of problems if you tried to

00:00:34.999 --> 00:00:38.009 
all kinds of problems if you tried to
move<00:00:35.239> things<00:00:35.570> or<00:00:35.839> rotate<00:00:36.230> them<00:00:36.440> or<00:00:36.710> scale<00:00:36.949> them

00:00:38.009 --> 00:00:38.019 
move things or rotate them or scale them

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:40.029 
move things or rotate them or scale them
everything<00:00:39.019> just<00:00:39.140> kind<00:00:39.350> of<00:00:39.409> exploded<00:00:39.769> and

00:00:40.029 --> 00:00:40.039 
everything just kind of exploded and

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:42.939 
everything just kind of exploded and
went<00:00:40.159> everywhere<00:00:40.600> so<00:00:41.600> we<00:00:42.589> resolve<00:00:42.890> the

00:00:42.939 --> 00:00:42.949 
went everywhere so we resolve the

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:44.380 
went everywhere so we resolve the
problem<00:00:43.280> using<00:00:43.460> reset<00:00:43.820> xforms<00:00:44.210> and<00:00:44.359> I

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390 
problem using reset xforms and I

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.180 
problem using reset xforms and I
realized<00:00:44.659> I've<00:00:44.809> never<00:00:44.989> done<00:00:45.260> a<00:00:45.530> full<00:00:45.920> monday

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
realized I've never done a full monday

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.520 
realized I've never done a full monday
will<00:00:46.339> be<00:00:46.429> talking<00:00:46.760> about<00:00:46.819> transforms<00:00:47.510> and<00:00:47.749> how

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 
will be talking about transforms and how

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.189 
will be talking about transforms and how
you<00:00:48.589> can<00:00:48.800> use<00:00:49.420> that<00:00:50.420> modifier<00:00:50.870> to<00:00:51.019> really

00:00:51.189 --> 00:00:51.199 
you can use that modifier to really

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:53.559 
you can use that modifier to really
clean<00:00:51.350> up<00:00:51.499> your<00:00:51.589> geometry<00:00:52.269> so<00:00:53.269> let's<00:00:53.420> take<00:00:53.539> a

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:53.569 
clean up your geometry so let's take a

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:56.439 
clean up your geometry so let's take a
look<00:00:53.749> here<00:00:54.489> I've<00:00:55.489> got<00:00:55.550> an<00:00:55.760> ordinary<00:00:56.089> teapot

00:00:56.439 --> 00:00:56.449 
look here I've got an ordinary teapot

00:00:56.449 --> 00:00:58.540 
look here I've got an ordinary teapot
and<00:00:56.690> there's<00:00:57.530> nothing<00:00:57.739> special<00:00:57.890> about<00:00:58.100> it<00:00:58.280> and

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 
and there's nothing special about it and

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.399 
and there's nothing special about it and
what<00:00:59.449> we're<00:00:59.569> going<00:00:59.600> to<00:00:59.809> do<00:00:59.929> is<00:01:00.050> we're<00:01:00.170> going<00:01:00.289> to

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:00.409 
what we're going to do is we're going to

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:03.819 
what we're going to do is we're going to
apply<00:01:00.649> a<00:01:01.129> transform<00:01:02.170> to<00:01:03.170> this<00:01:03.319> teapot<00:01:03.620> and

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:03.829 
apply a transform to this teapot and

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:04.689 
apply a transform to this teapot and
then<00:01:03.949> i'm<00:01:04.010> going<00:01:04.100> to<00:01:04.159> show<00:01:04.309> you<00:01:04.339> why<00:01:04.549> that's

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
then i'm going to show you why that's

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:07.749 
then i'm going to show you why that's
such<00:01:04.879> a<00:01:04.939> problem<00:01:05.649> so<00:01:06.649> sometimes<00:01:07.490> you<00:01:07.610> get

00:01:07.749 --> 00:01:07.759 
such a problem so sometimes you get

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:09.310 
such a problem so sometimes you get
moved<00:01:08.030> problems<00:01:08.540> sometimes<00:01:08.899> you<00:01:09.200> get

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
moved problems sometimes you get

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.429 
moved problems sometimes you get
rotation<00:01:09.829> problems<00:01:10.219> but<00:01:10.490> scale<00:01:10.909> on<00:01:11.240> a<00:01:11.439> top

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:12.439 
rotation problems but scale on a top

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:15.700 
rotation problems but scale on a top
level<00:01:12.619> is<00:01:12.920> always<00:01:13.509> a<00:01:14.509> transform<00:01:15.380> that's<00:01:15.560> not

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
level is always a transform that's not

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.090 
level is always a transform that's not
stacked<00:01:16.130> so<00:01:16.399> we'll<00:01:16.549> use<00:01:16.579> scale<00:01:17.060> today<00:01:17.299> if<00:01:18.100> i

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
stacked so we'll use scale today if i

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.620 
stacked so we'll use scale today if i
take<00:01:19.250> this<00:01:19.369> teapot<00:01:19.729> and<00:01:19.939> i<00:01:20.030> make<00:01:20.180> it<00:01:20.329> fifty

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
take this teapot and i make it fifty

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.010 
take this teapot and i make it fifty
percent<00:01:20.869> taller<00:01:21.700> right<00:01:22.700> it's<00:01:23.570> an<00:01:23.630> ordinary

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
percent taller right it's an ordinary

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:25.179 
percent taller right it's an ordinary
operation<00:01:24.560> is<00:01:24.649> something<00:01:24.920> you<00:01:24.979> would<00:01:25.039> do

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:25.189 
operation is something you would do

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:27.910 
operation is something you would do
without<00:01:25.340> even<00:01:25.670> thinking<00:01:26.530> what<00:01:27.530> i've<00:01:27.649> done<00:01:27.860> is

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
without even thinking what i've done is

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.310 
without even thinking what i've done is
not<00:01:28.310> modified<00:01:28.640> the<00:01:29.149> actual<00:01:29.570> polygons<00:01:30.109> and

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
not modified the actual polygons and

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.649 
not modified the actual polygons and
vertices<00:01:30.619> within<00:01:31.070> this<00:01:31.159> object<00:01:31.609> but<00:01:32.359> instead

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:32.659 
vertices within this object but instead

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:34.359 
vertices within this object but instead
I've<00:01:32.840> told<00:01:33.020> 3d<00:01:33.350> studio<00:01:33.530> max<00:01:33.920> take<00:01:34.219> the

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:34.369 
I've told 3d studio max take the

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:35.859 
I've told 3d studio max take the
original<00:01:34.759> teapot<00:01:35.119> and<00:01:35.270> make<00:01:35.420> it<00:01:35.539> fifty

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869 
original teapot and make it fifty

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:38.889 
original teapot and make it fifty
percent<00:01:36.109> taller<00:01:37.149> this<00:01:38.149> becomes<00:01:38.539> a<00:01:38.659> problem

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:38.899 
percent taller this becomes a problem

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:41.800 
percent taller this becomes a problem
when<00:01:39.439> you<00:01:39.979> start<00:01:40.340> making<00:01:40.880> changes<00:01:41.240> to<00:01:41.570> the

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
when you start making changes to the

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.580 
when you start making changes to the
pivot<00:01:42.079> of<00:01:42.200> the<00:01:42.920> object<00:01:44.049> so<00:01:45.049> let<00:01:45.259> me<00:01:45.350> show<00:01:45.500> you

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
pivot of the object so let me show you

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.749 
pivot of the object so let me show you
how<00:01:45.710> how<00:01:46.670> to<00:01:46.729> detect<00:01:47.090> this<00:01:47.810> problem<00:01:48.350> if<00:01:48.770> you<00:01:49.640> go

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759 
how how to detect this problem if you go

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:52.389 
how how to detect this problem if you go
into<00:01:49.969> the<00:01:50.060> hierarchy<00:01:50.570> tab<00:01:50.780> and<00:01:51.219> you<00:01:52.219> go<00:01:52.340> to

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:52.399 
into the hierarchy tab and you go to

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:55.929 
into the hierarchy tab and you go to
affect<00:01:52.759> pivot<00:01:52.909> only<00:01:53.119> and<00:01:54.130> then<00:01:55.130> you<00:01:55.310> grab<00:01:55.789> your

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:55.939 
affect pivot only and then you grab your

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:58.029 
affect pivot only and then you grab your
rotate<00:01:56.359> gizmo<00:01:56.719> and<00:01:56.899> in<00:01:56.990> this<00:01:57.079> grey<00:01:57.380> area<00:01:57.409> right

00:01:58.029 --> 00:01:58.039 
rotate gizmo and in this grey area right

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:00.160 
rotate gizmo and in this grey area right
here<00:01:58.070> between<00:01:58.429> all<00:01:58.909> of<00:01:58.939> the<00:01:59.329> all<00:01:59.600> of<00:01:59.659> the

here between all of the all of the
rotation<00:02:00.560> wheels<00:02:00.829> you<00:02:01.820> just<00:02:01.969> kind<00:02:02.119> of<00:02:02.149> grab

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:02.329 
rotation wheels you just kind of grab

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:04.109 
rotation wheels you just kind of grab
that<00:02:02.479> grey<00:02:02.719> area<00:02:02.749> and<00:02:03.320> twiddle<00:02:03.679> the<00:02:03.770> pivot

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:04.119 
that grey area and twiddle the pivot

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:07.200 
that grey area and twiddle the pivot
your<00:02:05.119> object<00:02:05.509> starts<00:02:05.659> to<00:02:05.869> dance<00:02:06.109> a<00:02:06.289> little<00:02:06.439> bit

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
your object starts to dance a little bit

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.290 
your object starts to dance a little bit
that's<00:02:08.210> weird<00:02:09.129> so<00:02:10.129> if<00:02:10.580> you<00:02:10.759> look<00:02:10.879> at<00:02:11.030> it<00:02:11.090> you

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
that's weird so if you look at it you

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:12.309 
that's weird so if you look at it you
can<00:02:11.330> figure<00:02:11.629> out<00:02:11.750> why<00:02:11.989> this<00:02:12.050> is<00:02:12.200> happening

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
can figure out why this is happening

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:14.300 
can figure out why this is happening
because<00:02:12.860> i<00:02:13.700> scaled<00:02:14.000> the

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
because i scaled the

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.449 
because i scaled the
object<00:02:14.550> fifty<00:02:14.880> percent<00:02:15.209> along<00:02:15.599> the<00:02:15.750> z-axis

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
object fifty percent along the z-axis

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:18.920 
object fifty percent along the z-axis
but<00:02:17.459> when<00:02:17.610> i<00:02:17.640> move<00:02:17.910> the<00:02:18.060> direction<00:02:18.390> that<00:02:18.540> the<00:02:18.690> z

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
but when i move the direction that the z

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.260 
but when i move the direction that the z
axis<00:02:18.959> points<00:02:19.739> i'm<00:02:20.030> changing<00:02:21.030> the<00:02:21.120> direction

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
axis points i'm changing the direction

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.440 
axis points i'm changing the direction
that<00:02:21.780> the<00:02:22.080> teapot<00:02:22.590> is<00:02:22.739> being<00:02:22.980> scaled<00:02:23.280> in<00:02:23.520> for

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
that the teapot is being scaled in for

that the teapot is being scaled in for
fifty<00:02:24.690> percent<00:02:24.989> and<00:02:26.120> you<00:02:27.120> can<00:02:27.270> do<00:02:27.360> this<00:02:27.510> for

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
fifty percent and you can do this for

fifty percent and you can do this for

been done to this teapot and collapse
them<00:04:11.579> together<00:04:11.850> into<00:04:12.720> the<00:04:12.900> original<00:04:13.319> object

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:17.509 
them together into the original object
very<00:04:15.810> powerful<00:04:16.289> it<00:04:16.500> is<00:04:16.620> exactly<00:04:16.799> the<00:04:17.310> tool

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
very powerful it is exactly the tool

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.810 
very powerful it is exactly the tool
that<00:04:17.910> fixes<00:04:18.269> this<00:04:18.419> problem<00:04:19.489> let<00:04:20.489> me<00:04:20.579> show<00:04:20.729> you

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
that fixes this problem let me show you

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.570 
that fixes this problem let me show you
how<00:04:20.880> to<00:04:21.000> prevent<00:04:21.269> it<00:04:22.039> I'm<00:04:23.039> going<00:04:23.159> to<00:04:23.250> take<00:04:23.400> this

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
how to prevent it I'm going to take this

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.719 
how to prevent it I'm going to take this
teapot<00:04:24.090> and<00:04:24.300> I'm<00:04:24.390> going<00:04:24.599> to<00:04:24.659> collapse<00:04:25.590> it<00:04:25.860> into

00:04:26.719 --> 00:04:26.729 
teapot and I'm going to collapse it into

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:27.940 
teapot and I'm going to collapse it into
an<00:04:26.849> editable<00:04:27.120> poly

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:27.950 
an editable poly

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:32.140 
an editable poly
so<00:04:28.950> it's<00:04:29.160> now<00:04:29.280> a<00:04:29.330> 50-percent<00:04:30.330> taller<00:04:31.110> teapot

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.150 
so it's now a 50-percent taller teapot

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.340 
so it's now a 50-percent taller teapot
now<00:04:33.150> you've<00:04:33.330> already<00:04:33.540> seen<00:04:33.690> what<00:04:33.840> happens<00:04:34.230> if

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350 
now you've already seen what happens if

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:38.690 
now you've already seen what happens if
I<00:04:34.440> scale<00:04:34.800> this<00:04:34.980> teapot<00:04:35.420> on<00:04:37.250> this<00:04:38.250> outer<00:04:38.460> level

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:38.700 
I scale this teapot on this outer level

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:40.790 
I scale this teapot on this outer level
so<00:04:39.270> I<00:04:39.300> have<00:04:39.510> the<00:04:39.600> whole<00:04:39.780> teapot<00:04:40.140> selected<00:04:40.650> I've

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
so I have the whole teapot selected I've

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.950 
so I have the whole teapot selected I've
scaled<00:04:41.070> the<00:04:41.220> entire<00:04:41.490> thing<00:04:41.520> down<00:04:42.090> and<00:04:42.390> you

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
scaled the entire thing down and you

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.840 
scaled the entire thing down and you
already<00:04:43.200> know<00:04:43.320> that<00:04:43.800> if<00:04:44.130> I<00:04:44.310> then<00:04:44.460> twiddle<00:04:44.820> my

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:44.850 
already know that if I then twiddle my

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:47.000 
already know that if I then twiddle my
my<00:04:45.420> gizmo<00:04:45.780> we<00:04:46.110> get<00:04:46.260> the<00:04:46.380> dancing<00:04:46.500> teapot

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.010 
my gizmo we get the dancing teapot

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:53.360 
my gizmo we get the dancing teapot
problem<00:04:48.800> but<00:04:49.800> if<00:04:50.040> I<00:04:50.730> scale<00:04:51.150> only<00:04:52.040> the<00:04:53.040> sub

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370 
problem but if I scale only the sub

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:56.000 
problem but if I scale only the sub
objects<00:04:54.050> so<00:04:55.050> I've<00:04:55.110> selected<00:04:55.290> everything<00:04:55.920> I'm

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.010 
objects so I've selected everything I'm

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:59.690 
objects so I've selected everything I'm
going<00:04:56.130> to<00:04:56.220> go<00:04:56.900> select<00:04:57.900> their<00:04:58.020> Center<00:04:58.350> and<00:04:58.610> if<00:04:59.610> I

00:04:59.690 --> 00:04:59.700 
going to go select their Center and if I

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:03.170 
going to go select their Center and if I
scale<00:04:59.970> them<00:05:00.150> like<00:05:00.300> this<00:05:01.100> there<00:05:02.100> we<00:05:02.160> go<00:05:02.280> if<00:05:03.120> I

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180 
scale them like this there we go if I

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.659 
scale them like this there we go if I
scale<00:05:03.419> them<00:05:03.600> like<00:05:03.720> this<00:05:03.930> I<00:05:04.400> don't<00:05:05.400> get<00:05:05.550> the

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:05.669 
scale them like this I don't get the

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:09.590 
scale them like this I don't get the
same<00:05:05.790> problem<00:05:07.070> it<00:05:08.300> doesn't<00:05:09.300> affect<00:05:09.510> the

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:09.600 
same problem it doesn't affect the

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.890 
same problem it doesn't affect the
transforms<00:05:10.080> at<00:05:10.200> all<00:05:11.390> so<00:05:12.390> this<00:05:12.540> is<00:05:12.660> a<00:05:12.690> critical

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 
transforms at all so this is a critical

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.230 
transforms at all so this is a critical
distinction<00:05:13.440> if<00:05:13.740> you<00:05:14.400> need<00:05:14.640> to<00:05:14.790> scale<00:05:15.030> an

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 
distinction if you need to scale an

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.690 
distinction if you need to scale an
object<00:05:15.770> this<00:05:16.770> is<00:05:16.919> by<00:05:17.040> especially<00:05:17.430> something

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:17.700 
object this is by especially something

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:19.400 
object this is by especially something
complex<00:05:18.180> like<00:05:18.450> this<00:05:18.660> where<00:05:18.870> it<00:05:18.960> has<00:05:19.080> a<00:05:19.110> lot<00:05:19.380> of

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:19.410 
complex like this where it has a lot of

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:22.310 
complex like this where it has a lot of
sub-objects<00:05:20.100> to<00:05:20.280> it<00:05:20.400> scale<00:05:21.360> the<00:05:21.600> sub-objects

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:22.320 
sub-objects to it scale the sub-objects

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.130 
sub-objects to it scale the sub-objects
the<00:05:22.530> polygons<00:05:23.070> the<00:05:23.400> vertices<00:05:23.730> the<00:05:24.660> elements

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:25.140 
the polygons the vertices the elements

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:28.220 
the polygons the vertices the elements
don't<00:05:26.100> scale<00:05:26.550> the<00:05:26.850> the<00:05:27.240> upper<00:05:27.570> level<00:05:27.870> object

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:28.230 
don't scale the the upper level object

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:30.710 
don't scale the the upper level object
like<00:05:28.410> this<00:05:29.000> because<00:05:30.000> that's<00:05:30.240> going<00:05:30.450> to<00:05:30.570> lead

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:30.720 
like this because that's going to lead

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.570 
like this because that's going to lead
to<00:05:30.750> the<00:05:31.050> transform<00:05:31.560> problem<00:05:31.890> that<00:05:32.010> we<00:05:32.100> saw<00:05:32.310> and

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:32.580 
to the transform problem that we saw and

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.610 
to the transform problem that we saw and
it's<00:05:33.390> going<00:05:33.600> to<00:05:33.690> bring<00:05:33.930> up<00:05:34.050> the<00:05:34.169> need<00:05:34.350> for

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:34.620 
it's going to bring up the need for

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:36.800 
it's going to bring up the need for
