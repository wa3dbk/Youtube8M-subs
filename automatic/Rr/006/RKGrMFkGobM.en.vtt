00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
custom tactic it's very very similar the

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.320 
custom tactic it's very very similar the
only<00:02:09.360> things<00:02:10.259> that<00:02:10.560> change<00:02:10.979> will<00:02:11.640> be<00:02:11.819> passes

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
only things that change will be passes

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.700 
only things that change will be passes
from<00:02:12.629> build<00:02:12.959> up<00:02:13.170> play

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
from build up play

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.010 
from build up play
and<00:02:13.800> all<00:02:14.190> the<00:02:14.520> options<00:02:15.030> from<00:02:15.360> transcreation

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
and all the options from transcreation

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.860 
and all the options from transcreation
will<00:02:16.770> be<00:02:16.980> lower<00:02:17.190> because<00:02:17.570> defaulting<00:02:18.570> a<00:02:18.690> team

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
will be lower because defaulting a team

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.350 
will be lower because defaulting a team
is<00:02:19.050> a<00:02:19.110> very<00:02:19.830> offensive<00:02:20.400> game<00:02:20.880> mode<00:02:21.120> and

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
is a very offensive game mode and

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.770 
is a very offensive game mode and
players<00:02:22.290> tend<00:02:23.010> here<00:02:23.340> to<00:02:23.580> make<00:02:23.850> more<00:02:24.210> runs<00:02:24.600> than

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
players tend here to make more runs than

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.320 
players tend here to make more runs than
in<00:02:25.140> head-to-head<00:02:25.680> so<00:02:26.070> you<00:02:26.130> need<00:02:26.610> to<00:02:26.820> restrain

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
in head-to-head so you need to restrain

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.140 
in head-to-head so you need to restrain
them<00:02:27.600> by<00:02:27.810> selecting<00:02:28.440> even<00:02:28.830> lower<00:02:29.190> values<00:02:29.940> at

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
them by selecting even lower values at

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
them by selecting even lower values at
these<00:02:30.510> options<00:02:31.110> also<00:02:31.980> at<00:02:32.520> both<00:02:33.170> head-to-head

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
these options also at both head-to-head

especially<00:03:02.010> in<00:03:02.190> alchemy<00:03:02.550> team<00:03:03.020> because<00:03:04.020> of

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
especially in alchemy team because of

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.070 
especially in alchemy team because of
the<00:03:04.350> low<00:03:04.590> values<00:03:05.190> in<00:03:05.460> chance<00:03:06.090> creation<00:03:06.720> your

the low values in chance creation your

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.440 
the low values in chance creation your

players will not make many runs in

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.450 
players will not make many runs in
attack<00:03:09.810> so<00:03:10.020> in<00:03:10.230> case<00:03:10.560> you<00:03:10.800> want<00:03:11.100> to<00:03:11.190> make<00:03:11.400> a

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:11.460 
attack so in case you want to make a

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:14.360 
attack so in case you want to make a
counter-attack<00:03:12.000> you<00:03:12.420> have<00:03:12.870> to<00:03:13.110> use<00:03:13.320> a<00:03:13.590> lot<00:03:13.890> the

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
counter-attack you have to use a lot the

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.260 
counter-attack you have to use a lot the
LB<00:03:15.060> l1<00:03:15.660> and<00:03:15.900> past<00:03:16.380> combination<00:03:17.250> this<00:03:17.910> custom

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:18.270 
LB l1 and past combination this custom

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:20.960 
LB l1 and past combination this custom
tactic<00:03:18.600> is<00:03:18.840> as<00:03:19.320> I<00:03:19.650> said<00:03:19.920> brilliant<00:03:20.250> against

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
tactic is as I said brilliant against

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.730 
tactic is as I said brilliant against
counter-attacks<00:03:21.660> because<00:03:22.020> if<00:03:22.290> you<00:03:22.530> lose

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:22.740 
counter-attacks because if you lose

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:25.100 
counter-attacks because if you lose
position<00:03:23.250> of<00:03:23.370> the<00:03:23.520> ball<00:03:23.700> in<00:03:23.910> attack<00:03:24.300> you<00:03:24.750> will

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
position of the ball in attack you will

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.800 
position of the ball in attack you will
always<00:03:25.410> have<00:03:26.010> at<00:03:26.220> least<00:03:26.250> one<00:03:27.060> midfielder<00:03:27.600> and

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
always have at least one midfielder and

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.110 
always have at least one midfielder and
four<00:03:28.350> defenders<00:03:29.040> that<00:03:29.100> will<00:03:29.460> protect<00:03:29.790> you<00:03:29.910> and

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
four defenders that will protect you and

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.660 
four defenders that will protect you and
this<00:03:30.810> is<00:03:31.080> the<00:03:31.260> worst<00:03:31.500> case<00:03:31.770> scenario<00:03:31.830> because

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
this is the worst case scenario because

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.090 
this is the worst case scenario because
it's<00:03:33.090> possible<00:03:33.540> to<00:03:33.660> have<00:03:33.840> even<00:03:34.110> more<00:03:34.410> players

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
it's possible to have even more players

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.180 
it's possible to have even more players
in<00:03:35.310> defense<00:03:35.790> also<00:03:36.270> remember<00:03:37.200> to<00:03:37.350> select<00:03:37.560> ultra
