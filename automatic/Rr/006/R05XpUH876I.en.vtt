go to the command prompt now I could

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.830 
go to the command prompt now I could
have<00:00:07.799> gone<00:00:07.919> to<00:00:08.069> run<00:00:08.309> and<00:00:08.490> type<00:00:08.700> CMD<00:00:09.000> or<00:00:09.570> I<00:00:09.660> can

just go to the command prompt here and
we're<00:00:11.460> going<00:00:11.580> to<00:00:11.639> take<00:00:11.730> Perl<00:00:12.090> minus<00:00:12.690> V<00:00:12.960> to<00:00:13.889> make

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
we're going to take Perl minus V to make

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.980 
we're going to take Perl minus V to make
sure<00:00:14.250> that<00:00:14.370> pail<00:00:14.549> is<00:00:14.700> not<00:00:15.030> installed<00:00:15.509> already

if<00:00:16.289> it<00:00:16.619> is<00:00:16.740> installed<00:00:17.220> uninstall<00:00:18.210> it<00:00:18.420> but<00:00:18.720> here

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
if it is installed uninstall it but here

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.150 
if it is installed uninstall it but here
we<00:00:19.050> can<00:00:19.170> see<00:00:19.350> that<00:00:19.529> the<00:00:19.590> command<00:00:19.830> is<00:00:19.949> not

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
we can see that the command is not

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.220 
we can see that the command is not
recognized<00:00:20.789> which<00:00:21.570> means<00:00:21.840> that<00:00:22.020> it's<00:00:22.140> not

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
recognized which means that it's not

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.670 
recognized which means that it's not
actually<00:00:22.710> been<00:00:22.859> installed<00:00:24.320> so<00:00:25.320> now<00:00:25.500> we're

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.630 
so it's quite a long install but I've
sped<00:02:01.350> it<00:02:01.439> up<00:02:01.500> again<00:02:01.770> here<00:02:02.009> just<00:02:02.250> for<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.430> sake

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
sped it up again here just for the sake

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.090 
sped it up again here just for the sake
of<00:02:02.670> brevity<00:02:03.320> once<00:02:04.320> that's<00:02:04.530> done<00:02:04.680> we<00:02:04.829> can<00:02:04.860> click

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
of brevity once that's done we can click

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.040 
of brevity once that's done we can click
on<00:02:05.219> finish<00:02:07.489> so<00:02:08.489> the<00:02:08.670> next<00:02:08.940> step<00:02:09.300> is<00:02:09.569> to

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
on finish so the next step is to

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.199 
on finish so the next step is to
actually<00:02:10.200> log<00:02:10.709> off<00:02:10.920> and<00:02:11.129> log<00:02:11.220> on<00:02:11.700> again<00:02:11.849> or

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
actually log off and log on again or

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.910 
actually log off and log on again or
indeed<00:02:12.959> you<00:02:13.200> can<00:02:13.349> just<00:02:13.500> reset

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
indeed you can just reset

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.309 
indeed you can just reset
your<00:02:14.099> entire<00:02:14.400> machine<00:02:14.870> so<00:02:15.870> I'm<00:02:15.930> going<00:02:16.140> to<00:02:16.200> do

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
your entire machine so I'm going to do

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:20.990 
your entire machine so I'm going to do
that<00:02:16.470> next<00:02:17.900> welcome<00:02:18.900> back<00:02:19.520> so<00:02:20.520> now<00:02:20.670> we<00:02:20.730> want<00:02:20.910> to

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
that next welcome back so now we want to

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.309 
that next welcome back so now we want to
check<00:02:21.209> that<00:02:21.390> we<00:02:21.480> have<00:02:21.599> pearl<00:02:21.840> installed

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
check that we have pearl installed

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.400 
check that we have pearl installed
correctly<00:02:22.470> so<00:02:23.340> we<00:02:23.430> get<00:02:23.550> to<00:02:23.610> the<00:02:23.700> start<00:02:23.970> menu

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
correctly so we get to the start menu

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.059 
correctly so we get to the start menu
click<00:02:25.410> on<00:02:25.560> pearl<00:02:26.040> command<00:02:26.670> line<00:02:26.910> here<00:02:27.209> and

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.069 
click on pearl command line here and

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:31.699 
click on pearl command line here and
that<00:02:29.069> will<00:02:29.220> open<00:02:29.340> up<00:02:29.580> command<00:02:29.970> line<00:02:30.209> for<00:02:30.480> us<00:02:30.709> we

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
that will open up command line for us we

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:36.620 
that will open up command line for us we
can<00:02:31.860> i<00:02:31.980> type<00:02:32.310> pearl<00:02:33.110> -<00:02:34.110> V<00:02:35.120> so<00:02:36.120> we'll<00:02:36.300> see<00:02:36.510> that

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
can i type pearl - V so we'll see that

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:42.199 
can i type pearl - V so we'll see that
we<00:02:36.750> have<00:02:37.020> pearl<00:02:37.980> 5<00:02:38.750> version<00:02:39.750> 12<00:02:40.550> subversion<00:02:41.550> 3

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209

the next thing we want to do is to
install<00:02:48.690> Sipan<00:02:49.410> -<00:02:49.830> so<00:02:50.430> to<00:02:50.489> do<00:02:50.730> this<00:02:50.910> we<00:02:51.120> type

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
install Sipan - so to do this we type

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.729 
install Sipan - so to do this we type
Sipan<00:02:51.840> space<00:02:52.470> app<00:02:53.370> with<00:02:53.970> the<00:02:54.060> capital<00:02:54.450> a<00:02:54.739> colon

colon c pan - if you then hit return

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.520 
colon c pan - if you then hit return
that<00:03:00.330> will<00:03:00.480> follow<00:03:00.750> through<00:03:00.989> all<00:03:01.200> the<00:03:01.350> steps

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
that will follow through all the steps

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.460 
that will follow through all the steps
necessary<00:03:01.830> to<00:03:02.250> install<00:03:02.640> C<00:03:03.030> pan<00:03:03.209> -<00:03:03.600> this<00:03:04.319> is

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
necessary to install C pan - this is

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.800 
necessary to install C pan - this is
something<00:03:04.650> we'll<00:03:04.950> use<00:03:05.130> later<00:03:05.160> on<00:03:05.670> so<00:03:06.569> we<00:03:06.660> can

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
something we'll use later on so we can

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.250 
something we'll use later on so we can
now<00:03:06.900> type<00:03:07.140> exit<00:03:08.000> the<00:03:09.000> final<00:03:09.390> step<00:03:09.630> is<00:03:09.900> to<00:03:10.080> check

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
now type exit the final step is to check

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.309 
now type exit the final step is to check
that<00:03:10.319> the<00:03:10.620> Padre<00:03:11.310> IDE<00:03:12.150> or<00:03:12.450> text<00:03:12.870> editor<00:03:13.200> has

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
that the Padre IDE or text editor has

that the Padre IDE or text editor has
been<00:03:13.530> installed<00:03:13.860> correctly<00:03:14.100> so<00:03:14.970> here<00:03:15.120> from

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
been installed correctly so here from

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:16.850 
been installed correctly so here from
the<00:03:15.420> Start<00:03:15.660> menu<00:03:15.900> we<00:03:15.989> can<00:03:16.110> see<00:03:16.200> there's<00:03:16.410> Padre

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
the Start menu we can see there's Padre

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.910 
the Start menu we can see there's Padre
so<00:03:17.130> if<00:03:17.220> I<00:03:17.310> click<00:03:17.489> on<00:03:17.610> that<00:03:18.739> that<00:03:19.739> will<00:03:19.769> then

that that's opened fine and this is

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.810 
that that's opened fine and this is
something<00:03:25.530> again<00:03:25.620> that<00:03:25.769> we'll<00:03:26.010> use<00:03:26.040> later<00:03:26.310> on

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
something again that we'll use later on

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.810 
something again that we'll use later on
but<00:03:27.180> we<00:03:27.299> want<00:03:27.390> to<00:03:27.540> setup<00:03:27.780> now<00:03:28.310> so<00:03:29.310> we<00:03:29.459> can<00:03:29.609> quit

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820
