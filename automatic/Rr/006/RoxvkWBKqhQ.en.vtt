this<00:03:34.970> terminal<00:03:35.660> every<00:03:35.900> day<00:03:36.020> so<00:03:36.290> when<00:03:36.410> you

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
this terminal every day so when you

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.860 
this terminal every day so when you
think<00:03:36.680> about<00:03:36.740> it<00:03:37.070> in<00:03:37.459> a<00:03:37.580> year<00:03:37.940> we'll<00:03:38.420> do<00:03:38.660> more

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
think about it in a year we'll do more

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:40.600 
think about it in a year we'll do more
than<00:03:39.019> three<00:03:39.350> times<00:03:39.590> the<00:03:39.920> population<00:03:40.100> of<00:03:40.519> the

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:40.610 
than three times the population of the

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:42.790 
than three times the population of the
entire<00:03:40.850> state<00:03:41.300> that<00:03:42.200> comes<00:03:42.470> through<00:03:42.650> the

entire state that comes through the

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.229 
entire state that comes through the
airport<00:03:43.160> so<00:03:43.340> I<00:03:43.370> mean<00:03:43.580> that's<00:03:43.700> it's<00:03:43.880> a<00:03:43.970> lot<00:03:44.120> of

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:44.239 
airport so I mean that's it's a lot of

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:45.880 
airport so I mean that's it's a lot of
people<00:03:44.510> I<00:03:44.630> mean<00:03:44.780> it's<00:03:44.930> not<00:03:45.080> many<00:03:45.410> communities

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890 
people I mean it's not many communities

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:47.860 
people I mean it's not many communities
that<00:03:46.070> have<00:03:46.250> so<00:03:46.820> much<00:03:46.940> nonstop<00:03:47.450> service<00:03:47.600> not
