00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:06.759
 Good evening everyone is here today to do 

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:11.090
 or buy yourself between the lamellar pack 

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:13.280
 Polini big evolution and malossi Vuelle 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:17.960
 16v now the polini blades test 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:20.810
 always equal 16 t-shirts to Hinduism 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:23.150
 removed from the tones of certain we remember 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:26.239
 that herons do not feel is not me 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:29.089
 so cinema let us know this 

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:33.579
 however, this one has been filed here 

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:33.579
 it is generally exact parent evidence 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.579
 if you are interested in the comparison video 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:39.920
 between the intake manifolds but red 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:43.640
 and polini always find them on mine 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:49.219
 channel looking very good see from 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:52.399
 size am inside the playground o 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:53.600
 we immediately see that the rectangle of the 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:59.589
 molossi bigger and then we have 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:10.040
 size 35 35 50 of the born long lula 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:15.380
 the shorter one instead 25 19 25 25 20 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:18.079
 ok measure the malossi with one side more 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:21.439
 short of 26 97 therefore already longer 

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:25.220
 compared to the other longer side instead 

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:27.100
 with a 32 76 then against how many was 29 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:31.700
 something rover 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:34.909
 so let's say he decides then 35 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:39.469
 clash 1 mm less in the other path 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:47.479
 this the polini 35 polini measures well a 

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:52.670
 35 35 55 59 smaller but the clash 32 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:54.860
 75 then the molosses is more a side more 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.170
 short and longer is the longer side e 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.219
 the shorter I got words like 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.930
 height 

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:01.130
 let's see a correct population 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.750
 because anyway let us remember that the 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.430
 good people a little higher in poliri e 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.859
 almost the groups of which we now say that 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.929
 lamellas are however more perfect in the 

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:12.540
 ride in the right place in the melle 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:18.090
 they do n't seem to even why 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:18.090
 this is done cut but 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:27.120
 the inclination of the lamellas of the marassi 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:35.769
 they are a little more sloping we say than that 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:37.599
 politicians, however, like what hole you take 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:40.599
 always the book always important the 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:42.359
 story of a lifetime is now it's getting back 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:46.810
 and re-enter possibilities 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:48.750
 well now we will calculate the area then the 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.989
 we will put in the description 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.989
 to the next
