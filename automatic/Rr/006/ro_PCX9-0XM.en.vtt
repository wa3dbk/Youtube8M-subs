welcome to the ultimate pax video where
we<00:00:29.520> actually<00:00:30.060> take<00:00:30.780> the<00:00:30.990> path<00:00:31.200> knock<00:00:31.500> traveled

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980

we actually take the path knock traveled
and<00:00:32.160> I<00:00:32.720> wish<00:00:33.720> I<00:00:33.840> wasn't<00:00:35.239> what<00:00:36.239> I<00:00:36.270> said<00:00:36.630> in<00:00:36.960> the

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
and I wish I wasn't what I said in the

and I wish I wasn't what I said in the
actual<00:00:37.559> run<00:00:37.860> of<00:00:38.130> a<00:00:38.370> persona<00:00:38.910> is<00:00:39.180> true<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:40.350> less

this<00:00:40.860> level<00:00:41.190> you<00:00:41.280> have<00:00:41.489> to<00:00:41.670> do<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:42.300> better<00:00:45.110> so

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
this level you have to do the better so

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.160 
this level you have to do the better so
by<00:00:46.650> all<00:00:46.830> means<00:00:47.160> take<00:00:47.790> the<00:00:48.090> shortcuts<00:00:48.720> because

what a phase rising platform that's Mike
warm<00:01:07.920> which<00:01:08.100> nearly<00:01:08.460> got<00:01:08.610> me<00:01:08.820> bloody<00:01:09.090> hell

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.200 

there's<00:01:16.530> a<00:01:16.649> lot<00:01:16.860> of<00:01:16.950> rather<00:01:17.160> tricky<00:01:17.670> fingers

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
there's a lot of rather tricky fingers

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.520 
there's a lot of rather tricky fingers
to<00:01:18.330> deal<00:01:18.479> with<00:01:18.690> such<00:01:18.899> as<00:01:19.080> this

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
to deal with such as this

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.800 
to deal with such as this
like<00:01:20.070> what<00:01:20.310> moves<00:01:20.640> very<00:01:20.970> very<00:01:21.149> quickly<00:01:23.810> the

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
like what moves very very quickly the

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.569 
like what moves very very quickly the
second<00:01:25.170> one<00:01:25.260> it<00:01:25.380> moves<00:01:25.620> like<00:01:25.770> just<00:01:26.280> as<00:01:26.430> quickly

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.389 

we<00:01:30.579> got<00:01:30.820> this<00:01:30.970> bitter<00:01:31.270> nonsense<00:01:32.220> we<00:01:33.220> need<00:01:33.340> to

00:01:33.389 --> 00:01:33.399 
we got this bitter nonsense we need to

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:35.039 
we got this bitter nonsense we need to
hit<00:01:33.520> this<00:01:33.700> switch<00:01:33.939> in<00:01:34.299> order<00:01:34.360> to<00:01:34.600> open<00:01:34.869> the

this<00:01:38.079> is<00:01:38.229> to<00:01:38.350> actually<00:01:38.500> jump<00:01:38.829> up<00:01:39.070> the<00:01:40.020> moving

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
this is to actually jump up the moving

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.550 
this is to actually jump up the moving
platforms<00:01:41.590> and<00:01:41.860> actually<00:01:42.640> just<00:01:42.759> riding<00:01:43.210> them

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
platforms and actually just riding them

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.639 
platforms and actually just riding them
litchi<00:01:44.560> getting<00:01:45.070> crushed<00:01:45.720> so<00:01:46.720> nice<00:01:47.140> one<00:01:47.409> level

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:47.649

00:01:53.229 --> 00:02:00.060 
designer slice one and I love this
nonsense<00:01:54.299> what<00:01:55.299> two<00:01:55.570> Spears<00:01:58.799> this<00:01:59.799> bits

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
nonsense what two Spears this bits

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.070 
nonsense what two Spears this bits
actually<00:02:00.460> pretty<00:02:00.700> tricky<00:02:01.270> and<00:02:01.750> we're

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
actually pretty tricky and we're

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.120 
actually pretty tricky and we're
definitely<00:02:02.470> in<00:02:02.740> a<00:02:02.770> way<00:02:02.890> for<00:02:03.130> a<00:02:03.159> bevel<00:02:03.640> Columbia

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130

the<00:02:06.130> forum<00:02:06.759> or<00:02:07.090> Spears<00:02:07.539> we<00:02:07.840> just<00:02:08.019> got<00:02:08.200> time

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
the forum or Spears we just got time

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:09.779 
the forum or Spears we just got time
passed

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
passed

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:12.240 
passed
thankfully<00:02:10.750> the<00:02:11.049> water<00:02:11.380> levels<00:02:11.860> actually

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
thankfully the water levels actually

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.220 
thankfully the water levels actually
drop<00:02:12.610> once<00:02:12.940> you<00:02:13.209> go<00:02:13.569> past<00:02:13.599> a<00:02:13.900> certain<00:02:13.959> point

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
drop once you go past a certain point

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.470 
drop once you go past a certain point
here<00:02:14.709> here<00:02:15.010> we<00:02:15.099> go<00:02:15.280> so<00:02:15.549> at<00:02:15.640> least<00:02:15.790> you<00:02:16.150> don't

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
here here we go so at least you don't

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.870 
here here we go so at least you don't
drown<00:02:19.920> there's<00:02:20.920> a<00:02:20.980> good<00:02:21.130> reason<00:02:21.160> they<00:02:21.580> do<00:02:21.640> that

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
drown there's a good reason they do that

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.400 
drown there's a good reason they do that
though<00:02:22.120> because<00:02:22.390> you've<00:02:22.720> got<00:02:22.840> to<00:02:22.959> race<00:02:23.140> the

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
though because you've got to race the

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.270 
though because you've got to race the
water<00:02:23.650> on<00:02:24.640> top<00:02:24.819> of<00:02:24.970> this<00:02:25.030> platform<00:02:25.239> and<00:02:26.280> ride

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
water on top of this platform and ride

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:41.070 
water on top of this platform and ride
it<00:02:27.430> off<00:02:28.170> otherwise<00:02:29.610> you<00:02:30.610> drown<00:02:31.530> Angele<00:02:32.530> enough

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.350 

hence<00:02:42.080> it<00:02:42.320> across<00:02:42.860> we<00:02:43.100> go<00:02:43.310> watch<00:02:43.760> out<00:02:44.000> for<00:02:44.240> the

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
hence it across we go watch out for the

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:56.960 
spiked balls mates and we go apparently

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:06.420 
spiked balls mates and we go apparently
we<00:02:57.350> were<00:02:57.440> about<00:02:57.680> to<00:02:57.860> drown<00:02:59.740> whoa<00:03:01.000> fireballs

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.380 

pretty<00:03:07.430> convinced<00:03:07.760> the<00:03:07.910> waters<00:03:08.150> gonna<00:03:08.270> rise

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
pretty convinced the waters gonna rise

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:14.680 
pretty convinced the waters gonna rise
yes<00:03:08.900> yes<00:03:09.140> it<00:03:09.320> is<00:03:12.760> yes<00:03:13.760> those<00:03:14.090> blocks<00:03:14.450> were<00:03:14.660> a

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
yes yes it is yes those blocks were a

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.210 
yes yes it is yes those blocks were a
pretty<00:03:14.900> good<00:03:15.080> indication<00:03:15.470> as<00:03:15.860> you're<00:03:16.040> about

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
pretty good indication as you're about

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:29.260 
pretty good indication as you're about
to<00:03:16.400> get<00:03:16.520> flooded<00:03:25.810> so<00:03:26.810> I<00:03:27.820> started<00:03:28.820> the<00:03:29.000> very

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:29.270 
to get flooded so I started the very

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:36.300 
to get flooded so I started the very
very<00:03:29.630> good<00:03:29.780> reason<00:03:30.320> I<00:03:30.440> took<00:03:30.500> the<00:03:30.950> route<00:03:31.130> I<00:03:31.340> did

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:45.790 

so<00:03:37.310> much<00:03:37.670> of<00:03:37.850> his<00:03:37.970> level<00:03:38.330> of<00:03:38.420> skipped

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:45.800 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.720 

and<00:03:46.280> that<00:03:46.520> was<00:03:46.700> significantly<00:03:47.330> longer<00:03:48.730> okay

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730 
and that was significantly longer okay

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.430 
and that was significantly longer okay
so<00:03:49.790> there<00:03:50.090> wasn't<00:03:50.210> much<00:03:50.480> to<00:03:50.600> sharpen<00:03:50.990> ACTU

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
so there wasn't much to sharpen ACTU

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.290 
so there wasn't much to sharpen ACTU
because<00:03:51.800> there<00:03:52.010> is<00:03:52.100> only<00:03:52.220> one<00:03:52.370> path<00:03:52.730> so<00:03:53.060> that's

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:53.300 
because there is only one path so that's

00:03:53.300 --> 00:04:07.820 
because there is only one path so that's
coming<00:03:53.510> to<00:03:53.810> act<00:03:54.080> 3<00:03:56.560> sonic<00:04:00.700> hello
