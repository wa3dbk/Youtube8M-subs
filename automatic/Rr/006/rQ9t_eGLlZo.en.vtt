out the image the way it's supposed to
look<00:01:55.750> it<00:01:55.990> could<00:01:56.200> come<00:01:56.409> up<00:01:56.590> looking<00:01:57.750> very

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
look it could come up looking very

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.600 
look it could come up looking very
different<00:01:59.200> than<00:01:59.290> you<00:01:59.439> imagined<00:02:00.070> but<00:02:00.220> if<00:02:00.280> it

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
different than you imagined but if it

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.789 
different than you imagined but if it
works<00:02:00.880> it<00:02:01.600> looks<00:02:01.869> interesting<00:02:02.350> and<00:02:02.470> it<00:02:02.590> looks

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:02.799 
works it looks interesting and it looks

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:05.149 
works it looks interesting and it looks
right<00:02:03.039> then<00:02:03.340> you<00:02:03.460> got<00:02:03.610> with<00:02:03.759> it<00:02:03.880> although<00:02:04.210> it's

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
right then you got with it although it's

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.550 
right then you got with it although it's
done<00:02:06.159> on<00:02:06.310> a<00:02:06.340> computer<00:02:07.110> you<00:02:08.110> have<00:02:08.259> to<00:02:08.410> remember

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
done on a computer you have to remember

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.809 
done on a computer you have to remember
that<00:02:09.869> Photoshop<00:02:10.869> is<00:02:11.140> actually<00:02:11.519> designed<00:02:12.519> to

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
that Photoshop is actually designed to

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.800 
that Photoshop is actually designed to
emulate<00:02:13.300> at<00:02:14.260> the<00:02:14.709> analog<00:02:15.250> practices<00:02:15.910> that

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
emulate at the analog practices that

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.280 
emulate at the analog practices that
existed<00:02:17.769> before<00:02:17.980> Photoshop<00:02:18.750> so<00:02:19.750> when<00:02:20.050> you

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
existed before Photoshop so when you

making a fine print is really the same I
