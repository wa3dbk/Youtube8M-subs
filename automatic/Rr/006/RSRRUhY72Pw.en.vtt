00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.870
 home peeling rest some 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.900
 fakes works can come in handy 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:23.220
 home owner to do 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:25.080
 some sort of thing end for 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.519
 to bend the glass on 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.859
 need a strip 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.449
 no more than one and a half centimeters thick 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:36.800
 you can cut it yourself 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:46.020
 You can order a strip cut so 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:48.480
 personal glass cutter there studied with us 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.730
 such a wonderful strip for 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:57.469
 to go inside the gas stove you need 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:01:03.979
 remove the protective grid turn on the stove and 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:08.159
 then take on the flame of love and 

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:10.530
 we warm our strip of floor plane 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:14.580
 should you be purely fracking business 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:17.090
 take steve out i'm completely transparent 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.090
 clear glass 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.380
 glass melting point 1000 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.119
 degrees 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.189
 ordinary window glass therefore 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:28.060
 will have to wait have to show 

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:31.679
 patience 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:35.709
 have to wait for it to warm up and 

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:39.100
 open to view 

00:01:35.709 --> 00:01:41.319
 ready well because we take a little bit 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:45.219
 it and press down dip 

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:49.840
 look as soon as your glass 

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:52.090
 warmed enough masters who 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:56.500
 make different figures 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:58.060
 from glass various souvenirs they 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:04.299
 use a slightly different glass 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:06.819
 cobalt glass it is in 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:09.390
 selling so we work with ordinary 

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:09.390
 glass 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:17.030
 Need a single point is warming up the number 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:21.140
 on the glass because if you wake 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:24.290
 extend one point it means but you 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.420
 can burst and start our glass 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.290
 bend 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:33.770
 as you can see yourself you could bend 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:35.290
 as you like, the only thing that is 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:38.330
 you will bend glass 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:41.540
 you need to make enough stock 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:44.390
 in the corners for what so that you 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:48.790
 could calmly hold hands or at least 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:56.410
 through a cloth or tack 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:56.410
 Here we take just such an interesting one 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:04.270
 spiral i warm up slowly and 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:07.010
 wrap glass spiral 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:07.990
 we can still indulge of course like this 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.490
 here bend it 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:12.890
 in an unusual way now we need it 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:15.130
 to cut correctly if I still have funds 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.930
 I take the side he just 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:20.660
 so it should be literally by 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:24.980
 millimeters lift from the gas here I 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:28.269
 Now I continue again but I still have it 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.269
 very very hot 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.989
 if you dramatically remove the glass became 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.989
 old ladies burst 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.680
 notice that I'm a little bit a little bit 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.019
 I raise 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:01.010
 but I also continue to 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:04.379
 heat up hot air say 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:07.980
 the main thing that the room had no words 

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:10.560
 excess airflow and then 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.760
 such here and his hats Negrin 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:18.120
 gas stove 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:20.579
 but still I still burn than 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:27.630
 the slower you remove the more likely 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:32.150
 but your rush will be bent in quality 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:32.150
 in this case, the worst 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:55.310
 so here dear friends turned out 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:05:01.940
 so we bent with you ordinary 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:02.600
 window glass experiment all 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:07.030
 good luck 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:09.620
 and we have such a product 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:13.970
 now you can just take the edges 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:16.510
 trim them us get your 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:16.510
 billet 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:42.190
 exactly 

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:45.000
 what's a gun 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:45.000
