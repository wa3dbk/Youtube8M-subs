00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.820 
copied the one I did from the other day
say<00:01:11.430> basic<00:01:11.970> 79<00:01:12.510> top<00:01:12.810> string<00:01:13.110> so<00:01:13.560> it's<00:01:13.740> pretty

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
say basic 79 top string so it's pretty

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.370 
say basic 79 top string so it's pretty
much<00:01:13.950> you<00:01:14.130> just<00:01:14.159> skip<00:01:14.549> one<00:01:15.270> every<00:01:15.479> time<00:01:15.659> and

shapeable<00:01:40.700> so<00:01:41.700> I<00:01:41.729> took<00:01:41.880> a<00:01:42.500> paper<00:01:43.500> towel<00:01:43.770> went

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
shapeable so I took a paper towel went

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.370 
shapeable so I took a paper towel went
through<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.220> middle<00:01:44.490> and<00:01:44.960> I<00:01:45.960> just<00:01:46.140> kind<00:01:46.320> of

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
through the middle and I just kind of

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.050 
through the middle and I just kind of
rubbed<00:01:46.619> it<00:01:46.740> through<00:01:46.920> like<00:01:47.040> that<00:01:47.250> and<00:01:47.820> it<00:01:47.909> got<00:01:48.030> a

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
rubbed it through like that and it got a

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.240 
rubbed it through like that and it got a
fair<00:01:48.600> amount<00:01:48.630> of<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.110> wax<00:01:49.500> off<00:01:49.740> in<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:49.979> middle

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
fair amount of the wax off in the middle

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.859 
fair amount of the wax off in the middle
but<00:01:50.670> it<00:01:50.759> keeps<00:01:50.939> on<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.180> side<00:01:51.390> so<00:01:51.540> you<00:01:51.570> keep<00:01:51.720> the

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
but it keeps on the side so you keep the

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.990 
but it keeps on the side so you keep the
nice<00:01:52.020> channel<00:01:52.439> but<00:01:52.560> you<00:01:52.619> block<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.520> rebounds

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
nice channel but you block the rebounds

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.639 
nice channel but you block the rebounds
just<00:01:54.509> something<00:01:54.689> I've<00:01:54.750> been<00:01:54.810> doing<00:01:55.049> so<00:01:55.560> you
