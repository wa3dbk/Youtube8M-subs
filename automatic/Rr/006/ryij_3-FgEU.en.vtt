00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:25.420
 Fasiano aimed at j 1 promotion playoff advance in reverse 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.490
 The stadium was packed with over 8,000 supporters 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.040
 Bee Ana received a pass before the bottom version call 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.040
 Do 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.760
 This is blocked by the good save of the keeper 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:51.770
 The first half wraps with 0 to 0 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.770
 Pagiano throws a long throw in the late 23 minutes Katayama 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:00.310
 From the battle before the goal 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:00.310
 Last down 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.960
 However, he is attacked by Kumamoto aiming at counterattack from here 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.300
 I will keep my defense of the badger's hard work 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.729
 But it was just before the end 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:39.110
 Pain of equal goal 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:44.049
 Before the final section for Oita, which ended Fajiano the 6-position of the Yamagata and 7-positions to draw won the co 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:44.049
 Promotion to the playoffs no longer possible 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:53.750
 Before the eyes of the curve that there is no possibility of entering the playoffs 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:55.520
 It's very disappointing that it has happened at the end of the second half and gradually dropped 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.900
 The place that I 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:04.070
 Well it is our power 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:04.070
 It will be a repeat of the above, but I feel strongly that I am short of power 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.819
 If it is over, it is said that the playoff advance was lost according to the result of the rival team 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:16.190
 Though it became to be 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:20.480
 There is the way I wanted to see a figure swollen activities in the home final game somehow 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:21.530
 As a supporter, I can not organize my feelings, but the remaining game is the end 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.960
 Let's support to 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.480

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:30.180
 It is Associate flat 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:32.730
 Pagiano dropped one place to 10th place 6th place difference with Yamagata is 6 points difference and playoff advance 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.819
