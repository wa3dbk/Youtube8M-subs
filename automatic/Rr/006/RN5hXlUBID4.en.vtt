00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
match here in Group C so we have two

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.730 
match here in Group C so we have two
very<00:00:08.940> big<00:00:09.179> decks<00:00:09.389> we<00:00:09.630> have<00:00:09.719> a<00:00:09.900> blade<00:00:10.230> turbo

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
very big decks we have a blade turbo

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.310 
very big decks we have a blade turbo
from<00:00:10.950> back<00:00:11.160> in<00:00:11.250> 2007<00:00:12.150> with<00:00:12.300> triple<00:00:12.900> straddles

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
from back in 2007 with triple straddles

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.010 
from back in 2007 with triple straddles
is<00:00:13.710> spare<00:00:14.160> to<00:00:14.309> begin<00:00:14.580> satellites<00:00:15.240> from<00:00:15.509> this

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
is spare to begin satellites from this

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.599 
is spare to begin satellites from this
year<00:00:16.430> 2015<00:00:17.430> so<00:00:17.850> with<00:00:18.000> three<00:00:18.439> three<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:19.470> net<00:00:19.770> so

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
year 2015 so with three three the net so

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.580 
year 2015 so with three three the net so
basically<00:00:21.000> it's<00:00:21.240> triple<00:00:21.600> Stratos<00:00:21.990> vs<00:00:22.350> triple

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
basically it's triple Stratos vs triple

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.859 
basically it's triple Stratos vs triple
the<00:00:22.830> net<00:00:22.980> and<00:00:23.189> this<00:00:23.699> should<00:00:23.970> be<00:00:24.210> a<00:00:24.240> good<00:00:24.539> match

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
the net and this should be a good match

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.580 
the net and this should be a good match
no<00:00:25.640> so<00:00:26.670> from<00:00:27.300> previous<00:00:27.660> matches<00:00:27.930> we<00:00:28.050> know<00:00:28.199> that

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
no so from previous matches we know that

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.030 
no so from previous matches we know that
both<00:00:28.920> agents<00:00:29.550> and<00:00:29.760> chaos<00:00:30.720> Emperor<00:00:31.109> a<00:00:31.740> yachtie

yeah<00:02:06.829> it<00:02:07.250> seems<00:02:07.820> that<00:02:08.229> satellites<00:02:09.229> do<00:02:09.590> have

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
yeah it seems that satellites do have

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:11.619 
yeah it seems that satellites do have
the<00:02:10.039> advantage

00:02:11.619 --> 00:02:11.629 
the advantage

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:14.290 
the advantage
let's<00:02:11.810> open<00:02:11.900> into<00:02:12.349> that<00:02:12.500> first<00:02:12.830> game<00:02:13.370> alright

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
let's open into that first game alright

with<00:02:16.489> air<00:02:16.760> blade<00:02:17.060> turbo<00:02:17.569> I<00:02:17.599> put<00:02:17.870> something

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
with air blade turbo I put something

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.509 
with air blade turbo I put something
with<00:02:18.200> satellites<00:02:18.709> he<00:02:18.920> gets<00:02:19.129> a<00:02:19.220> very<00:02:19.310> good

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:19.519

excavation<00:03:53.090> life<00:03:53.690> it<00:03:54.169> submitted<00:03:54.650> I<00:03:54.859> think

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
excavation life it submitted I think

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.280 
excavation life it submitted I think
that<00:03:55.519> that<00:03:55.790> definitely<00:03:56.359> was<00:03:56.599> not<00:03:56.870> a<00:03:56.930> correct

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
that that definitely was not a correct

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:00.699 
that that definitely was not a correct
play<00:03:57.769> but<00:03:58.069> in<00:03:58.310> hindsight<00:03:58.730> I<00:03:59.269> mean<00:03:59.510> yet<00:04:00.109> it's

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
play but in hindsight I mean yet it's

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:03.129 
play but in hindsight I mean yet it's
maybe<00:04:01.489> it<00:04:01.609> was<00:04:01.730> a<00:04:01.760> maybe<00:04:02.419> I<00:04:02.510> should<00:04:02.690> just

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:03.139 
maybe it was a maybe I should just

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:05.740 
maybe it was a maybe I should just
should<00:04:03.380> have<00:04:03.410> rested<00:04:03.849> then<00:04:04.849> again<00:04:05.150> yeah<00:04:05.389> he

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:05.750 
should have rested then again yeah he

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:07.809 
should have rested then again yeah he
did<00:04:05.900> have<00:04:06.019> a<00:04:06.079> very<00:04:06.200> good<00:04:06.319> open<00:04:06.620> hands<00:04:06.799> and<00:04:06.950> was

did have a very good open hands and was

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:11.349 
did have a very good open hands and was
able<00:04:08.000> to<00:04:08.150> otk<00:04:08.840> me<00:04:09.049> on<00:04:09.230> his<00:04:09.590> second<00:04:10.250> turn<00:04:10.639> so<00:04:11.329> I

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:11.359 
able to otk me on his second turn so I

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:16.060 
able to otk me on his second turn so I
get<00:04:11.599> to<00:04:11.690> start<00:04:11.900> my<00:04:12.169> yeah<00:04:13.269> gray<00:04:14.269> felt<00:04:15.070> very

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
get to start my yeah gray felt very

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:17.979

I<00:04:19.820> think<00:04:20.090> I<00:04:20.180> have<00:04:20.270> another<00:04:20.810> one<00:04:20.930> a<00:04:21.140> setup<00:04:21.350> in

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
I think I have another one a setup in

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.250 
I think I have another one a setup in
the<00:04:21.560> grave<00:04:21.740> but<00:04:22.250> here<00:04:22.700> the<00:04:23.360> d<00:04:23.480> mark<00:04:23.720> because<00:04:24.020> i

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
the grave but here the d mark because i

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260 
the grave but here the d mark because i
drew<00:04:24.770> it<00:04:24.980> in<00:04:25.130> my<00:04:25.220> draw<00:04:25.490> face<00:04:25.760> so<00:04:26.000> i<00:04:26.030> can

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
drew it in my draw face so i can

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.780 
drew it in my draw face so i can
