00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:16.970 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:19.910 

Monty<00:00:17.970> is<00:00:18.119> going<00:00:18.330> to<00:00:18.449> be<00:00:18.539> driving<00:00:18.810> sine<00:00:19.650> waves

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
Monty is going to be driving sine waves

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.029 
Monty is going to be driving sine waves
into<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.430> Rubens<00:00:21.000> tube<00:00:21.090> the<00:00:21.930> Rubens<00:00:22.320> tube<00:00:22.410> is

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
into the Rubens tube the Rubens tube is

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.599 
into the Rubens tube the Rubens tube is
a<00:00:23.330> tube<00:00:24.330> that<00:00:25.050> you<00:00:25.109> pump<00:00:25.439> propane<00:00:25.949> into<00:00:26.369> or<00:00:26.580> a

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
a tube that you pump propane into or a

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.310 
a tube that you pump propane into or a
flammable<00:00:27.300> gas<00:00:27.359> and<00:00:27.960> then<00:00:28.019> you<00:00:28.140> have<00:00:28.289> a

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
flammable gas and then you have a

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.780 
flammable gas and then you have a
speaker<00:00:28.800> mounted<00:00:29.189> at<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.340> far<00:00:29.670> side<00:00:30.109> and<00:00:31.109> then

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:31.790 
speaker mounted at the far side and then

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:35.150 
speaker mounted at the far side and then
you<00:00:32.790> get<00:00:32.910> standing<00:00:33.390> waves<00:00:33.890> and<00:00:34.890> you<00:00:35.010> have

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
you get standing waves and you have

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.920 
you get standing waves and you have
holes<00:00:35.430> across<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.969> time<00:00:36.180> sorry<00:00:36.540> you<00:00:36.840> have

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
holes across the time sorry you have

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.959 
holes across the time sorry you have
holes<00:00:37.290> across<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.800> top<00:00:37.980> so<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.550> propane

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
holes across the top so the propane

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.940 
holes across the top so the propane
shoots<00:00:39.270> out<00:00:39.420> of<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.570> top<00:00:39.750> and<00:00:39.809> guns<00:00:40.170> and<00:00:40.530> burns

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
shoots out of the top and guns and burns

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.910 
shoots out of the top and guns and burns
and<00:00:41.219> so<00:00:41.460> then<00:00:41.760> you<00:00:42.270> modify<00:00:42.690> it<00:00:42.750> so<00:00:43.649> that<00:00:43.829> it

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
and so then you modify it so that it

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.380 
and so then you modify it so that it
doesn't<00:00:44.100> burn<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.460> whole<00:00:44.579> machine<00:00:44.730> and<00:00:45.149> then

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
doesn't burn the whole machine and then

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.069 
doesn't burn the whole machine and then
can<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.920> flames<00:00:47.250> I<00:00:47.550> haven't<00:00:47.910> seen<00:00:48.120> it<00:00:48.300> yet<00:00:48.480> but

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
can the flames I haven't seen it yet but

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.420 
can the flames I haven't seen it yet but
the<00:00:50.039> pressure<00:00:50.969> of<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.449> air<00:00:52.160> built<00:00:53.160> up<00:00:53.309> a

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
the pressure of the air built up a

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.889 
the pressure of the air built up a
little<00:00:53.640> bit<00:00:53.760> more<00:00:53.969> in<00:00:54.149> some<00:00:54.329> spots<00:00:54.539> and<00:00:54.780> less

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
little bit more in some spots and less

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.049 
little bit more in some spots and less
than<00:00:55.050> other<00:00:55.170> spots<00:00:55.469> shows<00:00:56.250> you<00:00:56.760> it's

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
than other spots shows you it's

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.029 
than other spots shows you it's
reflected<00:00:57.629> in<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:57.809> height<00:00:57.989> of<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.170> flames<00:00:58.440> so

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
reflected in the height of the flames so

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.849 
reflected in the height of the flames so
we<00:00:59.280> should<00:00:59.520> see<00:00:59.789> is<00:01:00.000> some<00:01:00.840> kind<00:01:01.109> of<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.289> harmonic

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
we should see is some kind of a harmonic

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.460 
we should see is some kind of a harmonic
pattern<00:01:02.219> across<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.550> top<00:01:02.820> of<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:03.000> pipe<00:01:03.210> and<00:01:03.480> a

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
pattern across the top of the pipe and a

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.010 
pattern across the top of the pipe and a
burning<00:01:05.430> Barbie<00:01:06.299> bride<00:01:06.659> doll<00:01:07.250> so<00:01:08.250> here<00:01:08.549> we<00:01:08.580> go

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
burning Barbie bride doll so here we go

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.270 
burning Barbie bride doll so here we go
which<00:01:10.020> is<00:01:10.170> optional<00:01:10.590> it's<00:01:10.740> not<00:01:10.860> really<00:01:11.070> part

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
which is optional it's not really part

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.789 
which is optional it's not really part
of<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.430> science<00:01:11.939> yeah<00:01:12.420> well<00:01:13.049> why<00:01:13.320> she's<00:01:13.530> doing

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
of the science yeah well why she's doing

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.499 
of the science yeah well why she's doing
she's<00:01:13.920> got<00:01:14.070> a<00:01:14.100> big<00:01:14.280> cast<00:01:14.580> or<00:01:14.820> propane<00:01:15.240> down

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
she's got a big cast or propane down

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.370 
she's got a big cast or propane down
here<00:01:16.610> this<00:01:17.610> is<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.000> group<00:01:18.210> a<00:01:18.390> she<00:01:19.020> is<00:01:19.140> turning

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
here this is the group a she is turning

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.710 
here this is the group a she is turning
it<00:01:19.619> on<00:01:19.820> someone's<00:01:20.820> going<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:21.090> like<00:01:21.240> something

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
it on someone's going to like something

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.630 
it on someone's going to like something
the<00:01:21.869> little<00:01:22.020> robot<00:01:22.470> who<00:01:22.770> says<00:01:23.009> you<00:01:23.250> look<00:01:23.400> nice

today is we did
right<00:01:26.150> light<00:01:26.840> it<00:01:26.870> just<00:01:27.680> like<00:01:27.860> starting<00:01:28.220> a

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
right light it just like starting a

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.120 
right light it just like starting a
little<00:01:28.310> fire<00:01:29.260> not<00:01:30.260> to<00:01:30.410> be<00:01:30.500> done<00:01:30.650> in<00:01:30.830> two<00:01:30.980> words

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
little fire not to be done in two words

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:36.540 
little fire not to be done in two words
oh<00:01:33.100> they're<00:01:34.100> okay<00:01:34.370> ready<00:01:34.670> to<00:01:34.850> see<00:01:35.060> the<00:01:35.210> shape

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:36.550 
oh they're okay ready to see the shape

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:40.380 
oh they're okay ready to see the shape
is<00:01:36.970> changing<00:01:37.720> as<00:01:38.320> the<00:01:38.590> frequency<00:01:38.800> changes<00:01:39.640> we

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 
is changing as the frequency changes we

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.030 
is changing as the frequency changes we
can't<00:01:40.630> really<00:01:40.870> see<00:01:41.080> a<00:01:41.290> lot<00:01:41.410> of<00:01:41.620> complete

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.040 
can't really see a lot of complete

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.050 
can't really see a lot of complete
waveforms<00:01:42.760> you<00:01:43.750> can<00:01:43.930> see<00:01:44.080> that<00:01:44.110> some<00:01:44.940> some<00:01:45.940> of

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
waveforms you can see that some some of

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.330 
waveforms you can see that some some of
these<00:01:46.150> well<00:01:47.020> that's<00:01:47.200> what<00:01:47.350> hit<00:01:47.560> on<00:01:47.590> so<00:01:48.010> can<00:01:48.250> you

see it all right there but please okay
some<00:01:51.970> of<00:01:52.060> these<00:01:52.150> wait<00:01:52.450> horns<00:01:52.920> have<00:01:55.560> have<00:01:56.560> nodes

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
some of these wait horns have have nodes

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.050 
some of these wait horns have have nodes
and<00:01:57.880> some<00:01:58.120> have<00:01:58.360> a<00:01:58.470> semi<00:01:59.470> big<00:01:59.790> lumps<00:02:00.790> and<00:02:00.910> some

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
and some have a semi big lumps and some

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.970 
and some have a semi big lumps and some
have<00:02:01.180> troughs<00:02:01.540> in<00:02:01.900> different<00:02:02.470> places<00:02:02.650> along

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:02.980 
have troughs in different places along

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:06.960 
have troughs in different places along
the<00:02:03.040> pipe<00:02:04.680> now<00:02:05.680> I<00:02:05.740> would<00:02:05.950> think<00:02:06.310> yeah<00:02:06.610> a<00:02:06.640> little

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
the pipe now I would think yeah a little

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:08.340 
the pipe now I would think yeah a little
oh<00:02:07.060> yeah<00:02:07.360> I<00:02:07.570> don't<00:02:07.750> say<00:02:07.900> a<00:02:07.930> little<00:02:08.140> lower

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.350 
oh yeah I don't say a little lower

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:09.540 
oh yeah I don't say a little lower
