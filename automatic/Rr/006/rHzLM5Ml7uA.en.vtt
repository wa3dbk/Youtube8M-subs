00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
does actually take a roll feed as well

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.650 
does actually take a roll feed as well
which<00:00:50.430> I<00:00:50.700> don't<00:00:50.760> have<00:00:51.120> installed<00:00:51.420> at<00:00:51.600> the

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
which I don't have installed at the

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.260 
which I don't have installed at the

moment but it just fits on there and I
don't<00:00:54.390> really<00:00:54.780> use<00:00:55.050> it<00:00:55.199> that<00:00:55.230> often<00:00:55.620> so

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
don't really use it that often so

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.740 
don't really use it that often so
there's<00:00:56.730> just<00:00:56.879> more<00:00:57.000> convenient<00:00:57.329> for<00:00:57.600> me<00:00:57.629> to

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
there's just more convenient for me to

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.779 
there's just more convenient for me to
have<00:00:57.870> it<00:00:57.960> off<00:00:58.340> but<00:00:59.340> that's<00:00:59.550> something<00:00:59.760> that

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
have it off but that's something that

perfect<00:01:52.840> examples<00:01:53.840> you<00:01:53.960> can<00:01:54.050> sort<00:01:54.260> of<00:01:54.320> see<00:01:54.530> and

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
perfect examples you can sort of see and

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:56.830 
perfect examples you can sort of see and
act<00:01:55.460> on<00:01:55.550> everything<00:01:55.760> from<00:01:56.030> from<00:01:56.390> white<00:01:56.660> on
