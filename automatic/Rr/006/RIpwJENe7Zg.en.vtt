00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.390

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.980
 Your mom's cat started to recreate 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.960
 some of the most memorable works of 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.000
 all the times although at the beginning 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.400
 these images were a joke between 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.560
 Svetlana Petrova and her friends will soon be 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.570

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.550
 successful that recently a gallery 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.250
 London set up an exhibition of the 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:41.840

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.160

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.739

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.750

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.780
 well the system of savings for retirement 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.220
 sar and the four consecutive months of 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.680
 increments 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:03.870
 but they know that what can 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.520
 matter we can reach old age without 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.470
 money but if the art has not touched 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:09.180
 our souls we can say that we have 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.550
 come to the end of our lives in 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.580
 complete poverty as the painter said 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:17.490
 Spanish Pablo Picasso a painter is the 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:20.130
 who paints what an artist sells is the 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.960
 who sells what he paints and therefore I want 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:27.200
