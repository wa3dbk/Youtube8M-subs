00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:36.670
 and there were friends we're going to be with this 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:39.820
 mini video of how to make eyelashes 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:42.280
 longer and bulky what I'm going to 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.620
 use is talc for baby and I'll start 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.420
 to hydrate it super well my lips if 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.449
 have you ever heard of these 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.610
 mascara masks that make 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:54.610
 They have fibers and they make your eyelashes 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:56.590
 with longer and voluminous that same 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:59.620
 does the talcum powder for baby so you do not 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.659
 you do not burn, it does not happen, I'm going to 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:05.110
 start in china I do not super well 

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:09.040
 eyelashes and I'll put a layer well a 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:11.200
 little bit of mascara so that the talcum 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:15.280
 adhere better and that is not like 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:19.390
 well dry the tab then I'll put 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:22.210
 the talcum I'm going to put it in one in a 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:25.479
 brush of old mascara that I already had 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:27.760
 it has to be super super clean 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:29.950
 you do not have to have any mascara and what 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.900
 I'm going to put the talcum powder for later 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.940
 put it on 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.310
 they happen to you they have to be super 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:39.190
 covers but try not to put as much 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.170
 talcum at the root of the eyelash because it 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.750
 see how much I say that you put yourself 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:48.150
 more at the top and then I'll 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.150
 to put another layer of mascara 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.810
 it's super super important that you also 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:55.429
 put on mascara on top of 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.789
 the tabs because I 've noticed 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:02:01.460
 that when you put on your mascara you see 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:03.619
 more bushy his eyelashes and obviously 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.049
 so you do not see the baby powder is 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:07.789
 all white I also put on a little bit 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:09.890
 of shirt on the bottom but there 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:13.069
 yes I did not like talcum wait until it 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:15.230
 dry and this is optional do not tell 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:17.870
 I recommend or do not do it if you do not want 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.420
 to pitch your three years in the end do not you 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:23.540
 worry do not fall down I do not miss anything 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:27.500
 and then I put on a little more mascara 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:30.860
 so that it looks more dense 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:33.290
 you know that this optional floor can 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.870
 put on many more layers or in this case 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.120
 you can wear only one you can wear 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:41.960
 much less something is to the taste of each 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:43.640
 who I put two and for me to me 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.280
 liked how it looked if you do not like it so 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.170
 intense then lower it a bit and good 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.180
 I hope you liked this mini 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.430
 beauty trick how to make your 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:57.010

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:57.010
 large and see you in the next video
