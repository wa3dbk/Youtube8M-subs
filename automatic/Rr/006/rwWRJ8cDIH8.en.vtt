00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
training so I eat just plain sugar gives

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.979 
training so I eat just plain sugar gives
me<00:03:26.130> power<00:03:26.340> for<00:03:26.609> sure<00:03:26.819> but<00:03:27.359> I'm<00:03:27.450> not<00:03:27.630> sure<00:03:27.900> if

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
it's really healthy I did exactly the

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.170 
it's really healthy I did exactly the
sugar<00:03:31.590> is<00:03:31.650> gonna<00:03:31.799> work<00:03:32.040> the<00:03:32.280> glucose<00:03:32.760> pound<00:03:33.090> is

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
sugar is gonna work the glucose pound is

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.849 
sugar is gonna work the glucose pound is
gonna<00:03:33.329> work<00:03:33.480> off<00:03:33.690> his<00:03:33.720> glucose<00:03:34.319> powders<00:03:34.739> and

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:34.859 
gonna work off his glucose powders and

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:37.159 
gonna work off his glucose powders and
marathons<00:03:35.310> before<00:03:35.459> definitely<00:03:36.209> works<00:03:36.480> you

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:37.169 
marathons before definitely works you

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:38.509 
marathons before definitely works you
know<00:03:37.260> you<00:03:37.319> can<00:03:37.440> get<00:03:37.560> some<00:03:37.620> fresh<00:03:38.010> juice<00:03:38.280> put

bottle<00:03:40.019> of<00:03:40.079> a<00:03:40.230> Powerade<00:03:40.650> there<00:03:40.919> but<00:03:41.069> it's<00:03:41.190> a

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
bottle of a Powerade there but it's a

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:42.589 
bottle of a Powerade there but it's a
lot<00:03:41.370> better<00:03:41.430> the<00:03:41.639> Powerade<00:03:41.970> because<00:03:42.389> I<00:03:42.449> have

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:42.599 
lot better the Powerade because I have

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:44.300 
lot better the Powerade because I have
all<00:03:42.690> of<00:03:42.780> artificial<00:03:43.410> colors<00:03:43.709> and<00:03:43.739> flavors<00:03:43.919> and

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
crap so you got fresh juice bit of

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:47.770 
crap so you got fresh juice bit of
glucose<00:03:46.290> pattern<00:03:46.650> there<00:03:46.799> works<00:03:47.069> a<00:03:47.220> treat

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
glucose pattern there works a treat

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.030 
glucose pattern there works a treat
problem<00:03:48.780> with<00:03:48.870> refined<00:03:49.319> sugar<00:03:49.590> is<00:03:49.709> it<00:03:49.859> just

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
problem with refined sugar is it just

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.949 
problem with refined sugar is it just
doesn't<00:03:50.519> have<00:03:50.760> any<00:03:50.790> nutrients<00:03:51.359> with<00:03:51.510> apart

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
doesn't have any nutrients with apart

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:53.330 
doesn't have any nutrients with apart
from<00:03:52.109> carbohydrates<00:03:52.799> so<00:03:52.949> doesn't<00:03:53.099> have<00:03:53.250> any

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
from carbohydrates so doesn't have any

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:54.589 
from carbohydrates so doesn't have any
of<00:03:53.400> your<00:03:53.459> vitamins<00:03:53.910> and<00:03:54.000> minerals<00:03:54.329> coins

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:54.599 
of your vitamins and minerals coins

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:58.039 
of your vitamins and minerals coins
aren't<00:03:54.840> etc<00:03:55.260> so<00:03:55.849> no<00:03:56.849> one<00:03:56.970> nobody<00:03:57.180> gets<00:03:57.540> fat<00:03:57.870> on

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.049 
aren't etc so no one nobody gets fat on

so<00:04:35.940> if<00:04:36.000> you<00:04:36.090> eat<00:04:36.180> the<00:04:36.300> fly<00:04:36.480> and<00:04:36.540> sugar<00:04:36.840> a<00:04:36.870> few

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
so if you eat the fly and sugar a few

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:38.330 
so if you eat the fly and sugar a few
times<00:04:37.200> a<00:04:37.380> year<00:04:37.530> to<00:04:37.560> stop<00:04:37.890> yourself<00:04:38.070> from

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
times a year to stop yourself from

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:39.920 
times a year to stop yourself from
hitting<00:04:38.910> the<00:04:39.030> wall<00:04:39.210> bunking<00:04:39.630> you<00:04:39.690> run<00:04:39.810> out<00:04:39.900> of

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
hitting the wall bunking you run out of

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:41.150 
hitting the wall bunking you run out of
glycogen<00:04:40.140> that's<00:04:40.530> fine<00:04:40.740> but<00:04:40.890> what<00:04:40.980> you're

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.160 
glycogen that's fine but what you're

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.150 
glycogen that's fine but what you're
doing<00:04:41.250> it<00:04:41.460> regularly<00:04:41.850> then<00:04:42.390> you<00:04:42.420> go<00:04:42.690> look<00:04:42.810> at<00:04:42.960> a

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 
doing it regularly then you go look at a

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.290 
doing it regularly then you go look at a
way<00:04:44.160> where<00:04:44.340> you<00:04:44.400> can<00:04:44.430> change<00:04:44.760> your<00:04:44.880> lifestyle
