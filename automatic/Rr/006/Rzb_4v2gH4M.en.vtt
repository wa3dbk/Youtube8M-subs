00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:07.779
 on Sunday 8 May the dandy of groesbeek the hits against achilles 29 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.699
 and both teams have few surprises 

00:00:12.699 --> 00:00:17.339
 arjan foreman falls this week and for the injured frank hol 

00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:20.699
 father the expected basic elf on the side of achilles 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.739
 the first good opportunity of the match and was for the hits 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.189
 heidfeld went next door 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.180
 then Achilles got into the game better and drank his better ones through corners 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.230
 of the game 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.890
 duinrell van strating who also made a fantastic goal last week 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:43.800
 also scored this week 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.560
 and again in a fantastic way 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:50.850
 the debt of more than twenty meters gave actors a 0 2 lead 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:58.230
 played just before the thirty minutes where the shorting godfather of pits 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.850
 ball hit the post and so it remained exciting and the baby of goes week 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.990
 the second half was more balanced the chances went back and forth 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.890
 both the mark of pick and the incoming were given great opportunities for a club to 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.090
 to score 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.060
 however, the best chances remained for achilles 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.320
 The culprits shot his leg on the bar after he unlocked himself properly 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.360
 had 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.979
 the greatest chance was for tim raised from eleven meters 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.460
 he could shoot there oh well that's 29 a 0 2 lead 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.400
 work mackail stopped the penalty and kept the hits and the match 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.920
 and two more of red cards fell in the last minutes 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.170
 nps pramac aif al arab riot Moroccans 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.170
 he both left the field for a red card 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.280
 recently was caught the Achilles 29 the three points on South 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:59.720
 also point loss and forest 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.820
 press the competition next week of great importance 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.180
 and hopes Achilles 29 out of sight of the championship in the top class 

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:14.639
 last week in tacoma euro one in a simple way from the current lot of work 

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:16.859
 the old rector peter 

00:02:16.859 --> 00:02:18.229
 button 

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:21.799
 Reynald has something room for that and that is what we are trying to do 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:23.039
 12 percent 

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:26.129
 the heart could not touch bacon 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:29.180
 agents were able to strengthen the competition that is certain 

00:02:30.499 --> 00:02:33.499
 jamie full speed he sells free and equivalent 

00:02:35.419 --> 00:02:40.659
 celtic nothing more have the ball where we wait for the ven I think that 

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:41.809
 we afterwards 

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:45.719
 after five good pressures have been put to make this message really come true 

00:02:45.719 --> 00:02:49.969
 Chances are they have not had a lot of work before pumping balls into it 

00:02:49.969 --> 00:02:53.579
 just as well played out options have had the plan of the ferraris 

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:56.439
 and shortly afterwards have put too much pressure 

00:02:56.439 --> 00:02:59.529
 8, this competition is different from other competitions 

00:03:00.499 --> 00:03:04.999
 well yes say if it is a form of the 30 28 and the program 

00:03:04.999 --> 00:03:07.999
 a lot of people are standing there, it is a little bit different 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:10.100
 age in the goal 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.049
 the points within two minutes between 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:13.519
 yes I know 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:15.349
 this is it is one 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:17.849
 a nice duel one 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:21.879
 yes I can do a lot at stake for the fans yes you see that today 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:23.499
 a bit different than others 

00:03:23.499 --> 00:03:25.679
 again zero today 

00:03:25.679 --> 00:03:28.799
 yes it was with hanging and strangling that was 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:31.769
 it was easy again a shortage of a bus 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:33.769
 for the world the neighborhood 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:36.209
 many free kicks and corners are criminal 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:40.949
 After years it gives much worse C with the Air Force is that we are more dangerous 

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:43.119
 asked to return to their room 

00:03:43.119 --> 00:03:47.789
 no for me a shot in the second half was for most entitled how 

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:50.759
 are you watching his third tour 

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:54.299
 I look there again done so it is for me the other competitions 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:56.699
 just like last week 

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:59.129
 it is always fun to play matches 

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:01.579
 no people swim independently 

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:03.189
 no further viewing 

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:07.849
 when thank you and congratulations, the newspaper officially reaches the building 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:10.580
 Do you have a demanding leader? 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:13.789
 ing traviss noted how it feels 

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:15.349
 actually follow 

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:18.449
 home game was seems very tough he was after all i think 

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:20.120
 for the red 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.190
 but you also notice by keeping away a tough match 

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:28.059
 I have I can even say that we are in control 

00:04:28.059 --> 00:04:30.830
 the player was injured and opportunities came 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:34.050
 and girls continue to live until the second half 

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:35.969
 to hand over 

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:38.210
 and that she 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:40.659
 its benefit for the animals lower 

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:43.219
 and have very soft ivory coast marks 

00:04:43.219 --> 00:04:45.080
 with those from behind 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:46.999
 that supplies were only there 

00:04:46.999 --> 00:04:49.870
 It actually already higher up that is the most important this feeling 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:52.870
 not turn all the time and can decide the final leg 

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:55.300
 certainly yes 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:59.229
 by a penalty alone if you make your phone flawless inside 

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:02.400
 and if today there is no one that has seen me 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.270
 but yes of that the transfer 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:06.139
 the chance the pole 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:10.349
 degrees Celsius is expected with which the action supports 

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:13.819
 she tweeted about it and the site that he is now from 

00:05:13.819 --> 00:05:16.499
 Finland and that he then with the site 

00:05:16.499 --> 00:05:17.949
 and as very dangerous 

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:20.789
 and yes peter praet met side three times 

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:25.620
 I think this competition can also be quite 7 time the last month 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.479
 but yes it is now and only 

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:31.580
 his trainer of course trying to win it from the side 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:33.949
 then some top oss lith fc oss 

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:37.830
 well 10 I knew they were the orphans 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:41.150
 but I did not mind the conscious one and 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:44.870
 I yes I do notice what they are in the rest, they also did not talk about it 

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:50.510
 after he had become the actual but not after they become only after 2 2 and that 

00:05:50.509 --> 00:05:53.509
 they actually the last minute on behalf of the score 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:59.110
 both the week that indices and officially decide the match can be on time 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:00.069
 floor tiles 

00:06:00.069 --> 00:06:02.860
 evening matches three points behind and winning then comes 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:05.389
 a decision game 

00:06:05.389 --> 00:06:07.460
 yes there will be two finals I hope 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:10.430
 and I hope that in the end we will grab it 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:11.230
 rutte 

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:16.500
 without land and congratulations are more efficient peek congratulations 

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:19.160
 those matches from the first whistle to the final push 

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:20.589
 tip of your seat 

00:06:20.589 --> 00:06:24.430
 az was often despite the heat and how I got it I think 

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:26.619
 that could go in the direction 

00:06:26.619 --> 00:06:29.669
 but think that we came out of the starting blocks much better than the travels 

00:06:29.669 --> 00:06:33.479
 and that also resulted in saying goodbye to a big lead 

00:06:33.479 --> 00:06:37.369
 toll therefore the streets and a bit of singing stands for but football is always 

00:06:37.369 --> 00:06:41.679
 easier but everything more in your favor the Volendammer that certainly 

00:06:41.679 --> 00:06:45.619
 again it would have done very well of late saying that he was racing in the field 

00:06:45.619 --> 00:06:47.559
 from that match in oss 

00:06:47.559 --> 00:06:49.580
 You know the banks that I know everything about 

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:53.190
 thereby being right about the intermediate positions and her husband stood tall with 

00:06:53.189 --> 00:06:57.650
 3 2 for 2 has become 2 2, which means that we are still there 

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:01.660
 participate for the title and then last week in many beautiful and beautiful days before 

00:07:01.659 --> 00:07:04.300
 that he can play that blamed 

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:07.530
 how do you go after the first set the cup match 

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:09.219
 but he also wants to win 

00:07:09.219 --> 00:07:13.439
 and then we would like to win the weekend against us but then he went 

00:07:13.439 --> 00:07:17.739
 after that still decide game yes and then I think it can go either way 

00:07:17.739 --> 00:07:20.649
 we have nothing yet but we can also get everything 

00:07:20.649 --> 00:07:24.279
 and that's a tip for achilles has a new big internship i can now 

00:07:24.279 --> 00:07:27.279
 two prize packs make a Friday choice 

00:07:28.009 --> 00:07:31.240
 after we have to look at how we have to record the damage of today he is 

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:32.349
 fairly 

00:07:32.349 --> 00:07:35.789
 they will play a slightly different team in the sector but 

00:07:37.199 --> 00:07:40.979
 yes well that cup who can then very well and in between because of a 

00:07:40.979 --> 00:07:42.389
 suspension 

00:07:42.389 --> 00:07:44.849
 fund our children died deceased 

00:07:44.849 --> 00:07:48.289
 I try the competition thanks and successful wk gaga
