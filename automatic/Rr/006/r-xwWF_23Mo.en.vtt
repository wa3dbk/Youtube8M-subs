00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.330
 simple without a bombardment with the tag 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.490
 25-25 I do not remember her name anymore 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.770
 well, whatever I come to say is 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:32.970
 what the title says I'm in shark 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:36.030
 spain and talk to same as then to 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.260
 final has let me in basically 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.450
 by the games that I have of 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.920
 bombed that some are golfers 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.289
 you know first of the world 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.690
 and good kids what I want to say is 

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:48.519
 because stylize that spain was not there 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.960
 I was in a trance I was nothing and spain 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:53.649
 it's good I'm going to explain those so for 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:56.019
 they find out that you may have a little and 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:59.409
 see this spain pod and it was very good 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:03.820
 they also fucked me up and it's 

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:07.720
 what was my family that was and so space i 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:10.210
 joined with race to which they were taken 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.729
 those who had a little more level the 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.090
 who knew a little more than those who 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:18.689
 brought more games so to speak 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:21.359
 and already beyond race then to see new people 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.909
 to all this all new I was two 

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:26.189
 weeks one out there the truth I could not stand 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:30.270
 because it was not the same as sparkling like that 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:32.310
 I said no that I was going to race and 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.459
 well that's why I spoke with I talked to isma e 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.350
 try to see change clan change 

00:01:35.459 --> 00:01:40.590
 airs to see how to see how 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.329
 they were the other clans and I bring games 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.219
 of pp-a that you already know that I have 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:47.220
 very many and I will leave you an image of 

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:48.569
 all the weapons that I have of all the 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.420
 bombings that I have of the weapons that 

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:53.520
 I have how I do not know how to explain this and what 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.439
 you have on the screen I have seven left 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.750
 guns three shotguns and three 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.520
 snipers and the knife that already that 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.770
 is that part because in quotes 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.560
 because I do not know if you can draw that is 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.539
 that I think is impossible but good 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.050
 I always think that everything is possible 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:10.860
 cone 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.540
 I liked to read because 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.040
 the level that you have is such that it is 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.960
 impressive the games he has 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.570
 these people if it is brutally crazy every 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.900
 person takes out games that flip 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.329
 but good 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.700
 yes if it were not for the bombed that 

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:26.319
 I have as player of ff to then if 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.569
 I clearly could not enter because it's 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:31.850
 that there is that they take out games have 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:34.100
 a great level shark spain 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.960
 and the truth is that I fall from 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:39.140
 fucking mother have not treated me badly or anything 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:41.360
 and I'm quite comfortable by now like this 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.220
 that I will surely be here a lot 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.400
 time if everything goes well if I get out 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:48.950
 my whiskers that is what I'm looking for that 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.930
 true that with when I take out the 23 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.480
 francs and is that I take it out is going to be 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.130
 brutal is because it is to those parts there 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.860
 few in the world against it does 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:01.310
 found the 53 that have a bomb 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:03.140

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.960
 guarantor, guarantor that yes, what 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:09.350
 I knew and that is explained before 10 illuminate 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:11.480
 I said what if what if here with jurist 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:14.000
 but no, I'm not going to be left behind, I'm going 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.460
 to move forward with him with lfp to that 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.940
 is does not have to give the seven weapons that 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:21.800
 I still have to say it and if he took out the 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.510
 three francs and the three shotguns that from 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:25.430

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.080
 gift is indicated with the board uncle I'm 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.780
 pissed off with that but but nothing happens 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:32.990
 Uncle is patience because everything ends 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:36.680

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:38.080

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:58.590

00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:00.959

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.340

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.660
