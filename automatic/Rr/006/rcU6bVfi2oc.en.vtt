00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.149 
shirt look at how you can see his back
from<00:01:01.550> the<00:01:01.640> front<00:01:02.149> like<00:01:02.989> literally<00:01:03.590> his<00:01:03.890> waist

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 
from the front like literally his waist

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:06.010 
from the front like literally his waist
is<00:01:04.519> so<00:01:04.790> small<00:01:05.030> in<00:01:05.180> comparison<00:01:05.269> that<00:01:05.690> we<00:01:05.900> can

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
is so small in comparison that we can

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.649 
is so small in comparison that we can
see<00:01:06.229> his<00:01:06.440> back<00:01:06.950> muscles<00:01:07.310> bulging<00:01:08.060> out<00:01:08.420> from

see his back muscles bulging out from

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:11.150 
behind and I'm guessing he's not holding

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.300 
behind and I'm guessing he's not holding
his<00:01:11.479> arms<00:01:11.900> out<00:01:12.050> like<00:01:12.320> that<00:01:12.560> they<00:01:12.800> just<00:01:12.830> can't

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
live with a body like this what look at

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:33.730 
live with a body like this what look at
those<00:02:28.700> arms<00:02:29.060> and<00:02:29.690> the<00:02:30.200> legs<00:02:30.700> like<00:02:31.840> what<00:02:32.840> that

those arms and the legs like what that

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.050 
those arms and the legs like what that
doesn't<00:02:34.040> even<00:02:34.100> make<00:02:34.340> any<00:02:34.400> sense

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
doesn't even make any sense

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.000 
doesn't even make any sense
like<00:02:35.209> he<00:02:35.660> doesn't<00:02:35.930> even<00:02:35.989> have<00:02:36.320> legs<00:02:36.680> anymore

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
like he doesn't even have legs anymore

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.390 
like he doesn't even have legs anymore
those<00:02:37.340> are<00:02:37.489> just<00:02:37.670> odd<00:02:38.630> masses<00:02:39.560> of<00:02:39.739> multiple

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
those are just odd masses of multiple

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.150 
those are just odd masses of multiple
muscles<00:02:41.060> like<00:02:42.050> if<00:02:42.170> you<00:02:42.260> got<00:02:42.350> a<00:02:42.410> paper<00:02:42.650> cut<00:02:42.800> I'm

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
muscles like if you got a paper cut I'm

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.530 
muscles like if you got a paper cut I'm
afraid<00:02:43.489> it<00:02:43.610> would<00:02:43.700> actually<00:02:43.880> just<00:02:44.239> slice

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
afraid it would actually just slice

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.580 
afraid it would actually just slice
through<00:02:44.870> muscle<00:02:45.290> like<00:02:46.280> eat<00:02:46.459> a<00:02:46.489> sandwich<00:02:46.790> man

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
through muscle like eat a sandwich man

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.350 
through muscle like eat a sandwich man
see<00:02:48.590> what<00:02:48.890> I<00:02:49.190> really<00:02:49.370> noticed<00:02:49.940> with<00:02:50.150> these

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
see what I really noticed with these

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.420 
see what I really noticed with these
bodies<00:02:50.840> is<00:02:51.140> how<00:02:51.440> there<00:02:51.770> are<00:02:51.920> places<00:02:52.190> where

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
bodies is how there are places where

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.580 
bodies is how there are places where
there<00:02:52.850> is<00:02:52.880> no<00:02:52.970> muscle<00:02:53.510> and<00:02:53.750> so<00:02:54.050> those<00:02:54.290> look

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
there is no muscle and so those look

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.630 
there is no muscle and so those look
super<00:02:55.400> odd<00:02:55.670> like<00:02:56.480> this<00:02:56.900> guy's<00:02:57.110> knees<00:02:57.530> or<00:02:57.950> his

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
super odd like this guy's knees or his

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.440 
super odd like this guy's knees or his
head<00:02:58.970> for<00:02:59.600> example<00:02:59.800> like<00:03:00.800> it's<00:03:01.010> totally<00:03:01.610> miss

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
head for example like it's totally miss

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.180 
head for example like it's totally miss
proportionate<00:03:03.260> now<00:03:03.410> it<00:03:03.560> looks<00:03:03.709> like<00:03:03.770> his<00:03:03.980> head

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
proportionate now it looks like his head

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.340 
proportionate now it looks like his head
should<00:03:04.370> be<00:03:04.489> twice<00:03:04.820> as<00:03:05.150> big<00:03:05.450> and<00:03:05.750> he's<00:03:06.170> got

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:38.959 
muscle but that is taking it way too far

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:41.199 
muscle but that is taking it way too far
I'd<00:03:39.769> like<00:03:39.890> to<00:03:40.070> have<00:03:40.160> more<00:03:40.310> muscle<00:03:40.610> myself<00:03:40.970> but

probably like halfway between where I am
now<00:03:43.670> and<00:03:43.940> where<00:03:43.970> they<00:03:44.269> are<00:03:44.420> maybe<00:03:45.079> less<00:03:45.500> than

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709 
now and where they are maybe less than

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:48.160 
now and where they are maybe less than
half<00:03:45.890> even<00:03:46.370> half<00:03:46.610> seems<00:03:46.940> crazy<00:03:47.180> but<00:03:47.570> let<00:03:48.049> me
