00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
hi guys one final thing I want to say

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.650 
hi guys one final thing I want to say
about<00:00:04.400> specialization<00:00:05.400> of<00:00:05.879> weapons<00:00:06.270> so<00:00:06.450> what

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
about specialization of weapons so what

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.440 
about specialization of weapons so what
we<00:00:06.779> have<00:00:06.990> here<00:00:07.020> is<00:00:07.529> a<00:00:07.799> custom-made<00:00:08.610> Wilkinson

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
we have here is a custom-made Wilkinson

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.470 
we have here is a custom-made Wilkinson
sword<00:00:10.010> from<00:00:11.010> the<00:00:11.809> 1860s<00:00:12.809> and<00:00:14.480> essentially

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
sword from the 1860s and essentially

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.840 
sword from the 1860s and essentially
it's<00:00:15.839> got<00:00:16.199> a<00:00:16.230> specialized<00:00:16.859> rusting<00:00:17.460> blade<00:00:17.670> on

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
it's got a specialized rusting blade on

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.390 
it's got a specialized rusting blade on
it<00:00:17.940> you<00:00:18.359> could<00:00:18.570> call<00:00:18.779> it<00:00:18.930> a<00:00:18.960> small<00:00:19.800> or<00:00:20.070> a<00:00:20.100> light

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
it you could call it a small or a light

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.370 
it you could call it a small or a light
rapier<00:00:21.000> blade<00:00:21.949> and<00:00:22.949> in<00:00:23.640> actual<00:00:24.060> fact<00:00:24.350> one<00:00:25.350> of

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
rapier blade and in actual fact one of

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.849 
rapier blade and in actual fact one of
the<00:00:25.590> things<00:00:25.830> that<00:00:26.070> people<00:00:27.199> sometimes<00:00:28.199> assume

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
the things that people sometimes assume

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.659 
the things that people sometimes assume
or<00:00:29.189> or<00:00:29.340> argue<00:00:30.179> for<00:00:30.420> is<00:00:30.660> that<00:00:31.460> making<00:00:32.460> the

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
or or argue for is that making the

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.100 
or or argue for is that making the
weapon<00:00:32.940> as<00:00:33.090> I've<00:00:33.210> mentioned<00:00:33.390> before<00:00:33.600> more

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
weapon as I've mentioned before more

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.560 
weapon as I've mentioned before more
specialized<00:00:34.680> somehow<00:00:35.160> makes<00:00:35.430> it<00:00:35.640> lesser<00:00:36.239> or

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
specialized somehow makes it lesser or

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.170 
specialized somehow makes it lesser or
less<00:00:36.899> good<00:00:37.230> okay<00:00:37.950> we're<00:00:38.190> inside<00:00:38.460> for<00:00:38.820> fact<00:00:39.000> if

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
less good okay we're inside for fact if

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.420 
less good okay we're inside for fact if
you<00:00:39.300> think<00:00:39.329> about<00:00:39.660> this<00:00:39.960> what<00:00:40.620> this<00:00:40.860> weapon<00:00:41.280> is

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
you think about this what this weapon is

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.610 
you think about this what this weapon is
is<00:00:41.760> specialized<00:00:42.690> for<00:00:42.809> thrusting<00:00:43.290> so<00:00:43.469> it's

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
is specialized for thrusting so it's

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.920 
is specialized for thrusting so it's
lighter<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.610> point<00:00:44.879> of<00:00:45.059> balance<00:00:45.270> is<00:00:45.629> closer

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
lighter the point of balance is closer

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.310 
lighter the point of balance is closer
to<00:00:46.079> my<00:00:46.320> hand<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:46.920> it's<00:00:47.670> narrower<00:00:48.600> so<00:00:49.170> it's

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
to my hand and it's narrower so it's

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.529 
to my hand and it's narrower so it's
going<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.620> go<00:00:49.739> into<00:00:50.219> a<00:00:50.250> target<00:00:50.820> more<00:00:51.180> easily

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
going to go into a target more easily

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.529 
going to go into a target more easily
and<00:00:51.840> come<00:00:52.199> out<00:00:52.350> again<00:00:52.530> more<00:00:52.829> easily<00:00:53.539> including

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
and come out again more easily including

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.090 
and come out again more easily including
penetrating<00:00:55.170> clothes<00:00:55.469> which<00:00:55.800> is<00:00:55.949> the

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
penetrating clothes which is the

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.740 
penetrating clothes which is the
important<00:00:56.550> factor<00:00:56.910> as<00:00:57.059> I've<00:00:57.570> mentioned

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
important factor as I've mentioned

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.080 
important factor as I've mentioned
before<00:00:57.989> during<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.559> Crimean<00:00:59.100> War<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.850> heavy

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
before during the Crimean War the heavy

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.000 
before during the Crimean War the heavy
winter<00:01:00.390> clothing<00:01:00.809> was<00:01:01.350> sometimes<00:01:01.770> difficult

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
winter clothing was sometimes difficult

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.780 
winter clothing was sometimes difficult
to<00:01:02.340> penetrate<00:01:02.489> by<00:01:03.180> its<00:01:03.420> swords<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:03.899> bayonets

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
to penetrate by its swords and bayonets

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.420 
to penetrate by its swords and bayonets
so<00:01:05.790> it's<00:01:06.270> got<00:01:06.479> better<00:01:06.659> penetration<00:01:07.350> and<00:01:07.710> it's

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
so it's got better penetration and it's

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.120 
so it's got better penetration and it's
more<00:01:08.850> nimble<00:01:09.450> it's<00:01:09.720> quicker<00:01:10.200> okay<00:01:10.890> so<00:01:10.950> I

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
more nimble it's quicker okay so I

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.359 
more nimble it's quicker okay so I
essentially<00:01:11.760> have<00:01:12.150> here<00:01:12.869> a<00:01:12.900> weapon<00:01:13.530> where<00:01:13.830> the

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
essentially have here a weapon where the

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.600 
essentially have here a weapon where the
officer<00:01:14.939> who<00:01:15.090> ordered<00:01:15.570> it<00:01:15.689> from<00:01:15.930> wilkinson

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
officer who ordered it from wilkinson

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.490 
officer who ordered it from wilkinson
probably<00:01:17.610> was<00:01:17.909> a<00:01:17.939> keen<00:01:18.360> loyal<00:01:18.750> fencer<00:01:19.290> and

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
probably was a keen loyal fencer and

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.910 
probably was a keen loyal fencer and
wanted<00:01:20.250> a<00:01:20.490> weapon<00:01:20.970> that<00:01:21.210> suited<00:01:21.960> his<00:01:22.259> style<00:01:22.740> of

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
wanted a weapon that suited his style of

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.450 
wanted a weapon that suited his style of
sword<00:01:23.250> way<00:01:23.580> more<00:01:24.270> than<00:01:24.479> a<00:01:24.570> typical<00:01:24.810> saber<00:01:25.460> and

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
sword way more than a typical saber and

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.460 
sword way more than a typical saber and
quite<00:01:27.060> obviously<00:01:27.540> with<00:01:27.780> this<00:01:27.900> he<00:01:28.140> didn't

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
quite obviously with this he didn't

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.499 
quite obviously with this he didn't
really<00:01:28.710> have<00:01:28.890> any<00:01:29.100> great<00:01:29.369> expectations<00:01:30.240> to<00:01:30.390> be

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
really have any great expectations to be

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.410 
really have any great expectations to be
cutting<00:01:30.990> in<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.229> opponent<00:01:31.710> he<00:01:32.250> wanted<00:01:32.729> to<00:01:32.970> he

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
cutting in the opponent he wanted to he

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.020 
cutting in the opponent he wanted to he
wanted<00:01:33.450> to<00:01:33.840> Parry<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:34.530> thrust<00:01:34.650> he<00:01:35.549> wanted<00:01:35.909> to

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
wanted to Parry and thrust he wanted to

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.210 
wanted to Parry and thrust he wanted to
stab<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.570> opponent<00:01:37.079> okay<00:01:37.439> and<00:01:37.979> that's

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
stab the opponent okay and that's

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.370 
stab the opponent okay and that's
absolutely<00:01:38.400> fine<00:01:39.030> if<00:01:39.450> you<00:01:39.780> want<00:01:40.049> to

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
absolutely fine if you want to

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.460 
absolutely fine if you want to
specialize<00:01:41.310> your<00:01:41.640> system<00:01:42.540> of<00:01:42.689> swordplay<00:01:43.020> on

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
specialize your system of swordplay on

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.039 
specialize your system of swordplay on
to<00:01:43.740> one<00:01:44.130> particular<00:01:44.490> aspect<00:01:44.939> and<00:01:45.479> really

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
to one particular aspect and really

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.370 
to one particular aspect and really
emphasize<00:01:46.200> that<00:01:46.700> then<00:01:47.700> you<00:01:48.540> know<00:01:48.689> you'll<00:01:48.960> you

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
emphasize that then you know you'll you

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.889 
emphasize that then you know you'll you
will<00:01:49.619> get<00:01:49.770> better<00:01:50.040> at<00:01:50.430> that<00:01:50.820> and<00:01:51.659> that

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
will get better at that and that

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.020 
will get better at that and that
particular<00:01:52.259> thing<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:52.920> there'll<00:01:53.880> be<00:01:53.939> a

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
particular thing and there'll be a

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.499 
particular thing and there'll be a
payoff<00:01:54.329> for<00:01:54.479> that<00:01:54.689> so<00:01:55.409> and<00:01:55.860> it's<00:01:56.670> not<00:01:57.060> always<00:01:57.360> a

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
payoff for that so and it's not always a

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.980 
payoff for that so and it's not always a
question<00:01:57.960> of<00:01:58.259> a<00:01:58.619> weapon<00:01:59.130> or<00:01:59.340> a<00:01:59.630> sword<00:02:00.630> fighting
