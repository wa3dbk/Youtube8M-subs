00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
on the tactics e4 pawn or another idea

on the tactics e4 pawn or another idea
behind<00:03:16.930> this<00:03:17.170> move<00:03:17.440> is<00:03:17.620> that<00:03:17.650> he'll<00:03:18.100> just<00:03:18.310> take

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:18.550 
behind this move is that he'll just take

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:20.790 
behind this move is that he'll just take
tonight<00:03:19.000> even<00:03:19.630> though<00:03:19.780> i<00:03:20.050> could<00:03:20.530> probably

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:20.800 
tonight even though i could probably

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.320 
tonight even though i could probably
recapture<00:03:21.430> with<00:03:21.640> queen<00:03:22.030> and<00:03:23.130> then<00:03:24.130> close<00:03:25.090> to

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:25.330 
recapture with queen and then close to

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.210 
recapture with queen and then close to
position<00:03:25.840> put<00:03:26.200> all<00:03:26.380> his<00:03:26.500> pawns<00:03:26.770> in<00:03:26.890> the<00:03:27.010> dark

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
position put all his pawns in the dark

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:32.730 
position put all his pawns in the dark
squares<00:03:28.590> and<00:03:30.720> prove<00:03:31.720> that<00:03:31.930> the<00:03:32.230> nights<00:03:32.440> are

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:32.740 
squares and prove that the nights are

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:35.550 
squares and prove that the nights are
actually<00:03:33.490> better<00:03:34.330> than<00:03:34.450> the<00:03:34.780> two<00:03:34.960> bishops<00:03:35.170> in

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
actually better than the two bishops in

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.380 
actually better than the two bishops in
the<00:03:36.150> pretty<00:03:37.150> close<00:03:37.420> positions<00:03:38.490> and<00:03:39.490> so<00:03:40.240> the

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
the pretty close positions and so the

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:46.860 
the pretty close positions and so the
game<00:03:41.020> continued<00:03:41.470> with<00:03:41.680> f3<00:03:44.190> maybe<00:03:45.510> maybe<00:03:46.510> to<00:03:46.840> a

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
game continued with f3 maybe maybe to a

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.930 
game continued with f3 maybe maybe to a

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:33.060 
lot of purposes first it fights for the

lot of purposes first it fights for the
controlling<00:06:33.600> center<00:06:34.790> so<00:06:35.790> it<00:06:36.210> prevents<00:06:36.630> this

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:37.020 
controlling center so it prevents this

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:44.140 
controlling center so it prevents this
movie<00:06:37.740> for<00:06:40.340> second<00:06:41.340> it<00:06:41.460> prevents<00:06:41.940> white<00:06:42.920> from

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:44.150 
movie for second it prevents white from

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:54.290 
being able to execute his main plan and

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:57.460 
being able to execute his main plan and
it<00:06:55.290> kind<00:06:55.530> of<00:06:55.590> makes<00:06:55.800> every<00:06:56.280> look<00:06:56.520> silly<00:06:56.820> right

00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:57.470 
it kind of makes every look silly right

00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:04.010 
it kind of makes every look silly right
so<00:06:58.640> has<00:06:59.640> to<00:07:00.170> kind<00:07:01.170> of<00:07:01.880> challenges<00:07:02.880> white<00:07:03.300> to

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:04.020 
so has to kind of challenges white to

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:07.970 
so has to kind of challenges white to
prove<00:07:04.290> that<00:07:04.350> the<00:07:05.190> move<00:07:05.400> f3<00:07:06.030> is<00:07:06.180> not<00:07:07.050> as<00:07:07.260> bad<00:07:07.920> as

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:07.980 
prove that the move f3 is not as bad as

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:12.860 
prove that the move f3 is not as bad as
it<00:07:08.250> looks<00:07:08.660> so<00:07:09.660> after<00:07:09.900> d5<00:07:11.090> this<00:07:12.090> is<00:07:12.240> how<00:07:12.420> the

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:12.870 
it looks so after d5 this is how the

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:18.830 
it looks so after d5 this is how the

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:31.790 
you take c5 which enters a very

you take c5 which enters a very

irregular pawn structure for compared to
most<00:07:40.410> of<00:07:40.590> the<00:07:40.740> openings<00:07:41.220> but<00:07:41.970> I<00:07:42.030> think<00:07:42.360> both

00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:43.520 
most of the openings but I think both

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:46.730 
most of the openings but I think both
sides<00:07:44.520> has<00:07:44.850> a<00:07:44.880> chance<00:07:45.300> to<00:07:45.450> win<00:07:45.750> or<00:07:46.320> gain<00:07:46.590> an
