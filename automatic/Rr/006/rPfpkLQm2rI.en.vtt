school<00:03:25.820> just<00:03:26.180> by<00:03:26.360> nature<00:03:26.810> a<00:03:26.840> little<00:03:27.140> bit<00:03:27.230> more

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
school just by nature a little bit more

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.330 
school just by nature a little bit more
conscious<00:03:29.750> of<00:03:30.140> their<00:03:30.350> upper<00:03:30.739> body<00:03:30.920> strength

conscious of their upper body strength

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:32.620 
conscious of their upper body strength
you<00:03:31.459> know<00:03:31.580> they're<00:03:31.730> big<00:03:31.910> benchpress<00:03:32.239> guys

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
you know they're big benchpress guys

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:34.210 
you know they're big benchpress guys
because<00:03:32.870> they<00:03:32.989> do<00:03:33.049> the<00:03:33.290> bench<00:03:33.560> every<00:03:33.799> single

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
because they do the bench every single

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.370 
because they do the bench every single
day<00:03:34.370> so<00:03:34.430> it's<00:03:35.360> really<00:03:35.840> getting<00:03:36.110> them<00:03:36.230> to

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
day so it's really getting them to

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:37.750 
day so it's really getting them to
understand<00:03:36.830> what<00:03:37.130> it<00:03:37.160> means<00:03:37.370> to<00:03:37.549> be

field<00:03:40.070> and<00:03:40.330> that<00:03:41.330> is<00:03:41.390> adjustment<00:03:42.049> for<00:03:42.170> guys<00:03:42.290> is

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:42.610 
field and that is adjustment for guys is

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:46.350 
field and that is adjustment for guys is
understanding<00:03:43.610> that<00:03:43.760> the<00:03:44.510> weight<00:03:44.780> room<00:03:45.160> is

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:46.360 
understanding that the weight room is

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.330 
understanding that the weight room is
really<00:03:47.360> what<00:03:47.600> where<00:03:47.900> we<00:03:48.140> build<00:03:48.500> strength<00:03:49.070> that

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
really what where we build strength that

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:50.740 
really what where we build strength that
can<00:03:49.519> be<00:03:49.610> applied<00:03:49.910> on<00:03:50.269> the<00:03:50.390> football<00:03:50.720> field

sake of lifting weights it has to be

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:56.470 
sake of lifting weights it has to be
applicable<00:03:54.650> to<00:03:55.519> what<00:03:55.700> they<00:03:55.850> do<00:03:55.910> on<00:03:56.120> a<00:03:56.150> football
