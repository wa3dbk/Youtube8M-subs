00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.250
 the next hairstyle is the thick dutt 

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:10.349
 we do it today for ponies carrier 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:12.540
 that you look what I do with that 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:16.289
 pony we just stand here now 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:23.100
 even a pony before and just the 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:24.689
 crest right then always and style came 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:29.580
 or you can also hold a hairpin 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:32.269
 then take off here once the pony 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.269
 to share 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.040
 But the whole thing will make space 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.559
 we first head 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.329
 so that we do not get in the way 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.660
 and others, and hair of the sock with 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.660
 take in pure 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:56.760
 that is theoretically the short one 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.690
 But pony is flat on the head then 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.399
 we have to take it on both sides 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:05.129
 so that we are really tight and tight 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.510
 so that the helmet will fit here afterwards 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.110
 it'll look a bit thick right now 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:14.280
 but that's because the doll is here 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.900
 no pony has the pony wearer will that 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.600
 all subsequently be really nice flat 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:23.250
 then you do not do it that way either 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:25.200
 best in the process so you can do that 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.390
 may braided me for example there 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.280
 You can also check it out in the evening if you are early 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.530
 out in the evening must make of the 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.840
 mother of the sister of the 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.610
 girlfriend 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:39.329
 you could do that in the evening if 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:41.040
 that stops because that should actually that 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.829
 maybe we can sleep ours 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:47.310
 our horses sometimes even in the evening 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:50.009
 the crowd already and hope then 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:55.040
 in the morning just that they are not the 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:55.040
 neck over the south ring trummer 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.920
 I am heaps tournament again today 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.110
 been seen 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.210
 Today I have the classic again 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.930
 mistake it became a doping 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.780
 used 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:12.970
 that's great, but then 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.010
 was made a hair gum pure 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.660
 and that 's it then ridden 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.940
 galloped and jumped and made 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:22.540
 and done and then sits the bush 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:26.110
 down here later because that's great 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:30.910
 Super super important to bring the pressure 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:34.870
 to make it very important 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:37.540
 with needles simply fix in the pillow 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:43.690
 in the south ring in the hair and 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:46.030
 Depending on the density of the 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:49.510
 hair how many hair one has enough 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:51.790
 really so three to six pieces 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:55.360
 I would say now I'm pulling now 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:57.040
 and he stays there he shakes me 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.600
 I still have a bad feeling that is 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.980
 the good if you do it then knows 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.030
 okay, okay, now I have a good one 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.220
 feel now i have a bad one 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:06.220
 feeling that is so with the most important 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.780
 that one makes the ring firm but 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.190
 you spread your hair well 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.650
 actually a very good feeling if 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:14.260
 you feel it over yourself once 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:17.610
 the hair or whether he is pillow 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:20.350
 is that actually feels pretty good 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:23.470
 then pull your hair apart 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:27.280
 lichtenhagen turn and it once 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:30.340
 to chat and if necessary again 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:33.160
 with a hair even fix one 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.830
 Now you can either be classical now 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:40.000
 put all drum and stuck with one 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:41.830
 You can brace it while braiding it 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.430
 Let's do it now how bad that is 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:44.080
 once 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.239
 we put the hair here once beautiful 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.549
 So that the hair elastic also good 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:54.310
 Tuck the hair all over here 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:56.650
 a direction all hair share again 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:04:02.260
 in three strands from 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:06.519
 then braid the whole thing to the side 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:09.340
 There are also these networks 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:11.670
 You can also put it there 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:14.909
 then it will last 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:17.410
 you can mark classic h mains electricity 

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:19.150
 very nice are also so small hairpin 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.430
 you can do it with pearls 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.050
 Do it without hairnet if you are now 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:26.620
 says so where do I find that quite nice though 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:29.229
 uli h networks go really not so 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:31.750
 Now we have the braid here 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:33.190
 Now we just go for the hair tie 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:39.760
 hide on it 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:41.800
 hero and around here and can do the whole thing 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.860
 so that a hairpin or hak lama can 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.010
 then you just pick up here 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:49.240
 moor 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:54.699
 just then the strands always put the 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:56.440
 here and make that here and 

00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:58.830
 fix the whole one again 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.830
 hairpin 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:07.930
 it can watch it here came for the 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:13.599
 hairpin once here back differently here 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:16.629
 then only gets correct right now 

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:17.979
 Nice kink and a nice name 

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:21.930
 would be the class for the 

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:21.930
 surfaces finished
