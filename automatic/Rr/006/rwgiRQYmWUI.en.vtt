00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.370
 what does this game itself represent this 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.610
 something like 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:55.140
 slender but here goes the maze here 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.440
 the principle here also needs to be found 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:01.160
 notes with all kinds of threats here 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.480
 There are such zombies key 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.939
 for some reason I was reminded of zombies from 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:11.600
 half-life 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:11.600
 Casco Coupon 1 note 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:25.030
 he breathes a thousand i understand 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:30.520
 he just breathes but it somehow 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:38.710
 scares here this here I was afraid u what is this 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:47.580
 sounds yes ok note and some 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:54.390
 there is a dead end there is a dead end why the lights shine 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:54.390
 will not meet another will respond perfectly 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:08.319
 what kind of beast is it here 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:35.200
 incomprehensible passage I don't like it 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:40.000
 guys damn I somehow thought so that 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:44.079
 only one more will close behind me now 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:47.980
 note by the way if i'm not mistaken then these 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:55.410
 monsters they are deaf ie if their 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:03:07.599
 will see that you can stop and stand about 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:12.569

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:15.069
 describe normal relax 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:17.440
 This is not the way guys can 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:19.239
 trust honestly this game these 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.310
 arrows usually never lead 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:21.940
 good and here for some reason all those are mine 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.880
 nothing 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:34.569

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:39.010
 so many things can not because I 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.680

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:08.220

 the deaf said he was blind 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:47.420
 they said that he was blind not deaf type 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:49.940
 that he is only aware of the sound 

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:56.200

00:04:49.940 --> 00:05:08.470
