gallons you want them to filter each of
these<00:01:14.880> can<00:01:15.210> filter<00:01:15.420> I<00:01:15.570> believe<00:01:15.840> 2,500<00:01:16.619> to

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
these can filter I believe 2,500 to

2,600<00:01:17.009> gallons<00:01:17.759> of<00:01:17.939> water<00:01:18.259> so<00:01:19.259> what<00:01:19.439> I<00:01:19.470> did<00:01:19.710> was

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
2,600 gallons of water so what I did was

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.800 
2,600 gallons of water so what I did was
I<00:01:19.979> started<00:01:20.040> by<00:01:20.460> drilling<00:01:20.759> holes<00:01:21.090> in<00:01:21.750> the

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
I started by drilling holes in the

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.440 
I started by drilling holes in the
bottom<00:01:22.560> of<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.740> bucket<00:01:22.920> and<00:01:23.280> I<00:01:23.909> tap<00:01:24.180> these

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
bottom of the bucket and I tap these

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.080 
bottom of the bucket and I tap these
through<00:01:24.840> they<00:01:25.439> come<00:01:25.710> with<00:01:25.920> this<00:01:26.130> hardware<00:01:26.430> so

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
through they come with this hardware so

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.210 
through they come with this hardware so
it's<00:01:27.360> it's<00:01:27.659> threaded<00:01:28.140> with<00:01:28.409> this<00:01:28.680> nipple<00:01:28.950> here

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
it's it's threaded with this nipple here

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.530 
it's it's threaded with this nipple here
and<00:01:29.400> you<00:01:29.490> place<00:01:29.820> it<00:01:29.850> through<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.270> hole<00:01:30.390> that

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
and you place it through the hole that

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.270 
and you place it through the hole that
you<00:01:30.659> drilled<00:01:30.930> and<00:01:31.079> then<00:01:31.500> you<00:01:31.619> just<00:01:31.799> tighten<00:01:32.009> on

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
you drilled and then you just tighten on

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.640 
you drilled and then you just tighten on
that's<00:01:32.909> nut<00:01:33.150> here<00:01:33.450> in<00:01:33.509> it<00:01:33.630> it<00:01:34.020> tightens<00:01:34.439> the

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
that's nut here in it it tightens the

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.850 
that's nut here in it it tightens the
filter<00:01:34.979> down<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.400> bottom<00:01:35.670> of<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.820> bucket

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
filter down to the bottom of the bucket

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.359 
filter down to the bottom of the bucket
then<00:01:37.860> you<00:01:38.040> take<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.670> lid<00:01:38.909> from<00:01:39.810> one<00:01:40.020> of<00:01:40.140> them

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 
then you take the lid from one of them

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:43.880 
then you take the lid from one of them
you<00:01:41.369> place<00:01:41.640> it<00:01:42.350> before<00:01:43.350> you<00:01:43.439> actually<00:01:43.590> put<00:01:43.860> the

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
you place it before you actually put the

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.880 
you place it before you actually put the
filters<00:01:44.280> in<00:01:44.490> you<00:01:44.939> drill<00:01:45.180> your<00:01:45.210> holes<00:01:45.509> and<00:01:45.890> then

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
filters in you drill your holes and then

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.580 
filters in you drill your holes and then
you<00:01:47.009> take<00:01:47.549> a<00:01:47.579> marker<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.210> you<00:01:48.390> you<00:01:49.079> dab<00:01:49.380> a

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
you take a marker and you you dab a

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.620 
you take a marker and you you dab a
little<00:01:49.619> dots<00:01:50.040> onto<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.700> lid<00:01:50.970> below<00:01:51.299> so<00:01:51.570> you

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
little dots onto the lid below so you

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.160 
little dots onto the lid below so you
can<00:01:51.720> see<00:01:52.079> exactly<00:01:52.530> where<00:01:52.829> it<00:01:52.920> lines<00:01:53.130> up<00:01:53.340> and

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
can see exactly where it lines up and

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:01.940 
can see exactly where it lines up and
then<00:01:55.170> when<00:01:55.320> you<00:01:55.409> put<00:01:55.560> your<00:01:55.710> filters<00:01:56.070> in<00:02:00.860> get<00:02:01.860> it

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
then when you put your filters in get it

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.609 
then when you put your filters in get it
lined<00:02:02.130> up<00:02:02.280> here<00:02:02.520> find<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.090> holes<00:02:03.350> these<00:02:04.350> will

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
lined up here find the holes these will

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.969 
lined up here find the holes these will
line<00:02:04.770> up<00:02:04.920> perfectly<00:02:05.479> through<00:02:06.479> the<00:02:06.600> holes<00:02:06.979> so

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
line up perfectly through the holes so

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.279 
line up perfectly through the holes so
then<00:02:08.160> what<00:02:08.340> you<00:02:08.459> do<00:02:08.610> is<00:02:08.640> you<00:02:08.819> take<00:02:09.030> this<00:02:09.270> set<00:02:10.140> up

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
then what you do is you take this set up

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.360 
then what you do is you take this set up
you<00:02:10.530> put<00:02:11.340> it<00:02:11.459> on<00:02:11.550> top<00:02:11.819> of<00:02:12.000> another<00:02:12.180> bucket

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
you put it on top of another bucket

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.600 
you put it on top of another bucket
and<00:02:14.569> you<00:02:15.569> fill<00:02:15.840> your<00:02:16.020> top<00:02:16.290> bucket<00:02:16.770> with<00:02:17.280> your

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
and you fill your top bucket with your

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:18.830 
and you fill your top bucket with your
dirty<00:02:17.850> water

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
dirty water

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.680 
dirty water
these<00:02:19.470> drip<00:02:19.890> very<00:02:20.310> very<00:02:20.610> slowly<00:02:21.000> I<00:02:21.180> think<00:02:21.540> it

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
these drip very very slowly I think it

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.760 
these drip very very slowly I think it
might<00:02:21.930> do<00:02:22.590> about<00:02:22.950> a<00:02:22.980> liter<00:02:23.340> 2<00:02:23.790> per<00:02:24.330> hour<00:02:24.709> so<00:02:25.709> if

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
might do about a liter 2 per hour so if

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.260 
might do about a liter 2 per hour so if
you<00:02:25.860> fill<00:02:26.069> this<00:02:26.190> whole<00:02:26.400> thing<00:02:26.670> up<00:02:26.880> it'll<00:02:27.120> take

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
you fill this whole thing up it'll take

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:28.790 
you fill this whole thing up it'll take
a<00:02:27.300> couple<00:02:27.390> hours<00:02:27.750> to<00:02:28.110> drain<00:02:28.350> the<00:02:28.440> whole<00:02:28.530> thing

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
a couple hours to drain the whole thing

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.430 
a couple hours to drain the whole thing
down<00:02:29.120> but<00:02:30.120> you<00:02:30.420> do<00:02:30.569> it<00:02:30.690> before<00:02:30.810> you<00:02:30.959> go<00:02:31.140> to<00:02:31.200> bed

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
down but you do it before you go to bed

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.830 
down but you do it before you go to bed
next<00:02:31.980> morning<00:02:32.250> you<00:02:32.340> wake<00:02:32.370> up<00:02:32.550> and<00:02:32.910> your<00:02:33.540> bottom

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
next morning you wake up and your bottom

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.690 
next morning you wake up and your bottom
bucket<00:02:34.170> will<00:02:34.290> be<00:02:34.410> full<00:02:34.620> of<00:02:34.770> 5<00:02:34.950> gallons<00:02:35.489> of

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
bucket will be full of 5 gallons of

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.680 
bucket will be full of 5 gallons of
completely<00:02:36.270> purified<00:02:36.690> water<00:02:38.390> some<00:02:39.390> people

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
completely purified water some people

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.140 
completely purified water some people
and<00:02:39.930> I<00:02:40.500> am<00:02:40.620> one<00:02:40.770> of<00:02:40.800> them<00:02:40.950> will<00:02:41.640> then<00:02:41.819> tap<00:02:42.120> the

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
and I am one of them will then tap the

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.880 
and I am one of them will then tap the
bottom<00:02:42.540> bucket<00:02:44.030> with<00:02:45.030> one<00:02:45.630> of<00:02:45.750> these<00:02:45.870> kind<00:02:46.800> of

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
bottom bucket with one of these kind of

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.780 
bottom bucket with one of these kind of
coffee<00:02:47.160> dispenser<00:02:48.380> spigots<00:02:49.380> so<00:02:50.040> in<00:02:50.310> my<00:02:50.459> bottom

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
coffee dispenser spigots so in my bottom

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:56.120 
coffee dispenser spigots so in my bottom
bucket<00:02:51.180> I<00:02:51.360> tapped<00:02:52.110> a<00:02:52.230> hole<00:02:52.410> here<00:02:52.910> and<00:02:54.950> you<00:02:55.950> then

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
bucket I tapped a hole here and you then

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.460 
bucket I tapped a hole here and you then
thread<00:02:56.489> this<00:02:56.760> into<00:02:57.510> that<00:02:57.660> hole<00:02:57.840> now<00:02:58.110> I<00:02:58.140> have<00:02:58.380> it

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
thread this into that hole now I have it

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.440 
thread this into that hole now I have it
removed<00:02:58.769> for<00:02:59.130> storage<00:02:59.489> but<00:02:59.880> you<00:02:59.940> thread<00:03:00.269> this

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
removed for storage but you thread this

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.050 
removed for storage but you thread this
into<00:03:00.780> that<00:03:00.870> hole<00:03:01.140> and<00:03:01.380> then<00:03:02.220> you<00:03:02.430> can<00:03:02.640> dispense

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
into that hole and then you can dispense

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.150 
into that hole and then you can dispense
your<00:03:03.120> water<00:03:03.450> from<00:03:03.780> the<00:03:03.930> bucket<00:03:04.319> makes<00:03:04.980> it<00:03:05.100> a

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
your water from the bucket makes it a

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.759 
your water from the bucket makes it a
little<00:03:05.250> bit<00:03:05.459> easier<00:03:05.959> while<00:03:06.959> I<00:03:06.989> have<00:03:07.410> these<00:03:07.560> in

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
little bit easier while I have these in

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:09.530 
little bit easier while I have these in
storage<00:03:08.160> though<00:03:08.370> I<00:03:08.400> just<00:03:08.519> take<00:03:08.880> some<00:03:08.910> tape<00:03:09.269> and

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
storage though I just take some tape and

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.170 
storage though I just take some tape and
I<00:03:09.600> put<00:03:09.810> it<00:03:09.900> over<00:03:09.959> the<00:03:10.170> holes<00:03:10.350> here<00:03:10.760> as<00:03:11.760> well<00:03:12.030> as

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
I put it over the holes here as well as

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.729 
I put it over the holes here as well as
the<00:03:12.300> holes<00:03:12.480> in<00:03:12.690> the<00:03:12.780> top<00:03:12.810> of<00:03:12.989> this<00:03:13.230> bucket<00:03:13.650> and

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
the holes in the top of this bucket and

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:16.280 
the holes in the top of this bucket and
the<00:03:14.459> nice<00:03:14.640> thing<00:03:14.880> is<00:03:14.910> is<00:03:15.209> that<00:03:15.360> it<00:03:15.780> all<00:03:15.930> stores

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
the nice thing is is that it all stores

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.900 
the nice thing is is that it all stores
away<00:03:16.470> pretty<00:03:16.829> easily<00:03:16.920> so<00:03:17.459> this<00:03:17.610> is<00:03:17.730> the<00:03:17.790> one

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
away pretty easily so this is the one

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.420 
away pretty easily so this is the one
with<00:03:18.000> the<00:03:18.090> filters<00:03:18.450> in<00:03:18.600> it<00:03:18.980> put<00:03:19.980> it<00:03:20.070> inside<00:03:20.370> of

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
with the filters in it put it inside of

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.539 
with the filters in it put it inside of
your<00:03:20.670> empty<00:03:21.000> one<00:03:22.010> take<00:03:23.010> your<00:03:23.220> lid<00:03:23.370> with<00:03:23.519> the

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
your empty one take your lid with the

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:26.630 
your empty one take your lid with the
holes<00:03:23.850> put<00:03:24.269> it<00:03:24.420> on<00:03:24.570> first<00:03:24.840> and<00:03:25.290> if<00:03:26.190> you<00:03:26.400> want

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
holes put it on first and if you want

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.390 
holes put it on first and if you want
grab<00:03:27.630> yourself<00:03:28.019> another<00:03:28.230> lid<00:03:28.500> without<00:03:28.920> holes

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
grab yourself another lid without holes

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.210 
grab yourself another lid without holes
so<00:03:30.180> that<00:03:30.209> you<00:03:30.450> can<00:03:30.630> keep<00:03:31.140> that<00:03:31.410> bottom<00:03:31.799> bucket

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
so that you can keep that bottom bucket

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.090 
so that you can keep that bottom bucket
clean<00:03:32.790> once<00:03:33.120> you<00:03:33.239> get<00:03:33.360> it<00:03:33.450> cleaned<00:03:33.690> out<00:03:33.840> and<00:03:34.709> it

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
clean once you get it cleaned out and it

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:36.530 
clean once you get it cleaned out and it
all<00:03:35.190> stores<00:03:35.549> away<00:03:35.670> in<00:03:35.880> one<00:03:36.060> nice<00:03:36.269> little

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
all stores away in one nice little

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.920 
all stores away in one nice little
little<00:03:37.079> system<00:03:37.530> here<00:03:37.560> so<00:03:38.519> not<00:03:39.269> too<00:03:39.480> bad<00:03:39.690> I

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
little system here so not too bad I

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.860 
little system here so not too bad I
think<00:03:39.989> all<00:03:40.500> in<00:03:40.650> all<00:03:40.739> I<00:03:40.799> spent<00:03:41.359> 50<00:03:42.359> maybe<00:03:42.600> 60

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
think all in all I spent 50 maybe 60

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.020 
think all in all I spent 50 maybe 60
dollars<00:03:43.410> once<00:03:44.250> we<00:03:44.430> bought<00:03:44.579> the<00:03:44.760> various
