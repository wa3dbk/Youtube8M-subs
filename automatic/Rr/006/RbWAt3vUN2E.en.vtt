by showing you the difference between a

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.360 
by showing you the difference between a
working<00:00:08.849> trot<00:00:09.150> and<00:00:09.360> a<00:00:09.510> collected<00:00:10.050> trot<00:00:10.370> now

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
working trot and a collected trot now

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.249 
working trot and a collected trot now
you<00:00:11.429> cannot<00:00:11.849> have<00:00:12.210> a<00:00:12.240> good<00:00:12.660> collected<00:00:13.110> trot

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
you cannot have a good collected trot

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.440 
you cannot have a good collected trot
without<00:00:13.679> a<00:00:13.710> good<00:00:13.950> working<00:00:14.340> truck<00:00:14.610> the

without a good working truck the
collected<00:00:15.809> trot<00:00:15.900> is<00:00:16.109> built<00:00:16.410> out<00:00:16.560> of<00:00:17.160> the

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
collected trot is built out of the

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.980 
collected trot is built out of the
working<00:00:17.699> trot<00:00:17.970> and<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.390> horse<00:00:18.570> develops

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
working trot and the horse develops

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.689 
working trot and the horse develops
enough<00:00:19.230> muscle<00:00:19.590> as<00:00:19.830> you<00:00:19.920> see<00:00:20.130> with<00:00:20.279> this<00:00:20.460> one

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
enough muscle as you see with this one

up underneath me now notice here that
there's<00:00:39.809> no<00:00:40.020> difference<00:00:40.350> between<00:00:40.710> in<00:00:41.309> the

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
there's no difference between in the

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.880 
there's no difference between in the
rhythm<00:00:41.670> between<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.210> working<00:00:42.809> trot<00:00:43.110> and<00:00:43.350> the

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
rhythm between the working trot and the

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.979 
rhythm between the working trot and the
collected<00:00:44.430> trot<00:00:44.610> see<00:00:44.940> how<00:00:45.030> he<00:00:45.090> elevates<00:00:45.780> is

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
collected trot see how he elevates is

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.200 
collected trot see how he elevates is
forehand<00:00:46.590> but<00:00:47.070> is<00:00:47.190> coming<00:00:47.399> through<00:00:47.789> exactly

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
forehand but is coming through exactly

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.150 
forehand but is coming through exactly
the<00:00:48.450> same<00:00:48.510> degree<00:00:48.930> in<00:00:49.350> front<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:49.829> back<00:00:49.980> now

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
the same degree in front and back now

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.350 
the same degree in front and back now
remember<00:00:50.520> this<00:00:50.610> is<00:00:50.760> a<00:00:50.789> horse<00:00:51.000> it's<00:00:51.180> just

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
remember this is a horse it's just

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.389 
remember this is a horse it's just
beginning<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:52.050> learn<00:00:52.170> collection<00:00:52.680> so<00:00:52.860> just

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
beginning to learn collection so just

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.369 
beginning to learn collection so just
beginning<00:00:53.850> stages<00:00:54.149> so<00:00:54.690> I<00:00:54.719> don't<00:00:54.930> expect<00:00:55.230> them

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
beginning stages so I don't expect them

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.319 
beginning stages so I don't expect them
to<00:00:55.440> hold<00:00:55.739> this<00:00:55.949> for<00:00:56.219> very<00:00:56.370> long<00:00:56.670> if<00:00:57.030> this<00:00:57.180> is

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
to hold this for very long if this is

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:58.580 
to hold this for very long if this is
how<00:00:57.480> I<00:00:57.510> would<00:00:57.629> school<00:00:57.989> them<00:00:58.109> even<00:00:58.350> if<00:00:58.469> I

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
how I would school them even if I

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.389 
how I would school them even if I
weren't<00:00:59.250> just<00:00:59.550> doing<00:01:00.149> this<00:01:00.329> example<00:01:00.960> for<00:01:01.199> you

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:01.399 
weren't just doing this example for you

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:03.560 
weren't just doing this example for you
in<00:01:02.399> fact<00:01:02.550> this<00:01:02.760> has<00:01:02.879> happens<00:01:03.180> to<00:01:03.300> be<00:01:03.449> an

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
in fact this has happens to be an

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:04.789 
in fact this has happens to be an
example<00:01:03.899> that<00:01:04.140> someone<00:01:04.350> took<00:01:04.589> of<00:01:04.680> me

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
example that someone took of me

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.859 
example that someone took of me
schooling<00:01:05.129> this<00:01:05.250> horse<00:01:05.460> so<00:01:05.700> it<00:01:06.299> wasn't<00:01:06.630> meant

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
schooling this horse so it wasn't meant

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.420 
schooling this horse so it wasn't meant
to<00:01:06.960> be<00:01:07.049> this<00:01:07.260> particularly<00:01:07.890> but<00:01:08.040> I<00:01:08.100> saw<00:01:08.369> the

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
to be this particularly but I saw the

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.859 
to be this particularly but I saw the
footage<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:08.939> thought<00:01:09.119> this<00:01:09.240> might<00:01:09.420> be<00:01:09.479> a<00:01:09.630> good

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
footage and thought this might be a good

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.960 
footage and thought this might be a good
example<00:01:10.229> for<00:01:10.409> everyone<00:01:10.799> to<00:01:10.890> see<00:01:11.100> so<00:01:11.729> you<00:01:11.760> can

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
example for everyone to see so you can

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.580 
example for everyone to see so you can
see<00:01:12.150> how<00:01:12.299> here<00:01:12.600> in<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.840> working<00:01:13.170> gauge<00:01:13.350> look

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
see how here in the working gauge look

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.289 
see how here in the working gauge look
how<00:01:13.680> clearly<00:01:14.159> defined<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.880> musculature

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
how clearly defined the musculature

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.719 
how clearly defined the musculature
across<00:01:15.780> his<00:01:16.020> neck<00:01:16.290> is<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:16.740> it<00:01:17.159> crosses<00:01:17.340> back

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
across his neck is and it crosses back

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.280 
across his neck is and it crosses back
this<00:01:17.909> horse<00:01:18.150> you<00:01:18.270> can<00:01:18.420> clearly<00:01:18.689> see<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.080> ball

I lost in forward motion I gained in

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.160 
I lost in forward motion I gained in
elevation<00:01:32.670> but<00:01:33.119> notice<00:01:33.390> that<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.630> diagonal

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
elevation but notice that the diagonal

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.350 
elevation but notice that the diagonal
pairs<00:01:34.439> are<00:01:34.650> still<00:01:34.890> moving<00:01:35.130> on<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.729> same<00:01:35.909> plane

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
pairs are still moving on the same plane

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.719 
pairs are still moving on the same plane
that<00:01:36.689> is<00:01:37.470> they're<00:01:37.710> swinging<00:01:38.070> through<00:01:38.400> to<00:01:38.640> the

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
that is they're swinging through to the

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.399 
that is they're swinging through to the
same<00:01:38.970> degree<00:01:39.180> now<00:01:39.600> they're<00:01:39.780> just<00:01:39.960> lifting

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
same degree now they're just lifting

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:41.929 
same degree now they're just lifting
more<00:01:40.619> and<00:01:40.829> you<00:01:40.890> can<00:01:41.070> clearly<00:01:41.340> see<00:01:41.460> how<00:01:41.790> his

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
more and you can clearly see how his

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.899 
more and you can clearly see how his
forehand<00:01:42.390> elevated<00:01:43.250> this<00:01:44.250> is<00:01:44.430> a<00:01:44.460> horse<00:01:44.729> that

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
forehand elevated this is a horse that

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.179 
forehand elevated this is a horse that
by<00:01:45.060> nature<00:01:45.390> was<00:01:45.750> built<00:01:46.020> quite<00:01:46.259> downhill<00:01:46.890> so<00:01:47.100> it

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
by nature was built quite downhill so it

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.219 
by nature was built quite downhill so it
took<00:01:47.340> quite<00:01:47.460> a<00:01:47.549> bit<00:01:47.610> of<00:01:47.759> dressage<00:01:48.090> work<00:01:48.329> to<00:01:49.020> get

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
took quite a bit of dressage work to get

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.960 
took quite a bit of dressage work to get
him<00:01:49.409> to<00:01:49.530> come<00:01:49.740> through<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:50.189> way<00:01:50.310> you<00:01:50.369> now<00:01:50.640> see

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
him to come through the way you now see

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.300 
him to come through the way you now see
him<00:01:51.259> so<00:01:52.259> let's<00:01:52.470> take<00:01:52.619> another<00:01:52.740> look<00:01:53.070> I'm<00:01:53.220> going

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
him so let's take another look I'm going

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.800 
him so let's take another look I'm going
to<00:01:53.369> play<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:53.670> same<00:01:53.880> clip<00:01:54.149> a<00:01:54.180> few<00:01:54.420> times<00:01:54.659> so

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
to play the same clip a few times so

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.350 
to play the same clip a few times so
that<00:01:54.869> you<00:01:55.079> can<00:01:55.229> all<00:01:55.350> study<00:01:55.649> it<00:01:55.799> and<00:01:55.890> analyze<00:01:56.040> it

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
that you can all study it and analyze it

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.789 
that you can all study it and analyze it
so<00:01:57.360> here<00:01:57.540> I<00:01:57.570> am<00:01:57.750> going<00:01:57.899> back<00:01:58.110> into<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.439> working

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
so here I am going back into the working

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.620 
so here I am going back into the working
trot<00:01:59.100> and<00:01:59.369> even<00:01:59.729> here<00:01:59.969> you<00:02:00.090> can<00:02:00.240> see<00:02:00.390> that<00:02:00.540> he

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
trot and even here you can see that he

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.510 
trot and even here you can see that he
speeds<00:02:00.960> up<00:02:01.170> a<00:02:01.290> little<00:02:01.530> bit<00:02:01.649> too<00:02:01.890> fast<00:02:02.130> right

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
speeds up a little bit too fast right

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.830 
speeds up a little bit too fast right
here<00:02:02.790> and<00:02:02.909> actually<00:02:03.180> gets<00:02:03.329> a<00:02:03.420> little<00:02:03.509> bit<00:02:03.719> on

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
here and actually gets a little bit on

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.510 
here and actually gets a little bit on
his<00:02:03.930> forehand<00:02:04.290> then<00:02:04.469> he<00:02:04.530> slows<00:02:04.829> down<00:02:04.860> and<00:02:05.399> gets

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
his forehand then he slows down and gets

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.459 
his forehand then he slows down and gets
back<00:02:05.700> deep<00:02:05.969> underneath<00:02:06.329> himself<00:02:06.810> but<00:02:07.290> once

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
back deep underneath himself but once

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.290 
back deep underneath himself but once
again<00:02:07.740> look<00:02:08.310> at<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.580> engagement<00:02:09.149> of<00:02:09.179> the

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
again look at the engagement of the

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.729 
again look at the engagement of the
top-line<00:02:09.720> muscles<00:02:10.140> now<00:02:10.259> this<00:02:10.410> is<00:02:10.530> a<00:02:10.590> horse

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
top-line muscles now this is a horse

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.280 
top-line muscles now this is a horse
that<00:02:10.800> was<00:02:11.009> also<00:02:11.280> broken<00:02:11.730> a<00:02:11.760> little<00:02:11.970> bit

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
that was also broken a little bit

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.039 
that was also broken a little bit
third<00:02:12.439> vertebrae<00:02:13.120> early<00:02:14.120> on<00:02:14.269> his<00:02:14.510> training<00:02:14.780> so

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:15.049 
third vertebrae early on his training so

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:17.020 
third vertebrae early on his training so
I<00:02:15.079> have<00:02:15.560> to<00:02:15.680> work<00:02:15.799> around<00:02:15.980> that<00:02:16.250> a<00:02:16.609> little<00:02:16.909> bit

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
I have to work around that a little bit

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.520 
I have to work around that a little bit
in<00:02:17.180> my<00:02:17.329> contact<00:02:17.840> you'll<00:02:18.079> notice<00:02:18.319> that<00:02:18.409> I'm

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530

in my contact you'll notice that I'm
riding<00:02:18.799> a<00:02:18.890> double<00:02:19.189> bridle<00:02:19.549> but<00:02:19.640> notice<00:02:20.000> that

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
riding a double bridle but notice that

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.030 
riding a double bridle but notice that
this<00:02:20.269> Kerr<00:02:20.599> brain<00:02:20.900> is<00:02:21.049> completely<00:02:21.590> relaxed

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
this Kerr brain is completely relaxed

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.709 
this Kerr brain is completely relaxed
because<00:02:22.129> I<00:02:22.280> would<00:02:22.670> just<00:02:22.849> never<00:02:23.180> need<00:02:23.420> that<00:02:23.450> on

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:23.719 
because I would just never need that on

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:25.330 
because I would just never need that on
this<00:02:23.870> horse<00:02:24.049> or<00:02:24.200> at<00:02:24.560> least<00:02:24.739> not<00:02:24.890> for<00:02:25.010> this<00:02:25.129> work

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
this horse or at least not for this work

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.280 
this horse or at least not for this work
so<00:02:25.819> notice<00:02:26.060> how<00:02:26.180> I<00:02:26.209> sit<00:02:26.659> once<00:02:26.870> again<00:02:27.140> he

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
so notice how I sit once again he

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.069 
so notice how I sit once again he
elevates<00:02:27.769> right<00:02:27.980> up<00:02:28.129> underneath<00:02:28.430> me

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:29.079 
elevates right up underneath me

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:31.270 
elevates right up underneath me
cause<00:02:30.079> a<00:02:30.109> little<00:02:30.439> moment<00:02:30.739> there<00:02:30.769> he<00:02:31.040> kind<00:02:31.220> of

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
cause a little moment there he kind of

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.830 
cause a little moment there he kind of
has<00:02:31.430> a<00:02:31.459> little<00:02:31.640> hesitant<00:02:32.090> step<00:02:32.390> that's<00:02:32.599> very

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
has a little hesitant step that's very

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.630 
has a little hesitant step that's very
normal<00:02:33.170> bringing<00:02:33.680> horses<00:02:33.799> into<00:02:34.159> this<00:02:34.370> level

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
normal bringing horses into this level

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.789 
normal bringing horses into this level
of<00:02:34.730> work<00:02:34.909> but<00:02:35.900> once<00:02:36.079> again<00:02:36.319> you<00:02:36.439> can<00:02:36.560> clearly

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:36.799 
of work but once again you can clearly

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:38.710 
of work but once again you can clearly
see<00:02:37.069> how<00:02:37.220> he<00:02:37.280> elevates<00:02:37.790> the<00:02:37.970> pole<00:02:38.180> stays<00:02:38.510> the

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
see how he elevates the pole stays the

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.039 
see how he elevates the pole stays the
highest<00:02:39.049> part<00:02:39.319> there<00:02:39.590> and<00:02:40.359> what<00:02:41.359> I<00:02:41.389> lost<00:02:41.750> in

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:42.049 
highest part there and what I lost in

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:44.080 
highest part there and what I lost in
forward<00:02:42.530> swing<00:02:42.889> I<00:02:43.189> gained<00:02:43.519> an<00:02:43.700> upward<00:02:44.060> lift

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
forward swing I gained an upward lift

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.750 
forward swing I gained an upward lift
equally<00:02:44.989> between<00:02:45.170> the<00:02:45.470> two<00:02:45.829> sets<00:02:46.129> of<00:02:46.280> legs<00:02:46.519> in

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
equally between the two sets of legs in

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.039 
equally between the two sets of legs in
other<00:02:46.879> words<00:02:47.090> I<00:02:47.209> didn't<00:02:47.480> suddenly<00:02:47.840> have<00:02:47.959> the

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:48.049 
other words I didn't suddenly have the

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:50.140 
other words I didn't suddenly have the
front<00:02:48.290> legs<00:02:48.470> going<00:02:49.129> straight<00:02:49.519> out<00:02:49.549> the<00:02:49.939> way<00:02:50.000> we

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
front legs going straight out the way we

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.240 
front legs going straight out the way we

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
see these horses doing you know the hind

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.309 
see these horses doing you know the hind
leg<00:02:52.459> must<00:02:52.700> always<00:02:52.939> swing<00:02:53.599> through<00:02:54.019> to<00:02:54.200> the

leg must always swing through to the

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:56.470 
leg must always swing through to the
same<00:02:54.620> degree<00:02:55.099> as<00:02:55.220> the<00:02:55.250> front<00:02:55.609> leg<00:02:55.790> or<00:02:56.000> you<00:02:56.269> will

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
same degree as the front leg or you will

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.119 
same degree as the front leg or you will
blow<00:02:56.689> out<00:02:56.870> the<00:02:57.019> horse's<00:02:57.349> legs<00:02:57.590> that's<00:02:57.950> how

00:02:58.119 --> 00:02:58.129 
blow out the horse's legs that's how

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
sudden you can see the compression in

through<00:03:24.680> the<00:03:24.769> back<00:03:24.949> and<00:03:25.220> lifts<00:03:25.909> up<00:03:26.090> so<00:03:26.540> he

00:03:26.619 --> 00:03:26.629 
through the back and lifts up so he

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:28.330 
through the back and lifts up so he
lifts<00:03:26.930> me<00:03:26.989> up<00:03:27.109> which<00:03:27.379> feels<00:03:27.590> like<00:03:27.709> a<00:03:27.829> big<00:03:28.069> wave

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
lifts me up which feels like a big wave

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.159 
lifts me up which feels like a big wave
lifting<00:03:28.879> you<00:03:28.970> up<00:03:29.000> and<00:03:29.269> carrying<00:03:29.720> you<00:03:29.810> towards

the shore two versed on a boogie board
it's<00:03:32.269> that<00:03:32.449> same<00:03:32.750> feeling<00:03:36.340> and<00:03:37.340> it's<00:03:37.459> a<00:03:37.519> very

00:03:37.719 --> 00:03:37.729 
it's that same feeling and it's a very

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:43.800 
it's that same feeling and it's a very
powerful<00:03:37.970> feeling<00:03:42.099> so<00:03:43.099> once<00:03:43.310> again

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
powerful feeling so once again

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.229 
powerful feeling so once again
watch<00:03:44.130> as<00:03:45.130> I<00:03:45.190> let<00:03:45.400> him<00:03:45.520> stretch<00:03:45.790> back<00:03:46.030> out

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 
watch as I let him stretch back out

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:48.780 
watch as I let him stretch back out
again<00:03:46.680> clearly<00:03:47.680> watch<00:03:47.920> what<00:03:48.160> happens<00:03:48.520> here

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
again clearly watch what happens here

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.400 
again clearly watch what happens here
you<00:03:49.239> can<00:03:49.360> see<00:03:49.510> here<00:03:49.750> he<00:03:49.870> gets<00:03:49.989> a<00:03:50.140> little<00:03:50.290> bit

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
you can see here he gets a little bit

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.589 
you can see here he gets a little bit
fast<00:03:50.800> and<00:03:51.069> I<00:03:51.130> slowed<00:03:51.430> down<00:03:51.459> just<00:03:51.790> a<00:03:52.239> little<00:03:52.480> bit

00:03:52.589 --> 00:03:52.599 
fast and I slowed down just a little bit

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:54.120 
fast and I slowed down just a little bit
and<00:03:52.780> there<00:03:52.989> he's<00:03:53.170> balanced<00:03:53.680> right<00:03:53.830> there

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.130 
and there he's balanced right there

there's<00:03:54.340> the<00:03:54.430> optimal<00:03:55.030> working<00:03:55.510> drop<00:03:55.959> for<00:03:56.140> him

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
there's the optimal working drop for him

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.080 
there's the optimal working drop for him
and<00:03:56.500> you<00:03:56.860> can<00:03:56.980> see<00:03:57.160> how<00:03:57.310> much<00:03:57.489> flexion<00:03:57.819> there

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
and you can see how much flexion there

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.089 
and you can see how much flexion there
is<00:03:58.180> in<00:03:58.270> his<00:03:58.390> hocks<00:03:58.599> even<00:03:58.930> here<00:03:59.200> but<00:03:59.680> watch<00:03:59.830> as<00:04:00.010> I

is in his hocks even here but watch as I

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:01.740 
is in his hocks even here but watch as I
go<00:04:00.130> back<00:04:00.430> to<00:04:00.670> sit<00:04:00.970> and<00:04:01.150> watch<00:04:01.360> what<00:04:01.599> happens
