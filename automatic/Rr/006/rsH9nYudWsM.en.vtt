00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.250
 Reason the old manuscript opening game had been there 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.570
 Researchers at the University of Münster have all the manuscripts of the new 

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:10.779
 Testament temperature is found and hundreds of many 

00:00:10.779 --> 00:00:13.209
 and hundreds of many 

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:15.669
 and hundreds of many 

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:18.669
 and hundreds of many 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:23.810
 give a walking preacher 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.810
 also Jesus of Nazareth 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:32.689
 but today people begin on Good Friday to have his crucifixion around 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:35.040
 we always 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.390
 everything we say about Jesus and the board is also the close and the crowd 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.340
 plan everything 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.400
 but as a new art form 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.130
 It's made up to be over 5700 manuscripts 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:00.130
 the largest part is the Greeks city council 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.260
 but if I look at these ancient texts the original was which only a section 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.810
 the researchers from the New Testament Institute of the University of Münster go 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.410
 exactly this question 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:14.130
 they want to reconstruct the past 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.130
 and you want a bugless translation bidder 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:24.220
 in the vault store the valuable study objects like this Talents St 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.570
 a bible with multiple pages 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.220
 Since parchment used to be very expensive in the past, scribes often go away 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.200
 Texts and written the page 9 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.620
 especially these talents branches are a valuable source for the Bible Students 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.400
 this text dates from the thirteenth century 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.050
 the dashes in the background are traces of the original from the eighth 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:47.230
 century 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:50.380
 that has become evident in the course of lore percent 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.450
 so as not to do the good thing so that the crossbar 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.009
 that would be nicer and also that and offensive and offensive and 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:01.870
 offensive or and offensive so that in the course of lore in the 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:05.540
 Manuscripts created around such a large majority stacks 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.139
 because almost a manuscript finds itself but that is now 

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:13.939
 not the good old text not the good old text not the good old text not 

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:17.199
 good old Textron the game start in development 

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:20.609
 what we reconstruct is expanded from the totality of addresses 

00:02:21.139 --> 00:02:23.169
 from the whole over the front 

00:02:23.169 --> 00:02:27.149
 the point where this whole development started 

00:02:27.149 --> 00:02:29.469
 and the point, so to speak 

00:02:29.469 --> 00:02:32.429
 Wodak the first relegated statements has begun 

00:02:32.429 --> 00:02:34.689
 until today is called write off 

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:35.889
 what we are 

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:40.289
 because Katie's seizure is actually on the desk that I hope for 

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:42.579
 to press 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:46.299
 The institute owns microfilms and photos from almost all over the world 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:48.129
 accessible handwriting 

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:51.480
 they will be part of the research project Novum Testament and 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.469
 Greg digitized 

00:02:53.469 --> 00:02:56.899
 the computer searches for matches with a grid system 

00:02:56.899 --> 00:02:59.899
 deviations 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:03.209
 a mammoth project 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.409
 until the year 2030 that is 22 years to complete the evaluation 

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:12.589
 The North Rhine-Westphalian Academy of Sciences finances it with 7 

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:15.589
 Million Euros 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.709
 the first successes of the Bible researchers from Münster 

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:23.730
 they already have hundreds of lore Sri Lanka they have 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.439
 already hundreds of lore Sri Lanka they already have hundreds of 

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:30.919
 Tradition Sri Lanka discovered 

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:33.199
 For the most part, these are only small deviations 

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:36.199
 but sometimes with big consequences 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:40.379
 Olmert called 16 postpone 

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:43.319
 the researchers find a misappropriated apostrophe 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:46.819
 So far, this name has been translated to June branch still third-party manufacturer 

00:03:47.649 --> 00:03:49.099
 do we have 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:50.229
 July year 

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:52.340
 a Bavarian Forsythe 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.359
 Seminar measures 4 46 

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:57.009
 handwritten interviews 

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:58.889
 come to 209 

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:01.509
 Here you can clearly see the paper 

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:04.289
 a female form was meant 

00:04:04.289 --> 00:04:07.569
 Hundreds of thousands of selected passages facilitate the work 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:10.569
 they prove fast train the versions originated 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:14.539
 This grid system has been laid out by the Bible scholar Kurt Aland 

00:04:15.749 --> 00:04:19.340
 of one-tenth of the New Testament, the original text was already able to do so 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:24.390
 reconstructed each has proven itself 2 and also Dr 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:25.629
 the canon 

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:30.409
 Our New Testament is not one that is in the old church of 

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:33.589
 a central instance has been established already that was one 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.860
 discreet historical development 

00:04:41.069 --> 00:04:44.490
 The Bible is translated into more than 2,400 languages 

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:49.139
 all Protestant Catholic and to the Carnic versions 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:52.139
 today would have relied on those of the Munsterians 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.129
 as a standard work 

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:58.150
 and occupied scientifically 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:59.990
 when thousands of writers 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:02.030
 have held the message of Christ
