00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:15.910
 so good day to all 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:18.119
 Today we have a review of rubber bridgestone 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:28.960
 blizzak vrx 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:32.079
 so here it looks like I want to say 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:34.390
 that it is winter tires but it does not 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:39.250
 peculiar to our consumer 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:45.100
 why because it is sticky and our 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:48.010
 consumer got used to spiked velcro 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:52.020
 pretty let's say not sonorous 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:55.500
 product for the Russian market company 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.310
 empty declare that the wheel is about 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.810
 Exactly this rubber bridgestone 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:04.680
 blizzak vrx will turn it up 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:08.259
 Russian car market is the wheel 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:12.400
 It was created specifically for Russia for 

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:16.560
 harsh operating conditions let's 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:28.499
 let's look at the protector what is not about shit 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:28.499
 we can see the tread portion 1 is such 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.350
 arrow guns 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:49.020
 snow deep snow that is this one 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.020
 tread 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:21.340
 this part 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:27.850
 active fighting for the nose 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:32.260
 on snowy red well then there is water and there 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:38.380
 different reagents seams on snow porridge not 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:52.570
 so effective Velcro 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:56.140
 let's say so much does not respect out losing 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:03:10.680
 to produce this rubber here it is ten 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:10.680
 percent is stronger than many spikes soon 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:17.799
 this rubber is revealed on the ice 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:20.220
 after the top layer is erased all 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:23.220
 these minutes hairs 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.220
 will increase 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:29.940
 that's how the hairs will be erased 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:33.640
 a rough surface is formed 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:38.940
 it comes about 500 kilometers and 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:48.519
 tires very effectively begin to 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:04:11.620
 fight the icy road 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:04:16.959
 rubber end though I will persuade you 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:21.340
 everyone decides what to ride but i 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:24.600
 I will say so pleased with what is 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:29.770
 some more technological developments 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:35.310
 which is possible for less because 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:39.190
 technology steps certainly do not destroy 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:47.410
 asphalt and other pavement 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:54.720
 but velcro do not do this 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:59.729
 such is very very interesting tires 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:04.620
 to pluses and velcro also I refer that 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:07.930
 Velcro does not make noise like thorns 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:11.470
 she remains always soft now on 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:18.450
 street somewhere minus 15 degrees but she 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:22.389
 straight very soft is remembered will help 

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:26.979
 swallows any bumps much better 

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:32.370
 than studded tires will that be 

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:38.490
 that there are small holes well or 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:41.050
 rail and tram crossings well 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:45.580
 you choose spikes or velcro 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:46.839
 know such a collection that I do not know 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:50.469
 will last even 

00:05:46.839 --> 00:05:55.319
 for years but now the realities of modern 

00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:59.589
 the world say that the roads are cleaned well 

00:05:55.319 --> 00:06:02.680
 little snow well i think 

00:05:59.589 --> 00:06:10.379
 spikes slowly but surely in cities exactly 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:15.339
 Yeisk I will still be a 

00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:17.729
 the amount of time for this is all 

00:06:15.339 --> 00:06:17.729
 here is an interesting 

00:06:17.819 --> 00:06:31.330
 tires read our auto blog and read 

00:06:26.339 --> 00:06:33.839
 the article is exactly the project release on the link i
