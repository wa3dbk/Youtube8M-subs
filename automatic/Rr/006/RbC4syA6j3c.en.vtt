00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:07.530
 but 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:14.660
 nice guys at that time of that 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:16.250
 found here on my channel with a 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.930
 new video we are here with this new one 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.520
 lay commentaries for the first time on 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:20.900
 that more than ghost this will be a video 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.360
 quite fast as it will be 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.010
 recorded on frenzy or crash of 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.800
 famous modalities introduced in this cod 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.539
 constant campers practically the boys 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.850
 I said he had uploaded a first 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:32.930
 video on this video game for now i have to 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:34.670
 see in the second I will succeed in 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.620
 charge it tonight because tonight 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.480
 because we say that I had some 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.860
 just mess up because the other video is 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.110
 I had started to load it had done 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.720
 everything but then what did youtube is 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.670
 It was 40 minutes to get light put us 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.979
 40 minutes to get out in the pitts though 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.049
 he did n't go out he kept not going out e 

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:52.820
 so I deleted the video now 

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:54.530
 however decided to registered in another su 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.570
 this mode because I think that 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.580
 it might be a little more fun 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:01.400
 a little more dynamic given that it is precisely 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:03.470
 the crank mode of frenzy is precisely 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.080
 obviously more hectic dollars or if 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:10.280
 don't make these shitty jokes 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:11.899
 so discounted and so I'm all here 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.899
 to register later on this mode 

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:16.759
 will last less than the game 

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:19.640
 normal this is safe is also a thing 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:22.670
 ideal enough we say so for me 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:26.409
 guys because to load this 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:29.479
 video I will have to jump through hoops and 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:31.159
 so nothing now cease to talk 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:33.229
 let's talk a little less about what 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:35.899
 say however about this August 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:38.610
 I must say that it is a strange game play 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:41.160
 different all the other cod 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.110
 very particular game a lot 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.530
 probably a game like everyone 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.150
 the others 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.130
 the only thing he will have in common with 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:50.040
 other codecs and flight were admired ceo of 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.650
 hera and I personally like it 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.110
 I don't know, though 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:57.479
 many may not even like it yet 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.300
 because it's a really different style 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.130
 simo compared to the classic call of duty 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.990
 now on this weapon as well 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:08.399
 I don't know how I want to go 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:10.020
 with specialist because I fuck I have it 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.160
 got siculo 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.590
 I don't know where I want to go with 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.650
 specialist because really at the beginning 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:20.700
 still it is really difficult to succeed in 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:23.280
 combine something this does not die 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.959
 you've seen how many iodate hits 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.730
 here's something that turns me around 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:29.220
 boxes just the fact that they do 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.739
 kill with two shots still features 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.140
 are to be reviewed of her while you 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:37.500
 shooters look worse and they don't go 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.570
 down and obviously then other things that i 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.390
 Dedicated servers are a bit of a grip for 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:45.420
 ass because they practically work 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.850
 because it has only over 500 of ping e 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.550
 that now without detracting from those 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.600
 which were really there though 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.580
 let's say it's a pretty thing 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:59.520
 useless because it is not that everyone in Italy 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:03:03.210
 500 year of ping this from where on a 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:05.010
 dancing kart is okay okay okay goes 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:05.850
 well it's not true a fucking good is not 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.160
 sucking 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.720
 more than anything else guys aim here 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.340
 this to this and pure connection 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.340
 this and pure connection he is 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:17.970
 unlocked and was already smashing me to 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:22.290
 spoon made with the ass however is one thing 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:23.130
 of the genre not even in mv 3 even black 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:30.030
 ops tour 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:32.250
 or maybe yes and who knows and therefore not 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.490
 tell me what you think of this 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.490
 cod 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.820
 if you're enjoying it if it's disappointing 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.440
 your expectations that's why not 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:44.570
 I could understand since the same e 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.570
 firing christ 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:53.540
 then a little that of learned how 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:53.540
 there is no one here 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:02.900
 he died, hell, I don't know, tell me you 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:04.730
 as seen looking if I'm enjoying it 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.890
 if it 's charging you because it's clear 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:09.380
 that a very different game all 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:13.160
 others give the impression that it is also 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:15.730
 as an even more difficult ally here 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.540
 so let me know your opinion 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.940
 opinion 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:24.380
 I know it's not so wide here 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:27.380
 see here well was a few seconds 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:29.570
 he thought of killing me 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:31.760
 then it is really ces too dances the weapon 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:35.510
 when that is when you are hit 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:38.419
 aiming busted mind too is one thing 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:43.720
 absurd, that is, as soon as it hits you 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:43.720
 jumps too much too much in the air and 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:55.610
 ok oh don't die audition dies 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:59.390
 ok now he's dead i'd be dead 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:01.610
 pissed off pretty well you see 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:04.850
 so this mode is very beautiful 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:07.310
 very funny from the car and in fact we are 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:09.610
 that the name very apt the name 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:13.250
 makes the idea of ​​eco mode 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:16.460
 contains the essence of the mode 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:17.810
 feel like I'm talking but I'm there 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:20.500
 losing pissed off and I'm not finding 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:20.500
 people 

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:25.490
 come here from behind weird they don't have me 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:27.470
 never killed from behind this game not 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:29.180
 I just kill you from behind you 

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:31.580
 always take from behind as if they were 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:32.930
 the maps were not memorized 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:36.140
 obviously waiting for them and so are you 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:37.700
 that the poor Italian unlucky as well as 

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:41.539
 have a crap connection and also 

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:43.310
 the usual bad luck of the beautiful Italian li 

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:45.500
 guys we won thanks to the trill 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:47.300
 nor that we do this double so well 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.569
 no fast video and I hope you can 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:50.699
 to be liked if you want 

00:05:48.569 --> 00:05:52.110
 the others of live I think the moment 

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:54.360
 for the start of the game will do 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:56.339
 mainly let me write this 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:57.809
 you what do you think left lay 

00:05:56.339 --> 00:05:59.279
 precisely who really it was on youtube 

00:05:57.809 --> 00:06:02.219
 how it had become fundamental 

00:05:59.279 --> 00:06:05.300
 join the channel and a nice boys a 

00:06:02.219 --> 00:06:05.300
