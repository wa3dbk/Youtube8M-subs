00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:14.320
 good hello everyone I bring a 

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:16.270
 application the excellent truth for 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.810
 tablets 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:24.520
 I do not have my tablet that is a 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:26.010
 application that pretty much clears the 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:29.200
 RAM 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.600
 for games 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.750
 that there are times when the hole 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:37.440
 quite 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.060
 then load enough and consume 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.079
 so much ram memory to the last 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:45.109
 getting out and it does not work 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:47.120
 then in Bogota law there is 

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:49.740
 enough applications on these but 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.070
 which it has tried many 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:55.910
 I have never been convinced 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:58.400
 they have never convinced me but this one yes 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.410
 convinced this application and convinced me 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:04.070
 and that's why I upload it because it 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:05.570
 I recommend the pretty is called super 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.420
 I do not know if more than one thing 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:11.810
 he met others do not know him a 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:14.810
 excellent application first student 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:17.060
 do the process explained up there me 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:20.920
 says that I have free memory 102 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:23.680
 megabytes which is what it does is 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.479
 what I say in the play enough 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.320
 applications very similar to this one but 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:31.659
 Yes it appeared to me as very good 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:34.390
 streamlines the total processes very much 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:36.130
 always leave very quickly after having 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:39.909
 done ram memory cleaning on 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:42.729
 with this application then well no of 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:44.520
 simple operation we press where it says 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:46.920
 the kilo side 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.479
 the chile to all the applications that in 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.159
 this moment they are working 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.140
 tablet that this what causes you to consume 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:55.350
 enough resources when we go to play 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.920
 the games or it ends up getting out or you 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.920
 they come back slowly 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.440
 ok then what you're going to get and 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.750
 we give says that 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.450
 he starts to scan and like you 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:11.500
 come 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:14.890
 before I was in 109 she freed me to 155 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:17.310
 megabytes we go where it says I press where 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:20.750
 says running servers 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:23.110
 The completion scanning process 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:28.930
 it's called chile to all the rains 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:28.930
 we have all and we give in kiel 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.860
 there are times when applications where 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.350
 says running servers was full or has 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.550
 first running where memory says 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.580
 free 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:44.230
 the weight increases by there are two mega more to 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.830
 a mega mega other depending on the use 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:51.820
 that does not have the tablet clean has 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:54.570
 worked quite then why that's why 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.570
 that does not set me free 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:01.170
 but what interests us where it says 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:01.170
 running apps 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:11.480
 she says 138 we selected all 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:14.000
 and the other is that 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:17.190
 every 151 and the fingers we see we left 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.500
 we go out back 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.390
 get scanned 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.130
 we apply in both the top part 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:25.680
 we look at the operation of the table 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:28.020
 we run for a side we stop running 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:32.150
 good for one side like that because more to 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:32.150
 often to the main menu at least start 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:39.960
 and I tell you that the idea pretty fast 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.970
 of what I tell you in wawel play there 

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:44.370
 quite some applications very similar to 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:47.040
 but the truth is that they have not 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.630
 convinced but this one convinced me 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.910
 then he convinced me why I want 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:53.430
 upload this video to show them that 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.320
 This application is is very good 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.480
 advantage is that it is free in 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:59.100
 google play that I leave the link to 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.130
 download it and try it out and 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:03.930
 tell you win your tests and tell me how 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:06.150
 it seems to them if indeed they thought 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.900
 fast yes yes it worked for them yes 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:11.709
 effectively 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.879
 served the application ok well that's 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:15.350
 all 

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:17.950
 it's called super tag heuler 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:17.950
 okay 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:25.860
 and that's it, that was all until the next and 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.860
 Show
