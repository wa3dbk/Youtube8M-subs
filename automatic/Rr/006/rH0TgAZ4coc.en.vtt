what it shows us is the fact that we in

what it shows us is the fact that we in
removed<00:04:17.769> her<00:04:18.040> entire<00:04:18.190> right<00:04:18.730> hemisphere<00:04:19.269> and

removed her entire right hemisphere and

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:22.140 
removed her entire right hemisphere and

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
can see right down the middle

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:31.200 
can see right down the middle
the<00:04:28.960> right<00:04:29.230> hemisphere<00:04:29.470> that<00:04:30.460> was<00:04:30.670> there<00:04:31.000> is

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 
the right hemisphere that was there is

the right hemisphere that was there is
now<00:04:31.480> replaced<00:04:31.930> by<00:04:32.110> fluid

now replaced by fluid

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.120 
now replaced by fluid
but<00:04:34.090> how<00:04:34.270> could<00:04:34.600> Jodie<00:04:34.960> function<00:04:35.560> normally

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.130 
but how could Jodie function normally

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:40.200 
but how could Jodie function normally
with<00:04:36.340> only<00:04:36.550> one<00:04:37.000> hemisphere<00:04:38.520> it's<00:04:39.520> because<00:04:40.000> of

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
with only one hemisphere it's because of

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.360 
with only one hemisphere it's because of
a<00:04:40.300> miraculous<00:04:40.780> ability<00:04:41.410> of<00:04:41.530> the<00:04:41.650> brain<00:04:41.770> called

plasticity our brains can actually

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.970 
plasticity our brains can actually
change<00:04:45.700> shape<00:04:46.140> creating<00:04:47.140> new<00:04:47.350> connections

immediately<00:05:00.570> this<00:05:01.570> young<00:05:01.840> lady<00:05:02.190> had<00:05:03.190> half<00:05:03.490> her

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:03.730 
immediately this young lady had half her

immediately this young lady had half her
brain<00:05:03.910> removed<00:05:04.450> went<00:05:05.200> home<00:05:05.470> I<00:05:05.830> guess<00:05:06.430> maybe

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:06.700 
brain removed went home I guess maybe

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:09.260 
brain removed went home I guess maybe
ten<00:05:07.030> days<00:05:07.060> later<00:05:07.600> and<00:05:07.870> was<00:05:08.020> already<00:05:08.350> walking

she was ambulance she was able to walk
out<00:05:13.000> of<00:05:13.060> the<00:05:13.360> hospital<00:05:13.990> and<00:05:14.490> that's<00:05:15.490> because

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:16.120 
out of the hospital and that's because

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:20.520 
out of the hospital and that's because
her<00:05:16.870> left<00:05:17.220> hemisphere<00:05:18.220> had<00:05:18.910> such<00:05:19.530> resilience

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:20.530 
her left hemisphere had such resilience

her left hemisphere had such resilience
such<00:05:20.860> plasticity<00:05:21.400> it<00:05:22.120> was<00:05:22.300> able<00:05:22.630> to<00:05:22.660> say<00:05:22.960> okay

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:23.440 
such plasticity it was able to say okay

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:26.879 
such plasticity it was able to say okay
something<00:05:24.040> needs<00:05:24.310> to<00:05:24.460> move<00:05:24.880> her<00:05:25.240> left<00:05:25.540> leg

00:05:26.879 --> 00:05:26.889 
something needs to move her left leg

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:31.920 
something needs to move her left leg
whoa<00:05:27.479> then<00:05:28.479> open<00:05:28.749> it<00:05:29.879> Jody<00:05:30.879> continues<00:05:31.509> to<00:05:31.689> work

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:31.930 
whoa then open it Jody continues to work

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:34.679 
whoa then open it Jody continues to work
on<00:05:32.199> training<00:05:32.710> her<00:05:33.039> brain<00:05:33.340> to<00:05:33.849> overcome<00:05:34.449> the

00:05:34.679 --> 00:05:34.689 
on training her brain to overcome the

00:05:38.249 --> 00:05:38.259 
slight paralysis in her left side but

00:05:38.259 --> 00:05:40.769 
slight paralysis in her left side but
enough<00:05:38.590> now<00:05:38.949> that's<00:05:39.249> very<00:05:39.669> good<00:05:40.060> you<00:05:40.300> need<00:05:40.569> to

00:05:40.769 --> 00:05:40.779 
enough now that's very good you need to

00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:43.379 
enough now that's very good you need to
do<00:05:40.960> that<00:05:41.199> stretching<00:05:41.830> stuff<00:05:42.189> honey<00:05:42.460> you<00:05:43.240> know

00:05:43.379 --> 00:05:43.389 
do that stretching stuff honey you know

00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:44.429 
do that stretching stuff honey you know
that<00:05:43.599> don't<00:05:43.779> you

00:05:44.429 --> 00:05:44.439 
that don't you

00:05:44.439 --> 00:05:50.770 
that don't you
right<00:05:44.830> doing<00:05:45.159> enough<00:05:45.460> of<00:05:45.639> it

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:50.780 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:54.880 

the<00:05:51.770> human<00:05:52.160> brain<00:05:52.340> is<00:05:52.930> just<00:05:53.930> an<00:05:54.140> awesome<00:05:54.410> thing
