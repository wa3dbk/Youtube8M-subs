00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.420 
are integrating with dingos and making
them<00:04:27.780> less<00:04:27.870> pure<00:04:28.169> and<00:04:28.440> we<00:04:28.860> don't<00:04:29.010> want<00:04:29.160> wild

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
them less pure and we don't want wild

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:30.800 
them less pure and we don't want wild
dogs<00:04:29.640> running<00:04:29.880> around<00:04:30.000> the<00:04:30.210> Australian<00:04:30.660> bush

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
dogs running around the Australian bush

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.050 
dogs running around the Australian bush
because<00:04:31.110> wild<00:04:31.770> dogs<00:04:31.950> have<00:04:32.220> to<00:04:32.520> bigger<00:04:32.700> impact

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
because wild dogs have to bigger impact

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.090 
because wild dogs have to bigger impact
than<00:04:33.120> those<00:04:33.330> natural<00:04:33.690> environment<00:04:34.169> a<00:04:34.290> cattle

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.100 
than those natural environment a cattle

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.400 
than those natural environment a cattle
sheep<00:04:35.610> cause<00:04:36.360> problems<00:04:36.750> for<00:04:36.780> the<00:04:36.870> dingo<00:04:37.200> where

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.410 
sheep cause problems for the dingo where

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.320 
sheep cause problems for the dingo where
the<00:04:37.500> dingo<00:04:37.770> is<00:04:37.800> usually<00:04:38.220> solitary<00:04:38.580> it's<00:04:39.120> not<00:04:39.300> a

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
the dingo is usually solitary it's not a

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:40.130 
the dingo is usually solitary it's not a
pack<00:04:39.600> animal

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:40.140 
pack animal

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:41.990 
pack animal
then<00:04:40.350> it's<00:04:40.500> smaller<00:04:40.890> prey<00:04:41.220> of<00:04:41.280> smaller<00:04:41.729> game

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
then it's smaller prey of smaller game

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.690 
then it's smaller prey of smaller game
so<00:04:42.479> these<00:04:43.110> animals<00:04:43.320> are<00:04:43.680> this<00:04:44.040> immune<00:04:44.400> dated

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:44.700 
so these animals are this immune dated

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.360 
so these animals are this immune dated
species<00:04:45.090> list<00:04:45.270> worldwide<00:04:45.720> and<00:04:46.350> I<00:04:46.950> think<00:04:47.250> it'll

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
species list worldwide and I think it'll

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.070 
species list worldwide and I think it'll
be<00:04:47.490> our<00:04:47.610> link<00:04:48.000> shown<00:04:48.240> and<00:04:48.419> we<00:04:48.510> don't<00:04:48.660> save<00:04:48.930> them

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
be our link shown and we don't save them

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:53.320 
be our link shown and we don't save them
from<00:04:49.169> extinction<00:04:49.590> if<00:04:50.040> then<00:04:50.870> can<00:04:51.870> we<00:04:51.960> come<00:04:52.169> on

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.330 
from extinction if then can we come on

00:04:53.330 --> 00:05:04.940 
from extinction if then can we come on
they<00:04:54.330> are<00:04:54.479> cute<00:04:54.750> -<00:04:54.990> I
