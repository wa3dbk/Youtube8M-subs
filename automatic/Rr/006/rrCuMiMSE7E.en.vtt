00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:11.240
 this is an option of the fed budget rather shy cricket augros coke and 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.090
 gideon all these well-known characters will keep his children in suspense 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:18.090
 kindergarten for 55 minutes 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.269
 so it works 

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:25.519
 four of the seven representations the goal is to educate those who 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:26.760
 love classical music 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.039
 but also teach them how to listen 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.560
 and 200 years after puppets the puppets apparently it works 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:33.540
 always denied 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:34.620
 On call 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.360
 before 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.850
 the couple is a little bit 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.940
 past the traditional puppet 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.500
 I think when I think that the navy was always adapted to the 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.260
 eras the frame of the cup 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.830
 this castle is actually a salaried apparatus the management that has nothing to 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.960
 expect this portfolio is doing well it has diversified with the 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.730
 years 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.730
 takeshi first rank 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.840
 so that's when 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.560
 the production of the company mariska been surprised if a successful performance 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.990
 even adults can not help smiling and on the faces of children 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.680
 we see a certain satisfaction or even amazement they were not 

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:17.270
 like on digital TV 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.620
 jean-françois dauré and french 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.380
 charest and m 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.370
 we have no power 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:25.890
 he struggled at the key points 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.690
 to understand it is behind the curtain that the powers must be 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:30.760
 philippe is alone in command 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.220
 it is he who manages the puppet the decor and texts would have between 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.590
 multiple techniques that this 8h art offers to the film system of expression and 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.450
 marinette complete at the level of the corsair that we can really do them 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.890
 to walk run to move his head 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.290
 so to say but like earlier we really have his staff 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.730
 a perspective of movement and expression the puppet that is 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.730
 really complete 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.250
 the castelet of the Péraudière is the only and only outdoor theater of 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:01.359
 the central region 

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:04.229
 and if Sunday they were united the day of the puppet 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.780
 For a number of years, they have been offering programming like this one 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.560
 every wednesday sunday two days after seven years
