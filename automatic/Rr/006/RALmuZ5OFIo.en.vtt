00:00:00.929 --> 00:00:05.359
 It's not even time to change your car tires before you travel. 

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:10.230
 has two pms that can no longer be used arthur grandson and can run one more 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.130
 little then you allocate penalty for two new tires but here comes the problem 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:18.369
 Do you have a set of tires? 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:24.079
 and a set of half-life tires and now some say the best by my should 

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:26.230
 stay in the lead 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.980
 in the back today is what is in the pirelli testing ground in the interior of sÃ£o 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.980
 paulo to unveil perfect 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.970
 well then let's go on the track and try to unravel this mystery 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:49.400
 we will start the test with new tires on the rear axle and the used tires is 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:55.680
 on the front axle a lot of people claim and this is the safest setting 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:56.790
 to the car 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.790
 fourth gear 70 km per hour 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.580
 several puddles of water feel that the front began to lose grip 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:11.280
 I have this sensitivity the mini car forms the grip but note 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:15.010
 we lost the control car 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:16.470
 how to make matters worse 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.890
 I'm going to get into a tight corner and I'm going to hit the steering wheel 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.190
 and take your foot off the accelerator now 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:29.200
 nothing happened, the car kept its trajectory in a good 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.720
 so now let's reverse let's put the new tires on the front and the 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.180
 used rear tires 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.180
 a lot of people do it around and let's see what happens 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.210
 good back on track now 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.790
 to do the second test 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.420
 to where I now have in the rear the most worn tires 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.980
 and in the front the newer tires 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:00.430
 the first feeling is very good the feeling of steering wheel is what I 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.980
 I have a firmer car in my hand. 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:05.510
 even because they are new tires 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:10.200
 I entered the curve cut well the water spares the role moderator corrects 

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:12.529
 my job 

00:02:12.529 --> 00:02:15.669
 Did you see how to bring it escaped at once? 

00:02:15.669 --> 00:02:18.479
 You will not feel pleasure escaping. 

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:23.279
 what you have is the good feeling of the front but the rear stealing the 

00:02:23.279 --> 00:02:24.289
 trajectory 

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:28.579
 let's make the second corner that's going to be thicker now because I'm going 

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:31.579
 turn 

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:37.559
 thank goodness they are a testing ground if it was on a road 

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:40.559
 we would be in a street situation 

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:46.079
 so it was clear the new tires should be on the rear axle of the car and 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:48.549
 the tires used at the front 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:53.510
 and one important tip both does if your car is front wheel drive another 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:54.279
 rear action
