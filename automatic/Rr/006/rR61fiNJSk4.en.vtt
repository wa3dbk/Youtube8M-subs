00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:03.780
 so everything is today that makes 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.020
 long time I did not make a 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.610
 recipe but no masks and I was able 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.810
 test this recipe several times 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.150
 I loved it and wanted it absolutely 

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:13.920
 to share then there are some 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.240
 several variants already exist 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.490
 everything done in the trade is called 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.720
 the ix mayonnaise so if you do not 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.980
 never heard of one like her 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.989
 name indicated it is a mayonnaise 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.109
 because they are exactly the same 

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:28.019
 ingredients that in a mayonnaise be 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:29.550
 eggs and oil 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.649
 of course we make the mustard we can 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.390
 even vinegar instead but I do not 

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:35.879
 do not recommend you too much that I 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.649
 recommend you for this mask and 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:39.960
 already take a mayonnaise base you 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.699
 buy a mayonnaise really the least 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.850
 expensive possible 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:46.879
 why because there is a very weak 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:50.129
 consistency in mustard and new 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:51.839
 so there is a lot of oil and it is this 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.859
 we're looking for him for hydration it 

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:56.999
 you need from the base 

00:00:54.859 --> 00:00:59.339
 four ingredients but the day that 

00:00:56.999 --> 00:01:02.190
 three on me and I recommend you 

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:03.539
 strongly to take four so 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.020
 you first need the hand ines 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.690
 it's the most important component 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.220
 the mayonnaise 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.720
 then you need an egg or 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.420
 two everything depends on the length and the 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.210
 consistency of your hair and oil 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.700
 of olive normally it also takes 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.050
 honey to moisturize a little more 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.670
 hair is to make fleix ports 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.750
 in the hair and unfortunately I have 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.240
 good to buy new ones is not 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.730
 on me so bad we trace years and it's 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:33.900
 really a lot much better of 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:37.230
 put honey what then we start 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.190
 by first take a bowl a little bowl 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:42.200
 it's enough 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:47.630
 a tablespoon and crazy and shows 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.630
 first of all where but the discomfort 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.300
 good it's true that at the level of the smell 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.700
 it's not super nice but after so 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:56.600
 you really want nutrition to be needed 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.490
 to know how to do without 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.200
 so a dose that corresponds to two 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.680
 tablespoons about 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.750
 mayonnaise 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:08.310
 then you take your offer 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.270
 so I take only one but if 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.590
 you have long hair you can 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.510
 take two and I recommend 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.250
 to put it in full because the 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.810
 egg yolk moisturizes but leblanc 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:21.209
 protects and dress 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:26.489
 the hair so it's really better to m 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:33.940
 I'm sorry to put a whole thing 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:42.430
 here and then put 2 spoons to 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:44.019
 olive oil soup one and two so 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.060
 So that's as simple as that 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:48.040
 you see that really five minutes from 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.290
 to an end not even five minutes it 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.180
 takes five seconds of gafsa on quote 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.220
 you take your whip and you mix 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.599
 so I strongly recommend you 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.480
 meters of honey necessarily it will be 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:03:01.150
 much better but the consistency I 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.590
 recommend that you do it the day before 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:06.010
 the app why for that 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:09.250
 can a little bit what I said proud 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:11.379
 whether it's a little bit more 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.120
 long as for me now that I 

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:15.609
 do them several times I usually 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.780
 it feels a little mayonnaise not 

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:19.389
 it's not super nice to see in the 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.560
 hair but really there's no more 

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:23.459
 effective do it at home 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:27.190
 frankly it's the most effective 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:30.299
 that's fine gets well mix and 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:34.060
 then you put a little movie 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:37.959
 cellophane on and you put in 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:39.730
 fridge so excuse me anyway 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:42.160
 stolen said I recommend you to the 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:46.329
 leave everything at home so he can 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:48.489
 take well and solidify well so 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:49.049
 that's it then you apply it on 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:51.579
 your hair 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:52.840
 it must be a mask very very 

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:55.569
 very very intense in that he can 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:58.630
 to do once coupled to me two 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:04:00.880
 weeks big axes and I you 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:03.340
 recommend taking a little cap 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:05.500
 a charlotte or to put a cellophane 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.540
 around so that it does not flow everywhere 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.040
 because so much honey so that's cool 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.419
 it's not too much weapons and ana ined 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.650
 I do not think you would like to have the 

00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:14.900
 even he is everywhere so know 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:17.959
 that here is this pile which is super 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.430
 moisturizer and a hint especially especially 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:21.769
 did not have your hair in the water 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:24.139
 hot is the mask with water 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:26.030
 cold because otherwise it will cook 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:27.680
 the egg in your hair and you go 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.000
 have duff residue cooked in your 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.310
 hair what is really not top 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.250
 I experienced once and more 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:35.539
 never know that it makes me feel 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.580
 absolutely more mayenne 

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:39.500
 it's a mask to do before 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:42.800
 shampoo of course and after you take 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:44.479
 your normal shampoo and makes you a 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.310
 shampoo that's enough but it 

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:47.990
 need well to his foreheads well 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:50.210
 wet your hair well 20 c and 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:51.680
 remove all the mask without doing 200 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:53.300
 points and then you do your 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.949
 normal shampoo for throwing your hair 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.330
 and you make a mask years after the 

00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:59.030
 shampoo you will still be celebrating 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:00.050
 wanted but know that it's a 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:01.789
 match that must be left to pose 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:03.020
 at least half an hour if you 

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:05.479
 want it to be really effective 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:07.820
 the ideal is one or two hours month 

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:09.949
 often I do it 1h30 2h and it's 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:12.949
 really there that hair has so much 

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:14.509
 well absorb the mask so voila voila 

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:16.130
 I finished my mass recipe 

00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:18.139
 I hope you enjoyed it and that it 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:19.639
 you stop if you've tested it and that 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:22.810
 you have questions that are 

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:25.250
 calf maybe I say what 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:26.720
 what are the other ingredients on 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:27.650
 could add a crisis a gradient 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.210
 we could replace 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:30.620
 you can ask me questions in 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:31.250
