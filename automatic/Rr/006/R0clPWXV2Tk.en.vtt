00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:07.670
 and 

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:16.000
 or there will be in this video tutorial 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:18.820
 I will explain how to put music to it has already been 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.580
 downloaded from payment to our iphone ipad 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:23.860
 or the ipad through itunes 11 from 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:27.100
 windows 7 but here also valid 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:29.020
 for other versions of the system 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:32.320
 I will also explain how to put it 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:36.340
 video movies and step because we will do 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:38.770
 a review of what it means a little 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:42.030
 every panel on itunes 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.030
 a very general review 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.270
 we open none 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:50.140
 and we plug in our iphone 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.300
 here we see that he detected it 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.050
 if by chance your iTunes does not 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:03.809
 look like this with this bar 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.000
 lateral to the left that surely 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.940
 if you just installed it, it does not come out that way 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.460
 Well here I leave the link to a video 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.619
 what I already did where I explain how 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.600
 install and configure and ture and if not 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.430
 the annotation comes out for whatever it is then 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.380
 I also leave the link in the 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.900
 You can watch it set up the 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.290
 itunes as I have it and we continue with 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.290
 the video 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:32.010
 and its content is displayed 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.900
 once detected we click on iphone 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:36.300
 although this name will vary depending 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.840
 of the name that we have put to our 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:41.049
 device 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.939
 in the information section give the 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:44.920
 properties of our iphone as its 

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:48.280
 capacity the serial number and the 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:50.740
 years version that has 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.930
 for privacy reasons I have hidden 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.920
 my phone number and the number of 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.920
 my iphone series 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.110
 this is the copy section of 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.759
 security that we have in 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.160
 Of course, it is much more comfortable, although 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:11.190
 can be saved on the computer and when 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.960
 we go down completely we get the 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.770
 option box 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:19.540
 well we should mark the latter 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:21.670
 manage music and videos 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.560
 manually after other boxes as 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:27.240
 which we are seeing synchronize 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:30.870
 wifi songs but the most important one is 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:33.900
 I last of all I have 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.580
 I have marked this first box 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.900
 but the most important one to this one 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:41.180
 manage music and life 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.180
 manually we mark 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.510
 and now we will go to our folder 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.300
 where we have saved the music in my 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:52.200
 case this I have put a few 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.200
 test songs 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:58.140
 we open our folder and here we have 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:00.530
 the list of songs 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.680
 ok we're going to itunes 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:06.200
 here we have our folder with the 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:09.140
 songs we play in music we apply 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.240
 and we get some message we select 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:14.090
 the songs that we want to pass and the 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:16.100
 we drag to the music section in the 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.720
 pure in the u2 nest program here 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:20.690
 we see that they come out in gray that means 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.250
 that are loading there are a few circles 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.590
 to the left that are empty are 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:27.319
 It must be filling one by one until you 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:29.500
 are all loaded well we see how 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:32.060
 the first one has been loaded the second 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.910
 until they are all loaded well and 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.350
 we have loaded here 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.940
 and now I will explain for example 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:39.960
 we have here 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:42.490
 this song we click on the right button 

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:45.050
 properties we go to the tab 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:47.150
 details 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:50.510
 and here we see the properties of the 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:53.360
 song like the title album years 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:56.190
 etcetera let's add the title that 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:59.090
 is watch out for this 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.090
 we wrote it 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:10.290
 we can also fill in other fields 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:12.750
 like some year we are going to 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:17.420
 introduce the interpreter that as I do not 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:17.420
 I know, I do not know, the one with the palotes 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:29.770
 well after entering the information 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.170
 if we want to complete the complete 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:36.660
 but with the title of the song and the 

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:36.660
 interpreter is enough 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:42.410
 we apply and accept well let's 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:45.340
 grab our old song the 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:47.120
 deleted and we're going to introduce the new 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:50.080
 modified 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.080
 we drag 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:56.689
 and it's loaded now I'll explain why we've 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.969
 done this 

00:04:56.689 --> 00:05:02.119
 and now on our iphone we open 

00:04:58.969 --> 00:05:03.949
 our music app here we see how 

00:05:02.119 --> 00:05:06.649
 it was before it comes out on the ub 

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:10.330
 but in reality the letter is therefore the w 

00:05:06.649 --> 00:05:12.610
 leaves without artist leaves without author 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:15.460
 and yet now the new one that we have 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:19.090
 tucked as we see comes the real name of 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:22.000
 the song with our interpreter 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:25.840
 imaginary because I do not know which one is 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:28.390
 the time singer here we have a 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:30.850
 comparison between the two photos the 

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:32.800
 modified to the right and the one that is not 

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:34.990
 modified to the left as you see the 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:39.420
 rest of titles of the songs are 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:42.930
 well placed and included in the album 

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:45.540
 author and name of the song so we 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:47.580
 it is easier to look for it in the case of 

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:49.740
 that we have many songs this 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:51.420
 process is not mandatory but for the 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:53.249
 people that are ordered or have 

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:55.459
 a lot of music 

00:05:53.249 --> 00:05:57.899
 Well, what method is quite good 

00:05:55.459 --> 00:06:00.389
 to put the original name to their 

00:05:57.899 --> 00:06:03.469
 songs is a bit entertaining but at 

00:06:00.389 --> 00:06:03.469
 final is worth it 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:08.530
 well let's continue this song we give to 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:11.830
 property of click more details we give 

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:13.920
 as the information is correct so 

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:16.430
 that you do not have to modify it 

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:20.450
 and now I will explain 

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:22.190
 how to put movies well is done 

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:23.690
 exactly the same way we're going 

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:28.169
 to our movie file in this 

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:30.629
 this case we open and tunas 

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:33.779
 and the process identical to that of the 

00:06:30.629 --> 00:06:35.840
 music we drag our file towards 

00:06:33.779 --> 00:06:37.580
 the video section 

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:40.100
 we click on videos we see that it is 

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:43.570
 loading the procedure is exactly 

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:43.570
 the same as with the songs 

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:47.800
 it loads and we see that they are bold 

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:50.680
 this blue circle is already inserted 

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:53.259
 it means we have not seen it 

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:56.910
 and if we open our video app on 

00:06:53.259 --> 00:06:59.190
 our iphone in this case this 

00:06:56.910 --> 00:07:01.860
 as we see we will get the movie that 

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:05.139
 we just put in and if we click on 

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:07.900
 she will see herself without any problem 

00:07:05.139 --> 00:07:10.360
 and nothing up here the tutorial of how 

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:13.240
 goals in music and our movie 

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:15.729
 iphone and I have also taught how 

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:17.020
 modify the properties the titles of 

00:07:15.729 --> 00:07:19.419
 the artists so that we have a 

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:21.279
 music library so ordered with the 

00:07:19.419 --> 00:07:23.680
 real name of the songs and what if 

00:07:21.279 --> 00:07:26.949
 starts with the w, we find it in 

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:29.819
 the w not in the v as in this case good 

00:07:26.949 --> 00:07:29.819
 See you in next
