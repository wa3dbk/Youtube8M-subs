to get more like Drive you know if
you've<00:01:01.989> watched<00:01:02.350> my<00:01:02.530> other<00:01:02.670> deadlifting

you've watched my other deadlifting
videos<00:01:04.000> the<00:01:04.420> last<00:01:04.539> couple<00:01:04.839> weeks<00:01:04.869> kind<00:01:05.289> of

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.350 
videos the last couple weeks kind of

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:07.139 
videos the last couple weeks kind of
experimented<00:01:05.979> with<00:01:06.009> really<00:01:06.490> squatting<00:01:07.030> down

00:01:07.139 --> 00:01:07.149 
experimented with really squatting down

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:09.660 
experimented with really squatting down
to<00:01:07.420> the<00:01:07.509> bar<00:01:07.690> here<00:01:08.470> is<00:01:08.649> just<00:01:08.890> you<00:01:09.220> know<00:01:09.280> focus

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670 
to the bar here is just you know focus

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.940 
to the bar here is just you know focus
on<00:01:09.729> getting<00:01:09.940> the<00:01:10.149> hips<00:01:10.360> lower<00:01:10.680> which<00:01:11.680> I<00:01:11.770> think

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
on getting the hips lower which I think

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:13.530 
on getting the hips lower which I think
ended<00:01:12.159> up<00:01:12.310> being<00:01:12.490> a<00:01:12.580> better<00:01:12.760> deal<00:01:13.060> for<00:01:13.360> me

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:13.540 
ended up being a better deal for me

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.560 
ended up being a better deal for me
because<00:01:14.080> it<00:01:14.320> didn't<00:01:14.560> allow<00:01:15.310> my<00:01:15.520> hips<00:01:15.760> to<00:01:16.060> rise

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:16.570 
because it didn't allow my hips to rise

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.380 
because it didn't allow my hips to rise
and<00:01:17.260> then<00:01:17.530> you<00:01:18.460> know<00:01:18.549> then<00:01:18.850> engage<00:01:19.150> with<00:01:19.330> the

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
and then you know then engage with the

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.600 
and then you know then engage with the
bar<00:01:19.570> but<00:01:19.689> everything<00:01:20.130> moved<00:01:21.130> much<00:01:21.280> more<00:01:21.520> in

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:21.610

above<00:02:03.850> the<00:02:04.030> knee<00:02:04.409> so<00:02:05.409> this<00:02:05.649> is<00:02:05.710> about<00:02:05.829> 650

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:06.759 
above the knee so this is about 650

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:12.569 
above the knee so this is about 650
pounds<00:02:07.390> 295<00:02:08.140> kilos<00:02:11.040> was<00:02:12.040> originally<00:02:12.459> supposed

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:12.579 
pounds 295 kilos was originally supposed

00:02:12.579 --> 00:02:16.260 
pounds 295 kilos was originally supposed
to<00:02:12.760> do<00:02:12.820> four<00:02:13.150> sets<00:02:13.180> of<00:02:13.630> two<00:02:13.959> I<00:02:15.060> didn't<00:02:16.060> notice

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
to do four sets of two I didn't notice

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.119 
to do four sets of two I didn't notice
that<00:02:16.300> until<00:02:16.480> then<00:02:17.349> remember<00:02:17.500> that<00:02:17.770> until<00:02:17.920> like

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:18.129 
that until then remember that until like

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:20.220 
that until then remember that until like
halfway<00:02:18.190> through<00:02:18.569> doing<00:02:19.569> them<00:02:19.690> so<00:02:19.900> I<00:02:19.930> ended<00:02:20.170> up

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
halfway through doing them so I ended up

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.650 
halfway through doing them so I ended up
did

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
did

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.690 
did
that's<00:02:20.900> a<00:02:20.990> three<00:02:21.260> and<00:02:21.620> one<00:02:22.040> set<00:02:22.220> of<00:02:22.310> two<00:02:22.460> so

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
that's a three and one set of two so

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.890 
that's a three and one set of two so
same<00:02:22.910> total<00:02:23.150> volume<00:02:24.220> but<00:02:25.220> yeah<00:02:25.400> I<00:02:25.430> just

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
same total volume but yeah I just

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.960 
same total volume but yeah I just
struggle<00:02:26.900> with<00:02:27.020> these<00:02:27.170> with<00:02:27.500> the<00:02:27.880> you<00:02:28.880> know

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
struggle with these with the you know

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.000 
struggle with these with the you know
creating<00:02:29.450> tension<00:02:29.930> at<00:02:30.200> this<00:02:30.320> point<00:02:30.620> and

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
creating tension at this point and

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.700 
creating tension at this point and
getting<00:02:31.220> like<00:02:31.430> drive<00:02:31.780> with<00:02:32.780> the<00:02:32.930> bar<00:02:33.110> elevated

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:33.710 
getting like drive with the bar elevated

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:35.860 
getting like drive with the bar elevated
so<00:02:34.280> ends<00:02:34.520> up<00:02:34.610> being<00:02:34.760> a<00:02:34.880> much<00:02:35.030> more<00:02:35.360> back

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
so ends up being a much more back

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.330 
so ends up being a much more back
dominant<00:02:36.830> movement<00:02:38.620> but<00:02:39.620> you<00:02:39.860> know<00:02:40.010> something

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
dominant movement but you know something

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:41.560 
dominant movement but you know something
I've<00:02:40.430> been<00:02:40.490> working<00:02:40.670> on<00:02:40.880> every<00:02:41.150> week<00:02:41.330> and

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570 
I've been working on every week and

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:43.690 
I've been working on every week and
Brandon's<00:02:41.840> would<00:02:41.960> have<00:02:42.110> me<00:02:42.350> do<00:02:42.860> them<00:02:43.010> and<00:02:43.250> if

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
Brandon's would have me do them and if

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.100 
Brandon's would have me do them and if
there's<00:02:44.030> something<00:02:44.330> out<00:02:44.450> there<00:02:44.480> an<00:02:44.750> exercise

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
there's something out there an exercise

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:46.720 
there's something out there an exercise
like<00:02:45.320> this<00:02:45.350> that<00:02:45.680> you<00:02:45.770> struggle<00:02:46.130> with<00:02:46.280> like<00:02:46.490> I

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
like this that you struggle with like I

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.970 
like this that you struggle with like I
struggle<00:02:47.180> with<00:02:47.210> block<00:02:47.510> pulls<00:02:47.800> probably<00:02:48.800> means

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
struggle with block pulls probably means

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.860 
struggle with block pulls probably means
that<00:02:49.160> you<00:02:49.250> need<00:02:49.340> to<00:02:49.430> be<00:02:49.550> spending<00:02:49.790> more<00:02:50.030> more

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
that you need to be spending more more

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.350 
that you need to be spending more more
energy<00:02:51.260> and<00:02:51.590> more<00:02:51.770> time<00:02:52.070> doing<00:02:52.370> them<00:02:52.610> so<00:02:53.240> this

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
energy and more time doing them so this

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.520 
energy and more time doing them so this
is<00:02:53.420> the<00:02:53.510> first<00:02:53.660> time<00:02:53.840> I<00:02:53.870> really<00:02:54.200> had<00:02:54.230> an

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
is the first time I really had an

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.170 
is the first time I really had an
extended<00:02:54.920> period<00:02:55.610> of<00:02:55.640> time<00:02:55.700> where<00:02:56.030> I've<00:02:56.090> been

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
extended period of time where I've been

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.030 
extended period of time where I've been
training<00:02:56.480> them<00:02:56.570> hard<00:02:56.810> and<00:02:57.080> I<00:02:57.110> know<00:02:57.170> come

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
training them hard and I know come

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.800 
training them hard and I know come
November<00:02:58.490> at<00:02:58.580> my<00:02:58.700> next<00:02:58.910> meet<00:02:59.120> I'm<00:02:59.510> going<00:02:59.720> to

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
November at my next meet I'm going to

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.830 
November at my next meet I'm going to
reap<00:03:00.260> the<00:03:00.410> benefits<00:03:00.800> of<00:03:00.890> that<00:03:00.950> work<00:03:01.750> and<00:03:02.750> we're

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
reap the benefits of that work and we're

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.420 
reap the benefits of that work and we're
moving<00:03:03.050> at<00:03:03.170> some<00:03:03.320> deficit<00:03:03.680> poles<00:03:03.920> you<00:03:04.190> can<00:03:04.250> see

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
moving at some deficit poles you can see

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:05.860 
moving at some deficit poles you can see
it's<00:03:04.550> a<00:03:04.610> pretty<00:03:04.730> small<00:03:04.880> deficit<00:03:05.480> maybe<00:03:05.690> like

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
it's a pretty small deficit maybe like

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.010 
it's a pretty small deficit maybe like
an<00:03:05.990> inch<00:03:06.170> and<00:03:06.290> a<00:03:06.380> half<00:03:07.600> inch<00:03:08.600> and<00:03:08.750> a<00:03:08.840> quarter

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:09.020 
an inch and a half inch and a quarter

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:10.990 
an inch and a half inch and a quarter
even<00:03:09.410> I<00:03:09.560> don't<00:03:10.220> think<00:03:10.370> you<00:03:10.460> really<00:03:10.670> need<00:03:10.790> to<00:03:10.880> be

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
even I don't think you really need to be

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.580 
even I don't think you really need to be
overly<00:03:11.240> concerned<00:03:11.690> about<00:03:11.840> using<00:03:12.230> a<00:03:12.320> huge

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
overly concerned about using a huge

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.340 
overly concerned about using a huge
deficit<00:03:13.070> just<00:03:13.130> a<00:03:14.000> small<00:03:14.780> one<00:03:14.930> so<00:03:14.960> it<00:03:15.110> doesn't

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
deficit just a small one so it doesn't

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.470 
deficit just a small one so it doesn't
alter<00:03:15.470> your<00:03:15.680> technique<00:03:16.070> too<00:03:16.250> much<00:03:16.430> so<00:03:17.240> this<00:03:17.330> is

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
alter your technique too much so this is

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.050 
alter your technique too much so this is
280<00:03:17.930> kilos<00:03:18.290> about<00:03:18.500> 615<00:03:19.280> pounds<00:03:19.700> just<00:03:19.820> did<00:03:19.970> it
