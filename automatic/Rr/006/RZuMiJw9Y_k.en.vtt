going to be supported the shapes are

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.730 
going to be supported the shapes are
important<00:00:32.220> we<00:00:32.970> use<00:00:33.180> shapes<00:00:33.600> in<00:00:34.350> order<00:00:34.620> to

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:34.740 
important we use shapes in order to

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:38.560 
important we use shapes in order to
create<00:00:35.010> strength<00:00:36.350> for<00:00:37.350> instance<00:00:37.680> this<00:00:37.890> has<00:00:38.130> no

create strength for instance this has no
no<00:00:39.570> resistance<00:00:40.290> no<00:00:40.620> I<00:00:40.650> try<00:00:41.430> to<00:00:41.490> put<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:42.750> weight

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:42.990 
no resistance no I try to put the weight

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:44.840 
no resistance no I try to put the weight
of<00:00:43.020> my<00:00:43.350> hand<00:00:43.620> over<00:00:43.890> here<00:00:44.130> and<00:00:44.370> you<00:00:44.610> see<00:00:44.790> it

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
of my hand over here and you see it

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.930 
of my hand over here and you see it
collapsing<00:00:45.390> and<00:00:45.540> lower<00:00:46.050> I<00:00:46.200> do<00:00:46.290> now<00:00:46.590> I<00:00:46.940> make

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
collapsing and lower I do now I make

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.520 
collapsing and lower I do now I make
like<00:00:48.120> a<00:00:48.150> little<00:00:48.270> cigar<00:00:48.810> over<00:00:48.990> here<00:00:49.200> which<00:00:49.380> is

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
like a little cigar over here which is

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.460 
like a little cigar over here which is
nothing<00:00:49.980> else<00:00:50.160> that<00:00:50.280> making<00:00:50.820> a<00:00:50.880> shape<00:00:51.180> I<00:00:51.480> just

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:52.470 
nothing else that making a shape I just

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.370 
nothing else that making a shape I just
did<00:00:52.650> this<00:00:52.830> shape<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:53.430> now<00:00:54.420> I<00:00:54.750> can<00:00:55.080> rest<00:00:55.230> my

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:55.380 
did this shape and now I can rest my

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:56.840 
did this shape and now I can rest my
hand<00:00:55.650> over<00:00:55.920> here<00:00:56.130> and<00:00:56.280> these<00:00:56.400> things<00:00:56.580> are

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
hand over here and these things are

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.520 
hand over here and these things are
going<00:00:57.060> to<00:00:57.180> collapse<00:00:57.480> oh<00:00:57.660> just<00:00:57.870> by<00:00:58.020> making<00:00:58.260> a

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
going to collapse oh just by making a

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.400 
going to collapse oh just by making a
shape<00:00:58.830> i<00:00:59.160> gave<00:00:59.970> the<00:01:00.150> material<00:01:00.660> strength<00:01:01.080> to

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
shape i gave the material strength to

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.999 
shape i gave the material strength to
hold<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.800> weight<00:01:01.980> of<00:01:02.160> my<00:01:02.190> hand<00:01:02.580> now<00:01:03.330> again

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:04.009 
hold the weight of my hand now again

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:07.490 
hold the weight of my hand now again
it's<00:01:05.009> it's<00:01:05.489> it<00:01:05.909> has<00:01:06.180> no<00:01:06.450> shape<00:01:06.750> but<00:01:06.960> if<00:01:07.110> I<00:01:07.229> just

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
it's it's it has no shape but if I just

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.270 
it's it's it has no shape but if I just
bend<00:01:07.830> it<00:01:08.009> even<00:01:08.880> once<00:01:09.210> and<00:01:09.860> I<00:01:10.860> make<00:01:11.100> a

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
bend it even once and I make a

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.620 
bend it even once and I make a
triangular<00:01:12.119> shape<00:01:13.340> see<00:01:14.340> now<00:01:14.820> it<00:01:15.090> doesn't<00:01:15.450> fall

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
triangular shape see now it doesn't fall

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:22.270 
triangular shape see now it doesn't fall
anymore

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.500 

this<00:01:23.280> is<00:01:23.400> why<00:01:23.550> it's<00:01:23.610> so<00:01:23.850> important<00:01:24.420> to

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:24.510 
this is why it's so important to

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:35.120 
this is why it's so important to
understand<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:26.000> shape<00:01:27.000> of<00:01:27.240> a<00:01:27.360> building

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.789 

from<00:01:35.850> tower<00:01:36.090> is<00:01:36.479> one<00:01:37.469> of<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.680> most

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
from tower is one of the most

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.010 
from tower is one of the most
challenging<00:01:38.189> and<00:01:39.030> difficult<00:01:39.210> job<00:01:39.689> that<00:01:39.869> we

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
challenging and difficult job that we

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:55.950 
challenging and difficult job that we
have<00:01:40.140> me

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.200 

but<00:01:56.960> there<00:01:57.140> are<00:01:57.200> many<00:01:57.260> shapes<00:01:57.680> that<00:01:58.070> form<00:01:58.880> this

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
but there are many shapes that form this

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.380 
but there are many shapes that form this
room<00:01:59.540> if<00:02:00.170> we<00:02:00.440> look<00:02:00.710> up<00:02:00.980> a<00:02:01.010> little<00:02:01.160> bit<00:02:01.520> you<00:02:02.210> will

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
room if we look up a little bit you will

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.110 
room if we look up a little bit you will
see<00:02:02.600> that<00:02:02.750> space<00:02:03.110> frame<00:02:03.530> which<00:02:04.130> is<00:02:04.310> all<00:02:04.640> made

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:05.120 
see that space frame which is all made

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.830 
see that space frame which is all made
out<00:02:05.420> of<00:02:05.470> triangles<00:02:06.470> and<00:02:07.119> these<00:02:08.119> triangles

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
out of triangles and these triangles

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.750 
out of triangles and these triangles
helps<00:02:09.500> make<00:02:09.980> that<00:02:10.220> frame<00:02:10.550> very<00:02:10.850> rigid<00:02:12.760> there

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
helps make that frame very rigid there

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.960 
helps make that frame very rigid there
are<00:02:13.850> also<00:02:14.000> squares<00:02:14.720> rectangles<00:02:15.590> that<00:02:16.490> are

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
are also squares rectangles that are

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.030 
are also squares rectangles that are
coming<00:02:17.540> in<00:02:17.690> and<00:02:17.900> out<00:02:17.990> of<00:02:18.050> the<00:02:18.290> wall<00:02:18.530> that<00:02:18.560> help

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
coming in and out of the wall that help

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.400 
coming in and out of the wall that help
to<00:02:19.670> slow<00:02:19.880> down<00:02:20.150> the<00:02:20.390> war<00:02:20.570> that<00:02:20.780> goes<00:02:21.050> all<00:02:21.350> the

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
to slow down the war that goes all the

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:30.790 
to slow down the war that goes all the
way<00:02:21.950> down<00:02:27.640> these<00:02:28.640> are<00:02:28.910> really<00:02:29.380> very<00:02:30.380> simple

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
way down these are really very simple

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.240 
way down these are really very simple
concept<00:02:31.240> to<00:02:32.240> everything<00:02:33.110> that<00:02:33.350> you<00:02:33.830> have<00:02:34.040> to

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:38.240 
be a mathematical genius you are so

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.210 
be a mathematical genius you are so
wrong<00:02:38.510> there<00:02:38.780> is<00:02:38.870> not<00:02:39.050> even<00:02:39.080> funny

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.720 

I<00:02:42.390> like<00:02:43.390> math<00:02:43.810> I<00:02:44.140> like<00:02:44.380> building<00:02:45.160> things<00:02:45.190> and

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
I like math I like building things and

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:54.590 
I like math I like building things and
you<00:02:46.390> got<00:02:46.570> this<00:02:46.720> high<00:02:46.990> and<00:02:47.320> it's<00:02:47.440> fantastic
