00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 the important thing in the end in a drone is 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.759
 know how it flies so see you here 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.750
 displaced to the middle of nowhere a little 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:11.490
 to be able to fly this jjgr ch 8c by 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.190
 true my name is rafael cruz welcome 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.020
 to the drone world good today is going to be something 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.760
 rather easy is not something that always 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.080
 you are asking us how to fly rafa 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.640
 is always generalizing doing the 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.010
 video test so today what we are going to 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.600
 to do is to fly this beast, it is worth 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.150
 true that we liked it a lot 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.740
 quite liking and we can not say 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.140
 that is an achilles achilles not as always 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.520
 is saying with the chasm x 5 c but what 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.930
 that it is true is that for the already 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.430
 initiated can be a very drone 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.500
 interesting but good come rafa no te 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.149
 do not roll up and let's fly and this 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.290
 drone so we're not going to turn it on 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.750
 we have already put the battery and the 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:46.110
 we have connected ok we give the button 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:49.670
 of on-off we put it here we light 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.670
 this we synchronize 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.550
 we're going to launch it because I'm seeing that 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.840
 here too much yesterday 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:59.510
 here we have here a small mound 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:02.059
 that will serve us and that today of vélez or 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.620
 port so nothing will fly us 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:05.150
 let's fly it in tranquil ways 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:09.070
 It's worth it so that the camera can capture the 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.070
 flight so we give it up 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:18.430
 how are you watching the drone we're going 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.290
 it also sounds a lot 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.880
 incredible the truth but they are usually 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.920
 it's more like flies or something we're going to 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.350
 zoom in a bit so you see it like that 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.659
 like an extreme bowl but not you 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.560
 Do not worry, we're going to go there 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:32.560
 go a little bit up 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:38.940
 It is a beautiful flight that also gives a 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:41.659
 very stable flight an incredible flight 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:44.810
 and how are you seeing this beautiful 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:47.240
 this is slow mode or is quite 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.159
 fast at the moment we're going to go a tad 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.929
 faster though it's not going to be this either 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:53.569
 it would be like the fastest way to the mx-5 

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:55.940
 cesc but this is not the fastest way 

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:57.860
 from the estuary 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.850
 it's just a pretty fast way 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.850
 very interesting 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.370
 but it is not the quickest way or coña 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.400
 we go 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:10.260
 we're going to go let's come, because not because 

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.520
 well let's do some pirouettes like this 

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:14.370
 that we're going to try to capture the with the 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.930
 camera let's see pirouette a backflip 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:20.079
 a dose 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.879
 there you take it in cattle for you 

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:24.219
 do not come this way from the truth that is 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:26.379
 quite cool very interesting very 

00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:28.569
 interesting let's see it how it flies like this 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:30.640
 very fast, well, I'm seeing this 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:32.969
 it's a wonder it 's a wonder 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.969
 true 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.880
 sincerely to this day has 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.400
 become my big favorite but not 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.620
 for initiates the truth has already certain 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.190
 or some certain complication we are going to 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:47.040
 put it a little faster 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:49.370
 this is already once we go as you are 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.370
 seeing already 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:03:01.970
 this is already to fly with a reaction 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.970
 of incredible flight time masters 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.470
 and that we are now in the same way 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:09.630
 ultra fast or I'm at 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.400
 inclination is amazing very beast 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.590
 it practically gets 50 percent 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.260
 of incline as you are seeing this 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.790
 it's not to fly it very low but good 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:20.730
 is seeing that almost almost the drone is 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:23.150
 puts in perfect is crazy this is 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.380
 crazy flight and this is already 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:28.140
 too much left over let's put it on 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:30.510
 new in slow mode and now we have a 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.630
 more stable way a way we will 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:35.150
 take it high 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:38.480
 with him with the hill behind him 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.950
 It is beautiful that is beautiful 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.280
 I highly recommend flying this kind of thing 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:41.660
 good 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.640
 the drones let's see if you can not 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:46.460
 fly them in fields of good areas of 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:47.930
 club flight and such 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:49.360
 well at least they tried to go what 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.650
 far enough from the population 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:54.470
 so that it is not dangerous and so 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.760
 on top be good something nice on top 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:57.250
 fly in this type of places is 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.110
 amazing 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.490
 so nothing good we are going to bring it now 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:02.230
 because I believe that already as proof of 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:04.780
 flight is enough I think it is 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:07.780
 pretty clear let's try to put it 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:10.650
 in our little heliport we'll see you 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.650
 here mounted 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:22.280
 it has not been a pretty landing 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:25.640
 horrible since I do not expect anything 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:27.500
 liked this flight of the jj the bch 80 a 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.790
 drone that we love 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.530
 a drone that the truth is giving us 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:32.420
 a lot of interesting little things like 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:34.070
 you have seen in the analysis that 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:36.530
 has its failures as it is logical as it is 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:38.030
 normal but the important thing is that if you 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:41.060
 you are going to start I would not recommend you 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:43.250
 this drone not far away but yes yes 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:45.440
 you are already beginning with this one with this 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:48.110
 little world you have not caught a pit x 5 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:49.640
 c you have taken another similar drone 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:52.160
 I believe that this is the natural step and 

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:54.200
 logical for good to fly afterwards so 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:57.640
 that nothing we see a new video here 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.640
 in drone world chao
