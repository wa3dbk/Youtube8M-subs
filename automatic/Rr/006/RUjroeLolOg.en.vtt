00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:08.359
 well then I have here several 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.359
 circulitos 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:16.629
 that I was doing with the wadding that is 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:16.629
 is that of sisi 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:23.470
 Y 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:26.529
 since I already had a portion 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:29.470
 with my hand I'm giving equal turns 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:32.860
 forming what is a little ball and 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:34.480
 these balls are going to be some we are going to 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:38.579
 use as if they were snowflakes 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.579
 we're going to hang on the tree 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:44.480
 so flying as if they were carrying 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:47.300
 and you decide what size of the 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.070
 you put either big and little ones too 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.380
 this case to me if I liked this 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.900
 size are not all the same 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:57.470
 It has the same size 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.470
 but this one 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:04.879
 but now everything decides the size and already a 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.290
 Once we have several what we are going to 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:09.650
 to do is so that they do not sell 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:13.640
 simple our snowflakes 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:16.720
 so let's hit this glitter if 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:20.100
 it is bright in the transparent 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:22.560
 and what we are going to do 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.650
 and it's that we're going to give him a few 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.000
 touches to 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.000
 even snow candy 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.720
 so they have a little bit of shine and 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:38.490
 do not look so 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.490
 in this so simple 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.420
 this is the expand 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:00.190
 there it is here it looks a little bit and 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.290
 no longer shine and do not worry if 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.540
 it looks like this already disheveled because as 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:08.130
 the shore has stuck moment of it 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:10.270
 be this one with the same finger 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:13.390
 dividing the as the little hairs 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:16.020
 they start to lift then we go to 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.020
 let it dry 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:22.590
 and once it's dry again we're going 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.890
 to form the circle and we will return 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.340
 to 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:29.050
 to put together if you have several because 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.270
 we're going to do is we 're going to pass the 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.210
 nylon thread the transparent the same 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:38.780
 what we use for 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:38.780
 love the feathers then I already have here 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.440
 in pieces already this 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.370
 I have already inserted the needle of what I am going to 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:49.400
 do 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:52.090
 and once I secure the knot that 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:55.250
 I did to him since I am going to go putting 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:57.700
 which I make convenient, which I 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.700
 want 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.580
 Y 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.549
 and how can you see are those of 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.319
 times for example team I'm not 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:15.200
 putting no stop or anything down here 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:17.900
 to hold them and here only 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:21.140
 in the first is where I knotted 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:23.170
 to the airÃ³n thread but you're not wearing 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:26.500
 no stop 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:28.260
 and so are the thousands of your guys the side 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.250
 If I feel that it starts to 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.459
 what I can do 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:35.170
 I can put some white glue 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:38.160
 then where I want to stop by 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.160
 example in this distance 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:43.580
 and I can put myself 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.950
 a drop 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:48.850
 and glues 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:50.890
 so you do not get off 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:53.280
 but I would still have to wait for 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:53.280
 it dries 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:59.390
 Well, we're done with the flakes 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:02.569
 of snow is finished hanging and the 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:06.020
 I hung up where they had the feathers yes 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:08.810
 where there are feathers ah and I hung the copitos 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:11.599
 of snow first so that it 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:15.720
 hide a little bit with the feathers and not 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:17.880
 it will be noticed where we tie them 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:21.160
 yes but if you see what it looks like, it's something very 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:24.130
 very soft is something very delicate 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:27.340
 the effect that I wanted to give 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:29.380
 something yes soft something delicate like that 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.780
 it was snowing as if 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:34.240
 were falling the flakes of 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:36.660
 snow and I think if we do not do that 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.660
 effect 

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:42.129
 and the little glitter that we put on 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:46.779
 then there you will see a little touch of 

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:49.029
 brightness this one does not notice much either 

00:04:46.779 --> 00:04:51.480
 it shows very very little in the camera 

00:04:49.029 --> 00:04:53.520
 I really do not know if you noticed 

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:56.610
 Well then right now it's already 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:59.940
 first this motif that we put him 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:03.000
 I go to the tree as it is 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:04.800
 putting more ornaments I will go climbing 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.570
 the video of each adornment all 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.060
 we're going to make them like that 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:10.830
 with our little hands we will not buy 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:13.350
 absolutely nothing only the 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:16.290
 material and all the ornaments we are going to 

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:18.210
 make are going to be ornaments that we 

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:21.210
 we are going to design and that we are going to 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:23.100
 to our liking and in the end I will 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:26.130
 make a video already with all the trimmings 

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:28.710
 already already adorned with its lights and 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:30.980
 everything so that in the end you can see how 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:30.980
 was left
