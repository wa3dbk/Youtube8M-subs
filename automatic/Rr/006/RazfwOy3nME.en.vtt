00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
different kind of fabric the idea is

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.100

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
the shirt to the armpit to the very edge

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.630 
the shirt to the armpit to the very edge
of<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.329> sleeve<00:00:45.800> got<00:00:46.800> eight-and-a-half<00:00:47.399> on

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
here so you also want to figure out how

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.869 
here so you also want to figure out how
much<00:00:51.510> wider<00:00:51.840> you<00:00:52.110> want<00:00:52.320> it<00:00:52.520> so<00:00:53.520> we're<00:00:53.730> going<00:00:53.820> to

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
much wider you want it so we're going to

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:59.959 
much wider you want it so we're going to
add<00:00:54.120> about<00:00:55.879> three<00:00:56.879> inches<00:00:57.300> into<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.690> side<00:00:58.969> I'm

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
add about three inches into the side I'm

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.849 
add about three inches into the side I'm
actually<00:01:00.300> going<00:01:00.629> to<00:01:00.690> use<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.230> bottom<00:01:01.620> hem

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
actually going to use the bottom hem

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.439 
actually going to use the bottom hem
that<00:01:02.190> I<00:01:02.219> cut<00:01:02.460> off<00:01:02.609> of<00:01:02.640> this<00:01:02.879> shirt

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
that I cut off of this shirt

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.600 
that I cut off of this shirt
to<00:01:04.110> make<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:05.129> hem<00:01:05.339> on<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:06.180> sleeve<00:01:06.420> continue

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
to make the hem on the sleeve continue

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.230 
to make the hem on the sleeve continue
so<00:01:09.350> it's<00:01:10.350> going<00:01:10.530> to<00:01:10.590> be<00:01:10.770> sewn<00:01:11.010> in<00:01:11.220> there<00:01:11.430> like

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
continue straight and then take my first

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.020 
continue straight and then take my first
rectangle<00:02:26.299> and<00:02:27.010> put<00:02:28.010> it<00:02:28.160> on<00:02:28.370> there<00:02:28.640> so<00:02:29.000> that

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
right sides facing each other and then

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:41.280 
right sides facing each other and then
stitch<00:02:33.049> along<00:02:33.530> that<00:02:33.860> side<00:02:36.790> like<00:02:37.790> so

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.250 

then<00:02:42.290> flip<00:02:42.709> it<00:02:42.860> over<00:02:43.010> and<00:02:43.340> then<00:02:44.170> you're<00:02:45.170> going

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
then flip it over and then you're going

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.850 
then flip it over and then you're going
to<00:02:45.319> take<00:02:45.560> the<00:02:45.950> other<00:02:45.980> part<00:02:46.549> of<00:02:46.700> your<00:02:46.880> shirt
