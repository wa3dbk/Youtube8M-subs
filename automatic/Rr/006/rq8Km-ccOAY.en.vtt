00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
light fixture I believe that's how you

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.980 
light fixture I believe that's how you
say<00:00:29.190> it<00:00:29.220> and<00:00:29.430> the<00:00:29.940> thing<00:00:30.090> that<00:00:30.150> really<00:00:30.450> got<00:00:30.750> me

say it and the thing that really got me

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.150 
say it and the thing that really got me
with<00:00:31.140> this<00:00:31.320> is<00:00:31.530> the<00:00:31.680> 21<00:00:32.219> led<00:00:33.180> 21<00:00:33.749> 1<00:00:34.260> watt<00:00:34.499> LEDs

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
with this is the 21 led 21 1 watt LEDs

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.029 
with this is the 21 led 21 1 watt LEDs
that<00:00:35.519> come<00:00:35.879> installed<00:00:36.359> on<00:00:36.629> this<00:00:37.410> thing<00:00:37.649> really

00:00:38.029 --> 00:00:38.039 
that come installed on this thing really

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:41.000 
that come installed on this thing really
add<00:00:38.339> some<00:00:38.730> punch<00:00:39.120> to<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.449> blue<00:00:39.780> spectrum<00:00:40.320> on

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
add some punch to the blue spectrum on

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.029 
add some punch to the blue spectrum on
the<00:00:41.850> three<00:00:42.749> separate<00:00:43.199> chords<00:00:43.620> for<00:00:43.769> the<00:00:43.829> power

00:00:44.029 --> 00:00:44.039 
the three separate chords for the power

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:46.220 
the three separate chords for the power
here<00:00:44.339> the<00:00:44.460> one<00:00:44.609> for<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.059> LED<00:00:45.210> actually<00:00:45.780> has<00:00:45.960> a

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
here the one for the LED actually has a

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.529 
here the one for the LED actually has a
toggle<00:00:46.890> switch<00:00:47.100> to<00:00:47.429> go<00:00:47.550> between<00:00:47.699> high<00:00:48.179> and<00:00:48.210> low

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
toggle switch to go between high and low

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.110 
toggle switch to go between high and low
power<00:00:48.989> that<00:00:49.829> really<00:00:50.219> adds<00:00:50.429> some<00:00:50.670> versatility

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
power that really adds some versatility

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.369 
power that really adds some versatility
if<00:00:51.449> you<00:00:51.569> don't<00:00:51.719> want<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:51.929> use<00:00:52.050> it<00:00:52.079> just<00:00:52.260> for

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
if you don't want to use it just for

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:53.989 
if you don't want to use it just for
moonlighting<00:00:52.920> it<00:00:53.100> can<00:00:53.219> really<00:00:53.370> beef<00:00:53.670> up<00:00:53.819> the

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:53.999 
moonlighting it can really beef up the

00:00:53.999 --> 00:00:56.329 
moonlighting it can really beef up the
blue<00:00:54.179> end<00:00:54.329> spectrum<00:00:54.960> so<00:00:55.920> I'm<00:00:56.039> going<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.249> go

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:56.339 
blue end spectrum so I'm going to go

00:00:56.339 --> 00:00:57.860 
blue end spectrum so I'm going to go
ahead<00:00:56.370> and<00:00:56.699> throw<00:00:56.850> this<00:00:56.879> on<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.300> fish<00:00:57.510> tank

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
ahead and throw this on the fish tank

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.219 
ahead and throw this on the fish tank
and<00:00:58.050> show<00:00:58.559> you<00:00:58.620> what<00:00:58.859> it's<00:00:59.010> all<00:00:59.190> about<00:01:00.170> ok<00:01:01.170> so

and show you what it's all about ok so

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:03.820 
and show you what it's all about ok so
the<00:01:01.589> lighting<00:01:01.920> fixture<00:01:02.309> is<00:01:02.519> on<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:03.120> tank<00:01:03.389> here

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:03.830 
the lighting fixture is on the tank here

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:08.480 
the lighting fixture is on the tank here
this<00:01:04.830> is<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.159> daylight<00:01:05.579> mode<00:01:06.140> with<00:01:07.140> all<00:01:07.490> 45s

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
this is the daylight mode with all 45s

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.160 
this is the daylight mode with all 45s
on<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.710> LEDs<00:01:10.710> on<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.880> 21<00:01:12.210> 1<00:01:12.630> watt<00:01:12.810> blue

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
on and the LEDs on the 21 1 watt blue

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.340 
on and the LEDs on the 21 1 watt blue
LEDs<00:01:14.180> so<00:01:15.180> I'll<00:01:15.270> go<00:01:15.479> through<00:01:15.780> some<00:01:16.110> of<00:01:16.140> the

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
LEDs so I'll go through some of the

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.310 
LEDs so I'll go through some of the
lighting<00:01:17.189> here<00:01:17.719> so<00:01:18.719> again<00:01:18.960> this<00:01:19.110> is

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
lighting here so again this is

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.910 
lighting here so again this is
everything's<00:01:20.310> on<00:01:21.409> here<00:01:22.409> i<00:01:22.500> am<00:01:22.649> with<00:01:22.680> the

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
everything's on here i am with the

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.319 
everything's on here i am with the
actinic<00:01:23.310> and<00:01:23.789> the<00:01:24.719> leds<00:01:25.259> on<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:26.219> here's<00:01:27.180> the

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:27.329 
actinic and the leds on and here's the

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:28.609 
actinic and the leds on and here's the
one<00:01:27.479> I<00:01:27.509> really<00:01:27.780> like<00:01:27.930> hopefully<00:01:28.320> it<00:01:28.500> comes

one I really like hopefully it comes

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.440 
one I really like hopefully it comes
across<00:01:28.920> in<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.219> camera<00:01:31.579> here<00:01:32.579> is<00:01:32.729> just<00:01:33.119> the

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
across in the camera here is just the

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.359 
across in the camera here is just the
LED<00:01:34.020> lights<00:01:34.350> it<00:01:34.590> really<00:01:34.859> gives<00:01:34.950> that<00:01:35.100> nice

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
LED lights it really gives that nice

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.149 
LED lights it really gives that nice
shimmer<00:01:35.909> effect<00:01:36.090> to<00:01:36.659> it<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:37.530> colors<00:01:37.950> on

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159

everything just really pop out really
nicely<00:01:42.509> I'll<00:01:42.990> go<00:01:43.979> in<00:01:44.159> here<00:01:44.579> maybe<00:01:45.329> take<00:01:45.600> a<00:01:45.659> look

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
nicely I'll go in here maybe take a look

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.719 
nicely I'll go in here maybe take a look
at<00:01:45.990> some<00:01:46.109> of<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.350> zoos<00:01:46.590> in<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:47.009> record<00:01:47.579> iya

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
at some of the zoos in the record iya

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.779 
at some of the zoos in the record iya
here<00:01:47.969> you<00:01:48.060> can<00:01:48.210> really<00:01:48.420> see<00:01:49.219> that<00:01:50.219> record<00:01:50.670> iya

00:01:50.779 --> 00:01:50.789 
here you can really see that record iya

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:55.480 
here you can really see that record iya
standing<00:01:51.270> out<00:01:51.390> nicely<00:01:52.039> in<00:01:53.039> some<00:01:53.369> of<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.549> zoo's

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
standing out nicely in some of the zoo's

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.720 
standing out nicely in some of the zoo's
ok<00:01:56.490> um

00:01:58.720 --> 00:01:58.730 
ok um

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:01.030 

this<00:01:59.240> really<00:01:59.570> does<00:01:59.810> give<00:02:00.050> that<00:02:00.260> metal<00:02:00.620> Halid

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
this really does give that metal Halid

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.190 
this really does give that metal Halid
type<00:02:01.280> of<00:02:01.460> shimmer<00:02:01.730> effect<00:02:01.910> doesn't<00:02:02.900> show<00:02:03.170> up

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
type of shimmer effect doesn't show up

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.620 
type of shimmer effect doesn't show up
on<00:02:03.380> the<00:02:03.500> camera<00:02:03.920> quite<00:02:04.160> as<00:02:04.340> well<00:02:04.490> as<00:02:04.550> I<00:02:04.850> would

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
on the camera quite as well as I would

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.900 
on the camera quite as well as I would
hope<00:02:05.840> but<00:02:06.080> it<00:02:06.170> does<00:02:06.380> do<00:02:06.830> a<00:02:06.860> real<00:02:07.130> nice<00:02:07.340> job<00:02:07.700> with

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:07.910 
hope but it does do a real nice job with

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:13.480 
hope but it does do a real nice job with
that<00:02:11.290> I'll<00:02:12.290> show<00:02:12.650> real<00:02:12.890> quickly<00:02:13.220> the

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
that I'll show real quickly the

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.400 
that I'll show real quickly the
difference<00:02:13.910> between<00:02:14.240> the<00:02:14.360> two<00:02:14.540> levels<00:02:15.050> for

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
difference between the two levels for

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.670 
difference between the two levels for
the<00:02:15.440> lighting<00:02:15.710> for<00:02:16.700> the<00:02:16.760> LEDs<00:02:17.300> this<00:02:18.260> being<00:02:18.530> the

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
the lighting for the LEDs this being the

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.480 
the lighting for the LEDs this being the
bright<00:02:18.950> mode<00:02:19.220> does<00:02:20.120> have<00:02:20.360> that<00:02:20.510> switch<00:02:20.960> on<00:02:21.230> it

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
bright mode does have that switch on it

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:23.640 
bright mode does have that switch on it
you<00:02:22.490> can<00:02:22.670> switch<00:02:23.000> between<00:02:23.210> the<00:02:23.570> different

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
you can switch between the different

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.210 
you can switch between the different
power<00:02:24.650> levels<00:02:24.800> for<00:02:25.520> the<00:02:26.080> LEDs<00:02:27.080> so<00:02:27.950> that<00:02:28.100> was

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
power levels for the LEDs so that was

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.960 
power levels for the LEDs so that was
full<00:02:29.620> this<00:02:30.620> is<00:02:30.890> the<00:02:31.130> moon<00:02:31.310> lighting<00:02:31.580> which<00:02:31.820> I

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
full this is the moon lighting which I

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.250 
full this is the moon lighting which I
still<00:02:32.210> think<00:02:32.480> is<00:02:32.540> a<00:02:32.600> bit<00:02:32.750> too<00:02:32.960> bright<00:02:33.230> for

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
still think is a bit too bright for

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.230 
still think is a bit too bright for
moonlighting<00:02:33.830> so<00:02:34.070> I've<00:02:34.160> got<00:02:34.370> a<00:02:34.580> couple

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:35.240 
moonlighting so I've got a couple

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.140 
moonlighting so I've got a couple
different<00:02:36.040> LED<00:02:37.040> lights<00:02:37.400> on<00:02:37.670> that<00:02:37.850> I<00:02:37.940> use<00:02:38.120> for

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
different LED lights on that I use for

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.570 
different LED lights on that I use for
the<00:02:38.330> moonlighting<00:02:38.860> you<00:02:39.860> can<00:02:40.010> kind<00:02:40.250> of<00:02:40.310> see<00:02:40.490> in

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
the moonlighting you can kind of see in

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.850 
the moonlighting you can kind of see in
here<00:02:40.790> maybe<00:02:41.000> not<00:02:41.990> really<00:02:42.200> they're<00:02:42.440> very<00:02:42.620> dim

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
here maybe not really they're very dim

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.230 
here maybe not really they're very dim
so<00:02:43.400> but<00:02:44.000> that's<00:02:44.180> the<00:02:44.390> full<00:02:44.680> power<00:02:45.970> and<00:02:46.970> again

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:47.240 
so but that's the full power and again

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:55.060 
so but that's the full power and again
here's<00:02:47.570> with<00:02:47.780> the<00:02:47.990> tynix<00:02:48.770> back<00:02:49.010> on<00:02:53.350> and<00:02:54.350> then

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
here's with the tynix back on and then

00:02:55.070 --> 00:03:01.240 
here's with the tynix back on and then
the<00:02:55.340> daylight<00:02:58.690> there<00:02:59.690> we<00:02:59.810> go<00:03:00.070> those<00:03:01.070> are<00:03:01.220> all

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
the daylight there we go those are all

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.030 
the daylight there we go those are all
the<00:03:01.550> phases<00:03:01.810> the<00:03:02.810> one<00:03:02.990> drawback<00:03:03.260> i<00:03:03.500> found<00:03:03.920> was

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
the phases the one drawback i found was

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.490 
the phases the one drawback i found was
it<00:03:04.160> wasn't<00:03:04.430> able<00:03:04.580> to<00:03:04.730> fit<00:03:04.940> under<00:03:05.090> my<00:03:05.330> hood<00:03:05.630> not

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
it wasn't able to fit under my hood not

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.860 
it wasn't able to fit under my hood not
a<00:03:06.530> problem<00:03:06.950> for<00:03:06.980> everyone<00:03:07.630> actually<00:03:08.630> more

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
a problem for everyone actually more

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.990 
a problem for everyone actually more
into<00:03:09.050> showing<00:03:09.260> it<00:03:09.500> off<00:03:09.620> so<00:03:09.950> it<00:03:10.220> probably<00:03:10.760> won't

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
into showing it off so it probably won't

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.740 
into showing it off so it probably won't
put<00:03:11.209> the<00:03:11.330> hood<00:03:11.540> back<00:03:11.780> on<00:03:12.010> even<00:03:13.010> if<00:03:13.100> i<00:03:13.220> could<00:03:13.750> and

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
put the hood back on even if i could and

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.990 
put the hood back on even if i could and
then<00:03:14.959> the<00:03:15.380> power<00:03:15.739> cords<00:03:16.160> and<00:03:16.430> the<00:03:16.580> on/off

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
then the power cords and the on/off

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.520 
then the power cords and the on/off
switches<00:03:17.300> are<00:03:17.570> actually<00:03:17.870> on<00:03:17.959> the<00:03:17.989> side<00:03:18.290> of<00:03:18.320> the

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
switches are actually on the side of the

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.130 
switches are actually on the side of the
unit<00:03:18.800> as<00:03:18.950> well<00:03:19.459> as<00:03:19.850> the<00:03:20.030> fans<00:03:20.420> so<00:03:20.810> that<00:03:20.959> might

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
unit as well as the fans so that might

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.350 
unit as well as the fans so that might
be<00:03:21.170> something<00:03:21.290> you<00:03:21.709> need<00:03:21.950> to<00:03:22.100> accommodate<00:03:22.940> for

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360 
be something you need to accommodate for

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.750 
be something you need to accommodate for
if<00:03:23.510> you<00:03:23.660> wanted<00:03:23.930> to<00:03:24.020> put<00:03:24.230> it<00:03:24.260> in<00:03:24.590> a<00:03:25.250> canopy<00:03:25.730> or

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
if you wanted to put it in a canopy or

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.790 
if you wanted to put it in a canopy or
hood<00:03:26.120> cabinet<00:03:26.900> or<00:03:27.050> whatever<00:03:27.320> you<00:03:27.470> wanted<00:03:27.709> to

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:27.800 
hood cabinet or whatever you wanted to

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:33.970 
hood cabinet or whatever you wanted to
do<00:03:28.030> so<00:03:29.030> there<00:03:29.209> we<00:03:29.360> are<00:03:30.430> 45<00:03:31.690> bulbs<00:03:32.690> and<00:03:32.900> 21<00:03:33.650> 1

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
do so there we are 45 bulbs and 21 1

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.500 
do so there we are 45 bulbs and 21 1
watt<00:03:34.250> blue<00:03:35.120> LEDs<00:03:35.840> working<00:03:36.320> together
