from<00:01:49.649> my<00:01:49.770> network<00:01:49.950> so<00:01:50.249> I<00:01:50.310> get<00:01:50.490> a<00:01:50.520> network

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
from my network so I get a network

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.669 
from my network so I get a network
address<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:51.659> a<00:01:51.840> gateway<00:01:52.049> and<00:01:52.200> all<00:01:52.380> that<00:01:52.560> that

00:01:52.669 --> 00:01:52.679 
address and a gateway and all that that

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:54.709 
address and a gateway and all that that
makes<00:01:52.889> it<00:01:52.979> kind<00:01:53.159> of<00:01:53.219> simple<00:01:53.429> but<00:01:54.329> what<00:01:54.479> I<00:01:54.509> need

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:54.719 
makes it kind of simple but what I need

once<00:05:38.190> you<00:05:38.310> define<00:05:38.610> those<00:05:38.790> things<00:05:39.150> you're

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:39.300 
once you define those things you're

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:43.040 
once you define those things you're
going<00:05:39.390> to<00:05:39.480> go<00:05:39.660> to<00:05:39.690> the<00:05:40.520> phone<00:05:41.780> specific<00:05:42.780> file

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.050 
going to go to the phone specific file

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:45.080 
going to go to the phone specific file
and<00:05:43.410> you're<00:05:43.560> going<00:05:43.680> to<00:05:43.710> define<00:05:44.190> a<00:05:44.220> label<00:05:44.970> for

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:45.090 
and you're going to define a label for

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:46.820 
and you're going to define a label for
the<00:05:45.150> top<00:05:45.390> of<00:05:45.600> the<00:05:45.660> phone<00:05:45.900> and<00:05:46.200> then<00:05:46.710> you're

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:46.830 
the top of the phone and then you're

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:50.000 
the top of the phone and then you're
going<00:05:46.920> to<00:05:46.980> define<00:05:47.370> your<00:05:48.120> line<00:05:48.420> so<00:05:48.840> we<00:05:48.990> got<00:05:49.170> line

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:50.010 
going to define your line so we got line

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:51.410 
going to define your line so we got line
name<00:05:50.340> which<00:05:50.640> I'm<00:05:50.790> just<00:05:50.940> calling<00:05:51.210> it<00:05:51.270> my

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:51.420 
name which I'm just calling it my

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:53.840 
name which I'm just calling it my
extension<00:05:51.990> and<00:05:52.280> it's<00:05:53.280> because<00:05:53.580> I'm<00:05:53.670> going<00:05:53.790> to

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:53.850 
extension and it's because I'm going to

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:55.220 
extension and it's because I'm going to
show<00:05:54.030> it<00:05:54.150> several<00:05:54.450> times<00:05:54.690> I<00:05:54.930> thought<00:05:55.050> it's

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:55.230 
show it several times I thought it's

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:57.770 
show it several times I thought it's
nice<00:05:55.440> to<00:05:55.650> annotate<00:05:56.250> it<00:05:56.400> with<00:05:56.430> a<00:05:56.550> dash<00:05:56.820> 1<00:05:57.150> +<00:05:57.390> -<00:05:57.570> 2

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:57.780 
nice to annotate it with a dash 1 + - 2

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:00.890 
nice to annotate it with a dash 1 + - 2
&amp;<00:05:57.930> 3<00:05:57.960> so<00:05:58.920> you<00:05:59.040> need<00:05:59.250> the<00:05:59.760> name<00:06:00.030> the<00:06:00.330> password

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:00.900 
&amp; 3 so you need the name the password

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:03.740 
&amp; 3 so you need the name the password
and<00:06:01.530> down<00:06:01.860> here<00:06:02.100> the<00:06:02.220> authorization<00:06:03.000> name<00:06:03.240> and

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:03.750 
and down here the authorization name and

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:06.980 
and down here the authorization name and
that's<00:06:04.410> it<00:06:04.680> so<00:06:04.890> as<00:06:05.520> this<00:06:06.120> file<00:06:06.360> said<00:06:06.720> I<00:06:06.750> can

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:06.990 
that's it so as this file said I can

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:08.360 
that's it so as this file said I can
configure<00:06:07.320> up<00:06:07.560> to<00:06:07.680> four<00:06:07.950> different<00:06:08.070> line

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:08.370 
configure up to four different line

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:09.830 
configure up to four different line
appearances<00:06:08.880> on<00:06:09.000> my<00:06:09.120> phone<00:06:09.330> if<00:06:09.480> I<00:06:09.570> have<00:06:09.720> them

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:09.840 
appearances on my phone if I have them

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:11.930 
appearances on my phone if I have them
available<00:06:10.110> and<00:06:10.560> I<00:06:11.130> set<00:06:11.460> it<00:06:11.490> to<00:06:11.730> what<00:06:11.910> I

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:11.940 
available and I set it to what I

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:14.660 
available and I set it to what I
configured<00:06:12.930> in<00:06:13.080> elastics<00:06:14.070> and<00:06:14.190> it<00:06:14.310> works<00:06:14.460> just

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:14.670 
configured in elastics and it works just

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:18.410 
configured in elastics and it works just
fine<00:06:16.370> now<00:06:17.370> let's<00:06:17.580> navigate<00:06:17.730> to<00:06:18.060> the<00:06:18.180> web

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:18.420 
fine now let's navigate to the web

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:21.620 
fine now let's navigate to the web
directory<00:06:19.290> that<00:06:19.890> we're<00:06:20.580> housing<00:06:21.270> those<00:06:21.390> files

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:21.630 
directory that we're housing those files

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:24.200 
directory that we're housing those files
and<00:06:21.990> so<00:06:22.110> it's<00:06:22.230> a<00:06:22.380> stock<00:06:22.650> directory<00:06:23.250> that<00:06:23.280> Pachi

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:24.210 
and so it's a stock directory that Pachi

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:30.140 
and so it's a stock directory that Pachi
uses<00:06:24.720> so<00:06:25.470> my<00:06:25.650> VAR<00:06:26.070> WW<00:06:27.860> HTML<00:06:28.860> directory<00:06:29.370> and<00:06:29.670> I

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:30.150 
uses so my VAR WW HTML directory and I

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:33.110 
uses so my VAR WW HTML directory and I
created<00:06:30.570> a<00:06:30.720> Cisco<00:06:31.140> folder<00:06:31.560> here<00:06:31.770> and<00:06:32.030> in<00:06:33.030> the

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:33.120 
created a Cisco folder here and in the

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:34.880 
created a Cisco folder here and in the
Cisco<00:06:33.450> folder<00:06:33.840> I<00:06:33.870> housed<00:06:34.140> a<00:06:34.290> couple<00:06:34.590> different

phone I have directory XML which I just
basically<00:06:43.440> took<00:06:43.680> the<00:06:43.860> example

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:44.340 
basically took the example

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:46.189 
basically took the example
that<00:06:44.490> were<00:06:44.580> there<00:06:44.820> added<00:06:45.540> a<00:06:45.600> couple<00:06:45.930> different

00:06:46.189 --> 00:06:46.199 
that were there added a couple different

00:06:46.199 --> 00:06:47.570 
that were there added a couple different
things<00:06:46.230> and<00:06:46.620> I<00:06:46.680> was<00:06:46.800> able<00:06:46.919> to<00:06:47.040> make<00:06:47.220> that<00:06:47.400> come

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:47.580 
things and I was able to make that come

up<00:06:47.730> I'm<00:06:47.850> not<00:06:48.000> an<00:06:48.120> XML<00:06:48.540> programmer<00:06:48.960> but<00:06:49.470> it<00:06:49.560> was

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:49.650 
up I'm not an XML programmer but it was

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:52.010 
up I'm not an XML programmer but it was
simple<00:06:49.949> enough<00:06:49.980> to<00:06:50.250> follow<00:06:50.460> and<00:06:50.990> then<00:06:51.990> the

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:52.020 
simple enough to follow and then the

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:54.219 
simple enough to follow and then the
last<00:06:52.380> thing<00:06:52.560> that<00:06:52.590> I<00:06:52.770> worked<00:06:52.979> with<00:06:53.160> was<00:06:53.460> the

00:06:54.219 --> 00:06:54.229 
last thing that I worked with was the

00:06:54.229 --> 00:06:57.800 
last thing that I worked with was the
services<00:06:55.229> and<00:06:55.940> basically<00:06:56.940> all<00:06:57.300> I<00:06:57.330> did<00:06:57.479> was

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:57.810 
services and basically all I did was

00:06:57.810 --> 00:06:59.570 
services and basically all I did was
just<00:06:57.840> put<00:06:58.199> up<00:06:58.290> some<00:06:58.710> text<00:06:59.220> in<00:06:59.310> there<00:06:59.430> that

00:06:59.570 --> 00:06:59.580 
just put up some text in there that

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:01.760 
just put up some text in there that
indicates<00:07:00.240> that<00:07:00.479> it<00:07:00.870> file<00:07:01.080> in<00:07:01.199> something<00:07:01.590> so

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:01.770
