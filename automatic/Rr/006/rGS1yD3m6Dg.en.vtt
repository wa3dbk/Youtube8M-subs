00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:09.650
 Dude, friends here who says 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:12.500
 that the plumber plummeted and another broke 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.059
 if for another one like playing with and then 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.520
 time here we will play with will be with 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:19.850
 madrid athletic team 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:22.400
 Is it athletic from Madrid? 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:24.440
 Spanish championship sure we will see here 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.029
 so what training I decided to choose 

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.640
 for athletic madrid does with this 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:31.609
 number on the screen and will be the schematic 4 2 3 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:34.670
 1 is how you can see there the 4 2 3 1 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:37.819
 default has 14 231 open but is not 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.710
 better choose the 4 2 3 1 for Adam gives 

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:42.469
 Give today as I am speaking. 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.420
 let's see the cast now in the goal 

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:46.429
 goalkeeper did not cut the Belgian goalkeeper 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.129
 right side roni fran 

00:00:46.429 --> 00:00:51.920
 on the back miranda and godín by the side 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:53.510
 left filipe luis de volante sakineh 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:57.229
 two steering wheels two central socks too 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:59.059
 raul garcia and gabi by the sock 

00:00:57.229 --> 00:01:02.209
 right midfielder here is sock 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:05.420
 right and gave the culture air by the sock 

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:07.940
 shipowner me that the attacker is by adrien 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.460
 left half point guard is the 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.770
 cristian rodriguez is obvious that saying 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:16.670
 avant is going to be our dear hawk 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:18.770
 garcia then the best striker in the world 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.420
 present in his position he is the 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.250
 The best in the world, there's nothing to talk about. 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.900
 we will now see that the three substitutes 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.450
 What do I have for this team? 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.130
 the first will be here Diego Costa is 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.500
 when are we going to replace who 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.640
 by diego coast and remove the advance 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.920
 when will adrian tire 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.590
 already the Diego coast here in his place is 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.900
 the day almost also works for a place 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:42.050
 hawk here with hawk 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.909
 hawk hurt you put the hawk to 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.280
 here and boxer boot the plane here from 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:49.490
 center and leave the diego coast here 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:52.270
 half guard beauty is the next will 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:55.280
 be our dear friend here that I need 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:57.979
 it was sponsored by the coca cola it here 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.200
 we will vote for the arda turan 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:02.240
 who will probably get tired of the team 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.170
 tires very quickly and helped that they do not have 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.150
 too much resistance 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.640
 Let's vote for him instead of the arda. 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:10.909
 turan beauty and another player that we 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:13.549
 going to use is going to be the oliver towers 

00:02:10.909 --> 00:02:14.030
 here is a boy is still very young 

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:16.340
 I do not have 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.319
 good accounting and how they can 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.150
 but we will take place of the Christian 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:22.010
 rodriguez who will also tire but if the 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.290
 attack of this really will tire behind 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.150
 and the defensive midfield animals will not 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.459
 bored much more is going to be that mean 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.170
 offensive field and the attacker is 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:32.720
 usually these three here than what the 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.670
 panel drew adrian and cristian 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.500
 rodriguez are the three who will get bored 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.810
 More understand boot here the oliver towers 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.790
 in the place of cristian rodriguez right 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.530
 so this is the team there we will give a 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.330
 final glance that looks at how the team 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.280
 is to simplify the 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.230
 Let's see how the games went now. 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.180
 I did here today with athletic 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:53.600
 madrid we will give an overall opinion on 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:56.000
 the team and then boyfriend the first in 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.459
 English will see will be against Bayern 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.709
 from munique then at stake and let's talk 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:02.420
 now let the team start talking about a 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:05.269
 fusion position is the first goalkeeper 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:07.430
 cut it if you already know, you say you saw the 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:11.060
 My team knows I loved Porto I think 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.680
 he a very good goalkeeper're last 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.600
 day I found it very good and here too 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:18.380
 I find it very safe as well as 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:20.810
 it is very high number is 1 196 is a business is 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:22.820
 very loud and that helps a lot, because 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.620
 though he does not position as well 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:26.360
 so that he can from the bridge can pick up 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.250
 ball it arrives much faster than the 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.140
 other goalkeepers in the then it helps to 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.610
 goalkeeper height really influences and 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.280
 I liked the government a lot about the 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:36.170
 number 1 very safe there right? 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.440
 another factor of him being a goalkeeper that I 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:41.120
 found it very safe is because the defense of the 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:43.040
 athletic from madrid quique is good for 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.480
 0 damn flue although not 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.370
 obvious that it is not better to 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.980
 Spanish championship or close up but it is 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.750
 a sensational saga a miranda and the godín 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.000
 are two very good defenders because 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:56.989
 because besides being physically strong 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.970
 nor has a blue marking and a good average 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:01.040
 they are agile is also both in 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:02.720
 high speeds nor for the quarterback right 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.640
 this helps a lot when it comes to 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.140
 you fight with your opponent is 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.780
 I need to get playing with the bayern 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:10.570
 munich to catch the ribery picked up 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:14.180
 robinho him that the two run that not 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:17.959
 I do not know how I did in shooting took some 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:20.000
 connotation there to compare but he is 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:21.380
 very good to hit type of player one 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.539
 fast player because he is very strong 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:25.700
 really an attacking player more 

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:28.460
 fast he is already weaker then 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:30.320
 your defender is strong and fast and 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.890
 this helps a lot, there was no vacancy 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.660
 very good 

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:34.850
 the sides are also very good filipe 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:36.890
 Luis and I really liked him he is a 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:40.010
 left side without this is no longer 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:41.930
 to support the same attack is in defense 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:43.400
 I do not know that he signs 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:46.550
 missed a little bit is still missing 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:48.500
 learning the defense is already a side 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:50.660
 right that's our darling there oh oh 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:52.700
 oh Andrew and also quite like it 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:54.980
 he is already a more defensive defender 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:57.320
 same is a defender one more lateral 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:05:00.470
 but he's very good at that. 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:02.480
 I said it as well as being very good in 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:04.430
 defensively he is very fast okay 

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:05.930
 he is the fastest player on the team is the 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:08.900
 striker imagines a very fast team 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:11.300
 but he is a faster player of the team and is 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:14.000
 for them and this very good defense he 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:16.280
 help a lot in this regard then okay 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.620
 use the left side and not 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:20.510
 left side filipe luis more 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:21.500
 Protaxi the right I advise the 

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:23.420
 animal protection 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:25.490
 although the player refrain that 

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:27.200
 rises well until her son hers but the defense 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:29.750
 I feel safer with it okay 

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:31.010
 the two fliers there gabi and raul 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:32.960
 garcia 

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:34.850
 I thought it was very quiet and we 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:36.680
 do their job very well is raul 

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:39.050
 Garcia but the same batting player I 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:41.030
 I found him, that steering wheel is gone. 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:42.620
 even and gabriel mendes is a bit more 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:44.150
 the game and I got to have a little more 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:46.370
 quality on the ball pass then on time 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:48.050
 you are using the two are 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:50.330
 wet when you have the ball in place of 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:52.880
 70 gives a pass one more thing is a 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:55.400
 launch a more difficult thing with 

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:58.130
 garcia already marked more because it is the 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:02.120
 its right in front of us today 

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:03.560
 oo adrien arda turan and cristian 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:06.050
 rodriguez nor are the three 

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:08.960
 forward there in the 3000 offensive fields 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:10.820
 the adrian if talking is not sensational he 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:12.590
 He plays a lot of it and he's the guy who goes. 

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:15.950
 Run for you, huh? 

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:17.480
 this madrid athletic team is a 

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:19.790
 difference here than I used to play 

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:21.530
 because I thought it was bad to attack 

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:23.450
 tips with this team, I do not like it very much 

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:26.660
 I think I 'll stay there a little 

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:29.510
 although a few hours is good because 

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:31.580
 You have to use the convertible nod 

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:33.920
 with hawk garcia nods very well but 

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:35.150
 and I preferred the smell, I got more 

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:38.000
 I got to play better with him. 

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:40.280
 attacking in the middle, right? 

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.470
 in the middle field you start there by 

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:44.600
 side the room crying and with cristian 

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:46.100
 rodriguez but instead of you correct 

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:47.750
 side to try to cross to try 

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:49.610
 enter on the side is not with the ball 

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:53.030
 in midfield that will already entering the 

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:54.830
 two to try to get ahead of the 

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:56.720
 where they are understanding 

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:57.890
 but instead of attacking from both sides 

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:59.210
 of the adversary 

00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:01.340
 First you touch the front you. 

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:03.410
 cross same field as if it were 

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:03.890
 in a vertical and vertical line not 

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:06.170
 lost 

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:08.330
 a line is the name is not now 

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:08.990
 horizontal and vertical is so horizontal 

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:11.090
 and so 

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:13.070
 so the diagonal it there in Maria 

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:15.350
 I think diagonally you put more pressure 

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:17.750
 is as much as an arrow even know if 

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:20.300
 go in the middle so direct the balls 

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:22.010
 for hawk there and there will be solved with 

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:25.370
 the hawk can not even talk right 

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:27.169
 is a phenomenal player right the farm 

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:29.690
 then it is basically okay hope 

00:07:27.169 --> 00:07:31.490
 have liked my opinion is that the 

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:33.380
 athletic of madrid as I said attack 

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:35.660
 by the way it's going to work 

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:36.800
 was a team that uses the Africans there he 

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:38.480
