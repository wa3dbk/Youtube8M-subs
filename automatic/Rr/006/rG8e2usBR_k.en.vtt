00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:04.840
 hello very good to all people today 

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:09.280
 I bring a video plus a video of how 

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:11.530
 make this movement of letters worth 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:14.380
 this movement is a very movement 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:16.689
 Easy to perform simple and fun to 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:20.109
 time to teach that when you do it with 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:22.089
 good people 2 because they will try and 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:25.599
 the letters I assure you that they are going to 

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:26.699
 fall everywhere then for 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:30.130
 learn to make this movement 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:32.559
 you will need three things one of them a 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:35.980
 deck does not matter if Spanish poker 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:38.530
 verbal the second a site where 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:41.289
 practice a place to practice that 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:44.320
 be comfortable and easy to pick up at the same time 

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:47.140
 the letters because because if you do it in 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.670
 corridor for example if the Oscar 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.230
 letters 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.320
 it is very uncomfortable to be all the time 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:55.679
 stooping picking up the stand and also 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:58.929
 your letters get dirty very easily 

00:00:55.679 --> 00:01:01.659
 then I would recommend the bed 

00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:03.910
 your room is very comfortable and 

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:07.780
 time it's easy to pick up 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:10.450
 then stop to perform for 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:13.000
 perform the movement 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.549
 let's start with the position of the 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.039
 hand the position of the hand with which 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:19.600
 we are going to collect the letters what 

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:22.479
 we will need to put on the little finger 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:25.539
 down like this in this position of such 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:27.579
 way that when I throw the letters the 

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:29.159
 little finger makes the letters do not fall 

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:33.149
 down 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:35.479
 so then the second thing that you have 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:38.580
 what to do is catch your ring finger 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:41.100
 and put it in the corner 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:44.310
 so in the corner followed by your 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.890
 finger heart and index and now finger 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.730
 thumb in the corner 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.960
 Now what will you have to do will be double 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:54.360
 put your hand as I said 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.090
 before with the little finger down and go 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.380
 releasing letters at the beginning that 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.899
 it will happen 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.899
 Well, the letters will go to you in heaps 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:06.780
 so they will not pass anything stopping 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.729
 I started like that and I would recommend that you started 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.400
 to 6 well little by little bit a little 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.800
 distance when you go out 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.920
 letters more or less followed then 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:21.250
 you will take more and more distance and more and more 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:23.740
 distance is worth then 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:26.260
 that this is all this movement of 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:27.970
 letters if you want to learn me what 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.819
 you say for comments it's worth it 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:35.379
 it's very easy and simple then 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:37.639
 give it a like if you like favorites 

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:42.790

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:42.790
