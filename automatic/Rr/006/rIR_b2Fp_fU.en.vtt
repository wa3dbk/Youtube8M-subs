00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:06.990
 I understand I understand that will be the 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.540
 fox 1 and the cro and then we have 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.639
 Of course these are louder 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.290
 that's the quota, so to speak 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.730
 links are more the programs 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.710
 Of course not available 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.840
 but theoretically I could 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:23.480
 close window no no no 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:27.090
 of course not 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:31.040
 Do not we want to get to know each other? 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:33.320
 times you can already 1 meter 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:35.850
 turn this folder 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.360
 So here we are - and 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.370
 folder 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.579
 Everything is exactly the same here 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.860
 like fcb today you would have to do that too 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.260
 dolls can if you have the bootloader 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.660
 bit configured so we have 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.059
 also user and user and when we are on 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.340
 desktop then go oval backgrounds 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.379
 Everything is there so you could theoretically 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:59.969
 his old data from these folders 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:01.260
 copy and then move or roman 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.830
 maybe pay attention to maybe 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.080
 teams is the same plate and has 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.100
 you get your data back 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.900
 and if we need that one now 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.140
 nothing come because that's it really 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:19.110
 64 bit is what he learned windows that 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:20.850
 the pressure on the at least break so and 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.250
 If we see town and system here 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.100
 Type 64 bit operating system 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.330
 We have managed to have products 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.170
 Of course we are small now that they are there 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.159
 is down here 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.270
 he is now running for 30 days in the theme mode 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:36.270
 and when we activate then click 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:40.439
 just do not give gaddafi on it now 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:42.060
 because otherwise the evaluation we want 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.350
 not so we can but here 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.369
 Change product if you have one 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:50.299
 own have finished now 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:52.680
 Transfer is completed phenomenon 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:54.180
 Transfer the elements to the list 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.189
 programs may start 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.790
 the target computer event should that 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:02.340
 look at crew this is one 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:05.399
 checklist perfect chrome we would have 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:09.000
 still install yes then this has the 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:11.250
 Sagittarius more information yes that is 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.060
 a perfect checklist can do it all 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.700
 exactly 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.840
 What if I'm still missing and what they are 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.989
 maybe not install anymore 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.970
 it wanted so transfer report 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:24.630
 user account was transferred to user 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:26.819
 transferred to the user more perfectly so 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:30.870
 what is there and document everything completely 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:32.730
 exactly what is transmitted and is perfect 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.650
 he actually has and 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:44.330
 system settings actually has 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:44.330
 actually, that works great 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:50.819
 to always click twice to where 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:53.970
 comes that is that could have saved 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:56.760
 but okay but did mine work 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.840
 Ladies and gentlemen we need the computer 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.709
 still with restart 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.400
 we will not do that now and that 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.290
 will not do that either 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:09.390
 Here you can have your own product here 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:10.950
 enter who have typed him in and 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.980
 then he presses the thumb is this 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:16.859
 but is usually recognized if 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:22.500
 it is the same windows version then 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:26.609
 should we that was that again 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:32.069
 gibson why we because he really 

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:35.660
 its not like i can handle 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:37.680
 actually windows 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.840
 I'll probably have to start 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:45.870
 Let's start another idea like that 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:48.620
 flo therefore the new means em 64 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:54.660
 bit i hope that it also ranges so 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:58.250
 great fun I have one 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:04:01.920
 little read your posts and 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:03.660
 Of course, a problem like the previous year I 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.880
 I'm going to install windows 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.769
 installation is done and he started 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.549
 new there is nothing black anymore 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:12.359
 screens 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:14.160
 Of course this is difficult that can happen 

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:16.709
 connected volumes are the 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:20.720
 which somehow blocks the boot process 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:22.950
 this can be a wrong installation 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.180
 come because maybe the volume 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.039
 broken is even already 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.840
 funny there are so many 

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:28.620
 possibilities and there it is unfortunately very 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:33.120
 heavy 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:34.470
 help with windows xp and vista 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:37.380
 I believe it occurred more often 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:39.120
 but windows 7 i have to say i have 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.840
 then and never had problems with one 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.400
 installation 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.139
 but I had a problem that 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:48.090
 I therefore the wrong data the staff 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:52.979
 with 64 bit and that is 32 hardware 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:54.449
 does not work hard now 

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:59.490
 Let's see if we can 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:05:01.710
 now in our fix our problem 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:05.449
 apparently can not why can i 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:05.449
 that's not what he writes behind the gate 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:13.009
 because of so again now that he knew 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:15.479
 not him 

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:19.470
 small but fine it has gone now 

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:21.240
 Not only can I do that, well, I hope so 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:22.830
 could help you with this a little further 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:26.280
 and I hope you do not agree 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:29.220
 I am very bored now 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:30.720
 thought it is long in the corner wool 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.800
 you can make a new video again 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:34.260
 you might like to go to the 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:36.229
 timestamps pay attention to the last videos 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:38.340
 were 12 years old 

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:40.400
 I will try again 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:43.080
 to make a little more videos 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:45.810
 Unfortunately, it is work-related and 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:48.599
 Technically very difficult to do and 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:51.720
 the next problem is what it is 

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:54.479
 already too many problems videos 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:58.320
 on youtube and it does not make sense if 

00:05:54.479 --> 00:06:00.930
 then these solutions yourself 

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:04.169
 he tells, so to speak 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:06.840
 this problem solution from 32 to 64 bit 

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:07.919
 is also somewhere on youtube me 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:10.110
 I thought it probably will 

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:12.479
 not as detailed as mine 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:14.159
 that's why the new slogan computer 

00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:17.570
 tutorials in their own way 

00:06:14.159 --> 00:06:22.229
 because I thought tutorials for everyone 

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:24.960
 the fifth a whole while is like you 

00:06:22.229 --> 00:06:28.830
 see and is not for everyone and 

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:30.690
 that's why computer tutorials for the one 

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:32.230
 or others still write 

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:34.830
 but thought 

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:34.830
 encode
