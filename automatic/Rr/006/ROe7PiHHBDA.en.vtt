00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
with a ghost drawing so that I can

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.250

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.639 
pencils total and for full auto mode it
is<00:00:56.969> necessary<00:00:57.629> to<00:00:57.719> put<00:00:58.050> pressure<00:00:58.289> on<00:00:58.559> the

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
is necessary to put pressure on the

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.860 
is necessary to put pressure on the
pencils<00:00:59.070> because<00:00:59.579> gravity<00:01:00.239> isn't<00:01:00.480> quick

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
pencils because gravity isn't quick

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.510 
pencils because gravity isn't quick
enough<00:01:01.109> to<00:01:01.140> reload<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.829> pencils<00:01:02.219> into<00:01:02.340> the

you

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.420 

seems<00:02:14.900> like<00:02:15.140> I<00:02:15.380> did<00:02:15.770> kill<00:02:16.040> all<00:02:16.220> the<00:02:16.400> zombies

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.740 
seems like I did kill all the zombies
although<00:02:17.240> there<00:02:17.600> is<00:02:17.780> collateral<00:02:18.560> damage

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
although there is collateral damage

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:20.920 
although there is collateral damage
hahaha

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
hahaha

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
hahaha
I<00:02:21.190> have<00:02:22.190> with<00:02:22.430> with<00:02:22.610> the<00:02:22.820> mo<00:02:23.200> although<00:02:24.200> some<00:02:24.920> of

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
I have with with the mo although some of

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.080 
I have with with the mo although some of
them<00:02:25.190> are<00:02:25.340> in<00:02:25.580> need<00:02:25.790> of<00:02:25.820> a<00:02:26.060> bit<00:02:26.210> of<00:02:26.300> sharpening

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
them are in need of a bit of sharpening

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.430 
them are in need of a bit of sharpening
next<00:02:29.090> you<00:02:29.210> will<00:02:29.420> certainly<00:02:29.630> ask<00:02:29.960> about<00:02:30.260> the

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
next you will certainly ask about the

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.250 
next you will certainly ask about the
distance<00:02:30.860> where<00:02:31.640> 10<00:02:32.030> sets<00:02:32.300> aren't<00:02:32.660> very<00:02:32.840> ideal

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
distance where 10 sets aren't very ideal

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.080 
distance where 10 sets aren't very ideal
projectiles<00:02:33.920> because<00:02:34.310> they<00:02:34.490> are<00:02:34.550> not<00:02:34.700> for

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
projectiles because they are not for

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.000 
projectiles because they are not for
front<00:02:35.570> heavy<00:02:35.780> and<00:02:36.080> also<00:02:36.500> they<00:02:36.740> have<00:02:36.860> no

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
front heavy and also they have no

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.890 
front heavy and also they have no
fletching<00:02:37.460> this<00:02:38.060> means<00:02:38.330> that<00:02:38.540> they<00:02:38.720> will

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
fletching this means that they will

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.170 
fletching this means that they will
stumble<00:02:39.170> after<00:02:39.710> a<00:02:39.740> short<00:02:40.130> flight<00:02:40.340> to<00:02:40.880> show<00:02:41.120> you

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
stumble after a short flight to show you

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.300 
stumble after a short flight to show you
the<00:02:41.450> effect<00:02:41.780> I'm<00:02:42.020> going<00:02:42.560> to<00:02:42.650> shoot<00:02:42.800> a<00:02:42.950> little

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
the effect I'm going to shoot a little

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.550 
the effect I'm going to shoot a little
longer<00:02:43.490> distance<00:02:44.030> and<00:02:44.300> we're<00:02:45.110> going<00:02:45.260> to<00:02:45.350> see

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
longer distance and we're going to see

00:02:45.560 --> 00:03:01.930 
longer distance and we're going to see
how<00:02:45.770> the<00:02:45.830> arrows<00:02:46.370> fly

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:11.470 

you

here's<00:03:12.020> what<00:03:12.260> I<00:03:12.290> came<00:03:12.410> up<00:03:12.560> with<00:03:12.740> to<00:03:13.069> solve

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
here's what I came up with to solve

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.030 
here's what I came up with to solve
their<00:03:13.490> problem<00:03:14.060> homemade<00:03:14.930> pencils<00:03:15.560> of<00:03:15.739> doom

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
their problem homemade pencils of doom

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.800 
their problem homemade pencils of doom
ha

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
ha

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.400 
ha
so<00:03:18.590> these<00:03:19.130> are<00:03:19.310> turned<00:03:19.690> from<00:03:20.690> nine<00:03:21.050> inch<00:03:21.290> nails

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
so these are turned from nine inch nails

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:24.040 
so these are turned from nine inch nails
the<00:03:22.190> tips<00:03:22.400> made<00:03:22.790> from<00:03:22.970> steel<00:03:23.209> this<00:03:23.989> is

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.050 
the tips made from steel this is

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:27.339 
the tips made from steel this is
aluminum<00:03:24.700> tube<00:03:25.700> as<00:03:25.910> a<00:03:25.940> shaft<00:03:26.239> and<00:03:26.569> I<00:03:27.050> even

00:03:27.339 --> 00:03:27.349 
aluminum tube as a shaft and I even

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:31.330 
aluminum tube as a shaft and I even
glued<00:03:27.560> in<00:03:27.739> a<00:03:27.950> piece<00:03:28.190> of<00:03:28.340> a<00:03:28.459> turndown<00:03:29.200> pencil<00:03:30.340> so

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
glued in a piece of a turndown pencil so

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.190 
glued in a piece of a turndown pencil so
that<00:03:31.370> there<00:03:31.700> is<00:03:31.790> an<00:03:31.880> end<00:03:32.060> cap<00:03:32.300> these<00:03:32.660> are<00:03:32.900> very

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
that there is an end cap these are very

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.199 
that there is an end cap these are very
much<00:03:33.380> front-heavy<00:03:33.770> therefore<00:03:34.640> they<00:03:34.790> fly

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
much front-heavy therefore they fly

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:48.150 
much front-heavy therefore they fly
stable

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.729 

you

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:51.739 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:54.100 

this<00:03:52.340> fly<00:03:52.610> alarm<00:03:52.909> are<00:03:53.090> straight<00:03:53.360> and<00:03:53.569> they

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.110 
this fly alarm are straight and they

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:57.399 
this fly alarm are straight and they
have<00:03:54.230> a<00:03:54.260> lot<00:03:54.439> more<00:03:54.470> momentum<00:03:55.069> I<00:03:56.049> think<00:03:57.049> a<00:03:57.200> few

00:03:57.399 --> 00:03:57.409 
have a lot more momentum I think a few

00:03:57.409 --> 00:04:00.550 
have a lot more momentum I think a few
of<00:03:57.500> them<00:03:57.769> will<00:03:57.980> be<00:03:58.069> very<00:03:58.310> painful<00:03:59.560> this

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
of them will be very painful this

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:01.860 
of them will be very painful this
machine<00:04:00.950> needs<00:04:01.129> a<00:04:01.310> little<00:04:01.549> bit<00:04:01.640> of
