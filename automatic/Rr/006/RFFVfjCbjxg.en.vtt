00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390

to the right video so this is a prestige
glitch<00:00:27.420> and<00:00:28.109> I've<00:00:28.230> only<00:00:28.349> used<00:00:28.529> this<00:00:28.710> once

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
glitch and I've only used this once

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
it works on capture flag but it works on

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.130 
it works on capture flag but it works on
domination<00:02:53.220> and<00:02:53.310> demolition<00:02:53.910> for<00:02:54.090> sure<00:02:54.300> so

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
domination and demolition for sure so
