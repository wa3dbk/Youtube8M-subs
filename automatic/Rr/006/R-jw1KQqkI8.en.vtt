saying<00:02:42.680> well<00:02:42.890> how<00:02:43.069> would<00:02:43.129> these<00:02:43.400> characters

00:02:43.929 --> 00:02:43.939 
saying well how would these characters

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:46.539 
saying well how would these characters
move<00:02:44.209> they<00:02:44.900> definitely<00:02:45.290> have<00:02:45.920> this<00:02:46.189> sort<00:02:46.459> of

00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:46.549 
move they definitely have this sort of

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:49.569 
move they definitely have this sort of
locked<00:02:47.420> out<00:02:47.659> knee<00:02:47.989> position<00:02:48.230> and<00:02:48.769> they<00:02:49.430> would

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:49.579 
locked out knee position and they would

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:52.089 
locked out knee position and they would
throw<00:02:49.909> the<00:02:50.120> weight<00:02:50.629> forward<00:02:51.019> and<00:02:51.739> have<00:02:51.890> to

00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:52.099 
throw the weight forward and have to

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:54.910 
throw the weight forward and have to
push<00:02:52.370> from<00:02:52.609> your<00:02:52.849> shoulders<00:02:53.170> but<00:02:54.170> how<00:02:54.620> can<00:02:54.680> we

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
push from your shoulders but how can we

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.849 
push from your shoulders but how can we
get<00:02:55.269> ourselves<00:02:56.269> to<00:02:56.720> move<00:02:56.900> like<00:02:57.109> that<00:02:57.170> and<00:02:57.590> we

00:02:57.849 --> 00:02:57.859 
get ourselves to move like that and we

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:00.759 
get ourselves to move like that and we
came<00:02:58.099> up<00:02:58.159> with<00:02:58.489> this<00:02:58.579> idea<00:02:58.760> of<00:02:59.620> creating<00:03:00.620> these

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:00.769 
came up with this idea of creating these

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:03.940 
came up with this idea of creating these
types<00:03:01.099> of<00:03:01.219> stilts<00:03:01.760> and<00:03:02.349> that<00:03:03.349> allowed<00:03:03.680> us<00:03:03.709> to

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
types of stilts and that allowed us to

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.089 
types of stilts and that allowed us to
be<00:03:04.250> able<00:03:04.340> to<00:03:04.489> walk<00:03:04.670> around<00:03:05.560> very<00:03:06.560> much<00:03:06.620> like

00:03:07.089 --> 00:03:07.099 
be able to walk around very much like

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:21.490 
be able to walk around very much like
our<00:03:07.280> brother<00:03:07.519> Swift

crisis one you're on the journal and our

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.620 
crisis one you're on the journal and our
engine<00:03:24.620> was<00:03:24.800> very<00:03:25.280> tuned<00:03:25.940> to<00:03:26.270> actually<00:03:26.540> do

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
engine was very tuned to actually do

engine was very tuned to actually do
that<00:03:26.750> right<00:03:26.990> but<00:03:27.530> tries<00:03:27.710> to<00:03:27.890> is<00:03:27.980> much<00:03:28.130> more

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
that right but tries to is much more

we look closely at the techniques used

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:47.570 
we look closely at the techniques used
in<00:04:46.020> the<00:04:46.140> film<00:04:46.320> world<00:04:46.620> we<00:04:47.250> can<00:04:47.430> actually

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
in the film world we can actually

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.060 
in the film world we can actually
seriously<00:04:48.540> control<00:04:49.050> the<00:04:49.290> color<00:04:49.470> space<00:04:49.800> in<00:04:50.010> a

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.070 
seriously control the color space in a

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:52.880 
seriously control the color space in a
very<00:04:50.340> very<00:04:50.640> specific<00:04:51.360> way<00:04:51.600> hidden<00:04:52.560> certain

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:52.890 
very very specific way hidden certain

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:54.830 
very very specific way hidden certain
parts<00:04:53.250> of<00:04:53.340> the<00:04:53.400> color<00:04:53.640> space<00:04:53.970> down<00:04:54.270> and<00:04:54.570> shift

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 
parts of the color space down and shift

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.690 
parts of the color space down and shift
other<00:04:55.080> ones<00:04:55.320> around<00:04:55.470> we<00:04:56.040> can<00:04:56.220> have<00:04:56.340> triggers

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:56.700 
other ones around we can have triggers

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:58.730 
other ones around we can have triggers
that<00:04:56.790> have<00:04:57.180> indoor<00:04:57.840> lighting<00:04:58.080> and<00:04:58.440> then<00:04:58.590> go

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740 
that have indoor lighting and then go

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.140 
that have indoor lighting and then go
outside<00:04:59.130> and<00:04:59.490> we<00:04:59.580> can<00:04:59.610> change<00:04:59.910> the

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
outside and we can change the

enough to do on consoles right but then
from<00:05:36.450> there<00:05:36.660> I<00:05:36.690> mean<00:05:37.020> we<00:05:37.350> want<00:05:37.530> the<00:05:37.620> PC<00:05:37.980> to<00:05:38.160> look

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:38.310 
from there I mean we want the PC to look

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:43.320 
from there I mean we want the PC to look
even<00:05:38.580> better

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:43.330 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:46.679 

hey<00:05:44.310> when<00:05:45.310> the<00:05:45.340> ceilings<00:05:45.849> here<00:05:46.060> and<00:05:46.240> we<00:05:46.659> are

00:05:46.679 --> 00:05:46.689 
hey when the ceilings here and we are

00:05:46.689 --> 00:05:48.689 
hey when the ceilings here and we are
constantly<00:05:47.050> like<00:05:47.379> emailing<00:05:47.860> nailing<00:05:48.580> the

00:05:48.689 --> 00:05:48.699 
constantly like emailing nailing the

00:05:48.699 --> 00:05:50.309 
constantly like emailing nailing the
ceiling<00:05:49.090> of<00:05:49.180> what<00:05:49.389> we<00:05:49.509> can<00:05:49.659> hold<00:05:49.870> we're

00:05:50.309 --> 00:05:50.319 
ceiling of what we can hold we're

00:05:50.319 --> 00:05:52.140 
ceiling of what we can hold we're
squeezing<00:05:50.560> in<00:05:50.800> as<00:05:50.949> much<00:05:51.189> as<00:05:51.370> we<00:05:51.490> possibly<00:05:51.520> can

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:52.150 
squeezing in as much as we possibly can

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:55.050 
squeezing in as much as we possibly can
and<00:05:52.409> on<00:05:53.409> PC<00:05:54.039> you<00:05:54.159> just<00:05:54.280> have<00:05:54.400> a<00:05:54.430> higher<00:05:54.610> ceiling

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:55.060 
and on PC you just have a higher ceiling

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:56.909 
and on PC you just have a higher ceiling
so<00:05:55.330> you<00:05:55.389> can<00:05:55.599> squeeze<00:05:55.810> in<00:05:56.020> more<00:05:56.169> stuff<00:05:56.469> the

00:05:56.909 --> 00:05:56.919 
so you can squeeze in more stuff the

00:05:56.919 --> 00:05:59.730 
so you can squeeze in more stuff the
experience<00:05:57.520> I<00:05:57.639> think<00:05:57.669> will<00:05:58.360> basically<00:05:59.349> be<00:05:59.530> the

00:05:59.730 --> 00:05:59.740 
experience I think will basically be the

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:01.140 
experience I think will basically be the
same<00:05:59.949> on<00:05:59.979> every<00:06:00.189> platform<00:06:00.460> and<00:06:00.849> that's<00:06:00.969> what

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:01.150 
same on every platform and that's what

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:13.520 
same on every platform and that's what
we're<00:06:01.270> shooting<00:06:01.419> for

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:13.530
