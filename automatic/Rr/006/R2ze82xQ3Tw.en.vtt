and here's what it looks like I have
here<00:00:11.910> two<00:00:12.180> piles<00:00:12.420> of<00:00:12.630> cards

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
here two piles of cards

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.320 
here two piles of cards
the<00:00:14.010> first<00:00:14.220> one<00:00:14.400> is<00:00:14.550> the<00:00:15.030> sleight-of-hand

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
the first one is the sleight-of-hand

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.570 
the first one is the sleight-of-hand
pile<00:00:15.840> and<00:00:16.109> the<00:00:16.320> second<00:00:16.650> one<00:00:16.769> is<00:00:17.010> mentalism

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
pile and the second one is mentalism

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.900 
pile and the second one is mentalism
pile<00:00:18.500> actually<00:00:19.500> mentalism<00:00:20.039> is<00:00:20.339> more<00:00:20.669> about

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
pile actually mentalism is more about

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.700 
pile actually mentalism is more about
making<00:00:21.210> prediction<00:00:21.900> and<00:00:22.079> things<00:00:22.289> like<00:00:22.439> that
