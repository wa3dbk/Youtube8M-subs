00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.820 
hi guys ok so today I'm going to answer
a<00:00:04.529> few<00:00:04.920> questions<00:00:05.240> that<00:00:07.580> were<00:00:08.580> asked<00:00:08.910> of<00:00:09.000> me

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:09.830 
a few questions that were asked of me

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:13.400 
a few questions that were asked of me
about<00:00:10.830> my<00:00:11.010> invisalign<00:00:11.670> braces<00:00:11.700> and<00:00:12.360> before<00:00:13.349> I

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
about my invisalign braces and before I

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.880 
about my invisalign braces and before I
do<00:00:13.530> that<00:00:13.740> though<00:00:14.190> I<00:00:14.549> want<00:00:14.849> to<00:00:14.990> say<00:00:15.990> one<00:00:16.830> thing

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
do that though I want to say one thing

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.370 
do that though I want to say one thing
about<00:00:18.140> the<00:00:19.140> numbers<00:00:19.949> ok<00:00:20.670> so<00:00:21.060> it<00:00:21.990> was<00:00:22.109> pointed

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
about the numbers ok so it was pointed

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.290 
about the numbers ok so it was pointed
out<00:00:22.500> to<00:00:22.560> me<00:00:22.740> that<00:00:24.980> these<00:00:25.980> are<00:00:26.460> numbered

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
out to me that these are numbered

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.389 
out to me that these are numbered
actually<00:00:27.960> I<00:00:28.769> just<00:00:29.730> was<00:00:30.269> expecting<00:00:31.080> it's<00:00:32.070> be

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
actually I just was expecting it's be

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.850 
actually I just was expecting it's be
more<00:00:32.850> obvious<00:00:33.030> but<00:00:33.809> it's<00:00:34.410> not<00:00:34.620> as<00:00:34.739> obvious

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
more obvious but it's not as obvious

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.150 
more obvious but it's not as obvious
okay<00:00:35.160> so<00:00:35.340> there's<00:00:35.700> like<00:00:35.880> an<00:00:36.030> individual

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:37.160 
okay so there's like an individual

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.130 
okay so there's like an individual
number<00:00:38.160> I<00:00:38.460> guess<00:00:38.640> for<00:00:38.850> your<00:00:39.420> particular<00:00:39.660> set

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
number I guess for your particular set

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.569 
number I guess for your particular set
of<00:00:40.170> aligners<00:00:40.559> right<00:00:40.890> so<00:00:41.040> every<00:00:41.340> set<00:00:41.550> of

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
of aligners right so every set of

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.470 
of aligners right so every set of
aligners<00:00:41.910> has<00:00:42.270> a<00:00:42.300> number<00:00:42.660> and<00:00:44.149> so<00:00:45.149> that's<00:00:45.360> that

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
aligners has a number and so that's that

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.529 
aligners has a number and so that's that
on<00:00:45.960> one<00:00:46.320> side<00:00:46.530> I<00:00:47.489> mean<00:00:47.969> you<00:00:48.030> can't<00:00:48.270> see<00:00:48.420> it<00:00:48.510> but

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
on one side I mean you can't see it but

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.750 
on one side I mean you can't see it but
there's<00:00:48.899> there's<00:00:49.620> that<00:00:49.860> number<00:00:50.309> if<00:00:50.489> there's<00:00:50.700> a

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
there's there's that number if there's a

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.930 
there's there's that number if there's a
longer<00:00:51.239> it's<00:00:51.449> like<00:00:51.660> six<00:00:52.649> digits<00:00:53.070> and<00:00:53.699> then

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
longer it's like six digits and then

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.380 
longer it's like six digits and then
right<00:00:54.210> under<00:00:54.600> that<00:00:54.629> there's<00:00:55.620> an<00:00:55.800> L<00:00:56.329> ok<00:00:57.329> so

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
right under that there's an L ok so

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.990 
right under that there's an L ok so
these<00:00:57.719> are<00:00:57.899> my<00:00:57.930> lowers<00:00:58.410> so<00:00:58.770> L<00:00:59.039> for<00:00:59.460> lower<00:00:59.640> and

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
these are my lowers so L for lower and

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.210 
these are my lowers so L for lower and
then<00:01:00.600> there's<00:01:00.930> an<00:01:01.109> 02<00:01:02.780> ok<00:01:03.780> so<00:01:03.860> if<00:01:04.860> I<00:01:04.979> have<00:01:05.100> been

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
then there's an 02 ok so if I have been

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.520 
then there's an 02 ok so if I have been
paying<00:01:05.430> attention<00:01:05.549> I<00:01:06.390> would<00:01:07.020> have<00:01:07.140> seen<00:01:07.380> that

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
paying attention I would have seen that

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.120 
paying attention I would have seen that
it<00:01:07.680> said<00:01:07.920> 02<00:01:08.280> I<00:01:08.610> mean<00:01:08.939> because<00:01:09.740> they<00:01:10.740> look

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
it said 02 I mean because they look

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.800 
it said 02 I mean because they look
different<00:01:11.549> I<00:01:11.939> can<00:01:12.090> tell<00:01:12.299> which<00:01:12.450> one<00:01:12.600> is<00:01:12.720> the

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
different I can tell which one is the

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.390 
different I can tell which one is the
upper<00:01:13.140> room<00:01:13.260> which<00:01:13.439> one<00:01:13.590> is<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.830> lower<00:01:14.040> right

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
upper room which one is the lower right

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.160 
upper room which one is the lower right
so<00:01:14.700> I<00:01:15.000> mean<00:01:15.270> I<00:01:15.330> guess<00:01:15.360> they<00:01:15.570> don't<00:01:15.659> need<00:01:15.990> to

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
so I mean I guess they don't need to

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.810 
so I mean I guess they don't need to
write<00:01:16.320> that<00:01:16.500> on<00:01:16.619> there<00:01:16.650> for<00:01:16.950> me<00:01:17.009> but<00:01:17.430> maybe<00:01:17.729> for

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
write that on there for me but maybe for

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.300 
write that on there for me but maybe for
others<00:01:18.240> it<00:01:18.540> may<00:01:19.170> not<00:01:19.320> be<00:01:19.380> as<00:01:19.590> obvious<00:01:19.740> alright

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
others it may not be as obvious alright

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.060 
others it may not be as obvious alright
and<00:01:20.340> then<00:01:20.580> on<00:01:20.700> top<00:01:20.880> of<00:01:20.939> that<00:01:21.740> there's<00:01:22.740> like<00:01:22.950> an

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
and then on top of that there's like an

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.539 
and then on top of that there's like an
0<00:01:23.250> to<00:01:23.400> n<00:01:24.200> which<00:01:25.200> just<00:01:25.470> looks<00:01:25.619> like<00:01:25.770> an<00:01:25.979> odd<00:01:26.189> it

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
0 to n which just looks like an odd it

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.130 
0 to n which just looks like an odd it
just<00:01:26.759> looks<00:01:26.970> like<00:01:27.030> a<00:01:27.119> random<00:01:27.540> number<00:01:27.750> I<00:01:27.900> wasn't

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
just looks like a random number I wasn't

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.429 
just looks like a random number I wasn't
even<00:01:28.259> looking<00:01:28.380> at<00:01:28.619> that<00:01:28.770> side<00:01:28.950> I'm<00:01:29.520> looking<00:01:29.850> at

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:30.439 
even looking at that side I'm looking at

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:33.370 
even looking at that side I'm looking at
the<00:01:31.439> other<00:01:31.590> side<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.340> other<00:01:32.369> side<00:01:32.670> says

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
the other side the other side says

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.499 
the other side the other side says
Invisalign<00:01:34.380> on<00:01:34.560> it<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:35.060> then<00:01:36.060> there's<00:01:36.210> on<00:01:36.329> one

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
Invisalign on it and then there's on one

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.300 
Invisalign on it and then there's on one
underneath<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:37.140> all<00:01:37.350> of<00:01:37.500> them<00:01:37.619> have<00:01:37.650> that<00:01:37.860> all

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
underneath and all of them have that all

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.660 
underneath and all of them have that all
of<00:01:38.670> them<00:01:38.759> happened<00:01:39.090> design<00:01:39.390> one<00:01:40.400> so<00:01:41.400> that<00:01:41.549> was

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
of them happened design one so that was

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:42.710 
of them happened design one so that was
just<00:01:41.700> pointing<00:01:42.000> out<00:01:42.180> to<00:01:42.240> me<00:01:42.360> it's<00:01:42.540> like<00:01:42.600> I

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
just pointing out to me it's like I

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.039 
just pointing out to me it's like I
guess<00:01:43.020> I<00:01:43.140> just<00:01:43.170> have<00:01:43.439> to<00:01:43.560> look<00:01:43.740> really<00:01:44.040> hard<00:01:45.049> to

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
guess I just have to look really hard to

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.840 
guess I just have to look really hard to
find<00:01:46.290> out<00:01:46.500> what<00:01:47.130> I<00:01:47.159> mean<00:01:47.369> I<00:01:47.430> guess<00:01:47.460> i'll<00:01:47.759> have

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
find out what I mean I guess i'll have

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.249 
find out what I mean I guess i'll have
to<00:01:47.909> look<00:01:48.090> really<00:01:48.329> hard<00:01:48.659> now<00:01:48.990> that<00:01:49.110> I<00:01:49.200> know

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
to look really hard now that I know

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.010 
to look really hard now that I know
where<00:01:49.500> to<00:01:49.560> look<00:01:49.860> but<00:01:50.220> I<00:01:50.360> didn't<00:01:51.360> know<00:01:51.780> where<00:01:51.990> to

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
where to look but I didn't know where to

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.940 
where to look but I didn't know where to
look<00:01:52.200> before

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
look before

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.340 
look before
I've<00:01:53.219> looked<00:01:53.939> I<00:01:54.270> can<00:01:54.750> see<00:01:54.960> that<00:01:55.140> they<00:01:55.320> are

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
I've looked I can see that they are

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:01.179 
I've looked I can see that they are
numbered<00:01:55.860> 1<00:01:56.189> 2<00:01:56.579> 3<00:01:56.850> so<00:01:57.299> yeah<00:01:58.490> that's<00:01:59.490> one<00:02:00.119> thing

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:01.189 
numbered 1 2 3 so yeah that's one thing

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:05.779 
numbered 1 2 3 so yeah that's one thing
so<00:02:02.189> yeah<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:03.060> questions<00:02:03.539> that<00:02:04.320> were<00:02:05.280> asked<00:02:05.700> of

00:02:05.779 --> 00:02:05.789 
so yeah the questions that were asked of

foreseeing<00:04:12.740> any<00:04:12.890> problems<00:04:13.310> with<00:04:13.460> that<00:04:13.490> and

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 
foreseeing any problems with that and

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:15.790 
foreseeing any problems with that and
and<00:04:14.330> my<00:04:14.630> orthodontist<00:04:15.230> didn't<00:04:15.530> think<00:04:15.680> to

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:15.800 
and my orthodontist didn't think to

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:16.930 
and my orthodontist didn't think to
think<00:04:15.980> of<00:04:16.070> that<00:04:16.160> was<00:04:16.280> a<00:04:16.340> big<00:04:16.519> deal<00:04:16.880> or

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
think of that was a big deal or

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.410 
think of that was a big deal or
something<00:04:17.390> that<00:04:17.510> happened<00:04:17.870> often<00:04:18.230> either

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:19.420 
something that happened often either

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:23.350 
something that happened often either
obviously<00:04:20.420> if<00:04:20.510> I<00:04:20.600> lose<00:04:20.930> them<00:04:21.550> I<00:04:22.550> would<00:04:23.120> have<00:04:23.240> to

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
obviously if I lose them I would have to

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.480 
obviously if I lose them I would have to
buy<00:04:23.510> another<00:04:23.750> sad<00:04:24.230> too<00:04:24.500> so<00:04:24.830> I<00:04:24.860> have<00:04:25.160> to<00:04:25.280> be<00:04:25.400> very

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490 
buy another sad too so I have to be very

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:31.060 
buy another sad too so I have to be very
careful<00:04:25.790> and<00:04:26.420> not<00:04:26.780> lose<00:04:27.050> them<00:04:27.940> so<00:04:28.940> yeah<00:04:30.070> that's

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.070 
careful and not lose them so yeah that's

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:38.200 
careful and not lose them so yeah that's
it<00:04:33.190> if<00:04:34.780> you<00:04:35.780> know<00:04:35.900> I<00:04:35.930> man<00:04:36.530> i'm<00:04:36.740> in<00:04:37.370> my<00:04:37.850> first

week of the second set of liner so it's

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:43.690 
week of the second set of liner so it's
not<00:04:41.210> too<00:04:41.570> bad<00:04:41.980> they<00:04:42.980> didn't<00:04:43.280> they<00:04:43.400> really

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:43.700

didn't actually hurt as much as the

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.159

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.060 
painted go away after about a half an

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.300 
painted go away after about a half an
hour<00:04:50.180> and<00:04:50.570> I<00:04:51.350> don't<00:04:51.650> have<00:04:51.770> them<00:04:51.950> on<00:04:52.070> now

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:52.310 
hour and I don't have them on now

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:54.250 
hour and I don't have them on now
obviously<00:04:52.790> but<00:04:53.090> you<00:04:53.660> know<00:04:53.780> what<00:04:53.930> I<00:04:53.960> put<00:04:54.140> them

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:54.260 
obviously but you know what I put them

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.260 
obviously but you know what I put them
back<00:04:54.410> in<00:04:54.620> they<00:04:54.950> are<00:04:55.010> they<00:04:55.370> do<00:04:55.430> feel<00:04:55.820> pretty

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.270 
back in they are they do feel pretty

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.270 
back in they are they do feel pretty
tight<00:04:56.570> but<00:04:56.600> it's<00:04:56.780> not<00:04:57.020> uncomfortable<00:04:57.620> like

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:58.280 
tight but it's not uncomfortable like

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.310 
tight but it's not uncomfortable like
that<00:04:58.550> first<00:04:58.880> one<00:04:59.120> I<00:04:59.150> mean<00:04:59.390> it<00:04:59.510> was<00:04:59.660> like<00:04:59.870> the

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.320 
that first one I mean it was like the

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:03.490 
that first one I mean it was like the
first<00:05:00.500> set<00:05:01.100> was<00:05:01.250> just<00:05:01.660> unbelievable<00:05:02.660> but<00:05:03.169> this

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:03.500 
first set was just unbelievable but this

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.010 
first set was just unbelievable but this
set<00:05:03.830> is<00:05:04.100> is<00:05:04.400> not<00:05:04.880> it's<00:05:05.120> not<00:05:05.300> hurting<00:05:05.570> so<00:05:05.840> bad

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.020 
set is is not it's not hurting so bad

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:07.630 
set is is not it's not hurting so bad
probably<00:05:06.440> because<00:05:06.770> my<00:05:07.010> teeth<00:05:07.190> are<00:05:07.280> just<00:05:07.490> like

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:07.640 
probably because my teeth are just like

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.940 
probably because my teeth are just like
already<00:05:08.060> moving<00:05:08.780> I<00:05:08.930> mean<00:05:09.080> date<00:05:09.380> and<00:05:09.590> they<00:05:09.710> hurt

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:09.950 
already moving I mean date and they hurt

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:13.510 
already moving I mean date and they hurt
like<00:05:10.130> down<00:05:10.550> here<00:05:10.930> they're<00:05:11.930> kind<00:05:12.470> of<00:05:12.620> tender

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:13.520 
like down here they're kind of tender

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.710 
like down here they're kind of tender
they're<00:05:14.000> sore<00:05:15.430> they<00:05:16.430> don't<00:05:16.640> you<00:05:17.120> know<00:05:17.240> feel

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:17.720 
they're sore they don't you know feel

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:22.090 
they're sore they don't you know feel
great<00:05:18.710> so<00:05:19.280> I<00:05:20.050> suppose<00:05:21.050> when<00:05:21.200> they<00:05:21.350> stop<00:05:21.740> moving

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:22.100 
great so I suppose when they stop moving

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:23.710 
great so I suppose when they stop moving
completely<00:05:22.790> and<00:05:22.940> I'm<00:05:23.030> just<00:05:23.240> using<00:05:23.479> it

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:23.720 
completely and I'm just using it

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.540 
completely and I'm just using it
retainer<00:05:24.110> which<00:05:24.440> I<00:05:24.680> probably<00:05:24.979> will<00:05:25.280> have<00:05:25.400> to

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:25.550 
retainer which I probably will have to

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:27.820 
retainer which I probably will have to
wear<00:05:25.700> a<00:05:25.729> retainer<00:05:25.910> from<00:05:26.330> my<00:05:26.510> bottom<00:05:26.900> teeth<00:05:26.930> for

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:27.830 
wear a retainer from my bottom teeth for

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:29.830 
wear a retainer from my bottom teeth for
a<00:05:27.860> while<00:05:28.130> a<00:05:28.520> long<00:05:28.550> while<00:05:28.970> and<00:05:29.419> I<00:05:29.510> mean<00:05:29.690> like

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:29.840 
a while a long while and I mean like

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:31.930 
a while a long while and I mean like
probably<00:05:30.590> more<00:05:30.770> than<00:05:30.890> a<00:05:30.950> year<00:05:30.979> I<00:05:31.130> don't<00:05:31.850> know<00:05:31.910> I

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:31.940 
probably more than a year I don't know I

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:33.340 
probably more than a year I don't know I
haven't<00:05:32.210> really<00:05:32.390> gotten<00:05:32.630> into<00:05:32.780> that<00:05:32.930> was<00:05:33.200> my

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:33.350 
haven't really gotten into that was my

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:35.980 
haven't really gotten into that was my
orthodontist<00:05:34.040> yet<00:05:34.250> but<00:05:34.490> he<00:05:35.450> says<00:05:35.720> that<00:05:35.750> I'm

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:35.990 
orthodontist yet but he says that I'm

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:37.719 
orthodontist yet but he says that I'm
definitely<00:05:36.229> doesn't<00:05:36.650> need<00:05:36.860> a<00:05:36.890> retainer<00:05:37.130> for

00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:37.729 
definitely doesn't need a retainer for

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:39.520 
definitely doesn't need a retainer for
the<00:05:37.850> bottom<00:05:38.150> teeth<00:05:38.360> because<00:05:38.780> they<00:05:39.020> probably

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:39.530 
the bottom teeth because they probably

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:43.270 
the bottom teeth because they probably
will<00:05:39.950> shift<00:05:40.190> again<00:05:40.580> if<00:05:40.760> I<00:05:40.910> don't<00:05:41.510> so<00:05:41.960> yeah<00:05:42.890> so

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:43.280 
will shift again if I don't so yeah so

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.030 
will shift again if I don't so yeah so
five<00:05:43.640> thousand<00:05:44.060> dollars<00:05:44.360> and<00:05:44.780> I<00:05:44.960> have<00:05:45.200> like<00:05:45.530> I

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:46.040 
five thousand dollars and I have like I

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:48.880 
five thousand dollars and I have like I

payment plans they pay about a 1 15 a
month<00:05:53.110> I<00:05:54.490> probably<00:05:55.490> won't<00:05:55.880> you<00:05:56.540> know<00:05:56.660> continue

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:57.110 
month I probably won't you know continue

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:59.050 
month I probably won't you know continue
to<00:05:57.140> pay<00:05:57.350> 115<00:05:57.979> a<00:05:58.010> month<00:05:58.310> because<00:05:58.640> I<00:05:58.700> will<00:05:58.910> just

00:05:59.050 --> 00:05:59.060 
to pay 115 a month because I will just

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:01.290 
to pay 115 a month because I will just
drag<00:05:59.270> it<00:05:59.330> on<00:05:59.540> forever<00:05:59.930> and

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:01.300 
drag it on forever and

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.800 
drag it on forever and
you<00:06:01.780> know<00:06:01.900> interest<00:06:02.620> rates<00:06:02.770> are<00:06:03.039> high<00:06:03.250> so<00:06:03.909> yeah

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:04.810 
you know interest rates are high so yeah

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:08.760 
you know interest rates are high so yeah
it's<00:06:05.169> not<00:06:05.319> cheap<00:06:06.509> for<00:06:07.509> me<00:06:07.629> I<00:06:07.870> think<00:06:08.319> that<00:06:08.379> I<00:06:08.500> if

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:08.770 
it's not cheap for me I think that I if

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:10.290
