00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.030
 we play the games I Bandarban 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:16.180
 I'm here with you for a good video 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:18.759
 Special because I bring you the team. 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:21.550
 need to give powers premier league and 

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:22.420
 league and the league website even if 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.420
 disclosed it 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:28.000
 but it only shows 11 team players 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:30.580
 which will be launched in the last tim will 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.430
 also have the bank and reservations 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:34.870
 and there is only inspired by this list released 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.879
 by the English League website 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:39.670
 then it is almost certain that most will 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:42.040
 appear more have chances of one or two 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.930
 do not stay on the team that is going to be in 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.250
 fifa before starting that was 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.289
 quickly on a new series that 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.360
 we are starting on the channel that is to 

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:52.180
 beating dortmund is more the same style 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.579
 messi's friends speak and the way 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.530
 then take a look at that 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:58.870
 and how it can always destroy 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:01.390
 links does not take a second and help 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:04.059
 too much in the disclosure of video beauty 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:06.450
 let's go out to the first player who is 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:10.060
 t rex welcome what is really 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:13.240
 very very insane, I just wanted to warn you 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:15.550
 that the not so exact levels available 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.599
 They were obviously not disclosed but 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:21.610
 can expect more or less what 

00:01:18.599 --> 00:01:25.149
 comparing with the other years they give 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:28.240
 more or less 5 up to 10 more levels 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:31.060
 for each attribute to imagine with this 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.310
 our letter should not enter as the 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.739
 abnormal is already very very good for 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:38.080
 imagine this Greek letter and also 

00:01:35.739 --> 00:01:40.330
 to the junior who does all this 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.099
 design is can send an email to him 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.229
 that he commands too much is that you can 

00:01:42.099 --> 00:01:46.660
 see it easily for a price as well 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:49.450
 cool now let's go to the sides 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:53.349
 same thing we have petraglia and evaldo 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:55.599
 20 is do not know if 20 go really mind going 

00:01:53.349 --> 00:01:57.970
 win and was very good offensively but 

00:01:55.599 --> 00:01:59.319
 defensively apparently he was not 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.920
 that's good 

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:05.860
 according to my friend daniel who is 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:08.679
 Chelsea supporter also vote for the link 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:11.230
 it on twitter on the buttock inscription that 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.670
 It was always a good day, it's good. 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.490
 Brazilian football reviews 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.890
 international and obertan I think it will 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:20.350
 be a silver letter even 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.480
 that usually when the guy is already 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:25.240
 silver and elegant in the decision he did not 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.100
 Turn to gold only if he's already hungry 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:29.290
 before but humberto did not win anything 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.360
 so I think it's going to get silver 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.020
 even though neither lucas was already in the year 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.209
 past 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:37.270
 now we are going to the series double behind and 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:39.760
 I also do not agree very much with what 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:42.370
 I will see the final team but not me 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:45.040
 think koscielny example sources there 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:47.530
 deserved more and we have dr 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.720
 very deserved and for now these levels 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.489
 I think they will get very good 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:55.209
 or last year now we go to the 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:57.940
 half-field mate deservedly continuous 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:00.760
 one does not know very well if he will be in the 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:03.910
 final team there that will appear in fifa 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:06.430
 he played well but I think my 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:09.010
 friends there liverpool fan for vain 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.660
 agree that a decision may be that 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.120
 Be a little heavy he played well. 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:15.580
 but the season was not exceptional 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.370
 whole now let's go out to both 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:21.340
 from the middle field that this sim 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:23.980
 played and played many looks 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.239
 expensive levels that will get very much 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.700
 many years 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:29.440
 now that I have realized that the saints are 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:32.799
 with lower levels than chance, which 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:36.760
 I think it 's hard to do but we're going. 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:38.980
 to give these levels there as an example let's 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.680
 to see what the fuck is going to have to be 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:44.320
 very young and old, said 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:47.140
 Now let's get the two trucks out. 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:49.299
 the front is also deservedly 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:52.450
 I'm sure I'll be in the final team that goes 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:54.070
 appear on fifa which is the ranking and 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:57.130
 diego costa 

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:59.320
 Look at these levels, man, fuck them. 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:02.709
 They played from over and over I 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:05.590
 I also think it is very likely that I will 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:08.410
 that it also appears to us that the 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:11.650
 made many goals were certainly 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:14.140
 very important for the team of each one 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:16.060
 so I think it's very likely that 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:18.940
 these two look better on the 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:22.180
 front is sensational also if cards 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:23.890
 absurdly good but it 's good to have this good 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:26.320
 loving then I find it difficult that I 

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:28.539
 I'll be able to test you. 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.820
 asking when is everyone going to show? 

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:31.540
 the times of the season but what to say and 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.120
 made a 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:34.750
 explained perfectly about all the 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.250
 dates 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:39.130
 So it's no use talking about it. 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:41.500
 it indicates in the description that the portal 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:44.320
 link from his video that you will see 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:46.900
 perfectly all the dates all 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.790
 leagues that will appear and honestly I 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:51.160
 I agree with their role, I think well. 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:52.900
 likely to happen then give your 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:55.630
 opinion there who you think will 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:58.660
 appear in this team needs to doors 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:01.330
 repeating this it was given by the 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:03.400
 and will be inspired by this 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:04.810
 list we do not know if she will use all 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.560
 the players you will leave some of 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:09.190
 out 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:11.470
 We'll see there in the second week of the team. 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:13.420
 need to take that you like it again 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:16.890
 left and that helped a lot and I see 

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:16.890
 you next time
