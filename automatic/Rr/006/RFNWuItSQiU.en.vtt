00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:05.190
 the sewer plates are covers 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.350
 metal that covers the ego on the 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.360
 pavements workers raise them 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.250
 to access the egos and others 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.620
 underground amenities in order to 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.240
 repair the foundries make these 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.010
 plates with high cast iron 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.140
 resistance for it to last 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.010
 decades and does not move under the 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.010
 traffic pressure 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.060
 this company makes hundreds 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.009
 of plate models and paste 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.640
 crush the rings on which rest 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.920
 the plaques 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.200
 we use iron alloy type 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.360
 melted ductile iron treated with 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.280
 magnesium to strengthen it or the 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:47.489
 gray cast iron heavier but just as 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:49.079
 robust to make a plate 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.629
 the workers must first create a 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.649
 mold this one moulherat the top of the 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.110
 plate 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.820
 workers are paid about 300 kg 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.449
 sand mixed with glue and a 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.449
 hardener 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.379
 for the underside of the plate 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.650
 he repeats this step with another 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:07.650
 mold 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.090
 a worker creating an opening in the 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.820
 sand that will allow to pour the metal 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:23.900
 fade it closes the hole with a block of 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:25.910
 wood in order to preserve the quality then 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.160
 remove it a deer again briefly 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:32.510
 the pipe to make sure the sand does not 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:34.070
 did not sag it takes about 15 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:41.510
 minutes for that sand mix 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:42.320
 harden a machine then returns 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.940
 each box 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.940
 alas blow for the mold to fall 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.700
 to make a manhole cover 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.190
 workers will join the mussels 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.720
 upper and lower sections of 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.430
 alignment protrusions and glue 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.710
 between the sections allow for good 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:05.880
 align them and form seals that 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:07.920
 prevents the molten metal from flowing 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.649
 machine then returns the mold of the 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.170
 lower section positions the mold 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:16.220
 of the upper section below and then 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.220
 in Paris the two 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.090
 factory buys scrap from sites 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.020
 demolition and also recycles its 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.580
 waste 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.190
 these metals are melted with some 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.530
 minerals to improve the mixture of 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.930
 graphite to make it malleable from 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.940
 silicone to make it robust and 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.480
 magnesium to make them light but 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.480
 robust 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:43.300
 here a and ate a picks up the pieces 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:45.819
 of iron and steel recycled metal and 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:48.880
 preheated to 4 120 degrees celsius then 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:50.890
 transferred an oven into this one it takes 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.500
 about half an hour to melt 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:56.190
 enough metal to make 35 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.190
 manhole covers 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.480
 workers transfer molten metal 

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:07.610
 in a cauldron and add silicone 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.530
 this operation standardizes 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:15.590
 consistency of the mixture that will be so 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:17.840
 easier to pour next to 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.730
 the opening to pour the metal over 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:26.689
 big molds have wind holes for 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:28.340
 evacuate the hot gases it takes about 

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:31.129
 an hour and a half for the metal 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:33.260
 harden a conveyor then pours 

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:38.750
 the mussels in a container he stands 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:40.940
 shatters when falling with the help of a 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:43.120
 hook the workers picks up the products 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.120
 molded 

00:03:46.219 --> 00:03:50.400
 they were up the excess sand and 

00:03:48.719 --> 00:03:53.129
 metal that formed during the 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:04:00.750
 molding these residues will be recycled for 

00:03:53.129 --> 00:04:02.970
 a new batch of slots the plates 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.439
 sewerage in various dimensions according to the 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.450
 order specifications 

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:08.760
 most have about the diameter 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:12.890
 of a car tire the average weight 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.890
 is about 63 kg 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:18.209
 a worker pons the edges of the college 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:20.699
 then the perimeter of the plate 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:28.860
 so the plate will be embedded in the 

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:30.630
 college this machine is testing the 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.610
 resistance of the plate by applying 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:38.039
 the pressure she has to bear the weight 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:39.509
 of a car every 2 cm and night 

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:41.430
 workers paint the plates and 

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:44.280
 stick by plunging them into a bath of 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:46.050
 black bray once dried plates have 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.449
 not finished resistant to rust that lasts 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:50.610
 dozens of years buyers there 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:54.289
 because each plate and his colleague 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:54.289
 costs up to 1400 dollars
