like<00:01:41.689> this<00:01:41.869> just<00:01:42.350> remove<00:01:42.680> that<00:01:42.710> and<00:01:43.130> then<00:01:43.850> I

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
like this just remove that and then I

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.240 
like this just remove that and then I
excellent<00:01:44.420> went<00:01:44.570> into<00:01:44.840> maps<00:01:45.140> but<00:01:45.439> um<00:01:45.829> go<00:01:46.100> back

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:47.649 
excellent went into maps but um go back
into<00:01:46.430> block<00:01:46.790> launches<00:01:47.090> so<00:01:47.210> you<00:01:47.299> just<00:01:47.420> have<00:01:47.570> to

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
into block launches so you just have to

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:50.080

close<00:01:47.899> it<00:01:48.079> and<00:01:48.170> then<00:01:48.829> reopen<00:01:49.430> it<00:01:49.549> and<00:01:49.670> then<00:01:49.969> it

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
close it and then reopen it and then it

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.050 
close it and then reopen it and then it
should<00:01:50.270> work<00:01:50.450> so<00:01:50.780> now<00:01:51.079> if<00:01:52.039> we<00:01:52.100> go<00:01:52.549> into<00:01:52.850> our
