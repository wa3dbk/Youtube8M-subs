 warm things that can recover 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:22.550

 I've already had the table chair 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:46.150
 I'm not completely in any case 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:47.700
 very tasty made a huge impact on 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:50.320
 the other side I can do that 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.200
 others say that they are like that 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.480
 on 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.510
 but I'm friendly 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:57.010
 at the store for my bread stolen so that 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:58.870
 It was the first of the eco me us 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:02.200
 by the way my girlfriend has that 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:04.870
 cappuccino with harp me and me one 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:10.330
 latte macchiato with so janisch 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:12.430
 they are delicious too i hope you can 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:16.450
 can hear me now so looks from the outside 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.890
 from very comfortable inside but inside 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.240
 you can probably sit outside 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.030
 that is to say , in any case 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.800
 table and chairs and here it is 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.660
 street under the can also everywhere 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.610
 parking at mmos is free in cologne 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:31.530
 probably the case is rare 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.530
 But there is no public parking 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:39.409
 if you are lucky enough to the reservists 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:42.109
 top for brunch is even with speed 

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:45.140
 made brunch that costs 10 euro 90 

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:46.670
 and I think it's about an hour 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.620
 The normal plan can be just as long 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:51.680
 stay as you like but still get one 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.680
 glass of juice and I think that costs 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.700
 15 euro 90 I will not be mistaken 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.530
 but everything is also on the homepage 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.079
 that is a very good homepage of the 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.120
 clear and has all the information 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:03.560
 which one needs so here was very nice 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.079
 and here I will definitely be at 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.480

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:09.620

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.870
 Keep up to date 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.439
 I was in here right now in the lasso 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.439
 Cologne 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:21.430
 and he is so full of madness I am 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.950
 Actually, not really a fan of it 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:26.430
 I've been there many times 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:30.160
 seen synonymous with instagram and so on 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:31.870
 important that natural cosmetics is and that 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.700
 is not always because ash now 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.680
 so given 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.650
 that's all bios that is now 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.490
 natural cosmetics but I just everything bio 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.990
 That's why I still had it 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:43.060
 not done but it's just like that 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:48.280
 experience shopping heat degree is imminent 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:50.290
 Just wanted to show christmas 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.660

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:05.970

 there 's a mixer and in the set me 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:15.060

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:15.060
 keep ready 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.160

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.660
 Show you that from further away that 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:37.290
 my boss was a little info 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:37.290
 orange 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:42.560
 that's how it looks from the outside 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:46.529
 that means always healthy 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:48.959
 in front of a shopping arcade here in cologne 

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:51.329
 and yes we really wanted to keep 

00:04:48.959 --> 00:04:53.529

00:04:51.329 --> 00:04:56.019
 that's just the thing right now 

00:04:53.529 --> 00:04:58.719

 but it is still possible 

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:14.079
 Maybe this is his plan 

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:16.149
