00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.010
 will be from a resolution that contains circular genetic elements 

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:09.520
 certain terms which 

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.449
 they are many smaller that consume bacterial and independent 

00:00:13.449 --> 00:00:18.019
 those plasmids enter inside other bacteria to calm them down 

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:21.949
 which contain new genetic characteristics bookshelves 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:25.359
 these meet with techniques the dancer and meat 

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:29.249
 generally the material content contains three elements 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:34.090
 a region of the Americas my son in which without certain age in exogenous 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.210
 a sequence that codes for 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.900
 an antibiotic that initially penicillin in this case South Korea 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:46.160
 and a replication lesion that allows the efficacy that the plasmid that 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.300
 the readings that was 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.760
 in this case orange colony 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.370
 this region the exministra that will carry the one of nexium hundred is dismissed in 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.780
 specific sites by also called essence 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.750
 since they are cut with an instinct the enzyme of justice 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:02.850
 for this case 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.420
 a polynomial sequence is recognized this sip that the genetic sequence 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.220
 same series I'll tell you chillers hacker left to right 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.430
 What this mosquito produces 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.620
 in each site you can accept fragments of anime that is deflated 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:19.400
 March 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:24.200
 the anemic ogino is cut with the same one so that it produces we are that 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.200
 if you complementary such extremes of the planet 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.980
 the shoots are linked through the enzyme leagues to 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.930
 and then in this way holds a recombinant plasmid 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.010
 this recombinant plant 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.410
 contains the oath of arenys cloned 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.410
 a sequence that codes for earthquake resistance 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.179
 and the sequence where the origin of the replication of the plastic will begin 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.320
 in each square and reconstitute 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.720
 you will find different fragments of DNA and diploma 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.290
 the arrows indicate the fragments 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.090
 every cell 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.350
 has a bacterial chromosome 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.450
 which is larger than it transmits recombinant 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.889
 and by a reconversion process 

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:11.569
 the cell is transformed 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:14.779
 since it incorporates in the bn after my disk so it will be 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:17.399
 the bacterial culture 

00:02:17.399 --> 00:02:18.679
 is incorporated 

00:02:18.679 --> 00:02:21.779
 over nutritious agar containing pool 

00:02:21.779 --> 00:02:26.719
 only those bacteria resistant to this antibiotic can grow in this 

00:02:26.719 --> 00:02:27.539
 rally 

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:32.419
 and after an incubation period of 37 degrees Celsius 70 colonies 

00:02:32.419 --> 00:02:35.499
 Bacteria that come from a single cell 

00:02:35.499 --> 00:02:38.649
 those bacteria that have not been transformed 

00:02:38.649 --> 00:02:43.119
 because they lack the recombinant planet and that those who feel Latin resistance 

00:02:43.119 --> 00:02:43.829
 very well 

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:47.019
 and is that they captured the plasmid budgets more 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:48.339
 and survive 

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:52.229
 kirk the origin of displaced replicas synthesizes a new 

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:54.779
 recombinant protein molecule 

00:02:54.779 --> 00:02:56.769
 the non-application of the raised plan 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:02:59.789
 this independent the chromosome 

00:02:59.789 --> 00:03:03.949
 when the bacterial chromosome does not repeat itself and the cells divide 

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:07.279
 minus one plasmid your label in each of the daughter cells 

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:10.000
 this way then 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
 more colonies of bacteria are being competed before which 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.710
 will have new genetic characteristics conferred by transmission 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:21.150
 bacteria that in this case were used as vectors
