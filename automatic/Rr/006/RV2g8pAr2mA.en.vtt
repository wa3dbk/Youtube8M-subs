so<00:00:20.789> that'll<00:00:21.029> be<00:00:21.090> really<00:00:21.330> cool<00:00:21.600> to<00:00:21.660> try<00:00:21.960> that

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
so that'll be really cool to try that

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.779 
so that'll be really cool to try that
all<00:00:22.260> out<00:00:22.439> I<00:00:22.680> guess<00:00:23.070> like<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.400> moonwalk<00:00:23.760> and

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
all out I guess like the moonwalk and

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.429 
all out I guess like the moonwalk and
all<00:00:24.150> that<00:00:24.330> random<00:00:24.660> stuff<00:00:24.930> so<00:00:25.109> rather<00:00:25.289> than

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
all that random stuff so rather than

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.730 
all that random stuff so rather than
trying<00:00:26.130> to<00:00:26.220> dance<00:00:26.490> to<00:00:27.210> his<00:00:27.480> actual<00:00:27.720> like<00:00:28.109> music

movements<00:00:30.929> in<00:00:31.050> themselves<00:00:31.470> but<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:32.099> majority

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
movements in themselves but the majority

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.510 
movements in themselves but the majority
of<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.300> video<00:00:33.630> game<00:00:33.840> experience<00:00:34.440> is<00:00:34.620> between

about<00:00:48.989> it<00:00:49.020> as<00:00:49.230> far<00:00:49.440> as<00:00:49.680> like<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:49.950> key<00:00:50.160> gameplay

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
about it as far as like the key gameplay

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.610 
about it as far as like the key gameplay
elements<00:00:51.239> this<00:00:51.390> is<00:00:51.449> both<00:00:51.750> single-player<00:00:52.230> as

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
elements this is both single-player as

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.040 
elements this is both single-player as
well<00:00:53.129> as<00:00:53.340> co-op<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:54.090> you<00:00:54.149> can<00:00:54.750> have<00:00:54.840> up<00:00:55.020> to

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
well as co-op and you can have up to

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.049 
well as co-op and you can have up to
four<00:00:55.440> players<00:00:55.620> playing<00:00:56.129> so<00:00:56.670> that's<00:00:56.850> pretty

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
four players playing so that's pretty

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.599 
four players playing so that's pretty
neat<00:00:57.300> but<00:00:58.050> none<00:00:58.289> of<00:00:58.320> them<00:00:58.500> are<00:00:58.800> simultaneous

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
neat but none of them are simultaneous

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.000 
neat but none of them are simultaneous
so<00:00:59.820> like<00:01:00.030> you<00:01:00.149> can't<00:01:00.180> go<00:01:00.930> ahead<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:01.559> dance

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010

so like you can't go ahead and dance
together<00:01:02.370> you<00:01:03.059> have<00:01:03.180> to<00:01:03.329> go<00:01:03.480> ahead<00:01:03.600> and<00:01:03.960> dance

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199

together you have to go ahead and dance
one<00:01:04.559> player<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:05.100> then<00:01:05.519> as<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:06.240> song<00:01:06.510> is

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
one player and then as the song is

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.020 
one player and then as the song is
progressing<00:01:07.260> still<00:01:07.560> it'll<00:01:07.950> call<00:01:08.310> a<00:01:08.340> player<00:01:08.700> to

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
progressing still it'll call a player to

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.969 
progressing still it'll call a player to
just<00:01:09.330> like<00:01:09.450> like<00:01:09.659> dance<00:01:10.080> central<00:01:10.500> did<00:01:10.770> and

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
just like like dance central did and

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.920

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
switches back and forth right so that's

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.270
