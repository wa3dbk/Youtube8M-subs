some lights on top and that's connected
to<00:04:56.590> a<00:04:56.680> little<00:04:56.920> mechanism<00:04:57.480> you<00:04:58.480> know<00:04:58.600> a<00:04:58.630> little

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:58.840 
to a little mechanism you know a little

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:05.030 
to a little mechanism you know a little
access<00:04:59.230> piece<00:04:59.470> and<00:05:00.100> also<00:05:00.340> I<00:05:00.520> call<00:05:00.790> that<00:05:03.810> this

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:05.040 
access piece and also I call that this

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.620 
access piece and also I call that this
just<00:05:06.040> moves<00:05:06.280> thought<00:05:07.030> make<00:05:07.240> it<00:05:07.390> look<00:05:07.510> like

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:07.630 
just moves thought make it look like

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:13.410 
just moves thought make it look like
he's<00:05:07.840> luring<00:05:08.590> in<00:05:08.890> dude<00:05:10.410> and<00:05:12.000> yeah<00:05:13.000> this<00:05:13.270> has

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:13.420 
he's luring in dude and yeah this has

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:18.360 
he's luring in dude and yeah this has
been<00:05:13.630> my<00:05:14.440> review<00:05:14.470> of<00:05:15.900> the<00:05:16.900> Spider<00:05:17.830> Man<00:05:18.070> Lego
