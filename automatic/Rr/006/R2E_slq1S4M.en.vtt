inventing the steam engine he knew the

inventing the steam engine he knew the
principles<00:01:08.550> of<00:01:08.730> steam<00:01:09.000> power<00:01:09.240> and<00:01:09.510> had

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:10.050 
principles of steam power and had

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.220 
principles of steam power and had
designed<00:01:10.470> a<00:01:10.620> revolutionary<00:01:11.400> device<00:01:12.230> what

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:13.230 
designed a revolutionary device what

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:15.290 
designed a revolutionary device what
might<00:01:13.470> have<00:01:13.650> happened<00:01:13.680> if<00:01:14.280> he'd<00:01:14.760> taken<00:01:15.030> that

might have happened if he'd taken that

Herron<00:02:17.980> had<00:02:18.310> managed<00:02:18.760> to<00:02:19.060> control<00:02:19.510> the<00:02:19.569> power
