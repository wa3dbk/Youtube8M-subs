trailer<00:01:46.869> configurations<00:01:47.560> you<00:01:48.009> might<00:01:48.159> have<00:01:48.340> to

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
trailer configurations you might have to

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:49.770 
trailer configurations you might have to
go<00:01:48.580> up<00:01:48.700> to<00:01:48.820> the<00:01:48.909> front<00:01:49.060> of<00:01:49.180> the<00:01:49.240> trailer<00:01:49.509> and

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
go up to the front of the trailer and

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.609 
go up to the front of the trailer and
blind<00:01:50.710> the<00:01:51.130> cranky<00:01:51.580> on<00:01:52.030> your<00:01:52.210> jack<00:01:52.479> jack<00:01:53.380> stand

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:53.619 
blind the cranky on your jack jack stand

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:56.190 
blind the cranky on your jack jack stand
down<00:01:53.770> a<00:01:53.799> little<00:01:54.039> bit<00:01:54.750> which<00:01:55.750> in<00:01:55.899> turn<00:01:56.110> will

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
down a little bit which in turn will

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.749 
down a little bit which in turn will
actually<00:01:56.470> raise<00:01:56.649> the<00:01:56.680> stern<00:01:57.130> so<00:01:57.310> you<00:01:57.399> get<00:01:57.610> this

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:57.759 
actually raise the stern so you get this

00:01:57.759 --> 00:01:59.460 
actually raise the stern so you get this
down<00:01:57.939> a<00:01:57.970> little<00:01:58.149> further<00:01:58.330> so<00:01:58.810> make<00:01:59.259> sure<00:01:59.289> you

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
down a little further so make sure you

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:00.749 
down a little further so make sure you
get<00:01:59.590> this<00:01:59.710> down<00:01:59.920> into<00:02:00.100> the<00:02:00.250> safe<00:02:00.430> operating

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:00.759 
get this down into the safe operating

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:03.779 
get this down into the safe operating
range<00:02:01.680> once<00:02:02.680> you<00:02:02.799> start<00:02:03.100> the<00:02:03.250> engine<00:02:03.340> you<00:02:03.700> know

00:02:03.779 --> 00:02:03.789 
range once you start the engine you know

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:05.940 
range once you start the engine you know
we'll<00:02:04.179> go<00:02:04.300> over<00:02:04.420> the<00:02:04.569> starting<00:02:04.869> actually<00:02:05.440> do

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
we'll go over the starting actually do

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.020 
we'll go over the starting actually do
the<00:02:06.039> starting<00:02:06.340> all<00:02:06.429> the<00:02:06.490> way<00:02:06.580> at<00:02:06.700> the<00:02:06.729> end<00:02:06.850> of

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
the starting all the way at the end of

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.059 
the starting all the way at the end of
the<00:02:07.119> video<00:02:07.539> here<00:02:07.780> so<00:02:08.440> I<00:02:08.500> can<00:02:08.649> talk<00:02:08.830> a<00:02:08.860> little

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069 
the video here so I can talk a little

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:12.300 
the video here so I can talk a little
more<00:02:09.810> once<00:02:10.810> you<00:02:10.929> started<00:02:11.319> one<00:02:11.860> thing<00:02:12.010> you<00:02:12.130> want

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
more once you started one thing you want

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:13.590 
more once you started one thing you want
to<00:02:12.370> check<00:02:12.580> is<00:02:12.819> that<00:02:12.970> you<00:02:13.090> have<00:02:13.239> water<00:02:13.480> coming

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
to check is that you have water coming

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.300 
to check is that you have water coming
out<00:02:13.989> of<00:02:14.319> course<00:02:14.560> I'm<00:02:14.680> gonna<00:02:14.769> have<00:02:14.890> to<00:02:15.010> hook<00:02:15.160> up

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
out of course I'm gonna have to hook up

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:16.949 
out of course I'm gonna have to hook up
water<00:02:15.549> to<00:02:16.030> here<00:02:16.239> which<00:02:16.420> will<00:02:16.569> do<00:02:16.660> that<00:02:16.810> in<00:02:16.900> a

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
water to here which will do that in a

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:21.360 
water to here which will do that in a
second<00:02:17.290> but<00:02:17.830> right<00:02:18.040> here<00:02:19.620> you<00:02:20.620> can<00:02:20.769> see<00:02:20.950> that

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
second but right here you can see that

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.210 
second but right here you can see that
on<00:02:21.459> the<00:02:21.549> camera<00:02:21.790> there<00:02:22.000> there's<00:02:22.750> a<00:02:22.810> hole

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
on the camera there there's a hole

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.380 
on the camera there there's a hole
there's<00:02:24.220> a<00:02:24.280> hole<00:02:24.459> on<00:02:24.489> the<00:02:24.640> other<00:02:24.700> side<00:02:24.880> as<00:02:25.209> well

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
there's a hole on the other side as well

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.110 
there's a hole on the other side as well
this<00:02:25.900> is<00:02:26.019> the<00:02:26.080> v6<00:02:26.430> v6<00:02:27.430> and<00:02:27.580> v8<00:02:27.730> are<00:02:27.970> very

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
this is the v6 v6 and v8 are very

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.780 
this is the v6 v6 and v8 are very
similar<00:02:28.390> in<00:02:29.170> that<00:02:29.319> your<00:02:29.799> water<00:02:30.160> exhaust<00:02:30.610> is

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
similar in that your water exhaust is

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.280 
similar in that your water exhaust is
gonna<00:02:30.880> come<00:02:31.150> out<00:02:31.239> of<00:02:31.299> those<00:02:31.480> two<00:02:31.690> holes<00:02:31.930> it's

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
gonna come out of those two holes it's

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.259 
gonna come out of those two holes it's
just<00:02:32.440> gonna<00:02:32.530> drop<00:02:32.769> right<00:02:32.830> down<00:02:33.069> if<00:02:33.910> you<00:02:34.090> have<00:02:34.239> a

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:34.269 
just gonna drop right down if you have a

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:35.640 
just gonna drop right down if you have a
four-cylinder<00:02:34.989> it's<00:02:35.290> only<00:02:35.380> going<00:02:35.500> to<00:02:35.560> come

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
four-cylinder it's only going to come

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.710 
four-cylinder it's only going to come
out<00:02:35.799> one<00:02:36.040> side<00:02:36.310> so<00:02:36.910> don't<00:02:36.940> get<00:02:37.209> confused<00:02:37.329> if

got water coming out one side that's

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.690 
got water coming out one side that's
okay<00:02:41.500> that's<00:02:41.650> normal<00:02:41.769> it's<00:02:42.220> only<00:02:42.340> gonna<00:02:42.519> come

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:47.599 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:49.449 

next<00:02:48.230> thing<00:02:48.349> of<00:02:48.439> course<00:02:48.469> that<00:02:49.219> you're<00:02:49.340> going

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
next thing of course that you're going

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:52.209 
next thing of course that you're going
to<00:02:49.519> need<00:02:49.670> is<00:02:50.049> flush<00:02:51.049> kit<00:02:51.230> and<00:02:51.769> this<00:02:51.920> is<00:02:52.040> just

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:52.219 
to need is flush kit and this is just

00:02:52.219 --> 00:02:53.410 
to need is flush kit and this is just
that<00:02:52.370> some<00:02:52.549> people<00:02:52.760> just<00:02:52.790> call<00:02:53.090> them<00:02:53.180> muffs

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
that some people just call them muffs

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.000 
that some people just call them muffs
and<00:02:53.930> it<00:02:54.019> kind<00:02:54.170> of<00:02:54.200> looks<00:02:54.379> like<00:02:54.439> like<00:02:54.799> ear<00:02:54.950> muffs

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
and it kind of looks like like ear muffs

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.970 
and it kind of looks like like ear muffs
and<00:02:55.790> just<00:02:56.420> hook<00:02:56.510> it<00:02:56.629> up<00:02:56.719> to<00:02:56.840> a<00:02:56.870> garden<00:02:57.140> hose

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.970 

slide<00:03:00.980> it<00:03:01.189> on<00:03:02.439> till<00:03:03.439> it<00:03:03.530> covers<00:03:03.829> up<00:03:03.859> your

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
slide it on till it covers up your

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.720 
slide it on till it covers up your
intake

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.820 

try<00:03:08.210> to<00:03:08.270> get<00:03:08.450> it<00:03:08.540> about<00:03:08.720> Center<00:03:09.110> and<00:03:09.530> once<00:03:09.710> we

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
try to get it about Center and once we

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:11.470 
try to get it about Center and once we
start<00:03:10.070> it<00:03:10.160> up<00:03:10.250> once<00:03:10.760> you<00:03:10.820> put<00:03:10.970> water<00:03:11.150> pressure

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
start it up once you put water pressure

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.210 
start it up once you put water pressure
on<00:03:11.660> this<00:03:11.780> occasionally<00:03:12.650> the<00:03:12.770> water<00:03:12.950> pressure

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
on this occasionally the water pressure

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:14.560 
on this occasionally the water pressure
might<00:03:13.430> knock<00:03:13.610> that<00:03:13.790> off<00:03:13.850> so<00:03:14.300> check<00:03:14.540> that

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:14.570 
might knock that off so check that

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:16.480 
might knock that off so check that
you're<00:03:15.500> gonna<00:03:15.590> check<00:03:15.830> this<00:03:16.070> to<00:03:16.250> make<00:03:16.280> sure

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:16.490 
you're gonna check this to make sure

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:17.860 
you're gonna check this to make sure
that<00:03:16.610> stays<00:03:16.850> on<00:03:16.940> after<00:03:17.360> you<00:03:17.420> start<00:03:17.630> the<00:03:17.780> engine

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
that stays on after you start the engine

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.740 
that stays on after you start the engine
and<00:03:18.610> they<00:03:19.610> just<00:03:19.730> look<00:03:19.880> for<00:03:20.030> that<00:03:20.120> water<00:03:20.330> coming

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
and they just look for that water coming

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.280 
and they just look for that water coming
out<00:03:20.870> just<00:03:21.290> as<00:03:21.440> a<00:03:21.530> double<00:03:21.800> check<00:03:23.080> one<00:03:24.080> other

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
out just as a double check one other

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.650 
out just as a double check one other
thing<00:03:24.440> while<00:03:24.590> you're<00:03:24.830> when<00:03:25.700> you're<00:03:25.820> had<00:03:26.540> the

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
thing while you're when you're had the

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.720 
thing while you're when you're had the
engine<00:03:26.960> started<00:03:27.380> it's<00:03:27.800> okay<00:03:28.130> to<00:03:28.190> go<00:03:28.430> ahead<00:03:28.580> and

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
engine started it's okay to go ahead and

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:29.860 
engine started it's okay to go ahead and
wrap<00:03:28.850> it<00:03:29.000> up<00:03:29.120> something<00:03:29.450> you<00:03:29.570> don't<00:03:29.690> want<00:03:29.810> to

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
wrap it up something you don't want to

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:31.540 
wrap it up something you don't want to
go<00:03:29.960> crazy<00:03:30.140> with<00:03:30.560> it<00:03:30.590> two<00:03:30.980> or<00:03:31.040> three<00:03:31.190> thousand

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:31.550 
go crazy with it two or three thousand

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:32.440 
go crazy with it two or three thousand
rpm<00:03:31.910> or<00:03:32.060> so

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
rpm or so

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.110 
rpm or so
tops<00:03:33.370> especially<00:03:34.370> if<00:03:34.430> you<00:03:34.490> have<00:03:34.640> it<00:03:34.760> in<00:03:34.850> gear

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
tops especially if you have it in gear

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.840 
tops especially if you have it in gear
and<00:03:35.390> it<00:03:35.480> is<00:03:35.600> okay<00:03:35.840> to<00:03:35.900> go<00:03:36.110> in<00:03:36.260> gear<00:03:36.530> but<00:03:37.250> when

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:37.850 
and it is okay to go in gear but when

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:39.040 
and it is okay to go in gear but when
you<00:03:37.940> have<00:03:38.060> a<00:03:38.090> propeller<00:03:38.480> on<00:03:38.600> there<00:03:38.840> or<00:03:38.930> even

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:39.050 
you have a propeller on there or even

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:40.480 
you have a propeller on there or even
without<00:03:39.500> a<00:03:39.530> propeller<00:03:39.709> in<00:03:40.010> this<00:03:40.160> case<00:03:40.340> it's

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:40.490 
without a propeller in this case it's

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:42.490 
without a propeller in this case it's
even<00:03:40.550> worse<00:03:40.790> that's<00:03:41.510> gonna<00:03:41.630> spin<00:03:42.020> up<00:03:42.140> too<00:03:42.320> fast

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
even worse that's gonna spin up too fast

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.040 
even worse that's gonna spin up too fast
so<00:03:43.280> keep<00:03:43.520> the<00:03:43.640> RPMs<00:03:44.030> a<00:03:44.209> little<00:03:44.630> bit<00:03:44.720> lower<00:03:44.870> but

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:45.050 
so keep the RPMs a little bit lower but

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:47.800 
so keep the RPMs a little bit lower but
it<00:03:45.110> is<00:03:45.230> okay<00:03:45.470> to<00:03:45.530> to<00:03:45.980> rev<00:03:46.130> it<00:03:46.280> up<00:03:46.400> to<00:03:47.270> rev<00:03:47.390> it<00:03:47.480> up

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
it is okay to to rev it up to rev it up

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.810 
it is okay to to rev it up to rev it up
some<00:03:48.790> again<00:03:49.790> checking<00:03:50.239> make<00:03:50.750> sure<00:03:51.170> that's<00:03:51.290> all

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:51.820 
some again checking make sure that's all

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:56.110 
some again checking make sure that's all
sustained<00:03:53.140> faint<00:03:54.140> on<00:03:54.260> them<00:03:54.760> just<00:03:55.760> a<00:03:55.880> side<00:03:56.090> note

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
sustained faint on them just a side note

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.030 
sustained faint on them just a side note
when<00:03:56.420> you<00:03:56.540> do<00:03:56.810> your<00:03:56.989> shifting<00:03:57.380> when<00:03:57.860> you're

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
when you do your shifting when you're

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.130 
when you do your shifting when you're
shifting<00:03:58.190> into<00:03:58.489> forward<00:03:58.820> or<00:03:58.940> reverse<00:03:59.330> shift

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 
shifting into forward or reverse shift

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.710 
shifting into forward or reverse shift
quickly<00:04:00.590> if<00:04:01.489> gears<00:04:01.910> when<00:04:02.270> you<00:04:02.360> shift<00:04:02.570> into

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 
quickly if gears when you shift into

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.020 
quickly if gears when you shift into
four<00:04:02.989> to<00:04:03.110> reverse<00:04:03.320> these<00:04:03.500> gears<00:04:03.830> lock<00:04:04.100> they

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 
four to reverse these gears lock they

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.300 
four to reverse these gears lock they
come<00:04:05.239> they<00:04:05.720> start<00:04:06.260> out<00:04:06.380> here<00:04:06.530> and<00:04:06.680> they<00:04:06.739> coming

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310 
come they start out here and they coming

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:08.979 
come they start out here and they coming
together<00:04:07.430> it's<00:04:08.000> gonna<00:04:08.120> make<00:04:08.300> a<00:04:08.330> loud<00:04:08.600> clunk

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:08.989 
together it's gonna make a loud clunk

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:10.510 
together it's gonna make a loud clunk
sound<00:04:09.230> especially<00:04:09.890> when<00:04:10.010> we're<00:04:10.100> out<00:04:10.160> of<00:04:10.190> water

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:10.520 
sound especially when we're out of water

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.699 
sound especially when we're out of water
that's<00:04:10.940> okay<00:04:11.300> that's<00:04:11.450> a<00:04:11.600> good<00:04:11.840> thing<00:04:12.110> what<00:04:12.620> you

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:12.709 
that's okay that's a good thing what you

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:15.150 
that's okay that's a good thing what you
don't<00:04:12.980> want<00:04:13.190> is<00:04:13.340> a<00:04:13.370> slow<00:04:13.760> shift<00:04:14.269> a<00:04:14.540> slow

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.160 
don't want is a slow shift a slow

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.320 
don't want is a slow shift a slow
getting<00:04:16.160> into<00:04:16.400> and<00:04:16.519> out<00:04:16.580> of<00:04:16.640> gear<00:04:16.940> because

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:17.330 
getting into and out of gear because

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:18.490 
getting into and out of gear because
what<00:04:17.570> that<00:04:17.600> will<00:04:17.840> do<00:04:17.959> is<00:04:18.080> it<00:04:18.140> allows<00:04:18.350> those

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
what that will do is it allows those

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.920 
what that will do is it allows those
gears<00:04:18.739> to<00:04:18.890> grind<00:04:19.459> and<00:04:20.209> you<00:04:20.269> don't<00:04:20.419> want<00:04:20.570> that

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930 
gears to grind and you don't want that

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:22.810 
gears to grind and you don't want that
so<00:04:21.109> you<00:04:21.200> want<00:04:21.440> to<00:04:21.500> clunk<00:04:22.010> you<00:04:22.370> don't<00:04:22.520> want<00:04:22.700> to

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
so you want to clunk you don't want to

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.760 
so you want to clunk you don't want to
grind<00:04:23.240> grind<00:04:23.540> grind<00:04:23.630> grind<00:04:23.870> clunk<00:04:24.350> that<00:04:24.650> would

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
grind grind grind grind clunk that would

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:27.670 
grind grind grind grind clunk that would
be<00:04:24.860> bad<00:04:25.120> I'm<00:04:26.120> gonna<00:04:26.270> turn<00:04:26.419> the<00:04:26.570> water<00:04:26.720> on<00:04:26.840> we're

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
be bad I'm gonna turn the water on we're

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.830 
be bad I'm gonna turn the water on we're
just<00:04:27.830> about<00:04:28.010> ready<00:04:28.250> to<00:04:28.310> start<00:04:28.370> it<00:04:28.640> up<00:04:28.760> here<00:04:28.970> in

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
just about ready to start it up here in

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.020 
just about ready to start it up here in
main<00:04:30.110> thing<00:04:30.290> to<00:04:30.380> check<00:04:30.590> down<00:04:31.130> into<00:04:31.430> the<00:04:31.550> safe

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
main thing to check down into the safe

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:33.969 
main thing to check down into the safe
range<00:04:32.270> we've<00:04:32.960> got<00:04:33.080> water<00:04:33.290> pressure<00:04:33.620> we're

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:33.979 
range we've got water pressure we're

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:35.200 
range we've got water pressure we're
gonna<00:04:34.070> put<00:04:34.310> water<00:04:34.490> on<00:04:34.610> there<00:04:34.910> so<00:04:35.030> we'll<00:04:35.150> have

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
gonna put water on there so we'll have

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:36.909 
gonna put water on there so we'll have
water<00:04:35.450> coming<00:04:35.780> in<00:04:35.930> then<00:04:36.530> you<00:04:36.620> can<00:04:36.710> go<00:04:36.830> ahead

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:36.919 
water coming in then you can go ahead

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:45.040 
water coming in then you can go ahead
and<00:04:37.160> start

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.050 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:47.480 

so<00:04:46.050> before<00:04:46.350> I<00:04:46.380> go<00:04:46.590> up<00:04:46.710> there<00:04:46.890> just<00:04:47.190> look<00:04:47.370> at

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
so before I go up there just look at

00:04:47.490 --> 00:05:34.800 
so before I go up there just look at
making<00:04:47.640> sure<00:04:47.910> those<00:04:48.660> lots<00:04:48.930> are<00:04:49.050> staying<00:04:49.320> there

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:34.810 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:36.760 

that's<00:05:35.810> about<00:05:35.990> all<00:05:36.050> there<00:05:36.320> really<00:05:36.470> is<00:05:36.650> to

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:36.770 
that's about all there really is to

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:39.850 
that's about all there really is to
start<00:05:37.729> your<00:05:37.880> engine<00:05:38.150> up<00:05:38.620> making<00:05:39.620> sure<00:05:39.740> the

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:39.860 
start your engine up making sure the

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:43.270 
start your engine up making sure the
water<00:05:40.039> stays<00:05:40.310> on<00:05:41.169> puff<00:05:42.169> stay<00:05:42.410> on<00:05:42.590> get<00:05:43.100> down

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:43.280 
water stays on puff stay on get down

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:45.340 
water stays on puff stay on get down
into<00:05:43.430> that<00:05:43.580> safe<00:05:43.820> range<00:05:44.060> go<00:05:44.900> ahead<00:05:45.080> and<00:05:45.199> start

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:45.350 
into that safe range go ahead and start

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:47.950 
into that safe range go ahead and start
it<00:05:45.470> up<00:05:45.530> and<00:05:46.060> you<00:05:47.060> got<00:05:47.150> any<00:05:47.300> questions<00:05:47.660> so<00:05:47.810> we
