interior<00:02:27.040> like<00:02:27.220> the<00:02:27.400> building<00:02:28.209> bit<00:02:28.360> inside

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
interior like the building bit inside

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.240 
interior like the building bit inside
looks<00:02:29.019> really<00:02:29.290> good<00:02:29.410> as<00:02:29.560> well<00:02:29.739> yeah<00:02:30.040> they're

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
looks really good as well yeah they're

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.470 
looks really good as well yeah they're
empty<00:02:30.489> at<00:02:30.550> the<00:02:30.580> moment<00:02:30.640> but<00:02:31.000> this<00:02:31.209> is<00:02:31.330> like

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
empty at the moment but this is like

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:32.850 
empty at the moment but this is like
roughly<00:02:31.900> what<00:02:32.050> we're<00:02:32.170> going<00:02:32.260> to<00:02:32.380> be<00:02:32.410> going<00:02:32.530> for

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
roughly what we're going to be going for

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.220 
roughly what we're going to be going for
their<00:02:33.640> through<00:02:34.030> all<00:02:34.450> the<00:02:34.690> other<00:02:34.840> buildings

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
their through all the other buildings

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.229 
their through all the other buildings
they<00:02:35.920> build<00:02:36.160> three<00:02:36.340> building<00:02:36.370> so<00:02:36.910> far<00:02:36.940> but

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
they build three building so far but

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:39.180 
they build three building so far but
they<00:02:37.599> take<00:02:37.840> ages<00:02:38.230> to<00:02:38.260> build<00:02:38.530> these<00:02:38.709> buildings

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
they take ages to build these buildings

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.839 
they take ages to build these buildings
but<00:02:39.549> you<00:02:39.640> see<00:02:39.790> what<00:02:41.190> takes<00:02:42.190> so<00:02:42.250> long<00:02:42.489> to<00:02:42.549> build

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:42.849 
but you see what takes so long to build

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:45.600 
but you see what takes so long to build
yeah<00:02:43.690> I<00:02:43.720> can<00:02:44.019> get<00:02:44.200> I'm<00:02:44.590> showing<00:02:45.190> the<00:02:45.280> insides
