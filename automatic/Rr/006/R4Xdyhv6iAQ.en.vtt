and<00:00:52.739> stick<00:00:53.739> to<00:00:53.859> that<00:00:53.920> game<00:00:54.219> plan<00:00:54.629> so<00:00:55.629> I<00:00:55.660> think

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
and stick to that game plan so I think

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.669 
and stick to that game plan so I think
that's<00:00:56.230> Alvarado's<00:00:56.949> best<00:00:57.370> bet<00:00:57.609> is<00:00:57.850> to<00:00:58.210> just

00:00:58.669 --> 00:00:58.679 
that's Alvarado's best bet is to just

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:03.509 
that's Alvarado's best bet is to just
use<00:00:59.679> his<00:00:59.949> size<00:01:00.219> his<00:01:01.030> youth<00:01:02.370> seven<00:01:03.370> years

00:01:03.509 --> 00:01:03.519 
use his size his youth seven years

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:07.410 
use his size his youth seven years
younger<00:01:03.699> than<00:01:03.940> Marquez<00:01:04.390> and<00:01:05.040> and<00:01:06.180> just<00:01:07.180> try<00:01:07.360> to

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
younger than Marquez and and just try to

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.359 
younger than Marquez and and just try to
box<00:01:08.100> Marquez<00:01:09.100> and<00:01:09.369> and<00:01:10.170> not<00:01:11.170> let<00:01:12.070> the<00:01:12.159> fight

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:12.369 
box Marquez and and not let the fight

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:14.910 
box Marquez and and not let the fight
break<00:01:12.610> out<00:01:12.759> into<00:01:12.970> a<00:01:13.090> war<00:01:13.450> which<00:01:14.110> is<00:01:14.320> the<00:01:14.500> exact

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 
break out into a war which is the exact

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.520 
break out into a war which is the exact
thing<00:01:15.549> that<00:01:15.579> Marquez<00:01:16.479> is<00:01:16.750> looking<00:01:17.079> for<00:01:17.320> and

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.530 
thing that Marquez is looking for and

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.210 
thing that Marquez is looking for and
would<00:01:17.650> love<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:19.420> the<00:01:19.869> family<00:01:20.049> would<00:01:20.290> love<00:01:20.470> and

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:21.220 
would love and the family would love and

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.999 
would love and the family would love and
I<00:01:21.640> think<00:01:21.700> that<00:01:22.110> that's<00:01:23.110> what<00:01:23.470> the<00:01:23.590> fight<00:01:23.799> will

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:24.009 
I think that that's what the fight will

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:27.840 
I think that that's what the fight will
break<00:01:24.430> out<00:01:24.610> into<00:01:25.350> because<00:01:26.350> although<00:01:26.850> Alvarado

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
break out into because although Alvarado

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.700 
break out into because although Alvarado
and<00:01:28.180> his<00:01:28.270> team<00:01:28.570> would<00:01:29.079> want<00:01:29.290> nothing<00:01:29.530> more

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
and his team would want nothing more

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.090 
and his team would want nothing more
than<00:01:29.920> to<00:01:30.130> to<00:01:30.820> outbox<00:01:31.509> Marquez<00:01:32.020> and<00:01:32.290> coast<00:01:32.560> to<00:01:33.070> a

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
than to to outbox Marquez and coast to a

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.910 
than to to outbox Marquez and coast to a
points<00:01:33.729> victory<00:01:34.350> you<00:01:35.350> can't<00:01:35.380> forget<00:01:35.860> that

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
points victory you can't forget that

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.179 
points victory you can't forget that
Alvarado<00:01:36.549> is<00:01:36.970> a<00:01:37.350> proven<00:01:38.350> warrior<00:01:38.560> without

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:39.189 
Alvarado is a proven warrior without

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:42.359 
Alvarado is a proven warrior without
question<00:01:39.759> and<00:01:40.259> it's<00:01:41.259> almost<00:01:41.530> like<00:01:41.920> as<00:01:42.070> soon<00:01:42.250> as

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:42.369 
question and it's almost like as soon as

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:45.510 
question and it's almost like as soon as
he<00:01:42.520> gets<00:01:42.729> tagged<00:01:43.090> with<00:01:43.329> something<00:01:44.130> hard<00:01:45.130> shot

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
he gets tagged with something hard shot

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.899 
he gets tagged with something hard shot
he<00:01:46.270> throws<00:01:47.020> a<00:01:47.079> gameplan<00:01:47.680> and<00:01:47.740> all<00:01:48.310> that<00:01:48.490> boxing

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:48.909 
he throws a gameplan and all that boxing

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:52.260 
he throws a gameplan and all that boxing
talk<00:01:49.119> straight<00:01:49.780> out<00:01:49.930> the<00:01:50.079> window<00:01:50.409> and<00:01:51.270> engages

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
talk straight out the window and engages

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.380 
talk straight out the window and engages
with<00:01:52.750> his<00:01:52.930> opponent<00:01:53.469> and<00:01:53.619> and<00:01:54.040> goes<00:01:54.909> to<00:01:55.149> war

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
with his opponent and and goes to war

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.069 
with his opponent and and goes to war
and<00:01:55.659> throws<00:01:56.460> right<00:01:57.460> back<00:01:57.729> so<00:01:58.090> I<00:01:58.329> think<00:01:58.719> that's

00:01:59.069 --> 00:01:59.079 
and throws right back so I think that's

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:01.050 
and throws right back so I think that's
what's<00:01:59.259> gonna<00:01:59.439> happen<00:01:59.649> at<00:02:00.009> some<00:02:00.640> point<00:02:00.880> in<00:02:00.969> the

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
what's gonna happen at some point in the

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.300 
what's gonna happen at some point in the
fight<00:02:01.270> I<00:02:01.450> think<00:02:01.689> early<00:02:02.020> on<00:02:02.049> it<00:02:02.500> might<00:02:02.979> be<00:02:03.130> more

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
fight I think early on it might be more

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.330 
fight I think early on it might be more
of<00:02:03.430> a<00:02:03.490> boxing<00:02:03.880> match<00:02:04.060> in<00:02:04.329> the<00:02:04.420> early<00:02:04.689> rounds

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
of a boxing match in the early rounds

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.020 
of a boxing match in the early rounds
but<00:02:06.340> Marquez<00:02:07.000> will<00:02:07.320> systematically<00:02:08.320> break

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
but Marquez will systematically break

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.280 
but Marquez will systematically break
Alvarado<00:02:10.030> down

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
Alvarado down

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.520 
Alvarado down
and<00:02:11.379> then<00:02:11.799> into<00:02:12.610> the<00:02:12.730> later<00:02:12.909> rounds<00:02:13.530> possibly

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
and then into the later rounds possibly

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.940 
and then into the later rounds possibly
get<00:02:14.739> a<00:02:14.980> TKO<00:02:15.790> stoppage<00:02:16.379> around<00:02:17.379> nine<00:02:17.560> or<00:02:17.590> ten

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
get a TKO stoppage around nine or ten

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.479 
get a TKO stoppage around nine or ten
rounds<00:02:19.349> but<00:02:20.349> it's<00:02:20.530> really<00:02:20.680> it's<00:02:20.980> just<00:02:21.099> it's

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
rounds but it's really it's just it's

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:24.000 
rounds but it's really it's just it's
just<00:02:21.549> a<00:02:21.790> good<00:02:21.969> fight<00:02:22.269> overall<00:02:22.930> I<00:02:23.260> don't<00:02:23.799> think

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
just a good fight overall I don't think

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.009 
just a good fight overall I don't think
it<00:02:24.310> does<00:02:24.489> much<00:02:24.760> for<00:02:25.000> either<00:02:25.150> guy<00:02:25.450> other<00:02:25.750> than

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:26.019 
it does much for either guy other than

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:27.899 
it does much for either guy other than

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
column and the only huge factor

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:35.690

after<00:02:32.769> the<00:02:32.890> fight<00:02:33.129> for<00:02:33.640> the<00:02:33.760> winner<00:02:33.939> is<00:02:34.620> being

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
after the fight for the winner is being

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.780 
after the fight for the winner is being
considered<00:02:36.700> for<00:02:36.849> a<00:02:37.420> pack<00:02:38.079> al<00:02:38.290> fight<00:02:38.670> but<00:02:39.670> at

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
considered for a pack al fight but at

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.319 
considered for a pack al fight but at
this<00:02:39.970> point<00:02:40.269> I<00:02:40.510> don't<00:02:40.780> think<00:02:41.019> many<00:02:41.859> people

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:42.329 
this point I don't think many people

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:45.119 
this point I don't think many people
want<00:02:43.329> to<00:02:43.420> see<00:02:43.659> either<00:02:44.049> guy<00:02:44.409> versus<00:02:44.889> Pacquiao

00:02:45.119 --> 00:02:45.129 
want to see either guy versus Pacquiao

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:49.409 
want to see either guy versus Pacquiao
and<00:02:46.650> that's<00:02:47.650> just<00:02:48.099> a<00:02:48.220> whole<00:02:48.430> nother<00:02:48.760> topic<00:02:48.849> in

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:49.419 
and that's just a whole nother topic in

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:53.580 
and that's just a whole nother topic in
itself<00:02:49.720> and<00:02:50.340> I<00:02:51.340> think<00:02:51.760> this<00:02:52.030> is<00:02:52.269> uh<00:02:52.530> this<00:02:53.530> is

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
itself and I think this is uh this is

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.929 
itself and I think this is uh this is
tough<00:02:54.129> on<00:02:54.280> HBO<00:02:54.930> because<00:02:55.930> I<00:02:56.379> mean<00:02:57.129> they're

00:02:57.929 --> 00:02:57.939 
tough on HBO because I mean they're

00:02:57.939 --> 00:03:00.860 
tough on HBO because I mean they're
their<00:02:58.829> options<00:02:59.829> are<00:02:59.980> very<00:03:00.129> limited<00:03:00.280> right<00:03:00.819> now

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
their options are very limited right now

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.569 
their options are very limited right now
unless<00:03:01.870> top<00:03:02.439> rank<00:03:02.739> starts<00:03:03.069> working<00:03:03.430> with

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
know getting kind of ridiculous that

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:12.690 
know getting kind of ridiculous that
they're<00:03:10.150> trying<00:03:10.480> to<00:03:10.510> make<00:03:10.750> and<00:03:11.519> like<00:03:12.519> I<00:03:12.639> said

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
they're trying to make and like I said

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.280 
they're trying to make and like I said
this<00:03:12.939> is<00:03:13.090> a<00:03:13.120> good<00:03:13.329> fight<00:03:13.629> but<00:03:13.659> it's<00:03:13.930> not<00:03:14.019> a<00:03:14.049> big

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
this is a good fight but it's not a big

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.839 
this is a good fight but it's not a big
fight<00:03:14.590> and<00:03:14.799> it<00:03:15.579> should<00:03:16.359> be<00:03:16.510> a<00:03:17.129> win<00:03:18.129> for<00:03:18.489> for

00:03:18.839 --> 00:03:18.849 
fight and it should be a win for for

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:21.990 
fight and it should be a win for for
Marquez<00:03:19.829> but<00:03:20.829> that<00:03:21.010> would<00:03:21.220> like<00:03:21.400> I<00:03:21.519> said<00:03:21.729> set

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
Marquez but that would like I said set

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.089 
Marquez but that would like I said set
him<00:03:22.120> up<00:03:22.209> for<00:03:22.269> a<00:03:22.479> fifth<00:03:22.930> fight<00:03:23.229> with<00:03:23.680> Manny

not<00:03:31.840> sure<00:03:32.019> how<00:03:32.199> they<00:03:32.889> would<00:03:33.040> even<00:03:33.159> go<00:03:33.400> about

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:33.579 
not sure how they would even go about

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:36.059 
not sure how they would even go about
promoting<00:03:33.819> that<00:03:34.269> to<00:03:34.510> to<00:03:35.019> create<00:03:35.349> any<00:03:35.560> interest

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:36.069
