00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
fun but you can also use these banked

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.100 
fun but you can also use these banked
corners<00:01:31.320> here<00:01:32.100> to<00:01:32.760> really<00:01:33.030> start<00:01:33.330> to<00:01:33.540> develop

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
corners here to really start to develop

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.460 
corners here to really start to develop
a<00:01:34.200> bit<00:01:34.380> of<00:01:34.500> balance<00:01:34.800> against<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:36.570> outside<00:01:37.050> ski

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
a bit of balance against the outside ski

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.280 
a bit of balance against the outside ski
check<00:01:37.920> this<00:01:38.070> out<00:01:38.370> right<00:01:38.640> here<00:01:38.909> like<00:01:39.090> this<00:01:39.330> I<00:01:39.600> go

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
check this out right here like this I go

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.760 
check this out right here like this I go
through<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.920> bank<00:01:41.870> and<00:01:42.870> I'm<00:01:42.990> on<00:01:43.200> to<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.440> side

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
through the bank and I'm on to the side

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.649 
through the bank and I'm on to the side
outside<00:01:44.280> ski<00:01:44.940> just<00:01:45.270> like<00:01:45.510> that<00:01:47.450> and<00:01:48.450> then

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
outside ski just like that and then

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.770 
outside ski just like that and then
right<00:01:48.900> here<00:01:48.930> outside<00:01:49.710> ski<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:51.510> bank

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
right here outside ski and the bank

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.780 
right here outside ski and the bank
creates<00:01:52.200> that<00:01:52.409> balance<00:01:52.979> to<00:01:53.190> the<00:01:53.310> outside

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
creates that balance to the outside

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.360 
creates that balance to the outside
which<00:01:54.090> is<00:01:54.330> really<00:01:54.690> important<00:01:55.260> for<00:01:55.530> ski

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:56.370 
which is really important for ski

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:00.520 
which is really important for ski
performance<00:01:57.120> and<00:01:57.979> just<00:01:58.979> edge<00:01:59.250> grip

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
performance and just edge grip

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.350 
performance and just edge grip
so<00:02:01.530> another<00:02:01.799> cool<00:02:02.100> feature<00:02:02.460> that<00:02:02.640> you<00:02:02.909> find<00:02:03.210> in

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
so another cool feature that you find in

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.420 
so another cool feature that you find in
these<00:02:03.479> snow<00:02:03.780> cross<00:02:04.049> courses<00:02:04.650> is<00:02:05.189> these

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
these snow cross courses is these

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.460 
these snow cross courses is these
rollers<00:02:06.030> and<00:02:06.240> they<00:02:06.330> let<00:02:06.509> me<00:02:06.630> get<00:02:06.750> a<00:02:06.810> sensation

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
rollers and they let me get a sensation

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.070 
rollers and they let me get a sensation
of<00:02:07.560> speed<00:02:07.860> but<00:02:08.700> then<00:02:08.849> also<00:02:09.060> controlling<00:02:09.899> my

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
of speed but then also controlling my

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.760 
of speed but then also controlling my
speed

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
speed

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.130 
speed
so<00:02:11.580> ski<00:02:11.849> instructors<00:02:12.360> have<00:02:12.510> been<00:02:12.660> using<00:02:12.900> these

so ski instructors have been using these

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.800 
so ski instructors have been using these

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.220 
of fun these little jumps and rolls and
things<00:02:20.160> like<00:02:20.430> that<00:02:20.489> but<00:02:21.450> I<00:02:21.480> suppose<00:02:21.870> with<00:02:22.110> the

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
things like that but I suppose with the

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.979 
things like that but I suppose with the
advent<00:02:22.590> of<00:02:22.800> terrain<00:02:23.220> parks<00:02:23.760> along<00:02:24.150> comes<00:02:24.840> a

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
advent of terrain parks along comes a

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:26.930 
advent of terrain parks along comes a
little<00:02:25.230> bit<00:02:25.350> of<00:02:25.500> a<00:02:25.590> new<00:02:25.800> feature<00:02:26.160> and<00:02:26.580> that's

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
little bit of a new feature and that's

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.610 
little bit of a new feature and that's
that<00:02:27.209> terrain<00:02:27.540> based<00:02:27.840> learning<00:02:28.260> so<00:02:28.350> we've<00:02:28.470> got

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
that terrain based learning so we've got

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.979 
that terrain based learning so we've got
the<00:02:28.739> Ogopogo<00:02:29.010> trail<00:02:29.700> through<00:02:30.420> the<00:02:30.450> woods<00:02:30.780> with

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
the Ogopogo trail through the woods with

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:32.809 
the Ogopogo trail through the woods with
some<00:02:31.050> natural<00:02:31.650> and<00:02:31.800> man-made<00:02:32.040> features<00:02:32.489> that

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
some natural and man-made features that

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:35.360 
some natural and man-made features that
help<00:02:33.000> steering<00:02:33.540> skills<00:02:34.010> controlling<00:02:35.010> speed

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
help steering skills controlling speed

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.370 
help steering skills controlling speed
and<00:02:35.610> that<00:02:35.670> sort<00:02:35.970> of<00:02:36.030> thing<00:02:36.239> the<00:02:36.750> big<00:02:37.019> wide-open

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
and that sort of thing the big wide-open

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.410 
and that sort of thing the big wide-open
berms<00:02:37.980> are<00:02:38.280> the<00:02:38.370> ski<00:02:38.610> cross<00:02:38.910> course

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
berms are the ski cross course

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.479 
berms are the ski cross course
well<00:02:39.750> they<00:02:39.870> promote<00:02:40.260> balance<00:02:40.680> to<00:02:41.040> the<00:02:41.160> outside

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
well they promote balance to the outside

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:43.070 
well they promote balance to the outside
ski<00:02:41.730> which<00:02:41.910> is<00:02:42.060> critical<00:02:42.540> for<00:02:42.569> parallel

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
ski which is critical for parallel

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.020 
ski which is critical for parallel
skiing<00:02:43.410> and<00:02:43.590> those<00:02:44.069> little<00:02:44.340> rolls<00:02:44.580> allow<00:02:44.970> you

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
skiing and those little rolls allow you

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.539 
skiing and those little rolls allow you
to<00:02:45.209> get<00:02:45.299> a<00:02:45.360> bit<00:02:45.540> of<00:02:45.630> a<00:02:45.720> sensation<00:02:45.900> of<00:02:46.440> speed<00:02:46.799> but

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:47.549 
to get a bit of a sensation of speed but

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:49.280 
to get a bit of a sensation of speed but
then<00:02:47.760> they<00:02:47.910> also<00:02:48.120> help<00:02:48.510> you<00:02:48.630> control<00:02:49.019> the

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
then they also help you control the

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.620 
then they also help you control the
speed<00:02:49.590> which<00:02:50.130> is<00:02:50.160> awesome<00:02:50.819> so<00:02:51.269> I<00:02:51.299> hope<00:02:51.450> that

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
speed which is awesome so I hope that

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.360 
speed which is awesome so I hope that
stuff<00:02:51.930> works<00:02:52.170> for<00:02:52.410> you<00:02:52.530> next<00:02:52.950> time<00:02:53.160> you're<00:02:53.310> out
