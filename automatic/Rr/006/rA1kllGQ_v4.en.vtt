00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.520
 Braga was in SÃ£o Miguel with 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.859
 several players on the main team with 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.380
 highlight for paulo caesar there in front 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.870
 of the team did everything to escape 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.150
 to the penultimate place but was the saint 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.090
 clearly mark the first pass 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:23.029
 porcellis leaves the defense standing and 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.029
 platini shoots for the usa 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:29.640
 in the first part the panty could not 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.250
 finding the way of the goal tried to 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.440
 far but without great aim and when the 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.280
 aim was scared was there 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.280
 Hi, godfather. 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:43.260
 I thought I 'd set the game back on the 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.020
 santa clara midfield on one of the 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.989
 best plays does not make the second by 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.030
 very little even before the interval uses 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.910
 climb at night are playing with 10 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:57.110
 pacheco see the direct red in this 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.110
 back entrance 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.619
 in the second part to play with one more 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:07.320
 Braga picks up the game and does not score much 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:10.670
 here is little paulo caesar to make a 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.670
 bluesman themed 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.190
 Santa clara just wanted to play 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:18.780
 minute 20 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:21.600
 the little platini is do not make the world by 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:25.290
 braga continued to send the goal over 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:31.050
 even for appearing minute 28 jose luis 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:33.600
 in the small area makes the time pass to the 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:36.179
 At the end of the game the braga could have 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:40.100
 result but again the lack of 

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:40.100
 aim was glaring 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:46.140
 for me it's more than a point for me 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.310
 three points really benefit the three 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.440
 points because they asked him why 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:54.119
 worked 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:55.440
 I can say that we were the best team of 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.360
 We are all playing as a team. 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.460
 a great team and enhanced 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.069
 that's what I think they played in the 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.320
 companies in the champeons law and that 

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:05.909
 really understand is to add more 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.810
 quality of this team 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:11.250
 during the show is on again 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.410
 I wanted to reaffirm that there is a large group 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.780
 which features that works a lot today 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.299
 they took their hands and it was only a pity that we 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:23.160
 achieved the three points that we will have 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:25.200
 goal situations the game at a disadvantage 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.980
 number us 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:33.540
 since 2006 the ball the presentation with the 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:36.660
 another field game the ball in the bottom of the 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:41.480
 Another goal was eventually fired for 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:44.609
 our defense but after this great 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.170
 during that first minute of the game 

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:48.900
 we have two situations of that moment 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:52.370
 it was not here where we had two 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.370
 good situations to score
