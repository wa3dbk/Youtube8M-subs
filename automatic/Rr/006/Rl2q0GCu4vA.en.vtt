00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.520 

and<00:03:15.730> before<00:03:16.060> you<00:03:16.330> just<00:03:16.510> press<00:03:16.810> this<00:03:17.020> button<00:03:17.260> in

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
and before you just press this button in

and before you just press this button in
and<00:03:18.130> pull<00:03:18.940> this<00:03:19.320> and<00:03:20.320> the<00:03:20.620> case<00:03:20.890> slides<00:03:21.610> off

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.090 

these<00:03:27.730> came<00:03:28.120> with<00:03:28.150> four<00:03:29.050> gigs<00:03:29.320> of<00:03:29.500> RAM<00:03:29.710> and

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100 
these came with four gigs of RAM and

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.590 
these came with four gigs of RAM and
then<00:03:30.280> I'm<00:03:30.400> going<00:03:30.580> to<00:03:30.640> throw<00:03:30.850> another<00:03:31.030> four<00:03:31.360> gig

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:31.600 
then I'm going to throw another four gig

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.510 
then I'm going to throw another four gig
chip<00:03:31.900> in<00:03:32.050> there<00:03:32.200> to<00:03:32.320> get<00:03:32.440> us<00:03:32.560> up<00:03:32.680> okay<00:03:32.950> so<00:03:33.220> we

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:33.520 
chip in there to get us up okay so we

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.180 
chip in there to get us up okay so we
got<00:03:33.670> some<00:03:33.700> Kingston<00:03:34.300> memory<00:03:34.630> for<00:03:34.810> this<00:03:35.160> for<00:03:36.160> a

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
got some Kingston memory for this for a

what<00:03:45.350> you<00:03:45.470> can't<00:03:45.710> see<00:03:45.800> is<00:03:46.190> that<00:03:46.370> I'm

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:46.490 
what you can't see is that I'm

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:48.580 
what you can't see is that I'm
physically<00:03:47.480> touching<00:03:47.960> the<00:03:48.050> case<00:03:48.260> right<00:03:48.560> now

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:54.740 
static charge through here I don't think

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:59.230 
static charge through here I don't think
I<00:03:54.920> can<00:03:55.100> do<00:03:55.190> this<00:03:55.310> one-handed<00:03:56.920> we've<00:03:57.920> got<00:03:58.240> the

I've<00:04:42.520> been<00:04:42.550> doing<00:04:42.909> this<00:04:43.060> I've<00:04:43.270> had<00:04:43.590> my<00:04:44.590> arm

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:45.389 
I've been doing this I've had my arm

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:49.260 
I've been doing this I've had my arm
touching<00:04:46.389> the<00:04:47.169> case<00:04:47.830> to<00:04:48.069> keep<00:04:48.220> grounded<00:04:48.729> you

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270 
touching the case to keep grounded you

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:51.360 
touching the case to keep grounded you
can<00:04:49.419> also<00:04:49.569> use<00:04:49.900> one<00:04:50.169> of<00:04:50.199> the<00:04:50.409> wrist<00:04:51.039> straps

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 
can also use one of the wrist straps

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.820 
can also use one of the wrist straps
with<00:04:51.699> a<00:04:52.030> clip<00:04:52.659> but<00:04:52.930> I<00:04:52.990> find<00:04:53.229> that<00:04:53.289> awkward<00:04:53.710> I'd

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830 
with a clip but I find that awkward I'd

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.460 
with a clip but I find that awkward I'd
rather<00:04:54.009> just<00:04:54.729> keep<00:04:54.909> a<00:04:55.090> body<00:04:55.300> part<00:04:55.629> touching

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:56.470 
rather just keep a body part touching

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:57.960 
rather just keep a body part touching
the<00:04:56.560> case<00:04:56.770> so<00:04:57.099> that<00:04:57.129> I<00:04:57.280> stay<00:04:57.340> grounded<00:04:57.639> that

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:57.970 
the case so that I stay grounded that

with<00:05:48.919> a<00:05:48.949> little<00:05:49.099> bit<00:05:49.249> of<00:05:49.399> force<00:05:49.639> that<00:05:49.849> think

00:05:50.019 --> 00:05:50.029 
with a little bit of force that think

00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:51.579 
with a little bit of force that think
I'm<00:05:50.179> very<00:05:50.360> doubtful<00:05:50.809> so<00:05:50.990> be<00:05:51.139> careful<00:05:51.499> with

00:05:51.579 --> 00:05:51.589 
I'm very doubtful so be careful with

00:05:51.589 --> 00:05:55.299 
I'm very doubtful so be careful with
those<00:05:51.800> and<00:05:52.360> this<00:05:53.360> one<00:05:53.539> is<00:05:53.830> DisplayPort<00:05:54.830> to<00:05:54.860> VGA

00:05:55.299 --> 00:05:55.309 
those and this one is DisplayPort to VGA

00:05:55.309 --> 00:05:58.480 
those and this one is DisplayPort to VGA
you<00:05:55.399> can<00:05:55.699> get<00:05:55.819> DisplayPort<00:05:56.449> to<00:05:56.569> DVI<00:05:57.490> and

00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:58.490 
you can get DisplayPort to DVI and

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:00.070 
you can get DisplayPort to DVI and
probably<00:05:58.879> the<00:05:58.999> HDMI<00:05:59.449> to<00:05:59.509> I<00:05:59.659> haven't<00:05:59.869> bothered

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:00.080 
probably the HDMI to I haven't bothered

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.889 
probably the HDMI to I haven't bothered
checking<00:06:00.649> into<00:06:00.800> that<00:06:00.949> or<00:06:01.129> not<00:06:01.719> but<00:06:02.719> I'm<00:06:02.869> sure

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:02.899 
checking into that or not but I'm sure

00:06:02.899 --> 00:06:05.230 
checking into that or not but I'm sure
you<00:06:03.199> can<00:06:03.409> probably<00:06:03.529> get<00:06:03.860> that<00:06:04.069> as<00:06:04.219> well<00:06:04.249> it's

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:05.240 
you can probably get that as well it's

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.480 
you can probably get that as well it's
just<00:06:05.330> an<00:06:05.990> extra<00:06:06.349> expense<00:06:06.589> when<00:06:06.979> you<00:06:07.069> buy<00:06:07.219> in

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:07.490 
just an extra expense when you buy in

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:29.600 
into the USB to of ports this machine

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:31.240 
into the USB to of ports this machine
will<00:06:29.750> have<00:06:29.870> two<00:06:30.110> monitors<00:06:30.350> connected<00:06:31.040> to<00:06:31.160> it

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:31.250 
will have two monitors connected to it

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:33.700 
will have two monitors connected to it
this<00:06:31.340> will<00:06:31.610> run<00:06:31.850> two<00:06:32.150> monitors<00:06:32.510> you<00:06:33.470> can<00:06:33.500> do

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:33.710 
this will run two monitors you can do

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:38.180 
Google Display with this system so when

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:39.970 
Google Display with this system so when
this<00:06:38.270> gets<00:06:38.450> to<00:06:38.600> the<00:06:38.810> clients<00:06:39.410> desk<00:06:39.620> it<00:06:39.800> will

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:39.980 
this gets to the clients desk it will

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:41.440 
this gets to the clients desk it will
have<00:06:40.160> two<00:06:40.430> monitors<00:06:40.610> on<00:06:40.970> it<00:06:41.090> so<00:06:41.180> that's<00:06:41.300> why

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:41.450 
have two monitors on it so that's why

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:44.200 
have two monitors on it so that's why
I'm<00:06:41.800> connecting<00:06:42.800> up<00:06:42.890> here<00:06:43.070> and<00:06:43.370> get<00:06:44.060> this

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:44.210

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:07.660 

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:11.190 

it<00:07:08.200> is<00:07:08.350> only<00:07:08.560> at<00:07:08.740> core<00:07:08.980> i3<00:07:09.100> processor<00:07:10.200> this

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:11.200 
it is only at core i3 processor this
