I'm gonna integrate that permaculture

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.120 
I'm gonna integrate that permaculture
design<00:01:51.240> I<00:01:51.479> need<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:51.810> know<00:01:51.990> what<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:52.799> land<00:01:52.979> is

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
design I need to know what the land is
