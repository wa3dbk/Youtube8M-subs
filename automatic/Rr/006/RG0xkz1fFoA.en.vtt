00:00:00.879 --> 00:00:03.850
 after we connected 

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:05.430
 cable 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.410
 interface cable 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.750
 and someone just mudis buying the same 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.999
 way hooked whose children did not bring 

00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:15.259
 we need to move 

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:17.380
 connect power to these devices and 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:18.759
 system board 

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:21.060
 and about sit drive 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.640
 why would I not separately 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.539
 consider because it connects to 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.470
 just like a hard drive 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.910
 that is, and if sapato is just cable 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.590
 connect his porch walls page 1 who 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.260
 watching telematics and plugging hard 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:36.480
 the disc does not give 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.129
 either it is at 1 km 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.129
 hard drive to another drive cable 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.080
 so we do not go to the power connection 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.570
 everyone immediately understand that cues 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.570
 love so much 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:54.670
 and start from this biggest 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.580
 cable it should be 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:57.980
 connected 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.610
 google corporation 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:01.600
 on the motherboard 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.080
 this time im 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.020
 this case it is located here on 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.410
 gasoline 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.940
 This cable has this snap 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:12.940
 then latch 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:14.210
 which allows 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.590
 extract interviews and infected 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.110
 you need to look at your Russians 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.230
 on the motherboard 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:21.770
 which side 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.610
 located 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.400
 made latches 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.030
 let's say 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.370
 side marks yes 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.060
 and fast 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.460
 here there is even if I foresee 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.620
 all the same it will not be therefore 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.710
 you will have in each case 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.860
 watch what country do you have 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.940
 on exploration and made for payment 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:44.270
 due to 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.520
 it is on one side and 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:47.970
 massacred 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.300
 but he is a commodity country 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.250
 so the latch 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.130
 I will have 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.460
 on the first page and in this way 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.460
 just take not connect 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.630
 Here I put the connector in it to give no 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.630
 we press 

00:02:11.889 --> 00:02:13.989
 the click happened to turn out that at the expense of 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:15.629
 worked when now 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:17.790
 you can't just get it 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:18.580
 entrenched 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.919
 that is, everything is fine 

00:02:20.919 --> 00:02:21.949
 so now 

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:23.999
 we only need to connect 

00:02:23.999 --> 00:02:25.699
 but neither hard drive 

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:28.849
 philip dick drive 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:32.269
 regards to hard drives here again 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:35.449
 there are 2 power supplies 

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:38.169
 type of connectors 

00:02:38.169 --> 00:02:40.079
 that is, here is a classic connector 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:41.859
 give unwrapped 

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:44.649
 food it is also used in disks 

00:02:44.649 --> 00:02:47.159
 Tagy standard yes do not sit shelters 

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:48.999
 people that is to say 

00:02:48.999 --> 00:02:50.609
 such a wide cabinet 

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:53.159
 if you use sugar 

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:55.480
 you will need to take advantage of this 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.480
 black thin 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:00.939
 In this case, I would use such 

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:02.129
 cable 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:03.829
 there is 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:05.219
 she is needed 

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:06.150
 to establish 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.599
 its correct 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:09.700
 See if we look at it. 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.699
 cable at court 

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:13.589
 it can be seen that alone 

00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:16.159
 countries yes he was killed cut off 

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:17.109
 that's the year 

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:18.269
 a loan 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:19.680
 for the country they are 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.910
 direct this case for a long time target 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.379
 indirect explanations 

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:25.509
 cut off 

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:26.930
 so here it is 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.259
 a kind of pledge or access key 1 

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:32.289
 not put the opposite of their employment is not 

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:33.349
 burned out 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:34.439
 but 

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:36.059
 Yet there are times when the cable 

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:37.469
 connect the opposite 

00:03:37.469 --> 00:03:40.219
 that is, as we all know, they sawn 

00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:42.599
 therefore do not help 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:45.029
 in our case 

00:03:45.029 --> 00:03:47.009
 need to watch g 

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:49.389
 Well, of course if you immediately see confused 

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:51.189
 cut corners on the run 

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:53.919
 food in Russian drives yes it leaves 

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:56.449
 compare with this money 

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:59.769
 power cable is excellent law 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:01.819
 so if you 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:03.719
 put it like that wrong yes he 

00:04:03.719 --> 00:04:05.979
 It seems immediately like yes yes he does not go 

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:07.959
 I insert the connector 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:09.869
 so give me 

00:04:09.869 --> 00:04:11.079
 strength 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:12.759
 and flip it just yes and 

00:04:12.759 --> 00:04:15.729
 try it should go easy 

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:18.489
 and after he went already you can on 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:19.209
 him 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:21.829
 need to see him go to the end 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:22.960
 all the same 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.389
 Biysku Patrushev 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:27.389
 also connect the power supply 

00:04:29.309 --> 00:04:32.309
 so our arctic sentence 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.289
 food why so 

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:37.819
 so go ahead 

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:40.110
 so here are the rights to which I am here 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.249
 I have on Putin yes now we are with them 

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:43.849
 do nothing 

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:45.740
 we will distribute them later 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:47.419
 just like that now just let them 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:48.580
 lie here 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.360
 and now our task and connect 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.270
 nutrition 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:55.060
 another power pay system 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.129
 CPU power 

00:04:57.129 --> 00:04:59.620
 This is how it looks 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.749
 this cable 

00:05:02.749 --> 00:05:04.909
 Here is a 4 contact yes 

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:06.789
 for 8 contacts 

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:09.180
 it all depends on the model 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.029
 your and motherboard 

00:05:12.029 --> 00:05:13.490
 you need to look 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:15.069
 on the connector 

00:05:15.069 --> 00:05:17.059
 which is located 

00:05:17.059 --> 00:05:19.539
 about processors 

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:21.479
 in this case 

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:23.539
 here it is this time on my system 

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:25.199
 boards that is this food of the year 

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:27.809
 CPU 

00:05:27.809 --> 00:05:30.120
 if you have a motherboard 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.430
 As in this case, 4 contacts means you need 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:34.430
 use this yes that is where 4 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:36.729
 contacts if you have 8 contacts there 

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:38.110
 use this 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:40.349
 but since in my case 4 contacts 

00:05:40.349 --> 00:05:40.979
 Doll 

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:43.139
 uses we will this one 

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:46.460
 here the percentage started by yes here for sure 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:48.009
 just like three months 

00:05:48.009 --> 00:05:49.869
 in this big cable for power 

00:05:49.869 --> 00:05:51.479
 motherboards that is on the one hand 

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:54.479
 connector available for at the expense of 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:58.800
 but here everything will be more or less visible 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.580
 here he is 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:02.499
 this exhibition 

00:06:02.499 --> 00:06:05.039
 latch brawl 

00:06:05.039 --> 00:06:07.469
 so sure to go your own way 

00:06:07.469 --> 00:06:10.400
 latch in that direction where there will be a blow that is 

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.790
 if we have a ledge in this country, then 

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:14.460
 the latch should be aimed at this 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:16.069
 the side 

00:06:16.069 --> 00:06:19.520
 very easy to insert 

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.499
 so we will deliver 

00:06:21.499 --> 00:06:24.849
 and the image of mm length pressure darling 

00:06:24.849 --> 00:06:26.610
 all about what happened how to be 

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:27.939
 connected 

00:06:27.939 --> 00:06:29.719
 everything on this connection 

00:06:29.719 --> 00:06:31.339
 food with us 

00:06:31.339 --> 00:06:33.129
 it is over now left 

00:06:33.129 --> 00:06:34.919
 only the final stage of assembly
