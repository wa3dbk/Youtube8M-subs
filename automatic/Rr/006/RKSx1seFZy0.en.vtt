00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:18.210 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:20.629 

still<00:05:18.960> on<00:05:19.139> the<00:05:19.350> oh<00:05:19.560> wait<00:05:19.889> no<00:05:20.069> this<00:05:20.220> is<00:05:20.370> a<00:05:20.400> third

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:20.639 
still on the oh wait no this is a third

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:27.980 
still on the oh wait no this is a third
floor<00:05:21.139> ok<00:05:22.139> we're<00:05:22.560> OK<00:05:22.590> to<00:05:23.580> choke<00:05:24.860> yeah<00:05:26.990> getting

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:27.990 
floor ok we're OK to choke yeah getting

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:35.660 
floor ok we're OK to choke yeah getting
it<00:05:28.229> Oh

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:35.670 

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:38.370 

so<00:05:36.670> this<00:05:37.060> is<00:05:37.240> the<00:05:37.330> fourth<00:05:37.570> floor<00:05:37.780> and<00:05:38.080> this<00:05:38.200> is

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:38.380 
so this is the fourth floor and this is

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:39.660 
so this is the fourth floor and this is
I<00:05:38.560> guess<00:05:38.740> this<00:05:38.950> is<00:05:39.040> where<00:05:39.130> we're<00:05:39.310> supposed<00:05:39.610> to

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:39.670 
I guess this is where we're supposed to

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:43.560 
I guess this is where we're supposed to
get<00:05:39.820> the<00:05:39.940> thing<00:05:41.310> more<00:05:42.310> confident<00:05:43.060> that<00:05:43.240> you're

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:43.570 
get the thing more confident that you're

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:45.150 
get the thing more confident that you're
supposed<00:05:43.900> to<00:05:44.050> get<00:05:44.200> something<00:05:44.530> because<00:05:45.130> a

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:45.160 
supposed to get something because a

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:47.610 
supposed to get something because a
little<00:05:45.400> thing<00:05:45.520> showed<00:05:45.970> up<00:05:46.200> right<00:05:47.200> when<00:05:47.260> we<00:05:47.500> hit

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:47.620 
little thing showed up right when we hit

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:49.650 
little thing showed up right when we hit
the<00:05:47.740> floor<00:05:48.040> so<00:05:48.460> that<00:05:48.760> didn't<00:05:49.240> happen<00:05:49.480> last

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:49.660 
the floor so that didn't happen last

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:51.180 
the floor so that didn't happen last
time<00:05:49.930> so<00:05:50.200> I'm<00:05:50.320> guessing<00:05:50.500> that's<00:05:50.740> what<00:05:51.040> we're

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:51.190 
time so I'm guessing that's what we're

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:53.340 
time so I'm guessing that's what we're
supposed<00:05:51.490> to<00:05:51.520> do<00:05:51.640> this<00:05:51.850> time<00:05:52.150> come<00:05:52.540> on<00:05:52.690> get<00:05:53.230> it
