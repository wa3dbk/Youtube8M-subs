so<00:00:48.000> let's<00:00:48.360> check<00:00:48.600> on<00:00:48.719> our<00:00:48.750> mixture<00:00:49.170> you<00:00:49.829> can

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
so let's check on our mixture you can

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.189 
so let's check on our mixture you can
see<00:00:50.309> it's<00:00:50.700> starting<00:00:51.090> to<00:00:51.360> boil<00:00:51.539> and<00:00:51.870> it<00:00:51.930> still

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
see it's starting to boil and it still

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.560 
see it's starting to boil and it still
has<00:00:52.350> that<00:00:52.379> beautiful<00:00:52.649> red<00:00:53.100> color<00:00:53.520> for<00:00:54.480> the

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
has that beautiful red color for the

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.430 
has that beautiful red color for the
candy<00:00:54.930> apples<00:00:55.160> it's<00:00:56.160> not<00:00:56.579> even<00:00:56.789> to<00:00:57.329> 250<00:00:58.079> so<00:00:58.289> we

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
candy apples it's not even to 250 so we

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.799 
candy apples it's not even to 250 so we
still<00:00:58.680> have<00:00:58.890> some<00:00:59.190> time<00:00:59.539> okay<00:01:00.539> so<00:01:00.600> your

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
still have some time okay so your

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.540 
still have some time okay so your
mixture<00:01:01.140> is<00:01:01.199> going<00:01:01.350> to<00:01:01.410> take<00:01:01.559> about<00:01:01.680> 20<00:01:02.129> to<00:01:02.250> 25

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
mixture is going to take about 20 to 25

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.310 
mixture is going to take about 20 to 25
minutes<00:01:02.699> to<00:01:03.180> get<00:01:03.359> to<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.660> desired

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
minutes to get to the desired

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.890 
minutes to get to the desired
temperature<00:01:04.650> at<00:01:04.890> 310<00:01:05.640> degrees<00:01:05.820> so<00:01:06.630> at<00:01:06.780> that

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
temperature at 310 degrees so at that

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.719 
temperature at 310 degrees so at that
point<00:01:06.960> you<00:01:07.350> can<00:01:07.590> go<00:01:07.770> ahead<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:07.979> prep<00:01:08.520> the

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
point you can go ahead and prep the

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.789 
point you can go ahead and prep the
apples<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.390> what<00:01:09.780> I'm<00:01:09.900> going<00:01:09.930> to<00:01:10.229> do<00:01:10.439> is<00:01:10.740> just

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
apples and what I'm going to do is just

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.550 
apples and what I'm going to do is just
use<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.670> skewers<00:01:12.119> that<00:01:12.479> have<00:01:12.630> these<00:01:12.900> laying

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
use the skewers that have these laying

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.950 
use the skewers that have these laying
around<00:01:13.680> my<00:01:13.890> house<00:01:14.270> they're<00:01:15.270> just<00:01:15.299> barbecue

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
around my house they're just barbecue

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.899 
around my house they're just barbecue
skewers<00:01:16.409> and<00:01:16.439> they<00:01:16.979> have<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.159> nice<00:01:17.340> pointy<00:01:17.700> tip

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
skewers and they have a nice pointy tip

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.550 
skewers and they have a nice pointy tip
so<00:01:18.090> it<00:01:18.210> actually<00:01:18.360> goes<00:01:18.720> into<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.080> Apple<00:01:19.380> quite

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
so it actually goes into the Apple quite

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.800 
so it actually goes into the Apple quite
easily<00:01:20.009> and<00:01:20.520> then<00:01:20.640> I'm<00:01:20.759> going<00:01:20.880> to<00:01:20.939> cut<00:01:21.240> off<00:01:21.509> the

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
easily and then I'm going to cut off the

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.170 
easily and then I'm going to cut off the
ends<00:01:22.430> stick<00:01:23.430> it<00:01:23.580> in

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.990 

like<00:01:28.180> that<00:01:28.920> it's<00:01:29.920> nice<00:01:30.070> and<00:01:30.250> sturdy<00:01:30.580> I've

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
like that it's nice and sturdy I've

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.590 
like that it's nice and sturdy I've
tried<00:01:31.330> to<00:01:31.720> take<00:01:32.140> off<00:01:32.320> the<00:01:32.619> wax<00:01:33.180> residue<00:01:34.180> so

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 
tried to take off the wax residue so

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.780 
tried to take off the wax residue so
that<00:01:34.750> the<00:01:34.900> candy<00:01:35.350> will<00:01:35.710> code<00:01:35.979> it<00:01:36.159> better<00:01:36.400> I

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 
that the candy will code it better I

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.410 
that the candy will code it better I
used<00:01:37.360> a<00:01:37.600> fruit<00:01:38.170> spray<00:01:38.470> that<00:01:38.710> removes<00:01:39.130> wax<00:01:39.430> take
