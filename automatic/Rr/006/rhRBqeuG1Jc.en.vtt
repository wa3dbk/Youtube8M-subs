hi my name is Mary Poppins and I'm an
adjunct<00:00:07.170> professor<00:00:07.410> of<00:00:07.799> biology<00:00:07.980> and<00:00:08.519> today

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
adjunct professor of biology and today

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.879 
adjunct professor of biology and today
we're<00:00:09.450> going<00:00:09.570> to<00:00:09.690> talk<00:00:09.840> about<00:00:09.990> threats<00:00:10.679> to

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
we're going to talk about threats to

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.910 
we're going to talk about threats to
biodiversity<00:00:11.219> now<00:00:12.290> biodiversity<00:00:13.290> just<00:00:13.679> so<00:00:13.799> we

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
biodiversity now biodiversity just so we

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.499 
biodiversity now biodiversity just so we
all<00:00:14.040> have<00:00:14.190> a<00:00:14.219> good<00:00:14.400> working<00:00:14.759> definition<00:00:14.880> is

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
all have a good working definition is

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.630 
all have a good working definition is
the<00:00:15.929> differences<00:00:16.560> in<00:00:16.770> life<00:00:16.980> we<00:00:17.279> find<00:00:17.490> around

our population continues to skyrocket we

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.570 
our population continues to skyrocket we
need<00:01:24.119> more<00:01:24.390> resources<00:01:24.810> and<00:01:25.290> more<00:01:25.350> space<00:01:26.130> to

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.399 
need more resources and more space to
accommodate<00:01:27.210> all<00:01:27.390> these<00:01:27.570> billions<00:01:27.810> of<00:01:28.020> people

and when that happens plants and animals

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.929 
and when that happens plants and animals
they<00:01:31.860> are<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.100> ones<00:01:32.280> that<00:01:32.400> have<00:01:32.490> no<00:01:32.549> moves<00:01:32.759> out

well we get pollution in the air in our

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.230 
well we get pollution in the air in our
water<00:01:42.930> even<00:01:43.710> in<00:01:43.829> our<00:01:43.950> soil<00:01:44.280> all<00:01:44.640> this

water even in our soil all this

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.639 
water even in our soil all this
pollution<00:01:45.570> comes<00:01:45.960> from<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.380> different

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
pollution comes from the different

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:47.960 
pollution comes from the different

over<00:01:53.759> expectation<00:01:54.420> is<00:01:54.630> taking<00:01:55.079> too<00:01:55.290> much<00:01:55.470> from

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
over expectation is taking too much from

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.219 
over expectation is taking too much from
the<00:01:55.829> environment<00:01:56.280> taking<00:01:56.759> too<00:01:57.210> much<00:01:57.450> fish<00:01:57.810> or

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
the environment taking too much fish or

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.289 
the environment taking too much fish or
taking<00:01:58.590> too<00:01:58.890> much<00:01:59.189> resources<00:01:59.549> from<00:01:59.939> the<00:02:00.060> land

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
taking too much resources from the land

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.929 
taking too much resources from the land
and<00:02:00.570> this<00:02:01.020> is<00:02:01.200> causing<00:02:01.409> a<00:02:01.619> big<00:02:01.649> problem<00:02:02.250> here

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
and this is causing a big problem here

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.969 
and this is causing a big problem here
on<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.180> planet<00:02:03.540> we<00:02:03.840> have<00:02:03.990> finite<00:02:04.469> resources

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
and these finite resources there's only

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.070
