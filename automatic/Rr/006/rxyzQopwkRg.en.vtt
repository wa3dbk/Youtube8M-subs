00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:41.780 
review of it so as you can see or you

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.729 
review of it so as you can see or you
may<00:00:42.780> be<00:00:42.840> able<00:00:42.989> to<00:00:43.110> see<00:00:43.260> along<00:00:43.440> here<00:00:43.500> there<00:00:44.430> are

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:45.739 
may be able to see along here there are

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:49.400 
may be able to see along here there are
it<00:00:46.739> is<00:00:46.800> seven<00:00:47.750> plywood<00:00:48.750> I<00:00:48.780> think<00:00:49.110> so<00:00:49.230> that's

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
it is seven plywood I think so that's

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.610 
it is seven plywood I think so that's
seven<00:00:50.030> separate<00:00:51.030> bits<00:00:51.210> of<00:00:51.390> wood<00:00:51.620> squished

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
seven separate bits of wood squished

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.479 
seven separate bits of wood squished
together<00:00:52.829> with<00:00:53.100> two<00:00:53.370> big<00:00:54.500> circles<00:00:55.500> of<00:00:56.039> carbon

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
together with two big circles of carbon

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.729 
together with two big circles of carbon
fiber<00:00:57.170> around<00:00:58.520> here<00:00:59.660> so<00:01:00.660> around<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.260> bolts

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
fiber around here so around the bolts

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.969 
fiber around here so around the bolts
and<00:01:02.629> at<00:01:03.629> either<00:01:03.840> side<00:01:04.170> there's<00:01:04.559> two<00:01:04.769> big

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
and at either side there's two big

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.149 
and at either side there's two big
circles<00:01:05.220> here<00:01:05.700> ovals<00:01:06.330> here<00:01:06.689> and<00:01:06.840> here<00:01:07.140> but<00:01:08.100> you

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
circles here ovals here and here but you

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.789 
circles here ovals here and here but you
take<00:01:08.280> up<00:01:08.460> most<00:01:08.580> of<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:08.880> board<00:01:09.360> so<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.409> inside

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
take up most of the board so the inside

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.469 
take up most of the board so the inside
which<00:01:11.460> basically<00:01:11.729> gives<00:01:11.850> it<00:01:12.119> much<00:01:12.270> more

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
which basically gives it much more

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:18.679 
which basically gives it much more
strength<00:01:14.570> it<00:01:15.570> has<00:01:16.140> a<00:01:16.170> very<00:01:16.830> very<00:01:17.430> deep<00:01:18.030> concave

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
strength it has a very very deep concave

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.810 
strength it has a very very deep concave
you<00:01:18.990> might<00:01:19.229> not<00:01:19.500> be<00:01:19.740> able<00:01:19.830> to<00:01:20.009> see<00:01:20.340> it<00:01:20.460> through

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
you might not be able to see it through

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.330 
you might not be able to see it through
this<00:01:21.000> but<00:01:21.900> believe<00:01:22.170> me<00:01:22.200> it's<00:01:22.500> really<00:01:23.159> good

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
this but believe me it's really good

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:31.010 
this but believe me it's really good
it's<00:01:23.640> got<00:01:23.939> a<00:01:23.970> huge<00:01:24.780> pop<00:01:26.180> and<00:01:28.790> it's<00:01:29.790> just<00:01:30.030> pretty

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020
