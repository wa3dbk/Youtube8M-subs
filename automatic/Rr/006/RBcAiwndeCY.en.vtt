make a strong pot bet here now and then

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.770 
make a strong pot bet here now and then
the<00:01:26.270> button<00:01:26.680> smooth<00:01:27.680> calls<00:01:28.070> he<00:01:28.340> has<00:01:28.460> 221<00:01:29.120> pods

the button smooth calls he has 221 pods
I<00:01:29.960> guess<00:01:30.170> then<00:01:30.979> the<00:01:31.159> original<00:01:31.610> early<00:01:31.909> position

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
I guess then the original early position

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:33.969 
I guess then the original early position
razor<00:01:32.540> I<00:01:32.720> guess<00:01:32.990> he<00:01:33.170> just<00:01:33.200> boughs<00:01:33.710> out

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
razor I guess he just boughs out

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:35.620 
razor I guess he just boughs out
something<00:01:34.549> like<00:01:34.670> ace<00:01:34.850> queen<00:01:35.180> or<00:01:35.360> a<00:01:35.390> little

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
something like ace queen or a little

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.180 
something like ace queen or a little
pair<00:01:35.810> or<00:01:35.930> something<00:01:36.170> like<00:01:36.229> that<00:01:36.290> whatever<00:01:37.040> he

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:37.190 
pair or something like that whatever he

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.719 
pair or something like that whatever he
had<00:01:37.900> ok<00:01:38.900> so<00:01:38.960> the<00:01:39.140> plots<00:01:39.320> more<00:01:39.530> than<00:01:39.680> 1,500<00:01:40.549> now

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
had ok so the plots more than 1,500 now

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:43.870 
had ok so the plots more than 1,500 now
and<00:01:41.440> looks<00:01:42.440> like<00:01:42.590> a<00:01:42.619> meaningless<00:01:43.100> 6<00:01:43.580> on<00:01:43.760> the

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
and looks like a meaningless 6 on the

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.630 
and looks like a meaningless 6 on the
turn<00:01:44.180> Mike<00:01:44.900> Matusow<00:01:45.320> then<00:01:45.799> decides<00:01:46.130> to<00:01:46.369> shove

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
turn Mike Matusow then decides to shove

turn Mike Matusow then decides to shove
the<00:01:47.000> balance<00:01:47.420> of<00:01:47.510> his<00:01:47.630> 4,600<00:01:48.500> plus<00:01:48.740> stack<00:01:49.190> in

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
the balance of his 4,600 plus stack in

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.480 
the balance of his 4,600 plus stack in
there<00:01:50.290> looking<00:01:51.290> like<00:01:51.350> a<00:01:51.530> defensive<00:01:52.070> move<00:01:52.250> I

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
there looking like a defensive move I

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.840 
there looking like a defensive move I
suppose<00:01:52.880> even<00:01:53.659> though<00:01:54.080> he<00:01:54.650> only<00:01:54.680> has<00:01:55.189> seven

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
suppose even though he only has seven

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:57.550 
suppose even though he only has seven
eight<00:01:56.330> hundred<00:01:56.630> chips<00:01:56.840> in<00:01:56.960> that<00:01:57.080> pot<00:01:57.320> right

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
eight hundred chips in that pot right

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.160 
eight hundred chips in that pot right
now<00:01:57.590> well<00:01:58.549> he<00:01:58.939> pretty<00:01:59.150> much<00:01:59.240> gets<00:01:59.630> insta

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
now well he pretty much gets insta

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.070 
now well he pretty much gets insta

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
called by the big blind and we see why

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.630

that pretty significant flaw pet
personally<00:02:30.319> I<00:02:30.410> would<00:02:30.560> rule<00:02:30.739> out<00:02:30.770> pocket<00:02:31.610> tens

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:31.819 
personally I would rule out pocket tens

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:34.000 
personally I would rule out pocket tens
pocket<00:02:32.300> jacks<00:02:32.510> anything<00:02:32.930> or<00:02:33.170> anything<00:02:33.620> better

pocket jacks anything or anything better

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.910 
pocket jacks anything or anything better
because<00:02:34.430> he<00:02:34.700> would

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
because he would

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.330 
because he would
like<00:02:35.130> Leary<00:02:35.580> raised<00:02:35.940> in<00:02:36.330> position<00:02:36.959> there<00:02:37.340> to

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
like Leary raised in position there to

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:39.890 
like Leary raised in position there to
get<00:02:38.459> heads<00:02:38.700> up<00:02:38.849> with<00:02:39.030> somebody<00:02:39.209> could<00:02:39.720> have

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
get heads up with somebody could have

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.140 
get heads up with somebody could have

called preflop with a lower pair tues
thru<00:02:42.390> sixes<00:02:42.870> but<00:02:43.110> certainly<00:02:43.680> not<00:02:43.890> that<00:02:44.130> flop

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
thru sixes but certainly not that flop

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:48.440 
thru sixes but certainly not that flop
bet<00:02:44.730> so<00:02:45.000> that<00:02:45.599> leaves<00:02:45.870> hands<00:02:46.410> like<00:02:47.150> Jack<00:02:48.150> 10<00:02:48.420> as

queen 10 those all kind of fit into this
story<00:03:08.100> to<00:03:08.340> me<00:03:08.489> so<00:03:08.989> there's<00:03:09.989> a<00:03:10.080> handful<00:03:10.650> of

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
story to me so there's a handful of

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.699 
story to me so there's a handful of
plausible<00:03:11.250> hands<00:03:11.700> Mike's<00:03:12.120> behind<00:03:12.630> here<00:03:13.049> even

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
plausible hands Mike's behind here even

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:15.620 
plausible hands Mike's behind here even
though<00:03:13.890> two<00:03:13.950> pair<00:03:14.459> looks<00:03:14.760> good<00:03:15.120> on<00:03:15.239> the<00:03:15.390> flop

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
though two pair looks good on the flop

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.170 
though two pair looks good on the flop
now<00:03:16.410> I<00:03:16.650> would<00:03:16.980> think<00:03:17.100> a<00:03:17.220> value<00:03:17.670> bet<00:03:17.910> would<00:03:18.120> be

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
now I would think a value bet would be

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.539 
now I would think a value bet would be
more<00:03:18.569> in<00:03:18.750> order<00:03:18.870> here<00:03:19.200> like<00:03:19.380> me<00:03:19.590> like<00:03:20.010> maybe<00:03:20.310> do

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 
more in order here like me like maybe do

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:24.350 
more in order here like me like maybe do
a<00:03:20.580> pot<00:03:20.940> that<00:03:21.600> again<00:03:22.019> of<00:03:22.200> 1500<00:03:22.910> if<00:03:23.910> he<00:03:24.090> flat

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
a pot that again of 1500 if he flat

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.229 
a pot that again of 1500 if he flat
calls<00:03:24.690> that<00:03:24.989> too<00:03:25.410> you<00:03:26.340> know<00:03:26.459> fuck<00:03:26.790> you're<00:03:27.120> in

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
calls that too you know fuck you're in

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.059 
calls that too you know fuck you're in
trouble<00:03:27.540> here<00:03:27.870> even<00:03:28.200> when<00:03:28.319> that<00:03:28.500> brick<00:03:28.830> comes

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:29.069 
trouble here even when that brick comes

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:32.780 
trouble here even when that brick comes
on<00:03:29.220> the<00:03:29.340> river<00:03:29.549> you<00:03:29.760> got<00:03:30.030> to<00:03:30.209> think<00:03:31.130> you're<00:03:32.130> 98

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
on the river you got to think you're 98

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.420 
on the river you got to think you're 98
is<00:03:33.030> pretty<00:03:33.569> marginal<00:03:33.989> now<00:03:34.400> personally<00:03:35.400> I

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
is pretty marginal now personally I

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:36.979 
is pretty marginal now personally I
think<00:03:35.580> there's<00:03:35.970> other<00:03:36.090> ways<00:03:36.269> to<00:03:36.330> go<00:03:36.600> here<00:03:36.840> then

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
think there's other ways to go here then

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:38.840 
think there's other ways to go here then
shoving<00:03:37.319> on<00:03:37.530> the<00:03:37.650> turn<00:03:37.830> because<00:03:38.190> you<00:03:38.730> know<00:03:38.819> I

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
shoving on the turn because you know I

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:40.340 
shoving on the turn because you know I
just<00:03:39.000> don't<00:03:39.329> think<00:03:39.510> that<00:03:39.570> opponent<00:03:40.109> is<00:03:40.170> going

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
just don't think that opponent is going

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.050 
just don't think that opponent is going
to<00:03:40.410> call<00:03:40.590> with<00:03:40.739> an<00:03:40.829> ace<00:03:40.950> jack<00:03:41.220> or<00:03:41.430> a<00:03:41.459> king<00:03:41.730> jack

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
to call with an ace jack or a king jack

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.530 
to call with an ace jack or a king jack

to that massive over bed with a pot bat

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.650 
to that massive over bed with a pot bat
then<00:03:46.350> my<00:03:47.070> can<00:03:47.280> check<00:03:47.489> the<00:03:47.640> river<00:03:47.850> maybe<00:03:48.239> save

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
then my can check the river maybe save

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.130 
then my can check the river maybe save
