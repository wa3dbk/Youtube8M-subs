00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
and what is so good about this game is

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.330 
and what is so good about this game is
the<00:00:15.929> fact<00:00:16.139> that<00:00:16.199> it<00:00:16.289> has<00:00:16.440> 10<00:00:16.800> kills<00:00:17.100> which

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
the fact that it has 10 kills which

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.939 
the fact that it has 10 kills which
isn't<00:00:17.609> the<00:00:17.699> greatest<00:00:17.910> circus<00:00:18.420> dog<00:00:18.810> aim<00:00:19.020> but<00:00:19.680> it

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949

is team tactical and I think we don't
lose<00:00:23.070> a<00:00:23.130> single<00:00:23.400> round<00:00:23.760> so<00:00:24.119> it's<00:00:24.300> 10<00:00:24.510> kills

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
lose a single round so it's 10 kills

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.769 
lose a single round so it's 10 kills
four<00:00:25.080> rounds<00:00:25.560> and<00:00:25.740> team<00:00:26.250> tac<00:00:26.510> using<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.570> peep

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779

I<00:02:23.940> actually<00:02:24.060> wanted<00:02:24.360> to<00:02:24.450> do<00:02:24.599> just<00:02:24.870> to<00:02:24.959> say<00:02:25.110> that

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
I actually wanted to do just to say that

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.539 
I actually wanted to do just to say that
I<00:02:25.290> played<00:02:25.530> it<00:02:25.650> model<00:02:25.920> for<00:02:26.099> three<00:02:26.250> more<00:02:26.400> than

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:26.549 
I played it model for three more than

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:29.270 
I played it model for three more than
black<00:02:26.790> ops<00:02:27.110> just<00:02:28.110> like<00:02:28.260> us<00:02:28.409> Emma<00:02:28.739> doesn't

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
black ops just like us Emma doesn't

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.800 
black ops just like us Emma doesn't
really<00:02:29.519> mean<00:02:29.730> much<00:02:29.760> I<00:02:30.299> just<00:02:30.510> thought<00:02:30.659> it'd<00:02:30.750> be

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
really mean much I just thought it'd be

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.970 
really mean much I just thought it'd be
cool<00:02:30.900> to<00:02:31.170> have<00:02:31.470> more<00:02:31.829> on<00:02:32.099> the<00:02:32.310> following<00:02:33.120> game

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
cool to have more on the following game

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.170 
cool to have more on the following game
but<00:02:34.980> i'm<00:02:35.220> not<00:02:35.370> sure<00:02:35.430> if<00:02:35.760> that's<00:02:35.909> gonna<00:02:36.090> happen

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
but i'm not sure if that's gonna happen

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.030 
but i'm not sure if that's gonna happen
though<00:02:36.720> just<00:02:37.019> because<00:02:37.140> i<00:02:37.560> kind<00:02:37.709> of<00:02:37.799> want<00:02:37.980> to

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
though just because i kind of want to

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.160 
though just because i kind of want to
play<00:02:38.190> different<00:02:38.519> games<00:02:38.659> but<00:02:39.659> this<00:02:39.840> doesn't

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
play different games but this doesn't

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.750 
play different games but this doesn't
mean<00:02:40.230> that<00:02:40.440> i'm<00:02:40.709> gonna<00:02:40.890> stop<00:02:41.220> uploading<00:02:41.549> them

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
mean that i'm gonna stop uploading them

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.009 
mean that i'm gonna stop uploading them
that'd<00:02:41.910> be<00:02:42.000> 3<00:02:42.209> i'll<00:02:42.329> probably<00:02:42.690> still

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
that'd be 3 i'll probably still

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:44.750 
that'd be 3 i'll probably still
primarily<00:02:43.290> be<00:02:43.680> uploading<00:02:44.129> model<00:02:44.400> for<00:02:44.549> three

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
primarily be uploading model for three

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.030 
primarily be uploading model for three
just<00:02:45.000> not<00:02:45.150> playing<00:02:45.420> it<00:02:45.599> as<00:02:45.780> much<00:02:46.109> so<00:02:46.650> that's

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
just not playing it as much so that's

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.500 
just not playing it as much so that's
all<00:02:47.160> that<00:02:47.370> really<00:02:47.400> means<00:02:47.879> but<00:02:48.060> you<00:02:48.180> guys<00:02:48.299> won't

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510
