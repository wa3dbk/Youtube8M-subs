and<00:01:45.590> of<00:01:46.590> course<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.460> microphone<00:01:48.000> that<00:01:48.120> I<00:01:48.180> use

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.330 
and of course the microphone that I use

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:49.460 
and of course the microphone that I use
is<00:01:48.510> actually<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.870> one<00:01:48.990> that<00:01:49.170> I'm<00:01:49.260> currently

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
is actually the one that I'm currently

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.730 
is actually the one that I'm currently
talking<00:01:49.920> into<00:01:50.370> it<00:01:50.550> is<00:01:50.850> a<00:01:51.000> blue<00:01:51.390> DC<00:01:52.170> microphone

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
talking into it is a blue DC microphone

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.130 
talking into it is a blue DC microphone
and<00:01:52.950> it's<00:01:53.100> probably<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.970> best<00:01:54.300> USB

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
and it's probably the best USB

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.450 
and it's probably the best USB
microphone<00:01:55.680> that<00:01:55.800> is<00:01:55.830> out<00:01:56.070> there<00:01:56.100> I<00:01:56.280> know

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
microphone that is out there I know

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.859 
microphone that is out there I know
there's<00:01:56.670> a<00:01:56.760> few<00:01:56.909> competitors<00:01:57.479> that<00:01:57.659> make<00:01:57.840> very

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
there's a few competitors that make very

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.109 
there's a few competitors that make very
very<00:01:58.470> good<00:01:58.619> stuff<00:01:58.830> as<00:01:58.979> well<00:01:59.159> but<00:01:59.580> this<00:01:59.729> is<00:01:59.910> by

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
very good stuff as well but this is by

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.969 
very good stuff as well but this is by
far<00:02:00.150> the<00:02:00.509> best<00:02:00.810> microphone<00:02:01.350> that<00:02:01.500> I<00:02:01.650> have<00:02:01.800> ever

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
far the best microphone that I have ever

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.770 
far the best microphone that I have ever
use<00:02:02.220> that<00:02:02.460> is<00:02:02.550> quite<00:02:02.880> easy<00:02:03.119> to<00:02:03.479> use<00:02:03.630> as<00:02:03.750> well

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
use that is quite easy to use as well

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.749 
use that is quite easy to use as well
and<00:02:04.380> you<00:02:04.470> don't<00:02:04.650> need<00:02:04.710> any<00:02:04.890> fancy<00:02:05.100> setup<00:02:05.490> for

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
and you don't need any fancy setup for

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.790 
and you don't need any fancy setup for
it<00:02:05.790> you<00:02:05.940> just<00:02:06.090> plug<00:02:06.390> it<00:02:06.509> into<00:02:06.630> your<00:02:06.840> PC<00:02:07.020> as<00:02:07.619> you

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 
it you just plug it into your PC as you

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.770 
it you just plug it into your PC as you
might<00:02:08.039> hear<00:02:08.190> it<00:02:08.429> sounds<00:02:08.850> pretty<00:02:09.000> damn<00:02:09.270> good<00:02:09.509> so

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
might hear it sounds pretty damn good so

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.750 
might hear it sounds pretty damn good so
I'm<00:02:09.959> definitely<00:02:10.530> going<00:02:10.979> to<00:02:11.070> be<00:02:11.160> sticking<00:02:11.610> with

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
I'm definitely going to be sticking with

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:23.980 
I'm definitely going to be sticking with
this<00:02:11.880> one<00:02:12.120> for<00:02:12.360> quite<00:02:12.630> some<00:02:12.930> time

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.410 

so<00:02:24.800> this<00:02:24.980> is<00:02:25.130> my<00:02:25.250> actual<00:02:25.640> system<00:02:26.090> as<00:02:26.180> you<00:02:26.270> can

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
so this is my actual system as you can

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.780 
so this is my actual system as you can
see<00:02:26.570> it<00:02:26.690> has<00:02:26.810> fancy<00:02:27.110> blue<00:02:27.830> LEDs<00:02:28.370> and<00:02:28.580> all<00:02:28.670> that

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
see it has fancy blue LEDs and all that

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.640 
see it has fancy blue LEDs and all that
kind<00:02:29.000> of<00:02:29.060> stuff<00:02:29.180> and<00:02:29.510> in<00:02:29.780> general<00:02:30.200> I'm<00:02:30.320> pretty

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
kind of stuff and in general I'm pretty

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.140 
kind of stuff and in general I'm pretty
damn<00:02:30.830> satisfied<00:02:31.370> with<00:02:31.520> this<00:02:31.580> machine<00:02:31.910> if<00:02:32.060> you

this<00:03:35.960> is<00:03:36.140> not<00:03:36.560> something<00:03:37.040> that<00:03:37.070> you<00:03:37.250> would

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
this is not something that you would

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.640 
this is not something that you would
consider<00:03:37.400> like<00:03:38.000> top<00:03:38.330> of<00:03:38.540> top<00:03:38.810> off<00:03:38.990> the<00:03:39.170> top<00:03:39.470> of

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
consider like top of top off the top of

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.470 
consider like top of top off the top of
the<00:03:39.830> line<00:03:40.010> but<00:03:40.790> it<00:03:40.910> is<00:03:41.000> a<00:03:41.060> pretty<00:03:41.210> decent

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
the line but it is a pretty decent

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.330 
the line but it is a pretty decent
system<00:03:41.840> so<00:03:42.140> if<00:03:42.320> you're<00:03:42.470> looking<00:03:42.590> into<00:03:43.040> doing

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
system so if you're looking into doing

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.100 
system so if you're looking into doing
something<00:03:43.730> similar<00:03:44.150> like<00:03:44.450> I<00:03:44.690> do<00:03:44.750> right<00:03:45.050> now

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.110 
something similar like I do right now

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:46.600 
something similar like I do right now
with<00:03:45.410> the<00:03:45.530> live<00:03:45.710> streaming<00:03:46.010> and<00:03:46.220> a<00:03:46.280> youtube

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:46.610 
with the live streaming and a youtube

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:48.040 
with the live streaming and a youtube
and<00:03:46.820> all<00:03:46.880> that<00:03:46.970> kind<00:03:47.180> of<00:03:47.240> stuff<00:03:47.360> this<00:03:47.870> is

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:48.050 
and all that kind of stuff this is

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:49.510 
and all that kind of stuff this is
definitely<00:03:48.470> a<00:03:48.650> system<00:03:49.100> that<00:03:49.220> I<00:03:49.250> would

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:49.520 
definitely a system that I would

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.430 
definitely a system that I would
recommend<00:03:50.030> you<00:03:50.180> go<00:03:50.360> for<00:03:50.660> or<00:03:50.810> aim<00:03:51.020> for<00:03:51.230> or

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
recommend you go for or aim for or

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.350 
recommend you go for or aim for or
whatever<00:03:51.590> and<00:03:52.010> how<00:03:52.400> I<00:03:52.430> usually<00:03:52.760> go<00:03:53.180> about

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.360 
whatever and how I usually go about

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.150 
whatever and how I usually go about
setting<00:03:53.810> up<00:03:53.900> my<00:03:54.050> system<00:03:54.350> I<00:03:54.500> actually<00:03:54.770> bought

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.160 
setting up my system I actually bought

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.580 
setting up my system I actually bought
this<00:03:55.190> system<00:03:55.730> about<00:03:56.030> two<00:03:56.510> years<00:03:56.720> ago<00:03:56.870> -<00:03:57.320> three

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
this system about two years ago - three

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.950 
this system about two years ago - three
years<00:03:57.620> ago<00:03:57.860> and<00:03:58.220> I<00:03:58.610> basically<00:03:59.090> replace<00:03:59.570> every

00:03:59.950 --> 00:03:59.960 
years ago and I basically replace every

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:03.040 
years ago and I basically replace every
part<00:04:00.290> since<00:04:00.560> then<00:04:00.830> besides<00:04:01.400> the<00:04:01.580> case<00:04:01.820> and<00:04:02.810> the

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:03.050 
part since then besides the case and the

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:04.900 
part since then besides the case and the
power<00:04:03.320> supply<00:04:03.560> but<00:04:04.340> I<00:04:04.370> don't<00:04:04.550> think<00:04:04.730> any

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:04.910 
power supply but I don't think any

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:06.760 
power supply but I don't think any
original<00:04:05.450> part<00:04:05.630> is<00:04:05.720> really<00:04:06.020> left<00:04:06.290> from<00:04:06.500> it<00:04:06.620> so

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:06.770 
original part is really left from it so

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:09.460 
original part is really left from it so
I<00:04:06.800> like<00:04:07.070> updating<00:04:07.400> everything<00:04:08.020> you<00:04:09.020> know<00:04:09.140> as<00:04:09.350> I
