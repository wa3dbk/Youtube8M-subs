00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.600
 best of technology in a language 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.460
 that you understand how everyone already knows 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.130
 vivienne version for ios and android 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.440
 is officially available in 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.900
 this moment install the bm in a galaxy 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.430
 neutral and in an iphone fibers is I have the 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.529
 comparison of the application in both 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.930
 devices the best of waters and what 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.460
 best of android device ok 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.580
 as you can see here I have the iphone 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.070
 fibers and the galaxy note tree two very 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.300
 good phones I could almost dare 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.040
 so the best thing in the market 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.559
 in both I have the application installed 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.879
 here I show exactly 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:38.070
 let's send us a message from the 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:41.570
 iphone 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:44.020
 towards the galaxy not three 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:47.190
 here we can see the menu 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.190
 we have groups 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:55.940
 contacts open chats menu through the 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:58.330
 contacts groups updates 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.330
 of State 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:06.750
 and invitations received and sent as 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.550
 can see this is the platform is very 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.260
 similar to what you do is 10 here is 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:11.550
 to invite a contact obviously in 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.550
 Android device we have many more 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:17.400
 options like inviting by nfc that month 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:19.170
 and do not pin and bar code unlike him 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.680
 there are times that it is a little more limited 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.990
 would be bar code pink and not in that month not 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.140
 being more deficient but yes a little 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.119
 more limited as we are used to 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.580
 to what is there is a platform a bit 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.790
 more closed 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:36.230
 and let's see we have settings in sex 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.630
 we can adjust how we want to see the 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:40.810
 contacts and on list or on grid in 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:44.750
 this case in English serial est old breed 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:49.230
 that contact we choose web and we can 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:51.150
 see them as in kind of tiles 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:52.550
 in both phones, the 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.740
 application 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:57.140
 when you install it and create your blackberry and 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.940
 he gives you a new pin here we have the 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:02.060
 icon let's see the opening speed 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.800
 1-2-3 we open the same on both phones 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.980
 already panel in fact both phones are 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.300
 very fast we can not leave aside 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:13.120
 that are the last phones that there are in 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:13.120
 the galaxy market no 3 and iphone 5 s 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.280
 because in the on the android we have in the 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.660
 notification bar above always 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.060
 an icon that will say living 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.890
 connect on the iphone as always 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.780
 we have only the icon and when it falls 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:28.450
 a new house, then the 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:31.420
 red eyelash on the edge of the icon 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.750
 and here we can see I have the icon in my 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.610
 Doc 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.840
 I'm sorry for the approach is a little bit 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.710
 out of focus the good camera here looks 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:42.320
 well we open the beat well it is very fluid 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:43.700
 the application unlike the 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.520
 beta versions that were filtered in 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:50.300
 a little slower this is coming very 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:52.900
 well corrected in the equal android 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:55.520
 way here we have the icon open 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.610
 we can see here I'm focusing a 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:02.550
 little bit or went out 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:02.550
 although here we are open good 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.130
 we can see how fluid the application 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.380
 let's try messages I'm sending 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:09.670
 a message to my personal phone there 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.440
 is 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.800
 does not show the notifications of 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.660
 screen we do the air to the 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:19.030
 notification and we go directly to 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:21.670
 message as expected from vivienne 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:24.040
 we have the notification of read and 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.690
 sent the same as if you were in a 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.330
 blackberry unlike you're in a 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:30.880
 phone much better for me a mode of 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:33.489
 vista era is a super blackberry what 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.720
 it lacked to the guard are many the 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:36.400
 people we were used to 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.010
 acquire a blackberry just for the 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.450
 blackberry messenger with this I think that 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.370
 is enough for many of the 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.230
 today's users I hope and have 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.360
