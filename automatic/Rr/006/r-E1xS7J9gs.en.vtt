00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.209
 hello that such friends welcome in this 

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:14.190
 7 chapter of the stock course my name 

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:15.629
 is Carlos Arturo and well then today in this 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.220
 small chapter we will be seeing 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:19.500
 about bread crumbs or also 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.450
 known in English as grade comes and 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.160
 well, these crumbs of bread what we 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.050
 let's tell them to give the user 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.820
 information on where in 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.050
 Our website is located by 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.539
 example I'm here on my website 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.910
 falcon masters dotcom and here I have 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.769
 a few bread crumbs the stockings of 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.960
 These would be bread you're seeing 

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:38.940
 here on the screen the bread crumbs 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.340
 says where I am in this case tells me 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.719
 that I'm in web design and then before 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.969
 of web design I have the category of 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.190
 home in another example would this be in 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.170
 which I'm in the post and I have what 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.760
 that is start there is broadcast more 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.230
 complexes obviously in the colors 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.239
 can be for example the page of 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.120
 start after a category after 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.530
 post and so on then well look for us 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.449
 gives an option to add them 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.550
 easily and that's what we 're going to be 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.960
 learning to do in this chapter is 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.090
 that here I already have the document done 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.670
 here I have the structure that is very 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.190
 easy the only thing I have done is a 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.340
 container fluid after a space a 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.869
 balance online with a green 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.100
 you are using for the truth is that they are 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:17.840
 very simple does not have any 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.509
 complication and are handled by 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.369
 ready these lists are not going to be the 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:24.799
 typical messy lists that are going to 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:27.170
 be ordered lists by which we 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:29.900
 to record oly we will record your 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.900
 break class com 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.610
 We'll even give you his version and then 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.470
 let's put the elements of law that 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:41.000
 we want for example I'm going to add 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:43.220
 about 3 here wrong add about 3 and 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.690
 within that remove an attribute to good 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.810
 Well, I can tell the first one that he has 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:53.000
 start to the second we're going to say that 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:55.730
 I do not know category category number one 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.510
 and the next we're going to say I do not know 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:01.430
 article article number there is good 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.870
 well this would be our break or 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.330
 we update on the page we're going to 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:07.220
 get this as well there is these 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.600
 are the mines and valen that we 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.800
 allows you to create bots up 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.600
 The truth is that it is very simple 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.150
 He says it is article one in 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.580
 category one inside home is well 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.620
 of simple this broadcom covers in this 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.900
 100% case as you may be watching 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.930
 so if you want to make it smaller 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.280
 you will have to close your item or l 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.290
 inside a container in this case 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.660
 sink with a column in this case 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:33.910
 back to a middle column of I think 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:37.760
 well about five then there is 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:39.410
 we keep updating and as you can see 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.900
 the droid as it has already become smaller 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.930
 this is what we can do normally 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.310
 and you do not want article one to be 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.200
 click that speaks is the last 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.360
 element because good because the last 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.950
 element is supposed to be where you are 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.660
 for example here on my website as 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.940
 can be can you click on start to 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.560
 back but in the article as I am 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.240
 inside the park I want to give you a click 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.240
 it does not make good sense 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:05.510
 then in the last element you would have 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:08.319
 to erase in this part of what is it 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:11.290
 recommendable then we erased it 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:12.909
 we keep updating and there it is as 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:16.180
 You can see this item is no longer click 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:18.010
 that speaks and can not be explained but 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.840
 we can still give one more style because 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.939
 As unexplainable, we mean that it is 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.760
 the active element then we add 

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:28.000
 our active class we keep 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:31.060
 we update and there it is composed now 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.250
 it has a little gray color and this one 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.989
 way is how you can grab tubert with 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.419
 the truth is that it is very simple is in 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:40.120
 function in responsive obviously what 

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:42.430
 better would be to see these megas were 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.200
 very long because if there comes a time in 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.540
 which is going to happen this as you can see 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.939
 the elements are put down and there is no 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:51.459
 badly it is not bad but what 

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:53.919
 It would be advisable that we do not have crumbs 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:55.329
 of very big bread so we come 

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:57.549
 then that has been all for this 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:59.109
 small this little chapter you know 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:00.800
 that my name is Carlos Arturo and we 

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:02.750
