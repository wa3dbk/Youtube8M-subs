00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:07.660
 there the backpacker's staff 

00:00:08.169 --> 00:00:11.169
 showing my old tent 

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:16.079
 but in the optics are two barack is very common 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.109
 used there 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.289
 Gina, I bought it. 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.089
 after seeing lots of backpackers from their staff 

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:28.089
 Praise the booth too much 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.710
 the spectrum difference 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.710
 in nautical 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:41.070
 and the ice mana 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.050
 absurd 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.409
 I think this pec gets up to hard with each other only year was very hard 

00:00:47.409 --> 00:00:50.409
 It gets tough to work on the floor 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:00.420
 nautical vanderleia 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.420
 about perfect afternoon ceiling 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.440
 the general condition of the tent where it is very good 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.110
 from the ground up 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.110
 Google 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.250
 mom 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:22.850
 the promoter 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.290
 Lula criticizes this type of booth baratinho 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.230
 the call is very fast 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:32.100
 How did you feel when you married? 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.100
 I do not use ten days' cades 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.440
 and the very field at prime campi on the edge of the beach so I guess it's more 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:40.840
 with me 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.100
 the honda / expensive 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.960
 he gets insecure that they turn into accepting orders race in Libya 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:59.700
 for more soon 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.700
 v 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.889
 finishing 

00:02:13.889 --> 00:02:15.759
 it's good 

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:18.759
 material is much more greedy 

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:21.149
 on canvas 

00:02:21.149 --> 00:02:24.149
 the muddy bottom 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:28.739
 unlike one hour a yellow 

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:34.599
 prof 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:37.389
 which is a little longer 

00:02:37.389 --> 00:02:39.919
 little 

00:02:39.919 --> 00:02:42.919
 if there is no time to show 

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:43.759
 we 

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:49.629
 there are no easy-to-ride tents 

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:53.229
 these countries have often are bush 

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:56.619
 the safety in the technical tent for corner 

00:03:56.619 --> 00:04:00.059
 the next show tarso counts a lot 

00:04:00.059 --> 00:04:04.199
 but it also became difficult to show the world 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:08.299
 barkat hanover with seam and here 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:11.299
 one topped off 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:17.489
 vetoed not to touch the ground 

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:29.759
 a fight 

00:04:40.029 --> 00:04:41.800
 I preferred that he 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.270
 the door opens upside down 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:47.599
 so I think she's going to fall on the floor will get dirty 

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:50.949
 I would prefer it to open for months on the nautical side. 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:54.990
 avoid contact with the floor 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.520
 now bounce 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:02.570
 with a 60 liter style inside you guys have idea of ​​the size of the tent 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.139
 A person 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:13.759
 quietly traveling alone 

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:16.199
 I love abortion style 

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:19.499
 with meda 

00:05:19.499 --> 00:05:22.809
 for 2 people I think k b2 people 

00:05:22.809 --> 00:05:25.809
 in a good now well 2 people of two reasons 

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:29.529
 I get a little more difficult 

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:52.400
 that's the backpacker's weight work
