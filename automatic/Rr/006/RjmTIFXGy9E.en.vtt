so what I wanted next what I wanted to
show<00:01:20.470> you<00:01:20.500> is<00:01:20.830> 3d<00:01:21.820> blocks<00:01:22.150> mod<00:01:22.390> and<00:01:22.750> so<00:01:23.440> as<00:01:23.530> you

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:23.619 
show you is 3d blocks mod and so as you

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:25.710 
show you is 3d blocks mod and so as you
can<00:01:23.680> see<00:01:23.770> what<00:01:24.100> it<00:01:24.220> does<00:01:24.400> is<00:01:24.610> just<00:01:24.880> add<00:01:25.000> a

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:25.720 
can see what it does is just add a

can see what it does is just add a
little<00:01:25.840> bit<00:01:26.020> three<00:01:26.320> deenis<00:01:26.830> to<00:01:27.100> the<00:01:27.280> flowers

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:27.790 
little bit three deenis to the flowers

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 
just show it to let me just go a little

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:42.960 
just show it to let me just go a little
bit<00:01:41.500> down<00:01:41.649> and<00:01:41.979> yeah<00:01:42.280> you<00:01:42.340> can<00:01:42.520> see<00:01:42.580> it's<00:01:42.909> a

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:53.219 
small mod two but it just makes you look
cooler<00:01:50.649> at<00:01:51.009> that<00:01:51.280> mod<00:01:51.520> is<00:01:51.700> called<00:01:52.020> physics<00:01:53.020> mod

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:53.229 
cooler at that mod is called physics mod

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:56.669 
cooler at that mod is called physics mod
and<00:01:53.910> it's<00:01:54.910> what<00:01:55.390> it<00:01:55.509> does<00:01:55.660> is<00:01:55.840> just<00:01:55.869> adds<00:01:56.320> kind

00:01:56.669 --> 00:01:56.679 
and it's what it does is just adds kind

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:58.469 
and it's what it does is just adds kind
of<00:01:56.800> realistic<00:01:57.369> physics<00:01:57.729> to<00:01:57.880> it<00:01:58.000> instead<00:01:58.420> of

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 
of realistic physics to it instead of

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:00.810 
of realistic physics to it instead of
like<00:01:58.780> item<00:01:59.350> staying<00:01:59.710> on<00:01:59.860> ground<00:02:00.190> and<00:02:00.399> spinning

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820 
like item staying on ground and spinning

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.399 
like item staying on ground and spinning
around<00:02:00.910> it<00:02:01.330> just<00:02:01.360> goes<00:02:01.720> on<00:02:01.869> the<00:02:01.929> floor<00:02:02.080> right

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:02.409 
around it just goes on the floor right

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:04.550 
around it just goes on the floor right
and<00:02:02.649> it<00:02:02.710> right<00:02:03.070> straight<00:02:03.399> up<00:02:03.640> it<00:02:03.909> like<00:02:04.030> if<00:02:04.240> you

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
and it right straight up it like if you

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.800 
and it right straight up it like if you
just<00:02:05.560> like<00:02:05.740> that<00:02:06.270> you<00:02:07.270> can<00:02:07.450> just<00:02:07.479> throw<00:02:07.630> it

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
just like that you can just throw it

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.759 
just like that you can just throw it
however<00:02:08.500> you<00:02:08.679> want<00:02:08.860> and<00:02:09.069> BAM<00:02:10.170> pretty<00:02:11.170> go<00:02:11.319> I

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:11.769 
however you want and BAM pretty go I

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:14.699 
however you want and BAM pretty go I
think<00:02:12.069> I<00:02:12.489> guess<00:02:12.819> yeah<00:02:13.239> whichever<00:02:14.200> direction

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
think I guess yeah whichever direction

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:16.110 
think I guess yeah whichever direction
you're<00:02:14.860> looking<00:02:15.130> at<00:02:15.250> it<00:02:15.370> will<00:02:15.459> just<00:02:15.610> go<00:02:15.880> and

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
you're looking at it will just go and

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.050 
you're looking at it will just go and
flip<00:02:16.540> and<00:02:16.750> fall<00:02:17.019> down<00:02:17.049> just<00:02:17.950> like<00:02:18.040> that<00:02:18.100> so

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
flip and fall down just like that so

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.970 
flip and fall down just like that so
yeah<00:02:19.239> I<00:02:19.299> think<00:02:19.450> that's<00:02:19.810> pretty<00:02:19.930> much<00:02:20.079> it<00:02:20.200> you

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980
