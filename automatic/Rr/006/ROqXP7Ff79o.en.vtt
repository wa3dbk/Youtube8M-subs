00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
inches sits sits real nice maybe the

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.689 
inches sits sits real nice maybe the
back<00:00:57.180> could<00:00:57.360> be<00:00:57.390> tucked<00:00:58.079> like<00:00:58.320> another<00:00:58.699> half

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
back could be tucked like another half

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.790 
back could be tucked like another half
inch<00:00:59.969> or<00:01:00.239> so<00:01:00.449> just<00:01:01.020> to<00:01:01.199> make<00:01:01.320> it<00:01:01.350> look<00:01:01.469> probably

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
inch or so just to make it look probably

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.979 
inch or so just to make it look probably
perfect<00:01:02.370> but<00:01:02.550> i<00:01:03.000> think<00:01:03.420> it<00:01:03.480> actually<00:01:03.750> sits

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
perfect but i think it actually sits

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.530 
perfect but i think it actually sits
pretty<00:01:04.260> good<00:01:04.580> front<00:01:05.580> of<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.790> car<00:01:06.330> didn't

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
pretty good front of the car didn't

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.330 
pretty good front of the car didn't
require<00:01:06.780> any<00:01:06.840> type<00:01:07.170> of<00:01:07.229> camber<00:01:07.680> modification

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
require any type of camber modification

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.000 
require any type of camber modification
but<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.610> back<00:01:08.820> does<00:01:09.119> have<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:10.010> the

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
but the back does have the the

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.550 
but the back does have the the
adjustable<00:01:11.640> camber<00:01:12.030> kit<00:01:12.210> on<00:01:12.390> there<00:01:12.630> I<00:01:13.140> think

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
adjustable camber kit on there I think

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.780 
adjustable camber kit on there I think
it<00:01:13.650> was<00:01:13.740> comprised<00:01:14.130> of<00:01:14.310> like<00:01:14.460> three<00:01:14.700> different

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
it was comprised of like three different

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.429 
it was comprised of like three different
control<00:01:15.330> arms<00:01:15.630> on<00:01:15.840> it<00:01:17.060> and<00:01:18.200> you'll<00:01:19.200> notice

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
control arms on it and you'll notice

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.620 
control arms on it and you'll notice
that<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.979> door<00:01:20.610> handles<00:01:21.090> on<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.299> car<00:01:21.479> are

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
that the door handles on the car are

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.310 
that the door handles on the car are
