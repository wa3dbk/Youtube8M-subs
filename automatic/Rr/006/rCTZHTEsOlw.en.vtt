00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:54.819 
I've got no idea 21 22 23 24 25 26 27
it's<00:00:53.120> because<00:00:53.449> it's<00:00:53.690> a<00:00:53.899> it's<00:00:54.410> a<00:00:54.530> cube<00:00:54.710> number

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:54.829 
it's because it's a it's a cube number

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:57.220 
it's because it's a it's a cube number
I'm<00:00:55.519> big<00:00:55.940> fan<00:00:56.089> of<00:00:56.120> cube<00:00:56.359> numbers<00:00:56.660> and<00:00:57.079> this<00:00:57.170> is

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.230 
I'm big fan of cube numbers and this is

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:02.570 
after a while I looked into it and saw

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:05.140 
after a while I looked into it and saw
that<00:04:02.600> the<00:04:03.530> way<00:04:03.770> it<00:04:03.950> works<00:04:04.250> uses<00:04:04.910> some<00:04:05.120> very

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
that the way it works uses some very

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.170 
that the way it works uses some very
clever<00:04:05.870> bits<00:04:06.260> of<00:04:06.530> some<00:04:07.130> numbers<00:04:07.580> and<00:04:07.820> a<00:04:07.850> little

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
clever bits of some numbers and a little

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.150 
clever bits of some numbers and a little
bit<00:04:08.270> of<00:04:08.360> calculation<00:04:08.840> so<00:04:09.230> I'm<00:04:09.860> going<00:04:09.980> to<00:04:10.010> show

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.160 
bit of calculation so I'm going to show

bit of calculation so I'm going to show
you<00:04:10.190> how<00:04:10.340> the<00:04:10.400> trick<00:04:10.610> works<00:04:10.820> I'm<00:04:11.570> not<00:04:11.630> going<00:04:12.230> to

you how the trick works I'm not going to
explain<00:04:12.680> all<00:04:13.040> the<00:04:13.190> math<00:04:13.370> behind<00:04:13.640> it<00:04:14.120> but<00:04:14.420> I

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:14.630 
explain all the math behind it but I

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:16.240 
explain all the math behind it but I
will<00:04:14.810> tell<00:04:15.080> you<00:04:15.230> what<00:04:15.410> you<00:04:15.530> can<00:04:15.680> do<00:04:15.830> if<00:04:16.070> you

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
will tell you what you can do if you

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:17.680 
will tell you what you can do if you
wish<00:04:16.370> to<00:04:16.520> work<00:04:16.670> it<00:04:16.820> out<00:04:16.880> now<00:04:17.359> the<00:04:17.420> way<00:04:17.540> the

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
wish to work it out now the way the

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.170 
wish to work it out now the way the
trick<00:04:17.840> works<00:04:18.020> is<00:04:18.170> you<00:04:18.230> start<00:04:18.290> with<00:04:18.530> 27<00:04:18.770> cards

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
trick works is you start with 27 cards

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.670 
trick works is you start with 27 cards
it's<00:04:20.180> a<00:04:20.239> cube<00:04:20.540> number<00:04:20.840> for<00:04:21.020> a<00:04:21.049> very<00:04:21.260> important

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680 
it's a cube number for a very important

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.740 
it's a cube number for a very important
reason<00:04:21.859> and<00:04:22.310> you<00:04:23.090> get<00:04:23.240> your<00:04:23.360> volunteer<00:04:23.660> to

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750 
reason and you get your volunteer to

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:25.870 
reason and you get your volunteer to
pick<00:04:23.900> one<00:04:24.050> of<00:04:24.169> these<00:04:24.260> at<00:04:24.440> random<00:04:24.800> so<00:04:25.040> let's

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
pick one of these at random so let's

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:26.860 
pick one of these at random so let's
just<00:04:26.180> do<00:04:26.300> the<00:04:26.419> trick<00:04:26.630> now

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
just do the trick now

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.500 
just do the trick now
with<00:04:27.110> the<00:04:27.949> five<00:04:28.160> of<00:04:28.310> hearts<00:04:28.580> so<00:04:29.120> they<00:04:29.150> pick<00:04:29.479> a

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
with the five of hearts so they pick a

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:31.360 
with the five of hearts so they pick a
card<00:04:29.840> they<00:04:30.199> look<00:04:30.440> at<00:04:30.530> the<00:04:30.620> card<00:04:30.830> they<00:04:31.100> put<00:04:31.280> it

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.370 
card they look at the card they put it

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:34.240 
card they look at the card they put it
back<00:04:31.490> in<00:04:31.729> somewhere<00:04:32.120> and<00:04:32.510> they<00:04:32.900> shuffle<00:04:33.260> it<00:04:33.410> so

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.250 
back in somewhere and they shuffle it so

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.580 
back in somewhere and they shuffle it so
now<00:04:34.370> there's<00:04:34.610> there's<00:04:34.880> a<00:04:35.030> card<00:04:35.360> somewhere<00:04:36.290> at

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
now there's there's a card somewhere at

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.680 
now there's there's a card somewhere at
a<00:04:36.680> certain<00:04:37.010> position<00:04:37.340> but<00:04:38.300> you<00:04:38.360> don't<00:04:38.540> know

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:38.690 
a certain position but you don't know

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:40.060 
a certain position but you don't know
what<00:04:38.870> it<00:04:38.990> is<00:04:39.110> you<00:04:39.229> don't<00:04:39.320> know<00:04:39.410> where<00:04:39.770> it<00:04:39.919> is

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.070 
what it is you don't know where it is

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:42.010 
what it is you don't know where it is
however<00:04:40.669> once<00:04:41.060> you<00:04:41.210> start<00:04:41.510> putting<00:04:41.720> it<00:04:41.900> down

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.020 
however once you start putting it down

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:45.219 
however once you start putting it down
into<00:04:42.590> three<00:04:43.310> piles<00:04:43.610> you<00:04:44.540> get<00:04:44.720> them<00:04:44.870> to<00:04:45.020> watch

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:45.229 
into three piles you get them to watch

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:48.040 
into three piles you get them to watch
very<00:04:45.590> closely<00:04:45.919> and<00:04:46.280> eventually<00:04:46.910> they<00:04:47.720> will<00:04:47.900> be

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
very closely and eventually they will be

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:50.590 
very closely and eventually they will be
able<00:04:48.110> to<00:04:48.229> point<00:04:48.470> out<00:04:48.710> which<00:04:49.220> pile<00:04:49.639> there<00:04:50.270> it<00:04:50.389> is

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:50.600 
able to point out which pile there it is

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.600 
able to point out which pile there it is
the<00:04:50.840> first<00:04:51.050> one<00:04:51.139> they<00:04:51.680> will<00:04:51.889> be<00:04:52.220> able<00:04:52.340> to<00:04:52.400> point

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:52.610 
the first one they will be able to point

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:54.189 
the first one they will be able to point
out<00:04:52.820> which<00:04:53.060> pile<00:04:53.360> it<00:04:53.600> was<00:04:53.720> in<00:04:53.870> so<00:04:53.990> in<00:04:54.110> this

00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:54.199 
out which pile it was in so in this

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:56.260 
out which pile it was in so in this
particular<00:04:54.380> case<00:04:54.800> you<00:04:55.639> would<00:04:55.760> ask<00:04:55.880> them<00:04:56.120> where

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.270 
particular case you would ask them where

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:57.670 
particular case you would ask them where
it<00:04:56.389> is<00:04:56.479> that<00:04:56.900> would<00:04:57.050> say<00:04:57.169> it's<00:04:57.320> in<00:04:57.380> the<00:04:57.410> first

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 
it is that would say it's in the first

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.980 
it is that would say it's in the first
pile<00:04:58.010> you<00:04:58.639> then<00:04:58.850> pick<00:04:59.060> them<00:04:59.270> up<00:04:59.389> and<00:04:59.600> as<00:04:59.780> you

00:04:59.980 --> 00:04:59.990 
pile you then pick them up and as you

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:02.740 
pile you then pick them up and as you
pick<00:05:00.260> them<00:05:00.410> up<00:05:00.590> you've<00:05:01.460> got<00:05:01.490> a<00:05:01.669> choice

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:02.750 
pick them up you've got a choice

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:04.600 
pick them up you've got a choice
so<00:05:03.229> these<00:05:03.500> doesn't<00:05:04.010> matter<00:05:04.130> what's<00:05:04.310> in<00:05:04.490> these

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:04.610 
so these doesn't matter what's in these

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:06.670 
so these doesn't matter what's in these

let's<00:05:21.260> put<00:05:21.680> it<00:05:21.800> on<00:05:22.010> the<00:05:22.820> top<00:05:23.000> let's<00:05:23.389> say<00:05:23.570> now

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:24.350 
let's put it on the top let's say now

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:26.680 
let's put it on the top let's say now
when<00:05:24.590> you<00:05:24.680> deal<00:05:24.949> them<00:05:25.100> out<00:05:25.190> again<00:05:25.610> at<00:05:25.880> the<00:05:26.539> end

choice of top middle bottom and after

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.120 
choice of top middle bottom and after
the<00:05:32.330> third<00:05:32.570> round<00:05:32.900> you'll<00:05:33.260> have<00:05:33.500> a<00:05:33.740> third

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:34.130 
the third round you'll have a third

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:36.700 
the third round you'll have a third

choice or top middle bottom and if

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:38.770 
choice or top middle bottom and if
you've<00:05:37.099> got<00:05:37.280> three<00:05:37.550> options<00:05:37.970> and<00:05:38.210> you<00:05:38.510> get<00:05:38.660> to

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:38.780 
you've got three options and you get to

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:41.320 
you've got three options and you get to
choose<00:05:38.810> from<00:05:39.250> three<00:05:40.250> times<00:05:40.580> that's<00:05:40.849> a<00:05:41.000> total

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:41.330 
choose from three times that's a total

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:44.020 
choose from three times that's a total
of<00:05:41.419> 27<00:05:42.320> different<00:05:42.800> combinations<00:05:43.639> of<00:05:43.789> top

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:44.030 
of 27 different combinations of top

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:45.850 
of 27 different combinations of top
middle<00:05:44.360> bottom<00:05:44.389> as<00:05:44.840> you<00:05:44.900> go<00:05:45.470> through<00:05:45.710> this

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:45.860 
middle bottom as you go through this

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:48.640 
middle bottom as you go through this
trick<00:05:46.160> and<00:05:46.880> it's<00:05:47.570> no<00:05:47.720> coincidence<00:05:47.750> that's<00:05:48.530> the

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:48.650 
trick and it's no coincidence that's the

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:50.110 
trick and it's no coincidence that's the
same<00:05:48.860> number<00:05:49.070> as<00:05:49.310> the<00:05:49.340> number<00:05:49.490> of<00:05:49.849> cards

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:50.120 
same number as the number of cards

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:51.370 
same number as the number of cards
because<00:05:50.750> each<00:05:50.900> of<00:05:50.930> those<00:05:51.169> different

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:51.380 
because each of those different

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:54.190 
because each of those different
combinations<00:05:52.280> matches<00:05:53.270> up<00:05:53.419> with<00:05:53.630> a<00:05:53.660> different

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:54.200 
combinations matches up with a different

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:57.700 
combinations matches up with a different
finishing<00:05:54.770> position<00:05:55.250> so<00:05:55.729> if<00:05:56.360> you<00:05:56.570> did<00:05:56.840> top<00:05:57.410> top

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:57.710 
finishing position so if you did top top

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:59.350 
finishing position so if you did top top
bottom<00:05:57.740> it<00:05:58.340> would<00:05:58.460> put<00:05:58.669> it<00:05:58.789> in<00:05:58.880> one<00:05:59.060> particular

00:05:59.350 --> 00:05:59.360 
bottom it would put it in one particular

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.960 
bottom it would put it in one particular
place<00:05:59.750> in<00:06:00.530> fact<00:06:00.710> the<00:06:00.919> trick<00:06:01.130> I<00:06:01.220> did<00:06:01.280> before<00:06:01.789> I

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:01.970 
place in fact the trick I did before I

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:05.860 
place in fact the trick I did before I
put<00:06:02.570> it<00:06:02.780> it<00:06:03.470> was<00:06:03.710> middle<00:06:04.070> bottom<00:06:04.699> top<00:06:05.030> and<00:06:05.300> that

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:05.870 
put it it was middle bottom top and that

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:08.560 
put it it was middle bottom top and that
put<00:06:06.139> it<00:06:06.260> into<00:06:06.470> the<00:06:06.590> eighth<00:06:06.770> position<00:06:07.130> and<00:06:07.610> I've

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:08.570 
put it into the eighth position and I've

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:11.080 
put it into the eighth position and I've
just<00:06:08.930> learnt<00:06:09.229> for<00:06:10.039> every<00:06:10.370> number<00:06:10.550> someone

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:11.090 
just learnt for every number someone

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:13.089 
just learnt for every number someone
gives<00:06:11.360> me<00:06:11.479> what<00:06:11.780> combination<00:06:12.500> of<00:06:12.620> top<00:06:12.830> middle

00:06:13.089 --> 00:06:13.099 
gives me what combination of top middle

00:06:13.099 --> 00:06:14.950 
gives me what combination of top middle
bottom<00:06:13.130> will<00:06:13.820> put<00:06:14.030> their<00:06:14.180> chosen<00:06:14.419> card<00:06:14.810> in

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:14.960 
bottom will put their chosen card in

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.860 
bottom will put their chosen card in
that<00:06:15.020> position<00:06:15.340> now<00:06:16.340> you<00:06:16.400> can<00:06:16.789> you<00:06:17.389> can<00:06:17.630> just

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:17.870 
that position now you can you can just

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:20.379 
that position now you can you can just
memorize<00:06:18.080> those<00:06:18.530> combinations<00:06:19.190> or<00:06:19.400> you<00:06:20.180> can

00:06:20.379 --> 00:06:20.389 
memorize those combinations or you can

00:06:20.389 --> 00:06:22.540 
memorize those combinations or you can
look<00:06:20.510> into<00:06:20.720> the<00:06:20.900> math<00:06:21.110> behind<00:06:21.590> why<00:06:21.889> they<00:06:22.250> work

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:22.550 
look into the math behind why they work

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:24.820 
look into the math behind why they work
and<00:06:22.760> I<00:06:23.180> -<00:06:23.240> don't<00:06:23.479> bother<00:06:23.630> memorizing<00:06:23.900> them<00:06:24.440> you

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:24.830 
and I - don't bother memorizing them you

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:26.860 
and I - don't bother memorizing them you
can<00:06:25.010> use<00:06:25.250> base<00:06:25.550> three<00:06:26.000> numbers<00:06:26.419> or<00:06:26.660> what's

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:26.870 
can use base three numbers or what's

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:29.439 
can use base three numbers or what's
called<00:06:27.110> ternary<00:06:27.949> to<00:06:28.430> calculate<00:06:29.180> what

00:06:29.439 --> 00:06:29.449 
called ternary to calculate what

00:06:29.449 --> 00:06:31.510 
called ternary to calculate what
combination<00:06:30.139> of<00:06:30.260> top<00:06:30.470> middle<00:06:30.770> bottom<00:06:30.800> will

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:31.520 
combination of top middle bottom will

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:33.730 
combination of top middle bottom will
put<00:06:31.729> the<00:06:31.849> card<00:06:32.060> into<00:06:32.330> any<00:06:32.510> given<00:06:33.020> position<00:06:33.229> and

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:33.740 
put the card into any given position and

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:36.790 
put the card into any given position and
if<00:06:34.729> you<00:06:34.820> want<00:06:35.000> to<00:06:35.090> investigate<00:06:35.510> it<00:06:35.840> do<00:06:36.650> the

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:36.800 
if you want to investigate it do the

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.610 
if you want to investigate it do the
trick<00:06:37.039> by<00:06:37.610> yourself<00:06:38.000> a<00:06:38.120> few<00:06:38.300> times<00:06:38.570> maybe<00:06:39.200> turn

trick by yourself a few times maybe turn

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:40.780 
trick by yourself a few times maybe turn
a<00:06:39.650> card<00:06:40.039> over

different amounts of top middle and
bottom<00:06:44.360> and<00:06:44.780> see<00:06:44.960> where<00:06:45.170> it<00:06:45.230> ends<00:06:45.530> up<00:06:45.650> at<00:06:45.890> the

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:45.980 
bottom and see where it ends up at the

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:47.320 
bottom and see where it ends up at the
end<00:06:46.130> of<00:06:46.310> the<00:06:46.370> trick<00:06:46.610> and<00:06:46.790> after<00:06:47.060> a<00:06:47.120> while

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:47.330 
end of the trick and after a while

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:49.690 
end of the trick and after a while
you'll<00:06:47.990> work<00:06:48.200> out<00:06:48.350> the<00:06:48.500> combinations<00:06:49.130> and<00:06:49.370> if

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:49.700 
you'll work out the combinations and if

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:50.740 
you'll work out the combinations and if
you<00:06:49.820> take<00:06:49.940> a<00:06:50.000> close<00:06:50.300> look<00:06:50.510> at<00:06:50.660> the

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:50.750 
you take a close look at the

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:53.980 
you take a close look at the
combinations<00:06:51.410> you<00:06:51.890> can<00:06:52.040> see<00:06:52.340> the<00:06:53.150> base<00:06:53.570> three

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:53.990 
combinations you can see the base three

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:56.650 
combinations you can see the base three
patterns<00:06:54.410> behind<00:06:54.620> them<00:06:55.040> and<00:06:55.300> while<00:06:56.300> this<00:06:56.480> may

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:56.660 
patterns behind them and while this may

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:59.380 
patterns behind them and while this may
seem<00:06:56.720> like<00:06:57.200> a<00:06:57.520> interesting<00:06:58.520> but<00:06:58.730> maybe<00:06:58.760> overly

00:06:59.380 --> 00:06:59.390 
seem like a interesting but maybe overly

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:02.020 
seem like a interesting but maybe overly
elaborate<00:06:59.930> maths<00:07:00.380> card<00:07:00.770> trick<00:07:01.100> the<00:07:01.850> math

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:02.030 
elaborate maths card trick the math

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:04.060 
elaborate maths card trick the math
behind<00:07:02.240> it<00:07:02.600> is<00:07:02.750> alarmingly<00:07:03.230> useful<00:07:03.650> because<00:07:03.980> I

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:04.070 
behind it is alarmingly useful because I

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:06.430 
behind it is alarmingly useful because I
this<00:07:04.610> ability<00:07:04.880> to<00:07:05.120> take<00:07:05.360> something<00:07:05.600> at<00:07:06.260> one

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:06.440 
this ability to take something at one

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:07.990 
this ability to take something at one
position<00:07:06.710> and<00:07:07.130> put<00:07:07.430> it<00:07:07.520> to<00:07:07.640> any<00:07:07.790> other

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:08.000 
position and put it to any other

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.570 
position and put it to any other
position<00:07:08.240> just<00:07:08.840> by<00:07:08.990> dealing<00:07:09.380> and<00:07:09.890> re<00:07:10.070> stacking

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:10.580 
position just by dealing and re stacking

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:13.210 
position just by dealing and re stacking
is<00:07:10.700> pretty<00:07:11.390> much<00:07:11.570> what<00:07:11.960> computer<00:07:12.770> hard<00:07:12.950> drives

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:13.220 
is pretty much what computer hard drives

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:14.860 
is pretty much what computer hard drives
do<00:07:13.400> when<00:07:13.730> they're<00:07:13.880> moving<00:07:14.150> information<00:07:14.300> if

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:14.870 
do when they're moving information if

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:16.780 
do when they're moving information if
they<00:07:15.050> want<00:07:15.230> to<00:07:15.290> get<00:07:15.470> a<00:07:15.530> bit<00:07:16.130> of<00:07:16.160> information

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:16.790 
they want to get a bit of information

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:18.610 
they want to get a bit of information
from<00:07:16.910> one<00:07:17.120> place<00:07:17.390> to<00:07:17.420> another<00:07:17.630> they<00:07:18.350> do<00:07:18.410> the

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:18.620 
from one place to another they do the

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:21.250 
from one place to another they do the
same<00:07:18.830> process<00:07:19.100> but<00:07:20.000> instead<00:07:20.150> of<00:07:20.390> doing<00:07:20.720> three

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:21.260 
same process but instead of doing three

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.590 
same process but instead of doing three
piles<00:07:21.530> and<00:07:21.830> using<00:07:22.280> base<00:07:22.520> three<00:07:23.180> ternary

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:23.600 
piles and using base three ternary

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:25.750 
piles and using base three ternary
numbers<00:07:23.960> they<00:07:24.410> do<00:07:24.470> it<00:07:24.680> with<00:07:24.800> effectively<00:07:25.460> two

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:25.760 
numbers they do it with effectively two

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:28.240 
numbers they do it with effectively two
piles<00:07:26.030> and<00:07:26.360> use<00:07:26.660> base<00:07:26.900> two<00:07:27.230> binary<00:07:27.860> numbers

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:28.250 
piles and use base two binary numbers

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:31.300 
piles and use base two binary numbers
and<00:07:28.790> so<00:07:29.150> it's<00:07:29.420> both<00:07:29.750> a<00:07:30.080> lovely<00:07:30.860> bit<00:07:31.010> of<00:07:31.100> maths

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:31.310 
and so it's both a lovely bit of maths

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:33.700 
and so it's both a lovely bit of maths
and<00:07:31.580> an<00:07:32.210> impressive<00:07:32.480> card<00:07:32.870> trick<00:07:33.140> and<00:07:33.350> on<00:07:33.500> top

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:33.710 
and an impressive card trick and on top

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:36.100 
and an impressive card trick and on top
of<00:07:33.860> that<00:07:34.010> it's<00:07:34.580> actually<00:07:35.120> very<00:07:35.390> useful<00:07:35.540> maths

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:36.110 
of that it's actually very useful maths

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:38.920 
of that it's actually very useful maths
and<00:07:36.710> so<00:07:36.830> there<00:07:36.950> you<00:07:37.040> have<00:07:37.070> it<00:07:37.220> that's<00:07:38.150> why<00:07:38.540> the

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:38.930 
and so there you have it that's why the

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:41.530 
and so there you have it that's why the
27<00:07:39.530> card<00:07:39.770> trick<00:07:40.040> is<00:07:40.220> my<00:07:40.610> all-time<00:07:40.790> favorite
