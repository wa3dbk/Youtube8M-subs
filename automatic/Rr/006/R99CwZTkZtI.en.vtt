00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
Washington DC also a preview of some

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.100 
Washington DC also a preview of some
rain<00:01:41.579> that's<00:01:41.850> going<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.210> be<00:01:42.329> on<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.720> way<00:01:42.840> a

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
rain that's going to be on the way a

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.660 
rain that's going to be on the way a
little<00:01:43.470> bit<00:01:43.560> later<00:01:43.799> in<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.040> week<00:01:44.340> and

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
little bit later in the week and

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.880 
little bit later in the week and
eventually<00:01:45.360> those<00:01:45.540> temperatures<00:01:46.140> take<00:01:46.649> a<00:01:46.680> big

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
eventually those temperatures take a big

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.310 
eventually those temperatures take a big
drop<00:01:47.189> into<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:47.880> low<00:01:48.000> 60s<00:01:48.270> even<00:01:49.079> with<00:01:49.200> that

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
drop into the low 60s even with that

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.960 
drop into the low 60s even with that
though<00:01:49.590> that's<00:01:49.950> only<00:01:50.130> about<00:01:50.280> three<00:01:50.640> degrees

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
though that's only about three degrees

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.940 
though that's only about three degrees
cooler<00:01:51.000> than<00:01:51.659> average<00:01:51.780> Alex<00:01:52.560> think<00:01:52.740> to<00:01:52.829> be

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
cooler than average Alex think to be

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.190 
cooler than average Alex think to be
very<00:01:52.979> active<00:01:53.759> depending<00:01:54.329> on<00:01:54.479> specifically

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
very active depending on specifically

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.719 
very active depending on specifically
where<00:01:55.409> you<00:01:55.530> live<00:01:55.799> we've<00:01:56.369> still<00:01:56.490> got<00:01:56.610> a<00:01:56.640> little

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
where you live we've still got a little

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.580 
where you live we've still got a little
bit<00:01:56.880> of<00:01:57.030> precipitation<00:01:57.299> to<00:01:57.869> talk<00:01:58.049> about<00:01:58.350> for

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
bit of precipitation to talk about for

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.260

actually sections of the high plains

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.059 
actually sections of the high plains
could<00:02:06.780> wind<00:02:06.960> up<00:02:07.049> seeing<00:02:07.320> more<00:02:07.439> than<00:02:07.500> a<00:02:07.649> foot<00:02:07.920> of
