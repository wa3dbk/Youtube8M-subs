horror
it<00:01:26.920> isn't<00:01:27.250> really<00:01:27.430> horror<00:01:27.789> at<00:01:28.180> all<00:01:28.420> it's<00:01:28.780> just

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 
it isn't really horror at all it's just

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.039 
it isn't really horror at all it's just
a<00:01:29.320> golf<00:01:29.619> fest<00:01:29.950> and<00:01:30.610> that's<00:01:30.850> not<00:01:31.600> something

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:32.049 
a golf fest and that's not something

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:34.099 
a golf fest and that's not something
that<00:01:32.079> you<00:01:32.320> probably<00:01:32.560> want<00:01:32.890> to<00:01:33.130> do<00:01:33.310> so

00:01:34.099 --> 00:01:34.109 
that you probably want to do so

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:36.929 
that you probably want to do so
sometimes<00:01:35.109> the<00:01:35.380> most<00:01:35.560> horrific<00:01:35.890> things<00:01:36.189> are

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:36.939 
sometimes the most horrific things are

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:39.660 
sometimes the most horrific things are
things<00:01:37.240> that<00:01:37.570> aren't<00:01:38.109> quite<00:01:38.380> seen<00:01:38.770> that<00:01:39.549> are

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
things that aren't quite seen that are

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.399 
things that aren't quite seen that are
just<00:01:39.820> glimpse<00:01:40.270> out<00:01:40.509> of<00:01:40.570> the<00:01:40.719> corner<00:01:40.840> of<00:01:41.200> an<00:01:41.289> eye

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:41.409 
just glimpse out of the corner of an eye

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:43.499 
just glimpse out of the corner of an eye
that<00:01:41.619> you<00:01:41.740> think<00:01:42.250> might<00:01:42.670> be<00:01:42.700> something<00:01:43.240> really

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:43.509 
that you think might be something really

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:45.660 
that you think might be something really
horrible<00:01:43.689> but<00:01:44.560> then<00:01:44.710> maybe<00:01:44.950> it<00:01:45.130> isn't<00:01:45.310> all

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
horrible but then maybe it isn't all

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.050 
horrible but then maybe it isn't all
then<00:01:46.179> maybe<00:01:46.450> it<00:01:46.689> is<00:01:46.899> and<00:01:47.460> it's<00:01:48.460> important

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
then maybe it is and it's important

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.330 
then maybe it is and it's important
therefore<00:01:49.299> that<00:01:49.780> you<00:01:49.960> think<00:01:50.679> carefully<00:01:50.950> about

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
therefore that you think carefully about

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.419 
therefore that you think carefully about
how<00:01:51.609> you<00:01:51.670> can<00:01:52.030> disguise<00:01:52.929> the<00:01:53.590> horror<00:01:53.829> until

00:01:54.419 --> 00:01:54.429 
how you can disguise the horror until

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:56.099 
how you can disguise the horror until
