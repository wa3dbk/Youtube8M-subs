00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:12.719
 hazelnuts 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.059

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.609

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.939
 quite so sweet like sweet to 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:23.369
 of course, and we'll catch it 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.410
 that we are very classic as the 85th 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.480
 like always do that first 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:32.669
 mix dry ingredients together 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:40.950
 For this I have the flour baking powder here 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:42.719
 and oatmeal that ever 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.879
 bit changed completely to the side 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.719
 There are different evening from 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.550
 oatmeal 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.620
 I have rough for this recipe 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.960
 Oatmeal taken care of now 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.559
 We have the liquid ingredients for it 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.149
 I melted butter here and beat 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.649
 which together with the sugar first time 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.100
 a little bit on moistening the eggs 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.100
 add 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.659
 Last but not least we do now 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.760
 sugar beet syrup and milk 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:15.860
 you get sugar beet syrup quite normal 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.530
 in the supermarket and should you with this 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.820
 recipe already have in it and the 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:31.310
 For example, there's a guy from Grafschafter 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:33.049
 gold juice and now it has to be 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.909
 liquid only with the dry 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:36.409
 connect and we give that 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:37.970
 dry you are doing now in good 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:40.369
 just swim to the conclusive 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.170
 and just that as well 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:44.289
 biting everything does not mix too long 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.289
 stir 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.290
 and of course they are missing 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.300
 Hazelnuts and the fine ones 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.040

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.320
 normal hazelnuts bought in the supermarket 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.120
 and maybe I roasted in 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.290
 you do not have to do that in the distance, me 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.850
 but would be advisable 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:11.380
 and then I have the one with a knife 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.380
 just a little chopped 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.790
 you should also show dried ones 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.940
 just find the normal supermarket 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.680

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.310
