00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.839 
screws you and a lot of Game Boy Advance
games<00:02:20.690> because<00:02:21.110> you<00:02:21.250> kind<00:02:22.250> of<00:02:22.370> need<00:02:22.610> the

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:22.849 
games because you kind of need the

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:26.580 
games because you kind of need the
buttons<00:02:23.180> to<00:02:23.360> react<00:02:23.660> when<00:02:23.930> you<00:02:24.050> push<00:02:24.290> them<00:02:24.610> so<00:02:25.610> i

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
buttons to react when you push them so i

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:33.160 
buttons to react when you push them so i
looked<00:02:27.590> online<00:02:27.800> and<00:02:29.230> I<00:02:31.000> was<00:02:32.020> you<00:02:33.020> know<00:02:33.050> trying

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
looked online and I was you know trying

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.170 
looked online and I was you know trying
to<00:02:33.590> figure<00:02:33.890> out<00:02:33.920> what<00:02:34.250> the<00:02:34.400> deal<00:02:34.580> is<00:02:34.640> with<00:02:34.790> this

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
to figure out what the deal is with this

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.449 
to figure out what the deal is with this
and<00:02:35.450> I<00:02:35.900> guess<00:02:36.110> there's<00:02:36.440> there<00:02:36.830> must<00:02:37.010> be<00:02:37.190> dust

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
and I guess there's there must be dust

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:39.600 
and I guess there's there must be dust
or<00:02:37.700> something<00:02:37.850> on<00:02:38.180> the<00:02:38.269> connector<00:02:38.720> there<00:02:38.930> and

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
or something on the connector there and

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.820 
or something on the connector there and
so<00:02:40.610> in<00:02:40.790> order<00:02:40.910> to<00:02:41.090> fix<00:02:41.330> it<00:02:41.630> permanently<00:02:42.230> you'd

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
so in order to fix it permanently you'd

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.979 
so in order to fix it permanently you'd
have<00:02:43.040> to<00:02:43.220> take<00:02:43.430> this<00:02:43.670> apart<00:02:44.030> and<00:02:44.360> clean<00:02:44.750> off

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
have to take this apart and clean off

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:46.690 
have to take this apart and clean off
the<00:02:45.200> contacts<00:02:45.769> under<00:02:46.130> the<00:02:46.250> right<00:02:46.459> trigger

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
the contacts under the right trigger

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.240 
the contacts under the right trigger
with<00:02:47.090> like<00:02:47.330> a<00:02:47.569> q-tip<00:02:47.989> and<00:02:48.380> some<00:02:48.560> alcohol<00:02:49.010> get

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
with like a q-tip and some alcohol get

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.030 
with like a q-tip and some alcohol get
the<00:02:49.370> best<00:02:49.580> off<00:02:49.880> clean<00:02:50.569> it<00:02:50.720> up<00:02:50.870> but<00:02:51.680> as<00:02:51.830> I<00:02:52.010> was

don't want to get this model which is
it's<00:03:13.940> too<00:03:14.180> hard<00:03:14.420> it's<00:03:14.600> too<00:03:14.810> small<00:03:15.140> to<00:03:15.319> see<00:03:15.350> here

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:15.769 
it's too hard it's too small to see here

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:18.880 
it's too hard it's too small to see here
and<00:03:15.950> like<00:03:16.820> camera<00:03:17.239> can't<00:03:17.510> focus<00:03:17.780> in<00:03:18.140> on<00:03:18.230> it<00:03:18.410> but

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
and like camera can't focus in on it but

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:20.710 
and like camera can't focus in on it but
basically<00:03:19.040> this<00:03:19.670> model<00:03:20.090> right<00:03:20.209> here<00:03:20.269> is<00:03:20.540> an

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
basically this model right here is an

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.599 
basically this model right here is an
AGS<00:03:21.640> 001<00:03:22.640> and<00:03:23.230> the<00:03:24.230> model<00:03:24.620> you<00:03:24.799> want<00:03:25.010> to<00:03:25.220> get<00:03:25.400> is

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:25.609 
AGS 001 and the model you want to get is

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:29.920 
AGS 001 and the model you want to get is
an<00:03:25.880> AGS<00:03:27.100> 101<00:03:28.100> the<00:03:28.640> reason<00:03:29.030> why<00:03:29.120> I<00:03:29.150> say<00:03:29.510> this<00:03:29.690> is

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
an AGS 101 the reason why I say this is

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:37.560 
an AGS 101 the reason why I say this is
because<00:03:30.459> this<00:03:31.459> game<00:03:31.760> boy<00:03:32.120> that<00:03:32.959> I<00:03:33.109> got<00:03:34.030> has<00:03:35.030> a

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.570 
because this game boy that I got has a

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:41.470 
because this game boy that I got has a
lit<00:03:38.570> screen<00:03:38.959> yes<00:03:39.290> but<00:03:39.950> it<00:03:40.250> is<00:03:40.609> a<00:03:40.640> front<00:03:41.209> lit

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
lit screen yes but it is a front lit

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.410 
lit screen yes but it is a front lit
screen<00:03:41.930> it's<00:03:42.200> not<00:03:42.590> backlit<00:03:43.070> and<00:03:43.640> it<00:03:44.090> kind<00:03:44.329> of

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
screen it's not backlit and it kind of

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.210 
screen it's not backlit and it kind of
fades<00:03:44.630> the<00:03:44.930> color<00:03:45.140> bit<00:03:45.500> and<00:03:45.650> the<00:03:45.739> screen<00:03:46.040> isn't

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
fades the color bit and the screen isn't

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.670 
fades the color bit and the screen isn't
nearly<00:03:46.579> as<00:03:46.760> bright<00:03:47.120> as<00:03:47.359> an<00:03:47.540> actual<00:03:47.959> backlit

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
nearly as bright as an actual backlit

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:56.830 
nearly as bright as an actual backlit
screen<00:03:49.030> so<00:03:50.030> the<00:03:50.750> HS<00:03:51.790> the<00:03:52.790> AGS<00:03:53.980> 101<00:03:54.980> is<00:03:55.690> the<00:03:56.690> one

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
screen so the HS the AGS 101 is the one

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.360 
screen so the HS the AGS 101 is the one
you<00:03:56.959> want<00:03:56.989> to<00:03:57.200> get<00:03:57.319> because<00:03:57.530> it<00:03:57.680> has<00:03:57.769> an<00:03:57.920> actual

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
you want to get because it has an actual

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.030 
you want to get because it has an actual
backlit<00:03:58.850> screen<00:03:59.000> so<00:03:59.780> because<00:04:00.650> this<00:04:00.829> right

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 
backlit screen so because this right

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.069 
backlit screen so because this right
trigger<00:04:01.280> is<00:04:01.400> not<00:04:01.549> working<00:04:01.940> this<00:04:02.540> is<00:04:02.720> actually

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:03.079 
trigger is not working this is actually

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:04.690 
trigger is not working this is actually
a<00:04:03.109> blessing<00:04:03.260> in<00:04:03.590> disguise<00:04:03.620> because<00:04:03.950> I<00:04:04.310> will<00:04:04.609> be
