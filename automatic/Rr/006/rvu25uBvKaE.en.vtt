00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:06.000
 good morning in the first video where the boy you 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.809
 this Wednesday reference training for the 16th we're going to see the 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:12.579
 traffic step 

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:15.449
 He also advocated the return 

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:20.060
 tacuarembó hour 15 miles north of Seoul airfield line with the 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.740
 pipe 1 9 and we do not need to contact at &amp; t because we have authorization to 

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:28.739
 perform our services in professions 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.479
 but it will configure 

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:34.900
 the height indicator of the hd 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.120
 we are going to press to show us continuously the barometric height 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:41.340
 in the main indicator 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.920
 In secondary level, we will show the height on the ground given by the 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.970
 radar time to 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.470
 the public patron requests 1,500 feet on the ground 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.740
 we have to take into account the altitude above the sea level blunt ice in 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.830
 this case is 130 feet to this is added 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:01.610
 at 1500 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.260
 and the homens of 130 pesos barometric October to the plan 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.260
 tito we add what to do during the exercise 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.410
 as we already know 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:14.190
 speed 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.570
 is limited to 300 euros below the 10 thousand pieces 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.590
 so we're not eduardo to the height 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.890
 we line up with blackboard 9 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.890
 and we prepare for him initial that the 1st 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:28.880
 of the circuit 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.510
 and that consists simply 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:33.800
 in sun, fly over the runway longitudinally 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.960
 at one thousand 500 feet and 300 knots 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:49.370
 and it ended up reaching its structure we are almost linear color place 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.430
 after the initial reed we will make the break in this case the right 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.419
 at the most 

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:13.109
 that will rise between all point 5 and 3 0 

00:02:14.149 --> 00:02:14.859
 I want to win 

00:02:14.859 --> 00:02:17.949
 lose speed to enter the tail wind section 

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:20.949
 another 120 and the 140 euros 

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:24.959
 be careful that the break is made 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.959
 level without losing or gaining height 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:33.299
 and that we do not know in a given direction 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:36.499
 to the spicy cases in the track by webber course post 

00:02:37.149 --> 00:02:40.149
 will be 0 1 0 

00:02:49.679 --> 00:02:52.679
 we are already starting the section on parameters 

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:55.379
 300 knots 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:58.549
 1630 thinks 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:01.549
 and fly over the track 

00:03:21.429 --> 00:03:24.339
 we fly over approximately 

00:03:24.339 --> 00:03:27.199
 when going out to the track 

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:31.039
 I seek to see that it disappears test another nose we hope the second 

00:03:32.179 --> 00:03:34.729
 It's good or the project 

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:37.259
 cobos has separated to the see 

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:40.259
 pulling two points and start losing height 

00:03:43.589 --> 00:03:46.819
 we see how the speed goes down 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:49.819
 we are attentive to another rumor exit 0 0 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:58.199
 course knows how to do it 0 

00:03:58.199 --> 00:04:00.609
 we cut a little gas to accelerate 

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:04.089
 and like the tailwind one thousand 330 feet 

00:04:04.089 --> 00:04:07.249
 and entered 120 240 euros 

00:04:07.249 --> 00:04:08.549
 When I love you 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:10.990
 causing the header 

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:12.039
 the right 

00:04:12.039 --> 00:04:15.039
 we dirty the brake 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:21.269
 and three 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:25.139
 I'm afraid a little power to avoid losing height 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:28.139
 and keep 202 

00:04:29.309 --> 00:04:31.280
 and when the header 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.159
 that line with our to the 

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:37.159
 we enter to dance descending turn 

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:39.860
 by train 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:44.310
 of the degree of medicine worked descent came into operation at the speed of 200 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:45.689
 points 

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:48.689
 at 160 

00:04:54.249 --> 00:04:56.760
 we complete the aligned line 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.760
 with fine 

00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:02.699
 we are on a path 

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:05.699
 landing parameters 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:44.630
 we use the fuselage of the plane as arocena martín ramón rivas because 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:47.630
 fell by itself 

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:52.469
 and the 2 to 0 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:57.569
 and that has been the first 5 jotas discuss video 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:00.110
 the passage of traffic
