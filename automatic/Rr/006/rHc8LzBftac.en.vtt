00:00:01.309 --> 00:00:01.319 
now we're going to do a drill it's

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:03.530 
now we're going to do a drill it's
called<00:00:01.589> a<00:00:01.709> bug<00:00:01.949> squish<00:00:02.280> position<00:00:02.909> swing<00:00:03.240> where

feeling<00:00:12.150> their<00:00:12.480> hands<00:00:12.900> working<00:00:13.200> so<00:00:13.799> that<00:00:13.830> they

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
feeling their hands working so that they

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.279 
feeling their hands working so that they
can<00:00:14.460> hit<00:00:14.910> with<00:00:15.150> that<00:00:15.299> solid<00:00:15.660> base<00:00:16.020> and<00:00:16.199> we're

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
can hit with that solid base and we're

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.140 
can hit with that solid base and we're
going<00:00:16.440> to<00:00:16.500> utilize<00:00:16.830> backyard<00:00:17.609> batter<00:00:17.880> in

order<00:00:18.359> to<00:00:18.449> do<00:00:18.630> this<00:00:18.840> drill<00:00:19.140> to<00:00:19.380> establish

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
order to do this drill to establish

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.950 
order to do this drill to establish
muscle<00:00:20.340> memory<00:00:20.670> this<00:00:21.060> will<00:00:21.300> help<00:00:21.480> the<00:00:21.630> kids<00:00:21.840> to

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
muscle memory this will help the kids to

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.080 
muscle memory this will help the kids to
keep<00:00:22.170> the<00:00:22.320> front<00:00:22.529> shoulder<00:00:22.800> closed<00:00:23.340> to<00:00:23.880> stay

ball and to really get them to loosen
their<00:00:28.529> arms<00:00:28.890> this<00:00:29.310> is<00:00:29.369> something<00:00:30.060> that<00:00:30.210> you

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
their arms this is something that you

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.269 
their arms this is something that you
can<00:00:30.480> do<00:00:30.660> with<00:00:30.869> kids<00:00:30.900> who<00:00:31.260> just<00:00:31.529> can't<00:00:31.859> get<00:00:32.099> the

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
can do with kids who just can't get the

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.190 
can do with kids who just can't get the
bottom<00:00:32.640> half<00:00:32.850> they're<00:00:33.180> lunging<00:00:33.780> they're

we're going to get him set he's going to

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.979 
we're going to get him set he's going to
fire<00:00:40.860> into<00:00:41.160> his<00:00:41.309> bug<00:00:41.610> squish<00:00:41.940> position<00:00:42.570> the

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
fire into his bug squish position the

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.779 
fire into his bug squish position the
backyard<00:00:43.530> batter<00:00:43.829> is<00:00:44.010> going<00:00:44.129> to<00:00:44.219> come<00:00:44.489> drop

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
backyard batter is going to come drop

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.190 
backyard batter is going to come drop
the<00:00:45.000> ball<00:00:45.210> he's<00:00:45.450> going<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:45.719> hit<00:00:45.899> it<00:00:46.020> through

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
the ball he's going to hit it through

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.900 
the ball he's going to hit it through
the<00:00:46.320> middle<00:00:46.670> relax

the middle relax

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.690 
the middle relax
squish<00:00:48.660> and<00:00:49.050> then<00:00:49.649> use<00:00:49.890> his<00:00:50.100> hand<00:00:50.370> so<00:00:50.550> we're

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
squish and then use his hand so we're

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.010 
squish and then use his hand so we're
going<00:00:50.789> to<00:00:50.879> show<00:00:51.059> you<00:00:51.090> how<00:00:51.329> to<00:00:51.390> do<00:00:51.600> that<00:00:51.719> drill

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
going to show you how to do that drill

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.970 
going to show you how to do that drill
right<00:00:52.199> now<00:00:52.969> squish<00:00:55.789> good<00:00:56.789> relax

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:57.980 
right now squish good relax

right now squish good relax
squish<00:01:00.109> good<00:01:01.140> so<00:01:01.980> he's<00:01:02.129> hitting<00:01:02.430> with<00:01:02.550> that

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
squish good so he's hitting with that

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.620 
squish good so he's hitting with that
strong<00:01:03.180> fundamentally<00:01:04.019> sound<00:01:04.320> bottom<00:01:04.890> half

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
strong fundamentally sound bottom half

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.660 
strong fundamentally sound bottom half
squishing<00:01:06.630> a<00:01:06.720> little<00:01:06.960> bit<00:01:07.140> early<00:01:07.590> firing<00:01:08.400> into

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
squishing a little bit early firing into

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.330 
squishing a little bit early firing into
that<00:01:08.850> bottom<00:01:09.270> half<00:01:09.540> because<00:01:10.409> his<00:01:10.740> swing<00:01:11.100> and

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
that bottom half because his swing and

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.250 
that bottom half because his swing and
his<00:01:11.520> bug<00:01:11.790> squish<00:01:12.180> want<00:01:12.479> to<00:01:12.570> happen<00:01:12.780> at<00:01:13.140> exactly

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
his bug squish want to happen at exactly

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.010 
his bug squish want to happen at exactly
the<00:01:13.950> same<00:01:14.220> time<00:01:14.610> that's<00:01:15.270> where<00:01:15.600> our<00:01:15.630> power

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
the same time that's where our power

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.080 
the same time that's where our power
comes<00:01:16.500> from<00:01:16.770> our<00:01:16.920> bottom<00:01:17.310> half<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:17.759> our<00:01:17.850> top

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
comes from our bottom half and our top

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.840 
comes from our bottom half and our top
half<00:01:18.420> staying<00:01:18.840> together<00:01:19.290> staying<00:01:20.130> in<00:01:20.430> sync

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
half staying together staying in sync

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.300 
half staying together staying in sync
and<00:01:21.090> this<00:01:21.689> is<00:01:21.840> how<00:01:21.990> we<00:01:22.049> train<00:01:22.560> that<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:23.040> happen

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
and this is how we train that to happen

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.969 
and this is how we train that to happen
and<00:01:23.759> we<00:01:24.180> can<00:01:24.360> get<00:01:24.540> a<00:01:24.570> lot<00:01:24.869> of<00:01:24.900> efficient<00:01:25.619> swings

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
and we can get a lot of efficient swings

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.179 
and we can get a lot of efficient swings
in<00:01:26.310> very<00:01:26.640> quickly<00:01:27.030> very<00:01:27.450> efficiently<00:01:28.189> in

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
in very quickly very efficiently in

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.980 
in very quickly very efficiently in
order<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.610> establish<00:01:30.119> this<00:01:30.270> good<00:01:30.570> muscle

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
order to establish this good muscle

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.749 
order to establish this good muscle
memory<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.439> where<00:01:31.770> you<00:01:31.920> can<00:01:32.100> maximize<00:01:32.729> your

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
memory to where you can maximize your

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.179 
memory to where you can maximize your
power<00:01:33.240> and<00:01:33.720> your<00:01:34.020> ability<00:01:34.530> to<00:01:34.560> put<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:34.979> fat

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
power and your ability to put the fat

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.100 
power and your ability to put the fat
part<00:01:35.430> of<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.549> bat<00:01:35.640> on<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.000> ball<00:01:36.240> increase<00:01:36.930> in

part of the bat on the ball increase in

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.890 
part of the bat on the ball increase in
your<00:01:37.259> batting<00:01:37.650> average<00:01:37.939> add<00:01:38.939> a<00:01:39.000> baby<00:01:39.240> give<00:01:39.810> me

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
your batting average add a baby give me

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.569 
your batting average add a baby give me
some<00:01:40.079> more<00:01:40.229> now<00:01:40.860> we're<00:01:41.040> here<00:01:41.189> with<00:01:41.220> Dylan

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
some more now we're here with Dylan

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.880 
some more now we're here with Dylan
we're<00:01:42.030> gonna<00:01:42.240> take<00:01:42.600> a<00:01:42.630> look<00:01:42.869> at<00:01:43.049> his<00:01:43.290> swing<00:01:43.500> and

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
we're gonna take a look at his swing and

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.710 
we're gonna take a look at his swing and
what<00:01:44.040> I'm<00:01:44.159> gonna<00:01:44.340> do<00:01:44.610> is<00:01:44.729> just<00:01:44.759> have<00:01:45.180> him<00:01:45.479> do

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
what I'm gonna do is just have him do

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.139
