00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.869 
the well I'm calling it light blue it's
sort<00:00:39.930> of<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.200> more<00:00:40.649> teal<00:00:40.950> I<00:00:40.980> think<00:00:41.399> I'd<00:00:41.520> call<00:00:41.700> it

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
sort of a more teal I think I'd call it

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.540 
sort of a more teal I think I'd call it
probably<00:00:42.329> and<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:43.350> cream<00:00:43.710> color<00:00:43.980> which<00:00:44.340> is

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
probably and the cream color which is

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.760 
probably and the cream color which is
sort<00:00:44.850> of<00:00:44.910> everywhere<00:00:45.360> else<00:00:45.570> I've<00:00:46.170> used<00:00:46.530> one

and three quarter yards now the squares

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.290 
and three quarter yards now the squares
here<00:00:49.680> are<00:00:50.039> if<00:00:50.309> it's<00:00:50.460> a<00:00:50.579> plain<00:00:50.789> square<00:00:51.059> it's

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.010 
one and a half inch black on the on the
outside<00:01:10.100> it's<00:01:11.100> quite<00:01:11.880> pleasant<00:01:12.180> I<00:01:12.659> think<00:01:12.900> the

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
outside it's quite pleasant I think the

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.570 
outside it's quite pleasant I think the
way<00:01:13.140> it's<00:01:13.380> come<00:01:13.619> up<00:01:13.770> with<00:01:13.979> these<00:01:14.159> squares

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
way it's come up with these squares

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.070 
way it's come up with these squares
either<00:01:14.880> stars<00:01:15.390> are<00:01:15.570> there<00:01:15.689> I've<00:01:15.780> got<00:01:15.930> both

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
either stars are there I've got both

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.810 
either stars are there I've got both
star<00:01:16.350> they're<00:01:16.619> opposite<00:01:17.130> each<00:01:17.250> other<00:01:17.400> and

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
star they're opposite each other and

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.539 
star they're opposite each other and
then<00:01:18.180> more<00:01:18.390> of<00:01:18.420> a<00:01:18.600> cross<00:01:18.810> type<00:01:19.110> of<00:01:19.549> pattern

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
then more of a cross type of pattern

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.080 
then more of a cross type of pattern
opposite<00:01:20.939> each<00:01:21.090> other<00:01:21.270> I<00:01:21.600> hope<00:01:22.110> you<00:01:22.229> like<00:01:22.380> it

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
opposite each other I hope you like it

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.850 
opposite each other I hope you like it
I've<00:01:24.090> made<00:01:24.150> off<00:01:24.509> square<00:01:24.960> triangles<00:01:25.470> with<00:01:25.680> all

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
I've made off square triangles with all

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.499 
I've made off square triangles with all
the<00:01:26.070> four<00:01:26.310> and<00:01:26.430> seven<00:01:26.610> eighths<00:01:26.850> inch<00:01:27.090> squares

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
the four and seven eighths inch squares

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.620 
the four and seven eighths inch squares
so<00:01:28.170> I<00:01:28.200> placed<00:01:28.680> two<00:01:29.220> squares<00:01:29.610> with<00:01:29.939> right<00:01:30.270> sides

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
so I placed two squares with right sides

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.920 
so I placed two squares with right sides
together<00:01:30.869> and<00:01:31.280> then<00:01:32.280> I<00:01:32.549> drew<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:33.150> line<00:01:33.420> along

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
together and then I drew a line along

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.530 
together and then I drew a line along
one<00:01:34.380> diagonal<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:35.189> so<00:01:35.759> to<00:01:35.820> see<00:01:36.119> in<00:01:36.180> quarter<00:01:36.479> of

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
one diagonal and so to see in quarter of

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.569 
one diagonal and so to see in quarter of
an<00:01:36.630> inch<00:01:36.720> either<00:01:36.990> side<00:01:37.290> of<00:01:37.470> that<00:01:37.619> line<00:01:37.860> then

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
an inch either side of that line then

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.670 
an inch either side of that line then
when<00:01:38.970> you<00:01:39.090> cut<00:01:39.360> along<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:39.840> line<00:01:40.020> you're<00:01:40.409> left

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
when you cut along the line you're left

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.350 
when you cut along the line you're left
with<00:01:40.890> these<00:01:41.100> two<00:01:41.369> triangles<00:01:41.640> which<00:01:42.090> have<00:01:42.329> a

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
with these two triangles which have a

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.440 
with these two triangles which have a
seam<00:01:43.229> along<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.560> base<00:01:43.860> and<00:01:44.189> when<00:01:44.939> you<00:01:45.060> open

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
seam along the base and when you open

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.020 
seam along the base and when you open
these<00:01:45.630> up<00:01:45.869> then<00:01:46.799> they<00:01:47.280> will<00:01:47.490> give<00:01:47.640> you<00:01:47.759> two

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
these up then they will give you two

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.510 
these up then they will give you two
half<00:01:48.420> square<00:01:48.720> triangles<00:01:49.259> and<00:01:49.439> you'll<00:01:50.070> get<00:01:50.280> two

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
half square triangles and you'll get two

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.760 
half square triangles and you'll get two
of<00:01:50.549> these<00:01:50.850> half<00:01:51.149> square<00:01:51.450> triangles<00:01:51.960> from<00:01:52.530> each

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.380 
that and the same happens on each edge
all<00:02:32.530> the<00:02:32.560> way<00:02:32.680> around<00:02:32.800> so<00:02:33.700> now<00:02:33.970> you<00:02:34.030> just<00:02:34.300> need

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
all the way around so now you just need

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.330 
all the way around so now you just need
to<00:02:34.510> sew<00:02:34.810> the<00:02:35.230> squares<00:02:35.500> together<00:02:35.650> across<00:02:36.040> each

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
to sew the squares together across each

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.160 
to sew the squares together across each
row<00:02:36.580> and<00:02:36.880> then<00:02:37.060> sew<00:02:37.300> all<00:02:37.450> the<00:02:37.480> rows<00:02:37.720> to<00:02:38.020> each

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
row and then sew all the rows to each

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.210 
row and then sew all the rows to each
other<00:02:39.239> this<00:02:40.239> is<00:02:40.480> one<00:02:40.660> completed<00:02:41.230> Indian<00:02:41.920> style

out in three rows of three as usual
there<00:02:54.520> are<00:02:54.610> several<00:02:54.820> different<00:02:55.239> options<00:02:55.390> and

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
there are several different options and

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:58.560 
there are several different options and
this<00:02:56.350> one<00:02:56.620> here<00:02:56.920> I've<00:02:57.340> got<00:02:57.700> all<00:02:58.030> the<00:02:58.239> blocks

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
this one here I've got all the blocks

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.810 
this one here I've got all the blocks
facing<00:02:59.050> in<00:02:59.170> the<00:02:59.230> same<00:02:59.470> way<00:02:59.739> so<00:03:00.310> we'll<00:03:00.489> the<00:03:00.610> dark

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
facing in the same way so we'll the dark

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.270 
facing in the same way so we'll the dark
blue<00:03:01.090> stripes<00:03:01.690> go<00:03:01.959> across<00:03:02.170> that<00:03:02.260> diagonal<00:03:02.890> and

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
blue stripes go across that diagonal and

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.880 
blue stripes go across that diagonal and
all<00:03:03.850> the<00:03:04.030> light<00:03:04.690> blue<00:03:04.989> go<00:03:05.230> across<00:03:05.500> the<00:03:05.770> other

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
all the light blue go across the other

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.160 
all the light blue go across the other
diagonal<00:03:06.310> and<00:03:06.700> that<00:03:07.360> gives<00:03:07.630> quite<00:03:07.810> a<00:03:07.930> nice

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
diagonal and that gives quite a nice

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.270 
diagonal and that gives quite a nice
regular<00:03:08.910> pattern<00:03:10.110> an<00:03:11.110> alternate<00:03:11.739> layout<00:03:12.040> is

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
regular pattern an alternate layout is

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.430 
regular pattern an alternate layout is
to<00:03:12.580> rotate<00:03:12.820> the<00:03:13.060> block<00:03:13.450> so<00:03:13.780> that<00:03:13.930> in<00:03:14.230> the

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
to rotate the block so that in the

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.410 
to rotate the block so that in the
left-hand<00:03:15.190> block<00:03:15.400> there<00:03:15.640> I've<00:03:15.790> got<00:03:16.000> the<00:03:16.150> dark

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
left-hand block there I've got the dark

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.539 
left-hand block there I've got the dark
going<00:03:16.840> down<00:03:17.019> that<00:03:17.200> diagonal<00:03:17.620> but<00:03:18.280> in<00:03:18.430> the

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:18.549 
going down that diagonal but in the

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:20.220 
going down that diagonal but in the
block<00:03:18.700> next<00:03:18.910> to<00:03:19.150> it<00:03:19.330> I've<00:03:19.540> got<00:03:19.720> it<00:03:19.750> going<00:03:20.080> up

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
block next to it I've got it going up

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.320 
block next to it I've got it going up
the<00:03:20.380> other<00:03:20.530> diagonal<00:03:20.920> and<00:03:21.340> then<00:03:21.820> in<00:03:21.970> the<00:03:22.090> third

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.330 
the other diagonal and then in the third

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.060 
the other diagonal and then in the third
block<00:03:22.480> I've<00:03:22.750> got<00:03:22.900> it<00:03:23.019> coming<00:03:23.170> down<00:03:23.470> again<00:03:23.650> same

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
block I've got it coming down again same

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:26.670 
block I've got it coming down again same
as<00:03:24.100> the<00:03:24.340> first<00:03:24.690> and<00:03:25.690> doing<00:03:25.930> it<00:03:26.049> this<00:03:26.200> way<00:03:26.260> you

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
as the first and doing it this way you

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.050 
as the first and doing it this way you
actually<00:03:26.860> end<00:03:27.220> up<00:03:27.310> with<00:03:27.519> some<00:03:27.700> quite<00:03:27.880> nice

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
actually end up with some quite nice

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.729 
actually end up with some quite nice
patterns<00:03:28.570> there<00:03:28.780> you've<00:03:28.959> got<00:03:28.989> a<00:03:29.170> star<00:03:29.470> there

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
patterns there you've got a star there

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:32.190 
patterns there you've got a star there
in<00:03:29.950> the<00:03:30.070> light<00:03:30.250> blue<00:03:30.459> and<00:03:30.790> across<00:03:31.600> in<00:03:31.870> the<00:03:31.989> dark

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
in the light blue and across in the dark

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.620 
in the light blue and across in the dark
blue<00:03:32.410> and<00:03:32.739> I<00:03:33.280> think<00:03:33.790> this<00:03:33.910> is<00:03:34.060> probably<00:03:34.209> the

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
blue and I think this is probably the

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:36.840 
blue and I think this is probably the
layout<00:03:34.900> that<00:03:35.080> I<00:03:35.140> will<00:03:35.380> go<00:03:35.530> with<00:03:35.739> so<00:03:35.980> the<00:03:36.640> blocks

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
layout that I will go with so the blocks

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:38.820 
layout that I will go with so the blocks
together<00:03:37.060> across<00:03:37.630> each<00:03:37.930> row<00:03:38.260> and<00:03:38.530> then<00:03:38.709> you

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:38.830 
together across each row and then you

in two and a half inch intervals so that

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.890 
in two and a half inch intervals so that
I'm<00:05:02.080> creating<00:05:02.350> these<00:05:02.890> strips<00:05:03.280> which<00:05:03.520> are<00:05:03.900> four

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:04.900 
I'm creating these strips which are four

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:06.930 
I'm creating these strips which are four
half<00:05:05.169> inches<00:05:05.650> that<00:05:05.890> way<00:05:06.100> and<00:05:06.460> two<00:05:06.669> and<00:05:06.790> a<00:05:06.820> half

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:06.940 
half inches that way and two and a half

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:08.970 
half inches that way and two and a half
inches<00:05:07.300> across<00:05:07.600> and<00:05:07.960> I'm<00:05:08.380> going<00:05:08.590> to<00:05:08.680> cut<00:05:08.860> the

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:08.980 
inches across and I'm going to cut the

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:11.969 
inches across and I'm going to cut the
whole<00:05:09.010> strip<00:05:09.430> up<00:05:09.580> like<00:05:09.820> that<00:05:10.350> then<00:05:11.350> when<00:05:11.710> I<00:05:11.740> get

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:11.979 
whole strip up like that then when I get

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:15.360 
whole strip up like that then when I get
two<00:05:12.220> of<00:05:12.250> these<00:05:12.580> and<00:05:13.140> rotate<00:05:14.140> one<00:05:14.410> of<00:05:14.590> them<00:05:14.770> so

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:15.370 
two of these and rotate one of them so

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.790 
two of these and rotate one of them so
that<00:05:15.580> those<00:05:15.910> are<00:05:16.150> the<00:05:16.240> two<00:05:16.660> they<00:05:17.410> were<00:05:17.470> cut

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:17.800 
that those are the two they were cut

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.130 
that those are the two they were cut
from<00:05:18.010> the<00:05:18.220> strip's<00:05:18.520> and<00:05:18.760> if<00:05:19.330> I<00:05:19.450> rotate<00:05:19.660> those

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:20.140 
from the strip's and if I rotate those

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:22.710 
from the strip's and if I rotate those
they're<00:05:20.680> blacks<00:05:21.640> they're<00:05:21.910> not<00:05:22.060> diagonally

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:22.720 
they're blacks they're not diagonally

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:23.909 
they're blacks they're not diagonally
opposite<00:05:22.990> each<00:05:23.140> other<00:05:23.350> and<00:05:23.560> so<00:05:23.740> are<00:05:23.860> the

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:23.919 
opposite each other and so are the

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:26.370 
opposite each other and so are the
Browns<00:05:24.160> and<00:05:24.490> if<00:05:25.060> I<00:05:25.150> saw<00:05:25.390> that<00:05:25.600> pair<00:05:25.900> to<00:05:26.140> that

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:26.380 
Browns and if I saw that pair to that

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:28.680 
Browns and if I saw that pair to that
pair<00:05:26.650> that<00:05:27.160> gives<00:05:27.400> me<00:05:27.580> the<00:05:27.700> four<00:05:27.850> patches<00:05:28.060> so

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:28.690 
pair that gives me the four patches so

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:31.500
