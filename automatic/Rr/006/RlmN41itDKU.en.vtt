inverted<00:00:19.070> or<00:00:19.250> 360<00:00:19.760> we're<00:00:20.150> gonna<00:00:20.300> end<00:00:20.510> up<00:00:20.599> with

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:20.660 
inverted or 360 we're gonna end up with

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.779 
inverted or 360 we're gonna end up with
two<00:00:20.960> progressions<00:00:21.529> the<00:00:21.680> one<00:00:21.830> from<00:00:22.039> the<00:00:22.130> bar

and one on the ground as usual we're
gonna<00:00:31.640> break<00:00:31.880> this<00:00:32.029> down<00:00:32.090> into<00:00:32.420> few<00:00:32.720> easy

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:32.930 
gonna break this down into few easy

like this after that the whole body
going<00:00:53.120> to<00:00:53.239> spin<00:00:53.449> into<00:00:53.660> the<00:00:53.870> right<00:00:54.050> side<00:00:54.350> and

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 
going to spin into the right side and

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:56.950 
going to spin into the right side and
you're<00:00:55.010> going<00:00:55.430> right<00:00:55.609> on<00:00:55.850> the<00:00:55.940> handstand<00:00:56.300> so

push sauce forward like this after that

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.080 
push sauce forward like this after that
the<00:01:09.350> whole<00:01:09.530> body<00:01:09.770> got<00:01:10.130> a<00:01:10.190> spin<00:01:10.460> into<00:01:10.700> the<00:01:10.820> right

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
the whole body got a spin into the right

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:12.970 
the whole body got a spin into the right
side<00:01:11.360> and<00:01:11.570> you're<00:01:12.020> going<00:01:12.350> right<00:01:12.680> on<00:01:12.890> the

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:12.980

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:18.050 
handstand after getting into the

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:19.960 
handstand after getting into the
handstand<00:01:18.320> position<00:01:18.560> all<00:01:19.100> you<00:01:19.340> need<00:01:19.490> to<00:01:19.610> do<00:01:19.760> is

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
handstand position all you need to do is

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.870 
handstand position all you need to do is
bend<00:01:20.210> your<00:01:20.480> left<00:01:21.200> arm<00:01:21.530> like<00:01:21.950> this<00:01:21.980> and<00:01:22.370> after

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
bend your left arm like this and after

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.520 
bend your left arm like this and after
that<00:01:23.150> do<00:01:23.510> the<00:01:23.540> roll<00:01:23.840> over<00:01:24.020> your<00:01:24.230> left<00:01:24.440> shoulder

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
that do the roll over your left shoulder

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:36.709 
that do the roll over your left shoulder
take<00:01:25.130> a<00:01:25.160> look<00:01:25.340> at

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:36.719 

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:38.539 

the<00:01:37.079> technique<00:01:37.439> of<00:01:37.560> our<00:01:37.679> second<00:01:38.189> step<00:01:38.340> is

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
the technique of our second step is

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.279 
the technique of our second step is
pretty<00:01:38.759> simple<00:01:39.119> instead<00:01:39.780> of<00:01:39.899> doing<00:01:40.140> the

00:01:40.279 --> 00:01:40.289 
pretty simple instead of doing the

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:42.319 
pretty simple instead of doing the
handstands<00:01:40.920> we're<00:01:41.159> doing<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.759> roll<00:01:41.909> over<00:01:42.210> our

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
handstands we're doing the roll over our

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:43.940 
handstands we're doing the roll over our
left<00:01:42.539> shoulder<00:01:42.659> so<00:01:43.439> it's<00:01:43.590> going<00:01:43.710> to<00:01:43.799> look<00:01:43.890> like

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
left shoulder so it's going to look like

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.219 
left shoulder so it's going to look like
this<00:01:44.249> we're<00:01:44.789> running<00:01:45.060> on<00:01:45.149> our<00:01:45.420> left<00:01:45.719> leg

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
this we're running on our left leg

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.709 
this we're running on our left leg
we're<00:01:46.859> kicking<00:01:47.130> with<00:01:47.399> our<00:01:47.549> right<00:01:47.909> leg<00:01:47.939> during

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:48.719 
we're kicking with our right leg during

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:50.809 
we're kicking with our right leg during
the<00:01:48.929> spin<00:01:49.229> and<00:01:49.409> after<00:01:50.100> that<00:01:50.219> we're<00:01:50.520> bending

00:01:50.809 --> 00:01:50.819 
the spin and after that we're bending

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:54.139 
the spin and after that we're bending
our<00:01:51.209> left<00:01:51.659> arm<00:01:51.929> like<00:01:52.649> this<00:01:52.679> and<00:01:53.130> after<00:01:53.880> that

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
our left arm like this and after that

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.149 
our left arm like this and after that
we're<00:01:54.390> going<00:01:54.659> to<00:01:54.990> do<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.319> roll<00:01:55.500> over<00:01:55.829> our<00:01:55.859> left

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
we're going to do the roll over our left

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:03.160 
we're going to do the roll over our left
shoulder<00:01:56.280> take<00:01:56.909> a<00:01:56.939> look<00:01:57.179> at<00:01:57.270> this<00:01:57.359> example

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.539 

we're<00:02:04.170> starting<00:02:04.500> with<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:04.709> left<00:02:04.920> leg<00:02:05.039> and<00:02:05.369> our

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
we're starting with the left leg and our

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.029 
we're starting with the left leg and our
right<00:02:05.819> leg<00:02:06.060> goes<00:02:06.420> up<00:02:06.719> the<00:02:07.259> whole<00:02:07.439> body<00:02:07.679> spins

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
right leg goes up the whole body spins

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.229 
right leg goes up the whole body spins
over<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.580> right<00:02:08.759> shoulder

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
over the right shoulder

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.990 
over the right shoulder
we're<00:02:09.869> going<00:02:10.229> straight<00:02:10.379> onto<00:02:10.829> our<00:02:11.099> arms<00:02:11.519> and

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
we're going straight onto our arms and

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.970 
we're going straight onto our arms and
after<00:02:12.239> that<00:02:12.390> so<00:02:12.629> we're<00:02:12.870> bending<00:02:13.440> our<00:02:13.590> left

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
after that so we're bending our left

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.830 
after that so we're bending our left
elbow<00:02:14.250> and<00:02:14.579> do<00:02:14.790> the<00:02:14.940> roll<00:02:15.120> over<00:02:15.329> our<00:02:15.450> left

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
elbow and do the roll over our left

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.190 
elbow and do the roll over our left
shoulder<00:02:16.260> now<00:02:17.480> let's<00:02:18.480> talk<00:02:18.569> about<00:02:18.629> the<00:02:18.930> basic

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
shoulder now let's talk about the basic

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.050 
shoulder now let's talk about the basic
mistakes<00:02:19.530> the<00:02:19.950> very<00:02:20.129> common<00:02:20.430> mistake<00:02:20.579> is<00:02:20.910> when

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
mistakes the very common mistake is when

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.369 
mistakes the very common mistake is when
people<00:02:21.239> falling<00:02:21.720> on<00:02:21.870> their<00:02:22.049> left<00:02:22.230> side

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379 
people falling on their left side

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:24.890 
people falling on their left side
instead<00:02:22.920> of<00:02:23.160> doing<00:02:23.640> the<00:02:23.970> roll<00:02:24.360> over<00:02:24.510> the<00:02:24.720> left

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
instead of doing the roll over the left

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:25.309 
instead of doing the roll over the left
shoulder

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
shoulder

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.770 
shoulder
this<00:02:25.860> happens<00:02:26.280> when<00:02:26.549> you're<00:02:26.760> not<00:02:27.060> skiing<00:02:27.390> hard

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
this happens when you're not skiing hard

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.930 
this happens when you're not skiing hard
enough<00:02:27.959> with<00:02:28.170> your<00:02:28.290> light<00:02:28.530> leg<00:02:28.769> right<00:02:29.099> leg<00:02:29.280> so

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
enough with your light leg right leg so

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.960 
enough with your light leg right leg so
to<00:02:30.329> avoid<00:02:30.569> this<00:02:30.780> try<00:02:31.440> to<00:02:31.500> kick<00:02:31.859> as<00:02:32.220> hard<00:02:32.819> as

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
to avoid this try to kick as hard as

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:39.589 
to avoid this try to kick as hard as
possible<00:02:33.450> like<00:02:34.170> this<00:02:38.090> this<00:02:39.090> will<00:02:39.299> give<00:02:39.480> you

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
possible like this this will give you

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:41.750 
possible like this this will give you
enough<00:02:39.629> rotation<00:02:40.379> speed<00:02:40.709> to<00:02:41.010> come<00:02:41.250> over<00:02:41.579> your

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
enough rotation speed to come over your

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:42.379 
enough rotation speed to come over your
left<00:02:41.940> shoulder

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:42.389 
left shoulder

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:44.599 
left shoulder
also<00:02:43.319> remember<00:02:43.530> to<00:02:43.829> put<00:02:43.980> your<00:02:44.010> arms<00:02:44.430> and

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:44.609 
also remember to put your arms and

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:46.520 
also remember to put your arms and
placed<00:02:44.880> in<00:02:45.120> the<00:02:45.239> same<00:02:45.510> spot<00:02:45.870> where<00:02:46.349> you're

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
placed in the same spot where you're

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.979 
placed in the same spot where you're
taking<00:02:46.709> off<00:02:47.010> with<00:02:47.190> your<00:02:47.310> left<00:02:47.519> do<00:02:48.450> not<00:02:48.480> do<00:02:48.840> it

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
taking off with your left do not do it

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:55.580 
taking off with your left do not do it
like<00:02:49.019> this<00:02:53.510> so<00:02:54.510> by<00:02:54.720> combining<00:02:54.959> techniques

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
like this so by combining techniques

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.110 
like this so by combining techniques
from<00:02:55.829> our<00:02:55.980> previous<00:02:56.190> steps<00:02:56.609> we're<00:02:56.849> going<00:02:57.030> to

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
from our previous steps we're going to

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.970 
from our previous steps we're going to
end<00:02:57.209> up<00:02:57.359> with<00:02:57.840> the<00:02:57.989> great<00:02:58.230> invert<00:02:58.650> roll<00:02:58.829> for

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
end up with the great invert roll for

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.009 
end up with the great invert roll for
sixth<00:02:59.220> on<00:02:59.340> the<00:02:59.459> ground<00:02:59.669> and<00:02:59.910> now<00:03:00.540> let's<00:03:00.810> find

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
sixth on the ground and now let's find

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:03.409 
sixth on the ground and now let's find
out<00:03:01.169> how<00:03:01.440> to<00:03:01.500> do<00:03:01.769> it<00:03:01.889> from<00:03:02.220> the<00:03:02.340> bar<00:03:02.519> the

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:03.419 
out how to do it from the bar the

00:03:03.419 --> 00:03:04.789 
out how to do it from the bar the
technique<00:03:03.720> of<00:03:03.870> doing<00:03:03.989> this<00:03:04.139> from<00:03:04.319> the<00:03:04.500> bar<00:03:04.650> is

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:04.799 
technique of doing this from the bar is

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:06.229 
technique of doing this from the bar is
pretty<00:03:04.950> similar<00:03:05.310> to<00:03:05.459> what<00:03:05.609> we<00:03:05.849> did<00:03:06.000> on<00:03:06.030> the

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
pretty similar to what we did on the

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:09.199 
pretty similar to what we did on the
flat<00:03:06.450> so<00:03:07.109> here's<00:03:07.380> what<00:03:07.560> we<00:03:07.680> need<00:03:07.799> to<00:03:07.889> do<00:03:08.209> we're

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
flat so here's what we need to do we're

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:11.000 
flat so here's what we need to do we're
getting<00:03:09.690> into<00:03:10.019> the<00:03:10.109> position<00:03:10.500> like<00:03:10.620> this<00:03:10.799> and

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
getting into the position like this and

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.909 
getting into the position like this and
after<00:03:11.910> that<00:03:12.030> our<00:03:12.299> right<00:03:12.630> arm<00:03:12.900> tries<00:03:13.560> to<00:03:13.769> reach

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:13.919 
after that our right arm tries to reach

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:16.640 
after that our right arm tries to reach
the<00:03:14.069> ground<00:03:14.329> like<00:03:15.329> this<00:03:15.540> so<00:03:16.290> where<00:03:16.500> are<00:03:16.620> we

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
the ground like this so where are we

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.339 
the ground like this so where are we
going<00:03:16.889> forward<00:03:17.400> we're<00:03:18.150> letting<00:03:18.810> go<00:03:18.959> our<00:03:19.139> right

00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:19.349 
going forward we're letting go our right

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:28.720 
going forward we're letting go our right
arm<00:03:19.590> and<00:03:19.799> it<00:03:20.160> tries<00:03:20.459> to<00:03:20.489> reach<00:03:21.000> the<00:03:21.180> ground

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.129 

just<00:03:29.730> understand<00:03:30.239> the<00:03:30.389> following<00:03:30.750> technique

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:31.139 
just understand the following technique

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:33.090 
just understand the following technique
all<00:03:31.650> you<00:03:31.769> have<00:03:31.919> to<00:03:32.040> do<00:03:32.160> is<00:03:32.340> match

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100 
all you have to do is match

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.460 
all you have to do is match
during<00:03:33.340> the<00:03:33.460> same<00:03:33.730> inverter<00:03:34.240> office<00:03:34.600> 6<00:03:34.810> do

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
during the same inverter office 6 do

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.250 
during the same inverter office 6 do
like<00:03:35.620> this

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.330 

so<00:03:40.260> as<00:03:40.379> you<00:03:40.470> see<00:03:40.620> you<00:03:40.650> can<00:03:40.800> help<00:03:41.129> with<00:03:41.310> your

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
so as you see you can help with your

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.729 
so as you see you can help with your
legs<00:03:41.730> to<00:03:42.120> do<00:03:42.239> this<00:03:42.360> move<00:03:42.569> let's<00:03:42.989> do<00:03:43.170> it<00:03:43.260> again

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:45.739 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:48.199 

we're<00:03:46.739> holding<00:03:47.099> our<00:03:47.220> arms<00:03:47.519> on<00:03:47.670> the<00:03:47.760> bar<00:03:47.909> and

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
we're holding our arms on the bar and

00:03:48.209 --> 00:04:02.960 
we're holding our arms on the bar and
then<00:03:48.599> our<00:03:48.900> legs<00:03:49.230> help<00:03:49.590> us<00:04:00.950> and<00:04:01.950> after<00:04:02.160> that<00:04:02.459> try

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
then our legs help us and after that try

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.930 
then our legs help us and after that try
to<00:04:03.000> do<00:04:03.239> it<00:04:03.390> without<00:04:03.569> your<00:04:03.930> legs<00:04:04.640> first<00:04:05.640> of<00:04:05.819> all

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
to do it without your legs first of all

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.339 
to do it without your legs first of all
we're<00:04:06.090> putting<00:04:06.360> our<00:04:06.480> arms<00:04:06.599> on<00:04:06.900> the<00:04:06.989> bar<00:04:07.140> and

00:04:07.339 --> 00:04:07.349 
we're putting our arms on the bar and

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:09.410 
we're putting our arms on the bar and
starting<00:04:07.680> to<00:04:07.799> swing<00:04:08.040> after<00:04:08.819> that<00:04:09.209> we're

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
starting to swing after that we're

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.509 
starting to swing after that we're
letting<00:04:09.599> go<00:04:09.870> our<00:04:10.019> right<00:04:10.230> arm<00:04:10.500> and<00:04:10.709> our<00:04:11.010> legs<00:04:11.280> go

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 
letting go our right arm and our legs go

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:13.520 
letting go our right arm and our legs go
up<00:04:11.760> then<00:04:12.420> when<00:04:12.690> we<00:04:12.870> reach<00:04:13.019> the<00:04:13.170> ground<00:04:13.379> with

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
up then when we reach the ground with

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.159 
up then when we reach the ground with
our<00:04:13.560> arms<00:04:14.129> we<00:04:14.700> plant<00:04:15.030> our<00:04:15.239> left<00:04:15.540> elbow<00:04:15.750> and

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
our arms we plant our left elbow and

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:18.819 
our arms we plant our left elbow and
during<00:04:16.620> the<00:04:16.769> roll<00:04:16.919> over<00:04:17.100> the<00:04:17.310> left<00:04:17.489> shoulder

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:18.829 
during the roll over the left shoulder

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:21.080 
during the roll over the left shoulder
well<00:04:19.829> basically<00:04:20.070> that's<00:04:20.400> it<00:04:20.549> for<00:04:20.699> today<00:04:20.910> I
