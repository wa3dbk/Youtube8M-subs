00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:13.730 
this off so I couldn't uh put a new
gasket<00:00:09.559> behind<00:00:10.559> here<00:00:12.200> this<00:00:13.200> plate<00:00:13.469> right<00:00:13.650> here

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
gasket behind here this plate right here

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.010 
gasket behind here this plate right here
actually<00:00:14.040> is<00:00:14.549> not<00:00:14.790> connected<00:00:15.299> to<00:00:15.330> you<00:00:15.509> or<00:00:15.839> not

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
actually is not connected to you or not

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.599 
actually is not connected to you or not
welded<00:00:16.440> onto<00:00:16.560> the<00:00:16.680> engine<00:00:16.949> it's<00:00:17.100> connected<00:00:17.580> by

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
welded onto the engine it's connected by

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.890 
welded onto the engine it's connected by
a<00:00:17.730> couple<00:00:18.060> bolts<00:00:18.449> right<00:00:19.439> here<00:00:20.510> here<00:00:21.510> and

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
a couple bolts right here here and

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.230 
a couple bolts right here here and
there's<00:00:22.410> another<00:00:22.650> one<00:00:22.769> back<00:00:22.980> here<00:00:23.990> and<00:00:26.240> in

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
there's another one back here and in

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.779 
there's another one back here and in
order<00:00:27.539> for<00:00:27.570> me<00:00:27.810> to<00:00:27.840> do<00:00:27.960> that<00:00:28.140> I<00:00:28.170> have<00:00:28.470> to<00:00:28.789> loosen

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
order for me to do that I have to loosen

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:36.819 
order for me to do that I have to loosen
up<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.420> caps<00:00:31.140> on<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.940> crankshaft

00:00:36.819 --> 00:00:36.829 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:41.180 

which<00:00:37.829> I<00:00:37.950> did<00:00:38.160> loosen<00:00:38.820> them<00:00:38.969> up<00:00:39.090> and<00:00:40.190> the

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
which I did loosen them up and the

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.790 
which I did loosen them up and the
reason<00:00:41.550> why<00:00:41.670> is<00:00:41.730> because<00:00:41.940> I<00:00:42.629> have<00:00:43.410> to<00:00:43.559> pull

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
reason why is because I have to pull

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.010 
reason why is because I have to pull
these<00:00:44.070> two<00:00:44.340> gears<00:00:44.550> apart<00:00:45.260> to<00:00:46.579> pull<00:00:47.579> out<00:00:48.020> the

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
these two gears apart to pull out the

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.389 
these two gears apart to pull out the
camshaft<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:50.960> then<00:00:51.960> I<00:00:52.289> can<00:00:52.739> take<00:00:52.890> this<00:00:53.100> plate

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
camshaft and then I can take this plate

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.189 
camshaft and then I can take this plate
off<00:00:53.610> and<00:00:54.680> put<00:00:55.680> on<00:00:55.710> a<00:00:55.860> new<00:00:56.250> gasket<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:57.210> the

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
off and put on a new gasket and the

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.139 
off and put on a new gasket and the
right<00:00:58.379> Siller<00:00:58.739> so<00:00:59.010> it<00:00:59.100> doesn't<00:00:59.309> leak<00:00:59.489> oil<00:01:00.140> well

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:02.149 
right Siller so it doesn't leak oil well

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:06.280 
right Siller so it doesn't leak oil well
while<00:01:03.149> I<00:01:03.180> was<00:01:03.500> doing<00:01:04.500> that<00:01:04.830> I<00:01:05.159> was<00:01:05.549> checking

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
while I was doing that I was checking

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:13.490 
while I was doing that I was checking
the<00:01:07.290> bearings<00:01:07.760> and<00:01:11.420> this<00:01:12.420> one<00:01:12.689> you'll<00:01:13.350> see

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
the bearings and this one you'll see

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:21.350 
the bearings and this one you'll see
right<00:01:13.680> now<00:01:13.890> is<00:01:15.740> really<00:01:16.740> bad<00:01:17.930> so<00:01:19.939> I'm<00:01:20.939> not<00:01:21.150> going

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
right now is really bad so I'm not going

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.260 
right now is really bad so I'm not going
to<00:01:21.450> drive<00:01:21.990> this<00:01:22.140> engine<00:01:22.560> anymore<00:01:22.920> if<00:01:23.130> you<00:01:23.340> see

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
to drive this engine anymore if you see

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.510 
to drive this engine anymore if you see
right<00:01:24.420> here<00:01:26.360> see<00:01:27.360> all<00:01:27.390> those<00:01:27.689> lines<00:01:28.520> that's

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
right here see all those lines that's

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.280 
right here see all those lines that's
pretty<00:01:29.729> bad<00:01:30.000> Oh

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:43.670 

so<00:01:36.890> and<00:01:37.890> now<00:01:41.420> boats<00:01:42.420> on<00:01:42.960> out<00:01:43.170> we're<00:01:43.440> getting

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
so and now boats on out we're getting

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:50.570 
so and now boats on out we're getting
some<00:01:43.860> light<00:01:44.040> here<00:01:45.440> and<00:01:48.620> see<00:01:49.620> all<00:01:49.650> that<00:01:49.890> gold

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 
some light here and see all that gold

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.400 
some light here and see all that gold
it's<00:01:51.270> not<00:01:51.480> supposed<00:01:51.750> to<00:01:51.780> be<00:01:51.900> gold

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:52.410 
it's not supposed to be gold

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:55.850 
it's not supposed to be gold
it's<00:01:53.100> supposed<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.430> be<00:01:53.520> silver<00:01:53.820> and<00:01:54.860> really

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
it's supposed to be silver and really

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.960 
it's supposed to be silver and really
smooth<00:01:58.820> that's<00:01:59.820> how<00:02:00.030> bad<00:02:00.390> it's<00:02:00.630> worn<00:02:00.930> down<00:02:01.020> and

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 
smooth that's how bad it's worn down and

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.570 
smooth that's how bad it's worn down and
look<00:02:02.970> there<00:02:03.150> on<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.330> side<00:02:03.540> you<00:02:03.750> see<00:02:03.930> that<00:02:04.580> melt

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
look there on the side you see that melt

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:11.470 
look there on the side you see that melt
it<00:02:05.790> down<00:02:05.820> all<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.510> silver<00:02:08.060> it's<00:02:09.060> all<00:02:09.390> melted

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
it down all the silver it's all melted

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.900 
it down all the silver it's all melted
so<00:02:13.010> these<00:02:14.010> are<00:02:14.250> bad

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
so these are bad

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.500 
so these are bad
and<00:02:15.860> they're<00:02:16.860> ready<00:02:17.160> I<00:02:17.520> think<00:02:17.610> they're<00:02:18.180> 30

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
and they're ready I think they're 30

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.630 
and they're ready I think they're 30
over<00:02:19.670> which<00:02:20.670> means<00:02:21.030> they're<00:02:21.480> wider<00:02:22.640> because

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
over which means they're wider because

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.910 
over which means they're wider because
because<00:02:25.190> this<00:02:27.110> crankshaft<00:02:28.110> was<00:02:28.320> already<00:02:28.620> cut

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
because this crankshaft was already cut

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:37.130 
because this crankshaft was already cut
down<00:02:29.480> from<00:02:30.480> being<00:02:30.720> rebuilt<00:02:31.730> so<00:02:33.860> if<00:02:34.860> I<00:02:36.020> if<00:02:37.020> I

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
down from being rebuilt so if I if I

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.810 
down from being rebuilt so if I if I
take<00:02:37.170> it<00:02:37.500> in<00:02:37.620> to<00:02:37.740> get<00:02:37.890> that<00:02:37.920> ground<00:02:38.310> down<00:02:38.459> again

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
take it in to get that ground down again

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.270 
take it in to get that ground down again
I<00:02:38.850> might<00:02:39.180> have<00:02:39.510> to<00:02:39.690> go<00:02:39.810> 40<00:02:40.260> over<00:02:40.530> if<00:02:40.620> they<00:02:40.770> do<00:02:40.830> 40

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
I might have to go 40 over if they do 40

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:49.040 
I might have to go 40 over if they do 40
over<00:02:41.610> and<00:02:41.880> I'm<00:02:42.000> not<00:02:42.150> sure<00:02:44.690> so<00:02:47.600> this<00:02:48.600> is<00:02:48.780> a<00:02:48.810> big

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
over and I'm not sure so this is a big

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.170 
over and I'm not sure so this is a big
problem<00:02:49.350> I've<00:02:49.890> already<00:02:50.190> put<00:02:50.400> a<00:02:50.430> lot<00:02:50.790> of<00:02:51.030> money

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
problem I've already put a lot of money

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.229 
problem I've already put a lot of money
into<00:02:51.510> this<00:02:51.630> engine<00:02:52.050> I<00:02:52.820> matter<00:02:53.820> of<00:02:53.910> fact<00:02:54.090> I<00:02:54.209> even

just bought the electronic distributor

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.080 
just bought the electronic distributor
for<00:03:00.930> it<00:03:01.080> which<00:03:01.920> cost<00:03:02.190> me<00:03:02.400> about<00:03:02.519> a<00:03:02.670> hundred<00:03:03.000> and

leaking and now in order for me to pull
out<00:03:59.030> this<00:03:59.470> crankshaft<00:04:00.470> I<00:04:00.680> have<00:04:00.829> to<00:04:00.980> pull<00:04:01.189> off

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.380 
out this crankshaft I have to pull off
the<00:04:01.459> head<00:04:01.640> so<00:04:02.299> I<00:04:02.329> can<00:04:02.569> pull<00:04:02.780> down<00:04:02.930> the<00:04:03.230> Pistons

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:04.390 
the head so I can pull down the Pistons

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:09.210
