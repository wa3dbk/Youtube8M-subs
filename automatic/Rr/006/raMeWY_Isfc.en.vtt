00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.690
 day goes by 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.450
 meeting greetings work 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:43.590
 it seems in that uniform course 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.100
 events can not prevent 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.790
 but one comes 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:50.680
 she can be exhausting 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:51.840
 intolerable 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.070
 she doesn't let work four is decided on 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.510
 each of us dating and almost 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:58.390
 of all 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:59.760
 at least once in a lifetime 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.510
 there was pain in the back and left-handers 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.930
 tel 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.040
 the most common causes of back pain 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.230
 overgrow muscles by doing 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.910
 unprepared motion damage 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:16.910
 muscles with increased load 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.030
 exposure to excessive or high 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.760
 low temperature 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.580

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.460
 later 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.640
 more often 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.280
 back pain relatedness through 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.310
 marked increase in muscle tone 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.460
 muscle tone at the same time 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.799
 controlled by both spinal and major 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:43.040
 way 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.410
 muscle tone regulation 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:46.820
 may be broken as a result 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.580
 intense 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.580
 any rallies were to go out 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.350
 this happens by virtue of the following 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.330
 circumstances 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.190
 pain impulse transmissions are wound he 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:00.620
 regulated it was thought that 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.280
 migrants of majestic mountains 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.320

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.040
 function normally 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.780
 after a short 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.920
 pain if which muscle spasm 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.319
 muscle tone is restored 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:16.829
 due to the inhibitory effect of gamma 

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:19.139
 aminobutyric acid 

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:21.099
 but if the pain is intense 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:23.119
 or 

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:25.149
 as intermediate gas reserves 

00:02:25.149 --> 00:02:27.239
 mironov decline 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.010
 as a result even if his and momentum 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.329
 weaken 

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:33.969
 before us we can quickly normalize with him 

00:02:33.969 --> 00:02:36.090
 due to the lack of din 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.860
 does not allow intermediate 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.090

 braked function 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:43.369
 Consequently 

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:45.369
 double vicious circle occurs 

00:02:45.369 --> 00:02:47.719
 pain stimulation 

00:02:47.719 --> 00:02:49.579
 primary damage gives 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:51.379
 the beginning of volitional impulses 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:52.620
 which runs 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.989
 they are clean and special means 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:58.060
 similarly the reaction of the brain to 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.969
 pain pin pulse type of alarm 

00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:03.399
 enhances tonic arousal 

00:03:03.399 --> 00:03:05.699
 increased muscle tone in turn 

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:07.399
 leads to spasm

 Dubovik leads to restriction of movement 

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:16.989
 affected muscles and the adoption of forced

00:03:57.409 --> 00:03:59.229
 drug deficiency 

00:03:59.229 --> 00:04:01.849
 such localization effect of the drug 

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:04.649
 allows you to unlock key view as 

00:04:04.649 --> 00:04:07.229

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:19.379
 and as a consequence of the relief of pain in 

00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:22.059
 back 

00:04:22.059 --> 00:04:24.329
 optimal design by assigning it

 pain reliever 

00:04:26.359 --> 00:04:28.919
 back requires an assessment of severity 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:30.719
 pain syndrome to determine 

00:04:30.719 --> 00:04:33.270
 adequate dosage

00:04:36.349 --> 00:04:38.219
 depending on the state 

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:39.919
 can be assigned either in 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:42.409
 tablet form or hospital 

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:43.719
 he 

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:46.229
 would be a class assigned to 200

 therapeutic doses reach three days 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:01.900
 recommended 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.889

 what possesses other disturbing actions 

00:05:26.509 --> 00:05:29.379
