these are the ones that are in the

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.219 
these are the ones that are in the
original<00:01:02.219> barrel<00:01:02.730> but<00:01:02.940> on<00:01:03.059> this<00:01:03.480> one<00:01:03.809> they<00:01:04.110> are

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
original barrel but on this one they are

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.039 
original barrel but on this one they are
replaced<00:01:04.909> except<00:01:05.909> for<00:01:05.939> page<00:01:06.360> fade<00:01:06.689> with

vortex ripple and fall left so that is

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.149 
vortex ripple and fall left so that is
the<00:01:10.770> only<00:01:11.520> difference<00:01:11.700> with<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.600> two<00:01:12.890> so<00:01:13.890> let

touch<00:02:32.810> I'm<00:02:33.810> imagine<00:02:34.320> on<00:02:34.410> the<00:02:34.500> iphone<00:02:34.920> it

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
touch I'm imagine on the iphone it

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.910 
touch I'm imagine on the iphone it
wouldn't<00:02:35.580> be<00:02:35.670> that<00:02:35.820> bad<00:02:36.440> so<00:02:37.440> for<00:02:37.680> that<00:02:37.740> one's

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
wouldn't be that bad so for that one's

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.410 
wouldn't be that bad so for that one's
pretty<00:02:38.100> cool<00:02:38.400> and<00:02:38.640> then<00:02:39.480> you<00:02:39.720> have<00:02:39.930> fall<00:02:40.530> left

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
pretty cool and then you have fall left

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.910 
pretty cool and then you have fall left
so<00:02:42.420> they<00:02:42.900> are<00:02:42.960> just<00:02:43.170> almost<00:02:43.380> like<00:02:43.680> little

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
so they are just almost like little

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.730 
so they are just almost like little
bricks<00:02:44.280> so<00:02:44.520> you<00:02:44.610> just<00:02:44.760> fall<00:02:45.060> off<00:02:45.090> and<00:02:45.740> they

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740 
bricks so you just fall off and they

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.980 
bricks so you just fall off and they
just<00:02:46.950> keep<00:02:47.130> going<00:02:47.430> and<00:02:47.610> you<00:02:48.600> can<00:02:48.750> do<00:02:48.870> it

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 
just keep going and you can do it

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:55.010 
just keep going and you can do it
