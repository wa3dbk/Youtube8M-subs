00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.520 
follow the company for a while so you
know<00:01:04.799> it's<00:01:05.580> a<00:01:05.790> polymer<00:01:06.780> it's<00:01:06.960> a<00:01:06.990> hydrophilic

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
know it's a polymer it's a hydrophilic

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.100 
know it's a polymer it's a hydrophilic
polymer<00:01:08.159> that<00:01:08.310> is<00:01:08.369> a<00:01:08.580> delivery<00:01:09.030> system<00:01:09.299> it<00:01:09.720> is

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
polymer that is a delivery system it is

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.280 
polymer that is a delivery system it is
extremely<00:01:10.680> unique<00:01:11.430> you<00:01:12.360> can't<00:01:12.659> duplicate<00:01:12.900> it

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
extremely unique you can't duplicate it

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.190 
extremely unique you can't duplicate it
anything<00:01:14.070> that's<00:01:14.280> put<00:01:14.580> into<00:01:14.729> into<00:01:15.509> into<00:01:15.750> the

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
anything that's put into into into the

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.130 
anything that's put into into into the
polymer<00:01:16.650> that<00:01:16.979> looks<00:01:17.189> like<00:01:17.310> a<00:01:17.369> sponge<00:01:17.759> is<00:01:18.150> that

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
polymer that looks like a sponge is that

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.280 
polymer that looks like a sponge is that
is<00:01:19.680> stays<00:01:20.280> in<00:01:20.549> it<00:01:20.700> until<00:01:20.909> it's<00:01:21.240> activated<00:01:21.960> by

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
is stays in it until it's activated by

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.039 
is stays in it until it's activated by
water<00:01:22.610> water<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:23.759> mechanically<00:01:24.479> squeezing

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
water water and mechanically squeezing

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.140 
water water and mechanically squeezing
so<00:01:25.740> anything<00:01:26.100> that's<00:01:26.130> put<00:01:26.490> into<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.850> sponge

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
so anything that's put into the sponge

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.630 
so anything that's put into the sponge
stays<00:01:27.450> in<00:01:27.630> it<00:01:27.780> until<00:01:28.020> it's<00:01:28.320> activated<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:29.130> it

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
stays in it until it's activated and it

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.069 
stays in it until it's activated and it
comes<00:01:29.909> out<00:01:30.090> but<00:01:30.479> it<00:01:30.600> never<00:01:30.840> really<00:01:32.750> nice<00:01:33.750> punch

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
comes out but it never really nice punch

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.679 
comes out but it never really nice punch
as<00:01:34.409> funds<00:01:34.950> that<00:01:35.159> never<00:01:35.400> gets<00:01:35.579> dirty<00:01:35.939> never
