and the sufferer man didn't know that
yet<00:02:04.229> we<00:02:04.350> got<00:02:04.500> so<00:02:04.799> many<00:02:04.920> humans<00:02:05.430> who<00:02:05.969> are

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
yet we got so many humans who are

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.700 
yet we got so many humans who are
stressing<00:02:06.750> over<00:02:06.899> fiat<00:02:07.500> money

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:08.710

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:10.860 
stressing over fiat money
because<00:02:09.400> they<00:02:09.520> need<00:02:09.700> that<00:02:09.880> to<00:02:10.120> live<00:02:10.330> and<00:02:10.630> for

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:10.870 
because they need that to live and for

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:12.420 
because they need that to live and for
that<00:02:10.960> to<00:02:11.140> even<00:02:11.170> prosper<00:02:11.650> but<00:02:12.010> it's<00:02:12.160> impossible

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
that to even prosper but it's impossible

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.570 
that to even prosper but it's impossible
for<00:02:13.060> the<00:02:13.900> majority<00:02:15.270> the<00:02:16.270> pod<00:02:16.510> prospering

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
for the majority the pod prospering

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.150 
for the majority the pod prospering
possible<00:02:18.600> based<00:02:19.600> on<00:02:19.840> our<00:02:20.320> current<00:02:20.560> system<00:02:20.830> but

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
possible based on our current system but

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.590 
possible based on our current system but
if<00:02:21.250> we<00:02:21.280> evolve<00:02:21.700> away<00:02:22.090> from<00:02:22.450> the<00:02:23.230> negativity

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
if we evolve away from the negativity

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.720 
if we evolve away from the negativity
then<00:02:25.600> why<00:02:25.780> can't<00:02:26.200> all<00:02:26.530> or<00:02:27.130> the<00:02:27.340> vast<00:02:27.580> majority

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
then why can't all or the vast majority

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.060 
then why can't all or the vast majority
of<00:02:28.240> humanitarians<00:02:29.230> prosper<00:02:29.740> we<00:02:29.830> have<00:02:29.920> enough

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:24.060 
life the way it is now that we're living
in<00:05:22.420> a<00:05:22.510> negative<00:05:22.720> world<00:05:23.140> and<00:05:23.290> most<00:05:23.470> likely<00:05:23.710> we

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:24.070 
in a negative world and most likely we

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:30.030 
in a negative world and most likely we
will<00:05:24.310> become<00:05:24.730> extinct<00:05:26.100> it's<00:05:27.100> possible<00:05:27.280> but<00:05:29.040> I

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:30.040 
will become extinct it's possible but I

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.860 
will become extinct it's possible but I
don't<00:05:30.700> I<00:05:30.820> think<00:05:31.090> well<00:05:31.210> I<00:05:31.240> think<00:05:31.630> we'll<00:05:31.750> get

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:31.870 
don't I think well I think we'll get

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:36.180 
don't I think well I think we'll get
through<00:05:32.140> this<00:05:33.720> we<00:05:34.720> just<00:05:34.930> gotta<00:05:35.190> inform

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:36.190 
through this we just gotta inform

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:39.650 
through this we just gotta inform
ourselves<00:05:36.340> with<00:05:36.820> what's<00:05:37.000> going<00:05:37.330> on<00:05:37.540> and<00:05:37.890> then

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:39.660 
ourselves with what's going on and then

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:44.030 
ourselves with what's going on and then
make<00:05:40.660> same<00:05:41.490> decisions<00:05:42.490> and<00:05:42.880> making

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:44.040 
make same decisions and making

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:47.850 
make same decisions and making
evolutionary<00:05:45.040> steps<00:05:46.200> towards<00:05:47.200> positivity

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:47.860 
evolutionary steps towards positivity

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.190 
evolutionary steps towards positivity
and<00:05:48.220> away<00:05:48.610> from<00:05:48.670> the<00:05:49.000> negativity<00:05:49.870> that<00:05:49.900> we've

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:50.200 
and away from the negativity that we've

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:53.780 
and away from the negativity that we've
been<00:05:51.180> mind-controlled<00:05:52.180> to<00:05:52.750> believe

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:53.790 
been mind-controlled to believe
