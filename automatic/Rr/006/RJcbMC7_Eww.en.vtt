strife as a longshot so when you're

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:13.180 
strife as a longshot so when you're
shouldering<00:05:12.320> the<00:05:12.440> blaster<00:05:12.800> pointing<00:05:13.070> it<00:05:13.160> at

very slow rate of fire coming from a

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:17.360 
long shot and then with your flywheel

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.060 
long shot and then with your flywheel
superiority<00:05:18.140> you're<00:05:18.440> just<00:05:18.590> like<00:05:18.680> pop<00:05:18.830> pop<00:05:18.860> pop

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:19.070 
superiority you're just like pop pop pop

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:21.070 
superiority you're just like pop pop pop
pop<00:05:19.100> pop<00:05:19.250> what<00:05:19.550> is<00:05:19.700> that<00:05:19.880> soul<00:05:20.150> sorry<00:05:20.420> so<00:05:20.930> it's

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.080 
pop pop what is that soul sorry so it's

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:22.990 
pop pop what is that soul sorry so it's
effectively<00:05:21.470> a<00:05:21.620> wolf<00:05:22.040> in<00:05:22.280> sheep's<00:05:22.520> clothing

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.000 
effectively a wolf in sheep's clothing

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.370 
effectively a wolf in sheep's clothing
I<00:05:23.090> don't<00:05:23.360> think<00:05:23.540> the<00:05:23.600> black<00:05:23.750> paint<00:05:23.960> job<00:05:24.050> makes

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:24.380 
I don't think the black paint job makes

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:25.840 
I don't think the black paint job makes
it<00:05:24.530> very<00:05:24.680> sheep<00:05:25.070> like<00:05:25.310> it<00:05:25.460> looks<00:05:25.610> pretty

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:25.850 
it very sheep like it looks pretty

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:27.250 
it very sheep like it looks pretty
aggressive<00:05:26.330> but<00:05:26.540> I<00:05:26.570> still<00:05:26.810> think<00:05:27.020> it<00:05:27.110> looks

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:27.260 
aggressive but I still think it looks

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:28.810 
aggressive but I still think it looks
cool<00:05:27.440> but<00:05:27.530> the<00:05:27.680> project<00:05:28.100> goal<00:05:28.250> of<00:05:28.490> making<00:05:28.640> it

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:28.820 
cool but the project goal of making it

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:30.310 
cool but the project goal of making it
look<00:05:28.940> like<00:05:29.090> a<00:05:29.120> longshot<00:05:29.510> is<00:05:29.690> the<00:05:29.840> reason<00:05:30.080> I<00:05:30.170> did

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:30.320 
look like a longshot is the reason I did

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.470 
look like a longshot is the reason I did
not<00:05:30.440> cut<00:05:30.650> down<00:05:30.680> the<00:05:31.010> bipod<00:05:31.430> area<00:05:31.760> I<00:05:32.030> don't

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:32.480 
not cut down the bipod area I don't

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:33.820 
not cut down the bipod area I don't
really<00:05:32.630> like<00:05:32.810> the<00:05:32.960> bipod<00:05:33.260> area<00:05:33.500> I<00:05:33.560> think<00:05:33.740> it's

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:33.830 
really like the bipod area I think it's

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:35.110 
really like the bipod area I think it's
a<00:05:33.860> waste<00:05:34.040> of<00:05:34.160> space<00:05:34.220> but<00:05:34.700> it<00:05:34.820> makes<00:05:34.970> it<00:05:35.060> very

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:35.120 
a waste of space but it makes it very

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.120 
a waste of space but it makes it very
quickly<00:05:35.480> recognizable<00:05:36.230> as<00:05:36.380> a<00:05:36.410> longshot<00:05:36.860> which

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:37.130 
quickly recognizable as a longshot which

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:38.590 
quickly recognizable as a longshot which
is<00:05:37.280> why<00:05:37.370> I<00:05:37.400> kept<00:05:37.700> it<00:05:37.790> the<00:05:38.000> integration<00:05:38.450> was

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:38.600 
is why I kept it the integration was

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:39.700 
is why I kept it the integration was
done<00:05:38.720> with<00:05:38.870> hot<00:05:38.990> glue<00:05:39.110> and<00:05:39.290> solvent<00:05:39.620> weld

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:39.710 
done with hot glue and solvent weld

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:41.650 
done with hot glue and solvent weld
initially<00:05:40.370> and<00:05:40.550> then<00:05:40.640> smooth<00:05:40.820> cast<00:05:41.060> 65<00:05:41.450> d

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:41.660 
initially and then smooth cast 65 d

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:43.240 
initially and then smooth cast 65 d
reinforces<00:05:42.290> that<00:05:42.320> internally<00:05:42.950> and<00:05:43.160> then

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:43.250 
reinforces that internally and then

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:45.370 
reinforces that internally and then
externally<00:05:43.790> I<00:05:43.820> have<00:05:44.120> epoxy<00:05:44.510> putty<00:05:44.630> in<00:05:44.900> bondo

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:45.380 
externally I have epoxy putty in bondo

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:47.200 
externally I have epoxy putty in bondo
the<00:05:45.590> bondo<00:05:45.950> as<00:05:46.130> you<00:05:46.220> can<00:05:46.370> see<00:05:46.580> took<00:05:46.940> quite<00:05:47.150> a

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:47.210 
the bondo as you can see took quite a

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:49.090 
the bondo as you can see took quite a
while<00:05:47.270> to<00:05:47.420> sand<00:05:47.870> but<00:05:48.110> I'm<00:05:48.200> very<00:05:48.530> happy<00:05:48.980> with

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:49.100 
while to sand but I'm very happy with

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:51.280 
while to sand but I'm very happy with
the<00:05:49.220> end<00:05:49.250> result<00:05:49.730> it's<00:05:49.940> pretty<00:05:50.180> smooth<00:05:50.480> I<00:05:50.720> do

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:51.290 
the end result it's pretty smooth I do

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:53.020 
the end result it's pretty smooth I do
think<00:05:51.500> it<00:05:51.590> looks<00:05:51.710> pretty<00:05:51.890> cool<00:05:52.100> smooth<00:05:52.730> lines

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:53.030 
think it looks pretty cool smooth lines

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:55.000 
think it looks pretty cool smooth lines
like<00:05:53.240> this<00:05:53.390> don't<00:05:53.630> really<00:05:53.960> sit<00:05:54.230> in<00:05:54.410> in<00:05:54.740> strike

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:55.010 
like this don't really sit in in strike

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:56.860 
like this don't really sit in in strike
blasters<00:05:55.490> they<00:05:55.700> sit<00:05:55.970> in<00:05:56.090> the<00:05:56.150> rebel<00:05:56.420> blaster

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:56.870 
blasters they sit in the rebel blaster

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:58.240 
blasters they sit in the rebel blaster
so<00:05:57.050> it<00:05:57.170> does<00:05:57.290> look<00:05:57.500> a<00:05:57.560> little<00:05:57.710> weird<00:05:57.980> in<00:05:58.160> the

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:58.250 
so it does look a little weird in the

00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:59.530 
so it does look a little weird in the
center<00:05:58.490> because<00:05:58.640> of<00:05:58.760> all<00:05:58.940> the<00:05:59.060> smooth<00:05:59.300> lines

00:05:59.530 --> 00:05:59.540 
center because of all the smooth lines

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:00.940 
center because of all the smooth lines
and<00:05:59.750> then<00:05:59.900> on<00:05:59.990> the<00:06:00.110> outside<00:06:00.410> all<00:06:00.530> these<00:06:00.680> sharp

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:00.950 
and then on the outside all these sharp

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:03.610 
and then on the outside all these sharp
linear<00:06:01.670> areas<00:06:02.120> but<00:06:02.780> I<00:06:02.810> still<00:06:03.050> think<00:06:03.380> it<00:06:03.470> looks

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:03.620 
linear areas but I still think it looks

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:05.260 
linear areas but I still think it looks
very<00:06:03.740> smooth<00:06:04.070> and<00:06:04.220> very<00:06:04.310> cool<00:06:04.550> internal

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:05.270 
very smooth and very cool internal

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:22.650 
integration is very cool very solid

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:24.560 
integration is very cool very solid
it<00:07:22.740> holds<00:07:23.010> extremely<00:07:23.699> well<00:07:23.880> it<00:07:24.030> feels<00:07:24.240> pretty

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:24.570 
it holds extremely well it feels pretty

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:26.150 
it holds extremely well it feels pretty
similar<00:07:24.930> to<00:07:24.960> a<00:07:25.080> long<00:07:25.260> shot<00:07:25.470> the<00:07:25.650> proportions

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:26.160 
similar to a long shot the proportions

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:27.560 
similar to a long shot the proportions
of<00:07:26.250> the<00:07:26.370> rear<00:07:26.550> end<00:07:26.729> are<00:07:26.850> a<00:07:26.880> little<00:07:27.090> bit<00:07:27.210> off<00:07:27.330> the

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:27.570 
of the rear end are a little bit off the

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:29.270 
of the rear end are a little bit off the
rail<00:07:27.720> is<00:07:27.900> low<00:07:28.080> the<00:07:28.470> stock<00:07:28.740> is<00:07:28.889> high<00:07:29.010> so<00:07:29.220> it

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:29.280 
rail is low the stock is high so it

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:30.680 
rail is low the stock is high so it
doesn't<00:07:29.490> feel<00:07:29.610> exactly<00:07:29.880> like<00:07:30.090> a<00:07:30.210> long<00:07:30.419> shot

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:30.690 
doesn't feel exactly like a long shot

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:32.480 
doesn't feel exactly like a long shot
but<00:07:31.260> it<00:07:31.350> looks<00:07:31.500> very<00:07:31.560> similar<00:07:31.919> to<00:07:32.040> one<00:07:32.310> and

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:32.490 
but it looks very similar to one and

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:34.460 
but it looks very similar to one and
overall<00:07:33.030> it's<00:07:33.210> just<00:07:33.270> really<00:07:33.780> quick<00:07:34.050> really

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:34.470 
overall it's just really quick really

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:36.260 
overall it's just really quick really
cool<00:07:34.620> to<00:07:34.710> look<00:07:34.800> at<00:07:34.949> that<00:07:35.280> is<00:07:35.490> the<00:07:35.699> strife<00:07:36.090> shot

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:36.270 
cool to look at that is the strife shot

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:38.690 
cool to look at that is the strife shot
modified<00:07:36.960> strife<00:07:37.290> bt-dubs<00:07:37.680> dry<00:07:38.190> shot<00:07:38.430> comes

from<00:07:38.940> strife<00:07:39.300> and<00:07:39.479> long<00:07:39.780> shot<00:07:39.990> it's<00:07:40.169> a

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:40.200 
from strife and long shot it's a

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:41.719 
from strife and long shot it's a
combination<00:07:40.620> of<00:07:40.680> the<00:07:40.770> names<00:07:40.800> like<00:07:41.280> many<00:07:41.550> other
