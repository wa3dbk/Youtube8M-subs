00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:06.750
 to 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:06.750
 ah 

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:15.550
 today we are going to learn how to make 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:18.209
 These tricks for dogs we are going to learn 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:18.209
 how to do this 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:24.880
 and to make the gingham I'm going to take a 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:28.310
 elastic band of the same color or color 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:31.099
 similar to wool 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:35.180
 this little foot I'm going to take the ridges that 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:39.309
 they do not have any metal here that are 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.309
 we are just going to do 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.340
 12 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:54.230
 let's insure this new one again 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.230
 doing another 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.680
 now with the crochet let's take and what 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:12.770
 I'm going to make a chain 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.770
 and I'm going to make half points 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:22.360
 in the middle I will have the elastic band 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.360
 and I'm going to make half points 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:31.530
 in the elastic band 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.530
 to end all life 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:39.429
 up here the points the half points 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:42.840
 I'm going to make them quite united 

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:45.859
 that I stay pretty dense 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.859
 how much 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.320
 I will try to 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.190
 go squeezing them to take it like this 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:56.860
 I want me to stay pretty dependent 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:58.570
 the very good I've finished filling 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.720
 all the elastic bandit and has been 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:06.880
 so I've filled all of media 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:08.479
 points now I'm going to close with a point 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:13.250
 slipped 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:20.360
 this round and I'm going to come up with a chain 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:22.700
 and I will make increases in each point of 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:26.319
 the previous return here goes my first 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.319
 increase then in each 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.520
 point of the previous return I will do 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:35.690
 an increase that consists of doing two 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:39.620
 half a point on the same point 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:43.220
 and so I'm going to do until I finish all 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:45.700
 this voice making increases 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:48.280
 throughout the wedding 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.650
 I finished making this website has 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:54.340
 closed with a slipped point and I'm going to 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:58.269
 climb with three chain in the next 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:00.740
 back and I'm going to make varetas increases 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:03.670
 at each point 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:03.670
 from the garden 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:11.290
 an increase in suitcases for each point 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:14.500
 well up to finish the whole lap up 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:17.680
 here and I close with a slipped point 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.930
 and I have finished the round 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.590
 I'm going to close it with a slipped point and 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.590
 to cut l 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:27.560
 this is how love is finished 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:35.720
 one morning that we just did is this 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:38.209
 but for example there is this skill that is a 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.069
 little bit busier is a little bit more 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:44.330
 rolled to make it more 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:47.930
 rolled up as I have done when filling 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:50.660
 the elastic the elastic band 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:53.690
 filled more and that allows me to be the one 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:57.769
 make more increases so go give it the 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:04:01.970
 more wavy shape too if you want 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:04.370
 you can add another row of rods that 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:07.280
 they also help you get bigger 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:10.270
 and ordered canceled also doing 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:13.920
 increases in the row that you increase 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:13.920
 to do other 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:20.720
 example of these small ones are left 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:25.180
 well because it did not fill it so much the 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.180
 elastic and therefore they are smaller 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:32.490
 staying like this sometimes can be done with 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:34.560
 two rows of twists 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:38.690
 or just as you did it to 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.690
 is with a row of twists 

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:45.949
 like this 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:48.759
 also that I also have only one 

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:48.759
 row of twists 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:55.780
 it has two rows of boats too 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:59.530
 things 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:10.410
 i
