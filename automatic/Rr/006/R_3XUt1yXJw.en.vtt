00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
the point for another pencil so I got

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:44.250 
the point for another pencil so I got
red<00:01:38.329> blue<00:01:39.329> and<00:01:40.460> the<00:01:41.460> pencil

bought<00:03:04.700> with<00:03:05.060> it<00:03:05.239> alone<00:03:05.510> that's<00:03:05.720> for<00:03:06.200> it<00:03:06.260> from

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
bought with it alone that's for it from

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.550 
bought with it alone that's for it from
the<00:03:06.440> schiavo<00:03:07.060> from<00:03:08.060> zebra<00:03:08.300> I<00:03:08.510> mean<00:03:08.690> doughnuts

for<00:03:09.739> the<00:03:09.800> char<00:03:10.040> though<00:03:10.220> it<00:03:11.150> writes<00:03:11.570> relatively

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
for the char though it writes relatively

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.320 
for the char though it writes relatively
fine<00:03:12.380> it<00:03:12.709> does<00:03:12.890> writes<00:03:13.130> the<00:03:13.370> same<00:03:13.520> amount<00:03:13.880> like

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
fine it does writes the same amount like

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:18.940 
fine it does writes the same amount like
the<00:03:14.480> same<00:03:14.720> thickness<00:03:15.140> as<00:03:15.560> the<00:03:15.590> pilot<00:03:16.370> but<00:03:17.950> it's

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
the same thickness as the pilot but it's

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:20.530 
the same thickness as the pilot but it's
not<00:03:19.160> exactly<00:03:19.520> the<00:03:19.610> same<00:03:19.820> it's<00:03:20.000> viewable<00:03:20.300> but<00:03:20.480> I

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
not exactly the same it's viewable but I

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:21.100 
not exactly the same it's viewable but I
like<00:03:20.690> it

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
like it

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.430 
like it

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
don't end with a feel of the pen it's a

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.580 
don't end with a feel of the pen it's a
metal<00:03:24.709> construction<00:03:24.890> and<00:03:25.550> it<00:03:26.000> is<00:03:26.440> just<00:03:27.440> high

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
metal construction and it is just high

there's no shaking or anything of course

there's no shaking or anything of course
the<00:03:31.430> only<00:03:31.730> complaint<00:03:32.270> that<00:03:32.600> anyone<00:03:33.410> has<00:03:33.620> is

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:33.800 
the only complaint that anyone has is

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
the only complaint that anyone has is
that<00:03:33.980> when<00:03:34.280> you<00:03:34.400> try<00:03:34.610> to<00:03:34.730> put<00:03:35.060> away<00:03:36.610> the<00:03:37.610> ladder

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:37.820 
that when you try to put away the ladder

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:41.680 
that when you try to put away the ladder
or<00:03:38.510> the<00:03:38.930> nibs<00:03:39.520> there<00:03:40.520> is<00:03:40.670> not<00:03:40.880> like<00:03:41.090> a<00:03:41.120> point

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
or the nibs there is not like a point

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:43.090 
or the nibs there is not like a point
where<00:03:41.870> you<00:03:41.959> put<00:03:42.140> it<00:03:42.230> away<00:03:42.320> it's<00:03:42.709> just<00:03:42.920> in

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.100 
where you put it away it's just in

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.660 
where you put it away it's just in
between<00:03:43.810> you<00:03:44.810> see<00:03:44.840> that<00:03:45.200> this<00:03:46.190> is<00:03:46.370> essentially

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
between you see that this is essentially

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:48.160 
between you see that this is essentially
putting<00:03:47.000> that<00:03:47.090> away<00:03:47.239> it<00:03:47.510> was<00:03:47.630> trying<00:03:47.870> to<00:03:47.959> try

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
putting that away it was trying to try

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:51.010 
putting that away it was trying to try
it<00:03:48.230> back<00:03:48.650> and<00:03:48.890> balancing<00:03:49.489> it<00:03:49.550> between<00:03:50.020> the

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:51.020 
it back and balancing it between the

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.560 
it back and balancing it between the
blue<00:03:51.260> and<00:03:51.590> the<00:03:52.549> red<00:03:52.579> same<00:03:53.239> thing<00:03:53.420> with<00:03:53.510> a

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:53.570 
blue and the red same thing with a

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:55.660 
blue and the red same thing with a
pencil<00:03:53.750> part<00:03:54.200> that<00:03:55.070> was<00:03:55.190> in<00:03:55.280> between<00:03:55.579> the

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670 
pencil part that was in between the

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:57.720 
pencil part that was in between the
pencil<00:03:55.910> part<00:03:56.359> and<00:03:56.570> there

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
pencil part and there

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.690 
pencil part and there
so<00:03:58.730> of<00:03:58.790> course<00:03:59.030> if<00:03:59.390> anyone<00:03:59.630> was<00:04:00.200> like<00:04:00.380> this<00:04:00.709> and

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
so of course if anyone was like this and

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.229 
so of course if anyone was like this and
maybe<00:04:01.880> arrayed<00:04:02.239> in<00:04:02.770> like<00:04:03.770> we<00:04:04.700> went<00:04:04.849> to<00:04:04.940> five

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:05.239 
maybe arrayed in like we went to five

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:06.850 
maybe arrayed in like we went to five
but<00:04:05.569> we<00:04:05.660> definitely<00:04:06.110> have<00:04:06.230> to<00:04:06.349> give<00:04:06.500> forward

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:06.860 
but we definitely have to give forward

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:08.920 
but we definitely have to give forward
just<00:04:07.040> because<00:04:07.310> of<00:04:07.400> that<00:04:07.430> future<00:04:07.760> but<00:04:08.750> other

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
just because of that future but other

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.830 
just because of that future but other
than<00:04:09.020> that<00:04:09.080> I<00:04:09.440> love<00:04:09.620> this<00:04:09.940> and<00:04:10.940> of<00:04:11.450> course<00:04:11.690> you

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
than that I love this and of course you

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.680 
than that I love this and of course you
have<00:04:11.930> erasers<00:04:12.230> in<00:04:12.410> the<00:04:12.590> top<00:04:13.360> and<00:04:14.360> I'll<00:04:14.480> see<00:04:14.599> if

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:14.690 
have erasers in the top and I'll see if

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:35.200 
have erasers in the top and I'll see if
I<00:04:14.750> can<00:04:14.930> access<00:04:15.380> this<00:04:15.560> with<00:04:15.769> one<00:04:16.010> hand

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:40.540 

and<00:04:35.840> yes<00:04:36.340> this<00:04:37.340> is<00:04:37.550> the<00:04:37.669> little<00:04:39.250> cap<00:04:40.250> on<00:04:40.460> the

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
and yes this is the little cap on the

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.400 
and yes this is the little cap on the
top<00:04:40.699> as<00:04:40.940> with<00:04:41.120> a<00:04:41.150> rubberized<00:04:41.570> view<00:04:41.960> on<00:04:42.139> the<00:04:42.229> top

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:42.410 
top as with a rubberized view on the top

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:45.129 
top as with a rubberized view on the top
with<00:04:42.560> its<00:04:42.680> metal<00:04:42.919> eyes<00:04:43.130> low<00:04:43.750> let<00:04:44.750> say<00:04:44.930> that<00:04:45.080> you

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:45.139 
with its metal eyes low let say that you

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:47.499 
with its metal eyes low let say that you
see<00:04:45.380> it's<00:04:45.500> metal<00:04:45.830> and<00:04:46.300> it's<00:04:47.300> a<00:04:47.360> little

00:04:47.499 --> 00:04:47.509 
see it's metal and it's a little

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:48.610 
see it's metal and it's a little
interesting<00:04:47.660> because<00:04:47.960> this<00:04:48.139> little<00:04:48.470> rubber

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:48.620 
interesting because this little rubber

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.920 
interesting because this little rubber
part<00:04:48.979> on<00:04:49.100> the<00:04:49.250> top<00:04:49.400> it<00:04:50.389> doesn't<00:04:50.570> work<00:04:50.780> as<00:04:50.900> a

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
part on the top it doesn't work as a

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.080 
part on the top it doesn't work as a
stylus<00:04:51.530> however<00:04:51.919> you<00:04:52.160> can<00:04:52.400> use<00:04:52.550> it<00:04:52.699> to<00:04:52.789> wake<00:04:52.940> up

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090 
stylus however you can use it to wake up

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:56.439 
stylus however you can use it to wake up
your<00:04:53.240> phone<00:04:54.130> so<00:04:55.130> yes<00:04:55.430> like<00:04:55.639> it's<00:04:55.820> sort<00:04:56.180> of<00:04:56.270> fun

00:04:56.439 --> 00:04:56.449 
your phone so yes like it's sort of fun

00:04:56.449 --> 00:04:59.469 
your phone so yes like it's sort of fun
when<00:04:56.630> you<00:04:56.690> can<00:04:56.810> double<00:04:57.110> tap<00:04:57.289> them<00:04:57.620> and<00:04:58.479> thereby

00:04:59.469 --> 00:04:59.479 
when you can double tap them and thereby

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:00.820 
when you can double tap them and thereby
can<00:04:59.539> it<00:04:59.750> essentially<00:05:00.110> has<00:05:00.289> an<00:05:00.410> electrical

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830 
can it essentially has an electrical

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:02.620 
can it essentially has an electrical
current<00:05:01.009> which<00:05:01.340> yeah<00:05:02.060> you<00:05:02.180> can<00:05:02.300> like<00:05:02.389> maybe

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:02.630 
current which yeah you can like maybe

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:03.999 
current which yeah you can like maybe
wake<00:05:02.900> up<00:05:03.020> a<00:05:03.110> phone<00:05:03.289> with<00:05:03.500> it

00:05:03.999 --> 00:05:04.009 
wake up a phone with it

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:06.279 
wake up a phone with it
but<00:05:04.910> it's<00:05:05.030> not<00:05:05.210> really<00:05:05.419> as<00:05:05.570> a<00:05:05.600> stylus<00:05:06.050> they<00:05:06.199> do

00:05:06.279 --> 00:05:06.289 
but it's not really as a stylus they do

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:09.150 
but it's not really as a stylus they do
offer<00:05:06.590> they<00:05:06.979> do<00:05:07.039> have<00:05:07.280> or<00:05:07.520> offer<00:05:07.639> a<00:05:07.789> stylus

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:09.160 
offer they do have or offer a stylus

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:14.740 
offer they do have or offer a stylus
