00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:29.490 
several points instead of ball joints
the<00:02:27.670> only<00:02:27.940> thing<00:02:28.150> that<00:02:28.330> is<00:02:28.480> rested<00:02:29.230> on<00:02:29.380> the

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
the only thing that is rested on the

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.220 
the only thing that is rested on the
balls<00:02:29.680> right<00:02:29.830> there<00:02:30.010> is<00:02:30.100> the<00:02:30.310> end<00:02:30.549> but<00:02:31.360> the

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
balls right there is the end but the

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
balls right there is the end but the
rest<00:02:32.470> would<00:02:32.890> have<00:02:33.660> joints<00:02:34.660> like<00:02:34.840> these<00:02:35.080> I<00:02:35.709> wish

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
rest would have joints like these I wish

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.729 
rest would have joints like these I wish
it<00:02:36.430> had<00:02:36.640> a<00:02:36.880> ball<00:02:37.180> joint<00:02:37.420> instead<00:02:37.840> of<00:02:38.049> sole

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739 
it had a ball joint instead of sole

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:41.580 
it had a ball joint instead of sole
point<00:02:39.040> to<00:02:39.310> that<00:02:39.489> just<00:02:40.000> like<00:02:40.060> drag<00:02:40.540> rather<00:02:40.780> so

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
point to that just like drag rather so

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.140 
point to that just like drag rather so
that<00:02:41.920> he<00:02:42.250> this<00:02:42.910> tail<00:02:43.209> can<00:02:43.510> move

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
that he this tail can move

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.320 
that he this tail can move
better<00:02:44.420> than<00:02:44.720> what<00:02:45.590> he<00:02:45.980> is<00:02:46.489> doing<00:02:46.790> right<00:02:47.090> now

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
better than what he is doing right now

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.440 
better than what he is doing right now
so<00:02:47.870> that's<00:02:48.260> a<00:02:48.470> pre-compression<00:02:48.890> between<00:02:49.489> this

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
so that's a pre-compression between this

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.369 
so that's a pre-compression between this
figure<00:02:50.870> and<00:02:51.080> flame<00:02:52.010> dragon<00:02:52.750> the<00:02:53.750> only<00:02:54.140> true

00:02:54.369 --> 00:02:54.379 
figure and flame dragon the only true

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:56.649 
figure and flame dragon the only true
add-on<00:02:54.890> to<00:02:55.069> this<00:02:55.250> set<00:02:55.519> is<00:02:55.760> just<00:02:55.790> the<00:02:56.269> tail

00:02:56.649 --> 00:02:56.659 
add-on to this set is just the tail

00:02:56.659 --> 00:02:59.199 
add-on to this set is just the tail
sadly<00:02:57.379> there<00:02:57.739> is<00:02:57.950> limitation<00:02:58.430> when<00:02:58.849> it<00:02:59.000> comes

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
sadly there is limitation when it comes

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:02.259 
sadly there is limitation when it comes
to<00:02:59.540> what<00:03:00.110> a<00:03:00.319> tail<00:03:00.769> does<00:03:01.159> in<00:03:01.400> a<00:03:01.489> real<00:03:01.700> life

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:02.269 
to what a tail does in a real life

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:04.300 
to what a tail does in a real life
I<00:03:02.299> can<00:03:02.540> only<00:03:02.750> reconcile<00:03:03.409> and<00:03:03.709> make<00:03:03.980> this

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
I can only reconcile and make this

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.729 
I can only reconcile and make this
realistic<00:03:04.879> s<00:03:05.329> through<00:03:05.810> my<00:03:06.079> basic<00:03:06.530> photography

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:06.739 
realistic s through my basic photography

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:09.309 
realistic s through my basic photography
skills<00:03:07.489> I<00:03:07.760> wish<00:03:08.120> that<00:03:08.329> these<00:03:08.540> segments<00:03:09.170> are

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:09.319 
skills I wish that these segments are

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:11.740 
skills I wish that these segments are
held<00:03:09.620> by<00:03:09.769> ball<00:03:10.040> joints<00:03:10.489> in<00:03:10.879> order<00:03:11.329> to<00:03:11.569> move

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
held by ball joints in order to move

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.050 
held by ball joints in order to move
like<00:03:12.049> Ryu<00:03:12.409> please<00:03:12.650> drag<00:03:12.980> rudder<00:03:13.310> for<00:03:13.790> this
