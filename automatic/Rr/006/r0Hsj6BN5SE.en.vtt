00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.649
 all models friends came out a new tiger on 

00:00:02.649 --> 00:00:05.790
 site 105 hryvnia he is so strange shorter 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.150
 Now Ryazan Japan, we see the spring ladder I 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.290
 I'm telling you that the sprint cup will still appear in 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:13.820
 stories of dollars I turned out to be right and 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:15.660
 and it is possible so far only possible 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.359
 this nightmare sprint is equal as long as I do not know 

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:21.300
 Exactly and people who say that it is not 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.720
 sprint breaking through is not broken down 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.660
 I will answer that it is still if it is a nightmare 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.170
 really both snow 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.050
 when he doesn't necessarily have to 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:31.560
 be at all something breakdowns 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.750
 but he himself looked like he died 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.040
 seriously in color and looks like a sprint 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.640
 ladder 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.649
 so at the moment I think this 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:41.230
 sprint injury, I still look and thought 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.210
 maybe I'll come some other 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:44.460
 option and conclusions 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.180
 he sits the area if the center of kiev 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.620
 spring herbs 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.730
 mother and vodka from the lyceum sprint itself looks 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.720
 small and behind we see the window to the window and this 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.150
 the first time we see something 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.870
 opponents of the fight nights series italian there we 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.940
 see a couple of trees which means 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.900
 that this happens at will by the way 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.740
 if bastrykin picture then we 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.620
 see a couple of dpni and left and right 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.380
 this is a typical choir scene when the main 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.590
 hero entering some sort or corridor 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:17.530
 from hotels 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.770
 in some light for three years something 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:22.979
 in this case, we see that it was not 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.450
 for our rabbits armchair old man trail 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.200
 but for the time being, the general appearance around 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.369
 I understand that this is a nightmare, I mean 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.359
 sprinters nightmare i mean 

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:36.110
 itâ€™s a nightmare 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.440
 this confirms my previous theory about 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.230
 the fact that everything will happen you dreams 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.660
 but for now she will still be many abdul ati 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:45.870
 now if we look at the phrase 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:48.950
 middle goal Baltasinsky spokes pier 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.830
 dad getz what does hariri mean new sins 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.170
 comes cleaner maple picked out 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.590
 things come in small portions 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.619
 I do not know what exactly this means 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.780
 the phrase maybe this is a reference 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.020
 by teaser cattle by a little bit 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.390
 send the oven and in these little 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.090
 picture of accounts on the site so well in the code 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:09.929
 site we also have a lot of chair with 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:10.719
 armenia 

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:12.969
 there in short the only one in the dry 

00:02:12.969 --> 00:02:15.149
 November, the novelty will appear 

00:02:15.149 --> 00:02:17.269
 I do not know yet what it was I tried 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:19.589
 It seems to be translated using a processor 

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:21.909
 but personally, I have nothing at the moment 

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:24.239
 did not work but I will see 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.359
 but on this for now all dear friends I 

00:02:26.359 --> 00:02:29.310
 I will continue to think about 50 kopecks and you 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.219

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:32.769
