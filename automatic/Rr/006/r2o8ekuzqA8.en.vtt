 hello friends of the movie welcome to 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.259
 dvd criticism and a silent film in 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.120
 black and white at this year's oscars 

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:11.099
 2012 has cleared the most prices yes 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.450
 there is one or the other not exactly 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.610
 badly watched but also this movie 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.680
 prices get this rightly has the 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.190
 today in my criticism of the

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.120
 clear is that they are also in 2011 and 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.950
 is 100 minutes tells the story 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.410
 by george valentine george the 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.780
 mentalist in the late 1920's 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:04.240
 in hollywood enjoys a silent movie star 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.980
 the limelight he loves like the crowd 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.990
 He loves his colleagues 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.790
 limelight and even his own wife 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:12.250
 looking at something bad would not just be his 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.600
 especially cute and educated 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.850
 addressed one in the film below 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.650
 Great and funny number is holding 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.120
 to him but that he does not notice all the 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.760
 To be true is the money and its 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.730
 Success noise until the sound film 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.140
 established and so he flirts on the day 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.670
 there is one back and forth 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.140
 young actress the paper 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.250
 miller tips like you in the movie industry 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.110
 can take root 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.000
 and that's what she does but just in 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:36.040
 soundtrack and thus the art is a 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.290
 film that tells the story of one 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.930
 falling stars at an ascending 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.180
 replaced as young and old 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.489
 this old story with ego and pride 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.780
 connects in a wonderful movie 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:48.459
 the ring his vision 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.880
 I do not know how to do the French 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:53.590
 director directors speaks out here 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.630
 the screen has spellbound the whole thing 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.600
 authentic just silent movie black 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:59.860
 white look and in 4 3 format very much 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.570
 unusual if you look at that 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.640
 blu-ray with black stripes left and 

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:05.920
 Look to the right and on top of that with a 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.540
 musically wonderful accompaniment and 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.130
 one asks oneself rightly one can 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.780
 actually one more thing these days 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:13.150
 dull movie look does not look that 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.799
 weird no it is awesome when I am 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.630
 Honestly it's great to see how 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:18.640
 this director was 15 years ago 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.290
 the idea for this film only in 

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:22.390
 France to reach the celebrity 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:24.040
 had to spend this for the necessary money for 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:26.560
 to get this movie and you forget 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:28.540
 at the artist after 34 minutes is there 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.729
 a silent movie is a great one 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:33.280
 musical accompaniment a story 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:35.200
 which is great and above all 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.970
 by jean buecher.de french 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.919
 main actor of a simple 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:40.150
 Megastar is right here 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:42.520
 with the oscar as the best main actor 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.289
 has been awarded one 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.990
 but not only he is brilliant 

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:48.700
 wonderful in the stage or just that 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:50.770
 just this young Peppi Miller plays 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:52.330
 both of these work so well 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.550
 together and like her alone 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.439
 the cabin imagines a role where 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:58.960
 with these big studios hour to it 

00:04:56.439 --> 00:05:00.400
 Do we have them playing is unique 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.900
 as she imitates a second hand at 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.400
 that you think that would not be hers 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.620
 again these films should see 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:07.569
 at least on this scene great value 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:09.449
 lay and pay great attention that is 

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:11.530
 terrific and that shows above all how 

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:13.599
 Acting can also be if you 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:15.430
 to get rid of text has to be terrific 

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:17.500
 and great that only shows that that 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:19.360
 The link is that the dull one 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:21.569
 the link between light and the blind 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:23.800
 but gives the link between 

00:05:21.569 --> 00:05:25.690
 theater and cinema was one sees the 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:27.219
 great or the great kind of 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:28.599
 physical play also from the 

00:05:27.219 --> 00:05:30.310
 fact that you have no text he 

00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:32.530
 But the theater belongs to the moment where 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:34.719
 the camera is very close to the face 

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:36.699
 again the fine and authentic 

00:05:34.719 --> 00:05:38.129
 the way to play the movie today 

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:40.659
 knows and that is also a great 

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:42.069
 historical demolition of the singer 

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:44.590
 you choose to have the films 

00:05:42.069 --> 00:05:46.330
 Thirties really great john 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:48.009
 goodman plays the sky he sees 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:50.800
 unbelievably good even with felt 40 

00:05:48.009 --> 00:05:52.599
 kilo less and the goal is the same 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.919
 how james cromwell gives a butler here 

00:05:52.599 --> 00:05:55.930
 and then one or the other may 

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:57.610
 familiar face I am from 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:59.319
 The species is completely fascinated though 

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:01.419
 also because it is a great experiment 

00:05:59.319 --> 00:06:03.669
 that was great and also 

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:05.080
 The young generation shows how to film 

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:06.250
 once you were not allowed to be 

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:08.409
 somewhere back then, of course, there was 

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:10.300
 no full hd but still trying 

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:11.860
 here with the black and white 43 and the 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:13.629
 typical hour for musical 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:15.639
 Untermalung the great succeeded here 

00:06:13.629 --> 00:06:17.650
 to do a lot in this direction 

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:19.599
 daring and really great unfortunately the 

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:21.310
 no great success if 

00:06:19.599 --> 00:06:23.889
 But honestly, here are the ones 

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:25.240
 prizes at the academy at the oscars 

00:06:23.889 --> 00:06:26.979
 been truly forgiven cope 

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:28.990
 in my opinion georgia dome 

00:06:26.979 --> 00:06:30.190
 great the whole cast great 

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:31.839
 history but here you have to say 

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:33.370
 you have to be interested in 

00:06:31.839 --> 00:06:35.740
 bring film history for this 

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:37.360
 machart it is not light entertainment 

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:38.770
 you really have to understand 

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:41.229
 and then you can be passionate 

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:43.599
 enjoy this movie and is called for me 

00:06:41.229 --> 00:06:45.490
 later than rama that this movie 

00:06:43.599 --> 00:06:47.620
 Ultimately, it is the story 

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:49.120
 actually too much in one and a half 

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:50.620
 set tells and therefore not at all 

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:53.110
 great but still a great one 

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:55.029
 the drama is with me 

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:56.500
 Eight and a half out of 10 possible points 

00:06:55.029 --> 00:06:58.180
 Overall, he has for me from the first 

00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:00.100
 minute really well taken as 

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:01.450
 spectators and had 

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:02.830
 well entertained but maybe also 

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:04.750
 because it's time to change something 

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:06.250
 Other things would be live in one time 

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:08.350
 we make a silent movie every month 

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:10.140
 presented he would then come 

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:12.490
 maybe a little harder 

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:14.590
 to enjoy this movie as this 

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:16.420
 to consider special features nevertheless 

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:18.220
 he took off for me completely from the stool 

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:20.500
 maybe the script a little bit 

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:22.150
 too lengthy in one or the other moment 

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:23.440
 what a little deduction but at the end 

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:25.960
 Makes it even better for me 

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:28.150
 rating as only that is rare sounds 

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:29.380
 for me as a total of nine of art 

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:30.940
 ten possible points 

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:32.830
 okay that was it from me for today 

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:36.010
 Otherwise, we'll see you tomorrow, of course 

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:38.170
 again at 3 pm with a new review 

00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:42.030
 and by that time I hope you are tomorrow 

00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:42.030
 of course again at 3 

00:07:42.220 --> 00:08:04.540
