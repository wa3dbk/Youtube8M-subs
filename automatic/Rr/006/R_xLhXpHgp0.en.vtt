00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
and

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:49.940 
and
so<00:03:29.950> all<00:03:30.190> demonstrate<00:03:30.730> that

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950

so what I did I wound up I my toes

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.970 
so what I did I wound up I my toes
hanging<00:03:54.070> over<00:03:54.490> and<00:03:55.050> I<00:03:56.050> just<00:03:56.500> don't<00:03:56.770> like

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
hanging over and I just don't like

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.170 
hanging over and I just don't like
Goldman<00:03:57.370> and<00:03:58.000> keep<00:03:58.209> that<00:03:58.360> and<00:04:00.000> keep<00:04:01.000> your

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
Goldman and keep that and keep your

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.410 
Goldman and keep that and keep your
weight<00:04:01.360> over<00:04:02.140> your<00:04:02.740> front<00:04:03.100> foot<00:04:03.220> for<00:04:04.150> all<00:04:04.270> of

these<00:04:04.570> slides<00:04:05.160> so<00:04:06.780> that<00:04:07.780> your<00:04:07.990> wheels<00:04:08.170> don't

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:08.350 
these slides so that your wheels don't

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:10.620 
these slides so that your wheels don't
catch<00:04:08.620> and<00:04:09.040> you<00:04:09.820> don't<00:04:10.000> slow<00:04:10.150> down<00:04:10.390> too<00:04:10.600> much

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.630 
catch and you don't slow down too much

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:15.000 
catch and you don't slow down too much
so<00:04:11.290> if<00:04:12.190> you<00:04:12.340> need<00:04:12.400> to<00:04:12.700> keep<00:04:13.330> your<00:04:13.830> front<00:04:14.830> foot

00:05:38.589 --> 00:05:38.599 
all the way up against the ball so that

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:40.420 
all the way up against the ball so that
would<00:05:38.870> be<00:05:38.900> a<00:05:38.990> really<00:05:39.199> smooth<00:05:39.500> transition<00:05:40.159> and

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:40.430 
would be a really smooth transition and

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:42.040 
would be a really smooth transition and
it<00:05:40.520> will<00:05:40.610> be<00:05:40.729> kind<00:05:40.939> of<00:05:41.030> like<00:05:41.150> just<00:05:41.180> pivoting<00:05:41.840> on

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:42.050 
it will be kind of like just pivoting on

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:45.830 
it will be kind of like just pivoting on
the<00:05:42.289> net

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:45.840 

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:47.360 

keep<00:05:46.440> all<00:05:46.590> your<00:05:46.620> weight<00:05:46.860> on<00:05:46.889> the<00:05:47.070> front<00:05:47.190> foot
