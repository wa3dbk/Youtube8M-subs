 flowers the truth is that I like it a lot 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.259
 around here we would come and have a 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:38.740
 planted with cactus as you know 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:40.720
 I'm playing in version 0.7 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.149
 points 5 in which crops in 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.700
 surfers are not available so to 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:48.009
 the best at 0.8 because I could 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.799
 to make crops of more things up 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:55.810
 Now I can only find this and it's 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:57.670
 nice here we would have that rather 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.020
 we would have the bottom part in the 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.030
 house as you can see the house is 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.009
 floating here and of course this is a touch 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.380
 that I like quite well we have for 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:08.259
 here where we would have a farm like that 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.630
 here there were sheep one of which was 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:15.700
 called betty but they disappeared because 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:17.470
 nor the idea so we would have wool 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.900
 we would have scissors and dyes 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.700
 we would have infinite water a kraft table 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.519
 eoi here a mine to which you can download 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:27.760
 and then I do not know how to mine that seed 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:30.220
 very much diamond in the part of the 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.989
 pedro I do not know why it was random not the 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.650
 I searched or nothing I just realized 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:36.670
 that I would have many things now 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.440
 we would continue through here as you can see 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:42.190
 we have a 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.930
 snow biome next door with a cabin 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.540
 that the truth is that I like it a lot 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.880
 I already know, but it 's a cabin that 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.710
 I like it a lot and do not discover it for 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.230
 that you can put a touch 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:55.210
 special and put what they want if 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:58.270
 as you can see it's a seed over there 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:03:00.970
 we would have seas we would have sand 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:03.069
 we would have there in the background more biomes 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.319
 of snow 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:08.560
 and how important is this seed that I 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:10.719
 It is very much liked that this seed or 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.719
 good the house mainly because it is 

00:03:10.719 --> 00:03:16.030
 built in what would be the center of 

00:03:13.719 --> 00:03:18.519
 the whole map of this seed well 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.859
 would be in the center yes that is to say that 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:22.420
 you will not be lost here for nothing 

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:24.189
 the world will always find the 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.040
 madrid house that occupies a large plot of land 

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:28.959
 the house as you can see here we have a 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.900
 block cited torches that also what 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:34.540
 I put to be located for those who 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:37.750
 can lose and there we would have another 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:41.019
 equally but yellow here 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:43.389
 we would have the other language of snow and 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:45.010
 for this would be all at the beginning the 

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:47.379
 video and at that time you should be 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.510
 pressure on your screens an annotation 

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:52.599
 which would take them to a video of how 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:55.329
 install maps for your device 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:57.400
 iphone ipod touch or ipad itself is very 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:04:00.069
 simple simply give you click the 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.419
 annotation and they will go straight to the video and 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:03.099
