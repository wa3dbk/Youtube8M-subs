want so if you wanted 70 percent to
already<00:02:04.409> put<00:02:04.619> 70<00:02:05.159> and<00:02:05.840> then<00:02:06.840> set<00:02:07.439> your<00:02:07.560> Expo<00:02:08.009> if

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
already put 70 and then set your Expo if

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:47.130 
negative pitch so it doesn't slam to the

degrees<00:06:04.710> pitch<00:06:04.979> here's<00:06:05.580> mid<00:06:05.879> stick<00:06:06.240> and<00:06:06.539> then

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:06.960 
degrees pitch here's mid stick and then

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.350 
degrees pitch here's mid stick and then
you'll<00:06:07.110> start<00:06:07.379> to<00:06:07.500> have<00:06:07.590> positive<00:06:08.129> pitch<00:06:08.370> this

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:09.360 
you'll start to have positive pitch this

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.570 
you'll start to have positive pitch this
way<00:06:09.569> if<00:06:10.379> you<00:06:10.530> have<00:06:10.650> to<00:06:10.800> bring<00:06:10.979> the<00:06:11.129> heli<00:06:11.310> down

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:11.580 
way if you have to bring the heli down

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:16.240 
way if you have to bring the heli down
and<00:06:11.819> slam<00:06:12.030> the<00:06:12.180> throttle<00:06:12.599> it's<00:06:13.560> not<00:06:13.830> going<00:06:14.039> to

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:16.250 

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:18.409 

slam<00:06:17.250> into<00:06:17.430> the<00:06:17.639> ground<00:06:17.669> what<00:06:18.090> because<00:06:18.330> you

00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:18.419 
slam into the ground what because you

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:20.899 
slam into the ground what because you
don't<00:06:18.599> have<00:06:18.750> any<00:06:18.930> negative<00:06:19.349> picture<00:06:19.909> so

00:06:20.899 --> 00:06:20.909 
don't have any negative picture so

00:06:20.909 --> 00:06:22.490 
don't have any negative picture so
that's<00:06:21.030> another<00:06:21.300> option<00:06:21.569> if<00:06:21.900> you<00:06:22.020> want<00:06:22.259> it's

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:22.500 
that's another option if you want it's

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:26.059 
that's another option if you want it's
that<00:06:22.590> easy<00:06:22.860> to<00:06:23.129> do<00:06:23.840> and<00:06:24.840> that's<00:06:25.500> it<00:06:25.800> that

00:06:26.059 --> 00:06:26.069 
that easy to do and that's it that

00:06:26.069 --> 00:06:29.120 
that easy to do and that's it that
covers<00:06:26.400> everything<00:06:26.699> here
