ngtzombies<00:00:11.969> and<00:00:12.660> this<00:00:13.230> is<00:00:13.500> a<00:00:13.559> lighthouse<00:00:14.460> dial

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
ngtzombies and this is a lighthouse dial

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.910 
ngtzombies and this is a lighthouse dial
number<00:00:15.420> /<00:00:15.809> color<00:00:16.880> codes<00:00:17.880> and<00:00:18.920> apparently

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
number / color codes and apparently

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.920 
number / color codes and apparently
there's<00:00:20.160> a<00:00:20.220> well<00:00:20.730> I<00:00:20.760> mean<00:00:21.270> I'm<00:00:21.539> sure<00:00:21.750> you<00:00:21.840> guys

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
there's a well I mean I'm sure you guys

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.689 
there's a well I mean I'm sure you guys
are<00:00:22.109> aware<00:00:22.140> there<00:00:22.410> are<00:00:22.439> four<00:00:22.769> dials<00:00:23.189> in<00:00:23.519> the

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
are aware there are four dials in the

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.460 
are aware there are four dials in the
lighthouse<00:00:23.880> and<00:00:24.480> their<00:00:24.750> colors<00:00:25.109> on<00:00:25.230> each<00:00:25.260> of

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
lighthouse and their colors on each of

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.019 
lighthouse and their colors on each of
the<00:00:25.529> dials<00:00:25.890> well<00:00:26.070> around<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.580> map<00:00:26.789> they're

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
the dials well around the map they're

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.410 
the dials well around the map they're
actually<00:00:27.269> these<00:00:27.359> shreds<00:00:27.960> of<00:00:28.230> paper<00:00:28.470> that<00:00:29.420> show

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
actually these shreds of paper that show

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.630 
actually these shreds of paper that show
a<00:00:30.810> color<00:00:31.199> they<00:00:31.529> actually<00:00:31.769> have<00:00:31.859> a<00:00:31.890> color<00:00:32.219> and<00:00:32.550> a

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
a color they actually have a color and a

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.479 
a color they actually have a color and a
code<00:00:32.910> on<00:00:32.940> them<00:00:33.300> so<00:00:33.989> this<00:00:34.260> one<00:00:34.469> is<00:00:34.680> a<00:00:34.710> purple<00:00:35.340> in

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
code on them so this one is a purple in

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.459 
code on them so this one is a purple in
its<00:00:35.670> six<00:00:36.000> and<00:00:36.270> actually<00:00:36.809> all<00:00:36.930> these<00:00:37.079> pieces<00:00:37.260> of

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
its six and actually all these pieces of

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.400 
its six and actually all these pieces of
paper<00:00:37.530> come<00:00:37.980> from<00:00:38.629> what<00:00:39.629> looks<00:00:39.750> like<00:00:39.870> a<00:00:39.989> map

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
paper come from what looks like a map

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.490 
paper come from what looks like a map
that<00:00:40.440> is<00:00:40.860> located<00:00:41.550> sort<00:00:42.540> of<00:00:42.629> near<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:42.930> the

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
that is located sort of near the the

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.850 
that is located sort of near the the
lighthouse<00:00:44.300> so<00:00:45.300> we're<00:00:45.960> thinking<00:00:45.989> that<00:00:46.680> these

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
lighthouse so we're thinking that these

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.850 
lighthouse so we're thinking that these
numbers<00:00:47.309> coincide<00:00:47.520> with<00:00:47.850> what<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.660> dials<00:00:49.620> in

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
numbers coincide with what the dials in

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.770 
numbers coincide with what the dials in
the<00:00:49.950> lighthouse<00:00:50.129> have<00:00:50.640> to<00:00:50.879> line<00:00:51.120> up<00:00:51.300> with<00:00:51.510> so

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
the lighthouse have to line up with so

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.590 
the lighthouse have to line up with so
you<00:00:52.410> know<00:00:52.530> there's<00:00:52.739> a<00:00:52.829> purple<00:00:53.129> dial<00:00:53.600> yellow

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
you know there's a purple dial yellow

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.840 
you know there's a purple dial yellow
orange<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:54.989> blue<00:00:55.260> so<00:00:55.680> you<00:00:55.949> know<00:00:56.550> we<00:00:56.699> have<00:00:56.820> to

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
orange and blue so you know we have to

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.470 
orange and blue so you know we have to
put<00:00:57.120> purple<00:00:57.840> on<00:00:58.289> six<00:00:58.890> now<00:00:59.219> setting<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.270> code

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
put purple on six now setting the code

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.970 
put purple on six now setting the code
is<00:01:00.899> another<00:01:01.230> matter<00:01:01.469> and<00:01:01.739> we're<00:01:01.829> actually

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
is another matter and we're actually

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.460 
is another matter and we're actually
going<00:01:02.219> to<00:01:02.309> do<00:01:02.399> a<00:01:02.430> separate<00:01:02.850> video<00:01:03.260> once<00:01:04.260> we

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
going to do a separate video once we

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.350 
going to do a separate video once we
solve<00:01:05.309> it<00:01:05.489> or<00:01:05.580> whatever<00:01:05.790> and<00:01:05.970> actually<00:01:06.330> show

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
solve it or whatever and actually show

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.700 
solve it or whatever and actually show
you<00:01:06.540> how<00:01:06.750> to<00:01:06.810> set<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.110> codes<00:01:07.320> because<00:01:07.500> it's

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
you how to set the codes because it's

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.789 
you how to set the codes because it's
pretty<00:01:07.950> Tim<00:01:08.159> complicated<00:01:09.439> because<00:01:10.439> some

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
pretty Tim complicated because some

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.950 
pretty Tim complicated because some
dials<00:01:11.130> affect<00:01:11.460> other<00:01:11.640> dials<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:12.240> they<00:01:12.570> change

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
dials affect other dials and they change

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.080 
dials affect other dials and they change
in<00:01:13.200> tandem<00:01:13.619> so<00:01:13.890> we're<00:01:14.610> looking<00:01:14.729> for<00:01:14.909> the

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
in tandem so we're looking for the

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.210 
in tandem so we're looking for the
second<00:01:15.570> one<00:01:15.720> here<00:01:16.110> which<00:01:16.710> is<00:01:16.890> close<00:01:17.189> to

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
second one here which is close to

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.880 
second one here which is close to
Juggernog<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.420> it's<00:01:19.110> on<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.350> floor<00:01:19.590> it's<00:01:19.710> the

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
Juggernog and it's on the floor it's the

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.969 
Juggernog and it's on the floor it's the
yellow<00:01:20.220> one<00:01:20.430> and<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:20.759> code<00:01:21.630> for<00:01:22.439> yellow<00:01:22.710> is

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
yellow one and the code for yellow is

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.810 
yellow one and the code for yellow is
too<00:01:24.439> okay<00:01:25.439> so<00:01:26.040> that's<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.310> second<00:01:26.670> piece<00:01:26.790> of

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
too okay so that's the second piece of

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.609 
too okay so that's the second piece of
paper<00:01:27.860> and<00:01:28.860> its<00:01:29.700> really<00:01:30.060> pretty<00:01:31.020> difficult<00:01:31.409> to

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
paper and its really pretty difficult to

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.380 
paper and its really pretty difficult to
find<00:01:31.829> I'm<00:01:32.070> not<00:01:32.310> going<00:01:32.549> to<00:01:32.640> say<00:01:32.790> we're<00:01:33.060> taking

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
find I'm not going to say we're taking

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.850 
find I'm not going to say we're taking
credit<00:01:33.750> for<00:01:33.780> finding<00:01:34.110> these<00:01:34.380> because<00:01:34.680> we've

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
credit for finding these because we've

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.100 
credit for finding these because we've
been<00:01:34.890> monitoring<00:01:35.340> a<00:01:35.670> bunch<00:01:36.270> of<00:01:36.420> forums<00:01:36.840> that

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
been monitoring a bunch of forums that

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.249 
been monitoring a bunch of forums that
have<00:01:37.290> actually<00:01:37.500> posted<00:01:39.049> where<00:01:40.049> these

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
have actually posted where these

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.219 
have actually posted where these
locations<00:01:40.950> are<00:01:41.189> we<00:01:41.670> actually<00:01:41.939> tried<00:01:42.299> a<00:01:42.329> code

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
locations are we actually tried a code

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.170 
locations are we actually tried a code
that<00:01:43.470> was<00:01:43.590> given<00:01:43.890> to<00:01:43.920> us<00:01:44.189> by<00:01:44.520> some<00:01:45.060> of<00:01:45.149> the

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
that was given to us by some of the

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.050 
that was given to us by some of the
radio<00:01:45.509> transmissions<00:01:46.200> for<00:01:47.009> a<00:01:47.070> journal<00:01:47.939> entry

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
radio transmissions for a journal entry

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.780 
radio transmissions for a journal entry
but<00:01:48.479> that<00:01:48.630> didn't<00:01:48.930> work<00:01:49.250> so<00:01:50.250> over<00:01:50.490> here<00:01:50.520> by

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
but that didn't work so over here by

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.969 
but that didn't work so over here by
standing<00:01:51.210> up<00:01:51.329> we<00:01:51.540> have<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:51.869> orange<00:01:52.049> which<00:01:52.740> is

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
standing up we have the orange which is

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.740 
standing up we have the orange which is
a<00:01:53.009> seven<00:01:53.700> and<00:01:54.439> that's<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.680> third<00:01:56.430> third<00:01:57.299> shred

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
a seven and that's the third third shred

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.350 
a seven and that's the third third shred
of<00:01:57.840> paper<00:01:58.020> here<00:01:58.320> and<00:01:58.469> this<00:01:59.009> fourth<00:01:59.340> shred<00:02:00.270> of

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
of paper here and this fourth shred of

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.300 
of paper here and this fourth shred of
paper<00:02:00.509> coming<00:02:00.869> up<00:02:00.990> here<00:02:01.290> which<00:02:01.770> is<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.100> blue

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
paper coming up here which is the blue

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.160 
paper coming up here which is the blue
one<00:02:02.579> was<00:02:02.850> actually<00:02:03.030> pretty<00:02:03.479> difficult<00:02:03.840> to

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
one was actually pretty difficult to

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.810 
one was actually pretty difficult to
find<00:02:04.380> I<00:02:04.500> think<00:02:04.530> a<00:02:04.890> lot<00:02:05.280> of<00:02:05.310> people<00:02:05.369> had<00:02:05.610> found

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
find I think a lot of people had found

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.570 
find I think a lot of people had found
these<00:02:06.060> first<00:02:06.329> three<00:02:06.659> and<00:02:06.899> then<00:02:07.560> this<00:02:08.190> fourth

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
these first three and then this fourth

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.490 
these first three and then this fourth
one<00:02:08.789> is<00:02:08.940> actually<00:02:09.239> located<00:02:09.479> in<00:02:10.110> the

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
one is actually located in the

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.240 
one is actually located in the
lighthouse<00:02:10.709> itself

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
lighthouse itself

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.580 
lighthouse itself
so<00:02:12.910> we're<00:02:13.060> just<00:02:13.360> getting<00:02:13.990> a<00:02:14.050> good<00:02:14.200> luck<00:02:14.440> of

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
so we're just getting a good luck of

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.710 
so we're just getting a good luck of
where<00:02:15.190> we're<00:02:15.280> going<00:02:15.400> to<00:02:15.460> go<00:02:15.610> in<00:02:15.760> here<00:02:15.790> so<00:02:16.600> we're

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
where we're going to go in here so we're

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.670 
where we're going to go in here so we're
going<00:02:16.810> to<00:02:16.900> go<00:02:16.960> down<00:02:17.200> here<00:02:17.650> start<00:02:18.430> to<00:02:18.490> the<00:02:18.700> day

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
going to go down here start to the day

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.650 
going to go down here start to the day
our<00:02:20.680> back<00:02:20.950> I'm<00:02:21.130> sorry<00:02:21.400> too<00:02:21.640> I<00:02:22.150> think<00:02:22.540> we're

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
our back I'm sorry too I think we're

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.980 
our back I'm sorry too I think we're
mid-level<00:02:24.330> approximately<00:02:25.330> mid-level<00:02:25.780> I'm

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
mid-level approximately mid-level I'm

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:27.750 
mid-level approximately mid-level I'm
not<00:02:26.110> sure<00:02:26.260> there's<00:02:26.440> actually<00:02:26.740> four<00:02:27.430> levels

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
not sure there's actually four levels

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:28.830 
not sure there's actually four levels
i'm<00:02:27.880> not<00:02:28.030> sure<00:02:28.150> if<00:02:28.210> we're<00:02:28.330> on<00:02:28.390> the<00:02:28.420> second<00:02:28.780> or

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
i'm not sure if we're on the second or

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.690 
i'm not sure if we're on the second or
third<00:02:28.900> but<00:02:29.590> there's<00:02:29.800> the<00:02:30.070> blue<00:02:30.280> piece<00:02:30.520> of

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
third but there's the blue piece of

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.360 
third but there's the blue piece of
paper<00:02:30.850> right<00:02:31.120> there<00:02:31.360> and<00:02:31.630> it's<00:02:31.870> a<00:02:31.959> four<00:02:32.370> all

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
paper right there and it's a four all

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.330 
paper right there and it's a four all
right<00:02:33.550> so<00:02:33.870> we're<00:02:34.870> actually<00:02:35.050> right<00:02:35.590> now<00:02:35.830> I<00:02:35.860> mean

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
right so we're actually right now I mean

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.670 
right so we're actually right now I mean
we're<00:02:36.550> in<00:02:36.610> the<00:02:36.700> process<00:02:36.880> of<00:02:37.330> of<00:02:38.200> setting<00:02:38.650> the

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
we're in the process of of setting the

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.220 
we're in the process of of setting the
codes<00:02:39.209> but<00:02:40.209> I<00:02:40.270> don't<00:02:40.450> think<00:02:40.660> it's<00:02:40.780> just<00:02:40.870> the

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
codes but I don't think it's just the

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.110 
codes but I don't think it's just the
codes<00:02:41.590> that<00:02:42.040> do<00:02:42.250> something<00:02:42.610> I<00:02:42.640> don't<00:02:42.730> think<00:02:42.970> if

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
codes that do something I don't think if

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.670 
codes that do something I don't think if
you<00:02:43.209> just<00:02:43.240> set<00:02:43.630> the<00:02:43.750> code<00:02:43.959> all<00:02:44.290> of<00:02:44.410> a<00:02:44.440> sudden

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
you just set the code all of a sudden

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.320 
you just set the code all of a sudden
that<00:02:44.709> something's<00:02:45.160> going<00:02:45.190> to<00:02:45.340> happen<00:02:45.400> I<00:02:45.790> think

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
that something's going to happen I think

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:47.610 
that something's going to happen I think
you<00:02:46.420> have<00:02:46.540> to<00:02:46.630> do<00:02:46.750> something<00:02:47.140> else<00:02:47.260> either

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
you have to do something else either

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.729 
you have to do something else either
before<00:02:47.950> or<00:02:48.190> after<00:02:48.310> you<00:02:48.670> set<00:02:48.910> the<00:02:49.030> code<00:02:49.270> and

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
before or after you set the code and

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:51.660 
before or after you set the code and
that's<00:02:50.739> what<00:02:50.920> we're<00:02:51.010> going<00:02:51.100> to<00:02:51.190> work<00:02:51.340> on<00:02:51.489> right

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
that's what we're going to work on right

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.050 
that's what we're going to work on right
