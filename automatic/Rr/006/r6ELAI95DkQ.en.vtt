00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.020 
but I really did enjoy the artwork I
thought<00:01:58.110> it<00:01:58.170> was<00:01:58.290> a<00:01:58.469> pretty<00:01:58.649> good<00:01:58.740> intro<00:01:59.280> to<00:01:59.340> 20

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
thought it was a pretty good intro to 20

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
as I as I wanted to but I definitely

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.160

enjoyed<00:02:06.979> the<00:02:07.979> ride<00:02:08.190> I<00:02:08.940> felt<00:02:09.629> it<00:02:09.750> was<00:02:09.929> kind<00:02:10.110> of

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
enjoyed the ride I felt it was kind of

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.710 
enjoyed the ride I felt it was kind of
the<00:02:10.289> opposite<00:02:10.619> of<00:02:10.739> a<00:02:10.800> Batman<00:02:11.190> book<00:02:11.459> it<00:02:11.760> was<00:02:12.150> so

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
the opposite of a Batman book it was so

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.790 
the opposite of a Batman book it was so
vibrant<00:02:13.080> and<00:02:13.410> color

off-putting<00:02:17.850> but<00:02:17.970> it<00:02:18.210> was<00:02:18.390> just<00:02:18.630> a<00:02:18.930> surprise

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
off-putting but it was just a surprise
