00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
inches and also won 42 inches and what's

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.910 
inches and also won 42 inches and what's
cool<00:00:51.000> is<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.420> yields<00:00:51.989> for<00:00:52.199> each<00:00:52.350> one<00:00:52.649> of<00:00:52.680> those

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
cool is the yields for each one of those

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.880 
cool is the yields for each one of those
for<00:00:53.219> binding<00:00:53.460> are<00:00:53.879> on<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.239> ruler<00:00:54.480> and<00:00:54.890> also

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
for binding are on the ruler and also

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.130 
for binding are on the ruler and also
the<00:00:56.160> instructions<00:00:56.879> are<00:00:57.210> all<00:00:57.420> on<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.780> roller

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
the instructions are all on the roller

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.170 
the instructions are all on the roller
so<00:00:58.890> you<00:00:58.980> don't<00:00:59.280> have<00:00:59.430> to<00:00:59.609> find<00:00:59.820> a<00:00:59.940> piece<00:01:00.149> of

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
so you don't have to find a piece of

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.000 
so you don't have to find a piece of
paper<00:01:00.449> to<00:01:00.780> make<00:01:00.809> it<00:01:01.109> work<00:01:01.260> you<00:01:01.500> can<00:01:01.680> read<00:01:01.859> the

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
paper to make it work you can read the

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.009 
paper to make it work you can read the
instructions<00:01:02.579> right<00:01:02.789> on<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.090> ruler<00:01:03.329> so<00:01:03.930> I'm

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
instructions right on the ruler so I'm

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.679 
instructions right on the ruler so I'm
going<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.199> demonstrate<00:01:04.409> for<00:01:05.100> you<00:01:05.250> today<00:01:05.689> how

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
going to demonstrate for you today how

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.020 
going to demonstrate for you today how
to<00:01:06.720> fold<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.229> fabric<00:01:07.710> to<00:01:07.920> cut<00:01:08.159> it<00:01:08.310> into<00:01:08.520> bias

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
to fold the fabric to cut it into bias

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.920 
to fold the fabric to cut it into bias
strips<00:01:09.479> I<00:01:09.810> really<00:01:10.590> prefer<00:01:10.799> bias<00:01:11.310> and<00:01:11.840> if<00:01:12.840> you

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
strips I really prefer bias and if you

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.140 
strips I really prefer bias and if you
want<00:01:13.110> to<00:01:13.200> hear<00:01:13.560> more<00:01:13.770> why<00:01:14.100> you<00:01:14.640> can<00:01:14.820> go<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:14.970> my

website anything before calm and watch
the<00:01:18.360> video<00:01:19.580> so<00:01:20.580> first<00:01:21.210> fold<00:01:21.630> is<00:01:22.049> from<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:22.979> top

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
the video so first fold is from the top

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.999 
the video so first fold is from the top
corner<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.030> left<00:01:24.060> bottom<00:01:25.020> and<00:01:25.560> now<00:01:25.950> we

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
corner to the left bottom and now we

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.880 
corner to the left bottom and now we
have<00:01:26.189> something<00:01:26.790> that's<00:01:26.970> coming<00:01:27.650> pointy<00:01:28.650> and

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
have something that's coming pointy and

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.310 
have something that's coming pointy and
now<00:01:29.130> we're<00:01:29.340> going<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.610> fold<00:01:29.880> it<00:01:30.060> again<00:01:32.030> and<00:01:33.320> now

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
now we're going to fold it again and now

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.600 
now we're going to fold it again and now
we<00:01:34.380> have<00:01:34.650> something<00:01:34.860> that<00:01:35.159> kind<00:01:35.369> of<00:01:35.430> looks

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
we have something that kind of looks

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.560 
we have something that kind of looks
like<00:01:35.700> a<00:01:35.820> house<00:01:36.119> okay<00:01:37.790> so<00:01:38.790> we're<00:01:39.150> going<00:01:39.329> to

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
like a house okay so we're going to

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.639 
like a house okay so we're going to
remove<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:41.060> side<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.509> edge<00:01:42.689> that<00:01:43.170> has<00:01:43.409> the

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
remove the side the edge that has the

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.399 
remove the side the edge that has the
double<00:01:44.040> fold<00:01:44.640> so<00:01:45.240> this<00:01:45.450> edge<00:01:45.659> is<00:01:45.689> one<00:01:46.110> fold

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
double fold so this edge is one fold

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.700 
double fold so this edge is one fold
this<00:01:46.649> one<00:01:46.860> is<00:01:46.979> too<00:01:47.810> I'm<00:01:48.810> just<00:01:49.079> going<00:01:49.320> to<00:01:49.380> trim

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
this one is too I'm just going to trim

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:55.220 
this one is too I'm just going to trim
that<00:01:49.770> off<00:01:50.250> on<00:01:50.909> eighth<00:01:51.540> of<00:01:51.780> an<00:01:51.899> inch

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:55.230 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.380 

alright<00:01:56.230> and<00:01:56.560> now<00:01:57.190> the<00:01:57.250> easiest<00:01:57.880> thing<00:01:57.940> to<00:01:58.210> do

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
alright and now the easiest thing to do

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.390 
alright and now the easiest thing to do
actually<00:01:58.720> is<00:01:59.020> to<00:01:59.290> turn<00:01:59.530> the<00:01:59.740> mat<00:01:59.980> around

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:00.400 
actually is to turn the mat around

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.240 
actually is to turn the mat around
because<00:02:00.820> this<00:02:01.030> is<00:02:01.180> bias<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:02.740> fabrics<00:02:03.160> you

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
because this is bias the fabrics you

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.700 
because this is bias the fabrics you
really<00:02:03.460> want<00:02:03.640> to<00:02:03.730> wiggle<00:02:04.120> and<00:02:04.450> move<00:02:04.630> but<00:02:05.440> I'm

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
really want to wiggle and move but I'm

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.320 
really want to wiggle and move but I'm
going<00:02:06.010> to<00:02:06.190> just<00:02:06.370> flip<00:02:06.580> it<00:02:06.640> around<00:02:06.850> because<00:02:07.060> I'm

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 
going to just flip it around because I'm

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.970 
going to just flip it around because I'm
right-handed<00:02:08.580> okay<00:02:10.320> now<00:02:11.320> we're<00:02:11.560> going<00:02:11.620> to<00:02:11.710> lay

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
right-handed okay now we're going to lay

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.120 
right-handed okay now we're going to lay
that<00:02:12.010> right<00:02:12.550> where<00:02:12.790> we<00:02:12.940> just<00:02:13.210> cut<00:02:13.540> and<00:02:14.130> we're

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
that right where we just cut and we're

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.330 
that right where we just cut and we're
going<00:02:15.370> to<00:02:15.550> cut<00:02:16.260> I<00:02:17.260> like<00:02:17.710> mine<00:02:17.890> two<00:02:18.130> and<00:02:18.280> a

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
going to cut I like mine two and a

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.340 
going to cut I like mine two and a
quarter<00:02:18.640> so<00:02:19.090> we're<00:02:19.270> going<00:02:19.510> to<00:02:19.660> cut<00:02:19.870> it<00:02:19.990> two<00:02:20.200> and

quarter so we're going to cut it two and

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:26.400 
quarter so we're going to cut it two and
a<00:02:20.410> quarter<00:02:20.650> inches<00:02:24.090> so<00:02:25.090> in<00:02:25.360> this<00:02:25.570> yield<00:02:26.050> we

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
a quarter inches so in this yield we

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.520 
a quarter inches so in this yield we
will<00:02:26.620> get<00:02:26.860> two<00:02:27.520> strips<00:02:28.240> that<00:02:28.600> are<00:02:28.750> rather<00:02:29.110> long

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
will get two strips that are rather long

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.090 
will get two strips that are rather long
that<00:02:30.010> are<00:02:30.430> two<00:02:31.210> and<00:02:31.390> a<00:02:31.420> quarter<00:02:31.630> inches<00:02:32.100> and

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
that are two and a quarter inches and

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.320 
that are two and a quarter inches and
when<00:02:33.250> you<00:02:33.340> go<00:02:33.460> to<00:02:33.520> put<00:02:33.790> these<00:02:33.970> together<00:02:36.330> you

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
when you go to put these together you

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.960 
when you go to put these together you
just<00:02:37.360> fold<00:02:38.080> these<00:02:38.320> over<00:02:38.830> and<00:02:39.010> you<00:02:39.400> let<00:02:39.610> the<00:02:39.760> dog

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
just fold these over and you let the dog

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.700 
just fold these over and you let the dog
ears<00:02:40.270> hang<00:02:40.540> off<00:02:40.750> and<00:02:41.140> you<00:02:42.010> so<00:02:42.310> from<00:02:43.320> crevice<00:02:44.320> to

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:44.710 
ears hang off and you so from crevice to

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:47.400 
ears hang off and you so from crevice to
crevice<00:02:45.220> where<00:02:45.600> the<00:02:46.600> little<00:02:46.750> points<00:02:47.230> are

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
crevice where the little points are

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.710 
crevice where the little points are
leaving<00:02:48.370> that<00:02:48.520> quarter<00:02:48.850> inch<00:02:49.030> seam<00:02:49.300> so<00:02:49.570> we're

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
leaving that quarter inch seam so we're

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.620 
leaving that quarter inch seam so we're
going<00:02:49.840> to<00:02:49.900> keep<00:02:50.110> cut<00:02:50.550> alright<00:02:51.550> and<00:02:51.760> now<00:02:52.540> the

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
going to keep cut alright and now the

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.870 
going to keep cut alright and now the
easiest<00:02:53.230> thing<00:02:53.290> to<00:02:53.560> do<00:02:53.740> actually<00:02:54.070> is<00:02:54.370> to<00:02:54.640> turn

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
easiest thing to do actually is to turn

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.110 
easiest thing to do actually is to turn
the<00:02:55.120> mat<00:02:55.330> around<00:02:55.780> because<00:02:56.170> this<00:02:56.350> is<00:02:56.410> bias<00:02:57.120> the

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
the mat around because this is bias the

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.000 
the mat around because this is bias the
fabrics<00:02:58.510> really<00:02:58.810> want<00:02:58.989> to<00:02:59.080> wiggle<00:02:59.500> and<00:02:59.800> move

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
fabrics really want to wiggle and move

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.190 
fabrics really want to wiggle and move
but<00:03:00.790> I'm<00:03:01.060> going<00:03:01.420> to<00:03:01.540> just<00:03:01.720> flip<00:03:01.930> it<00:03:01.989> around

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
but I'm going to just flip it around

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.900 
but I'm going to just flip it around
because<00:03:02.500> I'm<00:03:02.680> right-handed<00:03:03.930> okay<00:03:05.700> now<00:03:06.700> we're

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
because I'm right-handed okay now we're

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:08.550 
because I'm right-handed okay now we're
going<00:03:07.000> to<00:03:07.090> lay<00:03:07.330> that<00:03:07.360> right<00:03:07.900> where<00:03:08.140> we<00:03:08.320> just

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
going to lay that right where we just

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.229 
going to lay that right where we just
cut<00:03:08.890> and<00:03:09.510> we're<00:03:10.510> going<00:03:10.750> to<00:03:10.810> cut<00:03:11.580> I<00:03:12.580> like<00:03:13.060> mine

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
cut and we're going to cut I like mine

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:15.210 
cut and we're going to cut I like mine
two<00:03:13.480> and<00:03:13.660> a<00:03:13.690> quarter<00:03:13.989> so<00:03:14.440> we're<00:03:14.620> going<00:03:14.830> to<00:03:15.010> cut

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
two and a quarter so we're going to cut

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:20.910 
two and a quarter so we're going to cut
it<00:03:15.340> two<00:03:15.550> and<00:03:15.730> a<00:03:15.760> quarter<00:03:16.000> inches<00:03:19.440> so<00:03:20.440> in<00:03:20.739> this

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
it two and a quarter inches so in this

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.090 
it two and a quarter inches so in this
yield<00:03:21.400> we<00:03:21.760> will<00:03:21.970> get<00:03:22.209> two<00:03:22.870> strips<00:03:23.590> that<00:03:23.950> are

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100 
yield we will get two strips that are

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.970 
yield we will get two strips that are
rather<00:03:24.489> long<00:03:24.880> that<00:03:25.330> are<00:03:25.780> two<00:03:26.560> and<00:03:26.739> a<00:03:26.770> quarter

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
rather long that are two and a quarter

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.310 
rather long that are two and a quarter
inches<00:03:27.270> and<00:03:28.270> when<00:03:28.600> you<00:03:28.690> go<00:03:28.810> to<00:03:28.870> put<00:03:29.140> these

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:29.320 
inches and when you go to put these

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:34.440 
inches and when you go to put these
together<00:03:31.680> you<00:03:32.680> just<00:03:32.920> fold<00:03:33.459> these<00:03:33.670> over<00:03:34.180> and

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
together you just fold these over and

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.650 
together you just fold these over and
you<00:03:34.780> let<00:03:34.959> the<00:03:35.110> dog<00:03:35.320> ears<00:03:35.620> hang<00:03:35.890> off<00:03:36.100> and<00:03:36.489> you<00:03:37.390> so

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
you let the dog ears hang off and you so

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:42.120 
you let the dog ears hang off and you so
from<00:03:38.670> crevice<00:03:39.670> to<00:03:40.060> crevice<00:03:40.600> where<00:03:40.950> the<00:03:41.950> little

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130 
from crevice to crevice where the little

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.370 
from crevice to crevice where the little
points<00:03:42.610> are<00:03:42.760> leaving<00:03:43.720> that<00:03:43.870> quarter<00:03:44.230> inch

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
points are leaving that quarter inch

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:58.960 
points are leaving that quarter inch
same<00:03:44.680> so<00:03:44.920> we're<00:03:45.070> going<00:03:45.160> to<00:03:45.250> keep<00:03:45.459> cutting

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:01.640 

so<00:03:59.970> the<00:04:00.120> directions<00:04:00.690> are<00:04:00.810> right<00:04:01.050> on<00:04:01.260> the<00:04:01.290> ruler

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
so the directions are right on the ruler

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.320 
so the directions are right on the ruler
to<00:04:02.930> help<00:04:03.930> you<00:04:04.170> sew<00:04:05.010> those<00:04:05.250> together<00:04:05.490> as<00:04:06.030> well

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
when we get close to the end I don't use

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.420 
when we get close to the end I don't use
these<00:04:09.960> little<00:04:10.230> pieces<00:04:10.410> we<00:04:10.770> just<00:04:10.950> toss<00:04:11.160> those

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.050 
these little pieces we just toss those
away<00:04:11.700> we<00:04:12.540> refold<00:04:13.320> from<00:04:13.980> the<00:04:14.100> top<00:04:14.340> corner<00:04:14.730> to

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
away we refold from the top corner to

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:26.210 
away we refold from the top corner to
the<00:04:15.180> bottom<00:04:15.630> and<00:04:16.489> keep<00:04:17.489> cutting<00:04:24.440> and<00:04:25.440> you<00:04:26.070> just

continue this way until you get down to

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.470 
continue this way until you get down to
that<00:04:28.740> last<00:04:28.980> corner<00:04:29.520> and<00:04:29.880> we<00:04:30.060> don't<00:04:30.180> use<00:04:30.450> that

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:30.480 
that last corner and we don't use that

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:35.030 
that last corner and we don't use that
either<00:04:30.900> then<00:04:31.890> you<00:04:32.130> sew<00:04:32.340> them<00:04:32.580> together<00:04:34.040> fold
