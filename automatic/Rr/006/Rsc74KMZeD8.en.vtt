 I've done a lot of things I'm not proud of. 

00:00:08.472 --> 00:00:09.719
 I hurt many people. 

00:00:12.213 --> 00:00:14.238
 You can't go on like this. 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.277
 Help me. 

00:00:18.138 --> 00:00:20.319
 INSPIRED BY A REAL STORY 

00:00:20.354 --> 00:00:22.075

 I'm here today to talk about families like yours ... 

00:00:28.586 --> 00:00:31.637
 ... on the other side of Earth that desperately need your help. 

00:00:33.214 --> 00:00:34.945
 I thought I'd go there. 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.735
 - To Africa? - I think they won't be against when someone helps them. 

00:00:38.585 --> 00:00:40.076

 He was looking for something he could believe in 

00:00:59.391 --> 00:01:01.731
 It is safer to sleep here than in your own homes. 

00:01:01.766 --> 00:01:03.106
 They're not going to sleep out here. 

00:01:03.141 --> 00:01:05.269
 They are power, we can't help them all. 

00:01:06.096 --> 00:01:07.599
 He found something 

00:01:08.434 --> 00:01:10.038
 We have to take as much as we can. 

00:01:10.073 --> 00:01:11.497

00:01:13.136 --> 00:01:15.085
 WHAT TO FIGHT 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.148
 I need money for another vehicle ... 

00:01:17.183 --> 00:01:19.585
 - ... to save some children. - Calm down! 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:20.773
 Don't tell me to calm down.

 He talks about you. 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:31.625
 ...children. 

00:01:31.937 --> 00:01:33.511
 I'm just trying to help those people. 

00:01:33.916 --> 00:01:34.927
 Same as you. 

00:01:37.391 --> 00:01:40.038
 The whole army of rebels put a reward on your head. 

00:01:40.073 --> 00:01:41.597
 I guess I'm doing something good. 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:46.833
 They burned it. 

00:01:47.226 --> 00:01:48.858
 Nothing left. It's end.

 She won't wait! 

00:02:03.434 --> 00:02:05.085
 This country doesn't need more weapons. 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.176
 You fight evil here and I'll fight there.
