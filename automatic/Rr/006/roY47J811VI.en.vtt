00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:08.610
 sports car icon and dream car the 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:11.570
 Porsche 911 unmistakable for mac engine 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.570
 rear drive 

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:18.190
 this Zuffenhausener offers as 991 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:20.800
 not only razor-sharp driving dynamics 

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:23.970
 but also long-distance suitable gt 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.970
 Ambience in the interior 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:32.970
 synonymous with speed and comfort 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:32.970
 the seven-speed dual-clutch transmission 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:40.800
 carrera s that means 400 ps 9 5 liters 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.080
 on 100 kilometers only at tempo 300 4 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:48.020
 the elf runs out of steam 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:50.879
 basic price 105,000 173 euro 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.230
 we're sitting here in the Porsche 911 I have to 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.239
 So the key in the left hand 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.690
 take because traditionally that sits 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:01.650
 ignition lock at porsche is already 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.580
 shows he is going on is always beautiful 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:06.559
 a pleasure again 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.559
 to hear this engine 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:14.610
 as a driver is currently going on in automatic mode 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:17.390
 that's better 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.890
 influences the switch but by hand 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.070
 nothing against the dual-clutch transmission 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.479
 it switches really nice soon have 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.090
 I prefer to pull on the paddle and 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:27.979
 definitely turned on so much 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.450
 own initiative must be self in the 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:32.330
 sports car still be or maybe 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:35.770
 especially in the sports car and already the 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:38.119
 curves loshay yes yes that's cool though 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:41.600
 there's just the sports car that 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:44.000
 really fun makes Porsche 911 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:54.380
 a world success despite or just because 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:57.860
 its technical idiosyncrasy 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:00.890
 interesting on 9 11 is yes he is 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.750
 actually bad in concept 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.539
 car namely rear engine what is this 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:08.149
 actually completely outdated builds today 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:10.580
 to get back the motor as a middle motor one 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:13.060
 or as and motor porsche always does 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.860
 never before the beetle behind the axis 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.260
 But the engineers have it easy 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.720
 never managed this concept 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.180
 tell it to refine that 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.519
 Nineteen in today's form the best 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.440
 all time is 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:29.780
 He is as easy to drive as never 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.140
 also contributes to the slightly longer 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.280
 wheelbase compared to its predecessor at 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.780
 that could be the reason for fear 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.450
 even fewer will be complete 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:43.060
 unfounded Quite to the contrary of 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.060
 Porsche loves curves like never before 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.000
 The helpers are pretty much today 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.520
 luxuriously equipped and already gets 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.900
 that would come from the new el hassan yes that 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.180
 is not a real sports car 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.630
 more with all the luxury, the total 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.580
 nonsense 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.770
 the work comes with everything 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:04.170
 you need this wonderful one 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:06.030
 motor the wonderful landing gear this 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.670
 steering everything in sports cars 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.530
 and even if you give them one 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.420
 he gets a little more outfit 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.040
 that's why not less sports cars why 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.330
 his character also changes 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.010
 not and it gets so much heavier then 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.680
 neither does it really only speak 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.870
 one against a helper to buy the 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.440
 is a price oh no one speaks another 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.360
 on the other hand 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.540
 there is still the cayman that much 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:31.580
 cheaper and actually does the same 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.580
 Have fun as I take with the cayman
