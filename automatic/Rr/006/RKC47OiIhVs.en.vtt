to get out in transition especially on

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.310 
to get out in transition especially on
turnover<00:00:09.059> so<00:00:09.300> we<00:00:09.450> know<00:00:09.570> I've<00:00:09.719> got<00:00:10.019> to<00:00:10.139> take

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.780 
turnover so we know I've got to take
care<00:00:10.349> of<00:00:10.530> the<00:00:10.620> ball<00:00:10.740> and<00:00:11.010> we<00:00:11.280> know<00:00:11.400> they<00:00:11.580> see<00:00:11.759> a

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.910 
care of the ball and we know they see a
lot<00:00:12.000> of<00:00:12.030> threes<00:00:12.330> or<00:00:12.690> think<00:00:13.469> fourth<00:00:13.710> in<00:00:13.830> the

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
lot of threes or think fourth in the

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.390 
lot of threes or think fourth in the
country<00:00:14.309> on<00:00:15.440> three-point<00:00:16.440> attempts<00:00:16.830> so<00:00:17.160> we

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
country on three-point attempts so we

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.840 
country on three-point attempts so we
know<00:00:17.490> we<00:00:17.609> have<00:00:17.640> to<00:00:17.760> get<00:00:18.690> out<00:00:18.840> on<00:00:18.869> shooters<00:00:19.230> and

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:19.850 
know we have to get out on shooters and

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:30.820 
know we have to get out on shooters and
just<00:00:20.850> keep<00:00:21.000> our<00:00:21.150> guy<00:00:21.240> in<00:00:21.359> front<00:00:21.510> of<00:00:21.600> us<00:00:23.180> a<00:00:24.180> lot

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:30.830 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.340 

of<00:00:31.830> ball<00:00:32.070> pressure<00:00:32.309> lot<00:00:33.090> of<00:00:33.120> deflections<00:00:33.780> so

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
of ball pressure lot of deflections so

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.650 
of ball pressure lot of deflections so
we're<00:00:34.530> going<00:00:34.620> to<00:00:34.770> take<00:00:34.980> care<00:00:35.160> of<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.309> ball<00:00:35.460> and

we're going to take care of the ball and

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.380 
we're going to take care of the ball and
make<00:00:36.660> good<00:00:37.290> decisions<00:00:37.440> uh<00:00:38.010> you<00:00:38.940> know<00:00:39.059> make<00:00:39.360> the

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
make good decisions uh you know make the

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:52.580 
make good decisions uh you know make the
right<00:00:39.600> pass<00:00:39.809> make<00:00:40.290> right<00:00:40.500> place<00:00:51.199> yeah<00:00:52.199> it's

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
right pass make right place yeah it's

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.420 
right pass make right place yeah it's
tough<00:00:53.039> let's<00:00:53.280> see<00:00:54.829> hey<00:00:55.829> I<00:00:55.860> mean<00:00:56.280> they're<00:00:56.399> just

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
tough let's see hey I mean they're just

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.490 
tough let's see hey I mean they're just
quick<00:00:56.789> so<00:00:57.000> i<00:00:57.030> guess<00:00:57.329> vc<00:00:57.750> would<00:00:57.989> be<00:00:58.140> a<00:00:58.170> good

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
quick so i guess vc would be a good

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.080 
quick so i guess vc would be a good
comparison<00:00:58.890> just<00:00:59.340> because<00:00:59.520> i<00:00:59.670> could<00:00:59.879> get<00:00:59.969> up

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
comparison just because i could get up

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.819 
comparison just because i could get up
in<00:01:00.210> a<00:01:00.270> ball<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:00.480> press<00:01:00.719> you<00:01:00.930> a<00:01:00.960> lot<00:01:01.109> so<00:01:01.140> that's

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
in a ball and press you a lot so that's

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:15.080 
in a ball and press you a lot so that's
the<00:01:02.250> one<00:01:02.399> that<00:01:02.489> just<00:01:02.550> comes<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:03.210> mind<00:01:14.090> because

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
the one that just comes to mind because

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.609 
the one that just comes to mind because
we're<00:01:15.360> approaching<00:01:15.630> every<00:01:16.080> game<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.409> same

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
we're approaching every game the same

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.640 
we're approaching every game the same
way<00:01:16.650> so<00:01:17.299> you<00:01:18.299> know<00:01:18.420> we're<00:01:19.320> going<00:01:19.409> to<00:01:19.470> get

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
way so you know we're going to get

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.230 
way so you know we're going to get
everybody's<00:01:20.100> best<00:01:20.130> shot<00:01:20.580> and<00:01:20.759> they<00:01:20.970> got<00:01:21.150> to

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
everybody's best shot and they got to

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.120 
everybody's best shot and they got to
get<00:01:21.360> our<00:01:21.450> best<00:01:21.689> shot<00:01:21.869> as<00:01:22.020> well<00:01:22.170> so<00:01:22.470> we<00:01:22.590> can't<00:01:22.830> we

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
get our best shot as well so we can't we

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:38.469 
get our best shot as well so we can't we
can't<00:01:23.369> afford<00:01:23.520> to<00:01:23.820> play<00:01:23.939> like<00:01:24.180> that

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:41.810

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
just festering yo ya know there's no set

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.929 
just festering yo ya know there's no set

cody<00:01:48.149> gets<00:01:48.299> on<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.630> floor<00:01:48.810> that's<00:01:49.560> a

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:08.540 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:11.180 

just<00:02:09.540> more<00:02:09.690> practice<00:02:10.110> time<00:02:10.140> more<00:02:10.560> time<00:02:10.920> for<00:02:11.130> us

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
just more practice time more time for us

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.770 
just more practice time more time for us
to<00:02:11.250> go<00:02:11.400> out<00:02:11.520> there<00:02:11.700> and<00:02:11.790> get<00:02:11.880> better<00:02:12.060> in<00:02:12.360> in

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
to go out there and get better in in

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.650 
to go out there and get better in in
practice<00:02:13.350> as<00:02:14.310> far<00:02:14.520> as<00:02:14.610> how<00:02:15.060> we<00:02:15.120> approach<00:02:15.510> the

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
practice as far as how we approach the

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.180 
practice as far as how we approach the
game<00:02:15.870> you<00:02:16.200> know<00:02:16.290> it's<00:02:16.440> the<00:02:16.470> same<00:02:16.740> way<00:02:16.950> every

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
game you know it's the same way every

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.930 
game you know it's the same way every
time<00:02:17.220> but<00:02:17.760> just<00:02:19.130> more<00:02:20.130> time<00:02:20.370> maybe<00:02:20.670> a<00:02:20.760> little

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
time but just more time maybe a little

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.630 
time but just more time maybe a little
bit<00:02:21.170> different<00:02:22.170> as<00:02:22.410> far<00:02:22.920> as<00:02:23.040> different<00:02:23.400> rest

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
bit different as far as different rest

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.700 
bit different as far as different rest
times<00:02:23.970> and<00:02:24.270> that<00:02:24.330> kind<00:02:24.600> of<00:02:24.630> thing<00:02:24.720> but<00:02:25.080> also

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
times and that kind of thing but also

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.920 
times and that kind of thing but also
competing<00:02:26.340> in<00:02:26.490> practice<00:02:26.970> and<00:02:27.270> that<00:02:27.600> kind<00:02:27.870> of

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
competing in practice and that kind of

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.770 
competing in practice and that kind of
stuff<00:02:27.990> so<00:02:28.470> it's<00:02:29.400> not<00:02:29.520> it's<00:02:30.270> a<00:02:30.390> little<00:02:30.660> bit

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
stuff so it's not it's a little bit

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.510 
stuff so it's not it's a little bit
different<00:02:31.110> because<00:02:31.170> you<00:02:31.710> know<00:02:31.800> you<00:02:32.250> like<00:02:32.400> to

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
different because you know you like to

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.520 
different because you know you like to
play<00:02:32.670> a<00:02:32.700> lot<00:02:32.850> of<00:02:32.940> games<00:02:33.120> but<00:02:33.270> then<00:02:33.600> again<00:02:33.720> it's

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
play a lot of games but then again it's

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:35.720 
play a lot of games but then again it's
also<00:02:34.710> time<00:02:34.950> for<00:02:35.010> us<00:02:35.250> to<00:02:35.280> get<00:02:35.460> better<00:02:35.640> in

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
also time for us to get better in

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:46.910 
also time for us to get better in
practice<00:02:44.030> it's<00:02:45.030> gone<00:02:45.240> pretty<00:02:45.510> smoothly<00:02:45.930> from

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
practice it's gone pretty smoothly from

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.520 
practice it's gone pretty smoothly from
taking<00:02:47.610> summer<00:02:48.090> classes<00:02:48.270> so<00:02:48.780> we<00:02:49.110> kind<00:02:49.320> of<00:02:49.380> got

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
taking summer classes so we kind of got

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.310 
taking summer classes so we kind of got
acclimated<00:02:50.280> before<00:02:50.970> everyone<00:02:51.210> else<00:02:51.330> did<00:02:51.630> so<00:02:52.020> I

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
acclimated before everyone else did so I

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.370 
acclimated before everyone else did so I
say<00:02:53.010> it's<00:02:53.160> been<00:02:53.250> a<00:02:53.280> pretty<00:02:53.550> easy<00:02:54.380> transition

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
say it's been a pretty easy transition

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.470 
say it's been a pretty easy transition
and<00:02:55.590> looking<00:02:56.370> to<00:02:56.460> finish<00:02:56.610> up<00:02:56.880> the<00:02:57.060> semester

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
and looking to finish up the semester
