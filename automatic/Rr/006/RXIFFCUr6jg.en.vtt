around now to the back this case has a
lot<00:02:27.450> of<00:02:27.480> thumb<00:02:27.990> screws<00:02:28.410> I<00:02:28.620> noticed<00:02:29.010> everything

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
lot of thumb screws I noticed everything

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.170 
lot of thumb screws I noticed everything
is<00:02:29.520> held<00:02:29.700> on<00:02:29.790> by<00:02:29.850> thumb<00:02:30.180> screws<00:02:31.640> so<00:02:32.640> taking<00:02:33.150> a

your system cool keeps it running for a
long<00:03:17.100> time<00:03:17.370> now<00:03:17.940> this<00:03:18.680> case<00:03:19.680> was<00:03:20.010> designed

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
long time now this case was designed

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:24.800 
long time now this case was designed
with<00:03:21.060> a<00:03:21.090> full<00:03:21.720> ATX<00:03:22.680> PSU<00:03:23.070> space<00:03:23.940> in<00:03:24.209> mind<00:03:24.570> which

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
with a full ATX PSU space in mind which

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.720 
with a full ATX PSU space in mind which
is<00:03:24.959> awesome<00:03:25.410> because<00:03:25.560> that<00:03:26.070> doesn't<00:03:26.370> limit

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
is awesome because that doesn't limit

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.020 
is awesome because that doesn't limit
you<00:03:26.880> on<00:03:27.330> what<00:03:28.019> PSU<00:03:28.709> you<00:03:28.860> choose<00:03:29.280> and<00:03:29.610> when

you on what PSU you choose and when
you're<00:03:30.180> doing<00:03:30.540> these<00:03:30.660> small<00:03:30.870> builds

you're doing these small builds

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.620 
you're doing these small builds
sometimes<00:03:31.799> the<00:03:31.980> components<00:03:32.700> can<00:03:33.000> be<00:03:33.239> really

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
sometimes the components can be really

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.080 
sometimes the components can be really
limiting<00:03:34.049> in<00:03:34.200> terms<00:03:34.230> of<00:03:34.620> what<00:03:34.769> you<00:03:34.860> want<00:03:35.160> to<00:03:35.220> do

you're<00:03:38.820> building<00:03:39.000> but<00:03:39.299> that<00:03:39.450> they've<00:03:39.660> given

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
you're building but that they've given

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.520 
you're building but that they've given
you<00:03:40.320> space<00:03:40.500> for<00:03:40.890> a<00:03:40.920> full<00:03:41.390> PSU<00:03:42.390> is<00:03:42.450> really<00:03:43.260> great

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
you space for a full PSU is really great

also<00:03:43.830> you<00:03:44.070> have<00:03:44.489> a<00:03:44.880> dual<00:03:45.750> slot<00:03:46.250> GPU<00:03:47.250> so<00:03:47.489> you<00:03:47.549> can

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
also you have a dual slot GPU so you can

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.830 
also you have a dual slot GPU so you can
put<00:03:47.850> it<00:03:47.940> in<00:03:48.000> a<00:03:48.060> full<00:03:48.299> sized<00:03:48.570> GPU<00:03:49.200> as<00:03:49.440> well<00:03:50.370> and

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
put it in a full sized GPU as well and

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.360 
put it in a full sized GPU as well and
these<00:03:51.840> come<00:03:52.140> off<00:03:52.320> very<00:03:52.590> easily<00:03:53.040> with<00:03:53.340> some

it's<00:05:25.620> worth<00:05:25.830> mentioning<00:05:25.860> as<00:05:26.520> I<00:05:26.640> keep<00:05:26.820> saying

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:26.880 
it's worth mentioning as I keep saying

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.900 
it's worth mentioning as I keep saying
that<00:05:27.330> this<00:05:27.450> is<00:05:27.660> a<00:05:27.690> full-size<00:05:28.650> GPU<00:05:29.160> case<00:05:29.400> so

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:29.910 
that this is a full-size GPU case so

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:31.610 
that this is a full-size GPU case so
that<00:05:29.940> means<00:05:30.210> you<00:05:30.330> can<00:05:30.450> have<00:05:30.510> a<00:05:30.570> maximum<00:05:30.840> GPU

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:31.620 
that means you can have a maximum GPU
