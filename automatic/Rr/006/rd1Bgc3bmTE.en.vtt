of<00:00:48.570> other<00:00:48.690> variations<00:00:49.650> but<00:00:50.460> I'm<00:00:50.790> going<00:00:50.910> to

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
of other variations but I'm going to

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.960 
of other variations but I'm going to
show<00:00:51.090> you<00:00:51.180> now<00:00:51.360> is<00:00:51.630> the<00:00:52.170> end<00:00:53.100> of<00:00:53.310> the<00:00:53.430> verse<00:00:53.640> do

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:10.050 

and<00:01:05.200> then<00:01:05.410> back<00:01:05.620> into<00:01:05.800> the

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.180 

so<00:01:11.060> that<00:01:11.900> little<00:01:12.200> fiddly<00:01:12.500> bit<00:01:12.770> which<00:01:12.920> is<00:01:13.070> the

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:13.190 
so that little fiddly bit which is the

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.420 
so that little fiddly bit which is the
link<00:01:13.400> between<00:01:13.610> the<00:01:13.850> two<00:01:14.380> verses<00:01:15.380> goes<00:01:16.190> like

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
link between the two verses goes like

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:24.550 
link between the two verses goes like
this

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:31.320 

okay<00:01:25.190> so<00:01:25.790> as<00:01:26.360> it<00:01:26.540> comes<00:01:26.720> out<00:01:26.869> with<00:01:27.020> the<00:01:27.580> sorry

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.080 

he<00:01:31.930> hits<00:01:32.110> the<00:01:32.230> C<00:01:32.470> again<00:01:32.770> this<00:01:33.010> is<00:01:33.520> just<00:01:33.610> C<00:01:33.820> shape

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
he hits the C again this is just C shape

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:35.870 
he hits the C again this is just C shape
as<00:01:34.270> I<00:01:34.330> showed<00:01:34.540> you<00:01:34.690> earlier<00:01:34.720> so<00:01:35.170> you<00:01:35.200> play<00:01:35.440> five

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
as I showed you earlier so you play five

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.690 
as I showed you earlier so you play five
this<00:01:36.880> time<00:01:37.150> two<00:01:37.390> and<00:01:37.510> three<00:01:37.660> together<00:01:37.840> and

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
this time two and three together and

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:48.219 
this time two and three together and
then<00:01:40.440> two<00:01:41.440> then<00:01:41.650> three

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:50.170 

then<00:01:48.799> it<00:01:48.920> repeats<00:01:49.100> this<00:01:49.460> little<00:01:49.700> fiddly<00:01:49.939> bit

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
then it repeats this little fiddly bit

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.630 
then it repeats this little fiddly bit
twice<00:01:50.509> and<00:01:50.930> the<00:01:51.259> filigree<00:01:51.530> bit<00:01:52.189> goes<00:01:52.399> like

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
twice and the filigree bit goes like

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.390 
twice and the filigree bit goes like
this

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:57.400 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.930 

okay<00:01:58.400> so<00:01:58.460> it's<00:01:59.680> adding<00:02:00.680> the<00:02:01.370> third<00:02:01.670> fret<00:02:01.910> on

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:01.940 
okay so it's adding the third fret on

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.730 
okay so it's adding the third fret on
the<00:02:02.060> first<00:02:02.330> string<00:02:02.540> so<00:02:03.260> you've<00:02:03.380> got<00:02:03.470> the<00:02:03.530> C

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
the first string so you've got the C

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.020 
the first string so you've got the C
with<00:02:04.070> a<00:02:04.100> third<00:02:04.370> fret<00:02:04.550> on<00:02:04.580> the<00:02:04.640> first<00:02:04.880> string

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
with a third fret on the first string

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:13.050

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.250 
made back in suppose to so the next bit
is<00:03:31.560> a<00:03:32.130> little<00:03:33.000> variation<00:03:33.360> that'll<00:03:33.900> teach<00:03:34.110> you

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
is a little variation that'll teach you

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.630 
is a little variation that'll teach you
now<00:03:34.440> is

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.020 

because<00:03:39.150> that<00:03:39.360> rundown<00:03:40.430> for<00:03:41.430> the<00:03:41.490> first<00:03:41.730> time

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
because that rundown for the first time

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.550 
because that rundown for the first time
in<00:03:42.150> the<00:03:42.240> verse<00:03:42.420> the<00:03:42.750> second<00:03:43.110> time<00:03:43.230> that<00:03:43.380> verse

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
in the verse the second time that verse

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.670 
in the verse the second time that verse
sometimes<00:03:44.040> it<00:03:44.250> changes<00:03:44.280> this<00:03:45.260> so<00:03:46.260> sometimes

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
sometimes it changes this so sometimes

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.100 
sometimes it changes this so sometimes
he<00:03:46.770> does<00:03:46.920> this

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:51.110 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:57.900 

instead<00:03:52.110> of<00:03:52.200> doing<00:03:52.440> the<00:03:53.959> he<00:03:54.959> does

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:57.910 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.660 

you<00:03:58.910> got<00:03:59.060> that<00:03:59.180> difference<00:03:59.690> oh<00:04:00.340> so<00:04:01.340> from<00:04:01.520> this

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:01.670 
you got that difference oh so from this

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:02.200 
you got that difference oh so from this

one<00:04:41.340> slight<00:04:41.640> variation<00:04:42.180> night<00:04:42.360> does<00:04:42.590> thought

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
one slight variation night does thought

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.190 
one slight variation night does thought
I'd<00:04:43.680> put<00:04:43.860> that<00:04:43.890> in<00:04:44.100> there<00:04:44.870> it's<00:04:45.870> all<00:04:45.960> in<00:04:46.110> the

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:46.200 
I'd put that in there it's all in the

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:47.960 
I'd put that in there it's all in the
tubs<00:04:46.440> if<00:04:46.620> you<00:04:46.710> want<00:04:46.860> to<00:04:46.950> have<00:04:47.550> a<00:04:47.610> look<00:04:47.730> on<00:04:47.820> the

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:47.970 
tubs if you want to have a look on the

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:50.840 
tubs if you want to have a look on the
tubs<00:04:48.180> anyway<00:04:48.570> I<00:04:49.380> think<00:04:49.860> on<00:04:50.220> the<00:04:50.310> first<00:04:50.490> verse

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:50.850 
tubs anyway I think on the first verse

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:53.030 
tubs anyway I think on the first verse
he<00:04:51.450> plays<00:04:51.690> the<00:04:51.870> first<00:04:52.140> line<00:04:52.440> to<00:04:52.770> Mars

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:53.040 
he plays the first line to Mars

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:58.940 
he plays the first line to Mars
sleepless<00:04:55.610> Rachel<00:04:56.610> wait<00:04:57.390> the<00:04:58.020> second<00:04:58.410> line<00:04:58.560> in

00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:58.950 
sleepless Rachel wait the second line in

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:05.110 
sleepless Rachel wait the second line in
that<00:04:59.610> dream

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:05.120 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.570 

so<00:05:05.389> there's<00:05:05.690> that<00:05:05.889> variation<00:05:06.889> on<00:05:07.070> the<00:05:07.190> second

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:07.580 
so there's that variation on the second

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.000 
so there's that variation on the second
line<00:05:07.699> of<00:05:08.000> the<00:05:08.449> first<00:05:08.660> verse<00:05:08.960> the<00:05:09.260> second<00:05:09.889> verse

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.010 
line of the first verse the second verse

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:11.650 
line of the first verse the second verse
is<00:05:10.040> different<00:05:10.580> I<00:05:10.669> think<00:05:10.699> he<00:05:11.000> plays<00:05:11.210> it<00:05:11.389> stand

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:11.660 
is different I think he plays it stand

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:13.570 
is different I think he plays it stand
the<00:05:11.900> standard<00:05:12.260> way<00:05:12.440> boat<00:05:12.889> sounds<00:05:13.310> but<00:05:13.490> you

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:13.580 
the standard way boat sounds but you

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:14.980 
the standard way boat sounds but you
best<00:05:13.790> often<00:05:14.120> listen<00:05:14.389> to<00:05:14.419> it<00:05:14.540> we'll<00:05:14.630> all<00:05:14.780> just

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:14.990 
best often listen to it we'll all just

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:16.300 
best often listen to it we'll all just
play<00:05:15.169> it<00:05:15.229> whichever<00:05:15.470> way<00:05:15.710> you<00:05:15.770> like<00:05:16.070> if<00:05:16.220> you

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.310 
play it whichever way you like if you

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:18.280 
play it whichever way you like if you
don't<00:05:16.639> like<00:05:16.940> the<00:05:17.120> second<00:05:17.419> way<00:05:17.570> or<00:05:18.199> the

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:18.290 
don't like the second way or the

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:21.100 
don't like the second way or the
variation<00:05:18.760> play<00:05:19.760> it<00:05:19.850> like<00:05:20.000> that

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.110 
variation play it like that

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:26.560 
variation play it like that
so<00:05:21.770> that<00:05:22.370> was<00:05:22.490> one<00:05:22.669> variation<00:05:23.830> also<00:05:25.419> at<00:05:26.419> the

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:26.570 
so that was one variation also at the

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:42.920 
so that was one variation also at the
very<00:05:26.900> end<00:05:27.470> of<00:05:27.860> the<00:05:28.449> second<00:05:29.449> and<00:05:29.660> third<00:05:29.690> verse

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:42.930 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:45.020 

there<00:05:43.320> are<00:05:43.500> some<00:05:43.740> little<00:05:44.009> variation<00:05:44.699> as<00:05:44.820> well

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:45.030 
there are some little variation as well

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:46.510 
there are some little variation as well
rather<00:05:45.300> than<00:05:45.419> doing

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:46.520 
rather than doing
