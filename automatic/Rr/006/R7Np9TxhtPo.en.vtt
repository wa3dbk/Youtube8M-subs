00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.820
 how about movie friends gamers and 

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:05.339
 welcome to another chapter of the ual 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.770
 tro that castlevania lord 82 episode 5 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.690
 script 6 so is this we did a great 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:14.799
 effort but we also live 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:16.390
 on 6 today we go up 5 and a little 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:19.029
 late but we upload it that is what 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.860
 matter we hope you enjoy it comes 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:23.140
 a pretty good fight that's something 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:25.090
 that I like I say the same 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:28.090
 this I think could go into the top 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:30.939
 4 top 5 of the fights is worth it and 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:33.340
 Well let's give this the video as 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:35.920
 you can see it 's slightly short the 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.420
 challenge is also not so dog so 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.710
 they are simply when the enemies do not 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.300
 talk about your blades we have to 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.739
 come back and we can no longer 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.300
 hit him in any way because 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:46.030
 so 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.730
 let's say it would break the combo that we 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.730
 ask us to do it four times 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.730
 simultaneously 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:57.640
 let's stay here talk 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.770
 see you fill yourself up that fills you 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:04.829
 the open we have it high thinking more 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:04.829
 we can fill more so let's go to this 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:11.230
 we get several enemies advice 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:14.170
 as they already have the vials they use the 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:17.350
 also when they have magic and they 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:19.600
 they throw a vial they come out like 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.990
 a scan a force field a shield 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.850
 here is the movement that is already beginning 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.290
 that we bought in the previous episode 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.680
 so you can also start it 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.840
 to do 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.200
 you can see that as a means we think these 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.200
 types 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:37.820
 and it 's like the execution of the 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.820
 vampires let's go let's go 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.930
 let's go quickly let's go let's go 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:46.150
 here, move around here 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:47.980
 let's put them together and when they are 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:50.310
 bullshit let's get rid of all 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:52.320
 at the same time 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:56.380
 more roads that's good we need 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:58.780
 all that can fast fast 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:02.500
 this is the quick fast simple part 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:04.170
 fast let's go to others that come together and 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.420
 Yes now 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.910
 we arrive at the set point we will not have 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:13.900
 to repeat more than hereinafter 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:15.250
 If there is no collectable, it is not 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.840
 worry nothing more in the description of 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.790
 video we leave you by the description of 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.790
 challenge that if we do it we realize 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.050
 when a paladin remember that he does 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.320
 one or two videos was explaining 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.580
 about the class let's say the ita is of 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.980
 the vampires that are in the second 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.650
 level so here is one of them 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.780
 and count for the guys and start the 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:40.470
 true trial classes and let's go let's go 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:42.620
 who is your daddy 12 come on 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.140
 and three 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:48.450
 let's follow him around now and now 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:50.129
 yes we are going to attack you with this one 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.380
 that is the first and we have to accept 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:54.950
 to others more 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.950
 so 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:02.910
 uyuyuy s got brave thing 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.650
 and how do they see what I was explaining to them about 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.260
 combo if they break it then it happens 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.480
 this 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:12.430
 what do we do what we do good you go to 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:15.930
 throw it he accepted here he's going back 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.930
 again it is the first 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:23.989
 move, move, elusive, dodge 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:27.130
 uf to a single blow that we kill this 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:29.830
 I do not like anything 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:31.510
 ok then this is when it gets good 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:34.540
 when we are a hit the two good 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.890
 in fact it is not a blow but you 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.850
 they understand 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:41.610
 although we have to move with everything 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:43.630
 fast left or right there we go 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:46.280
 again 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:48.640
 there you go 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:51.010

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:57.030
 here we move here 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:59.680
 we go more or less in the good way 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.680
 I do not like vampire mode, move, move 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.599
