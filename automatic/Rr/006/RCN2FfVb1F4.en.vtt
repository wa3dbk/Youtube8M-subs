from scrap wood and this is the engine

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:34.660 
from scrap wood and this is the engine

two-stroke<00:00:37.100> works<00:00:38.100> great<00:00:38.520> I<00:00:39.110> painted<00:00:40.110> the

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
two-stroke works great I painted the

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.340 
two-stroke works great I painted the
muffler<00:00:41.280> too

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
muffler too

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:55.869 
muffler too
it<00:00:43.350> was<00:00:43.739> rusty<00:00:44.070> and<00:00:45.739> in<00:00:46.739> pretty<00:00:47.100> bad<00:00:47.250> shape<00:00:51.590> so

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:55.879 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:16.380 

let's<00:00:56.879> look<00:00:57.030> at<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.530> propeller

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.880 

I<00:01:16.890> just<00:01:17.890> carved<00:01:18.340> it<00:01:18.460> without<00:01:19.060> any<00:01:19.590> plans<00:01:20.590> or

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:20.890 
I just carved it without any plans or

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.920 
I just carved it without any plans or
anything<00:01:22.320> so<00:01:23.370> it's<00:01:24.370> not<00:01:24.520> perfect<00:01:25.000> by<00:01:25.900> any

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930 
anything so it's not perfect by any

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:32.580 
anything so it's not perfect by any
means<00:01:28.230> and<00:01:29.230> it's<00:01:29.380> a<00:01:29.500> really<00:01:30.220> soft<00:01:30.490> wood<00:01:30.820> so<00:01:31.590> it

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
means and it's a really soft wood so it

00:01:32.590 --> 00:02:57.480 
means and it's a really soft wood so it
cracks<00:01:32.950> easily<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:34.540> all

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:57.490 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:02.350 

so<00:02:58.490> that's<00:02:58.820> it<00:03:00.070> well<00:03:01.070> honey<00:03:01.430> fix<00:03:01.880> the<00:03:02.120> length

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
so that's it well honey fix the length

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:09.430 
so that's it well honey fix the length
of<00:03:02.690> the<00:03:04.780> DeMille<00:03:06.730> shaft<00:03:08.080> because<00:03:09.080> it<00:03:09.230> keeps

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
of the DeMille shaft because it keeps

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:16.360 
of the DeMille shaft because it keeps
getting<00:03:09.860> off<00:03:10.130> off<00:03:11.980> and<00:03:13.720> in<00:03:14.720> a<00:03:15.350> month<00:03:15.590> or<00:03:15.740> so<00:03:15.800> I'm

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
getting off off and in a month or so I'm

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:21.190

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
going to put these put this engine on a

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.800 
going to put these put this engine on a
