00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009

around<00:02:05.159> a<00:02:05.610> new<00:02:05.820> power<00:02:06.180> forward<00:02:06.750> I<00:02:06.930> decided<00:02:07.439> to

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
around a new power forward I decided to

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.369 
around a new power forward I decided to
trade<00:02:07.950> for<00:02:08.220> mr.<00:02:08.459> Adrian<00:02:08.640> Payne<00:02:09.270> in<00:02:09.569> exchange

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
second-round draft pick now the reason

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.309 
second-round draft pick now the reason
why<00:02:14.579> I<00:02:14.610> decided<00:02:14.970> to<00:02:15.120> pull<00:02:15.299> off<00:02:15.450> this<00:02:15.689> trade<00:02:16.019> is

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
why I decided to pull off this trade is

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.250 
why I decided to pull off this trade is
because<00:02:16.739> we<00:02:16.980> let<00:02:17.220> go<00:02:17.459> of<00:02:17.730> at<00:02:18.030> Davis<00:02:18.629> and<00:02:18.659> he<00:02:19.079> was

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
because we let go of at Davis and he was

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.589 
because we let go of at Davis and he was
a<00:02:19.470> crucial<00:02:19.829> part<00:02:20.459> in<00:02:20.670> our<00:02:20.819> bench<00:02:21.090> unit<00:02:21.510> out

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
a crucial part in our bench unit out

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:23.630 
a crucial part in our bench unit out
there<00:02:21.900> to<00:02:22.079> grab<00:02:22.230> those<00:02:22.560> rebounds<00:02:23.010> to<00:02:23.489> get

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
there to grab those rebounds to get

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.910 
there to grab those rebounds to get
those<00:02:23.849> defensive<00:02:24.510> stops<00:02:24.870> and<00:02:25.319> I<00:02:25.409> just<00:02:25.680> wanted

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
those defensive stops and I just wanted

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.369 
those defensive stops and I just wanted
to<00:02:26.040> have<00:02:26.159> another<00:02:26.610> big<00:02:27.030> body<00:02:27.299> who<00:02:27.870> would<00:02:28.079> be<00:02:28.290> in

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379 
to have another big body who would be in

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:30.380 
to have another big body who would be in
the<00:02:28.409> paint<00:02:28.769> and<00:02:29.040> who<00:02:29.189> wouldn't<00:02:29.640> be<00:02:29.790> afraid<00:02:29.909> of

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
the paint and who wouldn't be afraid of

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.479 
the paint and who wouldn't be afraid of
physical<00:02:30.629> contact<00:02:31.349> and<00:02:31.859> I<00:02:31.920> think<00:02:32.220> those<00:02:32.459> two

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
physical contact and I think those two

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:34.940 
physical contact and I think those two
criterias<00:02:33.420> they<00:02:33.870> don't<00:02:34.079> really<00:02:34.290> fit<00:02:34.620> Brian

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
criterias they don't really fit Brian

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.160 
criterias they don't really fit Brian
Kelley<00:02:35.280> all<00:02:35.549> too<00:02:35.790> well<00:02:36.060> he<00:02:36.540> likes<00:02:36.780> to<00:02:36.870> be<00:02:37.019> out

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
Kelley all too well he likes to be out

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.630 
Kelley all too well he likes to be out
there<00:02:37.439> on<00:02:37.530> the<00:02:37.650> perimeter<00:02:37.920> to<00:02:38.340> shoot<00:02:38.519> the

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
there on the perimeter to shoot the

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.819 
there on the perimeter to shoot the
three-point<00:02:39.180> shot<00:02:39.450> but<00:02:39.900> I<00:02:39.930> need<00:02:40.200> bodies<00:02:40.650> in

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:40.829 
three-point shot but I need bodies in

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:42.920 
three-point shot but I need bodies in
the<00:02:40.950> paint<00:02:41.250> you<00:02:41.489> know<00:02:41.819> to<00:02:42.120> get<00:02:42.269> those<00:02:42.510> rebounds

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
the paint you know to get those rebounds

difficult<00:03:22.799> layups<00:03:23.129> to<00:03:23.310> go<00:03:23.549> as<00:03:23.879> well<00:03:24.239> as<00:03:24.449> get<00:03:24.720> to

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
difficult layups to go as well as get to

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.420 
difficult layups to go as well as get to
the<00:03:24.959> free-throw<00:03:25.199> line<00:03:25.410> so<00:03:25.919> in<00:03:26.010> terms<00:03:26.250> of

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
the free-throw line so in terms of

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.640 
the free-throw line so in terms of
scoring<00:03:26.790> we're<00:03:27.299> going<00:03:27.540> to<00:03:27.659> be<00:03:27.780> fine<00:03:28.079> but<00:03:28.560> in

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
scoring we're going to be fine but in

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.220 
scoring we're going to be fine but in
terms<00:03:28.889> of<00:03:29.099> defense<00:03:29.549> we<00:03:30.060> just<00:03:30.299> have<00:03:30.449> to<00:03:30.629> see<00:03:30.810> how

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
terms of defense we just have to see how

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:32.990 
terms of defense we just have to see how
well<00:03:31.500> Steph<00:03:31.919> Curry<00:03:32.159> is<00:03:32.340> going<00:03:32.549> to<00:03:32.669> be<00:03:32.790> out<00:03:32.970> here

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
well Steph Curry is going to be out here

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.270 
well Steph Curry is going to be out here
and<00:03:33.569> how<00:03:33.780> well<00:03:34.049> he's<00:03:34.379> going<00:03:34.590> to<00:03:34.709> protect<00:03:34.919> the

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
and how well he's going to protect the

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.129 
and how well he's going to protect the
perimeter<00:03:35.489> and<00:03:36.030> I<00:03:36.239> mean<00:03:36.449> if<00:03:36.599> the<00:03:36.720> worst<00:03:36.900> case

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:37.139 
perimeter and I mean if the worst case

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:39.289 
perimeter and I mean if the worst case
scenario<00:03:37.590> happens<00:03:38.129> where<00:03:38.340> player<00:03:38.669> does<00:03:39.030> get

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:39.299 
scenario happens where player does get

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:41.509 
scenario happens where player does get
past<00:03:39.569> Steph<00:03:39.870> Curry<00:03:40.169> he<00:03:40.620> can<00:03:40.829> always<00:03:41.129> rely<00:03:41.489> on

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
past Steph Curry he can always rely on

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:44.270 
past Steph Curry he can always rely on
our<00:03:41.819> two<00:03:42.090> bigs<00:03:42.449> in<00:03:42.720> the<00:03:42.840> paint<00:03:43.109> mister<00:03:43.799> Bismack

can<00:03:58.560> you<00:03:58.650> imagine<00:03:58.919> this<00:03:59.430> happening<00:04:00.000> in<00:04:00.299> the

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:00.569 
can you imagine this happening in the

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:03.170 
can you imagine this happening in the
real<00:04:00.840> NBA<00:04:01.260> Steph<00:04:02.040> Curry<00:04:02.340> joining<00:04:02.909> the<00:04:03.030> Los

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
real NBA Steph Curry joining the Los

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.509 
real NBA Steph Curry joining the Los
Angeles<00:04:03.389> Lakers<00:04:03.900> he<00:04:04.620> would<00:04:04.889> break<00:04:05.159> the

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
Angeles Lakers he would break the

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:07.610 
Angeles Lakers he would break the
internet<00:04:06.239> that<00:04:06.540> would<00:04:06.690> be<00:04:06.840> for<00:04:07.109> sure

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
internet that would be for sure

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.770 
internet that would be for sure
and<00:04:07.799> I<00:04:07.889> think<00:04:08.190> he<00:04:08.519> would<00:04:08.669> be<00:04:08.819> a<00:04:08.849> teammate<00:04:09.329> that

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
and I think he would be a teammate that

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.289 
and I think he would be a teammate that
Kobe<00:04:10.260> Bryant<00:04:10.650> with<00:04:10.799> definitely<00:04:11.370> respect<00:04:12.120> out

hopefully<00:07:11.660> it's<00:07:11.780> going<00:07:11.930> to<00:07:12.080> change<00:07:12.260> in<00:07:12.470> the

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:12.560 
hopefully it's going to change in the

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.470 
hopefully it's going to change in the
next<00:07:12.680> few<00:07:12.860> games<00:07:13.190> but<00:07:13.550> like<00:07:13.730> I<00:07:13.880> said<00:07:14.150> if<00:07:14.330> it

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:14.480 
next few games but like I said if it

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:16.660 
next few games but like I said if it
doesn't<00:07:14.960> we're<00:07:15.500> most<00:07:15.710> likely<00:07:16.160> going<00:07:16.370> to<00:07:16.460> look

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:16.670 
doesn't we're most likely going to look

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:19.240

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:19.250
