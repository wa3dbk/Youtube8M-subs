00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
to me as a rogue like like what exactly

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.680 
to me as a rogue like like what exactly
does<00:00:46.410> that<00:00:46.469> mean<00:00:46.620> so<00:00:47.250> it's<00:00:47.489> it<00:00:47.850> has<00:00:48.300> a<00:00:48.329> lot<00:00:48.660> of

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
does that mean so it's it has a lot of

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.750 
does that mean so it's it has a lot of
it<00:00:49.170> takes<00:00:49.500> a<00:00:49.590> lot<00:00:49.739> of<00:00:49.770> things<00:00:50.039> from<00:00:50.219> roguelikes

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
it takes a lot of things from roguelikes

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.689 
it takes a lot of things from roguelikes
but<00:00:51.030> it's<00:00:51.149> not<00:00:51.360> a<00:00:51.600> roguelike<00:00:51.960> per<00:00:52.530> se<00:00:52.770> it<00:00:53.489> does

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
but it's not a roguelike per se it does

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.310 
but it's not a roguelike per se it does
have<00:00:53.910> some<00:00:54.149> things<00:00:54.360> that<00:00:54.449> are<00:00:54.539> permanent<00:00:55.079> that

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
have some things that are permanent that

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.619 
have some things that are permanent that
carry<00:00:55.590> over<00:00:55.800> between<00:00:56.160> different<00:00:56.640> games<00:00:56.820> but

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
carry over between different games but

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.540 
carry over between different games but
it<00:00:58.230> does<00:00:58.410> not<00:00:58.559> permit<00:00:58.800> out<00:00:58.980> it<00:00:59.190> does<00:00:59.370> have

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
it does not permit out it does have

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.279 
it does not permit out it does have
randomly<00:00:59.910> generated<00:01:00.420> world<00:01:00.600> so<00:01:00.870> it's<00:01:01.050> a<00:01:01.140> lot

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
randomly generated world so it's a lot

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.130 
randomly generated world so it's a lot
like<00:01:01.590> a<00:01:01.859> roguelike<00:01:02.390> and<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.629> best<00:01:03.809> way<00:01:03.899> we

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
like a roguelike and the best way we

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.149 
like a roguelike and the best way we
could<00:01:04.260> figure<00:01:04.439> out<00:01:04.559> to<00:01:04.680> say<00:01:04.830> that<00:01:05.010> was

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
could figure out to say that was

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.460 
could figure out to say that was
roguelike<00:01:05.519> like<00:01:05.960> well<00:01:06.960> you<00:01:07.080> were<00:01:07.170> showing<00:01:07.350> me

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
roguelike like well you were showing me

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.560 
roguelike like well you were showing me
the<00:01:07.650> game<00:01:07.799> it<00:01:08.340> seems<00:01:08.580> I<00:01:08.970> know<00:01:09.270> you<00:01:09.420> guys

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
the game it seems I know you guys

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.020 
the game it seems I know you guys
created<00:01:09.930> this<00:01:10.110> in<00:01:10.350> three<00:01:10.680> days<00:01:10.860> at<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.640> mo<00:01:11.760> jan

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.750 
created this in three days at the mo jan
so<00:01:12.659> it<00:01:13.110> seems<00:01:13.350> like<00:01:13.590> it's<00:01:13.950> very<00:01:14.189> simple<00:01:14.610> you

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
so it seems like it's very simple you

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.730 
so it seems like it's very simple you

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
special powers are actually a really

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:25.999 
special powers are actually a really
interesting<00:01:25.110> thing<00:01:25.409> about<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.680> game<00:01:25.799> so<00:01:25.950> we

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
interesting thing about the game so we

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.460 
interesting thing about the game so we
wanted<00:01:26.250> to<00:01:26.369> design<00:01:26.729> special<00:01:27.330> powers<00:01:27.630> that<00:01:27.900> do

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
wanted to design special powers that do

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.679 
wanted to design special powers that do
not<00:01:28.619> use<00:01:28.920> mana<00:01:29.280> or<00:01:29.490> cool<00:01:29.939> down<00:01:29.970> or<00:01:30.420> any<00:01:30.540> of

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
not use mana or cool down or any of

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.149 
not use mana or cool down or any of
those<00:01:30.840> traditional<00:01:31.470> system<00:01:31.829> they<00:01:31.950> use<00:01:31.979> for

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
those traditional system they use for

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.010 
those traditional system they use for
special<00:01:32.729> powers<00:01:32.970> we<00:01:33.090> wanted<00:01:33.299> to<00:01:33.360> create

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
special powers we wanted to create

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.719 
special powers we wanted to create
something<00:01:34.170> that<00:01:34.619> you<00:01:34.920> could<00:01:35.070> use<00:01:35.280> infinitely

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
something that you could use infinitely

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.999 
something that you could use infinitely
but<00:01:36.000> that<00:01:36.150> use<00:01:36.329> other<00:01:36.600> resources<00:01:37.110> so<00:01:37.439> for

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
but that use other resources so for

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.350 
but that use other resources so for
example<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.400> crystal<00:01:38.759> character<00:01:39.060> could<00:01:39.240> turn

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
example the crystal character could turn

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.670 
example the crystal character could turn
you<00:01:39.450> through<00:01:39.600> crystal<00:01:40.020> but<00:01:40.200> then<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.470> chris

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
you through crystal but then the chris

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.130 
you through crystal but then the chris
conte<00:01:40.920> move<00:01:41.360> while<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.479> melting<00:01:42.780> character

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
conte move while the melting character

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.920 
conte move while the melting character
can<00:01:43.409> explode<00:01:43.920> dead<00:01:44.670> enemies<00:01:45.060> then<00:01:45.720> when<00:01:45.869> you

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
can explode dead enemies then when you

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.389 
can explode dead enemies then when you
blow<00:01:46.079> them<00:01:46.259> up<00:01:46.350> they're<00:01:46.560> no<00:01:46.680> longer<00:01:46.829> there<00:01:47.159> so

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399
