00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.040
 hello in this video we're going to decorate some 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.200
 cupcakes 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.719
 that we have prepared previously with 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.150
 cream cheese for it we are going to 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.250
 need a flat spatula like this 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.109
 which is wilton's worth from the small 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.380
 let's get some cream cheese 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.539
 and we're going to spread it over the cupcake and 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.890
 What we can not do is to give you that 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.050
 round what we are going to do is 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.550
 inside out is worth inside towards 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.840
 outside inside out and if we 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.539
 lack we believe that we are putting him 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.730
 neither without spending a lot of money, let's go 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.920
 calculating on the fly the only thing that 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.750
 we want is that the surface of the edge 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.310
 We are going to be regular is worth as much 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.940
 regular possible 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:44.040
 and here you take it to the end because then 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.900
 what we are going to do is take a manga 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.730
 pastry with a nice mouthpiece like 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:52.200
 the 1m wilton which is the simplest 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.790
 it's okay or leave it like this because 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.920
 good surface for the most chronic 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.690
 possible but also not congregate is the 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.490
 existence in giving it to leave this for 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.500
 here and now what I have is the manga 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:05.800
 prepared pastry what I have put is 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:08.170
 the mouthpiece 1m as you can see the pot 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.670
 clean a little you can make flowers 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.040
 but you can also do it from another 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:14.620
 way ok is what we are going to do is 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:18.030
 with a single hand let's do as well as 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:18.030
 a knot is worth yes no 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.310
 a squeeze cited let's say it like that and what 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:24.650
 what we are going to do is decorate from 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.900
 inside out with one hand 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:29.420
 ok and I'll put the point in the middle 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.610
 and I'm going to spin and spin spin and spin 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.770
 spin and spin spin and spin spin and 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.140
 when I finish it and is shot and 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.610
 made flower see how simple is good 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.500
 because this is simply decoration 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.380
 with the cream and now what I'm going to do 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.060
 all for example with pearls 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.500
 silver I have around here because I'm going 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.750
 to decorate simply what puts a 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.660
 little pearl if you want to give it a 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.310
 A little more color is worth it, you can help me 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.929
 put another type of decoration for 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.820
 example some fondant flowers or something 

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:57.800
 I'm throwing the 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.420
 pearls everywhere good 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.880
 Well basically that's how it's been 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.039
 it's very simple ok let's make another 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.929
 to see it come very simple give me a 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:07.759
 this one had her prepared from before 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:09.140
 with a little cream I will do the 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:10.380
 I'm going to extend it to the sides 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.800
 OK 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.760
 I hope you 're seeing everything right 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.110
 making out you see so that 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.110
 the edges remain always well 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.670
 facts but always well done is more 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.810
 is a little bit higher than the others 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.310
 ok but do not pass 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.930
 I will finish like this 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.720
 Y 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:33.540
 started again with a pastry bag 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:35.519
 and I put center and turn spin turn spin 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.890
 twist twist twist twist rotation when dialing 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:39.750
 the surface shot ban has stayed with the 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.239
 pull a little weird but good either 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.700
 it happens nothing else I stay with a little flower 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:46.430
 if you want 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.840
 the rule and in time keel with the help of 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:51.390
 the mouthpiece 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:55.530
 and now for example because I'm going to this 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:57.239
 put some colored balls that I have 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.640
 over here to see if I do not get too much 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:02.209
 some colored balls so that it stays 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.209
 so more cute 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:08.140
 and a little heart for example not teams 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.819
 little hearts that I have pink and 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:13.780
 white what to put a rose because the 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:16.299
 white is not going to look like this and so we 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.799
 has remained valid are very simple and as 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:19.780
 you see the mouthpiece one of half wilton is 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:22.420
 quite versatile allows us to make a 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.069
 or some very nice spirals are very 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.760
 well very arranged and all the cupcake 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:29.230
 and well it does not seem that it is 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.879
 a network velvet the surprise us the 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:34.200
 we find when we eat lasa vale 

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:34.200
 come then so far
