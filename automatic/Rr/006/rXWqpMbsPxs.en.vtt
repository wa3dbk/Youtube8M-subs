00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
perfect okay so what you just saw was a

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.699 
perfect okay so what you just saw was a
two<00:03:29.260> light<00:03:29.560> setup<00:03:30.040> one<00:03:30.700> where<00:03:31.420> we<00:03:31.690> had<00:03:31.959> the

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:32.709 
two light setup one where we had the

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:37.170 
two light setup one where we had the
grille<00:03:33.370> on<00:03:33.730> the<00:03:34.530> subject<00:03:35.530> which<00:03:36.250> excludes

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
grille on the subject which excludes

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.240 
grille on the subject which excludes
light<00:03:37.989> going<00:03:38.440> anywhere<00:03:38.769> else<00:03:38.920> in<00:03:39.040> the<00:03:39.130> room

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
light going anywhere else in the room

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:40.830 
light going anywhere else in the room
and<00:03:39.489> that's<00:03:39.580> very<00:03:39.910> very<00:03:40.090> important<00:03:40.690> because

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
and that's very very important because

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.289 
and that's very very important because
if<00:03:41.470> we<00:03:41.530> had<00:03:41.860> it<00:03:42.010> spill<00:03:42.280> onto<00:03:42.459> the<00:03:42.700> walls<00:03:42.910> we

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:43.299 
if we had it spill onto the walls we

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:45.750 
if we had it spill onto the walls we
wouldn't<00:03:43.630> have<00:03:43.780> that<00:03:43.930> very<00:03:44.230> powerful<00:03:45.010> color

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
wouldn't have that very powerful color

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.750 
wouldn't have that very powerful color
effect<00:03:46.120> in<00:03:46.239> the<00:03:46.330> background<00:03:47.010> using<00:03:48.010> a<00:03:48.160> light

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
effect in the background using a light

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.820
