one here and got unbreaking free feather
falling<00:02:51.110> for<00:02:53.860> respiration<00:02:54.860> 2<00:02:55.400> and<00:02:56.170> you<00:02:57.170> get

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.320 
falling for respiration 2 and you get

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:01.350 
falling for respiration 2 and you get
the<00:02:57.470> point<00:02:57.709> and<00:02:58.930> each<00:02:59.930> of<00:03:00.140> these<00:03:00.320> books<00:03:00.680> will

and then here you will see 3 slots you
can<00:03:37.730> put<00:03:38.150> items<00:03:38.570> in<00:03:39.049> and<00:03:39.380> let's<00:03:39.650> just<00:03:39.890> try<00:03:40.190> to

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
can put items in and let's just try to

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.870 
can put items in and let's just try to
put<00:03:40.549> a<00:03:40.580> diamond<00:03:41.450> pickaxe<00:03:41.959> here<00:03:42.440> and<00:03:42.670> find<00:03:43.670> an

put a diamond pickaxe here and find an
enchanting<00:03:44.810> that<00:03:45.130> fits<00:03:46.130> to<00:03:46.430> the<00:03:46.580> iron<00:03:46.820> pickaxe

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:47.269 
enchanting that fits to the iron pickaxe

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:50.610 
enchanting that fits to the iron pickaxe
on<00:03:48.080> an<00:03:48.200> iron<00:03:48.470> diamond<00:03:48.920> pickaxe

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
on an iron diamond pickaxe

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.309 
on an iron diamond pickaxe
and<00:03:50.800> then<00:03:51.340> you<00:03:51.459> can<00:03:51.640> see<00:03:51.849> here<00:03:52.330> it<00:03:52.510> would<00:03:52.870> cry

00:03:53.309 --> 00:03:53.319 
and then you can see here it would cry

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:58.020 
and then you can see here it would cry
us<00:03:53.530> that<00:03:53.800> you<00:03:53.980> have<00:03:54.629> level<00:03:55.629> 5<00:03:55.959> so<00:03:56.879> putting<00:03:57.879> the

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
us that you have level 5 so putting the

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.210 
us that you have level 5 so putting the
enchantments<00:03:58.810> from<00:03:59.230> the<00:03:59.379> books<00:03:59.620> on<00:03:59.890> to<00:04:00.069> the

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
enchantments from the books on to the

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.869 
enchantments from the books on to the
tools<00:04:00.569> you<00:04:01.569> need<00:04:01.599> levels<00:04:02.290> 2<00:04:02.590> so<00:04:03.069> if<00:04:03.370> we<00:04:03.640> take

00:04:03.869 --> 00:04:03.879 
tools you need levels 2 so if we take

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:07.530 
tools you need levels 2 so if we take
this<00:04:04.120> we<00:04:04.420> get<00:04:04.629> an<00:04:04.780> unbreaking<00:04:05.319> 3<00:04:05.470> peak<00:04:05.890> X<00:04:06.540> we

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
this we get an unbreaking 3 peak X we

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.500 
this we get an unbreaking 3 peak X we
can<00:04:07.660> put<00:04:07.840> that<00:04:08.019> into<00:04:08.549> and<00:04:09.549> see<00:04:09.760> if<00:04:09.910> we<00:04:10.060> can<00:04:10.209> find

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
can put that into and see if we can find

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:11.369 
can put that into and see if we can find
another<00:04:10.870> one

00:04:11.369 --> 00:04:11.379 
another one

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:15.300 
another one
efficiently<00:04:12.160> 4<00:04:12.549> and<00:04:12.970> that<00:04:13.780> will<00:04:14.019> require<00:04:14.830> 10

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
efficiently 4 and that will require 10

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.199 
efficiently 4 and that will require 10
levels<00:04:15.670> because<00:04:16.060> now<00:04:16.419> you<00:04:16.900> will<00:04:17.049> get<00:04:17.350> 2

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
levels because now you will get 2

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:21.629 
levels because now you will get 2
enchantments<00:04:19.209> on<00:04:19.449> it<00:04:19.690> and<00:04:19.870> that<00:04:20.049> will<00:04:20.639> cost

00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:21.639 
enchantments on it and that will cost

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:26.810 
enchantments on it and that will cost
more<00:04:22.060> the<00:04:22.660> more<00:04:22.870> enchantments<00:04:23.500> you<00:04:23.650> get<00:04:23.830> on<00:04:23.979> it

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.370 

another<00:04:27.820> thing<00:04:28.120> you<00:04:28.240> can<00:04:28.389> do<00:04:28.600> in<00:04:28.780> the<00:04:28.960> animal

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:29.380 
another thing you can do in the animal

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:32.090 
another thing you can do in the animal
is<00:04:29.590> to<00:04:29.860> take<00:04:30.130> two<00:04:30.490> of<00:04:30.760> the<00:04:30.880> same<00:04:31.120> types<00:04:31.870> of

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:32.100 
is to take two of the same types of

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.210 
is to take two of the same types of
enchantments<00:04:33.100> say<00:04:33.610> to<00:04:33.669> sharpness<00:04:34.600> 3<00:04:34.930> and<00:04:35.260> then

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
enchantments say to sharpness 3 and then

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.140 
enchantments say to sharpness 3 and then
you<00:04:36.370> will<00:04:36.550> get<00:04:36.669> the<00:04:38.070> number<00:04:39.070> upgraded<00:04:39.880> so<00:04:40.090> you

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
you will get the number upgraded so you

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.740 
you will get the number upgraded so you
will<00:04:40.419> get<00:04:40.570> a<00:04:40.600> sharp<00:04:40.960> as<00:04:41.139> 4<00:04:41.550> so<00:04:42.550> that<00:04:43.150> is<00:04:43.330> also

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:43.750 
will get a sharp as 4 so that is also

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.260 
will get a sharp as 4 so that is also
the<00:04:43.930> only<00:04:44.229> way<00:04:44.380> you<00:04:44.440> can<00:04:44.770> get<00:04:45.039> sharpness<00:04:45.610> 5<00:04:45.910> and

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
the only way you can get sharpness 5 and

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.080 
the only way you can get sharpness 5 and
unbreak<00:04:46.690> not<00:04:47.380> on<00:04:47.530> efficiency<00:04:48.250> found<00:04:48.639> a<00:04:48.789> little

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.090 
unbreak not on efficiency found a little

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:52.790 
unbreak not on efficiency found a little
bug<00:04:49.330> that<00:04:49.600> is<00:04:49.660> in<00:04:50.139> the<00:04:50.260> game<00:04:50.440> right<00:04:50.710> now<00:04:50.740> and<00:04:51.479> I

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 
bug that is in the game right now and I

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.590 
bug that is in the game right now and I
guess<00:04:53.800> it<00:04:53.979> will<00:04:54.160> be<00:04:54.340> fixed<00:04:54.669> is<00:04:55.030> that<00:04:55.240> you<00:04:55.389> can

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:55.600 
guess it will be fixed is that you can

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.409 
guess it will be fixed is that you can
put<00:04:55.870> any<00:04:56.139> items<00:04:56.650> in<00:04:56.889> and<00:04:57.280> give<00:04:57.970> it<00:04:58.000> in<00:04:58.210> an

00:04:58.409 --> 00:04:58.419 
put any items in and give it in an

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:02.250 
put any items in and give it in an
enchantment<00:04:59.320> so<00:05:00.419> if<00:05:01.419> you<00:05:01.570> want<00:05:01.780> to<00:05:01.930> do<00:05:02.080> that

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:02.260 
enchantment so if you want to do that
