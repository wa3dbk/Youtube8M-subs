00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
you how you can use it with this case if

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.899 
you how you can use it with this case if
I<00:01:39.600> flip<00:01:39.900> this<00:01:40.110> around<00:01:40.170> just<00:01:41.100> like<00:01:41.220> this<00:01:41.520> I'm

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
I flip this around just like this I'm

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.539 
I flip this around just like this I'm
gonna<00:01:42.150> close<00:01:42.420> it<00:01:42.600> up<00:01:42.720> it<00:01:43.470> will<00:01:43.680> stay<00:01:43.979> closed<00:01:44.340> on

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
gonna close it up it will stay closed on

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.730 
gonna close it up it will stay closed on
its<00:01:44.700> own<00:01:44.909> with<00:01:45.119> that<00:01:45.270> latch<00:01:45.570> however<00:01:46.500> if

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
its own with that latch however if

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.800 
its own with that latch however if
you're<00:01:46.890> tossing<00:01:47.130> it<00:01:47.520> in<00:01:47.640> a<00:01:47.729> bag<00:01:48.000> if<00:01:48.390> you're

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
you're tossing it in a bag if you're

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.030 
you're tossing it in a bag if you're
doing<00:01:49.110> something<00:01:49.470> that<00:01:49.619> you're<00:01:49.860> maybe

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
doing something that you're maybe

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.310 
doing something that you're maybe
concerned<00:01:50.579> that<00:01:50.700> it's<00:01:50.850> gonna<00:01:50.909> pop<00:01:51.210> open<00:01:51.479> just

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
concerned that it's gonna pop open just

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.050 
concerned that it's gonna pop open just
loop<00:01:52.530> that<00:01:52.740> strap<00:01:53.159> around<00:01:53.340> like<00:01:53.670> you<00:01:53.759> see<00:01:53.939> me

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
loop that strap around like you see me

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.600 
loop that strap around like you see me
doing<00:01:54.270> here<00:01:54.390> and<00:01:54.960> that's<00:01:55.590> an<00:01:55.799> added<00:01:56.219> level<00:01:56.579> of

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
doing here and that's an added level of

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.749 
doing here and that's an added level of
security<00:01:57.479> for<00:01:57.689> keeping<00:01:58.110> this<00:01:58.259> closed<00:01:59.159> up<00:01:59.460> on

security for keeping this closed up on

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.209 
security for keeping this closed up on
you<00:02:00.090> personally<00:02:00.869> I<00:02:01.170> probably<00:02:01.590> not<00:02:01.770> use<00:02:02.009> it

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:34.049 
silver nod here with a little reflection

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:36.380 
silver nod here with a little reflection
to<00:02:34.290> it<00:02:34.439> along<00:02:35.220> this<00:02:35.459> side<00:02:35.519> you<00:02:35.939> can<00:02:35.970> see<00:02:36.120> what

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:38.129 
this is gonna look like we do have a

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:40.369 
this is gonna look like we do have a
stylus<00:02:38.730> holder<00:02:39.120> down<00:02:39.390> at<00:02:39.569> the<00:02:39.689> bottom<00:02:40.049> I<00:02:40.140> like

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:40.379 
stylus holder down at the bottom I like

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:42.110 
stylus holder down at the bottom I like
it<00:02:40.560> when<00:02:40.709> companies<00:02:41.189> do<00:02:41.400> this<00:02:41.609> because<00:02:41.790> it

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
it when companies do this because it

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.280 
it when companies do this because it
doesn't<00:02:42.480> get<00:02:42.569> in<00:02:42.720> the<00:02:42.780> way<00:02:42.840> of<00:02:43.170> your

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
doesn't get in the way of your

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.740

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
functional buttons right up here and

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.170 
functional buttons right up here and
then<00:02:46.440> as<00:02:46.620> we<00:02:46.739> take<00:02:46.950> a<00:02:46.980> look<00:02:47.220> up<00:02:47.430> along<00:02:47.760> the<00:02:48.000> top

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
then as we take a look up along the top

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.789 
then as we take a look up along the top
and<00:02:48.510> that's<00:02:48.569> what<00:02:48.870> its<00:02:48.989> gonna<00:02:49.079> look<00:02:49.200> like

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799 
and that's what its gonna look like

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:52.069 
and that's what its gonna look like
here<00:02:50.099> is<00:02:50.220> your<00:02:50.340> spine<00:02:50.790> and<00:02:51.150> then<00:02:51.810> down<00:02:52.049> below

use the automatic awake feature and it
will<00:03:13.409> also<00:03:13.620> put<00:03:14.069> it<00:03:14.189> to<00:03:14.310> sleep<00:03:14.609> when<00:03:14.849> you<00:03:14.939> close

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:17.509 
will also put it to sleep when you close
it<00:03:15.480> so<00:03:15.659> that's<00:03:15.870> a<00:03:16.049> nice<00:03:16.290> function<00:03:16.739> to<00:03:17.010> have<00:03:17.220> in

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
it so that's a nice function to have in

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:19.789 
it so that's a nice function to have in
this<00:03:17.730> case<00:03:18.000> if<00:03:18.329> you<00:03:18.720> fold<00:03:18.989> it<00:03:19.169> backwards<00:03:19.650> like

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:19.799 
this case if you fold it backwards like

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:21.949 
this case if you fold it backwards like
this<00:03:19.949> it's<00:03:20.819> not<00:03:21.000> gonna<00:03:21.090> put<00:03:21.299> your<00:03:21.480> device<00:03:21.599> to
