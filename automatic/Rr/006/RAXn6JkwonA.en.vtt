00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
for a manufacturer

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.080 
for a manufacturer
and<00:01:09.410> what<00:01:09.500> got<00:01:09.650> me<00:01:09.740> excited<00:01:09.830> about<00:01:10.310> it<00:01:10.670> wasn't

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
and what got me excited about it wasn't

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.210 
and what got me excited about it wasn't
so<00:01:11.150> much<00:01:11.240> the<00:01:11.300> music<00:01:11.570> at<00:01:11.900> that<00:01:11.930> time<00:01:12.290> it<00:01:13.100> was

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
so much the music at that time it was

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:14.650 
so much the music at that time it was
the<00:01:13.370> fact<00:01:13.550> that<00:01:13.700> it<00:01:13.850> was<00:01:13.940> driven<00:01:14.150> by<00:01:14.270> software

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:14.660 
the fact that it was driven by software

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.260 
the fact that it was driven by software
and<00:01:15.280> you<00:01:16.280> could<00:01:16.430> do<00:01:16.580> so<00:01:16.820> much<00:01:16.970> with<00:01:17.030> the

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
and you could do so much with the

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.590 
and you could do so much with the
firmware<00:01:17.600> and<00:01:17.930> I<00:01:18.050> was<00:01:18.170> a<00:01:18.229> Tweaker<00:01:19.270> it<00:01:20.270> was<00:01:20.390> more

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
firmware and I was a Tweaker it was more

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.780 
firmware and I was a Tweaker it was more
playing<00:01:21.020> with<00:01:21.229> the<00:01:21.380> toys<00:01:21.680> and<00:01:22.340> never<00:01:22.520> really

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
playing with the toys and never really

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.359

listening<00:01:23.060> to<00:01:23.120> the<00:01:23.270> music<00:01:23.830> it<00:01:24.830> wasn't<00:01:25.100> until<00:01:25.280> I

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 
listening to the music it wasn't until I

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:27.310 
listening to the music it wasn't until I
think<00:01:25.400> 2002<00:01:26.270> where<00:01:26.450> I<00:01:26.479> think<00:01:26.570> I<00:01:26.750> had<00:01:26.869> my<00:01:26.990> first

first time around I have to be honest I

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:54.880 
first time around I have to be honest I
was<00:02:51.860> really<00:02:51.890> reluctant<00:02:53.170> wasn't<00:02:54.170> really<00:02:54.650> into

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:20.990 
the fact that earlier in the year I had

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:22.719 
the fact that earlier in the year I had
the<00:05:21.080> opportunity<00:05:21.169> to<00:05:21.650> listen<00:05:21.740> to<00:05:21.889> the<00:05:21.950> XLS<00:05:22.400> and

00:05:22.719 --> 00:05:22.729 
the opportunity to listen to the XLS and

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:26.290 
the opportunity to listen to the XLS and
I<00:05:23.450> said<00:05:23.780> I<00:05:24.139> don't<00:05:24.950> know<00:05:25.190> and<00:05:25.520> I<00:05:25.640> heard<00:05:25.880> that<00:05:25.910> it

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:26.300 
I said I don't know and I heard that it

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:30.180 
I said I don't know and I heard that it
was<00:05:26.330> about<00:05:26.750> the<00:05:26.900> same<00:05:27.310> footprint<00:05:28.310> as<00:05:29.030> a<00:05:29.090> Sacha

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:30.190 
was about the same footprint as a Sacha

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:33.360 
was about the same footprint as a Sacha
I<00:05:30.220> had<00:05:30.760> the<00:05:30.910> DNA<00:05:31.480> of<00:05:31.630> an<00:05:31.750> Excel<00:05:32.110> F<00:05:32.290> I<00:05:32.590> thought<00:05:33.220> he

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:33.370 
I had the DNA of an Excel F I thought he

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:34.050 
I had the DNA of an Excel F I thought he
was<00:05:33.490> ridiculous

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:34.060 
was ridiculous

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:35.760 
was ridiculous
because<00:05:34.450> he'd<00:05:34.660> never<00:05:34.750> even<00:05:34.960> heard<00:05:35.350> then<00:05:35.560> we

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:35.770 
because he'd never even heard then we

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:37.530 
because he'd never even heard then we
could<00:05:35.950> you<00:05:36.130> know<00:05:36.160> tune<00:05:36.880> it<00:05:37.030> a<00:05:37.090> little<00:05:37.240> bit<00:05:37.360> more

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:37.540 
could you know tune it a little bit more

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:39.930 
could you know tune it a little bit more
