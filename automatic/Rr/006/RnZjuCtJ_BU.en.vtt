people have even been fired or quit

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.380 
people have even been fired or quit
their<00:02:37.800> job<00:02:38.040> because<00:02:38.220> they<00:02:38.520> have<00:02:38.700> this<00:02:38.940> this

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
their job because they have this this

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.479 
their job because they have this this
burden<00:02:39.840> so<00:02:39.989> i<00:02:40.020> think<00:02:40.140> the<00:02:40.530> the<00:02:40.560> you<00:02:41.370> know

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
burden so i think the the you know

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:45.020 
burden so i think the the you know
filling<00:02:42.450> the<00:02:42.480> plan<00:02:42.750> is<00:02:43.080> a<00:02:43.860> air<00:02:44.400> in<00:02:44.550> and<00:02:44.940> of

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
filling the plan is a air in and of

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.490 
filling the plan is a air in and of
itself<00:02:45.180> so<00:02:45.570> you<00:02:45.630> need<00:02:45.900> to<00:02:45.959> think<00:02:46.080> about<00:02:46.230> that

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
itself so you need to think about that

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.840 
itself so you need to think about that
in<00:02:46.590> the<00:02:46.620> future<00:02:46.769> okay<00:02:47.160> now<00:02:47.580> is<00:02:47.700> this<00:02:47.790> something

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
in the future okay now is this something

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.340 
in the future okay now is this something
that<00:02:48.120> young<00:02:48.450> people<00:02:48.600> should<00:02:48.810> think<00:02:49.260> about

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
that young people should think about

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:50.900 
that young people should think about
like<00:02:49.680> out<00:02:49.860> of<00:02:49.980> college<00:02:50.370> when<00:02:50.489> they<00:02:50.610> get<00:02:50.730> their

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
like out of college when they get their

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.940 
like out of college when they get their
