00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.150
 netflix exactly the company of 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.369
 streaming movies and online programs 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.050

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.780
 sp story of last year's sp 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.930
 she rose more than 100% to fifa the action 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.300
 started the year at about 50 55 dollars 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.450
 and it was highly valued that it was about 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.700
 102 dollars a huge success and 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.649
 not because it is a number that the 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.360
 analysts are aware is the number of 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.399
 new subscribers 10 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.260
 netflix started in the united states 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.840
 sending dvds by mail to the 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.059
 cnn subscribers watch a movie and 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.520
 they sent the dvd back by mail 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.260
 to be able to rent another movie but 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:08.580
 worked fine for a while but this 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:10.650
 worked well 2010 2011 and 2012 and now 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.750
 offers an online streaming service 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.479
 to which everyone knows well what this 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.240
 would mean that the phone your ipad your 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.700
 laptop computers have become portable 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.549
 netflix is ​​the operator of cinemas in 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.560
 1900 an on demand transmission system 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.509
 TV programs and movies that have 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.490
 To debut tomorrow is as if you 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.650
 I was in an airplane seat was 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.630
 everyone can watch movies and shows 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.150
 at lunch intervals within the 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.400
 work in relation to the actions was 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.759
 a success because netflix is now 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.680
 conquering other markets in the states 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:45.689
 It was to win an American market but 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.060
 now also in Europe and starting 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.100
 to operate in the area leave but in the second 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.640
 quarter of that year and modify 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:56.579
 Conquered something around pocket for 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:58.740
 42.7 208 million new subscribers in the 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:01.710
 last year in the same period 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.659
 they had 1.7 million subscribers or 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.400
 then there was a race all over the world 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.560
 to sign netflix will comply 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.869
 This is a personal component. 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.840
 buy the shares at the moment. 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:17.740
 if you want to shoot yourself in an action that 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:19.840
 worth $ 102 is a very expensive action 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:22.810
 was higher because the organ is that netflix 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.480
 I do not offer what it promises, it's what you are 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:28.780
 just one click to let them them 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.670
 offer youtube services 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.580
 also offers some of these services 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.920
 just like amazon beach voice tomorrow 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.230
 only the internet and its ability to 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.480
 offer streaming in a general way 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.320
 only the song was worried about the 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.360
 companies 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:45.880
 netflix in particular that is being 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.500
 negotiated this rate of profit heart 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.590
 because we could not see if we could 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:53.709
 digest these numbers into the profits of 500 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.330
 times of 200 months consult 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:56.380
 any analyst report from 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.360
 brokerage 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:03.000
 you will see that these are almost 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:05.980
 fictitious do not reflect the reality in 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.410
 2019 numbers may be even higher in 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:11.200
 cold may be 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:13.959
 negotiated 50 times more than the 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.840
 netflix story projected profits is a 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:19.120
 history of global success in more than 70 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.620
 millions of subscribers around the world is 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.780
 time we spent a lot of time 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.519
 watching your movies and I think 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.560
 they deserve this merit 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:29.310
 guarantees, however, in relation to buying 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:32.440
 shares at a price of $ 112 per share 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:34.180
 of the trade mark of another company does not 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.280
 has assets other than your 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.440
 server power capacity 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.709
 movies from a huge bank of 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:43.600
 data standards $ 50 billion 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:46.090
 I think I'd rather invest in a 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.769
 little more brick and cement and more 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.870
 You may want to get your hands on the 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:50.950
 money generated by the 70 million 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.900
 subscribers 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:54.700
 I think you're not wrong to think 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.799
 which is a great company campaign in 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.600
 steam blaster a rental company 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:01.090
 dvds and you 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.799
 ten years ago the campaign disappeared 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.780
 I'm not saying that netflix is ​​going 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:05.380
 disappear to not leave, I prefer 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.900
 wait 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:11.320
 if you can buy the shares at 40 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:13.299
 dollars well reaches 112 dollars is very 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:15.160
 money to watch a movie that 

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:16.870
 just started a fan I'm not 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.510
 prepared to pay the 20 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:21.250
 dollars to watch instead of 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:23.680
 Senate is going to stay here. 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:25.780
 I'm average and beat the host and 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.000
 partnership with Cas Cop TV is therefore 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:30.639
 remember if money can take care of you 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.810
 but can not take care of himself and that 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:33.810
 note that you want to see the edict
