I've got both hands on the wheel of a
total<00:01:53.250> control<00:01:53.610> because<00:01:54.570> they<00:01:54.720> could

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:55.800 
total control because they could

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.960 
total control because they could
shift<00:01:56.520> up<00:01:56.760> nowadays<00:01:57.170> when<00:01:58.170> you<00:01:58.290> don't<00:01:58.470> want

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.980 
shift up nowadays when you don't want
and<00:01:59.970> you've<00:02:00.720> got<00:02:01.110> just<00:02:01.680> that<00:02:01.920> extra<00:02:02.990> little

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
and you've got just that extra little

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.350 
and you've got just that extra little
bit<00:02:04.350> of<00:02:04.530> for<00:02:05.310> me<00:02:07.490> but<00:02:08.490> put<00:02:08.760> of<00:02:08.880> this<00:02:09.060> I<00:02:09.180> think

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
bit of for me but put of this I think

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.730 
bit of for me but put of this I think
you've<00:02:09.510> got<00:02:09.660> a<00:02:09.690> better<00:02:09.869> balance<00:02:10.260> on<00:02:10.650> the

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:10.740 
you've got a better balance on the

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.860 
you've got a better balance on the
steering<00:02:10.979> wheel<00:02:11.160> then<00:02:12.090> you<00:02:12.240> have<00:02:12.450> when<00:02:12.750> you're

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
steering wheel then you have when you're

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.810 
steering wheel then you have when you're
trying<00:02:13.110> to<00:02:13.230> take<00:02:13.410> one<00:02:13.650> hand<00:02:13.800> off<00:02:14.070> when<00:02:14.610> you're

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
trying to take one hand off when you're

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:25.590 
trying to take one hand off when you're
home<00:02:15.440> muscle<00:02:16.440> violence<00:02:17.300> this<00:02:18.410> is<00:02:19.410> changing

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.960 

and<00:02:26.380> then<00:02:26.530> the<00:02:26.620> second<00:02:26.950> thing<00:02:26.980> is<00:02:27.250> if<00:02:27.400> you<00:02:27.640> just

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
and then the second thing is if you just

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:34.170 
and then the second thing is if you just
say<00:02:28.540> you<00:02:28.570> don't<00:02:28.840> want<00:02:29.110> it<00:02:29.230> go<00:02:30.420> you<00:02:31.420> just<00:02:33.180> stick

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
say you don't want it go you just stick

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.420 
say you don't want it go you just stick
in<00:02:34.330> so<00:02:34.570> there<00:02:34.780> and<00:02:35.080> you<00:02:35.170> learn<00:02:35.710> along<00:02:36.010> you

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
in so there and you learn along you

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:37.950 
in so there and you learn along you
don't<00:02:36.610> have<00:02:36.730> to<00:02:36.910> dip<00:02:37.120> the<00:02:37.270> clutch<00:02:37.540> and<00:02:37.570> other

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:37.960 
don't have to dip the clutch and other

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.810 
don't have to dip the clutch and other
so<00:02:38.200> I<00:02:38.230> think<00:02:38.380> and<00:02:38.680> then<00:02:38.980> suddenly<00:02:39.220> you<00:02:39.490> decide

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
so I think and then suddenly you decide

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:49.320 
so I think and then suddenly you decide
you<00:02:39.940> do<00:02:42.240> don't<00:02:43.240> you<00:02:45.360> my<00:02:46.360> fault<00:02:47.970> you<00:02:48.970> say<00:02:49.270> you

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
you do don't you my fault you say you

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.740 
you do don't you my fault you say you
really<00:02:49.630> do<00:02:49.900> want<00:02:50.110> to<00:02:50.230> go<00:02:51.300> then<00:02:52.300> you<00:02:52.420> just<00:02:52.600> kick

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
really do want to go then you just kick

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.690 
really do want to go then you just kick
it<00:02:52.780> back<00:02:53.020> in<00:02:53.230> to<00:02:53.320> get<00:02:53.440> off<00:02:53.650> you<00:02:53.800> go<00:02:53.950> yeah

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.059 

I<00:02:58.860> just<00:02:59.860> think<00:03:00.040> it's<00:03:00.160> a<00:03:00.250> better<00:03:00.370> way<00:03:00.580> to<00:03:00.640> do<00:03:00.879> it

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
I just think it's a better way to do it

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:06.540 
I just think it's a better way to do it
oh<00:03:03.180> definitely<00:03:04.180> a<00:03:04.660> question<00:03:05.140> because<00:03:05.830> you<00:03:06.370> can

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 
oh definitely a question because you can

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:12.780 
oh definitely a question because you can

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:17.769 
the movement that the car is doing

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:20.699 
the movement that the car is doing
underneath<00:03:18.220> me<00:03:18.610> and<00:03:19.300> that<00:03:19.480> i'm<00:03:19.780> doing<00:03:20.319> an<00:03:20.470> oil

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
underneath me and that i'm doing an oil

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:23.550 
underneath me and that i'm doing an oil
stop<00:03:21.370> changing<00:03:21.849> donor<00:03:22.110> and<00:03:23.110> I<00:03:23.260> thought

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
stop changing donor and I thought

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.580 
stop changing donor and I thought
controlling<00:03:24.280> then<00:03:24.519> also<00:03:25.209> it<00:03:25.540> try<00:03:25.780> to<00:03:25.840> get<00:03:26.470> on

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
controlling then also it try to get on

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.479 
controlling then also it try to get on
human<00:03:26.950> tall<00:03:27.220> and<00:03:28.680> lunch<00:03:29.680> and<00:03:29.920> everything<00:03:30.010> else

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489 
human tall and lunch and everything else

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:34.589 
human tall and lunch and everything else
which<00:03:31.090> then<00:03:31.390> is<00:03:31.569> the<00:03:31.810> way<00:03:31.900> the<00:03:32.049> axles<00:03:32.530> work<00:03:33.599> I'm

00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:34.599 
which then is the way the axles work I'm

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:37.380 
which then is the way the axles work I'm
letting<00:03:35.019> it<00:03:35.110> good<00:03:36.120> electronically<00:03:37.120> which

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.390 
letting it good electronically which

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:38.640 
letting it good electronically which
means<00:03:37.599> it's<00:03:37.780> just<00:03:37.959> much<00:03:38.110> more<00:03:38.290> consistent

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
means it's just much more consistent

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.230 
means it's just much more consistent
better

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:40.240 
better

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:48.430 
better
it's<00:03:41.240> a<00:03:41.300> little<00:03:41.600> big<00:03:41.750> watches<00:03:46.930> 95<00:03:47.930> miles<00:03:48.290> per

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
it's a little big watches 95 miles per

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:54.070 
it's a little big watches 95 miles per
hour<00:03:49.270> straight<00:03:50.270> line<00:03:50.540> and<00:03:51.140> that<00:03:52.510> that<00:03:53.510> for<00:03:53.900> me

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.080 
hour straight line and that that for me

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:57.760 
hour straight line and that that for me
is<00:03:54.350> the<00:03:54.710> natural<00:03:55.660> physics<00:03:56.660> of<00:03:56.900> the<00:03:56.960> car<00:03:57.170> it's

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:57.770 
is the natural physics of the car it's

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:01.570 
is the natural physics of the car it's
the<00:03:58.010> weight<00:03:58.190> distribution<00:03:58.990> it's<00:03:59.990> the<00:04:00.890> center

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:01.580 
the weight distribution it's the center

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:04.600 
the weight distribution it's the center
of<00:04:01.610> gravity<00:04:02.500> you<00:04:03.500> know<00:04:03.620> obviously<00:04:03.770> with<00:04:04.190> a<00:04:04.220> v10

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:04.610 
of gravity you know obviously with a v10

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:07.120 
of gravity you know obviously with a v10
engine<00:04:04.910> over<00:04:05.090> a<00:04:05.120> v8<00:04:05.480> then<00:04:05.810> you<00:04:06.050> can<00:04:06.290> have<00:04:06.710> a

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:07.130 
engine over a v8 then you can have a

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:10.360 
engine over a v8 then you can have a
change<00:04:07.670> in<00:04:08.000> that<00:04:08.150> Cuba<00:04:08.540> more<00:04:08.810> weight<00:04:09.620> in<00:04:09.980> there

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 
change in that Cuba more weight in there

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:12.310 
change in that Cuba more weight in there
and<00:04:10.850> if<00:04:10.940> its<00:04:11.120> position<00:04:11.570> is<00:04:11.720> not<00:04:11.900> connected

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:12.320 
and if its position is not connected

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:13.840 
and if its position is not connected
then<00:04:12.440> if<00:04:12.740> you're<00:04:12.890> in<00:04:12.980> a<00:04:13.070> situation<00:04:13.280> like<00:04:13.640> that

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:13.850 
then if you're in a situation like that

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:15.640 
then if you're in a situation like that
where<00:04:13.880> you're<00:04:14.210> breaking<00:04:14.690> heavily<00:04:15.110> then<00:04:15.440> the

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
where you're breaking heavily then the

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:18.640 
where you're breaking heavily then the
rear<00:04:15.830> of<00:04:15.950> the<00:04:16.010> car<00:04:16.280> could<00:04:17.270> wander<00:04:17.540> around<00:04:17.840> but

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650 
rear of the car could wander around but

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:21.430 
rear of the car could wander around but
that's<00:04:18.860> straight<00:04:19.370> it's<00:04:19.880> doing<00:04:20.420> everything<00:04:20.810> in

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
that's straight it's doing everything in

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.370 
that's straight it's doing everything in
an<00:04:21.650> absolute<00:04:22.130> perfect<00:04:22.940> manner<00:04:23.420> so<00:04:24.170> you<00:04:24.230> can

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
an absolute perfect manner so you can

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:26.140 
an absolute perfect manner so you can
leave<00:04:24.620> that<00:04:24.650> to<00:04:24.950> the<00:04:24.980> rod<00:04:25.280> if<00:04:25.490> you<00:04:25.670> have<00:04:25.970> to

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
leave that to the rod if you have to

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.110 
leave that to the rod if you have to
make<00:04:26.330> a<00:04:26.360> heavy<00:04:27.230> braking<00:04:27.640> on<00:04:28.640> the<00:04:28.730> highway

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 
make a heavy braking on the highway

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.510 
make a heavy braking on the highway
truck<00:04:29.570> pulls<00:04:29.810> out<00:04:29.960> whatever<00:04:30.200> you<00:04:31.040> know<00:04:31.310> that

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520 
truck pulls out whatever you know that

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.580 
truck pulls out whatever you know that
the<00:04:31.610> car<00:04:31.790> stable<00:04:32.270> also<00:04:32.840> if<00:04:32.930> you<00:04:32.960> then<00:04:33.350> have<00:04:33.560> to

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590 
the car stable also if you then have to

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:35.500 
the car stable also if you then have to
do<00:04:33.830> it<00:04:33.920> in<00:04:34.010> the<00:04:34.100> corner<00:04:34.250> you<00:04:34.550> know<00:04:34.580> that<00:04:35.330> the

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:35.510 
do it in the corner you know that the

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:36.880 
do it in the corner you know that the
rear<00:04:35.750> wheels<00:04:35.990> are<00:04:36.200> following<00:04:36.500> the<00:04:36.680> front

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:36.890 
rear wheels are following the front

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:39.100 
rear wheels are following the front
wheels<00:04:37.100> and<00:04:37.850> you<00:04:38.000> don't<00:04:38.240> have<00:04:38.480> suddenly

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
wheels and you don't have suddenly

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:41.710 
wheels and you don't have suddenly
something<00:04:40.010> that<00:04:40.370> is<00:04:40.490> going<00:04:40.640> to<00:04:40.730> bite<00:04:40.910> you<00:04:41.090> you

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:41.720 
something that is going to bite you you

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.260 
something that is going to bite you you
can<00:04:42.110> predict<00:04:42.620> what<00:04:42.740> is<00:04:42.920> going<00:04:43.070> to<00:04:43.250> happen<00:04:43.580> and

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.270 
can predict what is going to happen and

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:45.580 
can predict what is going to happen and
I<00:04:44.390> think<00:04:44.570> that's<00:04:44.690> a<00:04:44.810> really<00:04:45.080> important

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590 
I think that's a really important

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:49.060 
I think that's a really important
thought<00:04:45.740> about<00:04:45.980> a<00:04:46.040> perfect<00:04:46.460> balance<00:04:46.610> yeah
