that my actual microphone wasn't on

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.050 
that my actual microphone wasn't on

better guys when have found another deep
or<00:02:41.400> a<00:02:41.430> guy<00:02:41.580> so<00:02:41.790> I<00:02:41.820> found<00:02:42.150> a<00:02:42.360> potential<00:02:42.930> deal

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
or a guy so I found a potential deal

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.070 
or a guy so I found a potential deal
right<00:02:43.890> here<00:02:43.920> the<00:02:44.370> guys<00:02:44.550> name<00:02:44.850> is<00:02:44.880> a<00:02:45.090> fair<00:02:45.570> a<00:02:45.600> and

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
right here the guys name is a fair a and

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.810 
right here the guys name is a fair a and
they<00:02:46.440> aren't<00:02:46.710> the<00:02:46.800> reason<00:02:46.980> why<00:02:47.190> I<00:02:47.310> think<00:02:47.730> it

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
they aren't the reason why I think it

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.340 
they aren't the reason why I think it
could<00:02:48.060> be<00:02:48.210> a<00:02:48.240> good<00:02:48.450> deal<00:02:48.660> because<00:02:48.870> there's<00:02:49.200> not

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
could be a good deal because there's not

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.590 
could be a good deal because there's not
really<00:02:49.590> many<00:02:50.310> of<00:02:50.520> them<00:02:50.640> on<00:02:50.730> the<00:02:50.820> market<00:02:51.270> so<00:02:51.450> if

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
really many of them on the market so if

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.200 
really many of them on the market so if
i<00:02:51.690> show<00:02:51.930> you<00:02:51.960> junior<00:02:52.500> ferrets<00:02:53.040> obviously<00:02:54.030> we

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:54.210 
i show you junior ferrets obviously we

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:59.030 
i show you junior ferrets obviously we
got<00:02:54.330> 14<00:02:54.660> 17<00:02:55.110> k<00:02:56.240> 13,500<00:02:57.240> coins<00:02:57.450> 12<00:02:58.050> k<00:02:58.320> and<00:02:58.590> then

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
got 14 17 k 13,500 coins 12 k and then

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.940 
got 14 17 k 13,500 coins 12 k and then
14<00:02:59.730> 17<00:03:00.270> k<00:03:00.480> so<00:03:00.840> there's<00:03:01.110> a<00:03:01.170> pretty<00:03:01.410> decent

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
14 17 k so there's a pretty decent

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.340 
14 17 k so there's a pretty decent
difference<00:03:02.460> between<00:03:02.820> that<00:03:03.060> one<00:03:03.330> and<00:03:03.510> these

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
difference between that one and these

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.860 
difference between that one and these
two<00:03:04.740> so<00:03:05.400> i<00:03:05.430> think<00:03:05.820> buying<00:03:06.360> both<00:03:06.660> of<00:03:06.810> these

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
two so i think buying both of these

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.200 
two so i think buying both of these
could<00:03:07.500> be<00:03:07.650> a<00:03:07.680> pretty<00:03:07.980> good<00:03:08.070> good<00:03:08.550> idea<00:03:08.850> so<00:03:09.060> i'm

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:09.210 
could be a pretty good good idea so i'm

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:11.060 
could be a pretty good good idea so i'm
going<00:03:09.330> to<00:03:09.480> pick<00:03:09.690> wonderful<00:03:10.230> thirty<00:03:10.440> thousand

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
going to pick wonderful thirty thousand

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:13.010 
going to pick wonderful thirty thousand
farms<00:03:11.220> coins<00:03:11.700> and<00:03:11.910> all<00:03:12.330> the<00:03:12.510> other<00:03:12.660> four

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 
farms coins and all the other four

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.170 
farms coins and all the other four
twelve<00:03:13.350> thousand<00:03:13.890> coins<00:03:14.010> and<00:03:14.520> i<00:03:14.760> think<00:03:15.000> that

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
twelve thousand coins and i think that

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.790 
twelve thousand coins and i think that
could<00:03:15.330> be<00:03:15.390> a<00:03:15.510> very<00:03:15.990> good<00:03:16.050> deal<00:03:16.350> so<00:03:16.620> I'm<00:03:16.710> gonna

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
could be a very good deal so I'm gonna

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.140
