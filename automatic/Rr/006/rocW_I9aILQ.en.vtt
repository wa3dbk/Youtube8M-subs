00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
the actual figure of the original yeah

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.570 
the actual figure of the original yeah
you<00:00:19.080> get<00:00:19.230> it<00:00:19.350> um<00:00:19.670> I<00:00:22.010> don't<00:00:23.010> know<00:00:23.189> how<00:00:23.340> I<00:00:23.369> feel

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
you get it um I don't know how I feel

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.419 
you get it um I don't know how I feel
about<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:24.650> propellers<00:00:25.880> they're<00:00:26.880> kind<00:00:27.029> of<00:00:27.210> a

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:28.429 
about the propellers they're kind of a

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:30.560 
about the propellers they're kind of a
but<00:00:29.429> then<00:00:29.580> again<00:00:29.699> whenever<00:00:30.090> you<00:00:30.300> think<00:00:30.330> about

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
but then again whenever you think about

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:31.640 
but then again whenever you think about
it<00:00:30.779> kind<00:00:30.929> of<00:00:30.960> looks<00:00:31.140> like<00:00:31.199> they're<00:00:31.470> just

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
it kind of looks like they're just

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.950 
it kind of looks like they're just
spinning<00:00:32.489> so<00:00:32.759> fast<00:00:32.790> that<00:00:33.270> they<00:00:33.630> look<00:00:33.840> like

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
spinning so fast that they look like

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.260 
spinning so fast that they look like
they're<00:00:34.170> standing<00:00:34.469> still<00:00:34.739> so<00:00:35.120> because<00:00:36.120> you

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
they're standing still so because you

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.549 
they're standing still so because you
can<00:00:36.420> actually<00:00:36.450> see<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:38.090> the<00:00:39.090> actual

00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:39.559 
can actually see the the actual

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:44.080 
can actually see the the actual
propeller<00:00:40.559> thing<00:00:40.920> right<00:00:41.100> there<00:00:41.340> and<00:00:41.870> they<00:00:42.870> do

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.090 
propeller thing right there and they do

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:51.080 
propeller thing right there and they do
pop<00:00:45.090> off<00:00:46.520> but<00:00:47.520> you<00:00:47.640> have<00:00:47.730> get<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:49.760> you<00:00:50.760> kind<00:00:51.000> of

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
pop off but you have get the you kind of

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.369 
pop off but you have get the you kind of
actually<00:00:51.239> have<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:51.660> make<00:00:51.809> them<00:00:51.960> pop<00:00:52.469> off

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:54.379 
actually have to make them pop off

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:58.069 
actually have to make them pop off
because<00:00:56.090> they're<00:00:57.090> on<00:00:57.210> ball<00:00:57.420> joints<00:00:57.809> on<00:00:57.930> there

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
because they're on ball joints on there

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.260 
because they're on ball joints on there
so<00:00:58.379> but<00:00:58.530> our<00:00:58.680> listing<00:00:59.160> any<00:00:59.280> reason<00:00:59.609> to<00:00:59.640> take

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
so but our listing any reason to take

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:06.830 
so but our listing any reason to take
them<00:01:00.390> off<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:01.370> they<00:01:02.370> can<00:01:05.060> take<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:06.210> turn<00:01:06.390> all

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
them off and they can take and turn all

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.960 
them off and they can take and turn all
the<00:01:07.020> way<00:01:07.070> except<00:01:09.799> their<00:01:10.799> arm<00:01:10.979> just<00:01:11.760> kind<00:01:11.939> of

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
the way except their arm just kind of

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:20.340 
the way except their arm just kind of
gets<00:01:12.150> in<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.330> way<00:01:17.479> together

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
gets in the way together

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.990 
gets in the way together
anyway<00:01:21.189> there's<00:01:21.760> not<00:01:21.939> too<00:01:22.479> much<00:01:22.750> difficulty

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
anyway there's not too much difficulty

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.390 
anyway there's not too much difficulty
to<00:01:25.000> him<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:29.290> interesting<00:01:29.799> part<00:01:30.040> about<00:01:30.100> this

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:30.400 
to him the interesting part about this

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.880 
to him the interesting part about this
is<00:01:30.460> that<00:01:30.670> this<00:01:31.540> head<00:01:31.810> actually<00:01:32.229> comes<00:01:32.560> forward

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
is that this head actually comes forward

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.830 
is that this head actually comes forward
and<00:01:34.439> it<00:01:35.439> could<00:01:35.619> not<00:01:35.799> be<00:01:36.420> looking<00:01:37.420> around<00:01:37.509> and

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
and it could not be looking around and

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:43.139 
and it could not be looking around and
stuff<00:01:38.970> sort<00:01:39.970> of<00:01:41.640> don't<00:01:42.640> was<00:01:42.820> supposed<00:01:43.030> to<00:01:43.090> come

00:01:43.139 --> 00:01:43.149 
stuff sort of don't was supposed to come

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:45.690 
stuff sort of don't was supposed to come
up<00:01:43.210> that's<00:01:43.930> why<00:01:44.110> and<00:01:45.039> come<00:01:45.190> out<00:01:45.310> all<00:01:45.490> the<00:01:45.580> way

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
up that's why and come out all the way

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.630 
up that's why and come out all the way
like<00:01:45.880> this<00:01:46.090> I<00:01:46.330> can<00:01:46.780> look<00:01:46.930> around<00:01:47.049> him<00:01:47.289> whatever

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
like this I can look around him whatever

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.620 
like this I can look around him whatever
but<00:01:48.640> I<00:01:48.670> prefer<00:01:49.180> to<00:01:49.570> keep<00:01:49.720> it<00:01:50.909> inside<00:01:51.909> there

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
but I prefer to keep it inside there

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.800 
but I prefer to keep it inside there
because<00:01:53.670> that's<00:01:54.670> how<00:01:54.880> it<00:01:55.030> originally<00:01:55.390> was<00:01:55.450> and

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
because that's how it originally was and

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.210 
because that's how it originally was and
he<00:01:55.869> didn't<00:01:56.110> actually<00:01:56.289> originally<00:01:56.770> had<00:01:57.039> these

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.220 
he didn't actually originally had these

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.950 
he didn't actually originally had these
little<00:01:57.850> eyes<00:01:58.090> there<00:01:58.600> either<00:01:58.810> so<00:02:00.390> yeah<00:02:01.390> it's<00:02:01.899> a

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
little eyes there either so yeah it's a

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:07.980 
little eyes there either so yeah it's a
pretty<00:02:02.080> interesting<00:02:05.069> figure<00:02:06.270> any<00:02:07.270> way<00:02:07.450> to

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
pretty interesting figure any way to

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.050 
pretty interesting figure any way to
transform<00:02:08.800> him<00:02:09.069> it's<00:02:09.310> not<00:02:09.489> reasonable<00:02:09.700> just

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
transform him it's not reasonable just

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.259 
transform him it's not reasonable just
pull<00:02:10.360> I<00:02:11.370> said<00:02:12.370> it's<00:02:12.519> not<00:02:12.610> very<00:02:12.760> simple<00:02:13.150> but

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:13.269 
pull I said it's not very simple but

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:16.289 
pull I said it's not very simple but
it's<00:02:13.450> actually<00:02:13.569> very<00:02:13.780> simple<00:02:14.910> just<00:02:15.910> pull<00:02:16.180> the

00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:16.299 
it's actually very simple just pull the

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:22.559 
it's actually very simple just pull the
arms<00:02:16.569> down<00:02:16.780> like<00:02:17.049> this<00:02:17.260> and<00:02:18.360> then<00:02:21.420> just<00:02:22.420> kind

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 
arms down like this and then just kind

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:29.350 
arms down like this and then just kind
of

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:35.090 

there<00:02:30.360> we<00:02:30.480> go<00:02:30.800> this<00:02:31.800> part<00:02:32.160> comes<00:02:32.640> down<00:02:34.100> like

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
there we go this part comes down like

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:40.400 
there we go this part comes down like
this<00:02:36.230> popping<00:02:37.230> that<00:02:37.530> out<00:02:37.880> actually<00:02:38.880> yeah<00:02:39.840> you

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
this popping that out actually yeah you

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:45.230 
this popping that out actually yeah you
just<00:02:40.500> want<00:02:40.710> to<00:02:43.430> pump<00:02:44.430> this<00:02:44.610> part<00:02:44.940> out<00:02:45.030> like

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
just want to pump this part out like

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.440 
just want to pump this part out like
this<00:02:45.450> and<00:02:45.780> then<00:02:46.440> the<00:02:46.560> head<00:02:46.770> comes<00:02:47.450> straight

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
this and then the head comes straight

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:55.790 
this and then the head comes straight
out<00:02:48.810> of<00:02:49.470> there<00:02:51.440> and<00:02:54.230> normally<00:02:55.230> I<00:02:55.260> keep<00:02:55.500> that<00:02:55.650> I

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
out of there and normally I keep that I

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.030 
out of there and normally I keep that I
keep<00:02:55.890> it<00:02:56.190> kind<00:02:56.310> of<00:02:56.400> like<00:02:56.550> that<00:02:57.770> because<00:02:58.770> you

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
keep it kind of like that because you

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.010 
keep it kind of like that because you
know<00:02:59.420> the<00:03:00.420> tall<00:03:00.630> was<00:03:00.870> on<00:03:00.989> the<00:03:01.110> show<00:03:01.940> and<00:03:03.020> you

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
know the tall was on the show and you

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:08.060 
know the tall was on the show and you
can<00:03:04.709> have<00:03:04.800> them<00:03:04.890> like<00:03:05.040> this<00:03:06.770> where<00:03:07.770> he's<00:03:07.890> just

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
can have them like this where he's just

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:12.260 
can have them like this where he's just
kind<00:03:08.250> of<00:03:08.340> I<00:03:08.870> mean<00:03:09.870> that's<00:03:10.080> very<00:03:11.270> screen

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 
kind of I mean that's very screen

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:17.090 
kind of I mean that's very screen
accurate<00:03:13.820> to<00:03:14.820> me<00:03:15.000> anyway<00:03:15.440> the<00:03:16.440> colors<00:03:16.739> are<00:03:16.920> all

know what I'm talking about but yeah the
only<00:04:06.510> disappointing<00:04:07.349> thing<00:04:07.620> is<00:04:07.800> really<00:04:08.010> he

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
only disappointing thing is really he

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.440 
only disappointing thing is really he
has<00:04:08.430> no<00:04:08.840> no<00:04:10.160> fingers<00:04:11.160> but<00:04:11.760> then<00:04:11.940> again<00:04:11.970> he's

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
has no no fingers but then again he's

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:18.560 
has no no fingers but then again he's
just<00:04:12.660> so<00:04:12.840> small<00:04:13.170> that<00:04:14.030> that<00:04:17.299> that<00:04:18.299> there's

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
just so small that that that there's

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.170 
just so small that that that there's
just<00:04:18.630> no<00:04:18.870> reason<00:04:19.489> for<00:04:20.489> him<00:04:20.579> to<00:04:20.669> have<00:04:21.060> any

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
just no reason for him to have any

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.920 
just no reason for him to have any
fingers<00:04:21.510> you<00:04:22.049> know<00:04:22.139> I<00:04:22.169> think<00:04:22.470> actually<00:04:23.930> these

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
fingers you know I think actually these

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.450 
fingers you know I think actually these
things<00:04:25.200> are<00:04:25.320> supposed<00:04:25.440> to<00:04:25.620> be<00:04:25.710> out<00:04:25.830> like<00:04:25.950> this

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:35.500 

I'm<00:04:29.460> just<00:04:29.610> kind<00:04:29.850> of<00:04:32.150> wrist<00:04:33.150> no<00:04:33.389> i<00:04:33.630> don't<00:04:33.900> know

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:35.510 
I'm just kind of wrist no i don't know

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:37.370 
I'm just kind of wrist no i don't know
maybe<00:04:36.510> they<00:04:36.660> are<00:04:36.750> supposed<00:04:37.080> to<00:04:37.110> be<00:04:37.200> like<00:04:37.350> that

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 
maybe they are supposed to be like that

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:42.860 
maybe they are supposed to be like that
one<00:04:37.740> I<00:04:39.590> can't<00:04:40.590> remember<00:04:41.060> fully<00:04:42.060> of<00:04:42.570> all<00:04:42.750> the

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
one I can't remember fully of all the

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.320 
one I can't remember fully of all the
details<00:04:43.260> and<00:04:43.500> then<00:04:43.950> he's<00:04:44.310> just<00:04:44.340> so<00:04:44.760> simple<00:04:45.060> of

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
details and then he's just so simple of

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.810 
details and then he's just so simple of
a<00:04:45.389> transformation<00:04:45.720> that<00:04:46.350> all<00:04:46.979> you<00:04:47.310> have<00:04:47.490> to<00:04:47.669> do

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:47.820 
a transformation that all you have to do

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:58.129 
a transformation that all you have to do
is<00:04:48.780> just<00:04:52.490> look<00:04:53.490> just<00:04:55.070> like<00:04:56.070> that<00:04:56.990> and<00:04:57.990> it's

00:04:58.129 --> 00:04:58.139 
is just look just like that and it's

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:01.640 
is just look just like that and it's
back<00:04:58.290> into<00:04:58.560> a<00:04:58.590> plane<00:04:58.800> again<00:04:58.830> or<00:05:00.650> whatever

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650 
back into a plane again or whatever

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:06.529 
back into a plane again or whatever
whatever<00:05:02.250> he<00:05:02.550> is<00:05:03.919> he<00:05:04.919> all<00:05:05.010> sizes<00:05:05.250> gun<00:05:05.729> they<00:05:06.390> can

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:06.539 
whatever he is he all sizes gun they can

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:12.210 
whatever he is he all sizes gun they can
go<00:05:06.710> forward<00:05:07.710> and<00:05:07.919> back<00:05:08.160> but<00:05:08.660> yeah

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:12.220 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:18.600 

I<00:05:12.930> mean<00:05:13.930> I<00:05:14.020> guess<00:05:14.050> if<00:05:14.380> you<00:05:14.500> look<00:05:14.680> at<00:05:14.830> him<00:05:15.000> um<00:05:17.610> the

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:18.610 
I mean I guess if you look at him um the

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:23.640 
I mean I guess if you look at him um the
right<00:05:18.790> way<00:05:20.100> he<00:05:21.100> could<00:05:21.510> sort<00:05:22.510> of<00:05:22.690> look<00:05:22.900> like<00:05:22.930> the

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:23.650 
right way he could sort of look like the

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:29.190 
right way he could sort of look like the
actual<00:05:24.010> obsidian<00:05:24.600> but<00:05:25.600> i<00:05:26.760> mean<00:05:27.760> i<00:05:28.210> think<00:05:28.960> it

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:29.200 
actual obsidian but i mean i think it

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:33.410 
actual obsidian but i mean i think it
was<00:05:29.260> like<00:05:29.320> a<00:05:29.470> like<00:05:30.130> a<00:05:30.160> very<00:05:30.600> dark<00:05:31.600> teal<00:05:32.200> color

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:33.420 
was like a like a very dark teal color

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:36.870 
was like a like a very dark teal color
maybe<00:05:34.420> it<00:05:34.540> was<00:05:34.600> like<00:05:34.690> a<00:05:34.810> dark<00:05:35.740> greenish<00:05:36.340> blue

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:36.880 
maybe it was like a dark greenish blue

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:42.480 
maybe it was like a dark greenish blue
sort<00:05:37.360> of<00:05:37.450> color<00:05:39.120> so<00:05:40.800> but<00:05:41.800> I<00:05:41.890> I<00:05:41.920> can't<00:05:42.370> remember

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:42.490 
sort of color so but I I can't remember

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:46.440 
sort of color so but I I can't remember
exactly<00:05:43.950> the<00:05:44.950> type<00:05:45.160> of<00:05:45.190> color<00:05:45.460> that<00:05:45.670> it<00:05:45.760> was<00:05:46.030> on

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:46.450 
exactly the type of color that it was on

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:49.110 
exactly the type of color that it was on
I<00:05:47.160> seriously<00:05:48.160> think<00:05:48.490> it<00:05:48.610> was<00:05:48.700> the<00:05:48.790> universe

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:49.120 
I seriously think it was the universe

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:52.530 
I seriously think it was the universe
