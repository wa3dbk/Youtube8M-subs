00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
the 1800 GT long loud beep problem

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.820 
the 1800 GT long loud beep problem
occurs<00:00:05.850> when<00:00:06.150> you<00:00:06.299> do<00:00:06.480> not<00:00:06.660> plug<00:00:06.990> in<00:00:07.170> the<00:00:07.319> 6-pin

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
occurs when you do not plug in the 6-pin

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.700 
occurs when you do not plug in the 6-pin
connector<00:00:08.450> Simon<00:00:09.450> who<00:00:09.599> wrote<00:00:09.929> a<00:00:10.139> very<00:00:10.349> lengthy

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
connector Simon who wrote a very lengthy

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.730 
connector Simon who wrote a very lengthy
letter<00:00:11.610> to<00:00:11.849> me<00:00:12.030> said<00:00:12.840> he<00:00:13.019> plugged<00:00:13.349> in<00:00:13.500> his

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
letter to me said he plugged in his

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.340 
letter to me said he plugged in his
power<00:00:13.980> connector<00:00:14.460> so<00:00:15.179> in<00:00:15.540> that<00:00:15.809> case<00:00:16.049> I'm

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
power connector so in that case I'm

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.590 
power connector so in that case I'm
guessing<00:00:16.830> that<00:00:16.859> he's<00:00:17.580> either<00:00:17.910> not<00:00:18.119> getting

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
guessing that he's either not getting

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.189 
guessing that he's either not getting
any<00:00:18.900> or<00:00:19.230> enough<00:00:19.920> power<00:00:20.609> through<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:21.660> 6-pin

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
any or enough power through the 6-pin

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.439 
any or enough power through the 6-pin
connector<00:00:22.519> since<00:00:23.519> she's<00:00:23.670> plugged<00:00:23.939> it<00:00:24.119> in<00:00:24.240> I

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
connector since she's plugged it in I

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.310 
connector since she's plugged it in I
would<00:00:24.720> recommend<00:00:25.080> taking<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:27.320> power

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
would recommend taking the power

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.810 
would recommend taking the power
splitter<00:00:28.890> that<00:00:29.750> came<00:00:30.750> with<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:31.050> card<00:00:31.320> and

splitter that came with the card and

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.970 
splitter that came with the card and
using<00:00:32.820> that<00:00:33.090> instead<00:00:33.469> now<00:00:34.469> a<00:00:34.500> lot<00:00:34.770> of<00:00:34.829> people

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
using that instead now a lot of people

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.479 
using that instead now a lot of people

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
80 plus certified as a thermaltake so I

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.520 
80 plus certified as a thermaltake so I
would<00:01:40.710> recommend<00:01:41.040> at<00:01:41.430> least<00:01:41.570> a<00:01:42.570> 500<00:01:43.350> watt

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
would recommend at least a 500 watt

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
power supply for a single 8800 GT but i

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.080 
power supply for a single 8800 GT but i
would<00:01:47.430> highly<00:01:47.729> recommend<00:01:49.280> going<00:01:50.280> with<00:01:50.399> a<00:01:50.520> 600

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
a 700 watt power supply I would highly

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.690 
a 700 watt power supply I would highly
recommend<00:02:03.079> getting<00:02:04.079> on<00:02:04.350> 800<00:02:04.890> a<00:02:05.070> lot<00:02:05.460> of<00:02:05.549> power

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
recommend getting on 800 a lot of power
