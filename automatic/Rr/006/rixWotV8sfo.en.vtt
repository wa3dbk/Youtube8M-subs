00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.949
 Randomly battle on the map passes lasvill 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:27.340
 most often in two scenarios 

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:29.380
 teams either merge the city or click 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:31.949
 beak into the gorge and then frantically 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.629
 trying to protect its own base 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.420
 sometimes of course wildly successful 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:40.659
 passages along the gut but most likely either 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:43.510
 pad I mean beautiful alpine town 

00:00:40.659 --> 00:00:46.780
 or lost no less beautiful mountain 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.699
 Tissen desire to merge on any of 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.300
 I did not have any options 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:52.449
 no 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:55.510
 but tell me why merge if you can 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:56.710
 think and win rightly therefore 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.660
 I did not hurry 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.449
 for starters decided to see just 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:03.960
 going team to town headed 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:03.960
 childhood 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:12.119
 object 268 t-54 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:19.970
 a m x 50 120 stages in fact a third 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:23.480
 the team and the third part of the top tanks 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:26.300
 enough for gut defense 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:27.260
 entrenched as many as terrible chips in the face 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:32.200
 I test 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:32.200
 lagger and object 268 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.670
 competent t-54 escaped to the center illumination 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.280
 guts 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.540
 it turns out that almost a third of our team 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.600
 overlaps the gut 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.790
 two fighters peacefully slept spawn points and 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.430
 this way to cover the gorge here 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:52.630
 left two pd 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:55.820
 su-122 54 and object 704 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.680
 companies from artillery principle quite 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.050
 enough to keep 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.420
 stupid opponent attempts to pass 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:04.160
 through the pass but I decided not to risk it and 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.310
 don't go far from the base just 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:09.710
 case there is a great position for 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:15.640
 borschik which is very good in command 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:18.980
 fights and decided for the time being to stop her 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:21.380
 we so famously flew into the city if 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.360
 believe the situation on the minimap that i 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:26.390
 seriously began to fear for and health 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:29.390
 already wanted to rush headlong to 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:31.820
 help but noticed that the enemy is not 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.920
 shows us activity behind the gorge 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:37.730
 there has been a successful enemy rush 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:40.250
 teams had to urgently turn around 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:44.360
 and fly to the aid of the defenders of our base 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:46.000
 there are only two of them left 704 cnc 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:50.330
 ls out of 8 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.040
 Su-122 54 has already gone to the hangar threat 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.209
 noticed and the cake with all legs 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.000
 hurrying to the rescue 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:58.430
 that I was just pleased with the chances 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.030
 fast and high-quality crust attack aircraft 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:05.440
 increased dramatically 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:08.440
 them there was not so little object 268 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:11.890
 object 704 t-62a 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.540
 and also there are 8 probably with support 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.430
 enemy artillery so on this 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:19.720
 direction of opposing forces 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:22.959
 almost equal to two dozen two ninth 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:25.900
 level they have against 1 10 and 3 9 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:28.750
 we have to start I took the position for 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.700
 tanks fearing artillery in the calculation 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.790
 the fact that I will keep under fire 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:36.690
 from the gorge however the enemy was shy and 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:39.220
 somewhere hiding his attacking rush 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.200
 apparently hoping for the support of his 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.820
 gery 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:45.130
 such situations when attack aircraft 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:48.040
 tucked under the wall of our base and not 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:50.290
 hesitant to go on can be very beautiful 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.480
 grind them just need a little 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:55.120
 determination and common sense 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:58.560
 the essence is just to go over the heads and 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.560
 put between two fires 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:04.900
 however, it should be done only 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:07.660
 If all the attackers gathered in 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:10.930
 one bunch now hold tempting 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:15.040
 enemy t-62a prevents the combination 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:17.850
 if it means to remove it and start 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.850
 under the serge 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:23.560
 now he will stick out we spout sniff 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:26.310
 than smell frags and we therefore nose 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.310
 embed 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:35.680
 enemy tale did not fail successfully 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.930
 it turned out took from the first shot with 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.620
 help allies and now i have 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:43.750
 hands untied 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:47.310
 couple commit death number here 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:53.650
 an elephant accelerates a jump 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:56.069
 here's your banana oh how good it flew 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:58.660
 from the eighth straight to the pumpkin 

00:04:56.069 --> 00:05:01.060
 Now you should quickly go to the shelter and 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:02.050
 already from a warm and dry place with a full 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:05.110
 by comfort 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:07.210
 throw assault there is a splash in the ass any 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:10.240
 thereby bringing the victory closer 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:13.470
 Well, then everything is simple and usually the case 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:16.030
 technicians not needing explanations 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:18.520
 let the battle goes on and we 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:20.560
 a little reasoning strange thing 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:23.530
 quite obvious tactical move 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:25.300
 allowing fast it is very fast 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:27.490
 achieve superiority on direction 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:29.740
 gorge power or breakthrough case 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:31.150
 and not only there if you figure it out 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:33.400
 this reception is practically not 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:34.810
 occur in a random and extremely 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:37.449
 rarely occurs in company 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:39.070
 and team battles I know in advance that 

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:41.409
 after the first video views 

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:43.740
 there will be commentators with very deep 

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:46.300
 I thought you have just got lucky this time 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:48.460
 by no means luck 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:50.349
 this is a calculation and now we are more 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:53.349
 let's see why it is so easy 

00:05:50.349 --> 00:05:56.469
 breakthrough over the heads of the eyes or the word 

00:05:53.349 --> 00:05:56.710
 here is an example from a team battle which is like 

00:05:56.469 --> 00:05:58.690
 time 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:00.969
 important is the rate of destruction of the enemy 

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:02.710
 technology on a separate direction can 

00:06:00.969 --> 00:06:04.990
 stand and wait for the enemy to come out 

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:07.000
 under your shot losing time and maybe 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:08.650
 huter and you can just jump out and 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.169
 put it between two fires 

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:13.300
 providing the team a gain in time and 

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:14.070
 having thus tactical 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:17.380
 superiority 

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:19.320
 You can think that this is luck, but better 

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:22.330
 try to understand under what conditions 

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:24.250
 reception of passage over the heads is not at all 

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:27.750
 deadly number a most effective 

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:30.190
 the way of doing is simple enough 

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:32.680
 applied class character 

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:35.050
 relief at the base is such that up to 

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:37.539
 the enemy does not see the last moment 

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:40.150
 you and most importantly can not for you 

00:06:37.539 --> 00:06:42.310
 shoot and when you land your 

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:45.460
 opponents will have to waste time on 1 

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:47.920
 Ruth Tower and this time you just 

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:53.310
 enough to take shelter like everything 

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:54.580
 understandable yes conditions first fast tank with 

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:58.570
 tlt 

00:06:54.580 --> 00:07:00.850
 or french heavy drum amx 50b 

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:04.450
 fifty one hundred fifty one hundred twenty 

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:07.540
 conditions of the second rear of the enemy should not 

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:11.290
 be anyone who could you 3 and tie 

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:13.630
 word fights and third don't stand a 

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:17.080
 first in the shelter and then 

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:20.770
 shoot that's all and the battle is over and 

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:23.250
 video with you was an elephant strides to you on 

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:23.250
 battlefields
