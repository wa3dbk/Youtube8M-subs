00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:14.369
 Honey is a valuable natural product 

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:18.169
 It contains up to 180 different ingredients 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:22.679
 these include different kindles 

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:26.379
 Minerals Trace Elements Amino Acids and Pollen 

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:30.550
 but above all, honey is contained in the honey 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.560
 after all, more than 15 different sugars 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.570
 including fructose and glucose 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.600
 can not be tested at the bee institute alone in case of crisis 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.330
 the scientists are studying the quality of the honey 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.330
 To do this, they check whether a specific enzyme is present 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.820
 First, the honey must dissolve in the water 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.180
 This honey water is mixed with a substance solution 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.020
 Harare 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:00.040
 then the solution must stand for 15 minutes at 70 degrees in a water bath 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:08.300
 during this time the enzyme in honey splits the added agent 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.790
 the yellowish color indicates that the honey is of high quality 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.220
 Quality is 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.540
 With such investigations, scientists can accurately measure the amount of 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.740
 Determine ingredients in honey 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.740
 and with it the effect of honey in the human body 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.680
 For one thing, there are sugar bombs that Moser Holding like fructose or glucose 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.280
 Those who simply go to the end of their diet very well get into the blood and quickly 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.220
 Give a percent takes the body to our metabolism but also come 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.410
 somehow as serious as enzymes here are percent contained in the voice 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:50.810
 Per cent the system Coco support in its activities it also has one 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.270
 Igniter was what, for example, against microorganisms 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.190
 other substances are flavonoids are included we are known for it 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.260
 that they can catch free radicals, for example 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.260
 and then diseases can also start to prevent 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.259
 Uhlig does not kill any kind 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.699
 It accelerates wound healing 

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:15.609
 to check if honey actually becomes a natural remedy 

00:02:15.609 --> 00:02:18.629
 Scientists apply a honey solution to small platelets 

00:02:19.749 --> 00:02:23.879
 Lotte then places the cookies in a Petri dish 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:27.349
 in it are Carrie's or Alter's pathogens 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:30.279
 and actually the honey is effective 

00:02:30.279 --> 00:02:35.309
 now Holtby l Nico was able to keep an organism under control 

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:38.119
 not grown any further that I'm lucky Oliver dinner stop that 

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:39.739
 Brake the Holocene 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:43.510
 and that was already known at the end of Schur's time and has not been heard yet 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.879
 Mechanisms Fame of Grundig pro man was already known by the Greeks 

00:02:47.749 --> 00:02:52.459
 to use the killings and Monika can now existing that these 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:55.480
 Wounds heal faster that they do not start to aging and the like 

00:02:56.689 --> 00:02:59.810
 to continue to harvest honey in sufficient quantities 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.810
 Udo must know his bees were protected from the Varroa mite 

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:08.669
 under these honeycombs against the stop the car with the bees offspring there 

00:03:08.669 --> 00:03:11.769
 below, the varroa mite has arrived 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:14.669
 Uwe Kellner knows the preferences of the bloodsucker 

00:03:14.669 --> 00:03:18.899
 in the honeycombs of the male bees of the so-called drones rents are present 

00:03:18.899 --> 00:03:20.499
 to find everything 

00:03:20.499 --> 00:03:24.469
 if the drones are far larger than the worker bees and thus provide 

00:03:24.469 --> 00:03:27.659
 the parasites more food 

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:31.189
 Udo Kellner bred drones all summer long 

00:03:31.189 --> 00:03:34.579
 so he manages to isolate the mites 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:37.779
 already at the first control of the drones was again the experienced beekeeper 

00:03:37.779 --> 00:03:39.909
 actually find it 

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:42.909
 Baron given and the offspring 

00:03:47.619 --> 00:03:50.040
 to successfully fight the parasites 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.189
 The beekeeper removes the entire drones Babel 

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:57.349
 so he can suddenly remove a large number of the bloodsucker from the hive 

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:01.359
 the larvae were covered then he spent afterwards 

00:04:02.279 --> 00:04:06.169
 we have the right to Brew Dog at the end of the fall after honey production 

00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:10.469
 Elena wants his beehives for the winter before noting though with the iron 

00:04:10.469 --> 00:04:13.799
 Another remedy for the varroa mite 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:17.359
 for bees the acid is harmless but the mite is destroyed 

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:23.099
 the beekeeper applies the formic acid to a sponge 

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:29.409
 put into the stick nevertheless the formic acid evaporates and distributes itself in the 

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:30.349
 air 

00:04:30.349 --> 00:04:33.349
 The rents are thus prevented from spreading 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.090
 Meanwhile, science is looking for others for the varroa mite 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:48.460
 fight 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.039
 At the bee institute in Zell try Werner von der Ohe and his 

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:55.900
 Team bees to breed queens who recognize the mite as an enemy 

00:04:59.569 --> 00:05:03.869
 yes they should recognize or OMD since Roland Zerhusen Tropez eu-law 

00:05:03.869 --> 00:05:05.230
 learned during 

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:09.160
 the ongoing challenge with which the further development of Voort 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:10.800
 Vomit 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.979
 this new generation of queens are supposed to produce offspring 

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:18.690
 who would be against the bloodsucker and not on the protection of the 

00:05:18.689 --> 00:05:20.529
 Beekeepers are dependent 

00:05:20.529 --> 00:05:23.419
 Bodo Kellner also trusted new beekeeping 

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:27.409
 He has made some young birds his whole hope for the coming year 

00:05:29.499 --> 00:05:32.149
 in the spring of this year were the losses due to the varroa mite 

00:05:32.149 --> 00:05:34.680
 dramatically almost half of all peoples 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:36.680
 why to engage affected groups 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.229
 but the Piggen measures have taken hold now 

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:42.259
 two thirds of bee colonies have a good chance of surviving
