losing them there's not really a
question<00:00:16.410> here<00:00:17.750> but<00:00:18.750> I<00:00:18.900> want<00:00:19.080> to<00:00:19.170> just<00:00:19.410> kind<00:00:19.590> of

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
question here but I want to just kind of

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.080 
question here but I want to just kind of
pull<00:00:19.800> out<00:00:19.920> what<00:00:20.130> you're<00:00:20.310> asking<00:00:20.640> for<00:00:20.670> which<00:00:20.970> is

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
pull out what you're asking for which is

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.859 
pull out what you're asking for which is
essentially<00:00:21.570> that<00:00:21.779> you<00:00:22.680> have<00:00:22.859> this

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:23.869 
essentially that you have this

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:26.540 
essentially that you have this
unpleasant<00:00:24.869> itch<00:00:25.109> when<00:00:26.010> you<00:00:26.130> knew<00:00:26.279> when<00:00:26.519> you

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
unpleasant itch when you knew when you

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.490 
unpleasant itch when you knew when you
loose<00:00:26.760> another<00:00:27.119> rig<00:00:27.300> so<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:27.869> question<00:00:28.230> is<00:00:28.289> why

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
loose another rig so the question is why

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.849 
loose another rig so the question is why
what<00:00:29.490> is<00:00:29.730> causing<00:00:30.449> it<00:00:30.750> I<00:00:30.990> think<00:00:31.740> that's

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
what is causing it I think that's

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:32.600 
what is causing it I think that's
something<00:00:31.949> you<00:00:32.099> got<00:00:32.219> to<00:00:32.279> start<00:00:32.430> asking

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
something you got to start asking

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.360 
something you got to start asking
yourself<00:00:32.880> after<00:00:33.450> it<00:00:33.510> happens<00:00:33.840> and<00:00:34.370> start

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
yourself after it happens and start

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.729 
yourself after it happens and start
actually<00:00:35.690> tracking<00:00:36.690> some<00:00:37.320> of<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.469> thoughts

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
actually tracking some of the thoughts

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.090 
actually tracking some of the thoughts
that<00:00:37.860> you<00:00:38.010> have<00:00:38.219> or<00:00:38.579> just<00:00:39.570> try<00:00:40.020> to<00:00:40.469> describe<00:00:40.829> in

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
words what the feeling is what we're

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.520 
words what the feeling is what we're
trying<00:00:43.469> to<00:00:43.559> do<00:00:43.739> is<00:00:43.890> always<00:00:45.469> understand<00:00:46.469> ur

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
trying to do is always understand ur

lying cause of this particular problem

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.060 
lying cause of this particular problem
okay<00:00:48.719> and<00:00:48.930> it<00:00:49.020> obviously<00:00:49.140> is<00:00:49.590> different

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
okay and it obviously is different

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.069 
okay and it obviously is different
losing<00:00:50.820> against<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.180> fish<00:00:51.360> versus<00:00:51.809> losing

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
losing against the fish versus losing

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.290 
losing against the fish versus losing
against<00:00:52.350> a<00:00:52.410> regular<00:00:52.739> and<00:00:52.920> so<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:54.059> more<00:00:54.270> you

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
against a regular and so the more you

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.520 
against a regular and so the more you
begin<00:00:54.660> to<00:00:54.690> think<00:00:54.809> about<00:00:55.140> this<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.500> more

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
begin to think about this the more

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.860 
begin to think about this the more
you're<00:00:55.770> going<00:00:55.860> to<00:00:55.949> start<00:00:56.070> pulling<00:00:56.629> the<00:00:57.629> data

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
you're going to start pulling the data

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.720 
you're going to start pulling the data
kind<00:00:58.350> of<00:00:58.410> out<00:00:58.530> of<00:00:58.559> your<00:00:58.800> subconscious<00:00:59.039> out<00:00:59.609> of

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
kind of out of your subconscious out of

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.119 
kind of out of your subconscious out of
your<00:00:59.989> out<00:01:00.989> of<00:01:01.050> your<00:01:01.140> psyche<00:01:01.440> in<00:01:01.620> a<00:01:01.680> sense<00:01:01.920> and

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
your out of your psyche in a sense and

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.349 
your out of your psyche in a sense and
you'll<00:01:02.219> be<00:01:02.309> able<00:01:02.370> to<00:01:02.460> start<00:01:02.699> to<00:01:02.820> identify<00:01:02.940> it

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
you'll be able to start to identify it

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.600 
you'll be able to start to identify it
and<00:01:03.570> then<00:01:03.719> once<00:01:03.960> you've<00:01:04.080> identified<00:01:04.199> it<00:01:04.769> then

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
and then once you've identified it then

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.190 
and then once you've identified it then
the<00:01:05.760> process<00:01:06.210> of<00:01:06.299> actually<00:01:06.600> beginning<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:06.930> fix

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
the process of actually beginning to fix

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.870 
the process of actually beginning to fix
it<00:01:07.350> works<00:01:07.530> you<00:01:08.189> know<00:01:08.280> which<00:01:08.400> you<00:01:08.490> become<00:01:08.729> very

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
it works you know which you become very

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.550 
it works you know which you become very
very<00:01:09.060> familiar<00:01:09.420> with<00:01:09.600> doing<00:01:10.110> all<00:01:10.320> of<00:01:10.350> your

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
very familiar with doing all of your

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.950 
very familiar with doing all of your
homework<00:01:11.240> with<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.330> Journal<00:01:12.600> of<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.720> mental

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
homework with the Journal of the mental

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.380 
homework with the Journal of the mental
and<00:01:13.110> history<00:01:13.380> so<00:01:13.590> start<00:01:13.950> with<00:01:13.979> that<00:01:14.250> now<00:01:14.580> to

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
and history so start with that now to

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.429 
and history so start with that now to
give<00:01:15.540> you<00:01:15.600> a<00:01:15.630> little<00:01:15.689> bit<00:01:15.900> of<00:01:15.960> direction<00:01:16.110> here

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
give you a little bit of direction here

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.020 
give you a little bit of direction here
the<00:01:16.560> first<00:01:16.799> thing<00:01:16.920> that<00:01:16.950> would<00:01:17.130> suspect<00:01:17.640> is

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
the first thing that would suspect is

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.810 
the first thing that would suspect is
you<00:01:18.869> know<00:01:18.960> one<00:01:19.110> of<00:01:19.200> two<00:01:19.320> things<00:01:19.729> when<00:01:20.729> you're

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
you know one of two things when you're

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.550 
you know one of two things when you're
battling<00:01:21.299> out<00:01:21.479> up<00:01:21.689> against<00:01:21.990> another<00:01:22.020> regular

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
battling out up against another regular

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.170 
battling out up against another regular
where<00:01:22.710> there's<00:01:22.890> not<00:01:23.130> really<00:01:23.400> clear<00:01:23.700> defined

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
where there's not really clear defined

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.120 
where there's not really clear defined
edges<00:01:24.450> sometimes<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.229> uncertainty<00:01:25.860> of<00:01:25.890> not

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
edges sometimes the uncertainty of not

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.450 
edges sometimes the uncertainty of not
knowing<00:01:26.189> who's<00:01:26.670> better<00:01:27.110> can<00:01:28.110> cause<00:01:28.409> that<00:01:28.460> now

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
knowing who's better can cause that now

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.370 
knowing who's better can cause that now
if<00:01:29.610> you<00:01:29.759> know<00:01:30.420> that<00:01:30.720> you're<00:01:30.869> better<00:01:31.110> than<00:01:31.290> a

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
if you know that you're better than a

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.190 
if you know that you're better than a
given<00:01:31.500> regular<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:32.280> you've<00:01:32.939> proven<00:01:33.329> that<00:01:33.390> my

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
given regular and you've proven that my

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.780 
given regular and you've proven that my
guess<00:01:34.439> is<00:01:34.619> that<00:01:34.650> itch<00:01:34.950> may<00:01:35.159> not<00:01:35.340> be<00:01:35.460> there<00:01:35.670> and

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
guess is that itch may not be there and

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.660 
guess is that itch may not be there and
if<00:01:35.850> that's<00:01:36.030> true<00:01:36.420> then<00:01:37.320> it<00:01:37.829> may<00:01:38.070> be<00:01:38.130> something

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
if that's true then it may be something

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.010 
if that's true then it may be something
to<00:01:38.850> do<00:01:38.939> with<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.119> uncertainty<00:01:39.360> so<00:01:39.720> it<00:01:39.840> may<00:01:39.990> be

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
to do with the uncertainty so it may be

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.800 
to do with the uncertainty so it may be
what<00:01:40.259> kind<00:01:40.409> of<00:01:40.470> like<00:01:40.590> low-lying<00:01:41.689> version<00:01:42.689> of

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
what kind of like low-lying version of

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.080 
what kind of like low-lying version of

fear right there's a hesitation or a

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.050 
fear right there's a hesitation or a

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
discord in a sense that is just like a

discord in a sense that is just like a
tiny<00:01:51.960> fear<00:01:52.409> which<00:01:52.619> I<00:01:52.890> talk<00:01:53.490> about<00:01:53.549> in<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:53.850> book

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
tiny fear which I talk about in the book

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.539 
tiny fear which I talk about in the book
is<00:01:54.149> essentially<00:01:54.659> uncertainty<00:01:55.280> the<00:01:56.280> other<00:01:56.430> way

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
is essentially uncertainty the other way

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.609 
is essentially uncertainty the other way
to<00:01:56.579> look<00:01:56.670> at<00:01:56.880> this<00:01:56.939> is<00:01:57.270> as<00:01:57.659> a<00:01:57.750> confidence<00:01:58.439> issue

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
to look at this is as a confidence issue

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.010 
to look at this is as a confidence issue
and<00:01:58.950> again<00:01:59.820> if<00:01:59.939> you<00:02:00.030> don't<00:02:00.240> know<00:02:00.390> who<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:00.689> who

and again if you don't know who the who

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.639 
and again if you don't know who the who

the the player is with the edge and you

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.859

there may be a loss of confidence in

there may be a loss of confidence in
that<00:02:09.000> you<00:02:09.840> know<00:02:09.869> you<00:02:10.020> lost<00:02:10.489> variance<00:02:11.489> was<00:02:11.640> part

that you know you lost variance was part
of<00:02:11.940> it<00:02:12.030> but

galfond is is notorious for doing this

galfond is is notorious for doing this

and I think it's a great model playing

and I think it's a great model playing
against<00:02:32.120> tough<00:02:32.269> regulars<00:02:32.750> is<00:02:32.959> a<00:02:33.019> great<00:02:33.620> way<00:02:33.769> to

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:33.829 
against tough regulars is a great way to

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:36.390 
against tough regulars is a great way to
identify<00:02:34.099> weaknesses<00:02:35.090> in<00:02:35.569> your<00:02:35.690> game<00:02:35.900> and

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
identify weaknesses in your game and

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.649 
identify weaknesses in your game and
perhaps<00:02:37.400> opportunities<00:02:38.239> for<00:02:38.390> you<00:02:38.480> to<00:02:38.510> be

00:02:38.649 --> 00:02:38.659 
perhaps opportunities for you to be

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:41.440 
perhaps opportunities for you to be
taking<00:02:38.930> your<00:02:39.019> game<00:02:39.200> even<00:02:39.470> farther<00:02:39.739> and<00:02:40.040> so<00:02:40.760> if

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
taking your game even farther and so if

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.220 
taking your game even farther and so if

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
you lose and you're not sure why then

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.440 
you lose and you're not sure why then

that<00:02:47.690> goes<00:02:47.870> into<00:02:48.049> confidence<00:02:48.560> if<00:02:48.739> you<00:02:48.829> can

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
that goes into confidence if you can

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.440 
that goes into confidence if you can
recognize<00:02:49.129> and<00:02:49.609> distinguish<00:02:50.000> variants<00:02:50.359> and

recognize and distinguish variants and

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.300 
recognize and distinguish variants and
know<00:02:50.720> that<00:02:51.319> you<00:02:51.470> lost<00:02:51.709> because<00:02:52.069> you<00:02:52.190> got

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
know that you lost because you got

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.460 
know that you lost because you got
outplayed<00:02:52.579> then<00:02:53.359> at<00:02:53.450> least<00:02:53.540> you've<00:02:53.750> taken

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
outplayed then at least you've taken

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:55.630 
outplayed then at least you've taken
away<00:02:54.650> a<00:02:54.769> little<00:02:54.920> bit<00:02:55.010> of<00:02:55.129> the<00:02:55.190> guessing<00:02:55.489> game

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
away a little bit of the guessing game

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.270 
away a little bit of the guessing game
now<00:02:56.209> still<00:02:57.049> I<00:02:57.079> realize<00:02:57.709> that<00:02:57.799> it's<00:02:57.920> hard<00:02:58.099> to<00:02:58.190> do

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
now still I realize that it's hard to do

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.080 
now still I realize that it's hard to do
in<00:02:58.430> two<00:02:58.760> to<00:02:59.269> do<00:02:59.390> definitively<00:03:00.220> but<00:03:01.220> if<00:03:01.400> you<00:03:01.519> can

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
in two to do definitively but if you can

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:07.449 
in two to do definitively but if you can
identify<00:03:03.069> excuse<00:03:04.069> me<00:03:05.829> ways<00:03:06.829> that<00:03:07.159> your

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
identify excuse me ways that your

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:09.970 
identify excuse me ways that your
opponent<00:03:07.909> is<00:03:08.900> exploiting<00:03:09.470> you<00:03:09.590> and<00:03:09.859> so

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
opponent is exploiting you and so

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.949 
opponent is exploiting you and so
there's<00:03:10.190> a<00:03:10.280> skill<00:03:11.239> and<00:03:11.510> understanding<00:03:11.540> your

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
there's a skill and understanding your

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:13.149 
there's a skill and understanding your
opponent<00:03:12.079> skill<00:03:12.590> right<00:03:12.769> this<00:03:12.920> is<00:03:13.040> all<00:03:13.099> in

00:03:13.149 --> 00:03:13.159 
opponent skill right this is all in

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:16.000 
opponent skill right this is all in
chapter<00:03:13.549> 8<00:03:13.670> as<00:03:13.840> well<00:03:14.840> as<00:03:15.019> a<00:03:15.230> skill<00:03:15.859> and

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
chapter 8 as well as a skill and

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.670 
chapter 8 as well as a skill and
recognize<00:03:16.400> your<00:03:16.609> own<00:03:16.760> skill<00:03:17.500> when<00:03:18.500> there<00:03:19.010> is

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
recognize your own skill when there is

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.750 
recognize your own skill when there is
when<00:03:21.680> the<00:03:21.769> edges<00:03:22.010> are<00:03:22.099> that<00:03:22.250> small<00:03:22.489> I<00:03:22.700> do

when the edges are that small I do

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.370 
when the edges are that small I do
really<00:03:23.750> understand<00:03:24.380> that<00:03:24.650> it<00:03:25.069> is<00:03:25.099> hard<00:03:25.220> to<00:03:26.380> to

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
really understand that it is hard to to

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.190 
really understand that it is hard to to
define<00:03:27.709> but<00:03:28.129> again<00:03:28.940> it's<00:03:29.090> skill<00:03:29.419> you<00:03:29.810> can<00:03:29.840> get

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
define but again it's skill you can get

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.500 
define but again it's skill you can get
better<00:03:30.410> at<00:03:30.739> identifying<00:03:30.980> your<00:03:31.549> own<00:03:31.669> skill<00:03:31.970> get

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
better at identifying your own skill get

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:34.240 
better at identifying your own skill get
better<00:03:32.720> at<00:03:32.900> identifying<00:03:33.049> your<00:03:33.590> your<00:03:33.889> opponent

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
better at identifying your your opponent

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:35.710 
better at identifying your your opponent
skill<00:03:34.459> and<00:03:34.669> get<00:03:35.120> better<00:03:35.329> at<00:03:35.599> identifying

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
skill and get better at identifying

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.500 
skill and get better at identifying
variants<00:03:36.590> and<00:03:36.680> if<00:03:36.769> you<00:03:36.889> do<00:03:37.099> that<00:03:37.340> then<00:03:38.239> there's

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
variants and if you do that then there's

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:39.430 
variants and if you do that then there's
going<00:03:38.629> to<00:03:38.690> be<00:03:38.750> a<00:03:38.810> little<00:03:38.959> bit<00:03:39.079> more<00:03:39.169> clarity

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 
going to be a little bit more clarity

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.189 
going to be a little bit more clarity
and<00:03:40.190> being<00:03:40.430> able<00:03:40.519> to<00:03:40.700> define<00:03:40.970> edges<00:03:41.269> and<00:03:41.419> have

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:42.199 
and being able to define edges and have

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:43.599 
and being able to define edges and have
a<00:03:42.260> little<00:03:42.440> bit<00:03:42.530> more<00:03:42.650> understanding<00:03:43.489> about

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:43.609 
a little bit more understanding about

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:45.580 
a little bit more understanding about
what<00:03:43.790> to<00:03:44.120> do<00:03:44.269> if<00:03:44.510> you<00:03:44.720> are<00:03:44.989> getting<00:03:45.349> outplayed

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
what to do if you are getting outplayed

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:47.710 
what to do if you are getting outplayed
work<00:03:46.280> at<00:03:46.459> it<00:03:46.609> if<00:03:46.760> you<00:03:47.209> lost<00:03:47.389> because<00:03:47.690> of

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
work at it if you lost because of

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.449 
work at it if you lost because of
variance<00:03:48.169> just<00:03:48.859> stick<00:03:49.099> with<00:03:49.250> what<00:03:49.370> you're

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:49.459 
variance just stick with what you're

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:51.280 
variance just stick with what you're
doing<00:03:49.519> so<00:03:50.449> hopefully<00:03:50.780> that<00:03:50.870> simplifies

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
doing so hopefully that simplifies

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:54.309 
doing so hopefully that simplifies
things<00:03:51.319> and<00:03:52.129> again<00:03:52.400> if<00:03:52.549> not<00:03:52.870> do<00:03:53.870> the<00:03:54.019> research

00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:54.319 
things and again if not do the research

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:55.990 
things and again if not do the research
and<00:03:54.379> over<00:03:54.919> time<00:03:55.099> you'll<00:03:55.340> you'll<00:03:55.609> begin<00:03:55.819> to<00:03:55.879> get

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
and over time you'll you'll begin to get

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.490 
and over time you'll you'll begin to get
some<00:03:56.150> answers<00:03:56.299> and<00:03:56.690> you<00:03:57.079> know<00:03:57.169> if<00:03:57.230> you<00:03:57.319> want<00:03:57.440> to

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
some answers and you know if you want to

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.530 
some answers and you know if you want to
