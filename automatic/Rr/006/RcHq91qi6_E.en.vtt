obviously<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.590> image<00:01:10.860> information<00:01:11.159> is<00:01:11.549> way

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
obviously the image information is way

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.310 
obviously the image information is way
too<00:01:11.909> big<00:01:12.299> so<00:01:13.020> what<00:01:13.500> I<00:01:13.530> can<00:01:13.890> do<00:01:14.130> is<00:01:14.340> go<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:14.549> image

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
too big so what I can do is go to image

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.100 
too big so what I can do is go to image
