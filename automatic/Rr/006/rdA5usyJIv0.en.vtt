00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.940
 Hello everyone and today we will learn 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:09.030
 play the song of the tea 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:13.200
 everyone heard her a hundred times therefore sing her 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:17.460
 no sense and I just several times 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:20.580
 I will lose her in various battles so that I can 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:25.250
 then we didnâ€™t get what fight everyone 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:30.470
 will play as he likes more and 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:30.470
 I'll start with the easiest fight 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.180
 Now let's make it a little harder 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:19.650
 but I think how to play now became everything 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:23.340
 understandable from the way you fight 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:26.460
 playing her song will not get worse and even 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:30.360
 the artists themselves play and and each time 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:32.670
 differently depending on the mood so 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:36.960
 what do you know chords 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:39.690
 the wallpaper is what you get or what 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:42.050
 you like more and live and even here 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.050
 so here 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:12.640
 Well, playfully usually play drunkenness 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:17.760
 when everyone is happy and happy 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.760
 Well, I wish you all good luck for now
