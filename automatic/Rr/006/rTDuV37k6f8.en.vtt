00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.070
 hello friends like these I hope they are your 

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:06.169
 loss in contentÃ­sima to have 

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:08.240
 again on my channel and today I have them 

00:00:06.169 --> 00:00:10.540
 a jam tartlet that's going to 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.540
 fascinate 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.350
 take note of the ingredients 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:32.980
 200 grams of butter half a kilo of 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:35.300
 wheat flour 250 grams of sugar 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.380
 Strawberry jam 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:41.000
 egg 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.000
 and strawberries to decorate 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.670
 let's make the dough for the coast of 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.530
 first we mix on the table or in a 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.649
 large container the flour 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.299
 butter the sugar and an egg and let's 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.059
 to integrate all the ingredients with 

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:59.309
 hands this mass is different from the 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.809
 bread dough this is more stuck by the 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.460
 butter that is which is 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.649
 needed to give the friend of the 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.020
 tart that texture as seen in the 

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:09.750
 picture in italy this type of cake is very 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.520
 popular is what he calls embedded his 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.140
 dough is made with the pasta frola that 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.179
 It also serves to make cookies and 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.009
 other desserts its characteristic 

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:19.350
 main thing is that this mass does not have to be 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.299
 process it a lot ie just integrate 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.920
 the ingredients a bit with your hands 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.920
 until it takes off easily 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.409
 it is a mass that is not hard but neither 

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:33.250
 too soft just to be 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:33.250
 undo in the mouth 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.630
 once it takes off, it 's easy 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.540
 We will wrap the hands in 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:43.979
 film or ball paper and keep it 30 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.979
 minutes inside the fridge 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.240
 let's butter butter boiled in a 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.730
 mold so that it does not stick when you 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.610
 we are baking 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:56.200
 this mold that you are 20 cm but what 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.210
 ideal with the ingredients that I gave them 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.360
 It serves perfectly for a mold between 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:03.610
 24 and 30 cents and they still have one 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.710
 little bit of dough to decorate we are going to 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.840
 place the dough inside it and we're going 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:10.090
 to crush a little bit with your hands 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.710
 we do it on the table because when 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.540
 we plan it with the roller and try 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:15.400
 to take off the we will not be able to 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.680
 let's try something that has more or 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.450
 less a thickness of one centimeter and the 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.220
 we also carry to the edges of 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.570
 mold then with your fingers we're going to 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.660
 do the way as it shows to 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.660
 continuation 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.640
 let's now add the jam to 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.349
 the cross is there but not oscillating 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.160
 catch it with a fork to me always 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:46.160
 I forgot this step 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.569
 we spread it well throughout the mass 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:11.260
 and now let's make the typical 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:12.579
 grid that carries over to this mass if 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.989
 you can add a little more 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:16.359
 flour so you can manipulate it 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:18.700
 better let's go making the cylinders 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:20.769
 fine with a lot of patience because it 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.340
 it can break us easily and we start 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:23.340
 to decorate 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.660
 it's time to take it to the oven we're going to 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:43.209
 bake at 200 degrees centigrade between 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.620
 20 to 25 minutes remember that not all 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:46.540
 the ovens are the same there are some that 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.130
 they heat more than others and good always 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.080
 put the logic so you do not leave 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:52.510
 to burn when you see the edges 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.340
 Doradito it's time to take it out 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.650
 just leave them with jam like this 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:04:00.400
 as it is or you can decorate it with fruits 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:02.500
 and sprinkle a little icing sugar 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.239
 and we already finished as always 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.769
