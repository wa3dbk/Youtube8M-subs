00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
cool and I thought that's probably the

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:38.550 
cool and I thought that's probably the
best<00:02:37.690> way<00:02:37.810> I<00:02:37.840> could<00:02:38.019> do<00:02:38.110> is<00:02:38.200> if<00:02:38.319> they're<00:02:38.440> not

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
best way I could do is if they're not

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.830 
best way I could do is if they're not
asking<00:02:38.950> the<00:02:39.130> top<00:02:39.280> three<00:02:39.549> roles<00:02:39.790> anymore<00:02:40.239> so

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
asking the top three roles anymore so

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.630 
asking the top three roles anymore so
one<00:02:41.260> of<00:02:41.380> my<00:02:41.500> top<00:02:41.709> three<00:02:41.739> was<00:02:42.099> bibbidi<00:02:42.489> bobbidi

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
boutique so the next question kind of

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:46.500 
boutique so the next question kind of
relates<00:02:44.829> to<00:02:45.130> that<00:02:45.280> she<00:02:45.549> asks<00:02:45.940> do<00:02:46.090> you<00:02:46.120> have<00:02:46.329> any

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.140 
getting questions about photo paths I
just<00:03:02.530> put<00:03:02.709> it<00:03:02.799> as<00:03:02.980> a<00:03:03.010> moderate<00:03:03.579> choice<00:03:03.910> I<00:03:04.090> think

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
just put it as a moderate choice I think

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.210 
just put it as a moderate choice I think
on<00:03:04.630> my<00:03:05.260> application<00:03:05.769> so<00:03:05.859> I<00:03:05.889> was<00:03:05.980> a<00:03:06.040> little

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
on my application so I was a little

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.370 
on my application so I was a little
surprised<00:03:06.579> to<00:03:06.910> see<00:03:07.060> that<00:03:07.480> I<00:03:07.840> got<00:03:08.200> some

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
surprised to see that I got some

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.559 
surprised to see that I got some
questions<00:03:08.530> about<00:03:08.920> it<00:03:09.069> since<00:03:09.790> I<00:03:10.030> didn't

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:10.569 
questions about it since I didn't

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:12.479 
questions about it since I didn't
mention<00:03:11.410> it<00:03:11.560> at<00:03:11.590> all<00:03:11.799> during<00:03:12.190> the<00:03:12.340> phone

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
mention it at all during the phone

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:15.120 
mention it at all during the phone
interview<00:03:12.569> but<00:03:13.569> I<00:03:13.870> think<00:03:14.530> everyone's<00:03:14.889> having

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130 
interview but I think everyone's having

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:16.680 
interview but I think everyone's having
that<00:03:15.250> experience<00:03:15.549> so<00:03:16.150> they<00:03:16.269> kind<00:03:16.450> of<00:03:16.510> asked<00:03:16.660> me

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
that experience so they kind of asked me

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.210 
that experience so they kind of asked me
just<00:03:16.930> random<00:03:17.230> positions<00:03:17.590> that<00:03:17.799> whatever<00:03:18.100> you

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
just random positions that whatever you

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:19.920 
just random positions that whatever you
put<00:03:18.250> in<00:03:18.549> your<00:03:18.670> application<00:03:18.850> are<00:03:19.630> you<00:03:19.720> familiar

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
put in your application are you familiar

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.620 
put in your application are you familiar
with<00:03:20.319> hire<00:03:20.709> and<00:03:20.980> cameras<00:03:21.430> and<00:03:21.579> all<00:03:21.700> are<00:03:22.090> you

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630

comfortable<00:03:22.930> holding<00:03:23.410> 15<00:03:23.950> pounds<00:03:24.310> of<00:03:24.400> camera

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
comfortable holding 15 pounds of camera

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.759 
comfortable holding 15 pounds of camera
equipment<00:03:24.790> at<00:03:25.180> a<00:03:25.269> time<00:03:25.510> during<00:03:25.780> the<00:03:25.989> day<00:03:26.139> so

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:26.769 
equipment at a time during the day so

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:28.949 
equipment at a time during the day so
that's<00:03:26.889> all<00:03:27.100> she<00:03:27.250> asks<00:03:27.639> me<00:03:27.819> question<00:03:28.420> wise<00:03:28.660> and

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
that's all she asks me question wise and

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:31.650 
that's all she asks me question wise and
then<00:03:29.049> we<00:03:29.170> went<00:03:29.290> over<00:03:29.850> how<00:03:30.850> acceptance<00:03:31.480> is

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
then we went over how acceptance is

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.720 
then we went over how acceptance is
might<00:03:31.870> work<00:03:32.079> this<00:03:32.709> time<00:03:33.100> around<00:03:33.340> because<00:03:33.489> it

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
might work this time around because it

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.640 
might work this time around because it
is<00:03:33.910> gonna<00:03:34.060> be<00:03:34.150> a<00:03:34.269> little<00:03:34.389> different<00:03:34.840> so<00:03:35.590> she

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
is gonna be a little different so she

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.069 
is gonna be a little different so she
was<00:03:35.889> saying<00:03:36.100> that<00:03:36.310> they're<00:03:36.459> gonna<00:03:36.579> send<00:03:37.079> just

those are the questions I was asked

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.660 
those are the questions I was asked
during<00:04:25.550> my<00:04:25.850> DCP<00:04:26.480> interview<00:04:27.050> this<00:04:27.560> time<00:04:27.890> around

during my DCP interview this time around

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:30.160 
during my DCP interview this time around

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:30.170 
and it was a little different than last

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:33.210 
and it was a little different than last
time<00:04:30.500> because<00:04:30.590> I<00:04:30.740> did<00:04:30.890> do<00:04:31.070> the<00:04:31.790> fall<00:04:32.060> 2014

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
phone interview and it was definitely a

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:37.390 
phone interview and it was definitely a
more<00:04:35.960> traditional<00:04:36.110> one<00:04:36.620> where<00:04:37.220> they<00:04:37.310> asked

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
more traditional one where they asked

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.890 
more traditional one where they asked
you<00:04:37.520> the<00:04:37.610> top<00:04:37.760> three<00:04:37.970> roles<00:04:38.210> and<00:04:38.540> then<00:04:38.630> go<00:04:38.750> off

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900 
you the top three roles and then go off

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.690 
you the top three roles and then go off
there<00:04:39.140> with<00:04:39.440> situational<00:04:39.950> questions<00:04:40.400> and

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:40.700 
there with situational questions and

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.910 
there with situational questions and
real<00:04:40.820> specific<00:04:41.300> ones<00:04:41.480> but<00:04:42.230> this<00:04:42.320> felt<00:04:42.590> a<00:04:42.710> lot

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:42.920 
real specific ones but this felt a lot

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:46.630 
real specific ones but this felt a lot
