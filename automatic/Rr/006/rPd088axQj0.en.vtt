00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
watch it and then you start encoding now

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.630 
watch it and then you start encoding now
just<00:02:13.230> to<00:02:13.320> let<00:02:13.470> you<00:02:13.590> know<00:02:13.710> this<00:02:13.920> might<00:02:14.250> take<00:02:14.490> up

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
just to let you know this might take up

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.760 
just to let you know this might take up
to<00:02:14.670> about<00:02:15.090> an<00:02:15.240> hour<00:02:15.480> hour<00:02:15.990> and<00:02:16.380> 10<00:02:16.560> minutes

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
to about an hour hour and 10 minutes

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.850 
to about an hour hour and 10 minutes
depending<00:02:17.310> on<00:02:17.610> one's<00:02:17.850> operating<00:02:18.390> system<00:02:18.750> so<00:02:19.440> I

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
depending on one's operating system so I

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.220 
depending on one's operating system so I
wouldn't<00:02:20.370> recommend<00:02:20.490> you<00:02:21.030> using<00:02:21.810> any<00:02:22.050> other

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
wouldn't recommend you using any other

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.630 
wouldn't recommend you using any other
program<00:02:22.620> while<00:02:22.800> it's<00:02:22.920> converting<00:02:23.400> because<00:02:23.550> it

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
program while it's converting because it

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.940 
program while it's converting because it
might<00:02:23.760> do<00:02:23.940> some<00:02:23.970> damage<00:02:24.450> to<00:02:24.480> the<00:02:24.690> AVI<00:02:24.900> file<00:02:25.230> so

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
might do some damage to the AVI file so

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.190 
might do some damage to the AVI file so
that's<00:02:26.220> how<00:02:26.520> you<00:02:26.580> use<00:02:26.940> the<00:02:26.970> dami<00:02:27.360> to<00:02:27.660> convert<00:02:27.960> a

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
that's how you use the dami to convert a

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:33.620 
that's how you use the dami to convert a
DVD<00:02:29.000> into<00:02:30.000> an<00:02:30.180> AVI<00:02:30.450> file<00:02:30.810> onto<00:02:31.260> your<00:02:31.350> desktop
