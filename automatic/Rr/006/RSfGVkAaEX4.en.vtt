00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
now when I first got the Terra minx it

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.170 
now when I first got the Terra minx it
was<00:00:21.840> in<00:00:22.109> it<00:00:22.439> was<00:00:22.650> a<00:00:22.710> hundred<00:00:23.340> times<00:00:23.550> better

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
was in it was a hundred times better

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.410 
was in it was a hundred times better
than<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.720> Giga<00:00:25.320> minx<00:00:25.910> because<00:00:26.910> look<00:00:27.119> how<00:00:27.150> this

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
than the Giga minx because look how this

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.620 
than the Giga minx because look how this
turns<00:00:27.660> you<00:00:27.779> can<00:00:28.099> you<00:00:29.099> can<00:00:29.310> barely<00:00:30.029> do<00:00:30.269> a<00:00:30.300> finger

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
turns you can you can barely do a finger

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.650 
turns you can you can barely do a finger
trick<00:00:30.840> and<00:00:31.050> I<00:00:31.080> just<00:00:31.369> lubricated<00:00:32.369> it<00:00:32.520> so<00:00:33.329> yeah

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
trick and I just lubricated it so yeah

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.780 
trick and I just lubricated it so yeah
when<00:00:34.440> this<00:00:34.530> came<00:00:34.739> out<00:00:34.860> of<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.040> box<00:00:35.219> I<00:00:35.430> was<00:00:35.670> able

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
when this came out of the box I was able

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.060 
when this came out of the box I was able
to<00:00:36.090> do<00:00:36.300> this<00:00:37.010> easily<00:00:38.010> and<00:00:38.930> um<00:00:39.930> enough<00:00:40.350> they<00:00:40.770> did

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
to do this easily and um enough they did

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.619 
to do this easily and um enough they did
a<00:00:41.100> cap<00:00:41.579> those<00:00:42.510> pieces<00:00:43.050> right<00:00:43.379> there<00:00:43.710> and<00:00:44.010> that

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:44.629 
a cap those pieces right there and that

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:48.770 
a cap those pieces right there and that
this<00:00:45.629> middle<00:00:45.989> piece<00:00:46.489> so<00:00:47.489> it<00:00:47.520> does<00:00:48.120> turn<00:00:48.480> a<00:00:48.539> lot

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
this middle piece so it does turn a lot

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.080 
this middle piece so it does turn a lot
better<00:00:48.989> from<00:00:49.379> it<00:00:49.559> you<00:00:50.520> could<00:00:50.670> probably<00:00:50.850> stay

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
better from it you could probably stay

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.270 
better from it you could probably stay
right<00:00:51.270> there<00:00:51.440> that's<00:00:52.440> that's<00:00:52.800> probably<00:00:53.100> what

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
right there that's that's probably what

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.830 
right there that's that's probably what
may<00:00:53.430> made<00:00:53.820> it<00:00:53.969> turn<00:00:54.210> so<00:00:54.420> well<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:54.750> plus<00:00:55.370> it<00:00:56.370> was

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:56.840 
may made it turn so well and plus it was

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.810 
may made it turn so well and plus it was
lubricated<00:00:57.840> pre<00:00:58.320> lubed<00:00:58.609> probably<00:00:59.609> can't

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
lubricated pre lubed probably can't

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.110 
lubricated pre lubed probably can't
really<00:01:00.030> see<00:01:00.359> it<00:01:00.480> there's<00:01:01.350> a<00:01:01.410> light<00:01:01.820> yeah<00:01:02.820> when

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120
