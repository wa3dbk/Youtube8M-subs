00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.150
 welcome back to my andré channel mgr 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:09.420
 and today will show another curiosity of 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:14.040
 city 5 or where to find the bike la 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:18.570
 police bike of the polis bike of 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.619
 this game and produces a place where 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.170
 find 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.090
 now I will go if I am not there I will have to 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.330
 change character so I'm the 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.099
 video but I will do it to continue and then 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.250
 we will go to this corner 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.200
 from night streets there is no madman 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:38.910
 or lyon 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:43.890
 then usually we find we give a little if 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:46.289
 there isn't anyway it should be on 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.559
 this corner of the street 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.690
 see them should be let's do one 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.430
 what then do we go to my garage with 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.059
 frankie i will win with frankie and there 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.390
 I show 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.390
 ok 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.030
 here we are with my favorite nick 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.030
 franklin 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:13.939
 we go to the garage as I told you to 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:18.020
 let you see the bike here is the ride meetic 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:18.020
 moto of the police 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:28.549
 get up here it was then I was holding to 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:32.960
 specify that the move by the police yes 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:41.210
 he only found this madman at that point 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:45.039
 what is it that he knew then does this 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:47.479
 motorcycle but that confesses in our garage 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:50.590
 so now let's do a town like 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:50.590

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:09.940

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:13.010
