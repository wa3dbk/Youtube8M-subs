vinyl era and I really think it's
important<00:04:14.739> to<00:04:15.060> learn<00:04:16.060> how<00:04:16.090> to<00:04:16.299> mix<00:04:16.810> and<00:04:17.109> pitch

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
important to learn how to mix and pitch

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.729 
important to learn how to mix and pitch

bin manually but now with the technology

you<00:04:20.769> have<00:04:21.250> the<00:04:21.459> ability<00:04:21.849> to<00:04:21.880> actually<00:04:22.240> do<00:04:22.599> a

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
you have the ability to actually do a

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.350 
you have the ability to actually do a
sync<00:04:23.380> the<00:04:23.949> problem<00:04:24.280> with<00:04:24.400> most<00:04:24.580> software<00:04:25.150> is

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
sync the problem with most software is

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.310 
sync the problem with most software is
that<00:04:25.389> the<00:04:25.840> sync<00:04:26.199> is<00:04:26.410> forcing<00:04:27.370> you<00:04:27.490> to<00:04:27.520> look<00:04:28.320> to

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.320 
that the sync is forcing you to look to

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.710 
that the sync is forcing you to look to
beat<00:04:29.680> match<00:04:29.919> strictly<00:04:30.639> on<00:04:30.789> numerical<00:04:31.330> value

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 
beat match strictly on numerical value

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.379 
beat match strictly on numerical value
smart<00:04:32.710> sync<00:04:33.010> will<00:04:33.340> actually<00:04:33.849> know<00:04:34.090> when<00:04:34.360> I

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:34.389 
smart sync will actually know when I

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:37.110 
smart sync will actually know when I
have<00:04:34.690> a<00:04:34.720> song<00:04:35.080> that<00:04:35.500> is<00:04:35.650> half<00:04:36.010> the<00:04:36.340> normal<00:04:36.460> BPM

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
have a song that is half the normal BPM

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.839 
have a song that is half the normal BPM
so<00:04:37.690> for<00:04:37.870> example<00:04:38.289> here<00:04:38.500> I've<00:04:38.680> got<00:04:38.860> a<00:04:38.889> song<00:04:39.220> that

00:04:39.839 --> 00:04:39.849 
so for example here I've got a song that

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:43.740 
so for example here I've got a song that
is<00:04:40.000> correctly<00:04:40.449> at<00:04:40.630> 126<00:04:41.500> BPM<00:04:42.180> the<00:04:43.180> other<00:04:43.360> song

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:43.750 
is correctly at 126 BPM the other song

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.620 
is correctly at 126 BPM the other song
is<00:04:44.289> showing<00:04:44.770> sixty<00:04:45.280> three<00:04:45.669> point<00:04:46.270> something

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:46.630 
is showing sixty three point something

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:50.070 
is showing sixty three point something
BPM<00:04:47.340> that<00:04:48.340> is<00:04:48.580> actually<00:04:48.970> not<00:04:49.090> the<00:04:49.240> BPM<00:04:49.660> it's

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 
BPM that is actually not the BPM it's

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.560 
BPM that is actually not the BPM it's
very<00:04:50.349> easy<00:04:50.590> for<00:04:50.830> you<00:04:50.919> to<00:04:50.949> go<00:04:51.160> in<00:04:51.340> and<00:04:51.580> tap<00:04:51.970> the

very easy for you to go in and tap the

very easy for you to go in and tap the
tempo<00:04:52.960> in<00:04:53.139> and<00:04:53.380> it<00:04:53.470> will<00:04:53.620> adjust<00:04:54.039> that<00:04:54.310> BPM<00:04:54.699> but

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:55.479 
tempo in and it will adjust that BPM but

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:57.540 
tempo in and it will adjust that BPM but
for<00:04:55.690> those<00:04:55.840> of<00:04:56.139> you<00:04:56.260> who<00:04:56.500> don't<00:04:56.800> change<00:04:57.250> that

for those of you who don't change that

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.360 
for those of you who don't change that

actually take your

actually take your

match<00:05:09.030> the<00:05:09.360> beat<00:05:09.540> on<00:05:09.750> time<00:05:10.110> and<00:05:10.380> here's<00:05:10.530> a<00:05:10.590> good

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:10.740 
match the beat on time and here's a good

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.450 
match the beat on time and here's a good
example<00:05:10.800> of<00:05:11.310> that<00:05:12.890> I'll<00:05:13.890> throw<00:05:14.160> it<00:05:14.280> off<00:05:14.430> a

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460 
example of that I'll throw it off a

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.870 
example of that I'll throw it off a
little<00:05:14.670> bit

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:16.880 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:22.360 

one<00:05:17.880> is<00:05:18.000> that<00:05:18.120> 1:26<00:05:18.900> the<00:05:19.110> others<00:05:19.320> at<00:05:19.470> 63<00:05:21.050> sync

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:22.370 
one is that 1:26 the others at 63 sync

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:31.280 
one is that 1:26 the others at 63 sync
and<00:05:23.370> now<00:05:24.120> it's<00:05:24.750> in<00:05:24.990> perfect<00:05:25.380> harmony<00:05:30.290> another

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:31.290 
and now it's in perfect harmony another

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:32.870 
and now it's in perfect harmony another
important<00:05:31.680> thing<00:05:31.770> to<00:05:31.830> remember<00:05:32.040> about<00:05:32.160> BPM<00:05:32.730> is

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:32.880 
important thing to remember about BPM is

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.730 
important thing to remember about BPM is
although<00:05:33.210> the<00:05:33.540> songs<00:05:33.810> who<00:05:34.050> analyze

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:34.740 
although the songs who analyze

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.610 
although the songs who analyze
automatically<00:05:35.700> when<00:05:35.940> you<00:05:36.030> first<00:05:36.620> connect

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:37.620

that<00:05:39.960> BPM<00:05:40.320> is<00:05:40.500> incorrect<00:05:41.010> you<00:05:41.310> have<00:05:41.340> the

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:41.610 
that BPM is incorrect you have the

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:45.040 
that BPM is incorrect you have the
ability<00:05:41.970> to<00:05:42.000> manually<00:05:42.780> tap<00:05:43.080> that<00:05:43.350> BPM<00:05:43.770> in<00:05:44.100> and

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.050 
ability to manually tap that BPM in and

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:48.530 
ability to manually tap that BPM in and
you'll<00:05:46.050> see<00:05:46.380> the<00:05:47.040> BPM<00:05:47.460> will<00:05:47.670> actually<00:05:48.180> change

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:48.540 
you'll see the BPM will actually change

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:55.580 
you'll see the BPM will actually change

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:36.240 
scroll through the songs and high-speed

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.780 
scroll through the songs and high-speed
large<00:06:36.570> portions<00:06:37.230> and<00:06:37.710> that<00:06:37.950> goes<00:06:38.130> forward<00:06:38.520> as

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:38.790 
large portions and that goes forward as

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:40.790 
large portions and that goes forward as
well<00:06:39.300> as<00:06:39.360> reverse<00:06:39.540> which<00:06:40.140> is<00:06:40.290> a<00:06:40.320> really<00:06:40.560> cool
