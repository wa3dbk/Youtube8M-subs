00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:19.800
 Hello everyone and welcome to this new one 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.919
 video dedicated to minecraft today we will go 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:27.900
 to see the new snap shots 14 04 

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:29.969
 a and 14 v0 4 b starting from this snap 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.680
 shot it is possible to craft of moves 

00:00:29.969 --> 00:00:34.170
 typical dungeon cobb hairston 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:38.790
 using the coop stone and the 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:40.590
 vice in the crafting table this snap 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.079
 shot introduces some important ones 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.969
 frame changes now if 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.620
 we place an object inside 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.690
 a frame that obviously attached to 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.730
 a block and to this block we put a 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.850
 comparator as you can see we can 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.410
 generate a rexton signal the news 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.010
 they are not finished because we can 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:01.760
 rotating this object is as you see the 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.530
 red stone signal increases in intensity 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.119
 you will have also noticed another novelty and 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.939
 that is, that the object within the 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:14.009
 frame can rotate in 8 positions 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:16.170
 several other novelties enough 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:18.750
 important of this snap shot and what time 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.180
 the buttons can be positioned 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.450
 also on the upper and lower face 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.780
 blocks and how you see them work 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.780
 perfectly 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.610
 this snap shot makes changes 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.880
 to the screen that appears by pressing the 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.690
 f3 key on the keyboard 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.990
 first in the middle of the screen 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:43.290
 the hicks ye axes are represented 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.420
 z with colored lines 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.880
 also the coordinates that indicate the 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.960
 direction we are looking at are 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.450
 written in bold 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.000
 this makes it much easier to understand 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.540
 in which direction we are turning 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.540
 our look 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.430
 the next news that we are going to see 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.470
 quite interesting indeed now it is 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.540
 possible to place the pumpkins or the 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.659
 skeletal heads with her with a 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.730
 dispenser to let you play 

00:02:08.659 --> 00:02:12.810
 automatically smog oled a was a golem 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.709
 and with her boss 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:18.090
 let's try then with the snow golem 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:21.239
 here you see who married 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.599
 instantly and now let's try iron 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.599
 golem 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.730
 compared to the previous snap shot is 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.250
 been taken a step back as far as 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.440
 regards the iron golem drops and gods 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.910
 zombie pygmies who are not killed 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.820
 directly from the player 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:40.820
 now in fact they come back to drop iron and 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:42.920
 however gold has been changed the way in 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:45.770
 where the number of ports is calculated 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:48.440
 in the villages making farms in fact 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:50.330
 quite useless iron was one 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.830
 very disputed choice that of 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.500
 remove the opportunity to use 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.840
 of the mazen iron farms reiterated 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.300
 who agrees that we can 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.400
 create automatic mechanisms but not 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:04.970
 that exploit bugs or strange behavior 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.470
 of the game in this snap shot was 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.450
 added an artificial intelligence 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.580
 to villagers like i 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:13.580
 peasants who can now gather 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:14.630
 wheat and carrot potatoes and replanting i 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.850
 seeds 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:19.100
 the player is able to recover the 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.940
 harvested only if it is very close to 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.040
 the balance 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:25.220
 in any case the inhabitants can do it 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:27.590
 exchange inhabitants in the same way 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.989
 they can craft and exchange bread 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:34.489
 I think that in the future they will be added 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:35.870
 other actions to other inhabitants in this 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:37.850
 new snap shot has been added 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.519
 particle command to generate 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:43.580
 particle effects the syntax la 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:45.560
 following slash particle followed by the name 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.720
 of the particle effect we want 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.730
 use in this case I chose 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.430
 the effect of lapilli produced by 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:54.709
 lava but we can use many others 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.360
 for example that of explosions i 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:58.820
 effects that appear when we take 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.890
 the potions the air bubbles and so on 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:02.959
 for a complete list of all 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:06.650
 effects go as well to consult the 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:09.620
 minecraft wiki the command is then followed 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:11.750
 from the three coordinates hicks yez that 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:14.560
 indicate the point where it will be applied 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:17.390
 the effect in this case I used 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.310
 tilde to indicate a coordinate 

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:22.820
 relative and therefore not a point well 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:25.760
 precise the following three values ​​indicate 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:29.060
 the size of the area we want 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:30.200
 that the particles are created follow 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.479
 then two more numbers 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:35.120
 the first indicates the speed with which 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:36.830
 the particles are created and second 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.450
 the quantity 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:41.270
 parameter allows us to apply 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:43.310
 the effect to any entity in 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:45.530
 this case I chose a wolf 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:47.600
 in this way the effect will also follow i 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:50.240
 animal movements 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:52.010
 let us therefore try the effect of 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:53.930
 this new command is here i have 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:56.950
 added a timer so that it comes 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:59.510
 continuously performed and as you see 

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:02.420
 all around the wolf 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:04.640
 these particle effects of lava 

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:07.460
 I must say that this will surely be 

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:10.910
 something that will be used by 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:12.710
 custom out creators starting from 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:16.870
 this snap shot small shrubs and 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:16.870
 dry bushes can catch fire 

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:21.770
 in this snap shot the spell of 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:24.050
 looting I remember allows 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:25.310
 recover more drops from the furniture 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:27.800
 now adds an additional advantage 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:30.700
 of one percent in recovering drop 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:32.860
 rare for every level of experience 

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:35.720
 the latest news I want to talk about 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:38.150
 it's about the skins I remember were 

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:40.850
 modified and improved in the previous one 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:43.010
 slapshot now the new layers of skin and 

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:43.910
 will also be visible in the in view 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:45.920
 first person 

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:48.170
 in practice on the arm of ours 

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:50.330
 player in this case you can't 

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:52.490
 note this new effect since the 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:55.280
 skinny I'm using is still in the 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:57.080
 old format well i think too 

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:57.680
 today we have reached the end of this 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.970
 video 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:01.730
 at this point I just have to 

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:03.530
 greet you and give you an appointment at 

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:06.250
 next video 

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:06.250
 hello everyone
