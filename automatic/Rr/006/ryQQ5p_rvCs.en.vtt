pockets<00:02:29.970> I<00:02:30.360> do<00:02:31.230> wish<00:02:31.560> they<00:02:31.769> were<00:02:31.830> pin<00:02:32.099> like

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
pockets but

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.040 
pockets but
they<00:02:34.430> still<00:02:34.700> get<00:02:34.790> the<00:02:34.880> job<00:02:35.060> done<00:02:35.090> and<00:02:35.630> they

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
they still get the job done and they

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:37.690 
they still get the job done and they
work<00:02:36.230> great<00:02:36.380> they're<00:02:37.069> really<00:02:37.250> well-made

really<00:02:38.060> thick<00:02:38.390> and<00:02:38.630> so<00:02:39.350> they're<00:02:39.530> probably

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
really thick and so they're probably

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.690 
really thick and so they're probably

only reason I'm not doing that a 10 out
of<00:06:55.410> 10<00:06:55.530> is<00:06:56.010> because<00:06:56.490> I<00:06:56.910> really<00:06:57.600> wish<00:06:57.780> there<00:06:57.960> was

00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:58.110 
of 10 is because I really wish there was

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:00.440 
of 10 is because I really wish there was
just<00:06:58.260> a<00:06:58.350> little<00:06:58.830> more<00:06:59.460> padding<00:06:59.940> in<00:07:00.090> this<00:07:00.210> thing

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:00.450 
just a little more padding in this thing

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:03.140 
just a little more padding in this thing
in<00:07:00.690> the<00:07:00.810> compartment<00:07:01.140> for<00:07:01.530> your<00:07:02.120> for<00:07:03.120> your

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:03.150 
in the compartment for your for your

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:05.270 
in the compartment for your for your
electronics<00:07:03.870> now<00:07:04.140> that<00:07:04.410> all<00:07:04.980> the<00:07:05.130> other

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:05.280 
electronics now that all the other

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:06.950 
electronics now that all the other
pockets<00:07:05.700> are<00:07:05.820> I<00:07:06.030> mean<00:07:06.180> everything<00:07:06.660> is<00:07:06.690> really

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:06.960 
pockets are I mean everything is really

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:10.970 
pockets are I mean everything is really
well<00:07:07.140> made<00:07:07.170> but<00:07:09.140> there<00:07:10.140> needs<00:07:10.320> to<00:07:10.560> be<00:07:10.590> some

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:10.980 
well made but there needs to be some

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:13.940 
well made but there needs to be some
more<00:07:11.250> dense<00:07:11.580> foam<00:07:12.480> and<00:07:12.840> thicker<00:07:13.350> foam<00:07:13.680> in

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:13.950 
more dense foam and thicker foam in

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:15.740 
more dense foam and thicker foam in
these<00:07:14.070> compartments<00:07:14.460> now<00:07:15.300> that<00:07:15.480> might

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:15.750 
these compartments now that might

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:17.450 
these compartments now that might
decrease<00:07:16.260> the<00:07:16.680> amount<00:07:16.770> of<00:07:17.040> stuff<00:07:17.250> you<00:07:17.430> can

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:17.460 
decrease the amount of stuff you can

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:19.580 
decrease the amount of stuff you can
carry<00:07:17.880> at<00:07:18.210> the<00:07:18.420> same<00:07:18.630> time<00:07:18.690> but<00:07:19.230> I<00:07:19.260> think<00:07:19.560> that

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:19.590 
carry at the same time but I think that

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:21.110 
carry at the same time but I think that
would<00:07:19.740> really<00:07:19.800> be<00:07:20.010> a<00:07:20.190> good<00:07:20.460> addition<00:07:20.580> for<00:07:20.910> the

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:21.120 
would really be a good addition for the

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:24.080 
would really be a good addition for the
back<00:07:21.300> pocket<00:07:21.750> also<00:07:22.740> if<00:07:22.890> I<00:07:23.010> can<00:07:23.190> see<00:07:23.400> one<00:07:23.910> more

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:24.090 
back pocket also if I can see one more

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:26.570 
back pocket also if I can see one more
thing<00:07:24.390> I<00:07:24.660> would<00:07:24.810> like<00:07:24.840> a<00:07:25.350> little<00:07:25.830> forward

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:26.580 
thing I would like a little forward

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:28.430 
thing I would like a little forward
right<00:07:26.820> here<00:07:27.090> I<00:07:27.210> know<00:07:27.270> some<00:07:27.600> bags<00:07:27.810> do<00:07:28.050> have<00:07:28.260> them

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:28.440 
right here I know some bags do have them

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:30.650 
right here I know some bags do have them
