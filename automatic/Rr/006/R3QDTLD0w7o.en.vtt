00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 welcome to another episode of picando 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.309
 flowers I am making flowers and the day of 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.730
 Today we will present a beautiful and tender 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.730
 diadem 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.510
 Y 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.510
 ah 

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:27.540
 what we are going to do is cover the 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.770
 headband so to line the I'm going to 

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:36.440
 cut all small pieces of ribbon 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:36.440
 which I will use the tips 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:43.760
 and I'm going to help with glue from 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:47.370
 hot silicone 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:50.390
 after forming the extremes we continue 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.390
 with a part 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:57.800
 diadem 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:01:01.660
 and I will go up to what 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:04.629
 I was completely lined 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.820
 can use the color ribbon that 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.360
 you want or material that you 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.650
 want 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:15.080
 I want this idea to be more 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:18.500
 or elegant 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:22.370
 so that the girl of the 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:24.960
 flowers or fourth of the comparsa that 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:27.900
 will accompany the bride 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.869
 in each round that I give with ribbon as 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:34.190
 a drop of glue to make the ribbon 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.190
 do not come back 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:43.020
 in this way we finish the lining of 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.900
 the headband once it is already formed 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.840
 that of addition will highlight a piece 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:51.900
 of cardboard which we are going to paint in 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:55.440
 tones of the flowers that we are going to use like this 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:58.140
 that they paint it pink and on this cardboard 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:02.060
 I'm going to do the floral detail that I'm going 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:06.200
 to hook on the headband 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:08.179
 and what I 'm going to do is create a flower 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:12.650
 different with the petals of the lilacs 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:17.090
 it's going to be like a double line and this 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:20.360
 flower we call it distorted 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:22.460
 so it's transforming a flower into 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.770
 other 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:28.780
 and I continue with everything for all 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:31.480
 surroundings all around 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:35.790
 of my circle 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.790
 following the shape with the petals 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:42.160
 I already made my first return now I'm going to 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:45.959
 make a softer return to the center and 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.959
 in the end I'm going to paste 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:53.370
 the second round so now we just 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.330
 remain 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.330
 he is not servile 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:03.240
 just enough 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:07.160
 its choir the thing 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:07.160
 put plenty of silicone 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:15.970
 same in the center 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:20.380
 let's wait for it to be a little 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:23.650
 and we place our flower 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:26.250
 I'm going to work with this beautiful sheet that 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:28.710
 give us all rosy ones called 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.930
 aspidistra 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:33.980
 I'm going to cut it 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:36.500
 to the size that I want it 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.740
 and I'm going to place it 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.880
 I make a side 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:43.880
 of the headband 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:46.250
 I will include other elements 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:49.330
 that will contrast well with what 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:49.330
 I'm doing 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:55.030
 and then the hunger 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:58.050
 with a soft wire 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.050
 and flexible 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:03.129
 to ensure 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.370
 the leaves and the elements that I just 

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:08.230
 put 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:11.010
 once I have the base 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:14.250
 Glue is being put 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:20.690
 since in this part is where I'm going to 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:20.690
 place my flower composed of lilly 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:29.550
 to finish our floral decoration 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:33.030
 list let's protect it with 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:35.340
 petal blocker this blocker of 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:38.460
 petals as I said at the beginning we 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:40.160
 will help the flower maintain its 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:44.000
 humidity 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:48.380
 and last us these eight hours that we want 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.849
 for our event so I always 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:55.840
 like to do things 

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:59.660
 different at the end and today I want to achieve it 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:02.720
 with a bit of wire to pearl 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:05.960
 This wire is very easy to get and 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:10.320
 well in many colors you will give 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:12.890
 enhance my decoration 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.890
 same 

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:17.570
