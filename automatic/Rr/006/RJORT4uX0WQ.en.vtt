I'm gonna go ahead and give my friend
the<00:02:15.010> go-ahead<00:02:15.250> to<00:02:15.519> start<00:02:18.870> so<00:02:19.870> also<00:02:20.260> what<00:02:20.650> I've

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
the go-ahead to start so also what I've

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:23.369 
the go-ahead to start so also what I've
done<00:02:20.860> is<00:02:21.010> I've<00:02:21.160> adjusted<00:02:21.280> the<00:02:21.790> ISO<00:02:22.450> to<00:02:23.019> as<00:02:23.170> low

00:02:23.369 --> 00:02:23.379 
done is I've adjusted the ISO to as low

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:26.160 
done is I've adjusted the ISO to as low
as<00:02:23.560> possible<00:02:23.590> and<00:02:24.310> increase<00:02:25.030> the<00:02:25.299> f-stop<00:02:25.780> to

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
as possible and increase the f-stop to

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.210 
as possible and increase the f-stop to
as<00:02:26.230> high<00:02:26.470> as<00:02:26.500> possible

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
as high as possible

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.449 
as high as possible
this<00:02:27.670> makes<00:02:27.910> the<00:02:28.120> camera<00:02:28.329> less<00:02:28.660> sensitive<00:02:29.140> to

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
this makes the camera less sensitive to

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.030 
this makes the camera less sensitive to
excess<00:02:30.459> light<00:02:30.750> go<00:02:31.750> out<00:02:32.140> see<00:02:32.530> what<00:02:32.650> you<00:02:32.680> can<00:02:32.890> do

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
excess light go out see what you can do

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:47.610 
excess light go out see what you can do
here

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.250 

that<00:02:48.620> looks<00:02:48.770> like<00:02:48.890> a<00:02:48.950> keeper
