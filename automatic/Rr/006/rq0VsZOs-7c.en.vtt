00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
so much that I've loaded it without

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.299 
so much that I've loaded it without
actually<00:00:12.630> checking<00:00:12.960> out<00:00:13.200> what<00:00:13.440> it<00:00:13.530> is<00:00:13.620> so<00:00:14.040> if

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
actually checking out what it is so if

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:15.350 
actually checking out what it is so if
you're<00:00:14.429> watching<00:00:14.580> this<00:00:14.849> video<00:00:15.150> which

you're watching this video which

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.000 
you're watching this video which

obviously you're not you can't hear me
then<00:00:17.160> I<00:00:17.190> obviously<00:00:17.609> like<00:00:17.970> the<00:00:18.210> mod<00:00:18.359> but

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
then I obviously like the mod but

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.570 
then I obviously like the mod but
there's<00:00:19.230> a<00:00:19.289> high<00:00:19.529> chance<00:00:19.560> I'm<00:00:20.100> filming<00:00:20.460> this

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
there's a high chance I'm filming this

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.980 
there's a high chance I'm filming this
and<00:00:20.820> I<00:00:20.880> might<00:00:21.090> not<00:00:21.210> put<00:00:21.390> it<00:00:21.480> out<00:00:21.539> depending<00:00:21.869> on

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
and I might not put it out depending on

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.870 
and I might not put it out depending on
what<00:00:22.080> the<00:00:22.170> mod<00:00:22.350> is<00:00:22.560> it's<00:00:22.949> called<00:00:23.189> 360<00:00:23.400> gold

people<00:00:24.150> I'm<00:00:24.420> going<00:00:24.660> to<00:00:24.720> assume<00:00:24.990> it's<00:00:25.260> a<00:00:25.350> 360

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859

mile<00:00:26.010> judging<00:00:26.310> by<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.460> name<00:00:26.640> and<00:00:26.849> yeah<00:00:27.689> so<00:00:28.019> it

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
mile judging by the name and yeah so it

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:29.960 
mile judging by the name and yeah so it

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
doesn't look any different to me it's

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.519 
doesn't look any different to me it's
down<00:00:30.090> to<00:00:30.210> me<00:00:30.269> to<00:00:30.390> try<00:00:30.480> and<00:00:30.630> work<00:00:30.750> out<00:00:30.840> what<00:00:31.349> is

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
down to me to try and work out what is

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.680

underwhelming yeah I should get the spin
right<00:06:10.170> so<00:06:10.410> that<00:06:10.560> they're<00:06:10.680> like<00:06:10.800> propellers

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:11.370 
right so that they're like propellers

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:12.860 
right so that they're like propellers
and<00:06:11.580> they<00:06:11.670> don't<00:06:11.850> act<00:06:12.060> propellers<00:06:12.660> not

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:12.870 
and they don't act propellers not

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:14.690 
and they don't act propellers not
propellers<00:06:13.470> prevails<00:06:14.190> and<00:06:14.340> they<00:06:14.430> actually

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:14.700 
propellers prevails and they actually

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:15.710 
propellers prevails and they actually
hit<00:06:14.820> each<00:06:14.910> other<00:06:15.030> I<00:06:15.150> don't<00:06:15.390> hit<00:06:15.510> each<00:06:15.630> other

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:15.720 
hit each other I don't hit each other

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:17.270 
hit each other I don't hit each other
that'd<00:06:15.960> be<00:06:16.080> awesome<00:06:16.170> so<00:06:16.560> I'll<00:06:16.860> make<00:06:16.950> the<00:06:17.070> grab

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:17.280
