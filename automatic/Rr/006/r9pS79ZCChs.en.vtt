00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:03.160
 Hello how 

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:04.189
 So this is it 

00:00:04.189 --> 00:00:06.850
 we will make a new gesture 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:10.940
 we could see proteste precedent that we improved the hacks since 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:12.249
 in the first tests 

00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:15.899
 I was 18 years old and we went from 24 beds to art is still 

00:00:15.899 --> 00:00:17.749
 quite consistent 

00:00:17.749 --> 00:00:21.119
 so this increase was not random because it's simply because 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.859
 that I cropped the electrolyser because before he was younger than the movie too 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:27.859
 strong that did not pass properly intensity 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.390
 so we had a lot of losses and so little gas 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.650
 so since we improved we saw that we learn 4 liters 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.840
 on the other hand our torch bus was 40 liters 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.050
 so it's not really suitable and so the flame and pop this bad 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.070
 so what am I going to do I'm going to cut the nozzle to have a good 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.350
 flames the problem is that I have no buzz rarely torch the only 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:52.950
 thing I had in two sub 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:57.000
 40 minutes is it syringe needle used in the first test 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 so in the netherlands we will start again alex was him to surrender 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.330
 so that the principals did not change the battery is the same good 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.980
 that the nozzle that changes 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.980
 dompierre I plug the battery 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.630
 I had the same newsletter 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.090
 it's absurd 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.090
 so we can see here the flame 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:23.860
 and I will 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.240
 heat 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:30.070
 melting this solder rod that is filler metal does not use in 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.070
 welding 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.500
 and we will realize that very quickly 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.300
 metal 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.420
 the flame is very small 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.430
 the mixture of water and oxygen and very powerful 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.790
 which allows me to melt steel as seen here 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:15.299
 here 

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:18.569
 see you soon
