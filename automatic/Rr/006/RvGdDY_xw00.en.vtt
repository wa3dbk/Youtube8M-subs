00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:41.500 
do alright guys so for some reason I
thought<00:05:40.190> that<00:05:40.340> the<00:05:40.550> gameplay<00:05:40.940> was<00:05:40.970> shorter

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:41.510 
thought that the gameplay was shorter

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:44.320 
thought that the gameplay was shorter
than<00:05:41.810> it<00:05:41.870> actually<00:05:42.110> was<00:05:42.680> so<00:05:43.520> I<00:05:43.580> cut<00:05:43.910> myself<00:05:44.030> off

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:44.330 
than it actually was so I cut myself off

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:46.360 
than it actually was so I cut myself off
40<00:05:44.750> seconds<00:05:45.140> short<00:05:45.260> so<00:05:45.560> this<00:05:45.860> is<00:05:46.010> just<00:05:46.130> gonna

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:46.370 
40 seconds short so this is just gonna

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:48.610 
40 seconds short so this is just gonna
sound<00:05:46.700> really<00:05:46.910> weird<00:05:47.060> whenever<00:05:47.510> I<00:05:47.930> put<00:05:48.470> this

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:48.620
