Motorsports bored-out throttle body and

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:17.240 
Motorsports bored-out throttle body and
reattach<00:00:13.559> the<00:00:14.990> cruise<00:00:15.990> control<00:00:16.020> I've<00:00:16.980> already

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
reattach the cruise control I've already

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.490 
reattach the cruise control I've already
taken<00:00:17.430> off<00:00:17.699> the<00:00:17.970> cruise<00:00:18.270> control<00:00:18.500> modulator

taken off the cruise control modulator
that<00:00:19.770> attaches<00:00:20.490> to<00:00:20.939> it<00:00:21.060> just<00:00:21.330> like<00:00:21.600> that

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:22.970 
that attaches to it just like that

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.689 
that attaches to it just like that
the<00:00:23.970> only<00:00:24.090> reason<00:00:24.570> at<00:00:24.960> least<00:00:25.019> mine<00:00:25.710> does<00:00:26.519> not

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
the only reason at least mine does not

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.109 
the only reason at least mine does not
work<00:00:26.939> is<00:00:27.689> because<00:00:28.109> there<00:00:28.289> is<00:00:28.320> nothing<00:00:28.619> to

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:29.119 
work is because there is nothing to

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:34.580 
work is because there is nothing to
catch<00:00:30.119> this<00:00:30.599> vacuum<00:00:32.930> grabber<00:00:33.930> so<00:00:34.290> when<00:00:34.500> you

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
catch this vacuum grabber so when you

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.049 
catch this vacuum grabber so when you
hit<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.860> cruise<00:00:35.130> this<00:00:35.460> thing<00:00:35.670> will<00:00:35.820> still

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
hit the cruise this thing will still

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.080 
hit the cruise this thing will still
grab<00:00:36.390> like<00:00:36.690> that<00:00:36.989> it'll<00:00:37.950> still<00:00:38.190> engage<00:00:38.640> but

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
grab like that it'll still engage but

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.729 
grab like that it'll still engage but
there's<00:00:39.329> nothing<00:00:39.690> that<00:00:39.840> it's<00:00:40.020> actually<00:00:40.379> press

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
there's nothing that it's actually press

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.410 
there's nothing that it's actually press
it<00:00:40.770> to<00:00:41.579> hold<00:00:42.059> it<00:00:42.239> to<00:00:43.460> hold<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.610> throttle<00:00:44.850> open

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
it to hold it to hold the throttle open

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.520 
it to hold it to hold the throttle open
so<00:00:46.020> we'll<00:00:46.260> just<00:00:46.440> come<00:00:46.649> back<00:00:46.680> down<00:00:48.260> on<00:00:49.260> the

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
so we'll just come back down on the

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.619 
so we'll just come back down on the
original<00:00:50.899> that's<00:00:51.899> this<00:00:52.199> right<00:00:52.500> here<00:00:53.329> and<00:00:54.329> grab

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
original that's this right here and grab

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.700 
original that's this right here and grab
the<00:00:54.930> throttle<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:56.190> hold<00:00:56.579> it<00:00:57.140> that<00:00:58.140> much<00:00:58.379> later

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
the throttle and hold it that much later

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.689 
the throttle and hold it that much later
holds<00:00:59.129> that<00:00:59.449> pushes<00:01:00.449> it<00:01:00.600> in<00:01:01.100> to<00:01:02.100> hold<00:01:02.520> your

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
holds that pushes it in to hold your

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.550 
holds that pushes it in to hold your
throttle<00:01:03.090> while<00:01:03.239> you're<00:01:03.390> at<00:01:03.480> cruise<00:01:06.560> what

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
throttle while you're at cruise what

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.950 
throttle while you're at cruise what
we're<00:01:07.710> gonna<00:01:07.799> do<00:01:08.070> is<00:01:08.460> cut<00:01:09.240> this<00:01:09.450> off<00:01:09.689> with<00:01:09.869> a

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
we're gonna do is cut this off with a

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.620 
we're gonna do is cut this off with a
dremel<00:01:10.320> tool<00:01:10.530> right<00:01:10.890> there<00:01:11.000> and<00:01:12.000> reattach<00:01:12.450> it

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
dremel tool right there and reattach it

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.399 
dremel tool right there and reattach it
on<00:01:12.720> here<00:01:13.020> because<00:01:13.200> it's<00:01:13.590> a<00:01:14.119> oblong<00:01:15.200> bolt<00:01:16.200> to

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
on here because it's a oblong bolt to

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.130 
on here because it's a oblong bolt to
stop<00:01:16.619> for<00:01:16.799> circle<00:01:17.280> circular<00:01:17.720> and<00:01:18.720> this<00:01:18.900> right

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
stop for circle circular and this right

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.920 
stop for circle circular and this right
here<00:01:19.470> will<00:01:20.220> fit<00:01:20.430> in<00:01:20.549> it<00:01:20.640> perfectly<00:01:21.150> and<00:01:21.600> hold

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
here will fit in it perfectly and hold

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.230 
here will fit in it perfectly and hold
it<00:01:22.080> in<00:01:22.140> place<00:01:22.320> even<00:01:22.979> though<00:01:23.280> we<00:01:23.970> don't<00:01:24.119> have

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
it in place even though we don't have

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.270 
it in place even though we don't have
all<00:01:24.360> these<00:01:24.479> additional<00:01:24.930> Springs<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:25.740> this

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280

part of the middle going back here and
grabbing<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:28.439> everything<00:01:28.770> we<00:01:28.890> don't<00:01:28.979> need<00:01:29.100> it

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
grabbing and everything we don't need it

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.249 
grabbing and everything we don't need it
it's<00:01:30.210> all<00:01:30.329> we<00:01:30.450> need<00:01:30.600> to<00:01:30.659> do<00:01:30.750> is<00:01:30.869> be<00:01:31.049> able<00:01:31.110> to

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
it's all we need to do is be able to

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.850 
it's all we need to do is be able to
turn<00:01:31.500> this<00:01:31.680> and<00:01:31.920> hold<00:01:32.100> it<00:01:32.220> and<00:01:33.619> spring<00:01:34.619> wise

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
turn this and hold it and spring wise

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.469 
turn this and hold it and spring wise
the<00:01:36.680> factory<00:01:37.680> ones<00:01:37.950> actually<00:01:38.460> got<00:01:39.299> a<00:01:39.329> little

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
the factory ones actually got a little

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.600 
the factory ones actually got a little
more<00:01:39.689> tension<00:01:40.110> on<00:01:40.200> it<00:01:40.350> than<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.650> fr<00:01:41.009> RM<00:01:41.340> so

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
more tension on it than the fr RM so

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.770 
more tension on it than the fr RM so
shouldn't<00:01:41.909> be<00:01:42.000> an<00:01:42.090> issue<00:01:42.649> so<00:01:44.149> yeah<00:01:45.149> we're

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
shouldn't be an issue so yeah we're

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.389 
shouldn't be an issue so yeah we're
gonna<00:01:45.869> go<00:01:46.110> ahead<00:01:46.200> and

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
gonna go ahead and

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.999 
gonna go ahead and
cut<00:01:47.939> this<00:01:48.119> off<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:48.719> attach<00:01:49.289> it<00:01:49.500> on<00:01:49.619> to<00:01:49.829> there

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
cut this off and attach it on to there

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.149 
cut this off and attach it on to there
and<00:01:50.130> put<00:01:50.340> anything<00:01:50.549> back<00:01:50.880> together<00:01:51.920> all<00:01:52.920> right

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
so we've now severed it completely the

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.469 
so we've now severed it completely the

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.020 
little patience you can get I'm a couple
of<00:02:00.630> Mets<00:02:01.069> I've<00:02:02.069> got<00:02:02.250> a<00:02:02.280> really<00:02:02.429> nice<00:02:02.640> dremel

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
of Mets I've got a really nice dremel

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.880 
of Mets I've got a really nice dremel
tool<00:02:03.210> that<00:02:03.840> where<00:02:03.990> I<00:02:04.020> pulled<00:02:04.289> this<00:02:04.439> off<00:02:04.679> it

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
tool that where I pulled this off it

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.580 
tool that where I pulled this off it
took<00:02:05.009> just<00:02:05.250> a<00:02:05.369> little<00:02:05.640> prong<00:02:05.909> but<00:02:06.390> it<00:02:07.380> came

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
took just a little prong but it came

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:14.720 
took just a little prong but it came
right<00:02:07.829> off<00:02:08.899> and<00:02:09.899> as<00:02:10.200> you<00:02:10.229> see<00:02:13.280> and<00:02:14.280> you<00:02:14.430> want<00:02:14.640> it

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
right off and as you see and you want it

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.449 
right off and as you see and you want it
good<00:02:15.000> and<00:02:15.480> close<00:02:15.810> cut<00:02:16.290> like<00:02:16.799> that<00:02:16.830> or<00:02:17.310> even

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
good and close cut like that or even

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:21.050 
good and close cut like that or even
closer<00:02:17.879> because<00:02:18.739> as<00:02:19.739> you'll<00:02:19.950> see<00:02:20.220> you<00:02:20.819> won't

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
closer because as you'll see you won't

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:29.509 
closer because as you'll see you won't
fit<00:02:21.390> otherwise<00:02:26.959> and<00:02:27.959> there<00:02:28.410> it<00:02:28.500> is<00:02:28.620> so<00:02:29.459> you

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:29.519 
fit otherwise and there it is so you

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:31.160 
fit otherwise and there it is so you
can't<00:02:29.760> have<00:02:29.849> any<00:02:30.060> turn<00:02:30.390> going<00:02:30.810> into<00:02:31.079> this

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
can't have any turn going into this

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.589 
can't have any turn going into this
black<00:02:31.530> right<00:02:31.829> here<00:02:31.950> cuz<00:02:32.129> it<00:02:32.280> fit<00:02:32.790> snug<00:02:33.180> like<00:02:33.450> it

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599 
black right here cuz it fit snug like it

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:36.530 
black right here cuz it fit snug like it
needs<00:02:33.780> to<00:02:34.489> and<00:02:35.489> we'll<00:02:35.760> go<00:02:35.879> ahead<00:02:36.120> and<00:02:36.269> get<00:02:36.420> this

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
needs to and we'll go ahead and get this

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.750 
needs to and we'll go ahead and get this
bolted<00:02:36.989> up<00:02:37.170> and<00:02:37.349> you<00:02:38.160> know<00:02:38.280> I'll<00:02:38.400> put<00:02:38.579> it<00:02:38.610> back

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
bolted up and you know I'll put it back

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:39.759 
bolted up and you know I'll put it back
together

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:39.769 
together

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:43.039 
together
alright<00:02:40.769> this<00:02:41.329> project<00:02:42.329> is<00:02:42.450> a<00:02:42.540> little<00:02:42.720> more

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:43.049 
alright this project is a little more

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:44.809 
alright this project is a little more
complicated<00:02:43.470> than<00:02:43.799> I<00:02:43.920> thought<00:02:43.950> it<00:02:44.310> was<00:02:44.430> I<00:02:44.700> mean

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
complicated than I thought it was I mean

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:47.150 
complicated than I thought it was I mean
it's<00:02:44.970> completely<00:02:45.209> doable<00:02:45.599> but<00:02:46.590> it's<00:02:46.709> just<00:02:46.890> a

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
it's completely doable but it's just a

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.440 
it's completely doable but it's just a
little<00:02:47.430> more<00:02:47.700> complicated

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
little more complicated

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:54.699 
little more complicated
yeah<00:02:49.099> in<00:02:50.099> order<00:02:50.220> to<00:02:50.489> get<00:02:50.670> the<00:02:50.940> length<00:02:51.480> for<00:02:52.410> the

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
yeah in order to get the length for the

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:57.410 
yeah in order to get the length for the
part<00:02:55.709> that<00:02:55.889> we're<00:02:56.010> adding<00:02:56.190> to<00:02:56.400> throttle<00:02:57.209> body

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
part that we're adding to throttle body

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.809 
part that we're adding to throttle body
we<00:02:58.170> have<00:02:58.290> to<00:02:58.440> cut<00:02:58.709> this<00:02:59.549> bolt<00:03:00.000> off<00:03:00.359> with<00:03:01.290> a<00:03:01.819> some

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819 
we have to cut this bolt off with a some

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:04.940 
we have to cut this bolt off with a some
kind<00:03:02.940> of<00:03:03.030> clean<00:03:03.299> cuts<00:03:04.109> you<00:03:04.410> can<00:03:04.530> thread<00:03:04.799> it

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
kind of clean cuts you can thread it

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.440 
kind of clean cuts you can thread it
into<00:03:05.099> a<00:03:05.280> bolt<00:03:05.730> nut<00:03:06.599> halfway<00:03:07.250> and<00:03:08.250> we<00:03:08.970> don't<00:03:09.150> use

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
into a bolt nut halfway and we don't use

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.210 
into a bolt nut halfway and we don't use
this<00:03:09.690> nut<00:03:09.959> as<00:03:10.200> a<00:03:10.230> joiner<00:03:10.650> piece<00:03:11.010> to<00:03:11.280> extend<00:03:11.880> the

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
this nut as a joiner piece to extend the

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:23.539 
this nut as a joiner piece to extend the
bolts<00:03:14.220> on<00:03:14.519> the<00:03:19.849> throttle<00:03:20.849> body<00:03:22.430> obviously<00:03:23.430> you

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
bolts on the throttle body obviously you

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:28.610 
bolts on the throttle body obviously you
want<00:03:23.819> to<00:03:24.019> try<00:03:25.019> and<00:03:25.169> get<00:03:25.260> as<00:03:25.380> many<00:03:27.200> lock<00:03:28.200> washers

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
want to try and get as many lock washers

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.009 
want to try and get as many lock washers
as<00:03:28.829> you<00:03:28.919> can<00:03:29.099> in<00:03:29.250> here<00:03:29.459> you<00:03:29.579> want<00:03:29.760> it<00:03:29.819> to<00:03:30.019> idea

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
as you can in here you want it to idea

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:32.420 
as you can in here you want it to idea
is<00:03:31.079> to<00:03:31.230> have<00:03:31.349> it<00:03:31.500> hold<00:03:31.739> tight<00:03:32.069> because<00:03:32.370> you

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
is to have it hold tight because you

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.250 
is to have it hold tight because you
don't<00:03:32.700> want<00:03:32.849> it<00:03:32.910> to<00:03:33.060> come<00:03:33.480> loose<00:03:33.750> on<00:03:34.049> you

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
don't want it to come loose on you

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.320 
don't want it to come loose on you
unexpectedly

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
unexpectedly

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.410 
unexpectedly
it<00:03:36.480> wouldn't<00:03:36.690> that<00:03:37.170> Romano<00:03:37.470> you<00:03:37.590> just

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
it wouldn't that Romano you just

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:44.510 
it wouldn't that Romano you just
over-rev<00:03:39.620> probably<00:03:40.620> out<00:03:40.770> and<00:03:41.450> you're<00:03:43.460> now<00:03:44.460> you

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:44.520 
over-rev probably out and you're now you

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:45.940 
over-rev probably out and you're now you
would<00:03:44.760> never<00:03:44.940> Rev

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
would never Rev

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.230 
would never Rev
you<00:03:46.950> would<00:03:47.100> never<00:03:47.250> rap<00:03:47.610> but<00:03:47.880> you<00:03:48.030> would<00:03:48.210> have

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:48.240 
you would never rap but you would have

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:52.070 
you would never rap but you would have
loose<00:03:49.020> power<00:03:49.920> steering<00:03:50.400> or<00:03:50.700> cruise<00:03:51.660> control

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
loose power steering or cruise control

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.320 
loose power steering or cruise control
you<00:03:52.890> just<00:03:52.920> idle<00:03:53.400> down<00:03:53.550> as<00:03:53.760> long<00:03:53.910> what<00:03:54.030> happen

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
you just idle down as long what happen

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.540 
you just idle down as long what happen
and<00:03:54.870> you'd<00:03:55.230> lose<00:03:55.440> your<00:03:55.500> bolts<00:03:56.100> and<00:03:56.340> stuff

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:56.550 
and you'd lose your bolts and stuff

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:00.710 
and you'd lose your bolts and stuff
probably<00:03:58.070> but<00:03:59.070> um<00:03:59.420> essentially<00:04:00.420> just<00:04:00.630> like

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
probably but um essentially just like

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.410 
probably but um essentially just like
that<00:04:01.080> spirit<00:04:01.830> on<00:04:02.070> we<00:04:02.670> want<00:04:02.880> it<00:04:02.940> to<00:04:03.060> obviously

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
that spirit on we want it to obviously

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.900 
that spirit on we want it to obviously
be<00:04:03.600> good<00:04:03.840> and<00:04:03.960> tight<00:04:04.230> and<00:04:04.470> it<00:04:04.670> straight<00:04:05.670> up<00:04:05.700> and

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
be good and tight and it straight up and

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:11.180 
be good and tight and it straight up and
down<00:04:06.350> angle<00:04:07.370> so<00:04:08.370> that<00:04:08.400> it<00:04:08.910> holds<00:04:09.090> this<00:04:10.190> piece

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
down angle so that it holds this piece

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.340 
down angle so that it holds this piece
in<00:04:11.460> here<00:04:11.670> in<00:04:11.850> the<00:04:12.030> proper<00:04:12.390> way<00:04:12.420> like<00:04:13.080> this

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 
in here in the proper way like this

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.800 
in here in the proper way like this
that's<00:04:14.100> why<00:04:14.280> it<00:04:14.340> needs<00:04:14.460> to<00:04:14.610> be<00:04:14.700> now<00:04:15.660> we're

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
that's why it needs to be now we're

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:18.800 
that's why it needs to be now we're
going<00:04:15.900> to<00:04:15.960> put<00:04:16.109> bolt<00:04:16.410> or<00:04:17.400> nut<00:04:17.459> on<00:04:17.940> this<00:04:18.269> side<00:04:18.600> of

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
going to put bolt or nut on this side of

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.570 
going to put bolt or nut on this side of
it<00:04:18.930> also<00:04:19.440> get<00:04:19.650> everything<00:04:19.920> good<00:04:20.130> and<00:04:20.310> tight

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.650 

alright<00:04:23.580> so<00:04:23.850> essentially<00:04:24.300> here's<00:04:24.540> the

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
alright so essentially here's the

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.070 
alright so essentially here's the
product<00:04:25.340> we<00:04:26.340> got<00:04:26.490> a<00:04:26.520> vault<00:04:26.730> behind<00:04:27.240> it<00:04:27.450> got<00:04:27.960> the

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
product we got a vault behind it got the

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:33.430 
product we got a vault behind it got the
extended<00:04:28.970> or<00:04:29.970> not<00:04:30.210> behind<00:04:30.630> it<00:04:32.030> extended<00:04:33.030> bolt

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
extended or not behind it extended bolt

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:38.110 
extended or not behind it extended bolt
got<00:04:34.440> the<00:04:34.620> piece<00:04:35.040> on<00:04:35.280> here<00:04:35.520> today<00:04:36.420> up<00:04:36.750> and<00:04:36.960> down

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
got the piece on here today up and down

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:42.500 
got the piece on here today up and down
angle<00:04:39.140> and<00:04:40.490> another<00:04:41.490> knot<00:04:41.730> on<00:04:41.970> the<00:04:42.090> end<00:04:42.120> of<00:04:42.360> it

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:42.510 
angle and another knot on the end of it

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:44.680 
angle and another knot on the end of it
and<00:04:42.660> as<00:04:42.750> you<00:04:42.870> can<00:04:43.020> see<00:04:43.080> it's<00:04:43.500> a<00:04:43.590> perfect

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:44.690 
and as you can see it's a perfect

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:48.320 
and as you can see it's a perfect
perfect<00:04:45.690> length<00:04:46.440> had<00:04:46.890> to<00:04:47.100> be<00:04:47.250> caught<00:04:47.580> by<00:04:48.300> that

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330 
perfect length had to be caught by that

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:49.730 
perfect length had to be caught by that
that<00:04:49.020> piece<00:04:49.230> right<00:04:49.260> there

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 
that piece right there

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:53.300 
that piece right there
what<00:04:50.490> it<00:04:50.580> works<00:04:50.790> is<00:04:51.090> this<00:04:51.960> vacuum<00:04:52.530> engages

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310 
what it works is this vacuum engages

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:56.480 
what it works is this vacuum engages
grabs<00:04:53.669> that<00:04:54.560> lifts<00:04:55.560> up<00:04:55.710> on<00:04:55.890> it<00:04:56.040> and<00:04:56.130> pushes
