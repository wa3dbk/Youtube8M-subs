going to have to rescind the Box to get
more<00:03:27.239> ammo<00:03:27.450> for<00:03:27.870> it<00:03:27.900> if<00:03:28.170> you<00:03:28.620> don't<00:03:28.830> want<00:03:29.010> to<00:03:29.130> go

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
more ammo for it if you don't want to go

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.250 
more ammo for it if you don't want to go
through<00:03:29.459> this<00:03:29.730> hassle<00:03:29.940> you<00:03:30.390> can<00:03:30.540> also<00:03:30.750> use<00:03:31.080> the

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
through this hassle you can also use the

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.890 
through this hassle you can also use the
m16<00:03:31.890> to<00:03:32.340> buy<00:03:32.489> up<00:03:32.640> enough<00:03:32.940> points<00:03:33.150> to<00:03:33.360> use<00:03:33.720> the

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
m16 to buy up enough points to use the

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.050 
m16 to buy up enough points to use the
traps<00:03:34.230> every<00:03:34.590> time<00:03:34.800> you<00:03:34.980> make<00:03:35.160> a<00:03:35.340> large<00:03:35.610> train

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
traps every time you make a large train

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.300 
traps every time you make a large train
this<00:03:36.480> is<00:03:36.690> also<00:03:36.870> a<00:03:37.019> viable<00:03:37.290> strategy<00:03:37.500> just<00:03:38.190> a

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
this is also a viable strategy just a

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.270 
this is also a viable strategy just a
bit<00:03:38.459> more<00:03:38.640> risky<00:03:39.060> and<00:03:39.269> time<00:03:39.720> consuming<00:03:40.290> as<00:03:40.470> for

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
bit more risky and time consuming as for

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.920 
bit more risky and time consuming as for
training<00:03:41.459> on<00:03:41.790> the<00:03:41.910> stage<00:03:42.180> there<00:03:42.540> are<00:03:42.660> three

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
training on the stage there are three

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.320 
training on the stage there are three
ways<00:03:43.170> you<00:03:43.470> can<00:03:43.650> do<00:03:43.830> it<00:03:44.010> the<00:03:44.400> first<00:03:44.700> one<00:03:44.940> is<00:03:45.120> off

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
ways you can do it the first one is off

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.030 
ways you can do it the first one is off
to<00:03:45.540> the<00:03:45.690> front<00:03:45.989> where<00:03:46.410> you<00:03:46.560> can<00:03:46.769> kind<00:03:46.980> of

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
to the front where you can kind of

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.890 
to the front where you can kind of
circle<00:03:47.400> around<00:03:47.519> up<00:03:47.880> and<00:03:48.060> down<00:03:48.180> the<00:03:48.360> stairs<00:03:48.660> and

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
circle around up and down the stairs and

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.840 
circle around up and down the stairs and
the<00:03:49.290> zombies<00:03:49.680> will<00:03:49.860> kind<00:03:50.100> of<00:03:50.160> be<00:03:50.280> jumping<00:03:50.700> up

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
the zombies will kind of be jumping up

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.030 
the zombies will kind of be jumping up
and<00:03:50.970> down<00:03:51.180> not<00:03:51.420> knowing<00:03:51.630> what<00:03:51.930> to<00:03:52.080> do<00:03:52.230> the

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
and down not knowing what to do the

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.699 
and down not knowing what to do the
second<00:03:53.459> way<00:03:53.610> is<00:03:53.820> on<00:03:54.330> the<00:03:54.360> podium<00:03:54.959> where<00:03:55.650> you

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
second way is on the podium where you

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:57.949 
second way is on the podium where you
can<00:03:55.860> jump<00:03:56.070> up<00:03:56.220> and<00:03:56.459> down<00:03:56.640> it<00:03:56.880> on<00:03:57.060> either<00:03:57.600> side

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
can jump up and down it on either side

00:03:57.959 --> 00:03:59.960 
can jump up and down it on either side
and<00:03:58.230> then<00:03:58.320> run<00:03:58.530> back<00:03:58.739> up<00:03:58.980> it<00:03:59.190> this<00:03:59.519> is<00:03:59.670> a<00:03:59.700> little

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
and then run back up it this is a little

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.870 
and then run back up it this is a little
riskier<00:04:00.390> and<00:04:00.570> will<00:04:00.690> be<00:04:00.810> a<00:04:00.840> lot<00:04:01.200> lot<00:04:01.590> faster<00:04:02.190> so

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
riskier and will be a lot lot faster so

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.310 
riskier and will be a lot lot faster so
if<00:04:03.000> you<00:04:03.090> know<00:04:03.299> what<00:04:03.420> you're<00:04:03.540> doing<00:04:03.930> go<00:04:04.170> with

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
if you know what you're doing go with

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.710 
if you know what you're doing go with
this<00:04:04.530> one<00:04:04.769> the<00:04:05.370> third<00:04:05.610> method<00:04:05.910> is<00:04:06.269> to<00:04:06.480> walk

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
this one the third method is to walk

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.110 
this one the third method is to walk
around<00:04:07.110> the<00:04:07.230> stage<00:04:07.500> as<00:04:07.739> a<00:04:07.799> whole<00:04:08.220> using<00:04:09.030> your

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
around the stage as a whole using your

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.030 
around the stage as a whole using your
Thunder<00:04:09.480> gun<00:04:09.630> to<00:04:09.750> clear<00:04:09.989> out<00:04:10.140> any<00:04:10.320> zombies<00:04:10.830> in

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
Thunder gun to clear out any zombies in

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.430 
Thunder gun to clear out any zombies in
front<00:04:11.430> of<00:04:11.519> you<00:04:11.670> this<00:04:12.209> takes<00:04:12.540> up<00:04:12.690> the<00:04:12.720> most<00:04:12.959> ammo

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
front of you this takes up the most ammo

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.490 
front of you this takes up the most ammo
and<00:04:13.650> also<00:04:14.400> the<00:04:14.610> most<00:04:14.760> time<00:04:15.150> but<00:04:15.630> is<00:04:15.750> by<00:04:15.959> far<00:04:16.320> the

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
and also the most time but is by far the

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.770 
and also the most time but is by far the
most<00:04:16.650> safe<00:04:17.160> so<00:04:17.669> if<00:04:17.760> you're<00:04:17.910> new<00:04:18.120> to<00:04:18.150> training

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
most safe so if you're new to training

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:20.629 
most safe so if you're new to training
or<00:04:18.930> a<00:04:19.049> kino<00:04:19.560> der<00:04:19.590> toten

then<00:04:20.789> make<00:04:21.209> sure<00:04:21.419> to<00:04:21.629> use<00:04:21.780> this<00:04:22.049> strategy<00:04:22.319> at

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
then make sure to use this strategy at

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.379 
then make sure to use this strategy at
first<00:04:22.919> and<00:04:23.159> work<00:04:23.400> your<00:04:23.580> way<00:04:23.699> up<00:04:23.729> to<00:04:23.999> the<00:04:24.090> others

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:24.389 
first and work your way up to the others

00:04:26.779 --> 00:04:26.789 
something else to be aware of is when

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:30.200 
something else to be aware of is when
dog<00:04:27.180> rounds<00:04:27.569> are<00:04:27.719> know<00:04:28.409> when<00:04:28.979> dog<00:04:29.610> weapons<00:04:30.029> are

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
dog rounds are know when dog weapons are

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.719 
dog rounds are know when dog weapons are
and<00:04:30.449> make<00:04:31.050> sure<00:04:31.349> that<00:04:31.620> you<00:04:31.740> don't<00:04:32.039> change<00:04:32.490> out

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:32.729 
and make sure that you don't change out

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:34.939 
and make sure that you don't change out
your<00:04:32.759> weapon<00:04:33.270> due<00:04:33.419> to<00:04:33.539> ammo<00:04:33.870> issues<00:04:34.289> before<00:04:34.919> a

00:04:39.589 --> 00:04:39.599 
get a max ammo every time so that's

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:42.110 
get a max ammo every time so that's
