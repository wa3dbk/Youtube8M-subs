00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:26.180 
drop-shotting and we've used it a number

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.240 
drop-shotting and we've used it a number
of<00:00:26.539> ways<00:00:26.869> on<00:00:27.140> a<00:00:27.199> number<00:00:27.589> of<00:00:27.619> techniques<00:00:28.039> and

of ways on a number of techniques and

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.269

depends<00:01:46.700> on<00:01:46.759> what<00:01:46.940> the<00:01:47.030> fish<00:01:47.209> are<00:01:47.360> doing<00:01:47.450> what

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
depends on what the fish are doing what

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:49.300 
depends on what the fish are doing what
I<00:01:48.170> tell<00:01:48.380> most<00:01:48.560> people<00:01:48.709> is<00:01:48.979> when<00:01:49.099> you're<00:01:49.220> gonna

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
I tell most people is when you're gonna

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.160 
I tell most people is when you're gonna
start<00:01:49.580> drop<00:01:49.789> shotting<00:01:50.060> experiment

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
start drop shotting experiment

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.680 
start drop shotting experiment
I<00:01:51.200> recommend<00:01:52.099> usually<00:01:52.459> 14<00:01:52.910> to<00:01:53.030> 16<00:01:53.300> inches

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:53.690 
I recommend usually 14 to 16 inches

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.809 
I recommend usually 14 to 16 inches
that's<00:01:53.869> a<00:01:53.959> starting<00:01:54.349> point<00:01:54.619> and<00:01:54.890> if<00:01:55.459> you<00:01:55.550> find

00:01:55.809 --> 00:01:55.819 
that's a starting point and if you find

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:57.190 
that's a starting point and if you find
that<00:01:55.879> as<00:01:56.179> you're<00:01:56.420> dropping<00:01:56.899> it<00:01:57.020> they're

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
that as you're dropping it they're

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.600 
that as you're dropping it they're
eating<00:01:57.470> the<00:01:57.560> bait<00:01:57.679> lower<00:01:57.920> the<00:01:58.069> bottom<00:01:58.250> you<00:01:58.459> can

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
eating the bait lower the bottom you can

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.520 
eating the bait lower the bottom you can
shorten<00:01:58.910> your<00:01:59.000> lead<00:01:59.239> or<00:01:59.869> sometimes<00:02:00.289> you'll

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
shorten your lead or sometimes you'll

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.290 
shorten your lead or sometimes you'll
see<00:02:00.709> the<00:02:00.800> fish<00:02:01.009> suspending<00:02:01.610> and<00:02:01.910> if<00:02:02.179> you're

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:02.300 
see the fish suspending and if you're

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:03.400 
see the fish suspending and if you're
marking<00:02:02.569> when<00:02:02.780> you're<00:02:02.899> graphing<00:02:03.140> they're

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:03.410 
marking when you're graphing they're

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:05.229 
marking when you're graphing they're
suspending<00:02:03.830> higher<00:02:04.009> up<00:02:04.220> you<00:02:04.429> can<00:02:04.970> make<00:02:05.119> the

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:05.239 
suspending higher up you can make the

00:02:05.239 --> 00:02:07.900 
suspending higher up you can make the
lead<00:02:05.390> longer<00:02:05.810> for<00:02:06.679> line<00:02:06.860> I<00:02:07.160> love<00:02:07.670> using

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:07.910 
lead longer for line I love using

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:09.550 
lead longer for line I love using
fluorocarbon<00:02:08.509> I<00:02:08.810> think<00:02:09.020> it's<00:02:09.140> the<00:02:09.319> most

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
fluorocarbon I think it's the most

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.740 
fluorocarbon I think it's the most
effective<00:02:10.160> technique<00:02:10.819> to<00:02:10.940> capture<00:02:11.270> but

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
effective technique to capture but

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:12.790 
effective technique to capture but
there's<00:02:11.900> a<00:02:11.959> number<00:02:12.200> of<00:02:12.290> ways<00:02:12.410> you<00:02:12.530> could<00:02:12.620> do<00:02:12.770> it

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
there's a number of ways you could do it

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.010 
there's a number of ways you could do it
I<00:02:13.069> use<00:02:13.489> an<00:02:13.640> 8<00:02:13.790> pound<00:02:13.970> mainline<00:02:14.450> fluorocarbon

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
I use an 8 pound mainline fluorocarbon

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.010 
I use an 8 pound mainline fluorocarbon
but<00:02:15.680> I'm<00:02:15.800> also<00:02:16.040> in<00:02:16.340> deep<00:02:16.489> water<00:02:16.819> or<00:02:17.390> in<00:02:17.690> windy

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
but I'm also in deep water or in windy

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.119 
but I'm also in deep water or in windy
conditions<00:02:18.050> where<00:02:18.650> you<00:02:18.709> need<00:02:18.860> that<00:02:18.980> little

00:02:19.119 --> 00:02:19.129 
conditions where you need that little

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:19.730 
conditions where you need that little
bit<00:02:19.310> of

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
bit of

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.830 
bit of
sensitivity<00:02:20.160> I<00:02:20.490> go<00:02:20.850> down<00:02:21.030> to<00:02:21.180> a<00:02:21.210> light<00:02:21.510> braid

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
sensitivity I go down to a light braid

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.840 
sensitivity I go down to a light braid
so<00:02:22.230> I'll<00:02:22.320> use<00:02:22.440> a<00:02:22.470> 10<00:02:22.770> pound<00:02:23.010> test<00:02:23.280> power<00:02:23.520> Pro

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
so I'll use a 10 pound test power Pro

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.670 
so I'll use a 10 pound test power Pro
and<00:02:24.090> then<00:02:24.480> I'll<00:02:24.600> tie<00:02:24.840> off<00:02:24.870> an<00:02:25.260> 8<00:02:25.440> pound

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
and then I'll tie off an 8 pound

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.800 
and then I'll tie off an 8 pound
fluorocarbon<00:02:26.070> leader<00:02:26.610> and<00:02:27.090> I'll<00:02:27.300> put<00:02:27.480> on<00:02:27.510> 10

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
fluorocarbon leader and I'll put on 10

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.960 
fluorocarbon leader and I'll put on 10
or<00:02:27.930> 12<00:02:28.140> feet<00:02:28.350> of<00:02:28.380> it<00:02:28.590> that<00:02:29.280> lets<00:02:29.430> me<00:02:29.610> get<00:02:29.790> that

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
or 12 feet of it that lets me get that

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.730 
or 12 feet of it that lets me get that
bait<00:02:30.180> down<00:02:30.210> stay<00:02:30.690> in<00:02:30.750> contact<00:02:31.080> have<00:02:31.590> that

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
bait down stay in contact have that

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.740 
bait down stay in contact have that
extra<00:02:32.130> sensitivity<00:02:32.850> especially<00:02:33.210> when<00:02:33.660> you're

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
extra sensitivity especially when you're

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.210 
extra sensitivity especially when you're
looking<00:02:33.960> for<00:02:34.170> transitions<00:02:34.740> in<00:02:34.830> the<00:02:34.920> bottom

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
looking for transitions in the bottom

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.670 
looking for transitions in the bottom
for<00:02:36.180> a<00:02:36.210> real<00:02:36.390> simple<00:02:36.720> spinning<00:02:37.170> reel<00:02:37.320> you<00:02:37.530> can

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
for a real simple spinning reel you can

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.500 
for a real simple spinning reel you can
also<00:02:37.830> do<00:02:38.100> this<00:02:38.250> technique<00:02:38.580> on<00:02:38.760> beat<00:02:38.970> caster

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
also do this technique on beat caster

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.960 
also do this technique on beat caster
and<00:02:39.690> the<00:02:40.620> real<00:02:40.770> trick<00:02:41.040> is<00:02:41.190> just<00:02:41.370> how<00:02:41.520> you<00:02:41.580> with

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
and the real trick is just how you with

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.120 
and the real trick is just how you with
the<00:02:42.060> bait<00:02:42.270> and<00:02:42.570> that's<00:02:43.080> the<00:02:43.350> biggest<00:02:43.590> part<00:02:43.920> it

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
the bait and that's the biggest part it

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.610 
the bait and that's the biggest part it
drops<00:02:44.370> on<00:02:44.580> them<00:02:45.080> the<00:02:46.080> first<00:02:46.320> thing<00:02:46.410> you're

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
drops on them the first thing you're

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:47.720 
drops on them the first thing you're
going<00:02:46.710> to<00:02:46.770> need<00:02:46.890> to<00:02:47.040> know<00:02:47.250> when<00:02:47.400> your<00:02:47.550> drop

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
going to need to know when your drop

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.340 
going to need to know when your drop
shotting<00:02:48.000> is<00:02:48.180> how<00:02:48.360> to<00:02:48.420> properly<00:02:48.900> tie<00:02:49.170> your

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
shotting is how to properly tie your

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:50.690 
shotting is how to properly tie your
hook<00:02:49.500> and<00:02:49.650> it's<00:02:49.770> a<00:02:49.800> fairly<00:02:50.010> simple<00:02:50.130> method

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
hook and it's a fairly simple method

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.360 
hook and it's a fairly simple method
we're<00:02:51.210> simply<00:02:51.480> using<00:02:51.510> a<00:02:51.810> Palomar<00:02:52.320> knot<00:02:52.380> you

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
we're simply using a Palomar knot you

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:54.830 
we're simply using a Palomar knot you
can<00:02:53.490> see<00:02:53.640> when<00:02:53.790> you<00:02:53.850> type<00:02:54.030> or<00:02:54.300> not<00:02:54.630> you

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
can see when you type or not you

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.990 
can see when you type or not you
basically<00:02:55.170> slip<00:02:55.440> your<00:02:55.590> line<00:02:55.710> through<00:02:56.040> you

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
basically slip your line through you

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000 
basically slip your line through you
coming<00:02:57.330> back<00:02:57.510> through<00:02:57.720> again<00:02:58.080> do<00:02:58.470> an<00:02:58.590> overhand

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
coming back through again do an overhand

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.520 
coming back through again do an overhand
loop<00:02:59.190> just<00:02:59.460> like<00:02:59.610> tying<00:02:59.820> your<00:02:59.970> shoes<00:03:00.290> okay<00:03:01.290> and

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
loop just like tying your shoes okay and

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.650 
loop just like tying your shoes okay and
then<00:03:01.650> the<00:03:02.190> trick<00:03:02.460> is<00:03:02.640> to<00:03:02.670> determine<00:03:03.180> how<00:03:03.480> long

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
then the trick is to determine how long

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.060 
then the trick is to determine how long
the<00:03:03.870> lead<00:03:04.050> you<00:03:04.200> want<00:03:04.410> is<00:03:04.530> how<00:03:04.680> long<00:03:04.890> you're

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
the lead you want is how long you're

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.280 
the lead you want is how long you're
gonna<00:03:05.160> pull<00:03:05.460> your<00:03:05.490> tag<00:03:05.820> in<00:03:06.030> through<00:03:06.300> and<00:03:07.110> then

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
gonna pull your tag in through and then

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.320 
gonna pull your tag in through and then
once<00:03:07.500> it<00:03:07.620> cinched<00:03:07.980> down<00:03:08.040> you<00:03:08.400> wet<00:03:08.580> it<00:03:08.610> you<00:03:09.150> take

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
once it cinched down you wet it you take

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:10.790 
once it cinched down you wet it you take
that<00:03:09.510> tag<00:03:09.720> end<00:03:09.870> and<00:03:10.050> slip<00:03:10.230> it<00:03:10.320> through<00:03:10.350> the<00:03:10.590> top

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
that tag end and slip it through the top

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.620
