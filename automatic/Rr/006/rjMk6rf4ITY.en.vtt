so basically I adhered my chip board to
my<00:00:57.449> mat<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:58.170> if<00:00:58.350> you<00:00:58.469> met<00:00:58.649> it's<00:00:58.829> not<00:00:58.859> sticky<00:00:59.399> I

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
hear it with some dotto glue and that

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.440 
hear it with some dotto glue and that
would<00:01:02.910> look<00:01:03.480> pretty<00:01:03.719> good<00:01:04.970> and<00:01:05.970> I'm<00:01:06.090> gonna<00:01:06.270> go

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
blade starts from here rather than from

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.410 
blade starts from here rather than from

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.749 
president's and then I'm going to set it
at<00:01:22.320> five<00:01:22.560> inches<00:01:24.950> okay<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.189> now<00:01:26.400> I'm<00:01:26.520> going<00:01:26.640> to

getting<00:02:10.440> around<00:02:10.739> those<00:02:11.039> tricky<00:02:11.940> edges<00:02:12.420> with

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
getting around those tricky edges with

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.250 
getting around those tricky edges with
your<00:02:13.140> scissors<00:02:13.790> and<00:02:14.790> it'll<00:02:15.510> cut<00:02:15.720> it<00:02:15.840> perfectly

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
your scissors and it'll cut it perfectly
