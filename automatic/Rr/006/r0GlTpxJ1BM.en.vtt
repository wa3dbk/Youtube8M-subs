demoted so you want to watch out for
that<00:00:43.370> you'll<00:00:44.370> find<00:00:44.610> that<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:44.940> maps<00:00:45.210> and<00:00:45.600> gun

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
that you'll find that the maps and gun

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.139 
that you'll find that the maps and gun
game<00:00:46.170> they<00:00:46.770> cut<00:00:47.039> off<00:00:47.190> certain<00:00:47.579> regions<00:00:47.969> on<00:00:48.120> the

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
game they cut off certain regions on the

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.760 
game they cut off certain regions on the
map<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.629> make<00:00:48.660> it<00:00:48.899> smaller<00:00:49.260> because<00:00:49.530> it<00:00:49.739> is

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
map to make it smaller because it is

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.860 
map to make it smaller because it is
essentially<00:00:50.640> a<00:00:50.670> six<00:00:51.000> person<00:00:51.239> free-for-all

with an objective type game-mode in this
particular<00:00:55.140> gameplay<00:00:55.710> I<00:00:56.640> start<00:00:57.120> off<00:00:57.239> pretty

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
particular gameplay I start off pretty

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.510 
particular gameplay I start off pretty
strong<00:00:57.899> progress<00:00:58.530> through<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:59.010> weapons<00:00:59.340> very

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
strong progress through the weapons very

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.380 
strong progress through the weapons very
quickly<00:00:59.969> however<00:01:00.870> when<00:01:01.859> I<00:01:01.890> get<00:01:02.129> to<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.609> rocket

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
quickly however when I get to the rocket

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.359 
quickly however when I get to the rocket
launchers<00:01:03.809> later<00:01:04.229> in<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.530> map<00:01:04.710> you'll<00:01:05.280> see

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
launchers later in the map you'll see

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.080 
launchers later in the map you'll see
pretty<00:01:06.119> much<00:01:06.210> like<00:01:06.540> an<00:01:06.659> epic<00:01:07.049> fail<00:01:07.320> on<00:01:08.310> those<00:01:08.939> I

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
pretty much like an epic fail on those I

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.310 
pretty much like an epic fail on those I
fast-forward<00:01:09.689> through<00:01:09.869> a<00:01:09.930> little<00:01:10.170> bit

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
fast-forward through a little bit

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.679 
fast-forward through a little bit
because<00:01:10.680> of<00:01:11.010> how<00:01:11.159> much<00:01:11.340> of<00:01:11.369> a<00:01:11.610> fail<00:01:11.820> I<00:01:11.850> did<00:01:12.240> you

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
because of how much of a fail I did you

little<00:02:49.820> scope<00:02:50.210> while<00:02:50.810> I<00:02:50.870> was<00:02:51.110> getting<00:02:51.260> shot<00:02:51.710> I

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
little scope while I was getting shot I

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.060 
little scope while I was getting shot I
thought<00:02:52.430> that<00:02:52.610> was<00:02:52.700> pretty<00:02:52.880> cool<00:02:53.860> not<00:02:54.860> really

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
thought that was pretty cool not really

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:56.860 
thought that was pretty cool not really
a<00:02:55.100> quick<00:02:55.310> scope<00:02:55.580> but<00:02:55.760> it<00:02:55.850> was<00:02:56.270> kind<00:02:56.480> of<00:02:56.540> a<00:02:56.630> slide

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
a quick scope but it was kind of a slide

a quick scope but it was kind of a slide
scope<00:02:57.170> I<00:02:57.320> guess<00:02:57.500> you<00:02:57.650> could<00:02:57.800> call<00:02:57.950> it<00:02:58.240> it<00:02:59.240> was<00:02:59.390> a

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
scope I guess you could call it it was a

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.150 
scope I guess you could call it it was a
little<00:02:59.630> quicker<00:02:59.930> than<00:03:00.200> a<00:03:00.260> hard<00:03:00.530> scope<00:03:00.860> though

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
little quicker than a hard scope though

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.750 
little quicker than a hard scope though

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:55.850 
always ends up a little bit shorter this

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:58.000 
always ends up a little bit shorter this
one<00:03:56.120> isn't<00:03:56.510> even<00:03:56.570> that<00:03:56.930> bad<00:03:57.140> it's<00:03:57.410> the<00:03:57.680> next

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
launcher that I really really fail at

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.670 
launcher that I really really fail at
and<00:04:01.280> that's<00:04:01.610> where<00:04:01.790> I<00:04:01.820> start<00:04:02.380> going<00:04:03.380> into

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
and that's where I start going into

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.590 
and that's where I start going into
super<00:04:04.160> fast<00:04:04.370> mode

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:05.600

progressing through right not so fast
and<00:04:18.880> I<00:04:19.880> think<00:04:20.450> right<00:04:20.750> around<00:04:21.020> here<00:04:21.530> I<00:04:21.739> realize

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
and I think right around here I realize

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:23.970 
and I think right around here I realize
it's<00:04:22.789> going<00:04:22.910> to<00:04:23.000> take<00:04:23.180> a<00:04:23.210> long<00:04:23.450> time<00:04:23.660> so

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:23.980 
it's going to take a long time so

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:25.830 
it's going to take a long time so
just<00:04:24.190> say<00:04:24.340> you<00:04:24.400> know<00:04:24.730> what<00:04:24.880> let's<00:04:25.150> let's

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
just say you know what let's let's

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.410 
just say you know what let's let's
fast-forward<00:04:26.170> through<00:04:26.500> this<00:04:26.620> and<00:04:27.490> this<00:04:28.210> was

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:28.420 
fast-forward through this and this was

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:30.930 
fast-forward through this and this was
done<00:04:28.570> in<00:04:28.630> theater<00:04:29.110> mode<00:04:29.400> so<00:04:30.400> you'll<00:04:30.580> see<00:04:30.760> in<00:04:30.850> a

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:30.940 
done in theater mode so you'll see in a

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.180 
done in theater mode so you'll see in a
second<00:04:31.330> where<00:04:31.480> I<00:04:31.840> thought<00:04:32.290> once<00:04:32.530> I<00:04:32.680> let<00:04:32.890> go<00:04:33.040> of

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 
second where I thought once I let go of

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.710 
second where I thought once I let go of
the<00:04:33.280> fast-forward<00:04:33.670> it<00:04:34.450> just<00:04:36.330> it<00:04:37.330> just<00:04:37.360> keeps

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720 
the fast-forward it just it just keeps

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.360 
the fast-forward it just it just keeps
playing<00:04:37.870> but<00:04:38.200> I<00:04:38.230> had<00:04:38.410> to<00:04:38.530> hit<00:04:38.680> a<00:04:38.860> real<00:04:39.160> quick

playing but I had to hit a real quick
but<00:04:40.060> this<00:04:40.180> is<00:04:40.330> what<00:04:40.510> you<00:04:40.600> can<00:04:40.720> do<00:04:40.840> in<00:04:40.960> theater

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:41.230 
but this is what you can do in theater

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:42.510 
but this is what you can do in theater
mode<00:04:41.260> you<00:04:41.470> can<00:04:41.590> fast-forward<00:04:41.890> through<00:04:42.280> stuff

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 
mode you can fast-forward through stuff

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.360 
mode you can fast-forward through stuff
you<00:04:42.700> can<00:04:42.850> pause<00:04:43.030> it<00:04:43.060> take<00:04:43.450> different<00:04:43.660> angles

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.370 
you can pause it take different angles

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.740 
you can pause it take different angles
what<00:04:45.370> I<00:04:45.400> should<00:04:45.730> have<00:04:45.760> done<00:04:45.970> on<00:04:46.150> the<00:04:46.270> crossbow

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 
is I should have taken a different angle

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.150 
is I should have taken a different angle
