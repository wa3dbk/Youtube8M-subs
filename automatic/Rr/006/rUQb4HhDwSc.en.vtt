 certain unpredictable future 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.360
 has an easy tendency to lie and 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.670
 hide as the true intentions 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.290
 of what he wants to do and that in fact he 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.420
 show consistent both in their 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.610
 values ​​the traces expressed by the 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.830

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.120

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.120
 it shows a bit of sense

 but annoying let's say as with the 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.640
 situation in which he lives or in which 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:07.229
 it's found 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.140
 and that takes it as a certain 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.580
 demotivation and that implies that the 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.930
 person presents as a low 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.269

 that low self-esteem may be in front 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:19.109
 to others it makes it a bit 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:21.599

 just like the scenario so I can 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.150
 understand and do not have how certain 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.980
 obstructions 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.840
 has focused on objectives that are more 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.870
 practical or they had to do with 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.250
 doing and with simple tasks that do not 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.769
 you have to complicate a lot

 entry to prison could be 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:58.489
 influenced by the moment but the 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.400
 most of the features of writing 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:04.060
