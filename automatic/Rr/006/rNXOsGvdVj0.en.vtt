 so we play the historic we're going to do 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:49.260
 come on come on come on let's see what we're going 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.090
 take a game to tell how 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.059
 considered that basically only here you 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:58.730
 they say that it contains nine dice and 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.730
 some rules of the game hey the box 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.500
 adn 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:14.380
 in the 92 with an icon an image and it 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.500
 he says that the cube is as simple as 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.270
 throw are the nine sides and then spun 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:23.170
 with it tells a story you can 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:24.940
 tell a person alone and if they play 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.530
 several people or tells you to do the 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:30.010
 same dice and that everyone counts their 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:33.010
 story with that same use in the post 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:34.270
 that people play and there is a 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:37.150
 against a story can be complicated 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.070
 re-roll the dice and link the 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:45.160
 story that has been left open with 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:45.490
 this case, well, we're not going to be bored 5 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.619
 min 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.960
 and also nacho thanks 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:52.270
 instructions that say that if I want 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.100
 play alone because you can record what 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:57.509
 you can write you can upload it to 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.509
 youtube you can make a channel 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.880
 yes 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:15.340
 well this was once a channel of 

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:17.439
 youtube in which the characters 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.439
 one had some little minions carrying 

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:22.390
 just peru and semi web and beautiful camera and 

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:25.689
 they were always with this face every time 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:30.090
 that pacheco told them guys there is a 

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:30.090
 new game that you have to open 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:38.069
 but I do not want to cause you much I want 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:39.870
 that you feel pressured or nothing but 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:41.489
 keep in mind that these videos what 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.340
 can see around the world and I know 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:46.530
 you do very badly is that you are going to lose 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.150
 subscribers and they're going to burn you over 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.569
 a little it can be that marbella 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.569
 cameras 

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:58.939
 from the upper chamber 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:05.220
 so the geeks in cars had 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:09.300
 an idea team it occurred to them that for 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:11.940
 deceive the wrath of pacheco should do 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:15.780
 the great video and for that they decided 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:20.360
 make a trip to the egyptian pyramid 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.360
 Boxing of the Tutankhamun sarcophagus 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:31.410
 so they went to Egypt to do it a 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.450
 balloon run instead of finding 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:44.160
 Well, to Tutankhamun, find some 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:46.490
 beetles that are and leave a skin 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:55.510
 tersa 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:58.720
 after the beetles 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.610
 down towards them like an arrow 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.049
 they followed them throughout the pyramid 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:04.480
 up down down upstairs with the sweetness 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:05.950
 of astÃ©rix and they could not only 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.120
 take off followed him on all sides 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:09.670
 and the cars geeks were saying 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.079
 my mother that we've gotten and 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:13.209
 cool European so that the one who is 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:15.190
 we come so we come with the taste 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:16.780
 that we were opening points at home and 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:20.019
 the beetles following it as a 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:21.880
 arrow all the way during and that that 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:24.400
 they were saying I do not know if this video 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:27.039
 will interest or not for such people 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.690
 but we will have more likes martÃ­ slide 

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:30.250
 because in the end it is what worried him 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:32.199
 to the core geeks and cars that are 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:35.910
 worried about the wrath of pacheco because 

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:35.910
 pacheco you do not know him but 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:40.670
 pacheco we do not start here 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:48.500
 also pacheco and has that magnet that 

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:55.590
 attracts people who are very majete in the 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:58.110
 background so our rich eights where 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.790
 I suffered that the party does not apply 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.530
 cars while they would be the beetles 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:03.240
 they decided to see what they had and I 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:06.210
 they took out all the tools and things 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.980
 and they created a magic a weirder magic 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:10.380
 a TV teleportation machine 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:13.410
 matter and created a bridge look if 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:16.110
 we created the node between a bridge in 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:18.690
 half the stream a bridge between 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:21.630
 Tutankhamun pyramid and underwear 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:25.550
 de pacheco opened the bridge and all 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:25.550
 the beetles were applicable 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:34.520
 and the platillas and then while I pacheco 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.520
 I was 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:42.629
 much all the vikings got 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:45.030
 pounds in the air of pacheco during 

00:05:42.629 --> 00:05:46.860
 quite a lot of years and that's why 

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:53.659
 we follow 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:53.659
 youtube wakes up 9 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:06:00.000
 is an example of how I imagine that 

00:05:57.479 --> 00:06:01.319
 you can also play well play 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.620
 have you can have more imagination 

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:07.169
 you can make more interesting stories 

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:10.379
 record them as the instructions say or 

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:13.319
 what the hell are you doing them? 

00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:15.479
 in your own room in doing it there are 

00:06:13.319 --> 00:06:18.319
 an interim the alienated people of 

00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:18.319
 possibilities 

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:22.740
 So nothing 

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:22.740
 bye
