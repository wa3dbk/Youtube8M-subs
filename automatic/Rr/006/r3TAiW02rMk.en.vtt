fine-grained<00:01:34.140> control<00:01:34.650> but<00:01:34.890> for<00:01:35.070> a<00:01:35.100> lot<00:01:35.220> of

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
fine-grained control but for a lot of

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
simple you can also do grab screenshots

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.340 
simple you can also do grab screenshots
of<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.430> video<00:02:05.969> so<00:02:06.299> for<00:02:06.479> example<00:02:06.810> if<00:02:06.899> I<00:02:06.990> wanted

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
of the video so for example if I wanted

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.680 
of the video so for example if I wanted
to<00:02:07.469> do<00:02:07.619> some<00:02:07.860> adding<00:02:08.640> on<00:02:08.879> this<00:02:09.090> particular

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
to do some adding on this particular

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.740 
to do some adding on this particular
clip<00:02:09.959> or<00:02:10.370> scrub<00:02:11.370> ahead<00:02:11.640> a<00:02:11.670> little<00:02:11.819> bit<00:02:11.940> you

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
clip or scrub ahead a little bit you

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.730 
clip or scrub ahead a little bit you
know<00:02:12.870> do<00:02:13.080> do

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
know do do

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:14.900 
know do do
if<00:02:13.770> you<00:02:13.920> want<00:02:14.130> you<00:02:14.250> can<00:02:14.370> do<00:02:14.460> that<00:02:14.640> which<00:02:14.790> is

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
if you want you can do that which is

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.880 
if you want you can do that which is
definitely<00:02:15.330> does<00:02:15.450> come<00:02:15.600> handy<00:02:15.900> sometimes<00:02:16.320> you

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
definitely does come handy sometimes you

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.910 
definitely does come handy sometimes you
make<00:02:17.010> titles<00:02:17.460> captions<00:02:18.090> credits<00:02:18.720> now<00:02:19.710> there

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
make titles captions credits now there

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.470 
make titles captions credits now there
are<00:02:19.980> a<00:02:20.010> couple<00:02:20.130> of<00:02:20.250> auto<00:02:20.520> themes<00:02:21.060> but

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
are a couple of auto themes but

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.880 
are a couple of auto themes but
particularly<00:02:22.260> I<00:02:22.290> don't<00:02:22.320> really<00:02:22.620> like<00:02:22.770> these

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
particularly I don't really like these

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.950 
particularly I don't really like these
most<00:02:23.190> of<00:02:23.280> this<00:02:23.370> stuff<00:02:23.670> you<00:02:24.360> can<00:02:24.540> do<00:02:24.690> a<00:02:24.720> little

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
most of this stuff you can do a little

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.330 
most of this stuff you can do a little
bit<00:02:25.050> better<00:02:25.170> if<00:02:25.380> you<00:02:25.470> just<00:02:25.500> do<00:02:25.920> it<00:02:26.040> manually

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
bit better if you just do it manually

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.830 
bit better if you just do it manually
but<00:02:26.640> of<00:02:26.760> course<00:02:26.970> there<00:02:27.120> are<00:02:27.450> a<00:02:27.510> few<00:02:27.690> things

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
but of course there are a few things

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.810 
but of course there are a few things
that<00:02:27.990> are<00:02:28.140> built<00:02:28.350> in<00:02:28.590> also<00:02:29.400> you<00:02:29.460> can<00:02:29.640> rotate

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
that are built in also you can rotate

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.240 
that are built in also you can rotate
and<00:02:30.390> whatnot<00:02:30.780> but<00:02:31.050> less<00:02:31.350> so<00:02:31.470> I<00:02:31.770> think<00:02:31.920> you<00:02:32.070> guys

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
and whatnot but less so I think you guys

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.890 
and whatnot but less so I think you guys
a<00:02:32.280> quick<00:02:32.550> little<00:02:32.610> example<00:02:33.270> of<00:02:33.300> how<00:02:33.480> I<00:02:33.510> did<00:02:33.780> this

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
a quick little example of how I did this

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.180 
a quick little example of how I did this
so<00:02:34.080> first<00:02:34.290> of<00:02:34.380> all<00:02:34.440> of<00:02:34.530> course<00:02:34.710> I<00:02:34.800> do<00:02:34.860> have<00:02:35.040> my

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
so first of all of course I do have my

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.070 
so first of all of course I do have my
music<00:02:35.250> if<00:02:35.700> I<00:02:35.820> open<00:02:36.360> up<00:02:36.390> the<00:02:36.510> music<00:02:36.840> tools

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
music if I open up the music tools

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.320 
music if I open up the music tools
dialog<00:02:37.590> there's<00:02:38.280> a<00:02:38.340> few<00:02:38.520> things<00:02:38.730> there's<00:02:39.120> fade

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
dialog there's a few things there's fade

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.780 
dialog there's a few things there's fade
in<00:02:39.480> and<00:02:39.600> out<00:02:39.780> which<00:02:40.110> not<00:02:40.890> again<00:02:41.220> nothing<00:02:41.730> is

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
in and out which not again nothing is

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.400 
in and out which not again nothing is
really<00:02:42.000> all<00:02:42.210> that<00:02:42.330> fine<00:02:42.630> grained<00:02:42.990> in<00:02:43.170> Live

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
really all that fine grained in Live

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:44.630 
really all that fine grained in Live
Movie<00:02:43.620> Maker<00:02:43.770> it's<00:02:44.100> pretty<00:02:44.280> much<00:02:44.400> it's<00:02:44.580> not

Movie Maker it's pretty much it's not

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.330 
Movie Maker it's pretty much it's not
like<00:02:44.880> I<00:02:45.150> want<00:02:45.660> it<00:02:45.780> to<00:02:45.990> fade<00:02:46.590> in<00:02:46.770> for<00:02:47.040> a<00:02:47.070> half<00:02:47.220> a

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
like I want it to fade in for a half a

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.320 
like I want it to fade in for a half a
second<00:02:47.580> don't<00:02:47.700> ever<00:02:47.730> know<00:02:47.940> it's<00:02:48.060> going<00:02:48.150> to<00:02:48.240> be

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
second don't ever know it's going to be

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.990 
second don't ever know it's going to be
slow<00:02:48.540> medium<00:02:48.720> or<00:02:48.960> fast<00:02:49.020> which<00:02:49.560> it'll<00:02:50.280> work<00:02:50.430> you

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
slow medium or fast which it'll work you

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.360 
slow medium or fast which it'll work you
also<00:02:51.150> do<00:02:51.630> the<00:02:51.660> music<00:02:52.260> volume<00:02:52.680> that<00:02:53.070> kind<00:02:53.310> of

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
also do the music volume that kind of

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.610 
also do the music volume that kind of
thing<00:02:53.580> as<00:02:54.330> far<00:02:54.540> as<00:02:54.660> this<00:02:54.780> goes<00:02:54.900> now<00:02:55.230> one<00:02:55.440> of<00:02:55.530> the

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
thing as far as this goes now one of the

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.410 
thing as far as this goes now one of the
big<00:02:55.800> things<00:02:56.070> about<00:02:56.280> video<00:02:56.640> editing<00:02:56.850> just<00:02:57.240> in

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
big things about video editing just in

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.240 
big things about video editing just in
general<00:02:57.900> but<00:02:58.020> especially<00:02:58.260> when<00:02:58.620> you're<00:02:58.770> using

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
general but especially when you're using

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:00.500 
general but especially when you're using
something<00:02:59.400> that's<00:02:59.700> not<00:03:00.060> particularly

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
something that's not particularly

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.410 
something that's not particularly
high-end<00:03:01.200> is<00:03:01.410> be<00:03:02.220> creative<00:03:02.490> you<00:03:03.000> learn<00:03:03.210> how<00:03:03.390> to

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
high-end is be creative you learn how to

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.690 
high-end is be creative you learn how to
improvise<00:03:03.780> so<00:03:04.350> for<00:03:04.980> example<00:03:05.280> with<00:03:05.400> this<00:03:05.550> I

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
improvise so for example with this I

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.270 
improvise so for example with this I
wanted<00:03:05.880> to<00:03:05.940> do<00:03:06.060> a<00:03:06.090> nice<00:03:06.480> long<00:03:06.930> fade<00:03:07.410> in<00:03:07.680> you

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
wanted to do a nice long fade in you

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.470 
wanted to do a nice long fade in you
know<00:03:08.370> I<00:03:08.400> don't<00:03:08.700> want<00:03:08.820> to<00:03:08.850> just<00:03:09.030> jump<00:03:09.120> straight

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
know I don't want to just jump straight

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.060 
know I don't want to just jump straight
into<00:03:09.840> the<00:03:09.960> video<00:03:10.080> so<00:03:10.470> what<00:03:10.560> I<00:03:10.620> did<00:03:10.740> was<00:03:10.830> I<00:03:10.920> just

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
into the video so what I did was I just

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:14.240 
into the video so what I did was I just
grabbed<00:03:11.310> a<00:03:11.690> generic<00:03:12.690> black<00:03:13.100> background<00:03:14.100> is

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
grabbed a generic black background is

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.250 
grabbed a generic black background is
just<00:03:14.280> you<00:03:14.550> know<00:03:14.640> they<00:03:14.910> leave<00:03:15.210> 1280<00:03:15.750> by<00:03:15.930> 720

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
just you know they leave 1280 by 720

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.160 
just you know they leave 1280 by 720
just<00:03:17.010> all<00:03:17.160> black<00:03:17.670> and<00:03:18.000> just<00:03:18.360> use<00:03:18.600> it<00:03:18.780> for<00:03:18.810> the

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
just all black and just use it for the

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:20.690 
just all black and just use it for the
video<00:03:19.380> and<00:03:19.650> just<00:03:19.680> I<00:03:19.950> believe<00:03:20.220> what<00:03:20.400> I<00:03:20.430> do<00:03:20.550> it

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
video and just I believe what I do it

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.880 
video and just I believe what I do it
for<00:03:20.910> here<00:03:21.120> I'd<00:03:21.570> like<00:03:21.810> nine<00:03:22.050> seconds<00:03:22.620> and<00:03:22.800> then

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
for here I'd like nine seconds and then

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.680 
for here I'd like nine seconds and then
kind<00:03:23.130> of<00:03:23.160> have<00:03:23.280> it<00:03:23.370> fade<00:03:23.580> in<00:03:23.820> so<00:03:24.120> I<00:03:24.300> mean<00:03:24.570> there

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
kind of have it fade in so I mean there

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
kind of have it fade in so I mean there
are<00:03:24.720> different<00:03:25.020> things<00:03:25.110> you<00:03:25.290> can<00:03:25.410> do<00:03:25.530> with

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:25.710 
are different things you can do with

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:27.110 
are different things you can do with
just<00:03:25.920> straight<00:03:26.130> images<00:03:26.640> and<00:03:26.760> that's<00:03:26.880> kind<00:03:27.090> of

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
just straight images and that's kind of

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.610 
just straight images and that's kind of
something<00:03:27.270> you'll<00:03:27.510> learn<00:03:27.720> slowly<00:03:28.020> I<00:03:28.320> mean<00:03:28.470> if

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 
something like blur so for example if I

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.950 
something like blur so for example if I
wanted<00:04:51.070> to<00:04:51.220> make<00:04:51.430> it<00:04:51.580> all<00:04:51.700> out<00:04:51.940> of<00:04:51.970> focus<00:04:52.300> put

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960 
wanted to make it all out of focus put

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.300 
wanted to make it all out of focus put
some<00:04:53.110> text<00:04:53.290> here<00:04:53.560> kind<00:04:53.770> of<00:04:53.830> draw<00:04:54.010> your<00:04:54.190> focus

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.310 
some text here kind of draw your focus

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.010 
some text here kind of draw your focus
to<00:04:54.610> the<00:04:54.730> text<00:04:55.090> instead<00:04:55.450> of<00:04:55.570> the<00:04:55.660> video<00:04:55.870> behind

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
to the text instead of the video behind

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.050 
to the text instead of the video behind
I<00:04:56.320> could<00:04:56.440> do<00:04:56.530> that<00:04:56.710> there<00:04:57.430> also<00:04:57.580> some<00:04:57.850> kind<00:04:58.030> of

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.060 
I could do that there also some kind of

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.270 
I could do that there also some kind of
crazier<00:04:58.450> ones<00:04:58.630> like<00:04:58.780> edge<00:04:58.990> detection<00:04:59.410> and<00:05:00.220> you

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:00.280 
crazier ones like edge detection and you

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:01.560 
crazier ones like edge detection and you
do<00:05:00.430> want<00:05:00.700> to<00:05:00.790> come<00:05:01.000> makes<00:05:01.210> it<00:05:01.330> look<00:05:01.480> a<00:05:01.510> little

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:01.570 
do want to come makes it look a little

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:03.510 
do want to come makes it look a little
bit<00:05:01.750> like<00:05:01.780> an<00:05:01.990> oil<00:05:02.230> painting<00:05:02.800> I<00:05:03.100> mean<00:05:03.370> there

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 
bit like an oil painting I mean there

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.010 
bit like an oil painting I mean there
are<00:05:03.640> some<00:05:03.790> decent<00:05:03.970> effects<00:05:04.360> in<00:05:04.480> here<00:05:04.600> I<00:05:04.660> will

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:05.020 
are some decent effects in here I will

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:07.020 
are some decent effects in here I will
admit<00:05:05.260> me<00:05:05.410> you<00:05:05.710> know<00:05:05.800> certainly<00:05:06.430> some<00:05:06.760> things

admit me you know certainly some things
that<00:05:07.180> you<00:05:07.300> can<00:05:07.450> definitely<00:05:07.600> use<00:05:08.260> and<00:05:08.770> you<00:05:08.830> know

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:08.890 
that you can definitely use and you know

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:10.050 
that you can definitely use and you know
there<00:05:09.070> are<00:05:09.100> also<00:05:09.250> some<00:05:09.550> standard<00:05:09.820> ones<00:05:09.970> like

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:10.060 
there are also some standard ones like

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:11.220 
there are also some standard ones like
black<00:05:10.270> and<00:05:10.300> white<00:05:10.600> with<00:05:10.930> a<00:05:10.960> little<00:05:10.990> bit

filters and whatnot
you<00:05:13.180> can<00:05:13.300> also<00:05:13.419> do<00:05:13.600> some<00:05:13.780> different<00:05:13.930> things

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:14.169 
you can also do some different things

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:16.710 
you can also do some different things
like<00:05:14.380> flip<00:05:14.650> it<00:05:14.770> upside<00:05:15.040> down<00:05:15.070> or<00:05:15.880> add<00:05:16.030> like

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:16.720 
like flip it upside down or add like

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.510 
like flip it upside down or add like
effects<00:05:17.200> on<00:05:17.320> the<00:05:17.470> side<00:05:17.710> of<00:05:17.740> it<00:05:18.070> I<00:05:18.100> mean<00:05:18.340> you

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:18.520 
effects on the side of it I mean you

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.730 
effects on the side of it I mean you
know<00:05:18.610> if<00:05:18.790> you<00:05:18.820> can<00:05:19.210> do<00:05:19.390> some<00:05:19.660> things<00:05:19.690> for<00:05:20.680> the

know if you can do some things for the

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.230 
know if you can do some things for the
most<00:05:20.890> part<00:05:21.130> though<00:05:21.310> you<00:05:21.850> know<00:05:21.940> you're<00:05:22.120> going

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:22.240 
most part though you know you're going

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:25.240 
like this you know it's not really

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:26.550 
like this you know it's not really
something<00:05:25.870> you're<00:05:25.930> going<00:05:26.050> to<00:05:26.110> want<00:05:26.290> to<00:05:26.320> do<00:05:26.440> on

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.110 
something you're going to want to do on
most<00:05:26.800> videos<00:05:27.250> but<00:05:27.550> if<00:05:27.610> you<00:05:27.700> want<00:05:27.850> to<00:05:27.940> kind<00:05:28.030> of

most videos but if you want to kind of

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:29.129 
most videos but if you want to kind of
have<00:05:28.270> a<00:05:28.300> little<00:05:28.419> fun<00:05:28.630> with<00:05:28.750> it<00:05:28.810> you<00:05:28.930> certainly

you guys are probably tell by now movie
maker<00:05:34.330> actually<00:05:34.690> is<00:05:34.750> pretty<00:05:34.960> decent<00:05:35.080> as<00:05:35.290> far

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:35.530 
maker actually is pretty decent as far

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:37.230 
maker actually is pretty decent as far
as<00:05:35.650> how<00:05:35.740> the<00:05:35.800> effects<00:05:36.160> go<00:05:36.370> and<00:05:36.550> this<00:05:36.700> works<00:05:37.090> the

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:37.240 
as how the effects go and this works the

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.420 
as how the effects go and this works the
same<00:05:37.390> way<00:05:37.570> for<00:05:37.780> animations<00:05:38.320> and<00:05:38.470> whatnot<00:05:38.770> all

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:39.430 
same way for animations and whatnot all

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:40.950 
same way for animations and whatnot all
you<00:05:39.610> do<00:05:39.790> is<00:05:39.880> just<00:05:40.030> hover<00:05:40.210> over<00:05:40.300> to<00:05:40.660> find<00:05:40.900> the

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:45.130 
even if you don't have that particularly

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:47.040 
even if you don't have that particularly
great<00:05:45.370> of<00:05:45.460> a<00:05:45.520> computer<00:05:45.910> it's<00:05:46.630> typically

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:47.050 
great of a computer it's typically

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:48.779 
great of a computer it's typically
pretty<00:05:47.289> good<00:05:47.500> so<00:05:47.710> if<00:05:47.979> you<00:05:48.070> want<00:05:48.250> to<00:05:48.310> test

00:05:48.779 --> 00:05:48.789 
pretty good so if you want to test

00:05:48.789 --> 00:05:49.440 
pretty good so if you want to test
something<00:05:48.970> out

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:49.450 
something out

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:51.270 
something out
Staffing<00:05:49.990> to<00:05:50.080> drag<00:05:50.320> it<00:05:50.500> and<00:05:50.590> sometimes<00:05:50.740> rig

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:51.280 
Staffing to drag it and sometimes rig

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:53.969 
Staffing to drag it and sometimes rig
like<00:05:51.490> on<00:05:51.700> other<00:05:52.350> software<00:05:53.350> you<00:05:53.470> can<00:05:53.590> just<00:05:53.740> drag

00:05:53.969 --> 00:05:53.979 
like on other software you can just drag

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:55.770 
like on other software you can just drag
it<00:05:54.160> or<00:05:54.340> just<00:05:54.490> hover<00:05:54.729> over<00:05:54.820> rather<00:05:55.210> in<00:05:55.479> or<00:05:55.750> just

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:55.780 
it or just hover over rather in or just

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:57.690 
it or just hover over rather in or just
fine<00:05:56.260> you<00:05:56.979> also<00:05:57.100> do<00:05:57.310> have<00:05:57.340> a<00:05:57.490> brightness

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:57.700 
fine you also do have a brightness

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:59.880 
fine you also do have a brightness
control<00:05:58.180> so<00:05:58.570> you<00:05:59.020> know<00:05:59.110> it's<00:05:59.289> not<00:05:59.440> bad<00:05:59.650> you're

00:05:59.880 --> 00:05:59.890 
control so you know it's not bad you're

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:00.840 
control so you know it's not bad you're
definitely<00:06:00.010> not<00:06:00.250> going<00:06:00.340> to<00:06:00.430> be<00:06:00.520> able<00:06:00.610> to<00:06:00.760> do

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:00.850 
definitely not going to be able to do

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:03.210 
definitely not going to be able to do
full<00:06:01.120> color<00:06:01.390> correction<00:06:01.840> but<00:06:02.169> if<00:06:02.890> you<00:06:03.010> want<00:06:03.160> to

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:03.220 
full color correction but if you want to

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:04.260 
full color correction but if you want to
turn<00:06:03.310> the<00:06:03.400> brightness<00:06:03.550> down<00:06:03.700> a<00:06:03.880> little<00:06:04.030> bit<00:06:04.150> or

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:04.270 
turn the brightness down a little bit or

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:05.969 
turn the brightness down a little bit or
up<00:06:04.419> you<00:06:04.570> can<00:06:04.720> certainly<00:06:04.900> do<00:06:05.229> that<00:06:05.500> and<00:06:05.770> the

00:06:05.969 --> 00:06:05.979 
up you can certainly do that and the
