00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:19.300
 hello total photoshop friends 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:21.300
 let's talk about still life and in 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:24.910
 this case we talk about a click 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:29.109
 quite a particular silhouette of 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:32.470
 glass then try to outline the 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:34.920
 shape of the glass of the glasses 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:37.390
 as you see in this shot ok 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:41.020
 photographing glasses is not easy it is not 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:42.280
 easy because they are reflective and in addition to 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:46.030
 being reflective are also 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:48.879
 transparent and put a little in crisis the 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.400
 positioning of the lights so me it 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:53.220
 ask often 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:56.580
 tips on how to take glasses 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:58.350
 glass bottles and I really wanted to 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:00.690
 let you see why directly 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.910
 it becomes difficult to maybe give you some 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.600
 answers when you write to me on facebook 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:09.260
 or by email so I wanted to show you 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.510
 how to set a shot starting 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:15.270
 from the beginning how it would be automatic 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.040
 illuminate it and then show you which ones 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.770
 are the problems to see later 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:23.070
 instead what is the correct approach from 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.840
 use the light scheme because the 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:29.060
 the most important thing is the positioning 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:33.390
 of the lights then we leave 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:36.240
 the set is ready we can see it 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:41.790
 behind me are glasses 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:45.300
 voids resting on black plexiglass that 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.950
 will create a reflection below and the approach 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.140
 initial is to say ok light up 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.330
 the in the standard way which is the 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.970
 marinas standard way this study is 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:57.090
 illuminate it with two side lights then 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.310
 a main light or a light of 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.350
 lightened or may even be two 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.630
 lights in this case if we want the 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.430
 symmetry of the lighting of the 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.459
 silhouette can also be two lights 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.080
 equal exactly equal positioned in 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.380
 symmetrical manner a respect 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.410
 to the other with the same power but me 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.400
 I immediately realize that I have problems 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.189
 then 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.769
 as I want a silhouette the bottom e 

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:25.829
 black for which I positioned there is one 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:27.689
 black background put in the distance that not 

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:30.620
 therefore it is illuminated by light 

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:35.730
 it will remain a full black and I have my two 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:39.150
 so positioned banks and I can do the 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:42.599
 first click I take the first shot e 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:45.930
 i see what i get ok i get a 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:48.950
 result that ok is not bad but it is not 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:52.250
 what I wanted because 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:55.640
 there is a bit of confusion there are 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:59.360
 bands of light that are in practice is the 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:04.340
 reflection of the bank entering me 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:06.410
 on the glass and therefore not to the effect 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:10.310
 silhouette that makes me see exactly 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:13.160
 the shape or reflection is ok I see it 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:16.340
 however it is not pleasant to look at this 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:18.110
 this part what I would be brought to 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.660
 think to say ok if i want the 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:23.349
 silhouette I want this light here 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:26.060
 go down and outline all of me 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:28.819
 glass so I can try to 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.230
 move it in this case it is positioned 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:33.069
 high enough 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:38.269
 I can try to lower it then if I do 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:41.239
 near there being seen to be ok 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:45.920
 I put it here even arrived at 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:50.799
 place it near the base 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.799
 supportive and I can take the shot 

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:56.230
 ok let's see what happens 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.079
 ok i couldn't get that 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:03.019
 that I wanted then first of all I am 

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:03.650
 approached and increased a lot 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:05.239
 light 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.940
 always remember I repeated it already 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:09.920
 often times it is just important 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:15.019
 move a light you will have to correct the 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:15.829
 the power because the light behaves to the 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:18.660
 square 

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:21.360
 what it means means that if me 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:24.120
 doubling the light from a distance to the subject 

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:27.680
 it is not halved but becomes a quarter 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:31.590
 it is logically if I get near there 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:35.130
 if the distance is one meter and I go to 50 cm 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:38.040
 it increases by two stops so it doesn't double 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:39.030
 but it becomes twice because 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:41.580
 think squared 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:43.500
 apart from this premise on the speech 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.820
 of the power of light are not 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:49.710
 managed to get what I wanted 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:51.990
 because in the previous shot ne 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:55.950
 the light came up to here I want 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:57.570
 but unfortunately I can not go under it 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:59.190
 more than that I can't go because I 

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:02.490
 I want to illuminate this part here as 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:03.990
 I would like to lower the bank 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:06.630
 but lower than this I can't because 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:09.750
 they are already on the surface then 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:11.370
 we could fight a lot with this 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:13.290
 set and that's what happens when you 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:15.690
 write later maybe you see are hours that 

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:18.350
 I'm going crazy with the lights but does not 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:20.960
 I come to the head because it is not the scheme 

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:23.040
 correct to photograph the glass 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:26.730
 just because the glass a 

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:27.450
 a roundness and reflects all that 

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:30.150
 that is around 

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:32.310
 therefore the correct positioning is not 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:34.700
 the two side lights but is a 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:36.540
 lighting a backlight 

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:39.270
 then 

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:41.550
 the glasses must always be 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:43.560
 illuminated from behind 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:47.370
 then from a light source that 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:51.210
 part behind and also illuminates way 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:53.610
 if I put behind and 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:55.230
 I will no longer have the silhouette in the non sense 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:56.670
 I will have more black because I want 

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:59.640
 still have a black background 

00:05:56.670 --> 00:06:04.380
 however if I put behind a light I would have the 

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:07.380
 problem of not having black have a 

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:10.320
 full white in this way we should 

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:13.140
 go and obscure a part obscure one 

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:16.610
 part and light only laterally 

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:20.780
 left and right from behind i 

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:23.040
 glasses in this way are desired 

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:23.580
 perfectly the silhouette of 

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:27.120
 glass 

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:30.270
 so let's change the light set 

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:33.120
 so I turn off the two banks positions one 

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:35.780
 light behind the mask and we see that 

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:35.780
 What happen
