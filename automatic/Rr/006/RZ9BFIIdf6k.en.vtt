00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
two things excuse a little bit more

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.490 
two things excuse a little bit more
accuracy<00:01:27.539> and<00:01:28.219> just<00:01:29.219> give<00:01:29.369> it<00:01:29.460> another<00:01:29.640> stir

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
accuracy and just give it another stir

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.440 
accuracy and just give it another stir
to<00:01:31.500> be<00:01:31.619> sure<00:01:31.799> that<00:01:31.950> everything<00:01:32.159> is<00:01:32.450> mixed

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450

together<00:01:33.659> well<00:01:35.479> all<00:01:36.479> right<00:01:36.899> so<00:01:37.079> that<00:01:37.200> looks

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
together well all right so that looks

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.660 
together well all right so that looks
pretty<00:01:37.470> good<00:01:37.679> now<00:01:38.329> now<00:01:40.069> to<00:01:41.069> make<00:01:41.250> sure<00:01:41.429> you've

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
pretty good now now to make sure you've

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.840 
pretty good now now to make sure you've
got<00:01:41.880> your<00:01:42.560> plan<00:01:43.560> of<00:01:43.619> attack<00:01:43.829> figure<00:01:44.429> out<00:01:44.579> in

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
got your plan of attack figure out in

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.730 
got your plan of attack figure out in
terms<00:01:44.880> of<00:01:45.299> how<00:01:45.630> you're<00:01:45.869> going<00:01:46.140> to<00:01:46.259> fill<00:01:46.560> this

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
terms of how you're going to fill this

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.459 
terms of how you're going to fill this
this<00:01:47.520> is<00:01:47.640> a<00:01:47.670> pretty<00:01:47.909> standard<00:01:48.259> tear<00:01:49.259> on<00:01:49.409> a

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:49.469 
this is a pretty standard tear on a

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:52.100 
this is a pretty standard tear on a
wetsuit<00:01:49.799> figuring<00:01:50.729> out<00:01:50.819> there<00:01:51.119> everybody

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
wetsuit figuring out there everybody

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.429 
wetsuit figuring out there everybody
does<00:01:52.500> it<00:01:52.709> it's<00:01:53.280> very<00:01:53.819> simple<00:01:54.000> to<00:01:54.390> fix<00:01:54.599> unless

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
does it it's very simple to fix unless

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.190 
does it it's very simple to fix unless
it<00:01:55.590> goes<00:01:55.709> all<00:01:55.829> with<00:01:56.009> you<00:01:56.130> which<00:01:56.250> most<00:01:56.610> don't

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
it goes all with you which most don't

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.300 
it goes all with you which most don't
because<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.319> Jersey<00:01:58.679> lining<00:01:58.950> on<00:01:59.069> a<00:01:59.099> wetsuit

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
because the Jersey lining on a wetsuit

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.229 
because the Jersey lining on a wetsuit
protects<00:02:00.060> it<00:02:00.179> from<00:02:00.209> that<00:02:00.450> so<00:02:01.170> what<00:02:01.439> you<00:02:01.530> do<00:02:01.679> is

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:02.239 
protects it from that so what you do is

00:02:02.239 --> 00:02:05.210 
protects it from that so what you do is
you<00:02:03.239> just<00:02:03.270> could<00:02:03.599> get<00:02:04.380> this<00:02:04.500> to<00:02:04.560> open<00:02:05.009> up<00:02:05.130> a

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 
you just could get this to open up a

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:15.620 
you just could get this to open up a
little<00:02:05.369> bit<00:02:08.509> take<00:02:10.069> a<00:02:11.069> mixture<00:02:14.120> and<00:02:15.120> just<00:02:15.390> dab

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
little bit take a mixture and just dab

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:21.840 
little bit take a mixture and just dab
it<00:02:15.810> in

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.910 

once<00:02:22.850> you've<00:02:23.000> got<00:02:23.240> the<00:02:23.420> full<00:02:24.200> pretty<00:02:24.800> much

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
once you've got the full pretty much

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.310 
once you've got the full pretty much
filled<00:02:25.220> up<00:02:26.410> to<00:02:27.410> avoid<00:02:27.770> any<00:02:27.950> excess<00:02:28.190> and<00:02:28.760> then

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:29.320 
filled up to avoid any excess and then

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:38.460 
filled up to avoid any excess and then
just<00:02:30.320> allow<00:02:30.500> this<00:02:30.830> to<00:02:31.010> close<00:02:31.220> on<00:02:31.430> itself<00:02:31.790> so

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:43.330 

you'll<00:02:39.470> out<00:02:39.620> to<00:02:39.800> close<00:02:40.040> on<00:02:40.250> itself<00:02:40.720> and<00:02:42.340> that

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
you'll out to close on itself and that

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.210 
you'll out to close on itself and that
pretty<00:02:43.730> much<00:02:43.820> will<00:02:44.150> seal<00:02:44.450> it<00:02:44.570> and<00:02:45.100> what<00:02:46.100> you

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
pretty much will seal it and what you

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:52.380 
pretty much will seal it and what you
need<00:02:46.370> to<00:02:46.460> do<00:02:46.550> now<00:02:46.700> is<00:02:48.850> keep<00:02:49.850> it<00:02:50.090> in<00:02:50.900> one<00:02:51.140> place

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
need to do now is keep it in one place

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.080 
need to do now is keep it in one place
to<00:02:53.390> dry<00:02:53.660> and<00:02:53.990> set<00:02:54.230> for<00:02:54.440> five<00:02:54.620> minutes<00:02:54.940> you<00:02:55.940> let

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
to dry and set for five minutes you let

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:57.760 
to dry and set for five minutes you let
this<00:02:56.270> set<00:02:56.480> for<00:02:56.510> up<00:02:56.780> for<00:02:57.140> five<00:02:57.350> minutes

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:57.770 
this set for up for five minutes

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:00.550 
this set for up for five minutes
and<00:02:57.860> then<00:02:58.610> if<00:02:58.760> you<00:02:58.910> would<00:02:59.300> like<00:02:59.510> to<00:02:59.540> which<00:03:00.020> I<00:03:00.290> do

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
and then if you would like to which I do

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.570 
and then if you would like to which I do
put<00:03:01.370> a<00:03:01.400> second<00:03:01.760> coat<00:03:01.790> just<00:03:02.300> around<00:03:03.460> north<00:03:04.460> a

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
put a second coat just around north a

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.040 
put a second coat just around north a
little<00:03:04.610> you'll<00:03:05.060> see<00:03:05.270> a<00:03:05.300> little<00:03:05.600> tear<00:03:05.810> line

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.050 
little you'll see a little tear line

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:08.590 
little you'll see a little tear line
just<00:03:06.350> go<00:03:06.650> around<00:03:06.770> that<00:03:07.100> really<00:03:07.430> quickly<00:03:07.670> let

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
just go around that really quickly let

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.450 
just go around that really quickly let
that<00:03:08.750> dry<00:03:08.990> for<00:03:09.020> 10<00:03:09.380> minutes<00:03:09.680> and<00:03:09.860> your<00:03:10.250> suit

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:10.460 
that dry for 10 minutes and your suit

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:14.710 
that dry for 10 minutes and your suit
should<00:03:10.700> be<00:03:10.940> as<00:03:11.840> good<00:03:11.900> as<00:03:12.230> new<00:03:12.290> as<00:03:13.660> several<00:03:14.660> of

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
should be as good as new as several of

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.890 
should be as good as new as several of
mine<00:03:14.930> are<00:03:15.190> we've<00:03:16.190> allowed<00:03:16.490> the<00:03:16.760> suit<00:03:17.000> to<00:03:17.750> set

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
mine are we've allowed the suit to set

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.830 
mine are we've allowed the suit to set
up<00:03:18.020> for<00:03:18.260> about<00:03:18.410> five<00:03:18.650> minutes<00:03:18.830> and<00:03:19.840> finally

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
up for about five minutes and finally

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.470 
up for about five minutes and finally
take<00:03:21.350> a<00:03:21.380> small<00:03:21.890> amount<00:03:22.160> of<00:03:22.460> the<00:03:22.880> seal<00:03:23.090> cement

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
take a small amount of the seal cement

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:29.680 
take a small amount of the seal cement
and<00:03:23.990> you<00:03:24.020> can<00:03:24.740> just<00:03:26.170> coat<00:03:27.170> that<00:03:27.470> little<00:03:28.690> line

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
and you can just coat that little line

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:31.870 
and you can just coat that little line
that<00:03:29.960> now<00:03:30.200> almost<00:03:30.500> just<00:03:31.100> looks<00:03:31.310> like<00:03:31.370> a<00:03:31.460> crease

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:31.880 
that now almost just looks like a crease

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:37.210 
that now almost just looks like a crease
and<00:03:33.010> this<00:03:34.010> will<00:03:34.280> be<00:03:34.460> a<00:03:34.790> final<00:03:35.330> seal<00:03:35.920> to<00:03:36.920> really

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
and this will be a final seal to really

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:43.200 
and this will be a final seal to really
strengthen<00:03:37.580> that<00:03:38.330> area

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:43.210 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:46.690 

and<00:03:44.210> the<00:03:44.420> thing<00:03:44.600> to<00:03:44.720> be<00:03:44.810> cautious<00:03:45.080> about<00:03:45.410> is<00:03:45.800> if

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
and the thing to be cautious about is if

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.880 
and the thing to be cautious about is if
you<00:03:46.940> try<00:03:47.450> and<00:03:47.750> wipe<00:03:47.960> this<00:03:48.230> away

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:48.890 
you try and wipe this away

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:53.350 
you try and wipe this away
it<00:03:49.880> really<00:03:50.240> doesn't<00:03:50.870> wipe<00:03:51.440> away<00:03:51.650> it<00:03:52.640> just<00:03:53.090> kind

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.360 
it really doesn't wipe away it just kind

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.990 
it really doesn't wipe away it just kind
of<00:03:53.390> smears<00:03:53.750> around<00:03:54.080> so<00:03:54.800> you<00:03:54.860> want<00:03:55.070> to<00:03:55.160> be<00:03:55.280> you

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
of smears around so you want to be you

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.610 
of smears around so you want to be you
want<00:03:56.120> to<00:03:56.210> be<00:03:56.300> as<00:03:56.390> accurate<00:03:56.630> as<00:03:56.900> possible<00:03:56.990> when

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
want to be as accurate as possible when

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:04.240 
want to be as accurate as possible when
you're<00:03:57.770> applying<00:03:58.010> it<00:04:01.720> and<00:04:02.720> yes<00:04:03.590> your<00:04:03.800> suit<00:04:04.010> is

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
you're applying it and yes your suit is

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.600 
you're applying it and yes your suit is
still<00:04:04.460> hydrodynamic<00:04:06.250> good<00:04:07.250> even<00:04:07.490> add<00:04:07.580> some

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:07.610 
still hydrodynamic good even add some

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:10.030 
still hydrodynamic good even add some
buoyancy
