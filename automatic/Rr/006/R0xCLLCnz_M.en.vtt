00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 
the time and I think they would do a

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.030 
the time and I think they would do a
much<00:00:38.030> better<00:00:38.059> job<00:00:38.330> at<00:00:38.690> it<00:00:38.720> than<00:00:38.900> me<00:00:38.930> but<00:00:39.530> I<00:00:39.860> am

and<00:01:42.680> he<00:01:42.799> just<00:01:43.009> kind<00:01:43.159> of<00:01:43.189> traveled<00:01:43.579> through

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
and he just kind of traveled through

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:46.090 
and he just kind of traveled through
time<00:01:43.759> and<00:01:44.030> picked<00:01:44.240> up<00:01:44.360> Jaden<00:01:44.780> then<00:01:44.990> Yugi<00:01:45.229> but

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
time and picked up Jaden then Yugi but

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.679 
time and picked up Jaden then Yugi but
overall<00:01:46.369> I<00:01:46.549> really<00:01:46.579> like<00:01:47.030> the<00:01:47.150> premise<00:01:47.540> I

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:47.689 
overall I really like the premise I

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:49.960 
overall I really like the premise I
thought<00:01:47.960> they<00:01:48.920> did<00:01:49.130> a<00:01:49.159> pretty<00:01:49.250> cool<00:01:49.700> way<00:01:49.729> of

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
thought they did a pretty cool way of

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:51.580 
thought they did a pretty cool way of
bringing<00:01:50.630> all<00:01:50.900> the<00:01:51.049> characters<00:01:51.439> together

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
bringing all the characters together

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.440 
bringing all the characters together
since<00:01:52.009> they<00:01:52.130> are<00:01:52.280> from<00:01:52.610> different<00:01:52.729> periods<00:01:53.150> of

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
since they are from different periods of

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.600 
since they are from different periods of
time<00:01:53.659> and<00:01:53.960> I<00:01:54.619> thought<00:01:54.799> it<00:01:54.920> really<00:01:55.130> worked<00:01:55.400> I

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
time and I thought it really worked I

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.700 
time and I thought it really worked I
mean<00:01:55.790> made<00:01:56.030> sense<00:01:56.390> the<00:01:56.780> the<00:01:56.810> villain<00:01:57.380> was<00:01:57.500> cool

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
mean made sense the the villain was cool

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.499 
mean made sense the the villain was cool
and<00:01:57.890> they<00:01:58.009> actually<00:01:58.159> had<00:01:58.490> a<00:01:58.520> pretty<00:01:58.880> epic<00:01:59.149> duel

00:01:59.499 --> 00:01:59.509 
and they actually had a pretty epic duel

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:01.090 
and they actually had a pretty epic duel
down<00:01:59.780> at<00:01:59.960> the<00:02:00.079> end<00:02:00.229> of<00:02:00.350> the<00:02:00.439> movie<00:02:00.590> now<00:02:00.920> not

doing<00:02:31.200> card<00:02:31.500> games<00:02:31.709> on<00:02:31.860> motorcycles<00:02:32.040> once

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
doing card games on motorcycles once

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.280 
doing card games on motorcycles once
again<00:02:33.060> in<00:02:33.299> another<00:02:33.390> movie<00:02:33.780> I<00:02:33.989> think<00:02:34.200> that

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
again in another movie I think that

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.319 
again in another movie I think that
would<00:02:34.409> be<00:02:34.530> pretty<00:02:34.709> cool<00:02:34.970> logically<00:02:35.970> I<00:02:36.000> think

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:36.329 
would be pretty cool logically I think

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:38.300 
would be pretty cool logically I think
it<00:02:36.420> makes<00:02:36.569> the<00:02:36.780> most<00:02:36.930> sense<00:02:37.079> to<00:02:37.500> do<00:02:37.890> something

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
it makes the most sense to do something

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.640 
it makes the most sense to do something
with<00:02:38.489> the<00:02:38.640> arc<00:02:38.819> 5<00:02:39.150> series<00:02:39.659> as<00:02:39.810> it<00:02:40.349> is

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
that are out in yugioh right now so

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:45.800
