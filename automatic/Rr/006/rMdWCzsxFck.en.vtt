00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.520
 DD-Dough embarrassing moments dearest 

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:06.700
 so i was eating at a restaurant with my best friend Kate 

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:10.560
 wait jaiden, the audio doesn't sound terrible anymore! 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:11.680
 I'm glad you noticed 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.500
 that's because I have a new microphone 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.300
 and it is one of good quality 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.220
 Unlike ... the microphone that was lying around my house one day 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.340
 and I decided to make an animation 

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:27.320
 now you can hear how my real voice sounds! 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.140
 and it is no longer of egh ... agh ... weh ...... 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.220
 embarrassing silence 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.300
 in any case, back to my story 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.080
 now, the place we were eating out was very cool 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.880
 because for kids, instead of coloring things 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.460
 you can ask a waiter or waitress if you can get a lot of bread dough to play with 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:45.580
 damn bread dough! 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.860
 I seriously don't know anyone who would put aside the possibility to play with bread dough! 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.400
 so Kate and I had to pull the hook up (make sure we got there) 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:58.180
 but we were both very shy at the time, so we had to choose who would ask the waiter for dough 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.200
 And it might not have been so bad if I and Kate hadn't been over the age 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.620
 where you are a child who can play with bread dough 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.240
 without being judged by adults. 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.820
 Neither of us wanted to be the one who asked for it ... 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.180
 I don't even know how, but she convinced me to take the initiative 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.020
 and the waiter came back about 5 minutes later to ask if we needed anything else ... 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.540
 There I panicked and it only went downhill! 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.360
 I only had to say seven words: We would like some bread dough here! 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.080
 But for some reason I couldn't get myself to say it ... 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.760
 To begin with, I was frozen 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.860
 and I just stared at him and he gave me such a look ... 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.960
 Then I opened my mouth and this is what came out ... 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:46.720
 I ... eh ... may we ... em ... sorry ... may ... eh ... we ... may we ... eh ... 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.780
 I have never stuttered so much in my WHOLE life. 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.200
 And when I realized that ... 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.360
 I started to laugh at myself! 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.500
 And then it sounded more like this: 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:04.460
 Eh ... * smile * ... ehm sorry ... can we ... eh ... * smile * ... can we ehm ..... sorry ehm .... 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.300
 Kate's mother had to interrupt me and explain to the guy what I was trying to say ... 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.020
 And after a look behind which he tried to hide his judgment about me, he walked away ... 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.560
 I was so shy, but we all laughed at it! 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.960
 And with that, bread dough! 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:20.880
 it's worth it anyway 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:42.420
 * end music plays *
