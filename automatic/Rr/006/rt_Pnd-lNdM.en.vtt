00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
I think they rewrapped it the cellophane

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.449 
I think they rewrapped it the cellophane
on<00:02:23.900> top<00:02:24.109> of<00:02:24.290> the<00:02:24.670> cap<00:02:25.670> and<00:02:27.160> it<00:02:28.160> was<00:02:28.280> such<00:02:28.430> a

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
on top of the cap and it was such a

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:29.860 
on top of the cap and it was such a
bummer<00:02:28.760> too<00:02:29.030> because<00:02:29.359> it<00:02:29.480> was<00:02:29.570> the<00:02:29.660> same

bummer too because it was the same
amount<00:02:29.989> of<00:02:30.200> money<00:02:30.350> I<00:02:30.709> think<00:02:31.310> it<00:02:31.400> was<00:02:31.540> $39.99

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
amount of money I think it was $39.99

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.310 
amount of money I think it was $39.99
and<00:02:32.810> then<00:02:32.930> I<00:02:33.019> paid<00:02:33.200> for<00:02:33.380> shipping<00:02:33.799> and<00:02:35.140> my<00:02:36.140> son
