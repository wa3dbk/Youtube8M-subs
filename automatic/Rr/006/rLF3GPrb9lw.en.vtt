00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:15.089
 this time with microsoft number 435 to 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.340
 do a test in games 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.779
 he is a cheap smartphone in 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.240
 low cost smartphones 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.820
 even though it has 1 GB of ram this 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.130
 it means that it is supported by all 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.289
 games still windows phone story 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.380

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.989
 even with such heavy and gta 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.430
 modern combat and others will spend 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.260
 follow company for you 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.850

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.719
 been a giant watch he can roll 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.059
 all games 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.730
 although the dual-core processor not be 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.250
 very good and we saw his side among the 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.410
 22 which is also no big deal but 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:55.050
 you can still run heavy games 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:56.699
 like asphalt 8 modern combat 4 and gta 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.600

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.239
 games 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.100
 some bigger than the others do not expect 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.290
 a fantastic performance in all 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.659
 because it is a low-cost country 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.970
 It's already a big achievement for him. 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.590
