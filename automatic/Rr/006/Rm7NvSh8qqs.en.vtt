00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 a colleague of mine other colleagues in the 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.180
 tent packed with notice but because 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:07.680
 the decision is the colleague has the 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.870
 nobody believed but then in the evening was 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.490
 really a really good in it was so 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.380
 a pep on four days did not work 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.010
 Thrown and packed from then dar 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.550
 and it was really disgusting but hamm weeks 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.080
 celebrated 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.230
 I do not hear so many sick people 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:25.260
 stories is my first festival like that 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:29.400
 I've never been so ok before 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.439
 so so far so everything was up 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.860
 alright so it was never something like that 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.989
 so what it was spectacular always yes it 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.940
 was always an event to do something 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.559
 why because it was a dream 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.200
 It has been a dream of mine ever since 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.219
 I'm two years old and I'm 16 years old 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.289
 seen your splash 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.230
 this stage with the people and so on 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.360
 bushido , for example, a bit 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.530
 shit itself may be here and one 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.780
 huge honor and that is definitely 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.180
 yes, that was mine for me then 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.320
 events but now such events 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.420
 were a striker so by own 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.730
 Concepts always there so it's always up for 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.799
 me something special so so blatant 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:09.299
 the festival story is not so 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:11.580
 i am 2011 at night when i am somebody 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.229
 signed on the t-shirt 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.299
 fell backwards and am in the mud 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.280
 landed and lay like a beetle on the 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.610
 I have experienced myself that mine 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.110
 dj festivals in switzerland five minutes 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.240
 So before we even occurs at the time 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.159
 with turntables and plates and and 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.570
 sound record player has hung up like that 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.100
 drunk that he was upside down 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.689
 behind such huge ears 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.790
 We fell like we had to quasi 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.439
 Snow White and bring again 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.420
 colleague jumped in for the first 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.829
 song has run in the plate 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.479
 we have lived to be lived 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.500
 of course, and someday you will see 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.090
 where they go and see that he does 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.530
 not among these is start and two 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.030
 Three songs later crawls has 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.220
 peoples power from the north stork and 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.680
 So I put on the crown and makes 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.439
 the djs so festivals are altogether whole 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.939
 cool i believe the best stories 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.490
 actually happen on one pass 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.500
 tent place where I already stop 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.469
 a few years ago 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.899
 therefore it is actually a relative and 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:06.689
 romantic you go make yours 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.190
 on the thing but this year for me 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.830
 it was something else on the splash 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.410
 because we have to stop 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:15.910
 write is a tape is the 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:18.440
 on the weekend with three square time 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.000
 almost the songs are reinterpreted 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.850
 did and the songs after played though 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.170
 something special in any case 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:26.720
 was fun and I finally could 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.950
 I want to wear a white suit 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.240
 not to elaborate on it but me 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:34.850
 have times down the stairs 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:36.920
 kicked point so happened to me 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:39.440
 not so much because we always 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.570
 come to the festival and again same 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.520
 Price so the sick is mostly up 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:46.130
 splash festival story is you gonna 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:49.100
 i never forget i think it was 99 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:51.770
 because I hung up with someone and im 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:54.410
 tent and the dj desk broke in and there 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:56.240
 was such a table of choice 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.650
 then the side down and then would be 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.060
 somehow two people have it up then 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.470
 we will have hung up 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.670
 something slowly below it 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.580
 placed on the table then always stood 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:07.070
 still so oblique the whole time so that 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.620
 was one of the craziest things 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:12.040
 flash for me at least the allowed 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:15.100
 We do not tell no case though 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:18.320
 we can tell the second best 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:21.890
 the appearance of the 257 that yesterday he 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:23.450
 was awesome and outkast was really shit 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.400
 each one's own construction is quite simple 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.080
 itself looks quite simple so shitty 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:31.910
 I have said before that 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:33.590
 already my field of women saw the coal 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.910
 but we only want the coal-nee 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.950
 the funniest thing in any case that snow like that 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:39.170
 almost drowned would be with more then 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:43.940
 again no further details follow 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:46.750
 my first splash festival with 16 on 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:52.780
 Crutches completely fucking idea in any case 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:55.220
 So I know two bags have the 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.900
 I think they are naked in the lake 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:00.080
 swam samy deluxe 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:02.750
 has occurred and have been swimming 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:04.850
 packed in the lake but I may the 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:07.900
 do not say names 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:10.880
 because you I have seen times 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:15.170
 after a festival with his fist 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:17.270
 completely battered felt like 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:21.770
 a horny indio than Spanish 

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:25.480
 Conquistadores city he was busta 

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:28.040
 rhymes on stage are already who 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.210
 Alcohol impregnated us too 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.190
 somehow sneak on the stage 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:34.900
 I am completely freaked out and found 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:34.900
 It was great and always wrote 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:42.380
 after that, you may have a photo with busta rhymes 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:44.240
 then I'm so close is so full 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:46.070
 nice and polite hey mister busta rhymes 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.140
 no remake pictures please 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:49.670
 and he is just very proud of me 

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:51.980
 There is still something to march past 

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:54.920
 said bad and since then pastor is 1 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:56.630
 no more king school baku is yesterday 

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:58.190
 run through a backstage 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:01.580
 muttered the whole time to himself 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:03.920
 money money money money money that was 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:06.650
 In any case, I will be pretty 

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:10.760
 I believe it but I have 2010 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:13.190
 Well, I involved in it or every year 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:15.700
 actually a 2010 I have what the 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:18.170
 trailer park met 

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:19.220
 in the tent place you feel in the morning 

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:21.050
 at 9 or 10 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:24.440
 and then we are something about that 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:26.120
 zeltplatz mackerel and there was so 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.730
 So we have such a small one 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:31.060
 destruction, made tour as I 

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:35.420
 we prefer and in any case we have 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:37.370
 there was a guy on the edge of 

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:38.870
 some way like that and I believe that 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:40.490
 was on really hard 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:41.870
 should drugs and be senate 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:44.150
 rausgeholt so I tried him 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:45.950
 to introduce a bottle then tell 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:47.690
 that notices it disengaged and we 

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:51.500
 We almost had to beat us but we did 

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:52.160
 could us by nice arguments again 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:54.770
 avoid 

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.940
 the sick festival story i 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:58.010
 have ever heard 

00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:00.560
 it does not exist but it will be today 

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:02.330
 I actually think so 

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:04.960
 tonight is going to be pretty blatant 

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:07.810
 because we play during the final wm 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:09.220
 and now play right after 

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:10.690
 and either they lose us with that 

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:12.729
 shitty appearance or the profits 

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:15.699
 from about grass I think that's it 

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:17.050
 today the most blatant what comes and otherwise 

00:06:15.699 --> 00:06:19.690
 is always just a boring boom we 

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:21.280
 Nothing lives next to me is on everyone 

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:23.680
 case we have a transporter 

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:26.080
 take the washer five 

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:28.090
 minutes before the show because recep one 

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:29.410
 Bassist forgot his laptop in there 

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:32.139
 has and then we need for the show 

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:33.669
 yes yes that was okay and the label was 

00:06:32.139 --> 00:06:35.560
 also still was quite chilled 

00:06:33.669 --> 00:06:37.740
 I had the feeling but no matter 

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:40.660
 was in any case extremely so to speak 

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:42.940
 just one of my most blatant 

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:45.550
 stories so crudely crazy 

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:47.710
 stories was last year with twitter 

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:48.970
 park da has a buddy of them 

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:51.880
 had occurred and bastian the 

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:56.139
 Fire extinguishers stormed the stage and there 

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:58.030
 made a mess and I stood there 

00:06:56.139 --> 00:07:01.330
 of course have also celebrated with and on 

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:02.860
 end of the us me arrested but 

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:05.130
 real village says nothing and betrays 

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:05.130
 to take
