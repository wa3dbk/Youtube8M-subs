00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:40.989 
but I only did it for two weeks because

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:44.080 
but I only did it for two weeks because

00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:57.199 
I get that the shake contains every all

00:00:57.199 --> 00:00:58.899 
I get that the shake contains every all

really hard and if I myself not doing

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:10.450 
really hard and if I myself not doing
that<00:01:09.050> very<00:01:09.140> much<00:01:09.350> the<00:01:09.590> cleanse<00:01:09.830> that<00:01:10.100> was

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
that very much the cleanse that was

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:11.469 
that very much the cleanse that was
amazing

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
amazing

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:13.090 
amazing
I<00:01:11.510> have<00:01:11.840> to<00:01:11.960> say<00:01:12.110> I<00:01:12.140> only<00:01:12.380> did<00:01:12.560> it<00:01:12.590> for<00:01:12.680> one<00:01:12.890> day

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 
I have to say I only did it for one day

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.030 
I have to say I only did it for one day
but<00:01:13.520> I<00:01:13.580> ended<00:01:13.970> up<00:01:14.060> losing<00:01:14.240> I<00:01:14.750> think<00:01:15.560> like<00:01:15.770> three

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
but I ended up losing I think like three

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.310 
but I ended up losing I think like three
pounds<00:01:16.880> in<00:01:17.120> just<00:01:17.180> that<00:01:17.540> day<00:01:17.720> and<00:01:17.960> then<00:01:18.080> I

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
pounds in just that day and then I

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:19.570 
pounds in just that day and then I
assumed<00:01:18.740> that<00:01:18.920> I<00:01:19.040> would<00:01:19.159> gain<00:01:19.400> the<00:01:19.490> weight

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 
assumed that I would gain the weight

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.100 
assumed that I would gain the weight
back<00:01:19.640> like<00:01:20.000> the<00:01:20.120> next<00:01:20.150> day<00:01:20.510> or<00:01:20.750> with<00:01:20.870> it<00:01:20.990> like

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
back like the next day or with it like

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:22.510 
back like the next day or with it like
two<00:01:21.290> days<00:01:21.440> after<00:01:21.740> that<00:01:21.860> and<00:01:21.890> I<00:01:22.070> never<00:01:22.280> gained

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
two days after that and I never gained

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.750 
two days after that and I never gained
it<00:01:22.610> back

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:22.760 
it back

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.270 
it back
I<00:01:23.030> think<00:01:23.659> for<00:01:23.810> the<00:01:23.870> two<00:01:24.050> weeks<00:01:24.320> I<00:01:24.650> was<00:01:24.830> on<00:01:25.010> it<00:01:25.130> I

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
I think for the two weeks I was on it I

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.970 
I think for the two weeks I was on it I
lost<00:01:25.460> seven<00:01:25.880> pounds<00:01:26.050> which<00:01:27.050> is<00:01:27.410> a<00:01:27.470> time<00:01:27.770> to

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:27.980 
lost seven pounds which is a time to

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:29.710 
lost seven pounds which is a time to
lose<00:01:28.130> I<00:01:28.400> think<00:01:28.670> just<00:01:29.000> for<00:01:29.090> being<00:01:29.270> on<00:01:29.390> it<00:01:29.540> so<00:01:29.690> I

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
lose I think just for being on it so I

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.220 
lose I think just for being on it so I
mean<00:01:30.050> it<00:01:30.230> does<00:01:30.410> work<00:01:30.650> uh<00:01:31.990> eating<00:01:32.990> smaller

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:33.230 
mean it does work uh eating smaller

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:35.980 
mean it does work uh eating smaller
portions<00:01:33.320> and<00:01:34.220> just<00:01:34.760> even<00:01:34.940> healthier<00:01:35.510> just

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
portions and just even healthier just

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:37.780 
portions and just even healthier just
the<00:01:36.170> exact<00:01:36.440> same<00:01:36.650> thing<00:01:36.950> and<00:01:37.190> you<00:01:37.400> get<00:01:37.490> to<00:01:37.610> eat

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:37.790 
the exact same thing and you get to eat

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:39.370 
the exact same thing and you get to eat
so<00:01:38.150> I<00:01:38.180> don't<00:01:38.360> really<00:01:38.420> think<00:01:38.570> the<00:01:38.780> Isagenix<00:01:39.020> for

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
so I don't really think the Isagenix for

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.290 
so I don't really think the Isagenix for
me<00:01:39.500> every<00:01:39.800> once<00:01:39.980> a<00:01:40.100> while<00:01:40.130> I<00:01:40.760> watch<00:01:41.090> these

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:41.300 
me every once a while I watch these

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.240 
me every once a while I watch these
Shakeology<00:01:41.930> people<00:01:42.260> and<00:01:42.410> I'm<00:01:42.500> like<00:01:42.530> that

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250

I enjoyed the workout for 30 minutes

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.369 
I enjoyed the workout for 30 minutes
which<00:03:48.120> I<00:03:48.239> didn't<00:03:48.510> think<00:03:48.599> I<00:03:48.750> would<00:03:48.810> enjoy<00:03:48.989> 30

00:03:49.369 --> 00:03:49.379 
which I didn't think I would enjoy 30

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:51.619 
which I didn't think I would enjoy 30
minute<00:03:49.650> workout<00:03:49.949> and<00:03:50.299> especially<00:03:51.299> when<00:03:51.540> you

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
can't watch TV while you do it because

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:54.680 
can't watch TV while you do it because

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
work when the girls are asleep and you

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:58.699 
work when the girls are asleep and you
know<00:03:57.750> I<00:03:57.780> don't<00:03:57.989> have<00:03:58.079> a<00:03:58.109> nurse<00:03:58.319> in<00:03:58.470> my<00:03:58.530> house

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
know I don't have a nurse in my house

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:00.080 
know I don't have a nurse in my house
and<00:03:59.040> I<00:03:59.129> have<00:03:59.310> to<00:03:59.430> do<00:03:59.519> a<00:03:59.549> million<00:03:59.760> other<00:04:00.030> things

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
and I have to do a million other things

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:01.970 
and I have to do a million other things
but<00:04:00.900> I<00:04:01.199> really<00:04:01.230> enjoyed<00:04:01.739> it

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
but I really enjoyed it

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.369 
but I really enjoyed it
except<00:04:02.430> for<00:04:02.549> that<00:04:02.730> for<00:04:03.239> the<00:04:03.419> next<00:04:03.510> four<00:04:03.780> days<00:04:03.900> I

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:04.379 
except for that for the next four days I

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:06.379 
except for that for the next four days I
couldn't<00:04:04.769> walk<00:04:05.010> and<00:04:05.310> my<00:04:05.370> legs<00:04:05.579> are<00:04:05.699> killing<00:04:05.940> me

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:06.389 
couldn't walk and my legs are killing me

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:08.750 
couldn't walk and my legs are killing me
so<00:04:06.959> I<00:04:06.989> decided<00:04:07.680> I<00:04:07.829> would<00:04:07.859> take<00:04:08.069> a<00:04:08.129> step<00:04:08.400> back

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
so I decided I would take a step back

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.399 
so I decided I would take a step back
from<00:04:09.090> the<00:04:09.239> third<00:04:09.419> one<00:04:09.659> 30<00:04:09.780> minute<00:04:10.049> workouts

00:04:10.399 --> 00:04:10.409 
from the third one 30 minute workouts

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:13.159 
from the third one 30 minute workouts
and<00:04:10.739> I<00:04:11.190> download<00:04:11.579> a<00:04:11.790> 30-day<00:04:12.269> challenge<00:04:12.959> app

and I download a 30-day challenge app

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:15.649 
and I download a 30-day challenge app
and<00:04:13.500> it<00:04:14.010> was<00:04:14.099> like<00:04:14.220> $4<00:04:15.120> I<00:04:15.239> think<00:04:15.419> but<00:04:15.540> there's

00:04:15.649 --> 00:04:15.659 
and it was like $4 I think but there's

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:17.210 
and it was like $4 I think but there's
like<00:04:15.780> a<00:04:15.840> bunch<00:04:16.109> of<00:04:16.260> different<00:04:16.590> challenges<00:04:16.829> you

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
challenge and so far it's like not it

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.500
