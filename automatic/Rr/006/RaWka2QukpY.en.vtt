00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:13.320
 so hello to all friends with you as 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:16.019

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.180
 an interesting mod for ours is sandra 

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:20.940
 article no mod and I just took it and 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.310
 combined several mods in a single unit 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.949
 this whole assassin theme is creed 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.199
 changed ask you add new 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.470
 skins three news for later 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:34.379
 replaced by standard animation and plus 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.359
 to all added new parkour animation 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:38.339
 then consider all this quickly not 

00:00:36.359 --> 00:00:41.579

00:00:38.339 --> 00:00:43.649

00:00:46.409 --> 00:00:52.469
 some kind of sea pirate okay then 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:56.069
 measure the standard animation jumps 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:58.709
 there running and so on, such as jumps 

00:00:56.069 --> 00:01:01.949

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.960
 cool animation in assassin style 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.899
 it really looks like something more expensive 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.930

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:15.750

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:23.909
 will say and yes and such is the third innovation 

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:26.130

 on the keyboard the blair num1 and here it is 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.299
