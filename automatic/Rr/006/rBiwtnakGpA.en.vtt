I<00:00:00.240> was<00:00:00.750> champion<00:00:00.930> techiques<00:00:01.439> and<00:00:01.620> today<00:00:01.770> we're

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:01.949 
I was champion techiques and today we're

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:04.849 
I was champion techiques and today we're
looking<00:00:02.040> at<00:00:02.280> the<00:00:02.700> TfL<00:00:03.540> infinity<00:00:04.380> press

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859 
looking at the TfL infinity press

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.509 
looking at the TfL infinity press
machine<00:00:05.640> which<00:00:06.210> is<00:00:06.540> like<00:00:07.440> a<00:00:07.470> juicer<00:00:08.040> but<00:00:08.280> um

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
machine which is like a juicer but um

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.180 
machine which is like a juicer but um
but<00:00:09.030> apparently<00:00:09.540> juicing<00:00:10.139> in<00:00:10.380> its

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
but apparently juicing in its

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.259 
but apparently juicing in its
traditional<00:00:11.370> form<00:00:11.759> where<00:00:12.450> you<00:00:12.599> squeeze<00:00:14.269> juice

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
traditional form where you squeeze juice

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.830 
traditional form where you squeeze juice
out<00:00:15.540> of<00:00:15.920> vegetables<00:00:16.920> and<00:00:17.190> fruits<00:00:17.699> is<00:00:17.970> passe

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
out of vegetables and fruits is passe

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.109 
out of vegetables and fruits is passe
and<00:00:19.380> what<00:00:19.529> you<00:00:19.619> should<00:00:19.859> be<00:00:20.039> doing<00:00:20.310> is<00:00:20.460> pressing

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
and what you should be doing is pressing

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:22.310 
and what you should be doing is pressing
them<00:00:21.300> which<00:00:21.510> is<00:00:21.660> what<00:00:21.779> this<00:00:21.960> machine<00:00:22.109> does

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
them which is what this machine does

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.099 
them which is what this machine does
which<00:00:23.160> creates<00:00:23.550> just<00:00:24.359> gives<00:00:24.570> you<00:00:24.660> more<00:00:24.810> juice

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
which creates just gives you more juice

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.460 
which creates just gives you more juice
and<00:00:25.910> so<00:00:26.910> there's<00:00:27.090> less<00:00:27.210> waste<00:00:27.449> and<00:00:27.810> you<00:00:28.260> get

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
and so there's less waste and you get

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.410 
and so there's less waste and you get
more<00:00:28.740> vitamins<00:00:29.550> and<00:00:29.730> nutrients<00:00:30.090> and<00:00:30.179> all<00:00:30.330> the

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
more vitamins and nutrients and all the

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.730 
more vitamins and nutrients and all the
good<00:00:30.539> stuff<00:00:30.779> that's<00:00:30.960> why<00:00:31.289> you're<00:00:31.470> juicing

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
good stuff that's why you're juicing

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.500 
good stuff that's why you're juicing
it's<00:00:32.369> a<00:00:32.520> very<00:00:32.700> cleverly<00:00:33.030> put<00:00:33.270> together

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
it's a very cleverly put together

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.440 
it's a very cleverly put together
machine<00:00:34.050> what<00:00:34.559> I<00:00:34.590> like<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.579> most<00:00:35.760> is<00:00:36.059> how

that's that's what the pressing things
for<00:01:12.100> but<00:01:12.610> it's<00:01:12.760> slowly<00:01:13.330> sort<00:01:13.930> of<00:01:14.400> crashes<00:01:15.400> or

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
for but it's slowly sort of crashes or

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
the the juice out of the machine what I

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.520 
the the juice out of the machine what I
also<00:01:19.270> like<00:01:19.540> about<00:01:19.570> this<00:01:19.960> is<00:01:20.170> rather<00:01:20.380> than

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 
also like about this is rather than

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.680 
also like about this is rather than
having<00:01:20.800> a<00:01:20.950> little<00:01:21.100> bag<00:01:21.280> at<00:01:21.520> the<00:01:21.610> end<00:01:21.790> or<00:01:22.630> a

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:22.690 
having a little bag at the end or a

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.170 
having a little bag at the end or a
compartment<00:01:23.320> that<00:01:23.410> sort<00:01:23.680> of<00:01:23.740> fills<00:01:24.130> with<00:01:24.460> gunk

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 
compartment that sort of fills with gunk

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.150 
compartment that sort of fills with gunk
it<00:01:25.360> spits<00:01:25.990> that<00:01:26.170> out<00:01:26.290> the<00:01:26.470> back<00:01:26.619> straightaway

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:27.160 
it spits that out the back straightaway

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.540 
it spits that out the back straightaway
so<00:01:28.380> you<00:01:29.380> don't<00:01:29.560> have<00:01:29.740> to<00:01:29.830> worry<00:01:30.009> about<00:01:30.100> that

things<00:01:43.090> like<00:01:43.300> that<00:01:43.360> by<00:01:44.020> mostly<00:01:44.500> I<00:01:44.830> use<00:01:45.220> it<00:01:45.460> to

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:45.580 
things like that by mostly I use it to

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.870 
things like that by mostly I use it to
try<00:01:45.790> and<00:01:45.820> make<00:01:45.970> juices<00:01:46.830> yeah<00:01:47.860> I'm<00:01:48.340> making<00:01:48.730> a

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
carrot and apple and I think that some

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.550 
carrot and apple and I think that some
lemon<00:01:52.330> involved<00:01:52.720> here<00:01:52.900> there's<00:01:53.230> a<00:01:53.320> lot<00:01:53.440> more

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
lemon involved here there's a lot more

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.200 
lemon involved here there's a lot more
preparation<00:01:54.220> involved<00:01:54.460> in<00:01:54.850> this<00:01:54.940> and<00:01:55.150> the

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
preparation involved in this and the

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:56.399 
preparation involved in this and the
standard<00:01:55.570> do<00:01:55.659> so<00:01:55.810> because<00:01:55.960> you<00:01:56.050> do<00:01:56.170> have<00:01:56.200> to

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.409 
standard do so because you do have to

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:58.320 
standard do so because you do have to
chop<00:01:56.710> everything<00:01:56.890> up<00:01:57.220> so<00:01:57.729> you<00:01:57.790> can't<00:01:58.060> just

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
chop everything up so you can't just

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.600 
chop everything up so you can't just
throw<00:01:58.750> in<00:01:59.050> like<00:01:59.380> whole<00:01:59.650> apples<00:02:00.100> and<00:02:00.220> oranges

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
throw in like whole apples and oranges
