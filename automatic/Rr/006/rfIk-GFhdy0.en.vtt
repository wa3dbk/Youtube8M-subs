00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.940
 Translated and voiced by Fighting Hamster, Top 10 facts about the Call of Duty game series. 

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:13.360
 In 2011, a 46-year-old man from the UK sat 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.340
 and just played Call of Duty: Black Ops. During one match 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.109
 he was constantly killed by a 13-year-old boy. 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:23.980
 But further it is better, he began to call the man, which, naturally, 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.300
 angered him even more. As a result, he was bombed, 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.480
 and he magically found the address of the student. 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.160
 After he came to his house and tried to strangle him. 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.370
 Fortunately, the boy's mother was at home and she managed to drive out 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:38.610
 this man. 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.650
 A little later, he was arrested by the police. Clear thing 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:44.750
 that this is unacceptable, but admit it - you too, 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.410
 at least once, wanted to do so. 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.200
 Steven Spielberg is not only a great director, 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.400
 He is also an avid gamer. He had a good influence 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.780
 on the gaming industry, if it were not for him, then it simply was not 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.730
 most modern shooters. 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.670
 In 1997, he wanted to create a realistic game based on 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.530
 World War II. But most developers 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.650
 then they thought the game would fail, simply because 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.400
 that it will not be some kind of fiction. 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:18.030
 But Spielberg was already unstoppable, in 1999 came out 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.060
 the first part of the Medal of Honor series, it has become incredible 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.850
 successful and this influenced the creation of the studio Infinity 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.110
 Ward, who made the first part of Call of Duty. 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.780
 When creating a NukeTown card from the first part of Black Ops developers 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.160
 drew inspiration from the scene of the movie Indiana Jones: 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.960
 Kingdom of the Crystal Skull where the main character 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.020
 It turns out in a fake city, where they are held 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.780
 nuclear bomb testing. 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.940
 Being the sixth of the best-selling video game series, 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.080
 Call of Duty impresses with its statistics. More than 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.040
 100 million people at least once played Call of Duty. 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.140
 This is the largest population of Germany. 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.020
 More than 32 quadrillion bullets were fired. 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.700
 Over 31 billion supply boxes were dropped 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.860
 since the release of Modern Warfare 2. 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.700
 More than 5 billion cars were blown up. 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.700
 By the way, there are 5 times fewer cars registered in the world. 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.851
 Last but entertaining fact: all the players held 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:25.119
 in call of duty 25 billion hours. It's about 2.85 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.280
 million years. We spent more in Call of Duty, 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.680
 than humanity itself exists. 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.780
 Call of Duty: Ghosts even in spite of the excellent artificial 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.980
 intelligence of fish, not sold successfully, as the previous games in the series. 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.310
 Compared to Black Ops 2 sales 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:47.739
 fell 19% and 36% when compared with Modern Warfare 3. 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:51.729
 Also, it did not become the best-selling game of 2013. 

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:54.560
 The honorable first place is taken by GTA 5. 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.380
 New Call of Duty is released every year, and in each new part 

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:02.869
 only change the plot and improve what was in 

00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:03.970
 past games. 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.940
 It seems to many players that due to the fact that the series 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.490
 put on the conveyor - the developers have stopped adding something 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:13.070
 new, but just take everything from the past parts. 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:15.930
 It would be easier to sell games such as DLS, differences 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.690
 there would be a minimum. When Call of Duty: Ghosts came out, the players criticized 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.250
 her since they noticed the similarity of scenes from the first 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.630
 missions from the Ghosts and the latest missions from Modern Warfare 2. 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.550
 For reference, they were not just similar, they were 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.951
 are identical. Changed only the characters and the surrounding 

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.919
 Wednesday, take a look for yourself. 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:47.820
 In the first part of Call of Duty, or as it is sometimes called 

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:51.249
 Call of duty classic shotguns are completely absent. 

00:03:51.249 --> 00:03:56.669
 Colt 1911 is in almost all games of the series, except Finest Hour, 

00:03:56.669 --> 00:04:00.869
 Black Ops: Declassified and Ghosts, it turns out that this is the most common 

00:04:00.869 --> 00:04:02.340
 weapons in the series. 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.440
 Call of Duty: Ghosts is the first game since the release 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.780
 Call of Duty Classic, where the opportunity appeared on the console 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:12.540
 lean to the side and play for a woman in multiplayer. 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.500
 As in any other popular series of games, a lot of 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.580
 content from the final game. For example, in Modern Warfare 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.969
 there must be a full mission in space. 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:29.149
 In World of War zombie mode, an automaton should have appeared, which 

00:04:29.149 --> 00:04:33.169
 restores ammunition to the player, it is called AmmoMatic. 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.759
 The events on the map of the moon should have been originally 

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:42.139
 on the map of Paris. In Modern Warfare 2 the train should have appeared 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:45.100
 as an interactive element, on at least one map. 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.900
 In Modern Warfare 3 should have been added 3 more killstriks, 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.579
 such as: air strike, emergency air assistance 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:54.941
 and call drone. 

00:04:54.941 --> 00:04:58.100
 Also had to add the perk that allowed 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:00.970
 install autonomous machine gun picture of this 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:02.630
 Perk found in the files of the game. 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.600
 In fact, the developers of the zombie mod, Treyarch, 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:12.370
 took inspiration from the flash game "The Last Stand". She was very 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:15.379
 similar to the zombie mod of Call of Duty, where we need 

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:18.669
 defend themselves from endless hordes of zombies, fixing barricades 

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:20.469
 and improving your weapon. 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:31.800
 January 14, 2014 released a completely new part of Call of Duty, which 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.680
 you probably have not heard anything since she came out 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:39.490
 only in China. The game is called Call of Duty: Online and is completely 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:42.280
 Free-2-Play project. The game gets on between two 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:47.260
 series, Modern Warfare and Black Ops, because maps, weapons 

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.900
 and characters were taken from both episodes. Also exists 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:52.920
 zombie mod called Dead Rising. No, not this one. 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:56.670
 It is necessary to fight with zombie cyborg. She also 

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:00.329
 exists only for China, but it is rumored that it can 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.600
 release for the rest of the world.
