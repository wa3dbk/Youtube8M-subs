 leandro gomes and here but maybe a 

00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:11.590
 bit of my work here one 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:15.880
 project that I have been developing around 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:18.730
 of a year a self model back model 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:23.550
 homemade right here 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:25.570
 a 15 6 scale ceiling is arriving 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.949
 It's been a while since I've been coming. 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:28.739
 developing there because you have to do 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:33.160
 all practically né 

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:37.300
 so here is a little bit of my work 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:40.320
 Here is an update here is the engine 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:43.240
 the 43- centered brushless gasoline 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.170
 sure that it has a brake system to 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.170
 bike disc 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:51.600
 on the bottom 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:01:01.120
 right then the home model I come 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:03.550
 doing here and one of the few 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.860
 main difficulties of the project is the 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:08.080
 steering system that needs a 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.840
 very strong service to command the 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:14.740
 suitcases here then searching 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:17.770
 much on the internet and many in which 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:20.770
 has already done and has been applying 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:23.170
 Here I developed that is a charm 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:26.530
 that the windshield wiper motor is not 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:29.080
 with complete drainage and another 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:31.900
 friend of mine that the ricardo brook here 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:35.530
 is also developing a 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:38.290
 model homemade model playing from 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.010
 with face that developed this plate here 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:43.060
 huh 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:48.130
 It is the board that commands the 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:50.500
 cleaner work how to be sure then 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:53.020
 here is a system to save about 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.890
 I developed to avoid nagy breaking 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:58.710
 huh 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:02:00.070

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:09.789
 brigadão and victor acts plate that 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:12.099

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:13.360
 wiper motor as a service right 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:15.160
 is the board aqq 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.520
 It warms up and it's about 40 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:21.610
 minutes worth not having a thermometer that 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:25.560
