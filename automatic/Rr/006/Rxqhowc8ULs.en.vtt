00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:12.049 
back on nationwide which i think was

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:14.319 
back on nationwide which i think was
about<00:00:12.169> 30<00:00:12.530> years<00:00:12.620> ago<00:00:12.829> it<00:00:13.249> was<00:00:13.429> yes<00:00:13.879> and<00:00:14.209> I'm

00:00:14.319 --> 00:00:14.329 
about 30 years ago it was yes and I'm

00:00:14.329 --> 00:00:16.570 
about 30 years ago it was yes and I'm
wondering<00:00:14.749> whether<00:00:15.019> you<00:00:15.499> think<00:00:15.580> governments

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:16.580 
wondering whether you think governments

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.030

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:19.040 
have been as serious about sugar as they

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.370 
have been as serious about sugar as they
have<00:00:19.190> been<00:00:19.340> about<00:00:19.550> cigarettes<00:00:20.030> they<00:00:20.960> haven't

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:21.380 
have been about cigarettes they haven't

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.130 
have been about cigarettes they haven't
and<00:00:21.710> they<00:00:22.370> don't<00:00:22.580> realize<00:00:22.790> that<00:00:23.060> it's<00:00:23.690> just<00:00:23.750> as

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:24.140 
and they don't realize that it's just as

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.830 
and they don't realize that it's just as
addictive<00:00:24.650> as<00:00:24.860> smoking<00:00:25.220> or<00:00:26.030> even<00:00:26.360> alcohol

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:26.840 
addictive as smoking or even alcohol

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.560 
addictive as smoking or even alcohol
it's<00:00:27.740> just<00:00:28.130> that<00:00:28.310> if<00:00:28.400> you<00:00:28.550> bar<00:00:28.760> if<00:00:28.940> you<00:00:29.120> if<00:00:29.390> you

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:29.570 
it's just that if you bar if you if you

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:31.450 
it's just that if you bar if you if you

have a piece of sugarcane straight from
the<00:00:31.700> field<00:00:32.270> it<00:00:32.780> would<00:00:32.899> take<00:00:33.079> you<00:00:33.200> probably

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:33.410 
the field it would take you probably

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.800 
the field it would take you probably
about<00:00:33.590> a<00:00:33.739> week<00:00:34.010> to<00:00:34.070> eat<00:00:34.430> it<00:00:34.640> but<00:00:35.360> once<00:00:35.600> that's

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:35.810 
about a week to eat it but once that's

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:38.500 
about a week to eat it but once that's
refined<00:00:36.320> down<00:00:36.740> to<00:00:36.920> a<00:00:36.950> powder<00:00:37.220> it's<00:00:37.910> a<00:00:38.120> very

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:38.510 
refined down to a powder it's a very

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.640 
refined down to a powder it's a very
very<00:00:39.079> concentrated<00:00:40.090> substance<00:00:41.090> and<00:00:41.450> I<00:00:42.410> know<00:00:42.500> a

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:42.650 
very concentrated substance and I know a

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:45.220 
very concentrated substance and I know a
little<00:00:42.890> bit<00:00:43.100> about<00:00:43.340> palates<00:00:43.880> and<00:00:44.180> if<00:00:44.870> you<00:00:45.050> eat

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:45.230 
little bit about palates and if you eat

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.880 
little bit about palates and if you eat
sugar<00:00:45.620> too<00:00:46.550> much<00:00:46.730> sugar<00:00:47.000> then<00:00:47.899> you<00:00:48.200> become<00:00:48.649> you

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:48.890 
sugar too much sugar then you become you

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.220 
sugar too much sugar then you become you
but<00:00:49.070> you<00:00:49.250> you<00:00:49.790> need<00:00:49.940> to<00:00:50.060> you<00:00:50.420> need<00:00:50.600> it<00:00:50.810> you<00:00:51.079> need

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:51.230 
but you you need to you need it you need

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.470 
but you you need to you need it you need
to<00:00:51.350> eat<00:00:51.500> the<00:00:51.620> sugar<00:00:51.860> because<00:00:52.340> you're<00:00:53.149> craving

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.480 
to eat the sugar because you're craving

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.229 
to eat the sugar because you're craving
for<00:00:54.050> it<00:00:54.230> and<00:00:54.470> I<00:00:54.890> think<00:00:54.950> what<00:00:55.670> we<00:00:55.790> need<00:00:55.820> to<00:00:55.970> do<00:00:56.120> is

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239 
for it and I think what we need to do is

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:59.639 
for it and I think what we need to do is
educate<00:00:56.870> people<00:00:57.110> about<00:00:57.530> what<00:00:58.010> sugar<00:00:58.610> is<00:00:58.880> and

00:00:59.639 --> 00:00:59.649 
educate people about what sugar is and

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:02.170 
educate people about what sugar is and
celebrate<00:01:00.649> it<00:01:00.860> it's<00:01:01.040> a<00:01:01.190> lovely<00:01:01.370> ingredient<00:01:02.000> we
