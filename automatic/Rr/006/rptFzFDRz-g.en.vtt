think<00:03:16.600> um<00:03:16.959> well<00:03:17.560> why<00:03:17.890> I<00:03:17.920> really<00:03:18.190> like<00:03:18.370> the<00:03:18.520> idea

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:18.550 
think um well why I really like the idea

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:20.010 
think um well why I really like the idea
of<00:03:18.910> the<00:03:19.000> game<00:03:19.150> I<00:03:19.180> love<00:03:19.420> matching<00:03:19.840> up<00:03:19.930> the

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:20.020 
of the game I love matching up the

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:21.479 
of the game I love matching up the
symbols<00:03:20.380> and<00:03:20.560> you<00:03:20.650> know<00:03:20.770> you<00:03:20.830> can<00:03:21.070> also<00:03:21.220> do<00:03:21.400> the

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
symbols and you know you can also do the

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:23.010 
symbols and you know you can also do the
mirror<00:03:21.760> image<00:03:22.150> of<00:03:22.330> it<00:03:22.510> and<00:03:22.690> things<00:03:22.840> like<00:03:22.959> that

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:23.020 
mirror image of it and things like that

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.260 
mirror image of it and things like that
I<00:03:23.320> like<00:03:23.560> that<00:03:23.739> idea<00:03:23.860> but<00:03:24.640> when<00:03:24.970> we're<00:03:25.120> playing

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:25.270 
I like that idea but when we're playing

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:27.750 
I like that idea but when we're playing
multiplayer<00:03:25.690> it's<00:03:26.170> sort<00:03:26.410> of<00:03:26.500> by<00:03:27.340> the<00:03:27.400> time<00:03:27.640> it

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
multiplayer it's sort of by the time it

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.699 
multiplayer it's sort of by the time it
gets<00:03:27.820> back<00:03:28.060> around<00:03:28.330> to<00:03:28.630> you<00:03:28.720> you<00:03:29.230> feel<00:03:29.470> like

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
gets back around to you you feel like

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:31.770 
gets back around to you you feel like
the<00:03:29.920> entire<00:03:30.190> thing's<00:03:30.459> been<00:03:30.610> wiped<00:03:30.850> out<00:03:31.030> yes<00:03:31.390> I

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
the entire thing's been wiped out yes I

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.690 
the entire thing's been wiped out yes I
think<00:03:32.260> that<00:03:32.470> was<00:03:32.620> primarily<00:03:32.980> a<00:03:33.280> problem<00:03:33.580> with

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
think that was primarily a problem with

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.250 
think that was primarily a problem with
the<00:03:33.790> floor<00:03:34.030> player<00:03:34.239> deathmatch<00:03:34.780> mode<00:03:35.050> of<00:03:35.170> it

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
the floor player deathmatch mode of it

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:36.750 
the floor player deathmatch mode of it
yeah<00:03:35.440> because<00:03:35.920> you'd<00:03:36.220> have<00:03:36.400> three<00:03:36.640> other

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
yeah because you'd have three other

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:37.860 
yeah because you'd have three other
players<00:03:36.970> that<00:03:37.060> would<00:03:37.209> come<00:03:37.330> in<00:03:37.450> and<00:03:37.540> decimate

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
players that would come in and decimate

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.870 
players that would come in and decimate
your<00:03:37.900> PC<00:03:38.140> it<00:03:38.320> is<00:03:38.410> a<00:03:38.470> rather<00:03:38.770> small<00:03:39.040> boards<00:03:39.730> yeah

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
your PC it is a rather small boards yeah

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.430 
your PC it is a rather small boards yeah
with<00:03:40.090> more<00:03:40.300> players<00:03:40.540> it<00:03:40.720> does<00:03:40.840> get<00:03:41.020> cluttered

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
with more players it does get cluttered

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.140 
with more players it does get cluttered
but<00:03:41.560> yeah<00:03:41.860> at<00:03:42.010> the<00:03:42.130> same<00:03:42.160> time<00:03:42.550> the<00:03:42.700> game<00:03:42.880> does

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
but yeah at the same time the game does

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:44.580 
but yeah at the same time the game does
make<00:03:43.390> an<00:03:43.510> effort<00:03:43.840> to<00:03:43.959> make<00:03:44.080> it<00:03:44.200> more<00:03:44.350> about

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
make an effort to make it more about

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.680 
make an effort to make it more about
reaction<00:03:45.280> and<00:03:45.489> being<00:03:45.640> adaptive<00:03:46.209> rather<00:03:46.510> than

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
reaction and being adaptive rather than

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.360 
reaction and being adaptive rather than
planning<00:03:46.959> ahead<00:03:47.170> to<00:03:47.470> follow<00:03:47.769> well<00:03:48.160> that's<00:03:48.280> the

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
planning ahead to follow well that's the

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:49.590 
planning ahead to follow well that's the
thing<00:03:48.519> the<00:03:48.640> deathmatch<00:03:49.030> version<00:03:49.360> of<00:03:49.420> the<00:03:49.480> game

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
thing the deathmatch version of the game

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.330 
thing the deathmatch version of the game
is<00:03:49.690> very<00:03:49.959> different<00:03:50.380> to<00:03:50.590> the<00:03:50.620> high<00:03:50.860> form<00:03:51.130> one

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
is very different to the high form one

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:52.710 
is very different to the high form one
because<00:03:51.730> in<00:03:51.910> the<00:03:52.090> high<00:03:52.180> poem<00:03:52.390> you've<00:03:52.510> got<00:03:52.630> the

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
because in the high poem you've got the

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:53.850 
because in the high poem you've got the
two<00:03:52.900> players<00:03:53.230> trying<00:03:53.470> to<00:03:53.530> achieve<00:03:53.739> objectives

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:53.860 
two players trying to achieve objectives

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:55.440 
two players trying to achieve objectives
and<00:03:54.280> you're<00:03:54.400> very<00:03:54.519> likely<00:03:54.820> to<00:03:55.060> still<00:03:55.209> have<00:03:55.360> all

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
and you're very likely to still have all

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:56.640 
and you're very likely to still have all
your<00:03:55.540> pieces<00:03:55.750> there<00:03:56.080> at<00:03:56.170> the<00:03:56.260> end<00:03:56.350> of<00:03:56.440> a<00:03:56.470> time

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
your pieces there at the end of a time

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.850 
your pieces there at the end of a time
let's<00:03:56.920> see<00:03:57.420> it's<00:03:58.420> worth<00:03:58.660> more<00:03:58.930> than<00:03:59.170> actually

00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.860 
let's see it's worth more than actually

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:01.860 
let's see it's worth more than actually
killing<00:04:00.070> it<00:04:00.250> exactly<00:04:00.640> so<00:04:00.910> it<00:04:01.180> feels<00:04:01.510> like<00:04:01.690> two

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
killing it exactly so it feels like two

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:02.850 
killing it exactly so it feels like two
very<00:04:02.110> different<00:04:02.290> games<00:04:02.560> with<00:04:02.769> those

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:02.860 
very different games with those

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:04.620 
very different games with those
different<00:04:03.190> game<00:04:03.310> and<00:04:03.940> to<00:04:04.060> say<00:04:04.209> I<00:04:04.239> actually

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 
different game and to say I actually

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:06.540 
different game and to say I actually
enjoyed<00:04:05.170> the<00:04:05.200> multiplayer<00:04:05.830> matching<00:04:06.250> more

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:06.550 
enjoyed the multiplayer matching more

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:08.130 
enjoyed the multiplayer matching more
than<00:04:06.940> the<00:04:07.060> high<00:04:07.209> form<00:04:07.540> we<00:04:07.690> played<00:04:07.900> the<00:04:08.019> height

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:08.140 
than the high form we played the height

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.809 
than the high form we played the height
mum<00:04:08.290> come<00:04:08.470> here

00:04:08.809 --> 00:04:08.819 
mum come here

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:10.640 
mum come here
it<00:04:09.060> was<00:04:09.180> good<00:04:09.450> but<00:04:10.019> then<00:04:10.230> I<00:04:10.260> was<00:04:10.499> like<00:04:10.590> oh

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
it was good but then I was like oh

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.199 
it was good but then I was like oh
multiplayer<00:04:11.129> modes<00:04:11.370> and<00:04:11.430> only<00:04:11.609> tacked<00:04:11.879> on<00:04:12.060> in

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
multiplayer modes and only tacked on in

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:13.339 
multiplayer modes and only tacked on in
these<00:04:12.299> kind<00:04:12.540> of<00:04:12.599> games<00:04:12.719> but<00:04:13.019> yeah<00:04:13.200> the

00:04:13.339 --> 00:04:13.349 
these kind of games but yeah the

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:14.959 
these kind of games but yeah the
deathmatch<00:04:13.680> is<00:04:13.829> easier<00:04:14.069> it<00:04:14.159> was<00:04:14.370> more<00:04:14.639> fun

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:14.969 
deathmatch is easier it was more fun

00:04:14.969 --> 00:04:17.810 
deathmatch is easier it was more fun
that<00:04:15.209> way<00:04:15.389> yeah<00:04:16.190> well<00:04:17.190> my<00:04:17.340> thoughts<00:04:17.579> on<00:04:17.729> the

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
that way yeah well my thoughts on the

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.670 
that way yeah well my thoughts on the
game<00:04:17.970> were<00:04:18.180> we're<00:04:18.690> pretty<00:04:18.810> much<00:04:18.930> somewhere<00:04:19.470> in

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
game were we're pretty much somewhere in

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.890 
game were we're pretty much somewhere in
the<00:04:19.829> middle<00:04:20.160> there<00:04:20.579> to<00:04:21.150> me<00:04:21.239> I<00:04:21.329> really<00:04:21.630> like<00:04:21.780> the

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
the middle there to me I really like the

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.719 
the middle there to me I really like the
high<00:04:22.019> form<00:04:22.320> the<00:04:22.650> strategy<00:04:23.100> aspect<00:04:23.310> of<00:04:23.639> it

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:23.729 
high form the strategy aspect of it

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:25.249 
high form the strategy aspect of it
always<00:04:24.000> see<00:04:24.180> the<00:04:24.360> objectives<00:04:24.750> coming<00:04:24.990> up<00:04:25.110> and

00:04:25.249 --> 00:04:25.259 
always see the objectives coming up and

00:04:25.259 --> 00:04:27.770 
always see the objectives coming up and
trying<00:04:25.320> to<00:04:25.560> fulfill<00:04:26.099> them<00:04:26.310> in<00:04:26.430> clever<00:04:27.300> ways<00:04:27.360> to

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
trying to fulfill them in clever ways to

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.629 
trying to fulfill them in clever ways to
summarize<00:04:28.229> you<00:04:28.440> know<00:04:28.740> there's<00:04:28.979> so<00:04:29.099> much<00:04:29.250> going

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:29.639 
summarize you know there's so much going

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:31.249 
summarize you know there's so much going
on<00:04:29.729> in<00:04:29.849> this<00:04:29.940> game<00:04:30.180> that<00:04:30.479> and<00:04:30.630> every<00:04:30.930> time<00:04:30.960> it's

00:04:31.249 --> 00:04:31.259 
on in this game that and every time it's

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:32.210 
on in this game that and every time it's
different<00:04:31.470> in<00:04:31.710> each<00:04:31.770> of<00:04:31.949> these<00:04:32.009> different

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
different in each of these different

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.310 
different in each of these different
cards<00:04:32.729> look<00:04:33.330> amazing<00:04:33.720> I<00:04:33.780> mean<00:04:33.810> we<00:04:34.050> didn't<00:04:34.229> even

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 
cards look amazing I mean we didn't even

00:04:59.089 --> 00:04:59.099 
line up the shapes and symbols I mean it

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:00.350 
line up the shapes and symbols I mean it
doesn't<00:04:59.340> always<00:04:59.460> work<00:04:59.580> I<00:04:59.940> mean<00:05:00.060> you've<00:05:00.180> got

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 
doesn't always work I mean you've got

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:01.999 
doesn't always work I mean you've got
the<00:05:00.690> two-headed<00:05:01.080> dragon<00:05:01.199> which<00:05:01.590> just<00:05:01.830> looks

00:05:01.999 --> 00:05:02.009 
the two-headed dragon which just looks

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:05.029 
the two-headed dragon which just looks
like<00:05:02.070> it's<00:05:02.820> got<00:05:02.970> two<00:05:03.120> in<00:05:03.270> it<00:05:03.470> to<00:05:04.470> the<00:05:04.560> side<00:05:04.770> I

00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:05.039 
like it's got two in it to the side I

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:07.100 
like it's got two in it to the side I
suppose<00:05:05.130> yeah<00:05:05.699> I<00:05:06.509> mean<00:05:06.660> there's<00:05:06.840> a<00:05:06.900> lot<00:05:06.990> of

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.110 
suppose yeah I mean there's a lot of

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:08.689 
suppose yeah I mean there's a lot of
effort<00:05:07.320> been<00:05:07.440> done<00:05:07.620> here<00:05:07.830> so<00:05:08.009> autumn<00:05:08.430> I<00:05:08.490> think

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:08.699 
effort been done here so autumn I think

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:09.980 
effort been done here so autumn I think
this<00:05:08.789> is<00:05:08.940> definitely<00:05:09.060> a<00:05:09.419> game<00:05:09.690> for<00:05:09.870> your
