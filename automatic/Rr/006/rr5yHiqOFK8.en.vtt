00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:25.640 
with this so anyways the last bit that

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.150 
with this so anyways the last bit that
Bolling<00:04:26.510> said<00:04:26.840> was<00:04:27.080> how<00:04:27.410> you<00:04:27.470> choose<00:04:27.770> to<00:04:27.800> start

Bolling said was how you choose to start

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.830 
Bolling said was how you choose to start
in<00:04:28.280> the<00:04:28.370> world<00:04:28.520> would<00:04:28.729> determine<00:04:29.090> how<00:04:29.539> you<00:04:29.599> can

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
in the world would determine how you can

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.370 
in the world would determine how you can
engage<00:04:30.169> and<00:04:30.530> it<00:04:30.800> impacts<00:04:31.250> the<00:04:31.370> scenarios

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:32.380

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:34.020 
engage and it impacts the scenarios
that<00:04:32.560> you<00:04:32.770> will<00:04:33.100> be<00:04:33.280> presented<00:04:33.850> with<00:04:33.880> a

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
that you will be presented with a

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:37.080 
that you will be presented with a
physical<00:04:34.540> and<00:04:34.810> morality<00:04:35.200> level<00:04:35.860> now<00:04:36.100> it<00:04:36.760> kind

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
physical and morality level now it kind

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.110 
physical and morality level now it kind
of<00:04:37.150> sounds<00:04:37.480> like<00:04:38.640> there's<00:04:39.640> gonna<00:04:39.730> be<00:04:39.910> a<00:04:39.940> lot<00:04:40.090> of

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
of sounds like there's gonna be a lot of

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.200 
of sounds like there's gonna be a lot of
decision-making<00:04:40.930> and<00:04:41.440> you<00:04:42.430> know<00:04:42.550> what<00:04:43.090> you

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
decision-making and you know what you

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:45.000 
decision-making and you know what you

impact<00:04:45.430> the<00:04:45.670> end<00:04:45.820> result<00:04:46.210> so<00:04:46.590> whether<00:04:47.590> it's<00:04:47.800> a

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:47.920 
impact the end result so whether it's a

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.620 
impact the end result so whether it's a
multiplayer<00:04:48.250> exclusive<00:04:49.090> whether<00:04:49.420> it's<00:04:49.540> going

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:49.630 
multiplayer exclusive whether it's going

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:51.390 
multiplayer exclusive whether it's going
to<00:04:49.690> include<00:04:49.900> a<00:04:50.080> storyline<00:04:50.440> we<00:04:50.830> don't<00:04:51.040> know<00:04:51.160> yet
