00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
couple of months ago on the website I

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.900

contradictory<00:00:35.640> but<00:00:36.239> it<00:00:36.360> really<00:00:36.690> works<00:00:36.960> so

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
contradictory but it really works so

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.220 
contradictory but it really works so
when<00:00:37.649> I<00:00:37.680> heard<00:00:38.489> about<00:00:38.640> this<00:00:39.030> idea<00:00:39.480> for<00:00:39.840> mixing

your<00:00:43.230> cabinets<00:00:43.649> it<00:00:43.860> made<00:00:44.129> sense<00:00:44.340> to<00:00:44.489> me<00:00:44.610> and<00:00:44.700> I

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
your cabinets it made sense to me and I

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.970 
your cabinets it made sense to me and I
was<00:00:45.120> eager<00:00:45.329> to<00:00:45.390> give<00:00:45.570> it<00:00:45.719> to<00:00:45.809> try<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:46.710> like<00:00:46.890> I

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
was eager to give it to try and like I

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.290 
was eager to give it to try and like I
said<00:00:47.039> I<00:00:47.160> didn't<00:00:47.399> think<00:00:47.430> my<00:00:47.670> kitchen<00:00:47.969> cabinets

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300

said I didn't think my kitchen cabinets
were<00:00:48.420> that<00:00:48.570> bad<00:00:48.809> until<00:00:49.320> I<00:00:49.379> actually<00:00:49.680> tried<00:00:50.460> to

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
were that bad until I actually tried to

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.180 
were that bad until I actually tried to
stuff<00:00:50.879> on<00:00:51.180> it<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:51.629> it<00:00:52.320> was<00:00:52.440> amazing<00:00:52.530> how<00:00:52.890> much

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
stuff on it and it was amazing how much

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.760 
stuff on it and it was amazing how much
gunk<00:00:53.550> it<00:00:53.789> got<00:00:53.940> off<00:00:54.120> so<00:00:54.930> it's<00:00:55.110> basically<00:00:55.469> two

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
gunk it got off so it's basically two

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.860 
gunk it got off so it's basically two
ingredient<00:00:56.250> I'm<00:00:56.430> all<00:00:56.670> about<00:00:56.879> simple<00:00:57.480> things

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870
