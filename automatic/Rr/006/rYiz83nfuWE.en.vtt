like<00:02:05.680> they're<00:02:05.860> very<00:02:05.890> subtly<00:02:06.659> addressed<00:02:07.659> but<00:02:08.020> I

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
like they're very subtly addressed but I

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.440 
like they're very subtly addressed but I
liked<00:02:08.349> the<00:02:08.590> way<00:02:08.709> that<00:02:08.920> it<00:02:09.340> kind<00:02:09.459> of<00:02:09.610> goes<00:02:10.090> about

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450

it and I like how it will go in the
future<00:02:12.970> like<00:02:13.209> I<00:02:13.420> think<00:02:13.630> it'll<00:02:14.530> be<00:02:14.800> really

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
future like I think it'll be really

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.820

much<00:05:17.080> going<00:05:17.530> on<00:05:17.620> especially<00:05:18.190> because<00:05:18.310> it's

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:18.520 
much going on especially because it's

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:19.770 
much going on especially because it's
not<00:05:18.669> gonna<00:05:18.790> why<00:05:18.880> I<00:05:18.910> think<00:05:19.210> maybe<00:05:19.360> it<00:05:19.510> was<00:05:19.630> in

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:19.780 
not gonna why I think maybe it was in

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:21.360 
not gonna why I think maybe it was in
color<00:05:20.020> it<00:05:20.560> would<00:05:20.680> be<00:05:20.800> better<00:05:20.950> I<00:05:21.040> think<00:05:21.280> the

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:21.370 
color it would be better I think the

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:22.350 
color it would be better I think the
whole<00:05:21.490> book<00:05:21.700> would<00:05:21.880> have<00:05:21.970> been<00:05:22.060> better<00:05:22.180> in

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:22.360 
whole book would have been better in

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.570 
whole book would have been better in
color<00:05:22.570> I<00:05:22.840> did<00:05:23.260> like<00:05:23.500> it<00:05:23.530> at<00:05:23.890> black<00:05:24.100> and<00:05:24.250> white<00:05:24.400> I

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:24.580 
color I did like it at black and white I

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:27.240 
color I did like it at black and white I
just<00:05:24.610> think<00:05:25.060> that<00:05:25.360> some<00:05:26.200> pages<00:05:26.710> like<00:05:26.950> the<00:05:27.130> one

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:27.250 
just think that some pages like the one

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:28.409 
just think that some pages like the one
that<00:05:27.400> I<00:05:27.460> showed<00:05:27.640> you<00:05:27.669> before<00:05:27.820> should<00:05:28.240> be

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:28.419 
that I showed you before should be

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:30.090 
that I showed you before should be
simplified<00:05:29.050> a<00:05:29.080> little<00:05:29.350> bit<00:05:29.440> more<00:05:29.620> because<00:05:29.770> it

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:30.100 
simplified a little bit more because it

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:32.310 
simplified a little bit more because it
was<00:05:30.190> a<00:05:30.220> black<00:05:30.430> and<00:05:30.460> white<00:05:30.669> but<00:05:31.479> overall<00:05:31.810> I<00:05:32.110> love
