and<00:02:07.220> I<00:02:07.250> think<00:02:07.460> they<00:02:07.580> finally<00:02:08.000> got<00:02:08.149> it<00:02:08.390> now<00:02:08.840> it's

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
and I think they finally got it now it's

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:10.509 
and I think they finally got it now it's
also<00:02:09.440> important<00:02:09.800> to<00:02:09.830> note<00:02:10.009> that<00:02:10.190> some<00:02:10.369> of<00:02:10.459> the

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:10.519 
also important to note that some of the

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:12.910 
also important to note that some of the
dolls<00:02:10.700> do<00:02:10.970> not<00:02:11.150> have<00:02:11.450> great<00:02:11.870> hair<00:02:12.140> some<00:02:12.769> of

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
dolls do not have great hair some of

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.550 
dolls do not have great hair some of
them<00:02:13.040> they're<00:02:13.489> their<00:02:14.450> bangs<00:02:14.780> up<00:02:15.080> here<00:02:15.319> just

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
them they're their bangs up here just

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
are flat some of them have way too big

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.300 
are flat some of them have way too big
and<00:02:17.989> they're<00:02:18.110> like<00:02:18.290> out<00:02:18.470> here<00:02:18.500> and<00:02:19.099> she<00:02:19.220> looks

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
and they're like out here and she looks

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:20.800 
and they're like out here and she looks
like<00:02:19.430> she's<00:02:19.610> a<00:02:19.730> giant<00:02:20.030> heart<00:02:20.209> on<00:02:20.390> her<00:02:20.569> head

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
like she's a giant heart on her head

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.199 
like she's a giant heart on her head
this<00:02:21.440> one<00:02:21.739> I<00:02:21.769> picked<00:02:22.129> because<00:02:22.400> she<00:02:22.909> just<00:02:23.120> had

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
this one I picked because she just had

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:24.880 
this one I picked because she just had
the<00:02:23.420> best<00:02:23.599> hair<00:02:23.780> of<00:02:23.840> them<00:02:23.959> all<00:02:24.080> so<00:02:24.680> what

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
the best hair of them all so what

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.619 
the best hair of them all so what
they've<00:02:25.040> done<00:02:25.069> with<00:02:25.550> the<00:02:25.730> bangs<00:02:25.940> this<00:02:26.180> time<00:02:26.420> is

00:02:26.619 --> 00:02:26.629 
they've done with the bangs this time is

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:28.899 
they've done with the bangs this time is
they<00:02:26.780> pulled<00:02:26.989> them<00:02:27.140> up<00:02:27.170> and<00:02:27.560> they<00:02:28.310> twirled

00:02:28.899 --> 00:02:28.909 
they pulled them up and they twirled

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:30.820 
they pulled them up and they twirled
them<00:02:29.209> here<00:02:29.599> in<00:02:29.780> the<00:02:29.870> back<00:02:30.080> so<00:02:30.110> it<00:02:30.440> kind<00:02:30.620> of<00:02:30.650> does

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
them here in the back so it kind of does

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.309 
them here in the back so it kind of does
this<00:02:31.010> twist<00:02:31.370> and<00:02:31.670> it<00:02:32.060> goes<00:02:32.240> into<00:02:32.540> a<00:02:32.750> separate

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:33.319 
this twist and it goes into a separate

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:35.220 
this twist and it goes into a separate
braid<00:02:33.650> back<00:02:33.980> here<00:02:34.400> so

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
braid back here so

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:36.690 
braid back here so
main<00:02:35.409> part<00:02:35.620> of<00:02:35.739> the<00:02:35.830> hair<00:02:36.040> is<00:02:36.190> twisted<00:02:36.610> off

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
main part of the hair is twisted off

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.640 
main part of the hair is twisted off
into<00:02:36.970> this<00:02:37.060> braid<00:02:37.330> right<00:02:37.480> here<00:02:37.540> and<00:02:38.019> then<00:02:38.470> both

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
into this braid right here and then both

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.680 
into this braid right here and then both
twists<00:02:39.190> come<00:02:39.370> off<00:02:39.519> in<00:02:39.730> a<00:02:39.819> separate<00:02:40.150> braid<00:02:40.390> so

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
twists come off in a separate braid so

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.390 
twists come off in a separate braid so
if<00:02:40.840> you<00:02:40.989> ever<00:02:41.230> want<00:02:41.680> to<00:02:41.739> play<00:02:41.830> with<00:02:42.129> the<00:02:42.220> hair

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
if you ever want to play with the hair

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.600 
if you ever want to play with the hair
do<00:02:43.060> not<00:02:43.090> screw<00:02:43.690> up<00:02:43.720> this<00:02:44.409> top<00:02:44.709> elastic<00:02:45.310> because

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
do not screw up this top elastic because

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.309 
do not screw up this top elastic because
it<00:02:45.760> holds<00:02:45.909> everything<00:02:46.390> into<00:02:46.690> place<00:02:46.810> and<00:02:47.230> if

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:47.319 
it holds everything into place and if

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:48.809 
it holds everything into place and if
you<00:02:47.440> mess<00:02:47.650> that<00:02:47.799> up<00:02:47.860> you're<00:02:48.099> gonna<00:02:48.190> have<00:02:48.430> flat

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:48.819 
you mess that up you're gonna have flat

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:51.360 
you mess that up you're gonna have flat
dull<00:02:49.090> hair<00:02:49.470> and<00:02:50.470> you'll<00:02:50.620> regret<00:02:50.769> it<00:02:51.069> first

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
dull hair and you'll regret it first

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.400 
dull hair and you'll regret it first
your<00:02:51.549> life<00:02:51.700> there's<00:02:52.180> so<00:02:52.660> much<00:02:52.810> glitter<00:02:53.049> in<00:02:53.290> my

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
your life there's so much glitter in my

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.009 
your life there's so much glitter in my
eye<00:02:53.440> I<00:02:53.620> can<00:02:54.190> feel<00:02:54.459> it<00:02:54.610> and<00:02:54.700> it's<00:02:54.819> bothering<00:02:55.629> me

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:56.019 
eye I can feel it and it's bothering me

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:58.020 
eye I can feel it and it's bothering me
next<00:02:56.349> I<00:02:56.410> updated<00:02:56.769> the<00:02:56.950> obvious<00:02:57.310> design<00:02:57.700> flaw

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
next I updated the obvious design flaw

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:59.580 
next I updated the obvious design flaw
of<00:02:58.239> her<00:02:58.390> necklace<00:02:58.840> which<00:02:59.019> is<00:02:59.170> actually

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
of her necklace which is actually

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.860 
of her necklace which is actually
plastic<00:02:59.860> this<00:03:00.340> time<00:03:00.580> and<00:03:00.879> they've<00:03:01.329> changed<00:03:01.660> up

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
plastic this time and they've changed up

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.569 
plastic this time and they've changed up
the<00:03:02.079> earrings<00:03:02.440> a<00:03:02.560> little<00:03:02.590> bit<00:03:02.890> unlike<00:03:03.400> the

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:03.579 
the earrings a little bit unlike the

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:06.210 
the earrings a little bit unlike the
last<00:03:03.849> one<00:03:04.180> where<00:03:04.480> they<00:03:05.019> were<00:03:05.079> more<00:03:05.650> bolted

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
last one where they were more bolted

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.400 
last one where they were more bolted
into<00:03:06.459> the<00:03:06.760> side<00:03:06.970> of<00:03:07.000> her<00:03:07.269> neck<00:03:07.540> these<00:03:08.079> ones

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
into the side of her neck these ones

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.559 
into the side of her neck these ones
look<00:03:08.530> like<00:03:08.890> they're<00:03:09.069> glued<00:03:09.549> into<00:03:09.849> place<00:03:10.030> so

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:10.569 
look like they're glued into place so

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:12.300 
look like they're glued into place so
they<00:03:10.690> don't<00:03:10.720> move<00:03:11.230> and<00:03:11.590> I<00:03:11.680> imagine<00:03:12.099> they<00:03:12.190> would

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
they don't move and I imagine they would

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:13.740 
they don't move and I imagine they would
probably<00:03:12.459> break<00:03:12.730> off<00:03:12.940> if<00:03:13.120> you<00:03:13.209> tried<00:03:13.420> to<00:03:13.540> move

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
probably break off if you tried to move

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.210 
probably break off if you tried to move
them<00:03:13.959> so<00:03:13.989> I'm<00:03:14.260> not<00:03:14.410> going<00:03:14.620> to<00:03:14.680> attempt<00:03:14.950> to<00:03:15.010> do

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
them so I'm not going to attempt to do

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.970 
them so I'm not going to attempt to do
it<00:03:15.340> I<00:03:15.519> like<00:03:16.120> the<00:03:16.329> plastic<00:03:16.599> necklace<00:03:17.109> although

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
it I like the plastic necklace although

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.440 
it I like the plastic necklace although
if<00:03:18.069> you<00:03:18.190> look<00:03:18.370> here<00:03:18.579> in<00:03:18.700> the<00:03:18.790> back<00:03:18.970> it<00:03:19.239> doesn't

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
if you look here in the back it doesn't

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.390 
if you look here in the back it doesn't
connect<00:03:19.840> all<00:03:19.989> the<00:03:20.109> way<00:03:20.200> through<00:03:20.560> so<00:03:21.129> I<00:03:21.160> mean

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
connect all the way through so I mean

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.309 
connect all the way through so I mean
you<00:03:21.489> can<00:03:21.640> take<00:03:21.790> it<00:03:21.910> off<00:03:22.030> but<00:03:22.420> if<00:03:22.810> you<00:03:23.019> take<00:03:23.200> off

00:03:23.309 --> 00:03:23.319 
you can take it off but if you take off

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:24.569 
you can take it off but if you take off
these<00:03:23.530> rubber<00:03:23.709> bands<00:03:23.980> that<00:03:24.160> are<00:03:24.190> holding<00:03:24.400> it

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:24.579 
these rubber bands that are holding it

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:26.610 
these rubber bands that are holding it
into<00:03:24.700> place<00:03:24.819> you<00:03:25.239> kind<00:03:25.480> of<00:03:25.569> don't<00:03:26.019> have<00:03:26.349> a

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
into place you kind of don't have a

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.199 
into place you kind of don't have a
necklace<00:03:26.950> anymore<00:03:27.310> because<00:03:27.489> it's<00:03:27.790> gonna<00:03:27.910> fall

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
necklace anymore because it's gonna fall

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:30.390 
necklace anymore because it's gonna fall
off<00:03:28.480> or<00:03:28.810> at<00:03:29.140> least<00:03:29.290> I<00:03:29.410> imagined<00:03:30.010> that<00:03:30.040> it<00:03:30.250> would

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
off or at least I imagined that it would

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.220 
off or at least I imagined that it would
I<00:03:30.459> don't<00:03:30.640> imagine<00:03:31.000> it<00:03:31.390> would<00:03:31.510> stick<00:03:31.780> in<00:03:31.959> place

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
I don't imagine it would stick in place

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:33.479 
I don't imagine it would stick in place
like<00:03:32.470> the<00:03:32.500> way<00:03:32.650> it's<00:03:32.829> supposed<00:03:33.160> to<00:03:33.310> if<00:03:33.400> you

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
like the way it's supposed to if you

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:35.580 
like the way it's supposed to if you
took<00:03:33.609> those<00:03:33.819> rubber<00:03:33.970> bands<00:03:34.269> off<00:03:34.480> I<00:03:34.720> love<00:03:35.349> the

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
took those rubber bands off I love the

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.830 
took those rubber bands off I love the
way<00:03:35.739> that<00:03:35.769> her<00:03:36.489> shoulders<00:03:36.970> come<00:03:37.299> off<00:03:37.450> to<00:03:37.720> the

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
way that her shoulders come off to the

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.509 
way that her shoulders come off to the
sides<00:03:38.079> and<00:03:38.410> it's<00:03:38.769> actually<00:03:39.040> much<00:03:39.160> tighter

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:39.519 
sides and it's actually much tighter

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:41.670 
sides and it's actually much tighter
than<00:03:39.760> the<00:03:39.880> previous<00:03:40.299> one<00:03:40.540> she<00:03:41.019> has<00:03:41.230> more<00:03:41.440> of<00:03:41.590> a

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
than the previous one she has more of a

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.650 
than the previous one she has more of a
v-neck<00:03:42.130> line<00:03:42.370> rather<00:03:42.639> than<00:03:42.790> a<00:03:42.940> straight<00:03:43.359> line

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
v-neck line rather than a straight line

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.449 
v-neck line rather than a straight line
and<00:03:43.959> she<00:03:44.109> has<00:03:44.290> none<00:03:44.590> of<00:03:44.620> the<00:03:44.769> gold<00:03:45.069> so<00:03:45.370> I'll

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
and she has none of the gold so I'll

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:47.699

people complain about this I however

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.650 
people complain about this I however
think<00:05:09.919> that<00:05:10.340> it's<00:05:10.520> really<00:05:10.850> pretty<00:05:11.180> I<00:05:11.300> think<00:05:11.479> it

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:11.660 
think that it's really pretty I think it

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:13.120 
think that it's really pretty I think it
looks<00:05:11.840> very<00:05:11.930> middle-eastern<00:05:12.650> I<00:05:12.800> think<00:05:13.010> it

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:13.130 
looks very middle-eastern I think it

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:15.520 
looks very middle-eastern I think it
looks<00:05:13.460> very<00:05:13.520> traditional<00:05:14.330> and<00:05:14.479> I<00:05:14.630> enjoy<00:05:15.229> this

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:15.530 
looks very traditional and I enjoy this

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:17.379 
looks very traditional and I enjoy this
piece<00:05:15.860> of<00:05:15.919> it<00:05:16.220> because<00:05:16.850> I<00:05:16.940> think<00:05:17.000> it<00:05:17.240> adds

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:17.389 
piece of it because I think it adds

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:19.779 
piece of it because I think it adds
something<00:05:17.870> to<00:05:18.050> it<00:05:18.260> that<00:05:18.949> the<00:05:19.190> previous<00:05:19.370> dolls

00:05:19.779 --> 00:05:19.789 
something to it that the previous dolls

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:22.120 
something to it that the previous dolls
didn't<00:05:20.240> really<00:05:20.479> have<00:05:20.720> as<00:05:21.050> well<00:05:21.470> as<00:05:21.650> this<00:05:21.889> doll

makeup on the new doll the new doll is a
little<00:05:57.470> more<00:05:57.650> of<00:05:57.919> natural<00:05:58.820> tones<00:05:59.120> and<00:05:59.450> they

00:05:59.560 --> 00:05:59.570 
little more of natural tones and they

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:02.230 
little more of natural tones and they
look<00:05:59.780> a<00:05:59.900> little<00:06:00.050> more<00:06:00.950> soft<00:06:01.639> and<00:06:02.000> subtle

look a little more soft and subtle

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:03.790 
look a little more soft and subtle
whereas<00:06:02.690> the<00:06:02.810> old<00:06:02.960> one<00:06:03.139> kinda<00:06:03.440> looks<00:06:03.470> a<00:06:03.770> bit

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:03.800 
whereas the old one kinda looks a bit

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.120 
whereas the old one kinda looks a bit
like<00:06:04.160> a<00:06:04.190> drag<00:06:04.580> queen<00:06:04.610> and<00:06:05.210> I<00:06:06.050> like<00:06:06.320> that<00:06:06.620> the

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:07.130 
like a drag queen and I like that the

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:08.680 
like a drag queen and I like that the
new<00:06:07.280> Jasmine's<00:06:07.789> eyes<00:06:07.940> are<00:06:08.210> a<00:06:08.240> little<00:06:08.479> bit

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:08.690 
new Jasmine's eyes are a little bit

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:11.409 
new Jasmine's eyes are a little bit
bigger<00:06:09.050> they<00:06:09.860> I<00:06:10.520> think<00:06:10.729> they<00:06:10.940> match<00:06:11.090> because

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:11.419 
bigger they I think they match because

00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:16.029 
bigger they I think they match because
her<00:06:11.599> head<00:06:11.810> is<00:06:11.840> bigger<00:06:12.970> quiet<00:06:13.970> children<00:06:15.039> across

00:06:16.029 --> 00:06:16.039 
her head is bigger quiet children across

00:06:16.039 --> 00:06:19.480 
her head is bigger quiet children across
the<00:06:16.160> street<00:06:17.889> there's<00:06:18.889> really<00:06:19.039> not<00:06:19.220> a<00:06:19.280> whole

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:19.490 
the street there's really not a whole

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:20.560 
the street there's really not a whole
lot<00:06:19.639> that<00:06:19.669> I<00:06:19.820> have<00:06:19.940> to<00:06:20.060> say<00:06:20.240> other<00:06:20.510> than

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:20.570 
lot that I have to say other than

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:22.240 
lot that I have to say other than
positive<00:06:21.229> things<00:06:21.440> for<00:06:21.650> the<00:06:21.710> new<00:06:21.830> Jasmine

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:22.250 
positive things for the new Jasmine

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:23.290 
positive things for the new Jasmine
because<00:06:22.490> I<00:06:22.520> think<00:06:22.669> that<00:06:22.880> they<00:06:23.090> really

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:23.300 
because I think that they really

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:25.350 
because I think that they really
executed<00:06:23.900> her<00:06:24.050> well<00:06:24.229> I<00:06:24.440> think<00:06:24.830> that<00:06:25.160> they

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:25.360 
executed her well I think that they

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.480 
executed her well I think that they
completed<00:06:26.360> her<00:06:26.780> in<00:06:27.050> a<00:06:27.139> way<00:06:27.320> that<00:06:27.680> I<00:06:27.889> have<00:06:28.280> not

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:28.490 
completed her in a way that I have not

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:30.159 
completed her in a way that I have not
seen<00:06:28.820> from<00:06:28.970> the<00:06:29.090> Disney<00:06:29.360> Store<00:06:29.630> with<00:06:29.930> other

00:06:30.159 --> 00:06:30.169 
seen from the Disney Store with other

00:06:30.169 --> 00:06:32.290 
seen from the Disney Store with other
versions<00:06:30.740> of<00:06:30.919> her<00:06:31.280> even<00:06:31.669> in<00:06:31.820> some<00:06:32.150> of<00:06:32.240> the

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:32.300 
versions of her even in some of the

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:33.969 
versions of her even in some of the
original<00:06:32.720> versions<00:06:33.080> I<00:06:33.199> remember<00:06:33.590> having<00:06:33.710> a

00:06:33.969 --> 00:06:33.979 
original versions I remember having a

00:06:33.979 --> 00:06:35.200 
original versions I remember having a
chives<00:06:34.310> Mendell<00:06:34.580> when<00:06:34.699> I<00:06:34.760> was<00:06:34.880> a<00:06:34.940> little

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:35.210 
chives Mendell when I was a little

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:37.689 
chives Mendell when I was a little
little<00:06:35.330> little<00:06:35.599> kid<00:06:35.900> and<00:06:36.139> even<00:06:36.919> then<00:06:37.310> they

00:06:37.689 --> 00:06:37.699 
little little kid and even then they

00:06:37.699 --> 00:06:38.980 
little little kid and even then they
didn't<00:06:38.030> really<00:06:38.270> even<00:06:38.419> look<00:06:38.720> like<00:06:38.750> the

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:38.990 
didn't really even look like the

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:40.689 
didn't really even look like the
characters<00:06:39.320> they<00:06:39.440> looked<00:06:39.650> so<00:06:39.979> much<00:06:40.130> more<00:06:40.370> doll

00:06:40.689 --> 00:06:40.699 
characters they looked so much more doll

00:06:40.699 --> 00:06:43.540 
characters they looked so much more doll
like<00:06:41.030> then<00:06:41.449> like<00:06:41.720> their<00:06:42.349> characters<00:06:43.070> and<00:06:43.340> so<00:06:43.520> I

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:43.550 
like then like their characters and so I

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:45.129 
like then like their characters and so I
think<00:06:43.669> that<00:06:43.910> they<00:06:44.000> really<00:06:44.300> captured<00:06:44.720> her<00:06:44.870> very

00:06:45.129 --> 00:06:45.139 
think that they really captured her very

00:06:45.139 --> 00:06:46.659 
think that they really captured her very
well<00:06:45.349> and<00:06:45.530> in<00:06:45.650> love<00:06:45.830> that<00:06:45.979> they<00:06:46.070> finally<00:06:46.400> got

00:06:46.659 --> 00:06:46.669 
well and in love that they finally got

00:06:46.669 --> 00:06:48.189 
well and in love that they finally got
the<00:06:46.820> hair<00:06:47.000> right<00:06:47.150> that<00:06:47.389> is<00:06:47.539> one<00:06:47.720> thing<00:06:47.990> that

00:06:48.189 --> 00:06:48.199 
the hair right that is one thing that

00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:50.830 
the hair right that is one thing that
the<00:06:48.860> new<00:06:49.039> dolls<00:06:49.520> have<00:06:49.849> done<00:06:50.090> an<00:06:50.389> excellent<00:06:50.660> job

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:50.840 
the new dolls have done an excellent job

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:52.659 
the new dolls have done an excellent job
in<00:06:50.990> is<00:06:51.289> that<00:06:51.440> they<00:06:51.530> really<00:06:51.950> captured<00:06:52.490> the

00:06:52.659 --> 00:06:52.669 
in is that they really captured the

00:06:52.669 --> 00:06:55.570 
in is that they really captured the
designs<00:06:53.479> of<00:06:53.810> the<00:06:54.080> hair<00:06:54.380> the<00:06:55.010> one<00:06:55.219> thing<00:06:55.430> that

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:55.580 
designs of the hair the one thing that

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:58.029 
designs of the hair the one thing that
they<00:06:55.700> didn't<00:06:56.150> do<00:06:56.390> that<00:06:56.870> I<00:06:56.900> noticed<00:06:57.620> is<00:06:57.860> that

00:06:58.029 --> 00:06:58.039 
they didn't do that I noticed is that

00:06:58.039 --> 00:07:00.580 
they didn't do that I noticed is that
Jasmine<00:06:58.700> also<00:06:58.969> has<00:06:59.150> a<00:06:59.450> swirly<00:06:59.930> that<00:07:00.110> comes<00:07:00.380> off

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:00.590 
Jasmine also has a swirly that comes off

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:02.230 
Jasmine also has a swirly that comes off
like<00:07:00.860> all<00:07:01.070> the<00:07:01.190> other<00:07:01.310> princesses<00:07:01.490> they've

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:02.240 
like all the other princesses they've

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:03.880 
like all the other princesses they've
been<00:07:02.419> modified<00:07:02.690> so<00:07:03.169> they<00:07:03.320> have<00:07:03.469> like<00:07:03.710> this

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:03.890 
been modified so they have like this

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:05.380 
been modified so they have like this
swirly<00:07:04.370> strand<00:07:04.700> of<00:07:04.789> hair<00:07:04.880> that<00:07:05.060> comes<00:07:05.240> off

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:05.390 
swirly strand of hair that comes off

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:08.860 
swirly strand of hair that comes off
Jasmine<00:07:05.810> didn't<00:07:06.050> get<00:07:06.229> that<00:07:06.440> I<00:07:06.909> kind<00:07:07.909> of<00:07:08.000> like

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:08.870 
Jasmine didn't get that I kind of like

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:10.750 
Jasmine didn't get that I kind of like
that<00:07:09.110> though<00:07:09.349> I'm<00:07:09.830> totally<00:07:10.280> okay<00:07:10.550> with<00:07:10.580> it

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:10.760 
that though I'm totally okay with it

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:12.070 
that though I'm totally okay with it
because<00:07:10.909> I<00:07:11.060> like<00:07:11.330> the<00:07:11.479> traditional<00:07:11.599> hair

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:12.080 
because I like the traditional hair

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:13.690 
because I like the traditional hair
rather<00:07:12.289> than<00:07:12.530> the<00:07:12.680> new<00:07:12.800> stylized<00:07:13.310> version<00:07:13.610> of

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:13.700 
rather than the new stylized version of

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:16.270 
rather than the new stylized version of
her<00:07:13.820> hair<00:07:14.030> so<00:07:14.780> I<00:07:15.139> will<00:07:15.590> say<00:07:15.770> that<00:07:15.919> the<00:07:16.130> new

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:16.280 
her hair so I will say that the new

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:18.010 
her hair so I will say that the new
dolls<00:07:16.520> really<00:07:16.909> got<00:07:17.060> the<00:07:17.240> hair<00:07:17.419> right<00:07:17.630> and<00:07:17.930> I

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:18.020 
dolls really got the hair right and I

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:19.149 
dolls really got the hair right and I
think<00:07:18.229> they<00:07:18.320> really<00:07:18.440> captured<00:07:18.919> what<00:07:18.950> they

00:07:19.149 --> 00:07:19.159 
think they really captured what they

00:07:19.159 --> 00:07:21.580 
think they really captured what they
were<00:07:19.219> going<00:07:19.460> for<00:07:19.719> because<00:07:20.719> they<00:07:20.960> redesigned

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:21.590

the dolls they redesigned the image of
the<00:07:23.750> princesses<00:07:24.139> and<00:07:24.500> they<00:07:24.740> followed<00:07:25.099> through

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:25.340 
the princesses and they followed through

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:27.159 
the princesses and they followed through
completely<00:07:25.969> with<00:07:26.120> the<00:07:26.240> dolls<00:07:26.450> so<00:07:26.900> because<00:07:27.139> I
