00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.640
 Good day to you Chelsea faces 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.859
 want to show you will be the absolute kind 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:10.230
 a rival came to us well, not that 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:13.170
 worthy and see it more than 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.660
 worthy of a variety of top clan and gathered 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:19.949
 so we can bend the same power 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.710
 the skill of the hands of thought went against us well yes 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:26.460
 ok, let's try to fight 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:29.189
 our sheets rush to the river there meet 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.579
 bochata who got out of the way 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.260
 safely dismantled him because he 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.620
 in general there was no one in him 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.129
 he can not help and he safely 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.329
 goes to the hangar 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:44.100
 your humble servant controls the glacier 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:46.559
 helps him in this background principle 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.140
 positions are occupied and then lit up 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.710
 a huge huge amount of enemy 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.379
 st 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.809
 what they want to do is not clear to anyone 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.690
 whether they decide the hour the glacier whether she 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.210
 she says well basically they decided 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.989
 just gather under the bridge and show 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.370
 our kids where the crabs spend the winter right 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.460
 play and how to 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:10.560
 bend and tear well apparently 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.170
 them it is not very good yet 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.560
 because they grab one splat at 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.670
 one 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:21.630
 but they are essentially nothing special put they 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:24.720
 made are lit xii century and seven 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.910
 there is potter and kind of guys thought so but 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.860
 here in short we do not go through it, not all 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:31.140
 losses and generally it's some kind of freak 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.300
 against us came out feels they are tired 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.850
 they don't let us drive until now we're behind 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:38.730
 this is a pair of rashim on a glacier we will capture 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.430
 and all kill here watch returns 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:46.460
 back I'm still controlling he sprue 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:50.330
 not to miss the rise to our base 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:54.600
 our tanks keep the stream safely 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:57.150
 here the game starts as a swing who 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.900
 outwit someone who pops out 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:03.750
 rebound who will break well at the moment 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:06.570
 they don't catch ricochets they stupidly catch 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:11.550
 shells and go to the hangar here I 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:13.640
 I lit up the patent and Dad and it seems like 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.620
 are going to our base quickly 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:19.020
 return the kidneys and me too 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.630
 come back I will climb on 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.850
 slide for illuminating the center of the map 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:28.050
 still controlled by a mine 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:31.620
 In principle, we dominate both php and 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:33.770
 number of vehicles here tanchiki 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.560
 come back 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:40.930
 Now we will meet those heroes 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.930
 who fly to us to capture 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:47.450
 still on the center of the map 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:50.090
 continues the shootout well it's not even 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:56.260
 shootout i would say this some kind of you 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:59.960
 we are here with one rival 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:03.020
 they slowly run from the base of one prank 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:05.060
 they have already gone to the hangar the rest 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:07.460
 something there trying to do something there 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:10.160
 spinning-spinning the camera I do not translate 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:11.750
 toadstool because after all the main 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:19.330
 the battle at the moment will be 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:24.050
 happen here so here st rival 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:26.720
 slowly synchronously dying on the glacier 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:32.330
 essentially all the equipment they have left only in 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:34.730
 the mouth of the river and there is already a matter of their technology 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.320
 squeeze and crush because in essence 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.650
 they were trapped 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:43.190
 because all the tanks they have around 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:46.270
 we died and died and burned down we 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:49.810
 let's push down from the glacier 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:54.770
 pick up bochata that bothers us 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:58.550
 hereinafter, we are picking up everything 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:04:02.740
 and and see the tanks remained trapped 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:04.610
 here watch show the crown chip 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:08.150
 practically kills 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:12.760
 its mass st kills another shot 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:16.760
 In principle, it turned out worthy and beautiful 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:19.160
 there is one 60 deuce which principle 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:21.830
 now long left her and took 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:25.550
 140 object left ask me to notice 

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:28.280
 gentlemen against us came out very well 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:32.720
 good and strong such composition in terms of 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:36.500
 players look at the score either guys 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:39.160
 themselves overestimated or we turned out already 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:43.550
 so good they deserve it 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:46.900
 epic just win everyone good luck up 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:46.900
 new meetings yet bye
