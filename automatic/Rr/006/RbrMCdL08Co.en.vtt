the other week and I'm actually got a
couple<00:00:32.029> of<00:00:32.210> games<00:00:32.419> I<00:00:32.720> first<00:00:33.020> one<00:00:33.170> was<00:00:33.290> this<00:00:33.380> one

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:33.620 
couple of games I first one was this one

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.620 
couple of games I first one was this one
wait<00:00:34.520> sure<00:00:34.700> one<00:00:34.880> of<00:00:34.910> my<00:00:35.000> subscribers<00:00:35.210> asked

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:35.630 
wait sure one of my subscribers asked

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.290 
wait sure one of my subscribers asked
for<00:00:35.780> an<00:00:35.840> LMG<00:00:36.230> Mobe<00:00:36.470> and<00:00:36.739> here<00:00:37.040> it<00:00:37.130> is<00:00:37.160> this<00:00:37.940> is<00:00:38.120> I

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300 
for an LMG Mobe and here it is this is I

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.360 
for an LMG Mobe and here it is this is I
think<00:00:38.390> probably<00:00:38.720> the<00:00:38.900> most<00:00:39.020> usable<00:00:39.410> LMG<00:00:39.890> well

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370 
think probably the most usable LMG well

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.690 
think probably the most usable LMG well
in<00:00:40.520> my<00:00:40.640> opinion<00:00:40.730> I<00:00:41.060> think<00:00:41.090> it's<00:00:41.690> the<00:00:41.720> best<00:00:41.870> one

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:42.700 
in my opinion I think it's the best one

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.040 
in my opinion I think it's the best one
but<00:00:43.700> I<00:00:43.760> have<00:00:44.030> had<00:00:44.180> to<00:00:44.300> resort<00:00:44.510> to<00:00:44.630> changing<00:00:44.960> my

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.050 
but I have had to resort to changing my

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:46.330 
but I have had to resort to changing my
play<00:00:45.260> style<00:00:45.500> slightly<00:00:45.920> in<00:00:46.010> the<00:00:46.040> fact<00:00:46.280> that

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:46.340 
play style slightly in the fact that

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.390 
play style slightly in the fact that
i've<00:00:46.810> resorted<00:00:47.810> to<00:00:48.080> using<00:00:48.170> stalk<00:00:48.590> were<00:00:48.830> first

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:49.400 
i've resorted to using stalk were first

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.610 
i've resorted to using stalk were first
here<00:00:49.640> first<00:00:50.030> thing<00:00:50.090> first<00:00:50.810> unlock<00:00:51.200> northwest

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
here first thing first unlock northwest

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.590 
here first thing first unlock northwest
unlocker<00:00:52.040> a<00:00:52.340> substandard<00:00:52.790> work<00:00:53.090> but<00:00:53.330> I<00:00:53.360> use

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
unlocker a substandard work but I use

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.200 
unlocker a substandard work but I use
when<00:00:53.750> I<00:00:53.810> start<00:00:54.110> out<00:00:54.290> which<00:00:55.100> I<00:00:55.370> don't<00:00:55.760> ever<00:00:55.970> use

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 
when I start out which I don't ever use

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.780 
when I start out which I don't ever use
I<00:00:56.270> think<00:00:56.570> it's<00:00:56.690> a<00:00:56.750> horrible<00:00:57.050> perk<00:00:57.320> but<00:00:57.650> i<00:00:57.890> feel

00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:58.790 
I think it's a horrible perk but i feel

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.510 
I think it's a horrible perk but i feel
that<00:00:58.990> LMGs<00:00:59.990> are<00:01:00.110> quite<00:01:00.350> disadvantage<00:01:00.950> so<00:01:01.130> I'll

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:01.520 
that LMGs are quite disadvantage so I'll

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.460 
that LMGs are quite disadvantage so I'll
give<00:01:01.700> myself<00:01:01.850> that<00:01:02.210> advantage<00:01:02.450> and<00:01:02.870> also<00:01:03.320> i'm

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470 
give myself that advantage and also i'm

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.439 
give myself that advantage and also i'm
using<00:01:03.770> recon<00:01:04.129> pros<00:01:04.460> quite<00:01:04.790> an<00:01:04.879> early<00:01:05.119> unlock

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:05.449 
using recon pros quite an early unlock

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:07.390 
using recon pros quite an early unlock
on<00:01:05.630> the<00:01:05.659> specialist<00:01:06.229> thing<00:01:06.409> which<00:01:07.100> i<00:01:07.220> think<00:01:07.280> is

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400 
on the specialist thing which i think is

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.969 
on the specialist thing which i think is
really<00:01:07.580> underrated<00:01:07.970> perk<00:01:08.540> um<00:01:08.780> it's<00:01:09.710> still<00:01:09.890> not

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:09.979 
really underrated perk um it's still not

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:12.010 
really underrated perk um it's still not
the<00:01:10.040> most<00:01:10.189> it's<00:01:10.670> no<00:01:10.820> not<00:01:11.060> the<00:01:11.210> best<00:01:11.540> perk<00:01:11.869> I

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
the most it's no not the best perk I

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.950 
the most it's no not the best perk I
usually<00:01:12.290> run<00:01:12.409> scavenger<00:01:12.950> in<00:01:13.040> this<00:01:13.189> lot<00:01:13.400> but

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:13.960 
usually run scavenger in this lot but

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.820 
usually run scavenger in this lot but
considering<00:01:14.960> the<00:01:14.990> LMT<00:01:15.409> I<00:01:15.440> didn't<00:01:15.650> think<00:01:15.740> I

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830 
considering the LMT I didn't think I

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:17.560 
considering the LMT I didn't think I
really<00:01:16.040> needed<00:01:16.190> scavenger<00:01:16.790> so<00:01:17.000> I<00:01:17.030> decided<00:01:17.510> to

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
really needed scavenger so I decided to

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.560 
really needed scavenger so I decided to
whack<00:01:17.780> on<00:01:18.220> week<00:01:19.220> on<00:01:19.430> instead<00:01:19.730> which<00:01:19.970> is<00:01:20.210> a

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
whack on week on instead which is a

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.960 
whack on week on instead which is a
brilliant<00:01:20.930> /<00:01:21.290> like<00:01:21.650> if<00:01:21.860> you<00:01:21.950> get<00:01:22.100> at<00:01:22.610> the<00:01:22.760> start

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:22.970 
brilliant / like if you get at the start

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:24.460 
brilliant / like if you get at the start
of<00:01:23.000> the<00:01:23.090> game<00:01:23.210> you<00:01:23.360> can<00:01:23.570> get<00:01:23.690> flash<00:01:24.020> grenade<00:01:24.350> in

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.470 
of the game you can get flash grenade in

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:25.990 
of the game you can get flash grenade in
the<00:01:24.530> right<00:01:24.680> point<00:01:24.860> you<00:01:25.580> can<00:01:25.760> pretty<00:01:25.940> much

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
the right point you can pretty much

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.520 
the right point you can pretty much
flash<00:01:26.360> the<00:01:26.540> whole<00:01:26.659> of<00:01:26.690> their<00:01:26.960> team<00:01:27.140> and<00:01:27.380> get

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
flash the whole of their team and get

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.469
