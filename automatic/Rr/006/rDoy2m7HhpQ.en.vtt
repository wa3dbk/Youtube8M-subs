00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:08.130
 hello my name is romance 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:10.620
 snow white i am a stylist and we are on 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.870
 the third floor of department stores from the goals of cycl and 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.309
 In this report, I would like to give you 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.010
 one very good advice 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:21.630
 the fact is that summer is the time 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:23.789
 when you need to take care of buying the top 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.210
 clothes for fall you all know the saying 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.279
 prepare the sleigh in the summer so now is the time to cook 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.090
 because in the summer you can 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:35.250
 first to find the size that suits you 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:38.610
 the style that suits you and most importantly the color 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:42.600
 the solution is well and on the example of our model 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:46.020
 Alina we now see it looks like 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:49.110
 chic lovely stripe coat 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.760
 transparent buttons are those elements that 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.670
 will always be relevant 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.190
 and if you are really a bright personality 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.190
 then you will never be afraid to choose 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:02.550
 bright clothes and if you are more modest 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.660
 personality then you choose more calm 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.170
 color combination 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:12.420
 but as you yourself understand all the trends 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:14.580
 fashion requires constant changes and me 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.630
 It seems that the lines fit this one. 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:21.000
 experiment, I really like 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:23.850
 note that the coat blends 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.770
 with a calm silk blouse is not necessary 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.009
 no floristic print 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:32.159
 flowers of ornaments if of course you want 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:34.950
 make some kind of super creative 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:38.549
 mix then you can wear any first layer 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:42.060
 clothes and in terms of trousers fit 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:45.990
 green white black pink yes what 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:48.990
 please such a creative outfit I think not 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.570
 meet on the street on ordinary days it's like 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.640
 outfit times for mood and 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.130
 when we see a man in such bright 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:01.590
 shades and then our mood too 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:03.210
 rises in department store x goals cyc 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.740
 third floor of the presented collection 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.560
 not only famous italian 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:10.229
 designers but also German for example 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.540
 this is the famous designer hugo boss 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:18.150
 and now you will see one of the super 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:21.420
 trend outfitov wow seems to me 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:24.180
 this color looks great to you very much 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:27.810
 fits excellent extremely ordinary lapel 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:30.300
 and looks quite impressive 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.590
 but it seems to me that it is worth adding 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.050
 some kind of accessory 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:37.440
 because we are still talking about clothes for 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:40.500
 work about some business style according to 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.720
 Of course Allen and now we will spend 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.120
 experiment let's see which one 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.959
 these two bags will look better to 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.570
 your along 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:52.320
 but I certainly would have chosen mustard 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:54.239
 how i'm blonde on red in my opinion 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.190
 more suitable for this option because 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:58.260
 make me red your head is red 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.750
 shirt yes yes it seems to me red 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.850
 Looks much better and yellow and 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:06.930
 let's leave for our next outfit 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:09.420
 outfit while I leave her side and come on 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:12.049
 Already find our next outfit 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.049
 so 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:28.720
 great this is the next outfit and i look 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:31.030
 that the yellow bag is still not quite 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.640
 it will suit us after all 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.620
 let's put it aside as yet 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.470
 some find her use for she 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:41.130
 certainly cool but it seems to me this 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:43.900
 elegant style this elegant suit 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:48.489
 needs a completely different accessory 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:50.080
 and I offer you another bag this one 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:53.890
 the bag will look much better 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:55.930
 it is more classic more versatile and 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:59.440
 goes well with white 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:01.870
 It seems to me to look beautiful and how 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:04.090
 you like no not this bag is not very 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:07.810
 she likes me too portnova you me he 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:09.819
 it seems, and I did not fall into this and I think 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:13.239
 it's all the same bag we get 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:19.690
 lively and as I understand you like it 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:23.940
 brand hugo boss is another matter yes 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:23.940
 This option suits me perfectly 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:36.190
 as you yourself made sure the choice of bags is 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:40.390
 everybody's choice for this beautiful 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:42.940
 white and black 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:44.920
 The main thing is not to make a mistake in choosing a blouse and 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:47.860
 white suit lets you choose 

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:50.650
 a blouse of absolutely any color is not important 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:52.960
 that it will be a hugo boss character just 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:55.810
 cavalli or roberto cavalli or even 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:05:00.130
 versace with this suit any blouse 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:05.220
 will look perfect you like 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:05.220
 and let the bag remain white
