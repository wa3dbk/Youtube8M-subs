00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 That's why small business today is 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.040
 winning a lot of big company because it has 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:05.759
 big company breaking and small 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.589
 company 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.440
 succeeding because the small 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.880
 company as a rule is fast and flexible 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.009
 the big business as a whole elephant 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.800
 white has classic problems of 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.289
 communication that causes it to 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:21.600
 slow and it is time consuming that the 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.090
 communication is lost that the decisions 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.500
 homes and small businesses 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.359
 have taken advantage of this 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.460
 differential to customize to do 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.070
 different to be quick and to be 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.450
 flexible and fast and flexible are you 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.910
 realize that the world has changed and 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.140
 answers are other cases it is once 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.239
 he said an interesting phrase that he 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.360
 said so when I learned all the 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:45.210
 answers have changed all the questions 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.860
 be assisted on the woodpecker on the woodpecker 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.719
 had a character once he 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.280
 appeared saying so in all these 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.210
 this vital industry is the first 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.649
 this happens and has changed many 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.480
 problems that did not exist 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.850
 many challenges that were not previously 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.379
 had today and you businessman you 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.420
 professional must be prepared and 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.760
 make flexible efforts to find these 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.860
 new answer once when I started 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.689
 to work in another job that I 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.360
 had I remembered that I was six months old 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.340
 company was the idea of a colleague of 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.810
 work that colleague said so marcelo 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.850
 This idea does not mean I want to be 15 years old. 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.400
 experience beautiful thought that phrase 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.600
 it is the means used but told him 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.830
 so you're not 15 years old 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.619
 experience you have a year of 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.729
 experience repeated 15 times 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:29.159
 I almost lost my job that I discovered that 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.689
 he was one of the boss's friends after a 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.369
 year of experience repeated 15 times 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.640
 means learned way is equal to 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:38.340
 15 years 15 years experience means to 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.229
 For 15 years you have reinvented yourself 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.310
 discovered new answers you searched for 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.380
 new questions 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.270
 invented other solutions sought new 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.340
 challenges and that is to have 15 years 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.409
 experience you have a year of 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.439
 experience repeated 15 times is not 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.899
 experience is to stay behind and why 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:58.680
 not everyone develops three reasons 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:00.780
 basic or is a prison the past 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.719
 person becomes accustomed to the model 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.310
 OK, and you think I repeated it, it's going to continue. 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:07.979
 working out will not work 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.590
 As I already told you the models that 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.209
 in relation to the models that 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.250
 works the longer you stay 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:17.610
 stuck in it more chance of you 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.170
 hunt a second reason only those 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.010
 people who did not realize that everything 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.100
 has changed 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.990
 They are distracted they are not traveling 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.850
 realized that things have changed and that 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:30.480
 third reason people do not evolve 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:32.370
 is fear and insecurity, ie the 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.130
 people are afraid of what lies ahead 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.709
 a man tries to grab his acquaintance 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:40.260
 when a new proposal means to 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.640
 he something nebulous and threatening 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.530
 So you want a leader, you have to 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.959
 help your team understand that the new 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.430
 It's good, you have to believe in change. 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.090
 and make your team believe in 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.850
 change 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.260
 How do you do this every change of 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.390
 behavior must first have a 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.010
 Thinking change you can not 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.440
 change the behavior of anyone if the 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.640
 person before not changing the way of thinking 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.860
 if the person continues thinking about it 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.420
 Way she always does everything the same way. 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.280
 if you get someone say so face 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.870
 this way it is better if the person does not 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.489
 understand why it is better not to 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.430
 buy the idea of ​​what is better she does not 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:13.709
 will make a new way so you have 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.540
 what to show people first 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:17.250
 always a new and better way to do 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:21.060
 I usually say that change starts 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:22.650
 with dissatisfaction the world was 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.630
 modified over time people 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.280
 unsatisfied people who realized that 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.320
 had a new way of doing things and went 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.900
 search this new way of making people 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:35.220
 satisfied people do not change people 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:37.290
 satisfied they lie down and sleep 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:40.830
 animal after they eat it lies and 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:42.290
 Do not even sleep, I did not tell the bear. 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:46.700
 your husband 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:50.489
 and in fact it's so satisfied inside. 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:52.170
 accommodates people with disabilities 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:53.760
 they are accommodated because they do not 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.500
 were inconvenienced 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.090
 nobody showed her that there's another 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.739
 way you can do it can be better 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.720
 then show people who have a 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:03.030
 way to help you see this 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.280
 vision of the new there after you show 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.989
 what are the steps to follow? 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:10.579
 then change begins before as the 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:10.579
 change of mind
