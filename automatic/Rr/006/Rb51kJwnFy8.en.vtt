00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.820
 greater trinidad lopez rivas is the

 civil and firefighters of Jalisco reported that 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.240
 his vocation was born in his native town 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.980
 ocotlán where he observed a fire a 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.380
 gas station and wanted to know what 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:26.200
 it was what it felt like to be a firefighter 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:28.150
 this makes one like 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.970
 what is daily in the service of 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:34.750
 fireman through time to one 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:36.640

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:46.770
 participate or participate in a team and

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:57.600
 fireman is born but very few have the 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.790
 courage and the courage to risk the 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.020
 life for anyone even if this implies 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.880
