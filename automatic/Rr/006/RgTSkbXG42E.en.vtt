so one of the great things about working

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:07.760 
so one of the great things about working
at<00:00:05.850> ESS<00:00:06.359> is<00:00:06.660> that<00:00:06.839> we<00:00:06.930> get<00:00:07.080> lots<00:00:07.649> of

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
at ESS is that we get lots of

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.740 
at ESS is that we get lots of
appreciative<00:00:08.370> emails<00:00:08.730> from<00:00:08.940> troops<00:00:09.300> who<00:00:09.480> wear

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
appreciative emails from troops who wear

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.720 
appreciative emails from troops who wear
our<00:00:09.780> goggles<00:00:10.050> in<00:00:10.380> combat<00:00:10.740> and<00:00:11.010> who<00:00:11.519> have

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
our goggles in combat and who have

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.950 
our goggles in combat and who have
sustained<00:00:12.420> an<00:00:12.570> a<00:00:12.840> an<00:00:13.650> ie<00:00:13.799> D<00:00:14.099> incident<00:00:14.969> but<00:00:15.809> who

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
sustained an a an ie D incident but who

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.120 
sustained an a an ie D incident but who
came<00:00:16.139> away<00:00:16.260> with<00:00:16.440> it<00:00:16.560> with<00:00:16.650> their<00:00:16.800> eyesight

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
came away with it with their eyesight

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.370 
came away with it with their eyesight
because<00:00:17.400> they<00:00:17.490> wear<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:17.760> goggles<00:00:17.910> so<00:00:18.380> the

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
because they wear the goggles so the

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.500 
because they wear the goggles so the
common<00:00:19.920> photos<00:00:20.520> look<00:00:20.730> like<00:00:20.760> this<00:00:21.060> it's<00:00:21.270> thumbs

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
common photos look like this it's thumbs

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.509 
common photos look like this it's thumbs
up<00:00:21.720> ESS<00:00:22.230> thanks<00:00:22.590> for<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:22.769> profiling<00:00:23.279> VG

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
up ESS thanks for the profiling VG

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.759 
up ESS thanks for the profiling VG
goggles<00:00:23.939> they<00:00:24.029> saved<00:00:24.269> my<00:00:24.420> eyes<00:00:24.600> but<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.650> other

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
goggles they saved my eyes but the other

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.380 
goggles they saved my eyes but the other
common<00:00:26.099> theme<00:00:26.279> in<00:00:26.400> these<00:00:26.490> pictures<00:00:26.760> is<00:00:27.269> that

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
common theme in these pictures is that

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.849 
common theme in these pictures is that
the<00:00:27.660> lower<00:00:27.810> part<00:00:27.900> of<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.230> face<00:00:28.470> of<00:00:28.740> these

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
the lower part of the face of these

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.859 
the lower part of the face of these
troops<00:00:29.130> is<00:00:29.670> all<00:00:29.820> torn<00:00:30.029> up<00:00:30.179> with<00:00:30.510> lacerations

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
troops is all torn up with lacerations

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.220 
troops is all torn up with lacerations
and<00:00:31.470> an<00:00:32.460> injury<00:00:32.940> that<00:00:33.210> we'd<00:00:33.660> rather<00:00:33.780> not<00:00:34.050> see

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
and an injury that we'd rather not see

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.530 
and an injury that we'd rather not see
them<00:00:34.380> how<00:00:34.440> to<00:00:34.500> sustain<00:00:35.010> so<00:00:35.399> we<00:00:35.520> figured<00:00:35.850> why

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
them how to sustain so we figured why

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.020 
them how to sustain so we figured why
not<00:00:36.570> create<00:00:37.230> a<00:00:37.590> lower<00:00:38.250> face<00:00:38.520> protection

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
not create a lower face protection

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.690 
not create a lower face protection
accessory<00:00:39.780> for<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.020> profile<00:00:40.379> nvg<00:00:40.860> it's<00:00:41.489> very

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
accessory for the profile nvg it's very

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:48.410 
accessory for the profile nvg it's very
light<00:00:41.969> it's<00:00:42.629> very<00:00:42.930> easy<00:00:43.260> to<00:00:43.500> use<00:00:47.090> it<00:00:48.090> simply

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
light it's very easy to use it simply

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.600 
light it's very easy to use it simply
clips<00:00:48.690> on<00:00:48.870> over<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.440> profile<00:00:49.800> and<00:00:49.920> BG<00:00:50.219> goggle

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
clips on over the profile and BG goggle

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.650 
clips on over the profile and BG goggle
that<00:00:50.820> easy<00:00:51.690> and<00:00:52.460> it<00:00:53.460> moves<00:00:53.699> with<00:00:53.820> your<00:00:54.239> goggles

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
that easy and it moves with your goggles

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.740 
that easy and it moves with your goggles
so<00:00:54.750> it's<00:00:55.350> very<00:00:55.559> simple<00:00:56.399> to<00:00:56.670> wear<00:00:56.820> it's<00:00:57.570> very

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
so it's very simple to wear it's very

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.080 
so it's very simple to wear it's very
lightweight<00:00:58.020> and<00:00:58.399> you<00:00:59.399> can<00:00:59.550> see<00:00:59.760> that<00:00:59.940> the

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
lightweight and you can see that the

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.510 
lightweight and you can see that the
mouth<00:01:00.809> area<00:01:01.050> is<00:01:01.410> cut<00:01:01.649> out<00:01:01.829> so<00:01:02.039> it's<00:01:02.219> easy<00:01:02.399> to

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
mouth area is cut out so it's easy to

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.210 
mouth area is cut out so it's easy to
communicate<00:01:03.210> with<00:01:03.510> your<00:01:03.809> peers<00:01:04.110> they<00:01:04.949> can<00:01:05.100> see

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
communicate with your peers they can see

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.010 
communicate with your peers they can see
your<00:01:05.339> mouth<00:01:05.489> moving<00:01:05.850> you<00:01:05.970> can<00:01:06.150> use<00:01:06.510> signals

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
your mouth moving you can use signals

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.020 
your mouth moving you can use signals
and<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.350> emotions<00:01:08.070> that's<00:01:08.280> there<00:01:08.640> used<00:01:08.820> in
