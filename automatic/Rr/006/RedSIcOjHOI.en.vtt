00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.509
 Hello everyone, 10 and this is the second 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.349
 release 

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:15.110
 meinkravt mechanisms and in this series I 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:18.470
 I'll show you how to build a store shop 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:21.650
 based on experience we press a button and 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.460
 nothing happens but let's we 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.779
 will get 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:29.869
 level here we got 10 levels 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:32.539
 Now when you click on this button in the chat 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:36.250
 He writes that we need to buy a diamond sword 

00:00:32.539 --> 00:00:41.660
 this oil sword and battery and 10 levels 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:42.800
 mechanism as you can see it works and on 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.960
 what is it based on 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:49.870
 it is based on the command block you too 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:53.829
 it is clear when we press this button 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:56.390
 first the signal goes to this block and 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:59.690
 now let's talk about what's here 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:04.549
 written here it is written this means 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:05.960
 now looks like a command word about it for 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:08.119
 choosing the closest players 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:11.630
 that is, only for certain players 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:13.790
 it will be here coordinates where we are 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.460
 stood by pressing this button i 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:21.020
 specially put the button on 4 blocks 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:22.570
 forward so from this block but they could not 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:27.770
 press it 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:29.180
 so he sits then c &amp; c this 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.299
 the number of players that will be 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:37.000
 subject to this action and lm. this 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:43.009
 a player whose level is 10 well 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:47.299
 more precisely the level is 10 or more than 10 then 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:51.070
 there are from 10 to 1 and then you drive such 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:53.689
 the team you bought a diamond sword item 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:59.060
 By the way, why did you put C grade here? 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:02:02.390
 randomly further exactly the same data on 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:05.479
 Now here gif hyphae near those players 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:11.300
 same coordinates same level subject and 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:16.860
 of the subject and the quantity further we go 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:20.130
 same xyz teams here with us too 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.140
 say and all the same data thanks for 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:25.290
 purchase 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:26.600
 but the last block as you can see the delay 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.630
 is coming 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:33.860
 it takes minus 10 levels in 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:36.870
 all the same data 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:39.210
 takes these 10 levels of delay such 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.910
 here are these commands command blocks 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:47.930
 worked right and there was no 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:50.700
 bugs well on this perhaps all 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.240
