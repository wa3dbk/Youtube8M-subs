00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.909
 Hello, my good ones, my name is 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.370
 Veronica and welcome to my channel 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:08.490
 if you think that I am wearing glasses because 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.900
 what are the professionals to me many is 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.030
 I ask therefore I will say for everyone 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.160
 case now I have poor eyesight and I 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.310
 I put them on video just because I 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.189
 I do not see the focus or not I do myself 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.529
 I do not see without glasses and it is very difficult 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.930
 so soryan I will be barrels and come to 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:28.109
 the topic of the video once upon a time one of the first 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:31.109
 my videos it was on my iphone and 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:34.530
 such videos of this kind to many people 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.930
 like I already moved now to this 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.379
 moment on many other videos 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.450
 thematic but I myself look like what's in 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.719
 my iphone any such sometimes from time 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:48.390
 time since it is very useful 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:52.440
 program for yourself find and i consider these 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:55.710
 videos with benefit and old videos I hid 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.300
 because she was flawed since she 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:02.670
 Was one of the first and my old video 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:05.760
 very diligent and everyone just asks me 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:09.450
 open this video or with them new what 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:12.990
 like why did we want to know that 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.150
 so you took a vote there 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.880
 in my group and 75 just 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:22.439
 voted yes shoot video 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:24.180

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.960
 long pull if you're interested then 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.960
 go 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:42.890
 Well, in principle, here is such a me 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:45.500
 the phone is 5 not 5s not 6 not 6 plus not 4 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:48.200
 5 because when I just have a lot of time 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.060
 such a video and all argued about 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.790
 what i have iphone case about it now 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:56.180
 such a little black plastic written 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:58.220
 california palmochki infrequent me covers 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:03.640
 the last time in the picture is not something 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:03.640
 such a little cloud and written in 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.600
 rainbow and at the same time cheerful 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.050
 if you see this little thing, then I 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.610
 special and now included as 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:17.660
 I know many people this one doesn’t work 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:20.290
 top button and tormented wait while 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:23.150
 blocked it is very tense 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.830
 so many people asked me 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.710
 how to deal with it now I will show 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.390
 where to go to put here 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:29.570
 this thing with which you are like this 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.660
 here 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:36.580
 You can block it like this 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:39.290
 the phone must go to the settings 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:45.140
 general probably in Russian not general 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:47.180
 here cassi run my english yes here with 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.890
 sense of touch and turn it on 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.480
 pages such a thing if you are a little 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.200
 where you need to move you mix 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:59.350
 can move everywhere 3 here and 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:03:01.820
 screen do and in general all sorts of other and 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:04.970
 actually come in the application to me 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:06.709
 just one screen i'm such a perfectionist 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.590
 so all I have to be at least 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:12.470
 first comes here 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:15.380
 mail by skype following our notes 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.690
 where do i write down all my ideas or 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:21.020
 all sorts of things that's necessary for them to Pauline 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:24.320
 books where i read books like i love 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:28.100
 read a book it with this book 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:32.030
 They are from the phone but do not carry with them 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:35.510
 that's why I buy it with a book 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:37.790
 currently only this is my favorite authors 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:40.610
 I don't use much further 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.970
 I used to use it often before 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:43.790
 highly 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:45.250
 to the folder we move on later on with you 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:47.330
 to my 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:51.340
 By the way, add all I add 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:56.870
 can now see all 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:58.930
 here are 9 thousand friends almost do not look at 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.110
 the number of subscribers there is almost all 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.630
 blocked 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:04.370
 or some fake pages that 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:06.050
 not to say active normal 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:08.569
 users I add a link

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:14.030
 would write and I watched your videos 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:18.140
 adds ecology and add so 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:20.030
 know further twitter by the way i have 

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:22.400
 instagram and twitter on instagram I'm like 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:24.680
 I don’t really share all my photos 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:27.950
 I can let you see how many of them 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:31.580
 I have a lot here 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:33.020
 Twitter photos that are not in 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.539
 instagram instame me just 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:37.850
 a few there dawn arrow with a clean 

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:39.710
 to be aware of but if you choose 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:43.010
 between instagram and twitter to me much 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:44.750
 more like twitter so the same 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:47.270
 the link will be in the description subscribe 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:49.449
 I'm over there all the news photos all 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:52.389
 this she she youtube 

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:54.999
 how can it be without this application 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:58.689
 very successful official dubovskoe but 

00:04:54.999 --> 00:05:00.639
 as if nothing better I did not find the following 

00:04:58.689 --> 00:05:03.189
 this instagram also link will be in 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:05.650
 description following application is pixar 

00:05:03.189 --> 00:05:07.870
 in which I process photos but not 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:11.770
 all and not always this for some very 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:13.419
 so some special effects of the 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:17.080
 light and of course you know it all because 

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:21.580
 that this is all I have heard say 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:25.599
 I think this picture where a bunch of different 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:28.089
 effects but if it is paid but in 

00:05:25.599 --> 00:05:30.099
 principle it is worth it because i 

00:05:28.089 --> 00:05:33.639
 days only picture she produced 

00:05:30.099 --> 00:05:35.379
 awesome class very program further 

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:38.050
 beauty free I don’t know why it is me 

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:39.969
 here but let it be just in case 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:41.649
 sometimes i feel like it 

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:43.779
 experiment and change color 

00:05:41.649 --> 00:05:46.899
 eye and hair color changes 

00:05:43.779 --> 00:05:49.719
 Then I have steam applications because 

00:05:46.899 --> 00:05:50.949
 what if I play to not go in 

00:05:49.719 --> 00:05:52.899
 steam at this moment 

00:05:50.949 --> 00:05:55.710
 through whom you can simply through the phone 

00:05:52.899 --> 00:05:59.589
 It’s more convenient to answer me further 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:06:03.520
 privat24 is who knows in Ukraine pawn 

00:05:59.589 --> 00:06:06.759
 only in Ukraine there is a private bank and 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:09.639
 this application is actually banking 

00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:12.490
 further webmoney I think everyone knows the visa 

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:16.139
 everyone knows and whispies can be remembered 

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:18.839
 called statistics statistics she 

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:22.860
 shows the statistics of my channel and 

00:06:18.839 --> 00:06:25.959
 I have a phone message at the bottom 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:28.659
 gallery and here this application i used to be 

00:06:25.959 --> 00:06:30.399
 I downloaded all the music on the iphone at once 

00:06:28.659 --> 00:06:32.289
 through aytyuns but it is very strong 

00:06:30.399 --> 00:06:35.709
 annoying every time like this 

00:06:32.289 --> 00:06:38.830
 throw off so I still 

00:06:35.709 --> 00:06:41.409
 what music do not keep as I said 

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:44.379
 many people write to me say open audio recordings 

00:06:41.409 --> 00:06:45.099
 I have no music there I listen to it in this 

00:06:44.379 --> 00:06:46.899
 application 

00:06:45.099 --> 00:06:50.860
 in general on other colors it is me so 

00:06:46.899 --> 00:06:54.789
 changed and then all my music in general 

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:57.980
 Yes, and in a folder in a folder for basically 

00:06:54.789 --> 00:07:03.740
 what i seldom use 1 

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:06.820
 Beth or she cleans every cache there the 

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:09.200
 you could have accumulated for some time 

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:11.480
 you see some open programs 

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:13.490
 how much do i click on everything cleans and 

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:15.050
 memory appears on the phone there 

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:17.510
 for example you downloaded some application 

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:19.850
 but I liked it removed and in 

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:23.300
 the system remained some files from 

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:26.360
 him and she removes it like this 

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:29.390
 you do not need on my bread 

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:31.520
 parties yuzik well, and all sorts of standard 

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:33.680
 programs that I don't use from me 

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:34.850
 not located there not colors like u 

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:39.260
 some or black 

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:41.600
 well okay how often i open them 

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:43.460
 I use them often and this is the thing 

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:46.580
 which is initially showing like this 

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:48.440
 I can lock the phone's preferred 

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:50.660
 This is the whole program that I was on my 

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:52.820
 why the phone was on my 

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:55.910
 phone if you liked this video 

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:57.920
 and you learned something useful for yourself 

00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:59.420
 put me fingers up and of course 

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:01.940
 subscribe to my channel 

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:05.690
 as the video i will try to release 

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:09.100
 increasingly the hour of the word and I have you all 

00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:09.100
 I really, really, love everyone
