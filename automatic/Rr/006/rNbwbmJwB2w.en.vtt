00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 
it's like you're seeing you know the

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:14.350 
it's like you're seeing you know the
what's<00:04:13.190> happening<00:04:13.610> behind<00:04:13.730> you<00:04:13.940> has<00:04:14.120> doors

what's happening behind you has doors

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:15.880 
what's happening behind you has doors
through<00:04:14.690> them<00:04:14.840> and<00:04:15.049> that's<00:04:15.380> a<00:04:15.470> really<00:04:15.590> cool

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:15.890 
through them and that's a really cool

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:17.860 
through them and that's a really cool
look<00:04:16.100> and<00:04:16.250> I<00:04:16.310> think<00:04:16.549> that<00:04:16.790> that<00:04:17.000> because<00:04:17.720> of

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
look and I think that that because of

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.050 
look and I think that that because of
that<00:04:18.049> unique<00:04:18.470> take<00:04:18.769> I<00:04:18.950> fit<00:04:19.220> in<00:04:19.400> also<00:04:19.700> because

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060 
that unique take I fit in also because

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.620 
that unique take I fit in also because
of<00:04:20.180> his<00:04:20.359> just<00:04:20.660> a<00:04:20.890> commanding<00:04:22.630> presentation

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
of his just a commanding presentation

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.600 
of his just a commanding presentation
yeah<00:04:23.840> i<00:04:23.870> think<00:04:24.050> that<00:04:24.200> Jarvis's<00:04:24.950> vocals<00:04:25.490> is

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
yeah i think that Jarvis's vocals is

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.090 
yeah i think that Jarvis's vocals is
definitely<00:04:26.060> the<00:04:26.330> the<00:04:26.720> center<00:04:27.470> to<00:04:27.590> focus<00:04:28.010> the

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:28.100 
definitely the the center to focus the

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.830 
definitely the the center to focus the
rice<00:04:28.250> album<00:04:28.729> not<00:04:29.510> that

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
rice album not that

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.330 
rice album not that
instrumentals<00:04:30.500> aren't<00:04:30.710> good<00:04:30.919> though<00:04:31.100> and<00:04:31.250> now

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
instrumentals aren't good though and now

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.220 
instrumentals aren't good though and now
that<00:04:31.520> there's<00:04:31.669> a<00:04:31.760> lot<00:04:31.910> of<00:04:31.940> variety<00:04:32.600> in<00:04:32.720> the<00:04:33.110> way

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:33.230 
that there's a lot of variety in the way

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:34.659 
that there's a lot of variety in the way
they're<00:04:33.470> arranged<00:04:33.830> and<00:04:34.100> composed<00:04:34.490> and

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:34.669 
they're arranged and composed and

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:37.060 
they're arranged and composed and
performed<00:04:34.930> but<00:04:35.930> I<00:04:35.990> think<00:04:36.320> that<00:04:36.380> what<00:04:36.650> Jarvis

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070 
performed but I think that what Jarvis

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:40.150 
performed but I think that what Jarvis
does<00:04:37.389> spectacularly<00:04:38.389> is<00:04:38.690> take<00:04:39.620> the

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 
does spectacularly is take the

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:41.890 
does spectacularly is take the
instrumental<00:04:40.699> foundation<00:04:41.449> that<00:04:41.570> the<00:04:41.690> band

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:41.900 
instrumental foundation that the band

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.469 
instrumental foundation that the band
gives<00:04:42.229> him<00:04:42.470> and<00:04:42.650> work<00:04:43.250> with<00:04:43.460> it<00:04:43.490> I<00:04:43.790> mean<00:04:44.360> you

00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:45.289 
actually find with a lot of the Britpop

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:47.080 
actually find with a lot of the Britpop
you<00:05:45.710> have<00:05:45.830> your<00:05:46.010> albums<00:05:46.340> from<00:05:46.430> the<00:05:46.580> Britpop

see<00:05:47.300> most<00:05:47.510> of<00:05:47.660> blurs<00:05:47.900> works<00:05:48.260> well<00:05:48.440> be<00:05:48.590> because

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:48.800 
see most of blurs works well be because

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.529 
see most of blurs works well be because
I<00:05:49.039> think<00:05:49.220> that<00:05:49.400> I<00:05:49.520> think<00:05:49.940> the<00:05:50.030> reason<00:05:50.180> for<00:05:50.510> that

00:05:50.529 --> 00:05:50.539 
I think that I think the reason for that

00:05:50.539 --> 00:05:52.740 
I think that I think the reason for that
is<00:05:50.840> because<00:05:51.110> bands<00:05:51.620> like<00:05:51.800> pulp<00:05:52.130> and<00:05:52.430> blur

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:52.750 
is because bands like pulp and blur

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:55.330 
is because bands like pulp and blur
they're<00:05:53.750> very<00:05:53.900> much<00:05:54.169> thinking<00:05:54.740> man's<00:05:55.010> pop

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:55.340 
they're very much thinking man's pop

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:57.070 
they're very much thinking man's pop
yeah<00:05:55.639> and<00:05:55.910> that's<00:05:56.120> hard<00:05:56.360> for<00:05:56.419> people<00:05:56.570> to<00:05:56.840> grasp

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:57.080 
yeah and that's hard for people to grasp

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.379 
yeah and that's hard for people to grasp
because<00:05:57.440> they<00:05:57.770> hear<00:05:58.099> it<00:05:58.220> at<00:05:58.340> first<00:05:58.669> and<00:05:59.030> they

00:05:59.379 --> 00:05:59.389 
because they hear it at first and they

00:05:59.389 --> 00:06:01.390 
because they hear it at first and they
hear<00:05:59.599> that<00:05:59.630> pop<00:06:00.080> sheen<00:06:00.500> and<00:06:00.800> it's<00:06:01.160> very

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:01.400 
hear that pop sheen and it's very

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.790 
hear that pop sheen and it's very
attractive<00:06:02.120> and<00:06:02.300> then<00:06:02.750> I<00:06:03.020> think<00:06:03.500> that<00:06:03.650> the

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:03.800 
attractive and then I think that the

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.200 
attractive and then I think that the
average<00:06:04.010> listener<00:06:04.430> can<00:06:04.610> kind<00:06:05.030> of<00:06:05.060> get

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:05.210 
average listener can kind of get

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:07.570 
average listener can kind of get
confused<00:06:05.720> by<00:06:05.930> it<00:06:05.990> because<00:06:06.740> there<00:06:07.070> is<00:06:07.220> a<00:06:07.250> more

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:07.580 
confused by it because there is a more

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:09.430 
confused by it because there is a more
artistic<00:06:07.729> stand<00:06:08.419> behind<00:06:08.690> it<00:06:09.020> it's<00:06:09.200> so<00:06:09.289> much

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:09.440 
artistic stand behind it it's so much

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.740 
artistic stand behind it it's so much
more<00:06:09.590> complicated<00:06:10.010> than<00:06:10.490> like<00:06:10.760> what<00:06:11.120> we<00:06:11.599> now

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:11.750 
more complicated than like what we now

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:13.600 
more complicated than like what we now
know<00:06:11.780> as<00:06:11.960> American<00:06:12.590> pop<00:06:12.800> which<00:06:13.039> is<00:06:13.160> so<00:06:13.340> focused

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:13.610 
know as American pop which is so focused

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:15.640 
know as American pop which is so focused
on<00:06:13.880> repetition<00:06:14.330> and<00:06:14.599> structure<00:06:15.050> and<00:06:15.289> lyric

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:15.650 
on repetition and structure and lyric

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:18.190 
on repetition and structure and lyric
and<00:06:16.070> you<00:06:16.669> know<00:06:16.789> melodies<00:06:17.360> and<00:06:17.510> hook<00:06:17.690> so<00:06:17.960> again

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:18.200 
and you know melodies and hook so again

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.279 
and you know melodies and hook so again
it's<00:06:18.979> a<00:06:19.070> completely<00:06:19.490> different<00:06:19.880> class<00:06:20.150> of<00:06:20.389> pop

00:06:21.279 --> 00:06:21.289 
it's a completely different class of pop

00:06:21.289 --> 00:06:23.020 
it's a completely different class of pop
music<00:06:21.470> that<00:06:21.860> takes<00:06:22.099> a<00:06:22.220> while<00:06:22.370> to<00:06:22.550> understand

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:23.030 
music that takes a while to understand

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:24.969 
music that takes a while to understand
and<00:06:23.270> getting<00:06:23.539> too<00:06:23.780> yeah<00:06:24.020> but<00:06:24.530> when<00:06:24.650> you<00:06:24.770> do

00:06:24.969 --> 00:06:24.979 
and getting too yeah but when you do

00:06:24.979 --> 00:06:27.070 
and getting too yeah but when you do
it's<00:06:25.160> more<00:06:25.400> rewarding<00:06:25.580> because<00:06:26.180> of<00:06:26.660> that<00:06:26.810> yeah

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:27.080 
it's more rewarding because of that yeah

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:29.529 
it's more rewarding because of that yeah
I<00:06:27.370> really<00:06:28.370> like<00:06:28.639> this<00:06:28.789> album<00:06:29.030> tom<00:06:29.330> i'm
