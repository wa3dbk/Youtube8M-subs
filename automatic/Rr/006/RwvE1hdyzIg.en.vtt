00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:10.660
 good to everyone in this tutorial I'm going to 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:13.719
 try to explain how to create a route 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.160
 with tomtom I do not know if you have spent a 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:19.689
 time you want to make a tourist trip 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:21.310
 or a work trip and you want to go for a 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:23.780
 determined site to another but happening 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.940
 for certain points 

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:28.670
 Well, it's very easy if I'm going to 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:32.150
 explain how to do it on the menu 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:34.300
 main tomtom dais to planning 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.300
 advanced 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:39.180
 and here you see a menu 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:40.260
 which tells us the output add stops 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.300
 and destiny 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.699
 how the best way to do it is 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.500
 create an example because I'm going to organize a 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:48.480
 tourist trip through the alpujarra 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.770
 grenadine and I'm going to do it whole for 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.500
 that you see 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.300
 in exit well then I will go out 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.480
 from the town of Lanjarón, I have it for 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.480
 here 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.610
 and the destination where I want to arrive as it is 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.230
 a tourist trip because I want the 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:08.900
 destination is the same as the exit 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:08.900
 so then let's put back 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.320
 Now what I have to do is go 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:17.040
 adding the intermediate stops by 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.040
 I want to spend 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:22.430
 the tonton here allows us to add up 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:26.050
 five intermediate stops no more 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.050
 the first stop I'm going to make 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:28.910
 in capileira 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:38.850
 the second stop 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.850
 in Portuguese 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.780
 the stop 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.780
 Between vélez 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.970
 the fourth stop 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.619
 in the town of cádiz 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.840
 and the fifth stop good I do not know I said 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.600
 that the stops are added with the 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.080
 button more down to the left the 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:12.790
 fifth stop 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.790
 in the town of órgiva 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.910
 As you can see we have the beginning and launch 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.980
 arrival also went down but before 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.290
 He went through almost every town more 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.970
 representative of ALPUJARRA ie 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.720
 what I'm going to do is a tourist route 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.490
 for everything for the whole region 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.350
 I can even activate an audible alarm 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:38.240
 to let me know when you arrive 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.240
 I can explain or remove 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.600
 and even also here on the button 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.580
 edit down to the right I can change 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:47.459
 the order in which I want to go for example 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:49.110
 I can do like this up and I can 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:52.610
 change that order 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.610
 the ideal is to leave it as it was 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.840
 let's say ok 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:04.720
 routes back and now here in this 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.720
 menu as you see is going to ask us 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.440
 what kind of route do we want fast 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.420
 ecological shorter in short that already 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.250
 you put what you are 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.600
 more convenient I'm going to leave the one 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:18.600
 it has faster 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.880
 here in now we can select when 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.860
 we want to do the route and today tomorrow 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:26.660
 right now you only have to change 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:30.550
 the day and the hour said it as it is 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.550
 we give the button above to plan 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:36.840
 and here we have what the map is like 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:39.630
 you see is a start and it makes a kind of 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.760
 circle throughout the region 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:44.090
 and we're just going to follow the 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.090
 route 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:50.750
 elections 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:52.569
 Here we can see the demo of the route 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.939
 delete the instructions 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:58.109
 we can give to the map and here we have the 

00:03:54.939 --> 00:03:58.109
 map we can expand 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:11.270
 and then as soon as we give it to done 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:13.910
 will do the personalized route with 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:16.720
 so very easy I hope you have them 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:16.720
 served something
