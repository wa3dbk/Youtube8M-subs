I'll show how easy it is to add this

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.320 
I'll show how easy it is to add this
feature<00:00:19.619> to<00:00:19.980> your<00:00:20.400> own<00:00:20.520> existing<00:00:20.910> solutions

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
feature to your own existing solutions

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.320 
feature to your own existing solutions
or<00:00:21.720> even<00:00:21.750> to<00:00:22.289> a<00:00:22.710> new<00:00:23.220> solution<00:00:23.490> let's<00:00:24.180> take<00:00:24.300> a

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
or even to a new solution let's take a

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.900 
or even to a new solution let's take a
look<00:00:24.590> so<00:00:25.590> when<00:00:25.920> I<00:00:25.949> say<00:00:26.130> animation<00:00:26.670> this<00:00:26.789> is

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
look so when I say animation this is

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.550 
look so when I say animation this is
what<00:00:27.029> I<00:00:27.060> mean<00:00:27.300> we've<00:00:27.930> got<00:00:28.080> some<00:00:28.289> different

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
what I mean we've got some different

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.500 
what I mean we've got some different
options<00:00:28.710> for<00:00:29.400> how<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.609> windows<00:00:30.029> can<00:00:30.330> come

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
options for how the windows can come

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.430 
options for how the windows can come
into<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:30.810> screen<00:00:32.870> like<00:00:33.870> such

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
into the screen like such

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.979 
into the screen like such
it<00:00:35.430> also<00:00:35.579> offers<00:00:36.090> in<00:00:36.239> different<00:00:36.480> positions

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
it also offers in different positions

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:45.770 
it also offers in different positions
where<00:00:37.620> these<00:00:37.860> windows<00:00:38.250> can<00:00:38.399> come<00:00:38.520> into<00:00:44.420> and<00:00:45.420> we

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
where these windows can come into and we

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.520 
where these windows can come into and we
also<00:00:45.930> also<00:00:46.320> also<00:00:46.530> offer<00:00:47.160> different<00:00:47.579> speeds

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.299 

okay<00:00:52.530> let's<00:00:52.710> take<00:00:52.800> a<00:00:52.860> look<00:00:53.039> at<00:00:53.100> all<00:00:53.219> the

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
okay let's take a look at all the

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.540 
okay let's take a look at all the
features<00:00:53.399> available<00:00:54.710> so<00:00:55.710> we've<00:00:56.010> gotten<00:00:56.280> slide

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
features available so we've gotten slide

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.750 
features available so we've gotten slide
from<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.789> left<00:00:57.030> which<00:00:57.360> we<00:00:57.510> saw<00:00:57.750> earlier<00:00:58.760> slide

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
from the left which we saw earlier slide

right now all of these are available in
every<00:01:24.930> position<00:01:25.229> that<00:01:25.619> I<00:01:25.650> should<00:01:25.860> really<00:01:26.040> err

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
every position that I should really err

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.520 
every position that I should really err
in<00:01:26.490> at<00:01:26.610> every<00:01:26.700> speed<00:01:27.150> then<00:01:27.990> we<00:01:28.020> have<00:01:28.229> window

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
in at every speed then we have window

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.539 
in at every speed then we have window
shade<00:01:28.770> which<00:01:29.220> works<00:01:29.460> best<00:01:29.700> on<00:01:29.850> slow<00:01:31.369> and<00:01:32.369> we

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
shade which works best on slow and we

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.929 
shade which works best on slow and we
have<00:01:32.790> none<00:01:33.180> which<00:01:33.479> is<00:01:33.630> your<00:01:33.780> traditional<00:01:34.939> just

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
have none which is your traditional just

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.020 
have none which is your traditional just
going<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.180> pop<00:01:36.360> it<00:01:36.509> up<00:01:37.460> okay<00:01:38.460> let's<00:01:38.880> take<00:01:38.970> a

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
going to pop it up okay let's take a

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.510 
going to pop it up okay let's take a
look<00:01:39.240> at<00:01:39.360> what<00:01:39.630> this<00:01:39.869> system<00:01:40.650> needs<00:01:40.979> to<00:01:41.220> work

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
look at what this system needs to work

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.429 
look at what this system needs to work
first<00:01:42.270> of<00:01:42.420> all<00:01:42.509> I<00:01:42.540> need<00:01:42.689> to<00:01:42.780> know<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:42.960> size<00:01:43.229> of

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
first of all I need to know the size of

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.060 
first of all I need to know the size of
the<00:01:43.530> screen<00:01:43.829> and<00:01:44.130> I'm<00:01:44.490> doing<00:01:44.729> that<00:01:45.829> two<00:01:46.829> ways

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
the screen and I'm doing that two ways

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.480 
the screen and I'm doing that two ways
one<00:01:47.430> is<00:01:47.729> at<00:01:48.210> startup<00:01:48.960> I'm<00:01:49.140> coming<00:01:49.470> to<00:01:49.619> a<00:01:49.950> layout

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
one is at startup I'm coming to a layout

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.840 
one is at startup I'm coming to a layout
that<00:01:50.640> has<00:01:50.700> a<00:01:50.850> box<00:01:51.200> size<00:01:52.200> 200<00:01:52.740> by<00:01:52.799> 200<00:01:52.979> and<00:01:53.430> I'm

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
that has a box size 200 by 200 and I'm

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.990 
that has a box size 200 by 200 and I'm
grabbing<00:01:54.180> some<00:01:54.329> information<00:01:54.990> about<00:01:55.590> this

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
grabbing some information about this

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.980 
grabbing some information about this
mainly<00:01:57.000> throwing<00:01:57.390> those<00:01:57.479> into<00:01:57.750> global

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
mainly throwing those into global

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.810 
mainly throwing those into global
variables<00:01:58.350> and<00:01:58.619> what<00:01:58.979> the<00:01:59.399> reason<00:01:59.610> I'm<00:01:59.700> doing

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
variables and what the reason I'm doing

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.999 
variables and what the reason I'm doing
it<00:01:59.969> this<00:02:00.119> way<00:02:00.180> is<00:02:00.659> that<00:02:00.899> it<00:02:01.320> gets<00:02:01.590> around<00:02:01.860> the

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
it this way is that it gets around the

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.350 
it this way is that it gets around the
issue<00:02:02.250> of<00:02:02.520> having<00:02:02.640> to<00:02:02.850> know<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.090> different

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
issue of having to know the different

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.600 
issue of having to know the different
window<00:02:03.600> sizes<00:02:03.840> for<00:02:04.229> different<00:02:04.610> operating

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
window sizes for different operating

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.490 
window sizes for different operating
systems<00:02:06.030> and<00:02:06.450> so<00:02:06.780> by<00:02:06.960> coming<00:02:07.259> here<00:02:07.439> and

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
systems and so by coming here and

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.900 
systems and so by coming here and
knowing<00:02:07.829> the<00:02:07.979> size<00:02:08.250> of<00:02:08.489> something<00:02:08.670> on<00:02:08.849> the

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
knowing the size of something on the

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.639 
knowing the size of something on the
layout<00:02:09.209> and<00:02:09.479> then<00:02:09.840> getting<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.200> window<00:02:10.470> size

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
layout and then getting the window size

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.760 
layout and then getting the window size
I<00:02:10.920> can<00:02:11.129> just<00:02:11.550> add<00:02:11.730> this<00:02:12.090> to<00:02:12.150> my<00:02:13.080> existing

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
I can just add this to my existing

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.190 
I can just add this to my existing
layout<00:02:14.190> sizes<00:02:14.700> and<00:02:14.910> size<00:02:15.840> the<00:02:15.990> window

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
layout sizes and size the window

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.410 
layout sizes and size the window
appropriately<00:02:16.950> what<00:02:17.640> that<00:02:17.820> requires<00:02:18.090> though

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
appropriately what that requires though

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.990 
appropriately what that requires though
is<00:02:18.570> I<00:02:18.720> know<00:02:18.780> the<00:02:19.320> size<00:02:19.560> of<00:02:19.800> my<00:02:19.950> layouts<00:02:20.310> and<00:02:20.850> I'm

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
is I know the size of my layouts and I'm

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.910 
is I know the size of my layouts and I'm
doing<00:02:21.210> that<00:02:21.740> by<00:02:22.740> on<00:02:23.100> every<00:02:23.430> screen<00:02:24.680> having<00:02:25.680> a

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
doing that by on every screen having a

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.990 
doing that by on every screen having a
box<00:02:26.790> essentially<00:02:27.540> around<00:02:27.930> the<00:02:28.550> layout<00:02:29.550> and

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
box essentially around the layout and

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.870 
box essentially around the layout and
giving<00:02:30.450> it<00:02:30.570> a<00:02:30.630> name<00:02:30.810> layout<00:02:31.230> size<00:02:31.760> one<00:02:32.760> of<00:02:32.820> the

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
giving it a name layout size one of the

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.430 
giving it a name layout size one of the
nice<00:02:33.030> things<00:02:33.240> about<00:02:33.300> this<00:02:33.510> technique<00:02:33.840> is<00:02:34.020> it

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
nice things about this technique is it

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.020 
nice things about this technique is it
will<00:02:34.560> adjust<00:02:34.860> your<00:02:35.190> layouts<00:02:35.430> almost

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
will adjust your layouts almost

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.390 
will adjust your layouts almost
automatically<00:02:36.510> so<00:02:37.140> if<00:02:37.200> I<00:02:37.290> come<00:02:37.620> and<00:02:37.860> I<00:02:37.980> change

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
automatically so if I come and I change

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.940 
automatically so if I come and I change
the<00:02:38.520> size<00:02:38.790> of<00:02:38.970> this<00:02:39.500> will<00:02:40.500> just<00:02:40.530> said<00:02:40.830> we're

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
the size of this will just said we're

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.450 
the size of this will just said we're
gonna<00:02:41.040> make<00:02:41.190> it<00:02:41.310> 400<00:02:41.940> and<00:02:42.510> we'll<00:02:42.870> make<00:02:43.050> it<00:02:43.460> 350

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:44.460 
gonna make it 400 and we'll make it 350

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:53.690 
gonna make it 400 and we'll make it 350
tall<00:02:52.490> okay

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
tall okay

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.250 
tall okay
the<00:02:54.230> by<00:02:55.230> resizing<00:02:55.980> this<00:02:56.280> outside<00:02:56.760> box<00:02:57.450> to<00:02:58.050> be

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
the by resizing this outside box to be

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.340 
the by resizing this outside box to be
you<00:02:59.010> know<00:02:59.100> the<00:02:59.790> edges<00:03:00.060> of<00:03:00.180> my<00:03:00.210> layout<00:03:00.690> then<00:03:01.230> the

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
you know the edges of my layout then the

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.850 
you know the edges of my layout then the
system<00:03:01.680> automatically<00:03:02.310> is<00:03:02.790> going<00:03:03.240> to<00:03:03.860> resize

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
system automatically is going to resize

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.010 
system automatically is going to resize
that<00:03:05.190> new<00:03:05.340> that<00:03:05.610> new<00:03:05.760> size<00:03:06.000> so<00:03:06.720> let's<00:03:06.780> do<00:03:06.990> that

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
that new that new size so let's do that

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.230 
that new that new size so let's do that
one<00:03:07.200> more<00:03:07.290> time<00:03:07.350> I'll<00:03:07.830> take<00:03:07.950> this<00:03:08.160> I'll<00:03:08.820> change

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:09.240 
one more time I'll take this I'll change

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:13.000 
one more time I'll take this I'll change
it<00:03:09.450> we'll<00:03:10.140> make<00:03:10.320> it<00:03:10.380> much<00:03:11.040> smaller<00:03:11.250> now

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
it we'll make it much smaller now

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:23.570 
it we'll make it much smaller now
everything<00:03:14.010> way<00:03:14.250> up<00:03:14.400> here<00:03:14.610> like<00:03:14.700> this<00:03:22.310> you<00:03:23.310> get

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
everything way up here like this you get

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.220 
everything way up here like this you get
that<00:03:23.730> exactly<00:03:24.240> since<00:03:24.420> we're<00:03:24.600> just<00:03:24.750> dimming<00:03:25.110> it

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
that exactly since we're just dimming it

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:33.530 
that exactly since we're just dimming it
here<00:03:25.640> we<00:03:26.640> got<00:03:26.820> it<00:03:26.910> like<00:03:27.030> that<00:03:32.300> and<00:03:33.300> it<00:03:33.450> just

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
here we got it like that and it just

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.180 
here we got it like that and it just
resizes<00:03:34.290> because<00:03:34.650> of<00:03:34.770> the<00:03:34.830> way<00:03:34.920> the<00:03:35.040> layout

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
resizes because of the way the layout

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.390 
resizes because of the way the layout
sides<00:03:35.490> are<00:03:35.640> is<00:03:35.850> working<00:03:36.209> I<00:03:37.100> hope<00:03:38.100> you<00:03:38.250> found
