00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:05.830
 it was the best with the information we do not count what the aromo the same 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:08.929
 it's more obvious a young man is a discipline 

00:00:09.829 --> 00:00:11.429
 efe 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.530
 there are no people much beyond that patience dedication 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.060
 and the pilot's precision the fans 

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:27.219
 c will congregate today in the last weeks in the national championship that 

00:00:27.219 --> 00:00:30.219
 has made the weather 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:45.450
 bilardo modelismo is passion and nancy 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.010
 for it are his dreams of dominating the sky that are fulfilled which birds 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.170
 they cross the air executing impressive maneuvers going to mass when my 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.340
 friends and my friends movements are small planes 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.040
 designed in most cases 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.410
 for each one of his pilots who in benin them 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:05.390
 anything else 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.260
 what simple machines 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.080
 in each of these 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.970
 of these models we liked to do it or at least put them together 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:14.760
 the sun said our products 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.360
 taking care of the bars that breaks one is 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.660
 it is a pain the pp through passion 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.070
 is a very complete young man with the cinema is also a workforce that you 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.090
 you have to put everything together 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.280
 the regular closing the plane 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.880
 while the electric from the radio the central part of doing everything 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.400
 we must learn a lot 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.680
 of those mechanics 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.590
 gillespie engines many of which we fly 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:42.340
 they are weapons 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:43.810
 we just build 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.119
 during the week the moment we build we fine-tune and prepare the plane for 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.430
 fly weekend 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.530
 and when it has been exposed 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.530
 it's a shame it's not a pain too 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.810
 it repairs the most repaired future kings dated things 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.370
 Ferron sees the aeromodelling very strong 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:05.300
 considered as a discipline with a high scientific component and 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.500
 technician whose goal is to design build and fly planes at scale 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.399
 has captured dozens of birds 

00:02:12.399 --> 00:02:14.859
 ruiz the camping and is located 

00:02:14.859 --> 00:02:18.269
 of field hand and experience moments of high lethality 

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:23.430
 watching how his parents mimics the air and got up in relation 

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:28.049
 i a formative activity more than in June no cut 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:33.609
 certainly here it is about doing things well and seriously if it were not like that 

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:36.329
 how the records is a sport 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:39.759
 it's a sport and that involves science that implies 

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:42.939
 news ilna 

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:45.029
 it implies 

00:02:45.029 --> 00:02:46.819
 aviation knowledge of it 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:48.829
 federal aviation 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:53.489
 and quite complete this important discipline seems expensive but it is not 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:53.949
 A) Yes 

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:59.509
 a beginner plane can be worth on average 2 thousand soles the model airplane if 

00:02:59.509 --> 00:03:02.379
 demand time and absolute dedication of the pilot 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:05.459
 was the slightest distraction can cause the 

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:10.240
 good to temptations percent perfect 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.819
 a flight is faster 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:14.789
 how can they fly 

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:18.819
 the plane maintaining a unanimous flight sentence the rest is that the 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:19.919
 landing 

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:22.049
 and the most delicate thing 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:26.639
 because one was the year of the plane in fact even among them the propeller 

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:29.459
 yesterday was a league 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:32.689
 is the most delicate of the roses of companies or the other 

00:03:33.719 --> 00:03:36.719
 a third receiver toys are personal 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:42.419
 of the 12 programs of all sales dinner offered stops to achieve it 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:44.290
 in the last weeks 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.379
 the national championship was held 

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:50.249
 I'm scared of the aeromodelling fans in the midst of enthusiasm and 

00:03:50.249 --> 00:03:54.300
 the creation of seeing the airplanes drawing the most amazing figures 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:55.469
 at the cinema 

00:03:55.469 --> 00:03:59.730
 as in the championship it was very good the dncd performed is 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.730
 in the advance of the era of nothing of the palms 

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:06.949
 i is not very competitive 

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:08.799
 then I was lucky to win the title 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:11.649
 very good flights 

00:04:11.649 --> 00:04:15.119
 and I'm pretty busy a party enough people from the province of spain 

00:04:15.119 --> 00:04:17.590
 different brand 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:18.959
 despite this 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.790
 little by little the model airplane has gained a space 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:26.159
 and not only in Lima, but at the national level they already have a seat 

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:30.550
 and is that the goal of conquering the turn is overcome 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:35.040
 by humans like you who simply dared to challenge and the domains
