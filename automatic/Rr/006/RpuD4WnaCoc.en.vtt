we<00:01:31.049> have<00:01:31.170> to<00:01:31.409> make<00:01:31.680> an<00:01:31.829> upgrade<00:01:32.220> after<00:01:32.880> the

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
we have to make an upgrade after the

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.030 
we have to make an upgrade after the
positions<00:01:33.360> we<00:01:33.450> already<00:01:33.750> got<00:01:33.930> it<00:01:34.680> makes<00:01:34.890> it<00:01:35.009> a

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
positions we already got it makes it a

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.460 
positions we already got it makes it a
little<00:01:35.130> easier<00:01:35.310> to<00:01:35.549> make<00:01:35.700> coins<00:01:35.850> back<00:01:36.470> since

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
little easier to make coins back since

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.420 
little easier to make coins back since
we<00:01:37.619> have<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.829> highest<00:01:37.979> overall<00:01:38.159> position

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.520 
we have the highest overall position
like<00:01:38.729> if<00:01:38.880> a<00:01:38.970> 91<00:01:39.329> right<00:01:39.509> guard<00:01:39.720> comes<00:01:39.900> out<00:01:40.049> when

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
like if a 91 right guard comes out when

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.260 
like if a 91 right guard comes out when
we<00:01:40.619> put<00:01:40.799> a<00:01:40.829> 90<00:01:41.189> over<00:01:41.460> all<00:01:41.579> right<00:01:41.820> guard<00:01:42.060> on<00:01:42.180> the
