00:01:13.419 --> 00:01:13.429 
would've been okay take 3800 pretty

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:16.719 
would've been okay take 3800 pretty
hefty<00:01:13.700> sum<00:01:13.970> there<00:01:14.179> I<00:01:14.979> mean<00:01:15.979> I<00:01:16.009> could<00:01:16.340> set<00:01:16.550> on

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729 
hefty sum there I mean I could set on

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:19.690 
hefty sum there I mean I could set on
and<00:01:17.319> he<00:01:18.319> wouldn't<00:01:18.590> have<00:01:18.740> an<00:01:18.890> answer<00:01:19.159> I

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
and he wouldn't have an answer I

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.070 
and he wouldn't have an answer I
actually<00:01:22.240> especially<00:01:23.240> that<00:01:23.270> much<00:01:23.450> back<00:01:23.600> row<00:01:23.840> I

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 
actually especially that much back row I

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.279 
actually especially that much back row I
think<00:01:24.319> I'm<00:01:24.380> gonna<00:01:24.500> have<00:01:24.619> to<00:01:24.710> set<00:01:24.860> that<00:01:24.979> on<00:01:25.009> this

00:01:26.279 --> 00:01:26.289 
think I'm gonna have to set that on this

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:28.630 
think I'm gonna have to set that on this

birthing<00:03:40.030> like<00:03:40.330> every<00:03:40.600> fight<00:03:40.750> up<00:03:40.870> too<00:03:40.990> much

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:49.220 

because<00:03:45.820> if<00:03:46.060> i<00:03:46.120> go<00:03:46.240> for<00:03:46.420> this<00:03:47.040> it<00:03:48.040> is<00:03:48.160> defensive

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
because if i go for this it is defensive

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.630 
because if i go for this it is defensive
but<00:03:50.230> he<00:03:50.410> can<00:03:50.530> still<00:03:50.620> attack<00:03:50.890> this<00:03:51.130> and<00:03:51.370> i'll

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.640 
but he can still attack this and i'll

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.700 
but he can still attack this and i'll
have<00:03:51.880> to<00:03:52.030> low<00:03:52.150> life<00:03:52.360> so<00:03:52.690> at<00:03:53.080> then<00:03:53.260> today<00:03:53.440> i<00:03:53.470> feel

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:53.710 
have to low life so at then today i feel

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:56.010 
have to low life so at then today i feel
like<00:03:53.830> this<00:03:53.950> is<00:03:54.070> better<00:03:54.220> i<00:03:54.600> don't<00:03:55.600> think<00:03:55.750> i<00:03:55.810> have

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:56.020 
like this is better i don't think i have
