00:04:10.589 --> 00:04:10.599 
the bridge so of course you know most of

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:11.789 
the bridge so of course you know most of
the<00:04:10.690> bridges<00:04:10.870> you've<00:04:11.109> seen<00:04:11.319> the<00:04:11.470> game<00:04:11.620> are

00:04:11.789 --> 00:04:11.799 
the bridges you've seen the game are

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:13.979 
the bridges you've seen the game are
still<00:04:12.280> pretty<00:04:12.669> bare-bones<00:04:13.120> when<00:04:13.540> it<00:04:13.629> comes<00:04:13.810> to

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989 
still pretty bare-bones when it comes to

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:16.409 
still pretty bare-bones when it comes to
the<00:04:14.079> monitors<00:04:14.470> and<00:04:14.650> screens<00:04:15.299> they're<00:04:16.299> going

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:16.419 
the monitors and screens they're going

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:18.349 
the monitors and screens they're going
to<00:04:16.479> be<00:04:16.539> chock<00:04:16.750> full<00:04:16.989> of<00:04:17.019> stuff

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 
the actual final game and since you guys

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:29.600 
the actual final game and since you guys
haven't<00:04:22.590> seen<00:04:23.870> the<00:04:24.870> Roland<00:04:28.400> sorry<00:04:29.400> it's<00:04:29.550> over

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
haven't seen the Roland sorry it's over

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.520 
haven't seen the Roland sorry it's over
here<00:04:29.819> haven't<00:04:30.599> seen<00:04:30.689> the<00:04:30.780> ruling<00:04:31.080> in<00:04:31.229> space

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
here haven't seen the ruling in space

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:41.710 
here haven't seen the ruling in space
yet<00:04:31.830> we<00:04:32.280> thought<00:04:32.460> we<00:04:32.939> could<00:04:32.969> show<00:04:33.210> you<00:04:33.270> here

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:41.720 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:46.010 

so<00:04:42.720> it's<00:04:42.870> pretty<00:04:43.080> large<00:04:43.350> ship<00:04:44.150> but<00:04:45.150> we<00:04:45.750> were

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 
so it's pretty large ship but we were

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:47.360 
so it's pretty large ship but we were
pretty<00:04:46.050> happy<00:04:46.320> with<00:04:46.590> how<00:04:46.650> it<00:04:46.800> looks<00:04:46.830> so<00:04:47.100> far

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
pretty happy with how it looks so far

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:51.920 
pretty happy with how it looks so far
and<00:04:49.760> we're<00:04:50.760> still<00:04:50.970> going<00:04:51.060> to<00:04:51.120> probably<00:04:51.420> modify

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
and we're still going to probably modify

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:55.130 
and we're still going to probably modify
a<00:04:51.960> little<00:04:52.620> bits<00:04:52.800> and<00:04:52.920> pieces<00:04:53.280> of<00:04:53.400> it<00:04:54.140> having

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:55.140 
a little bits and pieces of it having

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:59.150 
a little bits and pieces of it having
gotten<00:04:55.320> the<00:04:55.410> chance<00:04:55.590> yet<00:04:55.860> but<00:04:57.320> we<00:04:58.320> were<00:04:58.710> pretty

00:04:59.150 --> 00:04:59.160 
gotten the chance yet but we were pretty

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.700 
gotten the chance yet but we were pretty
excited<00:04:59.430> to<00:04:59.940> add<00:05:00.660> it<00:05:00.870> to<00:05:01.020> our<00:05:01.050> family<00:05:01.620> of

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:01.710 
excited to add it to our family of

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:09.710 
excited to add it to our family of
growing<00:05:02.070> um<00:05:03.650> spaceships<00:05:05.180> and<00:05:08.510> yeah<00:05:09.510> we're

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:09.720

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:14.220 
growing um spaceships and yeah we're
pretty<00:05:09.810> excited

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:14.230 

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:18.180

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:24.660 
of mass upgraded shields and a few other
cool<00:05:21.670> things<00:05:22.060> and<00:05:22.890> I<00:05:23.890> really<00:05:24.250> like<00:05:24.400> how<00:05:24.550> it's

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:24.670

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:26.500 
come together it's one of my favorite

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.850 
come together it's one of my favorite
ships<00:05:26.710> now<00:05:26.980> the<00:05:27.970> a<00:05:28.420> lot<00:05:28.900> of<00:05:29.050> the<00:05:29.230> main<00:05:29.560> rooms

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:29.860 
ships now the a lot of the main rooms

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:33.030 
ships now the a lot of the main rooms
are<00:05:30.130> really<00:05:30.310> interconnected<00:05:31.560> so<00:05:32.560> it's<00:05:32.980> like

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:33.040 
are really interconnected so it's like

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:34.740 
are really interconnected so it's like
really<00:05:33.400> quick<00:05:33.580> access<00:05:33.850> to<00:05:34.210> the<00:05:34.300> weapons<00:05:34.600> room

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:34.750 
really quick access to the weapons room

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:37.800 
really quick access to the weapons room
the<00:05:35.470> science<00:05:36.280> lab<00:05:36.490> and<00:05:36.940> the<00:05:37.180> bridge<00:05:37.390> all<00:05:37.630> right

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:37.810 
the science lab and the bridge all right

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:39.570 
the science lab and the bridge all right
next<00:05:37.960> to<00:05:38.140> each<00:05:38.230> other<00:05:38.460> certainly<00:05:39.460> an

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:39.580 
next to each other certainly an

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:43.650 
next to each other certainly an
advantage<00:05:40.180> in<00:05:40.390> these<00:05:40.540> in<00:05:41.020> this<00:05:41.140> game<00:05:41.670> so<00:05:42.670> this

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:43.660 
advantage in these in this game so this

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:45.120 
advantage in these in this game so this
won't<00:05:43.810> be<00:05:43.990> a<00:05:44.020> ship<00:05:44.260> that's<00:05:44.440> unlocked<00:05:44.800> at<00:05:45.040> the

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:45.130 
won't be a ship that's unlocked at the

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:46.500 
won't be a ship that's unlocked at the
start<00:05:45.370> this<00:05:45.520> will<00:05:45.640> be<00:05:45.790> something<00:05:46.120> you<00:05:46.330> have<00:05:46.480> to

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:46.510 
start this will be something you have to

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:49.350 
start this will be something you have to
unlock<00:05:46.950> through<00:05:47.950> a<00:05:47.980> some<00:05:48.520> sort<00:05:48.640> of<00:05:48.790> mission<00:05:48.970> or

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:54.790 
to find out yourself but it's a one of

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:57.570 
to find out yourself but it's a one of
the<00:05:54.850> more<00:05:54.970> powerful<00:05:55.120> ships<00:05:55.510> in<00:05:55.600> the<00:05:55.690> game<00:05:56.580> so

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:57.580

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:01.230 
it's pretty exciting you should have
taken<00:05:59.980> over<00:06:00.190> the<00:06:00.430> turret<00:06:00.700> real<00:06:00.850> quick<00:06:01.030> if<00:06:01.150> you

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:01.240 
taken over the turret real quick if you

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.330 
taken over the turret real quick if you
want<00:06:01.420> oh<00:06:01.600> yeah<00:06:01.840> we've<00:06:02.410> been<00:06:02.680> messing<00:06:03.130> with<00:06:03.220> the

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:03.340 
want oh yeah we've been messing with the

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:06.720 
want oh yeah we've been messing with the
turrets<00:06:04.090> a<00:06:04.180> little<00:06:04.390> bit<00:06:05.490> still<00:06:06.490> pretty<00:06:06.670> early

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:06.730 
turrets a little bit still pretty early

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:10.560 
turrets a little bit still pretty early
but<00:06:08.370> we're<00:06:09.370> starting<00:06:09.820> to<00:06:09.880> add<00:06:09.970> some<00:06:10.300> little

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:10.570 
but we're starting to add some little

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:14.300 
but we're starting to add some little
bit<00:06:10.660> more<00:06:10.810> variety<00:06:11.110> in<00:06:11.620> the<00:06:12.010> weaponry<00:06:12.640> so

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:14.310 
bit more variety in the weaponry so

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:16.800 
bit more variety in the weaponry so

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:16.810 
there's actually animations associated

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:19.410 
there's actually animations associated
with<00:06:17.020> this<00:06:17.140> turret<00:06:17.640> but<00:06:18.640> they're<00:06:18.820> not<00:06:18.940> there
