everything so let me tell you what I did
that<00:00:50.039> think<00:00:50.460> may<00:00:50.609> have<00:00:50.730> made<00:00:50.879> a<00:00:50.910> difference

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
that think may have made a difference

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.000 
that think may have made a difference
i'm<00:00:51.629> using<00:00:52.590> a<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:53.550> killed<00:00:53.969> rare-earth<00:00:55.010> openal

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
i'm using a the killed rare-earth openal

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.490 
i'm using a the killed rare-earth openal
cleanser<00:00:56.460> which<00:00:57.030> I<00:00:57.239> don't<00:00:57.809> really<00:00:57.989> think<00:00:58.109> is

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
cleanser which I don't really think is

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.139 
cleanser which I don't really think is
making<00:00:58.769> much<00:00:59.100> of<00:00:59.129> a<00:00:59.370> difference<00:00:59.730> but<00:00:59.789> it's<00:01:00.000> not

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
making much of a difference but it's not

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.509 
making much of a difference but it's not
making<00:01:00.390> things<00:01:00.629> worse<00:01:01.440> I<00:01:01.859> think<00:01:02.250> most

00:01:02.509 --> 00:01:02.519 
making things worse I think most

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:08.050 
making things worse I think most
cleaners<00:01:03.000> for<00:01:03.210> me<00:01:03.449> cleansers<00:01:04.440> are<00:01:06.110> okay<00:01:07.110> they

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
cleaners for me cleansers are okay they

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.749 
cleaners for me cleansers are okay they
seem<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.090> do<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.360> job<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.930> only<00:01:10.229> time<00:01:10.500> when<00:01:10.759> to

00:01:11.749 --> 00:01:11.759 
seem to do the job the only time when to

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:13.399 
seem to do the job the only time when to
think<00:01:12.060> that<00:01:12.330> cleansers<00:01:12.810> don't<00:01:13.049> work<00:01:13.200> for<00:01:13.380> me

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
think that cleansers don't work for me

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.260 
think that cleansers don't work for me
is<00:01:13.590> if<00:01:13.710> they<00:01:13.830> have<00:01:13.950> benzoyl<00:01:14.340> peroxide<00:01:14.970> or

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
is if they have benzoyl peroxide or

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.570 
is if they have benzoyl peroxide or
salicylic<00:01:15.960> acid<00:01:16.740> because<00:01:16.860> it<00:01:17.040> tends<00:01:17.220> to<00:01:17.310> grab

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
salicylic acid because it tends to grab

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.090 
salicylic acid because it tends to grab
my<00:01:17.700> skin<00:01:17.970> out<00:01:18.090> most<00:01:18.750> gentle<00:01:19.350> regular<00:01:19.920> old

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
my skin out most gentle regular old

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.600 
my skin out most gentle regular old
cleansers<00:01:20.670> work<00:01:20.970> well<00:01:21.210> for<00:01:21.390> me<00:01:21.540> so<00:01:22.400> I've<00:01:23.400> been

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
one that i was using was on vacation was

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.580 
one that i was using was on vacation was
by<00:01:58.380> a<00:01:58.409> line<00:01:59.340> for<00:01:59.820> me<00:02:00.000> and<00:02:00.149> called<00:02:00.420> lab<00:02:00.810> results

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
by a line for me and called lab results

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.429 
by a line for me and called lab results
and<00:02:01.799> it<00:02:02.430> was<00:02:02.640> one<00:02:03.000> percent<00:02:03.479> salicylic<00:02:04.020> acid

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
and it was one percent salicylic acid

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.340 
and it was one percent salicylic acid
this<00:02:04.590> is<00:02:04.770> two<00:02:04.950> percent<00:02:05.340> this<00:02:05.520> is<00:02:05.700> 1.5<00:02:06.390> it<00:02:06.990> seems

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
this is two percent this is 1.5 it seems

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.940 
this is two percent this is 1.5 it seems
like<00:02:07.619> the<00:02:07.860> other<00:02:08.100> one<00:02:08.369> by<00:02:09.030> man<00:02:09.360> was<00:02:09.780> a<00:02:10.170> little

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
like the other one by man was a little

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.340 
like the other one by man was a little
more<00:02:11.070> effective<00:02:11.190> it<00:02:11.880> was

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
more effective it was

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.640 
more effective it was
good<00:02:12.560> better<00:02:12.890> at<00:02:13.130> drawing<00:02:13.720> up<00:02:14.720> the<00:02:14.780> pimples

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
good better at drawing up the pimples

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.410 
good better at drawing up the pimples
but<00:02:15.800> I<00:02:15.860> think<00:02:16.190> that's<00:02:16.370> because<00:02:16.550> it<00:02:17.060> had<00:02:17.210> more

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
but I think that's because it had more

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.320 
but I think that's because it had more
oil<00:02:17.890> so<00:02:18.890> this<00:02:19.130> is<00:02:19.160> what<00:02:19.520> I<00:02:19.550> was<00:02:19.760> sliding<00:02:20.000> over

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
oil so this is what I was sliding over

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.360 
oil so this is what I was sliding over
my<00:02:20.390> whole<00:02:20.690> face<00:02:21.040> while<00:02:22.040> I<00:02:22.070> was<00:02:22.220> on<00:02:22.310> vacation

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
my whole face while I was on vacation

for<00:04:32.770> long<00:04:33.580> term<00:04:33.910> so<00:04:34.690> like<00:04:35.380> I<00:04:35.530> put<00:04:36.010> it<00:04:36.130> on<00:04:36.220> today

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.850 
for long term so like I put it on today
i'll<00:04:36.730> probably<00:04:37.000> put<00:04:37.240> it<00:04:37.300> on<00:04:37.540> like<00:04:37.780> once<00:04:38.650> or

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
i'll probably put it on like once or

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.480 
i'll probably put it on like once or
twice<00:04:39.040> a<00:04:39.190> week<00:04:40.200> this<00:04:41.200> a<00:04:41.410> writer<00:04:41.889> says<00:04:42.160> you<00:04:42.310> can

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 
use it three to four times a week but I

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:45.990 
use it three to four times a week but I
probably<00:04:44.919> want<00:04:45.130> only<00:04:45.280> do<00:04:45.460> once<00:04:45.700> a<00:04:45.850> week

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:33.270 
probably just more of this thing just

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:35.850 
probably just more of this thing just
doing<00:05:34.270> one<00:05:34.570> exfoliation<00:05:35.229> because<00:05:35.560> I've<00:05:35.710> been

exfoliation to get everything off and

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:42.930 
exfoliation to get everything off and
