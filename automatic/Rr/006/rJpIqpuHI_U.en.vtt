one hundred percent say that this is a

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.279 
one hundred percent say that this is a
work<00:00:48.870> but<00:00:49.260> TMZ<00:00:49.890> is<00:00:50.100> reporting<00:00:50.219> on<00:00:50.879> it<00:00:50.910> and

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
seems pretty damn legit because it's

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.020 
seems pretty damn legit because it's
also<00:00:53.730> trending<00:00:54.090> on<00:00:54.300> Twitter<00:00:54.600> and<00:00:55.129> like

also trending on Twitter and like

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.229 
also trending on Twitter and like
from<00:00:57.469> my<00:00:58.469> house<00:00:58.710> shows<00:00:59.039> never<00:00:59.550> trends<00:01:00.090> on

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
from my house shows never trends on

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.619 
from my house shows never trends on
Twitter<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:00.809> like<00:01:01.620> never<00:01:01.980> hardly<00:01:02.760> ever<00:01:02.969> do

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
Twitter and like never hardly ever do

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.810 
Twitter and like never hardly ever do
they<00:01:03.780> use<00:01:04.320> house<00:01:04.650> show<00:01:04.920> things<00:01:05.309> as<00:01:05.519> a<00:01:05.549> work

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
they use house show things as a work

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.030 
they use house show things as a work
especially<00:01:06.180> on<00:01:06.600> these<00:01:06.799> international<00:01:07.799> tours

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
especially on these international tours

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.859 
especially on these international tours
so<00:01:08.490> if<00:01:09.210> I<00:01:09.570> guess<00:01:09.930> this<00:01:10.110> was<00:01:10.260> a<00:01:10.320> hundred<00:01:10.619> percent

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:11.869 
so if I guess this was a hundred percent

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:15.940 
so if I guess this was a hundred percent
legitimate<00:01:12.869> so<00:01:13.770> yes<00:01:14.100> he<00:01:14.280> suspended<00:01:14.939> or

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
legitimate so yes he suspended or

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.190 
legitimate so yes he suspended or
desecrating<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.340> flag<00:01:17.670> or<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.869> term<00:01:19.020> is

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
desecrating the flag or the term is

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.350 
desecrating the flag or the term is
denigrating<00:01:20.070> what<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.340> hell<00:01:20.549> was<00:01:20.790> a<00:01:20.820> meeting

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360
