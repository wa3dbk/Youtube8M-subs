00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
not obviously all these heists are going

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.660 
not obviously all these heists are going
to<00:01:33.450> be<00:01:33.600> a<00:01:33.810> multiplayer<00:01:34.619> activity<00:01:35.189> so<00:01:35.400> you<00:01:35.490> can

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
to be a multiplayer activity so you can

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.370 
to be a multiplayer activity so you can
do<00:01:35.790> it<00:01:35.880> with<00:01:36.030> other<00:01:36.450> people<00:01:36.659> like<00:01:37.140> crew

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
do it with other people like crew

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.990 
do it with other people like crew
members<00:01:37.770> i<00:01:37.829> can<00:01:37.979> imagine<00:01:38.369> you<00:01:38.640> have<00:01:38.790> to<00:01:38.850> have<00:01:38.939> a

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
members i can imagine you have to have a

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.010 
members i can imagine you have to have a
cruise<00:01:39.210> to<00:01:39.240> do<00:01:39.450> this<00:01:39.630> it<00:01:39.810> would<00:01:39.930> otherwise

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
cruise to do this it would otherwise

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.440 
cruise to do this it would otherwise
it'd<00:01:40.409> be<00:01:40.530> a<00:01:40.560> little<00:01:40.770> bit<00:01:40.890> silly<00:01:41.100> but<00:01:41.250> I<00:01:41.640> imagine

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
it'd be a little bit silly but I imagine

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.429 
it'd be a little bit silly but I imagine
that's<00:01:42.600> what<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.780> crew<00:01:42.960> feature<00:01:43.200> was

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
that's what the crew feature was

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.499 
that's what the crew feature was
actually<00:01:43.740> for<00:01:44.009> but<00:01:44.310> I<00:01:44.579> could<00:01:45.090> be<00:01:45.119> wrong<00:01:45.210> on

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
actually for but I could be wrong on

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.240 
actually for but I could be wrong on
that<00:01:45.570> and<00:01:45.960> I<00:01:46.590> mean<00:01:46.799> so<00:01:46.860> you<00:01:46.920> can<00:01:47.040> make<00:01:47.100> more

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
that and I mean so you can make more

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.670 
that and I mean so you can make more
money<00:01:47.310> from<00:01:47.759> doing<00:01:48.119> better<00:01:48.750> heist<00:01:49.020> obviously

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
money from doing better heist obviously

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.080 
money from doing better heist obviously
is<00:01:49.740> gonna<00:01:49.860> be<00:01:49.950> different<00:01:50.130> levels<00:01:50.579> of<00:01:50.729> high<00:01:50.939> so

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
is gonna be different levels of high so

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.609 
is gonna be different levels of high so
you<00:01:51.119> can<00:01:51.299> do<00:01:51.479> if<00:01:52.200> I<00:01:52.290> don't<00:01:52.409> have<00:01:52.500> any

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619
