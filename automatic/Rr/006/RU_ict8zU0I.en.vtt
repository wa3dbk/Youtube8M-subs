00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
slip knot you wind the yarn around in a

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.940 
slip knot you wind the yarn around in a
loop<00:01:14.490> in<00:01:14.729> a<00:01:14.820> circle<00:01:15.270> you<00:01:15.470> place<00:01:16.470> your<00:01:16.770> hook

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950

loop in a circle you place your hook
inside<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.909> loop<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.360> you<00:01:18.870> pull<00:01:19.140> it<00:01:19.290> through

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
inside the loop and you pull it through

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.540 
inside the loop and you pull it through
and<00:01:19.860> you<00:01:19.980> make<00:01:20.130> a<00:01:20.159> slip<00:01:20.670> knot<00:01:20.700> and<00:01:22.370> then<00:01:23.370> you're
