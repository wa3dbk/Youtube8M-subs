let's<00:02:16.280> I<00:02:16.720> think<00:02:17.720> over<00:02:17.840> there<00:02:17.990> called<00:02:19.720> they

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
let's I think over there called they

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.340

so I could get a good video of her um
trying<00:05:55.710> to<00:05:55.770> think<00:05:55.980> what<00:05:56.130> all<00:05:56.220> some<00:05:56.490> aggression

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:56.880 
trying to think what all some aggression

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:59.180 
trying to think what all some aggression
these<00:05:57.600> fish<00:05:57.840> are<00:05:57.870> known<00:05:58.290> to<00:05:58.530> be<00:05:58.560> aggressive<00:05:58.770> to

00:05:59.180 --> 00:05:59.190 
these fish are known to be aggressive to

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:00.380 
these fish are known to be aggressive to
others<00:05:59.490> but<00:05:59.640> then<00:05:59.760> some<00:05:59.970> people<00:06:00.000> should<00:06:00.360> have

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:00.390 
others but then some people should have

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:02.270 
others but then some people should have
tried<00:06:00.690> in<00:06:01.290> my<00:06:01.440> experience<00:06:01.890> they've<00:06:02.130> been

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:02.280 
tried in my experience they've been

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:04.760 
tried in my experience they've been
mines<00:06:02.670> been<00:06:02.880> very<00:06:03.120> very<00:06:03.270> shy<00:06:03.570> so<00:06:03.900> I<00:06:04.410> would<00:06:04.620> say

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:04.770 
mines been very very shy so I would say

um<00:06:19.350> I'm<00:06:20.350> trying<00:06:20.590> to<00:06:20.650> think<00:06:20.800> of<00:06:20.890> what<00:06:20.950> else<00:06:21.010> i

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:21.160 
um I'm trying to think of what else i

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.430 
um I'm trying to think of what else i
should<00:06:21.190> mention<00:06:21.400> i<00:06:22.200> think<00:06:23.200> i've<00:06:23.320> already

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:23.440 
should mention i think i've already

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:24.510 
should mention i think i've already
mentioned<00:06:23.590> these<00:06:23.800> fish<00:06:24.040> actually<00:06:24.340> part

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:24.520 
mentioned these fish actually part

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:28.140 
mentioned these fish actually part
reptile<00:06:24.670> i<00:06:25.980> mean<00:06:26.980> they<00:06:27.490> look<00:06:27.610> more<00:06:27.820> snake-like

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:28.150 
reptile i mean they look more snake-like

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:30.320 
reptile i mean they look more snake-like
than<00:06:28.540> actually<00:06:28.810> fish<00:06:28.990> like<00:06:29.230> some<00:06:29.500> at<00:06:29.860> times

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:30.330 
than actually fish like some at times

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:34.560 
than actually fish like some at times
they're<00:06:31.330> very<00:06:31.540> cool<00:06:31.840> fish<00:06:32.050> and<00:06:33.330> don't<00:06:34.330> feed

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:34.570 
they're very cool fish and don't feed

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:35.970 
they're very cool fish and don't feed
them<00:06:34.660> anything<00:06:34.900> bigger<00:06:35.260> than<00:06:35.350> what<00:06:35.740> you<00:06:35.860> think

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:35.980 
them anything bigger than what you think

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:38.460 
them anything bigger than what you think
they<00:06:36.130> can<00:06:36.250> swallow<00:06:36.550> and<00:06:36.910> the<00:06:37.810> room<00:06:38.260> their

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:38.470 
they can swallow and the room their

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:40.110 
they can swallow and the room their
stomach<00:06:38.770> is<00:06:38.920> not<00:06:39.220> that<00:06:39.400> much<00:06:39.520> bigger<00:06:39.670> than<00:06:39.820> I

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:40.120 
stomach is not that much bigger than I

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:42.720 
stomach is not that much bigger than I
so<00:06:41.050> if<00:06:41.440> you<00:06:41.500> feed<00:06:41.710> them<00:06:41.890> you<00:06:42.370> should<00:06:42.550> move<00:06:42.670> your

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:42.730 
so if you feed them you should move your

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:43.860 
so if you feed them you should move your
feed<00:06:42.910> them<00:06:43.030> two<00:06:43.180> or<00:06:43.210> three<00:06:43.450> of<00:06:43.540> those<00:06:43.600> pellets

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:43.870 
feed them two or three of those pellets

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:47.490 
feed them two or three of those pellets
and<00:06:44.290> that<00:06:44.410> call<00:06:44.710> good<00:06:45.750> um<00:06:46.750> the<00:06:46.990> growth<00:06:47.200> comes

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:47.500 
and that call good um the growth comes

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:49.500 
and that call good um the growth comes
in<00:06:47.650> spurts<00:06:47.800> so<00:06:48.490> both<00:06:48.730> thicken<00:06:49.090> up<00:06:49.180> like<00:06:49.390> this

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:49.510 
in spurts so both thicken up like this

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:53.640 
in spurts so both thicken up like this
one<00:06:49.660> is<00:06:49.750> doing<00:06:49.840> right<00:06:49.990> now<00:06:52.200> doc<00:06:53.200> picking<00:06:53.500> up

00:06:57.750 --> 00:06:57.760 
and then they'll all sensing stretch out

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:07.200 
and then they'll all sensing stretch out
