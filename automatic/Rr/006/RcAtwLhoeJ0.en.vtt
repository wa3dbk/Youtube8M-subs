00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.779
 hello creative 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.910
 I hope you enjoy today's tutorial 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:24.890
 particularly because we join our two 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.710
 those passions in our channel 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:32.860
 are the most followed ones to make themselves i 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:35.660
 bracelets and the Arab lebens experience 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:40.070
 then the necessary for this tutorial 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:44.269
 and beads and possibly two colors a 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:46.549
 your choice of user glue or this 

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:48.159
 bostik super clear but you if you have the 

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:54.500
 hot glue and much much better 

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:58.699
 then the round frame found in 7 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:01.400
 dell'ikea or in the shock version in 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:03.440
 dance beads that is now coming down into 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:06.170
 newsstand if you are lucky find the 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.159
 circle then you need the classic 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.570
 baking paper 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:14.360
 carla the board and if for convenience 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.400
 you prefer to use pliers, yes, yes, to yours 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.340
 tweezers let's see what 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.830
 we want to combine today first thing from 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:25.070
 do is take our frame e 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:28.190
 decide what the circumference will be 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:31.790
 we want to use I will use null first round 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:35.060
 but the second because this is the turn of 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.500
 bracelet that suits me better then 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.810
 choose if you have an arm more 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.730
 small of course go to tighten if 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:44.840
 your arm and bigger choose 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:48.920
 instead the maximum circle first thing to 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:52.880
 do is take ours ours 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:56.890
 beads and take a complete tour of the 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.890
 our circumference 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.390
 sees circle in this way 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.250
 second it is very easy and takes 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.160
 of our baking paper cover 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.500
 totally our circle take the 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.420
 iron already hot and place it up for 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.000
 a few seconds so that the 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.580
 circumference as you can see starts a 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.190
 melt you'll notice why it will start one 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:41.840
 show our rings well well 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:44.480
 through the paper a few seconds 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:47.200
 when we see that everything has melted 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.200
 we can be satisfied 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:03.170
 Here it is, it completely comes off me 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:08.510
 for safety still gives a small one 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:11.269
 hit the iron be careful with your hands 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:13.790
 obviously and continue until you are 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:18.799
 sure your job is not 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:21.290
 nice solid and out we continue with 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:24.079
 other dini circles 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:26.630
 I have prepared two other circles we see 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:29.870
 this once it was told 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:33.400
 I can safely stairs and I can 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:36.019
 go and compose my bracelet 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.620
 last step for our project is 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:41.030
 that of assembling ours 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.540
 bracelets so they are a little too much 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:46.209
 soft so they could break 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.650
 instead of joining three of them 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:50.720
 they will become beautiful bracelets 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.389
 and much more resistant what to do 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.190
 take the bracelet and I decide 

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:57.950
 that this will be the part that you see 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:59.959
 so that little more pitted one 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:02.569
 crushed by iron instead I will go to 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:03.260
 paste and I will pass a few drops of 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:05.959
 glue 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:08.750
 as I told you if you have hot glue 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:14.209
 it's very, very, very much better 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:17.140
 I'm still using a clear bostik 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:19.960
 I take my bracelet 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:25.090
 next and tac 

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:25.090
 very simply it is continuous 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:34.820
 I can use this part for example that 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:37.730
 it is more squashed by ta ta ta ta 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:40.670
 ta ta ta glue fillet 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:42.710
 I recommend I am using a piece of 

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:45.710
 wood below as you can see for not 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:47.690
 soiling the table you also put a 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:50.180
 handkerchief a paper journal o 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:52.630
 something that can protect you from this 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:58.490
 point I want the orange to be in the middle 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:05:03.710
 it's the same I put it in half crush 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:08.390
 he has little right if it seems to me that 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:09.260
 is a little leaning on one side or 

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:12.020
 on the other 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:13.790
 and I wait a couple of minutes in my case 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:15.880
 let it dry if you use the glue a 

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:19.150
 hot you are ready to put it 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:23.120
 let's try as we are used to 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:26.900
 bracelet is the same as this color 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:28.420
 I love it, but it's not 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:30.740
 particularly hard 

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:34.010
 let's try this and do this one 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:36.290
 little more from phil minucci and used lepis 

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:37.910
 the Ikea and the pizzas a little more 

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:40.190
 large that I had found in a 

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:42.710
 you see the toymaker in an all 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:45.290
 it seems to me of March I hope this 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:47.720
 you like it as a tutorial made me 

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:49.880
 literally go crazy because you can do 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:53.450
 lots of fun things and lots 

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:55.430
 of colors in the trash made your own 

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:58.630
 comments a big kiss 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:58.630
 see you soon. Bye
