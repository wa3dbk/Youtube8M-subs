 Looks like he is already consumed 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.070
 do not know exactly where the 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.070
 accident site is located 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.470
 and become this spooky scenario

 we are following today 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.949
 we are in the frame of a tunnel full 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.570
 Exercise we get a scenario rinsed 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.510
 or a traffic accident between two 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.539
 cars with three patients involved 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:33.000
 or affected at one 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.030
 scenario in the way of listening to the

 provided alarm and disengagement order 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:40.040
 that means we have a brand and a 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.090
 suspected trapped person 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.280
 corresponding forces alerted 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.579
 that would be 1 deleted firefighting 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.950
 in the upper part of the tunnel and one 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.440
 Firefighting group in the lower 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.000
 area of ​​the tunnel to be completed 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.430
 through a unit for technical 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.379
 help performance and why exactly they drive 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.710
 not easy in such scenarios in 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.239
 A scenario in the tunnel 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.840
 purely ask is for your own protection 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.600
 Not 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.580
 we have and brandis vehicle and the 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.760
 toxic fumes in the tunnel 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.010
 It will be the tunnel and a program 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.270
 vacated so that everyone else involved 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.110
 leave in tunnel bring the 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.049
 flue gases

 we position ourselves from before and 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.140
 go with the self-protection 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.780
 respirators in the terror around 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.540
 to explore how big the extent is one 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.610
 perform first exploration and then 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.210
 continue to decide how to continue 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.210
 is proceeded 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.850
 we get here 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.500
 Every four years will be under realistic 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.540
 conditions a great exercise
