 I bring the recipe for face cookies 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.519
 that what he will do is not more than the ground 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.639
 of soybeans after extracting the 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:18.029
 soy milk and these cookies know 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.980
 delicious and are very nutritious and the 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.830
 I leave with the step by step of the recipe 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.820
 We put to preheat our oven and I 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.960
 I put it 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:31.830
 at 400 degrees fahrenheit with 40 minutes 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:36.340
 I'm going to leave it this time ten minutes 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:38.530
 warming up and so you're ready to 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.030
 moment of it finish the mixture and 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.340
 put the cookies to make our 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:46.059
 cookies we're going to need a bar 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:47.620
 of 100 grams of butter but if it is 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:51.430
 a little less does not matter too 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:54.970
 we are going to need or face that is beans 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:57.910
 or already ground or after you extract the 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:59.829
 soybean you have this residue and with this 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.469
 can they make cookies then we're going to 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:04.899
 use a regular cup also 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:06.759
 let's throw an egg they're going to 

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:08.740
 We are going to add sugar 

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:12.360
 oatmeal and we will also add 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.360
 little wheat flour 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:20.290
 the consistency of this mass is not like 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:24.820
 the traditional one of normal cookies 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:27.399
 this is like more granola style 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:31.509
 the granola cookies that remain like this 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:35.280
 as deformed and is the advantage of the o 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:39.039
 face that is replacing a little bit to 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.590
 the flour but it gets small because 

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:43.250
 so that it sticks only well 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:47.710
 little nothing more 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:50.630
 and having everything scrambled and we have left 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:53.030
 ready to make our cookies and 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.550
 let's put them in the mold so they are 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.290
 how are the cookies do not have to 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:00.590
 to be perfect because they are like 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:05.140
 crunch style and as well as bran's 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:09.679
 wheat or oats and these we put to the 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:12.440
 Heat in the oven until the 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:16.670
 shore as half toast more or less 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:18.590
 They last 20 25 minutes to toast because 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.260
 They are small and good girls are like 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.720
 how are the cookies already finished and 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:27.290
 baked and the truth was very rich 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.959

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.130
 you can add more ingredients 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:33.860
 You can even add raisins 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.989
 chocolate or what you most are 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:40.290

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:43.980

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:46.349
