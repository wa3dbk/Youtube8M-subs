00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.440
 his dashboard 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.339
 touch on the left side we have a speedometer and 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.789
 total mileage 

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:20.890
 total mileage is no longer here with 

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:23.880
 on the right side we have signal 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:29.259
 high beam neutral bulbs 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:33.780
 fuel level and turning everything here at 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:36.790
 we have 2 buttons 1 from 1 toggles 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.100
 she thinks then who in the world is in kilometers 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:41.710
 for Russia, it is probably quite 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:46.470
 unnecessarily right button at us toggles 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:50.040
 total mileage per mileage 1000 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.040
 what do we get 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:04.010
 that sounds like this music means organs 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:09.770
 control all the same high beam 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:11.480
 flasher light turns signal control 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.530
 throttle so how is it 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:18.710
 carburetor it is derived on the steering wheel 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:22.670
 engine block light switch 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:26.530
 and starting the starter means everything is closed here 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:29.860
 plastic is not where to climb 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:33.050
 it is impossible to solely have a window 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:38.840
 here it means to control the level 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:41.630
 engine oil with the left side all 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:48.229
 also if you are going somewhere you need 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:53.330
 be sure to shoot the plastic here 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:57.470
 us sidushka so removed under the seat 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:02:00.460
 we have a small box battery 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:02.650
 for zippo alarm 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:07.180
 here I took part for you 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:10.030
 plastic look in there so here we are 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:12.400
 see the edge, but when the abs is plastic 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.780
 it is certainly closed management 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.950
 air damper 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.870
 Here's the engine room under this 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:23.050
 plastic 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:25.380
 to climb there you have to weigh plastic 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.910
 to shoot otherwise not to climb 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.069
 then pay attention to the motorcycle 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.220
 only one side tripping center 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:36.250
 no if you serve 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:42.840
 needing a tackle means all these 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:45.640
 here are the red panels here on the tank here 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:48.610
 this is all strip mass nothing painted 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.120
 No, it means you probably will feel bad 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:54.640
 it is seen 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:58.569
 color bright red scarlet, respectively 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:05.319
 central shock absorber not 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:07.890
 regulated further we'll take a look 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:11.730
 value on the right side of the steering column 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.730
 on between code 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.500
 engines more numbers on 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:19.640
 no motorcycle 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.640
 What more can be said 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:26.370
 nice that the welds are all smooth 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:33.599
 quite neat at all with a motorcycle 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.599
 carefully assembled 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:40.060
 do not read sizu suzuki sx p here 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:44.310
 Well, in general, that's basically it and everything
