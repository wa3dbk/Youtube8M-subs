00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
and as you can see here I'm slowly

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.700 
and as you can see here I'm slowly
running<00:00:44.700> windows<00:00:45.480> it's<00:00:46.320> going<00:00:46.440> to<00:00:46.469> take<00:00:46.530> quite

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
running windows it's going to take quite

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.610 
running windows it's going to take quite
a<00:00:46.770> bit<00:00:46.860> of<00:00:46.920> RAM<00:00:47.899> but<00:00:48.899> I<00:00:48.930> didn't<00:00:49.170> really<00:00:49.289> want<00:00:49.559> to

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
a bit of RAM but I didn't really want to

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.740 
a bit of RAM but I didn't really want to
talk<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:49.980> you<00:00:50.039> today<00:00:50.219> about<00:00:50.309> about<00:00:51.210> vmware<00:00:51.510> and

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
talk to you today about about vmware and

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.060 
talk to you today about about vmware and
what<00:00:51.989> it<00:00:52.079> does<00:00:52.199> i<00:00:52.440> just<00:00:52.590> want<00:00:52.710> to<00:00:52.800> show<00:00:53.010> you

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
what it does i just want to show you

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.459 
what it does i just want to show you
quickly<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:53.850> pretty<00:00:54.660> neat<00:00:54.930> feature<00:00:55.170> that's

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
quickly a pretty neat feature that's

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.860 
quickly a pretty neat feature that's
built<00:00:55.620> into<00:00:55.980> vmware<00:00:56.879> and<00:00:57.239> i<00:00:57.360> believe<00:00:57.570> most<00:00:57.719> of

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
built into vmware and i believe most of

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.630 
built into vmware and i believe most of
the<00:00:57.960> others<00:00:58.199> have<00:00:58.440> something<00:00:59.190> similar<00:00:59.340> as

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
the others have something similar as

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.029 
the others have something similar as
well<00:01:00.140> so<00:01:01.140> as<00:01:01.199> you<00:01:01.260> can<00:01:01.379> see<00:01:01.530> here<00:01:01.739> it<00:01:01.829> works

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
well so as you can see here it works

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.910 
well so as you can see here it works
just<00:01:02.640> like<00:01:02.850> windows<00:01:03.149> would<00:01:03.799> except<00:01:04.799> it's

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
just like windows would except it's

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.219 
just like windows would except it's
bound<00:01:05.159> in<00:01:05.400> this<00:01:05.549> box<00:01:05.820> that<00:01:06.330> has<00:01:06.479> this<00:01:06.689> suspend

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
bound in this box that has this suspend

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.100 
bound in this box that has this suspend
and<00:01:07.710> take<00:01:07.890> a<00:01:07.920> snapshot<00:01:08.750> which<00:01:09.750> is<00:01:09.900> a<00:01:09.930> bit

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
and take a snapshot which is a bit

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.310 
and take a snapshot which is a bit
annoying<00:01:10.790> having<00:01:11.790> this<00:01:11.970> window<00:01:12.330> doesn't

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
annoying having this window doesn't

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.370 
annoying having this window doesn't
really<00:01:13.560> do<00:01:13.740> much<00:01:14.689> it<00:01:15.689> works<00:01:15.990> just<00:01:16.140> like

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
really do much it works just like

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.070 
really do much it works just like
windows<00:01:16.560> XP<00:01:17.159> normally<00:01:17.700> does<00:01:17.909> but<00:01:18.900> this

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
windows XP normally does but this

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.560 
windows XP normally does but this
built-in<00:01:19.770> unity<00:01:20.580> button<00:01:21.060> here<00:01:21.270> is<00:01:21.360> pretty

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
built-in unity button here is pretty

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.140 
built-in unity button here is pretty
cool<00:01:21.810> it<00:01:22.530> just<00:01:22.770> got<00:01:22.890> rid<00:01:23.070> of<00:01:23.130> all<00:01:23.250> that<00:01:23.310> so<00:01:24.000> now

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
cool it just got rid of all that so now

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.749 
cool it just got rid of all that so now
we<00:01:24.210> have<00:01:24.530> what<00:01:25.530> looks<00:01:25.560> like<00:01:25.830> a<00:01:25.950> native<00:01:26.369> window

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
we have what looks like a native window

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.200 
we have what looks like a native window
in<00:01:27.030> OS<00:01:27.360> X<00:01:27.600> that's<00:01:28.530> actually<00:01:29.070> running<00:01:29.310> off<00:01:29.670> of

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
in OS X that's actually running off of

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.539 
in OS X that's actually running off of
the<00:01:30.329> XP<00:01:30.780> install<00:01:31.909> um<00:01:32.909> any<00:01:33.360> window<00:01:33.930> we<00:01:34.079> open<00:01:34.549> we

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
the XP install um any window we open we

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.350 
the XP install um any window we open we
can<00:01:35.720> do<00:01:36.720> this<00:01:36.900> with<00:01:37.250> so<00:01:38.250> for<00:01:38.610> instance<00:01:38.640> here<00:01:39.090> we

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
can do this with so for instance here we

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.880 
can do this with so for instance here we
can<00:01:39.479> use<00:01:39.509> this<00:01:39.659> application<00:01:39.840> list<00:01:40.380> and<00:01:40.680> open

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
can use this application list and open

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.560 
can use this application list and open
my<00:01:40.979> computer<00:01:41.040> and<00:01:41.579> we<00:01:42.119> can<00:01:42.240> see<00:01:42.360> that<00:01:42.450> my

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
my computer and we can see that my

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:43.999 
my computer and we can see that my
computer<00:01:42.990> is<00:01:43.079> running<00:01:43.200> just<00:01:43.530> like<00:01:43.619> a<00:01:43.680> wood<00:01:43.890> on

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
computer is running just like a wood on

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.850 
computer is running just like a wood on
a<00:01:44.070> Windows<00:01:44.369> machine<00:01:44.840> I'm<00:01:45.840> again<00:01:46.170> this<00:01:46.380> this<00:01:46.740> is

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
a Windows machine I'm again this this is

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.980 
a Windows machine I'm again this this is
pretty<00:01:47.040> intensive<00:01:47.579> on<00:01:47.729> your<00:01:47.909> computer<00:01:48.630> so<00:01:48.869> if

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
pretty intensive on your computer so if

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.440 
pretty intensive on your computer so if
you<00:01:49.110> have<00:01:49.259> lower<00:01:49.979> end<00:01:50.280> RAM<00:01:50.549> or<00:01:50.579> an<00:01:51.149> older

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
you have lower end RAM or an older

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.569 
you have lower end RAM or an older
version<00:01:51.630> of<00:01:51.930> an<00:01:52.020> ibook<00:01:52.350> or<00:01:52.530> something<00:01:52.890> it's

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
version of an ibook or something it's

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:54.740 
version of an ibook or something it's
not<00:01:53.610> exactly<00:01:54.000> something<00:01:54.119> you<00:01:54.360> can<00:01:54.570> run

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
not exactly something you can run

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.270 
not exactly something you can run
specifically<00:01:55.350> on<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.619> ibook<00:01:55.890> because<00:01:56.130> it's

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
specifically on the ibook because it's

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.429 
specifically on the ibook because it's
not<00:01:56.340> Intel<00:01:56.759> I'm<00:01:57.329> so<00:01:57.659> you<00:01:57.750> will<00:01:57.869> need<00:01:57.990> an<00:01:58.140> Intel

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
not Intel I'm so you will need an Intel

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:03.440 
not Intel I'm so you will need an Intel
machine<00:01:58.710> to<00:01:58.890> run<00:01:58.920> this<00:02:00.829> and<00:02:02.030> everything<00:02:03.030> opens

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
machine to run this and everything opens

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.450
