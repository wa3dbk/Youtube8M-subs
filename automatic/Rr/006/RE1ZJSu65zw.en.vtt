00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.800
 how about friends today's recipe 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.420
 delicious and fresh pejerreyes 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.670
 marinated for those who use a 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.730
 marine and fresh cuisine and that's where the 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.850
 recipe we are going to catch the pejerreyes we 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.669
 we find whole in the market and what 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:41.670
 let's see we're going to make a couple 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:47.040
 of cuts and a cut minus a steak in 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:50.760
 the next one now in the part of the 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:52.820
 belly that are the thorns we have to 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.690
 clean them 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.690
 cutting up 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.720
 and shaping the ethical end 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:11.040
 we have that is how the 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:13.320
 pejerreyes before imagining the good 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.080
 now I have the clean silversides 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.860
 on the plate now we go with the vinaigrette 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.860
 well we take the lemons 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:34.390
 the lemon we are not going to hug him very much without 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:36.510
 crush the shell a lot that's 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:40.790
 quickly 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:45.000
 we get an almost transparent game 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:47.130
 the lemon does not have to be very green 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:52.049
 nor very yellow 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:54.500
 well we already have the lemon juice well 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:57.850
 let's take some parsley 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:02.350
 a good fabric and we are going to cut what 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.350
 previously washed fresh parsley 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.160
 well we cut the garlic 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.190
 Y 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:29.880
 well I prefer to use this bass is 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:32.070
 small garlic we are going to itch we are not going it 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:35.490
 to grind to obviously feel the 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:38.760
 flavors of garlic is part of the is part 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:41.790
 of the recipe and we expect it fresh well 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:44.130
 either we buy them and peeled 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.830
 does not give the feeling of total freshness and 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:51.000
 connection to the product so it's like that 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:57.590
 like I prefer the cool little one and 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.590
 minced well there we took it 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:04.940
 it fits very well to what happens in 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:08.480
 this recipe key in the can consume 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:12.070
 fresh or you can marinate it one day 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.070
 for another is excellent 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:23.799
 well once we have the chopped garlic 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:26.379
 we bring something right here is joining 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:29.170
 the lemon is parsley 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:32.260
 we already have garlic well let's take the 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:36.040
 tomato and tomatoes in the Italian variety 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:39.510
 the common good we find in the 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.510
 house markets 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:48.040
 what we need and should do 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:52.930
 cuts to the long ones and 1 and 2 not the 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:54.610
 exact stretches and cuts the tomato 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:04:00.590
 it also can not be can not be so 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:04:06.240
 green should be at its tender point 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:10.050
 and ready and there is the vinaigrette 

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:13.190
 well to give the spicy point the point 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:17.470
 criollo that point d 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:17.470
 of flavor let's add 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:26.520
 this has been the aromatic lemon 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:31.920
 just you cut of the gilismo will feel 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:36.110
 a special aroma ok we explain it 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:38.830
 without catching his wife many screams 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.830
 with game 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:46.590
 ah 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:49.360
 that's 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:51.950
 Likewise 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:55.280
 pirate 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:55.280
 in sand 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:03.919
 let's do a little cilantro 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:03.919
 fresh sandro 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:08.440
 low 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:25.550
 and the aromas end up invading the 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:30.130
 kitchens 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:32.580
 fly summer ceviche huila cool now 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:35.580

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:37.500
 generous olive oil 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:40.259
 Subgenre gender of life goal is 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:44.520
 Good olive will provide texture 

00:05:40.259 --> 00:05:48.479
 bring flavor to bring good aroma 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:52.289
 by not using pepper for me the 

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:55.560
 amendment is a luxury and massive in flavor already 

00:05:52.289 --> 00:06:00.629
 I have the spicy ajÃ­ limo yes you know 

00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:02.310

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:20.729
 I'm going to try them 

00:06:16.529 --> 00:06:24.590
 well it's almost the proportion of lemon more 

00:06:20.729 --> 00:06:30.310
 or less a bit less of the evolution of 

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:33.100
 of oil and already caught and we proceed to 

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:36.340
 goodness 

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:36.340
 and let's go 

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:41.070
 place about two bounces 

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:44.330
 new 

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:53.280
 a cool rule to accompany some 

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:53.280

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:59.230

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:06.800

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:09.240
 15 minutes you can consume it at the moment 

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:12.150

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:14.910
