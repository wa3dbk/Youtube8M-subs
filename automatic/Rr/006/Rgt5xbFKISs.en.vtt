00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.890
 the eye is for us humans 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.679
 a particularly important sense organ 

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:28.720
 it is almost spherical 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.320
 has a diameter of about 2 point 5 centimeters 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:37.750
 The eyeball lies in the eye socket Aldi with a fatty tissue body 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.770
 is lined 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.059
 only a small part of the eye is visible from the outside 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.020
 this part is protected by eye songs 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.080
 dpa 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.370
 through the link 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.370
 Blow with a liquid-cooled on the eye 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.560
 it comes from tear glands located in the eye socket 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.480
 The fluid contains antibodies that protect the eye from infection 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:10.100
 and through continuous new production one from sponges of 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.150
 debris 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.010
 in the eyes songs are in couples whose roots are very 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.000
 sensitive nerve endings are in contact 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.220
 even the smallest objects solve a touch Bingen song closing time leaks 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.260
 out 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.260
 often a breath of air is enough 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.720
 Six muscles allow the movements of the eye 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.840
 so we plan on Yekta with whom to pursue a track without moving his head 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.470
 the eyeball is bullet-shaped and crude the fore part is slightly behind 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.830
 arched outside 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.280
 The outer shell consists of 3 different fabric layers 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.820
 the dermis is firm and resistant 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:07.350
 In the back of the eye, the dermis is broken by the optic nerve 

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:12.369
 it was the white areas of the eye we can see here 

00:02:12.369 --> 00:02:14.069
 around the dermis 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.879
 the cornea is the extension of the dermis and is located at the 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:19.729
 Front of the eye 

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:23.189
 It is transparent so the light can get in the eye 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:28.260
 the middle tissue layers through the skin and the pigments skin 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.439
 educated 

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:33.369
 The pigment skin prevents a traffic Zion of the incident light 

00:02:34.529 --> 00:02:38.849
 In the front part of the eye, it goes into the so-called c-year body 

00:02:39.369 --> 00:02:42.969
 this was a ring muscle surrounding the deal island 

00:02:44.219 --> 00:02:47.219
 The lens is transparent and malleable 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:55.489
 The CIA muscle is in contact with the lens via ligaments and came as we did 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:58.049
 see later will affect their shape
