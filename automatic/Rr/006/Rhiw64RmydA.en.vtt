very<00:00:52.949> poor<00:00:53.550> and<00:00:54.500> we<00:00:55.500> have<00:00:55.800> found<00:00:56.670> that<00:00:56.850> our

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
very poor and we have found that our

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:05.060 
very poor and we have found that our
cars<00:00:57.600> can<00:00:58.230> work<00:00:58.739> in<00:00:59.250> these

I

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.499 

this<00:01:58.649> idea<00:01:58.950> came<00:01:59.159> in<00:01:59.430> 2010<00:01:59.850> when<00:02:00.060> we<00:02:00.090> released

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
this idea came in 2010 when we released

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.740 
this idea came in 2010 when we released
a<00:02:00.719> must<00:02:01.320> show<00:02:01.770> car<00:02:01.979> in<00:02:02.100> Geneva<00:02:02.490> but<00:02:03.240> that<00:02:03.659> was

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
a must show car in Geneva but that was

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.719 
a must show car in Geneva but that was
just<00:02:03.780> an<00:02:04.049> initial<00:02:04.229> idea<00:02:04.500> from<00:02:05.189> then<00:02:05.369> on<00:02:05.549> it

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
just an initial idea from then on it

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.779 
just an initial idea from then on it
developed<00:02:06.439> in<00:02:07.439> quite<00:02:07.740> a<00:02:07.770> different<00:02:07.860> path<00:02:08.489> but

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
developed in quite a different path but

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.339 
developed in quite a different path but
always<00:02:09.119> listening<00:02:09.629> to<00:02:09.690> what<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:10.019> customer

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
always listening to what the customer

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.500 
always listening to what the customer
wants<00:02:10.619> and<00:02:10.709> means<00:02:10.950> and<00:02:11.700> then<00:02:12.000> we<00:02:12.150> developed

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
wants and means and then we developed

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.509 
wants and means and then we developed
this<00:02:12.569> package<00:02:12.989> the<00:02:13.620> design<00:02:13.950> itself<00:02:14.340> is

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:14.519 
this package the design itself is

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:17.300 
this package the design itself is
actually<00:02:14.730> a<00:02:14.940> carry<00:02:15.269> from<00:02:16.110> the<00:02:16.140> previous<00:02:16.440> and

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
actually a carry from the previous and

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.210 
actually a carry from the previous and
also<00:02:17.849> what<00:02:18.000> was<00:02:18.090> shown<00:02:18.330> in<00:02:18.599> show<00:02:19.019> Karma's<00:02:19.680> the

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
also what was shown in show Karma's the

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.610 
also what was shown in show Karma's the
traits<00:02:20.519> the<00:02:20.730> DNA<00:02:21.120> was<00:02:21.480> in<00:02:21.660> an<00:02:21.840> evolution<00:02:22.500> of

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
traits the DNA was in an evolution of

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.720 
traits the DNA was in an evolution of
that<00:02:22.680> what<00:02:23.670> a<00:02:23.700> clear<00:02:24.120> defining<00:02:24.569> practice

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
that what a clear defining practice

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
the door and off by moving it down you

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.380 
the door and off by moving it down you
free<00:03:10.680> up<00:03:10.799> a<00:03:10.890> lot<00:03:11.010> of<00:03:11.040> space<00:03:11.340> so<00:03:12.000> when<00:03:12.120> you<00:03:12.180> sit

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
free up a lot of space so when you sit

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.259 
free up a lot of space so when you sit
in<00:03:12.420> the<00:03:12.690> car<00:03:12.900> driving<00:03:13.620> it<00:03:13.769> is<00:03:13.920> easy<00:03:14.269> visibility

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
in the car driving it is easy visibility

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:17.100 
in the car driving it is easy visibility
all<00:03:15.540> around<00:03:15.900> is<00:03:16.080> very

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 
all around is very

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.490 
all around is very
while<00:03:17.680> and<00:03:18.270> so<00:03:19.270> this<00:03:19.420> has<00:03:19.540> sounded<00:03:19.930> like<00:03:20.290> a

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
while and so this has sounded like a

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.100 
while and so this has sounded like a
uniquely<00:03:20.830> just<00:03:21.100> what<00:03:21.280> is<00:03:21.430> exterior<00:03:22.000> body<00:03:22.150> what

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.110 
uniquely just what is exterior body what

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:25.850 
uniquely just what is exterior body what
the<00:03:23.230> rear<00:03:23.410> we<00:03:24.400> have<00:03:24.550> a<00:03:24.580> very<00:03:24.820> prominent

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
the rear we have a very prominent
