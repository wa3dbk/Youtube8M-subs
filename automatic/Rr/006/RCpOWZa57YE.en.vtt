00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240
 in trouble 

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:29.189
 10 and key in the main cities of the 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:32.790
 world with an electric technology is a 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:36.510
 race format that will also be a lot 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:39.989
 a new vision is different and spectacular 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:43.440
 motor racing is also a 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:47.910
 very strong message about security 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:50.340
 road and environmental to look for a 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:54.390
 participate in launching a message 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:57.960
 strong than to decrease the number of deaths 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.630
 and wounded in the world that today gives 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.810
 an explosion he absolutely has 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:08.009
 unacceptable when there is no noise 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:13.130
 you can hear what the machine is about 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:16.439
 making the tires the audience who knows 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.960
 there are so many things you earn when 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.359
 if there is a low noise and this machine 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.520
 there is a low noise noise but at the moment 

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:26.009
 there is a noise like a how I spoke 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:30.569
 like a jazz fighter a noise on a 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:37.619
 noise so it closes because the engine 

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:41.009
 va va goes in more from won thousand to pm for 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:43.109
 this is going to be some noise but a lot 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:46.350
 different for what they are in costume 

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:49.560
 the pit stop of different 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.880
 the race will also be very expensive because it is 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.520
 obvious that 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:02:01.060
 economy of an electric car 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:02.799
 and different and interior and this explains 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:07.830
 also because we want to do this 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:11.580
 championship in the cities because for me the 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:16.030
 electric technology and mainly 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:18.890
 for the city and does not allow to do 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:22.670
 see far distances 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:26.330
 long therefore very important of 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.890
 prove it and organize these races 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.140
 in the gi enough to be too difficult 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:34.900
 for a driver to win formula is because 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:37.459
 that the car must be understood 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:40.940
 as something else is not then 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:43.550
 compare it with some other category 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.600
 the tracks but not all new everything 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:48.080
 new 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:51.920
 10 new track the new format 2 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:54.550
 driver and pilot machine 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:58.070
 there is no Friday for this day alone 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:03:00.350
 practies there is not much time is needed 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:03.440
 Citizens get the circuit he has not then 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:05.630
 make mistakes and get the limit right away if 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:08.420
 for this for the pilot for the pilots 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:08.810
 you have to be too good to win 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.890
 to tie 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:15.769
 the comic will be very different fun 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:18.470
 and we also wait because the car 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:20.990
 that you saw today is not the car 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:26.210
 will be definitive 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:29.770
 surprises and I don't see to see the beginning 

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:29.770
 of the championship in 2014
