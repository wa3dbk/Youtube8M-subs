00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
bunch of images if you know what you're

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.580 
bunch of images if you know what you're
doing<00:01:05.070> that<00:01:05.790> whole<00:01:06.000> process<00:01:06.299> may<00:01:06.960> even<00:01:07.229> only

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
doing that whole process may even only

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.950 
doing that whole process may even only
take<00:01:07.799> half<00:01:08.070> an<00:01:08.189> hour<00:01:08.310> so<00:01:09.150> in<00:01:09.299> this<00:01:09.420> first<00:01:09.659> clip

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
take half an hour so in this first clip

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.100 
take half an hour so in this first clip
we're<00:01:10.380> going<00:01:10.409> to<00:01:10.590> look<00:01:10.860> at<00:01:10.979> storage<00:01:11.729> I<00:01:12.150> would

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
we're going to look at storage I would

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.380 
we're going to look at storage I would
suggest<00:01:13.320> you<00:01:13.680> don't<00:01:13.950> keep<00:01:14.310> your<00:01:14.369> photos<00:01:14.820> on

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
suggest you don't keep your photos on

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.640 
suggest you don't keep your photos on
your<00:01:15.990> computer

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
your computer

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.520 
your computer
the<00:01:17.640> fact<00:01:17.880> is<00:01:18.119> it's<00:01:18.750> probably<00:01:18.960> going<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:19.320> fill

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
the fact is it's probably going to fill

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.370 
the fact is it's probably going to fill
up<00:01:19.680> quite<00:01:20.490> quickly<00:01:20.759> and<00:01:21.689> before<00:01:22.080> you<00:01:22.200> know<00:01:22.350> it

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
up quite quickly and before you know it

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.870 
up quite quickly and before you know it
your<00:01:22.590> computer<00:01:23.040> will<00:01:23.130> start<00:01:23.250> slowing<00:01:23.729> down

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
your computer will start slowing down

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.480 
your computer will start slowing down
and<00:01:24.330> bogging<00:01:24.840> out<00:01:24.990> so<00:01:25.560> you<00:01:25.619> need<00:01:25.890> external

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
and bogging out so you need external

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.390 
and bogging out so you need external
hard<00:01:26.970> drives<00:01:27.360> and<00:01:27.810> you<00:01:28.500> need<00:01:28.680> at<00:01:28.890> least<00:01:28.920> two

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
hard drives and you need at least two

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.120 
hard drives and you need at least two
the<00:01:30.270> fact<00:01:30.450> is<00:01:30.689> you<00:01:30.869> need<00:01:31.020> at<00:01:31.200> least<00:01:31.350> one<00:01:31.740> copy

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
the fact is you need at least one copy

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.539 
the fact is you need at least one copy
or<00:01:32.520> backup<00:01:33.210> of<00:01:33.630> all<00:01:33.869> your<00:01:33.930> shots<00:01:34.380> that<00:01:35.369> way

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
or backup of all your shots that way

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.999 
or backup of all your shots that way
when<00:01:35.820> one<00:01:36.030> hard<00:01:36.360> drive<00:01:36.540> dies<00:01:36.930> and<00:01:37.320> believe<00:01:37.799> me

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
when one hard drive dies and believe me

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.670 
when one hard drive dies and believe me
it<00:01:38.549> will<00:01:38.790> die<00:01:39.060> sooner<00:01:39.570> or<00:01:39.689> later<00:01:39.810> all<00:01:40.439> your

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
it will die sooner or later all your

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.260 
it will die sooner or later all your
photos<00:01:40.950> are<00:01:41.340> safe<00:01:41.549> and<00:01:41.700> sound<00:01:41.939> on<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.150> other

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
photos are safe and sound on the other

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.020 
photos are safe and sound on the other
drive<00:01:42.810> so<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.649> question<00:01:44.040> then<00:01:44.250> is<00:01:44.280> what<00:01:44.729> kind

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
drive so the question then is what kind

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.960 
drive so the question then is what kind
of<00:01:45.149> drive<00:01:45.450> do<00:01:45.930> you<00:01:46.049> need<00:01:46.579> now<00:01:47.579> storage

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
of drive do you need now storage

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.499 
of drive do you need now storage
technology<00:01:48.570> changes<00:01:49.110> very<00:01:49.470> fast<00:01:50.210> so<00:01:51.210> if<00:01:51.390> you

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
technology changes very fast so if you

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.219 
technology changes very fast so if you
happen<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:51.840> be<00:01:51.930> watching<00:01:52.140> this<00:01:52.380> clip<00:01:52.740> say<00:01:53.460> in

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.729 
now I tend to use both so I have desktop
drives<00:02:11.819> which<00:02:12.239> stay<00:02:12.510> at<00:02:12.569> home<00:02:12.840> they<00:02:13.349> don't<00:02:13.560> go

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
drives which stay at home they don't go

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:14.190 
drives which stay at home they don't go
anywhere

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
anywhere

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.880 
anywhere
and<00:02:14.650> they<00:02:14.920> have<00:02:15.099> an<00:02:15.220> external<00:02:15.880> power<00:02:16.120> source

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
and they have an external power source

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.680 
and they have an external power source
they<00:02:17.890> tend<00:02:18.160> to<00:02:18.250> be<00:02:18.400> a<00:02:18.580> bit<00:02:18.790> cheaper<00:02:19.270> than

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
they tend to be a bit cheaper than

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.650 
they tend to be a bit cheaper than
portable<00:02:20.260> hard<00:02:20.709> drives<00:02:21.040> and<00:02:21.400> as<00:02:22.150> far<00:02:22.360> as<00:02:22.420> I<00:02:22.599> can

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
portable hard drives and as far as I can

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.750 
portable hard drives and as far as I can
tell<00:02:23.020> the<00:02:23.200> performance<00:02:23.770> is<00:02:23.980> pretty<00:02:24.310> much<00:02:24.550> the

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
tell the performance is pretty much the

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.839 
tell the performance is pretty much the
same<00:02:25.110> so<00:02:26.110> here<00:02:26.349> I'd<00:02:26.530> say<00:02:26.800> if<00:02:27.040> you<00:02:27.370> travel<00:02:27.790> a<00:02:27.819> lot

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:27.849 
same so here I'd say if you travel a lot

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:30.420 
same so here I'd say if you travel a lot
if<00:02:28.239> you<00:02:28.360> move<00:02:28.569> around<00:02:28.980> perhaps<00:02:29.980> go<00:02:30.250> for

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
if you move around perhaps go for

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.180 
if you move around perhaps go for
portable<00:02:30.940> drives<00:02:31.270> if<00:02:32.200> you<00:02:32.650> in<00:02:32.800> you<00:02:32.890> ready<00:02:33.040> go

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
portable drives if you in you ready go

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.490 
portable drives if you in you ready go
away<00:02:33.400> on<00:02:33.520> holiday<00:02:33.840> maybe<00:02:34.840> you<00:02:35.140> want<00:02:35.319> to<00:02:35.380> think

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
away on holiday maybe you want to think

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.090 
away on holiday maybe you want to think
about<00:02:35.800> desktop<00:02:36.250> drives<00:02:37.170> next<00:02:38.170> thing<00:02:38.319> is<00:02:38.470> make

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
about desktop drives next thing is make

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.180 
about desktop drives next thing is make
sure<00:02:39.130> that<00:02:39.430> drives<00:02:40.060> you<00:02:40.300> buy<00:02:40.540> a<00:02:41.010> suitable<00:02:42.010> for

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
sure that drives you buy a suitable for

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.320 
sure that drives you buy a suitable for
both<00:02:42.370> Mac<00:02:42.940> and<00:02:43.140> PC<00:02:44.430> now<00:02:45.430> even<00:02:45.819> if<00:02:45.910> you<00:02:46.030> only

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
both Mac and PC now even if you only

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.050 
both Mac and PC now even if you only
ever<00:02:46.480> use<00:02:46.840> PC<00:02:47.380> or<00:02:47.650> only<00:02:47.830> ever<00:02:48.040> use<00:02:48.220> Mac<00:02:48.519> it's

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
ever use PC or only ever use Mac it's

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.840 
ever use PC or only ever use Mac it's
good<00:02:49.360> to<00:02:49.510> have<00:02:49.720> the<00:02:49.930> option<00:02:50.230> of<00:02:50.290> both<00:02:50.790> next<00:02:51.790> we

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
good to have the option of both next we

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.470 
good to have the option of both next we
want<00:02:51.970> to<00:02:52.060> think<00:02:52.209> about<00:02:52.330> the<00:02:53.459> input-output

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
want to think about the input-output

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.050 
want to think about the input-output
technology<00:02:55.799> so<00:02:56.799> this<00:02:57.100> basically<00:02:57.670> means<00:02:57.880> the

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
technology so this basically means the

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.750 
technology so this basically means the
kind<00:02:58.239> of<00:02:58.420> plug<00:02:58.780> that<00:02:59.470> connects<00:03:00.310> your<00:03:00.489> hard

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
kind of plug that connects your hard

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.270 
kind of plug that connects your hard
drive<00:03:01.030> with<00:03:01.239> your<00:03:01.360> computer<00:03:01.980> but<00:03:02.980> it<00:03:03.100> also

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
drive with your computer but it also

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.759 
drive with your computer but it also
affects<00:03:03.700> the<00:03:03.850> speed<00:03:04.360> that<00:03:04.959> the<00:03:05.110> information

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:05.769 
affects the speed that the information

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:09.180 
affects the speed that the information
takes<00:03:06.130> to<00:03:06.340> travel<00:03:06.610> between<00:03:07.000> the<00:03:07.510> two<00:03:07.920> now<00:03:08.920> at

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
takes to travel between the two now at

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:10.740 
takes to travel between the two now at
the<00:03:09.340> moment<00:03:09.610> most<00:03:10.090> of<00:03:10.180> the<00:03:10.269> drives<00:03:10.540> you'll

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
the moment most of the drives you'll

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.430 
the moment most of the drives you'll
find<00:03:10.989> a<00:03:11.110> USB<00:03:11.709> drives<00:03:12.220> and<00:03:12.690> it<00:03:13.690> seems<00:03:14.080> for<00:03:14.410> the

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
find a USB drives and it seems for the

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:15.449 
find a USB drives and it seems for the
next<00:03:14.739> few<00:03:14.920> years

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
next few years

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:18.530 
next few years
USB<00:03:16.090> is<00:03:16.420> a<00:03:16.450> pretty<00:03:16.840> good<00:03:17.019> bet<00:03:17.260> I<00:03:17.620> would<00:03:18.190> avoid

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
USB is a pretty good bet I would avoid

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.199 
USB is a pretty good bet I would avoid
firewire<00:03:19.540> drives<00:03:20.079> I<00:03:20.700> say<00:03:21.700> that<00:03:21.880> because<00:03:22.030> I've

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
firewire drives I say that because I've

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:24.180 
firewire drives I say that because I've
just<00:03:22.239> bought<00:03:22.600> a<00:03:22.630> new<00:03:22.750> Mac<00:03:23.140> and<00:03:23.859> my<00:03:24.040> new

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
just bought a new Mac and my new

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.120 
just bought a new Mac and my new
computer<00:03:24.630> doesn't<00:03:25.630> have<00:03:25.930> an<00:03:26.230> input<00:03:26.739> for

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
computer doesn't have an input for

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.759 
computer doesn't have an input for
firewire<00:03:27.670> so<00:03:28.420> firewire<00:03:28.930> is<00:03:29.200> essentially

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769 
firewire so firewire is essentially

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:33.390 
firewire so firewire is essentially
defunct<00:03:30.370> technology<00:03:31.470> now<00:03:32.470> in<00:03:32.650> its<00:03:32.799> place

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
defunct technology now in its place

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.300 
defunct technology now in its place
Thunderbolt<00:03:34.180> has<00:03:34.750> come<00:03:34.989> along<00:03:35.260> now<00:03:36.010> I<00:03:36.040> haven't

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
Thunderbolt has come along now I haven't

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.370 
Thunderbolt has come along now I haven't
really<00:03:36.579> used<00:03:36.609> this<00:03:36.970> yet<00:03:37.209> but<00:03:37.630> it<00:03:37.900> looks<00:03:38.200> like

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
really used this yet but it looks like

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.470 
really used this yet but it looks like
it's<00:03:38.590> the<00:03:38.739> new<00:03:38.980> big<00:03:39.280> thing<00:03:39.310> but<00:03:40.150> if<00:03:40.239> your

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
it's the new big thing but if your

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.900 
it's the new big thing but if your
computer<00:03:40.959> doesn't<00:03:41.290> accept<00:03:41.859> Thunderbolt<00:03:42.370> then

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
computer doesn't accept Thunderbolt then

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.970 
computer doesn't accept Thunderbolt then
obviously<00:03:43.120> wait<00:03:44.049> until<00:03:44.470> you<00:03:44.560> buy<00:03:44.739> a<00:03:44.769> new

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
obviously wait until you buy a new

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:46.890 
obviously wait until you buy a new
computer<00:03:45.160> that<00:03:45.459> does<00:03:45.820> before<00:03:46.299> you<00:03:46.359> invest<00:03:46.720> in

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
computer that does before you invest in

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.530 
computer that does before you invest in
that<00:03:46.930> kind<00:03:47.320> of<00:03:47.440> Drive<00:03:48.150> finally<00:03:49.150> let's<00:03:49.359> think

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
that kind of Drive finally let's think

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.690 
that kind of Drive finally let's think
about<00:03:49.720> the<00:03:49.959> size<00:03:50.290> of<00:03:50.530> the<00:03:50.620> drive<00:03:50.920> now

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
about the size of the drive now

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.060 
about the size of the drive now
obviously<00:03:52.269> want<00:03:52.480> the<00:03:52.540> biggest<00:03:52.989> drive<00:03:53.769> that

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.070 
obviously want the biggest drive that

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:56.220 
obviously want the biggest drive that
you<00:03:54.220> can<00:03:54.400> afford<00:03:54.730> but<00:03:55.630> it<00:03:55.720> also<00:03:55.930> we're

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
you can afford but it also we're

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.199 
you can afford but it also we're
thinking<00:03:56.530> about<00:03:56.620> value<00:03:57.100> for<00:03:57.310> money<00:03:57.519> at<00:03:58.060> the

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:58.209 
thinking about value for money at the

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:01.710 
thinking about value for money at the
moment<00:03:58.569> two<00:03:58.930> and<00:03:59.290> three<00:03:59.799> terabyte<00:04:00.579> drives<00:04:01.329> a

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.720 
moment two and three terabyte drives a

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.020 
moment two and three terabyte drives a
pretty<00:04:02.109> good<00:04:02.350> value<00:04:02.560> and<00:04:02.950> if<00:04:03.489> you're<00:04:03.760> an

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
pretty good value and if you're an

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.660 
pretty good value and if you're an
amateur<00:04:04.299> photographer<00:04:05.170> I<00:04:05.470> would<00:04:06.010> take<00:04:06.220> three

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:06.670 
amateur photographer I would take three

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:09.780 
amateur photographer I would take three
terabyte<00:04:07.180> drives<00:04:07.540> will<00:04:08.380> blast<00:04:09.130> you<00:04:09.400> pretty

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
terabyte drives will blast you pretty

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:11.900 
terabyte drives will blast you pretty
well<00:04:10.030> at<00:04:10.569> least<00:04:10.780> for<00:04:11.049> a<00:04:11.079> few<00:04:11.109> years<00:04:11.560> now

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
well at least for a few years now

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.120 
well at least for a few years now
finally<00:04:12.910> I<00:04:13.120> can't<00:04:13.569> stress<00:04:13.810> this<00:04:13.959> enough<00:04:14.130> you
