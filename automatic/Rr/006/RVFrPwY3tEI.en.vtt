like<00:06:27.440> the<00:06:28.430> challenge<00:06:29.210> top<00:06:29.600> and<00:06:29.870> this<00:06:30.200> is<00:06:30.380> you

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:30.500 
like the challenge top and this is you

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:32.490 
like the challenge top and this is you
kick<00:06:30.650> off<00:06:30.800> I<00:06:31.010> mean<00:06:31.430> if<00:06:31.490> they<00:06:31.580> got<00:06:31.730> two<00:06:31.850> played

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:32.500 
kick off I mean if they got two played

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:36.550 
kick off I mean if they got two played
together<00:06:33.500> in<00:06:34.090> several<00:06:35.090> matches<00:06:35.330> then<00:06:35.750> I<00:06:36.080> think

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:36.560 
together in several matches then I think

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.440 
together in several matches then I think
it<00:06:37.220> would<00:06:37.400> be<00:06:37.520> safe<00:06:37.670> to<00:06:37.730> say<00:06:38.030> that<00:06:38.060> will<00:06:38.300> be<00:06:38.420> a

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:38.450 
it would be safe to say that will be a

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:39.760 
it would be safe to say that will be a
very<00:06:38.540> strong<00:06:39.110> contender<00:06:39.560> in<00:06:39.650> these

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:39.770 
very strong contender in these

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:41.770 
very strong contender in these
tournaments<00:06:39.950> your<00:06:40.640> nap<00:06:40.880> while<00:06:41.090> will<00:06:41.480> be<00:06:41.510> one

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:41.780 
tournaments your nap while will be one

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:43.540 
tournaments your nap while will be one
of<00:06:41.870> the<00:06:41.930> teams<00:06:42.200> together<00:06:42.500> with<00:06:42.770> Palestine<00:06:43.280> and

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:43.550 
of the teams together with Palestine and

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:46.240 
of the teams together with Palestine and
several<00:06:43.910> others<00:06:44.240> in<00:06:44.690> there<00:06:45.110> in<00:06:45.410> that<00:06:45.650> in<00:06:46.190> that

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:46.250 
several others in there in that in that

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:49.960 
several others in there in that in that
tournament<00:06:46.780> ahead<00:06:47.780> of<00:06:47.900> us<00:06:48.020> so<00:06:48.200> no<00:06:48.970> description

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:49.970 
tournament ahead of us so no description

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:53.410 
tournament ahead of us so no description
so<00:06:50.510> it<00:06:50.900> does<00:06:51.320> look<00:06:51.620> for<00:06:52.130> us<00:06:52.340> that<00:06:52.910> if<00:06:53.060> we<00:06:53.090> stay

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:53.420 
so it does look for us that if we stay

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:55.600 
so it does look for us that if we stay
together<00:06:53.630> we<00:06:53.960> can<00:06:54.410> be<00:06:54.560> very<00:06:54.770> competitive<00:06:55.250> on
