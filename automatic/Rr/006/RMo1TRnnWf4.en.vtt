00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.350 

yes<00:01:03.570> believe<00:01:04.290> it<00:01:04.350> or<00:01:04.500> not<00:01:04.650> I<00:01:04.710> installed

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
yes believe it or not I installed

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.969 
yes believe it or not I installed
Windows<00:01:06.360> 98<00:01:06.810> on<00:01:07.080> here<00:01:07.409> I<00:01:07.909> just<00:01:08.909> um<00:01:09.500> resized<00:01:10.500> and

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
Windows 98 on here I just um resized and

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.219 
Windows 98 on here I just um resized and
hid<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.340> windows<00:01:11.670> 95<00:01:12.080> partition<00:01:13.080> and<00:01:15.140> so<00:01:16.140> I

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
hid the windows 95 partition and so I

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.560 
hid the windows 95 partition and so I
just<00:01:16.439> put<00:01:16.680> Windows<00:01:17.040> 98<00:01:17.400> on<00:01:17.549> its<00:01:17.700> own<00:01:17.850> partition

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
just put Windows 98 on its own partition

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:29.560 
just put Windows 98 on its own partition
on<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.689> hard<00:01:18.810> drive

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.540

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.740 

now<00:01:58.330> we<00:01:58.390> are<00:01:58.660> dealing<00:01:59.320> with<00:01:59.500> the<00:01:59.800> bare<00:02:00.750> minimum

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
now we are dealing with the bare minimum

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.700 
now we are dealing with the bare minimum
requirements<00:02:02.650> for<00:02:02.710> Windows<00:02:03.130> 98<00:02:03.760> to<00:02:04.030> run

Windows 98 requires at least 16
megabytes<00:02:08.979> of<00:02:09.220> RAM<00:02:09.520> well<00:02:10.240> this<00:02:10.510> computer<00:02:10.900> is

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
megabytes of RAM well this computer is

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:17.510 
megabytes of RAM well this computer is
running<00:02:11.560> exactly<00:02:12.390> 16<00:02:13.390> megabytes<00:02:14.170> ram<00:02:14.940> so

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
running exactly 16 megabytes ram so

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.280 
running exactly 16 megabytes ram so
we're<00:02:18.520> really<00:02:18.760> dealing<00:02:19.090> dealing<00:02:19.780> with<00:02:20.080> the

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
bare minimums here tonight and like I

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.240 
bare minimums here tonight and like I
said<00:02:27.850> this<00:02:28.750> is<00:02:28.870> obviously<00:02:29.410> just<00:02:29.530> temporary

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
said this is obviously just temporary

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:46.710 

let's<00:02:38.230> see<00:02:41.160> 16<00:02:42.160> megabytes<00:02:42.580> of<00:02:42.790> RAM<00:02:45.540> took<00:02:46.540> me<00:02:46.690> a

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
let's see 16 megabytes of RAM took me a

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.840 
let's see 16 megabytes of RAM took me a
while<00:02:46.870> to<00:02:46.930> get<00:02:47.230> the<00:02:47.470> sound<00:02:47.890> drivers<00:02:48.460> to<00:02:48.670> work

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850
