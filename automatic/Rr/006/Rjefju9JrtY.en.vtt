but<00:00:19.010> this<00:00:19.160> is<00:00:19.310> not<00:00:19.490> the<00:00:19.519> 300<00:00:20.210> seat<00:00:20.449> it's<00:00:21.109> just<00:00:21.260> a

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:21.320 
but this is not the 300 seat it's just a

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.589 
but this is not the 300 seat it's just a
plain<00:00:21.560> old<00:00:21.590> 300<00:00:22.340> which<00:00:22.760> means<00:00:23.000> it<00:00:23.150> only<00:00:23.330> has

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:28.450 
the v6 but don't dismiss it quite yet
just<00:00:27.019> because<00:00:27.199> it's<00:00:27.500> missing<00:00:27.650> two<00:00:27.920> cylinders

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:28.460

not only save $11,000 you'll also have a

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.310 
not only save $11,000 you'll also have a

additionally the more compact v6 allows
for<00:00:53.390> a<00:00:53.420> slightly<00:00:53.750> better<00:00:53.990> weight<00:00:54.290> balance<00:00:54.680> of

for a slightly better weight balance of

for a slightly better weight balance of
fifty<00:00:55.430> to<00:00:55.580> forty<00:00:55.910> eight<00:00:56.000> which<00:00:56.840> means<00:00:57.110> that

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:57.290 
fifty to forty eight which means that

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.380 
fifty to forty eight which means that
300<00:00:57.770> has<00:00:57.890> the<00:00:58.010> lighter<00:00:58.250> more<00:00:58.670> direct<00:00:59.000> feel<00:00:59.180> on
