00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
gonna freehand it and make a little

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.260 
gonna freehand it and make a little
circle<00:02:17.900> around<00:02:18.440> the<00:02:18.920> outside<00:02:19.460> of<00:02:19.850> the<00:02:20.030> Hat

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
circle around the outside of the Hat

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.690 
circle around the outside of the Hat
after<00:02:21.110> cutting<00:02:21.290> out<00:02:21.470> the<00:02:21.620> bottom<00:02:22.040> it<00:02:22.430> doesn't

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
after cutting out the bottom it doesn't

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.070 
after cutting out the bottom it doesn't
have<00:02:22.790> to<00:02:22.910> be<00:02:23.030> perfectly<00:02:23.450> round<00:02:23.690> because<00:02:23.930> we're

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
have to be perfectly round because we're

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.840 
have to be perfectly round because we're
actually<00:02:24.140> gonna<00:02:24.500> snip<00:02:24.830> off<00:02:25.010> the<00:02:25.040> back<00:02:25.400> to<00:02:25.670> make

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
actually gonna snip off the back to make

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:27.940 
actually gonna snip off the back to make
it<00:02:26.000> lay<00:02:26.150> flat<00:02:26.450> against<00:02:26.750> the<00:02:26.840> door<00:02:27.260> like<00:02:27.920> that

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
it lay flat against the door like that

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.000 
it lay flat against the door like that
and<00:02:28.310> I<00:02:28.790> just<00:02:29.030> took<00:02:29.240> this<00:02:29.450> round<00:02:29.720> two<00:02:30.110> part<00:02:30.650> and

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
and I just took this round two part and

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.640 
and I just took this round two part and
flipped<00:02:31.370> it<00:02:31.550> so<00:02:32.030> the<00:02:32.180> top<00:02:32.390> is<00:02:32.420> down<00:02:32.840> here<00:02:33.230> drew

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
flipped it so the top is down here drew

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.920 
flipped it so the top is down here drew
a<00:02:33.680> circle<00:02:34.130> around<00:02:34.520> that<00:02:34.850> and<00:02:35.360> I'm<00:02:35.510> gonna<00:02:35.660> cut

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
a circle around that and I'm gonna cut

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.290 
a circle around that and I'm gonna cut
that<00:02:36.110> out<00:02:36.170> and<00:02:36.770> now<00:02:37.310> I'm<00:02:37.580> just<00:02:37.730> gonna<00:02:37.880> glue<00:02:38.210> it

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
that out and now I'm just gonna glue it

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.330 
that out and now I'm just gonna glue it
onto<00:02:38.600> the<00:02:38.900> top<00:02:39.140> so<00:02:39.470> now<00:02:39.500> I'm<00:02:39.740> just<00:02:39.890> gonna<00:02:40.010> take

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
onto the top so now I'm just gonna take

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.120 
onto the top so now I'm just gonna take
the<00:02:40.640> top<00:02:40.850> that's<00:02:41.270> not<00:02:41.570> quite<00:02:41.870> even<00:02:42.080> and<00:02:42.710> trim
