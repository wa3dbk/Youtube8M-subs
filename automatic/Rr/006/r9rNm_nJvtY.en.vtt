00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 yoyo the peaches today little block 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:08.670
 DIY has improvised on this 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:13.049
 wonderful thing was not moving little blog 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.009
 on that, that's how you are 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.150
 have seen him for a few days on 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.270
 twitter i was trying to tweak 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.039
 with this thing is a camera I put no 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.210
 bad photos for teese is a bit and 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.080
 so I mean do a little block of 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.900
 ice cream for you to talk about 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.580
 so this is my new head 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.869
 motorized for homemade camera 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.620
 so in fact what we did is we 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.990
 recovered 1 

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:33.970
 a read so to a box robot 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:37.030
 night in celebration which is so the tech break 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:38.740
 btx 700 sw so yes there are already people 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.810
 who will want to kill me for having 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:43.270
 disassembled this thing because it's very 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:44.710
 big gear but the head was fucked in 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.150
 did there were filters that was 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.890
 fart things that answered finer 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.239
 lt really sucks and so we got it 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.680
 completely disassembled if you want I have 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:53.290
 some pictures at the base it looked like 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.970
 to that and we opened it completely we 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:56.800
 removed everything that was removed 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:59.710
 completely head and let's 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.480
 just the seat and therefore the settings of 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.980
 failures tilt the title panel so it's going 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.660
 to be well the movements like that the 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:09.040
 panning and tilt the movement 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:12.040
 vertical and we managed to fix the f700 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.870
 on it and so we end up with a ba 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.030
 nice little toy that can move a little 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:18.220
 in every way as you see it 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.820
 a dish and so here it works 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.020
 pretty good 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.750
 still have to redo some 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.000
 fixing but basically it's 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.930
 huge 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.130
 so I'm still skating a little bit 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.880
 because I use free software 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:35.200
 who is freestylers x2 and an interface 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:37.630
 usb dmx so there vehlmann vm 116 but I 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.830
 will soon receive a dmx shield for 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.450
 arduino and so I will try to 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.220
 make a small box where I'm going 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.200
 to buy if you want 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.790
 camera positions which I will say 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.290
 flat position that I record 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.970
 position b I record and I say to myself 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.170
 play an animation from one to another to 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.670
 the speed that I want so that I'm going 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.300
 see how the shield works and 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.920
 then the bookstores 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.630
 so I make myself a little homemade case 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.770
 to be able to do that and because it's a 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.910
 robot that at the base is still 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.050
 high-end we will be able to make 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:00.340
 very very slow movements that go 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.050
 serve for example to make time 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.980
 lapse if I put the camera on it and the 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.180
 moves very slowly she makes her 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:06.730
 movement and objects after I accelerate 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:09.789
 all this or movement movements 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:11.620
 fast but all that 360 Â° even 540 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:13.060
 degree if I want I can turn over 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.200
 that a trick is really the trick of 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.209
 dream like miss more than fuck it 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.209
 on a good tracking shot maybe a little 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:20.140
 later we'll see but already there is 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:21.920
 something not bad I want to do 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.599
 quickly make a little demo 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:28.489
 the slowness and the speed of the 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:31.360
 thing yes you go or no we come where you 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:33.800
 go shit he's getting back into risk position 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.010
 so in max speed there I can get to 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.010
 it 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.000
 which is rather not bad it is necessary 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.040
 imagine that with a zoom the movement is going 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.460
 to be much faster and faster 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.470
 minimal so we're really going to have some 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:49.540
 very very slow panning it can be 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.650
 downright terrible there I see that there is 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.910
 a little bit of blows because so 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.170
 its stepper motors what makes 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.520
 that the word that when one is high anymore 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.350
 slow it's a little tac tac technique 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.740
 tac tac it's really going step by step 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.960
 so it's going to have to 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:03.030
 I fix the camera well on it but already 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:05.670
 we have something that works what 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.810
 it's absolutely terrible so for this 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.790
 which is panoramic I said it on 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.430
 can do more than one and a half turn and 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:16.640
 for the tilt so the rotation we will say 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:18.780
 from top to bottom I can do all this 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.570
 so here I can quite look 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.940
 perfectly at all as I can at 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:27.780
 klm asked to look at it completely 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:29.580
 the reverse koala gauvreau so that can me 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.530
 possibly serve if I return the 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:34.640
 robot and that in this case there I look 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:36.780
 like this all the way down there it can 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.270
 imagine things already there it can be 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.770
 plainly too good ah yes other small 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:43.470
 future bonuses 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:45.660
 I put a 5.8 emitter you go so 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.820
 for video with a lipo battery 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:50.400
 all plugged into RCA at the back of the 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:52.440
 camera is here i have my screen and my 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:56.910
 receiver 5.8 jr so this is I have the 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:04:00.030
 back of the camera live kind jean 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:02.100
 revolve to a hello how do you 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.530
 do you call where are you going like this if 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:07.230
 mathieu first here but what did 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:09.960
 fly at 6.9 anyway huh it's 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:11.520
 really son that movement imagined a 

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:14.720
 intro like that the camera that turns and 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.720
 all this terrible 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.420
 and hello to all and welcome to this 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.370
 new episode of science 2.0 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:27.230
 today how to do good 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:28.460
 food they came back good go 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:29.330
 now I think camera I you 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:33.080
 show a little bit the details 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:36.260
 so here's the beast two ready tatin the 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:39.470
 fixations all the broth here the entrance 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:42.440
 mx the power supply so here is the 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:43.790
 robot here programmed on the address number 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.850
 one since from below we have nothing else 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:48.020
 of branch and that's these classes a good 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:50.300
 there is a little bit of a mess you 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:52.880
 see who if I have my emitters 5.8 gerz 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.140
 my lipo battery hayatou who tied 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.760
 for now with elastics but 

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:58.190
 good it holds as we say so much 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:01.040
 walk and so here below we at the 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:02.420
 famous is clear that so I fixed and 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.820
 which is held here by two big 

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:07.010
 diameter 10 mm and there below we have 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:09.200
 two screws one that is 1/4 of push 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:12.830
 nato 3/8 which will therefore well fix the 

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:14.780
 camera on this support and it holds or that 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:16.280
 Frankly good sweets you 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:18.370
 see we put a big collar rings here 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:20.570
 still in case it's loose 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:22.760
 what more can I say at the same time? 

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:27.050
 just too cool but look at that 

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:29.330
 seriously look at me this is terrible 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:31.760
 so there in this software we see nothing of the 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:33.080
 everything i know sorry i have the little 

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:35.840
 graph that is there to place my 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:38.419
 basket my tilt the settings if manual 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:40.790
 who are here so it's not quite 

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:45.680
 what is simplest to java not there 

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:47.480
 have lower lowest no no no no 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:50.690
 no it's not that way I said no no 

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:53.000
 no so on that side you see there 

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:53.390
 big pulleys that's there with in 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.400
 below 

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:57.500
 the famous man stepping motor with 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.550
 so a little backlash cries in 

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:00.020
 below to count the number of laps 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:01.100
 so that he knows where he is 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:04.090
 not exceed the maximum number of laps 

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:06.190
 who can do it alone 

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:07.480
 if we had the party that was leaving on the 

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:09.490
 lamp so we left the capes such 

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:10.720
 what a story of not too much removed from 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:13.180
 circuit that it does not crash the 

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:16.270
 robot anyway and so that's the airlock and 

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:17.550
 the cairo that I fixed on the a6 and 

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:20.020
 here is the beast in action 

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:21.460
 there you see that there is a couple is at 

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:23.620
 to say that there is an axis that is more 

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:27.520
 small than this one so when he goes 

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:28.360
 take a ride it's ok to make 0.02 

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.430
 turn I say bullshit 

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:33.100
 so it allows you to have more strength and 

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:34.360
 a more precise movement makes it the 

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:36.940
 vague and that if we really go there the 

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:40.139
 minimum speed we have something that is 

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:44.050
 already very slow here so there necessarily 

00:06:40.139 --> 00:06:47.229
 even slower is what there is it's 

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:47.650
 crazy is that it holds and I do not 

00:06:47.229 --> 00:06:49.229
 show 

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:52.930
 I'm really trying to force on 

00:06:49.229 --> 00:06:53.979
 seriously i can not do it 

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:54.610
 move what is it really 

00:06:53.979 --> 00:06:56.320
 impressive 

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:58.389
 it's crazy because suddenly it's this 

00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:00.130
 motor there that indirectly turns 

00:06:58.389 --> 00:07:02.500
 a cudgel is really well done 

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:04.449
 like machine or move on here and sees 

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:06.460
 the beautiful little beast that will save the 

00:07:04.449 --> 00:07:07.960
 science now my nonsense thank you 

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:09.910
 to have watched this vlog totally 

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:11.200
 improvised a sorry for the conditions 

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:12.310
 with the microphone the wind all this is a 

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:13.570
 little bit complicated sure I'm going to 

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:16.360
 camera on it so I could not 

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:17.900
 do everything but so a good stuff 

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:19.490
 now 

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:21.139
 I 'll maybe do another video there 

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:22.790
 on it if I make a control box 

00:07:21.139 --> 00:07:24.020
 to ruin it was really because 

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:25.250
 that there are plenty who asked me to 

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:27.710
 do a little blog so here you are 

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:29.419
 have it and here it will be used I think 

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:30.050
 we're going to exploit this thing 

00:07:29.419 --> 00:07:32.180
 promises heavy 

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:43.690
 go and tinker well tinker it greets 

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:43.690
 up is a myth it's cold game
