hairy-chested a manly world of building

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.460 
hairy-chested a manly world of building
our<00:01:14.070> own<00:01:14.509> quadcopter<00:01:15.540> now<00:01:16.049> this<00:01:16.200> doesn't<00:01:16.350> mean

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
our own quadcopter now this doesn't mean

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.410 
our own quadcopter now this doesn't mean
that<00:01:16.560> we've<00:01:16.799> gone<00:01:16.979> off<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.340> vision<00:01:17.640> far<00:01:18.150> from

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
that we've gone off the vision far from

that we've gone off the vision far from
it<00:01:18.540> we<00:01:18.689> love<00:01:18.840> our<00:01:18.960> vision<00:01:19.290> but<00:01:19.890> we<00:01:20.520> thought<00:01:20.759> we

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
it we love our vision but we thought we

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.640 
it we love our vision but we thought we
wanted<00:01:21.090> a<00:01:21.270> bit<00:01:21.390> of<00:01:21.509> a<00:01:21.570> project<00:01:21.810> where<00:01:22.229> Tom<00:01:22.619> and

I<00:01:22.860> could<00:01:23.130> learn<00:01:23.310> some<00:01:23.880> bits<00:01:24.150> and<00:01:24.240> pieces

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
I could learn some bits and pieces

well this might look a little bit
familiar<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.759> anyone<00:01:56.969> who's<00:01:57.240> opened<00:01:57.600> up<00:01:57.689> their

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
familiar to anyone who's opened up their

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.590 
familiar to anyone who's opened up their
vision<00:01:58.229> but<00:01:58.500> obviously<00:01:58.829> this<00:01:58.950> is<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.600> fully

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
vision but obviously this is the fully

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.620 
vision but obviously this is the fully
fleshed<00:02:01.610> version<00:02:02.610> and<00:02:02.790> we'll<00:02:03.000> maybe<00:02:03.180> do<00:02:03.420> a<00:02:03.450> bit

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
fleshed version and we'll maybe do a bit

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.310 
fleshed version and we'll maybe do a bit
more<00:02:03.840> of<00:02:03.899> an<00:02:03.990> unboxing<00:02:04.320> in<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:05.390> in<00:02:06.390> another<00:02:06.840> in

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
more of an unboxing in the in another in

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.529 
more of an unboxing in the in another in
another<00:02:07.409> video<00:02:07.890> but<00:02:08.819> we've<00:02:09.060> got<00:02:09.209> one<00:02:09.360> of<00:02:09.450> those

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
another video but we've got one of those

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.400 
another video but we've got one of those
because<00:02:10.050> we<00:02:10.379> have<00:02:10.530> also<00:02:10.800> gods

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
because we have also gods

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.360 
because we have also gods
one<00:02:14.410> of<00:02:14.560> these

nice little pads with pluses and minuses

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:51.710 
nice little pads with pluses and minuses
on<00:03:49.569> we<00:03:49.750> need<00:03:49.900> to<00:03:50.049> solder<00:03:50.680> things<00:03:51.010> to<00:03:51.489> them

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
on we need to solder things to them

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.180 
on we need to solder things to them
which<00:03:52.720> is<00:03:52.900> why<00:03:53.049> we're<00:03:53.230> going<00:03:53.380> to<00:03:53.470> have<00:03:54.160> a

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
which is why we're going to have a

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:55.410 
which is why we're going to have a
little<00:03:54.310> bit<00:03:54.430> of<00:03:54.549> a<00:03:54.609> practice<00:03:54.970> with<00:03:55.150> our<00:03:55.269> new

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420 
little bit of a practice with our new

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.840 
little bit of a practice with our new
soldering<00:03:55.780> iron<00:03:56.139> and<00:03:56.350> yeah<00:03:57.280> and<00:03:57.549> so<00:03:57.700> we're

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:57.850 
soldering iron and yeah and so we're

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:00.360 
soldering iron and yeah and so we're
gonna<00:03:58.000> we're<00:03:58.209> gonna<00:03:58.269> start<00:03:58.660> off<00:03:58.900> and<00:03:59.709> then<00:04:00.220> as

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
gonna we're gonna start off and then as

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.280 
gonna we're gonna start off and then as
we<00:04:00.549> gradually<00:04:00.940> get<00:04:01.180> raised<00:04:01.569> some<00:04:01.750> radio<00:04:02.019> gear

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
we gradually get raised some radio gear

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:04.220 
we gradually get raised some radio gear
we've<00:04:02.590> save<00:04:02.769> our<00:04:02.889> pennies<00:04:03.220> up<00:04:03.370> for<00:04:03.609> that<00:04:03.730> and

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
we've save our pennies up for that and

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.729 
we've save our pennies up for that and
as<00:04:05.230> we<00:04:05.739> get<00:04:06.069> maybe<00:04:06.900> we<00:04:07.900> might<00:04:08.109> make<00:04:08.290> this<00:04:08.470> one<00:04:08.709> a

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:08.739 
as we get maybe we might make this one a

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:11.759 
as we get maybe we might make this one a
little<00:04:08.889> bit<00:04:09.100> of<00:04:09.190> a<00:04:09.840> a<00:04:10.840> little<00:04:10.930> bit<00:04:11.380> of<00:04:11.470> a<00:04:11.530> sort

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:11.769 
little bit of a a little bit of a sort

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:14.430 
little bit of a a little bit of a sort
of<00:04:11.799> sport<00:04:12.190> flyer<00:04:12.489> so<00:04:12.940> I<00:04:13.480> don't<00:04:14.170> know<00:04:14.260> what

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
of sport flyer so I don't know what

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.560 
of sport flyer so I don't know what
we'll<00:04:14.590> do<00:04:14.829> about<00:04:15.250> putting<00:04:15.760> a<00:04:15.790> camera<00:04:16.060> on<00:04:16.299> it<00:04:16.450> or

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
we'll do about putting a camera on it or

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.779 
we'll do about putting a camera on it or
a<00:04:16.600> gimbal<00:04:17.049> maybe<00:04:17.350> nothing<00:04:17.859> don't<00:04:18.370> know<00:04:18.519> yet

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:18.789 
a gimbal maybe nothing don't know yet

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:20.069 
a gimbal maybe nothing don't know yet
but<00:04:19.150> we're<00:04:19.299> just<00:04:19.479> going<00:04:19.660> to<00:04:19.690> sort<00:04:19.870> of<00:04:19.900> you<00:04:20.049> know

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:20.079 
but we're just going to sort of you know

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:21.300 
but we're just going to sort of you know
as<00:04:20.320> we<00:04:20.500> as<00:04:20.739> we<00:04:20.890> go<00:04:20.919> along

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
as we as we go along

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:23.130 
as we as we go along
they<00:04:21.519> look<00:04:21.669> slow<00:04:21.940> ly<00:04:22.000> go<00:04:22.270> together<00:04:22.659> build<00:04:23.020> this

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:23.140 
they look slow ly go together build this

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:25.950 
they look slow ly go together build this
up<00:04:23.320> so<00:04:24.130> that's<00:04:24.430> what<00:04:24.640> we're<00:04:24.820> going<00:04:24.970> to<00:04:25.090> do

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
up so that's what we're going to do

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.779 
up so that's what we're going to do
over<00:04:26.620> jump<00:04:27.160> over<00:04:27.610> the<00:04:27.729> next<00:04:27.910> term<00:04:28.330> I<00:04:29.789> don't

00:04:30.779 --> 00:04:30.789 
over jump over the next term I don't

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:32.879 
over jump over the next term I don't
know<00:04:30.910> depends<00:04:31.360> fentanyl<00:04:32.139> takes<00:04:32.380> it<00:04:32.620> we<00:04:32.740> are

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:32.889 
know depends fentanyl takes it we are

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:34.710 
know depends fentanyl takes it we are
going<00:04:33.100> to<00:04:33.160> build<00:04:33.460> our<00:04:33.729> own<00:04:33.759> quadcopter<00:04:34.690> and

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:34.720 
going to build our own quadcopter and

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.020 
going to build our own quadcopter and
we're<00:04:34.930> going<00:04:35.050> to<00:04:35.080> do<00:04:35.199> it<00:04:35.289> here<00:04:35.680> on<00:04:36.100> the<00:04:36.850> kitchen

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
we're going to do it here on the kitchen

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:39.600 
we're going to do it here on the kitchen
table<00:04:37.660> so<00:04:38.380> if<00:04:38.620> that's<00:04:38.830> something<00:04:39.039> that's<00:04:39.430> been

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 
table so if that's something that's been

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:41.340 
table so if that's something that's been
interesting<00:04:40.090> you<00:04:40.630> or<00:04:40.900> you've<00:04:40.990> had<00:04:41.110> it<00:04:41.229> in<00:04:41.259> the

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:41.350 
interesting you or you've had it in the

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:42.659 
interesting you or you've had it in the
back<00:04:41.500> of<00:04:41.530> your<00:04:41.740> mind<00:04:41.949> about<00:04:42.100> what's<00:04:42.370> the<00:04:42.520> next

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:42.669 
back of your mind about what's the next

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:44.820 
back of your mind about what's the next
step<00:04:42.970> after<00:04:43.240> the<00:04:43.660> the<00:04:43.990> ready-to-fly<00:04:44.350> ones

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 
step after the the ready-to-fly ones

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.279 
step after the the ready-to-fly ones
then<00:04:45.220> I<00:04:45.250> think<00:04:45.669> you<00:04:46.600> know<00:04:46.750> hopefully<00:04:47.020> this

00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:47.289 
then I think you know hopefully this

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:50.270 
then I think you know hopefully this
would<00:04:47.380> be<00:04:47.470> quite<00:04:47.650> interesting<00:04:48.070> for<00:04:48.820> all<00:04:48.970> of<00:04:49.000> us

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 
would be quite interesting for all of us

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.680 
would be quite interesting for all of us
and<00:04:51.280> we<00:04:51.460> will<00:04:51.610> we'll<00:04:52.000> learn<00:04:52.120> some<00:04:52.389> bits<00:04:52.570> and

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:52.690 
and we will we'll learn some bits and

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:54.810 
and we will we'll learn some bits and
pieces<00:04:52.870> along<00:04:53.110> the<00:04:53.229> way<00:04:53.350> together<00:04:53.710> if<00:04:54.100> anyone

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:54.820 
pieces along the way together if anyone

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:58.950 
pieces along the way together if anyone
has<00:04:55.060> any<00:04:56.160> any<00:04:57.160> suggestions<00:04:57.940> for<00:04:58.180> what<00:04:58.240> gear<00:04:58.720> we

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 
has any any suggestions for what gear we

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.710 
has any any suggestions for what gear we
could<00:04:59.169> put<00:04:59.440> on<00:04:59.560> it<00:04:59.710> then<00:04:59.949> let<00:05:00.370> me<00:05:00.520> know<00:05:00.720> I've

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:01.720 
could put on it then let me know I've

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.439 
could put on it then let me know I've
already<00:05:02.050> got<00:05:02.259> my<00:05:02.560> eye<00:05:03.280> on<00:05:03.639> it<00:05:03.669> on<00:05:03.970> a<00:05:04.030> couple<00:05:04.419> of

00:05:04.439 --> 00:05:04.449 
already got my eye on it on a couple of

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:06.060 
already got my eye on it on a couple of
bits<00:05:04.630> and<00:05:04.780> pieces<00:05:04.960> it's<00:05:05.349> probably<00:05:05.800> going<00:05:05.979> to

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:06.070 
bits and pieces it's probably going to

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:10.020 
bits and pieces it's probably going to
be<00:05:06.570> all<00:05:07.570> almost<00:05:08.199> all<00:05:08.530> DJ<00:05:09.130> eye<00:05:09.160> gear<00:05:09.610> just

be all almost all DJ eye gear just

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:15.890 
be all almost all DJ eye gear just
because<00:05:10.830> I<00:05:12.360> know<00:05:13.360> this<00:05:13.870> stuff<00:05:14.349> a<00:05:14.620> bit<00:05:14.919> my

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:21.160 
there's elements support and you know I

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.339 
there's elements support and you know I
think<00:05:21.910> if<00:05:22.330> you're<00:05:22.479> gonna<00:05:22.599> for<00:05:23.050> me<00:05:23.139> personally

00:05:23.339 --> 00:05:23.349 
think if you're gonna for me personally

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:25.260 
think if you're gonna for me personally
if<00:05:23.650> we<00:05:23.770> go<00:05:23.889> to<00:05:24.039> our<00:05:24.070> first<00:05:24.400> foray<00:05:24.759> into<00:05:24.880> this

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:25.270 
if we go to our first foray into this

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:28.950 
if we go to our first foray into this
kind<00:05:25.599> of<00:05:25.690> building<00:05:25.990> yourself<00:05:26.199> then<00:05:27.190> using<00:05:27.960> all

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:28.960 
kind of building yourself then using all

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.469 
kind of building yourself then using all
the<00:05:29.199> same<00:05:29.410> brand<00:05:30.099> gear<00:05:30.490> it<00:05:30.820> all<00:05:30.970> ties<00:05:31.270> in

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:31.479 
the same brand gear it all ties in

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:33.390 
the same brand gear it all ties in
together<00:05:31.659> it<00:05:32.020> all<00:05:32.139> joins<00:05:32.500> together<00:05:32.740> fairly

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:33.400 
together it all joins together fairly

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.070 
together it all joins together fairly
straightforwardly<00:05:34.180> so<00:05:34.659> what<00:05:34.810> we'll<00:05:34.930> do<00:05:35.050> over

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:35.080 
straightforwardly so what we'll do over

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:36.810 
straightforwardly so what we'll do over
the<00:05:35.380> next<00:05:35.560> couple<00:05:35.889> of<00:05:36.099> videos<00:05:36.159> in<00:05:36.580> this

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:36.820 
the next couple of videos in this

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:38.159 
the next couple of videos in this
particular<00:05:37.180> build<00:05:37.539> your<00:05:37.690> own<00:05:37.720> quad<00:05:37.960> series

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:38.169 
particular build your own quad series

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:39.540 
particular build your own quad series
we'll<00:05:38.409> have<00:05:38.560> a<00:05:38.590> look<00:05:38.740> at<00:05:38.889> what<00:05:39.010> you<00:05:39.130> get<00:05:39.310> when

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:39.550 
we'll have a look at what you get when

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:41.129 
we'll have a look at what you get when
you<00:05:39.639> buy<00:05:39.669> a<00:05:39.880> standalone<00:05:40.479> Naza<00:05:40.810> because

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:41.139 
you buy a standalone Naza because

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:42.330 
you buy a standalone Naza because
there's<00:05:41.349> quite<00:05:41.470> a<00:05:41.560> few<00:05:41.650> bits<00:05:41.919> and<00:05:42.039> pieces<00:05:42.190> in

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:42.340 
there's quite a few bits and pieces in

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:44.339 
there's quite a few bits and pieces in
there<00:05:42.580> bit<00:05:42.880> of<00:05:42.970> wiring<00:05:43.180> to<00:05:43.479> look<00:05:43.630> at<00:05:43.810> we'll

there bit of wiring to look at we'll

00:05:44.349 --> 00:05:46.320 
there bit of wiring to look at we'll
also<00:05:44.500> have<00:05:44.770> a<00:05:44.830> bit<00:05:45.010> of<00:05:45.099> a<00:05:45.220> breakdown<00:05:46.000> of<00:05:46.210> the

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:31.210 
new firmware is performing with it

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:32.370 
new firmware is performing with it
because<00:07:31.300> I<00:07:31.420> haven't<00:07:31.630> yet<00:07:31.810> done<00:07:31.930> the<00:07:32.050> upgrade

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:35.980 
new app I've got the rotor pixel on I

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:37.530 
new app I've got the rotor pixel on I
want<00:07:36.280> to<00:07:36.340> just<00:07:36.520> see<00:07:36.670> if<00:07:36.760> there's<00:07:36.940> been<00:07:37.030> any<00:07:37.120> any
