00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.940
 to mass 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.900

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.000

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:17.239

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:27.560
 I'm going to mark the area 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.970
 and I'm going to apply some black shadow 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:44.360

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:46.810
