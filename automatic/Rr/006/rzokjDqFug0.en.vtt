the<00:03:45.220> no<00:03:45.489> way<00:03:45.670> I<00:03:46.620> wanted<00:03:47.620> to<00:03:47.739> be<00:03:47.920> able<00:03:48.129> to

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
the no way I wanted to be able to

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.750 
the no way I wanted to be able to
exercise<00:03:49.689> the<00:03:49.989> option<00:03:50.470> of<00:03:50.560> putting<00:03:50.799> another

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
exercise the option of putting another

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.869 
exercise the option of putting another
card<00:03:52.510> in<00:03:52.720> there<00:03:52.989> to<00:03:53.680> boost<00:03:53.920> the<00:03:54.099> graphics<00:03:54.549> even

00:03:54.869 --> 00:03:54.879 
card in there to boost the graphics even

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:58.229 
card in there to boost the graphics even
more<00:03:55.120> if<00:03:55.420> I<00:03:55.989> needed<00:03:56.260> to<00:03:56.409> and<00:03:56.890> so<00:03:57.670> I<00:03:57.939> went<00:03:58.120> ahead

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 
more if I needed to and so I went ahead

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:01.020 
more if I needed to and so I went ahead
and<00:03:58.390> put<00:03:58.599> in<00:03:58.629> a<00:03:58.810> 1200<00:03:59.349> watt<00:03:59.470> power<00:03:59.709> supply<00:04:00.030> just

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
and put in a 1200 watt power supply just

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.030 
and put in a 1200 watt power supply just
have<00:04:01.569> a<00:04:01.599> little<00:04:01.840> bit<00:04:02.019> of<00:04:02.049> overkill<00:04:02.379> in<00:04:02.769> case<00:04:02.920> I

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
have a little bit of overkill in case I

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.009 
have a little bit of overkill in case I
wanted<00:04:03.340> to<00:04:03.430> throw<00:04:03.730> anything<00:04:04.000> else<00:04:04.389> in<00:04:04.659> there

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:05.019 
wanted to throw anything else in there

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:08.690 
wanted to throw anything else in there
but<00:04:06.090> didn't<00:04:07.090> go<00:04:07.209> with<00:04:07.389> the<00:04:07.510> mini<00:04:07.690> tower<00:04:07.989> like

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
but didn't go with the mini tower like

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.240 
but didn't go with the mini tower like
solid<00:04:09.700> rib<00:04:09.879> did<00:04:10.150> I<00:04:10.180> went<00:04:10.629> with<00:04:10.780> the<00:04:11.250> full-size

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
solid rib did I went with the full-size

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.360 
solid rib did I went with the full-size
tower<00:04:12.700> and<00:04:13.290> of<00:04:14.290> course<00:04:14.500> it<00:04:14.620> takes<00:04:14.739> them<00:04:15.069> a<00:04:15.099> few

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
tower and of course it takes them a few

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:16.800 
tower and of course it takes them a few
days<00:04:15.400> to<00:04:15.730> build<00:04:15.879> it<00:04:16.090> then<00:04:16.269> another<00:04:16.510> few<00:04:16.780> days

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
days to build it then another few days

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:18.900 
days to build it then another few days
to<00:04:17.139> ship<00:04:17.199> it<00:04:17.590> so<00:04:18.010> it's<00:04:18.190> probably<00:04:18.430> not<00:04:18.579> going<00:04:18.849> to

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
to ship it so it's probably not going to

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.230 
to ship it so it's probably not going to
show<00:04:19.120> up<00:04:19.150> until<00:04:19.539> around<00:04:19.810> the<00:04:20.739> 15th<00:04:21.310> when<00:04:22.120> it

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
show up until around the 15th when it

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.779 
show up until around the 15th when it
does<00:04:22.479> we'll<00:04:23.080> do<00:04:23.260> an<00:04:23.380> unboxing<00:04:23.500> video<00:04:24.130> let<00:04:24.669> you

00:04:24.779 --> 00:04:24.789

does we'll do an unboxing video let you
see<00:04:25.000> it<00:04:25.180> we'll<00:04:25.810> run<00:04:25.990> some<00:04:26.050> once<00:04:26.830> I<00:04:26.949> get<00:04:27.099> it

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
see it we'll run some once I get it

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:28.950 
see it we'll run some once I get it
hooked<00:04:27.310> up<00:04:27.550> we'll<00:04:27.759> run<00:04:27.910> some<00:04:27.940> benchmarks<00:04:28.300> show

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960
