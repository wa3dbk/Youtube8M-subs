the<00:00:43.540> singing<00:00:43.780> quality<00:00:44.199> I<00:01:03.720> think<00:01:04.720> that's<00:01:04.869> one

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:04.989 
the singing quality I think that's one

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:06.029 
the singing quality I think that's one
of<00:01:05.080> the<00:01:05.170> great<00:01:05.560> things<00:01:05.740> about<00:01:05.800> this

00:01:06.029 --> 00:01:06.039 
of the great things about this

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:08.670 
of the great things about this
competition<00:01:06.310> is<00:01:06.610> that<00:01:06.670> it<00:01:07.090> requires<00:01:07.840> two

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680 
competition is that it requires two

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.980 
competition is that it requires two
extremely<00:01:09.430> different<00:01:10.030> skills

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
extremely different skills

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.169 
extremely different skills
if<00:01:11.530> you<00:01:11.770> see<00:01:12.070> someone<00:01:12.310> sing<00:01:12.550> modern<00:01:12.850> music<00:01:13.090> you

00:01:13.169 --> 00:01:13.179 
if you see someone sing modern music you

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:15.029 
if you see someone sing modern music you
don't<00:01:13.390> know<00:01:13.690> if<00:01:13.960> they<00:01:14.080> can<00:01:14.229> sing<00:01:14.380> super<00:01:14.679> and<00:01:14.920> if

00:01:15.029 --> 00:01:15.039 
don't know if they can sing super and if

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:16.560 
don't know if they can sing super and if
you<00:01:15.130> see<00:01:15.310> them<00:01:15.460> sing<00:01:15.640> sugar<00:01:15.880> you<00:01:16.090> don't<00:01:16.300> know

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:16.570 
you see them sing sugar you don't know

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.180 
you see them sing sugar you don't know
if<00:01:16.780> they<00:01:16.899> can<00:01:17.020> see<00:01:17.140> modern<00:01:17.470> music<00:01:17.770> and<00:01:17.860> so<00:01:18.070> it

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:18.190 
if they can see modern music and so it

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:23.070 
if they can see modern music and so it
really<00:01:18.369> does<00:01:18.759> require<00:01:19.560> these<00:01:20.560> very<00:01:21.720> skills<00:01:22.720> I

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:23.080 
really does require these very skills I

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.320 
really does require these very skills I
think<00:01:23.890> it's<00:01:24.009> very<00:01:24.220> useful<00:01:25.020> for<00:01:26.020> people<00:01:26.590> to

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
think it's very useful for people to

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.889 
think it's very useful for people to
overcome<00:01:28.330> fear<00:01:28.720> their<00:01:29.229> fears<00:01:29.649> of<00:01:30.099> modernism

00:01:30.889 --> 00:01:30.899 
overcome fear their fears of modernism

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:33.630 
overcome fear their fears of modernism
and<00:01:31.899> also<00:01:32.259> to<00:01:32.319> simply<00:01:32.679> become<00:01:32.979> aware<00:01:33.310> of<00:01:33.369> what

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
and also to simply become aware of what

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.130 
and also to simply become aware of what
repertoire<00:01:34.149> is<00:01:34.270> out<00:01:34.420> there<00:01:34.660> I<00:01:34.690> think<00:01:34.929> it

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
repertoire is out there I think it

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:36.300 
repertoire is out there I think it
really<00:01:35.410> feels<00:01:35.649> if<00:01:35.800> you're<00:01:35.920> on<00:01:35.979> the<00:01:36.069> cutting

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
really feels if you're on the cutting

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:44.699 
really feels if you're on the cutting
edge<00:01:36.399> of<00:01:36.610> those<00:01:36.880> the<00:01:37.030> newly<00:01:37.300> built<00:01:37.479> on<00:01:43.500> as<00:01:44.500> part
