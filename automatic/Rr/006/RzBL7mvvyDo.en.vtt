frame and you swing parallel to the

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:22.609 
frame and you swing parallel to the
ground<00:00:21.269> and<00:00:21.539> open<00:00:21.869> the<00:00:21.960> shows<00:00:22.140> with<00:00:22.320> your<00:00:22.439> arm

letting the frame behind you and then

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.300 
letting the frame behind you and then
you<00:00:24.570> make<00:00:24.839> your<00:00:25.019> hand<00:00:25.259> catch<00:00:25.529> up<00:00:25.769> to<00:00:26.039> you<00:00:26.130> at

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
you make your hand catch up to you at

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.310 
you make your hand catch up to you at
the<00:00:26.550> end<00:00:26.580> of<00:00:26.699> your<00:00:26.789> swing<00:00:27.080> so<00:00:28.080> it's<00:00:28.230> just

at<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.520> top<00:00:47.760> right<00:00:48.059> there<00:00:48.239> you<00:00:48.329> flick<00:00:48.899> it<00:00:48.930> over

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
at the top right there you flick it over

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.770 
at the top right there you flick it over
that's<00:00:49.769> the<00:00:49.890> key<00:00:50.100> keep<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.820> wrist<00:00:51.030> as<00:00:51.210> L<00:00:51.449> shape

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
that's the key keep the wrist as L shape

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.750 
that's the key keep the wrist as L shape
as<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:51.960> accelerate<00:00:52.710> through<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:52.949> bar<00:00:53.129> forgot

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
as the accelerate through the bar forgot

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.060 
as the accelerate through the bar forgot
about<00:00:54.090> this<00:00:54.359> and<00:00:54.600> that's<00:00:55.410> why<00:00:55.530> my<00:00:55.710> balls<00:00:55.920> been

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
about this and that's why my balls been

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.650 
about this and that's why my balls been
flying<00:00:56.309> out<00:00:56.550> because<00:00:56.879> unless<00:00:57.149> I<00:00:57.329> accelerate

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
flying out because unless I accelerate

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.139 
flying out because unless I accelerate
over<00:00:58.050> top<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.379> ball<00:00:58.769> of<00:00:58.859> my<00:00:58.920> racket<00:00:59.370> I<00:00:59.550> won't

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
over top the ball of my racket I won't

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.849 
over top the ball of my racket I won't
impart<00:01:00.449> to<00:01:00.539> spin<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:00.960> bring<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.199> ball<00:01:01.379> in<00:01:01.410> and

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
impart to spin and bring the ball in and

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.009 
impart to spin and bring the ball in and
that's<00:01:02.100> a<00:01:02.219> swing<00:01:02.429> you<00:01:02.550> want<00:01:02.699> to<00:01:02.789> have<00:01:02.960> on<00:01:03.960> a

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
that's a swing you want to have on a

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.530 
that's a swing you want to have on a
slower<00:01:04.470> court<00:01:04.860> if<00:01:04.980> the<00:01:05.100> swing<00:01:05.400> harder<00:01:06.000> because

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
slower court if the swing harder because

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.300 
slower court if the swing harder because
the<00:01:06.780> more<00:01:06.960> force<00:01:07.290> coming<00:01:07.560> at<00:01:07.770> you<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.010> easier

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
the more force coming at you the easier

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
the more force coming at you the easier
it<00:01:08.370> is<00:01:08.400> to<00:01:08.460> return<00:01:08.790> that's<00:01:09.060> why<00:01:09.180> I<00:01:09.210> on<00:01:09.270> the

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
it is to return that's why I on the

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.940 
it is to return that's why I on the
return<00:01:09.540> of<00:01:09.600> service<00:01:09.840> really<00:01:10.410> easy<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.710> do<00:01:10.800> this

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
return of service really easy to do this

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.100 
return of service really easy to do this
watch<00:01:11.790> how<00:01:12.000> I<00:01:12.030> do<00:01:12.150> this<00:01:12.240> is<00:01:12.390> a<00:01:12.450> pretty<00:01:12.780> big

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
watch how I do this is a pretty big

watch how I do this is a pretty big
serve<00:01:13.500> I<00:01:13.860> come<00:01:14.610> in<00:01:14.820> I<00:01:15.030> make<00:01:15.420> impact<00:01:15.840> in<00:01:15.990> front
