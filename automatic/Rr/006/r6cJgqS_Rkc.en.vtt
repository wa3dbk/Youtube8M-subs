00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:05.730
 how to make a safe dump debris 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.170
 let's go by telling them to forgive 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.760
 for the cookies in the background are 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.980
 insects that can hear that they are 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.920
 chabÃ¡n all the video I talked to them 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.170
 and they tell me that they can not stop 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.490
 talk and then nothing is ticklish in 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.199
 just let's start with the video this 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.270
 what we have here is a garbage dump this 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.070
 automatic what you do you will see that 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.900
 if we put things in this chest this is 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.430
 here although you can hear this 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.990
 ie6 going dispenser thinking what 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.189
 is basically doing what it is 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.140
 making me come on I know this here 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.329
 this that but it is bringing things 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.950
 from this chef and taking her to this 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.780
 dispenser this dispenser the strips 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.940
 automatically since there is a comparator 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.450
 that has a reaction signal every time 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:45.700
 that a signal arrives 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.700
 this one has obviously not in 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:52.670
 the comparator let's shut up this 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:54.260
 stage think the comparator this detects 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.420
 that a tub that has a following 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.390
 rest and this re peter what it does is that 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.720
 it takes it to dry 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:04.059
 as basically the comparator is activated 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.740
 the same elective dispenser itself 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:07.240
 this little one is a dispenser is a 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.070
 shot but that basically instead of 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:12.729
 throw this the reason as activated the 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:15.020
 strip like this as you throw it 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:17.960
 normally well 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.729
 but cristian because you do not use a one 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.310
 as an extra that is very easy to do and 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:25.039
 you need to dine later because that's the way 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.570
 because there's nothing basically wins that 

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:28.219
 wear this in a fancy way of zelaya 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.600
 you do not have to do this and then the only thing 

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:32.149
 what you have to do is throw all 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.209
 in the bag and then he automatically 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:36.380
 little by little to the bottom be 

00:01:34.209 --> 00:01:40.159
 disappearing ok let's do what 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:42.920
 first we need a comparator 2 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:45.200
 you repeat and this several times really not 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.479
 I know I do not know how many are more good this 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.119
 first in the comparators first but 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:55.520
 the buyer of the networks with the 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:02:00.649
 repeater the three cantos of these here 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:02.509
 60 people then I did not put the proper 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:04.340
 looking at this there is because it has 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:06.289
 extending down because remove 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.079
 this here because then if I 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:10.670
 we put the backpack here and we give it to 

00:02:09.079 --> 00:02:12.680
 be looking down and so the 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.930
 things that you know beyond you get off but 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.790
 now what is missing is the lava with the 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.150
 water here we are going to close this hole that 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.150
 is here 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:29.879
 as you can see now when we put 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:34.319
 things here we are going to put this rest then 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:36.000
 is going to deposit and is going to burn now 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:37.200
 what we do is we're here is it 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.780
 there is a team that is with this one 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.810
 quite a knowing we are putting the 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:45.349
 shopper here on top though we go and 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.210
 explains Italian this one we can open the 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:51.200
 proper 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:52.820
 it is explained that also and 77 now 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.410
 we can thing that came in we're going to put 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.860
 this sign of things this is counted 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:59.860
 the half hour this one was going to keep doing 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.860
 infinitely 

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:16.129
