 so today we meet again 

00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:09.760
 a long absence of play against a 

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:13.210
 video actually because I was a little 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:18.340

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:20.289

 ride level 30 to enchant you 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:34.120
 so it's simple we need a 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:37.030
 stock of iron ore since there I 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.500
 I'll do better to make a stack 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:42.219
 of iron ore in your first 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:44.760
 box you put countries usually 

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:46.690
 according to you take ovens before 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.809
 let you cook 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:53.770
 we'll see but it's cooking your own 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:56.789
 to do after you see your touch in 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:59.710

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.210

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.510

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.630
 if you let dominated heat in 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.550
 same time it will not give you more 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.440
 xp is a parent for this purpose 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.909

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:38.740
