 cute blue there is divine divine voice 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.970
 good the pictures that the person brought me 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.439
 of small format as we call ourselves 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:27.660
 small format with this in soles and 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:32.099
 applications you will not be the wood and others 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:35.730
 look how divine I love this one that is 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:38.340
 leaves Aryans and I'm here is this one to go out 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.350
 an east of leaves and we're going to go one 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:44.820
 one so that you see them look at this one 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:47.490
 today we are going to die with this 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.980
 butterfly that there is no sugar I know that 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:53.130
 when it comes out I hope there are after 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:57.480
 of this is live life 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:59.160
 look how cute sweet I love this 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.550
 because to put in a room in a 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.800
 library give a nice composition 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.860
 very well with measures for we have to 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.720
 thanks of course to plan téc plan 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.430
 téc has a very complete range of 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.320
 products for painters the best 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.850
 acrylic and accessory fabrics 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.470
 Extensible varieties and varnishes 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.630
 water novel models on napkins 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.220
 handkerchiefs and sheets to occupy products 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.630
 prestigious as papers and carbon 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.190
 It has been reading style graphs and inks 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.780
 Rotring and paintings to make the sheet 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:25.080
 complete in the artistic line of plan 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.000
 tec 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.210
 there he is today telling him why he is going to 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.830
 ushuaia 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.960
 the luck with and that you go to ushuaia 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:38.030
 for what date more or less than the first 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.030
 of June and teaching 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.930
 good the idea is 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.030
 that we were chatting about that that I 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.190
 I counted that I know Ushuaia and that 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.830
 we have many friends who see us and who 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:54.460
 the truth that is a beauty for photos 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:56.380
 you're going to pump it, I'm not happy 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:59.500
 let's do project such is the 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.810
 project is very simple to see then 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.450
 first so they also see the 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:07.210
 let's say the quality the capacity of 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.860
 coverage that these acrylics have without 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:13.360
 give you a basis for none have been had 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:17.020
 a white base what I did was play 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.580
 with four shades the black in this case 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.980
 the green 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:25.239
 navas and green oil navy blue 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:28.600
 and the bordeaux and give him some touch in 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:32.440
 some area with silver plated 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:34.510
 so brushstrokes if we did not make you a blue one 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.970
 one black did not board clear one green 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.530
 dark and one dark green like this we give a 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.500
 little bit more we are going to give all the 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.030
 table and then look at what you have as a 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.660
 textured 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.720
 yes 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:50.570
 I want to go with this plugger 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.880
 of foam rubber to integrate the silver 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:56.300
 as it vanishes is 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:03:02.780
 just give it a little light in a 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:04.340
 corner to these mini marquitos and let's say 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.190
 with this tamponer what I can is 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:10.970
 create this type of texture no texture 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:13.340
 exact that is not smooth small texture of 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.410
 foam rubber foam rubber once 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:19.250
 this is dry 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:22.910
 What I did was color 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:25.210
 also with him smaller capper 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:29.350
 with the white 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:33.550
 Always remember to discharge the excess 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:37.660
 of color to the mini form or what I 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:39.670
 want to also paste even this for 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:42.700
 example some are acquired others 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:45.820
 they were manufactured with in this case 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:51.070
 material that is a high impact so 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:53.290
 you can do this on the plastic but 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:55.630
 it does not matter or regardless of 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.910
 what material and where do we get it 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:01.210
 even we can do 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:03.250
 landforms using the stencil 

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:06.580
 with noise but I want to get out a little 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:08.530
 of the union and apply something different and 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:10.480
 It goes very well when you apply something 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.830
 that just recently we saw everything that 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.880
 be embellish in some way 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:18.430
 applying clear another dimension 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:21.489
 that would have been my way of seeing 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:25.030
 even better if I had applied 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:26.820
 this not directly supporting but with 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:29.100
 well but 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.990
 for me you are too thin but the 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:33.060
 truth is that I did not count on not being 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:34.890
 it happened to me out there with a clear pin 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:37.290
 but lift a little bit for a little 

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:41.130
 more and more to get away from what 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:44.940
 I win more clearly, this is the one that is 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:49.290
 truth that does not lead to anything of 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:55.440
 technique but look at the idea is that you have 

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:56.460
 a contrast yes with the format this good 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:00.650
 contrast 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:05.100
 there it is and now the other thing is simply 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:07.020
 words that we say write with the 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:09.630
 help from this there are different types of 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:11.190
 forms of letters from three to good 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:13.170
 this saying that they have the studies of 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:16.660
 letters if there are these forms and different 

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:19.510
 inclinations with the same capper 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:22.990
 different graphic typographies correct 

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:25.720
 give correct correct to give you the 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:30.169
 stenciled but not above I give more 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:33.199
 intensity if it's like I want 

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:35.659
 take off the top of the part 

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:39.159
 lower let's put another word that 

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:39.159
 it is no longer 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:43.350
 in the same way 

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:47.990
 Notice that I'm not waiting for 

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:52.300
 it dries 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:52.300
 and directly ages lift 

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:58.920
 because the acrylic dries very fast and 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.670
 notice that the cognitive white is 

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:03.970
 why 

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:07.240
 I'm working on the black charm 

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:13.539
 there is 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:16.710
 well when you see it is short what 

00:06:13.539 --> 00:06:16.710
 we want to see how it goes 

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:28.710
 and to know the exact idea well there is a 

00:06:25.539 --> 00:06:28.710
 brand not the web 

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:39.180
 but the good thing is this I want this because 

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:40.920
 it's like that look at the lyrics and there's a detail 

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:43.530
 who did that we wanted to use the 

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:45.930
 clear whites with this with levels 

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:48.420
 organic this we achieve rotring and the 

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:49.980
 ink speaks now of white ink look 

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:52.080
 the things that are done, what I am 

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:54.270
 doing is 

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:55.750
 re bordering the letter re bordering the 

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:58.000
 letter 

00:06:55.750 --> 00:07:01.409
 that's what they have coming out a little bit 

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.779
 the rigidity a certain exact of the letter 

00:07:01.409 --> 00:07:07.259
 they are squares that if you want to do something 

00:07:03.779 --> 00:07:09.300
 Fast fast and easy to give away 

00:07:07.259 --> 00:07:12.719
 to look good with someone and others with 

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:16.019
 a name with a wooden shape a 

00:07:12.719 --> 00:07:18.929
 everything is very good and you give it the 

00:07:16.019 --> 00:07:21.779
 base a little more texture 16 there you go to 

00:07:18.929 --> 00:07:25.529
 play you and then weights with dots 

00:07:21.779 --> 00:07:29.069
 with stripes some words so there is a 

00:07:25.529 --> 00:07:31.319
 sheetlet a flower if there is a florcita one 

00:07:29.069 --> 00:07:33.869
 choir you could make a little heart do 

00:07:31.319 --> 00:07:36.300
 one corazoncito do a little heart if 

00:07:33.869 --> 00:07:39.199
 someone wants it puts me on facebook my 

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:39.199
 dog is called cloud 

00:07:40.909 --> 00:07:43.909
 Thank you
