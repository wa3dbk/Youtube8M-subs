00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:09.330
 hello today we will bake pies with 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:11.460
 potatoes first need to do 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:16.379
 stuffing for this we need 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.970
 potatoes onions salt and black 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:37.770
 pepper 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:41.149
 I clean the potatoes I clean the onions Potatoes I cook onions 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.149
 fry in vegetable oil 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.540
 after the potatoes have boiled onions 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.190
 roasted must be done 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.110
 mashed potatoes to be 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.780
 act as a filling for our 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.590
 mashed pies of course better to do on 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.440
 milk 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:05.479
 but I don't have milk now a river behind it 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.729
 shop honestly lazy i will 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:16.850
 use the water which was brewed 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:24.399
 add some salt add potatoes 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:30.320
 pepper and do the most ordinary 

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:45.590
 mashed potatoes in principle can be immediately 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:48.110
 add the onions and filling for pies 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.720
 ready but it must be cooled with us 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:53.030
 on the street now plus 5 degrees so 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.939
 I'll leave mashed potatoes for a while on 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.590
 the balcony until the filling cools down let's 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:58.310
 let's prepare the dough for 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.640
 pies 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:03.760
 for the dough we need 3 cups of flour 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:06.680
 1 cup warm water or warm milk 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.970
 50 grams of cooking oil instead 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.970
 vegetable oil can use 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:15.880
 cream or margarine three teaspoons 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:17.780
 sugar 1 tsp salt and 8 grams 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.269
 high speed dry yeast 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:25.090
 you can knead the dough with your hands, but I 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:25.090
 I will use the bread machine to pour water 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:35.650
 add vegetable oil then 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.650
 add flour 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:51.950
 one spoon of salt 3 tablespoons of sugar 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.550
 pour out the yeast 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:09.440
 I launch the bread machine and after 10 15 minutes 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.440
 I will have ready dough 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:24.170
 as soon as the dough is well mixed 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:33.240
 you can begin to use 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:33.990
 I put the dough into 4 equal parts after 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:37.890
 this me 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:42.210
 roll out each of the parts put inside 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:51.110
 stuffing and it will be possible the whole thing 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:55.680
 bake telling all very simple 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:58.760
 most ordinary rolling pin like this 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.760
 about the way 

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:12.019
 take the stuffing 

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:15.920
 spread on the far edge 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:25.250
 thereafter 

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:25.250
 spin the roll 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:41.830
 after the videos are ready it 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:44.000
 need to split this is done 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:46.820
 back of the hand 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:53.120
 more precisely rib probably yes back 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:57.050
 the side is rib here edge of palm 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:05:00.910
 right in the middle of this roll do 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:08.210
 such cutting movements and it turns out 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:11.890
 small patties are made 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:11.890
 like this 

00:05:19.809 --> 00:05:25.489
 I put it on a baking tray 

00:05:22.309 --> 00:05:30.669
 parchment paper spread on it 

00:05:25.489 --> 00:05:30.669
 pies grease them with beaten egg 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:50.560
 I warm up the oven for about 10 minutes 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:55.990
 maximum then I set at 190 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:06:01.450
 degrees govern it 

00:05:55.990 --> 00:06:03.820
 patties total baking time 30 minutes 

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:06.370
 but since my oven bakes 

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:11.500
 unevenly after 15 minutes I need 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:13.660
 will flip against 15 minutes have passed 

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:14.830
 now you need to open the oven and 

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:17.350
 turn the pan 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:19.240
 Naturally I will use mitts 

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:40.030
 because the temperature inside is enough 

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:42.880
 high past another 15 minutes pasty 

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:54.520
 should be ready let's see what 

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:56.950
 we got such we 

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:57.960
 turned out pies let's one of them 

00:06:56.950 --> 00:07:01.290
 cut 

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:01.290
 let's see what's inside 

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:13.710
 Here is the stuffing cakes and because 

00:07:11.219 --> 00:07:15.840
 I have done this many times already 

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:18.689
 simple result is always obtained 

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:20.430
 great so try and you on 

00:07:18.689 --> 00:07:23.120
 today, like everyone, subscribe
