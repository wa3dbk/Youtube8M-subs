00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.730
 good friends in this second part 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:07.980
 We'll see how to run in Linux and 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.530
 after having prepared our usb 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.440
 with the necessary files this 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:18.190
 first thing we should do is connect 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:22.540
 usb to the usb port of the xbox and restart 

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:24.400
 the console pushing the button she does not 

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:26.650
 we understand it from the power button if not 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.850
 we descend from the button she ok to 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:32.020
 that enter 

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:36.050
 so that it enters the rye 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:38.420
 then now let's run then 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.380
 the excel from where 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.930
 we will see look what 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:47.079
 I just turned on the teacher with the ex 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:51.790
 and that is tearing out the brain of 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:54.180
 we wait for it to detect the usb memory 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:58.170
 I'm going to shake you a little bit like 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.170
 television so you can see it 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:06.000
 We waited a while for that clock to 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:07.990
 and that and we see things 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.060
 loading 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:14.030
 already found in linux 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:17.649
 or the world look how the 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.649
 our world and our xbox 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.210
 and we see how it is starting 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:38.280
 we have to wait a while 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.280
 to the position in linux 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:41.770
 and we can only wait 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:02.560
 it will always take a few minutes 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.560
 here 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.850
 and we'll have to wait for him to start 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.290
 and we see how he is recognizing the 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:47.670
 memory and files 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:52.560
 is loading it to the xbox 360 to be able 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:55.280
 start linux on our xbox 360 with the 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.280
 wide axis 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.480
 this process as I tell you that a little 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.090
 delayed 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:12.020
 since some consoles charge a little 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:15.350
 faster at least the slim 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:18.410
 they throw the clock much faster 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:22.720
 because they have a processor a little more 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:26.950
 fast but like all they load 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:29.140
 Linux already is already prepared by the 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.750
 equipment lips hay 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:34.620
 to boot in linux in our 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.620
 export 3s 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:59.750
 we see how the end of the 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.750
 boot of linux 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:16.500
 well there we see that it is already entering 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:20.670
 what is linux in our xbox 360 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:22.890
 there they have we can appreciate now 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:24.930
 only after you load linux what 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:28.470
 we must connect a mouse and a 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:31.990
 usb keyboard with which we can enter 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:33.970
 to the internet we can watch movies 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.890
 another thing that I'm going to tell you do not have 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:38.140
 scared when they see the xbox with these 

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:40.169
 lights since this is normal in the 

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:42.240
 boot of linux 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:45.620
 at the moment I do not have keyboard or mouse 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.620
 to prove it was operated 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:52.889
 will come out this way here I will bring you 

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:54.660
 here we have the eyes start eyelashes 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:56.280
 some clarification never go to 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:58.860
 install or that there is something here coming out 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:01.080
 install never install it because 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:06.000
 would install the operating system in the 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:08.159
 fbi would be unusable for 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.710
 ok console good friends then this 

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:13.650
 tutorial this I hope it's a lot
