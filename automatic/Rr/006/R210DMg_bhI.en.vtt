00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:05.730
 confront them barbaso are we going 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.620
 to be world champion and champion of the 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.940
 world it's going to be handled it's going to be 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.349
 complicated it's so banal what 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.630
 I mean, but what can I tell you 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.009
 is that you have to be well 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.480
 still have some basics I'll tell you 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.190
 say about what you did 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.470
 in recent years and on the various 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.720
 last years you see that you have 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.789
 five six big six nations that are 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.750
 in front of you then Bernard tells us yes he 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.640
 there are no big margins 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.050
 there is no big margin but hey those 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.849
 five six nations and some moment the 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.130
 bring his price the English are 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.510
 currently better than us I think 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.239
 the new zealand say we 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.250
 South Africa probably 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:41.370
 australia that that can it can be 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:44.129
 better so so huge the concern of the 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.550
 common concern we've never had before 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.039
 world Cup 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:50.760
 are waiting to see the next tournament if 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:53.550
 if ever this next tournament revealed a 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.410
 team that is built kiki real who 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.660
 reveals some incredible players who 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.239
 that flourish at certain positions 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.469
 I do not know but miracles and 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.250
 miracles it's complicated what is it 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.040
 a lot of work 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.790
 a miracle is like talent without 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.220
 elbow grease 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.950
 there are none and so I'm still 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:14.340
 very not pessimistic but I tell myself it's 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.140
 his easy paw what's going on not easy 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.090
 I learned afterwards as I say to you as 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.799
 everything is flat, that is to say 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.049
 all teams train three 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.670
 month everyone is at the same level on 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.229
 never know what he told me it's 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.330
 another competition 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.710
 now if you tell me today you 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.310
 put a ticket on France to be 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.920
 World Champion 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.479
 even the coast will first be huge and 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.579
 but I will not put like a dandy 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.659
 andy match match since it remains ten 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.579
 matches by counting the matches of 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.470
 preparation plus the big preparation 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.060
 you emphasized it precisely vincent he 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.759
 can still happen a lot 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.110
 so bernard is what we're going 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.130
 to be world champion but are we 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.060
 put a little bit of the world if it's difficult 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.409
 to say yes or no 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.640
 in the current state of things the 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.290
 person who will say yes it is sure that at 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.600
 20th goal of the world knows the potential 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.470
 to be me, I'm convinced that 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.930
 do not be the ones today 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.939
 one year from the date of departure 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.480
 I am also convinced but what is 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.510
 the 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:05.440
 new zealand south africa 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:06.610
 australia they spoke well dirty 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.860
 England in which I do not believe 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.170
 at all but what these teams up there 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.220
 the margin needed to make us say 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:12.850
 to us we are sure that will not be 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.590
 world champion 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.790
 so here I say no to england you 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.790
 do not believe it, I do not believe it because 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.500
 for what is going to be a problem for them 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.060
 andes and the opening half post on 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.500
 August 10 whenever it takes 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.090
 must play well it passes a little 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.440
 Caennais who offered themselves then point 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.180
 of questioning about the young Ford I 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.530
 do not know so everyone tells me 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.270
 the greatest good to start with 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.380
 johnny necessarily I do not know 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.280
 he's not playing at one year of the world cup 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:39.910
 of him too will have to 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:40.770
 that they which especially concerns to 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.000
 opening half post 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:45.130
 but no, not against actually 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.870
 these four nations have these three 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.730
 nations I take off England seems to me 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.410
 and the Welsh too seems to me at the top 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.690
 of us but in addition a margin 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.160
 necessary to say yes we are sure 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.690
 of a 20th dany boon because these four 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.210
 there are better than us then there 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.280
 I say no is what is no margin 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:02.290
 with blacks and African south and 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.700
 starts but it is felt the tents 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.540
 but start or high schools like in 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.520
 all teams 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.170
 what fabric is world champion had 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.670
 the 4th opener anyway in 2011 he 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.330
 must say things as they are you 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.760
 see what I mean 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:14.080
 so losing the final he knew that if 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.400
 fart crush that if losses and this is 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.410
 that if fart szabo de vinÃ§a 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.150
 complicate and then it happened it's 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.620
 arrived so that can happen to a team 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.330
 what did you have that two guitars 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.010
 of opener and catane already bad enough 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.450
 it is miraculous some of his 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.040
 champions and if you can both but 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.660
 you become a mundane team again and that's 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.160
 what makes uruguay unique 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.320
 but compared to football etc 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:35.430
 and that's why I say no no 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.430
 no margin is necessary no
