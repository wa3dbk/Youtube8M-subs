was ripping it up which if you if you

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.110 
was ripping it up which if you if you
have<00:02:14.970> a<00:02:15.030> dog<00:02:15.299> and<00:02:15.540> you<00:02:16.519> ever<00:02:17.519> bought<00:02:17.820> one<00:02:18.090> of

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
have a dog and you ever bought one of

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.880 
have a dog and you ever bought one of
these<00:02:18.329> they're<00:02:18.870> pretty<00:02:19.049> tough<00:02:19.380> even<00:02:19.680> the

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
these they're pretty tough even the

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.080 
these they're pretty tough even the
puppy<00:02:20.160> ones<00:02:20.340> are<00:02:20.549> rarely<00:02:22.459> indestructible<00:02:23.459> but

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
puppy ones are rarely indestructible but

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.930 
puppy ones are rarely indestructible but
uh<00:02:24.620> there<00:02:25.620> the<00:02:26.040> puppy<00:02:26.340> Kong's<00:02:26.549> are<00:02:26.760> a<00:02:26.790> little

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
uh there the puppy Kong's are a little

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.800 
uh there the puppy Kong's are a little
softer<00:02:27.510> for<00:02:27.750> the<00:02:27.900> puppy<00:02:28.860> teeth<00:02:29.130> and<00:02:29.820> you<00:02:30.690> have

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
softer for the puppy teeth and you have

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.039 
softer for the puppy teeth and you have
to<00:02:30.959> upgrade<00:02:31.260> them<00:02:31.620> to<00:02:32.040> one<00:02:32.190> of<00:02:32.310> these<00:02:33.019> so<00:02:34.019> they

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:34.049 
to upgrade them to one of these so they

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:35.960 
to upgrade them to one of these so they
don't<00:02:34.320> rip<00:02:34.769> it<00:02:34.950> to<00:02:34.980> shreds<00:02:35.070> there's<00:02:35.579> one<00:02:35.820> more

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
don't rip it to shreds there's one more

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.610 
don't rip it to shreds there's one more
above<00:02:36.269> this<00:02:36.450> it's<00:02:36.690> even<00:02:36.959> harder<00:02:37.290> it's<00:02:37.440> the

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
above this it's even harder it's the

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.930 
above this it's even harder it's the
extreme<00:02:38.130> Kong<00:02:38.459> it's<00:02:38.760> black<00:02:39.299> and<00:02:40.400> I<00:02:41.400> guess<00:02:41.760> it's

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
extreme Kong it's black and I guess it's

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.940 
extreme Kong it's black and I guess it's
for<00:02:42.120> like<00:02:42.299> bigger<00:02:42.540> dogs<00:02:42.840> like<00:02:43.109> Labradors<00:02:43.769> and

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
for like bigger dogs like Labradors and

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.229 
for like bigger dogs like Labradors and
I<00:02:45.019> think<00:02:46.019> he'll<00:02:46.590> need<00:02:46.769> it<00:02:46.980> but<00:02:47.250> I<00:02:47.519> guess<00:02:48.060> we'll

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
I think he'll need it but I guess we'll

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.090 
I think he'll need it but I guess we'll
see<00:02:48.540> if<00:02:48.660> he<00:02:48.780> tears<00:02:48.989> this<00:02:49.140> one<00:02:49.380> up<00:02:49.500> I<00:02:49.709> don't

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
see if he tears this one up I don't

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.150 
see if he tears this one up I don't
think<00:02:50.130> so<00:02:50.459> cuz<00:02:50.670> it's<00:02:50.820> pretty<00:02:51.030> hard<00:02:52.160> still

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
think so cuz it's pretty hard still

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.580 
think so cuz it's pretty hard still
chewy<00:02:53.430> but<00:02:54.980> not<00:02:55.980> not<00:02:56.340> enough<00:02:56.970> to<00:02:57.290> let<00:02:58.290> him<00:02:58.380> rip

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
chewy but not not enough to let him rip

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.590 
chewy but not not enough to let him rip
it

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.610
