 which represents a great deal of 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.289

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.830

 that use windows phone and android 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.810
 this resource is pointed out as responsible 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.360
 the drop in thefts 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.430
 smartphones in new york city by 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.860
 the two companies were called together 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.500
 by an agency equivalent to the defendant 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.450
 the city to add this 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.729
 function on your devices 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.879

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.739
 they have features that erase data from 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:13.420
 an appliance but they do not have a 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:16.690
 to destroy invalidate total 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:19.900
 ment and the civil 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:23.560
 spoken civilian landmark has come into force since 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:25.620
 the last Monday the 23rd of June 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.150
 then all Brazilian users 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:31.209
 are subject to the new rules 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.600
 rights and duties established by 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:33.730
 law 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.040
 from now on the world comes 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.230
 following up the progress of the proposals 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.660
 the civil milestone from the beginning and you 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.440
 you can check out a guide with everything about 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.420
 subject matter 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.160
 besides an infographic that shows what 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.400
 changes in practice on the Brazilian internet 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:50.890
 with these new rules the links to 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.080
 these two specialist subjects on the 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.720
 in the description is worth the 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.910
 Worth a click and check out a study 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.489
 Japanese indicates that stand in front of 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:03.819
 computer screen is bad for the eyes 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:05.769
 as many mothers and grandparents already knew 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:08.560
 long time 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:11.440
 According to this research, more than 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.930
 seven hours a day staring at a screen 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.269
 causes damage to the mucous layers in the 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.609
 surface of the eyes and decreases 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:20.130
 production of tears that are essential 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:21.850
 to maintain this part of the body 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:23.769
 lubricated and clean 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:26.739
 This is because when we are facing 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:29.109
 we have the tendency to open more 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:31.239
 eyes and blink less than when 

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:32.859
 we perform other tasks 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:34.870
 but who works every day in the 

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:35.980
 front of the computer does not need to enter 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.930
 panicked 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.900
 The hint in this case is to keep a 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:43.570
 in the office and also avoid contact 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:46.920
 direct with the air conditioning bursts 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:50.079
 appear more indicative that the android 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:52.120
 5.0 will be presented soon 

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:54.130
 the information was discovered 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.109
 from a page of the chromium that 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:58.840
 shows a different design for the 

00:03:56.109 --> 00:04:01.480
 dialog boxes of the service to the 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.940
 detail of an icon with a symbol in l 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:06.519
 which can be indicative of lollipop 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:09.459
 and should be the name of the new android 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:12.160
 this page has already been removed from the air 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:15.220
 people take the opportunity to warn that tomorrow 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:18.100
 June 25 is the conference 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:20.560
 google i / o or that should bring many 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:23.740
 news and tecmundo will cover this 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.139

00:04:26.509 --> 00:04:29.629
