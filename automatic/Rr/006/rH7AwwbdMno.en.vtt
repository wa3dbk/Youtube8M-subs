00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960

uh what I hope doesn't happen is because
this<00:00:25.230> is<00:00:25.380> getting<00:00:25.470> quite<00:00:25.740> serious<00:00:26.039> i<00:00:26.430> didn't

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
this is getting quite serious i didn't

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.609 
this is getting quite serious i didn't
expect<00:00:26.730> that<00:00:27.060> from<00:00:27.330> this<00:00:28.080> type<00:00:28.320> of<00:00:28.349> series

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
expect that from this type of series

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.529 
expect that from this type of series
especially<00:00:29.010> being<00:00:29.609> you<00:00:29.820> know<00:00:29.939> middle<00:00:30.269> school

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
especially being you know middle school

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.520 
especially being you know middle school
and<00:00:30.900> or<00:00:31.230> junior<00:00:32.160> high<00:00:32.309> or<00:00:32.579> whatever<00:00:32.880> I

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
and or junior high or whatever I

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.510 
and or junior high or whatever I
didn't<00:00:34.530> think<00:00:34.590> they<00:00:34.739> would<00:00:34.829> add<00:00:34.980> like<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.370> end

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
didn't think they would add like the end

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.479 
didn't think they would add like the end
of<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.760> world<00:00:35.910> possibility<00:00:36.809> and<00:00:36.930> all<00:00:37.050> that

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:37.489 
of the world possibility and all that

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:42.490 
of the world possibility and all that
but<00:00:38.489> we<00:00:38.850> see<00:00:39.059> everybody<00:00:39.600> is<00:00:39.780> sort<00:00:40.140> of<00:00:40.290> maturing

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.500 
but we see everybody is sort of maturing

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.139 
but we see everybody is sort of maturing
what<00:00:43.500> I<00:00:43.530> said<00:00:43.890> I<00:00:43.920> guess<00:00:44.190> is<00:00:44.399> correct<00:00:44.670> with

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
what I said I guess is correct with

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.950 
what I said I guess is correct with
Monica<00:00:45.840> Monica<00:00:46.050> finally<00:00:46.710> realized<00:00:47.160> like<00:00:47.550> I

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 
Monica Monica finally realized like I

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.860 
Monica Monica finally realized like I
might<00:00:48.960> not<00:00:49.230> have<00:00:49.469> hickory<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.690> she's<00:00:51.690> also

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
might not have hickory and she's also

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.990 
might not have hickory and she's also
thinking<00:00:52.410> of<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.590> surface<00:00:52.949> world<00:00:53.100> but<00:00:53.520> she

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
thinking of the surface world but she

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.569 
thinking of the surface world but she
kept<00:00:54.210> thinking<00:00:54.570> of<00:00:54.660> hickory<00:00:55.050> uh<00:00:55.350> when<00:00:56.309> she<00:00:56.460> was

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
kept thinking of hickory uh when she was

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.130 
kept thinking of hickory uh when she was
thinking<00:00:56.879> about<00:00:57.059> that<00:00:57.120> so<00:00:57.539> I<00:00:57.570> don't<00:00:57.870> know<00:00:57.989> if

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
thinking about that so I don't know if

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.250 
thinking about that so I don't know if
she<00:00:58.289> really<00:00:58.320> likes<00:00:58.829> him<00:00:59.210> but<00:01:00.210> she<00:01:00.480> asked<00:01:01.230> the

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
she really likes him but she asked the

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.039 
she really likes him but she asked the
red<00:01:01.500> slug<00:01:01.890> something<00:01:02.370> so<00:01:03.090> I'm<00:01:03.300> guessing<00:01:03.570> she

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
red slug something so I'm guessing she

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.740 
red slug something so I'm guessing she
likes<00:01:04.890> hickory<00:01:05.580> but<00:01:05.880> she<00:01:06.030> just<00:01:06.060> can't<00:01:06.450> say<00:01:06.720> it

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
likes hickory but she just can't say it

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.210 
likes hickory but she just can't say it
because<00:01:06.930> she<00:01:07.170> doesn't<00:01:07.320> know<00:01:07.470> if<00:01:07.680> he<00:01:07.830> likes<00:01:08.070> him

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
because she doesn't know if he likes him

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.060 
because she doesn't know if he likes him
or<00:01:08.310> not<00:01:08.460> that's<00:01:09.299> what<00:01:09.510> I<00:01:09.689> would<00:01:09.810> hope<00:01:10.350> because

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
or not that's what I would hope because

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.770 
or not that's what I would hope because
I<00:01:11.159> I<00:01:11.400> hope<00:01:11.729> this<00:01:11.970> doesn't<00:01:12.360> start<00:01:12.600> like<00:01:12.750> that

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
I I hope this doesn't start like that

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.840 
I I hope this doesn't start like that

married to this human on often neku or
I'll<00:02:32.920> know<00:02:33.220> how<00:02:33.280> to<00:02:33.370> say<00:02:33.640> but<00:02:34.420> when<00:02:35.200> that

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
I'll know how to say but when that

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.309 
I'll know how to say but when that
happens<00:02:36.150> that's<00:02:37.150> probably<00:02:37.569> what<00:02:37.750> is<00:02:37.989> what's

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 
happens that's probably what is what's

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:40.949 
happens that's probably what is what's
going<00:02:38.560> to<00:02:38.650> change<00:02:38.709> it<00:02:39.130> because<00:02:39.600> the<00:02:40.600> sea-god

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
going to change it because the sea-god

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:44.250 
going to change it because the sea-god
probably<00:02:41.440> won't<00:02:41.620> be<00:02:41.769> moved<00:02:42.040> by<00:02:43.000> just<00:02:43.810> the

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
probably won't be moved by just the

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.850 
probably won't be moved by just the
humans<00:02:44.800> alone<00:02:45.069> it<00:02:45.640> will<00:02:45.790> be<00:02:45.910> probably<00:02:46.180> her

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
humans alone it will be probably her

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.800 
humans alone it will be probably her
factor<00:02:47.860> in<00:02:48.100> it<00:02:48.280> because<00:02:48.459> you<00:02:49.390> know<00:02:49.540> she'll

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
factor in it because you know she'll

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.650 
factor in it because you know she'll
feel<00:02:50.080> for<00:02:50.350> her<00:02:50.530> like<00:02:51.130> the<00:02:51.310> way<00:02:51.430> she<00:02:51.880> felt<00:02:52.209> the

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
feel for her like the way she felt the

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.289 
feel for her like the way she felt the
way<00:02:52.810> he<00:02:52.989> felt<00:02:53.200> towards<00:02:53.620> the<00:02:53.739> human<00:02:54.100> girl<00:02:54.299> so

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:55.299 
way he felt towards the human girl so

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:57.270 
way he felt towards the human girl so
they'll<00:02:55.510> change<00:02:55.780> a<00:02:55.930> lot<00:02:56.049> of<00:02:56.110> things<00:02:56.440> but<00:02:56.680> like

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
they'll change a lot of things but like

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.500 
they'll change a lot of things but like
I<00:02:57.400> was<00:02:57.489> saying<00:02:57.549> I<00:02:57.790> hope<00:02:57.940> it's<00:02:58.120> not<00:02:58.209> a<00:02:58.269> chain

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
I was saying I hope it's not a chain

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.020 
I was saying I hope it's not a chain

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
like them yeah the mediator I think

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.880 
like them yeah the mediator I think
that's<00:03:21.310> word<00:03:21.579> I<00:03:22.480> might<00:03:22.989> be<00:03:23.109> messing<00:03:23.440> messing

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
that's word I might be messing messing

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:25.890 
that's word I might be messing messing
up<00:03:24.010> with<00:03:24.190> a<00:03:24.220> few<00:03:24.970> other<00:03:25.120> things<00:03:25.209> but<00:03:25.600> whatever

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
up with a few other things but whatever

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.870 
up with a few other things but whatever
so<00:03:27.030> hopefully<00:03:28.560> that<00:03:29.560> that<00:03:30.190> gets<00:03:30.340> to<00:03:30.549> be<00:03:30.640> right

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
so hopefully that that gets to be right

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:36.660 
so hopefully that that gets to be right
but<00:03:31.180> whatever<00:03:31.510> so<00:03:32.049> I<00:03:33.959> think<00:03:35.070> from<00:03:36.070> what<00:03:36.250> we<00:03:36.430> saw

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
but whatever so I think from what we saw

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:40.920 
but whatever so I think from what we saw
when<00:03:37.000> a<00:03:38.130> curry<00:03:39.130> went<00:03:39.400> after<00:03:39.730> he<00:03:39.880> curry<00:03:40.090> like

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
when a curry went after he curry like

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.590 
when a curry went after he curry like
that<00:03:41.560> was<00:03:41.739> a<00:03:41.769> deciding<00:03:42.340> factor<00:03:42.549> or<00:03:43.030> like<00:03:43.420> it

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
that was a deciding factor or like it

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.890 
that was a deciding factor or like it
might<00:03:43.780> just<00:03:43.989> be<00:03:44.200> like<00:03:44.440> to<00:03:44.920> confuse<00:03:45.370> us<00:03:45.900> viewers

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
might just be like to confuse us viewers

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.420 
might just be like to confuse us viewers
because<00:03:49.320> we<00:03:50.320> still<00:03:50.650> don't<00:03:50.859> know<00:03:50.950> hundred

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
because we still don't know hundred

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.130 
because we still don't know hundred
percent<00:03:51.760> if<00:03:51.910> she<00:03:52.090> likes<00:03:52.329> Hickory<00:03:52.660> she<00:03:52.959> might

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:53.140 
percent if she likes Hickory she might

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:54.569 
percent if she likes Hickory she might
just<00:03:53.170> think<00:03:53.440> of<00:03:53.680> him<00:03:53.980> as<00:03:54.040> a<00:03:54.100> really<00:03:54.489> good

towards<00:04:01.239> anything<00:04:01.450> like<00:04:01.840> are<00:04:02.650> we<00:04:02.920> all<00:04:03.130> going

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
towards anything like are we all going

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
to wake up together which is not

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:06.809 
to wake up together which is not
possible<00:04:05.019> i<00:04:05.440> believe<00:04:05.769> because<00:04:06.010> even<00:04:06.459> if<00:04:06.579> it<00:04:06.700> is

00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:06.819 
possible i believe because even if it is

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:10.170 
possible i believe because even if it is
hibernation<00:04:08.160> other<00:04:09.160> people<00:04:09.639> wake<00:04:09.790> up<00:04:09.819> at
