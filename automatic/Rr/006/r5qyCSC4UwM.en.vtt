the turn that clockwise until it meets a
dead<00:01:02.850> stop<00:01:03.439> that's<00:01:04.439> very<00:01:04.619> important<00:01:04.949> to

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
dead stop that's very important to

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.410

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
again in Reverse we started off just

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.499 
again in Reverse we started off just
tightening<00:01:25.380> that<00:01:25.530> up<00:01:26.119> I'll<00:01:27.119> get<00:01:27.299> to<00:01:27.450> a

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
tightening that up I'll get to a

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.710 
tightening that up I'll get to a
position<00:01:27.659> will<00:01:28.650> feel<00:01:29.100> that<00:01:29.310> clutch<00:01:29.720> starting

of<00:01:35.340> fishing<00:01:35.520> that<00:01:35.670> you're<00:01:35.909> doing<00:01:36.320> but<00:01:37.670> let's

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
of fishing that you're doing but let's

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.700 
of fishing that you're doing but let's
leave<00:01:39.000> it<00:01:39.150> about<00:01:39.270> there<00:01:39.659> that's<00:01:39.869> that's<00:01:40.530> a

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
leave it about there that's that's a

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.649 
leave it about there that's that's a
good<00:01:40.890> 20<00:01:41.310> pound<00:01:41.549> co-op<00:01:41.939> plane<00:01:42.210> actually<00:01:42.450> I

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
good 20 pound co-op plane actually I

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.410 
good 20 pound co-op plane actually I
would<00:01:42.780> think<00:01:42.899> on<00:01:43.079> that<00:01:43.259> reel<00:01:43.470> for<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.740> clutch

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
would think on that reel for the clutch

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.490 
would think on that reel for the clutch
okay<00:01:45.420> so<00:01:45.479> what<00:01:45.750> I'm<00:01:45.810> gonna<00:01:45.899> do<00:01:46.079> now<00:01:46.259> is<00:01:46.290> we're

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
okay so what I'm gonna do now is we're

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.730 
okay so what I'm gonna do now is we're
going<00:01:46.649> to<00:01:46.740> cast<00:01:46.950> out<00:01:47.570> once<00:01:48.570> we<00:01:48.689> cast<00:01:48.930> out<00:01:49.170> we

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
going to cast out once we cast out we

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.100 
going to cast out once we cast out we
need<00:01:49.890> to<00:01:49.920> turn<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.579> outer<00:01:50.850> knob<00:01:51.299> and<00:01:51.540> to

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
need to turn the outer knob and to

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.639 
need to turn the outer knob and to
clockwise<00:01:53.299> and<00:01:54.299> I<00:01:54.420> would<00:01:54.540> suggest<00:01:54.810> for<00:01:55.590> the

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
clockwise and I would suggest for the

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.770 
clockwise and I would suggest for the
first<00:01:55.920> few<00:01:56.280> outings<00:01:56.670> until<00:01:57.180> this<00:01:57.270> bed<00:01:57.509> it<00:01:57.630> in

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
first few outings until this bed it in

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.740 
first few outings until this bed it in
you<00:01:58.259> turn<00:01:58.469> it<00:01:58.619> about<00:01:58.950> half<00:01:59.250> a<00:01:59.399> turn<00:01:59.610> that<00:02:00.540> will

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
you turn it about half a turn that will

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.160 
you turn it about half a turn that will
