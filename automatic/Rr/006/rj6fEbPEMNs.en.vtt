00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:06.390
 hello to all cola dog and in general something 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.700
 I decided to do a series of short montages 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.160
 because on the big montage is not easy 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:16.529
 not strong enough because it is too hot 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:18.480
 and so on and so decided to make small 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.590
 he, too, because I have material 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.000
 on every battlefield counter-strike 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:28.590
 bad yes there and so on and so forth 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.820
 and in general, hand is the first video of 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.250
 series of these short 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.719
 montages just whatever they wrote 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:38.129
 why so little though it is not a mystery writes 

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:41.430
 you could probably make everything out 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:45.510
 materials big wacky installation 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:48.450
 make one big montage but somehow 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.090
 as it is not what I say big 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.910
 moving away from forces is too hot i'm even 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.719
 the cat is resting and here it lies on the floor and 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:01.350

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:14.670
