bike<00:00:03.959> apart<00:00:04.259> and<00:00:04.560> I<00:00:04.680> figured<00:00:04.950> I'd<00:00:05.040> make<00:00:05.160> a

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
bike apart and I figured I'd make a

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:06.380 
bike apart and I figured I'd make a
little<00:00:05.430> clip<00:00:05.609> kind<00:00:05.850> of<00:00:05.910> showing<00:00:06.060> you<00:00:06.150> where<00:00:06.359> I

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
little clip kind of showing you where I

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.200 
little clip kind of showing you where I
where<00:00:07.080> I<00:00:07.109> am<00:00:07.350> and<00:00:07.670> what's<00:00:08.670> going<00:00:08.880> on<00:00:09.000> with<00:00:09.179> it

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
where I am and what's going on with it

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.379 
where I am and what's going on with it
looks<00:00:09.630> nothing<00:00:09.840> like<00:00:09.960> it<00:00:10.230> did<00:00:11.059> down<00:00:12.059> to<00:00:12.240> its

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
looks nothing like it did down to its

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.820 
looks nothing like it did down to its
bare<00:00:12.840> bones<00:00:13.139> pieces<00:00:15.500> and<00:00:16.500> give<00:00:16.650> you<00:00:16.740> an<00:00:16.800> idea

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
bare bones pieces and give you an idea

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.010 
bare bones pieces and give you an idea
what<00:00:17.220> we<00:00:17.369> are<00:00:17.520> working<00:00:17.910> with<00:00:18.180> that's<00:00:18.779> what<00:00:18.900> we

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
what we are working with that's what we

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.390 
what we are working with that's what we
got<00:00:19.170> for<00:00:19.380> the<00:00:19.470> frame<00:00:19.710> so<00:00:20.010> I'll<00:00:20.160> see<00:00:20.340> him

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
got for the frame so I'll see him

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.210 
got for the frame so I'll see him
blasted<00:00:20.880> and<00:00:21.140> cleaned<00:00:22.140> up<00:00:22.320> I'll<00:00:22.650> weld<00:00:22.949> it<00:00:23.100> up

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
blasted and cleaned up I'll weld it up

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.460 
blasted and cleaned up I'll weld it up
and<00:00:23.400> then<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:23.580> welds<00:00:23.850> all<00:00:23.970> ground<00:00:24.240> down<00:00:24.510> did

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
and then the welds all ground down did

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.310 
and then the welds all ground down did
some<00:00:25.789> extra<00:00:26.789> webbing<00:00:27.029> underneath<00:00:27.990> here<00:00:28.199> to

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
some extra webbing underneath here to

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.900 
some extra webbing underneath here to
help<00:00:28.470> support<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:28.890> motor<00:00:29.070> plate<00:00:29.279> kind<00:00:29.849> of

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
help support the motor plate kind of

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.099 
help support the motor plate kind of
keep<00:00:30.090> it<00:00:30.240> from<00:00:30.449> you<00:00:30.660> know<00:00:30.750> when<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:30.929> motor

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
keep it from you know when the motor

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.260 
keep it from you know when the motor
wants<00:00:31.349> to<00:00:31.439> torque<00:00:31.740> that<00:00:32.340> can't<00:00:32.940> want<00:00:33.059> to<00:00:33.120> keep

wants to torque that can't want to keep

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.459 
wants to torque that can't want to keep
wants<00:00:33.600> to<00:00:33.690> keep<00:00:33.840> it<00:00:33.989> flat<00:00:34.200> so<00:00:35.090> that<00:00:36.469> this

it's looking pretty good should have put
it<00:01:01.710> on<00:01:01.800> a<00:01:01.829> stand<00:01:02.070> before<00:01:02.280> I<00:01:02.399> started<00:01:02.670> filming

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
it on a stand before I started filming

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.340 
it on a stand before I started filming
how<00:01:03.449> I<00:01:03.480> go<00:01:03.690> way<00:01:03.930> back

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
how I go way back

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
yeah yeah that's what the frame looks

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.120 
yeah yeah that's what the frame looks
like<00:01:12.060> a<00:01:12.299> couple<00:01:13.110> of<00:01:13.260> things<00:01:13.439> I<00:01:13.530> would<00:01:13.710> have

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
like a couple of things I would have

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.219 
like a couple of things I would have
done<00:01:14.340> differently<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:14.970> I<00:01:15.930> wouldn't<00:01:16.170> know

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
done differently and I wouldn't know

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.749 
done differently and I wouldn't know
well<00:01:16.350> do<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.650> taps<00:01:16.920> do<00:01:17.159> it<00:01:17.280> I<00:01:17.400> would<00:01:17.549> have<00:01:17.610> let

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
well do the taps do it I would have let

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.910 
well do the taps do it I would have let
them<00:01:17.880> float<00:01:18.180> over<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.479> frame<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:18.860> for<00:01:19.860> the

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
them float over the frame and for the

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.920 
them float over the frame and for the
gas<00:01:20.100> tank<00:01:20.310> what<00:01:20.759> I<00:01:21.150> did<00:01:21.450> so<00:01:21.900> so<00:01:22.409> be<00:01:22.560> it

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
gas tank what I did so so be it

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.690 
gas tank what I did so so be it
couple<00:01:24.930> of<00:01:25.020> little<00:01:25.320> things<00:01:25.439> -<00:01:25.799> but<00:01:25.979> you<00:01:26.610> don't

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
couple of little things - but you don't

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.539 
couple of little things - but you don't
know<00:01:26.850> -<00:01:26.909> you<00:01:27.090> make<00:01:27.240> one<00:01:27.390> right<00:01:31.070> how's<00:01:32.070> it<00:01:32.189> going

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
know - you make one right how's it going

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.620 
know - you make one right how's it going
you<00:01:32.670> got<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:33.320> gas<00:01:34.320> tank<00:01:34.619> getting<00:01:35.579> sealed<00:01:35.909> and

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
you got the gas tank getting sealed and

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.929 
you got the gas tank getting sealed and
the<00:01:37.470> instructions<00:01:38.159> on<00:01:38.430> this<00:01:39.060> stuff<00:01:40.790> where<00:01:41.790> to

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
the instructions on this stuff where to

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.550 
the instructions on this stuff where to
wash<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.329> fuel<00:01:42.570> tank<00:01:42.810> out<00:01:42.990> very<00:01:43.320> well

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
wash the fuel tank out very well

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.649 
wash the fuel tank out very well
especially<00:01:43.829> if<00:01:44.100> it<00:01:44.189> was<00:01:44.220> a<00:01:44.460> tank<00:01:44.880> that<00:01:45.000> had<00:01:45.119> old

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
especially if it was a tank that had old

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.289 
especially if it was a tank that had old
fuel<00:01:45.960> in<00:01:46.110> it<00:01:46.229> and<00:01:46.740> they<00:01:46.950> I<00:01:47.189> recommended<00:01:48.000> using

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
fuel in it and they I recommended using

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.929 
fuel in it and they I recommended using
a<00:01:48.570> marine<00:01:48.990> clean<00:01:49.290> I<00:01:49.530> can<00:01:50.280> hatch<00:01:50.430> you<00:01:50.790> know<00:01:50.909> a

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
a marine clean I can hatch you know a

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.740 
a marine clean I can hatch you know a
little<00:01:51.210> bit<00:01:51.299> acid<00:01:51.720> probably<00:01:52.049> to<00:01:52.140> it<00:01:53.659> one<00:01:54.659> to

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
little bit acid probably to it one to

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.730 
little bit acid probably to it one to
one<00:01:54.899> ratio<00:01:55.079> on<00:01:55.530> that<00:01:55.850> probably<00:01:56.850> a<00:01:57.500> four<00:01:58.500> cups

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
one ratio on that probably a four cups

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.190 
one ratio on that probably a four cups
total<00:01:58.950> in<00:01:59.640> the<00:02:00.060> tank<00:02:00.299> and<00:02:00.450> squash<00:02:00.750> it<00:02:00.780> around

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
total in the tank and squash it around

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.330 
total in the tank and squash it around
and<00:02:01.409> let<00:02:01.500> it<00:02:01.560> sit<00:02:01.680> in<00:02:01.710> there<00:02:01.860> for<00:02:01.890> about<00:02:02.040> a<00:02:02.130> half

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
and let it sit in there for about a half

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.709 
and let it sit in there for about a half
an<00:02:02.460> hour<00:02:02.549> every<00:02:02.909> couple<00:02:03.390> of<00:02:03.420> minutes<00:02:03.570> just

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
an hour every couple of minutes just

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.200
