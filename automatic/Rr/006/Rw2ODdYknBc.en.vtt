 and how about youtube people in this 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.850
 occasion I come with some news 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.160
 Officers merged with strong rumors 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.349
 around hello escalation and a small 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.880
 halo 5 detail first let's talk about 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.860
 hello escalation that has become a 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.870
 central theme in my channel in the past 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.760
 days as you will already know there is a 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.949
 series of halo comics released by 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.480
 dark heart the story told is 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.789
 official and follow the events that occurred 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.590
 after halo 4 so far I've 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.359
 talked about the first 2 numbers in my 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.130
 channel but for the title of the video already 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.050
 they will be assuming what I am going to say in 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.270
 this video a few hours ago the 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.739
 cover of the newly confirmed number 5 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.510
 of the series together with a small 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.030
 synopsis of it which says what 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.980
 following disappeared for 30 years a 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.050
 legendary warship of lions s is 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.059
 discovered behind enemy lines without 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.890
 However , Lord's past with the 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.079
 Captain of the ship endangers the 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.730
 mission the sabotage investigation 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.710
 inside the unne if you continue 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.300
 while a journalist infiltrates 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.579
 sacred land of elite in search of 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.530
 answers that synopsis is completely 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.750
 official and from now on we enter 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.280
 in the territory of rumors of the video what 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.379
 which means that nothing in what I'm going to 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.120
 say next is confirmed well 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.770
 Do not get so excited about the 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.480
 synopsis is written a warship 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.510
 of lions that has been found 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.920
 after his disappearance after 30 years 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.540
 being in enemy territory not 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.130
 the name of the ship is never mentioned 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.810
 but there are many people who are 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.090
 speculating in the forums that it's about 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.220
 the one is that fire spirit which as 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.980
 the name says belongs to the ngo and 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:29.100
 disappeared in two thousand 531 events 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:31.080
 of the comic are developed in 2.558 so 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.820
 that there is a difference of 27 years between 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.350
 the dates although they are not 30 years 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.540
 it's exactly a pretty number 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.280
 nearby it is also mentioned that the orkut 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.350
 have problems with the captain of the 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.090
 ship which interfere in the mission as well 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.830
 that assuming it's about the spirit 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.900
 of air then we can expect to see 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.910
 conflicts between the orkut and the captain 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.460
 cutter the possibilities in question 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:52.470
 of the country spirit are quite high already 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.300
 that this comic is a perfect mix of 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.130
 new and old elements of the universe 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.170
 of halo from different models of 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.970
 vehicles and characters until the union of 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.740
 different stories of characters that 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.630
 they relate to the central story of 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.670
 the series the inquisitor already made his 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.890
 appearance in the comic and in the first 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.990
 series called initiation the spartan of 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.850
 halo reach also makes his little cameo 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.660
 after finishing the war so I do not see 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.520
 because I do not know 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.350
 bringing more ice elements to these 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.880
 stories now remember that it is not 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.040
 confirmed the presence of the spirit 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.020
 fire or in the comic so if it turns out 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.330
 be false either come to my channel with 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.800
 torches ready to tear me and 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.380
 much less I am confirming that the 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.150
 ship will make its appearance in halo 5 in case 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.640
 that they have misinterpreted the title 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.410
 of the video since it's not like that the comic will be 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.180
 released in the month of April so up 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.980
 then we do not know the true truth 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.020
 of this rumor but we can expect the 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.210
 confirmation or denial of this rumor 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.710
 in my same channel to finish the video 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:46.020
 I leave this image that is the first 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:47.790
 conceptual art of halo 5 yes I already know that 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.410
 You have already seen it on 20 channels before 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.570
 that in mine but had other things 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.460
 more important to attend so the 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:55.530
 mind was delayed on my part but still 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:57.000
 so I think it's important to upload it to 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.100
 channel in case someone had not yet 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.500
 seen now I can not do a great 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.420
 deep analysis or perform thousands of 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.700
 theories around this image as 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.620
 it's just a conceptual art more than anything 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.560
 they threw it for the purpose of giving us 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.390
 a look at the visual or aesthetic aspect 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.520
 who will have the next game we can 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.560
 observe a colony located in a place 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.570
 unknown galaxy with a ship 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.170
 similar to the infinite and is not very 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.819
 developer 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.160
 but it is the first official news of 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:25.500
 halo 5 in the year and is confirmed as 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.090
 a location that we will be exploring in 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.680
 a future and now I say goodbye 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.420

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.690

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.640

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.770

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.870
