proper the proper size across there a

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:53.879 
proper the proper size across there a
banach<00:01:50.499> each<00:01:50.709> across<00:01:51.549> okay<00:01:52.359> so<00:01:53.139> all<00:01:53.469> you<00:01:53.619> do<00:01:53.799> is

00:01:53.879 --> 00:01:53.889 
banach each across okay so all you do is

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:58.589 
banach each across okay so all you do is
fill<00:01:54.130> it<00:01:54.279> with<00:01:54.429> compost<00:01:55.499> get<00:01:56.499> a<00:01:56.529> stick<00:01:57.569> make<00:01:58.569> a

00:01:58.589 --> 00:01:58.599 
fill it with compost get a stick make a

00:01:58.599 --> 00:01:59.489 
fill it with compost get a stick make a
hole<00:01:58.959> in<00:01:59.200> it

00:01:59.489 --> 00:01:59.499 
hole in it

00:01:59.499 --> 00:02:02.190 
hole in it
wiggle<00:01:59.889> it<00:01:59.979> round<00:02:00.249> so<00:02:00.639> it'll<00:02:01.329> go<00:02:01.509> in<00:02:01.719> push

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
wiggle it round so it'll go in push

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.959 
wiggle it round so it'll go in push
right<00:02:02.649> practically<00:02:03.249> right<00:02:03.429> down<00:02:03.669> to<00:02:03.880> the

right practically right down to the

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:06.779 
right practically right down to the
bottom<00:02:04.359> and<00:02:04.569> then<00:02:05.559> you<00:02:05.590> just<00:02:06.009> put<00:02:06.189> your<00:02:06.399> slip

00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:06.789 
bottom and then you just put your slip

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:10.559 
bottom and then you just put your slip
in<00:02:07.119> it<00:02:07.569> like<00:02:08.020> that<00:02:08.729> okay<00:02:09.729> and<00:02:09.759> just<00:02:10.119> cover<00:02:10.360> up

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 
in it like that okay and just cover up

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:12.840 
in it like that okay and just cover up
the<00:02:10.719> top

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
the top

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.150 
the top
there<00:02:13.690> we<00:02:13.810> are<00:02:13.840> now<00:02:14.290> I've<00:02:14.530> got<00:02:14.800> mine<00:02:15.010> because

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
there we are now I've got mine because

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.420 
there we are now I've got mine because
they're<00:02:15.670> quite<00:02:15.940> long<00:02:16.590> they<00:02:17.590> tend<00:02:18.010> to<00:02:18.130> fall

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
they're quite long they tend to fall

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.460 
they're quite long they tend to fall
over<00:02:18.850> a<00:02:18.880> bit<00:02:19.120> so<00:02:19.300> I've<00:02:19.480> got<00:02:19.780> mine<00:02:20.020> in<00:02:20.200> an<00:02:20.320> ice

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
over a bit so I've got mine in an ice

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.900 
over a bit so I've got mine in an ice
cream<00:02:22.050> tub<00:02:23.050> it<00:02:23.680> tends<00:02:23.950> to<00:02:24.040> fit<00:02:24.340> ten<00:02:24.610> in<00:02:24.760> there

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
cream tub it tends to fit ten in there

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.570 
cream tub it tends to fit ten in there
quite<00:02:25.150> quite<00:02:25.600> snugly<00:02:26.050> and<00:02:26.470> all<00:02:27.040> I'll<00:02:27.190> do<00:02:27.400> is

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
quite quite snugly and all I'll do is

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.970 
quite quite snugly and all I'll do is
water<00:02:27.790> from<00:02:28.240> the<00:02:28.390> bottom<00:02:28.780> and<00:02:28.990> then<00:02:29.620> the<00:02:29.770> water

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
water from the bottom and then the water

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.550 
water from the bottom and then the water
will<00:02:30.160> come<00:02:30.370> at<00:02:30.490> the<00:02:30.580> top<00:02:30.820> now<00:02:31.360> these<00:02:31.660> can't<00:02:32.260> go

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
will come at the top now these can't go

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.480 
will come at the top now these can't go
outside<00:02:32.830> until<00:02:33.790> all<00:02:34.150> frost<00:02:34.600> has<00:02:34.930> gone<00:02:35.490> because

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:36.490 
outside until all frost has gone because

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:40.470 
outside until all frost has gone because
they're<00:02:37.390> very<00:02:37.570> frost<00:02:38.050> sensitive<00:02:39.120> so<00:02:40.120> I'll

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
they're very frost sensitive so I'll

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.440 
they're very frost sensitive so I'll
just<00:02:40.840> explain<00:02:41.230> a<00:02:41.350> little<00:02:41.560> bit<00:02:41.800> more<00:02:41.940> so<00:02:42.940> if<00:02:43.270> you

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
just explain a little bit more so if you

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.500 
just explain a little bit more so if you
find<00:02:43.810> out<00:02:44.050> when<00:02:44.260> your<00:02:44.440> last<00:02:44.680> frost<00:02:45.190> date<00:02:45.640> is<00:02:45.910> in

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
find out when your last frost date is in

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.110 
find out when your last frost date is in
your<00:02:46.930> area<00:02:47.470> then<00:02:48.130> you<00:02:48.160> can<00:02:48.520> put<00:02:48.730> them<00:02:48.880> outside

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
your area then you can put them outside

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.530 
your area then you can put them outside
from<00:02:50.080> then<00:02:50.410> and<00:02:51.040> all<00:02:51.370> you<00:02:51.640> need<00:02:51.880> to<00:02:52.090> do<00:02:52.270> you

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
from then and all you need to do you

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.330 
from then and all you need to do you
don't<00:02:52.810> need<00:02:53.050> to<00:02:53.200> take<00:02:53.470> them<00:02:53.740> out<00:02:53.920> of<00:02:53.950> this

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
don't need to take them out of this

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.670 
don't need to take them out of this
cardboard<00:02:55.300> tube<00:02:55.600> at<00:02:55.780> all<00:02:55.960> you<00:02:56.140> just<00:02:56.170> dig<00:02:56.650> a

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
cardboard tube at all you just dig a

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.280 
cardboard tube at all you just dig a
hole<00:02:56.980> and<00:02:57.310> you<00:02:57.820> just<00:02:58.120> put<00:02:58.600> them<00:02:58.780> in<00:02:59.020> that<00:02:59.230> hole

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
hole and you just put them in that hole

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.740 
hole and you just put them in that hole
now<00:03:00.100> if<00:03:00.220> they'll<00:03:00.400> get<00:03:00.640> roots<00:03:00.880> down<00:03:01.120> the<00:03:01.330> bottom

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
now if they'll get roots down the bottom

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.240 
now if they'll get roots down the bottom
and<00:03:01.960> it<00:03:02.290> doesn't<00:03:02.590> matter<00:03:02.740> because<00:03:02.890> they<00:03:03.220> can

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
and it doesn't matter because they can

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.340 
and it doesn't matter because they can
come<00:03:03.640> straight<00:03:03.940> out<00:03:04.060> you<00:03:04.270> haven't<00:03:04.840> got<00:03:05.110> to

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
come straight out you haven't got to

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.850 
come straight out you haven't got to
disturb<00:03:05.920> the<00:03:06.580> roots<00:03:06.790> that<00:03:07.150> are<00:03:07.300> in<00:03:07.450> there

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
disturb the roots that are in there

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.590 
disturb the roots that are in there
before<00:03:08.860> you<00:03:09.220> put<00:03:09.460> them<00:03:09.610> out<00:03:09.760> like<00:03:10.150> you<00:03:10.390> would

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
before you put them out like you would

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.380 
before you put them out like you would
if<00:03:10.780> you<00:03:10.930> bought<00:03:11.230> the<00:03:11.530> very<00:03:12.190> expensive<00:03:12.730> cells

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
if you bought the very expensive cells

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.200 
if you bought the very expensive cells
that<00:03:13.720> they<00:03:13.930> they<00:03:14.500> have<00:03:14.770> for<00:03:15.190> them<00:03:15.370> so<00:03:15.850> this<00:03:15.970> is

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:16.210 
that they they have for them so this is

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:18.450 
that they they have for them so this is
this<00:03:16.450> is<00:03:16.690> great<00:03:16.900> and<00:03:17.290> the<00:03:17.770> cardboard<00:03:18.220> tube

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:18.460 
this is great and the cardboard tube

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:21.630 
this is great and the cardboard tube
will<00:03:18.700> biodegrade<00:03:19.560> now<00:03:20.560> these<00:03:20.860> do<00:03:21.190> tend<00:03:21.610> to

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
will biodegrade now these do tend to

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.610 
will biodegrade now these do tend to
they're<00:03:21.850> from<00:03:22.090> the<00:03:22.240> bindweed<00:03:22.720> family<00:03:23.440> and

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
they're from the bindweed family and

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.930 
they're from the bindweed family and
they<00:03:23.740> do<00:03:23.800> tend<00:03:24.340> to<00:03:25.290> to<00:03:26.290> go<00:03:26.500> quite<00:03:27.340> a<00:03:27.370> long<00:03:27.730> way

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
they do tend to to go quite a long way

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.200 
they do tend to to go quite a long way
so<00:03:28.540> the<00:03:28.660> best<00:03:28.900> way<00:03:29.260> to<00:03:29.620> have<00:03:30.460> these<00:03:30.790> because

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:31.210 
so the best way to have these because

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:32.520 
so the best way to have these because
you'll<00:03:31.450> get<00:03:31.570> all<00:03:31.690> the<00:03:31.780> potatoes<00:03:32.170> down<00:03:32.350> the

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
you'll get all the potatoes down the

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.620 
you'll get all the potatoes down the
bottom<00:03:32.890> the<00:03:33.280> best<00:03:33.580> way<00:03:33.790> to<00:03:33.820> control<00:03:34.420> these

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
bottom the best way to control these

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:36.960 
bottom the best way to control these
without<00:03:34.990> them<00:03:35.110> going<00:03:35.260> everywhere<00:03:35.950> is<00:03:36.220> to<00:03:36.790> have

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
without them going everywhere is to have

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.800 
without them going everywhere is to have
a<00:03:37.000> wigwam<00:03:37.630> of<00:03:37.990> bean<00:03:38.860> poles<00:03:39.340> and<00:03:39.820> have<00:03:40.540> them

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
a wigwam of bean poles and have them

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.650 
a wigwam of bean poles and have them
growing<00:03:41.560> up<00:03:41.980> there<00:03:42.550> that<00:03:43.180> way<00:03:43.420> you've<00:03:43.630> got

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
growing up there that way you've got

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.190 
growing up there that way you've got
them<00:03:44.020> confined<00:03:44.530> it's<00:03:44.770> quite<00:03:44.980> a<00:03:45.010> small<00:03:45.460> space

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
them confined it's quite a small space

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.810 
them confined it's quite a small space
above<00:03:47.200> the<00:03:47.380> top<00:03:47.590> of<00:03:47.620> the<00:03:47.860> soil<00:03:48.130> and<00:03:48.400> then<00:03:48.580> all

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:48.820 
above the top of the soil and then all

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.400 
above the top of the soil and then all
the<00:03:48.910> potatoes<00:03:49.330> will<00:03:49.510> grow<00:03:49.660> down<00:03:49.900> underneath

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
the potatoes will grow down underneath

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.110 
the potatoes will grow down underneath
otherwise<00:03:51.010> they'll<00:03:51.310> trade<00:03:51.580> all<00:03:51.760> over<00:03:52.030> the

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
otherwise they'll trade all over the

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.510 
otherwise they'll trade all over the
place<00:03:52.330> so<00:03:53.080> that's<00:03:53.290> the<00:03:53.470> way<00:03:53.590> to<00:03:53.650> do<00:03:54.070> them<00:03:54.280> and

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:54.520 
place so that's the way to do them and

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.750 
place so that's the way to do them and
they<00:03:55.300> will<00:03:55.600> be<00:03:55.780> ready<00:03:56.550> usually<00:03:57.550> in<00:03:57.670> about

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
they will be ready usually in about

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.770 
they will be ready usually in about
September<00:03:58.450> time<00:03:59.260> but<00:04:00.100> it's<00:04:00.970> best<00:04:01.240> just<00:04:01.330> to<00:04:01.570> dig

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:01.780 
September time but it's best just to dig

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.590 
September time but it's best just to dig
one<00:04:01.990> plant<00:04:02.320> up<00:04:02.590> and<00:04:02.770> see<00:04:03.160> and<00:04:03.460> hopefully<00:04:04.360> I'll

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:04.600 
one plant up and see and hopefully I'll
