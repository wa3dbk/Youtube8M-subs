00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590

what I didn't enjoy in highlights as
always<00:02:46.220> right<00:02:47.180> guys<00:02:47.390> so<00:02:47.630> this<00:02:47.750> team<00:02:48.020> was<00:02:48.140> a

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
always right guys so this team was a

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.650 
always right guys so this team was a
massive<00:02:48.710> surprise<00:02:48.920> reason<00:02:49.640> being<00:02:49.820> because<00:02:50.000> i

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
massive surprise reason being because i

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.330 
massive surprise reason being because i
thought<00:02:51.050> the<00:02:51.260> defense<00:02:51.680> was<00:02:51.980> going<00:02:52.190> to<00:02:52.250> be

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
thought the defense was going to be

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.430 
thought the defense was going to be
really<00:02:52.640> strong<00:02:52.910> in<00:02:53.120> the<00:02:53.210> attack<00:02:53.540> a<00:02:53.810> little

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
really strong in the attack a little

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.200 
really strong in the attack a little
weak<00:02:54.650> but<00:02:55.250> it<00:02:55.400> really<00:02:55.550> wasn't<00:02:55.790> it<00:02:56.000> was<00:02:56.120> the

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:56.210 
weak but it really wasn't it was the

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:57.910 
weak but it really wasn't it was the
other<00:02:56.270> way<00:02:56.390> around<00:02:56.480> every<00:02:57.230> game<00:02:57.350> i<00:02:57.410> played<00:02:57.770> i

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
other way around every game i played i

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.040 
other way around every game i played i
scored<00:02:58.250> at<00:02:58.340> least<00:02:58.370> four<00:02:58.850> and<00:02:59.060> conceded<00:02:59.780> at

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050 
scored at least four and conceded at

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:02.650 
scored at least four and conceded at
least<00:03:00.380> two<00:03:00.680> it's<00:03:01.430> just<00:03:01.970> the<00:03:02.030> way<00:03:02.120> of<00:03:02.330> the<00:03:02.360> team

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
least two it's just the way of the team

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.290 
least two it's just the way of the team
rafi<00:03:03.590> a<00:03:03.620> is<00:03:03.830> very<00:03:04.100> temperamental<00:03:04.550> he<00:03:04.940> saves

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300 
rafi a is very temperamental he saves

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.200 
rafi a is very temperamental he saves
near<00:03:05.990> enough<00:03:06.200> every<00:03:06.680> show<00:03:06.920> on<00:03:07.100> the<00:03:07.340> ground<00:03:07.640> but

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:08.210 
near enough every show on the ground but

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:09.970 
near enough every show on the ground but
as<00:03:08.300> soon<00:03:08.420> as<00:03:08.570> they're<00:03:08.750> lofted<00:03:09.200> you<00:03:09.590> can't<00:03:09.830> get

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
as soon as they're lofted you can't get

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.580 
as soon as they're lofted you can't get
a<00:03:10.010> hand<00:03:10.220> to<00:03:10.400> it<00:03:10.550> is<00:03:10.820> ridiculous<00:03:11.420> Zuma<00:03:12.260> seemed

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
a hand to it is ridiculous Zuma seemed

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.230 
a hand to it is ridiculous Zuma seemed
to<00:03:12.710> be<00:03:12.830> the<00:03:12.950> best<00:03:13.130> defender<00:03:13.640> I<00:03:13.850> don't<00:03:14.180> know

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:14.240 
to be the best defender I don't know

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.030 
to be the best defender I don't know
