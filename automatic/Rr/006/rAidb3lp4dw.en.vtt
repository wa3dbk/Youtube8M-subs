comes<00:00:15.179> with<00:00:15.240> its<00:00:15.540> own<00:00:15.660> CPU<00:00:16.260> editor<00:00:16.710> that

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
comes with its own CPU editor that

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.910 
comes with its own CPU editor that
allows<00:00:17.609> you<00:00:18.180> to<00:00:18.420> really<00:00:18.600> optimize<00:00:18.930> the

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
allows you to really optimize the

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.620 
allows you to really optimize the
battery<00:00:20.580> life<00:00:20.789> um<00:00:21.320> so<00:00:22.609> let's<00:00:23.609> see<00:00:24.240> what<00:00:24.449> this

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
battery life um so let's see what this

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
frequency for CPU 0 and CP 1 i'm so you

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.560 
frequency for CPU 0 and CP 1 i'm so you
can<00:01:28.200> also<00:01:28.350> for<00:01:28.920> steel<00:01:29.250> core<00:01:29.580> on<00:01:29.880> all<00:01:30.150> of<00:01:30.390> this

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
can also for steel core on all of this

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.640 
can also for steel core on all of this
stuff<00:01:31.370> here<00:01:32.750> and<00:01:33.750> you<00:01:34.290> can<00:01:34.410> choose<00:01:34.620> the

stuff here and you can choose the
governor<00:01:35.130> for<00:01:35.280> cpu<00:01:35.850> 0<00:01:36.120> and<00:01:36.300> cpu<00:01:36.720> one<00:01:37.280> so<00:01:38.280> that's

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
governor for cpu 0 and cpu one so that's

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.930 
governor for cpu 0 and cpu one so that's
really<00:01:39.360> cool<00:01:39.710> now<00:01:40.710> if<00:01:40.980> you<00:01:41.100> want<00:01:41.310> to<00:01:41.400> change

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
governor here it's on on demand you can

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.070 
governor here it's on on demand you can
just<00:02:13.560> hit<00:02:13.680> enter<00:02:14.420> and<00:02:15.420> let's<00:02:15.690> look<00:02:15.810> at<00:02:15.959> the

just hit enter and let's look at the

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.790 
just hit enter and let's look at the
maximum<00:02:16.470> frequency<00:02:16.769> for<00:02:17.280> CPU<00:02:17.850> 0<00:02:18.300> it's<00:02:19.200> at<00:02:19.470> its

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
maximum frequency for CPU 0 it's at its

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.090 
maximum frequency for CPU 0 it's at its
maximum<00:02:20.480> you<00:02:21.480> can<00:02:21.510> also<00:02:21.780> lower<00:02:22.230> those<00:02:22.470> values

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
maximum you can also lower those values

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.750 
maximum you can also lower those values
if<00:02:23.310> you<00:02:23.459> want<00:02:23.700> even<00:02:24.030> more<00:02:24.269> battery<00:02:24.810> life

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
if you want even more battery life

an<00:02:45.040> earful<00:02:45.870> two<00:02:46.870> days<00:02:47.250> so<00:02:48.250> that's<00:02:48.489> one<00:02:48.700> of<00:02:48.730> the

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
an earful two days so that's one of the

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.030 
an earful two days so that's one of the
features<00:02:49.180> one<00:02:49.690> of<00:02:49.780> the<00:02:49.840> advantages<00:02:50.350> of<00:02:50.890> having

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
features one of the advantages of having

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.670 
features one of the advantages of having
that<00:02:51.430> versus<00:02:52.390> like<00:02:52.630> using<00:02:52.840> a<00:02:52.989> set<00:02:53.230> cpu<00:02:53.440> or

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
that versus like using a set cpu or

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.740 
that versus like using a set cpu or
something<00:02:54.100> is<00:02:54.220> that<00:02:54.250> this<00:02:54.910> one<00:02:55.209> doesn't<00:02:55.720> have

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
something is that this one doesn't have

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.040 
something is that this one doesn't have
ads<00:02:56.110> and<00:02:56.380> also<00:02:56.650> it<00:02:56.800> runs<00:02:57.280> in<00:02:57.489> the<00:02:57.610> system<00:02:58.050> so

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050 
ads and also it runs in the system so

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.100 
ads and also it runs in the system so
it's<00:02:59.200> a<00:02:59.260> lot<00:02:59.410> more<00:02:59.440> efficient<00:03:00.330> so<00:03:01.330> that's<00:03:01.870> kind

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
it's a lot more efficient so that's kind

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.750 
it's a lot more efficient so that's kind
of<00:03:02.610> what's<00:03:03.870> what<00:03:04.870> what<00:03:05.380> you<00:03:05.680> can<00:03:05.860> get<00:03:06.070> with<00:03:06.550> the

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
i'll go ahead and do a power cycle and

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.819 
i'll go ahead and do a power cycle and
try<00:04:03.880> it<00:04:03.940> for<00:04:04.209> a<00:04:04.269> day<00:04:04.329> or<00:04:04.630> two<00:04:04.780> and<00:04:05.019> that<00:04:05.680> it

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:05.829 
try it for a day or two and that it

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:07.949 
try it for a day or two and that it
should<00:04:05.859> definitely<00:04:06.310> give<00:04:06.730> you<00:04:06.760> a<00:04:06.910> really<00:04:07.690> good

battery life and this is I think the
best<00:04:09.609> one<00:04:09.880> for<00:04:10.799> getting<00:04:11.799> more<00:04:11.920> battery<00:04:12.220> life

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250
