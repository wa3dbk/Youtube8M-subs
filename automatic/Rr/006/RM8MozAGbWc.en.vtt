00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:05.550
 Y 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.939
 for example so good here giving them a 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.470
 news plus a quick news and that 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:22.779
 is going to love a lot as you see we have 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.700
 new crafter for the 0.9 which johan 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:27.009
 he said for those who wonder hey let's go 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:29.470
 to move the sticks and we will place it 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:30.849
 no no is not mobile, that is, if you have 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.110
 the 8 sticks in the inventory 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:33.489
 automatically you appear the 8 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.280
 sticks up things do not move them 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:38.110
 solitos puts on so that says it's 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.640
 for futures not yet but in futures 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.170
 in future versions may already 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.210
 we can move things to inventory 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.920
 to change it as I started 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.989
 so for now not and as you see then 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.960
 oscurito things which are not 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:51.370
 we have the ones we do not have made and the 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.230
 others that if we already have made them 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:56.079
 appear up and with colors icon 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.550
 also worth noting in this that 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:00.640
 everything is stirred, they realize 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:02.140
 it's like an order but I do not know 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.300
 how am I going to work this so we would have 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.010
 to wait until 0.9 comes out the 0 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:08.020
 side in the bulldog in which they go to 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.640
 add this is supposed to be for 0.9 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.860
 but they do not specify if in the 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.900
 Bibles are there or if they are just going to 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.920
 add up to 0.9 point zero then 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.900
 As you know there are things that are going to 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.260
 add up to 0.9 point 1 that does not 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.000
 add in 0.9 point zero 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.860
 that's in terms of new graphics you see 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.660
 beautiful guys I loved my cat and the 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.730
 another good one is an image of a 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:29.310
 village that I did not go up yesterday but good 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:30.750
 this image is well burgo can be 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.240
 notice that there are houses in the water and 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.920
 houses some measures on others there are houses 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.510
 that they do not even have like that the 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.850
 door to others are not giving 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.290
 where they should give and there are small 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.030
 errors that you must configure there for 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.340
 that the houses are already built well but 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.050
 Well, as you see already already already already villages 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.000
 Well, they're just a little 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.740
 cracks but it looks like they're going to 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.030
 correct and they are are final touches 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.620
 that are giving the very graphic 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.300
 edition so that they take out the mobile because 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.790
 As you also know the one of the 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.020
 mushroom cows these are also supposed 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.970
 as far as fit and also and my 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.290
 administrator told me is that those are 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.790
 things that are going to add almost to the end 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.110
 when they were going to take out the mobiles 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.880
 how good they are adding the latest 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.380

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.179
