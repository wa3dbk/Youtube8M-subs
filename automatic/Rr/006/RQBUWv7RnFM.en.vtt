00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.709
 I was hungry and me 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.580
 and how about friends how is the action 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.680
 medium code mod 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.320
 reported in one more video for the channel 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.720
 and so good this time I bring you 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.300
 a new glitch to be immortal in 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.820
 call of duty advanced warfare exo 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.430
 zombies and well that English consists 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.619
 in being on a platform floating in 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.930
 which will be totally unreachable 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.940
 for the zombies and good friends before 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.620
 go into details with English I want to 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.570
 ask them to stay until the end 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.579
 of the video since I want to tell you some 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.409
 how many little things and good with that 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.420
 said then we can proceed with the 

00:00:43.409 --> 00:00:47.399
 video now if the first thing we will have 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.260
 what to do is have all the 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.239
 floodgates that take us to the famous 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.149
 clicks we will also occupy the exoskeleton 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.309
 since it will be necessary and they are not going to 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.170
 follow this entire route until you reach 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.690
 this place the whole route that I followed from 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.309
 the truck to this exact point here 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.739
 friends will meet with these 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.630
 stairs and that black platform that 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.570
 is up here what we are going to 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.370
 to do is to use our exoskeleton and 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.620
 jump to the platform that 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.750
 As you can see, it does not come to me the first time 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.310
 the second I am already above that happiness 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.829
 platform 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:21.170
 in which I am suspended and will be 

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:23.090
 immortal before the zombies and there will be 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.280
 god that is easy enough sometimes 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.950
 It costs a little work, it's just 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.390
 tomorrow when you grab it well you're going to 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.369
 see what will come to you first as 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.770
 now they will see first the first 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:36.860
 attempt to work or simply 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:39.560
 be about three meters back use the 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.750
 exoskeleton and apply directly to the 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.880
 good black platform friends now yes 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.070
 As I say, we will be suspended in 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.200
 the air so to speak and we will be 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.959
 totally immortal for all kinds of 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.119
 zombies here the men what they do is 

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:55.310
 run directly towards the wall 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:57.200
 because they can not find another way of 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.780
 of being able to kill you, not because in reality 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.670
 they do not reach you and you then here without any 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.369
 you can kill them by shooting them 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.319
 in your head and you even save bullets and the 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:08.090
 true muse that is very simple here 

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:09.739
 I'll put more takes included in the way 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.989
 well I 'm sorry all the zombies 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:13.970
 that is, no type of zombies should 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:16.370
 do no harm either the zombie 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.010
 normal the zombie nexus the zombie 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.810
 infected up 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.180
 but nobody is going to be able to do 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.280
 any damage because not only 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.680
 if it comes to occupy bullets you know you leave 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.989
 you live you buy your bullets you 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.840
 come back you go up and kill the last one and 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:33.970
 so you survive each wave without any 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.829
 problem as well go now 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.079
 to be seeing the other perspective as 

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:40.329
 you would see in this case it went up 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:43.209
 my friend destroyer if it 's up as 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:44.650
 you can see it is floating it can not 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.720
 record a lot because as they saw the 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.609
 zombies are fucking me but if the 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.560
 brass that is very cool the way that 

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:52.480
 you see not since the zombies can 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.819
 see right now they are running like weyes 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.950
 without being able to do anything or you here as 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:59.409
 if you're not going to be able to kill anything without any 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.959
 problem and good friends you could say 

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:03.940
 I discovered that clicks because 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:05.859
 it happened to me like an accident more or less 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:09.730
 about two days after this came out 

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:11.650
 tlc I would say about 30 something for 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.030
 there I am not very sure and so good 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.370
 It turns out that some men had me 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.590
 surrounded in this same place and then I 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.720
 they were sticking my only way then 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.740
 to escape trying to escape was 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:25.610
 using the exo then 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:28.610
 I used jumper and as well as random and then 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:30.770
 I fell on that platform by accident not 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:33.470
 Well, you can imagine how it was for the 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:35.300
 zombies already when I was up there but 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.490
 well maybe some wonder 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:39.050
 What is it that I did not upload them before? 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:41.900
 if there are some that are a bit 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:44.150
 Attentive to the channel, they will know that I am very 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.760
 inactive I think I'm already going for two 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:49.340
 weeks and upload a single video and then 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:52.310
 Well, this is what should be done here 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:54.890
 the truth is because I do not feel so 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:57.500
 motivated with the channel as before 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:59.780
 I did not feel the truth that I do not feel that 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.750
 motivation to be uploading very videos 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:05.330
 followed and the first reason then because 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:07.040
 it's because, as you already know, the channel 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:09.320
 is growing many thanks 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.840
 also because we are already 20,000 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:15.020
 Seriously friends do not know all how much 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:17.090
 I appreciate already 20,000 but in itself although the 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:19.250
 Subscribers are still increasing but 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:21.320
 you'll know the videos continue with the 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:23.570
 same reproductions same likes and 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:26.210
 all that is not so good because I 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:27.370
 I understand why, well, because more or 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:29.770
 less as a final 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:32.919
 November, December and early 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:35.080
 I was still super in January 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:37.660
 active in the channel will already know the ones 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:41.080
 are after that time I was 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:43.570
 uploading 3 videos per month 4 videos 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:46.840
 by noon at the most and so good 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:48.820
 so that inactivity does affect a lot 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:51.520
 because it's good like two weeks and 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:53.410
 upload a video and its day to one and so non 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.479
 it would have been fine if he was crouching 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:57.639
 inactivity and well that I know that 

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:59.380
 affects all channels when you 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:01.960
 you are inactive because there are people who 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:04.870
 through and then they forgot you do not know 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:06.669
 I could say but good friends yes 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:09.580
 I really want to make you want this 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:12.729
 of youtube since it returns that good 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:14.860
 also visits and all that not 

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:17.800
 is the only reason since there is also no 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:19.570
 to say that I'm not super-initiated 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.010
 with a new game that came out in fact 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:24.729
 it also came out the same day as this tlc 

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:26.500
 the 27th and so is the timeline the truth that 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:28.780
 It's a great game 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:30.880
 the game of zombies and so I think that already 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:33.340
 Many have to know is a great game 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:36.010
 the truth friends so well also 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:38.020
 I'm very initiated with this game and so 

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:40.090
 in my spare time I get better at 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:42.250
 play that instead of making videos but 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:44.380
 it's good and as I say, I already want 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:47.710
 change this I want to go back to 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:50.130
 do so much of what it was before 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:53.290
 upload more videos for you 

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:56.140
 because if seriously, we are no longer 

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:58.630
 Any little thing we are already 20,000 me 

00:05:56.140 --> 00:06:00.700
 I made friends many thanks in 

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:02.260
 seriously seriously seriously I remember 

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:04.630
 that my great wish was the thousand 

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:06.970
 subscribers and now that we are already 

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:09.940
 more than 20 thousand imagine how is it that I 

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:12.130
 I have to feel no and seriously I do not have 

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:14.290
 well another thing to say more than thank you 

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:16.450
 Not that I do not like them too 

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:19.290
 make a special 20 thousand subscribers 

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:22.930
 but since I still do not have much time 

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:27.370
 Well, I would like to make a special 

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:29.350
 of questions and answers so then 

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:31.300
 friends if you want to make me 

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:32.470
