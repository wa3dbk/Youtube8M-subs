this gun on the CTE to see if the
changes<00:00:09.000> to<00:00:09.150> visual<00:00:09.450> recoil<00:00:09.630> suppression<00:00:10.500> and

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
changes to visual recoil suppression and

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:11.959 
changes to visual recoil suppression and
environment<00:00:11.250> made<00:00:11.370> a<00:00:11.400> significant

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
environment made a significant

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.580

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
somewhat harder to hit this is because

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.380 
somewhat harder to hit this is because
you're<00:03:30.340> going<00:03:30.459> to<00:03:30.580> need<00:03:30.760> to<00:03:30.910> lead<00:03:31.060> them<00:03:31.239> more

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
you're going to need to lead them more

you're going to need to lead them more
but<00:03:32.020> let's<00:03:32.170> look<00:03:32.320> at<00:03:32.380> the<00:03:32.470> recoil<00:03:32.830> pattern<00:03:33.100> for

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
but let's look at the recoil pattern for

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.190 
but let's look at the recoil pattern for
the<00:03:33.310> pp-2000<00:03:34.090> it<00:03:34.209> has<00:03:34.360> a<00:03:34.390> point<00:03:34.780> to<00:03:34.930> four

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
the pp-2000 it has a point to four

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.960 
the pp-2000 it has a point to four
upwards<00:03:35.590> recoil<00:03:35.739> and<00:03:36.160> a<00:03:36.310> point<00:03:36.550> for<00:03:36.700> your<00:03:36.760> left

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
upwards recoil and a point for your left

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:38.850 
upwards recoil and a point for your left
and<00:03:37.209> a<00:03:37.270> point<00:03:37.510> to<00:03:37.660> right<00:03:37.840> the<00:03:38.440> recoil<00:03:38.800> pattern

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:38.860 
and a point to right the recoil pattern

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.440 
and a point to right the recoil pattern
for<00:03:39.220> this<00:03:39.280> gun<00:03:39.489> is<00:03:39.670> going<00:03:39.880> to<00:03:40.000> look<00:03:40.150> like<00:03:40.300> it

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
for this gun is going to look like it

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.240 
for this gun is going to look like it
goes<00:03:40.630> up<00:03:40.840> and<00:03:41.050> slightly<00:03:41.350> to<00:03:41.620> the<00:03:41.650> left

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
goes up and slightly to the left

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:43.890 
goes up and slightly to the left
to<00:03:42.610> counter<00:03:42.880> this<00:03:42.970> recoil<00:03:43.390> you'll<00:03:43.630> need<00:03:43.780> to

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
to counter this recoil you'll need to

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.360 
to counter this recoil you'll need to
pull<00:03:44.080> slightly<00:03:44.350> down<00:03:44.680> into<00:03:45.130> the

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
pull slightly down into the

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.100 
pull slightly down into the
right<00:03:45.519> but<00:03:45.879> again<00:03:46.120> the<00:03:46.360> recoil<00:03:46.690> isn't<00:03:46.900> very

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.110 
right but again the recoil isn't very

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:48.720 
right but again the recoil isn't very
strong<00:03:47.230> so<00:03:47.590> it's<00:03:47.739> not<00:03:47.860> going<00:03:48.129> to<00:03:48.220> be<00:03:48.310> much<00:03:48.489> of<00:03:48.519> a

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
strong so it's not going to be much of a

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.000 
strong so it's not going to be much of a
fight<00:03:49.000> I<00:03:49.180> found<00:03:49.720> that<00:03:49.810> the<00:03:49.900> pp-2000<00:03:50.650> is<00:03:50.709> a<00:03:50.769> very

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
fight I found that the pp-2000 is a very

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.280 
fight I found that the pp-2000 is a very
binary<00:03:51.250> weapon<00:03:51.909> it<00:03:52.269> has<00:03:52.420> great<00:03:52.690> accuracy<00:03:52.989> at

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
binary weapon it has great accuracy at

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.619 
binary weapon it has great accuracy at
mid-range<00:03:53.680> and<00:03:53.950> being<00:03:54.370> a<00:03:54.430> PDW<00:03:54.760> it<00:03:55.209> has<00:03:55.360> great

00:03:55.619 --> 00:03:55.629 
mid-range and being a PDW it has great

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:57.960 
mid-range and being a PDW it has great
hipfire<00:03:55.989> even<00:03:56.470> on<00:03:56.590> the<00:03:56.709> run<00:03:56.890> I'd<00:03:57.489> often<00:03:57.700> have

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
hipfire even on the run I'd often have

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:59.640 
hipfire even on the run I'd often have
to<00:03:58.060> switch<00:03:58.269> between<00:03:58.420> which<00:03:58.810> mentality<00:03:59.319> I<00:03:59.409> was

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
to switch between which mentality I was

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.440 
to switch between which mentality I was
in<00:03:59.830> depending<00:04:00.310> on<00:04:00.430> the<00:04:00.549> location<00:04:00.849> in<00:04:01.180> the<00:04:01.209> map

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
in depending on the location in the map

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.899 
in depending on the location in the map
80s<00:04:02.349> at<00:04:02.500> close<00:04:02.709> range<00:04:02.980> meant<00:04:03.250> I<00:04:03.370> was<00:04:03.519> slower<00:04:03.730> on

00:04:03.899 --> 00:04:03.909 
80s at close range meant I was slower on

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:05.520 
80s at close range meant I was slower on
the<00:04:03.940> draw<00:04:04.209> and<00:04:04.480> consequently<00:04:05.110> meant<00:04:05.379> I

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
the draw and consequently meant I

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.979 
the draw and consequently meant I
usually<00:04:05.829> died<00:04:06.069> alternatively<00:04:07.060> hipfire<00:04:07.569> range

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:07.989 
usually died alternatively hipfire range

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:09.509 
usually died alternatively hipfire range
is<00:04:08.200> just<00:04:08.349> not<00:04:08.560> something<00:04:08.739> you<00:04:08.950> ever<00:04:09.220> want<00:04:09.459> to

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:09.519 
is just not something you ever want to

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:11.100 
is just not something you ever want to
do<00:04:09.700> another<00:04:10.360> thing<00:04:10.599> I<00:04:10.690> found<00:04:10.810> with<00:04:10.959> this

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:11.110 
do another thing I found with this

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:13.080 
do another thing I found with this
weapon<00:04:11.470> is<00:04:11.680> if<00:04:11.860> I<00:04:11.950> reacted<00:04:12.400> at<00:04:12.549> the<00:04:12.670> same<00:04:12.849> time

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090

as<00:04:13.269> an<00:04:13.390> enemy<00:04:13.540> it<00:04:13.870> usually<00:04:14.290> come<00:04:14.470> up<00:04:14.500> in<00:04:14.829> their

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:14.210 
is why I also like to switch it up and

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:15.820 
is why I also like to switch it up and

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:17.980 
go with either a flash hider or a

pretty well then whenever possible I

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.550 
pretty well then whenever possible I

very<00:07:04.010> accurate<00:07:04.190> weapon<00:07:04.730> so<00:07:04.880> I<00:07:04.910> think<00:07:05.030> it's<00:07:05.300> one

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:05.390 
very accurate weapon so I think it's one

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:06.730 
very accurate weapon so I think it's one
of<00:07:05.450> those<00:07:05.570> weapons<00:07:05.780> it's<00:07:06.140> going<00:07:06.350> to<00:07:06.440> be<00:07:06.560> much

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:06.740 
of those weapons it's going to be much

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:08.830 
of those weapons it's going to be much
more<00:07:06.920> useful<00:07:07.070> to<00:07:07.370> newer<00:07:07.520> players<00:07:07.850> if<00:07:08.510> you<00:07:08.690> can

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:08.840 
more useful to newer players if you can

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:10.390 
more useful to newer players if you can
control<00:07:09.200> the<00:07:09.350> more<00:07:09.530> powerful<00:07:09.950> weapons<00:07:10.250> I

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:10.400 
control the more powerful weapons I

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:11.920 
control the more powerful weapons I
definitely<00:07:10.880> recommend<00:07:11.180> going<00:07:11.510> with<00:07:11.630> those

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:11.930 
definitely recommend going with those

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:14.200 
definitely recommend going with those

pp-2000 a bad weapon it's just a few

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:18.610 
pp-2000 a bad weapon it's just a few

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:18.620 
steps shy of being good I think that if

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:19.960 
steps shy of being good I think that if
the<00:07:18.710> bullet<00:07:18.860> velocity<00:07:19.370> were<00:07:19.520> higher<00:07:19.670> or

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:19.970 
the bullet velocity were higher or

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:21.220 
the bullet velocity were higher or
perhaps<00:07:20.180> the<00:07:20.450> damage<00:07:20.750> model<00:07:21.080> slightly

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:21.230 
perhaps the damage model slightly

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:22.750 
perhaps the damage model slightly
different<00:07:21.710> in<00:07:21.800> close<00:07:21.980> range<00:07:22.280> for<00:07:22.670> example

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:22.760
