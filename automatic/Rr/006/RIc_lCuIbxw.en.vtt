00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:06.390
 Welcome to the jockey Micky like 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.189
 I'm with that as a smaller today 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.040
 flats four they demand models 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.400
 or sumo cross- legged cross 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.769
 down 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.240
 we actually have a cross though 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.619
 now the camera right there 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.510
 stay and I'm with my legs 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.250
 you will continue to wander outward 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.320
 See how far I am down here now 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.910
 walk out until I see something in the picture 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.230
 it 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.820
 that means then I notice already in 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.619
 most among the largest 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.420
 difference to the conventional cross 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.460
 and that we through this 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.590
 wider was simply a lower one 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.899
 Height must cope with the weight 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.340
 what the advantage is that is the 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.469
 advantage of this exercise is that we 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.480
 just the weight less high 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.539
 and therefore for the 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.160
 Most people it is a little easier I am 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.520
 must say that to me the broad or 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.079
 sum still about the same missing 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.699
 so i'm in both 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.270
 conventional and the south cross the bin 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:59.760
 I'm pretty much the same general sector 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.699
 that we are wider than shoulder world 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.000
 put up your feet pretty far 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.350
 to point outward 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.070
 I am having a long time with it 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.570
 long legs 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.030
 usually make it similar 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.990
 develop the then super strong as 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:18.450
 Can I do the fashion but here it is 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.939
 that I have my legs here, so to speak 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.350
 outward sliding i.e. one has 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.630
 So winning has the disadvantages 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:28.049
 the one after here is that we are very much 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.600
 agility really has 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:33.900
 other realities in the lawnmower 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.360
 in the adductors of the machine in merzig 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.070
 want to bring media out to the outside 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.259
 means I'm coming down here now and 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.869
 if you come in venice appreciate it 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.030
 the chance just has to pull out 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:48.420
 which means it's almost more so a 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.610
 my stretch as I do it here 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.860
 normal cross in almost like that one 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.990
 make me squat, that I have to 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.960
 mercedes out of the squat and 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.659
 I eternally around but I am pushing 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.159
 here the ground away from me finally 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:07.399
 the residential to the outside would not have 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:10.170
 I'm facing up here because I 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:12.510
 I almost pull the rhine until I almost 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.239
 upright bikini beauty 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.290
 outward when I get it out here and 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:18.330
 if I take a little 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:39.269
 that is still the highest forward 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:41.220
 is slipping ie the solo crossing 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:45.239
 in the execution to pay attention that 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:47.069
 we do not go that far and here 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:50.480
 out but that we are more with 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:54.750
 upright upper body that we 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:58.700
 outwardly lever out with china and 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:01.200
 here is a beautiful rhine mainer 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.030
 Eliminate us in the room that we at 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.650
 upright and thereby we take 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.810
 us almost backwards and thus this 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.730
 do not take notice and pull them 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.290
 the dish over the snow and then 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:14.640
 only half come forward 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:16.380
 So rapid and relatively simple in 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.480
 compared to normal cruising 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:22.280
 we do not need so many 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.280
 possibilities oranges spice side 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:29.040
 what is there so yes we trainers 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:31.319
 of course, as well as the 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:34.230
 normal cross just the complete one 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:35.549
 backward chain and this is but 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.980
 in addition a little bit more up 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:40.920
 the adductors worked on and he has 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.849
 a little more thigh inside 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:46.319
 in the middle 

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:49.319
 contract by this driving in 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:53.659
 They think that was the sum of cross 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:53.659
 in check the other - ammonite canalis
