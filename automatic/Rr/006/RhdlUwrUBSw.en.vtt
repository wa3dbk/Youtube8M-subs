00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.319
 then a place next to sebastian 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:09.030
 vettel gets rid of whoever takes it 

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:12.630
 hard to say, you name them 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.940
 raikkonen and the two pilots red bull that 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.590
 however at this point they will have the knife 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.020
 between the teeth for the rest of the season 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.270
 because in short they will have to see who of the 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.779
 two maybe you can deserve then 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:27.539
 let's hear kimi raikkonen 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:29.519
 which I wondered if there is big enhancement 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:33.719
 been great announcement by Marco 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:37.050
 weber is about to withdraw the formula 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:42.809
 1 do you think you could take her 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:44.610
 place next year I have already answered 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.730
 this question in the last races not 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.690
 I have not made any decision with respect 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.160
 next year 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.480
 and in any case what I do have to what 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.649
 see with me here he likes you like what 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.039
 think at all that I leave forming as 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:02.609
 pilot and as a person is always done 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.680
 well in his team but I believe that anyone 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.270
 make a decision 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.520
 when he thinks the time is right 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.710
 to stop and do something else 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.920
 he probably thought about it a lot and 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:16.770
 decided to do something else 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:19.490
 would be one of three options if there is 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.990
 both the opportunity to leave lotus 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.600
 well i can do what i want because 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:28.290
 I don't have a signed contract so it's not 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.450
 a secret but as I said I don't have 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.150
 still made no decision when the 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.030
 I 'll take it I'll know 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:39.720
 he will let us know what you think he does not have 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:42.210
 said nothing but in his own way has almost 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.159
 launched an appeal he said I can 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.520
 go where I want I haven't met 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.030
 so in short it has opened the doors to red 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.759
 bull 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.530
 maybe ferrari then offer yourself something 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.200
 but that of the guide is no longer a 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.320
 seat coveted as the seat once 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.350
 this is the most coveted this one 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.330
 of 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.369
 because today it has officially announced 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:07.750
 his retirement at the end of the season from 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:10.610
 formula 1 per hour with 9 wins 203 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:14.780
 grand prizes assets 36 podiums so if 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:16.520
 a pilot who above all with the number of 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.560
 podi makes you understand that you are a great driver 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.120
 because he found himself in front of the other more 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.980
 great that took away of course 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.910
 the number of victories 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:28.370
 let's look at the candidates or rather the pilots 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.920
 which are on the market with our clip 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.720
 with work by antonio boselli a 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:35.780
 recover the data and then talk about who 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.800
 he will go to that seat because he is born 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.310
 antonini already knows 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.310
 naturally 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:57.120
 so we summarized the pilots that yes 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.860
 candidates in some way for that seat 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.500
 or rather the pilots that are on the market 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.470
 among these also felipe massa, however, the 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:07.080
 pink of the pilots that actually 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:09.630
 they can go to the occupied seat up 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.670
 at the end of the season in season 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.290
 the end day season view shooting 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:17.120
 from 98 percent 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:20.340
 the rose is restricted to who the candidates are 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.230
 we have heard kimi raikkonen before 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.150
 I say I don't have a contract now 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.870
 so I talk to whoever I want and how 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.390
 I want 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.800
 is a position statement enough 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.450
 atypical if you want for a pilot because it is 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.459
 a pilot who comes out openly to 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:36.290
 say that the team is with which 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:38.820
 he is currently not engaged 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:41.250
 nothing practically to renew it in 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:43.640
 contract is already an interesting fact 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:46.350
 me if I had to point you to a candidate 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:48.060
 model for next year's network there 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:49.440
 I would put too much kimi also because I don't 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.480
 let's forget that next year 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.970
 so many new things to try then 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.739
 when talking about a nursery pilot 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.519
 let's say red bull as ricciardo as 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:58.380
 worms etc. 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:00.330
 certainly pilots of value but with little 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.920
 experience and escape from a car 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.480
 which will be completely to stand on 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.340
 valid in completely different respect 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.500
 to those that are a pilot like 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:10.080
 raikkonen has lived a lot of the formula 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:12.150
 1 through the other grooved tires 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.920
 things that is 12 years then a foreigner 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.260
 according to me passing with telecom la 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.299
 we just hear the statements from ice 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:23.370
 man kimi raikkonen on what 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:25.919
 could be his future that I 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:30.000
 was a great announcement by 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:33.780
 mark weber is about to withdraw from 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.490
 formula 1 you could take his place 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:38.250
 spend it next year 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:41.390
 I don't know it's the same answer I have 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:41.390
 given the last races 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:45.970
 I have not yet made any decision for 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.190
 next year whatever I do 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:51.160
 do nothing to do with me 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:53.730
 like what you think of the fact that he will leave 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:56.530
 the form one as a person and as a pilot 

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:58.720
 always done well in his team 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:00.880
 I believe that everyone makes the decision 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:03.490
 when they think it's the right time 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:06.550
 to stop or do anything else and 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:08.320
 he probably thought about it for 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:09.610
 a long time and decided to do 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:12.180
 something else 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:15.160
 the red bull is one of the three options if 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:18.100
 there will be an opportunity to leave the 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:21.190
 lotus but I can do what I want 

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:25.120
 because I don't have a contract so it's not 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:26.980
 a secret but as I said I did not take 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:30.280
 no decision yet when the 

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:31.840
 I inform all take and then 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:33.550
 confirm what you already anticipate 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:35.140
 of the words of of kimi raikkonen e 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:37.530
 we have heard from him 

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:40.080
 we have said in the past that 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:42.970
 perfect the important era for 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.740
 consecrate yourself to change what you have 

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:46.450
 made schumacher and in the past pass into 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:48.760
 ferrari and pass mclaren pass in a 

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:50.500
 team that maybe to show that 

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:52.690
 those three world titles are worth perhaps 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:54.520
 four in the end this season can 

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:57.490
 also be worth the speech to get of 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:06:00.100
 alongside a kimi raikkonen to show 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:01.930
 to really be the number one you can 

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:04.270
 be worth the talk change team or 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:05.200
 change tv company and obvious that 

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:06.610
 weber 

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:08.050
 with all due respect to what he has 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:10.510
 made in career but the last 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:12.250
 let's say year and a half or maybe 

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:14.920
 especially since he lost that 

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:16.300
 maybe 2010 for a breath for some 

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:17.770
 physical problems is no longer the same 

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:19.620
 person not driving that the same 

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:21.780
 in the same way 

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:24.000
 surely the car was 

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:25.560
 developed more around the style of 

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.600
 guide to sebastan slice than to his 

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:29.970
 therefore ever increasing difficulties ad 

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:32.160
 to adapt and the rest we have to see 

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:34.949
 where is weber today in the ranking ie is it 

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:37.350
 behind alonso hamilton and so it is 

00:06:34.949 --> 00:06:38.940
 obvious that it is interesting to compare 

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:41.070
 see where another could come 

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:43.620
 More motivated driver I don't say younger 

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:46.080
 because there are 33 years in a kimi 

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:48.270
 raikkonen web but still with others 

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:49.770
 motivations and facing the 

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:51.889
 relay too perfect and the stimulus 

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:51.889
 different
