right there were some awesome skills

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.100 
right there were some awesome skills
really<00:02:13.040> really<00:02:13.370> good<00:02:13.550> lines<00:02:14.420> of<00:02:14.600> running<00:02:14.870> or

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
really really good lines of running or

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:16.930 
really really good lines of running or
flooding<00:02:15.620> in<00:02:15.680> the<00:02:15.770> tackle<00:02:16.010> really<00:02:16.820> really

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
flooding in the tackle really really

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.310 
flooding in the tackle really really
clever<00:02:17.210> stuff<00:02:17.540> and<00:02:17.690> I'm<00:02:17.780> told<00:02:17.990> that<00:02:18.110> the

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:18.320 
clever stuff and I'm told that the

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.530 
clever stuff and I'm told that the
bishops<00:02:19.070> Paul<00:02:19.280> Jim<00:02:19.490> game<00:02:19.670> was<00:02:19.850> something<00:02:20.360> to

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
bishops Paul Jim game was something to

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.810 
bishops Paul Jim game was something to
behold<00:02:20.690> five<00:02:21.560> tries<00:02:21.860> at<00:02:22.010> peace<00:02:22.250> one<00:02:22.610> in<00:02:22.730> the

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:22.820 
behold five tries at peace one in the

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.690 
behold five tries at peace one in the
final<00:02:23.150> second<00:02:23.540> you<00:02:24.080> know<00:02:24.200> so<00:02:24.410> I<00:02:24.680> think<00:02:25.250> that<00:02:25.580> we

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
final second you know so I think that we

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.790 
final second you know so I think that we
have<00:02:25.880> the<00:02:26.000> ability<00:02:26.390> we<00:02:26.510> have<00:02:26.720> the<00:02:26.870> skills<00:02:27.200> but

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
have the ability we have the skills but

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.410 
have the ability we have the skills but
are<00:02:28.010> we<00:02:28.100> perhaps<00:02:28.490> just<00:02:28.700> catching<00:02:29.150> them<00:02:29.240> out<00:02:29.390> of

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
are we perhaps just catching them out of

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.270 
are we perhaps just catching them out of
the<00:02:29.600> players<00:02:29.930> as<00:02:30.200> we<00:02:30.320> take<00:02:30.530> them<00:02:30.650> into<00:02:30.800> a<00:02:30.920> more

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
the players as we take them into a more

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.670 
the players as we take them into a more
sort<00:02:31.820> of<00:02:31.880> senior<00:02:32.209> level<00:02:32.510> and<00:02:33.230> I<00:02:33.290> think<00:02:33.530> that

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
sort of senior level and I think that

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.260 
sort of senior level and I think that
probably<00:02:33.860> is<00:02:34.100> the<00:02:34.220> case<00:02:34.400> yeah<00:02:34.670> I<00:02:34.700> think<00:02:35.030> one

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
probably is the case yeah I think one

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:36.550 
probably is the case yeah I think one
key<00:02:35.480> set<00:02:35.720> that's<00:02:35.900> missing<00:02:36.200> from<00:02:36.230> here<00:02:36.440> is

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
key set that's missing from here is

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.440 
key set that's missing from here is
probably<00:02:36.830> also<00:02:37.040> missing<00:02:37.490> from<00:02:37.640> those<00:02:37.790> high

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
probably also missing from those high

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.180 
probably also missing from those high
school<00:02:38.720> games<00:02:38.930> is<00:02:39.200> the<00:02:39.380> quality<00:02:39.560> of<00:02:39.800> defense

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
school games is the quality of defense

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:41.740 
school games is the quality of defense
there<00:02:40.340> were<00:02:40.400> 55<00:02:40.850> missed<00:02:41.150> tackles<00:02:41.510> in<00:02:41.600> that

missing tackles but you know when the

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
tackles are solid and the defense is

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:52.660 
tackles are solid and the defense is
type<00:02:51.709> then<00:02:51.890> it's<00:02:52.010> tough<00:02:52.160> to<00:02:52.310> break<00:02:52.430> through

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
type then it's tough to break through

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.340 
type then it's tough to break through
you're<00:02:53.060> completely<00:02:53.239> and<00:02:53.630> you<00:02:53.840> know<00:02:53.959> it's

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
you're completely and you know it's

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:55.780 
you're completely and you know it's
difficult<00:02:54.620> to<00:02:54.860> argue<00:02:55.010> against<00:02:55.310> that<00:02:55.370> we<00:02:55.610> spoke

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
difficult to argue against that we spoke

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.280 
difficult to argue against that we spoke
last<00:02:55.910> week<00:02:56.150> about<00:02:56.330> the<00:02:56.480> wall<00:02:56.750> of<00:02:56.930> kept<00:02:57.140> on

there<00:03:07.040> yeah<00:03:07.489> sure<00:03:07.760> I<00:03:07.790> mean<00:03:07.940> there<00:03:08.180> were<00:03:08.239> a

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:08.270 
there yeah sure I mean there were a

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:10.030 
there yeah sure I mean there were a
couple<00:03:08.360> of<00:03:08.570> missed<00:03:08.750> tackles<00:03:08.810> but<00:03:09.620> they<00:03:09.830> just

have the ability to break tackles so

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:13.300 
have the ability to break tackles so
it's<00:03:12.170> offloading<00:03:12.680> and<00:03:12.860> they<00:03:13.010> got<00:03:13.130> people

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
it's offloading and they got people

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.190 
it's offloading and they got people
running<00:03:13.550> you<00:03:13.820> multiple<00:03:14.480> people<00:03:14.810> running<00:03:15.080> off

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
running you multiple people running off

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.660 
running you multiple people running off
one<00:03:15.410> player<00:03:15.680> so<00:03:16.220> that<00:03:16.340> you<00:03:16.489> know<00:03:16.580> the

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
one player so that you know the

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.130 
one player so that you know the
defendant<00:03:16.910> doesn't<00:03:17.180> know<00:03:17.299> where<00:03:17.420> to<00:03:17.450> go<00:03:17.630> so<00:03:17.930> I

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
defendant doesn't know where to go so I

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:19.750 
defendant doesn't know where to go so I
think<00:03:18.320> you<00:03:18.920> know<00:03:18.950> the<00:03:19.190> fact<00:03:19.400> that<00:03:19.459> they<00:03:19.580> put

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
think you know the fact that they put

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.970 
think you know the fact that they put
such<00:03:20.030> a<00:03:20.060> good<00:03:20.330> attacking<00:03:20.630> game<00:03:20.959> also<00:03:21.530> you<00:03:21.860> know

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
such a good attacking game also you know

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:23.949 
such a good attacking game also you know
speech<00:03:22.910> the<00:03:23.060> fact<00:03:23.269> that<00:03:23.330> that's<00:03:23.540> why<00:03:23.690> we<00:03:23.810> miss

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 
speech the fact that that's why we miss

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:25.240 
speech the fact that that's why we miss
more<00:03:24.140> tackles<00:03:24.440> against<00:03:24.769> it<00:03:24.860> yeah<00:03:25.070> I<00:03:25.100> think

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
more tackles against it yeah I think

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:26.949 
more tackles against it yeah I think
Marquis<00:03:26.030> and<00:03:26.209> got<00:03:26.330> a<00:03:26.360> spot<00:03:26.630> on<00:03:26.660> a<00:03:26.810> news

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
Marquis and got a spot on a news

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:28.539 
Marquis and got a spot on a news
business<00:03:27.170> day<00:03:27.410> column<00:03:27.709> this<00:03:27.830> week<00:03:27.980> he<00:03:28.459> was

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:28.549 
business day column this week he was

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:30.039 
business day column this week he was
talking<00:03:28.820> about<00:03:28.850> the<00:03:29.120> quality<00:03:29.480> of<00:03:29.510> coaches<00:03:29.959> in

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:30.049 
talking about the quality of coaches in

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:31.600 
talking about the quality of coaches in
south<00:03:30.200> africa<00:03:30.320> vs<00:03:30.860> the<00:03:30.950> quality<00:03:31.280> of<00:03:31.310> players

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
south africa vs the quality of players

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.280 
south africa vs the quality of players
and<00:03:31.880> essentially<00:03:32.660> the<00:03:32.840> point<00:03:33.019> that<00:03:33.080> he<00:03:33.140> was

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
and essentially the point that he was

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:34.990 
and essentially the point that he was
making<00:03:33.590> was<00:03:33.680> that<00:03:33.739> nobody<00:03:34.340> there's<00:03:34.730> no<00:03:34.850> demand

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000 
making was that nobody there's no demand

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.850 
making was that nobody there's no demand
for<00:03:35.269> our<00:03:35.390> current<00:03:36.080> super<00:03:36.350> rugby<00:03:36.560> coaches

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:36.860 
for our current super rugby coaches

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:37.990 
for our current super rugby coaches
overseas<00:03:37.190> but<00:03:37.340> there's<00:03:37.519> plenty<00:03:37.640> of<00:03:37.850> demand

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
overseas but there's plenty of demand

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.759 
overseas but there's plenty of demand
for<00:03:38.239> our<00:03:38.269> top<00:03:38.480> players<00:03:38.720> and<00:03:38.989> that<00:03:39.019> speaks<00:03:39.650> to

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:39.769 
for our top players and that speaks to

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:42.069 
for our top players and that speaks to
maybe<00:03:40.010> a<00:03:40.130> lack<00:03:40.340> of<00:03:40.370> quality<00:03:41.090> coaches<00:03:41.600> yeah<00:03:42.049> I

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:42.079 
maybe a lack of quality coaches yeah I

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:43.870 
maybe a lack of quality coaches yeah I
must<00:03:42.380> say<00:03:42.440> I<00:03:42.470> read<00:03:42.590> the<00:03:42.680> column<00:03:42.829> here<00:03:43.579> and<00:03:43.790> it

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:43.880 
must say I read the column here and it

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.310 
must say I read the column here and it
pretty<00:03:44.209> does<00:03:44.420> get<00:03:44.570> it<00:03:44.660> right<00:03:44.810> or<00:03:44.840> not<00:03:44.989> you<00:03:45.230> know

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:45.320 
pretty does get it right or not you know

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.699 
pretty does get it right or not you know
I<00:03:45.350> just<00:03:45.440> wonder<00:03:46.540> what's<00:03:47.540> our<00:03:47.660> mindset<00:03:48.140> you

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:48.709 
I just wonder what's our mindset you

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:50.350 
I just wonder what's our mindset you
know<00:03:48.829> I<00:03:48.860> think<00:03:49.040> so<00:03:49.400> Sydney<00:03:49.790> New<00:03:49.940> Zealand<00:03:50.209> that

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 
know I think so Sydney New Zealand that

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.060 
know I think so Sydney New Zealand that
the<00:03:50.450> young<00:03:50.720> guys<00:03:50.900> are<00:03:51.049> coached<00:03:51.290> to<00:03:51.650> entertain

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:52.070 
the young guys are coached to entertain

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:53.410 
the young guys are coached to entertain
yeah<00:03:52.370> they<00:03:52.610> were<00:03:52.760> they<00:03:52.880> want<00:03:53.060> people<00:03:53.269> to<00:03:53.329> come

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
yeah they were they want people to come

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:54.370 
yeah they were they want people to come
and<00:03:53.480> watch<00:03:53.690> the<00:03:53.720> game<00:03:53.900> they<00:03:54.200> want<00:03:54.320> to

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.380 
and watch the game they want to

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:55.870 
and watch the game they want to
entertain<00:03:54.590> them<00:03:54.890> and<00:03:54.920> I<00:03:55.100> think<00:03:55.310> in<00:03:55.549> South

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:55.880 
entertain them and I think in South

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.090 
entertain them and I think in South
Africa<00:03:56.180> we<00:03:56.269> play<00:03:56.450> to<00:03:56.510> win<00:03:56.750> and<00:03:56.900> perhaps<00:03:57.590> that's

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.100 
Africa we play to win and perhaps that's

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:59.890 
Africa we play to win and perhaps that's
also<00:03:58.640> permeates<00:03:59.060> into<00:03:59.209> the<00:03:59.299> coaching<00:03:59.660> months

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
also permeates into the coaching months

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.390 
also permeates into the coaching months
it<00:04:00.019> so<00:04:00.140> these<00:04:00.260> guys<00:04:00.440> are<00:04:00.500> scared<00:04:00.890> they<00:04:01.190> want<00:04:01.220> to

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
it so these guys are scared they want to

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:02.890 
it so these guys are scared they want to
keep<00:04:01.489> their<00:04:01.670> jobs<00:04:01.940> and<00:04:02.120> they're<00:04:02.420> playing<00:04:02.660> to

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
keep their jobs and they're playing to

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.210 
keep their jobs and they're playing to
win<00:04:03.049> they<00:04:03.200> playing<00:04:03.440> with<00:04:03.560> a<00:04:03.590> fluff<00:04:03.829> is<00:04:04.100> just

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
win they playing with a fluff is just

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:05.350 
win they playing with a fluff is just
going<00:04:04.310> to<00:04:04.400> kick<00:04:04.519> the<00:04:04.640> dumb<00:04:04.790> poles<00:04:04.970> of<00:04:05.090> a<00:04:05.150> ball

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.360 
going to kick the dumb poles of a ball

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.479 
going to kick the dumb poles of a ball
can<00:04:05.870> have<00:04:05.989> a<00:04:06.049> wing<00:04:06.620> chasing<00:04:07.040> it<00:04:07.130> instead<00:04:07.430> of

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:07.489 
can have a wing chasing it instead of

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:09.250 
can have a wing chasing it instead of
playing<00:04:07.790> to<00:04:07.970> entertain<00:04:08.360> and<00:04:08.570> perhaps<00:04:08.660> that's

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
playing to entertain and perhaps that's

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:10.870 
playing to entertain and perhaps that's
what's<00:04:09.530> happened<00:04:09.799> we've<00:04:10.280> also<00:04:10.430> got<00:04:10.610> to<00:04:10.700> play

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:10.880 
what's happened we've also got to play

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.100 
what's happened we've also got to play
through<00:04:11.120> of<00:04:11.180> players<00:04:11.480> in<00:04:11.690> this<00:04:11.780> country

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:12.110 
through of players in this country

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:14.110 
through of players in this country
compared<00:04:12.440> to<00:04:12.530> other<00:04:12.680> nations<00:04:13.250> like<00:04:13.579> Australia

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 
compared to other nations like Australia

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.160 
compared to other nations like Australia
and<00:04:14.209> New<00:04:14.239> Zealand<00:04:14.299> obviously<00:04:14.810> got<00:04:14.930> a<00:04:14.959> small

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.170 
and New Zealand obviously got a small

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.140 
and New Zealand obviously got a small
population<00:04:15.799> I<00:04:15.920> think<00:04:16.400> in<00:04:16.489> South<00:04:16.640> Africa<00:04:16.970> a<00:04:17.000> lot

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150 
population I think in South Africa a lot

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:18.610 
population I think in South Africa a lot
of<00:04:17.239> coaches<00:04:17.570> are<00:04:17.690> most<00:04:17.900> electors<00:04:18.350> in<00:04:18.380> there

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
of coaches are most electors in there

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.560 
of coaches are most electors in there
are<00:04:18.709> coaches<00:04:19.190> so<00:04:19.729> essentially<00:04:20.180> tank<00:04:20.419> if<00:04:20.510> you

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570 
are coaches so essentially tank if you

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:21.760 
are coaches so essentially tank if you
don't<00:04:20.750> get<00:04:20.810> the<00:04:20.930> job<00:04:21.049> done<00:04:21.109> they<00:04:21.560> check<00:04:21.739> you

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:21.770 
don't get the job done they check you

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:23.260 
don't get the job done they check you
out<00:04:21.890> bring<00:04:22.190> the<00:04:22.220> next<00:04:22.460> guy<00:04:22.580> in<00:04:22.640> we<00:04:23.150> as<00:04:23.210> in

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
out bring the next guy in we as in

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:24.340 
out bring the next guy in we as in
Australia<00:04:23.720> you<00:04:23.990> the<00:04:24.110> only

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:24.350 
Australia you the only

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:26.950 
Australia you the only
prop<00:04:24.470> available<00:04:25.120> yeah<00:04:26.120> true<00:04:26.390> and<00:04:26.660> you<00:04:26.930> know

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
prop available yeah true and you know

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.480 
prop available yeah true and you know
perhaps<00:04:27.470> that<00:04:27.530> is<00:04:27.680> to<00:04:27.830> our<00:04:27.920> detriment<00:04:28.040> we<00:04:28.370> know
