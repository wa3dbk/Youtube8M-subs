coolest thing about this makes it stand

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.360 
coolest thing about this makes it stand
alone<00:00:34.330> from<00:00:34.660> all<00:00:34.840> the<00:00:34.989> other<00:00:35.170> pedal<00:00:36.100> boards

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:36.370 
alone from all the other pedal boards

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.430 
alone from all the other pedal boards
and<00:00:36.520> amp<00:00:36.670> simulators<00:00:37.270> out<00:00:37.720> there<00:00:37.960> is<00:00:38.080> it's<00:00:38.260> got

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:38.440 
and amp simulators out there is it's got

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.310 
and amp simulators out there is it's got
a<00:00:38.470> 12<00:00:39.160> ax7<00:00:39.309> preamp<00:00:40.180> tube<00:00:40.390> in<00:00:40.540> it<00:00:40.690> so<00:00:41.230> you're

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:41.320 
a 12 ax7 preamp tube in it so you're

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.439 
a 12 ax7 preamp tube in it so you're
actually<00:00:41.590> getting<00:00:41.980> amp<00:00:42.430> sound<00:00:42.940> from<00:00:43.330> this

00:00:43.439 --> 00:00:43.449 
actually getting amp sound from this

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:46.350 
actually getting amp sound from this
pedal<00:00:43.840> board<00:00:44.050> also<00:00:44.410> what<00:00:44.830> they've<00:00:44.980> done<00:00:45.360> put

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:46.360 
pedal board also what they've done put

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.080 
pedal board also what they've done put
together<00:00:46.510> an<00:00:46.780> actual<00:00:47.170> low<00:00:47.440> wattage<00:00:47.730> power<00:00:48.730> amp

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:51.910 
section with an output transformer

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.150 
section with an output transformer
virtual<00:00:52.300> output<00:00:52.660> transformer<00:00:53.290> and<00:00:53.610> a<00:00:55.020> speaker

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
virtual output transformer and a speaker

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.770 
virtual output transformer and a speaker
simulator<00:00:57.160> as<00:00:57.430> well<00:00:57.790> so<00:00:58.210> what<00:00:58.510> you're<00:00:58.629> getting

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:58.780 
simulator as well so what you're getting

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.990 
simulator as well so what you're getting
is<00:00:59.050> from<00:00:59.320> the<00:00:59.440> tail<00:00:59.829> end<00:01:00.100> of<00:01:00.219> the<00:01:00.370> output<00:01:00.820> is

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000 
is from the tail end of the output is

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.119 
is from the tail end of the output is
the<00:01:01.750> sound<00:01:02.020> that<00:01:02.110> you<00:01:02.230> would<00:01:02.350> get<00:01:02.559> from<00:01:03.100> the

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:03.129 
the sound that you would get from the

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:08.279 
the sound that you would get from the
tail<00:01:03.399> end<00:01:03.579> of<00:01:03.610> an<00:01:03.730> actual<00:01:06.030> valve<00:01:07.030> amp<00:01:07.450> tube<00:01:08.050> and

00:01:08.279 --> 00:01:08.289 
tail end of an actual valve amp tube and

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:10.680 
tail end of an actual valve amp tube and
so<00:01:09.190> that<00:01:09.700> really<00:01:09.820> makes<00:01:10.090> it<00:01:10.210> stand<00:01:10.360> out<00:01:10.630> from

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:10.690 
so that really makes it stand out from

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:12.240 
so that really makes it stand out from
all<00:01:10.990> the<00:01:11.110> other<00:01:11.229> pedals<00:01:11.590> it's<00:01:11.740> a<00:01:11.830> pretty<00:01:12.039> cool

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 
all the other pedals it's a pretty cool

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:13.859 
all the other pedals it's a pretty cool
thing<00:01:12.310> and<00:01:12.729> I<00:01:12.850> can<00:01:13.030> hear<00:01:13.119> the<00:01:13.270> difference<00:01:13.630> you

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:13.869 
thing and I can hear the difference you

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:15.300 
thing and I can hear the difference you
can<00:01:13.990> really<00:01:14.229> it<00:01:14.410> really<00:01:14.590> sounds<00:01:14.950> like<00:01:14.979> a<00:01:15.070> tube

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
can really it really sounds like a tube

it's<00:01:26.170> also<00:01:26.320> got<00:01:26.590> an<00:01:26.680> expression<00:01:27.189> pedal<00:01:27.220> on<00:01:27.580> it

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:27.729 
it's also got an expression pedal on it

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:30.060 
it's also got an expression pedal on it
which<00:01:27.970> you<00:01:28.119> can<00:01:28.299> use<00:01:28.510> as<00:01:28.750> volume<00:01:29.409> wall<00:01:29.710> or<00:01:29.979> you

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 
which you can use as volume wall or you

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:31.940 
which you can use as volume wall or you
can<00:01:30.189> also<00:01:30.369> assign<00:01:30.760> it<00:01:30.939> to<00:01:30.970> one<00:01:31.090> of<00:01:31.240> the<00:01:31.420> effects

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
can also assign it to one of the effects

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.609 
can also assign it to one of the effects
within<00:01:32.950> the<00:01:33.729> board<00:01:34.030> and<00:01:34.330> control<00:01:35.320> it<00:01:35.439> from<00:01:35.530> the

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:35.619 
within the board and control it from the

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:38.460 
within the board and control it from the
pedal<00:01:35.979> very<00:01:36.369> cool<00:01:36.689> so<00:01:37.689> we<00:01:37.810> had<00:01:37.930> that<00:01:38.110> intro

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
pedal very cool so we had that intro

pedal very cool so we had that intro
sound<00:01:38.799> at<00:01:38.979> the<00:01:39.070> beginning<00:01:39.520> that<00:01:39.720> was<00:01:40.720> a

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
sound at the beginning that was a

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.230 
sound at the beginning that was a
traditional<00:01:42.070> Vox<00:01:42.340> kind<00:01:42.670> of<00:01:42.729> tone<00:01:42.909> which<00:01:43.119> is

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
traditional Vox kind of tone which is

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.490 
traditional Vox kind of tone which is
really<00:01:43.479> cool<00:01:43.600> I'll<00:01:43.810> give<00:01:43.960> you<00:01:44.049> a<00:01:44.140> clean

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:57.120 

factories

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.420 

nice<00:01:58.130> clean<00:01:59.200> move<00:02:00.200> on<00:02:00.320> over<00:02:00.500> to<00:02:00.590> a<00:02:00.710> more<00:02:00.950> modern

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 
nice clean move on over to a more modern

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.120 
nice clean move on over to a more modern
kind<00:02:01.670> of<00:02:01.789> distorting<00:02:02.360> tone<00:02:02.680> this<00:02:03.680> is<00:02:03.860> a<00:02:03.890> great

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
kind of distorting tone this is a great

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:12.170 
kind of distorting tone this is a great
sound

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.759 

let's<00:02:13.180> use<00:02:13.390> the<00:02:13.510> pedal<00:02:13.870> just<00:02:14.050> straight<00:02:14.620> out<00:02:14.739> of

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:14.769 
let's use the pedal just straight out of

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:27.680 
let's use the pedal just straight out of
the<00:02:14.890> box<00:02:15.959> there's<00:02:16.959> our<00:02:17.110> volume

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.940 

another<00:02:28.690> cool<00:02:28.930> feature<00:02:28.989> about<00:02:29.290> the<00:02:29.560> pedal<00:02:29.890> is

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
another cool feature about the pedal is

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.339 
another cool feature about the pedal is
you<00:02:30.040> can<00:02:30.160> assign<00:02:30.519> it<00:02:30.700> to<00:02:30.730> an<00:02:30.940> effect<00:02:31.330> so<00:02:32.230> I'll

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:32.349 
you can assign it to an effect so I'll

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:33.539 
you can assign it to an effect so I'll
give<00:02:32.470> you<00:02:32.560> a<00:02:32.590> demonstration<00:02:32.769> of<00:02:33.220> that<00:02:33.400> right

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:33.549 
give you a demonstration of that right

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:34.470 
give you a demonstration of that right
now<00:02:33.700> we're<00:02:33.819> going<00:02:33.910> to<00:02:34.000> use<00:02:34.090> the<00:02:34.269> pitch

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
now we're going to use the pitch

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:40.410 
now we're going to use the pitch
