probably the biggest challenges to have

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:04.209 
probably the biggest challenges to have
plus<00:05:59.430> of<00:05:59.639> course<00:05:59.669> it's<00:06:00.060> the<00:06:02.719> maintenance

00:06:04.209 --> 00:06:04.219 
plus of course it's the maintenance

00:06:04.219 --> 00:06:08.510 
plus of course it's the maintenance
cleaning<00:06:05.219> and<00:06:05.990> scouring<00:06:06.990> and<00:06:07.529> disinfecting

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:09.930 
and whatnot which is very important with

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:13.540 
and whatnot which is very important with
cats<00:06:10.199> because<00:06:10.500> they<00:06:11.129> can<00:06:11.339> pass<00:06:11.639> diseases<00:06:12.330> or

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:13.550 
cats because they can pass diseases or

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:17.059 
cats because they can pass diseases or
illnesses<00:06:14.550> along<00:06:15.300> very<00:06:15.599> easily<00:06:15.870> so<00:06:16.080> that's<00:06:16.710> a

00:06:17.059 --> 00:06:17.069 
illnesses along very easily so that's a

00:06:17.069 --> 00:06:21.830 
illnesses along very easily so that's a
big<00:06:17.520> challenge

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:26.040
