00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:06.680
 nogales dear exact geeks there are 

00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:09.709
 more youtubers welcome to this new 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:13.190
 video and good in this video we will see 

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:15.829
 the google theme update that 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:18.410
 I had promised them a while ago 

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:20.599
 for those who do not know for example how 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:24.619
 the extension that we are going to 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:28.490
 occupy or the subject how to install the theme 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:31.730
 that I have in this very moment because 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:35.060
 I recommend that you watch the video I made 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:37.760
 a while ago where is this topic but 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:40.880
 Well, a little simpler, there is not 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:43.250
 where I teach you how to install the theme 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.650
 install the extension among many other 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.240
 things and if not wrong I'm wrong it only lasts 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:49.250
 two minutes so you will not lose 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:53.390
 a lot of good time without further ado 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:55.730
 Well, let's start the review, not me / 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:58.310
 let's say this my topic I wanted to divide into 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:02.230
 sections as you can see this is a 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:02.230
 let's say from here on 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.690
 random from here is these icons 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.910
 that you see here are in quotes random 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.890
 because then for example we have the 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:13.990
 new tab if you want a tab 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.510
 normal normal broker if the 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.160
 topic neither the extension nor anything we have the 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:21.330
 wikileaks page that is a page 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:24.180
 where you will find information about your 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.770
 animes series favorite videogames 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.860
 we have the problem is this 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:32.530
 obviously does not need description 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.240
 we have in my channel of titled meetings 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.740
 click here to send directly to my channel 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.590
 and if you click here it will send you 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.840
 direct to my facebook page for another 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:44.530
 side we have the page of nimega buster 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:47.890
 where you can find this then reviews 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:50.830
 criticism and exclusive content that does not 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.210
 went up to the anime channel this for the 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.880
 that do not know the anime channel spend 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:57.009
 that good up to this point I doubt a 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:00.610
 little I will leave the link in the 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:02.830
 description then we have this then in 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.660
 the chrome web store that is where we get 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.340
 the application and we have many 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:09.340
 more applications 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:13.830
 double soon from here let's say 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.830
 which starts the social media section 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.769
 here we have for example facebook which is 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:25.680
 what people most use twitter 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:28.230
 which is the second social network that 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.549
 people used us they had to give for 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.409
 the artists who want to upload their 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:34.980
 creations to this page is very good 

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:37.079
 in case you did not know her, in fact I tumblr 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:40.760
 I do not occupy tumblr but I imagine that 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:45.629
 someone from the public should occupy it 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:49.500
 gmail and youtube we also have this to 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:52.769
 nick and this one is here they send you and q but 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:55.739
 and here we have the anime section where 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:58.349
 I put pages to watch anime online I put 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:00.209
 the ones that I visit and the ones I have 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:03.209
 understood are the ones that most visit the 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:07.200
 otakus that would be anime and the king 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:09.049
 anime and crunch and roll the latter if not 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.040
 wrong I'm wrong you have to pay a 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:16.780
 monthly payment 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:19.120
 the truth I put it because this page to 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:22.269
 be paying money to watch the anime 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.730
 you are supporting the creators is not it 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:26.769
 that I understand the following 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.010
 page that we have is in itself anime 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:33.609
 page that I visited a lot around the 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:38.439
 2011-2012 this page is a forum where 

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:40.720
 you can share your opinions about 

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:43.269
 of animes of any kind you can 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.439
 find this editors that can you 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:47.079
 do an edition for example of a 

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:49.180
 banner among many other things is 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:52.650
 similar to a social network but not so much 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:55.560
 it's more a forum than anything else 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.000
 the next section is the section of 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.250
 sleeves 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:03.510
 they are pages, as their name says 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:05.430
 where you can read manga on line use 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:08.820
 his sleeve that is the page that more 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:12.240
 people read and another page that I put are 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:15.240
 sleeves h of this page almost nobody the 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:19.320
 you know but at least I recommend it 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:20.850
 a lot because the sleeves load fast not 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.040
 you have to for example click on 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:25.740
 next and wait for the page to 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:27.390
 Load the page you are already loaded that 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.220
 is what I like because sometimes I 

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:31.860
 a little bit of being click on 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:36.900
 next and wait for the page to 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:39.990
 load good and the last section then 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:42.150
 this is the video game section where 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:45.120
 I put the steam page for those who do not 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:47.070
 you know steam I do not think 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:50.689
 is a page where you can buy 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:52.549
 games legally 

00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:55.909
 as if you buy it in any store 

00:04:52.549 --> 00:04:57.469
 only that online in fact I have I have 

00:04:55.909 --> 00:05:00.360
 many games bought there really 

00:04:57.469 --> 00:05:02.099
 I recommend they are very cheap 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:05.009
 and then I'll make a video about a 

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:07.139
 important update that did the 

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:09.659
 Next page is a Spanish page 

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:12.389
 it's called brutal where you can find 

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:15.419
 this humorous news curiosities 

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:18.090
 etcetera are more than anything memes of those 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:21.330
 just funny and highly recommend it 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:24.629
 last page is atomics point oldness 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:26.370
 I think this page is the same as Spanish and 

00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:29.409
 is a page where you can find 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:31.209
 news about videogames 

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:33.279
 the truth I think the subject is 

00:05:31.209 --> 00:05:35.830
 much more complete than the first 

00:05:33.279 --> 00:05:38.529
 version I like and I hope 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:41.800
 you also like I will leave you the 

00:05:38.529 --> 00:05:45.879
 file to put all this to put 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:47.919
 the subject in the description well this 

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:48.479
 I would be everything I hope you liked the 

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:51.249
 video 

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:53.649
 remember that they help me a lot if I 

00:05:51.249 --> 00:05:56.319
 they like it because that's how I know if they like the 

00:05:53.649 --> 00:05:59.110
 content that I'm uploading and if it comes out 

00:05:56.319 --> 00:06:02.860
