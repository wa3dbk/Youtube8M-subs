binary subtraction this is found on page
136<00:00:04.680> in<00:00:05.160> your<00:00:05.310> book<00:00:06.140> let's<00:00:07.140> take<00:00:07.379> let's<00:00:08.250> take<00:00:08.429> a

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
136 in your book let's take let's take a

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:18.550 
136 in your book let's take let's take a
decimal<00:00:08.910> number<00:00:09.230> like<00:00:12.080> 130<00:00:13.490> -<00:00:14.839> we'll<00:00:15.839> take<00:00:16.220> 29

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:18.560 
decimal number like 130 - we'll take 29

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.260 
decimal number like 130 - we'll take 29
now<00:00:19.560> these<00:00:19.710> are<00:00:19.859> base<00:00:20.070> 10<00:00:20.520> numbers<00:00:20.939> like<00:00:21.150> we

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
now these are base 10 numbers like we

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.490 
now these are base 10 numbers like we
use<00:00:21.420> in<00:00:21.539> our<00:00:21.630> everyday<00:00:21.869> lives<00:00:23.539> 0-9<00:00:24.539> you<00:00:25.380> know

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
use in our everyday lives 0-9 you know

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.320 
use in our everyday lives 0-9 you know
that<00:00:25.680> we<00:00:25.769> can't<00:00:26.010> do<00:00:26.130> that<00:00:26.310> so<00:00:26.670> what<00:00:26.820> we<00:00:26.849> do<00:00:27.090> is

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
that we can't do that so what we do is

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.700 
that we can't do that so what we do is
we<00:00:27.570> borrow<00:00:27.990> from<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.590> 3<00:00:28.980> this<00:00:29.730> becomes<00:00:30.150> a<00:00:30.269> to

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:30.710 
we borrow from the 3 this becomes a to

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.370 
we borrow from the 3 this becomes a to
the<00:00:31.710> 0<00:00:32.040> becomes<00:00:32.279> what<00:00:32.610> well<00:00:33.600> you<00:00:33.960> know<00:00:33.989> that<00:00:34.290> it

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
the 0 becomes what well you know that it

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.940 
the 0 becomes what well you know that it
becomes<00:00:34.649> a<00:00:34.800> 10<00:00:35.360> you<00:00:36.360> see<00:00:36.570> we<00:00:36.750> do<00:00:36.960> in<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.649> base

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
becomes a 10 you see we do in the base

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.479 
becomes a 10 you see we do in the base
10<00:00:38.370> memory<00:00:38.730> system<00:00:39.149> which<00:00:39.780> means<00:00:40.050> each<00:00:40.489> place

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
10 memory system which means each place

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.410 
10 memory system which means each place
we<00:00:41.910> move<00:00:42.210> as<00:00:42.450> a<00:00:42.570> factor<00:00:43.050> of<00:00:43.079> 10<00:00:43.760> so<00:00:44.760> if<00:00:44.879> I<00:00:45.000> borrow

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
we move as a factor of 10 so if I borrow

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.810 
we move as a factor of 10 so if I borrow
a<00:00:45.660> factor<00:00:46.230> of<00:00:46.260> kin<00:00:46.590> from<00:00:46.860> this<00:00:47.039> position<00:00:47.280> it

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
a factor of kin from this position it

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.750 
a factor of kin from this position it
drops<00:00:48.300> a<00:00:48.510> factor<00:00:48.899> of<00:00:48.930> 10<00:00:49.200> to<00:00:49.379> 2<00:00:49.649> then<00:00:50.550> this

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
drops a factor of 10 to 2 then this

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.450 
drops a factor of 10 to 2 then this
increases<00:00:51.420> by<00:00:51.539> a<00:00:51.570> factor<00:00:51.600> of<00:00:52.050> 10<00:00:52.320> so<00:00:52.800> 10<00:00:52.829> minus

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
increases by a factor of 10 so 10 minus

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.920 
increases by a factor of 10 so 10 minus
9<00:00:53.489> now<00:00:53.879> becomes<00:00:54.180> a<00:00:54.300> 1<00:00:54.920> 2<00:00:55.920> minus<00:00:56.309> 2<00:00:56.579> is<00:00:56.610> a<00:00:56.820> 0<00:00:57.180> and

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
9 now becomes a 1 2 minus 2 is a 0 and

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.160 
9 now becomes a 1 2 minus 2 is a 0 and
then<00:00:58.050> we<00:00:58.140> bring<00:00:58.320> down<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.530> 1<00:00:59.480> we<00:01:00.480> do<00:01:00.690> binary

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
then we bring down the 1 we do binary

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.160 
then we bring down the 1 we do binary
subtraction<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.280> same<00:01:02.550> way<00:01:02.780> let's<00:01:03.780> take<00:01:03.989> the

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
subtraction the same way let's take the

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:11.590 
subtraction the same way let's take the
binary<00:01:04.379> number<00:01:04.949> 1<00:01:05.549> 0<00:01:06.330> 0<00:01:06.930> and<00:01:07.260> let's<00:01:08.159> subtract<00:01:08.670> 1

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
binary number 1 0 0 and let's subtract 1

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.950 
binary number 1 0 0 and let's subtract 1
0<00:01:12.600> minus<00:01:13.049> 1<00:01:13.080> we<00:01:13.590> can't<00:01:13.830> do<00:01:13.979> that<00:01:14.420> so<00:01:15.420> we<00:01:15.570> borrow

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
0 minus 1 we can't do that so we borrow

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.380 
0 minus 1 we can't do that so we borrow
from<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.500> next<00:01:16.860> position<00:01:17.159> which<00:01:17.580> is<00:01:17.729> also<00:01:17.880> 0

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
from the next position which is also 0

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.060 
from the next position which is also 0
so<00:01:18.659> we<00:01:18.780> can't<00:01:19.049> borrow<00:01:19.290> anything<00:01:19.680> cause<00:01:19.920> it's

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
so we can't borrow anything cause it's

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.550 
so we can't borrow anything cause it's
already<00:01:20.220> 0<00:01:20.700> so<00:01:21.509> what<00:01:21.810> those<00:01:21.960> we<00:01:22.140> look<00:01:22.290> to<00:01:22.439> the

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
already 0 so what those we look to the

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.160 
already 0 so what those we look to the
third<00:01:22.770> position<00:01:23.009> which<00:01:23.369> is<00:01:23.520> 1<00:01:23.820> we<00:01:24.570> borrow<00:01:24.930> from

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
third position which is 1 we borrow from

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.580 
third position which is 1 we borrow from
this<00:01:25.380> one<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:26.280> it<00:01:26.460> becomes<00:01:26.790> a<00:01:26.939> 0<00:01:27.509> then<00:01:28.470> this

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
this one and it becomes a 0 then this

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.480 
this one and it becomes a 0 then this
becomes<00:01:29.009> a<00:01:29.159> 2<00:01:30.060> if<00:01:30.840> you<00:01:31.350> remember<00:01:31.829> if<00:01:32.159> we<00:01:32.340> go

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
becomes a 2 if you remember if we go

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.120 
becomes a 2 if you remember if we go
back<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:32.970> base<00:01:33.180> 10<00:01:33.540> memory<00:01:33.780> system<00:01:34.259> when

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
we borrow from a position we're actually

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.539 
we borrow from a position we're actually
borrowing<00:01:38.280> 10<00:01:39.229> because<00:01:40.229> this<00:01:40.380> is<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.680> base<00:01:40.979> 10

we can borrow from it to go here so when

we can borrow from it to go here so when

we borrow from the 2 it becomes a 1 and
this<00:02:01.500> becomes<00:02:01.890> a<00:02:02.070> 3<00:02:02.790> now<00:02:03.630> we<00:02:03.689> do<00:02:03.990> a<00:02:04.020> subtraction

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
this becomes a 3 now we do a subtraction

this becomes a 3 now we do a subtraction
