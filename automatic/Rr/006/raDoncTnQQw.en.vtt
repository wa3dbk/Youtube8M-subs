not gonna buy a ps4 play this game so
yeah<00:01:41.130> it's<00:01:41.280> definitely<00:01:41.460> like<00:01:41.759> a<00:01:41.790> huge<00:01:42.119> huge

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
yeah it's definitely like a huge huge

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.080 
yeah it's definitely like a huge huge
thing<00:01:42.950> that<00:01:43.950> Square<00:01:44.220> Enix<00:01:44.250> has<00:01:44.490> invested<00:01:45.000> a

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
thing that Square Enix has invested a

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.120 
thing that Square Enix has invested a
lot<00:01:45.360> and<00:01:45.600> a<00:01:45.630> lot<00:01:45.960> a<00:01:46.200> lot<00:01:46.320> a<00:01:46.500> lot<00:01:46.619> of<00:01:46.799> money<00:01:46.950> into

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
lot and a lot a lot a lot of money into

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.039 
lot and a lot a lot a lot of money into
and<00:01:47.430> that's<00:01:47.579> that's<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.360> thing<00:01:48.570> is<00:01:48.780> they've

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
and that's that's the thing is they've

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.899 
and that's that's the thing is they've
invested<00:01:49.560> so<00:01:49.740> much<00:01:49.799> money<00:01:49.920> into<00:01:50.280> so<00:01:50.610> are<00:01:50.759> they

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
invested so much money into so are they

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:51.889 
invested so much money into so are they
going<00:01:51.060> to<00:01:51.119> see<00:01:51.210> their<00:01:51.360> money<00:01:51.509> back<00:01:51.659> and<00:01:51.840> I

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
going to see their money back and I

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.560 
going to see their money back and I
think<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.259> best<00:01:52.740> answer<00:01:52.829> for<00:01:53.159> this<00:01:53.250> is<00:01:53.570> even

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
think the best answer for this is even

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:55.910 
think the best answer for this is even
if<00:01:54.659> they<00:01:54.780> don't<00:01:55.110> it's<00:01:55.350> more<00:01:55.560> of<00:01:55.649> a<00:01:55.710> long-term

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
if they don't it's more of a long-term

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.550 
if they don't it's more of a long-term
thing<00:01:56.219> clearly<00:01:56.759> because<00:01:57.240> one<00:01:58.200> thing<00:01:58.380> you<00:01:58.439> got

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
thing clearly because one thing you got

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.380 
thing clearly because one thing you got
to<00:01:58.590> look<00:01:58.740> at<00:01:58.950> is<00:01:59.100> that<00:01:59.130> bond<00:01:59.549> fantasy<00:01:59.909> 15<00:02:00.030> is

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
to look at is that bond fantasy 15 is

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.959 
to look at is that bond fantasy 15 is
likely<00:02:00.719> not<00:02:00.750> going<00:02:00.899> to<00:02:01.170> be<00:02:01.259> just<00:02:02.159> set<00:02:02.610> in<00:02:02.700> stone

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
likely not going to be just set in stone

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.300 
likely not going to be just set in stone
final<00:02:03.360> fantasy<00:02:03.630> 15<00:02:03.780> that's<00:02:04.170> it<00:02:04.560> next<00:02:04.860> game<00:02:05.130> is

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
final fantasy 15 that's it next game is

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.620

now<00:02:07.079> you<00:02:07.140> may<00:02:07.290> be<00:02:07.320> thinking<00:02:07.439> yourself<00:02:07.799> what

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
now you may be thinking yourself what

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.199 
now you may be thinking yourself what
are<00:02:08.280> you<00:02:08.340> talking<00:02:08.580> about<00:02:08.610> Ryan<00:02:08.879> of<00:02:09.030> course

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
are you talking about Ryan of course

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.520 
are you talking about Ryan of course
that's<00:02:09.330> going<00:02:09.479> to<00:02:09.569> be<00:02:09.629> the<00:02:09.690> case<00:02:09.840> its<00:02:10.289> final

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
fantasy games are

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.309 
fantasy games are
preserved<00:02:13.450> in<00:02:13.569> their<00:02:13.690> own<00:02:13.810> right<00:02:14.050> and<00:02:14.200> they're

the<00:02:18.010> thing<00:02:18.160> about<00:02:18.220> game<00:02:18.459> development<00:02:18.610> is<00:02:18.970> when

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
the thing about game development is when

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.690 
the thing about game development is when
you<00:02:19.780> create<00:02:20.020> a<00:02:20.080> new<00:02:20.140> engine<00:02:20.410> that<00:02:21.130> engine<00:02:21.489> is

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
you create a new engine that engine is

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.360 
you create a new engine that engine is
more<00:02:22.270> than<00:02:22.390> likely<00:02:22.510> going<00:02:22.750> to<00:02:22.840> be<00:02:22.930> used<00:02:23.110> for

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
more than likely going to be used for

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.729 
more than likely going to be used for
for<00:02:24.370> later<00:02:24.550> games<00:02:24.849> for<00:02:25.180> other<00:02:25.330> games<00:02:25.569> for<00:02:26.110> the

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
for later games for other games for the

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:29.190 
for later games for other games for the
next<00:02:26.950> final<00:02:27.190> fantasy<00:02:27.580> so<00:02:28.480> to<00:02:28.540> get<00:02:28.870> that<00:02:29.020> out<00:02:29.170> of

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
next final fantasy so to get that out of

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.839 
next final fantasy so to get that out of
the<00:02:29.349> way<00:02:29.380> right<00:02:29.650> off<00:02:29.680> the<00:02:29.860> bat<00:02:30.069> you've<00:02:30.459> already

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:30.849 
the way right off the bat you've already

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:32.940 
the way right off the bat you've already
in<00:02:31.300> bet<00:02:31.630> you've<00:02:31.840> already<00:02:32.170> you<00:02:32.890> know

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
in bet you've already you know

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.339 
in bet you've already you know
jump-started<00:02:33.670> a<00:02:33.790> big<00:02:34.630> portion<00:02:34.930> of<00:02:35.140> later

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:35.349 
jump-started a big portion of later

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:37.740 
jump-started a big portion of later
development<00:02:35.830> for<00:02:35.950> other<00:02:36.069> games<00:02:36.599> this<00:02:37.599> is

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
development for other games this is

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.839 
development for other games this is
something<00:02:37.959> that<00:02:38.140> a<00:02:38.260> lot<00:02:38.319> of<00:02:38.440> developers<00:02:38.890> do<00:02:39.099> on

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:39.849 
something that a lot of developers do on

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:41.690 
something that a lot of developers do on
new<00:02:40.090> console<00:02:40.480> generations<00:02:41.019> you<00:02:41.230> know

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
new console generations you know

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.130 
new console generations you know
specifically<00:02:42.700> on<00:02:42.910> the<00:02:43.030> PlayStation<00:02:43.510> 3<00:02:43.780> I<00:02:43.810> mean

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
specifically on the PlayStation 3 I mean

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.390 
specifically on the PlayStation 3 I mean
this<00:02:44.260> happened<00:02:44.590> for<00:02:44.680> so<00:02:44.890> many<00:02:44.980> of<00:02:45.130> Sony's

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
this happened for so many of Sony's

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.830 
this happened for so many of Sony's
developers<00:02:45.819> to<00:02:45.940> get<00:02:46.060> a<00:02:46.090> new<00:02:46.209> engine<00:02:46.390> running

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
developers to get a new engine running

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.870 
developers to get a new engine running
to<00:02:47.830> and<00:02:48.040> then<00:02:48.190> this<00:02:48.370> is<00:02:48.430> what<00:02:48.670> helped

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
to and then this is what helped

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.309 
to and then this is what helped
jumpstart<00:02:49.390> them<00:02:49.540> so<00:02:49.660> once<00:02:49.810> they<00:02:49.930> finally<00:02:50.140> got

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:50.319 
jumpstart them so once they finally got

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:51.570 
jumpstart them so once they finally got
their<00:02:50.470> first<00:02:50.620> games<00:02:50.890> off<00:02:51.069> the<00:02:51.100> ground<00:02:51.370> like

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
their first games off the ground like

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.309 
their first games off the ground like
you<00:02:51.790> know<00:02:51.880> resistance<00:02:52.390> or<00:02:52.569> uncharted<00:02:52.959> or

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:53.319 
you know resistance or uncharted or

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:54.780 
you know resistance or uncharted or
motorstorm<00:02:53.860> once<00:02:54.130> they<00:02:54.220> got<00:02:54.340> all<00:02:54.459> those<00:02:54.580> stuff

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
motorstorm once they got all those stuff

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.400 
motorstorm once they got all those stuff
now<00:02:55.030> all<00:02:55.269> that<00:02:55.420> stuff<00:02:55.600> off<00:02:55.690> the<00:02:55.750> ground<00:02:56.019> they

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
now all that stuff off the ground they

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.680 
now all that stuff off the ground they
were<00:02:56.470> able<00:02:56.680> to<00:02:56.799> turn<00:02:57.549> out<00:02:57.700> another<00:02:57.970> game<00:02:58.209> much

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
were able to turn out another game much

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.740 
were able to turn out another game much
more<00:02:58.720> quickly<00:03:00.150> so<00:03:01.150> that's<00:03:01.360> the<00:03:01.450> thing<00:03:01.630> is<00:03:01.720> that

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
more quickly so that's the thing is that

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
once you get an engine going you you

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.220 
once you get an engine going you you
definitely<00:03:03.580> have<00:03:03.670> a<00:03:03.730> big<00:03:03.910> portion<00:03:04.150> of<00:03:04.480> a<00:03:04.510> you

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230

definitely have a big portion of a you
know<00:03:05.580> the<00:03:06.580> game<00:03:06.760> development<00:03:07.060> out<00:03:07.209> of<00:03:07.330> the<00:03:07.390> way

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
know the game development out of the way

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.300 
know the game development out of the way
of<00:03:07.690> course<00:03:07.930> it's<00:03:08.200> still<00:03:08.410> a<00:03:08.440> game<00:03:08.890> developers

of course it's still a game developers
very<00:03:09.489> big<00:03:09.819> long<00:03:10.030> stretch<00:03:10.390> and<00:03:10.540> there's<00:03:10.660> still

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
very big long stretch and there's still

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.690 
very big long stretch and there's still
lots<00:03:10.959> to<00:03:11.140> do<00:03:11.349> but<00:03:11.590> you<00:03:12.069> definitely<00:03:12.250> get<00:03:12.459> a<00:03:12.519> good

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
chunk out of it out of the way another

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
chunk out of it out of the way another
thing<00:03:14.470> is<00:03:14.590> that<00:03:14.620> once<00:03:14.920> you<00:03:14.980> got<00:03:15.099> the<00:03:15.160> engine

thing is that once you got the engine

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.490 
thing is that once you got the engine
done<00:03:15.640> you<00:03:15.880> build<00:03:16.060> like<00:03:16.239> assets<00:03:16.720> now<00:03:17.019> assets

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:03.690 
finally turn a profit and it took them a

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:05.990 
finally turn a profit and it took them a
long<00:05:04.169> time<00:05:04.229> like<00:05:04.710> it<00:05:04.830> at<00:05:05.070> least<00:05:05.250> lee<00:05:05.580> a<00:05:05.610> year<00:05:05.880> or

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 
long time like it at least lee a year or

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.610 
long time like it at least lee a year or
something<00:05:06.120> after<00:05:06.570> launch<00:05:06.780> but<00:05:07.320> the<00:05:07.380> game<00:05:07.500> to

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:07.620 
something after launch but the game to

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:08.840 
something after launch but the game to
finally<00:05:07.979> turn<00:05:08.130> a<00:05:08.190> profit<00:05:08.430> than<00:05:08.760> the

finally turn a profit than the

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:10.040 
finally turn a profit than the
definitive<00:05:09.090> editions<00:05:09.600> definitely<00:05:09.930> helped

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.050 
definitive editions definitely helped

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:13.159 
definitive editions definitely helped
them<00:05:10.260> but<00:05:11.160> you<00:05:11.400> can<00:05:11.580> see<00:05:11.729> that<00:05:11.760> it<00:05:12.000> takes<00:05:12.210> a<00:05:12.479> lot

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:13.169 
them but you can see that it takes a lot

fantasy<00:05:17.370> 15<00:05:17.789> but<00:05:18.660> I'm<00:05:18.960> going<00:05:19.229> to<00:05:19.380> assume<00:05:19.650> it's

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:19.830 
fantasy 15 but I'm going to assume it's

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:21.499 
fantasy 15 but I'm going to assume it's
much<00:05:20.220> bigger<00:05:20.460> than<00:05:20.550> what<00:05:20.789> tomb<00:05:21.000> raider<00:05:21.240> was

00:05:21.499 --> 00:05:21.509 
much bigger than what tomb raider was

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:23.330 
much bigger than what tomb raider was
I'm<00:05:21.840> going<00:05:22.440> to<00:05:22.560> assume<00:05:22.680> you<00:05:22.830> had<00:05:22.949> this<00:05:23.039> game<00:05:23.250> is

00:05:55.939 --> 00:05:55.949 
profit overall as a business so that's
