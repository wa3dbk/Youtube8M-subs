00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.529 
and so because we share a closet instead
of<00:00:19.590> it<00:00:19.770> being<00:00:19.830> a<00:00:20.369> bone<00:00:20.609> of<00:00:20.789> contention<00:00:20.820> in<00:00:21.390> our

of it being a bone of contention in our
relationship<00:00:22.080> I've<00:00:22.260> created<00:00:22.590> a<00:00:22.800> system<00:00:23.010> that

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
relationship I've created a system that

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.970 
relationship I've created a system that
is<00:00:23.970> super<00:00:24.480> easy<00:00:24.510> for<00:00:25.050> him<00:00:25.230> doesn't<00:00:25.740> require

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980
