00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 hello people to hanna just cook 

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:05.970
 maybe we can not quite be sure 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:11.059
 What that is but that's right 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.059
 horny kuga and you want 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:23.779
 I'm easy and happy 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:27.220
 and sometimes great citizens for 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:30.220
 you need the shelves tofu burger 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.220
 garbsen 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:38.899
 the 2 if you know 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:41.710
 and of course I believe that too 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:50.960
 a bit of a bit of garlic and 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:52.640
 we better get the carrot so karl Ottes 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.829
 sent as you can see I have 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.510
 me one pretty mixa already 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:01:00.049
 once put in position 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.769
 the cable is a bit short on we go 

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:03.589
 not anymore 

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:04.809
 yes, the plug is out so again 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:07.030
 stuck in 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:10.149
 for this vegan coburger, you have to 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:13.149
 just the whole the whole mass nice 

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:15.009
 for her it's so beautiful 

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:16.049
 fried in a pan 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:21.670
 can be 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:24.100
 200 gram co I hope that mixes that 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.460
 I'll manage it a little bit more 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.350
 tuned 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:31.780
 the strongest he's not really the 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:34.020
 first combination e-mail you still give 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.020
 to 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:44.120
 but not too much pure and the carrot 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.120
 must be rubbed 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.650
 ten hours later 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.810
 then it gets faster 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:11.509
 provided we can go further 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:11.509
 Now the eggs are used 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.049
 do you already have started ? 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:30.120
 with carrot to it's not different 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:30.629
 I just love carrots like that too 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.799
 snacken 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:34.349
 I would do it completely now 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:35.909
 before I start Mixa gives the 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:37.770
 garlic cloves I think they can too 

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:41.180
 very fine 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:45.060
 I have never been a citizen neither normal 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:47.730
 and again and never citizens 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:51.570
 So again normal citizens as well 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:53.520
 neither nor any of the damn me 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:57.990
 she may never have been normal 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:59.660
 Meat mountains or vegan no it today 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:02.700
 a premiere for me 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:08.660
 it will now be a bit salt 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:08.660
 then still neat pepper 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.480
 be mixed 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:34.359
 I think that looks good 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:36.939
 could possibly even become one 

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:38.829
 a bit too fluid but it must be then 

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:40.200
 but a real bulette will not 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:43.060
 after garlic 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:45.340
 that's alright i'll go get it 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:48.629
 the pan and then it is allowed 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.629
 attached when look what is the 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:04:03.310
 I sometimes had the highest level 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:04.720
 similar area so very dominant 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:07.659
 It definitely scented the peas smell 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:09.419
 paired with garlic more actually 

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:15.040
 not to smell out 

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:16.660
 so it is not quieter if there 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:21.060
 in there then I want to get in already 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:24.090
 grow and from there in the pan 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:26.669
 so pure with it 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:28.870
 I have the absolute rest in the 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:30.820
 Frozen state taken now 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.669
 that's why the dough is or the mass 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:35.919
 as you may call this pretty much 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:38.320
 ice cold but I believe that rather 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:39.510
 is advantageous because it is characterized 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.710
 maybe even more handy and 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:44.020
 less fluid and that is for 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:46.860
 Forms always go and then 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.860
 they also rather bulette 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:53.650
 It is like a clap in the camera 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.510
 but I think then would be the 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:56.110
 Owner of this camera is not so about it 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:58.570
 looking forward 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:00.010
 I turn now now 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:02.370
 I want to see what that looks like 

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:02.370
 on the side 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:07.090
 that looks great 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.670
 think it looks delicious 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:10.960
 he looks great to me now 

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:14.230
 I want to say I just need it 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:15.420
 right because yes in there are the sun 

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:18.310
 already be through 

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:20.650
 and then you can serve that level 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:24.520
 give burger rolls but you can do that 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:26.620
 Also eat with potatoes or with rice 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:28.540
 For example, but also works 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:31.390
 simply in bÃ¶rger rolls or between 

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:33.820
 two normal slices of bread just like that 

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:35.620
 I want this now without any 

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:37.390
 any additions to me 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:39.250
 really the tours citizen taste 

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:41.440
 to offer something without him somehow 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:45.090
 can be created by birth or 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:45.090
 other saturation supplements 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:55.920
 a bit hot so I wait a minute 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.920
 very short 

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:19.440
 i will never make meat burger again 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:22.900
 I do not miss the meat at all 

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:24.490
 people that's really sensational 

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:26.139
 Try this if you like the video 

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:28.090
 I did not need then 

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:29.949
 great if he just gave me a thumb 

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:32.590
 goes up and if you are new since and 

00:06:29.949 --> 00:06:34.660
 not so accidentally discovered then 

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:37.080
 You are welcome to leave an abo da 

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:37.080
 until then
