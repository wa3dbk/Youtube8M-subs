00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:31.090 
crap like most decks can nowadays but

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:34.479 
crap like most decks can nowadays but
okay<00:00:32.090> so<00:00:32.930> we<00:00:33.110> have<00:00:33.290> two<00:00:33.530> level<00:00:33.770> threes<00:00:33.950> here<00:00:34.280> so

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:34.489 
okay so we have two level threes here so

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:38.799 
okay so we have two level threes here so
we're<00:00:34.670> going<00:00:34.790> to<00:00:34.970> overlay<00:00:35.450> them<00:00:35.660> and<00:00:36.670> I<00:00:37.809> guess

00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:38.809 
we're going to overlay them and I guess

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:40.479 
we're going to overlay them and I guess
the<00:00:39.320> way<00:00:39.440> that<00:00:39.469> they<00:00:39.680> described<00:00:40.190> was<00:00:40.370> like

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:40.489 
the way that they described was like

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:42.400 
the way that they described was like
that<00:00:40.700> but<00:00:41.000> you<00:00:41.120> can<00:00:41.239> all<00:00:41.360> always<00:00:41.809> do<00:00:42.140> with<00:00:42.290> the

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:42.410

at<00:01:02.630> all<00:01:03.220> I'm<00:01:04.220> pretty<00:01:04.489> sure<00:01:04.610> all<00:01:04.850> of<00:01:04.879> their

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:05.119 
at all I'm pretty sure all of their

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:06.460 
at all I'm pretty sure all of their
effects<00:01:05.479> have<00:01:05.600> to<00:01:05.689> do<00:01:05.810> with<00:01:05.960> removing<00:01:06.200> their

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
effects have to do with removing their

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.800 
effects have to do with removing their
exceed<00:01:06.710> materials<00:01:07.159> and<00:01:07.430> usually<00:01:07.939> if<00:01:08.329> they

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
exceed materials and usually if they

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.270 
exceed materials and usually if they
have<00:01:08.930> a<00:01:08.960> good<00:01:09.140> effect<00:01:09.229> then<00:01:09.680> they<00:01:09.829> have<00:01:09.979> a<00:01:10.009> like

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
have a good effect then they have a like

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.370 
have a good effect then they have a like
a<00:01:10.310> negative<00:01:10.759> effect<00:01:11.180> when<00:01:12.049> they<00:01:12.110> have<00:01:12.229> no

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
a negative effect when they have no

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.690 
a negative effect when they have no
excuse<00:01:12.770> materials<00:01:13.220> and<00:01:13.340> so<00:01:13.460> forth<00:01:15.700> the

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
excuse materials and so forth the

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.730 
excuse materials and so forth the
materials<00:01:17.299> themselves<00:01:17.450> you<00:01:18.380> know<00:01:18.499> they<00:01:18.710> just

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
materials themselves you know they just

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.249 
materials themselves you know they just
went<00:01:19.039> from<00:01:19.189> monsters<00:01:19.729> to<00:01:20.030> materials<00:01:20.569> they

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:21.259 
went from monsters to materials they

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:22.840 
went from monsters to materials they
don't<00:01:21.619> count<00:01:21.889> as<00:01:22.009> monsters<00:01:22.399> so<00:01:22.579> they<00:01:22.670> can't<00:01:22.819> be

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
don't count as monsters so they can't be

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.609 
don't count as monsters so they can't be
targeted<00:01:23.389> and<00:01:23.600> obviously<00:01:23.990> their<00:01:24.139> effects<00:01:24.439> do

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
targeted and obviously their effects do

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:26.289 
targeted and obviously their effects do
not<00:01:24.649> work<00:01:25.009> and<00:01:25.219> now<00:01:25.789> here's<00:01:26.030> the<00:01:26.119> confusing
