00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
of ways this thing goes okay uh but I

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.490

not<00:02:43.970> a<00:02:44.030> smart<00:02:44.359> marketing<00:02:45.230> move<00:02:45.409> but<00:02:46.400> I<00:02:46.609> don't

00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:46.819 
not a smart marketing move but I don't

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:48.399 
not a smart marketing move but I don't
think<00:02:47.030> it<00:02:47.209> just<00:02:47.420> I<00:02:47.750> don't<00:02:48.200> think<00:02:48.319> it

00:02:48.399 --> 00:02:48.409 
think it just I don't think it

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:50.289 
think it just I don't think it
necessarily<00:02:48.500> means<00:02:48.909> he's<00:02:49.909> you<00:02:50.269> know

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:50.299
