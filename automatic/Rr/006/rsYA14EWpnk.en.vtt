aren't any zippers on the slip belt it's
just<00:00:39.310> one<00:00:39.610> continuous<00:00:40.510> loop<00:00:42.120> so<00:00:43.120> that's

00:00:43.319 --> 00:00:43.329 
just one continuous loop so that's

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:46.200 
just one continuous loop so that's
something<00:00:43.540> that<00:00:43.810> I<00:00:43.840> really<00:00:44.200> like<00:00:44.440> I<00:00:44.970> like<00:00:45.970> that

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:46.210 
something that I really like I like that

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.680 
something that I really like I like that
it<00:00:46.420> lays<00:00:46.630> flat<00:00:46.660> against<00:00:47.649> your<00:00:47.710> body<00:00:48.480> and<00:00:49.480> it

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:49.690 
it lays flat against your body and it

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:51.150 
it lays flat against your body and it
doesn't<00:00:49.840> bounce<00:00:50.140> when<00:00:50.470> you're<00:00:50.620> running<00:00:50.800> which

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:51.160 
doesn't bounce when you're running which

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.350 
doesn't bounce when you're running which
is<00:00:51.340> really<00:00:51.610> important

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:52.360 
is really important

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:58.410 
is really important
it<00:00:53.170> fits<00:00:53.730> my<00:00:54.730> phone<00:00:55.030> my<00:00:55.750> keys<00:00:56.110> my<00:00:56.980> fuel<00:00:57.300> but<00:00:58.300> it

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:58.420 
it fits my phone my keys my fuel but it

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.660 
it fits my phone my keys my fuel but it
does<00:00:58.630> not<00:00:58.780> fit<00:00:59.710> any<00:00:59.920> kind<00:01:00.130> of<00:01:00.280> water<00:01:00.520> or

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:00.670 
does not fit any kind of water or

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.280 
does not fit any kind of water or
anything<00:01:00.820> like<00:01:01.300> that<00:01:01.329> so<00:01:01.750> that<00:01:01.960> I<00:01:02.020> would<00:01:02.260> have

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:02.290 
anything like that so that I would have

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:08.639 
anything like that so that I would have
to<00:01:02.559> carry<00:01:02.800> separately<00:01:03.460> I<00:01:07.439> originally<00:01:08.439> looked

00:01:08.639 --> 00:01:08.649 
to carry separately I originally looked

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:11.639 
to carry separately I originally looked
for<00:01:09.039> about<00:01:09.579> because<00:01:10.179> I<00:01:10.209> was<00:01:10.600> using<00:01:10.899> an<00:01:11.109> armband

00:01:11.639 --> 00:01:11.649 
for about because I was using an armband

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:13.590 
for about because I was using an armband
and<00:01:12.100> I<00:01:12.369> kind<00:01:12.609> of<00:01:12.700> have<00:01:12.850> some<00:01:13.209> chicken<00:01:13.479> wings

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 
and I kind of have some chicken wings

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.859 
and I kind of have some chicken wings
going<00:01:13.990> on<00:01:14.229> so<00:01:15.100> I<00:01:15.700> always<00:01:15.999> have<00:01:16.270> issues<00:01:16.569> with

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:16.869 
going on so I always have issues with

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:21.139 
going on so I always have issues with
armbands<00:01:17.380> because<00:01:17.859> they<00:01:18.039> never<00:01:18.249> stay<00:01:18.579> up<00:01:18.840> so<00:01:19.840> I

00:01:21.139 --> 00:01:21.149 
armbands because they never stay up so I

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:23.370 
armbands because they never stay up so I
searched<00:01:22.149> the<00:01:22.299> internet<00:01:22.329> and<00:01:22.630> found<00:01:22.869> the<00:01:23.200> flip

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.080 

okay<00:01:46.840> so<00:01:46.959> here's<00:01:47.319> the<00:01:47.380> flip<00:01:47.740> out<00:01:47.950> and<00:01:48.279> I<00:01:48.819> got<00:01:49.060> a

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
okay so here's the flip out and I got a

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.199 
okay so here's the flip out and I got a
size<00:01:49.359> small<00:01:50.429> just<00:01:51.429> for<00:01:51.579> reference<00:01:51.759> you

00:01:52.199 --> 00:01:52.209 
size small just for reference you

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:57.809 
size small just for reference you
actually<00:01:52.599> have<00:01:52.749> to<00:01:52.899> step<00:01:53.259> into<00:01:53.590> it<00:01:54.959> and<00:01:56.819> then

00:01:57.809 --> 00:01:57.819 
actually have to step into it and then

00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:04.559 
actually have to step into it and then
pull<00:01:58.209> it<00:01:58.329> up<00:02:00.299> and<00:02:01.859> then<00:02:02.859> I<00:02:02.889> can<00:02:03.189> put<00:02:04.149> my<00:02:04.299> phone

00:02:04.559 --> 00:02:04.569 
pull it up and then I can put my phone

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:12.350 
pull it up and then I can put my phone
in<00:02:04.959> here<00:02:07.590> like<00:02:08.590> this

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.830 

and<00:02:13.890> then<00:02:14.890> if<00:02:15.130> you<00:02:15.310> want<00:02:15.670> you<00:02:15.970> can<00:02:16.330> flip<00:02:16.690> it

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
and then if you want you can flip it

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.340 
and then if you want you can flip it
over<00:02:17.020> and<00:02:17.230> that<00:02:17.530> locks<00:02:18.490> the<00:02:19.030> flip<00:02:19.330> out<00:02:19.540> in<00:02:19.870> I

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
over and that locks the flip out in I

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:23.550 
over and that locks the flip out in I
usually<00:02:21.280> don't<00:02:21.690> flip<00:02:22.690> it<00:02:22.810> over<00:02:22.960> because<00:02:23.530> I

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
usually don't flip it over because I

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.180 
usually don't flip it over because I
find<00:02:23.950> that<00:02:24.100> things<00:02:24.640> stay<00:02:25.320> in<00:02:26.320> there<00:02:26.650> without

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
find that things stay in there without

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.390 
find that things stay in there without
me<00:02:27.580> having<00:02:27.880> to<00:02:28.090> flip<00:02:28.390> it<00:02:28.570> over<00:02:28.690> I<00:02:29.110> do<00:02:30.010> like<00:02:30.370> that

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
me having to flip it over I do like that

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.290 
me having to flip it over I do like that
it's<00:02:30.790> really<00:02:31.120> easy<00:02:31.150> to<00:02:31.600> change<00:02:31.650> the<00:02:32.650> volume<00:02:33.300> so

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
it's really easy to change the volume so

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.270 
it's really easy to change the volume so
if<00:02:34.390> I'm<00:02:34.540> starting<00:02:34.780> out<00:02:34.990> a<00:02:35.050> race<00:02:35.290> I'll<00:02:35.890> usually

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
if I'm starting out a race I'll usually

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.940 
if I'm starting out a race I'll usually
have<00:02:36.580> the<00:02:36.730> volume<00:02:37.260> really<00:02:38.260> low<00:02:38.560> and<00:02:38.740> then<00:02:38.860> I

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
have the volume really low and then I

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.250 
have the volume really low and then I
can<00:02:39.100> just<00:02:39.250> hit<00:02:39.430> the<00:02:39.490> buttons<00:02:39.940> here<00:02:40.360> to<00:02:40.570> adjust

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
can just hit the buttons here to adjust

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.070 
can just hit the buttons here to adjust
the<00:02:41.530> volume<00:02:41.890> which<00:02:42.040> is<00:02:42.190> really<00:02:42.430> nice<00:02:43.080> some

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
the volume which is really nice some

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:49.830 
the volume which is really nice some
cons<00:02:44.440> about<00:02:44.920> the<00:02:45.220> flip<00:02:45.460> belts<00:02:45.930> are<00:02:47.520> that<00:02:48.840> you

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
cons about the flip belts are that you

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.220 
cons about the flip belts are that you
can't<00:02:50.110> bring<00:02:50.380> hydration<00:02:50.710> with<00:02:51.250> you<00:02:51.780> on<00:02:52.780> the

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
can't bring hydration with you on the

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.800 
can't bring hydration with you on the
flip<00:02:53.440> belt<00:02:53.650> so<00:02:54.640> that's<00:02:54.850> not<00:02:55.180> good<00:02:55.420> and<00:02:55.660> also

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
flip belt so that's not good and also

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.330 
flip belt so that's not good and also
some<00:02:56.200> of<00:02:56.380> the<00:02:57.240> wicking<00:02:58.240> material<00:02:58.810> especially

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
some of the wicking material especially

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.520 
some of the wicking material especially
like<00:03:00.340> my<00:03:00.610> running<00:03:01.510> tights<00:03:01.780> a<00:03:02.170> pair<00:03:02.350> of<00:03:02.380> my

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
like my running tights a pair of my

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.300 
like my running tights a pair of my
running<00:03:02.800> tights<00:03:02.950> I<00:03:03.190> can<00:03:03.430> that<00:03:04.050> I<00:03:05.220> can't<00:03:06.220> really

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
running tights I can that I can't really

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.400

wear<00:03:06.490> my<00:03:06.700> football<00:03:07.060> very<00:03:07.330> well<00:03:07.570> with<00:03:07.840> because

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410

it<00:03:08.740> tends<00:03:08.980> to<00:03:09.160> ride<00:03:09.670> up<00:03:09.700> because<00:03:10.270> both<00:03:10.630> of<00:03:10.660> the

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
it tends to ride up because both of the

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.240 
it tends to ride up because both of the
materials<00:03:11.380> are<00:03:11.530> pretty<00:03:11.800> slippery<00:03:13.920> so<00:03:14.920> really

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
materials are pretty slippery so really

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.370 
materials are pretty slippery so really
