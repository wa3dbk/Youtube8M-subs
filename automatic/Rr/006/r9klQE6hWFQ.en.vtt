in<00:00:05.959> this<00:00:06.169> tutorial<00:00:06.379> I'm<00:00:06.649> going<00:00:06.769> to<00:00:06.830> quickly

00:00:06.999 --> 00:00:07.009 
in this tutorial I'm going to quickly

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:09.279 
in this tutorial I'm going to quickly
show<00:00:07.370> you<00:00:07.399> how<00:00:07.729> to<00:00:07.790> add<00:00:08.210> materials<00:00:08.840> v-ray

00:00:09.279 --> 00:00:09.289 
show you how to add materials v-ray

00:00:09.289 --> 00:00:12.279 
show you how to add materials v-ray
materials<00:00:09.860> in<00:00:10.129> 3ds<00:00:10.519> max<00:00:10.910> so<00:00:11.719> let's<00:00:11.840> start<00:00:12.110> by

00:00:12.279 --> 00:00:12.289 
materials in 3ds max so let's start by

00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:15.970 
materials in 3ds max so let's start by
creating<00:00:12.620> a<00:00:13.070> plane<00:00:13.669> and<00:00:14.469> then<00:00:15.469> I'll<00:00:15.650> just<00:00:15.830> put

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:15.980 
creating a plane and then I'll just put

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.760 
creating a plane and then I'll just put
a<00:00:16.070> teapot<00:00:16.520> in<00:00:16.820> the<00:00:16.970> center<00:00:17.390> I'm<00:00:18.200> going<00:00:18.439> to<00:00:18.529> make

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:18.770 
a teapot in the center I'm going to make

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:21.189 
a teapot in the center I'm going to make
sure<00:00:19.160> I<00:00:19.610> have<00:00:19.939> shaded<00:00:20.270> selected<00:00:20.869> and<00:00:20.990> edged

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:21.199 
sure I have shaded selected and edged

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:24.580 
sure I have shaded selected and edged
faces<00:00:21.439> for<00:00:22.039> my<00:00:22.160> viewport<00:00:22.580> settings<00:00:22.910> here<00:00:23.590> okay

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:24.590 
faces for my viewport settings here okay

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:25.960 
faces for my viewport settings here okay
so<00:00:24.619> if<00:00:24.920> you<00:00:25.039> want<00:00:25.279> you<00:00:25.400> can<00:00:25.550> open<00:00:25.820> up<00:00:25.910> your

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:25.970 
so if you want you can open up your

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:27.519 
so if you want you can open up your
material<00:00:26.480> editor<00:00:26.570> and<00:00:27.019> if<00:00:27.080> you<00:00:27.170> hold<00:00:27.349> this

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:27.529 
material editor and if you hold this

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:28.660 
material editor and if you hold this
down<00:00:27.769> you<00:00:27.980> have<00:00:28.070> your<00:00:28.189> two<00:00:28.369> different

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:28.670 
down you have your two different

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:30.009 
down you have your two different
material<00:00:29.000> editors<00:00:29.330> right<00:00:29.630> now<00:00:29.750> I'm<00:00:29.840> going<00:00:29.960> to

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:30.019 
material editors right now I'm going to

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:33.390 
material editors right now I'm going to
use<00:00:30.199> the<00:00:31.099> compact<00:00:31.519> editor<00:00:31.939> so<00:00:32.210> this<00:00:32.449> first<00:00:32.839> one

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:33.400 
use the compact editor so this first one

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.210 
use the compact editor so this first one
and<00:00:34.400> you<00:00:35.210> should<00:00:35.480> already<00:00:35.750> have<00:00:35.930> your<00:00:36.220> scene

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:37.220 
and you should already have your scene

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.910 
and you should already have your scene
set<00:00:37.430> up<00:00:37.519> is<00:00:37.670> a<00:00:37.699> v-ray<00:00:38.059> scene<00:00:38.620> so<00:00:39.620> now<00:00:39.739> if<00:00:39.830> you

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
set up is a v-ray scene so now if you

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.460 
set up is a v-ray scene so now if you
select<00:00:40.100> any<00:00:40.430> of<00:00:40.549> these<00:00:40.699> preview<00:00:41.299> windows<00:00:41.720> you

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:42.470 
select any of these preview windows you

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:43.960 
select any of these preview windows you
can<00:00:42.500> get<00:00:42.830> a<00:00:42.860> new<00:00:43.070> material<00:00:43.369> by<00:00:43.640> hitting<00:00:43.820> this

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:43.970 
can get a new material by hitting this

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.479 
can get a new material by hitting this
button<00:00:44.030> here<00:00:44.659> which<00:00:44.839> is<00:00:45.619> the<00:00:45.769> get<00:00:46.010> material

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:46.489 
button here which is the get material

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:49.390 
button here which is the get material
button<00:00:46.760> and<00:00:47.650> then<00:00:48.650> that'll<00:00:48.949> pop<00:00:49.100> up<00:00:49.280> your

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:49.400 
button and then that'll pop up your

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.039 
button and then that'll pop up your
material/map<00:00:50.000> browser<00:00:50.030> so<00:00:50.750> enter<00:00:50.930> your

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:51.049 
material/map browser so enter your

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:52.689 
material/map browser so enter your
materials<00:00:51.470> you<00:00:51.530> have<00:00:51.619> standard<00:00:52.250> materials

00:00:52.689 --> 00:00:52.699 
materials you have standard materials

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:55.030 
materials you have standard materials
which<00:00:52.850> you<00:00:52.879> can<00:00:53.119> use<00:00:53.299> in<00:00:53.479> v-ray<00:00:53.659> but<00:00:54.470> it's

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:55.040 
which you can use in v-ray but it's

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.410 
which you can use in v-ray but it's
better<00:00:55.220> usually<00:00:55.640> to<00:00:55.760> use<00:00:55.879> these<00:00:56.030> v-ray

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
better usually to use these v-ray

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.420 
better usually to use these v-ray
advanced<00:00:56.780> materials<00:00:57.409> and<00:00:57.619> the<00:00:57.920> default

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:58.430 
advanced materials and the default

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.329 
advanced materials and the default
materials<00:00:59.299> of<00:00:59.479> v-ray<00:00:59.809> MTL<00:01:00.739> you<00:01:00.890> can<00:01:01.040> also<00:01:01.159> use

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:01.339 
materials of v-ray MTL you can also use

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:02.590 
materials of v-ray MTL you can also use
a<00:01:01.369> viewer<00:01:01.640> a<00:01:01.729> light<00:01:01.939> material<00:01:02.390> which<00:01:02.510> will

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.600 
a viewer a light material which will

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.240 
a viewer a light material which will
basically<00:01:02.809> turn<00:01:03.170> an<00:01:03.320> object<00:01:03.739> into<00:01:03.979> a<00:01:04.010> light

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
basically turn an object into a light

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.039 
basically turn an object into a light
source<00:01:04.519> and<00:01:04.939> then<00:01:05.449> there's<00:01:05.600> some<00:01:05.689> other<00:01:05.780> ones

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:06.049 
source and then there's some other ones

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:08.279 
source and then there's some other ones
like<00:01:06.170> car<00:01:06.439> paint<00:01:06.740> and<00:01:07.040> two-sided<00:01:07.580> but<00:01:07.790> and

00:01:08.279 --> 00:01:08.289 
like car paint and two-sided but and

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:10.359 
like car paint and two-sided but and
v-ray<00:01:09.289> material<00:01:09.710> wrapper<00:01:10.039> which<00:01:10.189> you<00:01:10.250> can

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:10.369 
v-ray material wrapper which you can

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:12.130 
v-ray material wrapper which you can
actually<00:01:10.670> wrap<00:01:10.909> a<00:01:11.240> different<00:01:11.719> material<00:01:12.049> like

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
actually wrap a different material like

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:13.749 
actually wrap a different material like
a<00:01:12.200> mint<00:01:12.439> or<00:01:12.560> a<00:01:12.679> material<00:01:13.009> with<00:01:13.369> a<00:01:13.399> v-ray

00:01:13.749 --> 00:01:13.759 
a mint or a material with a v-ray

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:16.599 
a mint or a material with a v-ray
wrapper<00:01:14.210> and<00:01:14.810> it<00:01:14.929> will<00:01:15.079> work<00:01:15.229> in<00:01:15.469> v-ray<00:01:15.710> but<00:01:16.070> by

00:01:16.599 --> 00:01:16.609 
wrapper and it will work in v-ray but by

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:17.830 
wrapper and it will work in v-ray but by
default<00:01:16.789> you<00:01:17.060> usually<00:01:17.149> want<00:01:17.479> to<00:01:17.570> use<00:01:17.630> the

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
default you usually want to use the

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.919 
default you usually want to use the
v-ray<00:01:18.140> MTL<00:01:18.679> so<00:01:18.950> I'll<00:01:19.039> double<00:01:19.340> click<00:01:19.369> on<00:01:19.670> that

00:01:19.919 --> 00:01:19.929 
v-ray MTL so I'll double click on that

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:22.510 
v-ray MTL so I'll double click on that
and<00:01:20.929> make<00:01:21.170> sure<00:01:21.320> you're<00:01:21.469> using<00:01:21.619> materials<00:01:22.310> and

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
and make sure you're using materials and

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:23.950 
and make sure you're using materials and
not<00:01:22.609> maps<00:01:22.909> they<00:01:23.240> show<00:01:23.420> up<00:01:23.539> in<00:01:23.659> the<00:01:23.749> same

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
not maps they show up in the same

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.989 
not maps they show up in the same
browser<00:01:24.200> so<00:01:24.649> sometimes<00:01:25.159> people<00:01:25.429> accidentally

00:01:25.989 --> 00:01:25.999 
browser so sometimes people accidentally

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:28.179 
browser so sometimes people accidentally
choose<00:01:26.270> one<00:01:26.479> of<00:01:26.509> these<00:01:26.719> but<00:01:27.619> you<00:01:27.799> want<00:01:27.979> to<00:01:28.039> make

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:28.189 
choose one of these but you want to make

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:29.739 
choose one of these but you want to make
sure<00:01:28.219> you're<00:01:28.460> using<00:01:28.609> the<00:01:28.820> actual<00:01:29.179> material

00:01:29.739 --> 00:01:29.749 
sure you're using the actual material

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:31.810 
sure you're using the actual material
the<00:01:30.350> maps<00:01:30.590> will<00:01:30.799> go<00:01:30.890> into<00:01:31.310> the<00:01:31.369> material<00:01:31.729> but

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
the maps will go into the material but

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.340 
the maps will go into the material but
you<00:01:31.850> need<00:01:32.060> to<00:01:32.149> start<00:01:32.390> with<00:01:32.509> a<00:01:32.539> base<00:01:32.749> material

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
you need to start with a base material

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.260 
you need to start with a base material
so<00:01:33.920> once<00:01:34.039> you<00:01:34.130> have<00:01:34.280> that<00:01:34.340> it<00:01:34.670> should<00:01:34.880> show<00:01:35.090> up

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
so once you have that it should show up

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.599 
so once you have that it should show up
as<00:01:35.450> a<00:01:35.479> viewer<00:01:35.780> a<00:01:35.869> power<00:01:36.140> shader<00:01:36.499> you<00:01:36.740> can<00:01:37.490> then

00:01:37.599 --> 00:01:37.609 
as a viewer a power shader you can then

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:40.260 
as a viewer a power shader you can then
change<00:01:37.819> the<00:01:38.030> color<00:01:38.060> by<00:01:38.509> changing<00:01:38.929> the<00:01:39.020> diffuse

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
change the color by changing the diffuse

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.969 
change the color by changing the diffuse
that'll<00:01:41.270> change<00:01:41.659> the<00:01:41.840> color<00:01:42.049> if<00:01:42.649> you<00:01:42.770> want<00:01:42.920> to

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
that'll change the color if you want to

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:44.499 
that'll change the color if you want to
apply<00:01:43.159> material<00:01:43.670> you<00:01:43.729> can<00:01:43.819> either<00:01:43.969> drag<00:01:44.299> it

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 
apply material you can either drag it

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:46.239 
apply material you can either drag it
onto<00:01:44.719> the<00:01:44.960> object<00:01:45.140> or<00:01:45.560> you<00:01:45.619> can<00:01:45.799> select<00:01:45.979> the

00:01:46.239 --> 00:01:46.249 
onto the object or you can select the

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:47.950 
onto the object or you can select the
object<00:01:46.640> and<00:01:46.789> hit<00:01:46.909> this<00:01:47.030> button<00:01:47.359> here<00:01:47.569> assign

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
object and hit this button here assign

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.649 
object and hit this button here assign
material<00:01:48.319> to<00:01:48.380> selection<00:01:49.119> if<00:01:50.119> you<00:01:50.270> want<00:01:50.450> to<00:01:50.509> add

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:50.659 
material to selection if you want to add

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:52.899 
material to selection if you want to add
reflection<00:01:51.409> you<00:01:51.619> can<00:01:51.770> change<00:01:52.069> this<00:01:52.219> value<00:01:52.280> and

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:52.909 
reflection you can change this value and

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:54.879 
reflection you can change this value and
the<00:01:53.450> reflection<00:01:53.929> goes<00:01:54.109> from<00:01:54.350> black<00:01:54.590> to<00:01:54.619> white

00:01:54.879 --> 00:01:54.889 
the reflection goes from black to white

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:56.169 
the reflection goes from black to white
so<00:01:55.310> white<00:01:55.520> would<00:01:55.670> be<00:01:55.789> a<00:01:55.819> hundred<00:01:55.999> percent

00:01:56.169 --> 00:01:56.179 
so white would be a hundred percent

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:58.660 
so white would be a hundred percent
reflective<00:01:56.960> like<00:01:57.170> a<00:01:57.200> mirror<00:01:57.679> and<00:01:57.770> black<00:01:58.520> would

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
reflective like a mirror and black would

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.969 
reflective like a mirror and black would
be<00:01:58.729> no<00:01:58.999> reflection<00:01:59.569> you<00:02:00.439> can<00:02:00.560> also<00:02:00.679> change

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
be no reflection you can also change

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:03.340 
be no reflection you can also change
glossiness<00:02:01.789> values<00:02:02.240> if<00:02:02.600> you<00:02:02.990> ever<00:02:03.109> use<00:02:03.319> a

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
glossiness values if you ever use a

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:04.690 
glossiness values if you ever use a
reflection<00:02:03.859> or<00:02:03.979> refraction<00:02:04.009> I<00:02:04.579> would

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
reflection or refraction I would

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.940 
reflection or refraction I would
increase<00:02:04.999> the<00:02:05.240> subdivisions<00:02:05.840> from<00:02:06.020> 8<00:02:06.229> to<00:02:06.590> 20

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
increase the subdivisions from 8 to 20

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.529 
increase the subdivisions from 8 to 20
and<00:02:07.100> that's<00:02:07.819> just<00:02:08.060> going<00:02:08.149> to<00:02:08.240> give<00:02:08.390> you<00:02:08.509> a

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
and that's just going to give you a

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.359 
and that's just going to give you a
sharper<00:02:09.050> reflection<00:02:09.590> or<00:02:09.709> refraction<00:02:09.740> if<00:02:10.280> you

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
sharper reflection or refraction if you

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:11.830 
sharper reflection or refraction if you
don't<00:02:10.610> have<00:02:10.789> any<00:02:11.000> if<00:02:11.150> these<00:02:11.300> are<00:02:11.420> both<00:02:11.569> black

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
don't have any if these are both black

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.560 
don't have any if these are both black
you<00:02:12.230> can<00:02:12.380> leave<00:02:12.560> it<00:02:12.680> at<00:02:12.800> 8<00:02:13.010> and<00:02:13.250> that's<00:02:13.400> okay<00:02:13.790> if

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
you can leave it at 8 and that's okay if

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:16.120 
you can leave it at 8 and that's okay if
you<00:02:14.750> want<00:02:14.870> to<00:02:14.930> add<00:02:15.020> a<00:02:15.050> map<00:02:15.380> you<00:02:15.590> can<00:02:15.710> add<00:02:15.830> a<00:02:15.890> map

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
you want to add a map you can add a map

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.510 
you want to add a map you can add a map
into

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
into

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.760 
into
any<00:02:16.640> of<00:02:16.910> these<00:02:17.210> blank<00:02:17.630> slots<00:02:18.020> so<00:02:18.260> for<00:02:18.440> example

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770 
any of these blank slots so for example

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.000 
any of these blank slots so for example
if<00:02:18.860> I<00:02:18.920> want<00:02:19.070> to<00:02:19.130> add<00:02:19.220> a<00:02:19.250> diffuse<00:02:19.790> map<00:02:20.950> so<00:02:21.950> I

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
if I want to add a diffuse map so I

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.080 
if I want to add a diffuse map so I
don't<00:02:22.160> want<00:02:22.280> to<00:02:22.340> use<00:02:22.430> the<00:02:22.520> color<00:02:22.760> but<00:02:23.000> an

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
don't want to use the color but an

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.030 
don't want to use the color but an
actual<00:02:23.240> map<00:02:23.600> you<00:02:23.780> can<00:02:23.930> select<00:02:24.110> this<00:02:24.470> and<00:02:24.800> bring

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
actual map you can select this and bring

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.130 
actual map you can select this and bring
up<00:02:25.160> your<00:02:25.250> material/map<00:02:25.790> browser<00:02:25.820> and<00:02:26.540> choose

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
up your material/map browser and choose

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.110 
up your material/map browser and choose
from<00:02:27.290> any<00:02:27.500> of<00:02:27.650> these<00:02:27.770> maps<00:02:28.070> if<00:02:28.760> you<00:02:28.940> have<00:02:29.030> an

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
from any of these maps if you have an

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.880 
from any of these maps if you have an
image<00:02:29.360> that<00:02:29.570> you<00:02:29.870> want<00:02:30.050> to<00:02:30.200> use<00:02:30.380> you<00:02:30.590> can<00:02:30.740> use<00:02:30.770> a

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
image that you want to use you can use a

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.590 
image that you want to use you can use a
bitmap<00:02:31.190> or<00:02:31.850> you<00:02:32.090> can<00:02:32.240> use<00:02:32.360> when<00:02:32.510> these

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
bitmap or you can use when these

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.130 
bitmap or you can use when these
predefined<00:02:33.260> maps<00:02:33.950> for<00:02:34.310> example<00:02:34.370> I<00:02:35.090> could<00:02:35.990> use

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
predefined maps for example I could use

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.190 
predefined maps for example I could use
a<00:02:36.170> checker<00:02:36.470> pattern<00:02:36.770> and<00:02:37.520> then<00:02:37.820> if<00:02:37.940> I<00:02:38.200> select

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
a checker pattern and then if I select

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.020 
a checker pattern and then if I select
this<00:02:39.350> button<00:02:39.530> here<00:02:39.890> which<00:02:40.040> is<00:02:40.190> show<00:02:40.400> shaded

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
this button here which is show shaded

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.240 
this button here which is show shaded
material<00:02:41.180> in<00:02:42.140> viewport<00:02:42.230> if<00:02:42.770> you<00:02:42.860> select<00:02:43.160> that

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
material in viewport if you select that

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:44.950 
material in viewport if you select that
it'll<00:02:43.580> actually<00:02:43.610> show<00:02:44.090> whatever<00:02:44.330> map<00:02:44.750> is

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:44.960 
it'll actually show whatever map is

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.300 
it'll actually show whatever map is
currently<00:02:45.350> selected

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
currently selected

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.550 
currently selected
so<00:02:46.850> with<00:02:46.970> this<00:02:47.150> material<00:02:47.540> browser<00:02:47.960> you'll

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
so with this material browser you'll

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.320 
so with this material browser you'll
notice<00:02:48.860> a<00:02:48.950> drop-down<00:02:49.250> window<00:02:49.790> here<00:02:50.030> and<00:02:50.180> these

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
notice a drop-down window here and these

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:51.610 
notice a drop-down window here and these
are<00:02:50.450> the<00:02:50.540> different<00:02:50.840> levels<00:02:50.990> of<00:02:51.440> your

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
are the different levels of your

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.070 
are the different levels of your
material<00:02:52.070> so<00:02:52.100> you<00:02:52.850> can<00:02:53.000> see<00:02:53.180> my<00:02:53.330> base<00:02:53.510> material

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
material so you can see my base material

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.290 
material so you can see my base material
here<00:02:54.260> number<00:02:54.530> 25<00:02:54.950> and<00:02:54.980> the<00:02:55.370> map<00:02:55.610> I<00:02:55.850> put<00:02:56.120> into

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300 
here number 25 and the map I put into

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:57.790 
here number 25 and the map I put into
that<00:02:56.390> material<00:02:56.900> so<00:02:56.930> if<00:02:57.140> I<00:02:57.230> want<00:02:57.380> to<00:02:57.440> go<00:02:57.530> back

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 
that material so if I want to go back

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.640 
that material so if I want to go back
out<00:02:58.130> of<00:02:58.160> this<00:02:58.370> Matua<00:02:58.900> to<00:02:59.900> select<00:03:00.170> the<00:03:00.260> material

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
out of this Matua to select the material

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.560 
out of this Matua to select the material
from<00:03:00.740> that<00:03:00.800> drop-down<00:03:01.400> you<00:03:02.060> can<00:03:02.240> then<00:03:02.390> see

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:02.570 
from that drop-down you can then see

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:04.300 
from that drop-down you can then see
there's<00:03:02.750> an<00:03:02.870> M<00:03:03.170> in<00:03:03.470> the<00:03:03.560> diffuse<00:03:03.950> so<00:03:04.130> that's

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
there's an M in the diffuse so that's

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.130 
there's an M in the diffuse so that's
the<00:03:04.490> map<00:03:04.760> that<00:03:05.000> I've<00:03:05.090> replaced<00:03:05.660> that<00:03:05.900> color

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
the map that I've replaced that color

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:07.780 
the map that I've replaced that color
with<00:03:06.380> so<00:03:06.920> if<00:03:06.980> I<00:03:07.040> want<00:03:07.190> to<00:03:07.250> go<00:03:07.310> back<00:03:07.490> into<00:03:07.670> the

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
with so if I want to go back into the

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:09.280 
with so if I want to go back into the
map<00:03:07.970> I<00:03:08.120> just<00:03:08.300> select<00:03:08.540> that<00:03:08.600> a.m.<00:03:08.900> and<00:03:09.050> I'm<00:03:09.110> back

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
map I just select that a.m. and I'm back

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.340 
map I just select that a.m. and I'm back
in<00:03:09.440> the<00:03:09.530> map<00:03:09.710> and<00:03:10.690> each<00:03:11.690> of<00:03:11.810> these<00:03:11.900> maps<00:03:12.170> have

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:12.350 
in the map and each of these maps have

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:13.900 
in the map and each of these maps have
their<00:03:12.560> own<00:03:12.710> parameters<00:03:12.980> their<00:03:13.460> own<00:03:13.550> settings

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
their own parameters their own settings

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:15.430 
their own parameters their own settings
so<00:03:14.060> you<00:03:14.120> have<00:03:14.240> to<00:03:14.390> just<00:03:14.570> select<00:03:14.720> them<00:03:15.080> and<00:03:15.260> see

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
so you have to just select them and see

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:16.660 
so you have to just select them and see
what<00:03:15.560> those<00:03:15.710> settings<00:03:16.070> are<00:03:16.190> and<00:03:16.430> you<00:03:16.520> can

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
what those settings are and you can

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.120 
what those settings are and you can
change<00:03:16.910> them<00:03:17.150> and<00:03:17.270> you'll<00:03:17.690> see<00:03:18.470> it<00:03:18.560> update<00:03:18.980> in

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
change them and you'll see it update in

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.940 
change them and you'll see it update in
real<00:03:19.280> time<00:03:19.550> here<00:03:20.380> another<00:03:21.380> way<00:03:21.470> to<00:03:21.500> add<00:03:21.709> maps

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
real time here another way to add maps

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.760 
real time here another way to add maps
is<00:03:22.160> to<00:03:22.280> go<00:03:22.400> to<00:03:22.459> the<00:03:22.580> maps<00:03:23.080> tab<00:03:24.080> here<00:03:24.560> and<00:03:24.709> you

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:24.770 
is to go to the maps tab here and you

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:26.800 
is to go to the maps tab here and you
can<00:03:24.890> see<00:03:25.070> there's<00:03:25.250> my<00:03:25.430> map<00:03:25.640> checker<00:03:25.970> so<00:03:26.330> you

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
can see there's my map checker so you

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:28.390 
can see there's my map checker so you
can<00:03:26.959> either<00:03:27.080> put<00:03:27.320> it<00:03:27.440> in<00:03:27.560> the<00:03:27.680> slot<00:03:27.920> next<00:03:28.160> to

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
can either put it in the slot next to

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.970 
can either put it in the slot next to
diffuse<00:03:28.790> up<00:03:29.090> here<00:03:29.390> or<00:03:30.110> you<00:03:30.380> can<00:03:30.560> put<00:03:30.740> it<00:03:30.830> down

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
diffuse up here or you can put it down

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.460 
diffuse up here or you can put it down
here<00:03:31.310> in<00:03:32.030> the<00:03:32.180> maps<00:03:32.420> Channel<00:03:33.020> and<00:03:33.230> both<00:03:33.440> of

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
here in the maps Channel and both of

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.710 
here in the maps Channel and both of
them<00:03:33.740> are<00:03:33.860> the<00:03:33.950> same<00:03:34.100> thing<00:03:34.430> you<00:03:35.270> can<00:03:35.420> see<00:03:35.540> all

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
them are the same thing you can see all

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.120 
them are the same thing you can see all
of<00:03:35.750> these<00:03:35.990> different<00:03:36.050> map<00:03:36.530> channels<00:03:36.890> for<00:03:37.070> the

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 
of these different map channels for the

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:39.780 
of these different map channels for the
different<00:03:37.400> properties<00:03:37.580> of<00:03:37.880> the<00:03:38.030> material

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
different properties of the material

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.790 
different properties of the material
when<00:03:40.790> map<00:03:41.690> that<00:03:41.900> you<00:03:41.990> might<00:03:42.200> want<00:03:42.410> to<00:03:42.440> use<00:03:42.620> so

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:42.800 
when map that you might want to use so

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.370 
when map that you might want to use so
I'll<00:03:42.890> select<00:03:43.250> a<00:03:43.400> different<00:03:43.750> preview<00:03:44.750> here<00:03:44.990> and

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
I'll select a different preview here and

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.340 
I'll select a different preview here and
get<00:03:45.680> a<00:03:45.709> new<00:03:45.890> material<00:03:46.930> and<00:03:47.930> I<00:03:48.050> use<00:03:48.170> another

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:48.350 
get a new material and I use another

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:51.130 
get a new material and I use another
default<00:03:48.860> one<00:03:49.360> by<00:03:50.360> the<00:03:50.420> way<00:03:50.600> while<00:03:50.810> we're<00:03:50.900> here

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.140 
default one by the way while we're here

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:52.870 
default one by the way while we're here
another<00:03:51.380> important<00:03:52.010> thing<00:03:52.190> is<00:03:52.340> if<00:03:52.490> you<00:03:52.640> have

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:52.880 
another important thing is if you have

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.070 
another important thing is if you have
so<00:03:53.510> the<00:03:53.930> number<00:03:54.200> of<00:03:54.230> preview<00:03:54.709> slots<00:03:54.950> here<00:03:55.130> only

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:56.080 
so the number of preview slots here only

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.570 
so the number of preview slots here only
show<00:03:57.080> the<00:03:57.410> materials<00:03:57.950> that<00:03:58.160> are<00:03:58.310> in<00:03:58.459> this

00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:58.580 
show the materials that are in this

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:00.010 
show the materials that are in this
preview<00:03:59.030> but<00:03:59.180> you<00:03:59.300> can<00:03:59.480> have<00:03:59.600> an<00:03:59.720> unlimited

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:00.020 
preview but you can have an unlimited

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:02.140 
preview but you can have an unlimited
number<00:04:00.260> of<00:04:00.560> materials<00:04:01.130> in<00:04:01.250> your<00:04:01.280> maxeen<00:04:01.880> and

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
number of materials in your maxeen and

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.360 
number of materials in your maxeen and
they'll<00:04:02.540> all<00:04:02.720> show<00:04:02.750> up<00:04:02.990> here<00:04:03.440> so<00:04:03.920> if<00:04:04.040> you<00:04:04.160> have

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.370 
they'll all show up here so if you have

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:08.260 
they'll all show up here so if you have
let's<00:04:04.760> say<00:04:04.850> 32<00:04:05.390> slots<00:04:05.690> here<00:04:06.500> but<00:04:07.370> 50<00:04:07.730> materials

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:08.270 
let's say 32 slots here but 50 materials

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:09.880 
let's say 32 slots here but 50 materials
you<00:04:08.420> can<00:04:08.540> always<00:04:08.690> double<00:04:09.080> click<00:04:09.290> on<00:04:09.470> them

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:09.890 
you can always double click on them

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:11.500 
you can always double click on them
under<00:04:10.250> scene<00:04:10.520> materials<00:04:10.970> and<00:04:11.150> they'll<00:04:11.270> show

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.510 
under scene materials and they'll show

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:13.030 
under scene materials and they'll show
up<00:04:11.690> here<00:04:11.959> in<00:04:11.990> your<00:04:12.140> preview<00:04:12.500> so<00:04:12.770> it<00:04:12.830> won't

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
up here in your preview so it won't

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.250 
up here in your preview so it won't
replace<00:04:13.610> one<00:04:14.239> of<00:04:14.270> the<00:04:14.420> materials<00:04:14.989> up<00:04:15.080> here

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
replace one of the materials up here

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:16.720 
replace one of the materials up here
I'll<00:04:15.350> just<00:04:15.380> replace<00:04:15.860> it<00:04:16.100> in<00:04:16.190> the<00:04:16.250> preview<00:04:16.640> and

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:16.730 
I'll just replace it in the preview and

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:18.130 
I'll just replace it in the preview and
allow<00:04:16.910> you<00:04:16.970> to<00:04:17.060> adjust<00:04:17.209> the<00:04:17.480> parameter<00:04:17.930> so

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:18.140 
allow you to adjust the parameter so

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:19.750 
allow you to adjust the parameter so
that's<00:04:18.739> something<00:04:18.980> that's<00:04:19.130> important<00:04:19.669> to

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760 
that's something that's important to

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.729 
that's something that's important to
know<00:04:19.940> let's<00:04:20.930> start<00:04:21.080> with<00:04:21.200> a<00:04:21.260> new<00:04:21.290> viewer<00:04:21.650> a

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:21.739 
know let's start with a new viewer a

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:25.540 
know let's start with a new viewer a
material<00:04:23.440> and<00:04:24.440> for<00:04:25.040> this<00:04:25.130> one<00:04:25.280> I'm<00:04:25.340> going<00:04:25.460> to

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
material and for this one I'm going to

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:27.400 
material and for this one I'm going to
add<00:04:25.610> a<00:04:25.669> fall-off<00:04:26.000> map<00:04:26.479> so<00:04:26.720> if<00:04:26.810> I<00:04:26.900> select<00:04:27.260> this

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.410 
add a fall-off map so if I select this

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.650 
add a fall-off map so if I select this
one<00:04:27.620> of<00:04:27.740> the<00:04:27.800> map<00:04:27.979> options<00:04:28.430> is<00:04:28.550> fall-off<00:04:29.000> this

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.660 
one of the map options is fall-off this

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:29.820 
one of the map options is fall-off this
is

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
is

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.440 
is
nice<00:04:30.010> one<00:04:30.220> because<00:04:30.310> it<00:04:30.520> basically<00:04:30.640> falls<00:04:31.240> off

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:31.450 
nice one because it basically falls off

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:33.450 
nice one because it basically falls off
between<00:04:31.840> these<00:04:32.020> two<00:04:32.230> colors<00:04:32.590> but<00:04:33.220> you<00:04:33.340> can

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:33.460 
between these two colors but you can

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.640 
between these two colors but you can
also<00:04:33.580> use<00:04:33.790> two<00:04:33.970> images<00:04:34.450> so<00:04:34.750> if<00:04:35.050> I<00:04:35.230> change<00:04:35.440> this

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
also use two images so if I change this

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.280 
also use two images so if I change this
color<00:04:35.920> for<00:04:36.130> example<00:04:36.480> anything<00:04:37.480> perpendicular

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:38.290 
color for example anything perpendicular

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:40.110 
color for example anything perpendicular
to<00:04:38.470> the<00:04:38.590> camera<00:04:38.920> will<00:04:39.040> be<00:04:39.160> red<00:04:39.430> anything

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
to the camera will be red anything

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.270 
to the camera will be red anything
parallel<00:04:41.050> to<00:04:41.170> the<00:04:41.260> camera<00:04:41.530> will<00:04:41.650> be<00:04:41.740> white<00:04:41.950> but

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 
parallel to the camera will be white but

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.280 
parallel to the camera will be white but
again<00:04:42.760> you<00:04:43.030> could<00:04:43.180> also<00:04:43.330> put<00:04:43.570> images<00:04:43.990> in<00:04:44.140> there

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:44.290 
again you could also put images in there

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:48.660 
again you could also put images in there
so<00:04:44.740> if<00:04:44.830> I<00:04:44.890> drag<00:04:45.160> this<00:04:45.340> on<00:04:45.550> to<00:04:45.700> that<00:04:45.850> surface<00:04:47.670> you

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:48.670 
so if I drag this on to that surface you

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:51.210 
so if I drag this on to that surface you
can't<00:04:48.940> see<00:04:49.120> it<00:04:49.210> until<00:04:49.420> I<00:04:49.480> render<00:04:49.840> but<00:04:50.560> it'll

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:51.220 
can't see it until I render but it'll

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:52.770 
can't see it until I render but it'll
fall<00:04:51.460> off<00:04:51.490> between<00:04:52.000> these<00:04:52.270> two<00:04:52.450> colors

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:52.780 
fall off between these two colors

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.770 
fall off between these two colors
depending<00:04:53.170> on<00:04:53.560> the<00:04:54.160> camera<00:04:54.490> angle<00:04:54.850> in

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780 
depending on the camera angle in

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:58.980 
depending on the camera angle in
relationship<00:04:56.320> to<00:04:56.350> the<00:04:56.560> object
