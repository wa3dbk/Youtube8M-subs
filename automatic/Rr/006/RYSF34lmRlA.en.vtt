00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:07.170
 We own 655 muscles in the body when 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.599
 But I have all these muscles with you now 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.860
 Harry and I would treat each other 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.349
 really the legs are in the belly 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.750
 That's why I'll be with you all the time 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.830
 superficial and big and above all 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:22.800
 treat muscles relevant to yoga 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:25.890
 We start with the trunk muscles 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.140
 this is part of the neck and you know that 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.689
 Maybe at the desk if after 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:34.079
 few hours so sitting and muscles 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.070
 Slowly more tensioned that is 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.780
 certainly know 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.420
 then it does not continue with the back 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.579
 only the neck muscles are tense 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.290
 but also the back no wonder if 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.680
 you sit like that all the time 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.960
 back completely overstretched shortened front 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.360
 the chest muscles that is the 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.640
 it is barely strengthened and it backs up 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.969
 constantly rewarded in this so-called 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.620
 restraint and you can see that already 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.570
 alone in this attitude that of course 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.059
 the abdominal muscles just below 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.309
 suffers and that is why the 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.250
 strengthening the abdominal muscles 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.920
 example particularly important by the 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.250
 many will sit here the area completely 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:18.210
 severely bent the hip bones area 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:20.580
 There is shortened in the hip bones 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.420
 Eerie tension in the bottom 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.869
 move 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:28.710
 that's why, for example, the strain is on 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:31.229
 the football is incredibly important and around 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.780
 to loosen the tension in the back 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.360
 it helps if you have the two back 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.090
 But we really serve one here 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.009
 then stretch 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:44.549
 of course it is so the spine 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:46.820
 needs a good support from below 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:49.700
 That is why the strengthening of the 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:52.860
 thigh muscles particularly important 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:55.710
 and if the muscles are right if the 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.920
 complete attitude is true then 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:01.120
 also the foot position and yoga bench and 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.770
 completely into the lot 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.990
 so now you have everyone 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.970
 the big muscle groups met the 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.250
 important for yoga training 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.200
 Do you want more about the bones? 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.630
 know then just click it 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.960
 skeleton otherwise starts a yoga 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.960
 program
