 for this recipe we will be able to several ingredients 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.109

 of two children of country parsley bubbles 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.970
 so we will first prepare the bass ranges 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.310
 so in combat the nine countries 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:41.560
 with the preparation of two goal children 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.560
 like these 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.660
 so we will now go to oyster preparation after having 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.660
 put lots we will position the oysters on the country 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.480
 in a way flat enough for the brains to cook 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.390
 for cooking 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.390

 emma position right now guys mass 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.330
 what's interesting in this recipe is that the cooking time of 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.330
 the oyster a correspondent since sounds the range baston in returns 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.020
