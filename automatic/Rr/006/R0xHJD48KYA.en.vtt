00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
 right now the iphone 6 is pretty much in 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:04.770
 mouth on this occasion 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.330
 or the fact that alone 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.560
 I have to do something at home 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.570
 I just go to apple google 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.070
 and I do not mean this apple 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.509
 but in the group apple ok the 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.219
 were a mega bad one as he was after 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.540
 Googled world corporation I have facts 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.980
 you certainly did not find it yet 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.090
 so know that's why there are the ten 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.090
 facts about the iphone 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.630
 the system became the collegiate and cordial 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.369
 Welcome to a new video before 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.930
 we become the actual topic of the videos 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.369
 I would first have a question 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.599
 you and always read in the 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.250
 you should actually comment this 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.780
 stupid salutation after or what 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.090
 This welcome actually means that 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.410
 that's politically correct with gray 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.760
 Latin and I can actually 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.589
 do not really say why I use the 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.910
 welcome say I have a stone in 

00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:43.379
 the school did not really like it though 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.860
 I actually found my teacher completely 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.510
 cool 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.949
 and he always said it so cool and 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.239
 thought so well then it can too 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:49.769
 that's why I say that somehow 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.690
 Properties said at the beginning of the videos 

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:52.890
 ski politically correct to say but me 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.449
 think about it for a bit longer 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.710
 I should change that welcome and 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.970
 write the comments if we 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.949
 still want to be so welcomed or 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.970
 if you say tobi and you prefer to say something 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.470
 is normal or something 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.640
 if everyone gets dough and google then 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:05.549
 you notice that on every iphone 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.240
 the time is 9 o'clock 41 stands 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.950
 nothing with the freemasons 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.780
 or with the illuminati too 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.939
 do at least I think but rather 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.189
 an intercompany because it is a 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.740
 intra-group insider at the first 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:20.100
 namely, presentation in 2007 should be 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.840
 the iphone is shown at exactly 9am 41 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.369
 will love Steve's job of course 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.659
 insisted that exactly this 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.890
 time of day is observed is because on 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.170
 the poster or of course that too 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.310
 iphone 9 o'clock 41 that one 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.299
 In any case, if we already 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.039
 even if it is probably to the 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.030
 time no sow noticed in the 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:38.460
 september 2013 sold apple in total 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:40.439
 390 million iphones that's really a lot 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.060
 if you change the length of the attached usb 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.679
 cable would have one 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.390
 I'm on the way to the moon 

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:46.829
 not that but it has 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.880
 was so in the internet under stood too 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.590
 that there is no other manufacturer 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.899
 has done what is somehow clear 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.939
 because a trip to the moon with toaster 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.039
 it is exactly a bit about the icons 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.389
 from the us system because you take the 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:58.499
 icons just like that 

00:01:57.389 --> 00:02:00.030
 but what do they actually have that 

00:01:58.499 --> 00:02:01.740
 origin becomes for example of the artes 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.740
 that one finds a music player the 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.939
 silhouette of the frontman pretty 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.950
 important to know when going in the 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.899
 safari browser's reading list goes 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.610
 you have a pair of glasses and these glasses 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.920
 nothing but the glasses from Steve 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.090
 jobs or at least the picture the 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.520
 he probably fits original glasses 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.590
 not pure the iphone managed five 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.270
 years to be represented in 100 countries 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.459
 if you compare it to the example with 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.140
 macdonald who have 50 years for 100 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.730
 countries used the course one 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.290
 stark comparison what the technical 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.629
 progressed so for now 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.459
 The science fiction author makes leaps 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:34.530
 by the way, isaac asimov has the iphone 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.790
 already predicted in the sixties 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.890
 of course I googled the same time 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.629
 At that time you said you will be yours 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.530
 not only seeing conversation partners but 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:42.480
 also listen 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.069
 In addition, the screen is used and 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.400
 to look at photographs and passages 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:50.390
 to read from books 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:53.700
 apple earned $ 4540 a second 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:55.500
 a fact that is very interesting and 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.079
 no pig interested why so 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.689
 bishop then funny facts out with 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:02.670
 the first iphone needed apple 75 days 

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:04.319
 until one million units sold what 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.359
 in itself a small number, including 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:08.549
 thinks of 1 million devices but at the 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:10.319
 iPhone 4 just took a day to get there 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:13.200
 sold a million and at the iphone 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:14.310
 62 it unfortunately not or you googles and 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.439
 write it in the comments 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.579
 and now this fact is 

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:18.269
 actually quite uninteresting because 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:20.220
 I can tell you now with any 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:22.040
 bombing data but I just found it 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:25.200
 crass the idea that an iphone 5 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:27.090
 power control more powerful than 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.439
 1 1 max of the second generation is and 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.849
 that somehow shows the technical 

00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:32.400
 progress that's pretty blatant is that 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:33.720
 such a huge performance is weaker 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.129
 So a little thinks there should be 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.870
 someone says it depends on the size 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:38.729
 the last fact turns and theirs 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.440
 Dear Steve Jobs had the tobias 

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:42.389
 vets seen the good steve jobs was 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.260
 that's how a real joker stood 

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:45.000
 at least in google 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.709
 he is supposed to call starbucks 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.720
 have ordered and 4000 latte macchiato 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:53.699
 have a real rebel lucentis 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.319
 but phone brings the time being continue 

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:57.269
 difficult, I would say the first time to 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:58.949
 car before the end here is powerful 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:00.659
 from you know first and iphone type 

00:03:58.949 --> 00:04:03.000
 or rather such another android or 

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:04.560
 windows phone type then write it out 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.470
 a comments either hashtag and 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.909
 iphone or hashtag and android the 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.260
 Windows Phone users are now helping 

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:11.939
 discriminates against the video 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.439
 vehicle with the thumb up here 

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:15.269
 there are two other videos and we see 

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:17.789
 next time next 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:20.340
 monday and next 2 pm until then 

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:22.370
 he is a new race team 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.370
 st 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:25.930
 I think
