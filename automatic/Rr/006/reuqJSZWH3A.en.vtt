how I'm training preparing for this meet

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.250 
how I'm training preparing for this meet
coming<00:00:41.460> in<00:00:41.520> October<00:00:41.750> some<00:00:42.750> people<00:00:42.989> have<00:00:43.079> seen

coming in October some people have seen
my<00:00:43.410> log<00:00:43.800> on<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.219> squat<00:00:44.489> rack<00:00:44.520> calm<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:45.480> are

my log on the squat rack calm and are

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.139 
my log on the squat rack calm and are
noticing<00:00:46.379> that<00:00:46.500> it's<00:00:46.649> not<00:00:46.710> exactly<00:00:47.579> adhering

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
noticing that it's not exactly adhering

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.540 
noticing that it's not exactly adhering
to<00:00:48.180> what<00:00:48.390> my<00:00:48.660> traditional<00:00:49.230> G<00:00:49.590> zcl<00:00:50.070> method<00:00:50.399> is

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
to what my traditional G zcl method is

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.549 
to what my traditional G zcl method is
and<00:00:50.730> you<00:00:51.270> know<00:00:51.390> you'd<00:00:51.629> be<00:00:51.719> spot<00:00:51.989> on<00:00:52.020> this<00:00:52.379> is

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
and you know you'd be spot on this is

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.350 
and you know you'd be spot on this is
more<00:00:52.770> along<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.280> lines<00:00:53.520> of<00:00:53.730> a<00:00:53.850> heavier

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
more along the lines of a heavier

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.150 
more along the lines of a heavier
structure<00:00:55.020> of<00:00:55.260> what<00:00:55.469> my<00:00:55.559> jacked<00:00:55.890> and<00:00:56.070> tan

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
structure of what my jacked and tan

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.650 
structure of what my jacked and tan
cycle<00:00:56.850> was<00:00:56.969> looking<00:00:57.329> like<00:00:57.449> so<00:00:58.260> I<00:00:58.289> ended<00:00:58.890> on<00:00:59.070> a<00:00:59.760> 6

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
cycle was looking like so I ended on a 6

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.959 
cycle was looking like so I ended on a 6
and<00:01:00.870> 4<00:01:01.109> rep<00:01:01.590> structure<00:01:02.039> followed<00:01:02.460> by<00:01:02.579> a<00:01:02.609> short

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
and 4 rep structure followed by a short

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.960 
and 4 rep structure followed by a short
peaking<00:01:03.480> cycle<00:01:04.260> of<00:01:04.409> 2<00:01:04.680> rep<00:01:04.920> maxes<00:01:05.580> and<00:01:05.610> stuff

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
peaking cycle of 2 rep maxes and stuff

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.179 
peaking cycle of 2 rep maxes and stuff
and<00:01:06.330> I<00:01:06.930> was<00:01:07.049> training<00:01:07.320> each<00:01:07.590> of<00:01:07.740> my<00:01:07.890> lifts

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
and I was training each of my lifts

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.190 
and I was training each of my lifts
twice<00:01:08.460> per<00:01:08.729> week<00:01:08.760> once<00:01:09.090> heavy<00:01:09.390> once<00:01:09.659> light<00:01:09.930> and

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
twice per week once heavy once light and

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.880 
twice per week once heavy once light and
so<00:01:10.710> I'm<00:01:10.890> taking<00:01:11.100> that<00:01:11.430> once<00:01:11.640> heavy<00:01:11.880> once<00:01:12.180> light

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
so I'm taking that once heavy once light

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:18.020 
so I'm taking that once heavy once light
methodology<00:01:13.890> and<00:01:14.900> using<00:01:15.900> 2<00:01:16.650> weeks<00:01:16.890> of<00:01:17.130> full

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
methodology and using 2 weeks of full

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.020 
methodology and using 2 weeks of full
reps<00:01:18.299> ascending<00:01:19.200> followed<00:01:19.950> by<00:01:20.100> two<00:01:20.580> weeks<00:01:20.820> of

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
reps ascending followed by two weeks of

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.450 
reps ascending followed by two weeks of
two<00:01:21.509> reps<00:01:21.750> ascending<00:01:22.290> and<00:01:22.470> I'm<00:01:22.860> not<00:01:23.070> gonna<00:01:23.250> do

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
two reps ascending and I'm not gonna do

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.010 
two reps ascending and I'm not gonna do
a<00:01:23.490> peaking<00:01:24.000> cycle<00:01:24.330> for<00:01:24.509> this<00:01:24.570> meet<00:01:24.840> because

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
a peaking cycle for this meet because

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.600 
a peaking cycle for this meet because
it's<00:01:25.200> simply<00:01:25.560> just<00:01:25.799> to<00:01:25.979> shorten<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.580> amount

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
it's simply just to shorten the amount

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.620 
it's simply just to shorten the amount
of<00:01:26.850> time<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:27.770> ultimately<00:01:28.770> this<00:01:29.640> meet<00:01:30.060> is<00:01:30.090> just

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
of time and ultimately this meet is just

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.620 
of time and ultimately this meet is just
a<00:01:30.900> feeler<00:01:31.650> of<00:01:32.210> performance<00:01:33.210> for<00:01:33.509> the

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
a feeler of performance for the

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.960 
a feeler of performance for the
following<00:01:34.290> me<00:01:34.439> I'll<00:01:34.590> be<00:01:34.740> doing<00:01:35.040> coming<00:01:35.850> in

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
following me I'll be doing coming in

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.630 
following me I'll be doing coming in
November<00:01:36.750> which<00:01:36.990> would<00:01:37.170> be<00:01:37.290> IPL<00:01:37.890> worlds<00:01:38.460> and

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
November which would be IPL worlds and

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.870 
November which would be IPL worlds and
so<00:01:39.479> I'm<00:01:40.380> not<00:01:40.650> gonna<00:01:40.920> peak<00:01:41.189> for<00:01:41.430> this<00:01:41.520> meet<00:01:41.700> but

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
so I'm not gonna peak for this meet but

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.399 
so I'm not gonna peak for this meet but
I<00:01:41.909> would<00:01:42.030> still<00:01:42.210> like<00:01:42.420> to<00:01:42.630> get<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:43.020> highest

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
I would still like to get the highest

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:44.600 
I would still like to get the highest
total<00:01:43.710> possible<00:01:44.130> that's<00:01:44.340> why<00:01:44.490> I'm<00:01:44.579> just

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
total possible that's why I'm just

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.670 
total possible that's why I'm just
training<00:01:45.060> ascending<00:01:45.780> sets<00:01:46.049> of<00:01:46.200> two<00:01:46.439> these

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
training ascending sets of two these

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.490 
training ascending sets of two these
last<00:01:46.920> two<00:01:47.159> weeks<00:01:47.399> in<00:01:47.700> a<00:01:48.119> short<00:01:48.420> mesocycle<00:01:49.290> and

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
last two weeks in a short mesocycle and

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.240 
last two weeks in a short mesocycle and
then<00:01:50.220> after<00:01:51.060> that<00:01:51.240> go<00:01:51.930> to<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.110> meet<00:01:52.409> I'll<00:01:53.040> get

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
then after that go to the meet I'll get

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.929 
then after that go to the meet I'll get
some<00:01:53.460> good<00:01:53.750> maxes<00:01:54.750> to<00:01:54.960> base<00:01:55.320> my<00:01:55.890> training<00:01:56.640> for

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
some good maxes to base my training for

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.209 
some good maxes to base my training for
the<00:01:57.060> following<00:01:57.570> four<00:01:57.810> weeks<00:01:58.079> which<00:01:58.770> will<00:01:58.950> lead

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
the following four weeks which will lead

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.330 
the following four weeks which will lead
me<00:01:59.430> up<00:01:59.460> to<00:01:59.640> I<00:02:00.360> peel<00:02:00.750> worlds<00:02:01.350> and<00:02:01.500> that's<00:02:02.040> when

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
me up to I peel worlds and that's when

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.209 
me up to I peel worlds and that's when
I'll<00:02:02.460> run<00:02:02.759> a<00:02:03.229> more<00:02:04.229> traditional<00:02:04.439> peaking

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
I'll run a more traditional peaking

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.580 
I'll run a more traditional peaking
cycle<00:02:05.640> of<00:02:05.820> some<00:02:06.030> sort<00:02:06.329> for<00:02:06.600> my<00:02:06.719> lifts<00:02:07.079> that

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
cycle of some sort for my lifts that

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.050 
cycle of some sort for my lifts that
might<00:02:07.799> be<00:02:07.920> something<00:02:08.310> that<00:02:08.340> would<00:02:08.580> look<00:02:08.819> like

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
might be something that would look like

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.300
