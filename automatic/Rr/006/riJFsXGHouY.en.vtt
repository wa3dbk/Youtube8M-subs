00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:06.850
 hi everyone here, tennis players give you a 

00:00:02.889 --> 00:00:10.300
 video tutorial on how to configure the 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:12.460
 floor controls to 14 good first thing 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.990
 what you have to do is download this 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.240
 file that I will leave them in the 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:19.990
 description of the video and once it 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:23.380
 we will have to double click 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:27.279
 now look at you 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:31.060
 in figures this we go to fifa config and here 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:33.519
 inside fifa cafe but we're going 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.660
 to give to club setup this is 

00:00:33.519 --> 00:00:38.510
 the typhoon launcher 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.880
 you do not have to have it or anything we go to 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:44.420
 command of the game here we must notice that 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:46.520
 our control is connected and once 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.440
 that we know that our control is 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:52.630
 connected simply we change the 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.700
 we put the keys to our liking 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:58.440
 here they have a drawing if they use a 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:01.660
 command of play 3 like me 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:07.540
 and for example it would be x 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:17.110
 and triangle of the circle x square 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:19.260
 lb would be l 1 901 lte on 2 rtl2 here not 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:23.220
 Are the 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:25.450
 our celtics are not ours but 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:29.289
 what are the fringes 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:31.360
 top left down right here 

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:33.340
 is the start button 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:37.899
 this is the one of select 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:40.260
 these two are the l 3 and r3 that is 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:42.930
 pressing the lever 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:46.320
 and here are the two tics that are above 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:49.410
 down left right and the same with 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:53.100
 the right once we finish it 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:56.130
 let's accept and wait once 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.870
 it's over we can save this and what 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.600
 what you have to do now is go to my 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:02.980
 documents and in my documents we can 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:06.430
 go fifa 11 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:09.300
 here we copy these two files and go 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:11.170
 to fix 14 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:16.620

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.770

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.350

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:26.020
