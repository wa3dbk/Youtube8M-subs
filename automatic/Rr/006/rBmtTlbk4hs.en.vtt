is there digitize it also seems to be
fine<00:00:22.080> it's<00:00:22.320> just<00:00:22.640> simple<00:00:23.640> crack<00:00:23.910> on<00:00:24.150> the<00:00:24.390> glass

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
procedure is quite complicated first you

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.400 
procedure is quite complicated first you
have<00:00:32.189> to<00:00:32.309> remove<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.730> two<00:00:32.910> screws<00:00:32.940> as<00:00:33.600> you<00:00:34.200> see

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:38.450 
there then you snap the glass down and

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:40.970 
there then you snap the glass down and
simply<00:00:39.450> take<00:00:39.629> it<00:00:39.780> off<00:00:39.930> be<00:00:40.350> careful<00:00:40.800> when<00:00:40.890> you

the<00:01:23.830> device<00:01:28.229> here<00:01:29.229> we<00:01:29.320> have<00:01:29.410> the<00:01:29.530> battery<00:01:29.860> and

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.010 
the device here we have the battery and

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.240 
the device here we have the battery and
the<00:01:30.750> piece<00:01:31.750> one<00:01:32.710> thing<00:01:32.890> you<00:01:32.979> want<00:01:33.130> to<00:01:33.160> remember

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
the piece one thing you want to remember

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.340 
the piece one thing you want to remember
when<00:01:33.790> you<00:01:33.880> take<00:01:34.090> off<00:01:34.240> the<00:01:34.420> screws<00:01:34.720> try<00:01:35.290> to

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
when you take off the screws try to

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.340 
when you take off the screws try to
organize<00:01:35.890> them<00:01:36.190> in<00:01:36.369> a<00:01:36.820> way<00:01:37.000> like<00:01:37.300> a<00:01:37.869> jigsaw

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
organize them in a way like a jigsaw

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.080 
organize them in a way like a jigsaw
puzzle<00:01:38.380> that<00:01:38.800> when<00:01:39.070> you<00:01:39.190> put<00:01:39.369> it<00:01:39.490> back<00:01:39.700> the

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
puzzle that when you put it back the

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.170 
puzzle that when you put it back the
correct<00:01:40.330> screw<00:01:40.660> goes<00:01:40.960> into<00:01:41.290> the<00:01:41.380> correct<00:01:41.560> slot

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
correct screw goes into the correct slot

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.340 
correct screw goes into the correct slot
there<00:01:43.180> are<00:01:43.240> different<00:01:43.570> sizes<00:01:43.780> and<00:01:44.229> different

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
there are different sizes and different

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:49.290 
there are different sizes and different
types<00:01:44.890> of<00:01:45.070> screws<00:01:45.369> in<00:01:45.520> there<00:01:47.790> and<00:01:48.790> it's<00:01:48.970> not<00:01:49.119> so

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:49.300 
types of screws in there and it's not so

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.780 
types of screws in there and it's not so
easy<00:01:49.330> to<00:01:49.630> take<00:01:49.869> the<00:01:50.020> screws<00:01:50.259> off<00:01:50.640> because<00:01:51.640> if

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.790 
easy to take the screws off because if

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.420 
easy to take the screws off because if
you<00:01:51.970> put<00:01:52.450> too<00:01:52.479> much<00:01:52.750> pressure<00:01:53.160> the<00:01:54.160> screw

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.430 
you put too much pressure the screw

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.960 
you put too much pressure the screw
might<00:01:55.140> wear<00:01:56.140> down<00:01:56.410> as<00:01:56.680> to<00:01:57.520> the<00:01:57.610> point<00:01:57.850> where

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 
might wear down as to the point where

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.920 
might wear down as to the point where
you<00:01:58.060> can't<00:01:58.270> ever<00:01:58.420> take<00:01:58.690> it<00:01:58.750> off

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:04.420 

it<00:02:03.470> would<00:02:03.590> be<00:02:03.740> helpful<00:02:03.920> if<00:02:04.130> you<00:02:04.250> had<00:02:04.400> a

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
it would be helpful if you had a

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.670 
it would be helpful if you had a
magnetic<00:02:04.910> screwdriver<00:02:05.110> for<00:02:06.110> the<00:02:06.260> screw<00:02:06.500> would

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
magnetic screwdriver for the screw would

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.440 
magnetic screwdriver for the screw would
just<00:02:06.860> stick<00:02:07.010> on<00:02:07.190> and<00:02:07.490> you<00:02:07.550> can<00:02:07.670> simply<00:02:08.000> pull<00:02:08.300> it

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
just stick on and you can simply pull it

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:33.590 
just stick on and you can simply pull it
off

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600
