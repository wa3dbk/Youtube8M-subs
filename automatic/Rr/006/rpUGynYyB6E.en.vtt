00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:05.830
 this is jj game hd 

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:10.889
 hello everyone I'm jj and today I bring you the 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.469
 first hard weapons tutorial 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.620
 software 3 in this case let's start 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.750
 with the excavator 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.670
 as you well know this weapon what it does 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.950
 is to throw a missile at ground level until 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:23.450
 that the objective arrives and good for 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.430
 start commenting that you have to have 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:28.070
 Care when launching the excavator 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:30.169
 when there are close colleagues if 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.720
 we throw and ground bars the climber 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:34.820
 will pass by but if we approach and 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:37.010
 we throw the stand in the air and from some 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.840
 climber's partner is going to explode and 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.450
 you have to be careful because because 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.370
 he can probably kill us 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.810
 the same goes for the enemies if 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.060
 we are near a beggar and we throw it 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:48.560
 the climber is going to come out and probably 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:49.910
 normal that in that case the best that 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:53.630
 we could do if we do not have another 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:55.070
 The choice would be to throw the climber and the 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:57.980
 time to give a somersault to try 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:00.290
 avoid the impact although the best way 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.480
 to use it would be medium distance 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:06.020
 As you can see, now that it is level with the ground 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:08.090
 or we can also try the one that enters 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.280
 in some area stretching it up 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.800
 as you see here I throw it so that it enters 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.820
 the hole and can kill anyone who has 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.530
 near 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.030
 well here we are going to see that the climber 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.580
 can go through walls 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.110
 that is, if we have a rival behind 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.119
 the wall we can study the climber 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.310
 below to try to catch him 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.900
 I also wanted to send a greeting and a 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.659
 thanks to the family that helps me 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.210
 to do the tutorial 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:35.030
 and good as you can see there 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:37.490
 placed behind him behind the wall 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.319
 and I 've thrown it under the 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.469
 climber the missile has crossed the 

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:44.780
 wall and I have managed to kill him too 

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:46.700
 It serves on the sides 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.400
 you can throw the climber for those who 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:52.280
 they stay in the zone this one of top you see 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:54.979
 you can throw the climber 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.659
 there you can throw it over or even 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:59.150
 below if you throw it away the already 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:00.979
 up how can you see this 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.590
 It also serves for areas where 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:06.320
 there are several floors like for example here 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.569
 in the area of much below that is the 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.039
 climber area I asked nabil 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:12.800
 jean that go a moment down and take the 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:15.020
 climber because from below we can 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.940
 pull excavator towards the roof so that 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.890
 up come out at ground level as you can 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.890
 see in abidjan is shooting towards the 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.700
 roof and the excavator goes out see me is 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.190
 hurting 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.870
 this can serve you quite well for 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.780
 those who stay in the area above 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:33.630
 waiting for them to come up for them 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:36.360
 the stage the missile and surely I do not know 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.370
 wait, it's even good enough to 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.770
 avoid the fields because a lot of people 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.500
 climbs up and stays there throughout 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:45.810
 the good game as you can see also 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.239
 I downloaded what we can throw through 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.739
 from any area of the map like bars 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:52.140
 of the soil in this case for example 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:54.239
 crossed the column would also be 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.970
 throw a little bit of imagination and see 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:58.319
 where can we cast the missile and good 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.569
 finally I will show you what I have 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:02.190
 said before I'll catch the climber and 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:04.680
 watch shoots through the roof so that 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:07.410
 I reached the area of the inactive muret and 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.060
 is up and as you can see 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.100
 just what I do is look towards 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.250
 the roof shoot and the climber what 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.269
 goes through and comes out on top 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.250
 so good up here the first 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:20.610
 weapons tutorial soon there will be more 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:23.959
 I hope you liked it and well a 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.959
 greeting and until next time
