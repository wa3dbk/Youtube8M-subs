Americans that would fly over to do his
protocol<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:08.280> thing<00:01:08.490> was<00:01:08.670> is<00:01:08.729> because<00:01:08.880> they

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
protocol the thing was is because they

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.580 
protocol the thing was is because they
were<00:01:09.450> so<00:01:09.689> used<00:01:09.990> to<00:01:11.210> flatten<00:01:12.210> yeah<00:01:13.200> we<00:01:13.350> fly

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
were so used to flatten yeah we fly

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.810 
were so used to flatten yeah we fly
everywhere<00:01:13.890> so<00:01:14.760> he's<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:15.119> using<00:01:15.979> cars<00:01:16.979> that

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
everywhere so he's to using cars that

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.499 
everywhere so he's to using cars that
what<00:01:18.270> would<00:01:18.360> happen<00:01:18.689> is<00:01:18.840> they<00:01:19.020> would<00:01:19.200> go<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:20.509> do

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
what would happen is they would go to do

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.090 
what would happen is they would go to do
some<00:01:21.720> sightseeing<00:01:21.990> and<00:01:22.470> they<00:01:22.560> would<00:01:22.680> do<00:01:22.740> a<00:01:22.770> lot

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
some sightseeing and they would do a lot

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.920 
some sightseeing and they would do a lot
of<00:01:23.130> walking<00:01:23.549> around<00:01:23.640> like<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.450> museums

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
of walking around like to the museums

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.810 
of walking around like to the museums
and<00:01:25.200> whatnot<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:25.680> they<00:01:26.159> actually<00:01:26.490> found<00:01:26.670> that

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
and whatnot and they actually found that

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.480 
and whatnot and they actually found that
they<00:01:27.000> were<00:01:27.030> gaining<00:01:27.450> and<00:01:28.040> it<00:01:29.040> was<00:01:29.159> probably<00:01:29.430> a

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
they were gaining and it was probably a

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.609 
they were gaining and it was probably a
muscle<00:01:29.820> game<00:01:30.000> which<00:01:30.180> is<00:01:30.299> not<00:01:30.450> a<00:01:30.479> bad<00:01:30.570> thing<00:01:30.780> but

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
muscle game which is not a bad thing but

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.350 
muscle game which is not a bad thing but
as<00:01:31.950> far<00:01:32.189> as<00:01:32.250> them<00:01:32.579> being<00:01:32.610> able<00:01:32.970> to<00:01:33.060> see<00:01:33.240> the

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
as far as them being able to see the

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.120 
as far as them being able to see the
release<00:01:33.659> that<00:01:33.869> they<00:01:33.990> want<00:01:34.320> it<00:01:34.650> was

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
release that they want it was

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.240 
release that they want it was
frustrating<00:01:35.369> for<00:01:35.909> them<00:01:36.030> so<00:01:36.979> that's<00:01:37.979> kind<00:01:38.189> of

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
frustrating for them so that's kind of

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.789 
frustrating for them so that's kind of
