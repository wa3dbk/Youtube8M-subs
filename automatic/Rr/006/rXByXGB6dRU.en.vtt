one of my favorite guys he's been a

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.340

little<00:02:21.790> bit<00:02:22.030> exciting<00:02:22.480> in<00:02:22.600> the<00:02:22.660> ring<00:02:22.870> but<00:02:23.080> I<00:02:23.290> I

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
little bit exciting in the ring but I I

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.000 
little bit exciting in the ring but I I
thought<00:02:24.069> that<00:02:24.340> that<00:02:24.959> style<00:02:25.959> of<00:02:26.080> wrestling<00:02:26.350> did

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.170 
thought that that style of wrestling did
from<00:02:27.690> Nitro<00:02:29.160> the<00:02:30.160> looter<00:02:30.640> style<00:02:30.910> I<00:02:31.060> thought

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
from Nitro the looter style I thought

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.500 
from Nitro the looter style I thought
that<00:02:31.240> was<00:02:31.420> just<00:02:31.510> sort<00:02:31.870> of<00:02:31.930> keep<00:02:32.200> your<00:02:32.440> interest

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
while I'm not flipping over to the other

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.110 
while I'm not flipping over to the other
guys<00:02:35.920> I<00:02:36.130> thought<00:02:36.310> it<00:02:36.430> was<00:02:36.520> some<00:02:36.670> sort<00:02:36.910> of<00:02:37.000> like

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
guys I thought it was some sort of like

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.850 
guys I thought it was some sort of like
some<00:02:37.680> crash<00:02:38.680> style<00:02:39.100> wrestling<00:02:40.350> and<00:02:41.350> I<00:02:41.530> never

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
some crash style wrestling and I never

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.410 
some crash style wrestling and I never
thought<00:02:41.980> one<00:02:42.280> of<00:02:42.310> those<00:02:42.459> guys<00:02:42.700> would<00:02:42.970> be<00:02:43.150> a

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
thought one of those guys would be a

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.680

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
have the huge rising star of Alberto Del

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.470 
have the huge rising star of Alberto Del
Rio<00:03:49.890> Alberto<00:03:50.890> Del<00:03:51.370> Rio<00:03:51.519> doesn't<00:03:51.940> really<00:03:52.150> have

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
Rio Alberto Del Rio doesn't really have

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.030 
Rio Alberto Del Rio doesn't really have
the<00:03:52.510> same<00:03:54.959> wrestling<00:03:55.959> style<00:03:56.350> as<00:03:56.620> you<00:03:56.739> can<00:03:56.890> see

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
the same wrestling style as you can see

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.690 
the same wrestling style as you can see
he's<00:03:57.190> more<00:03:57.430> of<00:03:57.730> a<00:03:58.260> wrestlers<00:03:59.260> wrestler<00:03:59.680> but<00:04:00.640> I

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
he's more of a wrestlers wrestler but I

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.449 
he's more of a wrestlers wrestler but I
think<00:04:01.329> that<00:04:01.420> they've<00:04:02.019> got<00:04:02.290> two<00:04:02.590> huge<00:04:02.980> names

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:03.459 
think that they've got two huge names

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:04.800 
think that they've got two huge names
right<00:04:03.700> now<00:04:03.820> and<00:04:03.940> I<00:04:04.000> think<00:04:04.180> that's<00:04:04.329> enough<00:04:04.480> to

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
right now and I think that's enough to

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.430 
right now and I think that's enough to
cover<00:04:05.049> you<00:04:05.799> know<00:04:05.920> the<00:04:06.070> huge<00:04:07.110> market<00:04:08.110> for<00:04:08.140> when

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440 
cover you know the huge market for when

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.400 
cover you know the huge market for when
they<00:04:08.560> go<00:04:08.680> down<00:04:08.709> to<00:04:09.010> Mexico<00:04:09.160> and<00:04:10.109> and<00:04:11.109> when<00:04:11.290> they

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410 
they go down to Mexico and and when they

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.370 
they go down to Mexico and and when they
go<00:04:11.560> into<00:04:11.799> Mexican<00:04:12.670> territories<00:04:13.299> I<00:04:13.540> I<00:04:13.900> think

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:14.380 
go into Mexican territories I I think

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:16.529 
go into Mexican territories I I think
that<00:04:14.590> that's<00:04:14.859> enough<00:04:15.190> star<00:04:15.519> power<00:04:15.549> and<00:04:15.910> effort

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:16.539 
that that's enough star power and effort

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:18.870 
that that's enough star power and effort
