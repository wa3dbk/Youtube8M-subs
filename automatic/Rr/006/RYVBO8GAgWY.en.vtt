couldn't but as a guy explaining how to
do<00:01:01.020> Bain<00:01:01.260> and<00:01:01.559> I<00:01:01.620> thought<00:01:01.800> he<00:01:01.890> explained<00:01:02.190> it

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
do Bain and I thought he explained it

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.479 
do Bain and I thought he explained it
really<00:01:02.460> well<00:01:02.609> said<00:01:03.449> it's<00:01:04.320> sort<00:01:04.890> of<00:01:05.040> like<00:01:05.189> Sean

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
really well said it's sort of like Sean

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.450 
really well said it's sort of like Sean
Connery<00:01:05.790> and<00:01:06.060> someone<00:01:06.420> else<00:01:07.159> and<00:01:08.159> that<00:01:08.310> really

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
Connery and someone else and that really

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.260 
Connery and someone else and that really
that<00:01:08.960> really<00:01:09.960> works<00:01:10.350> I<00:01:11.010> think<00:01:11.460> that<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:12.119> best

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
that really works I think that the best

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.170 
that really works I think that the best
way<00:01:12.450> to<00:01:12.479> do<00:01:12.689> impressions<00:01:13.200> is<00:01:13.320> not<00:01:13.590> I<00:01:14.180> mean

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
way to do impressions is not I mean

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.609 
way to do impressions is not I mean
often<00:01:15.390> you<00:01:15.509> can<00:01:15.659> develop<00:01:15.869> them<00:01:16.140> from<00:01:16.320> scratch

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
often you can develop them from scratch

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.640 
often you can develop them from scratch
but<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.130> problem<00:01:17.430> is<00:01:18.350> celebrities<00:01:19.350> or

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
but the problem is celebrities or

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.359 
but the problem is celebrities or
whoever<00:01:20.549> you're<00:01:20.700> doing<00:01:20.880> an<00:01:20.970> impression<00:01:21.180> of

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:22.369 
whoever you're doing an impression of

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:25.700 
whoever you're doing an impression of
aren't<00:01:24.049> doing<00:01:25.049> an<00:01:25.140> impression<00:01:25.439> because

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
aren't doing an impression because

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.260 
aren't doing an impression because
that's<00:01:25.920> what<00:01:26.159> they<00:01:26.369> sound<00:01:26.610> like<00:01:26.670> naturally

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
that's what they sound like naturally

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.999 
that's what they sound like naturally
but<00:01:27.869> if<00:01:27.930> you<00:01:28.020> see<00:01:28.170> someone<00:01:28.470> else<00:01:28.619> doing<00:01:28.860> an

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
but if you see someone else doing an

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.590 
but if you see someone else doing an
impression<00:01:29.400> then<00:01:29.430> you<00:01:29.610> can<00:01:29.820> compare<00:01:30.329> their

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
impression then you can compare their

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.410 
impression then you can compare their
natural<00:01:31.170> voice<00:01:31.460> with<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.729> finished<00:01:33.240> voice

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
natural voice with the finished voice

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.510 
natural voice with the finished voice
and<00:01:33.840> then<00:01:34.740> you<00:01:34.890> can<00:01:35.040> see<00:01:35.189> what<00:01:35.369> they're

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
and then you can see what they're

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.120 
and then you can see what they're
changing<00:01:36.150> to<00:01:36.960> get<00:01:37.170> there<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:37.470> say<00:01:37.590> okay<00:01:37.979> well

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
changing to get there and say okay well

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.710 
changing to get there and say okay well
if<00:01:38.159> he<00:01:38.310> needs<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:38.610> do<00:01:38.729> that<00:01:38.970> to<00:01:39.210> get<00:01:39.360> to<00:01:39.509> sound

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
if he needs to do that to get to sound

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.200 
if he needs to do that to get to sound
like<00:01:39.869> that<00:01:40.049> that's<00:01:40.860> what<00:01:40.979> I<00:01:41.009> need<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.400> do<00:01:41.549> so

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
like that that's what I need to do so

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.109 
like that that's what I need to do so
often<00:01:43.189> even<00:01:44.189> if<00:01:44.460> it's<00:01:44.579> not<00:01:44.729> a<00:01:44.759> very<00:01:44.970> good

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
often even if it's not a very good

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.850 
often even if it's not a very good
impression<00:01:45.390> still<00:01:46.229> sort<00:01:46.380> of<00:01:46.439> helps<00:01:46.680> you<00:01:46.799> to

so<00:02:15.690> there's<00:02:15.870> a<00:02:15.959> few<00:02:16.140> lines<00:02:16.319> from<00:02:16.530> The<00:02:16.709> Dark

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
so there's a few lines from The Dark

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.990 
so there's a few lines from The Dark
Knight<00:02:17.100> Rises<00:02:17.340> that<00:02:17.670> you'll<00:02:17.850> probably

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
Knight Rises that you'll probably

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.770 
Knight Rises that you'll probably
recognize<00:02:18.300> for<00:02:18.990> example<00:02:19.050> them<00:02:20.390> so<00:02:21.390> if<00:02:21.660> you

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
recognize for example them so if you

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.410 
recognize for example them so if you
just<00:02:22.020> say<00:02:22.200> it<00:02:22.230> in<00:02:22.410> Sean<00:02:22.590> Connery's<00:02:23.010> voice<00:02:23.420> and

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
just say it in Sean Connery's voice and

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:25.699 
just say it in Sean Connery's voice and
then<00:02:24.540> put<00:02:24.750> your<00:02:24.780> hand<00:02:24.990> over<00:02:25.110> it<00:02:25.350> it'll<00:02:25.440> sound

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
then put your hand over it it'll sound

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:30.410 
then put your hand over it it'll sound
like<00:02:25.800> pain<00:02:26.959> so<00:02:28.430> it<00:02:29.430> doesn't<00:02:29.790> matter<00:02:29.940> who<00:02:30.270> we

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
like pain so it doesn't matter who we

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.979 
like pain so it doesn't matter who we
are<00:02:30.560> what<00:02:31.560> matters<00:02:32.040> is<00:02:32.190> our<00:02:32.310> plan<00:02:32.989> crashing

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989

didn't see the light until I was 15 or

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:45.530 
didn't see the light until I was 15 or
perhaps<00:03:41.730> it<00:03:42.060> was<00:03:42.150> wondering<00:03:42.630> why<00:03:42.780> should<00:03:44.540> any

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
perhaps it was wondering why should any

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.930 
perhaps it was wondering why should any
ashes<00:03:46.019> in<00:03:46.140> that<00:03:46.290> or<00:03:47.010> perhaps<00:03:47.190> just<00:03:47.519> wondering

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
ashes in that or perhaps just wondering

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.150 
ashes in that or perhaps just wondering
why<00:03:48.090> someone<00:03:48.420> would<00:03:48.690> shoot<00:03:48.720> a<00:03:49.109> man<00:03:49.320> and<00:03:49.739> then

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
why someone would shoot a man and then

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.800 
why someone would shoot a man and then
not<00:03:50.310> before<00:03:50.760> throwing<00:03:51.030> him<00:03:51.209> out<00:03:51.299> of<00:03:51.450> a<00:03:51.540> plane

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
not before throwing him out of a plane

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.530 
not before throwing him out of a plane
that<00:03:52.350> was<00:03:53.100> crap<00:03:53.430> try<00:03:54.150> that<00:03:54.299> again

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
that was crap try that again

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.810 
that was crap try that again
well<00:03:55.410> perhaps<00:03:55.590> he's<00:03:55.890> wondering<00:03:55.920> why<00:03:56.400> someone

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
well perhaps he's wondering why someone

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.849 
well perhaps he's wondering why someone
would<00:03:56.970> shoot<00:03:57.209> a<00:03:57.359> man<00:03:57.540> before<00:03:57.959> throwing<00:03:58.470> him

00:03:58.849 --> 00:03:58.859 
would shoot a man before throwing him

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:07.759 
would shoot a man before throwing him
out<00:03:58.950> of<00:03:59.100> a<00:03:59.160> plane<00:04:06.079> someone<00:04:07.079> would<00:04:07.230> shoot<00:04:07.440> a<00:04:07.590> man

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:07.769 
out of a plane someone would shoot a man

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:11.800 
out of a plane someone would shoot a man

the water in the world of a plane

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:13.910 
the water in the world of a plane
perhaps<00:04:12.810> she's<00:04:13.019> wondering<00:04:13.470> why<00:04:13.620> someone

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
perhaps she's wondering why someone

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.920 
perhaps she's wondering why someone
would<00:04:14.190> shoot<00:04:14.220> a<00:04:14.459> man<00:04:14.730> before<00:04:15.180> throwing<00:04:15.570> them

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
would shoot a man before throwing them
