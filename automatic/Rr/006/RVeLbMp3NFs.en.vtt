 you brought the floor and we have already 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:18.769
 conversed at the same time to know what 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:20.960
 we can do with a danger because it is 

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:22.909
 something practical that girls said here 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.369
 that was like very elegant for the bed 

00:00:22.909 --> 00:00:26.960
 but you have to be in elegant being what 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:28.579
 what happens that I also said if I do not know 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:35.780
 he wants to put it in the day is not bad 

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:37.580
 neither because this one really is 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.530
 nice that has come out of doing 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:41.990
 color combination is good 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.690
 also yes and it's a modal with a bit of 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:47.330
 cotton sequins plus warm aroy 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.310
 soft uncluttered if for the cam it's 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.110
 ideal that the garment is light clear 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:52.850
 totally good we listen to you with 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.160
 nights spend on weapons well let's 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.420
 start as always tell them quickie 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.130
 so that steps can not create the 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.380
 confection as regards the molds look 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.820
 how easy you bring a mold in one 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.200
 piece what you would have to do 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.430
 with the glass knob they have the 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.100
 trousers 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.470
 close the sides and with a ribbon in 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.900
 the mold already have the whole whole piece 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.580
 I need a simple waist 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.320
 rectangle they have to measure the measure 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.460
 of the waist contour and subtract 10 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.190
 centimeters because we are working 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.260
 dotted fabrics I show you this in 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.780
 As for the pants, I show him as soon as 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:26.210
 to the shirt what we should do 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.250
 dotted line indicates double cloth me here 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.750
 I have my back a mold back 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.390
 base that you have in fabrics of 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.140
 point as for the front 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.850
 just what are they going to do 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.530
 because you know dot fabrics are 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.170
 the same isasi shoulders in workshop 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.030
 was the front neckline line of 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.160
 dots indicates double fabrics also in 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.380
 the sleeves if you can do all three 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:47.030
 rooms if you want or cut because no and 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.710
 I always need a rectangle for this 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.899
 fake wallet because it's a fake 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.750
 good portfolio let's start with the 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:56.000
 armed with the pants as I told them it is 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.640
 an access in one piece is something very 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.160
 simple to perform simply I already 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.899
 I started going to join the shots facing 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.940
 the rights of the fabrics I joined the shots 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:07.039
 front I worked with shoulders if you 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.780
 it has no flight, it can replace it with 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:09.950
 some elastic point that has its 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.340
 sewing machine 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.489
 and likewise we are going to join the shots 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.099
 backs 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:18.560
 once we put together the shots very easy 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:21.290
 let's now close the crotches of 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:24.379
 botamanga botamangas and I'm going to give it 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.180
 turn the right and just that we 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:29.720
 will be left to do when you 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.739
 have joined the crotch things the 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.690
 waist 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:35.599
 I show them the waist action always 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.220
 rectangle that can combine it or not if 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:39.860
 you can scandalize combine it 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:42.590
 as I did then they are going to double that 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:45.730
 rectangle the high to the middle were going to 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:48.860
 notice in this way that we are going to leave 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:51.640
 combined so the waist we will stretch 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.630
 and sew at the waist of the pants 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.970
 simply what will remain for us 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:58.579
 last is to make the hems to the 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:01.130
 boots sleeves of this pants we go with 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:03.709
 the rem the easy plane except the 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:06.890
 T-shirt let's start with the 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:09.590
 back I already started and I started 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.870
 get ahead after the steps I have to the 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.150
 back 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.680
 and do it in three tones you will see 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.450
 You can also simply buy the 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.629
 striped fabric and they're going to have this 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.970
 step if done then let's join 

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:23.950
 the base of the yoke to the center piece 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.349
 facing the rights and the piece 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.450
 lower to the center piece as not 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:31.239
 see them as you can see that I already 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:34.180
 I did it, he left this back in suspense 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:36.010
 and we go with the front piece as 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.349
 to the front piece are going to do 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.840
 exactly the same one the advance of the 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:42.879
 yoke to the center piece facing the 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:46.299
 rights of the fabrics and it is here where 

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:47.890
 let's make this fake portfolio if yes 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:50.049
 It is a rectangle 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.660
 As I told you, we are going to fold in half 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:54.970
 we can mark it with the iron not 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:57.310
 they need to place interlining we double 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:59.590
 half I already have half marked 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:03.310
 of the neckline and half of the base of that 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:06.849
 center piece let's place one side of 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:09.710
 those pickets and we're going to sew sewing 

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:12.490
 straight on foot of machine 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:17.180
 once they do this simply 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:20.840
 we doubled this false portfolio so I 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:23.000
 subject and now let's sew I have 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.430
 that portfolio is still the one we are 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.450
 talking and we're going to sew the piece 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:31.310
 lower facing the rights 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:34.670
 holding the base of that portfolio in this 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:38.870
 sewing look how simple 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:42.290
 we thus sew feet and lower facing 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:44.240
 rights once the centerpiece 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:47.450
 we have this and I have the piece 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:49.940
 front finished we join as always 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:51.980
 we make in dot fabrics back 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:54.110
 front by the shoulders with the strip of 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:56.630
 reinforcements I'm going to put it on 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:58.550
 right but you are going to place as 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:01.250
 I always say the band-aid the effort that 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:03.950
 is 2 centimeters by the measure of the 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:07.100
 long shoulder and should always be cut 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:10.120
 to the thread this pulls next step 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:13.370
 let's cut the sleeves to the armholes 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:16.280
 facing the rights of fabrics 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:19.100
 they close under sleeves and sides 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:21.620
 we realize the hem and they have to 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:24.110
 work the 10 to the contour of the neckline 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:26.630
 how do we do that I show you we can 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:28.550
 use these guides that adapt 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:30.110
 practically family machine 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:32.030
 industrial you can see how 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:34.580
 perform well and are subject to their 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:36.290
 machines with a simple screws and if 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:38.510
 you need it later you can not 

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:41.690
 call and I have where to get them and 

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:46.100
 but something easier we still have to 

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:49.430
 a bandage cut across the width of the fabric 

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:51.710
 so that it will be one centimeter 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:54.919
 or an inch and a half like you 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:57.800
 can you see there we are going to stretch these 

00:05:54.919 --> 00:06:00.860
 strips the modal sang rue the normal look 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:04.010
 how easy is this and we are simply going to 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:06.260
 support the contour of the neckline here we go 

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:08.870
 to cut videos of buyers shopping 

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:11.810
 We cut from the slice of the cloth to 

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:14.330
 twisted in clear we stretched it times a 

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:17.939
 loop and we're going to sew fasten this the 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:22.680
 outline of the entire neckline with 

00:06:17.939 --> 00:06:25.180
 It seems a little bit nice too 

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:27.370
 perfect that we did not realize 

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:29.770
 cuffs to the base and to the cuffs 

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:32.550
 we have this remerita of course 

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:37.150
 placing a few buttons we will give 

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:38.710
 taste a tenth easy practice if a 

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:40.419
 my students really liked the proposal 

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:42.879
 well compensated all of them I do not want 

00:06:40.419 --> 00:06:44.490
 forget so if I do that the signals 

00:06:42.879 --> 00:06:47.050
 they will not want to perform as soon as possible 

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:49.120
 excellent thanks thanks figures 

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:54.300
 being at the next finals and now 

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:54.300
 we continue with carolina laughter and patchwork
