00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:20.230 
available in titanfall just to see how

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:21.960 
available in titanfall just to see how
different<00:00:20.560> they<00:00:20.860> are<00:00:20.890> from<00:00:21.100> other<00:00:21.520> games<00:00:21.880> like

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:21.970 
different they are from other games like

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:24.360 
different they are from other games like
Call<00:00:22.360> of<00:00:22.390> Duty<00:00:22.780> and<00:00:22.810> Battlefield<00:00:23.080> just<00:00:24.040> to<00:00:24.160> see

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:24.370 
Call of Duty and Battlefield just to see

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:26.310 
Call of Duty and Battlefield just to see
if<00:00:24.460> we<00:00:24.580> can<00:00:24.850> spot<00:00:25.270> any<00:00:25.510> similarities<00:00:26.290> or

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:26.320 
if we can spot any similarities or

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.770 
if we can spot any similarities or
differences<00:00:26.920> so<00:00:27.550> I<00:00:27.580> think<00:00:27.730> respawn<00:00:28.450> has<00:00:28.630> done

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:28.780 
differences so I think respawn has done

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:30.870 
differences so I think respawn has done

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
this Titan more overpowered than the

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.650 
this Titan more overpowered than the
walking<00:02:20.800> tank<00:02:21.100> that<00:02:21.310> it<00:02:21.400> already<00:02:21.700> is<00:02:21.880> so<00:02:22.360> first

choice of mod attachment just like the

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.370 
choice of mod attachment just like the
pilot<00:02:33.280> loadout<00:02:33.610> can<00:02:33.850> next<00:02:34.390> is<00:02:34.540> your<00:02:34.870> tactical

pilot loadout can next is your tactical
ability<00:02:35.740> which<00:02:35.920> I<00:02:36.040> think<00:02:36.430> personally<00:02:36.970> is<00:02:37.240> more

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
ability which I think personally is more

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.410 
ability which I think personally is more
of<00:02:38.050> a<00:02:38.200> like<00:02:38.650> defensive<00:02:39.400> ability<00:02:39.820> to<00:02:40.030> protect

of a like defensive ability to protect

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.210 
of a like defensive ability to protect
the<00:02:40.540> Titan<00:02:40.990> you<00:02:41.140> then<00:02:41.290> have<00:02:41.320> your<00:02:41.650> ordnance

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
the Titan you then have your ordnance

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.250 
the Titan you then have your ordnance
this<00:02:42.460> is<00:02:42.580> of<00:02:42.760> course<00:02:42.790> your<00:02:43.420> lethal<00:02:43.720> attack

this is of course your lethal attack

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.350 
this is of course your lethal attack
being<00:02:44.560> able<00:02:44.830> to<00:02:44.920> shoot<00:02:45.160> various<00:02:45.550> Rockets<00:02:46.090> like

certain advantages over others but that

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.110 
certain advantages over others but that
rubs<00:02:59.200> out<00:02:59.350> for<00:02:59.560> both<00:02:59.740> the<00:02:59.950> pilot<00:03:00.280> and<00:03:00.460> Titan

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
rubs out for both the pilot and Titan

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.970 
rubs out for both the pilot and Titan
loadouts<00:03:01.480> and<00:03:01.660> how<00:03:01.780> much<00:03:01.960> customization<00:03:02.470> in

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
loadouts and how much customization in

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.310 
loadouts and how much customization in
titanfall<00:03:03.520> there<00:03:03.850> is<00:03:04.030> as<00:03:04.240> I<00:03:04.570> keep<00:03:04.750> saying<00:03:04.930> very

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.320 
titanfall there is as I keep saying very

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.320 
titanfall there is as I keep saying very
simple<00:03:05.830> but<00:03:05.980> I<00:03:06.070> think<00:03:06.520> it<00:03:06.700> works<00:03:06.970> much<00:03:07.120> better

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
simple but I think it works much better
