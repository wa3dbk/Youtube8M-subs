so<00:00:12.379> because<00:00:13.160> of<00:00:13.369> the<00:00:13.490> number<00:00:13.789> 13<00:00:14.449> was

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:15.670 
so because of the number 13 was

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.540 
so because of the number 13 was
considered<00:00:16.670> a<00:00:16.760> bad<00:00:17.000> omen<00:00:17.619> really<00:00:18.619> do<00:00:18.859> you<00:00:19.369> only

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:19.550 
considered a bad omen really do you only

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:21.970 
considered a bad omen really do you only
have<00:00:19.820> it<00:00:19.849> in<00:00:20.089> their<00:00:20.240> buildings<00:00:20.720> right<00:00:21.109> but

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:21.980 
have it in their buildings right but

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.429 
have it in their buildings right but
it's<00:00:22.789> just<00:00:22.939> an<00:00:23.210> illusion<00:00:23.480> there's<00:00:23.929> 14<00:00:24.470> floors

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:26.439 
it's just an illusion there's 14 floors

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:31.569 
it's just an illusion there's 14 floors
but<00:00:27.439> they<00:00:27.619> use<00:00:27.949> these<00:00:28.480> to<00:00:29.589> try<00:00:30.589> to<00:00:30.650> keep<00:00:31.099> the

00:00:31.569 --> 00:00:31.579 
but they use these to try to keep the

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:34.330 
but they use these to try to keep the
feminine<00:00:32.119> aspects<00:00:33.020> and<00:00:33.350> the<00:00:33.590> spirit<00:00:34.040> of<00:00:34.220> the

feminine aspects and the spirit of the
women<00:00:34.699> down<00:00:36.399> the<00:00:37.399> first<00:00:37.670> thing<00:00:37.910> that<00:00:38.180> we<00:00:38.329> must

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:38.360 
women down the first thing that we must

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.020 
women down the first thing that we must
learn<00:00:38.899> to<00:00:38.960> go<00:00:39.590> back<00:00:39.800> to<00:00:40.070> nature<00:00:40.280> go<00:00:40.640> back<00:00:40.820> to

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.030 
learn to go back to nature go back to

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:42.790 
learn to go back to nature go back to
learning<00:00:41.329> about<00:00:41.570> the<00:00:41.780> Sun<00:00:42.050> the<00:00:42.320> Moon<00:00:42.649> the

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
learning about the Sun the Moon the

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:43.630 
learning about the Sun the Moon the

why<00:00:44.420> because<00:00:45.410> they're<00:00:45.649> gonna<00:00:45.829> get<00:00:46.039> back<00:00:47.469> to

00:00:48.459 --> 00:00:48.469 
why because they're gonna get back to

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:52.209 
why because they're gonna get back to
telling<00:00:48.920> you<00:00:50.260> so<00:00:51.260> that<00:00:51.500> there's<00:00:51.920> something

00:00:52.209 --> 00:00:52.219 
telling you so that there's something

telling you so that there's something
just<00:00:52.820> ain't<00:00:53.300> right<00:00:55.030> so<00:00:56.030> if<00:00:56.149> you<00:00:56.300> listen<00:00:56.629> to

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
just ain't right so if you listen to

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.900 
just ain't right so if you listen to

those birds they're talking about nature

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.610 
those birds they're talking about nature
they're<00:00:59.090> talking<00:00:59.539> about<00:00:59.629> the<00:01:00.469> 13<00:01:01.219> moon<00:01:01.489> cycle

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:02.620 
they're talking about the 13 moon cycle

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.910 
they're talking about the 13 moon cycle
right<00:01:03.620> you<00:01:04.190> women<00:01:04.400> know<00:01:04.550> that<00:01:04.960> when<00:01:05.960> you<00:01:06.080> miss

mothers and also the moon of the heart

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.749 
mothers and also the moon of the heart
so<00:01:43.750> we<00:01:43.869> got<00:01:44.049> those<00:01:44.259> thirty<00:01:44.830> moons<00:01:45.159> and<00:01:45.549> they

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:45.759 
so we got those thirty moons and they

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:49.140 
so we got those thirty moons and they
carried<00:01:46.299> a<00:01:46.540> lot<00:01:47.200> of<00:01:47.650> gifts<00:01:48.070> within<00:01:48.490> that

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.150 
carried a lot of gifts within that

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.649 
carried a lot of gifts within that
structure<00:01:50.009> and<00:01:51.009> the<00:01:51.159> women<00:01:51.490> know<00:01:51.670> this<00:01:51.909> where

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:52.659 
structure and the women know this where

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:54.899 
structure and the women know this where
we<00:01:52.780> got<00:01:53.049> a<00:01:53.080> pinpoint<00:01:53.770> to<00:01:53.920> energy<00:01:54.399> that<00:01:54.670> goes

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:54.909 
we got a pinpoint to energy that goes

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:58.080 
we got a pinpoint to energy that goes
with<00:01:55.240> these<00:01:55.420> moon<00:01:55.750> times<00:01:56.430> we<00:01:57.430> also<00:01:57.610> have

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
with these moon times we also have

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.870 
with these moon times we also have
energy<00:01:58.690> that<00:01:58.990> come<00:01:59.289> from<00:01:59.619> the<00:01:59.890> thirteen<00:02:00.460> new

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
energy that come from the thirteen new

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.649 
energy that come from the thirteen new
moon<00:02:01.210> cycle<00:02:02.250> and<00:02:03.250> we<00:02:03.460> have<00:02:03.700> those<00:02:04.030> that<00:02:04.390> work

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:04.659 
moon cycle and we have those that work

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:08.130 
moon cycle and we have those that work
with<00:02:05.500> the<00:02:05.649> energies<00:02:06.070> of<00:02:06.210> purification<00:02:07.210> than

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
with the energies of purification than

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.400 
with the energies of purification than
that<00:02:08.440> of<00:02:08.850> cooling<00:02:09.850> and<00:02:10.149> that<00:02:10.179> of<00:02:10.479> renewal<00:02:10.959> and

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
that of cooling and that of renewal and

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.190 
that of cooling and that of renewal and
wisdom<00:02:11.920> and<00:02:12.100> enlightenment<00:02:12.569> that<00:02:13.569> of<00:02:13.840> what<00:02:14.050> we

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
wisdom and enlightenment that of what we

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.449 
wisdom and enlightenment that of what we
call<00:02:14.470> life<00:02:16.019> purity<00:02:17.019> innocence<00:02:17.500> and<00:02:17.800> shoes<00:02:18.100> and

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
call life purity innocence and shoes and

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:21.870 
call life purity innocence and shoes and
introspection<00:02:19.209> silence<00:02:20.080> and<00:02:20.350> also<00:02:20.880> reverence

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
introspection silence and also reverence

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.540 
introspection silence and also reverence
and<00:02:22.450> the<00:02:22.630> thirteen<00:02:23.170> gets<00:02:23.500> the<00:02:23.769> unity<00:02:24.340> that

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
and the thirteen gets the unity that

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.090 
and the thirteen gets the unity that
combines<00:02:25.090> everything<00:02:25.390> we<00:02:26.350> call<00:02:26.560> the<00:02:26.709> act<00:02:26.890> of

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
combines everything we call the act of

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.650 
combines everything we call the act of
chronic<00:02:27.870> we<00:02:28.870> have<00:02:29.110> also<00:02:29.620> the<00:02:30.370> thirteen<00:02:31.060> tests

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
chronic we have also the thirteen tests

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.740 
chronic we have also the thirteen tests
of<00:02:31.810> the<00:02:31.959> moon<00:02:32.700> there's<00:02:33.700> a<00:02:33.790> test<00:02:34.150> that<00:02:34.360> goal

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
of the moon there's a test that goal

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.759 
of the moon there's a test that goal
which<00:02:35.049> it<00:02:35.410> was<00:02:35.739> in<00:02:35.920> in<00:02:36.040> each<00:02:36.190> cycle<00:02:37.709> you<00:02:38.709> would

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769 
which it was in in each cycle you would

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:41.400 
which it was in in each cycle you would
like<00:02:39.160> to<00:02:39.400> go<00:02:39.580> back<00:02:39.850> to<00:02:40.209> that<00:02:40.330> cycle<00:02:40.900> because

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410
