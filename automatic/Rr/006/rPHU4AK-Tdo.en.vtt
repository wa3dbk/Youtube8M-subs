00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:05.840 
things about gay people even though she
doesn't<00:05:04.830> think<00:05:05.160> they<00:05:05.370> should<00:05:05.520> be<00:05:05.640> allowed<00:05:05.730> to

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:05.850 
doesn't think they should be allowed to

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:06.650 
doesn't think they should be allowed to
get<00:05:06.060> married

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:06.660 
get married

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:08.510 
get married
so<00:05:06.990> I've<00:05:07.320> been<00:05:07.680> thinking<00:05:07.860> her<00:05:08.250> show<00:05:08.460> is

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520 
so I've been thinking her show is

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.340 
so I've been thinking her show is
probably<00:05:09.060> not<00:05:09.360> going<00:05:09.600> to<00:05:09.690> get<00:05:09.840> canceled

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:10.350 
probably not going to get canceled

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:12.290 
probably not going to get canceled
