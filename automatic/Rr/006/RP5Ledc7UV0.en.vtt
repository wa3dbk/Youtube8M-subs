 of leisure 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.680

 before even thinking about putting dvd player to rehabilitate the patient 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:22.230
 prosthetically 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:25.230
 returning to him at least ten wounded

 today treated 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:34.140
 removing 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.040
 and restoring with resins 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.210
 usually the islands are more aesthetic 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:41.970
 the shapes 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.260

 where it is pointed out that my sick son 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.119
 they should be treated 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.949
 I thought tooth canal culture 

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:13.329
 with the specialty of endodontics 

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:16.239
 when the professional will clean the senate 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:17.050
 good 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:18.569
 and I promise to honor 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:19.430
 closed 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.829
 for later restoration 

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:24.349
 another infection 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:27.659
 usually cut are inflammations 

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:29.209
 nowadays 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:31.259
 that ginger charade 

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:33.909
 reddish 

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:35.499
 be big 

00:02:35.499 --> 00:02:38.029
 should be treated 

00:02:38.029 --> 00:02:41.120
 and thus certified with orthodontic appliances 

00:02:43.179 --> 00:02:44.979
 How's it done? 

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:46.249
 the professional 

00:02:46.249 --> 00:02:49.939
 he removed the reasons of the parties 

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:55.009
 the patient and with a proper brushing technique at times 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.769
 the patient is given chemicals to control the disease what we 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:03.769
 periodontitis at the beginning of the period 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:06.209
 the period 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.789
 if required 

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:11.409
 the subject that according to the leader 

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:12.709
 in the ligament 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:13.799
 between the bone 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:15.879
 he the legend 

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:21.620
 the dentin does not remain directly beating in the rossio x5 periodontal ligament that 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:22.679
 served as a 

00:03:22.679 --> 00:03:24.489
 bumper 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:27.489
 when the occurrence of gingival inflammation 

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:29.509
 Firstly 

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:31.039
 agent of cia 

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:34.099
 and to treat all precious materials 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:37.099
 within the Indies reaching this January 

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:38.710
 which promoted 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:41.279
 asked to be turned off and, consequently, to 

00:03:41.279 --> 00:03:44.569
 beating the ons what sustains that it ensures 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:45.689
 prudent 

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:47.819
 This is good tite. 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:51.349
 we must prevent and deal with the beginning of the recess 

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:55.879
 no we can not put apparatus we can not rehabilitate the patient was 

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:57.859
 virtually 

00:03:57.859 --> 00:03:59.730
 then you have to finish the 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.500
 from 5th edition of the back that would be expensive problem gingival problem 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.610
 of adjacent tissues, all involving infection and inflammation of the mouth to 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:10.739
 he 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:12.629
 we can put 

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:17.699
 orthopedic appliances prosthetic rehabilitation 

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:20.699
 their compositions 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:22.789
 let's control 

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:25.789
 so we bet on the increase in inflammation infection rates 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.539
 Then we can think 

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:30.159
 in rehabilitation 

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:31.360
 prosthetic 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:32.879
 all day 

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:35.969
 and finally the helmet but wants to win 

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:37.259
 aesthetics 

00:04:37.259 --> 00:04:39.770
 the beautiful smile we all look for right? 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:41.169
 so watch well 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:43.919
 your teeth are dead 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:46.150
 we give up on the lodge 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.169
 Vedanta asked. 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:50.860
 orthodontics the fixed appliance 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.259
 she declares 

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:53.680
 position 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.510
 to improve the inclination of the teeth or to orthopedics 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.889
 it takes advantage of the growth of the south 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:02.860
 for they also favored 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:05.029
 the correct positioning 

00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:07.639
 of teeth 

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:11.089
 after all 

00:05:11.089 --> 00:05:12.659
 aligned 

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:16.990
 there we go in that moment of the cearÃ¡ frightened to see with lack of funds 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:20.249
 which have undergone a correction 

00:05:20.249 --> 00:05:23.249
 for prosthetic rehabilitation 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:28.620
 from simple possession through a fixed prosthesis 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:29.480
 supported 

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:31.779
 the stf ministers 

00:05:31.779 --> 00:05:35.339
 and even more advanced treatment like 

00:05:35.339 --> 00:05:38.050
 and bone grafts 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:40.819
 his positioning 

00:05:40.819 --> 00:05:43.110
 which is what is fashionable nowadays 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:44.580
 rehabilitation 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:47.729
 coimbra 10 

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:51.449
 so after almost having gone through all the treatments with your plan 

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:52.400
 initially 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.400
 of corpse and formation of olive trees 

00:05:56.279 --> 00:05:58.830
 during the recess period 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:02.220
 after hypothetical orthodontic rehabilitation 

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:03.550
 Do you think the camera 

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:06.860
 it's all over not yet you do not want more than he wants he wants now 

00:06:07.449 --> 00:06:09.990
 beauty than aesthetics 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:12.990
 At that moment, yes, we will come in the end. 

00:06:13.509 --> 00:06:14.809
 with aesthetics 

00:06:14.809 --> 00:06:18.889
 that today we exchange the yellowish excavations with resins 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:22.150
 highly aesthetic 

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:25.569
 we make porcelain veneers discovering 

00:06:25.569 --> 00:06:28.449
 government darkened teeth 

00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:30.680
 appropriate form 

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:35.220
 what many cassiano done today would be the strategic bbva we do 

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:36.480
 plastic 

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:39.789
 directed to give a more pleasant contour 

00:06:39.789 --> 00:06:41.559
 to the client 

00:06:41.559 --> 00:06:44.400
 finally bleaching 

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:47.960
 nowadays more practiced with the little boy half an hour only he can 

00:06:48.949 --> 00:06:51.279
 excellent results 

00:06:51.279 --> 00:06:52.309
 in the office 

00:06:52.309 --> 00:06:54.289
 when a politician 

00:06:54.289 --> 00:06:55.369
 finally 

00:06:55.369 --> 00:06:56.860
 to complete 

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:59.909
 it is obvious that they do not make it very clear 

00:06:59.909 --> 00:07:02.490
 that the most important treatment today 

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:05.960

00:07:29.399 --> 00:07:32.619
 for the next matter I want to delve into each time 

00:07:33.259 --> 00:07:36.490
 and now earns doubting the cgtp in contact with the essay 

00:07:37.309 --> 00:07:40.409
 we will not get out of the world in every given specialty
