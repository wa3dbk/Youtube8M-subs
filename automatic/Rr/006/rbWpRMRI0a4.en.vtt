00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.440
 good guys how are we seeing 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.610
 these running outings the name is 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.470
 vanquish 6 

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:10.210
 let's talk a little about this 

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:13.300
 chapel of the structure this is another 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:16.450
 aunt and a probe of her previously in 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:18.730
 the entire chapel is composed well 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:20.289
 the white part in any case not the part 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:24.790
 that you appreciate that porosity is a 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:27.910
 mesh full ventilates in hand part of 

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:29.830
 the shoe as we appreciate when giving it 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:32.619
 this turn 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:35.080
 This is a very very flexible shoe 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.430
 because it's been America, sport is not 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:39.160
 a contribution to run with enough 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:41.140
 fraction quite movement and quite 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:44.140
 impact also why he has this 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:46.570
 mold goes in the midsole that what 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:50.340
 does is precisely cushion the 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:53.980
 impacts that we will have along 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:57.220
 something when we run really good the 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:01:00.230
 cuts as we also see in sole if 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:03.170
 for this reflection 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.940
 a better bending also has this 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:08.979
 kind of fact concepts that 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:14.240
 adhere 11 if not exposed are these 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:19.369
 little dots that I know that act on say 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:23.060
 retaining or not ceasing to cease and as 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:26.479
 we see in the heel part too 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.770

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:31.859
 It helps improve 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.170
