00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
 Translated by the CG Portal website: http://kg-portal.ru/ 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:14.280
 From the director, fuck up not one, not two, but three different superheroes: 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.920
 "Catwoman"… 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.020
 …for men. 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:18.540
 "Daredevil." 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.020
 Before Netflix and Marvel Studious merged, 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.160
 To hopefully adequately transfer the hero to the screens ... 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.580
 Return to the early two thousandth. 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.400
 The times when superhero movies were filled with shitty CG ... 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.820
 Matricheskim. 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:33.020
 Soprano. 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.440
 And fuck. 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.740
 Wislon Fisk came tusovatstso! 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.260
 Just released "Pearl Harbor" and "Gigli" ... 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.000
 The least favorite actor of 2003, Ben Affleck, 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.720
 Performs the role of Matt Murdoch. 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:50.720
 The boy, who received superpowers, with all the dope, vmazavsya in a bunch of barrels with terribly dangerous and completely protected toxic waste. 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.620
 Deprived of sight ... 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.480
 He will use the other five senses to see perfectly. 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.920
 But he will continue to dress like a blind man, so that the beauties would sympathize with him. 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:59.480
 What are you ... 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:00.300
 …blind? 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:01.580
 Yes. 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:02.920
 Please forgive me! 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:03.420
 Never mind. 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.160
 And it will also give Affleck a reason to stupidly squint. 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.520
 Oh fight moss! This is Skosigolova! 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.900
 In the afternoon he is a disgusting lawyer. 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.660
 Another rapist returned to freedom. 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.060
 At night, he is Daredevil. 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.740
 The hero, beating those who are not mastered to put behind bars. 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.260
 I was acquitted! 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:24.180
 Not me. 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.360
 And it leaves innocent people dead to have PG13 sex with Jennifer Garner. 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:33.480
 I have to go. 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:34.520
 Stay. 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.360
 Cheer for a superhero who barely surpasses the strength of a regular cop. 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.040
 After all, this "Spider-Man" for the poorest fights crime, 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.320
 Using third-grade abilities such as: 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.740
 Super-jumping. 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.500
 Eerie sniffing. 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.520
 And a super pulsomer. 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.620
 That is, he is a lie-detector with legs, and still can not win in court? 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.640
 Wow. Just ... wow. 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.480
 Accompany Daredevil in his banal, aimless pursuit of justice ... 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:04.960
 There will be Electra Nachios. 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.900
 A girl, half of the movie is needed just to be hot. 

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:10.320
 You're so beautiful. 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.640
 Isn't she pretty? 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.840
 You are beautiful today. 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.700
 I tried for you. 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.800
 So hot that Matt will add harassment and sexual harassment to his ever-growing list of crimes. 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:21.200
 Wait, wait! 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.040
 Give me a sec! Relax! 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:25.980
 I do not like being touched. 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.860
 So tell me what you like - dance from there. 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:28.760
 Is it clear, kids? 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.240
 If a girl doesn't like you ... 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.020
 Beat her until she changes her mind. 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.080
 Behold the least sophisticated superhero movie since Batman and Robin. 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.780
 In which Electra and Daredevil unite in battle with Kingpin: 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.400
 The head of crime, dreaming of becoming ... the head of crime. 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.160
 And labeled. 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.140
 A man who ... 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.640
 Hits a target. 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.980
 If you have not guessed by the fucking sight on his forehead. 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.980
 Tagged! 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.120
 But if you still manage to get confused - do not worry! 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.640
 Ban Affleck will explain everything in a voice-over ... 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.740
 ... sounding like he just came out of a coma. 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.040
 My ear worked in radar style. 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.620
 There are days when I believe. In others I lose all faith. 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.420
 I was going to save this city. 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.800
 But thanks to Electra, I saved myself. 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.200
 ... sorry what? 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:24.880
 Drop down to, in fact, an extremely disappointing sample of Ben Affleck for the role of Batman. 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.540
 Where he plays sad alone. 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.100
 Becomes a fighter against crime after his father was killed in the alley by gangsters. 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.220
 Uses a stupid bat voice when in costume. 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.920
 What do you want? 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:36.340
 Justice 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:37.940
 Stay away from hellish cuisine. 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:39.460
 Uses the cat to move. 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:43.880
 Afraid of bats. 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.040
 And refuses to kill. 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.380
 This is a train! 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.180
 And no, I apologize. 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:55.160
 He also kills. 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:56.600
 I am not a villain. 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:58.820
 Well, a little villain. 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:00.220
 Starring: 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.740
 Soundtrack hammered by the worst metal of the two thousandth. 

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:05.080
 Pod 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:06.360
 Hoobastank 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:07.580
 Seether 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.080
 Drowning Pool 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:10.360
 Evanescence 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.920
 Again Evanescence 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.720
 And nickelback 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.440
 "Betflek: Start." 

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:23.820
 And what is not written in braille?
