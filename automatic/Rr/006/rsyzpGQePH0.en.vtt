00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:29.130
The Jamo R 909 Floorstanding SpeakerDesignWhen
we set about to develop the R 909,

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.820
our mission was to establish new standards
for craftsmanship and performance in

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:35.820
the high end speaker category.

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:36.820
Our quest led us to an open dipolar principle-a
design that has sound from the

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.660
front of the speaker mirrored by the sound
coming from the back.

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.900
The result was an award-winning speaker that
has garnered praise from audiophiles

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:50.860
and sound professionals the world over.

00:01:50.860 --> 00:02:39.050
Our flagship Jamo Reference R 909 audio speaker
not only offers a truly lifelike

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:40.050
listening experience, it reflects Danish design
at its best.

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.050
With its unique open

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:42.050
back and high gloss black and red finishes,
this is one speaker that is as much a

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:47.400
feast for the eyes as for the ears.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.695
The open design also allows you to see the
quality components that make the

00:02:50.695 --> 00:02:51.695
Jamo R 909 so remarkable: two massive 15-inch
woofers, the Hard Conical Cone

00:02:51.695 --> 00:02:52.695
midrange driver and the premium textile dome
tweeter.

00:02:52.695 --> 00:02:53.695
From deep, precise bass to startlingly concert-like
vocals, we've spared no

00:02:53.695 --> 00:02:54.695
expense to deliver sound in its purest form.This
remarkable floor-standing

00:02:54.695 --> 00:02:55.695
loudspeaker is not designed for everyone;
it's for those who demand true high end

00:02:55.695 --> 00:02:56.695
audio performance as well as the ultimate
in stylish, contemporary appearance.

00:02:56.695 --> 00:02:58.850
The Jamo R 909 has been created for the increasing
number of people who prefer a

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.380
two-channel solution for music and a separate
surround sound system for those

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.620
times when they want to watch a movie.
