00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:08.130
 hello everyone today what I bring you today is 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:12.330
 a tutorial on how to remove the nails 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:14.580
 of porcelain made at home and or 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.860
 we have three weeks and I have them 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.599
 those things and good new is removed for 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.670
 record it so I have the fatal nails not 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:23.730
 you fight very much in the first place what 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.859
 what are you going to need is acetone does not matter 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.349
 which is simply the brand that is 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:31.560
 tense but serve any albal paper 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:35.060
 that will then have to be cut into pieces or 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.500
 in strips and last records 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:40.110
 make-up removers you may also need 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.840
 or use scissors or some anima 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.880
 I in my case, I do not use them so 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.579
 let's start the first thing we're going to 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:50.730
 do is cut the paper 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:55.019
 Galvan or silver paper in strips that 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:57.210
 they occupy us put the finger is not necessary 

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:59.879
 that are perfect just like that I 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.850
 as I'm going to cut three wedges there's a 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.729
 remove three nails 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.650
 I'm just going to prepare three pieces 

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:08.420
 what we are going to do is take a disk 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:11.450
 make-up remover does not matter what they use 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:14.600
 pri marque del seff now anyone not 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:17.180
 there is no preference in that I 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.690
 I have already very very long very 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:22.030
 very much I have them 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:24.370
 I do not need I'll cut nor beast 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.980
 if you have recent or recently 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:29.170
 you can file them to remove the 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:31.720
 thickness of the porcelain and cut so that 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.310
 be shorter but it gives me a little 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.290
 afraid to cut them and for that simply 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.970
 I'm going to do it like that so first thing 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:41.340
 what are we going to do is 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:43.660
 and soak the cotton with acetone 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:47.440
 soak it well because against more 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:50.250
 papers easier it is usually removed and 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:53.400
 what I'm going to do is simply 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:56.810
 take the albal paper and roll up the finger 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.810
 in this way 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:02.750
 like when you take off your nails 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:06.950
 zimmer or purpurina have as equal 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:09.520
 and we cover the other nail and we return it to 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.520
 wrap 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.790
 it's very simple process okay so it would be 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.769
 how are the three signs that I'm leaving 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.829
 to remove and what needs to be done now is 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:21.689
 wait at least 15 minutes to say that 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:24.629
 the longer you have fingers like that 

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:28.019
 better and easier will be to remove them or 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:30.420
 remove them so from 15 to 15 minutes 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:32.430
 at 30 years old the thing hard and I'm going to do the 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.829
 first check to see how they go and 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.480
 if I see that they do not like each other or what 

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:38.970
 either we repeat the process again 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.630
 so let's remove this first one from 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:45.230
 Affiliate that such 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:47.210
 for this I see that you still do not see that 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:50.030
 we have still fallen or you can not 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:53.390
 use a cuticle kit a stick 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:55.280
 orange tree to do well and to help you 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.770
 more easily to remove it I am that I am 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.240
 very gross very crazily very impatient and 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.250
 I want to remove it and a little bit with the 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:02.750
 fingers pulling such an end I'm a mess 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:06.440
 for these things because I'm very patient 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:08.330
 ok but as you can see it is not yet 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:11.090
 pretty catchy I'm going to have a little bit 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.710
 more because you 're almost got more I'm going to 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:17.320
 have been here you can also go 

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:17.320
 doing so you can not say and squeezing 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:25.750
 if you see this easily dropped 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:27.700
 just pull and pull and you're done 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.010
 the nail is practically normal this 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:32.830
 need a little more let's see 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:35.310
 we are a little bit would be very stuck 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:38.310
 so fear gives me 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:40.470
 Well look general tour you see well what 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:43.980
 I said 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:45.250
 we throw and as you can see it is worth 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.650
 problems 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.870
