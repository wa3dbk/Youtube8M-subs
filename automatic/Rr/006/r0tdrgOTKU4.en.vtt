00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.660 
pretty easy at the at the north end of
the<00:01:47.250> house<00:01:47.490> I<00:01:47.759> just<00:01:47.970> made<00:01:48.270> it<00:01:48.509> higher<00:01:49.350> and<00:01:49.680> we

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
the house I just made it higher and we

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.819 
the house I just made it higher and we
brought<00:01:50.939> in<00:01:51.149> a<00:01:51.270> lot<00:01:51.450> of<00:01:51.509> dirt<00:01:51.899> so<00:01:52.320> it<00:01:52.500> would<00:01:52.680> be

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
brought in a lot of dirt so it would be

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.249 
brought in a lot of dirt so it would be
natural<00:01:53.070> and<00:01:53.460> says<00:01:53.670> just<00:01:53.909> one<00:01:54.060> becomes<00:01:54.570> in<00:01:54.899> the

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
natural and says just one becomes in the

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.679 
natural and says just one becomes in the
middle<00:01:55.590> and<00:01:55.860> then<00:01:56.369> we<00:01:56.880> kind<00:01:57.060> of<00:01:57.180> played<00:01:57.450> with

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
middle and then we kind of played with

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.990 
middle and then we kind of played with
it<00:01:57.840> and<00:01:57.990> wait<00:01:58.229> laid<00:01:58.590> it<00:01:58.770> out<00:01:58.890> we<00:01:59.159> lay<00:01:59.369> it<00:01:59.549> out<00:01:59.700> we

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
it and wait laid it out we lay it out we

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.899 
it and wait laid it out we lay it out we
painted<00:02:00.960> out<00:02:01.140> on<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.409> ground<00:02:01.649> and<00:02:02.130> come<00:02:02.729> up

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
painted out on the ground and come up

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.209 
painted out on the ground and come up
with<00:02:03.030> an<00:02:03.180> idea<00:02:03.299> and<00:02:03.689> move<00:02:03.990> it<00:02:04.229> and<00:02:04.409> even<00:02:04.890> when

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
with an idea and move it and even when

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:06.830 
with an idea and move it and even when
we're<00:02:05.369> building<00:02:05.579> it<00:02:05.939> we<00:02:06.119> had<00:02:06.270> it<00:02:06.390> built<00:02:06.570> the

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
we're building it we had it built the

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.410 
we're building it we had it built the
hole<00:02:07.020> was<00:02:07.259> much<00:02:07.649> bigger<00:02:07.979> than<00:02:08.129> this<00:02:08.489> and<00:02:09.239> then

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
hole was much bigger than this and then

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.900 
hole was much bigger than this and then
we<00:02:09.509> cut<00:02:09.720> it<00:02:09.840> down<00:02:10.020> and<00:02:10.259> put<00:02:10.410> rocks<00:02:10.649> in<00:02:10.920> and<00:02:11.190> kind

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
we cut it down and put rocks in and kind

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.729 
we cut it down and put rocks in and kind
of<00:02:12.060> played<00:02:12.270> with<00:02:12.480> it<00:02:12.629> as<00:02:12.750> we<00:02:12.959> built<00:02:13.230> it<00:02:13.440> but<00:02:13.650> it

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
of played with it as we built it but it

whole<00:03:12.090> ecosystem<00:03:13.050> is<00:03:13.470> to<00:03:13.769> keep<00:03:14.069> the<00:03:14.430> algae<00:03:15.269> and

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
whole ecosystem is to keep the algae and

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.720 
whole ecosystem is to keep the algae and
chest<00:03:15.810> a<00:03:15.930> little<00:03:15.989> scavengers<00:03:16.739> ankle<00:03:17.190> they<00:03:17.489> are

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
chest a little scavengers ankle they are

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.420 
chest a little scavengers ankle they are
yeah<00:03:18.269> and<00:03:18.870> so<00:03:19.050> keeping<00:03:19.409> it<00:03:19.530> clean<00:03:19.680> is<00:03:20.099> you<00:03:20.310> were

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
yeah and so keeping it clean is you were

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.009 
yeah and so keeping it clean is you were
saying<00:03:20.670> that<00:03:20.849> the<00:03:21.030> the<00:03:21.239> maintenance<00:03:21.629> thing<00:03:21.810> is

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
saying that the the maintenance thing is

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:23.930 
saying that the the maintenance thing is
really<00:03:22.409> low<00:03:22.560> key<00:03:22.830> I<00:03:23.010> mean<00:03:23.190> it's<00:03:23.340> just<00:03:23.430> a<00:03:23.730> matter

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
really low key I mean it's just a matter

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.229 
really low key I mean it's just a matter
of<00:03:24.060> a<00:03:24.420> few<00:03:24.599> minutes<00:03:25.140> in<00:03:25.680> your<00:03:26.220> week<00:03:26.370> growing

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
ecosystem we're really copying mother

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.509 
ecosystem we're really copying mother
nature<00:03:34.680> instead<00:03:35.610> of<00:03:35.819> a<00:03:35.849> cement<00:03:36.480> pond<00:03:36.810> that<00:03:37.200> had

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:37.519 
nature instead of a cement pond that had

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:40.280 
nature instead of a cement pond that had
swimming<00:03:38.519> pool<00:03:38.849> filters<00:03:39.390> really<00:03:39.840> these<00:03:40.230> are
