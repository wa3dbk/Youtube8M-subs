00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
better than I expected I was the one in

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.229 
better than I expected I was the one in
in<00:00:54.780> a<00:00:54.899> past<00:00:55.170> video<00:00:55.440> that<00:00:56.399> was<00:00:56.699> very<00:00:56.940> hesitant

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
in a past video that was very hesitant

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.380 
in a past video that was very hesitant
about<00:00:57.719> this<00:00:58.469> concoction<00:00:59.219> I<00:00:59.699> had<00:01:00.030> heard<00:01:00.210> from

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
about this concoction I had heard from

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.299 
about this concoction I had heard from
folks<00:01:00.629> that<00:01:00.809> it<00:01:00.989> was<00:01:01.140> kind<00:01:01.379> of<00:01:01.440> thick<00:01:01.770> that<00:01:02.219> it

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
folks that it was kind of thick that it

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.390 
folks that it was kind of thick that it
was<00:01:02.430> unpleasant<00:01:03.059> but<00:01:03.210> this<00:01:04.019> isn't<00:01:04.949> it's

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
was unpleasant but this isn't it's

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.660 
was unpleasant but this isn't it's
something<00:01:05.970> um<00:01:06.240> that<00:01:06.780> dr.<00:01:07.680> Toby<00:01:07.920> gave<00:01:08.220> me<00:01:08.520> that

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
something um that dr. Toby gave me that

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.140 
something um that dr. Toby gave me that
I<00:01:08.729> think<00:01:09.030> is<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.420> is<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:10.530> it's<00:01:11.100> very<00:01:11.400> doable

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
I think is the is the it's very doable

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.710 
I think is the is the it's very doable
it's<00:01:12.900> just<00:01:13.470> like<00:01:13.619> any<00:01:13.890> other<00:01:14.100> liquid<00:01:14.460> it<00:01:15.240> has<00:01:15.509> a

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
it's just like any other liquid it has a

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.850 
it's just like any other liquid it has a
tiny<00:01:16.229> bit<00:01:16.439> of<00:01:16.830> possibly<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.759> salty<00:01:18.360> taste<00:01:18.860> I

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
tiny bit of possibly a salty taste I

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.920 
tiny bit of possibly a salty taste I
think<00:01:20.549> Mike<00:01:20.729> pharmacist<00:01:21.270> told<00:01:21.479> me<00:01:21.720> that's

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
think Mike pharmacist told me that's

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.719 
think Mike pharmacist told me that's
because<00:01:22.290> it's<00:01:22.650> got<00:01:22.770> a<00:01:22.830> lot<00:01:23.009> of<00:01:23.040> minerals<00:01:23.310> in<00:01:23.670> it

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
because it's got a lot of minerals in it

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.429 
because it's got a lot of minerals in it
so<00:01:24.390> it's<00:01:24.990> probably<00:01:25.200> good<00:01:25.560> for<00:01:25.770> me<00:01:25.950> at<00:01:26.250> my<00:01:26.490> last

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:27.439 
so it's probably good for me at my last

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:30.109 
so it's probably good for me at my last
concoction<00:01:28.439> I<00:01:28.560> have<00:01:28.799> a<00:01:28.829> name<00:01:29.070> for<00:01:29.369> it<00:01:29.549> it<00:01:29.670> is<00:01:30.090> a
