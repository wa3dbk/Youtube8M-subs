00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.360 
on my arm a little bit and you can
actually<00:03:03.240> get<00:03:04.020> some<00:03:04.080> hairs<00:03:04.470> off<00:03:04.709> of<00:03:04.890> that<00:03:05.040> and

sharpen<00:03:07.200> this<00:03:07.260> whatsoever<00:03:07.620> on<00:03:08.370> the

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
sharpen this whatsoever on the

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.880 
sharpen this whatsoever on the
serrations<00:03:08.910> as<00:03:09.360> well<00:03:09.750> are<00:03:10.080> very<00:03:10.470> very<00:03:10.709> sharp

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
serrations as well are very very sharp

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.199 
serrations as well are very very sharp
they're<00:03:11.160> very<00:03:11.310> very<00:03:11.430> fine<00:03:11.790> that's<00:03:12.060> what<00:03:12.180> I

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
they're very very fine that's what I

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.259 
they're very very fine that's what I
thought<00:03:12.660> was<00:03:12.840> kind<00:03:13.020> of<00:03:13.080> interesting<00:03:13.140> is<00:03:13.800> that

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:14.269 
thought was kind of interesting is that

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:17.150 
thought was kind of interesting is that
you<00:03:15.269> know<00:03:15.330> there'd<00:03:15.630> I've<00:03:16.500> not<00:03:16.830> really<00:03:17.130> seen

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
you know there'd I've not really seen

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.340 
you know there'd I've not really seen
this<00:03:17.550> kind<00:03:17.790> of<00:03:17.910> design<00:03:18.239> I<00:03:18.269> mean<00:03:18.510> if<00:03:18.660> kind<00:03:18.959> of<00:03:19.140> I

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
this kind of design I mean if kind of I

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:20.870 
this kind of design I mean if kind of I
guess<00:03:19.590> but<00:03:20.010> they<00:03:20.220> just<00:03:20.400> seem<00:03:20.550> a<00:03:20.610> lot<00:03:20.820> more

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
guess but they just seem a lot more

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.360 
guess but they just seem a lot more
finer<00:03:21.630> and<00:03:21.959> a<00:03:22.110> lot<00:03:22.590> more<00:03:22.620> close<00:03:23.010> together

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
finer and a lot more close together

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.340 
finer and a lot more close together
which<00:03:23.700> is<00:03:23.910> nothing<00:03:24.570> bad<00:03:24.750> or<00:03:24.989> anything<00:03:25.050> like

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
which is nothing bad or anything like

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.050 
which is nothing bad or anything like
that<00:03:25.380> it's<00:03:25.769> just<00:03:26.100> I<00:03:26.250> guess<00:03:26.610> a<00:03:26.640> different

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
that it's just I guess a different

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.229 
that it's just I guess a different
feature<00:03:27.450> of<00:03:27.630> this<00:03:27.720> knife<00:03:27.930> and<00:03:28.170> read<00:03:29.100> down<00:03:29.730> here

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239

feature of this knife and read down here
I'm<00:03:30.890> glassing<00:03:31.890> I<00:03:32.010> don't<00:03:32.220> know<00:03:32.280> exactly<00:03:32.730> what

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
I'm glassing I don't know exactly what

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.430 
I'm glassing I don't know exactly what
this<00:03:33.000> Forks<00:03:33.420> it<00:03:33.600> wasn't<00:03:33.870> really<00:03:34.019> described

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
this Forks it wasn't really described

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.530 
this Forks it wasn't really described
but<00:03:34.680> I<00:03:34.709> think<00:03:35.220> that<00:03:35.880> you<00:03:35.940> could<00:03:36.120> probably<00:03:36.269> use

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
but I think that you could probably use

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.570 
but I think that you could probably use
this<00:03:36.660> as<00:03:36.840> you<00:03:37.110> know<00:03:37.230> maybe<00:03:37.650> a<00:03:37.800> glass<00:03:38.040> breaker

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
this as you know maybe a glass breaker

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.170 
this as you know maybe a glass breaker
I'm<00:03:38.670> not<00:03:38.820> too<00:03:39.030> sure<00:03:39.209> exactly<00:03:39.650> it's<00:03:40.650> uh<00:03:40.800> I<00:03:41.400> may

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
I'm not too sure exactly it's uh I may

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.090 
I'm not too sure exactly it's uh I may
be<00:03:42.239> just<00:03:42.480> there<00:03:42.660> for<00:03:42.900> style<00:03:43.230> not<00:03:43.709> too<00:03:43.920> sure

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
be just there for style not too sure

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.870 
be just there for style not too sure
really<00:03:44.570> as<00:03:45.570> well<00:03:46.170> you<00:03:46.470> have<00:03:46.650> a<00:03:46.680> lanyard<00:03:47.550> hole

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:59.570 
know make sure doesn't fall around but
other<00:03:57.840> than<00:03:57.989> that<00:03:58.080> she<00:03:58.980> was<00:03:59.010> really<00:03:59.250> short

00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.580 
other than that she was really short

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:00.949 
other than that she was really short
with<00:03:59.730> you<00:03:59.880> because<00:04:00.090> it's<00:04:00.330> really<00:04:00.570> not<00:04:00.720> much<00:04:00.900> to

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
with you because it's really not much to

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:02.509 
with you because it's really not much to
say<00:04:01.290> about<00:04:01.410> this<00:04:01.769> because<00:04:01.920> it's<00:04:02.130> pretty<00:04:02.190> basic

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
say about this because it's pretty basic

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:06.470 
say about this because it's pretty basic
this<00:04:02.880> knife<00:04:03.060> it's<00:04:03.750> very<00:04:03.959> very<00:04:04.200> nice<00:04:05.150> 2495<00:04:06.150> is

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
this knife it's very very nice 2495 is

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.710 
this knife it's very very nice 2495 is
what<00:04:06.690> is<00:04:06.930> on<00:04:07.320> the<00:04:07.590> bokor<00:04:08.100> website<00:04:08.640> I<00:04:08.850> probably

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
what is on the bokor website I probably

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.960 
what is on the bokor website I probably
pay<00:04:09.870> a<00:04:09.900> bit<00:04:10.140> more<00:04:10.170> actually<00:04:10.890> just<00:04:11.640> because

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
pay a bit more actually just because

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.240 
pay a bit more actually just because
this<00:04:12.209> knife<00:04:12.540> seems<00:04:12.780> pretty<00:04:13.019> good<00:04:13.290> it's<00:04:14.070> more

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
this knife seems pretty good it's more

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:15.440 
this knife seems pretty good it's more
of<00:04:14.310> a<00:04:14.370> defensive<00:04:14.610> knife<00:04:15.000> it<00:04:15.180> probably

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
of a defensive knife it probably

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.920 
of a defensive knife it probably
wouldn't<00:04:15.600> use<00:04:15.720> is<00:04:15.870> for<00:04:16.049> utility<00:04:16.560> what<00:04:16.769> would

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
wouldn't use is for utility what would

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.849 
wouldn't use is for utility what would
not<00:04:18.930> sorry<00:04:19.470> and<00:04:19.620> whatnot

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:21.859 
not sorry and whatnot

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:24.670 
not sorry and whatnot
it's<00:04:22.099> a<00:04:22.610> little<00:04:22.879> bit<00:04:23.000> thin<00:04:23.419> to<00:04:23.720> be<00:04:24.020> using<00:04:24.440> for

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
it's a little bit thin to be using for

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.680 
it's a little bit thin to be using for
you<00:04:24.800> know<00:04:24.919> chopping<00:04:25.460> and<00:04:25.610> all<00:04:25.699> that<00:04:25.970> but<00:04:26.300> in

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
you know chopping and all that but in

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.170 
you know chopping and all that but in
the<00:04:26.870> event<00:04:27.560> that<00:04:27.620> you<00:04:27.830> may<00:04:28.310> be<00:04:28.370> slicing<00:04:29.060> or

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
the event that you may be slicing or

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.059 
the event that you may be slicing or
something<00:04:29.509> like<00:04:29.629> that

00:04:31.059 --> 00:04:31.069 
something like that

00:04:31.069 --> 00:04:33.490 
something like that
self-defense<00:04:32.000> role<00:04:32.330> this<00:04:32.780> probably<00:04:33.229> would<00:04:33.379> be

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:33.500 
self-defense role this probably would be

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.219 
self-defense role this probably would be
the<00:04:33.530> best<00:04:33.680> bat<00:04:34.610> for<00:04:34.940> it<00:04:35.030> as<00:04:35.360> well<00:04:35.840> one<00:04:36.050> thing

00:04:36.219 --> 00:04:36.229 
the best bat for it as well one thing

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:39.309 
the best bat for it as well one thing
that<00:04:36.259> I<00:04:36.379> do<00:04:36.440> like<00:04:36.680> both<00:04:36.860> this<00:04:37.129> is<00:04:37.340> the<00:04:38.319> finger

00:04:39.309 --> 00:04:39.319 
that I do like both this is the finger

00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:42.309 
that I do like both this is the finger
guards<00:04:39.620> there<00:04:39.770> too<00:04:40.449> it's<00:04:41.449> perfect<00:04:41.930> I<00:04:42.080> mean<00:04:42.169> you

00:04:42.309 --> 00:04:42.319 
guards there too it's perfect I mean you

00:04:42.319 --> 00:04:44.230 
guards there too it's perfect I mean you
can<00:04:42.470> switch<00:04:42.860> hands<00:04:43.129> for<00:04:43.400> everyone<00:04:43.490> if<00:04:44.150> you

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 
can switch hands for everyone if you

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.200 
can switch hands for everyone if you
want<00:04:44.360> your<00:04:44.569> thumb<00:04:44.810> here<00:04:45.259> and<00:04:45.490> your<00:04:46.490> index

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.210 
want your thumb here and your index

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:49.779 
want your thumb here and your index
finger<00:04:47.539> down<00:04:47.690> there<00:04:47.960> it<00:04:48.860> really<00:04:49.250> holds<00:04:49.460> it<00:04:49.669> in

00:04:49.779 --> 00:04:49.789 
finger down there it really holds it in

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:50.020 
finger down there it really holds it in
place

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 
place

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:52.600 
place
so<00:04:50.270> if<00:04:50.449> in<00:04:50.780> the<00:04:50.960> event<00:04:51.229> that<00:04:51.319> maybe<00:04:51.650> you<00:04:52.039> jabbed

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:52.610 
so if in the event that maybe you jabbed

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:54.610 
so if in the event that maybe you jabbed
it<00:04:52.759> into<00:04:52.970> something<00:04:53.300> you<00:04:53.930> can<00:04:54.110> really<00:04:54.379> put<00:04:54.590> a

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:54.620 
it into something you can really put a

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:56.140 
it into something you can really put a
lot<00:04:54.680> of<00:04:54.919> force<00:04:55.099> into<00:04:55.550> it<00:04:55.580> without<00:04:55.849> your

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.150 
lot of force into it without your

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.140 
lot of force into it without your
fingers<00:04:56.509> moving<00:04:56.750> forward<00:04:57.520> on<00:04:58.520> both<00:04:58.789> of<00:04:59.000> them

00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.150 
fingers moving forward on both of them

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:00.520 
fingers moving forward on both of them
they<00:04:59.479> won't<00:04:59.629> move<00:04:59.840> forward<00:05:00.139> whatsoever

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:00.530 
they won't move forward whatsoever

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:03.129 
they won't move forward whatsoever
because<00:05:00.949> this<00:05:01.129> is<00:05:01.370> great<00:05:02.210> design<00:05:02.569> actually<00:05:02.900> I

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:03.139 
because this is great design actually I

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:04.570 
because this is great design actually I
mean<00:05:03.590> you<00:05:03.740> can<00:05:03.830> switch<00:05:04.069> it<00:05:04.099> maybe<00:05:04.340> you<00:05:04.460> want

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:04.580 
mean you can switch it maybe you want

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:06.189 
mean you can switch it maybe you want
your<00:05:04.729> thumb<00:05:05.449> like<00:05:05.599> that<00:05:05.810> and<00:05:05.930> your<00:05:06.020> index

00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:06.199 
your thumb like that and your index

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:07.029 
your thumb like that and your index
finger<00:05:06.500> down<00:05:06.650> there

00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:07.039 
finger down there

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:10.450 
finger down there
personally<00:05:07.789> I<00:05:07.819> prefer<00:05:07.849> it<00:05:08.180> like<00:05:08.330> that<00:05:09.460> perfect

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:10.460 
personally I prefer it like that perfect

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.209 
personally I prefer it like that perfect
I<00:05:10.759> think<00:05:10.849> this<00:05:11.120> is<00:05:11.240> actually<00:05:11.599> very<00:05:11.629> good

00:05:12.209 --> 00:05:12.219 
I think this is actually very good

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:15.430 
I think this is actually very good
definitely<00:05:13.219> worth<00:05:13.370> the<00:05:13.400> money<00:05:13.610> for<00:05:14.289> just<00:05:15.289> this

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:15.440 
definitely worth the money for just this

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.029 
definitely worth the money for just this
knife<00:05:15.680> itself<00:05:16.069> good<00:05:16.430> for<00:05:16.610> defensive<00:05:17.090> roles

00:05:18.029 --> 00:05:18.039 
knife itself good for defensive roles

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:21.550 
knife itself good for defensive roles
not<00:05:19.039> so<00:05:19.430> much<00:05:19.639> utility<00:05:20.210> just<00:05:20.690> because<00:05:21.020> of<00:05:21.199> its

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:21.560 
not so much utility just because of its

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.830 
not so much utility just because of its
it's<00:05:22.250> not<00:05:22.490> that<00:05:22.699> thick<00:05:23.090> so<00:05:23.389> I<00:05:23.449> wouldn't<00:05:23.780> be

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:23.840 
it's not that thick so I wouldn't be

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.290 
it's not that thick so I wouldn't be
prying<00:05:24.289> or<00:05:24.740> chopping<00:05:25.639> or<00:05:25.819> anything<00:05:26.000> like<00:05:26.240> that

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:26.300 
prying or chopping or anything like that

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:27.670 
prying or chopping or anything like that
you<00:05:26.569> normally<00:05:26.870> wouldn't<00:05:27.020> chop<00:05:27.289> with<00:05:27.440> a<00:05:27.500> deck

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:27.680 
you normally wouldn't chop with a deck

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.879 
you normally wouldn't chop with a deck
or<00:05:27.889> anyways<00:05:28.219> but<00:05:29.020> if<00:05:30.020> you<00:05:30.110> need<00:05:30.259> some<00:05:30.500> you<00:05:30.770> know

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:30.889 
or anyways but if you need some you know

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:33.730 
or anyways but if you need some you know
just<00:05:31.520> a<00:05:31.669> good<00:05:31.969> defensive<00:05:32.479> role<00:05:32.690> it's<00:05:33.500> a<00:05:33.529> little

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:33.740 
just a good defensive role it's a little

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:36.189 
just a good defensive role it's a little
bit<00:05:33.860> big<00:05:34.159> to<00:05:34.610> conceal<00:05:35.419> like<00:05:35.870> it's<00:05:36.050> not<00:05:36.139> a

00:05:36.189 --> 00:05:36.199 
bit big to conceal like it's not a

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:37.540 
bit big to conceal like it's not a
pocket<00:05:36.469> knife<00:05:36.710> or<00:05:36.860> anything<00:05:37.009> like<00:05:37.190> that<00:05:37.250> like

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:37.550 
pocket knife or anything like that like

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:39.730 
pocket knife or anything like that like
I<00:05:37.789> said<00:05:37.819> it's<00:05:38.180> about<00:05:38.270> it's<00:05:38.900> almost<00:05:39.139> 12<00:05:39.409> inches

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:39.740 
I said it's about it's almost 12 inches

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:42.550 
I said it's about it's almost 12 inches
so<00:05:40.120> this<00:05:41.120> is<00:05:41.330> actually<00:05:41.719> pretty<00:05:41.870> good<00:05:41.960> fixed

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:42.560 
so this is actually pretty good fixed

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:44.980 
so this is actually pretty good fixed
blade<00:05:43.300> that<00:05:44.300> you<00:05:44.360> might<00:05:44.539> want<00:05:44.719> to<00:05:44.779> carry

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:44.990 
blade that you might want to carry

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:33.200 
and I think this is the only option you

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:34.690 
and I think this is the only option you
really<00:06:33.500> have<00:06:33.680> like<00:06:33.980> there's<00:06:34.160> no<00:06:34.250> other<00:06:34.400> like

really have like there's no other like

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:37.270 
really have like there's no other like
options<00:06:35.240> where<00:06:35.390> you<00:06:35.420> can<00:06:35.570> have<00:06:35.830> both<00:06:36.830> serrated

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:37.280 
options where you can have both serrated

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:39.580 
options where you can have both serrated
sides<00:06:37.730> or<00:06:38.000> anything<00:06:38.060> like<00:06:38.420> that<00:06:38.480> this<00:06:38.840> is<00:06:38.900> this

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:39.590 
sides or anything like that this is this

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:41.020 
sides or anything like that this is this
is<00:06:39.740> pretty<00:06:39.890> much<00:06:40.070> the<00:06:40.280> only<00:06:40.310> real<00:06:40.700> deal<00:06:40.940> I
