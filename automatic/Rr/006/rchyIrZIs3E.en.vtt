00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:22.500
 finish 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.540
 We leave the flying car and accompany Carlos with a very special class 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.200
 in which we will use the capote and the crutch to exercise 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.290
 it's called taoro pilates and according to its creators it's a public way and 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.940
 exciting in expressing feelings 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.840
 excuse both the body and the mind 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.360
 for ignacio the world of the bull is his life for it after leaving aside the 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.170
 bullfighting for two years one day he thought he could turn bullfighting into 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:51.700
 a sports practice 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.130

 possibilities ignacio the text develop this idea next to marc 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.520
 directors of this sevilla gym I thought it would be dollars per year 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.340
 and says that technique would be the one that would best adapt to the classroom bullfighting 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:11.989
 sports modality no 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:16.290
 late gravity of what the pilates had to be by posture the 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.290
 breathing concentration and the artistic part 

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:24.909
 the job of him promises the pupils who novillero in front of the bull 

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:29.569
 feeling and heart to each crutch pass the hood on the crutch the color 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:31.089
 flamenco music 

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:34.540
 and a little bit the interpretative part that we put to the class 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.629
 as far as people get a little bit side by side in 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:42.249
 and good to feel bullfighter to mouth of sao paulo the diva in the afternoon 

00:02:42.249 --> 00:02:46.679

00:02:46.679 --> 00:02:51.249
 adapt the movements of salon bullfighting to the benefits of pilates 

00:02:51.249 --> 00:02:53.010
 that the winner of the third 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.720
 the device itself 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.520
 per cent despite the position that bullfighters actually have in the back 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.119
 that we do well the opposite 

00:03:01.119 --> 00:03:03.389
 I think we should have all 

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:07.259
 Pablo Pilates art and emotion turned into sport 

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:11.099
 one more example that it is possible to keep the body and mind in shape 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:15.609
