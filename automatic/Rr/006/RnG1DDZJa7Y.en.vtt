00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
between flights now and I was just saw a

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.560 
between flights now and I was just saw a
video<00:00:13.980> by<00:00:14.190> sethbling<00:00:14.639> with<00:00:14.880> custom<00:00:15.240> sounds

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
video by sethbling with custom sounds

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.480 
video by sethbling with custom sounds
and<00:00:15.719> I<00:00:15.780> realized<00:00:16.109> it<00:00:16.289> is<00:00:16.410> a<00:00:16.710> cool<00:00:17.130> way<00:00:17.460> to

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
and I realized it is a cool way to

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:18.980 
and I realized it is a cool way to
actually<00:00:18.060> use<00:00:18.240> this<00:00:18.420> so<00:00:18.570> what<00:00:18.690> I'm<00:00:18.779> going<00:00:18.960> to

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
actually use this so what I'm going to

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.580 
actually use this so what I'm going to
do<00:00:19.140> is<00:00:19.230> I'm<00:00:19.410> going<00:00:19.619> to<00:00:20.480> make<00:00:21.480> it<00:00:21.869> so<00:00:22.140> that<00:00:22.170> when

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
do is I'm going to make it so that when

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.580 
do is I'm going to make it so that when
a<00:00:22.650> player<00:00:23.100> dies<00:00:23.490> it<00:00:24.180> plays<00:00:24.539> a<00:00:24.570> custom<00:00:25.289> death

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
a player dies it plays a custom death

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.620 
a player dies it plays a custom death
sound<00:00:25.980> now<00:00:26.430> at<00:00:26.490> this<00:00:26.640> moment<00:00:26.789> I<00:00:27.090> don't<00:00:27.269> have

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
sound now at this moment I don't have

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.540 
sound now at this moment I don't have
time<00:00:27.810> to<00:00:27.960> actually<00:00:28.050> record<00:00:28.529> a<00:00:28.859> custom<00:00:29.279> sounds

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
time to actually record a custom sounds

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.310 
time to actually record a custom sounds
myself<00:00:29.910> something<00:00:30.210> I'm<00:00:30.570> just<00:00:30.630> going<00:00:30.990> to<00:00:31.050> be

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
myself something I'm just going to be

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.010 
myself something I'm just going to be
using<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:31.830> ghost<00:00:32.300> sound<00:00:33.300> so<00:00:33.540> this<00:00:33.690> is<00:00:33.780> what<00:00:33.930> it

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
using the ghost sound so this is what it

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.139 
using the ghost sound so this is what it
will<00:00:34.110> sound<00:00:34.290> like<00:00:37.399> so<00:00:38.399> this<00:00:38.460> is<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.700> gas<00:00:38.910> the

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
will sound like so this is the gas the

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.549 
will sound like so this is the gas the
screen<00:00:39.510> that<00:00:39.690> will<00:00:39.780> happen<00:00:40.110> when<00:00:40.260> a<00:00:40.290> player

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
screen that will happen when a player

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.290 
screen that will happen when a player
dies<00:00:40.800> so<00:00:41.370> first<00:00:41.579> thing<00:00:41.730> we<00:00:41.820> want<00:00:42.000> to<00:00:42.030> do<00:00:42.149> is<00:00:42.210> we

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
to make this very very straightforward

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.280 
to make this very very straightforward
very<00:01:22.740> simple<00:01:23.009> I'm<00:01:23.520> just<00:01:23.549> going<00:01:23.939> to<00:01:24.110> use<00:01:25.110> this

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
very simple I'm just going to use this

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.200 
very simple I'm just going to use this
clock<00:01:25.590> over<00:01:25.799> here<00:01:26.130> again<00:01:26.700> I'm<00:01:26.820> gonna<00:01:26.939> take<00:01:27.150> a

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
clock over here again I'm gonna take a

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.120 
clock over here again I'm gonna take a
signal<00:01:27.509> out<00:01:27.750> of<00:01:27.810> this<00:01:27.960> clock<00:01:28.200> so<00:01:28.829> what<00:01:28.979> this

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
signal out of this clock so what this

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.340 
signal out of this clock so what this
clock<00:01:29.400> is<00:01:29.579> gonna<00:01:29.820> do<00:01:30.090> is<00:01:30.270> constantly<00:01:30.960> test

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
clock is gonna do is constantly test

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.810 
clock is gonna do is constantly test
actually<00:01:31.860> you<00:01:31.920> know<00:01:32.009> what<00:01:32.159> I'm<00:01:32.310> already<00:01:32.610> got

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
actually you know what I'm already got

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.249 
actually you know what I'm already got
this<00:01:32.939> hot<00:01:33.060> off<00:01:33.240> set<00:01:33.450> of<00:01:33.540> generators<00:01:33.810> do<00:01:34.170> it

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
this hot off set of generators do it

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.499 
this hot off set of generators do it
this<00:01:34.320> way<00:01:34.500> right<00:01:35.310> it's<00:01:35.729> gonna<00:01:35.909> constantly

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
this way right it's gonna constantly

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.190 
this way right it's gonna constantly
test<00:01:36.840> if<00:01:37.079> somebody<00:01:37.590> has<00:01:38.009> a<00:01:38.040> death<00:01:38.430> score<00:01:38.909> of<00:01:39.200> 1

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
test if somebody has a death score of 1

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.170 
test if somebody has a death score of 1
okay<00:01:40.979> so<00:01:41.009> what<00:01:41.400> are<00:01:41.460> we<00:01:41.549> going<00:01:41.670> to<00:01:41.759> do<00:01:41.850> and<00:01:42.000> then

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
okay so what are we going to do and then

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.600 
okay so what are we going to do and then
if<00:01:42.390> somebody<00:01:42.899> does<00:01:43.229> have<00:01:43.259> a<00:01:43.500> death<00:01:43.770> score<00:01:44.189> of<00:01:44.340> 1

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
if somebody does have a death score of 1

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.270 
if somebody does have a death score of 1
we<00:01:45.030> are<00:01:45.149> then<00:01:45.329> going<00:01:45.360> to<00:01:45.659> play<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.229> sound<00:01:46.439> okay

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
we are then going to play the sound okay

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.460 
we are then going to play the sound okay
so<00:01:48.649> it<00:01:49.649> is<00:01:49.710> play<00:01:50.570> sound<00:01:51.570> so<00:01:51.869> this<00:01:51.990> is<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.290> new

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
so it is play sound so this is the new

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.550 
so it is play sound so this is the new
command<00:01:52.860> play<00:01:53.189> sound<00:01:53.610> and<00:01:53.850> then<00:01:54.090> you<00:01:54.119> need<00:01:54.360> to

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
command play sound and then you need to

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.730 
command play sound and then you need to
you<00:01:55.560> need<00:01:55.710> to<00:01:55.770> then<00:01:55.890> put<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:57.140> path<00:01:58.140> to<00:01:58.619> the

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
you need to then put the path to the

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:04.069 
you need to then put the path to the
sound<00:01:59.009> which<00:01:59.310> is<00:01:59.570> mob<00:02:00.570> dot<00:02:01.560> last<00:02:02.399> dot<00:02:03.240> scream

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
sound which is mob dot last dot scream

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.620 
sound which is mob dot last dot scream
and<00:02:04.530> then<00:02:05.219> you<00:02:05.310> say<00:02:05.579> at<00:02:05.790> player<00:02:06.149> so<00:02:06.420> let<00:02:06.540> me

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
and then you say at player so let me

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.969 
and then you say at player so let me
just<00:02:06.810> see<00:02:06.899> if<00:02:06.960> this<00:02:07.110> is<00:02:07.170> done<00:02:07.439> correctly

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
just see if this is done correctly

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.550 
just see if this is done correctly
okay<00:02:09.979> and<00:02:10.220> then<00:02:10.340> we<00:02:10.490> go<00:02:10.640> a<00:02:11.240> player<00:02:11.959> who<00:02:12.290> has<00:02:12.530> a

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
okay and then we go a player who has a

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.600 
okay and then we go a player who has a
score<00:02:13.310> underscore<00:02:13.910> deaths<00:02:14.950> does<00:02:15.950> a<00:02:16.160> death<00:02:16.400> or

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
score underscore deaths does a death or

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.309 
score underscore deaths does a death or
death<00:02:16.819> death<00:02:19.180> underscore<00:02:20.180> minimum<00:02:20.600> equals

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
death death underscore minimum equals

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:38.140 
death death underscore minimum equals
one<00:02:21.650> okay<00:02:23.020> so<00:02:24.020> now<00:02:36.580> that's<00:02:37.580> gonna<00:02:37.730> drive<00:02:37.970> us

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
one okay so now that's gonna drive us

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.270 
one okay so now that's gonna drive us
mad<00:02:38.180> so<00:02:38.989> I'm<00:02:39.050> gonna<00:02:39.200> drop<00:02:39.410> another<00:02:39.739> comparator

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
mad so I'm gonna drop another comparator

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.340 
mad so I'm gonna drop another comparator
yeah<00:02:40.640> and<00:02:40.760> I'm<00:02:40.820> just<00:02:40.850> gonna<00:02:41.840> say<00:02:42.220> scoreboard

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
yeah and I'm just gonna say scoreboard

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:52.330 
yeah and I'm just gonna say scoreboard
scoreboard<00:02:47.530> players<00:02:48.820> set<00:02:50.320> @p<00:02:51.340> score

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
scoreboard players set @p score

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.030 
scoreboard players set @p score
underscore<00:02:53.470> deaths<00:02:54.730> and<00:02:55.730> the<00:02:55.850> school<00:02:56.090> minimum

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
underscore deaths and the school minimum

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:05.020 
underscore deaths and the school minimum
equals<00:02:58.040> one<00:02:59.440> death<00:03:02.800> zero<00:03:03.800> okay<00:03:04.700> so<00:03:04.760> basically

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
equals one death zero okay so basically

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.479 
equals one death zero okay so basically
what<00:03:05.239> I'm<00:03:05.540> doing<00:03:05.959> is<00:03:06.500> I'm<00:03:06.739> checking<00:03:07.040> to<00:03:07.190> see<00:03:07.459> if

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:07.489 
what I'm doing is I'm checking to see if

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:10.270 
what I'm doing is I'm checking to see if
anybody<00:03:08.120> has<00:03:08.360> one<00:03:09.019> death<00:03:09.319> and<00:03:09.650> if<00:03:10.130> they<00:03:10.220> do

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
anybody has one death and if they do

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.490 
anybody has one death and if they do
have<00:03:10.489> one<00:03:10.519> death<00:03:10.940> it<00:03:11.450> will<00:03:11.660> then<00:03:11.840> be<00:03:11.989> set<00:03:12.230> to

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
have one death it will then be set to

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.710 
have one death it will then be set to
zero<00:03:12.769> which<00:03:12.950> will<00:03:13.100> then<00:03:13.250> in<00:03:13.400> effect<00:03:13.579> stop<00:03:14.390> this

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
zero which will then in effect stop this

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.539 
zero which will then in effect stop this
clock<00:03:15.350> so<00:03:15.530> let<00:03:15.650> me<00:03:15.709> just<00:03:15.890> see<00:03:16.010> if<00:03:16.100> I<00:03:16.190> didn't

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:16.549 
clock so let me just see if I didn't

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:18.130 
clock so let me just see if I didn't
actually<00:03:16.670> call<00:03:17.060> this<00:03:17.239> death<00:03:17.510> young<00:03:17.870> death

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
actually call this death young death

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.280 
actually call this death young death
okay<00:03:18.920> so<00:03:19.549> basically<00:03:19.880> if<00:03:20.180> I<00:03:20.329> do<00:03:20.390> this<00:03:20.780> now<00:03:20.989> let

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
okay so basically if I do this now let

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.830 
okay so basically if I do this now let
me<00:03:21.380> just<00:03:21.560> remove<00:03:22.010> that<00:03:22.430> one<00:03:22.760> over<00:03:23.090> there<00:03:23.269> if

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
me just remove that one over there if

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.890 
me just remove that one over there if
when<00:03:24.200> I<00:03:24.230> hit<00:03:24.470> this<00:03:24.680> replace<00:03:25.579> this<00:03:25.900> comparator

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
when I hit this replace this comparator

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.960 
when I hit this replace this comparator
it<00:03:26.959> should<00:03:27.140> reset<00:03:27.410> my<00:03:27.680> deaths<00:03:28.130> to<00:03:28.430> zero<00:03:28.700> which

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
it should reset my deaths to zero which

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.720 
it should reset my deaths to zero which
it<00:03:29.239> has<00:03:29.510> and<00:03:30.110> when<00:03:30.560> I<00:03:30.590> put<00:03:30.799> this<00:03:30.950> comparator<00:03:31.610> in

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
it has and when I put this comparator in

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.490 
it has and when I put this comparator in
here<00:03:32.030> that's<00:03:32.930> it<00:03:33.489> nothing<00:03:34.489> happens<00:03:34.760> and<00:03:35.600> that

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
here that's it nothing happens and that

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.020 
here that's it nothing happens and that
is<00:03:36.650> it<00:03:36.799> that<00:03:36.980> is<00:03:37.070> how<00:03:37.190> quickly<00:03:37.519> and<00:03:37.850> easily

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
is it that is how quickly and easily

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.090 
is it that is how quickly and easily
that<00:03:38.480> is<00:03:38.630> so<00:03:38.959> basically<00:03:39.410> you<00:03:39.560> find<00:03:39.769> out<00:03:39.890> die

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100 
that is so basically you find out die

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.949 
that is so basically you find out die
okay<00:03:40.970> listen<00:03:41.299> to<00:03:41.480> this<00:03:41.510> if<00:03:41.780> I<00:03:41.870> kill<00:03:42.140> myself

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
okay listen to this if I kill myself

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:45.310 
okay listen to this if I kill myself
okay

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:45.320 
okay

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.740 
okay
you'll<00:03:46.100> hear<00:03:46.310> the<00:03:46.430> sound<00:03:46.609> play<00:03:46.880> and<00:03:47.150> then<00:03:47.570> it

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
you'll hear the sound play and then it

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.500 
you'll hear the sound play and then it
sound<00:03:48.260> doesn't<00:03:48.470> play<00:03:48.739> again<00:03:49.040> so<00:03:49.880> let<00:03:50.329> me<00:03:50.390> just

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
sound doesn't play again so let me just

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:52.830 
sound doesn't play again so let me just
do<00:03:50.660> that<00:03:50.750> again<00:03:50.810> it's<00:03:51.170> actually<00:03:51.440> quite<00:03:51.560> fun

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
do that again it's actually quite fun

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.250 
do that again it's actually quite fun
that's<00:03:53.840> it

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
that's it

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.800 
that's it
alright<00:03:54.769> so<00:03:54.950> to<00:03:55.130> find<00:03:55.430> a<00:03:55.609> way<00:03:55.820> this<00:03:56.239> path<00:03:56.510> isn't

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
alright so to find a way this path isn't

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:58.690 
alright so to find a way this path isn't
at<00:03:57.109> the<00:03:57.170> moment<00:03:57.500> it's<00:03:57.590> a<00:03:57.650> bit<00:03:57.769> wishy-washy

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:58.700 
at the moment it's a bit wishy-washy

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.789 
at the moment it's a bit wishy-washy
I've<00:03:59.000> not<00:03:59.209> been<00:03:59.299> able<00:03:59.510> to<00:03:59.600> actually<00:03:59.900> record<00:04:00.470> or

00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:00.799 
I've not been able to actually record or

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:03.699 
I've not been able to actually record or
had<00:04:01.190> time<00:04:01.459> to<00:04:01.640> record<00:04:01.910> a<00:04:02.150> sound<00:04:02.450> but<00:04:03.049> if<00:04:03.440> you<00:04:03.560> go

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:03.709 
had time to record a sound but if you go

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:06.759 
had time to record a sound but if you go
into<00:04:03.920> your<00:04:04.299> minecraft<00:04:05.299> folder<00:04:06.019> you<00:04:06.620> will<00:04:06.739> see

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:06.769 
into your minecraft folder you will see

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:09.009 
into your minecraft folder you will see
this<00:04:07.040> something<00:04:07.340> called<00:04:07.370> assets<00:04:08.000> and<00:04:08.299> under

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:09.019 
this something called assets and under

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:12.340 
this something called assets and under
assets<00:04:09.470> you<00:04:09.650> will<00:04:09.769> now<00:04:09.920> find<00:04:10.190> sound<00:04:11.120> and<00:04:12.079> under

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:12.350 
assets you will now find sound and under

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:14.199 
assets you will now find sound and under
sound<00:04:12.560> you<00:04:12.709> will<00:04:12.829> find<00:04:13.040> mob<00:04:13.310> and<00:04:13.519> then<00:04:13.640> this<00:04:13.820> is

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:14.209 
sound you will find mob and then this is

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:16.630 
sound you will find mob and then this is
where<00:04:14.450> the<00:04:14.720> various<00:04:15.290> sounds<00:04:16.070> will<00:04:16.220> be<00:04:16.250> so<00:04:16.549> you

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:16.640 
where the various sounds will be so you

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.729 
where the various sounds will be so you
can<00:04:16.760> use<00:04:16.970> any<00:04:17.239> any<00:04:17.599> sound<00:04:17.900> so<00:04:18.019> let's<00:04:18.140> say<00:04:18.320> we

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739 
can use any any sound so let's say we

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:20.649
