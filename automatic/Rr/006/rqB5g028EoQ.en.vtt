00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.210
 to choose your oven well, there is 

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:12.950
 today at your disposal 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:14.809
 different modes of operation the 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:16.309
 first natural convection are 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:18.080
 on a pretty simple enough operation 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.090
 pretty basic will be equipped with two 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.730
 resistors a vault resistance a 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.259
 only one resistance is rather limited 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.029
 at the level of the possibilities preparation 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:27.439
 more nor niang always up to 4 or even 5 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:29.150
 for a maximum of one year 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:30.649
 then what is called heat 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.689
 brewed or there in addition to both 

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:34.610
 resistors you baseline 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:35.239
 a turbine a fan who will you 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.730
 to have a better 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:39.260
 temperature distribution so 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.180
 the idea is to have wells are more 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.460
 homogeneous power for example it 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:46.130
 achieve two identical dishes at the same 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.690
 time then you have to your 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:50.060
 provision so-called heat 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:53.150
 pulsed heat chip is always 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:54.530
 resistance duo resistance down the 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:56.000
 fan and then especially a 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.860
 third resistance around this same 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.110
 fan that will allow you to 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.490
 reduce cooking times 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.610
 reach very high temperatures 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:05.720
 between 180 and 200 degrees on average in 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.790
 four to five minutes 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.860
 unlike natural convection 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.909
 where the heat is brewed or where we go 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.909
 reach goals in twelve minutes 

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:16.490
 baking result in an oven are 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.409
 very important but cleaning everything 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.819
 many available 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:21.679
 today different modes of 

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:24.109
 cleaning the first one that will be called the 

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:25.549
 catalysis is an oven that will you 

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:28.100
 to eliminate all 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:29.450
 greece projections projected during a 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.759
 baking 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.320
 the second pyrolysis is the only 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:34.520
 self cleaning mode that will allow 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.259
 to eliminate not only fats 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.719
 but also sugar projections on 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:40.600
 all the walls of the oven or baking 

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:42.530
 it's a specific program 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.530
 usually this kind of times and team 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.689
 and in addition to secure the door of a 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.640
 cold door that's important to the 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:53.420
 know especially when we have children in 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:55.280
 it is important to adapt 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.869
 the volume of the fund the format of the franc 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.649
 compared to the place so dispose 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:00.380
 in your kitchen 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:02.720
 know that there are 45 cm ovens 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.640
 usually the most standard has x 60 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.700
 60 cm but there are also shapes 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:11.180
 Family AQIP 90cm to develop it 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:13.340
 big preparation with regards 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.180
 aesthetics to your provisions three 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.040
 different materials 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.829
 the enamelled company work with 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.540
 different colors of cream white 

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:22.970
 matte stainless steel 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.470
 I have a very contemporary tendency and 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.500
 then the tempered glass that allows to have 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:30.940
 different colors of the matt white 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:33.110
 ice what is called the mirror effect 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.609
 most ovens are equipped 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.079
 Electro control today 

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:37.130
 mechanical devices that will allow you to 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:38.810
 take the hand a wish on the 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.370
 temperatures it's you the chef it's 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.470
 you who will adjust the temperatures 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.329
 and nice cooking time 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.130
 also equipped with recommendations of 

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:47.900
 temperatures that will adapt the 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.090
 temperature compared to the program that 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.780
 you will have preselected or even 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.490
 for once a little more accomplished 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.100
 be equipped with crowd controls 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:57.840
 automatic fully automated 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.770
 will you make sure that 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.770
 to succeed all your preparations
