not<00:02:00.990> as<00:02:01.320> flowy<00:02:01.890> as<00:02:02.159> the<00:02:02.369> garner<00:02:02.790> it's<00:02:03.000> a<00:02:03.119> bit

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
not as flowy as the garner it's a bit

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.749 
not as flowy as the garner it's a bit
thicker<00:02:03.899> but<00:02:04.860> I<00:02:05.130> actually<00:02:05.430> like<00:02:05.969> it<00:02:06.180> that<00:02:06.450> way

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759 
thicker but I actually like it that way

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:11.900 
thicker but I actually like it that way
this<00:02:08.759> is<00:02:08.879> the<00:02:09.000> way<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.270> top<00:02:09.569> opens

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
this is the way the top opens

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.020 
this is the way the top opens
which<00:02:12.060> is<00:02:12.270> okay<00:02:12.450> by<00:02:12.930> me<00:02:12.960> I<00:02:13.530> prefer<00:02:14.070> pumps<00:02:14.730> but

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
which is okay by me I prefer pumps but

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.170 
which is okay by me I prefer pumps but
this<00:02:15.300> is<00:02:15.480> all<00:02:15.630> right<00:02:15.810> too<00:02:16.080> and<00:02:16.550> if<00:02:17.550> you<00:02:17.760> compare

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.590

than any of the other ones that I have
and<00:05:01.229> I<00:05:01.680> really<00:05:02.160> like<00:05:02.370> that<00:05:02.400> it<00:05:02.699> has<00:05:02.729> a<00:05:02.910> pump

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270 
and I really like that it has a pump

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.540 
and I really like that it has a pump
when<00:05:04.020> you<00:05:04.139> pump<00:05:04.350> it<00:05:04.530> out<00:05:04.620> it<00:05:04.860> comes<00:05:05.100> out<00:05:05.280> about

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:05.550 
when you pump it out it comes out about

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:08.210 
when you pump it out it comes out about
a<00:05:05.610> quarter<00:05:06.000> size<00:05:06.240> and<00:05:06.660> it<00:05:07.350> spreads<00:05:07.889> very

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.220 
a quarter size and it spreads very

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:11.240 
a quarter size and it spreads very
easily<00:05:08.580> it's<00:05:09.120> almost<00:05:09.660> like<00:05:09.900> a<00:05:09.930> pure<00:05:10.289> oil<00:05:10.590> like

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.250 
easily it's almost like a pure oil like

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:13.909 
easily it's almost like a pure oil like
nothing<00:05:11.880> else<00:05:12.060> it's<00:05:12.330> not<00:05:12.539> sticky<00:05:13.229> or<00:05:13.260> anything

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:13.919 
nothing else it's not sticky or anything

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:18.409 
nothing else it's not sticky or anything
so<00:05:14.699> it<00:05:15.000> spreads<00:05:15.330> real<00:05:15.900> easily<00:05:16.320> and<00:05:16.949> it<00:05:17.820> was

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:18.419 
so it spreads real easily and it was

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:20.689

smell<00:05:46.020> as<00:05:46.229> well<00:05:46.440> it<00:05:46.680> sticks<00:05:47.159> around<00:05:47.310> for<00:05:47.520> maybe

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:47.760 
smell as well it sticks around for maybe

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.719 
smell as well it sticks around for maybe
an<00:05:47.940> hour<00:05:48.000> no<00:05:48.870> longer<00:05:49.320> and<00:05:49.590> in<00:05:50.070> the<00:05:50.159> smell<00:05:50.400> fades

00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:50.729 
an hour no longer and in the smell fades

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:53.420 
an hour no longer and in the smell fades
you<00:05:51.659> can<00:05:51.840> also<00:05:51.990> use<00:05:52.349> this<00:05:52.500> on<00:05:52.740> dry<00:05:53.010> hair<00:05:53.039> I<00:05:53.280> do

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:53.430 
you can also use this on dry hair I do

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:55.730 
you can also use this on dry hair I do
that<00:05:53.760> as<00:05:53.909> well<00:05:53.940> it's<00:05:54.479> a<00:05:54.780> great<00:05:55.110> phrase<00:05:55.440> killer

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:55.740 
that as well it's a great phrase killer

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:59.089 
that as well it's a great phrase killer
in<00:05:56.099> my<00:05:56.340> opinion<00:05:56.669> and<00:05:57.380> it<00:05:58.380> doesn't<00:05:58.830> take<00:05:58.949> much

00:05:59.089 --> 00:05:59.099 
in my opinion and it doesn't take much

00:05:59.099 --> 00:06:01.399 
in my opinion and it doesn't take much
at<00:05:59.280> all<00:05:59.370> I<00:05:59.430> would<00:05:59.729> say<00:05:59.760> two<00:06:00.599> pumps<00:06:01.020> to<00:06:01.169> spread

00:06:01.399 --> 00:06:01.409 
at all I would say two pumps to spread

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:03.260 
at all I would say two pumps to spread
throughout<00:06:01.650> all<00:06:01.889> of<00:06:01.949> my<00:06:02.370> hair<00:06:02.580> to<00:06:02.699> coat<00:06:02.880> all<00:06:03.090> of

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:03.270 
throughout all of my hair to coat all of

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:06.230 
throughout all of my hair to coat all of
it<00:06:03.419> my<00:06:03.690> hair<00:06:03.900> is<00:06:03.990> pretty<00:06:04.260> thick<00:06:04.650> and<00:06:04.919> long<00:06:05.280> so

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:06.240 
it my hair is pretty thick and long so

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.270 
it my hair is pretty thick and long so
this<00:06:06.840> was<00:06:07.050> about<00:06:07.289> twelve<00:06:07.620> dollars<00:06:07.949> this<00:06:08.130> was

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:08.280 
this was about twelve dollars this was

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:10.159 
this was about twelve dollars this was
probably<00:06:08.520> the<00:06:08.760> most<00:06:08.970> expensive<00:06:09.419> one<00:06:09.840> out<00:06:10.020> of

00:06:10.159 --> 00:06:10.169 
probably the most expensive one out of

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:13.339 
probably the most expensive one out of
them<00:06:10.320> all<00:06:11.030> but<00:06:12.030> I<00:06:12.270> think<00:06:12.510> it<00:06:12.570> was<00:06:12.690> worth<00:06:12.870> it<00:06:13.050> if

00:06:13.339 --> 00:06:13.349 
them all but I think it was worth it if

00:06:13.349 --> 00:06:15.740 
them all but I think it was worth it if
I<00:06:13.620> had<00:06:13.800> to<00:06:13.919> choose<00:06:13.949> one<00:06:14.460> out<00:06:14.789> of<00:06:15.060> all<00:06:15.300> of<00:06:15.360> these

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:15.750 
I had to choose one out of all of these

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:18.560 
I had to choose one out of all of these
I<00:06:16.110> would<00:06:16.919> probably<00:06:17.580> go<00:06:17.789> with<00:06:17.820> this<00:06:18.120> one<00:06:18.180> just

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:18.570 
I would probably go with this one just

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:20.450 
I would probably go with this one just
because<00:06:18.720> it's<00:06:19.080> cheaper<00:06:19.470> but<00:06:20.010> these<00:06:20.220> two

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:20.460 
because it's cheaper but these two

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:22.640 
because it's cheaper but these two
performance<00:06:21.060> wise<00:06:21.349> aside<00:06:22.349> from<00:06:22.470> the<00:06:22.590> fact

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:22.650 
performance wise aside from the fact

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:24.560 
performance wise aside from the fact
that<00:06:22.889> I<00:06:23.010> need<00:06:23.190> a<00:06:23.220> little<00:06:23.490> bit<00:06:23.789> more<00:06:24.030> from<00:06:24.449> this

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:24.570 
that I need a little bit more from this

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:27.320 
that I need a little bit more from this
one<00:06:24.780> than<00:06:25.020> that<00:06:25.430> performance<00:06:26.430> wise<00:06:26.639> in<00:06:27.120> the

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:27.330 
one than that performance wise in the

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:30.920 
one than that performance wise in the
end<00:06:27.510> they<00:06:27.870> are<00:06:28.199> almost<00:06:28.560> at<00:06:28.979> I<00:06:29.280> they<00:06:30.150> really<00:06:30.690> are

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:30.930 
end they are almost at I they really are

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:33.200 
end they are almost at I they really are
so<00:06:31.440> I<00:06:31.470> would<00:06:31.770> have<00:06:31.919> to<00:06:32.070> say<00:06:32.099> this<00:06:32.550> if<00:06:32.789> I<00:06:32.909> wanted

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:33.210 
so I would have to say this if I wanted

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:35.719 
so I would have to say this if I wanted
to<00:06:33.389> be<00:06:33.570> a<00:06:33.810> match<00:06:34.139> EP<00:06:34.469> but<00:06:35.099> if<00:06:35.250> I<00:06:35.340> had<00:06:35.520> a<00:06:35.550> little

00:06:35.719 --> 00:06:35.729 
to be a match EP but if I had a little

00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:37.779 
to be a match EP but if I had a little
extra<00:06:35.849> money<00:06:36.210> I<00:06:36.330> would<00:06:36.659> get<00:06:36.779> the<00:06:36.930> L'Oreal

00:06:37.779 --> 00:06:37.789 
extra money I would get the L'Oreal

00:06:37.789 --> 00:06:41.419 
extra money I would get the L'Oreal
thank<00:06:38.789> you<00:06:38.909> for<00:06:39.090> watching
