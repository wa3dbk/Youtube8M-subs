it's<00:01:07.160> not<00:01:07.340> that<00:01:07.520> hard<00:01:07.670> you<00:01:07.850> just<00:01:07.880> look<00:01:08.210> up<00:01:08.360> and

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
it's not that hard you just look up and

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:09.100 
it's not that hard you just look up and
shoot

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
shoot

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.590 
shoot
well<00:01:09.619> that<00:01:09.830> forces<00:01:10.310> you<00:01:10.460> to<00:01:10.490> use<00:01:10.910> your<00:01:11.090> bionic

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 
arm and creative ways though and it

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.700 
arm and creative ways though and it
wouldn't<00:01:14.090> be<00:01:14.300> the<00:01:14.450> game<00:01:14.630> it<00:01:14.780> is<00:01:14.929> if<00:01:15.170> he<00:01:15.500> could

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
wouldn't be the game it is if he could

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.760 
wouldn't be the game it is if he could
fire<00:01:16.039> upwards<00:01:16.690> so<00:01:17.690> you<00:01:17.780> get<00:01:18.170> a<00:01:18.200> new<00:01:18.350> storyline

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209 
enjoyed this one it's fun and while it

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:27.940 
enjoyed this one it's fun and while it
starts<00:02:26.480> off<00:02:26.660> a<00:02:26.690> bit<00:02:26.930> easy<00:02:27.230> especially<00:02:27.530> if

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
starts off a bit easy especially if

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.590 
starts off a bit easy especially if
you're<00:02:28.130> used<00:02:28.340> to<00:02:28.459> playing<00:02:28.850> Bionic<00:02:29.330> Commando

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
you're used to playing Bionic Commando

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.990 
you're used to playing Bionic Commando
games<00:02:30.170> it<00:02:30.350> does<00:02:30.530> ramp<00:02:30.830> up<00:02:31.040> the<00:02:31.220> challenge<00:02:31.519> and

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
games it does ramp up the challenge and

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.449 
games it does ramp up the challenge and
suddenly<00:02:32.330> become<00:02:32.690> frustrating<00:02:33.380> but<00:02:33.830> never<00:02:34.160> so

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
suddenly become frustrating but never so

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:36.490 
suddenly become frustrating but never so
frustrating<00:02:35.120> that<00:02:35.269> it<00:02:35.390> becomes<00:02:35.989> a<00:02:36.200> chore

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
frustrating that it becomes a chore

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.039 
frustrating that it becomes a chore
Bionic<00:02:37.040> Commando<00:02:37.340> rearmed<00:02:38.120> it<00:02:38.269> to<00:02:38.450> forces<00:02:38.900> you

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:39.049 
Bionic Commando rearmed it to forces you

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:41.259 
Bionic Commando rearmed it to forces you
to<00:02:39.079> think<00:02:39.200> outside<00:02:39.890> of<00:02:39.920> the<00:02:40.220> box<00:02:40.250> at<00:02:40.700> times<00:02:40.970> and

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:41.269 
to think outside of the box at times and

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:43.270 
to think outside of the box at times and
find<00:02:41.989> new<00:02:42.350> ways<00:02:42.500> to<00:02:42.560> work<00:02:42.920> with<00:02:42.950> the

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
find new ways to work with the

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.310 
find new ways to work with the
environment<00:02:43.519> or<00:02:44.000> at<00:02:44.090> least<00:02:44.299> climb<00:02:44.870> around<00:02:45.049> the

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
environment or at least climb around the

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:50.319 
environment or at least climb around the
outside<00:02:45.739> of<00:02:45.769> it<00:02:48.579> the<00:02:49.579> level<00:02:49.940> design<00:02:50.299> is

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:50.329 
outside of it the level design is

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:52.210 
outside of it the level design is
consistent<00:02:51.110> with<00:02:51.260> this<00:02:51.530> series<00:02:51.860> and<00:02:52.040> pretty

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
consistent with this series and pretty

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.100 
consistent with this series and pretty
much<00:02:52.370> what<00:02:52.640> I<00:02:52.670> would<00:02:52.940> expect<00:02:53.060> at<00:02:53.450> least<00:02:53.630> from

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
much what I would expect at least from

00:02:54.110 --> 00:03:00.059 
much what I would expect at least from
Bionic<00:02:54.650> Commando<00:02:54.920> rearm

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:00.069 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:02.220 

it<00:03:00.670> certainly<00:03:01.090> doesn't<00:03:01.359> go<00:03:01.540> to<00:03:01.599> great<00:03:01.840> lengths

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
it certainly doesn't go to great lengths

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.050 
it certainly doesn't go to great lengths
to<00:03:02.530> reinvent<00:03:03.010> itself<00:03:03.370> but<00:03:03.579> the<00:03:03.730> overall

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
to reinvent itself but the overall

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.000 
to reinvent itself but the overall
presentation<00:03:04.689> and<00:03:05.170> production<00:03:05.530> value<00:03:05.859> is

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
presentation and production value is

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.979 
presentation and production value is
excellent<00:03:06.400> the<00:03:07.090> word<00:03:07.299> that<00:03:07.510> I<00:03:07.540> would<00:03:07.780> use<00:03:07.959> to

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989 
excellent the word that I would use to

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:10.500 
excellent the word that I would use to
describe<00:03:08.260> the<00:03:09.189> reason<00:03:09.639> this<00:03:09.819> succeeds<00:03:10.299> is

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
describe the reason this succeeds is

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.699 
describe the reason this succeeds is
consistency<00:03:11.439> I<00:03:12.870> don't<00:03:13.870> want<00:03:14.109> the<00:03:14.290> Bionic

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
consistency I don't want the Bionic

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:16.890 
consistency I don't want the Bionic
Commando<00:03:15.010> to<00:03:15.459> change<00:03:15.760> that<00:03:16.060> much<00:03:16.329> especially

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
Commando to change that much especially

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.589 
Commando to change that much especially
with<00:03:17.469> the<00:03:17.650> 2d<00:03:18.069> games<00:03:18.340> the<00:03:18.670> 3d<00:03:19.030> one<00:03:19.209> was<00:03:19.359> pretty

00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:19.599 
with the 2d games the 3d one was pretty

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:20.039 
with the 2d games the 3d one was pretty
cool

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:20.049 
cool

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:22.170 
cool
but<00:03:20.469> when<00:03:20.620> it<00:03:20.709> comes<00:03:20.889> to<00:03:21.040> 2d<00:03:21.430> Bionic<00:03:21.879> Commando

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
but when it comes to 2d Bionic Commando

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.509 
but when it comes to 2d Bionic Commando
style<00:03:23.079> I'd<00:03:23.319> say<00:03:23.500> they<00:03:23.650> got<00:03:23.829> this<00:03:24.010> one<00:03:24.069> right

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 
style I'd say they got this one right

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:26.459 
style I'd say they got this one right
some<00:03:24.939> of<00:03:24.969> the<00:03:25.239> extra<00:03:25.510> stuff<00:03:25.750> like<00:03:25.959> this<00:03:26.139> feels

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:26.469 
some of the extra stuff like this feels

00:03:26.469 --> 00:03:29.550 
some of the extra stuff like this feels
unnecessary<00:03:27.459> but<00:03:27.730> it<00:03:27.849> hardly<00:03:28.510> detracts<00:03:29.230> or

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
unnecessary but it hardly detracts or

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.619 
unnecessary but it hardly detracts or
ruins<00:03:29.859> the<00:03:30.010> experience<00:03:30.549> because<00:03:30.969> a<00:03:31.180> few

00:03:31.619 --> 00:03:31.629 
ruins the experience because a few

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:33.240 
ruins the experience because a few
seconds<00:03:32.049> after<00:03:32.319> this<00:03:32.439> you'll<00:03:32.650> be<00:03:32.680> swinging

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
seconds after this you'll be swinging

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.390 
seconds after this you'll be swinging
and<00:03:33.489> shooting<00:03:33.879> again<00:03:34.739> they<00:03:35.739> did<00:03:35.950> do<00:03:36.099> away<00:03:36.370> with

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
and shooting again they did do away with

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.939 
and shooting again they did do away with
the<00:03:36.700> 2d<00:03:37.090> top-down<00:03:37.359> levels<00:03:38.169> though<00:03:38.379> but

the 2d top-down levels though but

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:57.370 
the 2d top-down levels though but
there's<00:03:39.129> always<00:03:39.280> work<00:03:39.519> kind<00:03:39.760> of<00:03:39.819> silly
