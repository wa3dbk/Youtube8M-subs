00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:47.170
 It really is indeed very cool. 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.239
 this tablet reminds me very afraid 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:52.450
 10 I had that is samsung galaxy 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:54.880
 I was 7-inch blues. 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:58.299
 first tablet that I bought that 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:01.750
 I did a lot of video come out and 3 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:07.359
 disappear the cool personal mouse you 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:11.220
 stay some time without talking good to see some time 

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:11.220
 without moving it will disappear the mouse 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:20.030
 It takes a while, I do not know if it's 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:21.530
 Because I'm messing with I can not 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:24.199
 keep it steady is that it stirs a little 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:26.240
 cold but it then disappears a mouse 

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:28.550
 there on the screen 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:31.160
 after a very nice time 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:32.389
 Very cool staff. Congratulations. 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.330
 he g 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:37.789
 could have put this technology into 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:40.370
 have more of that feature on the tablet there 

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:41.990
 tablet that I find very cool is very 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:44.000
 boring you do not connect 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.830
 put a thumb drive or put up the 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.660
 mouse is that a lot of people that like 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:50.630
 put keyboard mouse ne 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:55.070
 Look, it just appeared now, the a7 had 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:57.680
 also personal pity or this video that was 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:59.060
 to show if the spd is a goal is 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:01.880
 protect 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:03.800
 we have the car here and show this 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:07.699
 feature is that I think it's very cool 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:09.199
 you can not disconnect the the hurt 

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:13.160
 People are going to have to connect in the morning. 

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:15.590
 the handle pulls and ends up different from the 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:17.180
 pen drive you have to disassemble that 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:19.099
 is an internal memory that can 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:21.770
 transfer to this information and can 

00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:24.409
 problem then the staff then is this 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:29.139
