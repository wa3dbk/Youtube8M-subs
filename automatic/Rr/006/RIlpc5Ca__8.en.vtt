00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:15.500
 create sd card manually 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.790
 First of all you need one 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:30.310
 at least eight gigabytes of large usb 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:34.240
 stick or an equally large sd card 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:36.790
 and of course you need 110 mavericks 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:39.870
 terminal and do me with the following 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:42.239
 command here the invisible files 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.610
 visible 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.640
 Then I finish the final one 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.290
 this will then automatically again 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.460

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:56.100
 description and then I minimize myself 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:01:00.059
 once the terminal 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:02.980
 then I go to my us 10.9 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:06.490
 mavericks file I usually do 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:08.950
 in the program folder, if I find them 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.540
 loaded from the mac app store 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.580
 I have it here for the sake of simplicity 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.159
 once copied to the desk and 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:18.030
 click once with the right mouse button 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:21.840
 on it and say package contents show 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:25.900
 then I go to the folder content 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:29.680
 joke port and finds there the install 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:32.680
 dmg file this i open with one 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:36.460
 double click and you see here already 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:38.920
 a hidden file base systems.de mg 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.660
 if you do not go these bases themes 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.570
 make sure you are at the terminal 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:45.580
 the invisible files show last 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.810
 as we are in the first step 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.900
 have made 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.520
 I copy the base system once 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.280
 I'll do it out now 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:57.160
 simplification on the desk and 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.930
 i meant so ebay system opens that 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.780
 do not go but I click with the 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:03.780
 right mouse button on it say open with 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.280
 and choose the disk utility 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.500
 then I'll click here in the bar of 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.650
 hard disk utility on the base 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.450
 system dmg and I will be in the 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.670
 restore the point 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.370
 since it already has the base system dmg 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.930
 there is only right and proper is at 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:24.280
 Do not be in there they even here 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:27.370
 in and then choose your 8 gb usb 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.579
 stick or bigger us are and pulls 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.230
 this on the target medium 

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:33.400
 then you click 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.340
 restore 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:40.299
 I'm still warned that now the 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.890
 content of a usb-stick with the image 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:43.870
 is therefore overwritten with the base 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.610
 system the g yes I therefore want are 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.610
 Clear 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:50.280
 I have to confirm here with mine 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.689
 username and my password and 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.640
 then my USB stick or 

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:56.530
 deleted a sd card 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.030
 It should be a mistake for you 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.359
 Come on when you recover 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:06.370

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:08.549
 partition on your usb-stick or one 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:11.409

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:15.790
 go to the usb-stick on it 

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:17.230
 partition and here once on the - it 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.269

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.879
 a usb-stick is none 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:24.129

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:26.620

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:36.280
 content of my ticks on this stick 

00:03:34.689 --> 00:03:38.889
