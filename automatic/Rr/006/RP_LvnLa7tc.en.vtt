00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:16.150
 hello everyone how about in this video os 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:19.430
 I'll teach you to do this are these 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:21.680
 little balls of snow that we will have good 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:24.080
 seen a thousand times in stores 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.910
 memories of souvenirs these balls 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.220
 Well, that's like Otomi glitter 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.230
 inside with a doll but they are good 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.119
 a normal thing above all seem to me 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.699
 a very nice activity to do with 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:37.010
 children at home so if you like that 

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:39.949
 You must know it well and you will see that it is very 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:43.250
 We are going to need a little pot 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:45.649
 of good glass is of a very size 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:48.559
 great you serve anyone is worth a 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:50.899
 normal crystal case and current 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:53.450
 these that come for example onions 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:55.160
 or carrot pickles that is usually so 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:57.469
 tiny little glasses of any 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.300
 those dances the more monkeys the little pot 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:01.640
 more redondita is more chic and time is 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.410
 better but we can not manage with 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.420
 anyone can also do it 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.979
 make with a large jar of jam 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.410
 normal and current, but not us 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:12.710
 we were pretty in the pancakes then 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:16.280
 Well, we're going to need water 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:18.049
 we will need purpurin purpurin 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.790
 of the color that you want in the end the one that 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:22.220
 put then is the one that is going to see me 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:24.380
 I have this silver blue I bought them 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.450
 in a shop these couple of 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.100
 the Chinese but we will be able to choose 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.710
 of the color you want if you want 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.330
 look like snow, also white, not like that 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.850
 if you find any that is a little 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.860
 chubby let's go the one you want a 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.149
 little doll whatever I have taken this 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.340
 little doll that found me so 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:42.920
 nice but let any doll 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:47.539
 ok or a miniature house what 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:50.990
 sea and a glue this is loctite super 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:52.460
 glue that is water resistant is worth that 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.380
 it is the fundamental thing that has to be 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.850
 water resistant and this I bought it in 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.700
 leroy merlin good indeed 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.259
 the box is this brings two I do not remember 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.930
 very well when it has cost me like 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.659
 four euros and something something like that both the 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.250
 glitter because nothing a few cents the 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.679
 Tarrito is free and the doll 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.630
 that you have good and then there is someone who 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.940
 Also take a teaspoon of 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.770
 glycerin this is done so that the 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.720
 glitter then fall a little bit more than 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.940
 space but let's go neither is necessary 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.760
 If you want to add glycerin 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.709
 do it already from 10 instead of from 9 the 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.870
 you can buy glycerin in pharmacies 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.980
 ok and with a teaspoon it would be 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.220
 enough 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:34.860
 Well, the first thing we are going to do is 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.560
 take the cover put here a little bit of 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.720
 glue and let's stick the very to 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.269
 doll to the table has to be a 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.040
 resistant glue that is good but 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:46.550
 above all what I say resistant to 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:50.200
 water because if not only to take off 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:50.200
 we take the glue 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:56.500
 and we paste it in the center of the lid 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:59.740
 and now we're just going to leave it 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:02.560
 dry while it dries let's throw in 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:04.420
 the little pot a little glitter for 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.330
 more or less like a teaspoon of coffee 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.850
 I'm going to use silver because 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:12.340
 well I think it's the most Christmas and 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:16.500
 autonomy doll is not very Christmas 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:21.110
 but good for it to be 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.110
 more like snow 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:29.440
 Well, there I have the glitter and 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.440
 now we are going to fill it with water 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:36.920
 we have to fill the jar until 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.900
 up all you can top up 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.760
 because then turn it around if not 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.280
 it will be up is easy it is ugly 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:46.580
 then we fill it up when 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:49.130
 the doll is well stuck we are going to 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:52.370
 glue everything on the edge of the 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:54.080
 lid inside we take on the edge of 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.790
 the lid over here inside and we're going to 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.820
 throw glue so that when closing 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:01.610
 the boat that is already well sealed 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:05.209
 so we take everything around one 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:07.160
 glue row of this so strong and 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:10.370
 now we just have to close the 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:13.489
 jar put a towel because as 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:15.560
 we have filled both so up to the 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:17.419
 close it just overflows a little bit 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:21.100
 then put under a towel let 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:21.100
 there we put the little doll 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:28.509
 and we close 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:32.040
 we close well and we tighten well good not 

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:32.040
 overflowed nothing in this case 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:37.390
 and now we just have to leave it 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.490
 dry so that it ends up staying well 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:43.480
 sealed and tightly closed we only have left 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:46.830
 shake it and we already have our little ball 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.830
 homemade snow 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:54.060
 the truth is that chosen a doll a 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:56.450
 little retaco and almost is not due but good 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:05:00.480
 more or less you can make an idea 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:02.340
 Well, this was the activity that 

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:04.350
 I wanted to teach the craft that I 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:07.110
 It seems pretty fun to do with 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:09.690
 kids like I say you can put 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:11.760
 Glitter then white if you prefer to 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:13.950
 it looks more like snow and another 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:15.600
 doll a little when a month and say 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:17.880
 more nice that I forget sympathetic 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:19.440
 so it's a little kim rat that's 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:21.690
 add a little bit you can not also 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:23.460
 add other things as I know that 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:25.440
 sometimes in stores these same 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:27.780
 of the Chinese sell little stars 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.430
 colors or colored balls you can 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:31.800
 put other things to give it a little 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:33.690
 more than grace is worth that simply the 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.580
 glitter but well well everything is a 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:37.890
 pretty adornment especially for the kids 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:40.230
 so that the oil may seem good to me 

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:42.780
 nice and I think good because this is 

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:44.820
 I just hope you liked this one 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:46.770
 craft and see you in the next 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:48.950
 video a little kiss 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:48.950
