00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
hand and just the thin with thinness of

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.400 
hand and just the thin with thinness of
this<00:00:37.250> anyway<00:00:38.250> umm<00:00:38.520> what<00:00:39.120> I<00:00:39.149> find<00:00:39.600> is<00:00:40.050> that<00:00:40.079> this

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
this anyway umm what I find is that this

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.470 
this anyway umm what I find is that this
is<00:00:40.559> a<00:00:40.590> little<00:00:40.980> bit<00:00:41.100> too<00:00:41.219> orange<00:00:41.430> for<00:00:41.730> me<00:00:41.850> now

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
is a little bit too orange for me now

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.299 
is a little bit too orange for me now
when<00:00:42.629> I<00:00:42.660> first<00:00:42.989> started<00:00:43.350> using<00:00:43.620> it<00:00:43.829> I<00:00:43.890> think<00:00:44.219> I

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
when I first started using it I think I

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.130 
when I first started using it I think I
was<00:00:44.460> using<00:00:44.640> it<00:00:44.850> incorrectly<00:00:45.030> I<00:00:45.510> used<00:00:45.840> it<00:00:46.020> like

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
was using it incorrectly I used it like

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.869 
was using it incorrectly I used it like
I<00:00:46.289> do<00:00:46.350> all<00:00:46.649> my<00:00:46.770> other<00:00:46.920> correctors<00:00:47.370> I<00:00:47.460> put<00:00:47.670> on<00:00:47.760> my

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
I do all my other correctors I put on my

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.819 
I do all my other correctors I put on my
foundation<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:48.510> I<00:00:48.570> put<00:00:48.750> on<00:00:48.840> my<00:00:48.960> corrector<00:00:49.440> if

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
foundation and I put on my corrector if

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.060 
foundation and I put on my corrector if
your<00:00:50.550> fair<00:00:50.789> skin<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.180> you<00:00:51.420> have<00:00:51.570> dark<00:00:52.559> circles

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
your fair skin and you have dark circles

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.160 
your fair skin and you have dark circles
like<00:00:53.460> I<00:00:53.640> do<00:00:53.699> it's<00:00:54.000> actually<00:00:54.149> best<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:54.899> apply

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
like I do it's actually best to apply

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.590 
like I do it's actually best to apply
this<00:00:55.370> underneath<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.699> foundation<00:00:56.850> after

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
this underneath the foundation after

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.119 
this underneath the foundation after
your<00:00:58.020> primer<00:00:58.260> but<00:00:58.530> underneath<00:00:58.890> the

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
your primer but underneath the

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.420 
your primer but underneath the
foundation<00:00:59.780> so<00:01:00.780> what<00:01:00.989> I<00:01:01.020> you<00:01:01.320> know<00:01:01.350> it's<00:01:02.160> just

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
foundation so what I you know it's just

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.210 
foundation so what I you know it's just
a<00:01:02.670> very<00:01:03.149> orange<00:01:03.690> kind<00:01:03.989> of<00:01:04.199> colored<00:01:04.589> corrector

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
a very orange kind of colored corrector

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.550 
a very orange kind of colored corrector
it<00:01:05.339> looks<00:01:05.519> more<00:01:05.670> peach<00:01:06.060> in<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:07.080> bottle<00:01:07.409> but

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
it looks more peach in the bottle but

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.770 
it looks more peach in the bottle but
translate<00:01:08.250> is<00:01:08.369> very<00:01:08.580> orange<00:01:09.090> on<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.330> screen

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
translate is very orange on the screen

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.640 
translate is very orange on the screen
it's<00:01:10.290> kind<00:01:10.530> of<00:01:10.619> a<00:01:10.770> thin<00:01:11.189> consistency<00:01:12.530> and<00:01:13.530> as

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
it's kind of a thin consistency and as

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.230 
it's kind of a thin consistency and as
far<00:01:13.799> as<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.070> stay<00:01:14.280> in<00:01:14.340> power<00:01:14.610> it's<00:01:14.909> hard<00:01:15.119> to

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
far as the stay in power it's hard to

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.149 
far as the stay in power it's hard to
say<00:01:15.450> because<00:01:16.020> I<00:01:16.049> don't<00:01:16.170> really<00:01:16.530> wear<00:01:16.770> this<00:01:16.950> on

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
say because I don't really wear this on

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.440 
say because I don't really wear this on
its<00:01:17.310> own<00:01:17.430> when<00:01:17.580> I<00:01:17.610> put<00:01:17.909> so<00:01:18.119> many<00:01:18.240> other

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
its own when I put so many other

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.700 
its own when I put so many other
products<00:01:18.990> over<00:01:19.350> it

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
products over it

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.940 
products over it
but<00:01:20.250> I<00:01:20.280> find<00:01:20.790> that<00:01:21.140> it<00:01:22.140> really<00:01:22.200> depends<00:01:22.890> on

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
but I find that it really depends on

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.140 
but I find that it really depends on
whether<00:01:23.130> or<00:01:23.310> not<00:01:23.369> I'm<00:01:23.580> wearing<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:23.939> long

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
whether or not I'm wearing a long

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.660 
whether or not I'm wearing a long
wearing<00:01:24.509> foundation<00:01:25.200> or<00:01:25.799> not<00:01:26.100> with<00:01:26.340> how<00:01:26.490> long

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
wearing foundation or not with how long

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.670 
wearing foundation or not with how long
this<00:01:27.060> stays<00:01:27.330> since<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.869> foundation<00:01:28.200> is<00:01:28.530> going

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
this stays since the foundation is going

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.670 
this stays since the foundation is going
over<00:01:29.189> it<00:01:29.369> I<00:01:30.360> will<00:01:30.780> not<00:01:30.930> repurchase<00:01:31.500> this

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
over it I will not repurchase this

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.380 
over it I will not repurchase this
because<00:01:32.100> I<00:01:32.130> have<00:01:32.340> other<00:01:32.520> correctors<00:01:33.090> I<00:01:33.210> like

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
because I have other correctors I like

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.960 
because I have other correctors I like
so<00:01:33.689> much<00:01:33.900> better<00:01:34.110> than<00:01:34.439> this<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:35.369> pixie<00:01:35.790> one

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.510 
so much better than this the pixie one
the<00:01:36.119> eve<00:01:36.270> pearl<00:01:36.600> one<00:01:36.900> I<00:01:37.140> don't<00:01:37.560> think<00:01:37.979> this<00:01:38.250> one

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
the eve pearl one I don't think this one

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.240

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
one better than the Armani one but with

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.310 
one better than the Armani one but with
this<00:01:44.729> one<00:01:44.909> you<00:01:45.030> don't<00:01:45.060> use<00:01:45.450> a<00:01:45.479> lot<00:01:45.659> of<00:01:45.810> product

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
this one you don't use a lot of product

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.440 
this one you don't use a lot of product
and<00:01:46.500> it's<00:01:46.619> got<00:01:46.799> that<00:01:46.950> nice<00:01:47.189> brush<00:01:47.700> so<00:01:48.149> you<00:01:48.180> can

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
and it's got that nice brush so you can

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.620 
and it's got that nice brush so you can
really<00:01:48.810> get<00:01:49.020> into<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.530> areas<00:01:49.950> of<00:01:50.189> deepest

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
really get into the areas of deepest

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.210 
really get into the areas of deepest
discoloration<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:52.049> at<00:01:52.409> that<00:01:52.560> point<00:01:52.770> I<00:01:52.920> let<00:01:53.100> it

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
discoloration and at that point I let it

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.100 
discoloration and at that point I let it
sit<00:01:53.490> for<00:01:53.520> a<00:01:53.759> minute<00:01:54.000> to<00:01:54.119> kind<00:01:54.270> of<00:01:54.390> thicken<00:01:54.720> and

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
sit for a minute to kind of thicken and

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.469 
sit for a minute to kind of thicken and
then<00:01:55.229> I<00:01:55.259> Pat<00:01:55.530> it<00:01:55.680> out<00:01:55.799> with<00:01:55.979> my<00:01:56.130> ring<00:01:56.340> finger

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
then I Pat it out with my ring finger

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:59.270 
then I Pat it out with my ring finger
now<00:01:57.479> when<00:01:57.689> I<00:01:57.719> apply<00:01:57.810> my<00:01:58.320> foundation<00:01:58.469> I've<00:01:59.070> been

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
now when I apply my foundation I've been

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.789 
now when I apply my foundation I've been
really<00:01:59.759> loving<00:02:00.329> this<00:02:00.719> brush<00:02:01.049> lately<00:02:01.500> it's<00:02:01.649> my

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
really loving this brush lately it's my

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.999 
really loving this brush lately it's my
Sephora<00:02:02.240> number<00:02:03.240> 56<00:02:03.899> airbrush<00:02:04.439> it's<00:02:04.710> a<00:02:04.829> lot

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
Sephora number 56 airbrush it's a lot

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.300 
Sephora number 56 airbrush it's a lot
smaller<00:02:05.520> than<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:05.969> number<00:02:06.360> 55<00:02:06.990> but<00:02:07.950> it's<00:02:08.099> more

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
smaller than the number 55 but it's more

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.240 
smaller than the number 55 but it's more
dense<00:02:08.789> than<00:02:09.599> the<00:02:09.660> 55<00:02:10.289> and<00:02:10.679> I<00:02:10.800> find<00:02:11.069> it<00:02:11.220> really

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
dense than the 55 and I find it really

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.710 
dense than the 55 and I find it really
kind<00:02:11.700> of<00:02:11.790> gives<00:02:12.030> me<00:02:12.270> more<00:02:12.420> control<00:02:12.599> now

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
kind of gives me more control now

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.570 
kind of gives me more control now
when<00:02:13.960> I<00:02:13.990> apply<00:02:14.380> the<00:02:14.410> foundation<00:02:15.070> over<00:02:15.220> the

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
when I apply the foundation over the

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.000 
when I apply the foundation over the
corrector<00:02:16.000> I<00:02:16.180> don't<00:02:16.480> I<00:02:16.780> like<00:02:17.290> to<00:02:17.470> buff<00:02:17.650> in<00:02:17.830> my

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
corrector I don't I like to buff in my

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.740 
corrector I don't I like to buff in my
foundation<00:02:18.190> I<00:02:18.670> find<00:02:18.880> that<00:02:19.030> gives<00:02:19.270> me<00:02:19.450> the<00:02:19.540> most

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
foundation I find that gives me the most

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.630 
foundation I find that gives me the most
natural<00:02:20.140> look<00:02:20.290> but<00:02:20.500> I<00:02:20.530> don't<00:02:20.800> do<00:02:21.130> that<00:02:21.340> under

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
natural look but I don't do that under

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.520 
natural look but I don't do that under
my<00:02:21.790> eyes<00:02:21.820> because<00:02:22.270> that<00:02:22.990> would<00:02:23.140> buff<00:02:23.350> away

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
my eyes because that would buff away

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.800 
my eyes because that would buff away
this<00:02:23.890> corrector<00:02:24.400> so<00:02:24.850> I<00:02:24.880> just<00:02:25.150> kind<00:02:25.420> of<00:02:25.510> dot

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
this corrector so I just kind of dot

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.960 
this corrector so I just kind of dot
like<00:02:26.350> stipple<00:02:26.830> motions<00:02:27.250> underneath<00:02:27.730> my<00:02:27.940> eye

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
like stipple motions underneath my eye

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.150 
like stipple motions underneath my eye

and brightening that under-eye area than
this<00:03:00.180> I'll<00:03:01.180> use<00:03:01.240> this<00:03:01.780> um<00:03:02.170> it's<00:03:03.100> not<00:03:03.250> like<00:03:03.310> I

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550 
this I'll use this um it's not like I

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.430 
this I'll use this um it's not like I
want<00:03:03.730> to<00:03:03.790> throw<00:03:03.970> it<00:03:04.060> away<00:03:04.120> it's<00:03:04.540> that<00:03:04.750> bad<00:03:04.990> but

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
want to throw it away it's that bad but

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.330 
want to throw it away it's that bad but
it's<00:03:05.830> not<00:03:06.100> really<00:03:06.970> for<00:03:07.000> me<00:03:07.830> this<00:03:08.830> might<00:03:09.070> work

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
it's not really for me this might work

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.690 
it's not really for me this might work
better<00:03:09.640> for<00:03:09.910> somebody<00:03:10.270> who<00:03:10.420> has<00:03:10.660> extreme

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
better for somebody who has extreme

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.620 
better for somebody who has extreme
discoloration<00:03:12.700> under<00:03:12.970> their<00:03:13.090> eye<00:03:13.120> and<00:03:13.510> is<00:03:13.600> a

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
discoloration under their eye and is a

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.320 
discoloration under their eye and is a
little<00:03:14.080> bit<00:03:14.200> darker<00:03:14.709> skin<00:03:14.950> tone<00:03:15.190> than<00:03:16.000> me

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 
little bit darker skin tone than me

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.620 
little bit darker skin tone than me
maybe<00:03:17.050> somebody<00:03:17.650> of<00:03:17.890> indian<00:03:18.790> complexion<00:03:19.450> I

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
maybe somebody of indian complexion I

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.080 
maybe somebody of indian complexion I
find<00:03:19.870> that<00:03:20.050> orange<00:03:20.530> correctors<00:03:21.370> work<00:03:21.580> best<00:03:21.850> on

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
find that orange correctors work best on

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.300 
find that orange correctors work best on
those<00:03:22.300> complexions<00:03:23.019> and<00:03:23.230> that<00:03:23.440> this<00:03:24.130> would

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
those complexions and that this would

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:24.840 
those complexions and that this would
work<00:03:24.459> great

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:24.850 
work great

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:26.699 
work great
probably<00:03:25.660> for<00:03:25.870> those<00:03:25.989> I'm<00:03:26.140> not<00:03:26.290> going<00:03:26.440> to<00:03:26.530> say

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
probably for those I'm not going to say

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:28.380 
probably for those I'm not going to say
yes<00:03:26.920> or<00:03:27.070> no<00:03:27.190> because<00:03:27.340> I<00:03:27.489> haven't<00:03:28.000> used<00:03:28.180> it<00:03:28.360> in

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
yes or no because I haven't used it in

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:30.990 
yes or no because I haven't used it in
that<00:03:28.480> situation<00:03:29.200> but<00:03:29.950> I<00:03:30.160> imagine<00:03:30.700> that's<00:03:30.850> what

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
that situation but I imagine that's what

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.360 
that situation but I imagine that's what
it<00:03:31.090> would<00:03:31.180> work<00:03:31.390> good<00:03:31.690> for<00:03:32.010> so<00:03:33.010> if<00:03:33.100> you<00:03:33.130> want<00:03:33.340> to

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
it would work good for so if you want to

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:34.800 
it would work good for so if you want to
see<00:03:33.519> how<00:03:33.640> this<00:03:33.760> applies<00:03:34.090> then<00:03:34.480> just<00:03:34.660> keep

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
in that area too but as you can see I

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.499 
in that area too but as you can see I
mean<00:04:30.570> it<00:04:30.720> does<00:04:31.699> cancel<00:04:32.699> out<00:04:32.820> those<00:04:33.090> blues

00:04:33.499 --> 00:04:33.509
