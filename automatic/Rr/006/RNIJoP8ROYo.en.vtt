dirty<00:04:00.959> player<00:04:01.230> lodge<00:04:01.650> but<00:04:04.550> this<00:04:05.550> bit<00:04:05.820> he<00:04:06.660> can't

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
dirty player lodge but this bit he can't

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:10.430

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
be stressed yell at you but you can't

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.000
