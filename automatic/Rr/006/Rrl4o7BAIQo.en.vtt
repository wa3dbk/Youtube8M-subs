00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:05.580
 Super the Dexton before exercise of this kind 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.159
 November again the rhythmic 

00:00:08.159 --> 00:00:12.389
 that there is a man on the 1 then the 2 and then the 3 then 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.389
 on the 4 and this time the emphasis is given 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.230
 These 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:54.860
 her search for the Bieler 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.160
 Now that we have mastered this step, we can take the next step 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.110
 and we will complete it now 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.350
 Pillion or Beijing has to play on it to change Bas base 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.810
 Stohler is that he is also completely free and creativity again 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.710
 can use creatively 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.340
 then for Olic accompaniment so he already plays by Schrammel 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.080
 Accompaniment or so you have stop 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.740
 in the future now wonderful percent use as a test field in the Vikings are 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.040
 By default, percent introduces you to several 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.380
 the easy to use and Filip accompaniment also apply 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.630
 principle was now the Bernese 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:38.790
 so different are still struck me as before am still one today 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.790
 should and that changes now 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.760
 Pattern 1 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.730
 but that is slowly the hint again later 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:06.710
 I look around one the emphasis often sitting as currently 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.580
 solid as you did before, you should eat there and now 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.260
 also make mistakes that you just make clear before that the emphasis with 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.289
 the bass or between what 

00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:19.289
 Let me play the example again slowly 

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:58.269
 the 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:00.209
 Dr 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.209
 Dr 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:07.489
 "That will be slow again 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:17.229
 a 

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:20.439
 percent 

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:23.439
 these 

00:03:27.649 --> 00:03:30.549
 the markets are still running out to the point that they really are the ones 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:31.479
 become 

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:32.609
 therein 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:36.149
 Perfect individual vary the sides and the water 

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:39.989
 and that's why Metz had to do a few more with Beijing
