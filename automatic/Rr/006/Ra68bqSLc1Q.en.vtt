00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:32.090
 good idea of vidarte block to do this 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.350
 off special series this special issue on 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.190

 syrte brush 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:42.230
 a guitar and the backstage like 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:43.250
 italy view unit of 8 hours 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.960
 it's with plants for a lot 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.010
 too many psycho strings of the Trojan has 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.329
 found that too much I can follow 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.350
 there are six strings on a guitar killings 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:49.609
 the bass by raising the basques of 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.050
 anyway nobody uses them 

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:52.370
 basins serves for nothing the contrabasses 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.140
 for that there are bassists like that 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.489
 had already fought paulus not the 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.230

 in this case it is here horn the 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.460
 guitar that does it reduces it reduces the 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:02.870
 tuning fork the tuning fork and completely 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.540
 understood it's completely understood but 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.100
 there and at that moment the total trick the 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.450
 serious rope we transform it again 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.220
 super illu ie we pass it to 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.960
 the octave listens well that's what we 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.220
 call the incoming chore ie 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.229
 they listen to these two décor body 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:18.530
 the core 2 extreme this one is that one 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:20.329
 dumas that one duo is this one from the bottom to 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.900
 they are very very acute and the one at 

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:26.230
 middle of the bass sounds 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.910

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:30.460

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.440
 more and more and more understand 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.710
 things like things for example 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.580

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.900
 things with the right hand in a 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.220
 very important place in the ukulele 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.900
 go with bloodthirsty bertrand for the 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.610
 discover that you do not ask 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.500
 pass a stage to strata a stratum 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.880
 had to galas janiak to address 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.350

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.420
 pieces of bits of pieces 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.500
 known that you have you sees you 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.160
 train to do so 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.500
 instrumental 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.610
 there you will progress then 173 sanaa 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.750
 only one way but why I 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.640
 would not do the French song as 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:13.060
 certain French song format at his 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.260
 campaign for example with agreements 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.120
 five years 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.620

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.320
 plus he'll do some little notes 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.760
 in addition that just an hour and a half 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.780
 so to be able to understand how 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.950
 Is that how is what is his 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.330
 companion with a pretty little voice 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.530
 like mine that is well stamped if 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.120
 at there on the camera can make a 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.070
 closeup like that and we'll finish with 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.040
 a white card carte blanche 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:34.420

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.300
 the ocean has seen you go through 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.560
 cross the lot is the ocean 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.209

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.910
 special off-set or sink them 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.959
 given carte blanche to say that it's up to 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.850
 to say that these divas do something 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:50.050

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.580

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.840
 August he does things with the then there 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.769

 small tuning fork measuring 3 cm and a half 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.550
 there are only four bodies and I like 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:02.380
 that's because because these are these 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.850
 restrictions the the restrictions that 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.050

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.450
