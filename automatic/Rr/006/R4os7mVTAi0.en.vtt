00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:14.700
 Hello Cuba is now today Xtreme 4l test server ct 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:17.849
 This is the second time to check out the main update history of 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:21.540
 The last video was three months ago . 

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:26.369
 I'm going to let you know that the content you're testing on gt is interesting. 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:30.090
 This is actually just testing the unknown would turn to bat the field artillery LCD 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.810
 It was possible to delete it, but it would be fine to watch it 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.769
 Like 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:37.320
 And I 'm curious about your opinion. 

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:41.970
 Attacking improves mobility. 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.170
 After the battlefield, I was in charge of the i-mate attack and talked about the breakthrough mobility improvement. 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.290
 It was done. 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:50.220
 There was an angular offer from the General Battlefield Upper Offensive. 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:51.720
 If biased in either direction takes a limit to the angle rapidly and the lower altitude 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:56.100
 We'll crash. 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:57.960
 But in this city ​​update, the angle gauge has disappeared. 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.229
 It means you can leave it at will. 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:04.559
 Thus, the columns that were impossible were made possible. 

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:08.750
 If so I hope to have this thing called - was wide patch 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.750
 I really like this patch now. 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:54.280
 The second is the road to the problem of head glitch . 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:56.290
 I have a problem with this since I started using battlefield. 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.800
 I have a gun behind cover. 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:03.040
 When you shoot a gun, you get damage. But from the enemy's point of view, 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:06.700
 I have my head now, and I can see that it's getting damaged. 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:08.200
 These people really thought that it was hard to match the enemy , 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:13.690
 Do not get damaged 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:14.830
 So if you look at my position, shoot that gun from that face. 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.010
 I wrote a lot. 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:22.239
 In the city, I had this problem for a few guns. 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:26.170
 As the position of the bullet is lowered and the bullet is shot behind the cover, 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:27.100
 It's clogged with cover. Of course not a perfect solution. 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.850
 I made it. 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.959
 Well, I'm not sure about this patch. It's a really annoying problem. 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:36.280
 I tried one 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:39.160
 It's more than just the position of the bullet , 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:43.090
 I think it's better to make it look. 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:47.200
 When I lower the position of the bullet 284 , 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:51.340
 But the bullet is stuck on doejyo looking to cover water, as well as doing good to heaven 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:55.750
 If you do not change the cover does not change properly to me, 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:59.620
 Meadow under strange circumstances I do not see the damage the idea of doing one another doejyo 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:01.560
 Them about that and make sure the one that currently this issue 2 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.830
 I will. 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:09.270
 Third is squadron sponge system competition. 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:11.760
 Now , when you see this video, 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:16.530
 You can see this spawn and die. 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:17.550
 If two people suddenly spawned three people to pretend minutes crews adverse Me 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:21.780
 It was a situation. 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:25.890
 Such a merchant can make a difference. 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:27.060
 In some cases, the city was killed immediately. 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.959
 I want to solve it. 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:35.069
 Basically, when a squad member is in danger, they do not spawn to a squad member 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:38.880
 Geotinde will not spawn when taken in Bucheon squad member now in front 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:40.230
 This is not the arrangement comes into changhae the left you can see the bottom of the income base 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:44.100
 I can see the girl. 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:47.090
 Medal of Honor Warfighter even so there was a similar feature Bat In Filippo 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:50.930
 I look forward to seeing it. 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:52.879
 The fourth is already aboard when the badge is a light comedy or a nuclear tank 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:56.840
 You will see the rider's rank 

00:03:52.879 --> 00:04:00.830
 In fact, one class is driving a low Player of helicopter or anything else other equipment 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:04.790
 It is true that if you are on board you will be off the bat, 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:08.150
 It's hard to see who's far before you board 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:09.769
 Considering these points to see the ranks of the player beforehand before switching tack 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:13.130
 Features added 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:16.519
 If you do a little design, you have some useful features. And in small batches 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:20.930
 Scientific her b Cobra was a little bigger changes 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:22.400
 Here are the major updates we've city you have this patch details 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.790

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:43.250
