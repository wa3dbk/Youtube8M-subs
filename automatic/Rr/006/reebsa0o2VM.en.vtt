00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 In this video I want to show you 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.759
 here the language under windows 7 and 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.170
 Windows Vista others can do that 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.189
 Actually only the use of the ultimate 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.630
 edition reserved 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.019
 but I'll show you how you do too 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:15.299
 under windows professional willis of 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.270
 You could do with bremen 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.980
 the little tool vista page of chloe 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.720
 point k 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.770
 that you do not grab the 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.770
 left the video description 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:34.300
 then if you did that, you can 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:35.230
 start the program and then you see 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.300
 which language on your system 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.770
 are pre-installed 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.060
 Germany is one such system 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.420
 but I would also like to 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:47.359
 change english 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.359
 you can click on and languages 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.570
 and then 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.360
 you have a so-called language packages 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:55.760
 existent language pack context but has 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:58.640
 one has a pretty long name 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:02.300
 numbers and letters you have to 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:04.970
 Open and then you takes a 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.770
 new theme and the language package point 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.409
 exe gets well from before there is no 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.390
 page and then you have to just the 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:14.270
 raussuchen version of the windows system 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.530
 For me that would be windows 7 64 bit 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.840
 and service pack 1 speak 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.220
 professional professional 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.170
 and there I have the English 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.650
 sport offer as you can see here 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.860
 a pretty cryptic name and if 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.630
 you have killed then you can 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.729
 languages ​​and then click on the 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:38.670
 language package the change 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:38.670
 and then converted by the file 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.030
 then checked 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:49.399
 file integrity and then I asked if 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.720
 I really install the language 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:55.560
 want 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:57.600
 I'll do it now and then there 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.000
 is a message from the make up to 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.189
 friend minis world so that can be up to 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.149
 Take 20 minutes 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:04.310
 and that's really why 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.270
 I will take the shot here 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.470
 interrupt and I will contact you 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.489
 again applies that has been installed 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.870
 Immediately and there I am again if you 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:14.640
 finished with you can install 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.340
 just change the language here 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.380
 by clicking on change language then beats 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.610
 tell yourself that the program turns when 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:24.750
 your program concludes that 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:27.150
 computer started and you can 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:30.600
 but I'll show you before 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:33.390
 nor how you get your time of day surrounded the 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:36.269

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.849
