00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:41.420 
you surprisingly you can tell if there's
a<00:03:39.419> difference<00:03:39.720> between<00:03:39.840> the<00:03:40.169> dash<00:03:40.349> 8<00:03:40.650> and<00:03:40.859> then

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
a difference between the dash 8 and then

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.390 
a difference between the dash 8 and then
the<00:03:41.579> Saab<00:03:41.819> 340<00:03:43.010> so<00:03:44.010> I'm<00:03:44.099> actually<00:03:44.220> thinking

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
the Saab 340 so I'm actually thinking

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.289 
the Saab 340 so I'm actually thinking
about<00:03:44.669> getting<00:03:44.940> another<00:03:45.299> US<00:03:46.169> Airways<00:03:46.470> dash<00:03:46.769> 8

00:03:47.289 --> 00:03:47.299 
about getting another US Airways dash 8

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:51.710 
about getting another US Airways dash 8
because<00:03:48.299> I<00:03:48.329> do<00:03:48.449> like<00:03:48.750> the<00:03:48.900> -<00:03:49.049> aids<00:03:49.319> so<00:03:50.720> that's

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
because I do like the - aids so that's

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.270 
because I do like the - aids so that's
just<00:03:51.959> a<00:03:52.079> little<00:03:52.230> comparison<00:03:52.530> I'll<00:03:52.949> bring<00:03:53.129> over

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
just a little comparison I'll bring over

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.479 
just a little comparison I'll bring over
a<00:03:53.459> a<00:03:53.549> crj200<00:03:54.620> which<00:03:55.620> is<00:03:55.739> the<00:03:55.889> aircraft<00:03:56.010> likely

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
a a crj200 which is the aircraft likely

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:59.629 
a a crj200 which is the aircraft likely
today<00:03:57.410> you<00:03:58.410> know<00:03:58.530> obviously<00:03:59.069> the<00:03:59.250> CRJ<00:03:59.579> is

00:03:59.629 --> 00:03:59.639 
today you know obviously the CRJ is

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:00.979 
today you know obviously the CRJ is
going<00:03:59.760> to<00:03:59.819> be<00:03:59.879> bigger<00:04:00.090> but<00:04:00.299> just<00:04:00.810> want<00:04:00.959> to

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
going to be bigger but just want to

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:03.319 
going to be bigger but just want to
compare<00:04:01.260> to<00:04:01.379> everyone<00:04:01.590> to<00:04:01.709> see<00:04:01.889> and<00:04:02.099> I<00:04:02.639> believe

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:03.329 
compare to everyone to see and I believe

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:04.670 
compare to everyone to see and I believe
this<00:04:03.419> is<00:04:03.480> the<00:04:03.629> smallest<00:04:03.959> remark<00:04:04.319> that<00:04:04.440> has<00:04:04.560> to

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
this is the smallest remark that has to

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.530 
this is the smallest remark that has to
be<00:04:04.769> the<00:04:04.859> smallest<00:04:04.949> Jim<00:04:05.340> my<00:04:05.430> jet<00:04:05.669> it's<00:04:05.970> smaller

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
be the smallest Jim my jet it's smaller

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:07.670 
be the smallest Jim my jet it's smaller
than<00:04:06.690> the<00:04:06.780> dash<00:04:06.930> 8<00:04:07.169> so<00:04:07.349> I<00:04:07.410> don't<00:04:07.560> think

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
than the dash 8 so I don't think

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.069 
than the dash 8 so I don't think
anything<00:04:08.010> you<00:04:08.040> get<00:04:08.160> smaller<00:04:08.400> than<00:04:08.579> that

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:09.079 
anything you get smaller than that

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:14.300 
anything you get smaller than that
almost<00:04:10.079> maybe<00:04:10.709> I<00:04:10.980> don't<00:04:11.250> know<00:04:11.340> but<00:04:11.849> yeah<00:04:13.310> like

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
almost maybe I don't know but yeah like

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.270
