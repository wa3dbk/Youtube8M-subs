00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.510
 I am planning today 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:08.510
 I think that I want to do the video camera one after the last time 

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:20.570
 Previously purchased here Sony also of hdr cx 420 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:24.170
 And each test and back sounding and 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:30.610
 It is the one of after color taste 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:30.610
 I think that I want to do that and that and this one 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:38.780
 What say showdown video camera Do Well Well 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:45.860
 As a video camera to compare 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:48.649
 This maker is different, but also Canon's ibis hf r 42 here 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:55.370
 I would like to try it 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:56.210
 It is not easy to understand the difference between the manufacturers of Canon and Sony 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.130
 Is not it 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:02.120
 It try popular 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:09.420
 The setting for wintering members is like this 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:13.600
 Since then I tried to keep the same height for almost the same shooting distance 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:16.580
 So I think you want to do first 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:20.590
 By the way, I also shoot the light 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:22.840
 It will be taken in full auto mode 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:29.920
 Yes we will start soon 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:34.050
 Kamen is we are trying to avoid in the ivis hf r 42 of Canon're shooting now 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:42.080
 Hey I mean that 32.5 mm to write a 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:42.080
 There may be a narrow range, so it's not a speed camera that I can remember so much 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:49.970
 And how about the voice sound bird how is it contained firmly 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:57.970
 Yes 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:02:01.060
 t shoot with Sony hdr cx 420 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:05.120
 It is 8 here 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:12.020
 It demoted It is a wide-angle 26.8mm 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:13.950
 This 26.8mm which I shoot is 26.8 sentences in the state of image stabilization off 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:17.210
 You can 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:22.970
 What if Bette shake would Kikashi the path and 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:25.390
 Because it will be about 30 mm mountain demotion, it is a little more than this 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:32.810
 I waited 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:38.209
 I think it will be shooting and what about the transition of sewing after entering 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:45.860
 And the color of the two Canons and Sony is different ? 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:47.819
 I'm a color day, but it's a bit easier to understand if I've taken it outdoors, so I'll copy it outside 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:53.749
 Came 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:53.749

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:57.990
 Did you understand the difference between Sony and Canon 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:04:02.030

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:02.030
