they<00:00:48.510> put<00:00:48.780> down<00:00:48.930> like<00:00:49.170> a<00:00:49.200> pylon<00:00:49.530> right<00:00:49.829> here

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
they put down like a pylon right here

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.290 
they put down like a pylon right here

then they try and put some cannons

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.360 
then they try and put some cannons
behind<00:00:51.629> it<00:00:51.840> and<00:00:52.350> they<00:00:52.680> nuke<00:00:52.949> down<00:00:53.160> your

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
behind it and they nuke down your

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.430 
behind it and they nuke down your
natural<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.120> all<00:00:54.480> of<00:00:54.600> a<00:00:54.690> sudden<00:00:54.930> you<00:00:55.050> are<00:00:55.079> very

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
natural and all of a sudden you are very

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.840 
natural and all of a sudden you are very
far<00:00:55.680> behind<00:00:55.829> because<00:00:56.250> they<00:00:56.370> can<00:00:56.520> safely

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
far behind because they can safely

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.160 
far behind because they can safely
expand<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:57.420> Zurich<00:00:57.570> means<00:00:57.780> can't<00:00:57.989> leave

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
expand and Zurich means can't leave

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.779

because<00:00:58.410> that's<00:00:58.710> like<00:00:58.829> a<00:00:58.859> cannon<00:00:59.250> you<00:00:59.670> know

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789

important<00:01:21.930> rule<00:01:22.110> in<00:01:22.229> it<00:01:22.380> you<00:01:22.799> need<00:01:23.070> to<00:01:23.250> scout

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
important rule in it you need to scout

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.039 
important rule in it you need to scout
it<00:01:23.700> early<00:01:24.030> enough<00:01:24.060> now<00:01:24.509> I<00:01:24.540> don't<00:01:24.720> know<00:01:24.930> exactly

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
it early enough now I don't know exactly

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.590 
it early enough now I don't know exactly
in<00:01:25.470> a<00:01:25.680> specific<00:01:26.130> game<00:01:26.280> how<00:01:27.090> I<00:01:27.119> ended<00:01:27.479> up

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
in a specific game how I ended up

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.300 
in a specific game how I ended up
scouting<00:01:28.080> it<00:01:28.200> but<00:01:28.409> obviously<00:01:28.590> there's<00:01:29.100> ways

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
scouting it but obviously there's ways

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.060 
scouting it but obviously there's ways
to<00:01:29.340> do<00:01:29.610> so<00:01:29.820> I<00:01:30.000> can<00:01:30.479> put<00:01:30.630> my<00:01:30.659> very<00:01:30.990> first<00:01:31.350> or<00:01:31.920> my

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
to do so I can put my very first or my

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.590 
to do so I can put my very first or my
second<00:01:32.400> overboard<00:01:32.759> for<00:01:32.880> example<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.390> very

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
second overboard for example the very

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.050 
second overboard for example the very
first<00:01:33.659> one<00:01:33.990> that<00:01:34.020> creates<00:01:34.500> in<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.280> natural<00:01:35.820> so

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
first one that creates in the natural so

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.450 
first one that creates in the natural so
you<00:01:36.390> know<00:01:36.479> I<00:01:36.509> can<00:01:36.720> basically<00:01:36.869> shield<00:01:37.439> it<00:01:37.590> for

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
you know I can basically shield it for

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.609 
you know I can basically shield it for
my<00:01:38.640> for<00:01:39.119> my<00:01:39.210> natural<00:01:39.840> expansion<00:01:40.110> right<00:01:40.439> there

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
my for my natural expansion right there

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.620 
my for my natural expansion right there
or<00:01:41.430> you<00:01:41.579> can<00:01:41.759> just<00:01:41.909> run<00:01:42.119> around<00:01:42.210> with<00:01:42.600> a

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
or you can just run around with a

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.050 
or you can just run around with a
circling<00:01:43.140> or<00:01:43.320> run<00:01:44.100> away<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.280> drone<00:01:44.549> rudder<00:01:44.790> or

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
circling or run away the drone rudder or

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.670 
circling or run away the drone rudder or
you<00:01:45.180> can<00:01:45.329> do<00:01:45.479> some<00:01:45.630> early<00:01:45.810> game<00:01:46.049> scouting<00:01:46.320> and

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
you can do some early game scouting and

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.020 
you can do some early game scouting and
this<00:01:46.860> specific<00:01:47.220> image<00:01:47.430> you<00:01:47.520> can<00:01:47.640> see<00:01:47.729> I<00:01:47.759> am

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
this specific image you can see I am

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.789 
this specific image you can see I am
opting<00:01:48.420> to<00:01:48.810> do<00:01:48.990> a<00:01:49.020> little<00:01:49.350> bit<00:01:49.470> of<00:01:49.590> drone

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
opting to do a little bit of drone

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.440 
opting to do a little bit of drone
scouting<00:01:50.250> right<00:01:50.369> now<00:01:50.520> knowing<00:01:50.729> that<00:01:51.030> my

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
scouting right now knowing that my

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.510 
scouting right now knowing that my
opponent<00:01:51.869> is<00:01:51.990> moving<00:01:52.409> in<00:01:52.560> with<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:53.189> drone

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
opponent is moving in with the drone

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.069 
opponent is moving in with the drone
right<00:01:53.729> now<00:01:53.850> and<00:01:54.000> I'm<00:01:54.060> following<00:01:54.240> this<00:01:54.479> up<00:01:54.659> this

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
right now and I'm following this up this

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.929 
right now and I'm following this up this
hatchery<00:01:55.290> first<00:01:55.799> with<00:01:56.340> a<00:01:56.520> spawning<00:01:56.820> pool

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
hatchery first with a spawning pool

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.090 
hatchery first with a spawning pool
right<00:01:57.270> now<00:01:57.299> is<00:01:57.659> basically<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.590> clue<00:01:58.799> okay

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
right now is basically the clue okay

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.090 
right now is basically the clue okay
here<00:01:59.369> is<00:01:59.490> what<00:01:59.520> happens<00:02:00.409> so<00:02:01.409> I<00:02:01.439> see<00:02:01.770> that<00:02:01.950> my

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
here is what happens so I see that my

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.280 
here is what happens so I see that my
opponent<00:02:02.549> puts<00:02:02.790> down<00:02:03.000> a<00:02:03.030> probe<00:02:03.479> or<00:02:03.719> a<00:02:03.810> sensor

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
opponent puts down a probe or a sensor

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.709 
opponent puts down a probe or a sensor
probe<00:02:04.530> to<00:02:04.710> my<00:02:04.829> natural<00:02:05.040> puts<00:02:05.880> down<00:02:06.090> this<00:02:06.240> pylon

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
probe to my natural puts down this pylon

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.660 
probe to my natural puts down this pylon
right<00:02:06.990> away<00:02:07.259> now<00:02:07.829> there's<00:02:08.039> a<00:02:08.129> couple<00:02:08.340> things

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
right away now there's a couple things

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.609 
right away now there's a couple things
to<00:02:08.970> this<00:02:09.119> obviously<00:02:09.750> this<00:02:09.899> could<00:02:10.110> be<00:02:10.289> a<00:02:10.319> fake

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
to this obviously this could be a fake

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.070 
to this obviously this could be a fake
but<00:02:11.250> considering<00:02:12.030> the<00:02:12.150> timing<00:02:12.450> on<00:02:12.660> the<00:02:12.810> probe

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
but considering the timing on the probe

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.460 
but considering the timing on the probe
and<00:02:13.290> it

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
and it

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.200 
and it
pretty<00:02:13.770> early<00:02:13.860> and<00:02:14.340> there<00:02:14.550> is<00:02:14.640> really<00:02:14.910> no

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
pretty early and there is really no

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.030 
pretty early and there is really no
reason<00:02:15.480> for<00:02:15.690> him<00:02:15.930> to<00:02:16.050> put<00:02:16.230> down<00:02:16.260> this<00:02:16.560> pylon

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
reason for him to put down this pylon

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.710 
reason for him to put down this pylon
unless<00:02:17.610> he<00:02:17.730> really<00:02:17.880> wants<00:02:18.120> to<00:02:18.180> scare<00:02:18.450> me<00:02:18.630> and

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
unless he really wants to scare me and

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.170 
unless he really wants to scare me and
try<00:02:18.900> and<00:02:19.050> trick<00:02:19.260> me<00:02:19.290> into<00:02:19.530> defending<00:02:20.070> it<00:02:20.190> I<00:02:20.340> am

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
try and trick me into defending it I am

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.240 
try and trick me into defending it I am
going<00:02:21.450> to<00:02:21.570> assume<00:02:21.930> that<00:02:21.990> this<00:02:22.470> is<00:02:22.530> going<00:02:22.710> to<00:02:23.100> be

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
going to assume that this is going to be

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.160 
going to assume that this is going to be
a<00:02:23.280> cannon<00:02:23.670> rush<00:02:23.850> okay<00:02:24.180> now<00:02:24.660> there's<00:02:24.840> a<00:02:24.930> couple

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
a cannon rush okay now there's a couple

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.320 
a cannon rush okay now there's a couple
ways<00:02:25.350> you<00:02:25.560> have<00:02:26.400> to<00:02:26.430> approach<00:02:26.790> this<00:02:26.970> so<00:02:27.150> very

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
ways you have to approach this so very

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.570 
ways you have to approach this so very
first<00:02:27.660> thing<00:02:27.810> you<00:02:28.410> have<00:02:28.590> to<00:02:28.770> do<00:02:28.920> is<00:02:29.130> think

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
first thing you have to do is think

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.540 
first thing you have to do is think
about<00:02:29.700> the<00:02:29.880> fact<00:02:30.530> where<00:02:31.530> he<00:02:31.740> will<00:02:31.950> be<00:02:32.070> placing

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
about the fact where he will be placing

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.430 
about the fact where he will be placing
his<00:02:32.670> cannon<00:02:33.000> so<00:02:33.120> if<00:02:33.270> you<00:02:33.360> think<00:02:33.510> about<00:02:33.660> or<00:02:34.260> if

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
his cannon so if you think about or if

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.570 
his cannon so if you think about or if
you<00:02:34.500> think<00:02:34.650> it's<00:02:34.860> a<00:02:34.920> Pro<00:02:35.100> Tools<00:02:35.130> right<00:02:35.460> now

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
you think it's a Pro Tools right now

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:36.950 
you think it's a Pro Tools right now
okay<00:02:35.790> let's<00:02:35.940> just<00:02:36.120> go<00:02:36.270> to<00:02:36.330> his<00:02:36.540> visions<00:02:36.900> just

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:36.960 
okay let's just go to his visions just

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.440 
okay let's just go to his visions just
for<00:02:37.550> explorations<00:02:38.550> sake

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
for explorations sake

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.330 
for explorations sake
as<00:02:39.720> you<00:02:39.930> can<00:02:40.050> see<00:02:40.260> right<00:02:40.410> now<00:02:40.470> his<00:02:40.770> vision<00:02:41.190> the

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
as you can see right now his vision the

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:42.890 
as you can see right now his vision the
only<00:02:41.910> thing<00:02:42.060> he<00:02:42.120> really<00:02:42.330> knows<00:02:42.480> is<00:02:42.660> that<00:02:42.690> he

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
only thing he really knows is that he

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.540 
only thing he really knows is that he
has<00:02:42.990> to<00:02:43.020> probe<00:02:43.470> some<00:02:43.650> be<00:02:43.740> honest<00:02:43.950> or<00:02:44.160> all<00:02:44.400> like

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
has to probe some be honest or all like

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.100 
has to probe some be honest or all like
my<00:02:44.730> side<00:02:44.970> of<00:02:45.090> the<00:02:45.180> map<00:02:45.330> as<00:02:45.480> far<00:02:45.660> as<00:02:45.720> you<00:02:45.810> can<00:02:45.930> say

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
my side of the map as far as you can say

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.500 
my side of the map as far as you can say
and<00:02:46.890> that<00:02:46.920> I<00:02:47.100> went<00:02:47.490> for<00:02:47.550> a<00:02:47.730> very<00:02:48.150> early

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
and that I went for a very early

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.570 
and that I went for a very early
hatchery<00:02:49.230> that's<00:02:49.800> the<00:02:49.920> only<00:02:50.100> thing<00:02:50.280> he<00:02:50.370> really

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
hatchery that's the only thing he really

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.340 
hatchery that's the only thing he really
knows<00:02:50.760> right<00:02:50.970> now<00:02:51.000> so<00:02:51.570> if<00:02:51.840> you<00:02:52.020> were<00:02:52.200> to

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
knows right now so if you were to

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.230 
knows right now so if you were to
ProTools<00:02:52.770> in<00:02:52.860> this<00:02:53.010> situation<00:02:53.610> where<00:02:53.940> do<00:02:54.090> you

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
ProTools in this situation where do you

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.050 
ProTools in this situation where do you
want<00:02:54.450> to<00:02:54.510> try<00:02:54.780> and<00:02:55.050> build<00:02:55.590> your<00:02:55.920> pylons<00:02:56.459> where

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
want to try and build your pylons where

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.550 
want to try and build your pylons where
do<00:02:57.180> you<00:02:57.270> want<00:02:57.480> to<00:02:57.510> try<00:02:57.750> and<00:02:57.990> put<00:02:58.170> down<00:02:58.350> your

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
do you want to try and put down your

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.620 
do you want to try and put down your
cannons<00:02:58.980> now<00:02:59.070> in<00:02:59.340> more<00:02:59.580> often<00:02:59.910> than<00:03:00.030> not<00:03:00.060> you

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
cannons now in more often than not you

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.540 
cannons now in more often than not you
want<00:03:00.840> to<00:03:00.930> try<00:03:01.170> and<00:03:01.410> reduce<00:03:01.530> the<00:03:01.950> surface<00:03:02.220> area

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
want to try and reduce the surface area

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.699 
want to try and reduce the surface area
so<00:03:03.180> let's<00:03:03.390> say<00:03:03.570> there<00:03:03.780> is<00:03:03.810> like<00:03:04.140> a<00:03:04.170> cannon<00:03:04.530> out

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
so let's say there is like a cannon out

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:06.260 
so let's say there is like a cannon out
in<00:03:04.860> the<00:03:04.950> open<00:03:05.250> right<00:03:05.400> around<00:03:05.610> right<00:03:05.850> here<00:03:06.150> I

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
in the open right around right here I

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.270 
in the open right around right here I
will<00:03:06.660> be<00:03:06.780> able<00:03:07.020> to<00:03:07.140> kill<00:03:07.320> that<00:03:07.350> easily<00:03:07.980> because

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
will be able to kill that easily because

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.340 
will be able to kill that easily because
I<00:03:08.400> can<00:03:08.520> just<00:03:08.640> simply<00:03:08.820> surround<00:03:09.360> it<00:03:09.600> so<00:03:10.050> what

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
I can just simply surround it so what

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:11.870 
I can just simply surround it so what
will<00:03:10.500> more<00:03:10.650> often<00:03:10.800> than<00:03:11.040> not<00:03:11.070> happen<00:03:11.520> is<00:03:11.670> that

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
will more often than not happen is that

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.400 
will more often than not happen is that
the<00:03:12.000> cannon<00:03:12.270> will<00:03:12.390> be<00:03:12.420> put<00:03:12.690> down<00:03:12.780> right<00:03:13.050> next

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
the cannon will be put down right next

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.710 
the cannon will be put down right next
to<00:03:13.680> like<00:03:14.520> the<00:03:14.640> gas<00:03:14.820> geyser<00:03:15.120> right<00:03:15.390> there<00:03:15.570> and

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
to like the gas geyser right there and

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.150 
to like the gas geyser right there and
apply<00:03:15.959> them<00:03:16.200> just<00:03:16.440> to<00:03:16.530> reduce<00:03:16.860> the<00:03:16.980> surface

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
apply them just to reduce the surface

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.400 
apply them just to reduce the surface
area<00:03:17.519> or<00:03:17.820> maybe<00:03:18.060> in<00:03:18.360> this<00:03:18.510> little<00:03:18.870> like<00:03:19.080> hook

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
area or maybe in this little like hook

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.100 
area or maybe in this little like hook
right<00:03:19.650> there<00:03:19.709> that<00:03:20.100> is<00:03:20.220> very<00:03:20.550> annoying<00:03:21.110> to

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
right there that is very annoying to

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:23.750 
right there that is very annoying to
take<00:03:22.530> out<00:03:22.709> as<00:03:22.860> well<00:03:23.010> because<00:03:23.280> I<00:03:23.310> simply<00:03:23.519> don't

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
take out as well because I simply don't

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.030 
take out as well because I simply don't
have<00:03:23.940> very<00:03:24.030> much<00:03:24.239> room<00:03:24.450> to<00:03:24.510> surround<00:03:24.959> now<00:03:25.560> that

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
have very much room to surround now that

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.710 
have very much room to surround now that
is<00:03:26.160> the<00:03:26.280> very<00:03:26.489> first<00:03:26.550> thing<00:03:26.910> to<00:03:27.030> realize<00:03:27.150> now

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
is the very first thing to realize now

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.660 
is the very first thing to realize now
the<00:03:27.780> worst-case<00:03:28.470> scenario<00:03:29.010> is<00:03:29.220> that<00:03:29.280> your

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
the worst-case scenario is that your

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.699 
the worst-case scenario is that your
laude<00:03:30.030> proto's<00:03:30.510> player<00:03:30.690> to<00:03:30.959> put<00:03:31.110> down<00:03:31.320> cannons

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
laude proto's player to put down cannons

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.710 
laude proto's player to put down cannons
in<00:03:31.980> those<00:03:32.370> locations<00:03:32.760> because<00:03:33.180> then<00:03:33.540> you're

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
in those locations because then you're

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.300 
in those locations because then you're
pretty<00:03:33.900> much<00:03:34.110> dead<00:03:34.290> already<00:03:34.560> so<00:03:34.830> the<00:03:35.130> very

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
pretty much dead already so the very

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:36.770 
pretty much dead already so the very
first<00:03:35.489> thing<00:03:35.640> I<00:03:35.880> do<00:03:35.940> right<00:03:36.390> here<00:03:36.600> in<00:03:36.690> this

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
first thing I do right here in this

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.259 
first thing I do right here in this
scenario<00:03:37.080> is<00:03:37.440> grab<00:03:38.190> a<00:03:38.220> couple<00:03:38.519> of<00:03:38.760> drones<00:03:39.030> I

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
scenario is grab a couple of drones I

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:40.880 
scenario is grab a couple of drones I
believe<00:03:39.510> I<00:03:39.600> grab<00:03:39.810> like<00:03:39.959> three<00:03:40.200> right<00:03:40.440> here<00:03:40.709> and

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
believe I grab like three right here and

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.490 
believe I grab like three right here and
put<00:03:41.580> them<00:03:41.760> on<00:03:41.940> patrol<00:03:42.420> in<00:03:42.570> these<00:03:42.900> locations

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
put them on patrol in these locations

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.110 
put them on patrol in these locations
okay<00:03:43.799> so<00:03:43.980> that's<00:03:44.250> step<00:03:44.459> number<00:03:44.519> one<00:03:44.760> right<00:03:45.090> now

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
okay so that's step number one right now

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.000 
okay so that's step number one right now
if<00:03:45.299> we<00:03:45.390> go<00:03:45.480> back<00:03:45.630> to<00:03:45.660> my<00:03:45.870> vision<00:03:46.200> I'm<00:03:46.560> basically

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
if we go back to my vision I'm basically

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:48.470 
if we go back to my vision I'm basically
selecting<00:03:47.580> all<00:03:47.730> of<00:03:47.760> these<00:03:48.000> probes<00:03:48.269> and<00:03:48.390> I'm

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
selecting all of these probes and I'm

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.330 
selecting all of these probes and I'm
putting<00:03:48.780> them<00:03:48.900> into<00:03:49.110> the<00:03:49.320> locations<00:03:49.799> that<00:03:49.950> are

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
putting them into the locations that are

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.729 
putting them into the locations that are
hardest<00:03:50.820> to<00:03:50.970> or<00:03:51.540> hardest<00:03:52.019> to<00:03:52.140> defend<00:03:52.470> for<00:03:52.620> me

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
hardest to or hardest to defend for me

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:55.070 
hardest to or hardest to defend for me
so<00:03:53.160> as<00:03:53.250> you<00:03:53.340> can<00:03:53.430> see<00:03:53.489> right<00:03:53.790> here<00:03:54.080> these

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080 
so as you can see right here these

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.840 
so as you can see right here these
probes<00:03:55.440> for<00:03:55.620> these<00:03:55.950> drones<00:03:56.220> water<00:03:56.459> are<00:03:56.670> gonna

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
probes for these drones water are gonna

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:58.580 
probes for these drones water are gonna
start<00:03:57.150> patrolling<00:03:57.450> in<00:03:57.780> this<00:03:57.930> area<00:03:58.320> which

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
start patrolling in this area which

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.320 
start patrolling in this area which
means<00:03:58.830> that<00:03:59.010> he<00:03:59.160> will<00:03:59.340> not<00:03:59.580> be<00:03:59.700> able<00:03:59.820> to<00:04:00.030> put

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.330 
means that he will not be able to put

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.960 
means that he will not be able to put
his<00:04:00.450> panels<00:04:00.900> down<00:04:01.080> in<00:04:01.320> the<00:04:01.799> ideal<00:04:02.310> locations

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
his panels down in the ideal locations

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.880 
his panels down in the ideal locations
now<00:04:03.510> since<00:04:03.900> he's<00:04:04.049> committed<00:04:04.470> to<00:04:04.500> this<00:04:04.650> since

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
now since he's committed to this since

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:06.289 
now since he's committed to this since
you<00:04:04.980> put<00:04:05.190> down<00:04:05.310> the<00:04:05.459> panel<00:04:05.820> and<00:04:05.940> you<00:04:06.030> let<00:04:06.180> the

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:06.299 
you put down the panel and you let the

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:08.240 
you put down the panel and you let the
pylon<00:04:06.630> finish<00:04:07.049> I<00:04:07.200> know<00:04:07.440> for<00:04:07.830> a<00:04:07.860> fact<00:04:07.920> that<00:04:08.190> he

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
pylon finish I know for a fact that he

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.160 
pylon finish I know for a fact that he
is<00:04:08.400> gonna<00:04:08.549> put<00:04:08.760> down<00:04:08.910> cannons<00:04:09.269> now<00:04:09.720> how<00:04:09.930> do<00:04:09.989> you

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
is gonna put down cannons now how do you

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.320 
is gonna put down cannons now how do you
actually<00:04:10.380> kill<00:04:10.830> cannons<00:04:11.250> first<00:04:11.549> off<00:04:11.760> jerkings

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:12.330 
actually kill cannons first off jerkings

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.090 
actually kill cannons first off jerkings
are<00:04:12.420> gonna<00:04:12.570> be<00:04:12.780> basically<00:04:13.260> the<00:04:13.590> heroes<00:04:13.920> in

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100 
are gonna be basically the heroes in

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
to kill a building cannon but if the

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:26.840 
to kill a building cannon but if the
cannon<00:04:26.220> is<00:04:26.310> already

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
cannon is already

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:29.390 
cannon is already
done<00:04:27.450> you<00:04:28.020> might<00:04:28.230> want<00:04:28.440> to<00:04:28.500> set<00:04:28.740> for<00:04:29.070> drones

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
done you might want to set for drones

them so here we go more and more workers

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.250 
them so here we go more and more workers
coming<00:04:42.090> down<00:04:42.330> I<00:04:42.480> don't<00:04:42.540> really<00:04:42.870> want<00:04:43.050> to<00:04:43.110> pull

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:46.290 
mining going on but as you can see I am

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:49.040 
mining going on but as you can see I am
trying<00:04:46.500> to<00:04:46.770> target<00:04:47.040> fire<00:04:47.370> down<00:04:47.760> each<00:04:48.330> cannon

with about three to four workers which I
know<00:04:51.420> for<00:04:51.750> a<00:04:51.780> fact<00:04:51.810> will<00:04:52.530> kill<00:04:52.830> it

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.130 
know for a fact will kill it

know for a fact will kill it
now<00:04:53.370> you<00:04:53.430> do<00:04:53.700> need<00:04:53.850> to<00:04:54.030> micro<00:04:54.390> very<00:04:54.600> hard<00:04:54.810> right

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:54.990 
now you do need to micro very hard right

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:56.990 
now you do need to micro very hard right
here<00:04:55.110> there<00:04:55.320> is<00:04:55.440> no<00:04:55.680> easy<00:04:55.980> way<00:04:56.130> of<00:04:56.370> doing<00:04:56.670> this

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 
here there is no easy way of doing this

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.660 
here there is no easy way of doing this
and<00:04:57.660> you<00:04:57.750> simply<00:04:57.990> need<00:04:58.410> to<00:04:58.440> you<00:04:59.160> know<00:04:59.280> think

00:04:59.660 --> 00:04:59.670 
and you simply need to you know think

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:01.790 
and you simply need to you know think
ahead<00:04:59.790> think<00:05:00.300> ahead<00:05:00.510> now<00:05:00.960> what<00:05:01.170> other<00:05:01.440> things

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
ahead think ahead now what other things

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:02.930 
ahead think ahead now what other things
you<00:05:01.860> keep<00:05:02.010> in<00:05:02.190> mind<00:05:02.220> as<00:05:02.430> well<00:05:02.580> is<00:05:02.730> that<00:05:02.820> you

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:02.940 
you keep in mind as well is that you

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:04.790 
you keep in mind as well is that you
constantly<00:05:03.420> click<00:05:03.810> those<00:05:04.020> buildings<00:05:04.470> to<00:05:04.590> see

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 
constantly click those buildings to see

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.980 
constantly click those buildings to see
what<00:05:05.010> is<00:05:05.100> actually<00:05:05.460> building<00:05:05.880> for<00:05:06.390> example<00:05:06.840> if

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:06.990 
what is actually building for example if

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:08.900 
what is actually building for example if
this<00:05:07.170> would<00:05:07.320> have<00:05:07.410> been<00:05:07.530> a<00:05:07.560> pylon<00:05:07.830> it<00:05:08.370> is<00:05:08.550> not

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:08.910 
this would have been a pylon it is not

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.780 
this would have been a pylon it is not
worked<00:05:09.300> my<00:05:09.540> drone<00:05:10.430> time-killing<00:05:11.430> down<00:05:11.640> that

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:11.790 
worked my drone time-killing down that

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:13.010 
worked my drone time-killing down that
pilum<00:05:12.120> because<00:05:12.330> the<00:05:12.420> pilot<00:05:12.690> was<00:05:12.810> not<00:05:12.840> gonna

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.020 
pilum because the pilot was not gonna

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:14.990 
pilum because the pilot was not gonna
die<00:05:13.230> two<00:05:13.290> three<00:05:13.620> workers<00:05:13.980> only<00:05:14.160> so<00:05:14.700> only

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000 
die two three workers only so only

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.760 
die two three workers only so only
really<00:05:15.390> target<00:05:15.750> fire<00:05:15.960> down<00:05:16.200> the<00:05:16.380> photon

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:16.770 
really target fire down the photon

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.200 
really target fire down the photon
cannons<00:05:17.100> and<00:05:17.220> later<00:05:17.400> when<00:05:17.550> the<00:05:17.640> serpents<00:05:18.060> come

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:18.210 
cannons and later when the serpents come

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:20.030 
cannons and later when the serpents come
out<00:05:18.390> make<00:05:18.870> sure<00:05:18.900> your<00:05:19.170> target<00:05:19.320> fire<00:05:19.710> down<00:05:19.920> two

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:20.040 
out make sure your target fire down two

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.800 
out make sure your target fire down two
panels<00:05:20.460> as<00:05:20.580> well<00:05:20.760> so<00:05:21.120> for<00:05:21.240> the<00:05:21.300> time<00:05:21.450> being<00:05:21.660> you

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:21.810 
panels as well so for the time being you

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:23.060 
panels as well so for the time being you
can<00:05:21.840> see<00:05:22.080> me<00:05:22.200> frantically<00:05:22.620> clicking<00:05:22.950> between

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:23.070 
can see me frantically clicking between

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:24.230 
can see me frantically clicking between
these<00:05:23.370> things<00:05:23.550> all<00:05:23.700> the<00:05:23.790> time<00:05:23.970> as<00:05:24.120> well

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 
these things all the time as well

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.220 
these things all the time as well
checking<00:05:24.660> whether<00:05:24.840> or<00:05:24.930> not<00:05:24.990> they're<00:05:25.140> actually

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:25.230 
checking whether or not they're actually

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:27.110 
checking whether or not they're actually
cannons<00:05:25.710> now<00:05:25.860> at<00:05:26.250> this<00:05:26.340> point<00:05:26.520> I<00:05:26.730> am<00:05:26.850> a<00:05:26.940> wearing

cannons now at this point I am a wearing

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.820 
cannons now at this point I am a wearing
all<00:05:27.360> three<00:05:27.660> of<00:05:27.780> those<00:05:27.930> things<00:05:27.990> our<00:05:28.440> cannons

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:28.830 
all three of those things our cannons

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:30.410 
all three of those things our cannons
and<00:05:29.010> I'm<00:05:29.310> trying<00:05:29.520> to<00:05:29.610> figure<00:05:29.760> out<00:05:29.880> oh<00:05:30.090> is<00:05:30.270> that

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:30.420 
and I'm trying to figure out oh is that

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:31.880 
and I'm trying to figure out oh is that
gonna<00:05:30.510> be<00:05:30.690> a<00:05:30.720> cannon<00:05:30.990> as<00:05:31.080> well<00:05:31.290> clicking<00:05:31.710> on<00:05:31.800> it

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:31.890 
gonna be a cannon as well clicking on it

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:33.140 
gonna be a cannon as well clicking on it
right<00:05:32.070> there<00:05:32.100> oh<00:05:32.340> yeah<00:05:32.640> it's<00:05:32.850> gonna<00:05:32.970> be

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:33.150 
right there oh yeah it's gonna be

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:49.640 
okay and that is part of the story that
is<00:05:48.060> crucial<00:05:48.300> as<00:05:48.600> well<00:05:48.750> you<00:05:49.200> need<00:05:49.440> to<00:05:49.500> have

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:49.650 
is crucial as well you need to have

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:51.500 
is crucial as well you need to have
deserting<00:05:50.340> down<00:05:50.550> right<00:05:50.730> now<00:05:50.880> now<00:05:51.270> it<00:05:51.330> is<00:05:51.480> a

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:51.510 
deserting down right now now it is a

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:53.780 
deserting down right now now it is a
little<00:05:51.780> bit<00:05:52.080> of<00:05:52.830> an<00:05:53.010> issue<00:05:53.130> right<00:05:53.490> here<00:05:53.520> in

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:53.790 
little bit of an issue right here in

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:55.910 
little bit of an issue right here in
this<00:05:53.910> little<00:05:54.090> corner<00:05:54.420> as<00:05:54.540> you<00:05:54.600> can<00:05:54.750> see<00:05:54.930> there

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:55.920 
this little corner as you can see there

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.610 
this little corner as you can see there
is<00:05:56.040> not<00:05:56.280> that<00:05:56.310> much<00:05:56.730> that<00:05:57.390> much<00:05:57.600> defense<00:05:58.320> going

00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:58.620 
is not that much that much defense going

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:00.950 
is not that much that much defense going
on<00:05:58.740> for<00:05:58.920> this<00:05:59.040> one<00:05:59.220> photo<00:05:59.520> cannon<00:05:59.970> and<00:06:00.090> by<00:06:00.810> all

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:00.960 
on for this one photo cannon and by all

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:02.510 
on for this one photo cannon and by all
means<00:06:00.990> I'm<00:06:01.350> not<00:06:01.530> defending<00:06:01.860> this<00:06:02.010> perfectly

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:02.520 
means I'm not defending this perfectly

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:03.950 
means I'm not defending this perfectly
either<00:06:02.640> I<00:06:02.820> should<00:06:03.060> be<00:06:03.210> shift<00:06:03.450> commanding<00:06:03.900> a

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:03.960 
either I should be shift commanding a

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:05.570 
either I should be shift commanding a
lot<00:06:04.080> more<00:06:04.290> and<00:06:04.500> just<00:06:04.740> being<00:06:04.920> more<00:06:05.010> aggressive

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:05.580 
lot more and just being more aggressive

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:07.700 
lot more and just being more aggressive
with<00:06:05.670> it<00:06:05.790> all<00:06:05.910> but<00:06:06.330> all<00:06:06.780> I<00:06:06.810> know<00:06:07.020> this<00:06:07.530> is

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:09.330 
looking all right I got my search inside

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:10.760 
looking all right I got my search inside
right<00:06:09.540> now<00:06:09.570> I<00:06:09.840> am<00:06:10.050> making<00:06:10.170> more<00:06:10.560> and<00:06:10.620> more

there's no need to by the way make
drones

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:12.510 
drones

one one who or one clue as well to

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:17.330 
one one who or one clue as well to
defending<00:06:15.750> this<00:06:15.870> is<00:06:16.080> that<00:06:16.290> once<00:06:17.040> you<00:06:17.160> usually

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:17.340 
defending this is that once you usually

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:18.770 
defending this is that once you usually
defenses<00:06:17.970> you<00:06:18.000> will<00:06:18.210> be<00:06:18.300> super<00:06:18.570> far<00:06:18.750> ahead

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:18.780 
defenses you will be super far ahead

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:20.570 
defenses you will be super far ahead
anyway<00:06:19.260> unless<00:06:19.620> you<00:06:19.740> lose<00:06:19.860> a<00:06:19.920> lot<00:06:20.100> of<00:06:20.220> workers

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:20.580 
anyway unless you lose a lot of workers

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:22.220 
anyway unless you lose a lot of workers
but<00:06:21.030> this<00:06:21.150> guy<00:06:21.300> is<00:06:21.360> pretty<00:06:21.690> much<00:06:21.870> completely

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:22.230 
but this guy is pretty much completely

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:24.200 
but this guy is pretty much completely
all-in<00:06:22.530> at<00:06:22.650> this<00:06:22.770> point<00:06:23.010> so<00:06:23.640> just<00:06:23.820> committing

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:25.350 
to making a lot of circlings and then

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:27.440 
to making a lot of circlings and then
counter-attack<00:06:25.920> instead<00:06:26.280> and<00:06:26.970> as<00:06:27.120> long<00:06:27.270> as<00:06:27.300> I

managed to kill all of this I know for a

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:30.800 
managed to kill all of this I know for a
fact<00:06:29.370> that<00:06:29.760> I<00:06:29.790> will<00:06:30.060> be<00:06:30.180> fine<00:06:30.330> so<00:06:30.540> I'm<00:06:30.600> still

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:30.810 
fact that I will be fine so I'm still

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:32.270 
fact that I will be fine so I'm still
attack<00:06:31.080> moving<00:06:31.380> with<00:06:31.530> the<00:06:31.650> drones<00:06:31.890> right<00:06:32.100> here

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:32.280 
attack moving with the drones right here

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:34.070 
attack moving with the drones right here
as<00:06:32.370> well<00:06:32.580> still<00:06:33.060> attack<00:06:33.330> moving<00:06:33.630> with<00:06:33.780> desert

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:34.080 
as well still attack moving with desert

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:36.170 
as well still attack moving with desert
things<00:06:34.350> making<00:06:34.620> sure<00:06:35.040> that<00:06:35.460> my<00:06:35.610> opponent<00:06:36.030> does

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:36.180 
things making sure that my opponent does

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:37.640 
things making sure that my opponent does
not<00:06:36.210> finish<00:06:36.570> off<00:06:36.840> any<00:06:37.050> more<00:06:37.380> of

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:37.650 
not finish off any more of

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:39.830 
not finish off any more of
Canon's<00:06:38.160> and<00:06:38.280> my<00:06:38.759> opponent<00:06:39.240> leaves<00:06:39.449> the<00:06:39.660> game

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:39.840 
Canon's and my opponent leaves the game

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:42.560 
Canon's and my opponent leaves the game
so<00:06:40.259> there<00:06:41.100> are<00:06:41.220> basically<00:06:41.370> two<00:06:41.940> rules<00:06:42.270> to<00:06:42.389> this

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:42.570 
so there are basically two rules to this

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:44.450 
so there are basically two rules to this
okay<00:06:42.840> well<00:06:43.500> there's<00:06:43.740> actually<00:06:43.860> a<00:06:44.070> couple<00:06:44.220> more

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:44.460 
okay well there's actually a couple more

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:46.159 
okay well there's actually a couple more
but<00:06:44.880> the<00:06:44.970> first<00:06:45.210> one<00:06:45.389> is<00:06:45.419> to<00:06:45.600> actually<00:06:45.720> scouted

00:06:46.159 --> 00:06:46.169 
but the first one is to actually scouted

00:06:46.169 --> 00:06:47.570 
but the first one is to actually scouted
okay<00:06:46.680> you<00:06:46.740> can<00:06:46.949> do<00:06:47.039> this<00:06:47.190> either<00:06:47.340> wooden

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:47.580 
okay you can do this either wooden

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:49.129 
okay you can do this either wooden
Overlord<00:06:48.030> or<00:06:48.360> where<00:06:48.660> that<00:06:48.780> drone<00:06:48.990> that's

00:06:49.129 --> 00:06:49.139 
Overlord or where that drone that's

00:06:49.139 --> 00:06:51.439 
Overlord or where that drone that's
patrolling<00:06:49.590> the<00:06:49.650> natural<00:06:50.070> second<00:06:50.789> step<00:06:51.240> to

00:06:51.439 --> 00:06:51.449 
patrolling the natural second step to

00:06:51.449 --> 00:06:53.600 
patrolling the natural second step to
take<00:06:51.660> is<00:06:51.870> to<00:06:51.900> actually<00:06:52.169> put<00:06:52.590> the<00:06:53.039> drones<00:06:53.400> on

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:53.610 
take is to actually put the drones on

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:55.400 
take is to actually put the drones on
the<00:06:53.639> patrol<00:06:54.120> position<00:06:54.660> in<00:06:54.810> like<00:06:55.020> the<00:06:55.199> most

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:55.410 
the patrol position in like the most
