00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:21.029
 welcome the fantastic plastic no matter if 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:24.250
 chevrolet corvette of all generations 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:27.369
 the drifts the renault alpine 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.990
 or the paralysis you the ford gt 40 you 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:32.020
 everyone owns all their bodies 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:33.340
 Be plastic for over 50 years 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:37.000
 car bodies already out 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:40.210
 fiberglass short gfk molded the 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.070
 Advantages GFK can not rust easier 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.440
 as a sheet and has a certain 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:48.220
 elasticity with small remplern 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:50.530
 protects the disadvantages also plastic age 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.970
 gets brittle and cracked and offers 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.590
 an accident little protection 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:56.770
 However, minor damage can be 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:01:02.309
 relatively easy we love our proband 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:02.309
 a renault alpine a310 from 1978 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.290
 body of the cars were 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:10.990
 actually always made of glass fibers 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.970
 that were soaked with resin and you 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.710
 must pay attention to attachments such as 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.780
 for example, these bumpers hint 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.030
 lip here are from a very different 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.890
 material that you definitely do not like that 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.869
 those are thermoplastics that are allowed to treat 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:26.160
 were built with heat effect and 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:26.160
 may be repaired 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:32.070
 First, the defective material 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:36.180
 remote angle grinder are suitable 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:38.070
 especially for the paint around 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.730
 The button becomes generous 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.730
 abraded 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.600
 the sk repair sentences can be found 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.780
 for example, car accessories stores and 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.670
 hardware stores the impacting of here 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.920
 Evidently it happened in the back 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.990
 which has so far created a hole 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.729
 and this hole we have inside with 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.549
 help from these solid mats in one 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:02.939
 three-ply layer rebuilt from 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:05.280
 used them for the outer layer 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.899
 A fine glass fiber flows with it 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.300
 The outer shape is particularly good 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.640
 can be modeled after and so it gets 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.790
 The mat is made with scissors 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:17.099
 the correct size is the cut 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.959
 matt matching ready to mix the resin 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:21.390
 with the appropriate amount of hardness 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:23.459
 the whole is mixed well and 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.010
 should be processed quickly 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.360
 finds the right mix ratio 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.580
 one in the instructions for use 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.769
 first, the damaged place 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.200
 generously coated with resin 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:36.329
 then the fiberglass mat is created 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.610
 coated with resin and the 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:43.280
 Body shape adapted to the 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.280
 Drying time at least 24 hours 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:47.230
 the gross surpluses will be here 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:48.010
 with the fan loop again 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.480
 worn 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.730
 Personally , I leave it to him 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.140
 Lackierer which does not decrease too much 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.850
 so he does not look the same again 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.650
 we must avoid filling that 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:59.560
 and then makes quite normal system 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.870
 With some practice you can build up 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.400
 on larger repairs dare the 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.020
 broken front wing of one 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.670
 race car no problem 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.840
 here comes the first 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.840
 grinding machine for 1 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.380
 I have all the material with the 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.910
 sweep away what is quite loose 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.280
 so that I have awarded the 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.290
 fit each other and of course the 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.640
 Weathering the years all the dust 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.770
 and street dirt I have too 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:32.820
 ground down that it is a clean glue 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:35.450
 pad are Liveband prevents 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:37.890
 Heart leaking through the repair job 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:40.709
 then the two gfk parts 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:42.380
 firmly fixed here come wood places and 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:44.250
 spax screws for use 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:46.470
 It is crucial that the two parts 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:50.670
 as stable and accurately connected 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:52.680
 be enough stability 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.450
 you should get the glass fiber mats 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.370
 cut generously 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.680
 here are the firmer ones had to 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.550
 use even with hard should not 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.350
 be saved 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:03.480
 but the resin is first with hardness 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:06.110
 blended is speedy processing 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.110
 hip, trendy, popular 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.460
 So now is the process of 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:13.430
 laminating past with this material 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:16.040
 that's going to be tough now , and now we have to 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:23.000
 mix a new one or as in our case 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:25.220
 to who finished after a dry season 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.980
 of 24 hours will screw 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:32.870
 Gently drilled out the wooden blocks 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:34.850
 and the tape removed if the 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:36.500
 disturb additional holes of the screws 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:40.090
 you can if possible with 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.090
 screw clamp to fix the parts 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:46.510
 removed or with the sander 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:46.510
 and school 

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:51.760
 Repair looks great there are not any 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:53.290
 air a key that would turn out to be 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:58.570
 very bright little spots here 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:05:01.570
 sign off and next work is 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:03.490
 the one that is rough on the outside 

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:05.650
 once again worked with the fan 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:07.630
 dispute with the area disc and then 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:09.100
 they come directly to lackierer imaging 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:10.630
 also these little holes by the way of 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.890
 to fill the screws again 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:14.500
 easy and then he is again 

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:16.510
 nice and fast are like that 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:19.890
 Repair saved a few hundred euros 

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:25.590
 and the alpine is back in action 

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:25.590
 Welcome to the fantastic plastic
