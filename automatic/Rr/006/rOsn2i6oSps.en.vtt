that horse and it kind of stiffen up and
step<00:02:29.520> backwards<00:02:29.910> I'd<00:02:30.000> approached<00:02:30.300> it<00:02:30.480> instead

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
step backwards I'd approached it instead

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:31.940

of brushing it and when it stepped
forward<00:02:32.220> I<00:02:32.490> would<00:02:32.970> have<00:02:33.060> stepped<00:02:33.270> away<00:02:33.510> there

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
forward I would have stepped away there

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.440 
forward I would have stepped away there
by<00:02:34.470> telling<00:02:34.800> the<00:02:34.890> horse<00:02:35.100> that<00:02:35.450> stepping

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
by telling the horse that stepping

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:37.970 
by telling the horse that stepping
backwards<00:02:36.900> doesn't<00:02:37.140> make<00:02:37.230> me<00:02:37.350> go<00:02:37.470> away<00:02:37.530> step

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
backwards doesn't make me go away step

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.200 
backwards doesn't make me go away step
it<00:02:38.100> before<00:02:38.280> he<00:02:38.340> does<00:02:38.490> and<00:02:38.940> I<00:02:39.000> would<00:02:39.120> have

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
it before he does and I would have

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.240 
it before he does and I would have
approached<00:02:39.510> it<00:02:39.690> again<00:02:39.960> and<00:02:40.800> done<00:02:41.100> it<00:02:41.190> again

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
approached it again and done it again

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:42.980 
approached it again and done it again
again<00:02:41.580> again<00:02:41.820> till<00:02:42.180> she<00:02:42.390> could<00:02:42.570> get<00:02:42.720> to<00:02:42.900> where

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
again again till she could get to where

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:44.180 
again again till she could get to where
that<00:02:43.110> horse<00:02:43.320> wasn't<00:02:43.560> bothered<00:02:43.890> by<00:02:44.010> her

till it's clean I don't teach anything

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.720 
till it's clean I don't teach anything
else<00:04:12.980> you<00:04:13.980> put<00:04:14.160> away<00:04:14.340> and<00:04:14.430> you<00:04:14.489> get<00:04:14.580> down

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
else you put away and you get down

else you put away and you get down
tomorrow<00:04:15.120> guess<00:04:15.570> where<00:04:15.870> you<00:04:15.989> are<00:04:16.169> you're<00:04:16.769> in

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
tomorrow guess where you are you're in

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:18.710 
tomorrow guess where you are you're in
exactly<00:04:17.310> the<00:04:17.459> same<00:04:17.489> place<00:04:17.910> as<00:04:18.269> you<00:04:18.330> were<00:04:18.600> the

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
exactly the same place as you were the

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.240 
exactly the same place as you were the
day<00:04:18.750> before<00:04:18.900> your<00:04:19.350> horse<00:04:19.530> is<00:04:19.650> just<00:04:19.680> as<00:04:20.010> dirty

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
day before your horse is just as dirty

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.130 
day before your horse is just as dirty
as<00:04:20.370> it<00:04:20.430> was<00:04:20.580> the<00:04:20.700> day<00:04:20.820> before<00:04:20.850> does<00:04:21.840> that<00:04:22.020> make

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
as it was the day before does that make

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:23.659 
as it was the day before does that make
sense<00:04:22.169> whereas<00:04:22.710> if<00:04:22.830> you<00:04:23.010> start<00:04:23.070> working<00:04:23.610> on

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
sense whereas if you start working on

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:24.800 
sense whereas if you start working on
this<00:04:23.789> stuff<00:04:24.000> like<00:04:24.180> this<00:04:24.360> mare<00:04:24.539> is<00:04:24.600> a<00:04:24.660> good

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
there even though she's kind of mocked

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.500 
there even though she's kind of mocked
like<00:04:28.740> a<00:04:28.770> quarter<00:04:29.100> horse<00:04:29.190> maybe<00:04:29.460> she's<00:04:30.180> a<00:04:30.210> warm
