00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
calm no more fear from exam so we have

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:09.320 
calm no more fear from exam so we have
water<00:00:07.770> so<00:00:08.099> we<00:00:08.189> have<00:00:08.220> two<00:00:08.490> kinds<00:00:08.730> of<00:00:08.790> water<00:00:09.000> hard

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
water so we have two kinds of water hard

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.419 
water so we have two kinds of water hard
water<00:00:09.540> and<00:00:09.690> soft<00:00:09.900> butter<00:00:10.170> you<00:00:11.070> must<00:00:11.250> have

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
water and soft butter you must have

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.129 
water and soft butter you must have
learned<00:00:11.700> this<00:00:11.849> in<00:00:12.000> class<00:00:12.210> ten<00:00:12.420> but<00:00:12.599> we'll<00:00:12.750> do<00:00:13.110> a

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
learned this in class ten but we'll do a

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:14.930 
learned this in class ten but we'll do a
little<00:00:13.259> more<00:00:13.559> deep<00:00:13.799> in<00:00:13.980> this<00:00:14.130> so<00:00:14.700> you<00:00:14.820> have

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
little more deep in this so you have

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.519 
little more deep in this so you have
something<00:00:15.150> of<00:00:15.299> hardware<00:00:15.690> and<00:00:15.870> software<00:00:15.960> will

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
something of hardware and software will

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.680 
something of hardware and software will
tell<00:00:16.680> you<00:00:16.830> how<00:00:17.100> to<00:00:17.160> different<00:00:17.550> sheet<00:00:17.699> also<00:00:17.850> so

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
tell you how to different sheet also so

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.240 
tell you how to different sheet also so
rain<00:00:18.869> water<00:00:19.140> is<00:00:19.260> the<00:00:19.380> most<00:00:19.560> pure<00:00:19.800> form<00:00:20.160> of

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
rain water is the most pure form of

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.980 
rain water is the most pure form of
water<00:00:20.460> it<00:00:20.880> is<00:00:20.970> almost<00:00:21.270> pure<00:00:21.480> form<00:00:21.750> what<00:00:21.960> is

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
water it is almost pure form what is

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.599 
water it is almost pure form what is
almost<00:00:22.260> pure<00:00:22.619> that's<00:00:22.800> not<00:00:22.980> most<00:00:23.279> pure<00:00:23.430> it's

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
almost pure that's not most pure it's

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.070 
almost pure that's not most pure it's
almost<00:00:23.970> pure<00:00:24.180> distilled<00:00:24.449> water<00:00:24.660> is<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:24.930> most

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
almost pure distilled water is the most

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.109 
almost pure distilled water is the most
play<00:00:25.289> for<00:00:25.500> water<00:00:25.710> and<00:00:26.039> then<00:00:26.460> water<00:00:26.670> is<00:00:26.849> almost

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
play for water and then water is almost

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.660 
play for water and then water is almost
equal<00:00:27.390> to<00:00:27.420> this<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:27.689> water<00:00:28.220> it's<00:00:29.220> almost<00:00:29.490> pure

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
equal to this the water it's almost pure

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.609 
equal to this the water it's almost pure
form<00:00:29.970> of<00:00:30.090> whatever<00:00:30.269> whatever<00:00:30.599> you<00:00:30.869> get<00:00:30.990> but

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
form of whatever whatever you get but

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.709 
form of whatever whatever you get but
when<00:00:31.830> it<00:00:32.340> comes<00:00:32.669> down<00:00:32.880> on<00:00:33.030> it

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
when it comes down on it

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.860 
when it comes down on it
they<00:00:34.140> acts<00:00:34.290> with<00:00:34.559> of<00:00:35.149> Moneygall<00:00:36.300> elements<00:00:36.780> in

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
they acts with of Moneygall elements in

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.790 
they acts with of Moneygall elements in
the<00:00:36.989> air<00:00:37.260> and<00:00:37.590> get<00:00:38.629> these<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:39.899> element<00:00:40.649> get

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
the air and get these the element get

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.389 
the air and get these the element get
mixed<00:00:41.070> in<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.280> water<00:00:41.460> and<00:00:41.850> so<00:00:42.210> it<00:00:42.420> doesn't<00:00:42.719> it

00:00:43.389 --> 00:00:43.399 
mixed in the water and so it doesn't it

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:46.520 
mixed in the water and so it doesn't it
it<00:00:44.399> loses<00:00:44.550> purity<00:00:45.270> so<00:00:45.930> if<00:00:46.020> we<00:00:46.140> say<00:00:46.320> almost

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
it loses purity so if we say almost

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.709 
it loses purity so if we say almost
particular<00:00:47.100> still<00:00:47.399> water<00:00:47.579> that<00:00:48.180> is<00:00:48.300> almost

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
particular still water that is almost

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.389 
particular still water that is almost
that<00:00:48.870> it<00:00:48.960> wasn't<00:00:49.289> clear<00:00:49.500> water<00:00:49.710> but<00:00:49.980> you<00:00:50.309> no

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
that it wasn't clear water but you no

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.490 
that it wasn't clear water but you no
matter<00:00:50.520> what<00:00:50.700> so<00:00:50.969> almost<00:00:51.239> almost<00:00:51.809> pure<00:00:52.260> water

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
matter what so almost almost pure water

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.709 
matter what so almost almost pure water
and<00:00:52.949> if<00:00:53.550> you<00:00:53.640> see<00:00:53.789> it's<00:00:53.910> a<00:00:53.969> good<00:00:54.090> solvent<00:00:54.360> so

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
and if you see it's a good solvent so

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.779 
and if you see it's a good solvent so
when<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:55.020> rainwater<00:00:55.230> flows<00:00:55.649> right<00:00:56.039> from

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
when the rainwater flows right from

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.520 
when the rainwater flows right from
mountains<00:00:57.329> let<00:00:57.570> this<00:00:57.660> be<00:00:57.840> mountain<00:00:58.350> from

the<00:01:42.270> very<00:01:42.420> very<00:01:42.479> good<00:01:42.780> solvent<00:01:43.140> it's<00:01:43.380> a<00:01:43.439> very

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
the very very good solvent it's a very

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.330 
the very very good solvent it's a very
good<00:01:43.770> solvent<00:01:43.950> and<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.670> moment<00:01:44.939> it<00:01:45.000> flows<00:01:45.210> it

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
good solvent and the moment it flows it

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.340 
good solvent and the moment it flows it
dissolves<00:01:47.340> lot<00:01:47.520> of<00:01:47.610> sorts<00:01:47.970> they<00:01:48.960> are<00:01:49.110> two

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
dissolves lot of sorts they are two

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.679 
dissolves lot of sorts they are two
different<00:01:49.590> salt<00:01:50.009> which<00:01:50.280> cause<00:01:50.520> how<00:01:50.759> handsome

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
different salt which cause how handsome

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.810 
different salt which cause how handsome
in<00:01:51.960> migration<00:01:52.439> we<00:01:53.009> will<00:01:53.250> talk<00:01:53.399> about<00:01:53.520> these

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
in migration we will talk about these

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.350 
in migration we will talk about these
calcium<00:01:54.750> and<00:01:54.840> magnesium<00:01:54.930> that<00:01:55.290> it<00:01:55.500> when<00:01:56.009> it<00:01:56.130> is

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
calcium and magnesium that it when it is

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.260 
calcium and magnesium that it when it is
flowing<00:01:57.860> the<00:01:58.860> water<00:01:59.040> becomes<00:01:59.369> on<00:01:59.520> when<00:02:00.090> will

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
flowing the water becomes on when will

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.270 
flowing the water becomes on when will
discuss<00:02:00.600> this<00:02:00.750> more

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
discuss this more

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.130 
discuss this more
right<00:02:03.280> so<00:02:03.520> the<00:02:04.240> presence<00:02:04.570> of<00:02:04.600> calcium<00:02:05.050> and

right so the presence of calcium and

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.150 
right so the presence of calcium and
magnesium<00:02:05.230> salt<00:02:05.790> makes<00:02:06.790> water<00:02:07.830> in<00:02:08.830> the<00:02:08.950> form

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
magnesium salt makes water in the form

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.720

Clumber<00:03:13.510> and<00:03:13.720> that<00:03:14.170> guy<00:03:14.350> I<00:03:14.590> just<00:03:14.800> change<00:03:15.220> the

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
Clumber and that guy I just change the

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.460 
Clumber and that guy I just change the
pipe<00:03:15.489> of<00:03:15.670> cleaning<00:03:15.940> the<00:03:16.030> pipe<00:03:16.180> right<00:03:16.810> so<00:03:17.350> why

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
pipe of cleaning the pipe right so why

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.340 
pipe of cleaning the pipe right so why
because<00:03:17.800> these<00:03:18.360> we<00:03:19.360> gently<00:03:19.570> use<00:03:19.720> hot<00:03:19.930> water<00:03:20.080> we

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
because these we gently use hot water we

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.320 
because these we gently use hot water we
don't<00:03:20.500> use<00:03:20.650> very<00:03:20.860> soft<00:03:21.100> water<00:03:21.340> in<00:03:21.760> India<00:03:22.209> at

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.330 
don't use very soft water in India at

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.470 
don't use very soft water in India at
least<00:03:22.600> for<00:03:23.440> our<00:03:23.860> purpose<00:03:24.459> did<00:03:25.300> you<00:03:25.360> use

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
least for our purpose did you use

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.840 
least for our purpose did you use
purpose<00:03:25.870> so<00:03:26.050> this<00:03:26.440> this<00:03:26.739> has<00:03:26.950> like<00:03:27.250> all<00:03:27.430> cassia

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
purpose so this this has like all cassia

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:30.930 
purpose so this this has like all cassia
and<00:03:27.910> magnets<00:03:28.209> and<00:03:28.330> so<00:03:28.480> on<00:03:28.540> and<00:03:28.780> they<00:03:29.170> get<00:03:29.940> also

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
and magnets and so on and they get also

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:32.490 
and magnets and so on and they get also
in<00:03:31.000> the<00:03:31.060> pipes<00:03:31.270> for<00:03:31.420> you<00:03:31.630> we<00:03:31.750> must<00:03:31.870> open<00:03:32.290> the

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
in the pipes for you we must open the

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.070 
in the pipes for you we must open the

the<00:03:35.140> calcium<00:03:35.680> and<00:03:35.800> magnesium<00:03:36.510> sometimes<00:03:37.510> it

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
the calcium and magnesium sometimes it

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.910 
the calcium and magnesium sometimes it
is<00:03:37.690> so<00:03:37.870> much<00:03:38.080> that<00:03:38.410> it<00:03:38.770> chokes<00:03:39.130> the<00:03:39.220> violets

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
is so much that it chokes the violets

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.010 
is so much that it chokes the violets
correct<00:03:42.010> so<00:03:42.280> anyway<00:03:42.850> need<00:03:43.000> that<00:03:43.180> so<00:03:43.570> how<00:03:43.750> do<00:03:43.810> we

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:44.020 
correct so anyway need that so how do we

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:45.750 
correct so anyway need that so how do we
find<00:03:44.440> if<00:03:44.650> the<00:03:44.770> water<00:03:44.980> is<00:03:45.160> hard<00:03:45.459> to<00:03:45.580> solve

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760

either<00:03:52.390> which<00:03:52.930> you<00:03:53.050> get<00:03:53.170> in<00:03:53.290> this<00:03:53.350> water<00:03:53.920> is

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
either which you get in this water is

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.060 
either which you get in this water is
soft<00:03:54.520> you<00:03:55.060> will<00:03:55.180> get<00:03:55.420> lather<00:03:56.230> easily<00:03:56.739> with<00:03:56.890> so

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:57.070 
soft you will get lather easily with so

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.430 
soft you will get lather easily with so
it<00:03:57.670> we<00:03:57.880> have<00:03:58.000> the<00:03:58.090> soap<00:03:58.300> in<00:03:58.540> just<00:03:59.110> rub<00:03:59.410> your

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
it we have the soap in just rub your

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.400 
it we have the soap in just rub your
hand<00:03:59.769> it's<00:04:00.190> important<00:04:00.640> you'll<00:04:01.090> get<00:04:01.269> so<00:04:01.900> if<00:04:02.290> it

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:02.410 
hand it's important you'll get so if it

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:06.120 
hand it's important you'll get so if it
is<00:04:02.500> so<00:04:03.090> if<00:04:04.090> it<00:04:04.300> is<00:04:04.420> lather<00:04:04.660> but<00:04:05.440> less<00:04:05.620> so<00:04:05.830> if

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130 
is so if it is lather but less so if

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:07.949 
is so if it is lather but less so if
there<00:04:06.280> is<00:04:06.370> no<00:04:06.519> other<00:04:06.730> the<00:04:07.330> water<00:04:07.510> is<00:04:07.720> hard

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 
there is no other the water is hard

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:11.580 
there is no other the water is hard
right<00:04:08.500> so<00:04:09.250> we<00:04:09.820> will<00:04:10.060> have<00:04:10.270> talked<00:04:11.140> about<00:04:11.260> some

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
right so we will have talked about some

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.170 
right so we will have talked about some
of<00:04:11.650> the<00:04:11.740> methods<00:04:12.070> where<00:04:12.250> we<00:04:12.400> want<00:04:12.610> to

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
of the methods where we want to

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:14.759 
of the methods where we want to
remove<00:04:13.840> the<00:04:13.959> hardness<00:04:14.200> of<00:04:14.319> water<00:04:14.469> because

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:14.769 
remove the hardness of water because

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:17.759 
remove the hardness of water because
that<00:04:14.859> is<00:04:14.950> required<00:04:15.340> as<00:04:15.660> in<00:04:16.660> detachment<00:04:17.380> if<00:04:17.620> you

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769 
that is required as in detachment if you

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:19.560 
that is required as in detachment if you
are<00:04:17.829> using<00:04:18.039> hard<00:04:18.430> word<00:04:18.669> you're<00:04:19.120> wasting<00:04:19.479> out

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
are using hard word you're wasting out

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:23.219 
are using hard word you're wasting out
of<00:04:19.690> soap<00:04:19.900> because<00:04:20.560> even<00:04:21.250> with<00:04:21.400> language<00:04:22.229> okay

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:23.229 
of soap because even with language okay

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:25.320 
of soap because even with language okay
so<00:04:23.710> leather<00:04:24.280> is<00:04:24.430> required<00:04:24.759> to<00:04:24.880> clean<00:04:25.060> the<00:04:25.180> soap

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
so leather is required to clean the soap

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.080 
so leather is required to clean the soap
clean<00:04:25.660> the<00:04:26.130> tools<00:04:27.130> and<00:04:27.430> if<00:04:27.699> you<00:04:27.759> don't<00:04:27.940> good

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.090 
clean the tools and if you don't good

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:30.090 
clean the tools and if you don't good
lather<00:04:28.270> you<00:04:28.539> know<00:04:28.740> going<00:04:29.740> to<00:04:29.800> clean<00:04:29.979> the

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:30.100 
lather you know going to clean the

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.909 
lather you know going to clean the
clothes<00:04:30.310> so<00:04:30.789> it<00:04:31.240> is<00:04:31.389> necessary<00:04:31.990> to<00:04:32.500> remove<00:04:32.740> the

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:32.919 
clothes so it is necessary to remove the

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:34.140 
clothes so it is necessary to remove the
hands<00:04:33.130> of<00:04:33.310> the<00:04:33.370> water<00:04:33.550> so<00:04:33.729> we<00:04:33.759> talk<00:04:34.030> about

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150 
hands of the water so we talk about

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:35.730 
hands of the water so we talk about
those<00:04:34.449> things<00:04:34.509> later

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 
those things later

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:40.350 
those things later
just<00:04:36.130> now<00:04:36.250> understand<00:04:36.699> that<00:04:37.440> very<00:04:39.360> simple

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:40.360 
just now understand that very simple

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.960 
just now understand that very simple
test<00:04:40.660> to<00:04:40.840> find<00:04:41.050> if<00:04:41.410> water<00:04:41.740> is<00:04:41.919> hard<00:04:42.310> or<00:04:42.490> not<00:04:42.669> is

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:42.970 
test to find if water is hard or not is

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:45.260 
test to find if water is hard or not is
to<00:04:43.210> mix<00:04:43.780> in<00:04:43.990> the<00:04:44.020> sole<00:04:44.320> did<00:04:44.680> you<00:04:44.770> get<00:04:44.979> them

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
to mix in the sole did you get them

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.140 
to mix in the sole did you get them
Ladon<00:04:46.300> that<00:04:46.720> means<00:04:46.960> water<00:04:47.470> is<00:04:47.849> if<00:04:48.849> you<00:04:48.970> don't

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 
Ladon that means water is if you don't

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:53.460 
Ladon that means water is if you don't
get<00:04:49.300> rather<00:04:49.509> is<00:04:50.050> about<00:04:50.349> this<00:04:52.320> correct<00:04:53.320> and

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:53.470 
get rather is about this correct and

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:56.159 
get rather is about this correct and
also<00:04:54.280> the<00:04:54.910> water<00:04:55.120> that<00:04:55.270> is<00:04:55.389> free<00:04:55.599> from<00:04:55.720> calcium

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:56.169 
also the water that is free from calcium

00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:57.570 
also the water that is free from calcium
and<00:04:56.320> magnesium<00:04:56.410> is<00:04:56.830> called<00:04:57.190> soft<00:04:57.400> water

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580 
and magnesium is called soft water

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.820 
and magnesium is called soft water
because<00:04:57.940> there<00:04:58.060> is<00:04:58.120> no<00:04:58.270> good<00:04:59.259> ions<00:04:59.560> calcium

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830 
because there is no good ions calcium

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:02.550 
because there is no good ions calcium
magnesium<00:05:00.160> returns<00:05:00.669> water<00:05:01.090> is<00:05:01.270> soft<00:05:01.509> it<00:05:02.229> has

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560 
magnesium returns water is soft it has

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:09.749 
magnesium returns water is soft it has
it<00:05:03.310> is<00:05:03.460> hard<00:05:07.229> correct<00:05:08.259> that's<00:05:08.710> ready<00:05:08.889> see<00:05:09.099> soft

00:05:09.749 --> 00:05:09.759 
it is hard correct that's ready see soft

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:14.490 
it is hard correct that's ready see soft
water<00:05:10.060> easily<00:05:10.570> gives<00:05:11.160> logarithm<00:05:12.160> so<00:05:13.289> so<00:05:14.289> that

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:14.500 
water easily gives logarithm so so that

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:17.909 
water easily gives logarithm so so that
is<00:05:14.530> all<00:05:14.979> about<00:05:15.039> hard<00:05:15.610> and<00:05:15.729> soft<00:05:15.940> water<00:05:16.090> so<00:05:16.930> the

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:17.919 
is all about hard and soft water so the

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:20.909 
is all about hard and soft water so the
question<00:05:18.250> is<00:05:18.340> why<00:05:18.849> hard<00:05:19.570> waters<00:05:20.080> they<00:05:20.710> don't

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:20.919 
question is why hard waters they don't

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:26.790 
question is why hard waters they don't
form<00:05:23.220> ladder<00:05:24.220> with<00:05:24.610> so<00:05:24.849> why<00:05:25.270> hard<00:05:25.599> water<00:05:25.840> they

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:26.800 
form ladder with so why hard water they

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.980 
form ladder with so why hard water they
don't<00:05:26.949> form<00:05:27.400> lather<00:05:27.699> in<00:05:27.940> them<00:05:28.120> so<00:05:28.449> I<00:05:28.479> have<00:05:28.750> soap

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:28.990 
don't form lather in them so I have soap

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:32.430 
don't form lather in them so I have soap
I<00:05:29.139> have<00:05:29.349> water<00:05:29.979> if<00:05:30.520> I<00:05:30.669> have<00:05:30.820> hard<00:05:31.090> water<00:05:31.440> there

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:32.440 
I have water if I have hard water there

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:35.700 
I have water if I have hard water there
is<00:05:32.560> very<00:05:32.860> meaningless<00:05:33.430> why<00:05:34.360> because<00:05:35.169> the<00:05:35.470> hard

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:35.710 
is very meaningless why because the hard

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:39.300 
is very meaningless why because the hard
water<00:05:35.949> forms<00:05:36.490> scum<00:05:37.300> or<00:05:38.080> precipitate<00:05:39.070> with

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:39.310 
water forms scum or precipitate with

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:42.029 
water forms scum or precipitate with
this<00:05:39.460> room<00:05:39.669> when<00:05:40.630> you<00:05:40.720> have<00:05:40.900> hot<00:05:41.139> water<00:05:41.409> hot

00:05:42.029 --> 00:05:42.039 
this room when you have hot water hot

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:43.920 
this room when you have hot water hot
water<00:05:42.099> is<00:05:42.520> nothing<00:05:42.789> but<00:05:42.909> Chelsea<00:05:43.539> men

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:43.930 
water is nothing but Chelsea men

or manual so if i mix soap with this

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:00.570 
or manual so if i mix soap with this
hard<00:05:59.530> water<00:05:59.770> which<00:05:59.949> is<00:06:00.070> calcium<00:06:00.280> and
