00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.170

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:16.570
 My second game of the day I'm Manco 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.340

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.980
 They have killing vale 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:38.600

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:40.189
 me that when you do not play I'll love 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.229
 it's not going to be safe because maybe there's 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:45.860
 some machine a phenomenon that gets up 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:49.180
 and either a crack with the command but to the 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:53.060
 people measure there are people who practice 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:54.370

 this is my second game and as 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:17.660
