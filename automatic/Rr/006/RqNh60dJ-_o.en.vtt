00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:43.599 
seeing more of their the film stuff

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:45.270 
seeing more of their the film stuff
they're<00:02:43.780> coming<00:02:44.019> out<00:02:44.140> with<00:02:44.319> recently<00:02:44.620> more<00:02:45.190> of

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
they're coming out with recently more of

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.120 
they're coming out with recently more of
that<00:02:45.930> so<00:02:46.930> we'll<00:02:47.079> see<00:02:47.319> what<00:02:47.500> else<00:02:47.680> they<00:02:47.860> have<00:02:47.980> in

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
that so we'll see what else they have in

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:49.740 
that so we'll see what else they have in
store<00:02:48.370> for<00:02:48.400> us<00:02:48.610> but<00:02:48.910> they<00:02:49.000> have<00:02:49.120> so<00:02:49.329> much<00:02:49.480> money

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
store for us but they have so much money

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.470 
store for us but they have so much money
and<00:02:50.019> they<00:02:50.560> could<00:02:50.620> pour<00:02:50.950> so<00:02:51.760> much<00:02:51.790> of<00:02:52.150> it<00:02:52.269> into

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
and they could pour so much of it into

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.880 
and they could pour so much of it into
their<00:02:52.630> original<00:02:52.720> content<00:02:53.440> and<00:02:53.530> I<00:02:53.620> think<00:02:53.650> is

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
their original content and I think is

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.309 
their original content and I think is
such<00:02:54.040> a<00:02:54.069> smart<00:02:54.459> move<00:02:54.700> they're<00:02:55.510> still<00:02:55.810> not<00:02:56.019> on

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 
such a smart move they're still not on

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:58.559 
such a smart move they're still not on
the<00:02:56.349> same<00:02:56.650> level<00:02:56.709> as<00:02:57.220> HBO<00:02:57.730> they're<00:02:58.120> getting

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 
the same level as HBO they're getting

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:00.210 
the same level as HBO they're getting
close<00:02:59.019> though

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
close though

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.160 
close though
a<00:03:00.329> lot<00:03:01.329> of<00:03:01.510> the<00:03:01.599> stuff<00:03:01.870> that<00:03:01.900> they're

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
a lot of the stuff that they're

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.319 
a lot of the stuff that they're
releasing<00:03:02.500> on<00:03:02.829> there<00:03:03.099> is<00:03:03.220> really<00:03:03.430> really<00:03:03.940> high

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:04.329 
releasing on there is really really high

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:07.229 
releasing on there is really really high
quality<00:03:04.920> high<00:03:05.920> quality<00:03:06.400> TV<00:03:06.609> show<00:03:06.970> high

super<00:03:17.829> annoying<00:03:18.370> to<00:03:18.819> navigate<00:03:19.269> through<00:03:19.540> and

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900
