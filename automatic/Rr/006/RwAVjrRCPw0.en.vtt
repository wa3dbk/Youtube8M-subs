all right so let's get started here in
this<00:00:04.710> presentation<00:00:05.279> I'll<00:00:05.640> be<00:00:05.670> taking<00:00:06.150> you

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
this presentation I'll be taking you

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.030 
this presentation I'll be taking you
through<00:00:06.270> the<00:00:06.600> six<00:00:06.870> most<00:00:07.080> important<00:00:07.710> port

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
through the six most important port

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.730 
through the six most important port
important<00:00:08.670> parts<00:00:09.120> of<00:00:09.360> a<00:00:10.080> computer<00:00:10.590> and

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
important parts of a computer and

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.009 
important parts of a computer and
comparing<00:00:11.550> their<00:00:11.700> ways<00:00:11.940> of<00:00:12.210> operating<00:00:12.570> to<00:00:12.990> the

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.729 
power supply and video cards first we
have<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.430> hard<00:00:35.610> disk<00:00:35.880> drive<00:00:36.140> this<00:00:37.140> reads<00:00:37.469> and

have the hard disk drive this reads and

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.709 
have the hard disk drive this reads and
stores<00:00:37.980> all<00:00:38.250> of<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.550> data<00:00:38.820> on<00:00:38.940> your<00:00:39.239> computer

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
stores all of the data on your computer

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.680 
stores all of the data on your computer
so<00:00:40.379> for<00:00:40.980> example<00:00:41.430> when<00:00:41.610> you<00:00:41.820> write<00:00:42.149> a<00:00:42.329> document

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
so for example when you write a document

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.990 
so for example when you write a document
in<00:00:43.260> Word<00:00:43.500> and<00:00:43.800> then<00:00:43.920> save<00:00:44.309> it<00:00:44.460> with<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.789> name

drive reads paper number one and saves

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.580 
drive reads paper number one and saves
your<00:00:53.039> document<00:00:53.670> under<00:00:53.940> that<00:00:54.030> name

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:54.590 
your document under that name

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.959 
your document under that name
additionally<00:00:55.590> it<00:00:55.829> holds<00:00:56.250> applications

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
additionally it holds applications

we're<00:01:18.509> using<00:01:18.720> this<00:01:19.439> is<00:01:19.650> like<00:01:19.830> a<00:01:19.860> computer<00:01:20.369> in

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
we're using this is like a computer in

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.550 
we're using this is like a computer in
the<00:01:20.700> sense<00:01:20.939> that<00:01:21.030> everything<00:01:21.570> you<00:01:21.960> save<00:01:22.259> is

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
the sense that everything you save is

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.160 
the sense that everything you save is
put<00:01:22.890> into<00:01:23.040> categories<00:01:23.729> a<00:01:23.939> song<00:01:24.600> versus<00:01:25.140> a

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
put into categories a song versus a

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.800 
put into categories a song versus a
photo<00:01:25.530> versus<00:01:26.009> a<00:01:26.040> document<00:01:26.700> next<00:01:27.570> the

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
photo versus a document next the

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.660 
photo versus a document next the
computer<00:01:28.259> reads<00:01:28.500> what<00:01:28.740> you<00:01:28.860> save<00:01:29.100> it<00:01:29.250> as<00:01:29.400> if

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
computer reads what you save it as if

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.940 
computer reads what you save it as if
you<00:01:30.210> give<00:01:30.420> it<00:01:30.570> whatever<00:01:30.869> it<00:01:31.259> is<00:01:31.530> you're<00:01:31.710> saving

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
you give it whatever it is you're saving

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:39.789 
you give it whatever it is you're saving
a<00:01:32.189> title<00:01:32.610> and<00:01:32.840> the<00:01:33.840> exact<00:01:34.259> time<00:01:34.350> it's<00:01:34.740> saved<00:01:37.400> so

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:39.799 
a title and the exact time it's saved so

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:42.469 
a title and the exact time it's saved so
this<00:01:40.799> it<00:01:41.369> basically<00:01:41.520> just<00:01:41.880> stores<00:01:42.240> all<00:01:42.450> your

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
this it basically just stores all your

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.399 
this it basically just stores all your
data<00:01:43.520> next<00:01:44.520> we<00:01:44.670> have<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:45.119> central<00:01:45.840> processing

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
data next we have the central processing

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.789 
data next we have the central processing
unit<00:01:47.420> every<00:01:48.420> move<00:01:48.659> you<00:01:48.899> make<00:01:49.079> on<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.320> computer

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
unit every move you make on the computer

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.950 
unit every move you make on the computer
whether<00:01:50.070> it<00:01:50.250> be<00:01:50.369> clicking<00:01:50.820> a<00:01:50.939> mouse<00:01:50.970> or<00:01:51.390> typing

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
whether it be clicking a mouse or typing

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.300 
whether it be clicking a mouse or typing
first<00:01:53.000> typing<00:01:54.000> first<00:01:54.630> goes<00:01:54.899> through<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.350> CPU

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
first typing first goes through the CPU

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.999 
first typing first goes through the CPU
this<00:01:56.850> is<00:01:57.090> where<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.360> input<00:01:57.840> is<00:01:58.049> read<00:01:58.469> and<00:01:58.740> then

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
this is where the input is read and then

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.520 
this is where the input is read and then
where<00:01:59.219> the<00:01:59.369> operation<00:02:00.000> is<00:02:00.149> completed<00:02:00.810> I'd

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
where the operation is completed I'd

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.410 
where the operation is completed I'd
compare<00:02:02.040> this<00:02:02.189> function<00:02:02.640> to<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:02.880> decision

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
compare this function to the decision

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.210 
compare this function to the decision
making<00:02:03.659> aspect<00:02:04.350> of<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.890> brain<00:02:05.990> and<00:02:07.099> just<00:02:08.099> as

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
making aspect of the brain and just as

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.830 
making aspect of the brain and just as
an<00:02:08.340> example<00:02:08.459> maybe<00:02:09.030> if<00:02:09.239> you<00:02:09.360> were<00:02:09.479> playing

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
an example maybe if you were playing

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.790 
an example maybe if you were playing
basketball<00:02:11.030> if<00:02:12.030> a<00:02:12.690> ball<00:02:12.930> is<00:02:13.140> coming

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
basketball if a ball is coming

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.610 
basketball if a ball is coming
you<00:02:14.070> your<00:02:14.460> brain<00:02:14.700> registers<00:02:15.000> that<00:02:15.660> it<00:02:16.470> is

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
you your brain registers that it is

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.170 
you your brain registers that it is
coming<00:02:16.890> at<00:02:17.130> you<00:02:17.340> and<00:02:17.550> then<00:02:17.760> you<00:02:17.880> put<00:02:18.060> your

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
coming at you and then you put your

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.880 
coming at you and then you put your

reads the action that you just took and

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:41.840

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
but computer uses DC power so AC it

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:42.680

we have the video card

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.720 
we have the video card

everything you see on the screen is

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:57.330
