00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.200
 actor of the sun of oblivion the stroke nobody 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.420

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.700
 that had ruined his exam from the 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.860
 cabin with a gun that we never knew 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:18.000

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:20.119

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.119

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:26.980
 spent three years in jail 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.929

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.239

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.240
 Thank you 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:59.760
 the white horse was called to cry 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.760
 we never knew why 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:17.090
 with that 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:25.239
 let's get to the old one which one looks 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:25.239
 he says he does not follow 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:33.120
 that already happened has nothing will allow 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.330
 that's what he told me 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.379
 on the left side 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:49.550
 she is a dancer, not a doctor 

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:07.840
 your body is a hand 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:13.720
 I believe that it is very 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:18.810
 funny they are going to laugh a lot but that no 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:22.790
 it stays there and I think it's a story 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:24.680
 painful then 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:28.220
 what has to be told in this way 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:30.230
 and rodolfo obregÃ³n towards a comparison 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.570
 very nice saying is this work 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:34.610
 it was like the castor oil that was 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:36.530
 Give the children that you have to make them laugh 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:39.200
 so that when they are with their mouths 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:43.810
 open we can put the spoon 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:46.550
 marga not then I think that 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:50.420
 Precisely comedy is what 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:53.510
 disarm the viewer to talk to him about 

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:56.350
 issues that you do not want to hear not then 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:59.140
 in that sense is a is a comedy 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:01.730
 necessary is a necessary comedy 

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:06.520
 because it addresses issues that suddenly 

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:08.450
 we want to avoid and comedy turns us 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:10.190
 vulnerable I think that 's the beauty 

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:12.290
 of the comedy that makes us vulnerable 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:14.540
 and that does not stay in the joke maybe ja 

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:15.980
 ha ha I laughed a lot and I do not know what I think 

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:17.810
 which is a comedy where they go to 

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:20.330
 reflect on themselves 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:23.660
 but in a bearable way they are not going to 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:26.330
 come to suffer will not come to the end 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:28.370
 I think they are going to laugh a lot 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:29.660
 ha ha ha ha ha ha if we left the theater 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:32.090
 I believe when they arrive at home not like that 

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:35.180
 What the fuck are we, is not to say, but 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:39.220
 it's late to fall but they're going to say that 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:39.220
 we are fucking but we can be fine 

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:43.870
 two 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:49.210
 but not anymore 

00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:00.040
 but banking 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:18.530
 at this point for you 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.640
 sweet it's 3 o'clock in the morning 

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:25.640
 leave
