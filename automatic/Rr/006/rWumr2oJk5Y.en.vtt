00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
there is a little bit of a play you know

there is a little bit of a play you know
if<00:02:28.740> you<00:02:29.010> watch<00:02:29.580> me<00:02:29.760> if<00:02:29.850> you<00:02:29.910> can<00:02:30.030> actually<00:02:30.180> hear

if you watch me if you can actually hear

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.020 
if you watch me if you can actually hear
that<00:02:30.860> but<00:02:31.860> there's<00:02:32.040> a<00:02:32.160> little<00:02:32.460> bit<00:02:32.610> of<00:02:32.640> a<00:02:32.790> play

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
that but there's a little bit of a play

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.490 
that but there's a little bit of a play
on<00:02:33.210> the<00:02:33.330> handle<00:02:33.660> and<00:02:33.750> that's<00:02:33.960> obviously<00:02:34.380> just

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
on the handle and that's obviously just

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.470 
on the handle and that's obviously just
because<00:02:34.830> of<00:02:35.040> this<00:02:35.340> of<00:02:35.730> this<00:02:35.940> tool<00:02:36.180> you<00:02:36.360> know

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
because of this of this tool you know

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.090 
because of this of this tool you know
they<00:02:36.660> had<00:02:36.810> to<00:02:36.840> I'm<00:02:37.260> not<00:02:37.410> quite<00:02:37.620> sure<00:02:37.650> how<00:02:37.920> they

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
they had to I'm not quite sure how they

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.160 
they had to I'm not quite sure how they
did<00:02:38.310> it<00:02:38.430> but<00:02:38.610> that's<00:02:39.150> one<00:02:39.390> concern<00:02:39.870> that<00:02:39.930> I

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
did it but that's one concern that I

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.580 
did it but that's one concern that I
have

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
have

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.290 
have
the<00:02:41.040> other<00:02:41.220> concern<00:02:41.550> obviously<00:02:41.760> is<00:02:42.060> the

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
the other concern obviously is the

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.630 
the other concern obviously is the
serrations<00:02:42.660> now<00:02:43.290> in<00:02:43.650> a<00:02:43.740> survival<00:02:44.160> you<00:02:44.460> know<00:02:44.550> if

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
serrations now in a survival you know if

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.100 
serrations now in a survival you know if
you're<00:02:44.760> gonna<00:02:44.910> maybe<00:02:45.090> baton<00:02:45.540> would<00:02:45.780> with<00:02:45.960> us

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
you're gonna maybe baton would with us

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.860 
you're gonna maybe baton would with us
this<00:02:46.470> these<00:02:47.250> serrations<00:02:47.610> will<00:02:48.120> eat<00:02:48.360> eat<00:02:48.630> your

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
this these serrations will eat eat your

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.020 
this these serrations will eat eat your
baton<00:02:49.230> again<00:02:49.830> that's<00:02:50.190> maybe<00:02:50.370> not<00:02:50.520> a<00:02:50.700> train

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
baton again that's maybe not a train

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.590 
baton again that's maybe not a train
smash<00:02:51.420> I<00:02:52.280> do<00:02:53.280> like<00:02:53.520> the<00:02:53.700> finger<00:02:54.030> twelve<00:02:54.300> and

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
smash I do like the finger twelve and

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.300 
smash I do like the finger twelve and
I've<00:02:54.720> got<00:02:54.930> a<00:02:54.959> very<00:02:55.170> nice<00:02:55.350> finger<00:02:55.770> choil<00:02:55.980> over

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
I've got a very nice finger choil over

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.780 
I've got a very nice finger choil over
there<00:02:56.550> and<00:02:56.900> again<00:02:57.900> this<00:02:58.200> flat<00:02:59.010> piece<00:02:59.370> over

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
there and again this flat piece over

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.540 
there and again this flat piece over
there<00:03:00.240> that<00:03:01.230> that<00:03:01.500> really<00:03:01.830> enough<00:03:02.160> you<00:03:02.280> choke

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
there that that really enough you choke

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.000 
there that that really enough you choke
up<00:03:02.760> on<00:03:02.940> the<00:03:03.030> blade<00:03:03.240> you<00:03:04.140> really<00:03:04.500> have<00:03:04.709> very

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
up on the blade you really have very

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.660 
up on the blade you really have very
nice<00:03:05.730> comfortable<00:03:06.060> purchase<00:03:06.840> in<00:03:07.709> my<00:03:08.010> opinion

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
nice comfortable purchase in my opinion

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.420 
nice comfortable purchase in my opinion
I<00:03:08.790> think<00:03:09.180> that<00:03:09.630> the<00:03:10.560> blade<00:03:10.800> could<00:03:11.130> have<00:03:11.220> been

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
I think that the blade could have been

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.640 
I think that the blade could have been
maybe<00:03:11.670> slightly<00:03:12.150> thicker<00:03:12.600> they<00:03:13.350> could<00:03:13.560> have

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
maybe slightly thicker they could have

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.390 
maybe slightly thicker they could have
maybe<00:03:13.830> done<00:03:13.980> away<00:03:14.459> with<00:03:14.490> the<00:03:14.970> serrations<00:03:15.360> and

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
maybe done away with the serrations and

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.100 
maybe done away with the serrations and
again<00:03:17.400> you<00:03:17.580> know<00:03:17.700> when<00:03:17.820> it<00:03:17.940> comes<00:03:18.150> to<00:03:18.330> knives<00:03:18.660> I

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
again you know when it comes to knives I

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.920 
again you know when it comes to knives I
like<00:03:19.620> a<00:03:19.650> heavy<00:03:20.160> heavy<00:03:20.850> knife<00:03:21.209> you<00:03:21.480> know<00:03:21.630> again

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
like a heavy heavy knife you know again

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.040

my sharpening equipment despite the fact

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:00.850 
my sharpening equipment despite the fact

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:00.860 
that it's actually a very light blade

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:05.810 
that it's actually a very light blade
very<00:06:01.860> lightweight<00:06:02.190> but<00:06:04.040> it<00:06:05.040> actually<00:06:05.220> chops

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:05.820 
very lightweight but it actually chops

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:08.270 
very lightweight but it actually chops
it's<00:06:06.540> not<00:06:06.780> bad<00:06:07.050> it's<00:06:07.320> really<00:06:07.500> not<00:06:07.800> bad<00:06:08.010> for

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:08.280 
it's not bad it's really not bad for

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:14.050 
it's not bad it's really not bad for
what<00:06:08.460> it<00:06:08.580> is<00:06:08.700> I'm<00:06:08.940> I'm<00:06:09.210> actually<00:06:09.390> surprised<00:06:12.860> in

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:14.060 
what it is I'm I'm actually surprised in

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:32.510 
what it is I'm I'm actually surprised in
stripping<00:06:15.060> off<00:06:15.180> bark<00:06:15.770> very<00:06:16.770> nice<00:06:18.200> listening

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:32.520 

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.260

obviously you know if you want to do

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:36.029 
obviously you know if you want to do
that<00:06:34.479> obviously<00:06:34.659> it<00:06:35.080> would<00:06:35.229> be<00:06:35.259> advisable<00:06:35.889> to

00:06:36.029 --> 00:06:36.039 
that obviously it would be advisable to

00:06:36.039 --> 00:06:37.709 
that obviously it would be advisable to
you<00:06:36.279> know<00:06:36.520> maybe<00:06:36.729> just<00:06:37.029> tag<00:06:37.270> you<00:06:37.419> know<00:06:37.449> wear

00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:46.149 
really I think for the next two maybe

00:06:46.149 --> 00:06:47.909 
really I think for the next two maybe
three<00:06:46.479> months<00:06:46.629> I'm<00:06:46.899> gonna<00:06:47.050> really<00:06:47.409> use<00:06:47.709> this

00:06:47.909 --> 00:06:47.919 
three months I'm gonna really use this

00:06:47.919 --> 00:06:50.639 
three months I'm gonna really use this
knife<00:06:48.479> I'm<00:06:49.479> gonna<00:06:49.659> do<00:06:49.809> some<00:06:50.020> but<00:06:50.139> donning<00:06:50.469> like

00:06:50.639 --> 00:06:50.649 
knife I'm gonna do some but donning like

00:06:50.649 --> 00:06:54.449 
knife I'm gonna do some but donning like
I<00:06:50.770> said<00:06:50.949> I<00:06:51.129> think<00:06:51.659> the<00:06:52.659> handle<00:06:53.319> is<00:06:53.529> the<00:06:54.009> weakest

00:06:54.449 --> 00:06:54.459 
I said I think the handle is the weakest

00:06:54.459 --> 00:06:58.799 
I said I think the handle is the weakest
point<00:06:54.759> and<00:06:55.059> that<00:06:55.569> is<00:06:55.749> I<00:06:56.519> think<00:06:57.519> in<00:06:58.179> my<00:06:58.419> opinion

00:06:58.799 --> 00:06:58.809 
point and that is I think in my opinion

00:06:58.809 --> 00:07:00.929 
point and that is I think in my opinion
that's<00:06:58.959> because<00:06:59.319> of<00:06:59.499> the<00:06:59.740> of<00:07:00.369> this<00:07:00.639> little

00:07:00.929 --> 00:07:00.939 
that's because of the of this little

00:07:00.939 --> 00:07:02.189 
that's because of the of this little
tool<00:07:01.179> that<00:07:01.389> they<00:07:01.509> actually<00:07:01.689> integrated

00:07:02.189 --> 00:07:02.199 
tool that they actually integrated

00:07:02.199 --> 00:07:05.579 
tool that they actually integrated
within<00:07:02.860> the<00:07:03.039> handle<00:07:03.839> again<00:07:04.839> you<00:07:05.139> know<00:07:05.199> in<00:07:05.319> a

00:07:05.579 --> 00:07:05.589 
within the handle again you know in a

00:07:05.589 --> 00:07:07.649 
within the handle again you know in a
survival<00:07:06.159> type<00:07:06.369> situation<00:07:07.119> I'm<00:07:07.269> not<00:07:07.300> sure

00:07:07.649 --> 00:07:07.659 
survival type situation I'm not sure

00:07:07.659 --> 00:07:10.109 
survival type situation I'm not sure
what<00:07:07.929> this<00:07:08.169> would<00:07:08.499> would<00:07:09.369> serve<00:07:09.610> as<00:07:09.759> you<00:07:09.999> know

00:07:10.109 --> 00:07:10.119 
what this would would serve as you know

00:07:10.119 --> 00:07:12.809 
what this would would serve as you know
again<00:07:10.860> maybe<00:07:11.860> they<00:07:12.039> got<00:07:12.219> took<00:07:12.429> away<00:07:12.610> anything

00:07:12.809 --> 00:07:12.819 
again maybe they got took away anything

00:07:12.819 --> 00:07:17.189 
again maybe they got took away anything
but<00:07:13.349> in<00:07:14.349> my<00:07:14.529> opinion<00:07:14.619> I<00:07:15.279> wouldn't<00:07:16.199> really

00:07:17.189 --> 00:07:17.199 
but in my opinion I wouldn't really

00:07:17.199 --> 00:07:20.189 
but in my opinion I wouldn't really
bother<00:07:18.129> with<00:07:18.309> it<00:07:18.490> again<00:07:19.059> it<00:07:19.240> can<00:07:19.449> be<00:07:19.479> taken<00:07:20.080> out

00:07:20.189 --> 00:07:20.199 
bother with it again it can be taken out

00:07:20.199 --> 00:07:23.189 
bother with it again it can be taken out
you<00:07:20.379> can<00:07:21.089> take<00:07:22.089> that<00:07:22.330> out<00:07:22.479> and<00:07:22.509> then<00:07:22.869> you<00:07:23.050> can

00:07:23.189 --> 00:07:23.199 
you can take that out and then you can

00:07:23.199 --> 00:07:26.040 
you can take that out and then you can
actually<00:07:23.610> pull<00:07:24.610> the<00:07:24.759> back<00:07:24.999> piece<00:07:25.300> and<00:07:25.659> the

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:26.050 
actually pull the back piece and the

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:27.959 
actually pull the back piece and the
back<00:07:26.259> piece<00:07:26.469> actually<00:07:26.740> comes<00:07:27.009> out<00:07:27.519> and<00:07:27.789> then

00:07:27.959 --> 00:07:27.969 
back piece actually comes out and then

00:07:27.969 --> 00:07:30.269 
back piece actually comes out and then
obviously<00:07:28.209> it<00:07:28.719> is<00:07:28.930> it's<00:07:29.649> hollow<00:07:29.889> and<00:07:30.129> you've

00:07:30.269 --> 00:07:30.279 
obviously it is it's hollow and you've

00:07:30.279 --> 00:07:33.600 
obviously it is it's hollow and you've
got<00:07:30.519> you've<00:07:30.999> got<00:07:31.029> now<00:07:31.449> rattles<00:07:32.459> but<00:07:33.459> you're

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:33.610 
got you've got now rattles but you're

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:35.489 
got you've got now rattles but you're
very<00:07:33.969> very<00:07:34.209> lightweight<00:07:34.539> I<00:07:34.809> think<00:07:35.199> at<00:07:35.349> the

00:07:35.489 --> 00:07:35.499 
very very lightweight I think at the

00:07:35.499 --> 00:07:39.089 
very very lightweight I think at the
moment<00:07:35.800> I'm<00:07:36.789> going<00:07:37.059> to<00:07:37.149> go<00:07:37.449> with<00:07:37.719> this<00:07:38.680> could

00:07:39.089 --> 00:07:39.099 
moment I'm going to go with this could

00:07:39.099 --> 00:07:41.540 
moment I'm going to go with this could
be<00:07:39.339> a<00:07:39.550> secondary<00:07:40.269> knife<00:07:40.569> I<00:07:40.779> think<00:07:40.990> this<00:07:41.169> knife

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:41.550 
be a secondary knife I think this knife

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:44.219 
be a secondary knife I think this knife
would<00:07:42.550> be<00:07:42.579> up<00:07:43.089> with<00:07:43.329> this<00:07:43.479> knife<00:07:43.689> maybe<00:07:43.959> in<00:07:44.139> a

00:07:44.219 --> 00:07:44.229 
would be up with this knife maybe in a

00:07:44.229 --> 00:07:47.850 
would be up with this knife maybe in a
backpack<00:07:44.439> or<00:07:44.680> in<00:07:44.979> the<00:07:45.099> trunk<00:07:45.309> of<00:07:45.490> my<00:07:45.639> car<00:07:46.860> it's

00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:47.860 
backpack or in the trunk of my car it's

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:49.589 
backpack or in the trunk of my car it's
definitely<00:07:48.369> going<00:07:48.579> to<00:07:48.669> cut<00:07:49.029> but<00:07:49.180> I<00:07:49.240> think<00:07:49.479> as<00:07:49.569> a

00:07:49.589 --> 00:07:49.599 
definitely going to cut but I think as a

00:07:49.599 --> 00:07:52.290 
definitely going to cut but I think as a
primary<00:07:50.289> knife<00:07:50.619> I'm<00:07:51.009> not<00:07:51.339> too<00:07:51.579> keen<00:07:51.879> again<00:07:52.209> I
