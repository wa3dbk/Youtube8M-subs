00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.910
 this is philipp jagersbacher from vienna 12 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.990
 years old when he is his 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:10.340
 favorite employment after then goes 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.340
 it looks like this 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:27.420
 dance group is called the art 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:30.060
 sport the young man a class for 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.710
 it is daring that crashes 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.690
 with a particularly strong 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.530
 scooter of different ramps 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.730
 and produced art pieces on an assembly line 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:41.250
 Editor Michael Fally wanted it again 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:45.110
 know exactly and committed philipp 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.110
 for his personal private lessons 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:54.000
 I would suggest place like place 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.130
 long do you operate these because 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.400
 Sport nations you look at it at all 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:02.610
 caught on 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:05.009
 Almost two years and a friend has me 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:09.720
 times shown how often do you get up 

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:12.060
 this thing how much you fruit almost everyone 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.950
 day actually so that you have come from 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.660
 the school home school bag in the 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.530
 corner 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.640
 I'll go right after the 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.720
 So I have to go to school now 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.130
 came straight to school 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.570
 The home exercises will be the next day 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.619
 then written off so if I'm fine 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.840
 had fallen 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.360
 so when I'm at home I was 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.679
 right now we have to finish everything yes 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.509
 also come to ears that you do not 

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:34.950
 quite unsuccessful in this sport 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.850
 Are you already everywhere? 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.649
 took part 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.509
 I already have three competitions 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:45.119
 took part 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:47.580
 follow when the fourth was a second 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:53.640
 I did not get it until I got there 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:55.259
 and at the third of the 2 there I was 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.240
 second I think then rod 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.039
 get the tricks you have everything 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.200
 self-taught and how do you get on 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:02.490
 the whole thing now everything 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.590
 taught so watched videos 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.149
 imitated 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.920
 well then I ask you now that you 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.509
 something to teach at once to 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.009
 I am quite emotional and 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.080
 so talented again 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:16.630
 challenge for you ready for 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.880
 these trainings session came to it 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:22.240
 first warm up exercise for our editor 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:24.690
 get to the devices and go straight 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.690
 drive 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:35.600
 good but i am under control of the thing 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:37.880
 we can start if indeed fall 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.680
 because not overestimated because already 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.360
 try the scooter in the air too 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.569
 Maneuvering visibly prepares him 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:47.020
 problems and difficult tricks all the way 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:47.020
 not to mention 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.550
 No 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:06.010
 Helmets are more in this sport 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:08.210
 less or overvalued know 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.440
 I do not say so on the helmet because I 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:11.720
 just did not progress 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.370
 it is of course that there is a 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.750
 So here's an argument 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.500
 Security experts take this 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.900
 heart to heart 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.700
 You can really have been with bright light 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:28.850
 skilfully out of our editor but 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:30.560
 even without a helmet not half 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:32.990
 hour, philipp redeems ours 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.850
 sorry editor especially 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:40.940
 impressed, the master of 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:43.540
 his protege but not quite 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:45.980
 satisfied but i do not believe a word 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.050
 not insane and author i realized 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:49.430
 how many injuries do you have? 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:51.880
 actually already suffered at 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.880
 your goods 

00:03:55.210 --> 00:04:01.040
 biggs was retracted 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:01.810
 but I also have the fingers 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:08.270
 Broken 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:10.730
 a few months ago so often that nothing 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:13.040
 bad hopefully it stays that way 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:15.140
 that is a great pity for the young man 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.920
 no longer exercise his hobbies 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.920
 to be able to admire
