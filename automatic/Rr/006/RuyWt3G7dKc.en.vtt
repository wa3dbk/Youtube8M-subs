00:00:18.169 --> 00:00:23.069
 welcome to water scaling lab 

00:00:20.399 --> 00:00:24.659
 in this video tutorial we will talk about the 

00:00:23.069 --> 00:00:27.539
 aquarium maintenance in 

00:00:24.659 --> 00:00:29.609
 detail of the cleaning of the tank e 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.279
 filter cleaning 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.489
 before we talk about the police we must 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.769
 make a succinct nitrogen reasoning 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:43.019
 which basically comes from the fact that 

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:45.079
 the aquarium is a bio powered system 

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:48.300
 precisely from an internal or external filter 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:50.399
 that makes the water turn like everyone 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:54.260
 we know our aquarium is mine 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:57.570
 system composed of living beings that 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:00.480
 for their vital functions they produce 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.059
 ammonium this ammonium resulted 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.360
 precisely from the faeces with fallen leaves 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:09.649
 or from the overdose of food or 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:13.409
 however of what is not eaten 

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:17.369
 however, this ammonium is transformed by 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:20.430
 of the bacteria that will form or 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:23.210
 bottom or in the filter that are called 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.890
 these bacteria terrifying baptisms 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:28.619
 transform ammonium into the wounded who 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.259
 they are very harmful but also treaty damages 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.990
 crati years that are me much less 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:36.780
 harmful to eliminate therefore from yours 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.490
 aquarium both dirt and nitrites 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.409
 nitrates 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:44.969
 we must do certain actions that 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:48.450
 the first are the most mechanical ones with 

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:53.640
 the use of razor blades or 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:56.340
 bruschini we will go to remove just from 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:00.329
 glasses all those algae that yes 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.530
 could form then we will go precisely to 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.590
 to take 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.960
 the pieces of the fitting and we will go to 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:11.039
 wash the faucet precisely or 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.970
 even with toothbrushes then the 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.600
 second action 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:18.930
 this is very important through 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:21.750
 just a siphon that will help you to ad 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.200
 vacuum the water and clean the sand 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.370
 practically the siphon will be positioned 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.980
 on the bottom 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.569
 will pull up some sand but will not do it 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.970
 going away will arrive more or less up to 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:35.450
 this level will clean and will 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.950
 deposit again on the bottom 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.830
 allowing vinous to be eliminated 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:43.110
 the droppings that you usually go to 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.870
 place in this part 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:49.260
 you need another aquarium action 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.489
 doing is surely that of cleaning 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.540
 of the filter 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:56.340
 now we're going to see it in particular 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.580
 let's see what a. is composed of 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.989
 filter and how to clean it 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.180
 generally the filters are divided into 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:06.900
 two categories external filters and felts 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.640
 interiors today we will see an exterior but the 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.590
 interior features are very 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.140
 similar 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:16.320
 the internal division is composed of 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.630
 various elements or compartments and are i 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.370
 following 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:22.829
 the first part that will meet the flow 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:26.610
 water is the sponges that 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:31.260
 they will mechanically hold all the 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:34.380
 more solid and precisely parts will avoid 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:38.340
 put the droppings back in the water e 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:40.739
 plant residues and stuff 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:43.440
 the second part is made up of 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:46.380
 razor clams now let's talk about cannes 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:50.940
 ears the razor clams are stones 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:54.060
 porous or ceramic in fact can 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:56.850
 be replaced or otherwise added 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.819
 also with lava stones and have the 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:02.629
 capacity of 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:04.430
 to make bacteria bacteria bore i 

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:05.659
 so-called nor terrifying those referred to 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.629
 we talked first 

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:12.099
 generally the nitro is the man nas e 

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:16.479
 nitro bacterias that transform monio 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:21.709
 years wounded and then crushed nitrate damage 

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:24.680
 to facilitate performance we should 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:28.849
 go and add precisely these 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:31.490
 bacteria from the outside sell appropriate 

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:34.340
 products that you can buy in the municipality 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:38.030
 stores and will therefore consider maintaining 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:41.560
 the aquarium is clean and clear the last 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:46.490
 compartment is instead composed of 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:48.860
 generally rock wool which we say 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:51.199
 a very fine filter that will guarantee you 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:54.199
 precisely not to let the particles pass 

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:57.650
 smaller and if we want above all 

00:04:54.199 --> 00:05:00.830
 to remove medicinal residues or 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:02.930
 however odors we can admit of 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:05.139
 activated carbon that will hold all the 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:05.139
 impurity 

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:15.949
 this is the engine of his filter 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:22.310
 turning his post we're going to wash 

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:25.759
 all this and close the mafia and the 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:30.090
 sponges and put back in their frame ne 

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:33.510
 we're going to insert in the filter 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:36.500
 after inserting the sponges we will go to 

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:39.000
 put the bacteria bought shop 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:41.400
 directly nor razor clams us 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:47.220
 we advise you to put them here 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:50.850
 in the water in the razor clams aquarium e 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:55.830
 can be replaced by stones 

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:57.930
 last lava or in any case porous 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:03.949
 compartment of filtration 

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:03.949
 of fine particles and the eventual 

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:11.450
 cancellation of odors or medicines with 

00:06:07.229 --> 00:06:11.450
 coal does not need to position 

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:16.729
 we close everything 

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:24.680
 let's go and position it inside we close 

00:06:22.229 --> 00:06:24.680
 the whole 

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:36.699
 we do not enter water is ready for 

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:37.630
 be functioning to conclude us of 

00:06:36.699 --> 00:06:41.259
 water skating lab 

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:44.080
 we recommend this cleaning method 

00:06:41.259 --> 00:06:46.229
 to guarantee an absence of 

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:49.750
 algae and an absence of nitrate nitrites 

00:06:46.229 --> 00:06:52.360
 then we'll go once a month 

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:55.870
 a partial water change with 

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:59.110
 the help of the siphon you have to raise more 

00:06:55.870 --> 00:07:03.789
 or less at 20 30 percent a month 

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:06.180
 followed by a filter cleaning instead 

00:07:03.789 --> 00:07:09.430
 with the addition of bacteria 

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:11.139
 in total therefore it will be once a month 

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:14.250
 the water change 

00:07:11.139 --> 00:07:16.930
 once a month the filter change 

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:19.479
 after each partial water change vi 

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:22.900
 we recommend entering the bio 

00:07:19.479 --> 00:07:25.870
 conditioner that serves to cancel 

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:26.699
 the effect of heavy metals and 

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:29.199
 chlorine 

00:07:26.699 --> 00:07:31.949
 We thank you for being on 

00:07:29.199 --> 00:07:34.780
 any fan club for any questions 

00:07:31.949 --> 00:07:37.930
