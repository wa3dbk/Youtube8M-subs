00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.130
 hello and welcome to 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.860
 We considered ourselves to another 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:26.390
 battlefield 4 commentary and though it does 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:28.369
 just with the cb jms and the shorty 12g 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.419
 my ghetto class as i think im 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:32.809
 battlefield 4 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:34.730
 I looked mean the cbm it looks 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:36.500
 pretty much slimmed down like a 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.600
 cordless drill or how do we find one 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.219
 real banger is so the uc of 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.500
 Battlefield 4 I would say and 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:45.859
 I'm slow on that here 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:49.070
 played team deathmatch and here are 

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:51.440
 we almost there already in the melee before 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.969
 I read the values ​​for a short time 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.309
 the weapon in the battlelog can yes 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:58.640
 Read it yourself 30 damage precision 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:01.579
 also 30 helps 75 reach 15 and 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.620
 Tell 700 already equal to the range 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:05.630
 The weapon is relatively limited and also 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.820
 The precision is relatively poor 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.510
 but celebrate a very high rider 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:13.040
 namely 700 that is very good 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:13.790
 and so you can already quite a lot on 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.620
 Beginning 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.060
 the damage is very neat 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.490
 on the right the weapon did not win that 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.500
 which was still to see was for me 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.970
 on french talks 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.790
 or you will now 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.470
 see when I am here and that they are 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:31.160
 also pretty accurate on the rain 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:35.030
 stand is but in close combat cani zms 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:37.850
 really clean and yes to the chain class 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.440
 belongs to you a horny second weapon and 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:43.400
 I have them here is the shorty 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.030
 12 212 g can be used as a pistol 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.270
 unlock 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:51.020
 the one-time shotgun with a damage 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:53.060
 of 60 precision 20 460 range 10 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.680
 will be a very short range though 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.750
 a very high one gets hurt you 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.330
 people even with a shot dead 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.460
 but you usually need two 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:04.010
 Shot recession is here again 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.570
 not so in close combat she was 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:08.060
 really very good that means in total 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.519
 is the class or the ghetto class im 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:14.060
 battlefield 4 with the cvjm es and the 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:15.830
 scot 12g for the melee and this one 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.290
 come on very well we will too 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.150
 after that see that the short 12 is the very one 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.950
 very well 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:25.550
 you in the house fight is here completely 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:28.040
 just very stupid but who now 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:30.440
 immediately see that the places 12 g there 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.350
 can be really good so in close combat 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.150
 you can make this set very much this setup 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:37.040
 I like to use it very well 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.230
 in between times to the sow 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.720
 let out on rangers of course the 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.880
 You can really weaken little travel 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.610
 no good range weapons with the cvjm it 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.560
 but a very green gun and weapon 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.660
 With burst celebration one can also on with 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.160
 if a little something tear 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.230
 However, one is against sometime 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.710
 storm rifles or lmg is already pretty 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.760
 inferior 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:00.890
 each one of the pretty good ethical 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.330
 borderline we have value on the 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:08.270
 see that the chance of a certain 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:11.170
 Range has is because you have the one here 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:13.640
 humor with two shots away really well 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.710
 I like the 12 today 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.390
 I like it a lot as a gun 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:18.440
 very well 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:22.220
 Here is then on scouting whole 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:24.200
 targeted thus counts directly to the slopes 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.850
 but is a pistol before and let 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:29.780
 another five unlocks 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:32.150
 But then you count in the end 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.490
 shotgun points and those are called 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.710
 I can not find any scenes 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:38.210
 bad and I sometimes on some apps 

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:40.310
 you can use the already twelve as well 

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:41.780
 in the team deathmatch can appear with 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:44.390
 you yes I use and congress where I 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.310
 another person recommends it here 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:48.680
 in the team deathmatch if you have the 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.290
 cable one i mean up the smbs 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.820
 wanted a few city by the way 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:55.370
 want to run up then the ghetto 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:59.030
 class in battlefield 4 is called amazon 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:02.660
 tory 12 a very good choice with the 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:05.090
 eu summit travel can be your opponents in the 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:06.830
 can perforate melee properly yes 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.330
 I thought it was all round 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:09.650
 Neat, I 've already done better 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:11.660
 I did not have that 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:15.560
 recorded or was there in the background 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:17.450
 always ts to hear in the video and 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.700
 which is then not so great when the 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:20.989
 essener group is therefore now 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.639
 taken there is no now 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:25.310
 in the background just agree with my now 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:27.470
 is and can between schänkel 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:29.660
 but somehow I have to 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.440
 It shows the means await the class 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:32.000
 but pretty good 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.100
 and yes I will probably more often 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.750
 make setup with me because something stands out 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.400
 which fits together well 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:40.669
 play together and I find the show 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:42.940
 give her twelve and the cjm fits it 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:45.290
 very good together some top class 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:47.900
 straight from the ghetto on the 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:50.810
 battlefield with it and then all opponents 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:53.030
 in the melee look yes that's the motto 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:57.650
 the class but the world see it too 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:58.700
 which is the biggest and probably a very 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:01.610
 strong weaknesses 

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:04.490
 class here should setup it is namely 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:06.310
 The range fight because you just have zero 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:09.710
 chances against other opponents 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:11.300
 the cvjm it on her a little bit 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:13.580
 unbelievably little damage does one 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:16.540
 high rieker then also has and the 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:19.190
 accuracy suffers a lot from it 

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:22.570
 So not exactly the ideal start 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:26.330
 Therefore , please only on tdm 

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:29.870
 dominance or defusing 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:33.530
 So this is this power mode 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:34.970
 Somehow similar in the big congress 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:36.680
 i would like you to be an engineer or still 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:39.830
 but you do not want to collapse 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:43.550
 can you also use a smg what 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:46.550
 one person the fans yes i have 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:48.169
 both in a soft spray well 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:51.740
 played that I think has fit well 

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:54.260
 together and I now I have 12 g 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:57.110
 with the lamp on and still with 

00:05:54.260 --> 00:06:01.340
 a dachshund or whatever is and 

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:04.190
 the cvjm it plays in the red dot with the 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:07.310
 laser pointer and i think i have 

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:09.050
 here still bake mass braker so on it 

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:11.750
 because I think it does not bring it that way 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:15.740
 waiting for these preventive surfing 

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:17.180
 I prefer on whose silencer I 

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:18.650
 think it's better a bit 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:20.240
 Star will go ahead 

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:22.729
 thomas brix and so what do I have 

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.810
 actually relatively rare - before fumes 

00:06:22.729 --> 00:06:25.070
 I could be so beautiful 

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:26.600
 but I have at the time of 

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:29.000
 videos just not unlocked 

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:31.370
 yes I think the weapon has very good 

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.900
 By the way, 50 shots is always very very 

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:36.410
 good is that does not mean neat 

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:37.850
 so often after load at the cvjm es and 

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:42.199
 can you as a horse that much time 

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:44.440
 let and relatively many opponents also with 

00:06:42.199 --> 00:06:47.030
 the school is allowed to get a magazin mac 

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:47.960
 because of the rule a pretty limited 

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:51.229
 make that 

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:55.010
 three balls that's a little bit 

00:06:51.229 --> 00:06:56.539
 but nevertheless she has one 

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:58.580
 high damage and she is for it 

00:06:56.539 --> 00:07:01.100
 then designed as a finisher weapon so 

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:03.860
 dead the opponents something bzm it would find 

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:06.080
 the mill is or you just change 

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:07.760
 well to the weapon then we can have one more 

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:09.020
 miss and then yes, as a rule 

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:11.449
 also very fast 

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:14.740
 now you see the disadvantage of the 

00:07:11.449 --> 00:07:18.919
 Weapon is yes I burst fire already here 

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:21.289
 and yes, almost no 

00:07:18.919 --> 00:07:23.510
 shot I'll load again 

00:07:21.289 --> 00:07:26.270
 I'll see the tvm it is relatively 

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:30.470
 many balls yes here again 

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:32.510
 you will meet two shots of half 

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:34.520
 magazine no good yield 

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:37.099
 I would say underline that 

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:40.970
 ghetto kid of battlefield 4 was ms 

00:07:37.099 --> 00:07:43.520
 and sony 12g a melee this does everything 

00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:44.720
 melee fight away at the distance he 

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:47.030
 useless 

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:49.400
 I hope he liked the video 

00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:50.990
 If so, then thumbs up and we tipped 

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:54.409
 Watch us measure battlefield 4 video 

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:57.220
 shake of lwl where skin pure my 

00:07:54.409 --> 00:07:57.220
 schnitzel and torch
