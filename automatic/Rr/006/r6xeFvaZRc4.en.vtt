00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.210 
curl really easily I just kind of rub it
in<00:02:06.119> between<00:02:06.270> two<00:02:06.600> of<00:02:06.630> my<00:02:06.780> fingers<00:02:06.840> and<00:02:07.709> kind<00:02:08.160> of

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
in between two of my fingers and kind of

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.210 
in between two of my fingers and kind of
curl<00:02:08.550> it<00:02:08.759> at<00:02:08.880> the<00:02:08.970> same<00:02:09.179> time<00:02:09.450> and<00:02:09.840> your<00:02:10.740> paper

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
curl it at the same time and your paper

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.550 
curl it at the same time and your paper
will<00:02:11.520> just<00:02:11.700> kind<00:02:11.880> of<00:02:11.940> curl<00:02:12.210> perfectly<00:02:13.200> and

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
will just kind of curl perfectly and

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.680 
will just kind of curl perfectly and
then

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
then

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.180 
then
I'll<00:02:16.690> just<00:02:16.870> use<00:02:17.170> a<00:02:17.200> little<00:02:17.410> hot<00:02:17.709> glue<00:02:17.740> on<00:02:18.069> the

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
I'll just use a little hot glue on the

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:25.530 
I'll just use a little hot glue on the
end<00:02:18.370> here<00:02:18.790> and<00:02:22.349> that<00:02:23.349> is<00:02:23.530> all<00:02:23.739> it<00:02:23.980> is<00:02:24.360> so<00:02:25.360> we're

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
end here and that is all it is so we're

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.600 
end here and that is all it is so we're
just<00:02:25.569> gonna<00:02:25.780> want<00:02:26.140> to<00:02:26.410> make<00:02:26.560> a<00:02:26.800> ton<00:02:27.130> of<00:02:27.160> these

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
just gonna want to make a ton of these

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:33.690 
just gonna want to make a ton of these
little<00:02:27.910> loops<00:02:28.120> right<00:02:28.510> here<00:02:32.250> so<00:02:33.250> you<00:02:33.430> just

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
little loops right here so you just

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.800 
little loops right here so you just
start<00:02:34.000> hot<00:02:34.569> gluing<00:02:35.080> your<00:02:35.890> ribbon<00:02:36.760> curls<00:02:36.970> all

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
start hot gluing your ribbon curls all

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.890 
start hot gluing your ribbon curls all
the<00:02:37.959> way<00:02:38.050> on<00:02:38.170> the<00:02:38.290> end<00:02:38.670> so<00:02:39.670> I<00:02:40.030> kind<00:02:40.420> of<00:02:40.540> you

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
the way on the end so I kind of you

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.979 
the way on the end so I kind of you
don't<00:02:40.989> have<00:02:41.200> to<00:02:41.319> go<00:02:41.440> in<00:02:41.560> a<00:02:41.650> pattern<00:02:42.040> but<00:02:43.030> I<00:02:43.420> kind

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
don't have to go in a pattern but I kind

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:48.150 
don't have to go in a pattern but I kind
of<00:02:44.080> like<00:02:44.319> that<00:02:45.040> look<00:02:45.340> so<00:02:45.700> I'm<00:02:45.880> gonna<00:02:46.950> I'm<00:02:47.950> just

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
of like that look so I'm gonna I'm just

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:53.039 
of like that look so I'm gonna I'm just
going<00:02:48.430> in<00:02:48.550> a<00:02:48.580> little<00:02:48.760> pattern<00:02:49.150> here<00:02:49.720> and<00:02:52.049> just

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:53.049 
going in a little pattern here and just

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:55.740 
going in a little pattern here and just
kind<00:02:53.260> of<00:02:53.319> eyeball<00:02:53.709> it<00:02:53.739> and<00:02:54.420> keep<00:02:55.420> all<00:02:55.720> your

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
kind of eyeball it and keep all your

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:01.979 
kind of eyeball it and keep all your
ends<00:02:56.650> at<00:02:56.920> the<00:02:57.130> same<00:02:57.160> length<00:02:57.640> if<00:02:57.880> you<00:02:57.910> can<00:03:00.989> so

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
ends at the same length if you can so

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:12.090 
ends at the same length if you can so
you<00:03:02.440> just<00:03:02.650> continue<00:03:05.519> and<00:03:06.519> keep<00:03:07.330> going<00:03:11.100> just

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.100 
you just continue and keep going just

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.759 
you just continue and keep going just
like<00:03:12.280> this<00:03:12.700> and<00:03:13.569> then<00:03:14.080> we'll<00:03:14.200> do<00:03:14.350> another

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:14.769 
like this and then we'll do another

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:19.530 
like this and then we'll do another
layer<00:03:15.130> so<00:03:17.340> you<00:03:18.340> can<00:03:18.610> kind<00:03:18.790> of<00:03:18.850> see<00:03:19.090> it's<00:03:19.299> moving

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
layer so you can kind of see it's moving

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:25.050 
layer so you can kind of see it's moving
along<00:03:19.810> and<00:03:21.630> one<00:03:22.630> tip<00:03:22.870> though<00:03:23.400> my<00:03:24.400> cordless

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
along and one tip though my cordless

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.750 
along and one tip though my cordless
glue<00:03:25.239> gun<00:03:25.570> on<00:03:26.140> my<00:03:26.260> head<00:03:26.440> it<00:03:26.859> we<00:03:27.310> just<00:03:27.400> went<00:03:27.609> out

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
glue gun on my head it we just went out

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.370 
glue gun on my head it we just went out
on<00:03:27.910> me<00:03:28.120> so<00:03:28.560> back<00:03:29.560> to<00:03:29.590> my<00:03:29.769> trusty<00:03:30.340> little<00:03:31.380> cord

one my four dollar one that's never let
me<00:03:34.810> down<00:03:34.959> for<00:03:35.320> ten<00:03:35.530> years<00:03:35.829> and<00:03:36.989> so<00:03:37.989> now<00:03:38.140> for<00:03:38.170> the

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
me down for ten years and so now for the

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.160 
me down for ten years and so now for the
second<00:03:38.859> row<00:03:38.980> you<00:03:39.340> can<00:03:40.329> see<00:03:40.359> I'm<00:03:40.720> just<00:03:40.750> kind<00:03:40.930> of

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 
second row you can see I'm just kind of

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:46.110 
second row you can see I'm just kind of
overlapping<00:03:43.470> about<00:03:44.470> halfway<00:03:44.920> down<00:03:45.519> from<00:03:45.940> your

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
overlapping about halfway down from your

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.849 
overlapping about halfway down from your
original<00:03:47.970> back<00:03:48.970> layer<00:03:49.239> and<00:03:49.680> then<00:03:50.680> we're<00:03:50.829> just

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:50.859 
original back layer and then we're just

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:55.410 
original back layer and then we're just
gonna<00:03:51.239> do<00:03:52.239> this<00:03:52.450> all<00:03:52.780> the<00:03:53.260> way<00:03:54.090> around<00:03:55.090> for<00:03:55.299> the

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420 
gonna do this all the way around for the

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.250 
gonna do this all the way around for the
second<00:03:55.750> layer<00:03:57.329> so<00:03:58.329> now<00:03:58.480> that<00:03:58.540> I<00:03:58.900> have<00:03:59.079> this

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
second layer so now that I have this

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.069 
second layer so now that I have this
first<00:03:59.920> two<00:04:00.160> layers<00:04:00.310> all<00:04:00.640> done<00:04:00.880> I'm<00:04:01.239> going<00:04:01.959> to

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:02.079 
first two layers all done I'm going to

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:04.229 
first two layers all done I'm going to
insert<00:04:02.769> a<00:04:02.829> piece<00:04:03.160> into<00:04:03.519> the<00:04:03.549> middle

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:04.239 
insert a piece into the middle

insert a piece into the middle
I<00:04:04.269> just<00:04:04.660> cut<00:04:05.049> oh<00:04:05.579> it's<00:04:06.579> probably<00:04:08.250> eighteen<00:04:09.250> and

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
I just cut oh it's probably eighteen and

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.819 
I just cut oh it's probably eighteen and
a<00:04:09.489> half<00:04:09.670> inches<00:04:10.209> it's<00:04:10.660> two<00:04:10.930> pieces<00:04:11.109> that<00:04:11.500> I<00:04:11.530> put

we're<00:04:17.590> just<00:04:17.739> going<00:04:17.950> to<00:04:18.039> glue<00:04:18.190> this<00:04:18.489> inside

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
we're just going to glue this inside

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.279 
we're just going to glue this inside
right<00:04:21.160> here<00:04:21.489> and<00:04:21.910> we're<00:04:22.810> going<00:04:22.900> to<00:04:22.990> want<00:04:23.200> to

right here and we're going to want to
put<00:04:23.500> the<00:04:23.650> glue<00:04:23.890> leave<00:04:24.580> the<00:04:24.820> glue<00:04:25.090> away<00:04:25.780> from

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 
put the glue leave the glue away from

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.709 
put the glue leave the glue away from
this<00:04:26.260> top<00:04:26.650> edge<00:04:26.979> kind<00:04:27.789> of<00:04:27.940> put<00:04:28.060> it<00:04:28.150> on<00:04:28.270> the<00:04:28.390> two

this top edge kind of put it on the two

00:04:28.719 --> 00:04:35.789 
this top edge kind of put it on the two
the<00:04:29.049> bottom<00:04:29.409> 2/3<00:04:31.649> the<00:04:33.179> inside<00:04:34.179> to<00:04:34.449> ends<00:04:34.659> 2/3<00:04:35.619> of

the bottom 2/3 the inside to ends 2/3 of

00:04:35.799 --> 00:04:40.350 
the bottom 2/3 the inside to ends 2/3 of
the<00:04:36.119> way<00:04:37.119> of<00:04:37.269> the<00:04:37.360> paper<00:04:37.569> you'll<00:04:38.409> see<00:04:38.619> why<00:04:39.360> okay

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:40.360 
the way of the paper you'll see why okay

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.239 
the way of the paper you'll see why okay
so<00:04:40.389> now<00:04:40.749> that<00:04:40.929> we<00:04:41.019> have<00:04:41.259> this<00:04:41.619> part

00:04:42.239 --> 00:04:42.249 
so now that we have this part

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:45.949 
so now that we have this part
Lewton<00:04:42.819> inside<00:04:43.439> we're<00:04:44.439> gonna<00:04:44.529> do<00:04:44.769> this<00:04:44.919> last

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:45.959 
Lewton inside we're gonna do this last

00:04:45.959 --> 00:04:49.949 
Lewton inside we're gonna do this last
third<00:04:46.959> layer<00:04:47.459> and<00:04:48.459> i<00:04:48.519> have<00:04:48.699> my<00:04:48.909> piece<00:04:49.149> and<00:04:49.659> on

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:49.959 
third layer and i have my piece and on
