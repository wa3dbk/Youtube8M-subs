00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:04.720 
have to deal with it we've all kind of

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.600 
have to deal with it we've all kind of
gone<00:01:04.870> through<00:01:04.930> those<00:01:05.229> types<00:01:05.470> of<00:01:05.710> travel

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:06.610 
gone through those types of travel

gone through those types of travel
travel<00:01:07.420> arrangements<00:01:07.540> before<00:01:07.930> a<00:01:08.110> lot<00:01:08.350> of

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 
travel arrangements before a lot of

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.250 
travel arrangements before a lot of
times<00:01:08.500> worse<00:01:08.950> than<00:01:08.980> juniors<00:01:09.550> so<00:01:09.820> I<00:01:10.030> just<00:01:10.750> I

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:11.260 
times worse than juniors so I just I

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.920 
times worse than juniors so I just I
just<00:01:12.040> thought<00:01:12.430> about<00:01:12.460> junior<00:01:13.030> a<00:01:13.060> lot<00:01:13.240> and<00:01:13.480> what

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:13.930 
just thought about junior a lot and what

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:15.210 
just thought about junior a lot and what
they<00:01:14.080> went<00:01:14.380> through<00:01:14.470> there<00:01:14.710> and<00:01:14.830> I<00:01:14.920> thought<00:01:15.100> if

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.220 
they went through there and I thought if

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:16.350 
they went through there and I thought if
I<00:01:15.340> went<00:01:15.520> through<00:01:15.640> that<00:01:15.790> then<00:01:16.060> I<00:01:16.120> can<00:01:16.270> go

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:16.360 
I went through that then I can go

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.220 
I went through that then I can go
through<00:01:16.570> this

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:18.230 
through this

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:21.220
