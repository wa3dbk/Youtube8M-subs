00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:04.650
 this ufo here is the so-called de 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:06.470
 gaulle 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.690
 the name was from his creator 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:11.969
 group randy the word cars sees itself 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.190
 but rather as an artist of his sculptures 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.049
 drive just like normal cars but also 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.260
 that's what the sympathetic dreams look like 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.760
 little different 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:23.070
 I'm driving the lid of one of his 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:28.230
 normal driving position so he drives 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:30.150
 like any other vehicle too 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.250
 coolest am de gaulle one is but one 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:36.350
 absolutely unique thing 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.350
 which has no other bus or if 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:44.129
 I'll stop and show you how 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:46.079
 that works the basis for the 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.680
 today's dÃ©co liner was on the one hand 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:52.230
 dumped the 1973 gmc camper 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.739
 on the other the leader of a 50s 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.899
 years trucks over 8000 working hours and 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.210
 Randy invest over $ 100,000 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.309
 his artwork called deko leiner 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.910
 and in his vision from the bottom up 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.010
 drive 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.260
 which brings us back to the special feature 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:12.390
 Although the decoder is the vehicle 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:13.979
 in itself a special feature is the best 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.900
 At the de gaulle one is that he is two 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.340
 working driver places has on 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.590
 On a nice day we can dare 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.600
 namely, simply extend the roof from the roof 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.549
 Lock pin pull out steering wheel 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:30.540
 Slimming the handle should be extension 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:31.890
 put on it and the 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.420
 safety pin back in 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:41.159
 The steering wheel is now on 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:44.210
 Higher up here we have 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.210
 our secret staircase 

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:58.189
 and believe us or not now 

00:01:56.569 --> 00:02:02.000
 we can easily from up here 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:04.549
 drive off with almost 100 km h in the truest 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.380
 Sense of the word about US highways 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:08.959
 everything in accordance with the law 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.759
 it just is not in the law that that 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:12.980
 driving uphill we are already prohibited 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.170
 over 16,000 kilometers with the lid 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.760
 one driven on the roof and 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.420
 Believe it or not 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.420
 never stopped 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.870
 if it has to be stopped then usually 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.430
 because the tank is empty 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.350
 He is a petrol and many questions 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.970
 me what he probably consumed but it works 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.710
 I really do not care about the miles per kilometer 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.960
 But to the joy in the 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:46.510
 faces the people but i would 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.440
 say he needs about 23 liters 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.030
 100 kilometers 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.950
 the base vehicle where four and a half 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.110
 tons and we have it at just under three 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.430
 tons it reduces so runs his 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.750
 really good and has one 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:01.510
 manageable consumption for one 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:03.340
 mobile home the decoration unfortunately is not 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.230
 the only automobile sculpture the 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.660
 artist who has coarsely created 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.910
 various others such as the 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.220
 tanker as the basis as the name betrays 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.900
 a tank has as it is for one 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.580
 real artist loves when the 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.920
 although his works of art she has to 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:20.670
 sell to finance his delusion 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.360
 From deco lana would be randy for 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.890
 Separate 390,000 dollars 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.960
 Hopefully, there will soon be a buyer 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:29.550
 because we are curious what the 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.550
 artist comes up next
