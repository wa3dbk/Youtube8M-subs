to initially set up the place so we can

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.730

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
range for our target who is in the big

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.139 
range for our target who is in the big
blind<00:01:32.719> here<00:01:33.520> ideally<00:01:34.520> of<00:01:34.549> course<00:01:34.670> we'd<00:01:35.030> rather

00:01:35.139 --> 00:01:35.149 
blind here ideally of course we'd rather

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:40.239 
blind here ideally of course we'd rather
be<00:01:35.270> in<00:01:35.420> the<00:01:35.630> cut<00:01:36.079> off<00:01:36.109> or<00:01:36.530> or<00:01:36.770> button<00:01:37.869> but<00:01:39.249> in

00:01:40.239 --> 00:01:40.249 
be in the cut off or or button but in

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:42.669 
be in the cut off or or button but in
this<00:01:40.399> case<00:01:40.700> these<00:01:41.329> players<00:01:41.689> aren't<00:01:42.170> getting

00:01:42.669 --> 00:01:42.679 
this case these players aren't getting

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:45.039 
this case these players aren't getting
terribly<00:01:43.039> out<00:01:43.249> of<00:01:43.280> line<00:01:43.700> and<00:01:44.060> we're<00:01:44.899> really

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:45.049 
terribly out of line and we're really

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:47.020 
terribly out of line and we're really
widening<00:01:45.530> our<00:01:45.649> range<00:01:45.889> so<00:01:46.069> we<00:01:46.100> can<00:01:46.249> get<00:01:46.549> a<00:01:46.609> call

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
widening our range so we can get a call

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.929 
widening our range so we can get a call
from<00:01:47.479> the<00:01:47.689> weak<00:01:47.840> player<00:01:48.399> out<00:01:49.399> of<00:01:49.459> the<00:01:49.639> blinds

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:49.939 
from the weak player out of the blinds

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:52.719 
from the weak player out of the blinds
who's<00:01:50.479> calling<00:01:51.259> a<00:01:51.319> lot<00:01:51.469> of<00:01:51.590> hands<00:01:51.950> and<00:01:52.159> can

who's calling a lot of hands and can
play<00:01:52.909> this<00:01:53.090> pot<00:01:54.700> heads<00:01:55.700> up<00:01:55.939> you<00:01:56.359> know<00:01:56.479> in<00:01:56.509> a

single<00:01:56.959> raised<00:01:57.109> pot<00:01:57.639> but<00:01:58.639> in<00:01:58.850> this<00:01:59.149> case<00:01:59.450> we

00:02:00.129 --> 00:02:00.139 
single raised pot but in this case we

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:03.789 
single raised pot but in this case we
get<00:02:00.289> calls<00:02:00.590> from<00:02:00.799> the<00:02:01.459> button<00:02:01.789> and<00:02:02.499> the<00:02:03.499> small

get calls from the button and the small

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:05.940 
get calls from the button and the small
blind<00:02:04.039> which<00:02:04.279> foil<00:02:04.819> our<00:02:04.999> plan<00:02:05.240> a<00:02:05.270> little<00:02:05.569> bit

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.120 
blind which foil our plan a little bit
but<00:02:06.950> then<00:02:07.099> we<00:02:07.249> get<00:02:07.490> a<00:02:07.700> small<00:02:08.630> three<00:02:09.080> bet<00:02:09.289> from

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
a fairly sandwich position which is not

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.430 
a fairly sandwich position which is not
what<00:02:27.960> you<00:02:28.020> want<00:02:28.200> to<00:02:28.260> do<00:02:28.880> so<00:02:29.880> the<00:02:30.450> bus<00:02:30.630> best<00:02:31.200> play

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440

don't even need to do too much to let
the<00:02:36.360> rig's<00:02:36.570> know<00:02:36.930> that<00:02:37.350> this<00:02:37.740> is<00:02:37.950> potentially

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
the rig's know that this is potentially

the rig's know that this is potentially
going<00:02:38.760> to<00:02:39.120> be<00:02:39.300> a<00:02:39.480> much<00:02:40.070> bigger<00:02:41.070> pot<00:02:41.400> since<00:02:41.880> now

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
going to be a much bigger pot since now

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
open so and also by forbidding small you

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.500 
open so and also by forbidding small you
can<00:02:49.620> get<00:02:50.400> away<00:02:50.520> from<00:02:50.640> your<00:02:50.910> hand<00:02:51.150> if<00:02:51.450> the

button who's really the only player
we're<00:02:53.520> super<00:02:53.850> worried<00:02:54.209> about<00:02:54.390> in<00:02:54.510> this<00:02:54.570> a<00:02:54.780> on

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
we're super worried about in this a on

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.290 
we're super worried about in this a on
actually<00:02:55.320> flat<00:02:55.560> it<00:02:55.680> with<00:02:55.770> a<00:02:55.800> big<00:02:56.070> hand<00:02:56.310> so<00:02:57.090> we

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
actually flat it with a big hand so we

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.850 
actually flat it with a big hand so we
get<00:02:57.420> both<00:02:57.570> these<00:02:57.690> guys<00:02:57.900> to<00:02:58.140> fold<00:02:58.470> our<00:03:00.620> our<00:03:01.620> big

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
get both these guys to fold our our big

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.680 
get both these guys to fold our our big
blind<00:03:02.160> target<00:03:02.550> player<00:03:02.730> calls<00:03:03.180> which<00:03:03.540> is<00:03:03.660> a

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
blind target player calls which is a

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.110 
blind target player calls which is a
great<00:03:03.959> sign<00:03:04.200> because<00:03:04.260> then<00:03:04.860> we<00:03:04.950> know<00:03:05.160> his<00:03:05.850> hand

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
great sign because then we know his hand

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.850 
great sign because then we know his hand
is<00:03:06.410> fairly<00:03:07.410> weak<00:03:07.680> like<00:03:07.920> we<00:03:08.040> suspect<00:03:08.570> and<00:03:09.860> in

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
is fairly weak like we suspect and in

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.050 
is fairly weak like we suspect and in
this<00:03:10.980> case<00:03:11.220> the<00:03:11.640> flop<00:03:11.880> comes<00:03:12.180> 88<00:03:12.690> for<00:03:13.020> a<00:03:14.060> checks

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
this case the flop comes 88 for a checks

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.050 
this case the flop comes 88 for a checks
to<00:03:15.300> us<00:03:15.620> we<00:03:16.620> make<00:03:16.650> a<00:03:16.860> standard<00:03:17.280> continuation

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
to us we make a standard continuation

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.510 
to us we make a standard continuation
bet<00:03:18.090> and<00:03:19.080> get<00:03:19.200> them<00:03:19.290> a<00:03:19.350> fold<00:03:19.620> in<00:03:19.830> we're<00:03:20.340> doing

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:20.520 
bet and get them a fold in we're doing

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.400 
bet and get them a fold in we're doing
that<00:03:20.640> because<00:03:20.790> this<00:03:21.239> is<00:03:21.450> obviously<00:03:21.810> going<00:03:22.350> to

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
that because this is obviously going to

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.100 
that because this is obviously going to
be<00:03:22.470> a<00:03:22.920> huge<00:03:23.280> amount<00:03:23.580> of<00:03:23.640> time<00:03:23.850> like<00:03:24.209> a<00:03:24.420> sex<00:03:24.810> ace

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
be a huge amount of time like a sex ace

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:30.310 
be a huge amount of time like a sex ace
jack<00:03:26.840> plus<00:03:28.190> not<00:03:29.190> going<00:03:29.489> to<00:03:29.549> be<00:03:29.700> too<00:03:29.970> many

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:30.320 
jack plus not going to be too many

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:33.949 
jack plus not going to be too many
pocket<00:03:31.320> pairs<00:03:32.450> especially<00:03:33.450> big<00:03:33.660> pairs

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
pocket pairs especially big pairs

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.740 
pocket pairs especially big pairs
because<00:03:34.350> we<00:03:34.620> probably<00:03:35.280> would<00:03:35.519> see<00:03:35.730> a<00:03:35.760> five<00:03:36.450> bit

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
because we probably would see a five bit

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.080 
because we probably would see a five bit
out<00:03:36.989> of<00:03:37.019> our<00:03:37.260> weak<00:03:37.500> player<00:03:37.769> whose<00:03:38.160> you<00:03:38.940> know

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
out of our weak player whose you know

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.210 
out of our weak player whose you know
can<00:03:39.959> tell<00:03:40.140> he's<00:03:40.290> weak<00:03:40.470> to<00:03:40.620> begin<00:03:40.860> with<00:03:41.040> because

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
can tell he's weak to begin with because

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.900 
can tell he's weak to begin with because
he's<00:03:41.430> making<00:03:41.790> a<00:03:41.910> small<00:03:42.299> three-bet<00:03:43.170> multi-way

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910 
he's making a small three-bet multi-way

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:48.080 
he's making a small three-bet multi-way
and<00:03:44.910> in<00:03:45.030> this<00:03:45.150> case<00:03:45.560> I'll<00:03:46.560> bring<00:03:47.190> this<00:03:47.400> up<00:03:47.730> if<00:03:47.970> I

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
and in this case I'll bring this up if I

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:58.750 
and in this case I'll bring this up if I
can<00:03:49.130> he<00:03:50.130> actually<00:03:50.310> had<00:03:50.850> um<00:03:52.760> ace<00:03:53.989> Jack<00:03:55.040> yeah<00:03:56.570> so

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
can he actually had um ace Jack yeah so

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.420 
can he actually had um ace Jack yeah so
get<00:03:59.760> them<00:04:00.000> to<00:04:00.180> fold<00:04:00.799> with<00:04:01.799> a<00:04:01.829> decent<00:04:02.220> amount<00:04:02.280> of

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
get them to fold with a decent amount of

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.870 
get them to fold with a decent amount of
equity<00:04:02.610> against<00:04:03.239> our<00:04:03.390> range<00:04:03.750> and<00:04:04.519> when<00:04:05.519> a<00:04:05.549> pot

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
equity against our range and when a pot

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.300 
equity against our range and when a pot
that<00:04:06.120> we<00:04:06.299> should<00:04:06.540> otherwise<00:04:07.049> probably<00:04:07.590> not

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
that we should otherwise probably not

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.600 
that we should otherwise probably not
win<00:04:08.579> so<00:04:08.910> you<00:04:09.420> know<00:04:09.510> the<00:04:09.600> main<00:04:09.780> point<00:04:10.079> is<00:04:10.200> that

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:10.610 
win so you know the main point is that

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:16.039 
win so you know the main point is that
you<00:04:11.610> are<00:04:12.049> finding<00:04:13.190> as<00:04:14.510> minimal<00:04:15.510> risk<00:04:15.720> as<00:04:15.930> you

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
you are finding as minimal risk as you

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:21.469 
you are finding as minimal risk as you
can<00:04:16.320> to<00:04:16.859> get<00:04:16.979> the<00:04:17.160> pot<00:04:18.620> heads<00:04:19.620> up<00:04:19.859> against<00:04:20.609> the

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 
can to get the pot heads up against the

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:23.120 
can to get the pot heads up against the
the<00:04:21.870> weak<00:04:22.049> player<00:04:22.350> I<00:04:22.380> mean<00:04:22.650> obviously<00:04:22.830> you

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
the weak player I mean obviously you

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.430 
the weak player I mean obviously you
want<00:04:23.310> to<00:04:23.400> keep<00:04:23.580> your<00:04:23.820> SP<00:04:24.270> are<00:04:24.450> as<00:04:24.780> large<00:04:25.140> as

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
want to keep your SP are as large as

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:26.510 
want to keep your SP are as large as
possible<00:04:25.470> because<00:04:26.040> that's<00:04:26.250> going<00:04:26.370> to<00:04:26.460> allow

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
possible because that's going to allow

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.740 
possible because that's going to allow
you<00:04:26.640> to<00:04:26.760> I'll<00:04:26.970> play<00:04:27.180> them<00:04:27.360> the<00:04:27.630> most<00:04:28.910> but<00:04:29.910> you

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:38.699 
if you're targeting the the players

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:46.879

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:51.750 
player same table same session this time

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.110

the<00:04:52.020> player<00:04:52.229> is<00:04:52.560> under<00:04:53.069> the<00:04:53.190> gun<00:04:53.400> we're<00:04:53.879> in<00:04:54.030> the

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
the player is under the gun we're in the

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:58.100 
the player is under the gun we're in the
cut<00:04:54.360> off<00:04:55.699> the<00:04:56.699> weak<00:04:56.879> target<00:04:57.240> player<00:04:57.419> opens

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.110 
cut off the weak target player opens

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.189 
cut off the weak target player opens
under<00:04:58.379> the<00:04:58.500> gun<00:04:58.710> and<00:04:59.599> we<00:05:00.599> have<00:05:00.720> ten<00:05:00.960> ated

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:01.199 
under the gun and we have ten ated

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:03.200 
under the gun and we have ten ated
diamonds<00:05:01.680> and<00:05:01.830> we<00:05:01.889> make<00:05:02.069> a<00:05:02.340> smaller<00:05:02.940> size

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210 
diamonds and we make a smaller size

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:07.249 
diamonds and we make a smaller size
three<00:05:04.110> bet<00:05:04.289> in<00:05:04.500> position<00:05:05.300> again<00:05:06.300> we're

00:05:07.249 --> 00:05:07.259 
three bet in position again we're

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:11.570 
three bet in position again we're
looking<00:05:07.650> to<00:05:08.270> ISO<00:05:09.270> this<00:05:09.479> player<00:05:10.009> have<00:05:11.009> position

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:11.580 
looking to ISO this player have position

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:16.460 
looking to ISO this player have position
on<00:05:11.729> them<00:05:11.940> in<00:05:12.180> a<00:05:12.659> rear<00:05:13.139> a<00:05:13.259> spot<00:05:14.030> flop<00:05:15.030> comes<00:05:15.470> 647

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:16.470 
on them in a rear a spot flop comes 647

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:21.140 
on them in a rear a spot flop comes 647
so<00:05:17.310> here<00:05:17.699> we<00:05:18.500> essentially<00:05:19.500> have<00:05:20.150> double

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:21.150 
so here we essentially have double

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:25.209 
so here we essentially have double
gutter<00:05:21.360> and<00:05:21.750> backdoor<00:05:22.229> diamond<00:05:22.620> draws

00:05:25.209 --> 00:05:25.219 

00:05:25.219 --> 00:05:29.029 

opponent<00:05:26.219> checks<00:05:26.810> not<00:05:27.810> bad<00:05:28.050> play<00:05:28.349> here<00:05:28.680> to<00:05:28.889> go

00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:29.039 
opponent checks not bad play here to go

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:34.219 
opponent checks not bad play here to go
ahead<00:05:29.310> and<00:05:30.409> bet<00:05:31.409> but<00:05:32.479> ideally<00:05:33.479> if<00:05:33.780> they<00:05:34.169> do

00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:34.229 
ahead and bet but ideally if they do

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:38.209 
ahead and bet but ideally if they do
have<00:05:34.650> a<00:05:34.680> hand<00:05:36.590> we<00:05:37.590> don't<00:05:37.680> want<00:05:37.860> to<00:05:37.919> get<00:05:38.009> blown

00:05:38.209 --> 00:05:38.219 
have a hand we don't want to get blown

00:05:38.219 --> 00:05:40.879 
have a hand we don't want to get blown
off<00:05:38.370> our<00:05:38.580> hand<00:05:38.849> because<00:05:39.090> we<00:05:39.270> have<00:05:39.479> a<00:05:40.020> hand<00:05:40.530> has

00:05:40.879 --> 00:05:40.889 
off our hand because we have a hand has

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:42.290 
off our hand because we have a hand has
a<00:05:40.919> decent<00:05:41.190> amount<00:05:41.370> of<00:05:41.490> potential<00:05:41.789> where<00:05:42.180> we're

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:42.300 
a decent amount of potential where we're

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:46.760 
a decent amount of potential where we're
a<00:05:42.330> little<00:05:42.509> bit<00:05:42.719> deeper<00:05:43.139> this<00:05:43.289> time<00:05:44.750> so<00:05:45.770> you

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:46.770 
a little bit deeper this time so you

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:49.159 
a little bit deeper this time so you
know<00:05:46.860> peeling<00:05:47.370> off<00:05:47.490> one<00:05:47.520> card<00:05:48.210> and<00:05:48.539> seeing<00:05:49.050> how

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:49.169 
know peeling off one card and seeing how

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:50.480 
know peeling off one card and seeing how
our<00:05:49.289> opponent<00:05:49.650> reacts<00:05:49.860> on<00:05:50.009> the<00:05:50.099> term<00:05:50.250> if<00:05:50.400> they

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:50.490 
our opponent reacts on the term if they

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:53.269 
our opponent reacts on the term if they
check<00:05:50.729> again<00:05:51.090> on<00:05:51.389> a<00:05:51.449> turn<00:05:52.139> then<00:05:52.650> we're<00:05:52.949> firing

00:05:53.269 --> 00:05:53.279 
check again on a turn then we're firing

00:05:53.279 --> 00:05:58.730 
check again on a turn then we're firing
pretty<00:05:53.669> much<00:05:53.849> any<00:05:54.360> card<00:05:55.400> so<00:05:56.400> we<00:05:56.729> check<00:05:57.710> Ace<00:05:58.710> of

00:05:58.730 --> 00:05:58.740 
pretty much any card so we check Ace of

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:00.409 
pretty much any card so we check Ace of
Diamonds<00:05:59.009> comes<00:05:59.430> out<00:05:59.610> so<00:05:59.759> now<00:05:59.880> we<00:05:59.940> pick<00:06:00.180> up<00:06:00.300> a

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:00.419 
Diamonds comes out so now we pick up a

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:02.839 
Diamonds comes out so now we pick up a
diamond<00:06:00.750> drawer<00:06:00.930> opponent<00:06:01.469> checks<00:06:01.680> again<00:06:02.039> so

00:06:02.839 --> 00:06:02.849 
diamond drawer opponent checks again so

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:03.860 
diamond drawer opponent checks again so
now<00:06:02.940> of<00:06:02.969> course<00:06:03.300> we're<00:06:03.539> going<00:06:03.659> to<00:06:03.719> go<00:06:03.840> ahead

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:03.870 
now of course we're going to go ahead

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:05.930 
now of course we're going to go ahead
and<00:06:04.139> bet<00:06:04.349> we<00:06:04.560> don't<00:06:04.680> have<00:06:04.770> to<00:06:04.830> bet<00:06:04.979> that<00:06:05.009> much<00:06:05.370> 5

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:05.940 
and bet we don't have to bet that much 5

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:09.740 
and bet we don't have to bet that much 5
into<00:06:06.479> 8<00:06:06.810> and<00:06:07.199> three<00:06:07.380> quarters<00:06:08.270> our<00:06:09.270> opponent

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:09.750 
into 8 and three quarters our opponent

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:14.719 
into 8 and three quarters our opponent
calls<00:06:10.020> though<00:06:11.779> fortunately<00:06:12.779> we<00:06:13.490> hit<00:06:14.490> our

00:06:14.719 --> 00:06:14.729 
calls though fortunately we hit our

00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:18.320 
calls though fortunately we hit our
diamond<00:06:15.659> so<00:06:15.870> now<00:06:16.560> we<00:06:16.620> could<00:06:16.860> pretty<00:06:17.219> much<00:06:17.340> you

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:18.330 
diamond so now we could pretty much you

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:21.170 
diamond so now we could pretty much you
know<00:06:18.479> narrow<00:06:19.110> down<00:06:19.440> that<00:06:19.500> our<00:06:20.099> opponent<00:06:21.090> is

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:21.180 
know narrow down that our opponent is

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:22.490 
know narrow down that our opponent is
probably<00:06:21.539> going<00:06:21.690> to<00:06:21.779> have<00:06:21.900> some<00:06:22.139> kind<00:06:22.259> of<00:06:22.349> a

probably going to have some kind of a

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:26.260 
probably going to have some kind of a
sex<00:06:22.830> hand<00:06:23.250> here<00:06:23.900> most<00:06:24.900> of<00:06:25.110> the<00:06:25.199> time<00:06:25.380> almost

always and you know no sets probably not

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:35.990 
always and you know no sets probably not
any<00:06:34.229> other<00:06:34.590> big<00:06:34.889> pairs<00:06:35.190> like<00:06:35.400> kings<00:06:35.699> queens

00:06:40.189 --> 00:06:40.199 
their range is going to be essentially a

00:06:40.199 --> 00:06:45.560 
their range is going to be essentially a
sex<00:06:41.270> so<00:06:42.270> get<00:06:43.139> check<00:06:43.580> and<00:06:44.580> here<00:06:45.060> we<00:06:45.210> can<00:06:45.300> bet
