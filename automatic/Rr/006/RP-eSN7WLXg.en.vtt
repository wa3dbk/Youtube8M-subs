00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 Hello, this is mine now 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.299
 quick video because i need 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.400
 decide on the choice of a smartphone I do not 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.860
 I could choose I hope that you are me 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.679
 help up to this more than three and a half 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.049
 years I lived with lg optimus one 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.750
 very high quality 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.970
 smart phone he didn't fall broke 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.789
 apart is still alive healthy I think 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.500
 another ten years it can be used but 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:28.140
 on us already 2015 by 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.410
 already something more modern to purchase 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.719
 I'm probably with more than 30 models of smartphones 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.680
 selected five and i need to choose 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:39.690
 some of them but do not know what 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:42.239
 the first option is the iphone the last he 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.100
 terribly expensive but i like the design from 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.079
 I do not have an apple 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.760
 I'm not a fan, but they can do design 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.579
 really cool really like 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.670
 design they made with high quality but 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.770
 the price is damn and it is a little outdated that is 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.550
 one gigabyte of RAM only four 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:02.520
 inches screen on other smartphones further 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.739
 would be more screens and price again price 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.630
 bites strongly very much so i 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.479
 I will consider the option with a copy of iPhone 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.670
 win don't laugh don't spit me too 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.250
 I thought that there was only a golem Chinese 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.080
 TV 4 cars but there are full 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.390
 iphone duplicates almost on the same 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.460
 the factory made me familiar for everything i 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.520
 bought myself every day now boasts 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.509
 what is her cool android besides it 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.430
 android that is, it is like an external background 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:32.009
 cost a penny penny with something of a thousand and this 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.930
 Android-what to whom I used to but I 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.930
 used to android and ios never in my life 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.130
 did not sit stranger even works but with 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.979
 the other side is a bit dumb 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.649
 buy so i ask those from 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.689
 who have this experience who bought copies 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.189
 iphone especially in this store that is 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.720
 share your experiences ie links 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.150
 on shops will be on 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.250
 annotations and in the description in general he generally 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.650
 as he is not buggy he does not fall apart on 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.830
 parts because I have this to a friend 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:00.360
 Of course trusting but still all these copies 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.850
 they and drinks are different 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.130
 and you need to keep in mind that that's for sure 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.990
 a big risk probably although not necessary in 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.060
 general besides a copy for which 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:12.090
 public money is worth i'm considering 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:14.580
 Nexus 5 is the most optimal 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.160
 last year’s smartphone but relatively 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:20.760
 last year at the end he came out very 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.680
 modern very powerful and google and lg 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.500
 g2 companies that get me very strong 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:28.500
 I trust therefore my choice is worth it first 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.300
 On it is on the nexus 5 inches screen 2 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.390
 gigabytes of RAM and 16 gigabytes 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:35.640
 internal memory but cannot be supplemented 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.680
 you can not even sd card to become a minus 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.330
 but overall very modern 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.850
 high-quality phone I kept it in 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.760
 I really liked the hands 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:45.750
 I will consider the closest analogue lg g2 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.030
 almost the same thing just a little 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.840
 bigger screen and slightly better battery 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.820
 this is of course a plus 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.910
 better battery but didn’t know i needed 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:56.070
 larger screen and i never kept in 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.720
 arms so if you have g2 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:00.750
 write how it is generally high quality 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:03.720
 did no backlash there big gaps and 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.400
 so further, besides this, I will consider 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.280
 sony xperia t2 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.600
 because it is inexpensive enough also 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.750
 how much the pump costs but very 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:15.390
 6 inch big screen is a lot 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.920
 that is, films to watch the most, but I do not 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.220
 I even know how such a shovel with me 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.920
 to wear 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.220
 m is too little and besides 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.049
 him 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:25.140
 outdated features ie there 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:27.180
 one gigabyte of processor memory is worse 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.400
 There is 8 GB of internal memory and only 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.320
 so it’s not a question of those who have 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.630
 in sony xperia or it does not slow you down 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.970
 are there enough of these characteristics for 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:39.360
 such a huge screen I was a little 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:41.459
 I doubt this is an account in general references to 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.100
 Off site and scene characteristics can 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:47.489
 found in the description also in the annotation and all 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:50.340
 links can go compare prices and 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:51.630
 make your verdict what's better and besides 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.090
 that will now be a reference to 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:55.590
 vote will make a vote 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.330
 For one of these five options, I do not 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.200
 I promise that while I make the lasso rolls 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.239
 the choice 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.890
 don't already have some favorite in this but 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:03.980
 I would still listen to 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:05.970
 another opinion to a stranger therefore 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:08.400
 I will definitely see how you vote 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:10.920
 then at the cafe group I will tell you what 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.080
 same model chose general thank you for 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.910
 help write comments and vote 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:17.220
 well see you in the following videos 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:19.280
 subscribe to the VKontakte group there 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:23.329
 there will be all this news 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.329
 bye thanks for your attention
