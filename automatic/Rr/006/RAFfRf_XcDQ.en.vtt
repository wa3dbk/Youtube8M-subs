00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:25.340 
is also known as the shortest member of

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.600 
is also known as the shortest member of
the<00:00:25.430> ak-12<00:00:25.880> family<00:00:26.840> and<00:00:27.110> it<00:00:27.860> essentially<00:00:28.340> is

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:28.610 
the ak-12 family and it essentially is

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:31.120 
the ak-12 family and it essentially is
going<00:00:28.849> to<00:00:28.939> be<00:00:29.029> replacing<00:00:29.419> the<00:00:29.660> aks-74u<00:00:30.529> from

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:31.130 
going to be replacing the aks-74u from

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.170 
going to be replacing the aks-74u from
battlefield<00:00:31.759> 3<00:00:31.990> so<00:00:32.990> here<00:00:33.590> it<00:00:33.680> is<00:00:33.830> the<00:00:34.280> aku<00:00:34.790> 12

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:35.180 
battlefield 3 so here it is the aku 12

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:40.210 
battlefield 3 so here it is the aku 12
carbine<00:00:38.140> so<00:00:39.140> basically<00:00:39.590> this<00:00:39.829> gun<00:00:40.040> has

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:40.220 
carbine so basically this gun has

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.610 
carbine so basically this gun has
similar<00:00:40.640> traits<00:00:41.030> to<00:00:41.300> the<00:00:41.329> aks<00:00:42.020> but<00:00:42.350> in<00:00:42.500> the

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
similar traits to the aks but in the

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.760 
similar traits to the aks but in the
ak-12<00:00:43.040> format<00:00:43.880> and<00:00:44.120> you<00:00:45.080> know<00:00:45.200> there's<00:00:45.500> always

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:45.770 
ak-12 format and you know there's always

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:47.410 
ak-12 format and you know there's always
arguments<00:00:46.310> going<00:00:46.640> around<00:00:46.940> is<00:00:47.180> it<00:00:47.330> a

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
arguments going around is it a

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.420 
arguments going around is it a
submachine<00:00:47.900> gun<00:00:48.110> is<00:00:48.380> an<00:00:48.530> assault<00:00:48.950> rifle

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
technically it's labeled as a submachine

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.860 
technically it's labeled as a submachine
gun<00:00:51.770> due<00:00:52.010> to<00:00:52.220> its<00:00:52.370> small<00:00:52.670> size<00:00:52.940> even<00:00:53.540> though<00:00:53.690> it

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
gun due to its small size even though it

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.110 
gun due to its small size even though it
fires<00:00:54.140> the<00:00:54.380> exact<00:00:54.680> same<00:00:54.860> round<00:00:55.190> as<00:00:55.430> the<00:00:55.730> ak-12

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
fires the exact same round as the ak-12

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.050 
fires the exact same round as the ak-12
fairly<00:00:56.870> similar<00:00:57.290> to<00:00:57.320> the<00:00:57.650> ak-12<00:00:58.100> this<00:00:58.700> weapon

00:00:59.050 --> 00:00:59.060 
fairly similar to the ak-12 this weapon

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:01.540 
fairly similar to the ak-12 this weapon
is<00:00:59.210> also<00:00:59.630> ambidextrous<00:01:00.560> meaning<00:01:01.130> that<00:01:01.280> you

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 
is also ambidextrous meaning that you

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:02.890 
is also ambidextrous meaning that you
could<00:01:01.700> be<00:01:01.940> left-handed<00:01:02.360> and<00:01:02.810> right-handed

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:02.900 
could be left-handed and right-handed

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.410 
could be left-handed and right-handed
and<00:01:03.710> still<00:01:04.009> successfully<00:01:04.670> be<00:01:04.820> able<00:01:05.089> to<00:01:05.210> use

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 
and still successfully be able to use

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.330 
and still successfully be able to use
this<00:01:05.600> weapon<00:01:05.840> and<00:01:06.200> even<00:01:06.439> while<00:01:06.860> in<00:01:07.100> combat

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
this weapon and even while in combat

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.249 
this weapon and even while in combat
this<00:01:07.909> weapon<00:01:08.270> can<00:01:08.390> be<00:01:08.450> also<00:01:08.840> really<00:01:09.229> useful

00:01:09.249 --> 00:01:09.259 
this weapon can be also really useful

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:11.620 
this weapon can be also really useful
just<00:01:10.040> as<00:01:10.159> a<00:01:10.189> backup<00:01:10.490> in<00:01:10.820> case<00:01:10.850> of<00:01:11.180> a<00:01:11.270> sticky

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
just as a backup in case of a sticky

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.600 
just as a backup in case of a sticky
situation<00:01:11.659> the<00:01:12.590> stock<00:01:12.799> on<00:01:12.979> the<00:01:13.100> weapon<00:01:13.460> can

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
situation the stock on the weapon can

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:15.789 
situation the stock on the weapon can
also<00:01:13.820> be<00:01:14.060> folded<00:01:14.479> up<00:01:14.659> and<00:01:14.960> even<00:01:15.530> though<00:01:15.650> it

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:15.799 
also be folded up and even though it

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:17.709 
also be folded up and even though it
limits<00:01:16.130> the<00:01:16.280> full<00:01:16.490> auto<00:01:16.700> ability<00:01:17.299> even<00:01:17.600> though

00:01:17.709 --> 00:01:17.719 
limits the full auto ability even though

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:20.020 
limits the full auto ability even though
it<00:01:17.960> is<00:01:18.109> a<00:01:18.140> small<00:01:18.560> weapon<00:01:19.039> it<00:01:19.310> could<00:01:19.429> also<00:01:19.640> still

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
it is a small weapon it could also still

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:21.819 
it is a small weapon it could also still
be<00:01:20.179> used<00:01:20.420> even<00:01:20.719> while<00:01:20.869> the<00:01:20.990> stock<00:01:21.229> is<00:01:21.380> folded

00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:21.829 
be used even while the stock is folded

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:24.399 
be used even while the stock is folded
which<00:01:22.100> is<00:01:22.280> perfect<00:01:22.700> for<00:01:22.789> CQB<00:01:23.600> the<00:01:23.840> weapon<00:01:24.200> is

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409 
which is perfect for CQB the weapon is

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:27.580 
which is perfect for CQB the weapon is
basically<00:01:25.100> in<00:01:25.460> a<00:01:25.640> k-12<00:01:25.880> but<00:01:26.659> has<00:01:26.929> a<00:01:26.960> smaller

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
basically in a k-12 but has a smaller

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.679 
basically in a k-12 but has a smaller
handguard<00:01:28.159> a<00:01:28.369> shorter<00:01:28.729> barrel<00:01:29.179> a<00:01:29.210> different

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:29.689 
handguard a shorter barrel a different

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:32.169 
handguard a shorter barrel a different
muzzle<00:01:29.960> break<00:01:30.140> and<00:01:30.319> even<00:01:30.619> a<00:01:30.799> lower<00:01:31.310> front

00:01:32.169 --> 00:01:32.179 
muzzle break and even a lower front

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:33.999 
muzzle break and even a lower front
sight<00:01:32.539> and<00:01:32.780> also<00:01:33.380> there<00:01:33.590> is<00:01:33.619> no<00:01:33.770> difference

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:34.009 
sight and also there is no difference

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:37.300 
sight and also there is no difference
between<00:01:34.939> this<00:01:35.149> gun<00:01:35.420> and<00:01:35.630> the<00:01:35.749> ak-12<00:01:36.189> besides<00:01:37.189> a

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
between this gun and the ak-12 besides a

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.130 
between this gun and the ak-12 besides a
package<00:01:37.640> may<00:01:37.850> be<00:01:37.909> acquiring<00:01:38.390> targets<00:01:38.869> from<00:01:39.020> a

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
package may be acquiring targets from a

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.620 
package may be acquiring targets from a
longer<00:01:39.380> distance<00:01:39.639> so<00:01:40.639> in<00:01:40.819> conclusion<00:01:41.030> the

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
longer distance so in conclusion the

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.050 
longer distance so in conclusion the
ak-12<00:01:42.289> happens<00:01:42.889> to<00:01:42.979> be<00:01:43.069> just<00:01:43.310> like<00:01:43.609> one<00:01:43.850> of<00:01:43.939> my
