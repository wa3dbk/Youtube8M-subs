hey guys how's it going um today I'm
going<00:00:03.120> to<00:00:03.240> show<00:00:03.629> you<00:00:03.659> how<00:00:04.440> to<00:00:04.470> open<00:00:04.770> your<00:00:04.950> n8<00:00:05.250> e

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
going to show you how to open your n8 e

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.169 
going to show you how to open your n8 e
type<00:00:05.750> for<00:00:06.750> online<00:00:07.109> gaming<00:00:07.500> on<00:00:07.830> the<00:00:08.040> PC<00:00:08.429> n8<00:00:09.150> e

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
type for online gaming on the PC n8 e

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.419 
type for online gaming on the PC n8 e
stands<00:00:09.840> for<00:00:09.929> network<00:00:10.559> address<00:00:10.950> translation

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
stands for network address translation

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.039 
stands for network address translation
so<00:00:11.759> that's<00:00:11.940> how<00:00:12.059> your<00:00:12.269> router<00:00:12.480> interact<00:00:12.870> with

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
so that's how your router interact with

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:14.570 
so that's how your router interact with
other<00:00:13.170> routers<00:00:13.559> for<00:00:13.769> online<00:00:14.070> gaming

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
other routers for online gaming

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.720 
other routers for online gaming
this<00:00:15.389> can<00:00:15.570> affect<00:00:15.660> PlayStation<00:00:16.440> 3<00:00:16.920> Xbox<00:00:17.160> 360

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
this can affect PlayStation 3 Xbox 360

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.210 
this can affect PlayStation 3 Xbox 360
and<00:00:18.090> personal<00:00:18.990> computers<00:00:19.380> running<00:00:20.070> on

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
and personal computers running on

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.710 
and personal computers running on
wireless<00:00:20.490> networks<00:00:20.670> and<00:00:21.240> if<00:00:21.420> you're<00:00:21.539> plugged

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
wireless networks and if you're plugged

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.290 
wireless networks and if you're plugged
in<00:00:21.900> you<00:00:22.020> should<00:00:22.080> be<00:00:22.289> fine<00:00:23.090> now

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
in you should be fine now

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.000 
in you should be fine now
as<00:00:24.359> you<00:00:24.779> can<00:00:24.869> see<00:00:25.019> I<00:00:25.050> have<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.439> test<00:00:25.830> driver

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
as you can see I have the test driver

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.519 
as you can see I have the test driver
limited<00:00:26.310> to<00:00:26.689> starting<00:00:27.689> screen<00:00:27.960> open<00:00:28.320> we<00:00:28.500> can

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
limited to starting screen open we can

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.580 
limited to starting screen open we can
see<00:00:28.650> that<00:00:28.830> my<00:00:28.949> n8<00:00:29.220> e<00:00:29.250> type<00:00:29.609> is<00:00:29.760> open<00:00:30.060> full<00:00:30.269> cone

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:30.590 
see that my n8 e type is open full cone

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.380 
see that my n8 e type is open full cone
and<00:00:31.590> I<00:00:31.890> mean<00:00:32.070> everything<00:00:32.489> is<00:00:32.610> translating

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
and I mean everything is translating

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.510 
and I mean everything is translating
properly<00:00:33.870> other<00:00:34.770> options<00:00:35.190> would<00:00:35.280> be<00:00:35.340> like

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
properly other options would be like

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.910 
properly other options would be like
strict<00:00:35.880> symmetric<00:00:36.360> which<00:00:36.540> means<00:00:36.780> it's<00:00:37.290> not

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
strict symmetric which means it's not

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.130 
strict symmetric which means it's not
working<00:00:38.309> at<00:00:38.399> all<00:00:38.570> so<00:00:39.570> I'm<00:00:39.780> going<00:00:39.930> to<00:00:39.960> show<00:00:40.079> you

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
working at all so I'm going to show you

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.900 
working at all so I'm going to show you
how<00:00:40.200> to<00:00:40.260> fix<00:00:40.440> that<00:00:40.620> what<00:00:41.430> you<00:00:41.489> want<00:00:41.610> to<00:00:41.670> do<00:00:41.790> is

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
how to fix that what you want to do is

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.280 
how to fix that what you want to do is
open<00:00:42.149> up<00:00:42.210> any<00:00:42.420> internet<00:00:42.750> browser<00:00:42.780> does<00:00:43.260> not

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
open up any internet browser does not

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.510 
open up any internet browser does not
matter

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
matter

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.049 
matter
and<00:00:45.860> typically<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.430> address<00:00:47.789> you<00:00:47.879> want<00:00:48.000> to

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
and typically the address you want to

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:54.830 
and typically the address you want to
type<00:00:48.180> in<00:00:48.329> is<00:00:49.399> 192.168.1.1<00:00:52.280> however<00:00:53.280> if<00:00:53.840> you

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
type in is 192.168.1.1 however if you

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.930 
type in is 192.168.1.1 however if you
have<00:00:55.350> a<00:00:55.410> different<00:00:55.680> router<00:00:55.860> is<00:00:56.219> on<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.520> box<00:00:56.730> so

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
have a different router is on the box so

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.189 
have a different router is on the box so
if<00:00:57.090> you<00:00:57.149> have<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.360> box<00:00:57.539> or<00:00:57.780> you<00:00:57.809> could<00:00:57.960> google

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
if you have the box or you could google

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.180 
if you have the box or you could google
it<00:00:58.350> um<00:00:58.500> because<00:00:59.100> this<00:00:59.340> is<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.460> wrt<00:00:59.910> 120<00:01:00.329> n<00:01:01.190> router

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
it um because this is a wrt 120 n router

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.439 
it um because this is a wrt 120 n router
so<00:01:02.579> if<00:01:02.670> you<00:01:02.760> know<00:01:02.850> what<00:01:02.940> kind<00:01:03.090> of<00:01:03.120> router<00:01:03.300> you

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
so if you know what kind of router you

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:04.939 
so if you know what kind of router you
have<00:01:03.600> just<00:01:03.840> go<00:01:04.019> ahead<00:01:04.140> and<00:01:04.260> look<00:01:04.320> at<00:01:04.439> it<00:01:04.500> um<00:01:04.769> you

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
have just go ahead and look at it um you

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.710 
have just go ahead and look at it um you
can<00:01:05.070> usually<00:01:05.189> figure<00:01:05.549> out<00:01:05.760> I<00:01:05.970> mean<00:01:06.510> you<00:01:06.600> can

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
can usually figure out I mean you can

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.090 
can usually figure out I mean you can
find<00:01:06.930> out<00:01:07.080> how<00:01:07.260> to<00:01:07.320> access<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.799> Internet

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
find out how to access the Internet

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.289 
find out how to access the Internet
gateway<00:01:08.430> once<00:01:08.670> again<00:01:08.880> let's<00:01:09.030> call<00:01:09.150> it<00:01:09.210> the

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
gateway once again let's call it the

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.859 
gateway once again let's call it the
Internet<00:01:09.630> gateway<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:11.360> it's<00:01:12.360> access<00:01:12.689> to<00:01:12.780> the

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
Internet gateway and it's access to the

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.350 
Internet gateway and it's access to the
router<00:01:12.990> settings<00:01:13.320> um<00:01:13.970> so<00:01:14.970> there's<00:01:15.119> a<00:01:15.210> couple

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
router settings um so there's a couple

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.469 
router settings um so there's a couple
things<00:01:15.540> you<00:01:15.630> have<00:01:15.780> to<00:01:15.810> do<00:01:15.930> in<00:01:16.049> here<00:01:16.340> in<00:01:17.479> once

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
things you have to do in here in once

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.590 
things you have to do in here in once
you<00:01:18.570> first<00:01:18.869> get<00:01:19.500> in<00:01:19.740> here<00:01:20.549> it<00:01:20.670> should<00:01:20.790> be<00:01:21.299> set

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
you first get in here it should be set

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.219 
you first get in here it should be set
up<00:01:21.720> and<00:01:21.960> you<00:01:22.350> want<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.560> find<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:24.229> advanced

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
up and you want to find the advanced

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.289 
up and you want to find the advanced
routing<00:01:25.380> area<00:01:25.770> so<00:01:26.700> I<00:01:26.729> just<00:01:26.909> click<00:01:27.090> through<00:01:27.210> all

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
routing area so I just click through all

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.319 
routing area so I just click through all
these<00:01:27.479> up<00:01:27.659> have<00:01:28.110> some<00:01:28.350> advanced<00:01:29.159> routing<00:01:29.329> or

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
these up have some advanced routing or

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:31.100 
these up have some advanced routing or
n80

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
n80

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.039 
n80
area<00:01:31.740> you<00:01:31.920> want<00:01:32.100> na<00:01:32.340> T<00:01:32.400> on<00:01:32.790> which<00:01:33.450> again<00:01:33.810> means

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
area you want na T on which again means

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.719 
area you want na T on which again means
that<00:01:34.200> network<00:01:34.560> address<00:01:34.950> translation<00:01:35.369> you

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
that network address translation you

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.770 
that network address translation you
want<00:01:35.880> that<00:01:36.000> turned<00:01:36.180> on<00:01:37.700> then<00:01:38.700> after<00:01:39.299> that<00:01:39.509> you

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
want that turned on then after that you

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.560 
want that turned on then after that you
want<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.110> go<00:01:40.259> to<00:01:40.400> wireless<00:01:41.400> and<00:01:41.850> advanced

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
want to go to wireless and advanced

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.789 
want to go to wireless and advanced
wireless<00:01:42.990> settings<00:01:44.720> know<00:01:45.720> you<00:01:45.780> don't

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
wireless settings know you don't

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.870 
wireless settings know you don't
this<00:01:47.340> does<00:01:47.549> not<00:01:47.640> matter<00:01:48.619> after<00:01:49.619> that<00:01:50.250> you<00:01:50.700> want

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
this does not matter after that you want

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.370 
this does not matter after that you want
to<00:01:50.909> go<00:01:51.000> to<00:01:51.090> applications<00:01:51.659> and<00:01:51.810> gaming<00:01:52.079> that's

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
to go to applications and gaming that's
