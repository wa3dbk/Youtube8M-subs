00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:14.570
 the bible was and is a compass for me 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:16.670
 of orientation in life but also 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.530
 refuge at the same time I use the 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:21.020
 orientation because they are sources 

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:24.820
 the instrument is the inspiration 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:28.700
 through which to take elements 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:30.950
 important to follow to look for from 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:33.739
 then embody in the everyday refuge 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:35.420
 because in moments of despair it is that 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:37.100
 door that allows me to enter one 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:40.280
 room full of light in that room 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.940
 able to give me the right energy 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.059
 right strength 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:46.480
 the encouragement to continue 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:48.640
 especially in contexts the most 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.429
 laicized sometimes it is so 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:54.949
 bombarded with a whole series of 

00:00:51.429 --> 00:00:57.920
 temptations of how to say also divides of 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:01:00.019
 despondency which also raises the question 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.120
 if you are actually furrowing the 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:05.089
 right ground here then that open 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:08.540
 even so at home a page of 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:10.700
 that bible can be that strength 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.760
 that light that instead makes you stay 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.710
 straight in the in the track e 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.830
 a track that can really bring you 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:21.080
 far away I can't imagine 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:24.000
 my existence 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:26.510
 without this source of despair without it 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.509
 this object apparently so 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:32.790
 small pavilion a1 in the bag really 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:36.600
 microscopic but why all my life 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.790
 was experienced in an attempt to di 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.869
 live daily 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.520
 that teaching not always 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.380
 probably there are indeed 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.970
 managed to but the intention was 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.970
 always that the bible for me is a bit 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.549
 like a mother from whom I can 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:54.590
 take tenderness and inspiration 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.590
 support at the same time
