00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
tightly compact obviously since it's

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.380 
tightly compact obviously since it's
indoors<00:00:49.410> and<00:00:49.680> it<00:00:50.100> winds<00:00:50.340> all<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.820> way<00:00:50.940> around

itself it's almost a tamer version of
flight<00:00:54.809> of<00:00:54.840> fear<00:00:55.440> because<00:00:56.039> it<00:00:56.190> doesn't<00:00:56.520> go

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
flight of fear because it doesn't go

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.220

upside-down<00:00:56.969> it's<00:00:57.360> more<00:00:57.539> family<00:00:57.780> based

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
upside-down it's more family based

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.200 
upside-down it's more family based
however<00:00:58.710> it<00:00:59.070> really<00:00:59.340> does<00:00:59.520> wrap<00:00:59.789> around

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
however it really does wrap around

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.599 
however it really does wrap around
itself<00:01:00.600> and<00:01:00.899> it's<00:01:01.170> an<00:01:01.320> OK<00:01:01.649> ride<00:01:01.859> number<00:01:02.430> nine

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
thing that isn't that great about it is

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.050 
thing that isn't that great about it is
that<00:01:40.049> that<00:01:40.320> mid-course<00:01:41.040> brake<00:01:41.280> run<00:01:41.520> almost

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
that that mid-course brake run almost

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.780 
that that mid-course brake run almost
puts<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.689> ride<00:01:42.899> at<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.200> dead<00:01:43.590> stop<00:01:43.670> so<00:01:44.670> it

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
puts the ride at a dead stop so it

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.639
