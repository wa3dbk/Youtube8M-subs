familiarize yourself with how to fly the
galaxy<00:01:03.809> there<00:01:04.350> are<00:01:04.650> a<00:01:04.680> lot<00:01:05.189> of<00:01:05.220> different

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729

maneuvers<00:01:06.000> you<00:01:06.299> can<00:01:06.479> do<00:01:06.659> just<00:01:07.110> to<00:01:07.229> get<00:01:07.590> around

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:07.939 
maneuvers you can do just to get around

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:11.510 
maneuvers you can do just to get around
like<00:01:08.939> juking<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:09.840> boosting<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:11.340> two

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
like juking and boosting the two

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.310 
like juking and boosting the two
maneuvers<00:01:12.000> though<00:01:12.180> that<00:01:12.420> I<00:01:12.570> am<00:01:12.990> going<00:01:13.229> to

maneuvers though that I am going to

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.740 
maneuvers though that I am going to
recommend<00:01:13.590> that<00:01:13.799> you<00:01:13.979> really<00:01:14.369> master<00:01:14.909> are<00:01:15.150> the

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
recommend that you really master are the

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.020 
recommend that you really master are the
back<00:01:16.080> boost<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:16.979> circle<00:01:17.369> strafe<00:01:17.640> by

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
back boost and the circle strafe by

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.170 
back boost and the circle strafe by
holding<00:01:18.479> in<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.750> left<00:01:19.110> trigger<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:20.400> hitting

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
holding in the left trigger and hitting

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.820 
holding in the left trigger and hitting
the<00:01:21.299> boost<00:01:21.509> button<00:01:21.840> you<00:01:22.200> can<00:01:22.380> fly<00:01:22.560> backwards

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
the boost button you can fly backwards

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.859 
the boost button you can fly backwards
really<00:01:23.400> quickly<00:01:23.850> and<00:01:24.030> for<00:01:24.570> most<00:01:24.689> of<00:01:24.810> your

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
really quickly and for most of your

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.570 
really quickly and for most of your
enemies<00:01:25.140> that<00:01:25.320> means<00:01:25.470> you<00:01:25.560> can<00:01:25.740> fly<00:01:26.009> away<00:01:26.520> from

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
enemies that means you can fly away from

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.910 
enemies that means you can fly away from
them<00:01:26.909> as<00:01:27.090> fast<00:01:27.360> as<00:01:27.540> they<00:01:27.600> can<00:01:27.750> fly<00:01:28.110> at<00:01:28.380> you

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
them as fast as they can fly at you

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.560 
them as fast as they can fly at you
and<00:01:29.579> it<00:01:29.670> gives<00:01:29.850> you<00:01:29.939> a<00:01:29.970> pretty<00:01:30.240> stable

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
and it gives you a pretty stable

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.870 
and it gives you a pretty stable
platform<00:01:30.900> to<00:01:31.259> shoot<00:01:31.710> right<00:01:31.920> back<00:01:31.979> at<00:01:32.400> them<00:01:32.640> so

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
platform to shoot right back at them so

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.910 
platform to shoot right back at them so
using<00:01:33.659> this<00:01:33.750> technique<00:01:34.140> you<00:01:34.409> can<00:01:34.590> get<00:01:34.770> off<00:01:34.890> a

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
using this technique you can get off a

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.280 
using this technique you can get off a
ton<00:01:35.280> of<00:01:35.310> damage<00:01:35.610> onto<00:01:36.060> ships<00:01:36.329> and<00:01:36.900> as<00:01:37.110> long<00:01:37.259> as

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
ton of damage onto ships and as long as

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.080 
ton of damage onto ships and as long as
you<00:01:37.500> took<00:01:37.680> every<00:01:38.070> shot<00:01:38.310> that<00:01:38.340> comes<00:01:38.700> your<00:01:38.880> way

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
you took every shot that comes your way

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.450 
you took every shot that comes your way
I<00:01:39.479> it's<00:01:39.960> it's<00:01:40.259> a<00:01:40.320> pretty<00:01:40.530> safe<00:01:40.799> maneuver<00:01:41.369> as

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
I it's it's a pretty safe maneuver as

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.010 
I it's it's a pretty safe maneuver as
well<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.939> other<00:01:42.060> technique<00:01:42.450> that<00:01:42.479> you<00:01:42.689> really

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
well the other technique that you really

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.690 
well the other technique that you really
do<00:01:43.170> need<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.409> master<00:01:43.890> in<00:01:44.070> order<00:01:44.159> to<00:01:44.340> take<00:01:44.520> down

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
do need to master in order to take down

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.660 
do need to master in order to take down
the<00:01:44.880> game's<00:01:45.119> biggest<00:01:45.960> enemies<00:01:46.619> and<00:01:46.950> bosses<00:01:47.220> is

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
the game's biggest enemies and bosses is

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.880 
the game's biggest enemies and bosses is
the<00:01:47.880> circle<00:01:48.240> strafe<00:01:48.509> in<00:01:48.720> order<00:01:49.530> to<00:01:49.619> do<00:01:49.740> that

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
the circle strafe in order to do that

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.429 
the circle strafe in order to do that
you<00:01:50.250> just<00:01:50.280> need<00:01:50.729> to<00:01:51.210> hit<00:01:51.570> the<00:01:51.720> strafe<00:01:52.049> button

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
you just need to hit the strafe button

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.100 
you just need to hit the strafe button
and<00:01:52.619> keep<00:01:53.250> rotating<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:54.299> left<00:01:54.570> stick<00:01:54.840> in

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
and keep rotating the left stick in

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.020 
and keep rotating the left stick in
order<00:01:55.350> to<00:01:55.409> keep<00:01:55.530> yourself<00:01:55.680> going<00:01:56.280> around<00:01:56.820> the

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
order to keep yourself going around the

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.139 
order to keep yourself going around the
enemy<00:01:57.479> that<00:01:57.840> you<00:01:58.079> are<00:01:58.229> fighting<00:01:58.790> most<00:01:59.790> enemies

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
enemy that you are fighting most enemies

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.760 
enemy that you are fighting most enemies
are<00:02:00.270> gonna<00:02:00.329> be<00:02:00.540> pretty<00:02:00.750> good<00:02:00.990> at<00:02:01.229> leading<00:02:01.500> you

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
are gonna be pretty good at leading you

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.590 
are gonna be pretty good at leading you
with<00:02:01.920> their<00:02:02.070> shots<00:02:02.369> when<00:02:02.610> you're<00:02:02.729> strafing<00:02:03.180> so

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
with their shots when you're strafing so

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.149 
with their shots when you're strafing so
you're<00:02:04.020> gonna<00:02:04.140> need<00:02:04.229> to<00:02:04.380> hold<00:02:04.680> in<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:04.950> boost

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
you're gonna need to hold in the boost

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.010 
you're gonna need to hold in the boost
button<00:02:05.280> as<00:02:05.610> well<00:02:05.759> which<00:02:06.479> does<00:02:06.689> make<00:02:06.840> it<00:02:06.990> a

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
button as well which does make it a

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.510 
button as well which does make it a
little<00:02:07.140> bit<00:02:07.320> harder<00:02:07.560> to<00:02:07.590> aim<00:02:07.860> but<00:02:08.280> when<00:02:08.399> your

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
little bit harder to aim but when your

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.550 
little bit harder to aim but when your
circle<00:02:08.819> strafing<00:02:09.060> and<00:02:09.330> boosting<00:02:09.899> most<00:02:10.410> of

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
circle strafing and boosting most of

circle strafing and boosting most of
their<00:02:10.649> shots<00:02:10.890> are<00:02:11.009> going<00:02:11.129> to<00:02:11.190> miss<00:02:11.340> you<00:02:11.370> again

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
their shots are going to miss you again

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.650 
their shots are going to miss you again
you<00:02:12.000> will<00:02:12.180> need<00:02:12.569> to<00:02:12.690> Juke<00:02:12.930> from<00:02:13.200> time<00:02:13.410> to

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
you will need to Juke from time to

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.200 
you will need to Juke from time to
to<00:02:13.900> get<00:02:14.020> around<00:02:14.170> the<00:02:14.290> shots<00:02:14.500> that<00:02:14.710> they<00:02:14.830> lead

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
to get around the shots that they lead

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.940 
to get around the shots that they lead
correctly<00:02:16.210> but<00:02:16.540> by<00:02:16.780> circle<00:02:17.140> strafing<00:02:17.380> you're

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
correctly but by circle strafing you're

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.530 
correctly but by circle strafing you're
gonna<00:02:18.100> be<00:02:18.280> able<00:02:18.370> to<00:02:18.520> take<00:02:18.700> down<00:02:18.910> most<00:02:19.360> of<00:02:19.450> the

gonna be able to take down most of the

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.120 
gonna be able to take down most of the
game's<00:02:19.720> biggest<00:02:19.900> enemies<00:02:20.410> without<00:02:20.560> having<00:02:21.040> to

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
game's biggest enemies without having to

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:22.560 
game's biggest enemies without having to
worry<00:02:21.310> too<00:02:21.520> much<00:02:21.550> about<00:02:21.730> taking<00:02:22.270> a<00:02:22.360> single

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
worry too much about taking a single

shot off of them on a related note
another<00:02:24.700> thing<00:02:25.000> I<00:02:25.180> would<00:02:25.360> recommend

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
another thing I would recommend

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.570 
another thing I would recommend
definitely<00:02:25.840> keeping<00:02:26.500> in<00:02:26.590> mind<00:02:26.800> is<00:02:27.100> that<00:02:27.430> you

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
definitely keeping in mind is that you

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.640 
definitely keeping in mind is that you
need<00:02:27.610> to<00:02:27.850> pick<00:02:28.270> your<00:02:28.480> battles<00:02:28.630> wisely

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
need to pick your battles wisely

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.130 
need to pick your battles wisely
just<00:02:30.190> because<00:02:30.430> an<00:02:30.550> enemy<00:02:30.880> is<00:02:31.090> bigger<00:02:31.690> than<00:02:32.020> the

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
just because an enemy is bigger than the

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.420 
just because an enemy is bigger than the
other<00:02:32.290> enemies<00:02:32.470> on<00:02:32.770> the<00:02:32.830> screen<00:02:32.950> doesn't

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
other enemies on the screen doesn't

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.130 
other enemies on the screen doesn't
necessarily<00:02:33.940> mean<00:02:34.090> he's<00:02:34.300> the<00:02:34.480> most<00:02:34.630> dangerous

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
necessarily mean he's the most dangerous

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.410 
necessarily mean he's the most dangerous
once<00:02:35.650> you<00:02:35.800> can<00:02:36.070> master<00:02:36.550> the<00:02:36.760> circle<00:02:37.240> strafing

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
once you can master the circle strafing

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:38.910 
once you can master the circle strafing
technique<00:02:37.930> you<00:02:38.200> can<00:02:38.350> take<00:02:38.500> out<00:02:38.680> bigger

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
technique you can take out bigger

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.220 
technique you can take out bigger
enemies<00:02:39.370> like<00:02:39.640> the<00:02:39.820> Raider<00:02:40.120> rhinos<00:02:40.690> without

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
enemies like the Raider rhinos without

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.550 
enemies like the Raider rhinos without
really<00:02:41.860> much<00:02:42.160> danger<00:02:42.700> at<00:02:42.820> all<00:02:43.560> meanwhile

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
really much danger at all meanwhile

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.370 
really much danger at all meanwhile
smaller<00:02:45.040> ships<00:02:45.460> like<00:02:45.820> the<00:02:46.030> hyenas<00:02:46.690> with<00:02:46.990> their

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
smaller ships like the hyenas with their

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.040 
smaller ships like the hyenas with their
shotgun<00:02:48.250> bursts<00:02:48.850> are<00:02:49.060> really<00:02:49.450> really<00:02:49.750> fast

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
shotgun bursts are really really fast

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.770 
shotgun bursts are really really fast
and<00:02:50.260> really<00:02:50.320> deadly<00:02:51.070> they<00:02:51.820> can<00:02:52.000> swarm<00:02:52.300> you<00:02:52.450> and

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
and really deadly they can swarm you and

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.480 
and really deadly they can swarm you and
take<00:02:52.990> out<00:02:53.140> your<00:02:53.260> shields<00:02:53.770> and<00:02:53.920> start<00:02:54.310> damaging

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:54.490 
take out your shields and start damaging

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:56.910 
take out your shields and start damaging
your<00:02:54.820> hull<00:02:55.000> faster<00:02:55.630> than<00:02:55.840> you<00:02:56.260> will<00:02:56.590> know<00:02:56.740> how

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
your hull faster than you will know how

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.010 
your hull faster than you will know how
to<00:02:56.950> react<00:02:57.340> to<00:02:57.370> them<00:02:57.730> bigger<00:02:58.090> ships<00:02:58.420> also<00:02:58.840> give

00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.020 
to react to them bigger ships also give

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.320 
to react to them bigger ships also give
you<00:02:59.140> way<00:02:59.410> more<00:02:59.440> Salvage<00:03:00.370> than<00:03:00.640> smaller<00:03:00.970> ships

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
you way more Salvage than smaller ships

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.930 
you way more Salvage than smaller ships
so<00:03:01.690> whenever<00:03:02.290> you<00:03:02.470> can<00:03:02.740> I<00:03:03.010> always<00:03:03.400> try<00:03:03.910> to

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
so whenever you can I always try to

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.170 
so whenever you can I always try to
sneak<00:03:04.510> by<00:03:04.780> the<00:03:04.840> groups<00:03:05.740> of<00:03:05.980> smaller<00:03:06.490> ships<00:03:06.910> and

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
sneak by the groups of smaller ships and

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.350 
sneak by the groups of smaller ships and
try<00:03:07.720> and<00:03:07.840> focus<00:03:08.020> most<00:03:08.440> of<00:03:08.590> my<00:03:08.740> energy<00:03:08.950> on<00:03:09.400> the

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
try and focus most of my energy on the

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.600 
try and focus most of my energy on the
big<00:03:10.960> ships<00:03:11.260> that<00:03:11.500> are<00:03:11.560> flying<00:03:12.130> around<00:03:12.280> by

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
big ships that are flying around by

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.430 
big ships that are flying around by
themselves<00:03:13.210> another<00:03:13.810> thing<00:03:14.080> you<00:03:14.260> need<00:03:14.290> to

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
themselves another thing you need to

there are a few ship upgrades that are
really<00:03:43.030> helpful<00:03:43.510> but<00:03:44.380> the<00:03:44.530> one<00:03:44.740> I<00:03:44.770> recommend

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
really helpful but the one I recommend

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.460 
really helpful but the one I recommend
purchasing<00:03:46.090> every<00:03:46.600> single<00:03:46.990> time<00:03:47.200> it's

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
purchasing every single time it's

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.230 
purchasing every single time it's
available<00:03:47.650> to<00:03:48.040> you<00:03:48.070> is<00:03:48.400> the<00:03:48.880> shield

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:49.240 
available to you is the shield

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:52.320 
available to you is the shield
overcharge<00:03:50.050> it<00:03:50.709> only<00:03:50.860> cost<00:03:51.100> 150<00:03:51.820> Salvage

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:52.330 
overcharge it only cost 150 Salvage

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.270 
overcharge it only cost 150 Salvage
which<00:03:52.630> isn't<00:03:52.930> very<00:03:53.200> much<00:03:53.650> compared<00:03:54.100> to<00:03:54.130> some

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
which isn't very much compared to some

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.830 
which isn't very much compared to some
of<00:03:54.370> the<00:03:54.430> other<00:03:54.580> upgrades<00:03:54.970> in<00:03:55.090> the<00:03:55.150> game<00:03:55.300> it

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
of the other upgrades in the game it

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.050 
of the other upgrades in the game it
gives<00:03:56.050> you<00:03:56.170> an<00:03:56.350> extra<00:03:56.890> point<00:03:57.130> of<00:03:57.459> shields

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
gives you an extra point of shields

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.690 
gives you an extra point of shields
which<00:03:58.480> lasts<00:03:59.050> as<00:03:59.770> long<00:03:59.830> as<00:04:00.190> you<00:04:00.280> can<00:04:00.459> keep<00:04:00.670> your

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
which lasts as long as you can keep your

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.810 
which lasts as long as you can keep your
shields<00:04:01.360> from<00:04:01.630> going<00:04:01.930> completely<00:04:02.080> down<00:04:02.820> which

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:03.820 
shields from going completely down which

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:05.880

and then fly away from a fight and just

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.390 
and then fly away from a fight and just
wait<00:04:07.959> for<00:04:07.990> your<00:04:08.290> shields<00:04:08.620> to<00:04:08.709> recharge<00:04:09.070> back

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
wait for your shields to recharge back

wait for your shields to recharge back
up<00:04:09.640> to<00:04:09.820> three<00:04:10.120> what's<00:04:10.510> really<00:04:10.720> great<00:04:10.840> is<00:04:10.990> that

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:11.020 
up to three what's really great is that

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:13.110 
up to three what's really great is that
you<00:04:11.170> can<00:04:11.320> actually<00:04:11.530> stack<00:04:12.190> this<00:04:12.459> upgrade<00:04:12.880> two

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
you can actually stack this upgrade two

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.240 
you can actually stack this upgrade two
times<00:04:13.390> giving<00:04:13.810> yourself<00:04:14.200> essentially<00:04:14.890> four

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
times giving yourself essentially four

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:18.150 
times giving yourself essentially four
shield<00:04:15.640> points<00:04:15.930> and<00:04:16.930> if<00:04:17.470> you<00:04:17.590> can<00:04:17.739> manage<00:04:17.859> to

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
shield points and if you can manage to

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.860 
shield points and if you can manage to
do<00:04:18.310> that<00:04:18.489> crashes<00:04:18.910> inventories<00:04:19.600> is

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
do that crashes inventories is

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:21.539 
do that crashes inventories is
randomized<00:04:20.410> every<00:04:20.650> time<00:04:20.830> but<00:04:21.130> if<00:04:21.310> you<00:04:21.400> get

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:21.549 
randomized every time but if you get

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:23.460 
randomized every time but if you get
lucky<00:04:21.700> and<00:04:22.060> you<00:04:22.120> can<00:04:22.630> purchase<00:04:22.810> this<00:04:23.080> upgrade

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
lucky and you can purchase this upgrade

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:26.000 
lucky and you can purchase this upgrade
twice<00:04:23.740> then<00:04:24.280> you're<00:04:24.550> just<00:04:24.850> going<00:04:24.970> to<00:04:25.000> be<00:04:25.180> a<00:04:25.419> jug

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
twice then you're just going to be a jug

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:29.420 
twice then you're just going to be a jug
it<00:04:26.190> is<00:04:26.460> it<00:04:26.790> is<00:04:26.970> so<00:04:27.450> so<00:04:27.810> helpful<00:04:28.220> most<00:04:29.220> of<00:04:29.340> the

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
it is it is so so helpful most of the

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:30.680 
it is it is so so helpful most of the
times<00:04:29.640> that<00:04:29.730> I<00:04:29.850> cleared<00:04:30.150> a<00:04:30.270> really<00:04:30.480> difficult

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
times that I cleared a really difficult

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:33.680 
times that I cleared a really difficult
season<00:04:31.350> was<00:04:32.070> because<00:04:32.400> I<00:04:32.430> lucked<00:04:32.910> out<00:04:33.030> and<00:04:33.090> had

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
season was because I lucked out and had

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.450 
season was because I lucked out and had
four<00:04:33.930> points<00:04:34.230> of<00:04:34.290> shields<00:04:34.680> which<00:04:34.860> makes<00:04:35.250> you

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
four points of shields which makes you

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.400 
four points of shields which makes you
just<00:04:35.820> a<00:04:35.970> tank<00:04:36.210> out<00:04:36.450> there<00:04:36.690> the<00:04:36.960> best<00:04:37.140> laser

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.410 
just a tank out there the best laser

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.590 
just a tank out there the best laser
upgrades<00:04:37.980> for<00:04:38.250> you<00:04:38.370> is<00:04:38.640> gonna<00:04:38.910> differ<00:04:39.210> based

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
on your style of play for my money I

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.710 
on your style of play for my money I
really<00:04:43.290> like<00:04:43.470> huge<00:04:44.010> blasts<00:04:44.400> it<00:04:45.180> slows<00:04:45.510> down

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 
really like huge blasts it slows down

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.270 
really like huge blasts it slows down
your<00:04:45.840> projectiles<00:04:46.440> pretty<00:04:46.680> significantly

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
your projectiles pretty significantly

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.520 
your projectiles pretty significantly
but<00:04:48.240> it<00:04:48.360> doubles<00:04:48.750> the<00:04:48.900> damage<00:04:49.020> that<00:04:49.260> they<00:04:49.470> do

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
but it doubles the damage that they do

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.320 
but it doubles the damage that they do
which<00:04:49.920> helps<00:04:50.400> you<00:04:50.520> tear<00:04:50.730> through<00:04:50.940> the<00:04:51.120> game's

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
which helps you tear through the game's
