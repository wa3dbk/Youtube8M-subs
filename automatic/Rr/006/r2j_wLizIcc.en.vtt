00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 well found in the preparation section 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.899
 of basic never pass me 3 minutes today 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.300
 we will see together how to prepare a 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.519
 very famous sauce based on for fear 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.889
 the green sauce is precisely that ideal 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.170
 as an accompaniment to carli and therefore 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.810
 I want to convince myself that he prepares to 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.210
 home knows everything and if it is convenient 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.039
 not just economically because yes 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.480
 always save some money but 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.250
 also appropriate for our health 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.840
 because we choose which ones 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.529
 ingredients add which instead 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.360
 avoid in this specific case the 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.790
 green sauce I 'll show you that yes 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.420
 prepare in a very simple raspberry from 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.739
 to achieve 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.739
 let us see together what we need 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:46.500
 prepare the green sauce we need 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.030
 about 80 grams of fresh parsley already 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.840
 clean 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:56.219
 then again 50 grams of stale bread 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:01:00.149
 then cut into brocchi then two gherkins 30 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:02.550
 about grams of capers in vinegar a 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.159
 hard boiled egg salt clearly 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.490
 indispensable then we still have 30 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:12.720
 grams of green olives 2 anchovies if you 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:17.640
 like and accept just about enough 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.570
 100 millimeters first we have 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.270
 put in 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:24.750
 let my bread stale than the vinegar 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:27.270
 we have well squeezed net yu 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:31.250
 vice we've already put a little 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:33.210
 parsley and I use this mini robot 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.729
 simply to avoid doing 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.829
 disperse the ingredients because they are 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.650
 we used the big one the robot 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:43.079
 pretty much what would happen 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.479
 a kind of di would be created 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:48.259
 pasta and this pasta would ask me 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.729
 we want a lot of oil instead 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:52.950
 then use the organ carefully 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.860
 we put in a small glass e 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.479
 then you will see that everything does not require 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.770
 so much oil 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:05.100
 now in this audition we put a little 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:07.170
 We pressed hard for the egg 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.940
 clearly for 8 minutes starting from 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.500
 position 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:17.310
 today we put in 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:20.010
 a bit of univet then a jury again 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:23.220
 this is optional I like soap 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:26.750
 the anchovy is a little strong so I will 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:29.250
 I always add it, I have proposed to you 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.380
 these particular this particular 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.540
 combination of ingredients but if not there 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:37.410
 like you can replace I know maybe 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:39.600
 capers with the with the other 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.550
 two of the ones I like the most 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.890
 we also put the cipriani and not 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:48.989
 let's break with love 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:51.650
 we also put some bread soaked in 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:56.520
 vinegar because this sauce is pretty 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:58.709
 piquant I always abound with vinegar 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:03.000
 because I like it in short, my taste 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:05.370
 some staff replace the vinegar or 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.200
 a part of vinegar with a part of 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:11.670
 milk to make it a little more delicate 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:19.519
 now let's put a lot of parsley 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:19.519
 above and we die is fine 

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:26.720
 after a few smoothies you see this 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.390
 the result 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:33.320
 if it seems too mushy you can 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:39.200
 add a little bit directly here 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:42.320
 of oil near us at a time so but 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:46.910
 you can also add some vinegar e 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:49.430
 I add it because I like it and 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:52.600
 we always buy until we get one 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.600
 desired consistency 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:59.690
 see I poured the sauce from the 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.760
 little bowl in the bowl and this is the 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:04.040
 texture that I like best is 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:06.170
 offered then the salt the pepper we do not put 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.060
 in the end if I like it you can even 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:09.710
 add with the clove of garlic and with 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:12.050
 laurel along with all other objects 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:15.260
 I particularly love it then published 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:17.239
 from the robot hodge added another 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.350
 some of the other ingredients of monet 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:20.480
 so at this point 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:26.240
 we proceed in this episodic way true 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:29.000
 everything and this is our green sauce 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:35.120
 now we can add some oil 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:37.580
 if we want it more liquid so in everything 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:40.580
 here I put three tablespoons of oil with 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:42.500
 the last one I added very well into 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:45.110
 go dates before or not salted I do not have 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:49.400
 searched from this building and I advise 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:53.900
 to make it at the end then salt is a bit of 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:57.100
 perfect pepper and now we mix oe 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:57.100
 let's go straight up 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:02.570
 here after a few smoothies in ours 

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:05.090
 would at least be ready immediately if not 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:06.500
 you consume it immediately you can keep in 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:09.110
 refrigerator inside a 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:12.289
 airtight container like this ad 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:14.389
 example I recommend you cover it well with 

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:17.750
 the oil is so as to avoid the formation 

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:20.300
 of molds so it will last in the fridge for 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:22.520
 a few weeks or you can 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:23.930
 even dismiss her in the latter 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:25.370
 samples I recommend passing it 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:27.710
 inside the containers for the 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:29.810
 ice with it also puts the function 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:31.639
 ready I hope my sauce is real 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:34.720
 together and see you soon 

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:34.720
 my next video 7
