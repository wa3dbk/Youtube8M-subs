00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.130
 now 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:53.600
 we will not put a homemade spice 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:55.910

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:36.970
 the fire but I stopped cooking and went 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:41.420
 In battle, keep cooking. 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:47.800

 requests from people who buy the 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.910

 who bought and those who come down come 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:17.209
 copeland cas in duros I met here 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:20.180
 for example he cooks at the pension was 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:21.829
 super hard too tray you can 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.510
 see what's underneath 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:24.980
 usually you buy in large 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.810
 supermarkets 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:30.410
 Then you end up leaving there and you. 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:34.430

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.410
 pressure 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.850

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:47.720

 very boiled and not very hot you 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:55.310
 You can also do with the soft bug here.

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:02.180
