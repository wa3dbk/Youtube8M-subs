otherwise<00:00:26.039> it<00:00:26.250> dies<00:00:27.320> okay<00:00:28.320> so<00:00:28.380> let's<00:00:28.710> start

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
otherwise it dies okay so let's start

this<00:00:29.130> machine<00:00:30.500> now<00:00:31.500> because<00:00:31.890> red<00:00:32.520> zone<00:00:32.730> is

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
this machine now because red zone is

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.729 
this machine now because red zone is
really<00:00:33.120> so<00:00:33.360> slow<00:00:33.750> this<00:00:34.050> will<00:00:34.260> take<00:00:34.440> some<00:00:34.500> time

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739

then<00:01:31.430> this<00:01:32.090> line<00:01:32.420> will<00:01:32.690> turn<00:01:32.900> on<00:01:33.170> and<00:01:33.440> the

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
then this line will turn on and the

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.120 
then this line will turn on and the
newly<00:01:34.280> computed<00:01:34.910> status<00:01:35.330> will<00:01:36.140> be<00:01:36.350> stored<00:01:36.890> in

this<00:01:37.310> D<00:01:37.580> latch<00:01:37.759> here<00:01:38.150> I<00:01:38.330> made<00:01:39.229> it<00:01:39.259> this<00:01:39.500> way<00:01:39.560> so

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:39.800 
this D latch here I made it this way so

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.060 
this D latch here I made it this way so
that<00:01:40.070> when<00:01:40.729> a<00:01:41.000> cell<00:01:41.360> gets<00:01:41.570> a<00:01:41.690> new<00:01:41.840> status<00:01:42.290> it

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
that when a cell gets a new status it

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:44.950 
that when a cell gets a new status it
doesn't<00:01:43.550> confuse<00:01:43.970> the<00:01:44.390> cells<00:01:44.750> that<00:01:44.899> are

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
doesn't confuse the cells that are

line I've made two of these to save some
wiring<00:02:26.120> which<00:02:26.750> also<00:02:26.990> saves<00:02:27.350> time<00:02:27.710> but<00:02:28.160> still

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
wiring which also saves time but still

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.680 
wiring which also saves time but still
every<00:02:28.730> cell<00:02:28.970> needs<00:02:29.330> 32<00:02:30.080> tix<00:02:30.380> which<00:02:31.270> makes<00:02:32.270> it<00:02:32.480> a

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
every cell needs 32 tix which makes it a

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.260 
every cell needs 32 tix which makes it a
total<00:02:33.260> of<00:02:33.560> two<00:02:33.890> minutes<00:02:34.250> computing<00:02:34.790> time<00:02:35.000> for

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
total of two minutes computing time for

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.440 
total of two minutes computing time for
each<00:02:35.420> step<00:02:35.810> give<00:02:36.350> or<00:02:36.470> take<00:02:36.970> which<00:02:37.970> is<00:02:38.150> still<00:02:38.420> a

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
each step give or take which is still a

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.850 
each step give or take which is still a
lot<00:02:39.910> now<00:02:40.910> I<00:02:40.940> cheated<00:02:41.810> while<00:02:42.200> making<00:02:42.620> this

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
lot now I cheated while making this

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.670 
lot now I cheated while making this
machine<00:02:43.310> I<00:02:43.520> hacked<00:02:43.970> the<00:02:44.330> stuff<00:02:45.290> into<00:02:45.560> my

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
machine I hacked the stuff into my

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.040 
machine I hacked the stuff into my
invaded<00:02:46.250> I<00:02:46.460> I<00:02:46.790> don't<00:02:47.120> know<00:02:47.210> how<00:02:47.330> much<00:02:47.480> redstone

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050 
invaded I I don't know how much redstone

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:54.280 
invaded I I don't know how much redstone
i<00:02:48.200> put<00:02:48.410> but<00:02:48.620> it<00:02:48.740> should<00:02:48.950> be<00:02:49.150> above<00:02:50.150> 1000<00:02:53.290> now

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
i put but it should be above 1000 now

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.310 
i put but it should be above 1000 now
this<00:02:54.620> should<00:02:54.680> be<00:02:55.040> done<00:02:55.070> and<00:02:55.630> let's<00:02:56.630> see<00:02:56.960> the

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.320 
this should be done and let's see the

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.950 
this should be done and let's see the
result

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:00.960 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.240 

and<00:03:01.050> here<00:03:01.680> it<00:03:01.800> is

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
and here it is

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.740 
and here it is
I<00:03:03.370> hope<00:03:03.940> you<00:03:04.060> enjoyed<00:03:04.360> it<00:03:04.390> and<00:03:04.740> goodbye
