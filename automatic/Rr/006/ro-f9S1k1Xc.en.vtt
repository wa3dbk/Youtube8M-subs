 always depending on the situation 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.490
 this is how we work on more general ones 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:39.539
 legal duties related to health 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.600

 population screening 

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:54.240
 In addition, we have in Friesland 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.799
 deal with very specific risks such as 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.470
 possible calamities 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.700

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.739
 would rather be completely prevented 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.380
 that's why we put a lot of energy into it 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:25.110
 make risks clear so that we 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.420

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:35.280
 to do better and better 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:38.010
 but it doesn't end with much 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.600
 we work on it every day 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.600
