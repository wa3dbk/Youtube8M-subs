00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 the topic plus a little notebook nex 5 and 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.859
 pull the rudder talk 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.219
 so you want to check it 's just you will 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:13.679
 download zipped file by description 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:17.310
 Are you going to come and install this? 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:20.310
 he has the so-called aroma so he goes 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:23.400
 connect the game options there you configure it 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.260
 so I'll try to explain here is what it is 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:29.039
 Each of these options 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.980
 It gives the first thing you check this 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:34.920
 box that recognizes the rights of the 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.920
 developer so you can install the 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.840
 hell here in the first option and 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.030
 asks if you want all the 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.500
 nuclei work on the same frequency or 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.170
 each one work on own frequency 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.789
 So you select I tested the two 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.820
 sees no difference in performance and 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.960
 barber shop will not be at the discretion of 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.230
 each one 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.520
 the second option is to zoom it is 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.070
 it's you 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.500
 optimize the use of cpu you keep the 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.229
 system standard I've never read lets the 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.080
 selected by optimizing the temperature 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.750
 it allows you to let the air more 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.270
 then you have two options or you can 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.090
 leave the stock the standard that goes 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.549
 warm up a little and games in the 20 frames 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.100
 then you select which you want and there are 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:24.810
 which allows you to ask the speed 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:27.420
 maximum and of the cpu and goes up to 2,900 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.729
 with overclock I think it's too loud 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.220
 there goes the taste of each and goes to eat 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.829
 leaving the standard even two thousand and 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.020
 two hundred I think the max that works 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.820
 too well at this speed 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:43.530
 and here you can make a flight and then 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:46.469
 you can reduce the voltage I use 750 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.780
 law but there goes of the taste of each one 

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:51.090
 but I recommend leaving standard even 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:55.259
 it will not make so much difference in 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:57.869
 Sound is cut a little here in the page 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.619
 you can use a 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.340
 reading 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:04.380
 then default is c and f you most want 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.140
 recommends using the theft there that has 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.560
 then let him 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:13.110
 performs well with a consul 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:15.890
 then recommend to leave out and what 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:19.829
 you take in the block the default of nex 5 128 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:22.799
 the size of the buff is either on it 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:24.690
 recommends using 256 so I also leave the 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:26.910
 value recommended by the developer of the 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.459
 canyon works fine here the option 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.410
 who leaves since it is interesting that he 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:34.319
 provides resources for you to ascend to screen 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:36.599
 using gestures for example you parade 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:38.940
 Your finger is brown from the bottom up to 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:40.860
 down to the right or 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.130
 tap twice to ascend the screen 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.810
 when it's locked in g2 style 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:49.079
 so you choose the option and you want 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.430
 I like that here is the traditional 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:53.069
 hit twice 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.950
 or slide and on that screen that you 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:57.750
 and choose which side you want to make a 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.180
 gesture up to the bottom left 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:03.030
 right or gestures you hit twice 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:06.000
 and that's what I think is best here 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:08.700
 but then you choose that low option 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.569
 and the option to vibrate when it recognizes 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:14.579
 this gesture that you made the choice of you 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:16.849
 disable this gesture with you blocks 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:20.579
 using the google button is the power button 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:22.530
 and here the last one I find interesting that 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:26.370
 it allows a gesture only on the part of 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:28.889
 down the screen so that it will not 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.660
 being counted in the pocket for example 

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:32.130
 so I think it's cool to let this 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:36.239
 option there 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:39.000
 and that is to set the time the sensor 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:41.700
 will stay connected to recognize gestures 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.260
 on the screen is you can is to always leave 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.570
 connected to the sensor but will increase 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.350
 little with the sound a standard the law to 15 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:49.290
 minutes 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:53.070
 I think it works well, same value and 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:56.220
 here you choose the eight slick you 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:04:00.090
 slide your finger on the navigation bar and 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:02.130
 then he goes off screen so I do not like 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.049
 feature because you leave it disabled but you 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:06.600
 you want, you choose which side 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:09.570
 you make a gesture and that other 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:11.970
 for example you are speeding up the 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:14.220
 charge via USB so it's pretty cool 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:16.350
 If you want it to load faster 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.449
 that you connect to the computer 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:23.190
 example has another interesting option 

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:25.289
 here it is to adjust the screen colors 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:27.210
 nex 5 it has a warmer white 

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:29.190
 that white half yellowish if you 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:31.470
 like a cooler white as the g2 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:34.770
 so only you check this box I think 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:36.870
 interesting here has options for 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:39.360
 reduce the brightness of the screen then 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:41.160
 I managed to mark this box and go - 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.949
 still consult in the dark for 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:47.400
 example is cumbersome vision and having 

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:50.940
 options for you to use the manager 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:53.070
 which is the morning rather than the 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:56.130
 which is the default of nex 5 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:58.560
 confirm that box there you choose 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:01.830
 You all come here in stoles. 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:04.160
 He is going to install the suit is very fast. 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:04.160
 process 

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:10.080
 when you finish click next on 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:13.229
 finish and hence she finishes recommending 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:15.990
 do wipe cash and delphi than here for 

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:18.389
 clear any setting has 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:21.180
 I want to keep you're using 

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:22.740
 It's just you start I jumped here 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:24.720
 takes a while since olimpia cash 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:27.930
 Tom has to wait to carry everything. 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:30.270
 I recommend using this app here 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:32.490
 It's the trio. That's where the link is. 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:34.250
 description you want to download and here 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:37.770
 you can use some settings 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:42.240
 interesting but you can set the 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:44.550
 Use the cpu gpu option besides load 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:47.639
 quick usb you chose or not to 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:50.520
 installation here also also the control 

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:52.259
 of the voltage if it has reduced and 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:53.550
 bit slow you can change here in the 

00:05:52.259 --> 00:05:55.349
 program 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:59.300
 and here you can set the speed 

00:05:55.349 --> 00:06:01.889
 minimum and maximum by default it leaves 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:03.820
 1,267 min I do not like I prefer 

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:05.890
 leave 300 

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:10.270
 I do not come here checked the option 

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:11.830
 here lock the frequency only activate from there 

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:12.430
 you define what you feel better 

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:14.640
 your 

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:18.670
 and here you can choose the governor 

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:20.590
 of the gpu here in case I prefer to use the 

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:22.720
 elemental that I find most interesting 

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:25.480
 that the interactive with the pattern nex-5 think 

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:27.430
 what is called it becomes more fluid with 

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:28.300
 this governor even more the question of 

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:30.640
 taste 

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:35.290
 I think it's very cool, it's good. 

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:38.500
 interesting and this here is the mold trash 

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:40.180
 such a link in the description is not required 

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:42.430
 have for external use 

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:45.220
 but then you can have some controls 

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:47.830
 to feel that you are coming back to remember 

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:49.330
 This brand here is for him. 

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:50.620
 select those options when you 

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:52.720
 system boot 

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:56.200
 if you do not dial then you restart 

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:58.660
 he will reject what you scored there and 

00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:00.100
 you do not need to have the app you 

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:01.300
 Can I come here at home? I 'm using the 

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:03.010
 cemig 11 

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:05.770
 but if you want it is compatible with other 

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:08.440
 roms then here on the part of the processor 

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:11.360
 you can select and is the governor of 

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:13.819
 maximum and minimum state of gpu also 

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:16.009
 so it's very interesting and this is the 

00:07:13.819 --> 00:07:18.889
 metal with you saw there is compatible 

00:07:16.009 --> 00:07:21.710
 with acm 11 is compatible with the other 11 

00:07:18.889 --> 00:07:24.680
 sp and it is also compatible with rice 

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:26.960
 touch nex 5 and only warning that in russia 

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:29.479
 in 2011 you have to use the car version 

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:32.090
 of the channel that is cf 

00:07:29.479 --> 00:07:34.580
 on the streets asp you will use the version and 

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:36.620
 if pedro exchange and on street stock you 

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:38.780
 uses the stock version of the barrel 

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:41.030
 so this is it people if you liked it 

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:42.020
 the elemental that the video does not forget that 

00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:44.060
 I did not like 

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:46.400
 if you are not writing to accompany 

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:48.110
 other nex-5 videos just click the button 

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:50.090
 write this there, that 's it, I'll go 

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:52.509
 staying here until the next 

00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:52.509
 said
