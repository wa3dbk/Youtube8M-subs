00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
that I just had my MIDI cable in the

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:31.939 
that I just had my MIDI cable in the
wrong<00:00:30.660> place<00:00:30.929> on<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.199> jam<00:00:31.349> people<00:00:31.650> want<00:00:31.769> good

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
wrong place on the jam people want good

times not at all so I'm gonna go ahead
and<00:00:36.510> show<00:00:37.260> you<00:00:37.320> how<00:00:37.469> this<00:00:37.590> is<00:00:37.739> connected<00:00:38.030> let's

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
and show you how this is connected let's

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:49.910 
and show you how this is connected let's
do<00:00:39.329> it

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.270 

all<00:00:50.920> right<00:00:51.039> it's<00:00:52.230> it's<00:00:53.230> so<00:00:53.530> much<00:00:53.649> easier<00:00:53.680> than

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:54.280 
all right it's it's so much easier than

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.160 
all right it's it's so much easier than
I<00:00:54.399> thought<00:00:54.430> it<00:00:54.640> was<00:00:54.850> and<00:00:55.149> way<00:00:55.510> easier<00:00:55.539> than

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 
I thought it was and way easier than

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.079 
I thought it was and way easier than
trying<00:00:56.500> to<00:00:56.620> follow<00:00:56.920> the<00:00:57.159> manuals<00:00:57.640> because<00:00:57.820> the

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:58.089 
trying to follow the manuals because the

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:00.959 
trying to follow the manuals because the
manuals<00:00:58.420> were<00:00:58.600> really<00:00:59.019> confusing<00:00:59.730> so<00:01:00.730> what

00:01:00.959 --> 00:01:00.969 
manuals were really confusing so what

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:06.830 
manuals were really confusing so what
you<00:01:01.059> do<00:01:01.589> go<00:01:02.589> over<00:01:02.769> here<00:01:03.239> we<00:01:04.239> need<00:01:04.390> to<00:01:04.479> go<00:01:04.600> into

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.520 

blah<00:01:07.840> blah<00:01:08.110> blah<00:01:08.320> let's<00:01:09.220> roll<00:01:09.430> it<00:01:09.460> on<00:01:09.670> forward

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
blah blah blah let's roll it on forward

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:17.550 
blah blah blah let's roll it on forward
closed<00:01:11.970> MIDI<00:01:14.399> enter<00:01:15.600> first<00:01:16.600> thing<00:01:16.810> set<00:01:17.380> it<00:01:17.470> to

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 
closed MIDI enter first thing set it to

MIDI channel one program change in turn

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:24.779 
MIDI channel one program change in turn
that<00:01:22.270> off<00:01:22.509> because<00:01:23.009> we're<00:01:24.009> going<00:01:24.220> MIDI<00:01:24.550> out

00:01:24.779 --> 00:01:24.789 
that off because we're going MIDI out

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:28.380 
that off because we're going MIDI out
from<00:01:25.390> the<00:01:25.479> G<00:01:25.659> system<00:01:26.110> to<00:01:26.319> the<00:01:26.440> in<00:01:26.679> of<00:01:27.100> the<00:01:27.550> JMP

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
from the G system to the in of the JMP

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.600 
from the G system to the in of the JMP
one<00:01:28.750> and<00:01:29.050> not<00:01:29.590> the<00:01:29.740> other<00:01:29.770> way<00:01:30.009> around<00:01:30.159> so<00:01:30.429> we

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
one and not the other way around so we

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.910 
one and not the other way around so we
don't<00:01:30.759> have<00:01:30.880> incoming<00:01:31.360> program<00:01:31.810> changes<00:01:32.200> just

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
don't have incoming program changes just

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.639 
don't have incoming program changes just
outgoing<00:01:33.280> now<00:01:34.119> for<00:01:34.300> the<00:01:34.360> outgoing<00:01:34.649> switch

00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:35.649 
outgoing now for the outgoing switch

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:39.109 
outgoing now for the outgoing switch
that<00:01:35.830> to<00:01:36.039> on<00:01:36.250> map<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.990> that<00:01:38.679> allows<00:01:38.890> you<00:01:39.069> to

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
that to on map and that allows you to

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.149 
that to on map and that allows you to
setup<00:01:40.119> the<00:01:40.300> mini-map<00:01:40.630> and<00:01:40.929> here<00:01:41.649> is<00:01:41.800> what<00:01:42.069> the

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:42.159 
setup the mini-map and here is what the

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:46.100 
setup the mini-map and here is what the
mini-map<00:01:42.460> looks<00:01:42.729> like<00:01:42.909> in<00:01:43.780> the<00:01:44.020> G<00:01:44.170> system<00:01:44.560> now

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
mini-map looks like in the G system now

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.600 
mini-map looks like in the G system now
there<00:01:47.110> are<00:01:47.229> a<00:01:47.259> little<00:01:47.409> bit<00:01:47.530> offset<00:01:47.770> only

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
there are a little bit offset only

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.559 
there are a little bit offset only
because<00:01:48.970> on<00:01:49.450> the<00:01:50.259> G<00:01:50.409> system<00:01:51.090> number<00:01:52.090> one<00:01:52.119> means

00:01:52.559 --> 00:01:52.569 
because on the G system number one means

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:55.499 
because on the G system number one means
one<00:01:52.959> on<00:01:53.319> the<00:01:54.160> JMP<00:01:54.489> one<00:01:54.819> because<00:01:55.300> they're

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:55.509 
one on the JMP one because they're

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:57.479 
one on the JMP one because they're
presets<00:01:56.020> for<00:01:56.200> some<00:01:56.379> stupid<00:01:56.619> reason<00:01:56.739> start<00:01:57.310> at

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:57.489 
presets for some stupid reason start at

00:01:57.489 --> 00:02:01.260 
presets for some stupid reason start at
zero<00:01:57.879> zero<00:01:57.940> and<00:01:58.509> go<00:01:59.110> to<00:01:59.170> 99<00:01:59.679> for<00:01:59.979> the<00:02:00.039> 100<00:02:00.429> 100

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
zero zero and go to 99 for the 100 100

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.199 
zero zero and go to 99 for the 100 100
presets<00:02:01.599> you've<00:02:02.530> got<00:02:02.770> to<00:02:02.950> go<00:02:03.099> one<00:02:03.369> higher<00:02:03.640> so<00:02:04.179> I

00:02:04.199 --> 00:02:04.209 
presets you've got to go one higher so I

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:08.520 
presets you've got to go one higher so I
want<00:02:04.750> preset<00:02:05.500> 11<00:02:06.179> which<00:02:07.179> is<00:02:07.259> what<00:02:08.259> we<00:02:08.349> have

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
want preset 11 which is what we have

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:09.830 
want preset 11 which is what we have
over<00:02:08.770> here

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
over here

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
over here
so<00:02:10.840> I<00:02:10.869> set<00:02:12.300> 0<00:02:13.300> 0<00:02:13.510> 1<00:02:13.690> which<00:02:13.870> is<00:02:14.050> the<00:02:14.170> preset<00:02:14.560> on

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
so I set 0 0 1 which is the preset on

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.600 
so I set 0 0 1 which is the preset on
the<00:02:15.280> G<00:02:15.430> system<00:02:15.959> 212<00:02:16.959> now<00:02:17.739> that's<00:02:17.980> gonna<00:02:18.400> give

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
the G system 212 now that's gonna give

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.460 
the G system 212 now that's gonna give
me<00:02:18.640> 11<00:02:19.150> over<00:02:19.629> on<00:02:19.750> the<00:02:19.930> JMP<00:02:20.530> 1<00:02:21.150> and<00:02:22.230> since<00:02:23.230> this

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
me 11 over on the JMP 1 and since this

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.059 
me 11 over on the JMP 1 and since this
is<00:02:23.650> uh<00:02:24.750> no<00:02:25.750> do<00:02:25.900> anything<00:02:26.170> with<00:02:26.319> this<00:02:26.440> don't<00:02:26.980> do
