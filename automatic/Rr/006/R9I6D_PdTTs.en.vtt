00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:13.420
On a hot, sunny morning in June 2010, 300
young humpback chub were released by fisheries

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:19.119
biologists into Shinumo Creek within the heart
of Grand Canyon National Park. For these small

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:25.030
fish, it was the final leg of a remarkable
journey. They had been captured the year before

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:29.939
as fingerlings in the Little Colorado River,
and had spent the winter growing and feeding

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:36.980
in hatchery pools. Their momentous final journey
began with a flight in the park helicopter

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:42.660
to a landing spot adjacent to Shinumo Creek.
After landing, they were quickly transferred

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.170
into buckets, acclimated to the creekís water,
and then allowed to swim free into their new

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:49.960
home.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.420
For National Park Service biologists, the
translocation of these humpback chub into

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.870
Shinumo Creek was but a single milestone in
a multi-year conservation experiment to establish

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:05.199
an aggregation, or small population, of the
Colorado Riverís most emblematic native fish

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:10.930
in a Grand Canyon tributary. The endangered
humpback chub were once one of the most abundant

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:18.310
fish in Grand Canyon. Only a few remnant populations
of humpback chub exist in the world; and today,

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:23.119
the largest population is found near the confluence
of the Colorado and the Little Colorado Rivers

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:26.369
in Grand Canyon.

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.499
In 2009, the National Park Service initiated
this important experiment for the conservation

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:36.570
of humpback chub, a large member of the minnow
family that is endemic to the Colorado River.

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.220
An endangered fish species such as humpback
chub that exists mostly in a single river

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:47.500
drainage is at risk: a catastrophic event
in that drainage could have devastating impacts

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:53.550
on the population downstream. Therefore, biologists
are exploring ways to increase the population

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:55.890
of humpback chub throughout its former range.

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.380
[Brian Healy] ìThe translocation of humpback
chub to Shinumo Creek will hopefully in the

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.850
future will provide us with some important
knowledge on how Ö to conserve the species

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.640
in Grand Canyon.î

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.900
Shinumo Creek is a small, clear stream that
joins the Colorado River deep in the heart

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:20.130
of Grand Canyon. Two species of native fish,
bluehead suckers and speckled dace, are found

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.940
in the stream, along with nonnative rainbow
trout that were stocked there in the 1930s.

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:31.890
A fifteen foot waterfall located just above
the mouth of Shinumo Creek prevents nonnative

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.780
fish in the Colorado River from moving into
the stream, effectively isolating acceptable

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:42.460
humpback chub habitat. Fisheries biologists
chose Shinumo Creek for the first translocation

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:47.990
experiment based on the presence of this barrier
fall and the fact that Shinumo Creek has suitable

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:52.590
water chemistry and temperature for humpback
chub.

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:58.060
The 2010 release of humpback chub into Shinumo
Creek was the second of three planned translocations

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:05.000
to the stream. A multi-faceted monitoring
program is an essential part of this scientific

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.220
experiment. Twice per year, crews survey the
creek using established fisheries techniques.

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:19.010
[Melissa Trammell] ìAnd also hopefully get
a population estimate of what remains in the

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:26.040
creek by doing a full 2-pass mark recapture
estimate in the creek. So we took our hoop

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.770
nets, and we have the creek divided into 4
different reaches. And we set two reaches

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:35.880
on one day, and two reaches the next day,
and then we go back up and do it again. So

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:41.290
on the first pass, you collect all the fish,
[and [um] all the HBC are already PIT-tagged,

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:42.290
they come PIT-tagged from the hatchery where
they stayed over winter. And then [ah] Ö.EDIT

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:46.470
OUT] You estimate the population by looking
at the ratio of marked to unmarked fish in

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:47.670
your second pass.î

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:52.890
Each humpback chub released into Shinumo Creek
has a PIT tag, or microchip, in its abdomen

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:54.800
that uniquely identifies each fish.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:01.090
[Trammell] ìÖ.Another sampling device that
we installed in the creek is an actual antenna.

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:09.480
Itís just a Ö couple hundred meters above
the barrier falls. Its two PVC rectangular

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:15.661
blocks set down into the river, and it has
a remote reader that has a satellite uplink

00:04:15.661 --> 00:04:23.060
to it. And so, when a fish that has a little
PIT tag in it swims through the antenna, the

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.250
reader records thatÖî

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:30.479
During monitoring prior to the 2010 release,
biologist captured a number of humpback chub

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:33.289
that had been released in Shinumo Creek in
2009.

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:38.379
[Trammell] ìOh, the chub that we caught this
year were just wonderful. They just look great.

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:49.100
Theyíre fat and theyíre growing, and their
fins all look good.î

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:53.259
Biologists will continue to monitor the population
of humpback chub and other native fish in

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:59.349
Shinumo Creek in coming years to assess the
outcome of the translocations there.

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:05.259
These initial translocation efforts are considered
experimental. However, depending on the success

00:05:05.259 --> 00:05:10.150
in Shinumo Creek, future translocation efforts
may contribute to the National Park Serviceís

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:16.469
goal to restore native fish communities in
Grand Canyon. Translocations to tributaries

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:21.620
such as Shinumo Creek may result in improved
survival for juvenile humpback chub by providing

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:27.610
better rearing habitat than in the colder
Colorado River. This translocation of young

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:33.249
humpback chub to Shinumo Creek may itself
be a step in a larger journey for the speciesóone

00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:34.479
leading to recovery.
