I<00:03:28.260> would<00:03:28.440> look<00:03:28.560> at<00:03:28.739> severe<00:03:29.100> plus<00:03:29.430> 1.5<00:03:30.270> it's

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:31.020 
I would look at severe plus 1.5 it's

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:32.860 
I would look at severe plus 1.5 it's
about<00:03:31.080> the<00:03:31.260> best<00:03:31.410> option<00:03:31.890> there<00:03:32.070> is<00:03:32.190> out<00:03:32.400> there

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
about the best option there is out there

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.180 
about the best option there is out there
real<00:03:33.870> madrid<00:03:34.170> recently<00:03:34.680> there<00:03:34.890> Williams

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
real madrid recently there Williams

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.400 
real madrid recently there Williams
seems<00:03:35.400> to<00:03:35.489> be<00:03:35.580> by<00:03:35.760> the<00:03:35.820> one<00:03:36.209> goal<00:03:36.480> nothing<00:03:37.140> huge

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
seems to be by the one goal nothing huge

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.520 
seems to be by the one goal nothing huge
so<00:03:37.590> 1.5<00:03:37.890> looks<00:03:38.430> reasonable<00:03:38.970> it's<00:03:39.540> 1.85<00:03:40.320> with

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
so 1.5 looks reasonable it's 1.85 with

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:41.840 
so 1.5 looks reasonable it's 1.85 with
Pinnacle<00:03:40.890> if<00:03:41.010> that<00:03:41.130> goes<00:03:41.310> up<00:03:41.550> then<00:03:41.730> that

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
Pinnacle if that goes up then that

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.000 
Pinnacle if that goes up then that
becomes<00:03:42.060> a<00:03:42.209> real<00:03:42.360> option<00:03:42.570> i<00:03:42.810> think<00:03:43.019> all<00:03:43.830> right

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
becomes a real option i think all right

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.970 
becomes a real option i think all right
