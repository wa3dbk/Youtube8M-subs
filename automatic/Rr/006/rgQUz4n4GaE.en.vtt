00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
I guess one kind of high point out of

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.120 
I guess one kind of high point out of
the<00:03:44.310> whole<00:03:44.459> reboot<00:03:44.940> is<00:03:45.150> a<00:03:45.630> via<00:03:46.140> read<00:03:46.380> he<00:03:46.860> will

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
the whole reboot is a via read he will

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.810 
the whole reboot is a via read he will
still<00:03:47.489> be<00:03:47.730> on<00:03:47.970> the<00:03:48.209> whole<00:03:48.680> team<00:03:49.680> with<00:03:50.220> Sony<00:03:50.610> and

still be on the whole team with Sony and
Columbia<00:03:51.209> I<00:03:51.860> guess<00:03:52.860> I<00:03:53.130> don't<00:03:53.190> know<00:03:53.340> I<00:03:53.370> guess

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
Columbia I guess I don't know I guess

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.789 
Columbia I guess I don't know I guess
it's<00:03:53.790> some<00:03:53.970> sort<00:03:54.150> of<00:03:54.239> way<00:03:54.360> but<00:03:54.810> as<00:03:54.989> I<00:03:55.170> said<00:03:55.230> it's

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 
it's some sort of way but as I said it's

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:58.930 
it's some sort of way but as I said it's
gonna<00:03:56.130> be<00:03:56.220> a<00:03:56.340> loss<00:03:56.579> I<00:03:57.260> really<00:03:58.260> enjoyed<00:03:58.560> the

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
gonna be a loss I really enjoyed the

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:03.080 
gonna be a loss I really enjoyed the
trilogy<00:03:59.940> of<00:04:00.090> the<00:04:00.239> spider-man<00:04:00.540> series<00:04:00.840> and<00:04:02.090> who

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
trilogy of the spider-man series and who

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.030 
trilogy of the spider-man series and who
knows<00:04:03.299> what's<00:04:03.540> next<00:04:03.600> these<00:04:04.200> this<00:04:04.530> could<00:04:04.920> be<00:04:05.010> a

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
knows what's next these this could be a

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.009 
knows what's next these this could be a
huge<00:04:05.250> success<00:04:05.670> but<00:04:05.940> I<00:04:06.209> really<00:04:06.600> don't<00:04:06.690> like<00:04:06.870> the

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:07.019 
huge success but I really don't like the

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:08.780 
huge success but I really don't like the
whole<00:04:07.170> reboot<00:04:07.560> they've<00:04:07.890> done<00:04:08.100> it<00:04:08.190> with<00:04:08.220> Hulk

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
whole reboot they've done it with Hulk

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.729 
whole reboot they've done it with Hulk
twice<00:04:09.450> that<00:04:09.720> they<00:04:09.780> had<00:04:09.930> the<00:04:10.049> first<00:04:10.230> one<00:04:10.560> and

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
twice that they had the first one and

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:12.229 
twice that they had the first one and
then<00:04:10.829> they<00:04:10.980> had<00:04:11.130> the<00:04:11.310> Edward<00:04:11.670> Norton<00:04:12.030> one

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
then they had the Edward Norton one

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:14.630 
then they had the Edward Norton one
which<00:04:12.510> yeah<00:04:12.930> it<00:04:13.019> was<00:04:13.140> much<00:04:13.290> better<00:04:13.560> but<00:04:13.859> still

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 
which yeah it was much better but still

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.360 
which yeah it was much better but still
not<00:04:14.970> that<00:04:15.030> good<00:04:15.590> was<00:04:16.590> spider-man<00:04:16.919> though<00:04:17.190> like

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
not that good was spider-man though like

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.120 
not that good was spider-man though like
I<00:04:17.459> said<00:04:17.989> another<00:04:18.989> reason<00:04:19.380> that<00:04:19.410> Sony<00:04:19.739> also

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
I said another reason that Sony also

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.420 
I said another reason that Sony also
wanted<00:04:20.400> to<00:04:20.430> reboot<00:04:20.729> is<00:04:20.849> because<00:04:22.190> how<00:04:23.190> they

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
wanted to reboot is because how they

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:24.290 
wanted to reboot is because how they
ended<00:04:23.789> on<00:04:24.000> the

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
ended on the

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:28.040 
ended on the
third<00:04:24.419> film<00:04:24.780> with<00:04:25.110> the<00:04:25.379> kind<00:04:25.620> of<00:04:25.800> mesh<00:04:26.780> but<00:04:27.780> I

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.050 
third film with the kind of mesh but I

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:29.420 
third film with the kind of mesh but I
like<00:04:28.199> to<00:04:28.319> the<00:04:28.379> third<00:04:28.560> film<00:04:28.770> it<00:04:28.949> tied<00:04:29.099> up<00:04:29.220> a<00:04:29.280> lot

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
like to the third film it tied up a lot

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.249 
like to the third film it tied up a lot
of<00:04:29.550> loose<00:04:29.669> ends<00:04:29.909> and<00:04:30.180> it<00:04:30.750> finished<00:04:31.020> a<00:04:31.080> story

00:04:31.249 --> 00:04:31.259 
of loose ends and it finished a story

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:32.510 
of loose ends and it finished a story
off<00:04:31.440> great<00:04:31.770> there<00:04:31.979> were<00:04:32.069> a<00:04:32.099> couple<00:04:32.250> questions

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
off great there were a couple questions

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.540 
off great there were a couple questions
but<00:04:33.150> nobody<00:04:33.659> really<00:04:33.870> cared<00:04:34.250> that<00:04:35.250> was<00:04:35.340> kind<00:04:35.520> of

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
but nobody really cared that was kind of

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:36.830 
but nobody really cared that was kind of
self-explanatory<00:04:35.970> if<00:04:36.360> you<00:04:36.419> really<00:04:36.629> wanted<00:04:36.810> to

self-explanatory if you really wanted to

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.119 
self-explanatory if you really wanted to

00:04:38.119 --> 00:04:38.129 
know you could actually go back in

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:39.680 
know you could actually go back in
comics<00:04:38.460> and<00:04:38.580> look<00:04:38.729> up<00:04:38.819> that<00:04:38.849> answer<00:04:39.240> nobody

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
comics and look up that answer nobody

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:41.480

knows what this new one is gonna hold

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.999 
knows what this new one is gonna hold
but<00:04:42.120> the<00:04:42.330> new<00:04:42.569> series<00:04:42.960> starts<00:04:43.500> or<00:04:43.770> the<00:04:43.800> new

00:04:43.999 --> 00:04:44.009 
but the new series starts or the new

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:47.510 
but the new series starts or the new
first<00:04:44.759> of<00:04:45.060> the<00:04:45.470> trilogy<00:04:46.470> or<00:04:46.889> however<00:04:47.129> movies

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
first of the trilogy or however movies

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.689 
first of the trilogy or however movies
are<00:04:47.639> gonna<00:04:47.759> be<00:04:47.940> there<00:04:48.120> starts<00:04:48.870> in<00:04:48.990> 2012<00:04:49.830> so<00:04:50.340> I

00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:50.699 
are gonna be there starts in 2012 so I

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:52.700 
are gonna be there starts in 2012 so I
guess<00:04:51.300> we<00:04:51.419> have<00:04:51.449> to<00:04:51.569> wait<00:04:51.780> until<00:04:51.930> then<00:04:52.229> but

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710
