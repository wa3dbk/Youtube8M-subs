00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
there and down in that stuff let her go

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:32.020 
there and down in that stuff let her go
get<00:02:27.800> her<00:02:27.860> back<00:02:28.100> all<00:02:29.030> right<00:02:30.670> this<00:02:31.670> technique<00:02:31.910> is

get her back all right this technique is

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:33.790 
get her back all right this technique is
really<00:02:32.330> used<00:02:32.450> best<00:02:32.660> with<00:02:32.780> a<00:02:32.810> big<00:02:33.019> heavy<00:02:33.230> heavy

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
really used best with a big heavy heavy

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.660 
really used best with a big heavy heavy
rod<00:02:34.069> I<00:02:34.840> got<00:02:35.840> the<00:02:35.989> st.<00:02:36.440> Croix<00:02:36.680> slopping<00:02:37.430> frog

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
rod I got the st. Croix slopping frog

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.729 
rod I got the st. Croix slopping frog
rod<00:02:37.880> the<00:02:38.750> seven-foot<00:02:39.640> heavy<00:02:41.530> it's<00:02:42.530> like<00:02:42.650> a

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:42.739 
rod the seven-foot heavy it's like a

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:49.620 
rod the seven-foot heavy it's like a
broomstick<00:02:44.049> i'm<00:02:45.049> using<00:02:45.319> 50-pound<00:02:45.769> power<00:02:46.310> pro

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:52.660 

and<00:02:50.630> that<00:02:51.260> that<00:02:51.590> braid<00:02:51.860> is<00:02:52.010> very<00:02:52.220> important

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
and that that braid is very important

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.120 
and that that braid is very important
especially<00:02:53.320> see<00:02:54.320> how<00:02:54.410> far<00:02:54.650> i'm<00:02:54.769> casting<00:02:54.950> out

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
especially see how far i'm casting out

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:01.000 
especially see how far i'm casting out
so<00:02:58.130> when<00:02:58.220> you're<00:02:58.340> casting<00:02:58.519> out<00:02:59.350> is<00:03:00.350> far<00:03:00.769> it's

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
so when you're casting out is far it's

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.610 
so when you're casting out is far it's
important<00:03:01.370> out<00:03:01.430> of<00:03:01.459> the<00:03:01.549> braid<00:03:02.470> said<00:03:03.470> these

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
important out of the braid said these

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.240 
important out of the braid said these
fish<00:03:03.799> could<00:03:03.950> really<00:03:05.200> feel<00:03:06.200> it<00:03:06.380> so<00:03:07.130> you<00:03:07.190> could

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
fish could really feel it so you could

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.699 
fish could really feel it so you could
really<00:03:07.459> feel<00:03:07.579> the<00:03:07.640> fish<00:03:07.910> and<00:03:08.590> there's<00:03:09.590> no

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
really feel the fish and there's no

really feel the fish and there's no
stretch<00:03:10.040> its<00:03:11.079> instantaneous<00:03:12.820> the<00:03:13.820> second

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
stretch its instantaneous the second

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.630 
stretch its instantaneous the second
that<00:03:14.269> fish<00:03:14.450> hits<00:03:14.690> it<00:03:14.870> man<00:03:15.640> yeah

that fish hits it man yeah

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.780 
that fish hits it man yeah
you're<00:03:18.210> instantly<00:03:18.569> driving<00:03:19.050> up<00:03:19.520> frog<00:03:20.520> through

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
you're instantly driving up frog through

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:26.750 
you're instantly driving up frog through
its<00:03:20.910> mouth<00:03:23.540> that<00:03:24.540> fish<00:03:24.780> was<00:03:25.550> probably<00:03:26.550> sitting

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
its mouth that fish was probably sitting

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.340 
its mouth that fish was probably sitting
in<00:03:26.819> the<00:03:26.880> foot<00:03:27.030> of<00:03:27.120> water<00:03:29.990> that's<00:03:30.990> pretty<00:03:31.140> close

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
in the foot of water that's pretty close

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:36.500 
in the foot of water that's pretty close
to<00:03:31.500> shore<00:03:34.550> just<00:03:35.550> very<00:03:35.760> retrieving<00:03:36.360> do<00:03:36.420> you

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
to shore just very retrieving do you

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.490 
to shore just very retrieving do you
find<00:03:36.750> what<00:03:36.840> they<00:03:36.959> like<00:03:38.900> give<00:03:39.900> me<00:03:40.020> want<00:03:40.140> it<00:03:40.230> fast
