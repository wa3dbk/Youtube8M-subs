00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
color the Grays are covered she had like

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.420 
color the Grays are covered she had like
a<00:02:03.030> lighter<00:02:03.780> brown<00:02:04.170> hair<00:02:04.530> and<00:02:04.890> there<00:02:05.160> was<00:02:05.280> some

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
a lighter brown hair and there was some

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.630 
a lighter brown hair and there was some
Gray's<00:02:05.670> but<00:02:06.590> I<00:02:07.590> thought<00:02:08.039> it<00:02:08.160> did<00:02:08.280> an<00:02:08.369> excellent

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
Gray's but I thought it did an excellent

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.790 
Gray's but I thought it did an excellent
job<00:02:08.789> her<00:02:09.119> hair<00:02:09.270> was<00:02:09.420> very<00:02:09.450> soft<00:02:09.929> afterward<00:02:10.500> and

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
job her hair was very soft afterward and

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.260 
job her hair was very soft afterward and
it<00:02:10.890> still<00:02:11.220> is<00:02:11.400> even<00:02:11.430> though<00:02:11.820> a<00:02:11.850> week<00:02:12.000> later

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
it still is even though a week later

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.580 
it still is even though a week later
it's<00:02:12.510> very<00:02:13.080> soft<00:02:13.350> and<00:02:14.240> the<00:02:15.240> Grays<00:02:15.630> are<00:02:16.020> still

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
it's very soft and the Grays are still

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.410 
it's very soft and the Grays are still
covered<00:02:16.920> even<00:02:17.160> after<00:02:17.430> washing<00:02:17.880> it<00:02:17.940> repeatedly

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
covered even after washing it repeatedly

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.580 
covered even after washing it repeatedly
so<00:02:19.350> I<00:02:19.800> thought<00:02:20.070> it<00:02:20.190> did<00:02:20.340> a<00:02:20.640> good<00:02:20.940> job<00:02:21.000> and<00:02:21.630> I<00:02:22.380> was

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
so I thought it did a good job and I was

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:23.990 
so I thought it did a good job and I was
very<00:02:22.770> impressed<00:02:23.250> with<00:02:23.340> it<00:02:23.490> and<00:02:23.670> I<00:02:23.730> think<00:02:23.790> that

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
very impressed with it and I think that

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.260 
very impressed with it and I think that
if<00:02:24.209> you're<00:02:24.300> looking<00:02:24.630> for<00:02:24.840> a<00:02:24.930> good<00:02:25.170> hair<00:02:25.560> color

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 
if you're looking for a good hair color

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.120 
if you're looking for a good hair color
and<00:02:27.270> you<00:02:27.360> don't<00:02:27.540> have<00:02:27.720> a<00:02:27.780> lot<00:02:27.930> of<00:02:27.959> time<00:02:28.230> or<00:02:28.709> even

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
and you don't have a lot of time or even

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.050 
and you don't have a lot of time or even
if<00:02:29.220> you<00:02:30.290> time<00:02:31.290> isn't<00:02:31.590> an<00:02:31.650> issue<00:02:31.800> the<00:02:32.220> smell<00:02:32.550> and

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
if you time isn't an issue the smell and

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.970 
if you time isn't an issue the smell and
the<00:02:33.570> quickness<00:02:33.810> and<00:02:34.140> the<00:02:34.200> effectiveness<00:02:34.770> were

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
the quickness and the effectiveness were

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.380 
the quickness and the effectiveness were
very<00:02:35.220> impressive<00:02:35.610> to<00:02:35.850> me<00:02:35.970> so<00:02:36.150> I<00:02:36.239> would

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
very impressive to me so I would

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.959 
very impressive to me so I would
recommend<00:02:36.570> it
