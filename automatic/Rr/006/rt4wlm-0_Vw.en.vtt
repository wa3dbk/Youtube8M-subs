00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.660 
unibody macbook pro to speed things up a
lot<00:00:24.720> but<00:00:25.199> it's<00:00:25.650> go<00:00:25.769> ahead<00:00:25.949> first<00:00:26.189> things<00:00:26.430> first

lot but it's go ahead first things first
go<00:00:26.820> and<00:00:26.939> get<00:00:27.029> to<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.210> unboxing<00:00:27.869> of<00:00:28.019> it<00:00:30.050> right

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
go and get to the unboxing of it right

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.690 
go and get to the unboxing of it right
and<00:00:31.199> here's<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.619> package<00:00:34.219> cut<00:00:35.219> into<00:00:35.520> it<00:00:35.640> a

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
and here's the package cut into it a

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:43.010 
and here's the package cut into it a
little<00:00:35.850> bit<00:00:40.399> and<00:00:41.399> of<00:00:42.180> course<00:00:42.239> always<00:00:42.660> get<00:00:42.899> the

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
little bit and of course always get the

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.970 
little bit and of course always get the
receipts<00:00:43.620> and<00:00:44.809> now<00:00:45.809> here<00:00:46.050> it<00:00:46.140> is<00:00:46.289> so<00:00:46.590> this<00:00:46.860> is

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
receipts and now here it is so this is

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.760 
receipts and now here it is so this is
probably<00:00:47.250> going<00:00:47.550> to<00:00:47.640> be<00:00:47.700> one<00:00:48.059> of<00:00:48.120> my<00:00:48.300> smallest

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:48.770 
probably going to be one of my smallest

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.260 
probably going to be one of my smallest
unboxings<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:50.039> let<00:00:50.309> me<00:00:50.370> actually<00:00:50.520> zoom<00:00:50.969> in<00:00:51.239> a

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
unboxings and let me actually zoom in a

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.090 
unboxings and let me actually zoom in a
little<00:00:51.449> bit<00:00:51.600> here<00:00:54.649> alright<00:00:55.649> so<00:00:55.770> it's<00:00:55.920> going<00:00:56.039> to

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
little bit here alright so it's going to

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.860 
little bit here alright so it's going to
be<00:00:56.219> one<00:00:56.430> of<00:00:56.460> these<00:00:56.610> smallest<00:00:57.149> unboxings<00:00:57.750> I've

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
be one of these smallest unboxings I've

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.090 
be one of these smallest unboxings I've
probably<00:00:57.989> ever<00:00:58.199> done<00:00:58.469> but<00:00:58.649> this<00:00:58.800> thing<00:00:59.070> is

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
probably ever done but this thing is

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.520 
probably ever done but this thing is
very<00:00:59.460> small<00:00:59.789> compact<00:01:00.390> no<00:01:01.109> moving<00:01:01.440> parts

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
very small compact no moving parts

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.680 
very small compact no moving parts
that's<00:01:01.949> what<00:01:02.100> a<00:01:02.129> solid<00:01:02.550> state<00:01:02.760> disk<00:01:03.059> is<00:01:03.300> is<00:01:03.510> no

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
that's what a solid state disk is is no

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.179 
that's what a solid state disk is is no
moving<00:01:03.930> parts<00:01:04.049> whatsoever<00:01:04.799> and<00:01:04.920> it<00:01:05.010> just

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
moving parts whatsoever and it just

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.539 
moving parts whatsoever and it just
provides<00:01:05.489> very<00:01:06.210> fast<00:01:06.630> performance<00:01:07.549> alright

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
provides very fast performance alright

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:19.520 
provides very fast performance alright
so<00:01:08.700> there's<00:01:08.880> some<00:01:09.000> tape<00:01:09.180> here

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.510 

alright<00:01:20.530> and<00:01:21.100> this<00:01:21.430> is<00:01:21.610> the<00:01:23.520> installation

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
alright and this is the installation

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:30.060 
alright and this is the installation
guide<00:01:24.790> the<00:01:25.690> Intel<00:01:26.050> gives<00:01:26.350> you<00:01:28.440> all<00:01:29.440> right<00:01:29.620> and

I got some styrofoam or whatever that is
and<00:01:32.610> here's<00:01:33.610> the<00:01:33.790> disc<00:01:34.030> itself<00:01:37.350> think<00:01:38.350> it's

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
and here's the disc itself think it's

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.010 
and here's the disc itself think it's
nice<00:01:38.770> small<00:01:39.370> very<00:01:39.880> compact<00:01:40.120> and<00:01:40.570> you<00:01:40.660> take<00:01:40.870> off

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
nice small very compact and you take off

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.250 
nice small very compact and you take off
this<00:01:42.150> electrostatic<00:01:43.150> sensitive<00:01:43.990> devices

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:44.260 
this electrostatic sensitive devices

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.220 
this electrostatic sensitive devices
yeah<00:01:44.560> i<00:01:44.620> mean<00:01:44.890> this<00:01:45.040> starts<00:01:45.460> the<00:01:45.520> stars<00:01:45.880> my

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:46.230 
yeah i mean this starts the stars my

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:48.600 
yeah i mean this starts the stars my
electricity<00:01:47.230> out<00:01:47.500> of<00:01:47.650> my<00:01:47.710> body<00:01:47.890> first<00:01:48.250> before

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
here it is a very small very compact

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.670 
here it is a very small very compact
little<00:02:13.920> solid<00:02:14.459> state<00:02:14.640> disk<00:02:14.910> and<00:02:15.410> with<00:02:16.410> this<00:02:16.500> I

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
little solid state disk and with this I

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:17.990 
little solid state disk and with this I
really<00:02:16.860> got<00:02:17.160> this<00:02:17.190> and<00:02:17.489> I've<00:02:17.610> been<00:02:17.700> wanting

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
this for a long time and basically I

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:22.670 
this for a long time and basically I
just<00:02:21.629> decided<00:02:21.900> to<00:02:22.080> go<00:02:22.170> ahead<00:02:22.230> and<00:02:22.379> get<00:02:22.470> it<00:02:22.590> for

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
just decided to go ahead and get it for

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.110 
just decided to go ahead and get it for
my<00:02:22.799> macbook<00:02:23.160> pro<00:02:23.340> so<00:02:23.549> it's<00:02:23.670> really<00:02:23.819> going<00:02:24.030> to

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
my macbook pro so it's really going to

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.729 
my macbook pro so it's really going to
provide<00:02:24.390> performance<00:02:24.750> but<00:02:25.080> you<00:02:25.230> can<00:02:25.319> see<00:02:25.470> here

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
provide performance but you can see here

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:28.759 
provide performance but you can see here
very<00:02:26.400> small<00:02:26.730> very<00:02:27.720> compact<00:02:28.019> just<00:02:28.620> like<00:02:28.739> a

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769 
very small very compact just like a

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:31.479 
very small very compact just like a
solid<00:02:29.160> I<00:02:29.310> me<00:02:29.670> just<00:02:29.819> like<00:02:29.940> a<00:02:29.970> solid<00:02:30.299> SSD<00:02:30.750> is<00:02:30.989> and

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
solid I me just like a solid SSD is and

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:34.460 
solid I me just like a solid SSD is and
it<00:02:32.489> should<00:02:32.640> be<00:02:32.730> relatively<00:02:33.090> easy<00:02:33.540> to<00:02:33.989> install

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
it should be relatively easy to install

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.070 
it should be relatively easy to install
all<00:02:35.459> right<00:02:35.819> and<00:02:36.060> so<00:02:36.420> the<00:02:36.569> next<00:02:36.720> video<00:02:36.989> I'm

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
all right and so the next video I'm

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
going to do is actually going to be the

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.250 
going to do is actually going to be the
installation<00:02:39.690> like<00:02:39.810> I<00:02:39.930> said<00:02:40.110> the

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
installation of the SSD inside my

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:45.259 
installation of the SSD inside my
macbook<00:02:43.500> pro<00:02:43.709> very<00:02:44.160> easy<00:02:44.340> process<00:02:44.670> i'm<00:02:45.120> going

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269
