overall on a scale of 1 to 10 I give
this<00:02:49.710> a<00:02:49.770> 9.5<00:02:50.520> mainly<00:02:51.510> due<00:02:51.690> to<00:02:51.720> the<00:02:51.900> fact<00:02:52.050> that

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
this a 9.5 mainly due to the fact that

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.890 
this a 9.5 mainly due to the fact that
has<00:02:52.500> the<00:02:52.680> stickers<00:02:53.070> but<00:02:53.700> I<00:02:54.000> still<00:02:54.480> get<00:02:54.600> a<00:02:54.660> very

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900

has the stickers but I still get a very
high<00:02:54.960> rating<00:02:55.470> um<00:02:56.360> so<00:02:57.360> I<00:02:57.750> guess<00:02:58.110> that's<00:02:58.530> it<00:02:58.620> for

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
high rating um so I guess that's it for

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.050 
high rating um so I guess that's it for
this<00:02:58.860> review<00:02:59.010> guys<00:02:59.370> and<00:02:59.400> I'll<00:02:59.670> catch<00:02:59.940> you
