reviews it's not the flavor of choice so

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.219 
reviews it's not the flavor of choice so
I<00:01:40.979> would<00:01:41.280> get<00:01:41.460> when<00:01:42.450> I<00:01:42.479> go<00:01:42.689> in<00:01:42.840> there<00:01:42.960> you<00:01:43.140> know

I would get when I go in there you know

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.350 
I would get when I go in there you know
for<00:01:43.470> a<00:01:43.530> casual<00:01:43.860> experience<00:01:44.009> but<00:01:44.820> overall<00:01:45.060> it's

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
for a casual experience but overall it's

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.190 
for a casual experience but overall it's
not<00:01:45.509> bad<00:01:45.689> at<00:01:45.810> all

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
not bad at all

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.580 
not bad at all
that<00:01:46.799> would<00:01:46.920> be<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.820> worst<00:01:48.320> catchphrase<00:01:49.320> to

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
that would be the worst catchphrase to

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.800 
that would be the worst catchphrase to
