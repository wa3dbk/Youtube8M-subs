00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 the sit in the fly today boy of 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.509
 I propose an ideal accompanying end 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.910
 for meat in particular for the 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.340
 boiled I'm talking about the red sauce 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.320
 also known as being good wet 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.519
 tomato-based pepper loss 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.410
 red 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.420
 usually the rubra sauce is prepared with 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.789
 an onion base however considered the 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.920
 my poor ended with this kind essay 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.650
 with very personal adoration galleries 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.380
 let's see together 400 g of tomatoes 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.439
 peeled some cost of celery 1 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:35.370
 clove of garlic a carrot a 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:38.250
 teaspoon of sugar a pepper 2 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:41.520
 tablespoons of vinegar 2 tablespoons of oil 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:44.610
 extra virgin salt as needed and a 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.980
 spicy chilli then let's start with 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.530
 the base of our sauce or peeled 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.930
 and then washed the carota italia braun dell 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.300
 or removed the hard woody filaments from the 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.210
 celery we gather all the vegetables 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:02.219
 inside a blender ed 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:05.790
 we get a roof at this point I have 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.470
 heated a saucepan add two 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.450
 spoons of oil we also learn to 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:14.909
 dose the fats with a spoon 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:17.020
 no need to overdo it and 2 see it seems 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.210
 already a lot 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.850
 soak with a clove of garlic 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.500
 skewered it in a stick like this 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.780
 then it will also be easier to remove it 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.030
 as I said before there are those who put the 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.429
 I don't put onion because I don't 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:33.280
 like to taste though you can clearly 

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:42.219
 add to if you prefer to 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:45.640
 inserted in the peninsula and then add 

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:49.299
 even the chilli a couple of 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:52.560
 little pieces of chili you can use 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:56.399
 naturally also the dry one 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:02:00.009
 let's mix well, let's flavor 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:04.509
 let's also lower from flame in the meantime 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:06.810
 we prepare vegetables here we are 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:09.700
 so I washed the red pepper 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.450
 now I'm cutting astense lines and then 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.159
 diced 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:18.959
 at the least to loans, however still frulli 

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:22.680
 once we have cut the whole 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:27.930
 we add peppers to the mince that meanwhile 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:29.430
 it softened so well 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.870
 all the layout on our career 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:35.849
 so we ask ourselves Latin lasko anyway 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:39.030
 we believe I said let's come back are 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:41.430
 liner and try to make gods 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.440
 small pieces with peeled tomatoes if 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.720
 we are in seasons says the peeled tomatoes 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.400
 we can clearly use i 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.470
 fresh tomatoes 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.459
 but now tomatoes are not so 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.900
 good 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:56.340
 so what do we use pirates for 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:58.980
 the Italian pezzetti or striscioline e 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.650
 then I call them ingredients speakers 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.980
 back inside the keep the 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:07.489
 that in the meantime also raised the flame 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:10.489
 we think all the pieces of peeled tomatoes 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:10.489
 so 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:20.409
 then we keep the sugar they will need 

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:22.739
 also to remove the acidity of the 

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:22.739
 tomato 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:30.700
 add white vinegar or 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:35.579
 apple vinegar for a little more flavor 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:35.579
 delicate and salt to taste 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.569
 let's take boiling 

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:44.650
 after which we will run about 30 40 minutes 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:48.750
 and we cook very very sweet fire in 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:51.909
 so that the sauce comes out and is reduced 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:54.040
 after about 40 minutes of cooking a lot 

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:56.590
 slow this result as you can 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.939
 see the sauce has dried if you want 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.889
 further down you don't have to do anything else 

00:03:57.939 --> 00:04:02.680
 that to remove the cover raise the 

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:10.060
 flame so that the water inside and 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:12.900
 dolls we take now magna and fury mo 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.900
 with the immersion mixer 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:19.280
 here it is ours without google it is 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:21.530
 ready to accompany the meat or 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.510
 even good fries you can with 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:25.850
 the fries because you need to know that 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:29.120
 salsa rubra the progenitor of the best known 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:30.830
 Ketchup is kept in the fridge for 45 days 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.680
 or for longer storage 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:35.900
 I recommend the freezer or even 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.830
 if you can follow the meal technique 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.830
 vibration of jams
