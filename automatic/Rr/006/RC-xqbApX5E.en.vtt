00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:08.490
 this restoration theme starts from what 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:11.940
 what is the body towards what is the 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:16.800
 chassis working it complete from a 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:19.260
 General sandblasting and a post base 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.720
 anticorrosive to be able to pass to 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:25.320
 base components and then to work 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.869
 end of painting in an oven equal with 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.660
 the chassis is a job of sandblasting a 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.119
 anti-corrosive base work and then 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.740
 with the theme of the final color or ander 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:38.729
 rated soldering iron that is very important 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:42.390
 painting in an oven why do you paint 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:48.060
 as final work already free of 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:49.440
 particles and environmental humidity that 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.679
 make the finish of the paint to 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.479
 final 

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:56.060
 practically do not even need 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:59.630
 they have to polish already 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:02.060
 Boots a shine and a finish very very very 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.859
 perfect we have an oven 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:07.159
 of last generation in which we do 

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:11.540
 works since from cars of the year 39 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:13.910
 until 2013 an old car could 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:18.240
 take approximately to make a 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:22.170
 ironing and painting work from 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.640
 from a month to maybe a year 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.010
 these works are relatively 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.080
 very patiently because what is 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.150
 he wants to get out of a car practically 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.530
 as if it came out of the store is not 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:37.230
 year it was the as I tell you from 39 to 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:40.410
 2013 without problems definitely the 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:44.160
 Labor is one of the most important roles 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:47.750
 important of the included process you have 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:50.520
 than having a skilled workforce 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:53.430
 to be constantly trained in 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:55.880
 techniques and paint that come out day to 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:59.400
 day in the cars we work with 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:01.380
 high - tech tools 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.710

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.880
 there are towards the can from the outside 

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:08.580

 standards of it by this it 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:55.600
 change 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:58.030

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:04.489
 irregularities in painting 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:06.250
