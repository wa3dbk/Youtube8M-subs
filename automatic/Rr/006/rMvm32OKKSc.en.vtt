from arranging a super fast nothing that
her<00:00:35.070> other<00:00:35.190> cameras<00:00:35.610> were<00:00:35.700> pretty<00:00:35.910> stable<00:00:36.180> if

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
her other cameras were pretty stable if

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.030 
her other cameras were pretty stable if
they<00:00:36.540> start<00:00:36.809> from<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.110> mid<00:00:37.290> combo<00:00:37.739> and<00:00:37.920> it

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
they start from the mid combo and it

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.310 
they start from the mid combo and it
goes<00:00:38.219> up<00:00:38.430> to<00:00:38.510> really<00:00:39.510> gonna<00:00:39.690> come<00:00:39.899> up<00:00:40.020> but<00:00:40.200> it's

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
goes up to really gonna come up but it's

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.080 
goes up to really gonna come up but it's
hard<00:00:40.530> to<00:00:40.590> land<00:00:40.800> so<00:00:41.489> I<00:00:41.520> think<00:00:41.640> you<00:00:41.910> got<00:00:42.059> a

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.819 
hard to land so I think you got a
basically<00:00:42.600> tiny<00:00:42.930> catch<00:00:43.140> for<00:00:43.320> hundreds<00:00:43.710> and

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
basically tiny catch for hundreds and

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.220 
basically tiny catch for hundreds and

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
reto lead opponents with her you can't

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.569 
reto lead opponents with her you can't
really<00:00:46.410> do<00:00:46.620> rush<00:00:46.860> downs<00:00:47.129> you<00:00:47.250> can't<00:00:47.460> really
