00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
crash and I think he benches 150 odd I

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.030 
crash and I think he benches 150 odd I
think<00:04:27.960> that's<00:04:28.110> all<00:04:28.260> he<00:04:28.380> did<00:04:28.530> up<00:04:28.650> in<00:04:28.740> Wigan

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040
