00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
the iphone doesn't capture audio so you

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.990 
the iphone doesn't capture audio so you
just<00:01:11.520> have<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:11.760> believe<00:01:11.850> me<00:01:11.970> that<00:01:12.330> works<00:01:14.000> and

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
just have to believe me that works and

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.429 
just have to believe me that works and
you<00:01:15.750> can<00:01:15.869> also<00:01:15.990> see<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.380> notes<00:01:16.590> right<00:01:16.890> there

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:18.439 
you can also see the notes right there

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:21.740 
you can also see the notes right there
so<00:01:19.439> one<00:01:20.189> thing<00:01:20.369> that<00:01:20.430> one<00:01:20.880> major<00:01:21.090> changes<00:01:21.540> then

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
so one thing that one major changes then

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.429 
so one thing that one major changes then
this<00:01:22.290> this<00:01:22.710> done<00:01:23.070> tab<00:01:23.430> was<00:01:24.299> actually<00:01:24.750> used<00:01:25.290> to

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
this this done tab was actually used to

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.230 
this this done tab was actually used to
be<00:01:25.560> in<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.770> place<00:01:26.009> of<00:01:26.040> this<00:01:26.280> nearby<00:01:26.729> tab<00:01:27.030> which

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
again but it's beautiful adding a

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.260

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:52.199 
picture is pretty standard you can add a
URL<00:03:50.010> so<00:03:51.010> basically<00:03:51.370> almost<00:03:51.670> anything<00:03:52.030> you

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:52.209 
URL so basically almost anything you

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:54.090 
URL so basically almost anything you
could<00:03:52.360> want<00:03:52.390> to<00:03:52.720> do<00:03:52.840> with<00:03:52.959> a<00:03:53.019> task<00:03:53.230> you<00:03:53.500> can<00:03:53.800> and

field<00:03:57.459> at<00:03:57.640> the<00:03:57.730> top<00:03:57.760> I<00:03:58.150> believe<00:03:58.690> you<00:03:58.780> could

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900 
field at the top I believe you could

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.210 
field at the top I believe you could
always<00:03:58.989> set<00:03:59.260> priority<00:03:59.769> because<00:03:59.890> now<00:04:00.070> you<00:04:00.130> can

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
always set priority because now you can

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.449 
always set priority because now you can
actually<00:04:00.430> star<00:04:00.880> things<00:04:01.209> as<00:04:01.510> well<00:04:02.130> if<00:04:03.130> I<00:04:03.220> tap<00:04:03.430> on
