ones<00:00:31.560> I'm<00:00:31.800> going<00:00:31.980> to<00:00:32.040> use<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.460> pretty<00:00:33.000> much

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
ones I'm going to use the pretty much

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.049 
ones I'm going to use the pretty much
the<00:00:33.239> width<00:00:33.420> I<00:00:33.510> have<00:00:33.660> here<00:00:34.610> but<00:00:35.610> I<00:00:35.670> think<00:00:35.940> I'm

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
the width I have here but I think I'm

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.440 
the width I have here but I think I'm
going<00:00:36.180> to<00:00:36.210> go<00:00:36.360> with<00:00:36.480> a<00:00:36.540> 15<00:00:38.000> sometimes<00:00:39.000> get<00:00:39.420> too

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
going to go with a 15 sometimes get too

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.750 
going to go with a 15 sometimes get too
odd<00:00:39.809> you<00:00:39.989> can<00:00:40.140> see<00:00:40.530> them<00:00:40.649> so<00:00:40.829> 15<00:00:41.340> so<00:00:41.520> I'll<00:00:41.610> mark

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
odd you can see them so 15 so I'll mark

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.549 
odd you can see them so 15 so I'll mark
the<00:00:41.969> bottom<00:00:42.360> here<00:00:42.710> my<00:00:43.710> inseam<00:00:44.340> is

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:45.559 
the bottom here my inseam is

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:48.340 
the bottom here my inseam is
approximately<00:00:46.559> 1/2<00:00:46.920> what<00:00:47.370> my<00:00:47.489> out<00:00:47.670> seam<00:00:48.000> is

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 
approximately 1/2 what my out seam is

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.790 
approximately 1/2 what my out seam is
for<00:00:49.350> I<00:00:49.829> knew<00:00:50.250> just<00:00:50.700> past<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.180> knee<00:00:51.360> length<00:00:51.800> so

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
for I knew just past the knee length so

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.619 
for I knew just past the knee length so
since<00:00:53.039> that's<00:00:53.219> 20<00:00:54.230> 1/2<00:00:55.230> would<00:00:55.440> be<00:00:55.500> 10<00:00:56.539> so<00:00:57.539> I'm

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
since that's 20 1/2 would be 10 so I'm

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.150 
since that's 20 1/2 would be 10 so I'm
going<00:00:57.780> to<00:00:57.840> go<00:00:57.899> right<00:00:58.079> in<00:00:58.199> with<00:00:58.440> 10<00:00:58.800> and<00:00:58.829> a<00:00:59.010> half

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
going to go right in with 10 and a half

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.340 
going to go right in with 10 and a half
and<00:00:59.460> Mark<00:00:59.760> that<00:00:59.969> as<00:01:00.120> my<00:01:00.270> inseam<00:01:02.270> my<00:01:03.270> curve<00:01:03.660> for

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
and Mark that as my inseam my curve for

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.710 
and Mark that as my inseam my curve for
the<00:01:04.439> crotch<00:01:04.680> is<00:01:04.939> approximately<00:01:05.939> 2<00:01:06.270> inches

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
the crotch is approximately 2 inches

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.640 
the crotch is approximately 2 inches
so<00:01:07.500> here's<00:01:07.799> will<00:01:07.979> start<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.430> curve<00:01:09.530> then<00:01:10.530> I'm

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
so here's will start the curve then I'm

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.090 
so here's will start the curve then I'm
going<00:01:10.799> to<00:01:10.860> cut<00:01:11.630> out<00:01:12.630> my<00:01:13.170> pattern<00:01:13.380> across<00:01:13.799> the

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
going to cut out my pattern across the

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:23.149 
going to cut out my pattern across the
top<00:01:20.450> you<00:01:21.450> measure<00:01:21.630> 21<00:01:22.200> throw<00:01:22.439> on<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.650> inside

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
top you measure 21 throw on the inside

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.170 
top you measure 21 throw on the inside
here<00:01:23.700> I'll<00:01:24.180> cut<00:01:24.360> across<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.780> top<00:01:24.810> first<00:01:26.180> so

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
here I'll cut across the top first so

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.580 
here I'll cut across the top first so
that's<00:01:27.360> just<00:01:27.570> you<00:01:27.720> can<00:01:27.869> make<00:01:27.990> a<00:01:28.020> line<00:01:28.290> cross

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
that's just you can make a line cross

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.109 
that's just you can make a line cross
top<00:01:28.890> to<00:01:29.100> get<00:01:29.220> a<00:01:29.250> straighter<00:01:29.549> line<00:01:29.670> but<00:01:30.030> you're

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
top to get a straighter line but you're

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.210 
top to get a straighter line but you're
not<00:01:30.240> going<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.479> really<00:01:30.630> see<00:01:30.750> that<00:01:31.200> we'll<00:01:32.040> take
