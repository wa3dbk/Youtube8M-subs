00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 Recently, there are cases when 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.160
 drivers do not provide an advantage 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.200
 special machinery movements included 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.940
 flashing beacons and siren we 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.000
 decided to find out if this is so for this 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.440
 go to Orel road 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.480
 The initiators of such an unusual event were 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.730
 employees of the MCH and road guards 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.590
 by the way such events take place in 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.570
 many cities and for the eagle it is not in 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.519
 the novelty is once again rescuers decided 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.560
 to attract the attention of Oryol drivers to 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.080
 the problem of the rapid arrival of special vehicles on 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.840
 emergency situations do not miss 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.750
 very many rulers 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:35.910
 car ft no sls resulting in 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.969
 to the fact that they arrive at the place of assistance 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.870
 emergency will then ttp fire 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:44.489
 or some other situation 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.440
 For example, in Kursk, this happened in 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.450
 early this week and i think that 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.820
 similar preventive actions 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.520
 jointly with the traffic police of russia in orlovskaya 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.590
 the field of MCH will conduct regularly 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.690
 together with the fireman driver kamaz we 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.850
 went to the route from the square of the world to 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.160
 junction with mikhalitsyn street on the road 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.899
 chose the busiest and even at one o'clock 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.700
 peak throughout the entire plot in this 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.320
 time DPS outfits 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.220
 they were you in case of anything 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.320
 stop intruder yesterday 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.120
 participated in the action 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.380
 search and rescue service car 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:19.640
 emergency rescue 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:22.160
 gazelle he followed the route from running 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.620
 Grenada Karl Marx Square and back 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:27.470
 at the end of yesterday we had 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:29.510
 compiled two protocols with employees 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.160
 traffic police but worth noting that even 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.720
 moving very tightly Oryol 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.340
 motorists behaved showing up 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.200
 respect for special equipment 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.030
 some tried to reorganize in advance 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.860
 others are not in a hurry to give way 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.140
 road but this is understandable because dense 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.729
 the flow is not so easy to do 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.560
 this is a third case in case 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:47.420
 real accident even with a traffic jam 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.190
 the fire truck doesn't stand in traffic jams and on 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:54.590
 traffic lights even when drivers do not 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:57.130
 provide the advantage of retreating from 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.990
 traffic regulations 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.430
 if necessary 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.170
 really surprised during this 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.090
 departure is the fact that most 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.460
 pedestrians do not seem to see or hear 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.890
 no flashing beacons no howling 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.869
 sirens though they were on the roadway 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.790
 parts must give way to cars 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.060
 special services from the driver Alexander 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:19.019
 opinion on this matter but in general people 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:22.260
 understand trips that for example 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:26.030
 particular fire engine 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:28.420
 maybe even this car book 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.670
 radio by people traffic participant 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.890
 just respect 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.110
 car in one word this action showed 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.090
 that this problem in our city is 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.680
 and the security officers once again 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.870
 encourages road users 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.030
 do not remain indifferent to someone's 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.950
 trouble and still give way to help 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.430
 after all, even a few seconds can cost 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.430
 someone's life
