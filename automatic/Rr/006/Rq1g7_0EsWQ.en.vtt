store<00:00:43.719> for<00:00:44.320> pennies<00:00:45.280> I've<00:00:46.210> got<00:00:46.420> two<00:00:46.570> different

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:46.780 
store for pennies I've got two different

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:47.790 
store for pennies I've got two different
sizes<00:00:46.930> here<00:00:47.109> just<00:00:47.320> because<00:00:47.500> that's<00:00:47.620> what<00:00:47.710> I

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:47.800 
sizes here just because that's what I

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.470 
sizes here just because that's what I
could<00:00:47.920> find<00:00:48.070> I<00:00:48.219> was<00:00:48.309> making<00:00:48.550> this<00:00:48.609> video<00:00:48.730> but

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:49.480 
could find I was making this video but

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:50.580 
could find I was making this video but
the<00:00:49.570> length<00:00:49.780> doesn't<00:00:49.989> really<00:00:50.170> matter<00:00:50.379> we

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:50.590 
the length doesn't really matter we

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:57.349 
the length doesn't really matter we
don't<00:00:50.680> need<00:00:50.859> to<00:00:50.949> do<00:00:51.039> that<00:00:51.100> to<00:00:51.489> be<00:00:51.640> that<00:00:51.910> long

00:00:57.349 --> 00:00:57.359 

00:00:57.359 --> 00:01:00.090 

we're<00:00:58.359> going<00:00:58.449> to<00:00:58.510> start<00:00:58.840> by<00:00:59.079> finding<00:00:59.410> a<00:00:59.739> place

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100 
we're going to start by finding a place

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.069 
we're going to start by finding a place
on<00:01:00.340> the<00:01:00.579> helmet<00:01:00.910> where<00:01:01.089> you<00:01:01.179> want<00:01:01.390> our<00:01:01.629> camera

00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:02.079 
on the helmet where you want our camera

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:04.259 
on the helmet where you want our camera
to<00:01:02.199> be<00:01:02.260> mounted<00:01:02.620> so<00:01:03.370> I'm<00:01:03.699> thinking<00:01:04.120> I'd<00:01:04.239> like

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:04.269 
to be mounted so I'm thinking I'd like

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:06.270 
to be mounted so I'm thinking I'd like
my<00:01:04.570> camera<00:01:04.870> to<00:01:05.019> mount<00:01:05.199> hood<00:01:05.320> right<00:01:05.590> about<00:01:05.890> here

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:06.280 
my camera to mount hood right about here

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.270 
my camera to mount hood right about here
and<00:01:06.430> then<00:01:06.520> we're<00:01:07.420> just<00:01:07.450> going<00:01:07.690> to<00:01:07.720> see<00:01:07.960> where

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
and then we're just going to see where

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.790 
and then we're just going to see where
best<00:01:09.390> zip<00:01:10.390> ties<00:01:10.600> are<00:01:10.750> going<00:01:10.870> to<00:01:10.930> work<00:01:11.140> to<00:01:11.590> mount

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:11.800 
best zip ties are going to work to mount

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.100 
best zip ties are going to work to mount
it<00:01:12.010> there<00:01:12.160> so<00:01:12.340> it<00:01:12.460> looks<00:01:12.490> like<00:01:12.760> I'm<00:01:13.750> going<00:01:14.020> to

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.110 
it there so it looks like I'm going to

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.860 
it there so it looks like I'm going to
go<00:01:14.230> through<00:01:14.560> this<00:01:14.980> hole<00:01:15.370> and<00:01:15.700> around<00:01:16.690> this

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:16.870 
go through this hole and around this

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:20.370 
go through this hole and around this
coast<00:01:17.740> here<00:01:18.100> same<00:01:18.850> is<00:01:19.150> over<00:01:19.780> there<00:01:19.990> and<00:01:20.170> then

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
coast here same is over there and then

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.150 
coast here same is over there and then
probably<00:01:20.890> around<00:01:21.190> here<00:01:21.340> and<00:01:21.640> here<00:01:22.000> to<00:01:23.160> connect

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:24.160 
probably around here and here to connect

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.430 
probably around here and here to connect
to<00:01:24.550> the<00:01:24.760> top<00:01:25.120> there<00:01:25.570> might<00:01:25.990> pulled<00:01:26.260> up<00:01:26.380> a

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:26.440 
to the top there might pulled up a

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
to the top there might pulled up a
little<00:01:26.590> bit<00:01:26.710> we<00:01:26.800> probably<00:01:27.010> going<00:01:27.250> to<00:01:27.310> end<00:01:27.430> up

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
little bit we probably going to end up

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:35.030 
little bit we probably going to end up
with<00:01:27.550> it<00:01:27.900> more<00:01:28.900> right<00:01:29.350> about<00:01:29.590> here

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.230 

so<00:01:36.040> I'm<00:01:36.190> going<00:01:36.280> to<00:01:36.340> go<00:01:36.460> ahead<00:01:36.670> and<00:01:36.850> run<00:01:37.090> the

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
so I'm going to go ahead and run the

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.740 
so I'm going to go ahead and run the
first<00:01:37.510> zip<00:01:38.350> tie<00:01:39.210> go<00:01:40.210> through<00:01:40.360> the<00:01:40.420> inside<00:01:40.690> of

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
first zip tie go through the inside of

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.870 
first zip tie go through the inside of
the<00:01:40.810> helmet<00:01:40.930> and<00:01:41.200> out<00:01:41.410> like<00:01:41.650> that<00:01:41.890> and<00:01:42.730> then

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
the helmet and out like that and then

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.060 
the helmet and out like that and then
I'll<00:01:42.970> do<00:01:43.120> the<00:01:43.150> other<00:01:43.300> one<00:01:43.750> as<00:01:43.900> well<00:01:44.140> these<00:01:44.890> are

I'll do the other one as well these are
the<00:01:45.100> two<00:01:45.310> for<00:01:45.550> the<00:01:45.580> base<00:01:45.880> and<00:01:46.470> then<00:01:49.350> once

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
the two for the base and then once

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.040 
the two for the base and then once
you've<00:01:50.560> got<00:01:50.590> them<00:01:50.890> through<00:01:51.600> we<00:01:52.600> will<00:01:52.810> pass

00:02:13.749 --> 00:02:20.830 
going to go through
first<00:02:14.749> hole<00:02:15.609> out<00:02:16.609> of<00:02:16.670> the<00:02:16.819> second<00:02:19.209> second<00:02:20.209> and

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
first hole out of the second second and

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:21.970 
first hole out of the second second and
then<00:02:20.989> we're<00:02:21.079> going<00:02:21.170> to<00:02:21.290> pass<00:02:21.469> them<00:02:21.709> through

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
then we're going to pass them through

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:28.149 
then we're going to pass them through
the<00:02:22.099> top<00:02:22.480> of<00:02:25.239> the<00:02:26.239> front<00:02:26.959> of<00:02:27.230> the<00:02:27.650> head<00:02:27.920> strap

00:02:28.149 --> 00:02:28.159 
the top of the front of the head strap

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:30.970 
the top of the front of the head strap
mount<00:02:28.780> and<00:02:29.780> then<00:02:29.870> we'll<00:02:30.049> put<00:02:30.230> them<00:02:30.439> into

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
mount and then we'll put them into

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:40.690 
mount and then we'll put them into
themselves<00:02:32.469> just<00:02:33.469> like<00:02:34.069> that<00:02:39.219> the<00:02:40.219> next<00:02:40.400> step

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
themselves just like that the next step

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.129 
themselves just like that the next step
is<00:02:40.879> going<00:02:41.060> to<00:02:41.120> be<00:02:41.209> to<00:02:41.359> tighten<00:02:41.659> down<00:02:41.689> each<00:02:42.019> one

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:42.139 
is going to be to tighten down each one

00:02:42.139 --> 00:02:45.280 
is going to be to tighten down each one
of<00:02:42.680> the<00:02:43.249> zip<00:02:43.999> ties<00:02:44.209> so<00:02:44.689> we're<00:02:44.989> just<00:02:45.019> going<00:02:45.230> to

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
of the zip ties so we're just going to

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.619 
of the zip ties so we're just going to
start<00:02:45.530> gently<00:02:46.060> snugging<00:02:47.060> them<00:02:47.090> up<00:02:47.269> I<00:02:47.450> don't

00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:47.629 
start gently snugging them up I don't

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:49.750 
start gently snugging them up I don't
want<00:02:47.780> to<00:02:47.840> do<00:02:47.900> any<00:02:48.169> one<00:02:48.439> of<00:02:48.500> them<00:02:48.769> too<00:02:49.280> tight<00:02:49.519> to

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
want to do any one of them too tight to

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.640 
want to do any one of them too tight to
begin<00:02:49.879> with<00:02:50.269> because<00:02:50.689> that<00:02:50.930> could<00:02:51.230> skew<00:02:51.500> it

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
begin with because that could skew it

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.559 
begin with because that could skew it
off<00:02:51.859> to<00:02:52.609> one<00:02:53.120> side<00:02:53.329> or<00:02:53.870> the<00:02:53.959> other<00:02:55.359> that's<00:02:56.359> my

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:56.569 
off to one side or the other that's my

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:59.619 
off to one side or the other that's my
bottom<00:02:56.989> two<00:02:57.260> pretty<00:02:57.530> good<00:02:58.239> the<00:02:59.239> same<00:02:59.449> with<00:02:59.540> the

00:02:59.619 --> 00:02:59.629 
bottom two pretty good the same with the

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:02.349 
bottom two pretty good the same with the
top<00:02:59.810> two<00:03:00.639> see<00:03:01.639> how<00:03:01.730> it's<00:03:01.849> trying<00:03:01.909> to<00:03:02.060> pull<00:03:02.239> that

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:02.359 
top two see how it's trying to pull that

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:06.039 
top two see how it's trying to pull that
way<00:03:02.569> so<00:03:03.049> it's<00:03:03.199> time<00:03:03.379> to<00:03:04.689> tighten<00:03:05.689> up<00:03:05.750> the<00:03:05.840> other

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:06.049 
way so it's time to tighten up the other

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:08.470 
way so it's time to tighten up the other
side<00:03:06.379> and<00:03:06.799> then<00:03:07.730> just<00:03:07.879> making<00:03:08.030> sure<00:03:08.239> you<00:03:08.359> keep

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
side and then just making sure you keep

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.170 
side and then just making sure you keep
it<00:03:08.659> square<00:03:09.129> once<00:03:10.129> we're<00:03:10.310> done<00:03:10.489> we<00:03:10.730> can<00:03:10.849> get<00:03:10.969> rid

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
it square once we're done we can get rid

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.979 
it square once we're done we can get rid
of<00:03:11.299> the<00:03:12.909> the<00:03:13.909> long<00:03:14.120> bits<00:03:14.359> which<00:03:14.599> is<00:03:14.719> the<00:03:14.840> pair

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 
of the the long bits which is the pair

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:21.069 
of the the long bits which is the pair
of<00:03:15.079> scissors<00:03:18.280> just<00:03:19.280> cut<00:03:19.639> off<00:03:19.849> the<00:03:20.329> excess<00:03:20.780> just

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:21.079 
of scissors just cut off the excess just

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:32.409 
of scissors just cut off the excess just
like<00:03:21.259> that<00:03:27.579> and<00:03:29.919> then<00:03:30.939> the<00:03:31.939> last<00:03:32.120> step<00:03:32.269> of

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:32.419 
like that and then the last step of

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:35.949 
like that and then the last step of
course<00:03:32.659> is<00:03:32.900> to<00:03:32.989> simply<00:03:33.560> mount<00:03:34.129> our<00:03:34.370> camera<00:03:35.209> my

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:35.959 
course is to simply mount our camera my

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:37.809 
course is to simply mount our camera my
GoPro<00:03:36.319> here<00:03:36.680> just<00:03:37.189> going<00:03:37.310> to<00:03:37.400> slide<00:03:37.579> it<00:03:37.699> into

00:03:37.809 --> 00:03:37.819 
GoPro here just going to slide it into

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:42.719 
GoPro here just going to slide it into
the<00:03:38.090> mount<00:03:40.150> screw<00:03:41.150> it<00:03:41.239> in<00:03:41.329> and<00:03:41.509> just<00:03:41.599> like<00:03:42.500> that

00:03:42.719 --> 00:03:42.729 
the mount screw it in and just like that

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:46.659 
the mount screw it in and just like that
we<00:03:43.729> have<00:03:43.939> a<00:03:43.970> zip<00:03:44.359> tie<00:03:44.949> custom-made<00:03:45.949> helmet

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:46.669 
we have a zip tie custom-made helmet

00:03:46.669 --> 00:03:49.509 
we have a zip tie custom-made helmet
mount<00:03:47.090> out<00:03:47.329> of<00:03:47.569> a<00:03:47.780> head<00:03:48.049> strap<00:03:48.319> mount<00:03:48.500> which<00:03:49.340> we

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:49.519 
mount out of a head strap mount which we

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:52.179 
mount out of a head strap mount which we
made<00:03:49.699> for<00:03:50.060> well<00:03:50.509> virtually<00:03:51.049> free<00:03:51.650> we<00:03:51.979> paid<00:03:52.159> a

00:03:52.179 --> 00:03:52.189 
made for well virtually free we paid a

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:54.429 
made for well virtually free we paid a
couple<00:03:52.370> pennies<00:03:52.669> for<00:03:53.000> our<00:03:53.090> zip<00:03:53.299> ties<00:03:53.509> and

00:03:54.429 --> 00:03:54.439 
couple pennies for our zip ties and

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:56.860 
couple pennies for our zip ties and
apart<00:03:54.769> from<00:03:54.799> that<00:03:54.949> we<00:03:55.879> didn't<00:03:56.180> need<00:03:56.389> anything

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
apart from that we didn't need anything

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.039 
apart from that we didn't need anything
extra<00:03:57.370> this<00:03:58.370> mount<00:03:58.699> you<00:03:59.060> could<00:03:59.329> argue<00:03:59.840> is

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:00.049 
extra this mount you could argue is

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:03.129 
extra this mount you could argue is
probably<00:04:00.680> better<00:04:01.009> than<00:04:01.609> the<00:04:02.060> vented<00:04:02.719> helmet

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:03.139 
probably better than the vented helmet

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:04.599 
probably better than the vented helmet
strap<00:04:03.349> mount<00:04:03.500> because<00:04:03.979> it<00:04:04.099> doesn't<00:04:04.310> require<00:04:04.400> a

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:04.609 
strap mount because it doesn't require a

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:09.279 
strap mount because it doesn't require a
buckle<00:04:05.000> mount<00:04:05.150> to<00:04:05.269> go<00:04:05.389> into<00:04:05.629> it<00:04:05.750> and<00:04:05.900> it's<00:04:08.289> just

00:04:09.279 --> 00:04:09.289 
buckle mount to go into it and it's just

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:10.839 
buckle mount to go into it and it's just
more<00:04:09.500> low-profile<00:04:10.159> and<00:04:10.310> more<00:04:10.430> secure<00:04:10.729> we

00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:10.849 
more low-profile and more secure we

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:11.740 
more low-profile and more secure we
couldn't<00:04:11.090> have<00:04:11.180> got<00:04:11.299> something<00:04:11.599> this

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
couldn't have got something this

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.619 
couldn't have got something this
low-profile<00:04:12.469> using<00:04:12.919> the<00:04:13.299> buckle<00:04:14.299> mount<00:04:14.449> if

00:04:14.619 --> 00:04:14.629 
low-profile using the buckle mount if

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:15.899 
low-profile using the buckle mount if
you<00:04:14.719> want<00:04:14.900> to<00:04:14.959> be<00:04:15.049> a<00:04:15.079> little<00:04:15.259> bit<00:04:15.439> more

00:04:15.899 --> 00:04:15.909 
you want to be a little bit more

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:17.620 
you want to be a little bit more
discreet<00:04:16.909> about<00:04:17.150> the<00:04:17.209> fact<00:04:17.389> that<00:04:17.449> you're

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
discreet about the fact that you're

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:19.360 
discreet about the fact that you're
using<00:04:17.750> zip<00:04:17.989> ties<00:04:18.169> probably<00:04:18.769> try<00:04:18.919> to<00:04:18.949> find<00:04:19.159> some

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
using zip ties probably try to find some

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.519 
using zip ties probably try to find some
black<00:04:19.609> ones<00:04:19.880> would<00:04:20.090> be<00:04:20.120> a<00:04:20.209> good<00:04:20.419> idea<00:04:20.529> but

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:21.529 
black ones would be a good idea but

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:23.830 
black ones would be a good idea but
apart<00:04:22.310> from<00:04:22.370> that<00:04:22.610> really<00:04:23.029> simple<00:04:23.539> really

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
apart from that really simple really

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.119 
apart from that really simple really
secure<00:04:24.289> mount

00:04:26.119 --> 00:04:26.129 
secure mount

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:28.189 
secure mount
it<00:04:26.460> was<00:04:26.580> easy<00:04:26.729> to<00:04:26.819> do<00:04:27.030> it<00:04:27.240> was<00:04:27.360> basically<00:04:27.900> free

00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:28.199 
it was easy to do it was basically free

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:30.050 
it was easy to do it was basically free
if<00:04:28.349> you<00:04:28.409> have<00:04:28.440> a<00:04:28.560> head<00:04:28.710> strap<00:04:28.919> mount<00:04:29.099> if<00:04:29.340> you're

into curious about buying event how much
strap<00:04:32.789> mount<00:04:32.879> you<00:04:33.060> could<00:04:33.240> try<00:04:33.449> this<00:04:33.509> just<00:04:33.900> so

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
strap mount you could try this just so
