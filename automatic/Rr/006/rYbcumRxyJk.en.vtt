00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:05.040
 add a little drama theater to the channel and 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.260
 comedy 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.959
 as once in the scoop said aunt from 

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:11.749
 radio stations in the morning I really like 

00:00:09.959 --> 00:00:15.269
 your comments and I have repeatedly 

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:18.330
 I said that I learn a lot of new things from them 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:21.420
 please don't take me for nothing 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.520
 idiot before making a video i 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.310
 carefully study the question and most 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.560
 pitfalls stuff cones for you 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.710
 save your fucking time 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.260
 so I spoke on this move to 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.390
 debriefing and so I said that 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.489
 rewriting movies on playstation 3 with 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.859
 using usb drive which 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.530
 have to keep broken in mbr and 

00:00:40.859 --> 00:00:46.379
 put up with all the limitations of this 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.850
 India itself, but because ps3 is clear dick with 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.550
 same 5 can not work 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.559
 1 proposed option is not it easier 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.809
 uses to watch video on curling 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:59.579
 the media server is neither simpler and that is why 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:01.530
 the main problem the media server gives 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.350
 only streaming and files are not allowed 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.420
 rewrite ps3 itself to watch them 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.460
 without any additional devices 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.159
 because of this, there are a lot of problems 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.930
 First media server recodes 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.880
 without a loss 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.070
 second coded files 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.979
 It turns out that in order to see 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.049
 movies on ps3 you need to turn on the computer in 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.700
 third films will have to keep on this 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.100
 the computer itself that I personally do 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.890
 uncomfortable because in my computer 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.740
 darling from that little sizdi just 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.320
 at 128 gigabytes while in curling 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.950
 worth almost empty wines at 320 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.619
 gigabyte 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.049
 streaming scam and will load mesh 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.149
 as the flow turns decent yes and 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:45.060
 do not want to burn electricity in vain 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:47.820
 well and also if you choose a movie in 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.369
 xmb home can still be taught 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.429
 The process of starting the computer media server 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:56.039
 compounds and this is beyond their comprehension 

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:58.320
 Well, why do I need all this gimor if there is 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:02:00.619
 regular ability to record on ps3 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.840
 movies and play right from her 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:07.200
 I'm ready to put up with mbr just to not fuck 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.849
 brains media server nas and showtime not 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.340
 suitable for the same reason 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:13.900
 and the second comment came from my 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.040
 granddaughter this wise guy 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.500
 sup waiting for it without problems 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.959
 upload movies on ftp and 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.480
 watch them there that indirectly 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:24.220
 confirms that fucking pussy fucking does not know 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.500
 and only theorizes sitting 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.870
 go to the floyd ftp section 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.299
 movies and see that when recording from yusb 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.939
 movies on ps3 are decomposed for some 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:37.120
 incomprehensible folders with names of two 

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:40.120
 Letters where a movie put is not clear 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.909
 and most importantly ps3 keeps an index of these 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:46.209
 movies and how to run an update of this database 

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:49.030
 media files manually incomprehensible without 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:51.879
 Movie base update will not appear as 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:54.730
 xmb icons so the only 

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:56.859
 option is to ask your movie is 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.980
 same name as one of the already 

00:02:56.859 --> 00:03:02.829
 ps3 movies and rewrite 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.970
 instead in this case under the old 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:07.150
 name in xmb 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:09.129
 there will be a new film but it is unjustified 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.739
 think for hemorrhoids 

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:14.049
 each of say 20 movies what are you 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:16.239
 want to write the second option is 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:17.439
 upload files via ftp and use for 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:19.870
 showtime viewer 

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:22.150
 but personally, I think showtime 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.310
 loses the company worse than regular 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.949
 the player and management is not for me 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:29.019
 really like it so i use 

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:33.099
 showtime just for watching movies 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:36.669
 formats that ps3 doesn't understand but in 

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:38.379
 Overall, thank you for your comments by the way 

00:03:36.669 --> 00:03:41.290
 This is the first video with new equipment. 

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:49.120
 to record the sound that I finally 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:50.919
 completed the sound and now we share in 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.250
 comments what we think about quality 

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:53.250
 sounding
