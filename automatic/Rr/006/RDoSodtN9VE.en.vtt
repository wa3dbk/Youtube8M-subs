how this turns out for one Bob EULA you

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.300 
how this turns out for one Bob EULA you
can<00:03:09.019> you<00:03:09.290> can<00:03:09.440> never<00:03:09.590> underestimate<00:03:09.709> the

can you can never underestimate the

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.280 
can you can never underestimate the
possibility<00:03:11.000> that<00:03:11.030> a<00:03:11.180> space<00:03:11.390> animal<00:03:11.750> is<00:03:12.049> gonna

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
possibility that a space animal is gonna

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.860 
possibility that a space animal is gonna
plumb<00:03:12.920> it<00:03:13.010> off<00:03:13.099> the<00:03:13.250> level<00:03:13.489> of<00:03:13.549> night<00:03:13.840> due<00:03:14.840> to

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
plumb it off the level of night due to

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.170 
plumb it off the level of night due to
the<00:03:15.019> speed<00:03:15.200> yeah<00:03:15.379> absolutely<00:03:16.180> but

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
the speed yeah absolutely but

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.710 
the speed yeah absolutely but
unfortunately<00:03:17.890> mr.<00:03:18.890> when<00:03:19.040> Bo<00:03:19.190> eats<00:03:19.700> eats<00:03:20.150> the

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
dominated in terms of momentum he's

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.370 
dominated in terms of momentum he's
gonna<00:03:33.500> want<00:03:33.799> out<00:03:34.510> close<00:03:35.510> to<00:03:35.660> me<00:03:35.750> there<00:03:36.169> we<00:03:36.230> go

off<00:06:09.150> the<00:06:09.210> level<00:06:09.629> that<00:06:10.289> happens<00:06:10.620> a<00:06:10.680> lot<00:06:10.800> you're

00:06:10.999 --> 00:06:11.009 
off the level that happens a lot you're

00:06:11.009 --> 00:06:12.200 
off the level that happens a lot you're
trying<00:06:11.219> to<00:06:11.280> stay<00:06:11.430> at<00:06:11.520> the<00:06:11.610> maximum<00:06:12.060> possible

and get away from it and if you end up
going<00:06:19.440> yourself<00:06:19.979> it's<00:06:20.190> the<00:06:20.400> same<00:06:20.580> result

00:06:20.779 --> 00:06:20.789 
going yourself it's the same result

00:06:20.789 --> 00:06:23.029 
going yourself it's the same result
either<00:06:21.030> right<00:06:21.330> okay<00:06:21.659> so<00:06:21.719> now<00:06:21.960> it's<00:06:22.080> a<00:06:22.229> thing

00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:23.039
