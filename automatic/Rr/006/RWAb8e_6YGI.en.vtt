type and a player trade zone we figured

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:11.960 
type and a player trade zone we figured
out<00:01:10.950> how<00:01:11.010> to<00:01:11.070> get<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.400> work<00:01:11.520> so<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.790> player

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
out how to get to work so the player

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.429 
out how to get to work so the player
trade<00:01:12.180> zone<00:01:12.360> covers<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.750> entire<00:01:12.990> metrics<00:01:13.320> at

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
trade zone covers the entire metrics at

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.219 
trade zone covers the entire metrics at
the<00:01:13.530> spawn<00:01:13.770> areas<00:01:14.189> and<00:01:14.600> the<00:01:15.600> planned<00:01:15.990> it<00:01:16.080> only

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
the spawn areas and the planned it only

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.800 
the spawn areas and the planned it only
affects<00:01:16.650> one<00:01:16.830> team<00:01:17.130> so<00:01:17.670> meaning<00:01:17.939> that<00:01:18.060> when

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
affects one team so meaning that when

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.460 
affects one team so meaning that when
you<00:01:19.380> you<00:01:19.799> actually<00:01:20.220> get<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.369> choose<00:01:21.439> who<00:01:22.439> is

those and walk out then you know they're

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:50.149 
those and walk out then you know they're
there<00:01:48.119> you<00:01:48.930> know<00:01:49.020> what<00:01:49.229> they're<00:01:49.860> just<00:01:50.040> turned

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
there you know what they're just turned

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.530 
there you know what they're just turned
invisible<00:01:50.280> you<00:01:50.759> know<00:01:50.880> get<00:01:51.060> all<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.270> traits<00:01:51.479> of

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
invisible you know get all the traits of

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.690 
invisible you know get all the traits of
the<00:01:51.630> predator<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.140> stuff<00:01:52.320> like<00:01:52.470> that<00:01:55.549> so<00:01:56.549> it

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
the predator and stuff like that so it

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.639 
the predator and stuff like that so it
was<00:01:56.850> about<00:01:57.509> a<00:01:57.570> ton<00:01:57.750> of<00:01:57.780> fun<00:01:57.990> I<00:01:58.049> mean<00:01:58.229> this<00:01:58.350> map

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
was about a ton of fun I mean this map

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.980 
was about a ton of fun I mean this map
the<00:01:59.610> other<00:01:59.729> one<00:01:59.850> of<00:01:59.939> my<00:02:00.000> most<00:02:00.119> complex<00:02:00.659> and

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
the other one of my most complex and

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.929 
the other one of my most complex and
most<00:02:01.649> amazing<00:02:02.040> maps<00:02:02.219> yet<00:02:02.369> it<00:02:02.520> was<00:02:02.610> a<00:02:02.640> really

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
most amazing maps yet it was a really

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.600 
most amazing maps yet it was a really
big<00:02:03.210> challenge<00:02:03.780> because<00:02:03.930> a<00:02:04.399> lot<00:02:05.399> of<00:02:05.430> the

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
big challenge because a lot of the

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.310 
big challenge because a lot of the
decorative<00:02:05.939> items<00:02:06.390> in<00:02:06.540> Halo<00:02:06.750> 4<00:02:06.990> there's<00:02:07.259> a

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
decorative items in Halo 4 there's a

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.169 
decorative items in Halo 4 there's a
very<00:02:07.680> limited<00:02:08.310> amount<00:02:08.580> of<00:02:08.819> them<00:02:08.970> like<00:02:09.060> you

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
very limited amount of them like you

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.790 
very limited amount of them like you
only<00:02:09.330> get<00:02:09.479> like<00:02:09.599> 10<00:02:09.869> crates<00:02:10.229> which<00:02:10.440> i<00:02:10.560> think<00:02:10.619> is

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
only get like 10 crates which i think is

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.830 
only get like 10 crates which i think is
just<00:02:10.920> absolute<00:02:11.370> crap<00:02:11.760> so<00:02:12.360> I<00:02:12.420> ended<00:02:12.599> up<00:02:12.690> using

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
just absolute crap so I ended up using

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.730 
just absolute crap so I ended up using
them<00:02:13.050> up<00:02:13.170> actually

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
them up actually

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.710 
them up actually
all<00:02:13.890> on<00:02:14.190> shipping<00:02:14.640> containers<00:02:15.210> so<00:02:15.540> you<00:02:15.630> get

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
all on shipping containers so you get

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.540 
all on shipping containers so you get
the<00:02:15.840> maximum<00:02:16.320> amount<00:02:16.500> of<00:02:16.650> room<00:02:16.890> take<00:02:17.160> up<00:02:17.340> so

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
the maximum amount of room take up so

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.070 
the maximum amount of room take up so
you<00:02:17.760> know<00:02:17.790> more<00:02:18.090> tight<00:02:18.300> corridors<00:02:18.600> and<00:02:18.870> stuff

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
you know more tight corridors and stuff

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.790 
you know more tight corridors and stuff
like<00:02:19.200> that<00:02:22.220> contradiction<00:02:23.220> to<00:02:23.250> the

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
like that contradiction to the

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.500 
like that contradiction to the
contradiction<00:02:25.800> to<00:02:25.830> the<00:02:26.120> original<00:02:27.120> game<00:02:27.150> type

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
contradiction to the original game type

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.690 
contradiction to the original game type
is<00:02:27.720> actually<00:02:28.200> that<00:02:28.290> the<00:02:28.440> humans<00:02:28.770> can<00:02:28.920> go<00:02:29.460> over

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
is actually that the humans can go over

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.220 
is actually that the humans can go over
like<00:02:30.030> a<00:02:30.090> lot<00:02:30.300> of<00:02:30.390> the<00:02:30.480> areas<00:02:30.720> of<00:02:30.810> the<00:02:30.840> predator

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
like a lot of the areas of the predator

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.600 
like a lot of the areas of the predator
can<00:02:31.410> but<00:02:31.620> it<00:02:31.710> makes<00:02:31.860> up<00:02:32.010> for<00:02:32.130> a<00:02:32.160> lot<00:02:32.220> more<00:02:32.340> fun

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
can but it makes up for a lot more fun

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.300 
can but it makes up for a lot more fun
to<00:02:32.790> the<00:02:32.880> humans<00:02:33.510> can<00:02:33.630> calm<00:02:33.750> him<00:02:33.810> down<00:02:34.160> this<00:02:35.160> map
