00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
blue green purple orange I think that's

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.370 
blue green purple orange I think that's
it<00:01:10.229> colors<00:01:10.770> of<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:10.979> rainbow<00:01:11.100> and<00:01:11.930> each<00:01:12.930> color

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
it colors of the rainbow and each color

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.380 
it colors of the rainbow and each color
is<00:01:13.770> opposite<00:01:14.189> of<00:01:14.280> another<00:01:14.490> one<00:01:14.700> for<00:01:14.880> example

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
is opposite of another one for example

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.560 
is opposite of another one for example
orange<00:01:16.490> will<00:01:17.490> be<00:01:17.610> opposite<00:01:17.909> of<00:01:18.119> blue<00:01:18.330> and

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
orange will be opposite of blue and

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.080 
orange will be opposite of blue and
green<00:01:19.009> will<00:01:20.009> be<00:01:20.100> opposite<00:01:20.430> around<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:20.909> code

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
green will be opposite around the code

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.160 
green will be opposite around the code
wheel<00:01:21.360> so<00:01:21.630> like<00:01:21.990> that<00:01:22.850> so<00:01:23.850> with<00:01:24.119> what<00:01:24.630> color

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170
