00:00:02.073 --> 00:00:05.006
 Here we have a circular intersection. 

00:00:06.635 --> 00:00:14.751
 And we will go around it and go straight ahead, that is before this intersection, it will be necessary, but it will be directly before 

00:00:14.751 --> 00:00:22.190
 intersection, reduce two runs down, or up to 3, see if nobody is going 

00:00:22.914 --> 00:00:26.202
 and go around this crossroads for 3. 

00:00:27.592 --> 00:00:32.273
 For now, we do not discuss characters here because we are at the stage of vehicle management. 

00:00:34.993 --> 00:00:45.071
 We throw each other down to 3, we release the clutch, very gently and see if there is anything going on. 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:51.189
 We turn and go, look in the right mirror, not to catch the curb and drive ourselves 

00:00:51.655 --> 00:00:53.035
 We're going, go ahead, go ahead. 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:59.923
 And here we will go down in Opole and we must remember that we will have to let the front go further. 

00:01:01.031 --> 00:01:07.789
 We go straight ahead, we still do not shoot, now we tighten, look - we control ourselves in the mirror 

00:01:08.296 --> 00:01:10.485
 And straighten the run further. 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.427
 Here in a moment we will have a crossroad with traffic lights, where we will go to the right. 

00:01:18.003 --> 00:01:22.824
 And please note that this intersection is at a more severe angle, i.e. 

00:01:22.824 --> 00:01:29.535
 such and to fit the bus you have to break this turn for two. 

00:01:29.535 --> 00:01:33.194
 So tighten, release and tighten again. 

00:01:34.676 --> 00:01:37.319
 Turn the right turn signal. 

00:01:37.905 --> 00:01:41.980
 We drive up, we see that waiting cars are standing there. 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:50.600
 If this car does not move, we will have to avoid it, and let go of the nose behind this car. 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.040
 We will need a little space there. 

00:01:56.291 --> 00:02:00.950
 He went all the luck, but on the other hand we will not be able to practice it. 

00:02:02.355 --> 00:02:03.790
 We are waiting for the green light. 

00:02:10.035 --> 00:02:13.550
 This blinking orange man says that there were green lights. 

00:02:15.033 --> 00:02:19.710
 We drive ourselves, all the time for 2, we shoot, we shoot. 

00:02:21.244 --> 00:02:24.640
 Straighten, tighten. 

00:02:26.261 --> 00:02:28.150
 Straighten and straighten. 

00:02:29.301 --> 00:02:33.840
 Even straighten up and tighten again looking in the right mirror - it succeeded. 

00:02:34.177 --> 00:02:39.030
 And we're going, we're going straight ahead and it's still ... next gear. 

00:02:42.346 --> 00:02:46.160
 We're going, we're not going to shoot, we're not filming - the wheels are following us and 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.840
 Now we're just shooting and going.
