00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.770
 many years ago I acquired a letter 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:10.080
 original of san martín a cartography 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:12.830
 where he before leaving for Peru 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:16.289
 From Valparaíso, he 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:18.180
 caretaker of your farm that will provide 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.609
 Mrs. María Joséfa Morales of the 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.800
 rivers what she would like from the pond and 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:26.410
 to attend to him as my own wife 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:30.789
 and that caught my attention was not interesting 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:32.920
 that the fact of private life 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:36.329
 unless this had a significance 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.329
 historical and the earth 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:45.500
 the relationship between josefa and san martín 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:47.870
 it was very close that letter shows 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.440
 that I acquired that was an unpublished letter 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:54.379
 but they also show you other letters 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:58.399
 of them one that is headed my 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:01:01.000
 friend and sustenance and everything there are others 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:03.649
 elements that go in the same direction 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.850
 because it matters because 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:07.700
 It is important that there was a 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:10.130
 close relationship because then that 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:13.190
 gives historical significance to all 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:15.830
 letters that they sent them peru not 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:18.730
 was anyone has someone who 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.610
 He had become 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:23.370
 confident 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:26.280
 and counselors of san martín 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:29.460
 that seduces me from Josefa is his 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:34.650
 personality its strength its conception 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:37.380
 policy and its ability to even give it 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.810
 advice to martín 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.640
 his participation in the formation of 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:46.259
 Army of the Andes 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:50.070
 all that shows a very personal 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:53.370
 strong our attitude is that they are not in 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:58.440
 general the women of his time 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:02:00.720
 and that has stimulated me to follow the 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:04.040
 research and discover from your 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.040
 birth until his death 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:11.880
 I think it 's josefa was ignored first 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.020
 because she was a secret friend in some 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.650
 shape 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:19.950
 second why 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:22.260
 there may have been some modesty 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:25.799
 San Martinian historians in suggesting 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:28.250
 that there had been a more relationship 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:28.250
 intimate 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:34.560
 and third because nobody was dedicated to 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:37.770
 investigate nobody thought it was a 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:40.220
 important person by chance 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:43.280
 for having acquired that letter and 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.780
 find a reference that intrigued me 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.360
 the most important thing is to have made a 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.510
 Biography 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:53.930
 biography of a woman practically 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:57.170
 anonymous that was not only anonymous in life 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:59.950
 was buried in a common grave in the 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.950
 Recoleta Cemetery
