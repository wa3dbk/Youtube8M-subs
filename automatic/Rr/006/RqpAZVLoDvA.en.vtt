kind<00:02:36.599> of<00:02:36.659> like<00:02:36.810> in<00:02:36.959> a<00:02:37.049> single<00:02:37.409> focus<00:02:37.769> mode<00:02:38.010> if

00:02:38.179 --> 00:02:38.189 
kind of like in a single focus mode if

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:40.339 
kind of like in a single focus mode if
you<00:02:38.220> will<00:02:38.489> as<00:02:38.700> soon<00:02:39.299> as<00:02:39.450> your<00:02:39.629> subject<00:02:39.900> starts

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
you will as soon as your subject starts

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:42.680 
you will as soon as your subject starts
moving<00:02:40.829> the<00:02:41.370> camera<00:02:41.730> is<00:02:41.940> going<00:02:42.090> to<00:02:42.209> kick<00:02:42.450> in

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
moving the camera is going to kick in

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.259 
moving the camera is going to kick in
and<00:02:42.900> start<00:02:43.069> continuously<00:02:44.069> focusing<00:02:44.760> to<00:02:45.030> keep

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
and start continuously focusing to keep

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:48.550 
and start continuously focusing to keep
it<00:02:45.450> in<00:02:45.659> focus<00:02:45.930> so<00:02:46.730> can<00:02:47.730> you<00:02:47.819> think<00:02:47.940> of<00:02:48.060> a

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
it in focus so can you think of a

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.750 
it in focus so can you think of a
specific<00:02:49.560> time<00:02:49.769> that<00:02:49.980> I<00:02:50.010> would<00:02:50.129> want<00:02:50.400> to<00:02:50.459> be<00:02:50.579> in

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
specific time that I would want to be in

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.599 
specific time that I would want to be in
nine<00:02:51.120> points<00:02:51.659> versus<00:02:51.989> 51<00:02:52.470> points<00:02:52.980> great

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:53.609 
nine points versus 51 points great

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:55.160 
nine points versus 51 points great
question<00:02:54.150> yeah<00:02:54.299> there's<00:02:54.510> a<00:02:54.569> lot<00:02:54.750> of<00:02:54.900> times

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
question yeah there's a lot of times

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.050 
question yeah there's a lot of times
when<00:02:55.590> you've<00:02:55.799> got<00:02:55.950> a<00:02:55.980> really<00:02:56.430> really<00:02:56.760> busy

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
when you've got a really really busy

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.199 
when you've got a really really busy
scene<00:02:58.019> and<00:02:58.319> even<00:02:59.099> though<00:02:59.280> it's<00:02:59.489> using<00:02:59.909> the<00:03:00.000> D

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
scene and even though it's using the D

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.660 
scene and even though it's using the D
technology<00:03:01.049> and<00:03:01.230> the<00:03:01.290> G<00:03:01.560> technology<00:03:02.250> looking

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
technology and the G technology looking

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.330 
technology and the G technology looking
for<00:03:02.939> specific<00:03:03.629> contrast<00:03:04.439> the<00:03:04.650> scene<00:03:04.859> between

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
for specific contrast the scene between

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.119 
for specific contrast the scene between
the<00:03:05.579> subject<00:03:06.120> and<00:03:06.239> the<00:03:06.359> background<00:03:06.769> if<00:03:07.769> you've

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:08.129 
the subject and the background if you've

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:10.339 
the subject and the background if you've
got<00:03:08.280> a<00:03:08.310> lot<00:03:08.700> of<00:03:08.909> information<00:03:09.359> happening<00:03:10.230> in

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:10.349 
got a lot of information happening in

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:13.099 
got a lot of information happening in
that<00:03:10.500> frame<00:03:10.889> you<00:03:11.519> can<00:03:11.730> narrow<00:03:12.030> down<00:03:12.420> the<00:03:12.689> area

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:13.109 
that frame you can narrow down the area

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:15.140 
that frame you can narrow down the area
say<00:03:13.500> a<00:03:13.530> group<00:03:13.889> of<00:03:14.099> birds<00:03:14.370> are<00:03:14.579> flying<00:03:14.730> and<00:03:15.060> I

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
say a group of birds are flying and I

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.199 
say a group of birds are flying and I
focused<00:03:15.569> on<00:03:15.690> a<00:03:15.720> specific<00:03:16.379> one<00:03:16.590> if<00:03:16.919> I<00:03:17.430> if<00:03:17.760> I<00:03:17.970> make

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
focused on a specific one if I if I make

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.150 
focused on a specific one if I if I make
that<00:03:18.449> setting<00:03:18.900> or<00:03:19.049> the<00:03:19.079> number<00:03:19.709> of<00:03:19.829> focus

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
that setting or the number of focus

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.699 
that setting or the number of focus
points<00:03:20.489> active<00:03:20.940> smaller<00:03:21.389> it's<00:03:22.260> going<00:03:22.379> to<00:03:22.560> make

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
points active smaller it's going to make

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:24.740 
points active smaller it's going to make
sure<00:03:22.739> that<00:03:22.980> just<00:03:23.489> what's<00:03:23.760> within<00:03:24.120> that<00:03:24.329> areas

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
sure that just what's within that areas

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.619 
sure that just what's within that areas
in<00:03:24.930> focus<00:03:25.409> so<00:03:25.849> again<00:03:26.849> though<00:03:27.030> if<00:03:27.209> you've<00:03:27.419> got<00:03:27.599> a

00:03:27.619 --> 00:03:27.629 
in focus so again though if you've got a

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:29.839 
in focus so again though if you've got a
situation<00:03:27.930> where<00:03:28.440> maybe<00:03:29.370> you're<00:03:29.669> just

00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:29.849 
situation where maybe you're just

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:32.420 
situation where maybe you're just
learning<00:03:30.359> panning<00:03:30.930> on<00:03:31.049> a<00:03:31.169> sporting<00:03:31.739> situation

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
learning panning on a sporting situation

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.360 
learning panning on a sporting situation
or<00:03:32.549> wildlife<00:03:33.120> the<00:03:33.780> more<00:03:34.049> active<00:03:34.560> focus<00:03:34.949> points

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
or wildlife the more active focus points

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.159 
or wildlife the more active focus points
the<00:03:35.609> more<00:03:35.819> chance<00:03:36.180> you<00:03:36.299> have<00:03:36.389> the<00:03:36.810> cameras

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:37.169 
the more chance you have the cameras

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:39.770 
the more chance you have the cameras
going<00:03:37.349> to<00:03:37.560> lock<00:03:38.190> on<00:03:38.459> and<00:03:38.760> keep<00:03:39.150> it<00:03:39.329> in<00:03:39.510> focus

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
going to lock on and keep it in focus

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.930 
going to lock on and keep it in focus
even<00:03:40.199> if<00:03:40.290> it<00:03:40.379> moves<00:03:40.620> way<00:03:41.069> out<00:03:41.250> of<00:03:41.400> your<00:03:41.549> target

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.960 
even if it moves way out of your target
area<00:03:42.139> this<00:03:43.139> also<00:03:43.319> affects<00:03:43.519> just<00:03:44.519> the<00:03:44.729> number

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970

time I hit the cursor to change focus
points<00:03:49.400> it<00:03:50.400> correct<00:03:51.150> so<00:03:51.510> so<00:03:52.139> if<00:03:52.229> I<00:03:52.290> wanted<00:03:52.560> to

okay<00:04:04.979> now<00:04:05.220> we're<00:04:05.430> getting<00:04:05.549> to<00:04:05.729> things<00:04:06.150> mixed

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:06.449 
okay now we're getting to things mixed

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:08.270 
okay now we're getting to things mixed
up<00:04:06.629> which<00:04:06.840> that's<00:04:07.019> great<00:04:07.409> question<00:04:07.919> because<00:04:08.250> a

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
up which that's great question because a

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.000 
up which that's great question because a
lot<00:04:08.549> of<00:04:08.579> people<00:04:09.030> have<00:04:09.209> that<00:04:09.359> same<00:04:09.599> situation

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.010 
lot of people have that same situation

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:12.140 
lot of people have that same situation
when<00:04:11.010> you're<00:04:11.159> in<00:04:11.250> the<00:04:11.340> dynamic<00:04:11.970> you've

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
when you're in the dynamic you've

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:17.180 
when you're in the dynamic you've
pre-selected<00:04:12.900> the<00:04:13.019> one<00:04:13.229> focus<00:04:13.739> and<00:04:16.190> it's

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
pre-selected the one focus and it's

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.250 
pre-selected the one focus and it's
picking<00:04:17.609> all<00:04:17.760> the<00:04:17.789> ones<00:04:18.090> around<00:04:18.239> it<00:04:18.690> based<00:04:18.959> on

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
picking all the ones around it based on

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.210 
picking all the ones around it based on
just<00:04:19.889> a<00:04:20.010> cluster

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:21.220 
just a cluster

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:22.890 
just a cluster
the<00:04:21.610> part<00:04:21.880> you're<00:04:22.000> talking<00:04:22.420> about<00:04:22.540> is<00:04:22.750> when

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
the part you're talking about is when

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.230 
the part you're talking about is when
we're<00:04:23.080> in<00:04:23.260> the<00:04:23.470> single<00:04:23.770> focus<00:04:24.310> point<00:04:24.610> mode<00:04:24.970> and

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
we're in the single focus point mode and

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.960 
we're in the single focus point mode and
we<00:04:25.780> want<00:04:25.990> to<00:04:26.140> scoop<00:04:26.800> from<00:04:26.950> one<00:04:27.190> to<00:04:27.370> the<00:04:27.400> other

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
we want to scoop from one to the other

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.150 
we want to scoop from one to the other
the<00:04:28.330> fewer<00:04:28.600> focus<00:04:29.110> points<00:04:29.440> the<00:04:29.530> easier<00:04:29.950> it<00:04:30.070> is

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 
the fewer focus points the easier it is

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.890 
the fewer focus points the easier it is
to<00:04:30.220> get<00:04:30.490> from<00:04:30.670> one<00:04:30.850> end<00:04:30.880> to<00:04:31.120> the<00:04:31.240> other<00:04:31.360> and

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:31.900 
to get from one end to the other and

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.020 
to get from one end to the other and
there<00:04:32.290> are<00:04:32.410> times<00:04:32.680> when<00:04:33.010> I'll<00:04:33.280> have<00:04:33.490> all<00:04:33.640> fifty

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
there are times when I'll have all fifty

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:35.760 
there are times when I'll have all fifty
one<00:04:34.180> active<00:04:34.660> or<00:04:34.900> there's<00:04:35.260> times<00:04:35.500> when<00:04:35.740> I

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.770 
one active or there's times when I

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:37.890 
one active or there's times when I
actually<00:04:36.130> go<00:04:36.580> to<00:04:36.610> smaller<00:04:37.150> areas<00:04:37.300> simply

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
actually go to smaller areas simply

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.380 
actually go to smaller areas simply
because<00:04:38.380> cycling<00:04:39.160> through<00:04:39.310> all<00:04:39.520> those<00:04:39.700> can

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:40.390 
because cycling through all those can

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:41.850 
because cycling through all those can
take<00:04:40.570> time<00:04:40.840> and<00:04:41.080> I<00:04:41.170> might<00:04:41.350> miss<00:04:41.530> a<00:04:41.590> shot

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
take time and I might miss a shot

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.100 
take time and I might miss a shot
because<00:04:42.070> of<00:04:42.250> that<00:04:42.550> but<00:04:43.390> great<00:04:43.570> I'm<00:04:43.810> glad<00:04:43.930> you

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
brought that because we do get that

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:50.280 
brought that because we do get that
question<00:04:45.910> a<00:04:46.180> lot<00:04:46.210> a<00:04:47.820> four<00:04:48.820> focus<00:04:49.750> tracking

how<00:05:08.080> long<00:05:08.350> the<00:05:08.560> camera<00:05:08.980> waits<00:05:09.250> before<00:05:09.580> it

how long the camera waits before it

tries to reacquire focus and again this

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:15.570 
tries to reacquire focus and again this
is<00:05:13.210> a<00:05:13.240> real<00:05:13.540> individual<00:05:14.140> thing<00:05:14.770> but<00:05:15.130> for<00:05:15.400> my

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:15.580 
is a real individual thing but for my

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:17.520 
is a real individual thing but for my
shooting<00:05:16.060> style<00:05:16.420> and<00:05:16.660> purposes<00:05:17.140> I've<00:05:17.290> got

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:17.530 
shooting style and purposes I've got

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:20.160

that<00:05:17.710> set<00:05:17.980> for<00:05:18.190> short<00:05:18.520> but<00:05:19.300> it's<00:05:19.510> again<00:05:19.870> like<00:05:19.900> I

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:20.170 
that set for short but it's again like I

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:22.350 
that set for short but it's again like I
say<00:05:20.320> the<00:05:20.470> cameras<00:05:20.830> in<00:05:20.980> focus<00:05:21.460> something

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:22.360 
say the cameras in focus something

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.840 
say the cameras in focus something
blocks<00:05:22.660> it<00:05:22.960> so<00:05:23.320> it<00:05:23.470> kicks<00:05:23.800> out<00:05:24.040> of<00:05:24.340> focus

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:24.850 
blocks it so it kicks out of focus

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:26.790 
blocks it so it kicks out of focus
how<00:05:25.240> long<00:05:25.450> before<00:05:25.660> it<00:05:25.840> says<00:05:26.110> okay<00:05:26.470> I<00:05:26.500> got<00:05:26.680> to

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:26.800 
how long before it says okay I got to

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.190 
how long before it says okay I got to
reacquire<00:05:27.220> focus<00:05:27.820> I<00:05:28.000> want<00:05:28.300> it<00:05:28.600> to<00:05:28.690> be<00:05:28.840> really

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:29.200 
reacquire focus I want it to be really

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.140 
reacquire focus I want it to be really
responsive<00:05:29.830> and<00:05:29.919> fast<00:05:30.130> so<00:05:30.400> I<00:05:30.430> have<00:05:30.730> that<00:05:30.910> set

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:31.150 
responsive and fast so I have that set
