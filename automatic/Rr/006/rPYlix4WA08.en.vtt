the CB radio magazine calm and somebody

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:15.409 
the CB radio magazine calm and somebody
had<00:00:12.419> a<00:00:12.450> question<00:00:12.900> about<00:00:13.129> the<00:00:14.150> frequency<00:00:15.150> band

00:00:15.409 --> 00:00:15.419 
had a question about the frequency band

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:17.870 
had a question about the frequency band
and<00:00:15.660> changing<00:00:16.170> around<00:00:16.260> on<00:00:17.100> the<00:00:17.310> new<00:00:17.400> President

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
and changing around on the new President

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.650 
and changing around on the new President
Grant<00:00:18.150> to<00:00:19.400> to<00:00:20.400> navigate<00:00:20.550> from<00:00:21.000> one<00:00:21.180> band<00:00:21.420> to

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
Grant to to navigate from one band to

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.490 
Grant to to navigate from one band to
the<00:00:21.779> other<00:00:21.960> you<00:00:22.619> do<00:00:22.800> have<00:00:23.039> to<00:00:23.220> hold<00:00:23.369> in<00:00:24.289> and<00:00:25.289> the

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
the other you do have to hold in and the

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.480 
the other you do have to hold in and the
F<00:00:25.619> button<00:00:27.019> you<00:00:28.019> hold<00:00:28.199> this<00:00:28.349> in<00:00:28.590> you<00:00:29.130> can<00:00:29.279> switch

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
F button you hold this in you can switch

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:37.459 
F button you hold this in you can switch
to<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.699> next<00:00:30.000> band<00:00:33.920> now<00:00:35.450> someone<00:00:36.450> said<00:00:37.320> to<00:00:37.350> me

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
to the next band now someone said to me

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.470 
to the next band now someone said to me
well<00:00:37.800> they<00:00:37.890> prefer<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.579> old-style<00:00:38.940> radio

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
well they prefer the old-style radio

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.930 
well they prefer the old-style radio
where<00:00:39.690> you<00:00:39.780> had<00:00:39.989> just<00:00:40.260> a<00:00:40.379> switch<00:00:40.680> that<00:00:41.010> would

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
where you had just a switch that would

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.459 
where you had just a switch that would
flip<00:00:42.210> between<00:00:42.360> all<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.780> bands<00:00:42.989> they<00:00:43.230> said<00:00:43.440> oh

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
flip between all the bands they said oh

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.490 
flip between all the bands they said oh
that<00:00:43.770> seems<00:00:44.039> easier<00:00:44.610> than<00:00:44.940> trying<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.360> go<00:00:46.260> back

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
that seems easier than trying to go back

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.119 
that seems easier than trying to go back
and<00:00:46.710> forth

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
and forth

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.910 
and forth
well<00:00:47.789> one<00:00:48.329> actually<00:00:48.750> easy<00:00:49.170> way<00:00:49.469> to<00:00:49.530> do<00:00:49.770> this

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
well one actually easy way to do this

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.160 
well one actually easy way to do this
that<00:00:50.129> I<00:00:50.250> found<00:00:50.520> is<00:00:51.390> by<00:00:51.600> using<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.989> memory

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
that I found is by using the memory

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.069 
that I found is by using the memory
frequencies<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:53.609> memory<00:00:54.300> frequencies<00:00:54.899> on

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
frequencies the memory frequencies on

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.500 
frequencies the memory frequencies on
this<00:00:55.230> radio<00:00:55.469> saves<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.460> mode<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:57.210> the

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
this radio saves the mode and the

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.020 
this radio saves the mode and the
frequency<00:00:58.109> so<00:00:58.739> what<00:00:59.280> you<00:00:59.399> can<00:00:59.550> do<00:00:59.699> is

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
frequency so what you can do is

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.910 
frequency so what you can do is
initially<00:01:00.750> you'll<00:01:00.899> have<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.230> navigate<00:01:01.379> and

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
initially you'll have to navigate and

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.030 
initially you'll have to navigate and
save<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.340> frequencies<00:01:02.879> in<00:01:03.180> each<00:01:03.390> band<00:01:04.019> so<00:01:04.860> in

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
save the frequencies in each band so in

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.890 
save the frequencies in each band so in
the<00:01:05.130> a<00:01:05.160> band<00:01:05.670> which<00:01:05.880> is<00:01:06.030> your<00:01:06.180> standard<00:01:06.510> CB

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
the a band which is your standard CB

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.220 
the a band which is your standard CB
band<00:01:07.140> you<00:01:07.770> need<00:01:07.980> to<00:01:08.100> save<00:01:08.340> say<00:01:08.970> do<00:01:09.420> memory<00:01:09.810> make

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:10.230 
band you need to save say do memory make

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:12.470 
band you need to save say do memory make
sure<00:01:10.350> your<00:01:10.470> lower<00:01:10.680> sideband<00:01:11.010> 38<00:01:11.760> then<00:01:12.360> you

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:12.480 
sure your lower sideband 38 then you

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.990 
sure your lower sideband 38 then you
save<00:01:12.660> that<00:01:12.870> to<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.050> memory<00:01:13.440> one<00:01:13.650> location<00:01:14.340> and

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
save that to the memory one location and

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.940 
save that to the memory one location and
you<00:01:15.090> can<00:01:15.150> see<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.420> M<00:01:15.540> one<00:01:15.780> up<00:01:15.930> there<00:01:16.170> then<00:01:16.710> say

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
you can see the M one up there then say

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.390 
you can see the M one up there then say
you<00:01:17.010> want<00:01:17.280> to<00:01:17.370> do<00:01:17.460> free<00:01:17.760> band<00:01:17.970> 27<00:01:18.720> 555<00:01:19.680> you

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
you want to do free band 27 555 you

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.910 
you want to do free band 27 555 you
would<00:01:20.550> set<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:20.940> memory<00:01:21.300> and<00:01:21.510> the<00:01:21.990> second<00:01:22.410> M<00:01:22.530> 2

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
would set the memory and the second M 2

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.610 
would set the memory and the second M 2
and<00:01:23.390> then<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.510> same<00:01:24.690> thing<00:01:24.930> for<00:01:25.140> say<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.470> ham

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:25.620 
and then the same thing for say the ham

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.860 
and then the same thing for say the ham
radio<00:01:25.650> band<00:01:26.160> so<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.790> end<00:01:26.970> result<00:01:27.150> is<00:01:27.600> right

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:27.870 
radio band so the end result is right

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.620 
radio band so the end result is right
now<00:01:28.050> we're<00:01:28.260> on<00:01:28.290> band<00:01:28.680> a<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.270> we<00:01:30.270> can<00:01:30.420> flip

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
now we're on band a and we can flip

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.020 
now we're on band a and we can flip
around<00:01:30.750> you<00:01:31.200> can<00:01:31.350> do<00:01:31.470> memory<00:01:31.890> M<00:01:32.160> 2<00:01:32.760> we've

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
around you can do memory M 2 we've

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.210 
around you can do memory M 2 we've
switched<00:01:33.210> up<00:01:33.510> now<00:01:34.470> we're<00:01:34.620> in<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.770> free<00:01:34.980> band

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
switched up now we're in the free band

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.300 
switched up now we're in the free band
and<00:01:36.440> let's<00:01:37.440> say<00:01:37.530> you<00:01:37.620> want<00:01:37.770> to<00:01:37.830> go<00:01:37.920> up<00:01:38.010> to<00:01:38.160> ham

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
and let's say you want to go up to ham

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.570 
and let's say you want to go up to ham
radio<00:01:38.640> van<00:01:39.080> there<00:01:40.080> you<00:01:40.170> go<00:01:40.290> up<00:01:40.350> to<00:01:40.440> 10<00:01:40.590> meters

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:43.580 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.020 

so<00:01:44.580> that<00:01:44.610> is<00:01:44.940> a<00:01:45.270> pretty<00:01:45.450> quick<00:01:45.720> way<00:01:45.900> to<00:01:45.930> do<00:01:46.230> it

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
so that is a pretty quick way to do it

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.490 
so that is a pretty quick way to do it
so<00:01:48.030> if<00:01:48.330> you've<00:01:48.420> got<00:01:48.510> five<00:01:48.780> different<00:01:49.080> memory

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
so if you've got five different memory

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.340 
so if you've got five different memory
frequencies<00:01:50.040> you<00:01:50.130> could<00:01:50.280> save<00:01:50.460> in<00:01:51.080> in<00:01:52.080> most

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
frequencies you could save in in most

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.340 
frequencies you could save in in most
cases<00:01:52.590> most<00:01:52.920> people<00:01:53.250> would<00:01:53.370> only<00:01:53.550> be<00:01:53.790> in

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
cases most people would only be in

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.580 
cases most people would only be in
either<00:01:55.350> a<00:01:55.740> band<00:01:56.010> down<00:01:56.880> from<00:01:57.480> the<00:01:57.660> CB<00:01:58.140> beyond<00:01:58.380> or

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
either a band down from the CB beyond or

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.490 
either a band down from the CB beyond or
possibly<00:01:59.180> in<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.360> CB<00:02:00.630> band<00:02:00.840> and<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.320> free

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
possibly in the CB band and the free

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.350 
possibly in the CB band and the free
band<00:02:01.740> and<00:02:02.040> a<00:02:02.250> 10<00:02:02.580> meter<00:02:02.790> band<00:02:03.030> so<00:02:03.210> those

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
band and a 10 meter band so those

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.520 
band and a 10 meter band so those
probably<00:02:03.600> only<00:02:03.750> you<00:02:03.960> only<00:02:04.080> need<00:02:04.230> the<00:02:04.320> four

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
probably only you only need the four

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.050 
probably only you only need the four
memory<00:02:04.710> channels<00:02:04.980> really<00:02:05.340> to<00:02:05.550> get<00:02:05.670> you<00:02:05.880> if

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
memory channels really to get you if

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.190 
memory channels really to get you if
you're<00:02:06.300> going<00:02:06.390> to<00:02:06.480> use<00:02:06.630> this<00:02:06.750> method<00:02:07.170> to

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
you're going to use this method to

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.160 
you're going to use this method to
quickly<00:02:08.039> flip<00:02:08.759> between<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.780> other<00:02:09.899> cool

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
quickly flip between the other cool

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.070 
quickly flip between the other cool
thing<00:02:10.440> is<00:02:10.880> once<00:02:11.880> you<00:02:12.060> do<00:02:12.270> this<00:02:12.480> and<00:02:12.750> you<00:02:12.840> enter

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
thing is once you do this and you enter

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.830 
thing is once you do this and you enter
that<00:02:13.230> mode

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
that mode

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:19.790 
that mode
we<00:02:14.140> can<00:02:14.319> also<00:02:14.500> go<00:02:14.800> into<00:02:15.040> the<00:02:15.280> scan<00:02:16.470> function

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.850 

oops<00:02:21.360> let<00:02:22.360> me<00:02:22.560> there

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
oops let me there

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:29.940 
oops let me there
turn<00:02:24.220> up<00:02:24.340> the<00:02:24.520> squelch<00:02:28.410> and<00:02:29.410> we<00:02:29.560> should<00:02:29.770> be

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
turn up the squelch and we should be

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.500 
turn up the squelch and we should be
able<00:02:30.069> to<00:02:30.220> start<00:02:30.580> scanning<00:02:30.849> if<00:02:31.120> I<00:02:31.209> held<00:02:31.390> that

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
able to start scanning if I held that

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.150 
able to start scanning if I held that
incorrectly<00:02:31.989> there<00:02:32.200> we<00:02:32.290> go<00:02:32.410> all<00:02:33.040> right<00:02:33.069> so

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
incorrectly there we go all right so

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.270 
incorrectly there we go all right so
right<00:02:33.489> now<00:02:33.640> it's<00:02:33.819> scanning<00:02:34.060> through<00:02:34.480> band<00:02:34.900> a

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
right now it's scanning through band a

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.089 
right now it's scanning through band a
but<00:02:36.280> actually<00:02:36.640> if<00:02:36.700> we<00:02:36.790> hit<00:02:36.910> memory<00:02:37.650> now<00:02:38.650> it's

00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:39.099 
but actually if we hit memory now it's

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:41.160 
but actually if we hit memory now it's
scanning<00:02:39.489> through<00:02:40.000> the<00:02:40.510> different<00:02:40.810> bands<00:02:40.989> you

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
scanning through the different bands you

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.770 
scanning through the different bands you
can<00:02:41.200> see<00:02:41.380> scanning<00:02:41.860> a<00:02:42.099> ban<00:02:42.340> B<00:02:42.819> band<00:02:43.090> and<00:02:43.330> F<00:02:43.510> band

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
can see scanning a ban B band and F band

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:49.140 
can see scanning a ban B band and F band
so<00:02:43.989> it's<00:02:44.170> scanning<00:02:45.660> 38:5<00:02:46.660> it's<00:02:47.230> scanning<00:02:48.150> up

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
so it's scanning 38:5 it's scanning up

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.440 
so it's scanning 38:5 it's scanning up
in<00:02:49.299> the<00:02:49.390> free<00:02:49.569> band<00:02:49.780> so<00:02:50.680> cool<00:02:51.549> all<00:02:52.030> right<00:02:52.120> all

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
in the free band so cool all right all

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:52.650 
in the free band so cool all right all
right

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
right

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.740 
right
anyway<00:02:53.560> that's<00:02:54.069> so<00:02:54.370> we<00:02:54.760> got<00:02:54.880> going<00:02:55.150> on<00:02:55.269> I<00:02:55.540> just

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
anyway that's so we got going on I just

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:56.880 
anyway that's so we got going on I just
want<00:02:55.900> to<00:02:55.989> show<00:02:56.110> you<00:02:56.200> guys<00:02:56.380> some<00:02:56.560> of<00:02:56.680> that<00:02:56.739> to

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
want to show you guys some of that to

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:58.770 
want to show you guys some of that to
answer<00:02:57.010> the<00:02:57.220> questions<00:02:57.670> about<00:02:57.910> how<00:02:58.269> easy<00:02:58.540> it

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
answer the questions about how easy it

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.390 
answer the questions about how easy it
is<00:02:58.840> to<00:02:59.019> flip<00:02:59.440> between<00:02:59.560> the<00:02:59.860> bands<00:03:00.130> on<00:03:00.250> this

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
is to flip between the bands on this

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.089 
is to flip between the bands on this
radio<00:03:01.049> with<00:03:02.049> the<00:03:02.170> memory<00:03:02.410> frequencies<00:03:02.890> makes

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:03.099 
radio with the memory frequencies makes

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:06.690 
radio with the memory frequencies makes
it<00:03:03.280> really<00:03:03.430> easy<00:03:03.519> so<00:03:04.560> keep<00:03:05.560> one's<00:03:06.160> coming<00:03:06.489> and

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
it really easy so keep one's coming and

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.430 
it really easy so keep one's coming and
we'll<00:03:07.180> keep<00:03:07.299> trying<00:03:07.540> to<00:03:07.720> answer<00:03:07.750> and<00:03:08.230> get<00:03:08.319> more

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
we'll keep trying to answer and get more

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:09.990 
we'll keep trying to answer and get more
information<00:03:08.920> on<00:03:09.010> this<00:03:09.130> radio<00:03:09.370> out<00:03:09.640> thanks

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
information on this radio out thanks

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.150 
information on this radio out thanks
guys
