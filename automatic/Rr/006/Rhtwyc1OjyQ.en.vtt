we're<00:00:42.760> doing<00:00:42.940> is<00:00:43.000> performing<00:00:43.239> servos<00:00:43.720> we're

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:44.589 
we're doing is performing servos we're

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:46.200 
we're doing is performing servos we're
really<00:00:44.799> sort<00:00:45.010> of<00:00:45.040> branched<00:00:45.369> out<00:00:45.519> yeah<00:00:45.879> we<00:00:46.030> have

look to it we got the brushed aluminum

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.749 
look to it we got the brushed aluminum
compressor<00:01:14.020> housing<00:01:14.170> and<00:01:14.649> most<00:01:15.369> importantly

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:15.759 
compressor housing and most importantly

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:18.389 
compressor housing and most importantly
new<00:01:15.939> for<00:01:16.149> 2012<00:01:16.689> we<00:01:17.439> changed<00:01:17.469> the<00:01:17.920> compressor

00:01:18.389 --> 00:01:18.399 
new for 2012 we changed the compressor

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:20.219 
new for 2012 we changed the compressor
wheel<00:01:18.579> design<00:01:18.939> so<00:01:19.509> now<00:01:19.689> that<00:01:19.750> you're<00:01:20.079> going<00:01:20.200> to

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:20.229 
wheel design so now that you're going to

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:21.330 
wheel design so now that you're going to
get<00:01:20.320> a<00:01:20.380> new<00:01:20.560> compressor<00:01:20.829> wheel<00:01:21.130> that's<00:01:21.280> going

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
get a new compressor wheel that's going

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.190 
get a new compressor wheel that's going
to<00:01:21.490> be<00:01:21.609> more<00:01:22.030> durable<00:01:22.210> and<00:01:22.719> also<00:01:23.109> the

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
to be more durable and also the

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.389 
to be more durable and also the
aerodynamics<00:01:23.829> going<00:01:23.950> to<00:01:24.009> be<00:01:24.070> even<00:01:24.189> better

00:01:24.389 --> 00:01:24.399 
aerodynamics going to be even better

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:26.669 
aerodynamics going to be even better
than<00:01:24.579> the<00:01:24.789> ones<00:01:25.359> we<00:01:25.479> had<00:01:25.659> before<00:01:25.689> what<00:01:26.560> are

00:01:26.669 --> 00:01:26.679 
than the ones we had before what are

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:27.840 
than the ones we had before what are
some<00:01:26.770> of<00:01:26.829> the<00:01:26.920> advantages<00:01:27.009> of<00:01:27.369> choosing<00:01:27.490> this
