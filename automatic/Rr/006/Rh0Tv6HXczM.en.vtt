story<00:00:18.480> to<00:00:19.220> story<00:00:20.220> from<00:00:21.150> what<00:00:21.509> I<00:00:21.539> will<00:00:21.750> call<00:00:21.900> the

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
story to story from what I will call the

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:30.420 
story to story from what I will call the
outside<00:00:22.470> from<00:00:22.859> mainstream<00:00:23.130> science

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:30.430 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:33.850 

the<00:00:31.430> question<00:00:31.910> tonight<00:00:32.090> is<00:00:32.240> does<00:00:33.170> Ken<00:00:33.560> hams

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:33.860 
the question tonight is does Ken hams

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.080 
the question tonight is does Ken hams
creation<00:00:34.010> model<00:00:34.640> hold<00:00:35.150> up<00:00:35.390> is<00:00:36.020> it<00:00:36.560> viable<00:00:37.090> so

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:38.090 
creation model hold up is it viable so

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:39.490 
creation model hold up is it viable so
let<00:00:38.180> me<00:00:38.300> ask<00:00:38.420> you<00:00:38.570> what<00:00:38.900> would<00:00:38.989> you<00:00:39.170> be<00:00:39.320> doing

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 
me if Ken hams creation model is viable

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.340 
me if Ken hams creation model is viable
I<00:00:57.230> say<00:00:57.800> no<00:00:57.980> it<00:00:58.550> is<00:00:58.580> absolutely<00:00:58.850> not<00:00:59.330> see<00:01:00.199> when
