is using a paint effects brush painting
on<00:00:14.639> my<00:00:14.670> model<00:00:15.150> then<00:00:15.480> taking<00:00:15.870> those<00:00:16.020> paint

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
on my model then taking those paint

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.370 
on my model then taking those paint
effects<00:00:16.560> tweaking<00:00:17.430> those<00:00:17.520> paint<00:00:17.789> effects<00:00:18.090> and

effects tweaking those paint effects and
then<00:00:19.380> converting<00:00:19.949> them<00:00:20.070> to<00:00:20.100> polygon<00:00:20.670> geometry

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
then converting them to polygon geometry

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.870 
then converting them to polygon geometry
so<00:00:21.600> it<00:00:21.660> can<00:00:21.779> be<00:00:21.900> rendered<00:00:22.109> in<00:00:22.380> mentoring<00:00:22.880> so

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
so it can be rendered in mentoring so

now my I should take a quick second and
then<00:01:07.890> generate<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.400> geometry<00:01:08.939> I'll<00:01:09.750> go<00:01:09.869> back

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
then generate the geometry I'll go back

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.320 
then generate the geometry I'll go back
to<00:01:10.140> my<00:01:10.229> select<00:01:10.560> tool<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:11.150> open<00:01:12.150> up<00:01:12.210> the

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
mean excuse me set the smoothing to ten

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.020 
mean excuse me set the smoothing to ten
and<00:01:43.290> this<00:01:44.040> will<00:01:44.220> smooth<00:01:44.520> out<00:01:44.670> any<00:01:44.820> of<00:01:44.939> the

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
and this will smooth out any of the

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.120 
and this will smooth out any of the
wrinkles<00:01:45.450> or<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:46.140> little<00:01:46.350> blips<00:01:46.829> you<00:01:46.979> might

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
wrinkles or the little blips you might

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.889 
wrinkles or the little blips you might
have<00:01:47.220> had<00:01:47.399> when<00:01:47.610> you<00:01:47.640> are<00:01:47.909> drawing<00:01:48.540> up<00:01:48.750> your

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
have had when you are drawing up your

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.679 
have had when you are drawing up your
stroke<00:01:49.229> in<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.439> FASTA<00:01:49.740> place<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:50.540> now<00:01:51.540> we're

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
stroke in the FASTA place and now we're

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.840 
stroke in the FASTA place and now we're
going<00:01:51.840> to<00:01:51.899> move<00:01:52.110> over<00:01:52.409> to<00:01:52.439> our<00:01:52.829> grass<00:01:53.430> clump

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
going to move over to our grass clump

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.920 
going to move over to our grass clump
one<00:01:54.119> tab<00:01:54.530> or<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.590> actual<00:01:56.009> brush<00:01:56.159> tab<00:01:56.399> itself

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
one tab or the actual brush tab itself

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.510 
one tab or the actual brush tab itself
now<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.049> first<00:01:58.500> thing<00:01:58.680> you<00:01:58.799> need<00:01:58.950> to<00:01:58.979> do<00:01:59.159> is<00:01:59.369> go

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
now the first thing you need to do is go

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.120 
now the first thing you need to do is go
to<00:01:59.549> your<00:01:59.759> brush<00:02:00.270> profile<00:02:00.930> and<00:02:01.560> you<00:02:01.860> probably

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
to your brush profile and you probably

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.230 
to your brush profile and you probably
want<00:02:02.310> to<00:02:02.399> reduce<00:02:02.579> the<00:02:02.790> width<00:02:04.850> well<00:02:05.850> going<00:02:06.119> to

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
want to reduce the width well going to

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.940 
want to reduce the width well going to
settle<00:02:06.509> which<00:02:06.659> to<00:02:06.869> right<00:02:07.020> about<00:02:07.200> there<00:02:07.740> and<00:02:07.890> he

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
settle which to right about there and he

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.570 
settle which to right about there and he
has<00:02:08.069> a<00:02:08.099> pretty<00:02:08.310> thin<00:02:08.640> eyebrow

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
has a pretty thin eyebrow

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.580 
has a pretty thin eyebrow
and<00:02:09.670> now<00:02:10.390> the<00:02:10.780> next<00:02:10.869> attributes<00:02:11.380> you<00:02:11.440> should

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
and now the next attributes you should

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.800 
and now the next attributes you should
concern<00:02:11.860> yourself<00:02:11.920> with<00:02:12.430> all<00:02:12.850> the<00:02:13.210> tubes<00:02:13.480> and

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
concern yourself with all the tubes and

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.110 
concern yourself with all the tubes and
this<00:02:14.200> basically<00:02:14.710> tells<00:02:14.890> me<00:02:15.100> how<00:02:15.460> to<00:02:15.520> create

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
this basically tells me how to create

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.050 
this basically tells me how to create
your<00:02:16.270> eyebrows<00:02:16.660> so<00:02:17.440> the<00:02:18.060> important

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
your eyebrows so the important

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.850 
your eyebrows so the important
attributes<00:02:19.210> here<00:02:19.690> are<00:02:19.930> the<00:02:20.170> tubes<00:02:20.380> per<00:02:20.620> step

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
attributes here are the tubes per step

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.130 
attributes here are the tubes per step
attributes<00:02:21.820> because<00:02:22.240> if<00:02:22.450> you<00:02:22.540> increase<00:02:22.870> this

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
attributes because if you increase this

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.540 
attributes because if you increase this
you'll<00:02:23.530> increase<00:02:23.740> the<00:02:23.980> density<00:02:24.130> of<00:02:24.430> his

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
you'll increase the density of his

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.030 
you'll increase the density of his
eyebrows<00:02:24.940> and<00:02:25.300> then<00:02:25.990> the<00:02:26.110> next<00:02:26.320> value<00:02:26.590> here<00:02:26.890> is

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
eyebrows and then the next value here is

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.340 
eyebrows and then the next value here is
segments<00:02:27.640> now<00:02:28.210> in<00:02:28.480> most<00:02:28.660> cases<00:02:28.930> you'll

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
segments now in most cases you'll

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:30.510 
segments now in most cases you'll
probably<00:02:29.650> just<00:02:29.830> want<00:02:30.100> to<00:02:30.160> set<00:02:30.340> this<00:02:30.460> to

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
probably just want to set this to

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.580 
probably just want to set this to
something<00:02:31.150> lower<00:02:31.300> than<00:02:31.450> nine<00:02:31.810> in<00:02:32.170> my<00:02:32.380> case

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
something lower than nine in my case

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.380 
something lower than nine in my case
I'll<00:02:32.740> be<00:02:32.830> using<00:02:32.950> four<00:02:33.340> you<00:02:33.940> could<00:02:34.060> probably<00:02:34.210> in

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
I'll be using four you could probably in

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:35.850 
I'll be using four you could probably in
some<00:02:34.510> cases<00:02:34.750> go<00:02:35.050> all<00:02:35.110> the<00:02:35.230> way<00:02:35.320> down<00:02:35.470> to<00:02:35.650> one

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
some cases go all the way down to one

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.460 
some cases go all the way down to one
and<00:02:36.550> the<00:02:37.300> next<00:02:37.450> value<00:02:37.630> we<00:02:37.900> want<00:02:38.080> to<00:02:38.170> look<00:02:38.290> at

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
and the next value we want to look at

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.280 
and the next value we want to look at
here<00:02:38.770> is<00:02:38.950> the<00:02:39.370> length<00:02:39.550> and<00:02:39.940> normally<00:02:40.930> I<00:02:40.960> set

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
here is the length and normally I set

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.940 
here is the length and normally I set
the<00:02:41.410> length<00:02:41.680> minimum<00:02:42.190> to<00:02:42.840> 0.01<00:02:43.840> and<00:02:44.080> the

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
the length minimum to 0.01 and the

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.540 
the length minimum to 0.01 and the
length<00:02:45.160> maximum<00:02:45.400> to<00:02:45.910> zero<00:02:46.510> one<00:02:46.780> zero<00:02:47.550> point

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550 
length maximum to zero one zero point

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:51.870 
length maximum to zero one zero point
one<00:02:49.770> so<00:02:50.770> that's<00:02:50.980> normally<00:02:51.459> about<00:02:51.550> the<00:02:51.700> length

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
one so that's normally about the length

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.580 
one so that's normally about the length
I<00:02:51.970> want<00:02:52.120> to<00:02:52.270> run<00:02:52.420> you<00:02:52.690> could<00:02:52.810> go<00:02:52.990> longer<00:02:53.140> just

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
I want to run you could go longer just

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.860 
I want to run you could go longer just
once<00:02:53.800> again<00:02:54.010> completely<00:02:54.520> depends<00:02:55.030> on<00:02:55.180> the

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
once again completely depends on the

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.230 
once again completely depends on the
artistic<00:02:56.200> look<00:02:56.620> of<00:02:56.800> your<00:02:56.950> character<00:02:57.370> and<00:02:57.580> the

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:58.240 
artistic look of your character and the

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.670 
artistic look of your character and the
next<00:02:58.480> thing<00:02:58.660> is<00:02:58.959> width<00:02:59.320> now<00:03:00.130> the<00:03:00.760> width<00:03:01.420> one<00:03:02.020> is

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
next thing is width now the width one is

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.810 
next thing is width now the width one is
the<00:03:02.950> base<00:03:03.100> of<00:03:03.130> the<00:03:03.459> base<00:03:04.390> of<00:03:04.690> hairs<00:03:05.590> so<00:03:06.370> this

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820 
the base of the base of hairs so this

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.850 
the base of the base of hairs so this
should<00:03:07.060> probably<00:03:07.240> be<00:03:07.480> zero<00:03:08.380> point<00:03:08.650> two<00:03:08.830> zero

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
should probably be zero point two zero

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.250 
should probably be zero point two zero
one<00:03:09.070> that's<00:03:09.610> what<00:03:10.000> I've<00:03:10.120> been<00:03:10.150> running<00:03:10.600> and

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
one that's what I've been running and

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:12.810 
one that's what I've been running and
once<00:03:11.530> again<00:03:11.620> this<00:03:11.830> is<00:03:11.890> completely<00:03:12.490> up<00:03:12.580> to<00:03:12.610> you

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
once again this is completely up to you

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.060 
once again this is completely up to you
and<00:03:13.060> a<00:03:13.300> tip<00:03:13.480> width<00:03:13.750> I<00:03:13.989> normally<00:03:14.530> take<00:03:14.709> this<00:03:14.890> to

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.070 
and a tip width I normally take this to

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:19.350 
and a tip width I normally take this to
zero<00:03:15.580> point<00:03:15.820> two<00:03:16.030> zero<00:03:16.060> zero<00:03:16.390> one<00:03:18.180> that<00:03:19.180> way<00:03:19.330> I

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360 
zero point two zero zero one that way I

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.680 
zero point two zero zero one that way I
comes<00:03:19.840> to<00:03:19.989> a<00:03:20.019> nice<00:03:20.200> thin<00:03:20.560> little<00:03:20.769> line<00:03:21.070> and

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
comes to a nice thin little line and

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.449 
comes to a nice thin little line and
with<00:03:22.690> random<00:03:23.230> you<00:03:23.530> probably<00:03:23.980> want<00:03:24.190> to<00:03:24.250> set

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
with random you probably want to set

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:26.280 
with random you probably want to set
this<00:03:24.580> to<00:03:24.760> zero<00:03:25.000> because<00:03:25.360> most<00:03:25.630> people's<00:03:25.989> hairs

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
this to zero because most people's hairs

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:31.620 
this to zero because most people's hairs
don't<00:03:27.630> modulate<00:03:28.630> in<00:03:28.780> width<00:03:29.019> and<00:03:30.060> this<00:03:31.060> with

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
don't modulate in width and this with

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:33.360 
don't modulate in width and this with
bias<00:03:31.959> you<00:03:32.500> can<00:03:32.650> just<00:03:32.800> leave<00:03:32.950> that<00:03:32.980> at<00:03:33.220> any

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
bias you can just leave that at any

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.870 
bias you can just leave that at any
value<00:03:33.900> okay<00:03:34.900> so<00:03:34.959> moving<00:03:35.590> down<00:03:35.769> to<00:03:36.430> the

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
value okay so moving down to the

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.840 
value okay so moving down to the
positioning<00:03:37.570> of<00:03:37.720> these<00:03:37.900> hairs<00:03:38.700> right<00:03:39.700> now

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 
positioning of these hairs right now

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:41.970 
positioning of these hairs right now
that<00:03:40.090> are<00:03:40.180> sticking<00:03:40.450> pretty<00:03:40.900> far<00:03:41.290> out<00:03:41.470> so<00:03:41.920> to

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
that are sticking pretty far out so to

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.250 
that are sticking pretty far out so to
reduce<00:03:42.370> that<00:03:42.640> these<00:03:43.540> are<00:03:43.690> the<00:03:43.750> two<00:03:43.870> attributes

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
reduce that these are the two attributes

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.890 
reduce that these are the two attributes
you<00:03:44.380> need<00:03:44.410> to<00:03:44.590> change<00:03:45.150> this<00:03:46.150> is<00:03:46.300> reduced<00:03:46.690> them

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
you need to change this is reduced them

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.680 
you need to change this is reduced them
until<00:03:47.170> you<00:03:47.380> have<00:03:47.590> them<00:03:48.390> about<00:03:49.680> little<00:03:50.680> right

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
until you have them about little right

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.110 
until you have them about little right
offset<00:03:52.690> from<00:03:53.230> the<00:03:53.320> face<00:03:53.790> right<00:03:54.790> about<00:03:54.880> there

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
offset from the face right about there

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.000 
offset from the face right about there
is<00:03:55.209> good<00:03:55.420> for<00:03:55.570> my<00:03:55.690> character<00:03:56.140> and<00:03:56.470> another

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010 
is good for my character and another

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.009 
is good for my character and another
thing<00:03:57.130> I<00:03:57.250> should<00:03:57.280> mention<00:03:57.459> is<00:03:57.910> they'll<00:03:58.630> fall

00:03:59.009 --> 00:03:59.019 
thing I should mention is they'll fall

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:00.900 
thing I should mention is they'll fall
in<00:03:59.260> the<00:03:59.380> direction<00:03:59.709> you<00:03:59.980> drew<00:04:00.160> the<00:04:00.340> line<00:04:00.370> so

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:00.910 
in the direction you drew the line so

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:03.090 
in the direction you drew the line so
it's<00:04:01.090> a<00:04:01.150> good<00:04:01.269> idea<00:04:01.390> to<00:04:01.750> draw<00:04:02.110> the<00:04:02.170> line<00:04:02.620> in<00:04:02.980> the

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:03.100 
it's a good idea to draw the line in the

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:05.000 
it's a good idea to draw the line in the
direction<00:04:03.220> you<00:04:03.610> want<00:04:03.670> your<00:04:03.910> eyebrows<00:04:04.300> to<00:04:04.540> go

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
direction you want your eyebrows to go

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.070 
direction you want your eyebrows to go
so<00:04:06.010> pretty<00:04:06.790> much<00:04:06.970> done<00:04:07.330> tweaking<00:04:07.660> the<00:04:07.870> paint

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:08.080 
so pretty much done tweaking the paint

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.160 
so pretty much done tweaking the paint
effects<00:04:08.380> though<00:04:08.799> I<00:04:08.830> am<00:04:09.900> going<00:04:10.900> to<00:04:11.019> add<00:04:11.140> a

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.170 
effects though I am going to add a

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:15.290 
effects though I am going to add a
couple<00:04:11.650> more<00:04:11.769> hairs

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:15.300 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.330 

okay<00:04:16.300> now<00:04:16.630> we're<00:04:16.780> done<00:04:16.810> so<00:04:17.500> now<00:04:18.070> we<00:04:18.130> need<00:04:18.280> to

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340 
okay now we're done so now we need to

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:20.010 
okay now we're done so now we need to
convert<00:04:18.489> this<00:04:18.790> to<00:04:18.940> polygon<00:04:19.360> geometry<00:04:19.390> because

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:20.020 
convert this to polygon geometry because

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:22.230 
convert this to polygon geometry because
mentary<00:04:20.739> can't<00:04:21.130> render<00:04:21.340> paint<00:04:21.670> effects<00:04:22.000> and

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
mentary can't render paint effects and

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.120 
mentary can't render paint effects and
right<00:04:22.990> now<00:04:23.110> it's<00:04:23.290> still<00:04:23.410> colored<00:04:23.800> to<00:04:23.980> look

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
right now it's still colored to look

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.680 
right now it's still colored to look
like<00:04:24.310> hair<00:04:24.990> so<00:04:25.990> I'm<00:04:26.110> going<00:04:26.320> to<00:04:26.410> go<00:04:26.560> to<00:04:26.620> modify

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
like hair so I'm going to go to modify

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:32.640 
like hair so I'm going to go to modify
convert<00:04:29.520> paint<00:04:30.520> effects<00:04:30.940> to<00:04:31.060> polygons<00:04:31.650> now

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
convert paint effects to polygons now

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.950 
convert paint effects to polygons now
I'm<00:04:32.800> open<00:04:33.190> up<00:04:33.280> the<00:04:33.430> options<00:04:33.580> and<00:04:34.120> I<00:04:34.660> strongly

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
I'm open up the options and I strongly

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.660 
I'm open up the options and I strongly
suggest<00:04:35.200> you<00:04:35.530> set<00:04:35.710> the<00:04:35.830> polygon<00:04:36.280> limit<00:04:36.580> to

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:36.670 
suggest you set the polygon limit to

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:38.370 
suggest you set the polygon limit to
something<00:04:37.000> high<00:04:37.150> in<00:04:37.390> my<00:04:37.540> case<00:04:37.810> I<00:04:37.990> have<00:04:38.110> it<00:04:38.230> set

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.380 
something high in my case I have it set

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.080 
something high in my case I have it set
to<00:04:38.410> a<00:04:38.530> hundred<00:04:38.890> thousand<00:04:39.340> this<00:04:39.730> will<00:04:39.880> prevent

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
to a hundred thousand this will prevent

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:41.670 
to a hundred thousand this will prevent
it<00:04:40.360> from<00:04:40.420> airing<00:04:41.110> and<00:04:41.230> not<00:04:41.350> letting<00:04:41.620> you

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 
it from airing and not letting you

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.630 
it from airing and not letting you
convert<00:04:42.040> it<00:04:42.220> so<00:04:42.480> click<00:04:43.480> convert<00:04:43.870> and<00:04:44.640> I'm

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:45.640 
convert it so click convert and I'm

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:47.490 
convert it so click convert and I'm
going<00:04:45.850> to<00:04:45.940> stop<00:04:46.120> right<00:04:46.360> here<00:04:46.570> you<00:04:47.260> could

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500 
going to stop right here you could

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.260 
going to stop right here you could
delete<00:04:47.800> your<00:04:47.950> history<00:04:48.010> right<00:04:48.670> now<00:04:48.700> which<00:04:49.240> you

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270 
delete your history right now which you

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:50.970 
delete your history right now which you
probably<00:04:49.570> should<00:04:49.960> but<00:04:50.260> if<00:04:50.650> you<00:04:50.770> have<00:04:50.860> an

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:50.980 
probably should but if you have an

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:53.190 
probably should but if you have an
animated<00:04:51.370> character<00:04:51.670> these<00:04:52.420> eyebrows<00:04:52.960> will

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:53.200 
animated character these eyebrows will

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.890 
animated character these eyebrows will
remain<00:04:53.500> attached<00:04:53.950> to<00:04:53.980> the<00:04:54.310> character<00:04:55.000> if<00:04:55.300> you

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:55.900 
remain attached to the character if you

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.110 
remain attached to the character if you
make<00:04:56.080> sure<00:04:56.350> that<00:04:56.650> and<00:04:57.070> if<00:04:57.400> you<00:04:57.490> don't<00:04:57.730> delete

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.120 
make sure that and if you don't delete

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.230 
make sure that and if you don't delete
history<00:04:59.010> so<00:05:00.010> if<00:05:00.160> your<00:05:00.400> character<00:05:01.030> is<00:05:01.060> not

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:01.240 
history so if your character is not

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:02.610 
history so if your character is not
animated<00:05:01.630> it's<00:05:01.900> never<00:05:02.080> going<00:05:02.290> to<00:05:02.380> move<00:05:02.560> just

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:02.620 
animated it's never going to move just

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:04.560 
animated it's never going to move just
delete<00:05:03.160> history<00:05:03.490> if<00:05:03.670> it<00:05:03.820> does<00:05:04.090> move<00:05:04.300> you

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:04.570 
delete history if it does move you

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:06.180 
delete history if it does move you
should<00:05:04.600> probably<00:05:05.140> want<00:05:05.560> to<00:05:05.680> leave<00:05:05.830> history

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:06.190 
should probably want to leave history

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:08.250 
should probably want to leave history
because<00:05:06.460> then<00:05:06.610> it<00:05:06.700> will<00:05:06.790> allow<00:05:06.880> Maya<00:05:07.780> to<00:05:08.110> leave

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:08.260 
because then it will allow Maya to leave

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:09.720 
because then it will allow Maya to leave
the<00:05:08.380> paint<00:05:08.590> effects<00:05:08.830> go<00:05:09.070> over<00:05:09.220> there<00:05:09.370> which<00:05:09.550> is

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:09.730 
the paint effects go over there which is

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:12.120 
the paint effects go over there which is
glue<00:05:10.030> to<00:05:10.180> your<00:05:10.300> characters<00:05:10.720> face<00:05:10.750> and<00:05:11.290> then<00:05:12.010> it

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:12.130 
glue to your characters face and then it

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:14.190 
glue to your characters face and then it
will<00:05:12.250> move<00:05:12.400> the<00:05:12.580> grass<00:05:13.090> with<00:05:13.330> it<00:05:13.480> well<00:05:14.020> in<00:05:14.110> this

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:14.200 
will move the grass with it well in this

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.170 
will move the grass with it well in this
case<00:05:14.380> hair<00:05:14.650> so<00:05:15.400> but<00:05:15.640> I'll<00:05:15.730> be<00:05:15.820> deleting

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:16.180 
case hair so but I'll be deleting

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:18.780 
case hair so but I'll be deleting
history<00:05:16.480> and<00:05:17.070> now<00:05:18.070> we<00:05:18.130> need<00:05:18.400> to<00:05:18.490> assign<00:05:18.730> a

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:18.790 
history and now we need to assign a

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:21.210 
history and now we need to assign a
shade<00:05:19.120> over<00:05:19.150> looks<00:05:19.540> more<00:05:19.840> like<00:05:19.990> grass<00:05:20.260> now

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:21.220 
shade over looks more like grass now

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.580 
shade over looks more like grass now
this<00:05:21.820> is<00:05:21.970> completely<00:05:22.330> up<00:05:22.540> to<00:05:22.570> you<00:05:22.840> I<00:05:22.990> mean<00:05:23.260> it's

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:23.590 
this is completely up to you I mean it's

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:26.310 
this is completely up to you I mean it's
more<00:05:23.830> like<00:05:24.010> hair<00:05:24.430> that<00:05:24.700> is<00:05:25.570> completely<00:05:26.170> up<00:05:26.290> to

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:26.320 
more like hair that is completely up to

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.080 
more like hair that is completely up to
you<00:05:26.560> but<00:05:26.800> in<00:05:27.010> my<00:05:27.130> case<00:05:27.190> I'll<00:05:27.520> be<00:05:27.610> just<00:05:27.730> using<00:05:28.030> a

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:28.090 
you but in my case I'll be just using a

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:31.680 
you but in my case I'll be just using a
simple<00:05:28.510> Lambert<00:05:29.580> I'll<00:05:30.580> set<00:05:30.880> the<00:05:30.970> color<00:05:31.180> darker

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:31.690 
simple Lambert I'll set the color darker

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:35.880 
simple Lambert I'll set the color darker
maybe<00:05:32.650> just<00:05:32.800> a<00:05:32.890> dark<00:05:33.100> brown<00:05:33.370> and<00:05:34.680> now<00:05:35.680> for

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:35.890 
maybe just a dark brown and now for

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:37.440 
maybe just a dark brown and now for
transparency<00:05:36.490> this<00:05:36.760> is<00:05:36.940> something<00:05:37.330> I've

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:37.450 
transparency this is something I've

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:38.910 
transparency this is something I've
learned<00:05:37.750> you<00:05:37.900> don't<00:05:38.110> want<00:05:38.320> to<00:05:38.440> just<00:05:38.590> simply

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:38.920 
learned you don't want to just simply

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:41.640 
learned you don't want to just simply
make<00:05:39.100> the<00:05:39.220> hairs<00:05:39.460> slightly<00:05:40.360> transparent<00:05:40.650> but

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:41.650 
make the hairs slightly transparent but

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:44.100 
make the hairs slightly transparent but
what<00:05:41.800> you<00:05:41.890> should<00:05:42.130> do<00:05:42.310> is<00:05:42.640> create<00:05:43.570> a<00:05:43.630> ramp<00:05:43.810> node

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:44.110 
what you should do is create a ramp node

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:46.560 
what you should do is create a ramp node
I<00:05:44.700> just<00:05:45.700> clicked<00:05:45.970> this<00:05:46.030> little<00:05:46.300> checkerboard

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:46.570 
I just clicked this little checkerboard

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:48.510 
I just clicked this little checkerboard
and<00:05:46.990> this<00:05:47.200> opens<00:05:47.710> up<00:05:47.860> the<00:05:48.010> create<00:05:48.220> render

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:48.520 
and this opens up the create render

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:52.050 
and this opens up the create render
nodes<00:05:48.730> so<00:05:48.940> we<00:05:48.970> can<00:05:49.210> connect<00:05:49.480> a<00:05:49.570> ramp<00:05:49.780> and<00:05:51.060> we

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:52.060 
nodes so we can connect a ramp and we

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:53.640 
nodes so we can connect a ramp and we
want<00:05:52.360> the<00:05:52.510> transparency<00:05:53.170> to<00:05:53.290> have<00:05:53.380> a<00:05:53.410> little

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:53.650 
want the transparency to have a little

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:54.600 
want the transparency to have a little
bit<00:05:53.740> of<00:05:53.830> a<00:05:53.890> fall-off

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:54.610 
bit of a fall-off

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:57.510 
bit of a fall-off
so<00:05:55.030> this<00:05:55.540> up<00:05:55.690> here<00:05:55.870> is<00:05:55.930> a<00:05:55.960> tip<00:05:56.260> and<00:05:56.530> this<00:05:57.250> is<00:05:57.400> the

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:57.520 
so this up here is a tip and this is the

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:59.910 
so this up here is a tip and this is the
base<00:05:57.670> and<00:05:58.120> the<00:05:58.720> base<00:05:58.870> I'll<00:05:59.230> just<00:05:59.530> set<00:05:59.650> it<00:05:59.680> to

00:05:59.910 --> 00:05:59.920 
base and the base I'll just set it to

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:02.340 
base and the base I'll just set it to
maybe<00:06:00.340> like<00:06:00.520> a<00:06:00.580> 40%<00:06:01.270> gray<00:06:01.450> or<00:06:01.600> something<00:06:01.750> and

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:02.350 
maybe like a 40% gray or something and

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:07.650 
maybe like a 40% gray or something and
the<00:06:02.920> tip<00:06:03.330> I'll<00:06:04.330> set<00:06:04.690> to<00:06:04.930> white<00:06:06.480> I'll<00:06:07.480> just

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:07.660 
the tip I'll set to white I'll just

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:10.560 
the tip I'll set to white I'll just
adjust<00:06:07.810> these<00:06:08.230> these<00:06:08.530> a<00:06:08.590> little<00:06:08.950> bit<00:06:09.070> and<00:06:09.940> Oh

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:10.570 
adjust these these a little bit and Oh

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:14.010 
adjust these these a little bit and Oh
set<00:06:11.440> the<00:06:11.560> renderer<00:06:11.890> to<00:06:12.220> mentoring<00:06:12.520> and<00:06:12.990> do<00:06:13.990> a

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:14.020 
set the renderer to mentoring and do a

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:21.000 
set the renderer to mentoring and do a
quick<00:06:14.230> rendering

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:21.010 

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:24.070 

there<00:06:22.010> we<00:06:22.100> go<00:06:22.250> eyebrows<00:06:22.970> now<00:06:23.630> you<00:06:23.720> can<00:06:23.870> tweak

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:24.080 
there we go eyebrows now you can tweak

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:25.480 
there we go eyebrows now you can tweak
them<00:06:24.260> and<00:06:24.440> play<00:06:24.590> with<00:06:24.740> them<00:06:24.920> or<00:06:25.160> do<00:06:25.340> whatever

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:25.490 
them and play with them or do whatever

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:27.100 
them and play with them or do whatever
you<00:06:25.700> want<00:06:25.880> with<00:06:26.030> them<00:06:26.150> it's<00:06:26.390> just<00:06:26.480> now

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:27.110 
you want with them it's just now

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:29.950 
you want with them it's just now
normal<00:06:27.500> polygon<00:06:28.040> geometry<00:06:28.210> you<00:06:29.210> can<00:06:29.240> edit<00:06:29.600> and

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:29.960 
normal polygon geometry you can edit and

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:31.120 
normal polygon geometry you can edit and
one<00:06:30.260> last<00:06:30.470> thing<00:06:30.650> you<00:06:30.710> should<00:06:30.830> I<00:06:31.070> should

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:31.130 
one last thing you should I should

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:33.490 
one last thing you should I should
mention<00:06:31.640> is<00:06:31.970> when<00:06:32.720> you<00:06:32.810> do<00:06:32.930> leave<00:06:33.080> history<00:06:33.410> it

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:33.500 
mention is when you do leave history it

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:37.630 
mention is when you do leave history it
actually<00:06:33.860> doesn't<00:06:34.040> delete<00:06:34.490> the<00:06:36.400> it<00:06:37.400> doesn't

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:37.640 
actually doesn't delete the it doesn't

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:39.040 
actually doesn't delete the it doesn't
delete<00:06:37.790> the<00:06:37.910> paint<00:06:38.120> effects<00:06:38.420> so<00:06:38.720> to<00:06:38.810> do<00:06:39.020> that

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:39.050 
delete the paint effects so to do that

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:41.200 
delete the paint effects so to do that
open<00:06:40.010> up<00:06:40.070> the<00:06:40.190> outliner<00:06:40.550> and<00:06:40.850> look<00:06:40.970> for

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:41.210 
open up the outliner and look for

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:43.780 
open up the outliner and look for
something<00:06:41.510> like<00:06:41.660> stroke<00:06:42.200> grass<00:06:42.590> clump<00:06:43.040> one<00:06:43.250> it

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:43.790 
something like stroke grass clump one it

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:44.980 
something like stroke grass clump one it
might<00:06:44.000> have<00:06:44.300> a<00:06:44.330> different<00:06:44.600> number<00:06:44.690> it<00:06:44.900> might

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:44.990 
might have a different number it might

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:47.230 
might have a different number it might
be<00:06:45.140> clump<00:06:45.410> -<00:06:45.590> whatever<00:06:46.220> just<00:06:46.640> select<00:06:47.060> those

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:47.240 
be clump - whatever just select those

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.510 
be clump - whatever just select those
and<00:06:47.480> delete<00:06:47.960> it<00:06:48.080> and<00:06:48.710> we<00:06:48.920> can<00:06:49.100> ungroup<00:06:49.220> this

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:49.520 
and delete it and we can ungroup this

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:52.120 
and delete it and we can ungroup this
