00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:05.599 

three<00:00:04.259> waist<00:00:04.470> which<00:00:04.710> allows<00:00:05.160> you<00:00:05.339> to<00:00:05.430> turn<00:00:05.549> a

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 
three waist which allows you to turn a

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:07.340 
three waist which allows you to turn a
light<00:00:05.850> on<00:00:05.879> from<00:00:06.120> two<00:00:06.270> locations<00:00:06.810> say<00:00:07.020> the<00:00:07.170> top

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
light on from two locations say the top

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:08.960 
light on from two locations say the top
of<00:00:07.470> the<00:00:07.560> stairs<00:00:07.770> at<00:00:07.950> the<00:00:08.010> bottom<00:00:08.309> yeah<00:00:08.730> but

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
of the stairs at the bottom yeah but

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:09.919 
of the stairs at the bottom yeah but
it's<00:00:09.059> a<00:00:09.090> little<00:00:09.210> more<00:00:09.330> complicated<00:00:09.660> in<00:00:09.900> the

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
it's a little more complicated in the

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:11.030 
it's a little more complicated in the
wiring<00:00:10.170> right<00:00:10.500> yeah

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
wiring right yeah

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.770 
wiring right yeah
so<00:00:11.219> I've<00:00:11.580> got<00:00:11.790> a<00:00:11.820> model<00:00:12.210> here<00:00:12.389> that<00:00:12.420> we<00:00:12.630> can

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
so I've got a model here that we can

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.810 
so I've got a model here that we can
show<00:00:12.960> you<00:00:12.990> and<00:00:13.830> of<00:00:14.009> three<00:00:14.219> ways<00:00:14.309> how<00:00:14.549> they<00:00:14.670> work

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
show you and of three ways how they work

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.029 
show you and of three ways how they work
here's<00:00:15.120> a<00:00:15.179> three-way<00:00:15.509> switch<00:00:15.859> three-way<00:00:16.859> has

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
here's a three-way switch three-way has

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.920 
here's a three-way switch three-way has
three<00:00:17.310> connections<00:00:17.460> we<00:00:18.119> have<00:00:18.240> a<00:00:18.270> common<00:00:18.660> screw

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
three connections we have a common screw

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.080 
three connections we have a common screw
which<00:00:19.320> is<00:00:19.350> always<00:00:19.800> a<00:00:20.010> dark<00:00:20.310> color<00:00:20.520> different

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
which is always a dark color different

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.720 
which is always a dark color different
common<00:00:21.869> for<00:00:22.289> power<00:00:22.710> common<00:00:23.310> allows<00:00:23.490> power

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
common for power common allows power

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.250 
common for power common allows power
either<00:00:24.060> into<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.449> switch<00:00:24.720> or<00:00:24.900> out<00:00:25.019> of<00:00:25.170> the

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
either into the switch or out of the

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.170 
either into the switch or out of the
switch<00:00:25.439> okay<00:00:25.680> then<00:00:26.430> we<00:00:26.580> have<00:00:26.609> two<00:00:26.849> travelers

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
switch okay then we have two travelers

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.480 
switch okay then we have two travelers
those<00:00:27.840> are<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.050> same<00:00:28.230> color<00:00:28.529> they're<00:00:29.220> silver

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
those are the same color they're silver

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.209 
those are the same color they're silver
mm-hmm<00:00:30.480> two<00:00:30.720> traveler<00:00:31.140> switches<00:00:31.560> drivers

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
mm-hmm two traveler switches drivers

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.160 
mm-hmm two traveler switches drivers
means<00:00:32.460> what<00:00:32.940> mean<00:00:33.300> that<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.600> two<00:00:33.930> switches

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
means what mean that the two switches

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.840 
means what mean that the two switches
can<00:00:34.410> talk<00:00:34.620> to<00:00:34.739> each<00:00:34.829> other<00:00:35.070> it<00:00:35.250> travels<00:00:35.640> back

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
can talk to each other it travels back

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.819 
can talk to each other it travels back
and<00:00:35.880> forth<00:00:36.090> between<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.600> switches<00:00:36.809> and<00:00:37.320> then

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
and forth between the switches and then

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.650 
and forth between the switches and then
a<00:00:37.860> ground<00:00:38.129> guy<00:00:38.670> that's<00:00:39.000> on<00:00:39.120> all<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.420> switches

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
a ground guy that's on all the switches

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.240 
a ground guy that's on all the switches
yeah<00:00:40.050> all<00:00:40.829> right

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
yeah all right

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.010 
yeah all right
over<00:00:41.610> here<00:00:41.760> we<00:00:41.910> have<00:00:42.059> a<00:00:42.090> model<00:00:42.360> of<00:00:42.540> it<00:00:42.690> when<00:00:42.899> it

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
over here we have a model of it when it

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.139 
over here we have a model of it when it
works<00:00:43.230> we<00:00:44.219> have<00:00:44.250> you<00:00:44.489> can<00:00:44.640> turn<00:00:44.760> on<00:00:44.940> at<00:00:45.030> one

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
works we have you can turn on at one

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.180 
works we have you can turn on at one
location<00:00:45.480> you<00:00:45.840> sure<00:00:46.620> enough<00:00:46.710> at<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.039> other

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
location you sure enough at the other

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.700 
location you sure enough at the other
location<00:00:47.730> each<00:00:48.450> switch<00:00:48.840> can<00:00:49.079> override<00:00:49.379> the

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
location each switch can override the

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:50.959 
location each switch can override the
other<00:00:49.829> switch<00:00:50.160> gotcha

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
other switch gotcha

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.299 
other switch gotcha
and<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.480> way<00:00:51.629> this<00:00:51.840> works<00:00:52.079> is<00:00:52.620> it's<00:00:52.949> got<00:00:53.129> power

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
and the way this works is it's got power

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.670 
and the way this works is it's got power
coming<00:00:53.820> in<00:00:53.910> from<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.149> panel<00:00:54.480> mm-hmm<00:00:55.050> coming

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
coming in from the panel mm-hmm coming

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.369 
coming in from the panel mm-hmm coming
into<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:56.039> first<00:00:56.190> switch<00:00:56.870> power<00:00:57.870> comes<00:00:58.140> in<00:00:58.230> on

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
into the first switch power comes in on

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.049 
into the first switch power comes in on
the<00:00:58.469> black<00:00:58.620> wire<00:00:58.890> returns<00:00:59.460> on<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.699> white<00:00:59.850> wire

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
the black wire returns on the white wire

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.459 
the black wire returns on the white wire
which<00:01:00.300> is<00:01:00.329> neutral<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:00.960> this<00:01:01.079> is<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.320> ground

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
which is neutral and this is the ground

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.049 
which is neutral and this is the ground
all<00:01:02.190> right<00:01:02.250> this<00:01:02.460> is<00:01:02.579> what<00:01:02.670> you<00:01:02.699> guys<00:01:02.879> actually

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
all right this is what you guys actually

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.490 
all right this is what you guys actually
call<00:01:03.329> a<00:01:03.480> two<00:01:03.539> wire<00:01:03.899> because<00:01:04.170> you<00:01:04.229> don't<00:01:04.350> really

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
call a two wire because you don't really

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.929 
call a two wire because you don't really
count<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.769> ground<00:01:04.979> yeah<00:01:05.339> gotcha

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
count the ground yeah gotcha

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.719 
count the ground yeah gotcha
so<00:01:06.630> once<00:01:06.810> power<00:01:07.020> is<00:01:07.229> into<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.650> switch<00:01:07.890> at<00:01:08.189> the

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
so once power is into the switch at the

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.060 
so once power is into the switch at the
switch<00:01:09.060> location<00:01:09.630> then<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.409> power<00:01:10.590> connects

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
switch location then the power connects

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.450 
switch location then the power connects
to<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.580> common<00:01:11.970> we<00:01:12.960> have<00:01:12.990> three<00:01:13.530> wires<00:01:13.710> going

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
to the common we have three wires going

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.710 
to the common we have three wires going
between<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.850> two<00:01:14.970> switches<00:01:15.180> this<00:01:15.600> is

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
between the two switches this is

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.270 
between the two switches this is
different<00:01:16.049> here<00:01:16.200> all<00:01:16.710> right<00:01:16.890> so<00:01:17.100> obviously

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
different here all right so obviously

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.999 
different here all right so obviously
you've<00:01:17.909> got<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.450> white<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:19.080> black<00:01:19.350> we

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
you've got the white the black we

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.380 
you've got the white the black we
disregard<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.610> ground<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:21.060> here's<00:01:21.240> the

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
disregard the ground and here's the

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.170 
disregard the ground and here's the
third<00:01:21.630> yeah<00:01:22.110> all<00:01:22.950> right<00:01:23.159> so<00:01:23.520> in<00:01:23.640> this<00:01:23.700> case<00:01:23.820> we

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
third yeah all right so in this case we

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.030 
third yeah all right so in this case we
have<00:01:24.299> two<00:01:24.479> travelers<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:25.380> black<00:01:25.590> and<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.009> red

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
have two travelers the black and the red

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.399 
have two travelers the black and the red
mm-hmm<00:01:26.970> this<00:01:27.450> is<00:01:27.570> one<00:01:27.750> way<00:01:27.900> of<00:01:27.930> wiring<00:01:28.259> the

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
mm-hmm this is one way of wiring the

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.710 
mm-hmm this is one way of wiring the
switch<00:01:28.680> we<00:01:29.490> also<00:01:29.610> have<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:29.880> second<00:01:30.329> way<00:01:30.420> that<00:01:30.630> we

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
switch we also have a second way that we

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.499 
switch we also have a second way that we
have<00:01:30.869> here<00:01:31.049> in<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.229> diagram<00:01:31.439> okay<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:33.000> this

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
have here in the diagram okay and this

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.080 
have here in the diagram okay and this
place<00:01:33.840> in<00:01:34.200> this<00:01:34.409> one<00:01:34.680> power<00:01:35.490> is<00:01:35.729> coming<00:01:35.880> in

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
place in this one power is coming in

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.789 
place in this one power is coming in
from<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.329> panel<00:01:36.659> into<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:37.020> first<00:01:37.290> switch<00:01:37.500> box

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
from the panel into the first switch box

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.399 
from the panel into the first switch box
yeah<00:01:38.159> now<00:01:38.610> this<00:01:38.850> will<00:01:39.030> catch<00:01:39.210> you<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.630> white

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
yeah now this will catch you the white

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.260 
yeah now this will catch you the white
wire<00:01:40.590> we're<00:01:40.860> using<00:01:41.009> orange<00:01:41.430> here<00:01:41.880> but<00:01:42.119> the

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
wire we're using orange here but the

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.850 
wire we're using orange here but the
range<00:01:42.479> of<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.659> white<00:01:42.810> wire<00:01:43.020> white<00:01:43.350> red<00:01:43.710> and

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
range of the white wire white red and

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:44.600 
range of the white wire white red and
black<00:01:44.009> yeah

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
black yeah

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.789 
black yeah
traveling<00:01:45.149> between<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.420> two<00:01:45.600> switches<00:01:46.020> but

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
traveling between the two switches but

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.859 
traveling between the two switches but
in<00:01:46.950> this<00:01:47.100> case<00:01:47.340> we're<00:01:47.820> taking<00:01:47.970> line<00:01:48.360> from<00:01:48.720> the

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
in this case we're taking line from the

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.620 
in this case we're taking line from the
first<00:01:49.079> box<00:01:49.380> to<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.340> second<00:01:50.700> switch<00:01:50.880> so<00:01:51.360> this

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
first box to the second switch so this

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.660 
first box to the second switch so this
white<00:01:51.869> wire<00:01:52.110> is<00:01:52.140> hot<00:01:52.590> in<00:01:52.740> this<00:01:52.799> case<00:01:53.040> yeah<00:01:53.399> so

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
white wire is hot in this case yeah so

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.160 
white wire is hot in this case yeah so
don't<00:01:53.759> be<00:01:53.880> fooled<00:01:54.090> not<00:01:54.299> always<00:01:54.600> safe<00:01:54.810> one<00:01:55.140> of

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
don't be fooled not always safe one of

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.630 
don't be fooled not always safe one of
the<00:01:55.259> rare<00:01:55.470> situations<00:01:56.040> you<00:01:56.130> can<00:01:56.280> have<00:01:56.369> a<00:01:56.460> hot

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
the rare situations you can have a hot

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.209 
the rare situations you can have a hot
white<00:01:56.969> wire<00:01:57.180> gotcha<00:01:57.600> and<00:01:58.020> once<00:01:58.829> it<00:01:58.950> gets<00:01:59.009> into

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
white wire gotcha and once it gets into

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.800 
white wire gotcha and once it gets into
this<00:01:59.430> switch<00:01:59.670> the<00:02:00.210> switch<00:02:00.329> can<00:02:00.630> make<00:02:00.780> a

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
this switch the switch can make a

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.870 
this switch the switch can make a
connection<00:02:01.140> between<00:02:01.950> one<00:02:02.250> of<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.399> travelers

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
connection between one of the travelers

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.730 
connection between one of the travelers
there's<00:02:03.810> a<00:02:03.899> connection<00:02:04.170> in<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.439> second

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
there's a connection in the second

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.830 
there's a connection in the second
switch<00:02:04.950> and<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.670> light<00:02:05.820> is<00:02:05.939> turned<00:02:06.149> on<00:02:06.329> so

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
switch and the light is turned on so

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.630 
switch and the light is turned on so
this<00:02:06.990> represents<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.649> on<00:02:07.920> so<00:02:08.369> literally

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
this represents the on so literally

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.910 
this represents the on so literally
electricity<00:02:09.239> comes<00:02:09.479> through<00:02:09.869> here<00:02:10.229> falls<00:02:10.560> all

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
electricity comes through here falls all

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.050 
electricity comes through here falls all
the<00:02:10.950> way<00:02:11.160> around

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
the way around

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.559 
the way around
X<00:02:12.209> continues<00:02:13.110> turns<00:02:13.770> a<00:02:13.950> light<00:02:14.099> on<00:02:14.310> if<00:02:15.000> I<00:02:15.390> were

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
X continues turns a light on if I were

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.780 
X continues turns a light on if I were
to<00:02:15.720> physically<00:02:16.440> switch<00:02:17.250> one<00:02:17.580> of<00:02:17.670> these

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
to physically switch one of these

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.420 
to physically switch one of these
switches<00:02:18.440> that<00:02:19.440> would<00:02:19.620> be<00:02:19.739> represented<00:02:20.280> by

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
switches that would be represented by

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.900 
switches that would be represented by
breaking<00:02:21.270> this<00:02:21.390> connection<00:02:21.930> here<00:02:22.790> making<00:02:23.790> the

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
breaking this connection here making the

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.040 
breaking this connection here making the
connection<00:02:24.420> right<00:02:24.599> there

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
connection right there

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.900 
connection right there
but<00:02:25.440> now<00:02:25.620> the<00:02:25.680> electricity<00:02:26.370> would<00:02:26.670> come

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
but now the electricity would come

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.479 
but now the electricity would come
through<00:02:27.330> all<00:02:28.020> the<00:02:28.080> way<00:02:28.590> out<00:02:29.069> on<00:02:29.250> the<00:02:29.340> white

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
through all the way out on the white

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:31.339 
through all the way out on the white
wire<00:02:29.640> pass<00:02:30.060> this<00:02:30.450> switch<00:02:30.780> through<00:02:31.230> the

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
wire pass this switch through the

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:33.589 
wire pass this switch through the
traveler<00:02:31.769> but<00:02:31.950> stop<00:02:32.340> there<00:02:32.730> yep<00:02:33.300> because

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599 
traveler but stop there yep because

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:35.150 
traveler but stop there yep because
there's<00:02:33.750> no<00:02:33.840> connection<00:02:34.319> so<00:02:34.920> that<00:02:35.040> would

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
there's no connection so that would

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.220 
there's no connection so that would
represent<00:02:35.250> the<00:02:35.580> opposition<00:02:35.910> yeah<00:02:36.690> so<00:02:37.200> I

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
represent the opposition yeah so I

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:38.690 
represent the opposition yeah so I
understand<00:02:37.739> this<00:02:38.099> but<00:02:38.160> what<00:02:38.430> do<00:02:38.489> we<00:02:38.550> do<00:02:38.640> about

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
understand this but what do we do about

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.460 
understand this but what do we do about
our<00:02:38.910> problem<00:02:39.269> well<00:02:39.840> we're<00:02:39.959> going<00:02:40.050> to<00:02:40.110> turn<00:02:40.349> out

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
our problem well we're going to turn out

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:41.839 
our problem well we're going to turn out
the<00:02:40.560> power<00:02:40.739> and<00:02:41.040> we're<00:02:41.220> gonna<00:02:41.310> go<00:02:41.489> test<00:02:41.760> the

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
the power and we're gonna go test the

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:44.539 
the power and we're gonna go test the
switch<00:02:42.590> all<00:02:43.590> right<00:02:43.739> I<00:02:43.769> got<00:02:43.950> that<00:02:44.040> breaker<00:02:44.280> off

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:44.549 
switch all right I got that breaker off

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:46.509 
switch all right I got that breaker off
for<00:02:44.760> you<00:02:44.850> peg<00:02:45.060> okay<00:02:45.510> thank<00:02:45.959> you

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:46.519 
for you peg okay thank you

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:49.759 
for you peg okay thank you
take<00:02:47.519> a<00:02:47.549> cover<00:02:47.850> plate<00:02:48.030> off<00:02:48.440> now<00:02:49.440> even<00:02:49.680> though

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
take a cover plate off now even though

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:51.020 
take a cover plate off now even though
you've<00:02:49.890> turned<00:02:50.069> off<00:02:50.190> the<00:02:50.340> breaker<00:02:50.519> I<00:02:50.640> always

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
you've turned off the breaker I always

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.270 
you've turned off the breaker I always
test<00:02:51.299> to<00:02:51.480> make<00:02:51.569> sure<00:02:51.630> the<00:02:51.840> power<00:02:51.989> is<00:02:52.140> off<00:02:52.319> till

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
test to make sure the power is off till

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.410 
test to make sure the power is off till
you<00:02:53.340> get<00:02:53.489> yourself<00:02:53.790> a<00:02:53.880> tester<00:02:54.239> right

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
you get yourself a tester right

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.110 
you get yourself a tester right
absolutely<00:02:54.780> have<00:02:55.260> a<00:02:55.350> voltage<00:02:55.709> tester<00:02:56.130> from

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
absolutely have a voltage tester from

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.870 
absolutely have a voltage tester from
ground<00:02:57.480> to<00:02:57.750> all<00:02:57.989> connections<00:02:58.560> no<00:02:59.220> power<00:02:59.459> I'm

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
ground to all connections no power I'm

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.759 
ground to all connections no power I'm
safe<00:03:00.150> to<00:03:00.269> take<00:03:00.420> this<00:03:00.599> switch<00:03:00.840> out<00:03:01.080> now<00:03:01.590> these

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
safe to take this switch out now these

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:03.259 
safe to take this switch out now these
switches<00:03:02.130> could<00:03:02.280> still<00:03:02.519> be<00:03:02.640> on<00:03:02.760> it<00:03:03.030> could<00:03:03.150> be

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
switches could still be on it could be

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:05.570 
switches could still be on it could be
on<00:03:03.360> a<00:03:03.390> separate<00:03:03.720> circuit<00:03:03.900> so<00:03:04.680> stay<00:03:04.920> away<00:03:05.099> I

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
on a separate circuit so stay away I

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.309 
on a separate circuit so stay away I
need<00:03:05.760> to<00:03:05.880> be<00:03:05.970> aware<00:03:06.180> of<00:03:06.239> that<00:03:06.450> or<00:03:06.810> shut<00:03:07.170> those

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
need to be aware of that or shut those

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:10.250 
need to be aware of that or shut those
circuits<00:03:07.709> off<00:03:07.860> awesome<00:03:08.280> all<00:03:08.400> right<00:03:09.080> now<00:03:10.080> we'll

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
circuits off awesome all right now we'll

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.500 
circuits off awesome all right now we'll
take<00:03:10.410> the<00:03:10.530> switch<00:03:10.739> out<00:03:10.970> so<00:03:11.970> that<00:03:12.090> we<00:03:12.180> can<00:03:12.330> test

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
take the switch out so that we can test

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.589 
take the switch out so that we can test
it<00:03:12.690> out<00:03:13.019> on<00:03:13.260> the<00:03:13.410> table<00:03:13.680> so<00:03:14.580> first<00:03:15.390> I'm<00:03:15.510> gonna

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:15.599 
it out on the table so first I'm gonna

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:17.449 
it out on the table so first I'm gonna
take<00:03:15.780> the<00:03:15.930> wires<00:03:16.079> off<00:03:16.320> the<00:03:16.470> switch<00:03:16.680> but<00:03:17.370> I'm

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
take the wires off the switch but I'm

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:19.220 
take the wires off the switch but I'm
going<00:03:17.609> to<00:03:17.640> label<00:03:17.790> them<00:03:18.060> so<00:03:18.600> that<00:03:18.750> I<00:03:18.780> know<00:03:18.900> which

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
going to label them so that I know which

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.380 
going to label them so that I know which
wire<00:03:19.470> is<00:03:19.530> which<00:03:19.769> all<00:03:20.459> right<00:03:20.700> help<00:03:21.090> you<00:03:21.180> put<00:03:21.299> it

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
wire is which all right help you put it

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.900 
wire is which all right help you put it
back<00:03:21.480> together<00:03:21.660> yeah<00:03:22.260> and<00:03:22.650> I'm<00:03:23.459> gonna<00:03:23.609> real

back together yeah and I'm gonna real

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.780 
back together yeah and I'm gonna real
able<00:03:24.209> the<00:03:24.420> hot<00:03:24.810> white<00:03:25.410> wire<00:03:25.650> as<00:03:25.980> black<00:03:26.340> so

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
able the hot white wire as black so

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.220 
able the hot white wire as black so
permanent<00:03:27.030> black<00:03:27.299> marker<00:03:27.660> to<00:03:27.720> make<00:03:27.870> sure<00:03:27.989> no

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
permanent black marker to make sure no

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:29.599 
permanent black marker to make sure no
one<00:03:28.410> forgets<00:03:28.799> that<00:03:28.890> that's<00:03:29.069> hot<00:03:29.250> ever<00:03:29.430> in<00:03:29.549> the

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:29.609 
one forgets that that's hot ever in the

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:32.809 
one forgets that that's hot ever in the
future<00:03:29.910> yeah<00:03:31.100> okay<00:03:32.100> so<00:03:32.160> what<00:03:32.430> people<00:03:32.670> don't

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:32.819 
future yeah okay so what people don't

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:34.130 
future yeah okay so what people don't
realize<00:03:33.150> is<00:03:33.299> it<00:03:33.390> could<00:03:33.510> be<00:03:33.600> either<00:03:33.810> of<00:03:34.019> the

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
realize is it could be either of the

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.020 
realize is it could be either of the
switches<00:03:34.500> that's<00:03:34.650> broken<00:03:34.920> we're<00:03:35.730> taking<00:03:35.940> the

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
switches that's broken we're taking the

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.039 
switches that's broken we're taking the
switch<00:03:36.239> out<00:03:36.359> of<00:03:36.510> the<00:03:36.569> wall<00:03:36.690> we're<00:03:36.870> going<00:03:36.989> to

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
switch out of the wall we're going to

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:38.660 
switch out of the wall we're going to
test<00:03:37.290> it<00:03:37.440> with<00:03:37.530> this<00:03:37.709> continuity<00:03:38.069> tester

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
test it with this continuity tester

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:39.740 
test it with this continuity tester
all<00:03:38.760> right<00:03:38.850> so<00:03:38.940> how<00:03:39.060> does<00:03:39.180> this<00:03:39.299> work<00:03:39.540> we've

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
all right so how does this work we've

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.360 
all right so how does this work we've
got<00:03:39.900> power<00:03:40.079> created<00:03:40.560> somewhere<00:03:40.829> this<00:03:41.160> has<00:03:41.340> a

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
got power created somewhere this has a

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.190 
got power created somewhere this has a
small<00:03:41.549> battery<00:03:42.000> in<00:03:42.090> it<00:03:42.180> and<00:03:42.299> a<00:03:42.359> beeper<00:03:42.660> when

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
small battery in it and a beeper when

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.440 
small battery in it and a beeper when
you<00:03:43.290> touch<00:03:43.650> the<00:03:43.799> two<00:03:43.950> wires<00:03:44.359> completes<00:03:45.359> a

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
you touch the two wires completes a

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.509 
you touch the two wires completes a
circuit<00:03:45.630> and<00:03:45.989> it<00:03:46.170> beeps<00:03:46.350> okay<00:03:46.799> now<00:03:47.310> if<00:03:47.430> the

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
circuit and it beeps okay now if the

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:49.729 
circuit and it beeps okay now if the
switch<00:03:47.760> is<00:03:47.790> working<00:03:48.209> properly<00:03:48.389> we<00:03:49.380> will<00:03:49.590> get

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
switch is working properly we will get

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:52.069 
switch is working properly we will get
continuity<00:03:50.310> only<00:03:50.700> between<00:03:50.970> common<00:03:51.630> and<00:03:51.840> one

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079 
continuity only between common and one

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:54.020 
continuity only between common and one
of<00:03:52.260> the<00:03:52.380> screws<00:03:52.620> so<00:03:53.040> would<00:03:53.130> only<00:03:53.340> send<00:03:53.790> power

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
of the screws so would only send power

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.780 
of the screws so would only send power
to<00:03:54.299> one<00:03:54.569> of<00:03:54.750> those<00:03:54.900> travelers<00:03:55.350> screws<00:03:55.560> yep<00:03:55.889> so

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
to one of those travelers screws yep so

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.840 
to one of those travelers screws yep so
we<00:03:57.000> have<00:03:57.150> common<00:03:57.450> to<00:03:57.750> this<00:03:57.900> group<00:03:58.730> and<00:03:59.730> we're

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850 
we have common to this group and we're

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:02.240 
we have common to this group and we're
gonna<00:03:59.970> be<00:04:00.150> okay<00:04:00.720> we<00:04:01.170> go<00:04:01.319> common<00:04:01.739> to<00:04:01.889> this<00:04:02.010> screw

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
gonna be okay we go common to this screw

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.099 
gonna be okay we go common to this screw
without<00:04:02.400> flipping<00:04:02.790> the<00:04:03.000> switch<00:04:03.090> mmm

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:04.109 
without flipping the switch mmm

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:05.960 
without flipping the switch mmm
and<00:04:04.380> we<00:04:04.620> get<00:04:04.739> a<00:04:04.769> beep<00:04:04.980> so<00:04:05.370> that<00:04:05.549> was<00:04:05.730> where<00:04:05.880> the

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
and we get a beep so that was where the

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.849 
and we get a beep so that was where the
light<00:04:06.150> was<00:04:06.299> staying<00:04:06.540> on<00:04:06.720> because<00:04:07.590> both<00:04:07.829> of

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:07.859 
light was staying on because both of

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:09.890 
light was staying on because both of
these<00:04:08.130> are<00:04:08.239> allowing<00:04:09.239> the<00:04:09.359> current<00:04:09.630> to<00:04:09.750> go

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
these are allowing the current to go

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.390 
these are allowing the current to go
from<00:04:10.170> screw<00:04:10.380> to<00:04:10.500> screw<00:04:10.590> this<00:04:11.010> is<00:04:11.130> a<00:04:11.160> wonder

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
from screw to screw this is a wonder

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.460 
from screw to screw this is a wonder
