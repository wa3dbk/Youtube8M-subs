and you can see this tree has grown

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.229 
and you can see this tree has grown
quite<00:02:55.829> a<00:02:55.919> bit<00:02:55.980> from<00:02:56.939> there<00:02:58.489> to<00:02:59.489> about<00:02:59.879> there

quite a bit from there to about there
it's<00:03:00.510> grown<00:03:00.750> about<00:03:00.959> 32<00:03:01.560> inches<00:03:01.590> so<00:03:02.159> far<00:03:02.189> this

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:02.579 
it's grown about 32 inches so far this

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:06.020 
it's grown about 32 inches so far this
year<00:03:02.639> and<00:03:04.040> this<00:03:05.040> growth<00:03:05.340> rate<00:03:05.639> is<00:03:05.790> still

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
year and this growth rate is still

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.909 
year and this growth rate is still
growing<00:03:06.299> it<00:03:06.540> still<00:03:06.870> putting<00:03:07.290> out<00:03:07.409> a<00:03:07.439> lot<00:03:07.739> of

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:15.649 
growth at least about a half an inch a
day<00:03:09.840> so<00:03:10.739> you<00:03:10.829> can<00:03:10.949> almost<00:03:11.250> see<00:03:11.549> it<00:03:11.849> grow<00:03:14.659> the
