need<00:00:09.510> precise<00:00:10.410> moulds<00:00:10.920> taken<00:00:11.400> so<00:00:12.090> they<00:00:12.509> can

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
need precise moulds taken so they can

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.660 
need precise moulds taken so they can
get<00:00:12.690> the<00:00:12.809> trays<00:00:13.080> to<00:00:13.290> fit<00:00:13.320> just<00:00:13.650> perfectly<00:00:14.190> and

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
get the trays to fit just perfectly and

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.670 
get the trays to fit just perfectly and
they<00:00:14.849> can<00:00:15.089> get<00:00:15.269> accurate<00:00:15.839> tooth<00:00:16.440> movement

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
they can get accurate tooth movement

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.210 
they can get accurate tooth movement
also<00:00:17.480> so<00:00:18.480> this<00:00:18.690> is<00:00:18.869> the<00:00:19.020> material<00:00:19.350> they<00:00:19.710> use<00:00:19.949> to

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
also so this is the material they use to

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.859 
also so this is the material they use to
take<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.550> mold<00:00:20.760> of<00:00:20.880> your<00:00:20.939> teeth<00:00:21.330> it's<00:00:21.689> a

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
take the mold of your teeth it's a

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.090 
take the mold of your teeth it's a
little<00:00:22.140> bit<00:00:22.230> different<00:00:22.619> than<00:00:22.769> what<00:00:22.920> they

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
little bit different than what they

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.820 
little bit different than what they
would<00:00:23.250> normally<00:00:23.430> use<00:00:23.730> it's<00:00:24.240> thicker<00:00:24.720> so<00:00:25.710> the

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
would normally use it's thicker so the

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.290 
would normally use it's thicker so the
first<00:00:26.070> one<00:00:26.250> they<00:00:26.340> use<00:00:26.490> is<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:26.789> purple<00:00:27.180> one

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
first one they use is the purple one

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.210 
first one they use is the purple one
that's<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.750> thick<00:00:27.990> one<00:00:28.230> and<00:00:28.500> then<00:00:28.920> they<00:00:29.039> go

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
that's the thick one and then they go

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.999 
that's the thick one and then they go
over<00:00:29.490> with<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:30.390> green<00:00:31.260> one<00:00:31.470> it's<00:00:31.619> a<00:00:31.740> little

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
over with the green one it's a little

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.620 
over with the green one it's a little
bit<00:00:32.130> thinner<00:00:32.460> so<00:00:32.579> they<00:00:32.880> can<00:00:33.059> get<00:00:33.180> all<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.420> fine

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
bit thinner so they can get all the fine

00:00:33.630 --> 00:02:23.900 
bit thinner so they can get all the fine
details<00:00:34.320> of<00:00:34.469> your<00:00:34.590> teeth
