00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:18.090
 team gender is a passionate 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:20.760
 by the same fanatical 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.430
 of those who do everything for the team in 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:27.180
 each corner of the house is a 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:31.470
 remember the passion mugs cups up an egg 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:33.980
 of Easter believe 2010 closed up 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.980
 today 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:45.890
 but something differentiates this supporter 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:48.170
 fanatic wants to see only you should already have 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.690
 heard or even saw in some 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:53.780

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:56.330

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.360
 times 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.210
 now you know someone who collects 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.940
 because only one team is 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.560
 person is the Renee or Baron as he is 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.260
 known here it has 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.280
 approximately 100 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.950
 fluminense 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.320
 the collection began by chance every time 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.720
 more in love with the tricolor 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.180
 the baron went on to buy all the 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:24.500
 shirts were thrown shirts 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:27.170
 some rare official ones like this of 1981 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.210
 the oldest collector 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.450
 the passion that passed generations and generations 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.340
 my grandfather passed me I shot my type 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.040
 oh just for me and I 'm going through with 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.440
 My son has people who have tim 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.750
 I'm part of the team. I'm a fan of 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.760
 accompany years or the penalty that the supporter 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.440
 I am part of the story of the last self 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.150
 I make history in the team. 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.820
 do not keep clothes shirts stay 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:53.270
 organized by year goalkeeper training 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:56.210
 player coats and the ones he wears 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:58.850
 Of course in the games here nobody moves 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:02.060
 besides him and he remembers each one the 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:06.710
 first shirt of 1992 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:09.350
 he also won this one from 1995 without 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.900
 Sponsorship also has its value 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:14.450
 It all started in 2005 when the 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.560
 was champion of Rio against the return 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.780
 round 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:21.080
 Renier accompanied the good campaign 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:23.560
 of the tricolor and fell in love with the shirt 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.150
 of this historical year it also has 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.940
 autographed by some players 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.610
 each shirt cost on average 100 reais 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:34.450
 but some were more expensive like this 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.470
 of the deco that renner had to disburse 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.570
 500 reais 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.430
 but for him there is no price to pay 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:42.920
 some relics 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:46.940
 for example was the centenary of the 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:50.060
 in 2002 autographed by players 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:52.680
 shirt here that has neither 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:55.230
 price for me the shirt in 1981 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.629
 The team gave a lot against their will but 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:00.180
 Gave me the shirt is the way of the deco in 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:04.620
 cruise game was four time champion now 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:07.620
 of 2005 spelled by the whole team shirt 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:10.200
 1985 that year sponsorship in the 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.989
 season black phase disappeared and was champion 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.159
 Brazilian and other ballads 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:16.829
 paths that it has price 

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:20.489
 each shirt has its value even 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:22.560
 the one that looks ugly the first orange 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:25.409
 also not very pleased 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.629
 the collector has still new shirts 

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:30.930
 which he exchanges during games 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:34.379
 in fact everything happens during games 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:36.780
 the baron buys he sells and exchanges shirts 

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:39.540
 in fact this whole passion started there 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:42.629
 many years when renê was still 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:45.840
 child and fanaticism went from father to 

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:48.030
 son rian of six years already was born 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.819
 wearing the colors of the flu 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:53.939
 today you also have your shirts and 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:57.810
 Rene has already warned the next child will 

00:03:53.939 --> 00:04:02.629
 call the conca is already if it is you do not matter 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:02.629
 with whom if it will be point
