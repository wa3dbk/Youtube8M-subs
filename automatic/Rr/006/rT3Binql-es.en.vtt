00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:00.410 
of course and then a little bit of a

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.139 
of course and then a little bit of a
little<00:01:00.710> bit<00:01:00.829> of<00:01:00.920> black<00:01:01.100> pepper<00:01:01.130> now<00:01:01.850> there<00:01:02.030> is

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:02.149 
little bit of black pepper now there is

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:04.179 
little bit of black pepper now there is
a<00:01:02.180> difference<00:01:02.600> you<00:01:02.809> will<00:01:03.500> see<00:01:03.770> some<00:01:03.950> places

00:01:04.179 --> 00:01:04.189 
a difference you will see some places

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:06.039 
a difference you will see some places
that<00:01:04.489> say<00:01:04.640> uses<00:01:04.939> white<00:01:05.119> pepper<00:01:05.329> or<00:01:05.689> use

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:06.049 
that say uses white pepper or use

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:07.599 
that say uses white pepper or use
crushed<00:01:06.380> pepper<00:01:06.619> there<00:01:07.130> is<00:01:07.249> a<00:01:07.280> big<00:01:07.490> difference

00:01:07.599 --> 00:01:07.609 
crushed pepper there is a big difference

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:09.429 
crushed pepper there is a big difference
in<00:01:07.909> pepper<00:01:08.090> so<00:01:08.329> for<00:01:08.479> this<00:01:08.600> particular<00:01:08.780> dish<00:01:09.289> I

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:09.439 
in pepper so for this particular dish I

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:11.289 
in pepper so for this particular dish I
think<00:01:09.590> black<00:01:09.829> pepper<00:01:10.100> is<00:01:10.280> the<00:01:10.399> best<00:01:10.609> now<00:01:11.149> over

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:11.299 
think black pepper is the best now over
