he asked a new airplane smell I love it
um<00:02:37.990> I<00:02:39.120> don't<00:02:40.120> know<00:02:40.240> much<00:02:40.450> about<00:02:40.480> this<00:02:40.840> airplane

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
um I don't know much about this airplane

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.030 
um I don't know much about this airplane
because<00:02:41.290> I<00:02:41.890> never<00:02:42.510> really<00:02:43.510> see<00:02:43.780> these<00:02:43.930> a<00:02:44.320> lot<00:02:44.410> I

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
because I never really see these a lot I

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.520
