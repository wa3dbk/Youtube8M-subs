00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:14.850
 well we are here in the lagoon of wolves 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.690
 in the part of the gate what 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:17.690
 we want to document 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.830
 it's how poorly made the new 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:25.210
 gate 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.210
 if we are getting closer 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.870
 on this side 

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:34.150
 we can see how it is 

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:36.550
 overflowing on top because the 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:40.530
 gate is closed 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.530
 it's just those four quotes from the middle 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.469
 those that open 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:52.760
 the rest the sides are closed 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.760
 and as we see it is on the edge 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.579
 looking at water 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:04.320
 so we already have there 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:05.970
 very low the container slabs 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.620
 because it could quietly be a 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.890
 little bit higher if the lagoon does not lose 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.450
 each egg 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.810
 for the surprise when we leave the 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.810
 other side 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.730
 On the other hand we can observe 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:25.730
 as for example in these first two 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:28.690
 squares is the jet of water that 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:32.280
 surpasses above 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:32.280
 but this one that is lost from below 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:39.140
 so if those spears have 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:42.020
 approximately about 60 70 centimeters 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:45.430
 must have from overflow to 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:48.350
 down and the lagoon we have it 1 meter 50 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:51.300
 those 70 centimeters when it keeps going down 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.070
 the water leaves the lagoon in 80 centimeters 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.560
 and there it happens what happens, everyone dies 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.470
 the fish when summer arrives a 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.640
 repeated story that always happens here and 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.570
 that the municipality does not 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.570
 absolutely nothing 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.640
 in all the slabs there are losses for 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.640
 down 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:15.180
 the lagoon this summer was with less 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.180
 80 centimeters 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.010
 I did not even throw water down because 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.920
 the puddle was already being made in the 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:24.860
 half nobody did anything to repair it 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:27.050
 when it could be repaired 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.910
 Now, what is the use of doing what is done? 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:31.460
 If this one is always going to be 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:34.220
 losing until the day he deigns 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:35.569
 fix the law solve the problem 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.230
 of the flow 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:40.450
 as long as the municipality does not do anything 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:43.470
 this gateway losing of the amount 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.540
 of water that loses 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.990
 the same will always happen in the lagoon 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.990
 of achievements
