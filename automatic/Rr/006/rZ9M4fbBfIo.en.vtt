let's<00:00:28.980> get<00:00:29.160> right<00:00:29.310> into<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.789> list<00:00:30.029> number<00:00:30.869> one

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
let's get right into the list number one

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.970 
let's get right into the list number one
is<00:00:31.500> continuous<00:00:32.450> overload<00:00:33.450> progression<00:00:34.440> and

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
is continuous overload progression and

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.440 
is continuous overload progression and
this<00:00:35.280> is<00:00:35.399> where<00:00:35.579> keeping<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:35.940> workout<00:00:36.239> log

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
this is where keeping a workout log

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.930 
this is where keeping a workout log
really<00:00:36.750> comes<00:00:36.989> in<00:00:37.110> handy<00:00:37.170> so<00:00:37.800> basically<00:00:38.250> on

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
really comes in handy so basically on

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.819 
really comes in handy so basically on
all<00:00:39.270> your<00:00:39.420> compound<00:00:39.960> lifts<00:00:40.230> especially<00:00:40.710> you

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
all your compound lifts especially you

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.920 
all your compound lifts especially you
want<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.100> continue<00:00:41.610> to<00:00:41.790> put<00:00:41.969> more<00:00:42.149> overload<00:00:42.660> on

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
want to continue to put more overload on

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.500 
want to continue to put more overload on
those<00:00:43.170> muscle<00:00:43.559> groups<00:00:43.590> so<00:00:44.430> by<00:00:44.820> continuous

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
those muscle groups so by continuous

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.750 
those muscle groups so by continuous
overload<00:00:45.989> progression<00:00:46.649> I<00:00:46.860> mean<00:00:47.430> you're

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
overload progression I mean you're

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.220 
overload progression I mean you're
increasing<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.480> weight<00:00:48.660> you're<00:00:48.840> increasing

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
increasing the weight you're increasing

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.830 
increasing the weight you're increasing
the<00:00:49.500> repetitions<00:00:50.129> every<00:00:50.879> single<00:00:51.210> workout<00:00:51.510> so

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
the repetitions every single workout so

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.590 
the repetitions every single workout so
never<00:00:52.110> go<00:00:52.320> in<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.559> gym<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:53.149> your<00:00:54.149> goal<00:00:54.360> should

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
never go in the gym and your goal should

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.150 
never go in the gym and your goal should
never<00:00:54.780> be<00:00:54.930> to<00:00:55.140> do<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.379> same<00:00:55.649> weight<00:00:55.920> in<00:00:56.100> the

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
never be to do the same weight in the

outside<00:01:14.010> your<00:01:14.220> comfort<00:01:14.490> zone<00:01:14.670> that<00:01:15.090> is<00:01:15.360> a

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
outside your comfort zone that is a

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.270 
outside your comfort zone that is a
guaranteed<00:01:16.080> way<00:01:16.320> to<00:01:16.350> pack<00:01:16.890> on<00:01:17.070> lean<00:01:17.250> muscle

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
guaranteed way to pack on lean muscle

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.210 
guaranteed way to pack on lean muscle
mass<00:01:18.020> you<00:01:19.020> will<00:01:19.140> increase<00:01:19.439> your<00:01:19.560> strength<00:01:20.040> as

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
mass you will increase your strength as

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.830 
mass you will increase your strength as
you<00:01:20.280> increase<00:01:20.820> your<00:01:21.000> lean<00:01:21.180> muscle<00:01:21.299> mass<00:01:21.630> they

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
you increase your lean muscle mass they

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:22.789 
you increase your lean muscle mass they
go<00:01:21.960> hand-in-hand

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
go hand-in-hand

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.920 
go hand-in-hand
so<00:01:22.950> whether<00:01:23.520> goal<00:01:23.880> is<00:01:24.090> to<00:01:24.360> you<00:01:24.600> know<00:01:24.720> look

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
so whether goal is to you know look

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.420 
so whether goal is to you know look
bigger<00:01:25.200> or<00:01:25.530> get<00:01:25.680> stronger<00:01:26.040> they<00:01:26.310> go

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
bigger or get stronger they go

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.950 
bigger or get stronger they go
hand-in-hand<00:01:26.759> so<00:01:27.180> focus<00:01:27.630> on<00:01:27.780> getting

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
hand-in-hand so focus on getting

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.109 
hand-in-hand so focus on getting
stronger<00:01:28.350> with<00:01:28.979> continuous<00:01:29.670> overload

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
stronger with continuous overload

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.920 
stronger with continuous overload
progression<00:01:30.750> number<00:01:31.740> two<00:01:32.070> is<00:01:32.450> time<00:01:33.450> under

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
progression number two is time under

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.460 
progression number two is time under
tension<00:01:33.960> sets<00:01:34.700> this<00:01:35.700> is<00:01:35.759> a<00:01:36.240> huge<00:01:36.810> free<00:01:37.110> human

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
tension sets this is a huge free human

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.749 
tension sets this is a huge free human
growth<00:01:37.619> hormone<00:01:37.950> levels<00:01:37.979> so<00:01:38.400> basically

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
growth hormone levels so basically

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.609 
growth hormone levels so basically
instead<00:01:39.060> of<00:01:39.150> counting<00:01:39.450> repetitions<00:01:40.110> you're

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
instead of counting repetitions you're

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:41.810 
instead of counting repetitions you're
going<00:01:40.740> to<00:01:40.799> count<00:01:40.979> your<00:01:41.100> time<00:01:41.430> under<00:01:41.790> tension

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
going to count your time under tension

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.510 
going to count your time under tension
so<00:01:42.420> you<00:01:42.479> keep<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:42.840> muscle<00:01:43.200> under<00:01:43.470> tension<00:01:43.710> for

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
so you keep the muscle under tension for

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.130 
so you keep the muscle under tension for
thirty<00:01:44.850> seconds<00:01:45.329> at<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.479> bare<00:01:45.630> minimum<00:01:45.659> so

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
thirty seconds at the bare minimum so

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.960 
thirty seconds at the bare minimum so
what<00:01:46.290> this<00:01:46.409> does<00:01:46.590> is<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:47.130> lactic<00:01:47.520> acid<00:01:47.880> is
