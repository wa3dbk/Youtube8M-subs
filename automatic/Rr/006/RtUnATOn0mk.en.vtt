00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.349 

I<00:00:18.169> will<00:00:19.169> say<00:00:19.410> this<00:00:19.619> our<00:00:20.369> friend<00:00:20.730> who<00:00:21.000> didn't

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
I will say this our friend who didn't

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.169 
I will say this our friend who didn't
start<00:00:21.509> up<00:00:21.869> this<00:00:22.050> way<00:00:22.289> grounder<00:00:23.279> for<00:00:23.519> a<00:00:23.669> sale<00:00:23.939> to

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:24.179 
start up this way grounder for a sale to

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:26.569 
start up this way grounder for a sale to
be<00:00:24.300> changed<00:00:24.660> so<00:00:24.779> profoundly<00:00:25.430> basically<00:00:26.430> the

00:00:26.569 --> 00:00:26.579 
be changed so profoundly basically the

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:28.609 
be changed so profoundly basically the
DNA<00:00:26.970> is<00:00:27.000> going<00:00:27.329> to<00:00:27.390> have<00:00:27.539> to<00:00:27.660> be<00:00:27.779> mutated<00:00:28.380> it's

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
DNA is going to have to be mutated it's

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.290 
DNA is going to have to be mutated it's
like<00:00:28.829> the<00:00:28.980> genetic<00:00:29.340> code<00:00:29.579> of<00:00:29.609> that<00:00:29.880> sale<00:00:30.149> is

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
like the genetic code of that sale is

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.509 
like the genetic code of that sale is
going<00:00:30.419> to<00:00:30.509> have<00:00:30.630> to<00:00:30.750> be<00:00:30.779> reprogrammed<00:00:31.340> and<00:00:32.340> so

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:32.519 
going to have to be reprogrammed and so

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:33.979 
going to have to be reprogrammed and so
many<00:00:32.640> there<00:00:32.790> are<00:00:32.879> things<00:00:33.090> out<00:00:33.269> there<00:00:33.300> that<00:00:33.570> can

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
many there are things out there that can

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.810 
many there are things out there that can
have<00:00:34.290> you<00:00:34.739> know<00:00:34.829> those<00:00:35.100> sort<00:00:35.309> of<00:00:35.339> effects<00:00:35.640> on

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
have you know those sort of effects on

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.720 
have you know those sort of effects on
your<00:00:35.970> cells<00:00:37.010> environmental<00:00:38.010> factors<00:00:38.430> such<00:00:38.699> as

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
your cells environmental factors such as

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.920 
your cells environmental factors such as
radiation<00:00:39.800> cigarette<00:00:40.800> smoke<00:00:41.159> and<00:00:41.370> even<00:00:42.239> the

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
radiation cigarette smoke and even the

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.410 
radiation cigarette smoke and even the
genetic<00:00:43.409> parasites<00:00:44.010> that<00:00:44.159> we<00:00:44.399> call<00:00:44.610> viruses<00:00:45.239> a

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
genetic parasites that we call viruses a

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.930 
genetic parasites that we call viruses a
virus<00:00:46.350> will<00:00:46.589> at<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:46.920> simplest<00:00:47.399> level<00:00:47.489> it's

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
virus will at the simplest level it's

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.490 
virus will at the simplest level it's
basically<00:00:48.390> a<00:00:48.479> piece<00:00:48.720> of<00:00:48.750> genetic<00:00:49.229> information

basically a piece of genetic information

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.219 
basically a piece of genetic information
either<00:00:50.250> DNA<00:00:50.670> or<00:00:50.939> it<00:00:51.600> could<00:00:51.780> be<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:52.019> sister

called a retrovirus and what's special
about<00:01:03.299> a<00:01:03.449> retrovirus<00:01:04.290> is<00:01:04.439> that<00:01:04.769> unlike<00:01:05.070> most

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
about a retrovirus is that unlike most

about a retrovirus is that unlike most
types<00:01:05.549> of<00:01:05.759> viruses<00:01:05.970> it<00:01:06.689> can<00:01:06.900> actually<00:01:07.049> make

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
types of viruses it can actually make

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.440 
types of viruses it can actually make
yourself<00:01:07.890> part<00:01:08.220> of<00:01:08.310> our<00:01:08.460> genetic<00:01:08.880> material

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
yourself part of our genetic material

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.240 
yourself part of our genetic material
there's<00:01:09.630> a<00:01:10.020> couple<00:01:10.229> different<00:01:10.619> well-known

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
there's a couple different well-known

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.609 
there's a couple different well-known
retroviruses<00:01:11.970> probably<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.079> best<00:01:13.259> known<00:01:13.350> is

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
retroviruses probably the best known is

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.340 
retroviruses probably the best known is
HIV<00:01:14.189> there's<00:01:14.939> also<00:01:15.180> other<00:01:15.689> types<00:01:15.840> in<00:01:16.229> that

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
HIV there's also other types in that

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.560 
HIV there's also other types in that
class<00:01:16.650> which<00:01:17.430> are<00:01:17.610> feline<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.270> murine

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
class which are feline and murine

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.600 
class which are feline and murine
leukemia<00:01:18.600> viruses<00:01:19.530> and<00:01:19.799> a<00:01:20.280> lot<00:01:20.430> of<00:01:20.460> the

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
leukemia viruses and a lot of the

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.160 
leukemia viruses and a lot of the
viruses<00:01:21.000> that<00:01:21.030> are<00:01:21.150> responsible<00:01:21.810> for<00:01:21.840> causing

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
viruses that are responsible for causing

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:31.840 
viruses that are responsible for causing
cancer<00:01:22.560> are<00:01:23.219> also<00:01:23.429> retroviruses

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.240 

so<00:01:32.420> it<00:01:32.570> looks<00:01:32.600> here<00:01:33.110> that<00:01:33.409> the<00:01:33.740> genes<00:01:33.979> that<00:01:34.100> the

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 
so it looks here that the genes that the

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:35.740 
so it looks here that the genes that the
virus<00:01:34.400> carried<00:01:34.970> are<00:01:35.119> starting<00:01:35.509> to<00:01:35.540> be

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
virus carried are starting to be

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.810 
virus carried are starting to be
expressed<00:01:36.259> in<00:01:36.500> bowman<00:01:37.040> the<00:01:37.369> fact<00:01:37.580> that<00:01:37.640> he's

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
expressed in bowman the fact that he's

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.070 
expressed in bowman the fact that he's
bleeding<00:01:38.180> from<00:01:38.330> his<00:01:38.420> nose<00:01:38.479> is<00:01:38.900> quite

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.080 
bleeding from his nose is quite

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.260 
bleeding from his nose is quite
interesting<00:01:39.619> because<00:01:39.830> a<00:01:40.340> lot<00:01:40.940> of<00:01:40.970> viruses

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
interesting because a lot of viruses

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.399 
interesting because a lot of viruses
that<00:01:41.690> have<00:01:41.930> a<00:01:42.320> very<00:01:43.330> rapid<00:01:44.330> course<00:01:45.200> of

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:45.409 
that have a very rapid course of

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:46.840 
that have a very rapid course of
infection<00:01:45.530> through<00:01:46.070> your<00:01:46.220> body<00:01:46.369> things<00:01:46.700> like

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
infection through your body things like

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.120 
infection through your body things like
the<00:01:46.939> hemorrhagic<00:01:47.180> fever<00:01:47.720> viruses<00:01:48.350> one<00:01:48.979> of<00:01:49.070> the

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
the hemorrhagic fever viruses one of the

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.070 
the hemorrhagic fever viruses one of the
things<00:01:49.340> they<00:01:49.520> do<00:01:49.580> is<00:01:50.060> they<00:01:50.390> basically<00:01:50.570> dis

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 
things they do is they basically dis

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.350 
things they do is they basically dis
regulate<00:01:51.590> your<00:01:51.710> body<00:01:51.950> your<00:01:52.640> body<00:01:52.759> knows<00:01:53.090> it's

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 
regulate your body your body knows it's

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.450 
regulate your body your body knows it's
been<00:01:53.479> infected<00:01:53.720> with<00:01:53.990> a<00:01:54.020> virus<00:01:54.110> all<00:01:54.950> sorts<00:01:55.340> of

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
been infected with a virus all sorts of

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:56.920 
been infected with a virus all sorts of
things<00:01:55.610> all<00:01:55.940> sorts<00:01:56.149> of<00:01:56.210> alarm<00:01:56.509> bells<00:01:56.750> are

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
things all sorts of alarm bells are

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.859 
things all sorts of alarm bells are
going<00:01:56.960> off<00:01:57.320> and<00:01:58.009> one<00:01:58.220> of<00:01:58.250> the<00:01:58.840> consequences<00:01:59.840> of

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
going off and one of the consequences of

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:02.109 
going off and one of the consequences of
that<00:02:00.020> is<00:02:00.409> that<00:02:00.560> you<00:02:00.680> basically<00:02:00.909> lose<00:02:01.909> the

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
that is that you basically lose the

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:04.719 
that is that you basically lose the
ability<00:02:02.210> to<00:02:02.960> maintain<00:02:03.470> your<00:02:04.009> blood<00:02:04.399> and<00:02:04.640> your

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
ability to maintain your blood and your

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:06.820 
ability to maintain your blood and your
body<00:02:04.940> fluids<00:02:05.509> in<00:02:05.690> the<00:02:05.840> normal<00:02:06.170> compartments

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
body fluids in the normal compartments

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.650 
body fluids in the normal compartments
so<00:02:07.250> you'll<00:02:07.399> see<00:02:07.580> bleeding<00:02:08.000> from<00:02:08.269> your<00:02:08.450> nose

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
so you'll see bleeding from your nose

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.779 
so you'll see bleeding from your nose
and<00:02:09.110> from<00:02:09.289> your<00:02:09.440> eyes<00:02:09.649> that's<00:02:10.459> one<00:02:10.640> of<00:02:10.729> the

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
and from your eyes that's one of the

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.780 
and from your eyes that's one of the
characteristics<00:02:11.209> of<00:02:11.890> viral<00:02:12.890> diseases<00:02:13.250> such

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
characteristics of viral diseases such

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.600 
characteristics of viral diseases such
as<00:02:13.850> Ebola<00:02:14.560> we<00:02:15.560> got<00:02:15.709> the<00:02:15.830> blood<00:02:16.010> work<00:02:16.190> back<00:02:16.220> you

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
as Ebola we got the blood work back you

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.110 
as Ebola we got the blood work back you
were<00:02:16.730> right<00:02:16.910> it<00:02:17.420> is<00:02:17.540> Marshall<00:02:17.930> Bowman

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
were right it is Marshall Bowman

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.940 
were right it is Marshall Bowman
anything<00:02:20.120> else<00:02:20.300> yeah<00:02:20.930> Walter<00:02:21.380> seems<00:02:21.620> to<00:02:21.769> think

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
anything else yeah Walter seems to think

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.110 
anything else yeah Walter seems to think
that<00:02:22.069> he<00:02:22.160> was<00:02:22.250> dosed<00:02:22.550> with<00:02:22.700> some<00:02:22.910> kind<00:02:23.090> of

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
that he was dosed with some kind of

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.300 
that he was dosed with some kind of
designer<00:02:23.480> virus<00:02:23.750> so<00:02:24.410> it<00:02:24.560> was<00:02:24.709> intentional

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
designer virus so it was intentional

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:26.770 
designer virus so it was intentional
hard<00:02:25.819> to<00:02:25.910> say<00:02:26.060> it<00:02:26.150> was<00:02:26.239> an<00:02:26.330> accident<00:02:26.630> this

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
hard to say it was an accident this

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.390 
hard to say it was an accident this
stuff<00:02:26.959> doesn't<00:02:27.140> exist<00:02:27.530> in<00:02:27.650> nature<00:02:27.799> so<00:02:28.250> with

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
stuff doesn't exist in nature so with

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.000 
stuff doesn't exist in nature so with
designer<00:02:28.670> virus<00:02:28.910> is<00:02:29.299> basically<00:02:29.930> you<00:02:30.650> take<00:02:30.830> an

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
designer virus is basically you take an

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.059 
designer virus is basically you take an
existing<00:02:31.280> virus<00:02:31.900> and<00:02:32.900> you<00:02:33.110> can<00:02:33.290> remove<00:02:33.620> parts

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:34.069 
existing virus and you can remove parts

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:36.460 
existing virus and you can remove parts
of<00:02:34.190> that<00:02:34.340> virus<00:02:34.519> and<00:02:34.970> replace<00:02:35.299> it<00:02:35.330> with<00:02:35.569> genes

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
of that virus and replace it with genes

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.229 
of that virus and replace it with genes
of<00:02:36.620> interest<00:02:36.709> there<00:02:37.400> are<00:02:37.519> lots<00:02:37.610> of<00:02:37.790> labs<00:02:38.030> out

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
of interest there are lots of labs out

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:40.210 
of interest there are lots of labs out
there<00:02:38.540> that<00:02:38.750> are<00:02:38.780> actually<00:02:39.019> able<00:02:39.530> to<00:02:40.010> make

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
there that are actually able to make

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.819 
there that are actually able to make
viruses<00:02:41.120> why<00:02:41.930> would<00:02:42.110> people<00:02:42.470> do<00:02:42.650> that

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:42.829 
viruses why would people do that

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:45.039 
viruses why would people do that
probably<00:02:43.459> the<00:02:43.579> field<00:02:43.850> of<00:02:44.060> gene<00:02:44.299> therapy<00:02:44.329> best

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:45.049 
probably the field of gene therapy best

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:47.080 
probably the field of gene therapy best
illustrates<00:02:45.650> how<00:02:45.829> viruses<00:02:46.220> can<00:02:46.579> be<00:02:46.700> used<00:02:46.970> for

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
illustrates how viruses can be used for

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.319 
illustrates how viruses can be used for
good<00:02:47.239> and<00:02:47.720> gene<00:02:48.680> therapy<00:02:49.190> basically<00:02:49.760> takes

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:50.329 
good and gene therapy basically takes

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:53.470 
good and gene therapy basically takes
the<00:02:50.510> virus<00:02:50.930> and<00:02:51.170> uses<00:02:51.739> it's<00:02:52.180> useful<00:02:53.180> traits

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
the virus and uses it's useful traits

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.240 
the virus and uses it's useful traits
the<00:02:53.750> fact<00:02:53.989> that<00:02:54.079> it<00:02:54.230> can<00:02:54.380> get<00:02:54.530> into<00:02:54.829> our<00:02:54.950> bodies

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
the fact that it can get into our bodies

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.490 
the fact that it can get into our bodies
and<00:02:55.280> deliver<00:02:55.760> genetic<00:02:56.209> material<00:02:56.720> and<00:02:57.079> it<00:02:57.260> uses

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
and deliver genetic material and it uses

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.340 
and deliver genetic material and it uses
those<00:02:57.799> to<00:02:57.859> deliver<00:02:58.489> not<00:02:58.760> a<00:02:58.790> deadly<00:02:59.239> virus<00:02:59.350> but

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
those to deliver not a deadly virus but

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.319 
those to deliver not a deadly virus but
a<00:03:00.380> gene<00:03:00.859> that's<00:03:01.130> gonna<00:03:01.310> have<00:03:01.549> benefit<00:03:02.060> to<00:03:02.239> an

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:02.329 
a gene that's gonna have benefit to an

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:08.460 
a gene that's gonna have benefit to an
individual<00:03:02.870> patient<00:03:06.130> your<00:03:07.130> nose<00:03:07.310> is<00:03:07.489> bleeding

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
individual patient your nose is bleeding

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.500

whoever<00:03:09.470> box<00:03:09.769> of<00:03:09.950> tissues<00:03:10.310> please

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
whoever box of tissues please

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.820 
whoever box of tissues please
no<00:03:14.280> no<00:03:15.280> tissues<00:03:15.850> won't<00:03:16.560> get<00:03:17.560> me<00:03:17.650> some

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:17.830 
no no tissues won't get me some

no no tissues won't get me some
signatures<00:03:18.210> I<00:03:19.210> think<00:03:19.480> in<00:03:19.900> the<00:03:20.200> future<00:03:20.230> will

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:20.740 
signatures I think in the future will

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.470 
signatures I think in the future will
once<00:03:21.100> the<00:03:21.220> whole<00:03:21.370> process<00:03:21.790> is<00:03:21.880> understood

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
once the whole process is understood

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.170 
once the whole process is understood
once<00:03:22.810> all<00:03:22.960> the<00:03:23.200> genes<00:03:23.500> that<00:03:24.190> have<00:03:24.730> been

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
once all the genes that have been

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.300 
once all the genes that have been
revealed<00:03:25.570> through<00:03:25.840> the<00:03:26.020> the<00:03:26.770> sequencing<00:03:27.280> of

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
revealed through the the sequencing of

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.250 
revealed through the the sequencing of
the<00:03:27.370> human<00:03:27.430> genome<00:03:27.700> are<00:03:28.150> are<00:03:28.420> understood

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
the human genome are are understood

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:30.720 
the human genome are are understood
we'll<00:03:29.650> start<00:03:29.890> to<00:03:30.010> really<00:03:30.160> understand<00:03:30.640> the

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
we'll start to really understand the

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.700 
we'll start to really understand the
genetic<00:03:31.060> basis<00:03:31.450> for<00:03:31.750> for<00:03:32.200> a<00:03:32.230> lot<00:03:32.500> of<00:03:32.620> these

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:32.710 
genetic basis for for a lot of these

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:34.650 
genetic basis for for a lot of these
diseases<00:03:32.950> much<00:03:33.400> better<00:03:33.610> than<00:03:33.790> we<00:03:33.940> do<00:03:34.090> now<00:03:34.270> I

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
diseases much better than we do now I

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.870 
diseases much better than we do now I
think<00:03:35.200> this<00:03:35.320> F<00:03:35.560> is<00:03:35.710> so<00:03:35.980> transformation

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
think this F is so transformation

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.970 
think this F is so transformation
actually<00:03:37.210> you<00:03:37.630> know<00:03:37.750> touches<00:03:38.170> on<00:03:38.350> quite<00:03:38.830> a<00:03:38.860> few

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
actually you know touches on quite a few

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.160 
actually you know touches on quite a few
really<00:03:39.760> cutting-edge<00:03:40.270> aspects<00:03:40.810> of<00:03:40.900> science

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 
really cutting-edge aspects of science

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:42.900 
really cutting-edge aspects of science
though<00:03:41.620> it's<00:03:41.770> talking<00:03:42.100> about<00:03:42.340> designer

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
though it's talking about designer

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:47.270 
though it's talking about designer
viruses<00:03:43.950> bioterrorism<00:03:45.090> gene<00:03:46.090> therapy<00:03:46.720> and

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
viruses bioterrorism gene therapy and

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.370 
viruses bioterrorism gene therapy and
reprogramming<00:03:48.280> cells<00:03:48.760> to<00:03:49.210> create<00:03:49.750> different

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
reprogramming cells to create different

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:52.020 
reprogramming cells to create different
types<00:03:50.560> of<00:03:50.710> tissues<00:03:51.100> which<00:03:51.310> is<00:03:51.520> stem<00:03:51.790> cell

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
types of tissues which is stem cell

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.300 
types of tissues which is stem cell
therapy<00:03:52.570> so<00:03:53.050> really<00:03:53.230> it's<00:03:53.500> kind<00:03:53.740> of<00:03:53.860> got<00:03:54.040> a<00:03:54.070> lot

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
therapy so really it's kind of got a lot

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.790 
therapy so really it's kind of got a lot
going<00:03:54.340> on
