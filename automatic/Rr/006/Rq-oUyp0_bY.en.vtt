00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:08.550
 so on it goes with part 4 meanwhile 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.110
 already the 50 50 killer from Steve Mosby 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.540
 in full there are still a few students 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.100
 now here is very good i can 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.900
 recommend however I like the 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:20.520
 world picture output is not as good as that 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:22.440
 We always have the original edition then 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.180
 we reject here recke press or 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.430
 Bresser unlikely the girl on 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:30.920
 cross plays in denmark when i am 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:34.079
 not crazy but rather boring 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:37.920
 death prayer by inge esch wolfer or 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:40.470
 what I read and almost not 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.079
 per 1 so that 's it now to students 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:45.660
 now fantasy comes a bit and 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.780
 though my little modest sebastian 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:52.170
 the nonsense markus heitz collection without 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.930
 an independent band ross very well 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.890
 but only four stars because they even 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.300
 not anymore but i definitely have 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.730
 but rated very much with four stars 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.829
 well i was reading unions 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.639
 and markus heitz is really right 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.649
 sympathetic totally funny guy there 

00:01:05.639 --> 00:01:10.229
 so the children of Judas is the Jew 

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:12.810
 first part of the series is handy 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:17.039
 three volumes judas children of judas judas 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:19.679
 Judas daughter or the other part first 

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:22.560
 super super good two g2 third part 

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:24.749
 I did not read then mine 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.229
 favorite books of his rite is mine 

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:29.490
 Absolute favorite is about werewolves must 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.929
 I did not know that before 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.700
 was also reading the text 

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:33.990
 not as enthusiastic as I am 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.079
 had noticed that it is about more 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.579
 but then it was so exciting that the 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.020
 last page read out and direct 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.810
 gone in the bookshop and with the 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.929
 second part bought the second volume 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.869
 have is sanctum is really true 

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:49.969
 well so markus heitz i also like very much 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.520

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:55.770

 other perspective is correct 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:29.859

 I have not read anything like that yet 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:59.480

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:05.800
 as of now the dark but that does not matter 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:11.260

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:14.270
 I have not read yet

 I did not like it at all 

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:46.070
 very very unusual let's say 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:49.000
 It is an average book but is 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:53.090
 not so very philosophical already 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.680
 then says refugium sacrificium I say 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:56.750

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:43.490
 getting a gift is a slow protection 

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:44.900
 I just have to keep my camera 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:46.220

 I like something so we have one here 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:57.080
 That's what girls are all about 

00:05:55.970 --> 00:06:00.160
 as long as I am not anymore 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.160

 I have not read yet 

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:21.470

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:24.560
 many books are aware of that 

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:27.640
 here is pretty bad karma i have 

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:29.780

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:34.190
 Of course, this is still happening in potsdam 

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:36.220
 much funnier and others yes and exactly where 

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:38.180

 my books are being interviewed 

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:45.680
 pretty all mischievous karma muzzles that 

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:48.410

 then we have my friend here 

00:06:52.910 --> 00:07:02.050

00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:02.050
 but can not remember it anymore 

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:07.610

 books are already 1000 years old 

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:33.650

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:55.470
 I read that was very funny 

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:58.920
 also a check with roman is very funny 

00:07:55.470 --> 00:08:05.370
