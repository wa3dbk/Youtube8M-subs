00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:05.750
 hey people turn on and have fun with 

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:08.210
 this video in which we look 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:12.049
 want how big the huawei are 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:13.759
 really is 61 in comparison draws 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:15.799
 the galaxy note of the first generation 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:17.840
 Almost small you will then 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:20.090
 look at everyday objects 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.400
 how big is that really ? 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.679
 I have prepared so much here 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.150
 just once on bars with a very 

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:29.119
 normal envelope 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:33.050
 while the camera is on so here 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:35.030
 yes almost din a5 big envelope that 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.910
 Everyone at home also has because you are today 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:41.059
 still get letters why writes 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:43.250
 precisely because it comes from the size 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:45.469
 finally really very good in the 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.629
 time from height we have that 

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:48.739
 Essent with really equate with 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:50.719
 an envelope 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:52.160
 otherwise if we place the because it 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:54.109
 Of course you have a lot on your right side 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.640
 in place but to know the listener 

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:57.590
 It's really good to learn that 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.129
 you have an envelope if you 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.600
 want to know how wide the whole thing is 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:05.420
 I have a delicious fox from 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:08.119
 chocolate for these almost from the 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.430
 it's pretty much exactly it 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:12.110
 is already incredible how fact this 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.630
 smartphone is actually you see that 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.610
 this is the bottom of where the blackboard is 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.820
 starts foxconn drawer you get like that 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:22.700
 pretty much in every shop and then end up 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.860
 we here exactly upside down I see 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.049
 already that is really a fat part 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.450
 You can probably have fun with that 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:30.710
 they are rather small for the people 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.770
 things I have the film synonymous mine 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.619
 normal chocolate bar 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:39.200
 here you can see that the blackboard 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:39.619
 less broad than it is from the 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.200
 height 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:44.810
 when they bend down and then times 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.250
 We also see that here, too 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.140
 Almost with the made one more 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.969
 is a bit longer means you need 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.219
 a board as thick as a 300 

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:53.659
 gramm panel and as long as 

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:56.450
 a little board then you have the 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:56.689
 Size the size also get quite good 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.789
 down 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:01.789
 if you have this funny plaster here 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:03.710
 Sponges have their hair on you if you 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:05.930
 namely, once lying across and one 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.520
 different in length you see you have 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.119
 again, pretty much the same 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.520
 size 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:15.010
 so it is already 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:17.200
 a real rag for the people who 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.330
 he's throwing money around 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.280
 For that I can do my profile more 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.620
 Unfortunately, I can not afford it 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.720
 above then again clear finger 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:29.650
 on it and on the side to the smaller one 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:32.050
 little finger we will continue with the 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.030
 popular bags everywhere looking for that 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:36.850
 I used this here so often 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.560
 really very sad 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:43.680
 Looks like that when I look at it 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:46.830
 not clear that we look at it 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.190
 so does it matter almost more are 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.500
 outspread 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:52.930
 I also think that way you can get in 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.460
 In the picture, who can not do that? 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.320
 I still have a normal one here 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:58.150
 din a4 big sheet of paper 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:01.390
 If I ever get it we'll get it 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.160
 so in about the broad in about 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:06.930
 the sheet of paper is not quite so 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:09.100
 narrow is a bit narrower than that 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.390
 but comes so close to the top 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.270
 display knew 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.560
 otherwise we can do that, of course 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:17.980
 Once again, nothing bends 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.150
 but makes in the yes in the comparison 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.720
 you can not do it better again 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.670
 look at 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.950
 good to say goodbye again something 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.660
 which is not really everyday object 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.970
 but for the people the collection a little 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:30.160
 after the first generation have as well 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.630
 that in direct comparison from good 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.760
 rather , I can not say 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:36.790
 I hope I could show you something 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:41.380
 how are the dimensions of the uv in march 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:44.380
 it's 163 5mm x 85 7 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.640
 this is really a rubble i wanted it 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:47.440
 showed you i hope i could 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.420
 help you tell me if you are 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.709
 bock on such a huge part I would have 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:53.670
 Thanks in any case for your time 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:53.670
 take care
