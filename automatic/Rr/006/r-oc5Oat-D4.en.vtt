okay<00:00:00.210> so<00:00:00.269> now<00:00:00.539> we<00:00:00.599> are<00:00:00.810> doing<00:00:01.020> the<00:00:01.530> nurse<00:00:01.860> of

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250 
okay so now we are doing the nurse of

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:08.150 
okay so now we are doing the nurse of
the<00:00:03.470> thoracic<00:00:05.000> limb<00:00:06.000> so<00:00:06.830> this<00:00:07.830> is<00:00:07.950> where<00:00:08.069> you

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
the thoracic limb so this is where you

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.540 
the thoracic limb so this is where you
follow<00:00:08.370> smart<00:00:08.880> mood<00:00:09.090> the<00:00:09.570> first<00:00:09.809> test<00:00:10.050> is

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:10.550 
follow smart mood the first test is

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:14.030 
follow smart mood the first test is
suprascapular<00:00:11.550> and<00:00:12.210> you<00:00:12.750> take<00:00:12.990> these<00:00:13.769> two

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
suprascapular and you take these two

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.890 
suprascapular and you take these two
branches<00:00:14.250> over<00:00:14.610> here<00:00:15.770> then<00:00:16.770> it<00:00:17.070> is

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:17.900 
branches over here then it is

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.060 
branches over here then it is
subscapular<00:00:18.900> and<00:00:19.170> it<00:00:19.590> is<00:00:19.800> this<00:00:20.359> giant<00:00:21.359> Club

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:22.070 
subscapular and it is this giant Club

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.880 
subscapular and it is this giant Club
miss<00:00:23.070> hunter<00:00:24.000> back<00:00:24.240> here<00:00:24.630> you<00:00:25.170> can<00:00:25.320> see<00:00:25.380> cuz<00:00:25.769> it

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
miss hunter back here you can see cuz it

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:46.819 
miss hunter back here you can see cuz it
doesn't<00:00:26.160> look<00:00:43.760> that<00:00:45.260> subscapular<00:00:46.260> that<00:00:46.710> we've

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
doesn't look that subscapular that we've

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.660 
doesn't look that subscapular that we've
been<00:00:46.980> talking<00:00:47.219> about<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:48.329> next<00:00:48.600> one<00:00:48.840> is

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670 
been talking about the next one is

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.299 
been talking about the next one is
musculocutaneous<00:00:51.170> which<00:00:52.170> he<00:00:52.590> innovates<00:00:53.100> the

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
musculocutaneous which he innovates the

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.520 
musculocutaneous which he innovates the
biceps<00:00:53.760> brachii<00:00:53.969> and<00:00:54.420> other<00:00:54.750> muscles<00:00:55.140> but<00:00:55.410> you

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
biceps brachii and other muscles but you

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.889 
biceps brachii and other muscles but you
can<00:00:55.710> see<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:55.980> biceps<00:00:56.340> brachii<00:00:56.550> here<00:00:57.000> and<00:00:57.300> this

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
can see the biceps brachii here and this

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:27.490 
can see the biceps brachii here and this
is<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.199> musculocutaneous<00:00:58.649> nerve

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:57.990 

and<00:01:27.760> our<00:01:29.650> that

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.800 

and<00:01:59.000> then<00:01:59.210> this<00:02:04.540> yeah

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
and then this yeah

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.730 
and then this yeah
this<00:02:06.380> is<00:02:06.500> the<00:02:06.680> median<00:02:07.580> on<00:02:07.790> the<00:02:07.910> trunk<00:02:08.240> and<00:02:08.740> then

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 
this is the median on the trunk and then

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:15.450 
this is the median on the trunk and then
it<00:02:09.920> separates<00:02:10.399> into<00:02:11.140> the<00:02:12.280> median<00:02:13.280> or<00:02:14.000> the

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:15.460 
it separates into the median or the

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:22.770 
it separates into the median or the
median<00:02:16.460> median<00:02:17.740> median<00:02:18.740> median<00:02:19.700> and<00:02:20.230> ulnar

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
median median median median and ulnar

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.230 
median median median median and ulnar
sections<00:02:23.780> of<00:02:24.020> its<00:02:24.170> own<00:02:24.380> owner<00:02:24.740> median<00:02:25.670> needed

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:26.240 
sections of its own owner median needed

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.350

on<00:02:26.390> the<00:02:26.480> trunk<00:02:26.780> you<00:02:27.100> see<00:02:28.100> the<00:02:28.310> radio<00:02:29.180> right

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
on the trunk you see the radio right

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.160 
on the trunk you see the radio right
behind<00:02:29.660> it

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
behind it

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.250 
behind it
the<00:02:30.680> musculocutaneous<00:02:31.160> on<00:02:31.790> this<00:02:31.970> side<00:02:32.260> the

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
the musculocutaneous on this side the

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.170 
the musculocutaneous on this side the
suprascapular<00:02:34.090> all<00:02:35.090> the<00:02:35.180> way<00:02:35.330> back<00:02:35.570> here

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
suprascapular all the way back here

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.110 
suprascapular all the way back here
auxilary<00:02:39.190> the<00:02:40.190> record<00:02:40.459> or<00:02:40.610> so<00:02:40.790> at<00:02:40.880> the<00:02:41.000> back

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
auxilary the record or so at the back

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.320 
auxilary the record or so at the back
and<00:02:41.510> finally<00:02:42.320> no<00:02:42.560> soup<00:02:43.070> subscapular<00:02:43.940> at<00:02:44.239> the

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
and finally no soup subscapular at the

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.020 
and finally no soup subscapular at the
back<00:02:44.480> and<00:02:44.800> sorry<00:02:45.800> the<00:02:46.160> record<00:02:46.489> or<00:02:46.610> so

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
back and sorry the record or so

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.240 
back and sorry the record or so
is<00:02:47.270> the<00:02:47.959> one<00:02:48.110> that<00:02:48.260> does<00:02:48.470> an<00:02:48.830> arrestee

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
is the one that does an arrestee

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.490 
is the one that does an arrestee
latissimus<00:02:49.730> dorsi<00:02:50.080> it's<00:02:51.080> this<00:02:51.290> one<00:02:51.470> here

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
latissimus dorsi it's this one here

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.199 
latissimus dorsi it's this one here
that's<00:02:51.680> broken<00:02:51.980> off<00:02:52.220> we<00:02:52.700> go<00:02:52.970> out<00:02:53.030> the<00:02:53.180> back

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
that's broken off we go out the back

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:58.510 
that's broken off we go out the back
like<00:02:53.739> so<00:02:55.510> anything
