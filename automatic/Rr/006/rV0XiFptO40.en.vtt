00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:38.250 
listen this could be another kind of
vibrato<00:01:31.800> like<00:01:32.220> classic<00:01:32.909> Oh

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:38.260 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:46.110 

in<00:01:39.260> between<00:01:39.640> this<00:01:40.640> is<00:01:40.970> typical<00:01:41.600> rock<00:01:44.050> very

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:46.120 
in between this is typical rock very

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:53.580 
in between this is typical rock very
deep<00:01:47.120> or<00:01:48.640> a<00:01:50.170> little<00:01:51.170> bit<00:01:51.380> of

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:02:00.890 

changing<00:01:54.590> the<00:01:54.679> page<00:01:56.770> no<00:01:57.880> and<00:01:59.049> changing

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:00.900 
changing the page no and changing

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.640 
changing the page no and changing
the<00:02:01.470> modulation

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:03.650 
the modulation

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:08.170 
the modulation
is<00:02:04.130> more<00:02:04.430> fun<00:02:05.980> so<00:02:06.980> in<00:02:07.160> the<00:02:07.430> second<00:02:07.850> step<00:02:08.119> to

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:08.180 
is more fun so in the second step to

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:11.380 
is more fun so in the second step to
build<00:02:08.690> a<00:02:08.869> a<00:02:09.080> good<00:02:09.590> melodic<00:02:10.130> line<00:02:10.369> is<00:02:10.640> thinking

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
build a a good melodic line is thinking

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.040 
build a a good melodic line is thinking

d<00:03:17.350> for<00:03:18.350> the<00:03:18.530> d<00:03:18.680> major<00:03:19.060> so<00:03:20.060> i<00:03:21.220> can<00:03:22.220> use<00:03:23.150> a<00:03:23.180> line

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 
d for the d major so i can use a line

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.160 
d for the d major so i can use a line
very<00:03:24.290> easy<00:03:24.709> line<00:03:25.010> to<00:03:25.370> connect<00:03:25.820> those<00:03:26.660> chords

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
very easy line to connect those chords

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.860 
very easy line to connect those chords
so<00:03:27.890> let<00:03:28.100> me<00:03:28.220> demonstrate<00:03:28.430> a<00:03:29.030> plane<00:03:29.390> over<00:03:29.630> a

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
so let me demonstrate a plane over a

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:47.960 
so let me demonstrate a plane over a
backing<00:03:30.290> track<00:03:36.190> g

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:53.339 

before<00:03:48.780> work

00:03:53.339 --> 00:03:53.349 

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:59.880 

the<00:03:53.799> rule<00:03:54.930> the<00:03:55.930> fifth<00:03:56.230> and<00:03:56.730> the<00:03:57.730> rules

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 
the rule the fifth and the rules

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
the rule the fifth and the rules
or<00:04:01.140> he

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
or he

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.210 
or he
rude<00:04:03.510> the<00:04:04.050> third

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
rude the third

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:11.330 
rude the third
George<00:04:06.970> Eugene<00:04:07.470> is<00:04:08.470> the<00:04:08.740> rule

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:23.520 

and<00:04:11.670> the<00:04:11.940> fit<00:04:12.209> so

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:05:53.520 

just<00:04:24.250> dead<00:04:24.720> quiet

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:53.530 

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:58.000 

so<00:05:54.530> the<00:05:54.980> same<00:05:55.280> thing<00:05:55.640> that<00:05:56.210> we<00:05:56.540> did<00:05:57.010> connecting

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:58.010 
so the same thing that we did connecting

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:01.080 
so the same thing that we did connecting
the<00:05:58.160> courts<00:05:58.730> with<00:05:59.090> the<00:05:59.120> common<00:05:59.690> note<00:05:59.930> I<00:06:00.290> did

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:01.090 
the courts with the common note I did

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:04.450 
the courts with the common note I did
playing<00:06:02.090> a<00:06:02.240> solo<00:06:02.510> so<00:06:03.230> when<00:06:03.470> we<00:06:03.980> are<00:06:04.010> range

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:04.460 
playing a solo so when we are range

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:08.680 
playing a solo so when we are range
apart<00:06:05.120> plane<00:06:06.080> an<00:06:06.230> arpeggio<00:06:06.890> or<00:06:07.250> a<00:06:07.660> delay<00:06:08.660> a

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:08.690 
apart plane an arpeggio or a delay a

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:13.210 
apart plane an arpeggio or a delay a
part<00:06:09.110> could<00:06:10.070> be<00:06:10.250> used<00:06:10.580> the<00:06:11.030> same<00:06:11.390> trick<00:06:12.220> to

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:13.220 
part could be used the same trick to

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:16.330 
part could be used the same trick to
build<00:06:13.460> a<00:06:13.610> solo<00:06:13.880> but<00:06:14.420> remember<00:06:14.930> that<00:06:15.140> all<00:06:15.830> the

solo the main sole of the most famous

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:22.690 
solo the main sole of the most famous
solo<00:06:19.370> are<00:06:19.760> based<00:06:20.180> on<00:06:20.570> a<00:06:20.630> target<00:06:21.350> note<00:06:21.590> that<00:06:22.400> are

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:22.700 
solo are based on a target note that are

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:26.020 
solo are based on a target note that are
in<00:06:23.270> the<00:06:23.840> Triad<00:06:24.200> so<00:06:25.100> you<00:06:25.190> have<00:06:25.400> to<00:06:25.610> pay

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:26.030 
in the Triad so you have to pay

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:28.990 
in the Triad so you have to pay
attention<00:06:26.420> to<00:06:26.900> think<00:06:27.650> about<00:06:27.920> the<00:06:28.250> Triad<00:06:28.640> notes

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:29.000 
attention to think about the Triad notes

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.630 
attention to think about the Triad notes
using<00:06:29.450> obviously<00:06:29.930> your<00:06:30.530> ear<00:06:30.890> but<00:06:31.310> you<00:06:31.490> have

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:31.640 
using obviously your ear but you have

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:34.840 
using obviously your ear but you have
also<00:06:31.880> to<00:06:32.090> spell<00:06:32.870> out<00:06:33.080> the<00:06:33.470> chord<00:06:34.190> notes<00:06:34.520> and

also to spell out the chord notes and

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:38.290 
also to spell out the chord notes and
find<00:06:35.630> the<00:06:36.560> interval<00:06:37.130> that<00:06:37.160> works<00:06:37.640> good<00:06:38.060> on

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:38.300 
find the interval that works good on

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:40.960 
find the interval that works good on
that<00:06:38.440> for<00:06:39.440> playing<00:06:39.680> a<00:06:39.800> good<00:06:39.950> solo<00:06:40.280> that<00:06:40.580> is<00:06:40.730> not
