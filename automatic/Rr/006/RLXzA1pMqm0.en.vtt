 After a month of being in Ecuador , 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:28.570

 intense of much learning and cute 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.680
 I remember how I try, I think the 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:41.829
 people have already caught me enough and I feel 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.690
 very happy because the idea was this one was going 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:45.159
 with a goal that was this to earn me the 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.989
 this Ecuadorian public in the 

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:48.489
 hearts of them that was in first 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:50.680
 instance equal way to play true and 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:51.969
 behind that came to jane the band of 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.290
 leaders told you that a little bit difficult 

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:54.850
 because I was just getting to know the games 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:56.379
 but thank god the same 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.000
 comrades helped me a lot 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:59.739
 I coupled the games well-known and 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.199
 then among all as taking out the 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:04.150
 team forward and there it is like 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:05.500
 we started winning victories and that's the 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.990
 idea to win the public that soriano and 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.460
 that people would be happy to leave 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.049

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.390

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:15.670

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.350
 as I say it's four days but good 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.840

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.040

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:26.380
