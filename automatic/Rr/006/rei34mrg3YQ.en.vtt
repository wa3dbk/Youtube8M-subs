00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
which is going to protect against drops

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.430 
which is going to protect against drops
and<00:00:14.759> shocks<00:00:15.000> pretty<00:00:15.330> well<00:00:15.540> and<00:00:15.809> then<00:00:16.260> this

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
and shocks pretty well and then this

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.320 
and shocks pretty well and then this
part<00:00:16.920> of<00:00:17.039> the<00:00:17.100> case<00:00:17.310> is<00:00:17.340> actually<00:00:18.029> a

after you've put the iphone into this
portion<00:00:23.580> of<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:23.730> case<00:00:24.000> so<00:00:24.300> let's<00:00:24.840> go<00:00:24.930> ahead

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
portion of the case so let's go ahead

i'll say if you've got a screen shield
or<00:00:28.949> a<00:00:28.980> back<00:00:29.220> shield<00:00:29.550> on<00:00:29.730> your<00:00:29.849> iphone<00:00:30.179> 5<00:00:30.480> it

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
should work however if you're using a

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.569 
should work however if you're using a
thicker<00:00:33.719> one<00:00:33.989> maybe<00:00:34.260> one<00:00:34.500> of<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.680> glass<00:00:34.950> style

may or may not work you can see how i'm
going<00:00:40.469> to<00:00:40.559> simply<00:00:41.010> align<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.969> shell<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:42.510> then

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
going to simply align the shell and then

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.630 
going to simply align the shell and then
just<00:00:43.290> kind<00:00:43.410> of<00:00:43.530> push<00:00:43.739> it<00:00:43.890> into<00:00:44.040> place<00:00:44.129> and

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
just kind of push it into place and

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.819 
just kind of push it into place and
that's<00:00:44.789> all<00:00:44.969> there<00:00:45.090> is<00:00:45.149> to<00:00:45.510> it<00:00:45.649> you're<00:00:46.649> going

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
that's all there is to it you're going

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.799 
that's all there is to it you're going
to<00:00:46.890> notice<00:00:47.039> that<00:00:47.370> on<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.579> front<00:00:47.879> of<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.480> phone

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
to notice that on the front of the phone

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.270 
to notice that on the front of the phone
there<00:00:49.200> is<00:00:49.350> a<00:00:49.379> bit<00:00:49.770> of<00:00:49.800> lay<00:00:50.039> on<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.250> table

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
there is a bit of lay on the table

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.420 
there is a bit of lay on the table
design<00:00:50.940> so<00:00:51.149> we<00:00:51.180> do<00:00:51.390> get<00:00:51.570> that<00:00:51.750> with<00:00:51.930> this<00:00:52.110> case

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
design so we do get that with this case

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.819 
design so we do get that with this case
otherwise<00:00:53.430> everything<00:00:53.760> else<00:00:54.030> is<00:00:54.300> exposed

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.560 
doesn't always want to stay in place I
kind<00:02:24.590> of<00:02:24.620> push<00:02:24.830> it<00:02:24.980> in<00:02:25.100> there<00:02:25.280> and<00:02:25.540> after<00:02:26.540> a

while of using it it seems to pop out on
its<00:02:28.880> own<00:02:29.210> so<00:02:29.270> I<00:02:29.540> would<00:02:29.720> have<00:02:29.810> liked<00:02:29.990> to<00:02:30.170> have

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
its own so I would have liked to have

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.520 
its own so I would have liked to have
seen<00:02:30.470> that<00:02:30.530> be<00:02:30.860> a<00:02:30.890> little<00:02:31.340> bit<00:02:31.520> more<00:02:31.670> secure

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
seen that be a little bit more secure

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.100 
seen that be a little bit more secure
but<00:02:33.530> it's<00:02:33.650> nothing<00:02:33.830> too<00:02:34.160> major<00:02:34.340> this<00:02:35.180> style<00:02:35.780> at

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
but it's nothing too major this style at

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.199 
but it's nothing too major this style at
least<00:02:36.290> in<00:02:36.470> this<00:02:36.620> color<00:02:36.860> of<00:02:37.130> black<00:02:37.370> is<00:02:37.700> going<00:02:38.060> to

least in this color of black is going to

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:40.570 
least in this color of black is going to
attract<00:02:38.630> some<00:02:38.990> fingerprinting<00:02:39.890> although<00:02:40.459> it

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
attract some fingerprinting although it

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.000 
attract some fingerprinting although it

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
does wipe off pretty easily and there is

kickstand so you're just going to

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.050 
kickstand so you're just going to
basically<00:02:59.420> open<00:03:00.230> it<00:03:00.350> up<00:03:00.440> like<00:03:00.620> that<00:03:00.970> and<00:03:01.970> you

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.620 
basically work a couple of edges here
and<00:03:13.220> then<00:03:13.580> just<00:03:13.820> give<00:03:13.970> it<00:03:14.030> a<00:03:14.090> bit<00:03:14.239> of<00:03:14.270> a<00:03:14.390> push

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630 
and then just give it a bit of a push

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.890 
and then just give it a bit of a push
and<00:03:14.870> out<00:03:15.110> it<00:03:15.260> comes<00:03:15.290> so<00:03:15.830> this<00:03:16.640> is<00:03:16.880> the<00:03:17.209> legacy

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
more secure in its place and then as I

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.479 
more secure in its place and then as I
mentioned<00:03:29.630> down<00:03:29.810> here<00:03:30.049> at<00:03:30.110> the<00:03:30.200> bottom<00:03:30.489> it's

going<00:03:31.730> to<00:03:31.760> be<00:03:31.910> a<00:03:31.940> bit<00:03:32.209> of<00:03:32.239> a<00:03:32.390> tight<00:03:32.630> fit<00:03:32.930> based

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
going to be a bit of a tight fit based

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.350 
going to be a bit of a tight fit based
on<00:03:33.440> what<00:03:33.650> you're<00:03:33.860> using<00:03:33.890> but<00:03:34.730> other<00:03:35.000> than<00:03:35.299> that

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
I like what they've done it adds a

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.250 
I like what they've done it adds a
little<00:03:37.190> bit<00:03:37.340> of<00:03:37.430> bulk<00:03:37.730> not<00:03:38.510> too<00:03:38.780> much<00:03:38.930> weight

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260
