00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:11.849
 summer cream cheese cake with 40 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.769
 prepared a lot of fun while 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:17.520
 imitate 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:18.750

 I then put 125 grams of butter in the 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:01:00.360
 microwave for about a minute 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:01:01.140
 cause the pain so well so that 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:13.340

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:19.340
 or cheese and a like 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:51.310
 the whole thing is supposed to mix the beauty 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:54.220
 and all the butter and if the 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:02:00.250
 butter cookies are then sticky at the same time 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:05.590
 then the whole thing fits the times 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:18.780
 springform and there I go now 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:18.780
