 exceptionality confirmed his books 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:15.030
 The days that you do this 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.220

 they go down very ye then you get that 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.350
 novelty 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.230
 all these the accident was important 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.570
 to make great movies more with 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.520
 complexity is no doubt 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.890
 to form and climate is also 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.870
 very hot in the summer we talk about 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.059
 lasted 69 months of winter 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.910
 three months of hell is to ask the 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.500
 freedom of the media dirty August and 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.190
 September has not're not far 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:02.430
 hot or caloric and as we do not 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.390
 we connect the water to the streets 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.000
 for the lines 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.909
 they are forced to go too deep for 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.189
 get water and it's down there in the basement 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.080
 deep down there are old vineyards that come down 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.270
 up to 20 meters 1 million meters of 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.130
 barriers you get rid of this 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.080
 show age have a vineyard 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.030
 older lines between the 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.299
 bridge and Maria Teresa surveys that are 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:28.530

 of this is five and a half hectares 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.990
 total area and we make a maximum of eight 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.630
 one thousand bottles 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.880

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.070
 They call it a garage but it's not the 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.760
 supra-sumo I tasted this wine at 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.850
 sometimes it is not 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.630
 It's not, it's not, it 's not because it came out of

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:12.990
 of the total volume of port wine 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:14.940
