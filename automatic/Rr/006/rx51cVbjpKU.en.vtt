so<00:02:38.830> no<00:02:39.010> tailing<00:02:39.340> redfish<00:02:39.700> on<00:02:39.910> these<00:02:40.060> flats<00:02:40.330> are

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
so no tailing redfish on these flats are

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.850 
so no tailing redfish on these flats are
pretty<00:02:42.430> featureless<00:02:43.200> but<00:02:44.200> yeah<00:02:44.650> there's

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
pretty featureless but yeah there's

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.920 
pretty featureless but yeah there's
three<00:02:45.040> species<00:02:45.520> and<00:02:45.760> they're<00:02:46.390> all<00:02:46.540> cool<00:02:46.750> to

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
three species and they're all cool to

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.510 
three species and they're all cool to
target<00:02:47.290> and<00:02:47.590> they<00:02:48.040> all<00:02:48.160> have<00:02:48.340> their<00:02:48.459> own

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.520 
target and they all have their own

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.790 
target and they all have their own
little<00:02:48.760> intricacies<00:02:49.360> and<00:02:49.390> ways<00:02:49.690> to<00:02:49.989> target

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800 
little intricacies and ways to target

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.130 
little intricacies and ways to target
them<00:02:50.890> so<00:02:51.070> it's<00:02:51.220> a<00:02:51.450> it's<00:02:52.450> kind<00:02:52.690> of<00:02:52.720> a<00:02:52.810> diverse
