00:00:00.379 --> 00:00:03.959
 should be in connection with us 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.709
 angel forge 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:10.650
 here it is, angel well as it is 

00:00:07.709 --> 00:00:14.880
 vincenzo pay good evening leo ciccarelli 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:18.449
 then very serious banner also the 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.400
 signor gianni morandi finally it is 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.490
 indignant I am happy though 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.400
 our mimmo said no to racism part 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:30.089
 also by the northern press 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:33.870
 that maybe they do a kind of information 

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:36.330
 very precise on some things I am not there but 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.040
 it is not true it is not true that I enjoy myself there 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.850
 I want to believe I do n't hope it's not 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.650
 so 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.590
 mimmo is always right about the fact that 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:45.420
 we said racism exists and it is 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.720
 a racism in this case I say 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:52.620
 still territorial and against Naples, not 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:56.880
 only against the south against naples then 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:59.010
 go to his talk of televisions 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.290
 of the north that there is a media power 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.810
 in the north this is little but city ​​but then 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:05.100
 I climbed but he also knows how to do it 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.590
 I'm in that sense 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.780
 surely there is information 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.460
 tendentious that certainly aims at 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.740
 retain a certain type of power 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.049
 compared to certain teams than in the 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.270
 football history have always had in 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.520
 so unfortunately we in Naples do not 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.380
 we have a national broadcaster and therefore 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.259
 we can't control 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.789
 in this respect therefore it seems to me a 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.429
 very simple way to dissolve in 

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:32.340
 this makes sense here what you can 

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:35.009
 simply emphasize that there is a 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.969
 sort of name of the recrudescence of 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.979
 these phenomena although it continues to 

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:43.020
 fear this desire to stop the 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.729
 phenomenon the phenomenon does not stop indeed 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.889
 increases more and more you have to understand the 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.659
 because it is not knowing how to make a company 

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:51.630
 civil in short I believe that what 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.999
 we said you remember one even 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.130
 in the billions of the championship therefore 

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:58.079
 we are talking about thirty years 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.969
 does bologna fans had good 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.520
 opportunity had been a twinning 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.899
 angel I don't know if you knew it before there was 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.630
 twinning then develops his own 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.610
 twinning at that time 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:11.159
 because the fans of the bologna nava 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.990
 incited the Milan fans for a non 

00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:14.550
 I know what it is 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.410
 the fans of Naples, however, the 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.450
 twinning however this story because 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.810
 remember I remember there were some dinners 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.490
 a bit particular but in any case the 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:27.150
 soccer unfortunately has become something of 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:28.980
 what uncontrollable uncontrollable 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.110
 sorry that i say this with 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:34.380
 really reluctantly to a monitor ad 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.690
 today, regional news from Emilia Romagna 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.420
 after day region of Emilia Romagna 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.460
 and no mention was made of this 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.970
 so that's what bothers 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:46.380
 the fact that the fans in the mass 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.520
 they actually assume certain attitudes 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.230
 indecent 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.600
 what is sorry is that who has the 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:54.570
 duty to report to underline that 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.980
 things unfortunately also those areas 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:59.130
 they will tie in a certain direction 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:01.350
 this also happened a 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.480
 torino we have seen the famous one that is 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:05.430
 calling who came out of the news 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.830
 regional for them would not have 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:10.380
 definitely pulled out if it wasn't there 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.120
 was someone who will then be reported 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.520
 in short, things happened at the time 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.290
 but I believe that this is what goes 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:19.590
 emphasized that is that in Emilia Romagna 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:22.380
 today in the regional news and in any case not me 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.990
 it seems there has also been great relevance 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:29.040
 in the national news of this thing to lose 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:30.640
 the guide memory is one thing that does not 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:36.310
 they want them 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:37.930
 it is their yes it was a way it was 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.400
 look at this tolla sing in 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.380
 Neapolitan but you can't 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.760
 in short, take Russian from the stuff 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.500
 ours then whistled to the judges 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.320
 Neapolitans who used to sing from the 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:50.320
 in short it was this way and withholding 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.760
 I mean a symbol and therefore and therefore 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.380
 so much is true of this thing but that 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.230
 banner will be a pleasure when the 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.160
 vesuvio will really do the duty 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.530
 indecent in short therefore means that 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.989
 there are also popular ones in bologna 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:04.660
 I mean racism unfortunately has run 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:06.820
 talked so year in a way plus theme 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:09.970
 made common against san gennaro io 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:11.380
 simple memory February 2009 napoli lo 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:14.350
 Fate San Paolo was the only stadium 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:16.660
 who recalled the memory of Giacomo 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:18.459
 bulgarelli no stage I remember 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:22.120
 in Naples on the commemoration of 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:24.280
 reaching the midfield follow the eight 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.169
 so in midfield, then at least from 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:28.390
 point of view of the sports society 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:30.070
 soccer naples there was a memory for here 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:32.169
 the symbols of Bologna 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:34.960
 evidently nobody remembers me 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:37.090
 I don't even remember the spring run 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.100
 there was the match against racism 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:42.040
 against all racism Italy san 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:44.470
 marine and during that game in which 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:46.660
 speaks all of Italy there was Poland 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.340
 they shouted we are not Neapolitans who a 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.840
 bologna was not there at that time 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.540
 say two Neapolitans are not Italian 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:55.020
 in short it seems to me to be emphasized 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:56.710
 and remembered because unfortunately sorry 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:58.960
 in short, emphasize it again 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:03.520
 bologna and the Bolognese press do not 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:05.290
 they are making a good impression on 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.090
 president of bologna in the first instance 

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:09.880
 he had admitted he hadn't heard those 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:11.950
 then later he corrected the tfr not 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.720
 ports go saying that it was a shame 

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:15.820
 etc. I liked the words of 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:18.039
 ballardini for example from the retina is 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:20.860
 returned to the subject in the press room 

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:23.289
 But in short angel I say this guy 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:25.729
 the problem I think we could have 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:28.099
 talk endlessly 

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:30.620
 if you never find a solution if 

00:05:28.099 --> 00:05:32.680
 not if the institutions won't 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:34.189
 those who are responsible for doing so 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:37.839
 absolutely 

00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:41.659
 unfortunately no one here is without sin and 

00:05:37.839 --> 00:05:44.559
 so good is only the phenomenon 

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:47.870
 in itself that unfortunately with these 

00:05:44.559 --> 00:05:49.550
 features these generalities of the 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:52.249
 unfortunately, in my opinion, the national press 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:54.020
 it can't be absolutely ok soon 

00:05:52.249 --> 00:05:56.569
 angel I thank you for yours 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:59.539
 intervention we definitely feel in 

00:05:56.569 --> 00:06:02.770
 coming days thanks thanks then one 

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:02.770
 track to bye bye thanks
