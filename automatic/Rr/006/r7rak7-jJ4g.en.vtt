00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:08.040
 hello everyone is steven and today 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.530
 I present you a new cydia tweak 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.660
 which is called beacon hill will you 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.460
 allow two things firstly just 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.870
 after a start or 1st premium you 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.369
 are going to have the animation of the apple 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.980
 suck as in the first 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.600
 configuration of a bone 6 and then you 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.010
 have seen that just after the animation of 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.869
 the apple you have another animation 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.849
 is this one you'll be able to 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.250
 choose here in tweak settings 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.439
 you have the choice of animations there 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.420
 is seven months for this first example 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.500
 I will choose the last one and I will 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.149
 so every time I go 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.790
 start my iphone or so at each 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.649
 once I'm going to do a res pring in 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.140
 first the apple comes alive and then 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.730
 just after hop a second effect and 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.829
 this time you saw that the screen has 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.059
 did a trick on himself even had been done 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.230
 that they are called pinball that I have 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.039
 selected earlier in the 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.289
 tweak settings 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.600
 so that's how it works I had 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.980
 chose the flip facts that starts from the bottom i 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.660
 can you show another flip 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.129
 brothers wright so this time you 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.170
 see that it's going to be a little dizzy 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.850
 but from the right the palm 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.830
 come alive then that's what it does 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.000
 so for the operation it's not 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.799
 more complicated than that you can 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.360
 choose among this effect that are 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.810
 available in tweak settings 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.130
 just right here the flip from light effect 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.990
 that I just showed you at the moment 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.439
 so does a flip from the 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.659
 right 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.090
 this one left it's from the 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.189
 left then you have effects of 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.299
 leaves that folds up from the top 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.430
 it's the first one I showed you 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.860
 in the video in two that will leave the 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.229
 no and finally flip from bottom and flip 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.770
 from top to bottom and top to 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.380
 the fip 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.670
 finally the last effect it is called di 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.780
 sole and I will immediately 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.799
 show how they look like you 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.320
 see that it's an effect 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.450
 simple the apple comes alive and then 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:46.049
 the screen gradually appears 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.939
 just on ipad it works 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.860
 exactly the same way you have 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.509
 the beacon section in the settings in 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.280
 which you select your effect 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.229
 month you can see that I chose 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.270
 who thus orders the leaf that folds 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.920
 and that I will have at every start or 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.440
 every race pring on my ipad 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:05.180
 little test and that's what it does 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.650
 this tweak so called beacon you 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.240
 can find it on the cydia store 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.490
 on the source of big boss 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.990
 it costs a dollar and it is compatible 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:15.110
 with ios 5 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:17.300
 6 Hats for iphone ipod touch and ipad 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.070
 so that's really a good little 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.350
 tweak if you like animations 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:23.120
 this one brings you apple 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.740
 suck up after a reboot or a 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.770
 mind and then the little animation 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:29.180
 that you select in the settings 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:30.740

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.300
