 we made through let's choose player 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.880
 so that to change is the player 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.220

 to our forward peralta that yes 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.600
 you press the right button 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.850
 the right joystick inwards you go to 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.610
 can see all the attributes that it has 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.070
 even pressing the dvd you are going to arrive 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.460
 until this page where you come how many 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.740
 stars has watermarks vale has 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.019
 three ok that's what this is about 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:06.479
 time of three so now we do 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.130
 we go to the training camp and good 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.409
 let's do the first of the dribbles 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.560
 which is the little heel touch is worth 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:16.560
 touch of heel that is achieved by doing 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.149
 with the just and right two touches worth the 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.720
 first up and the second one 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:21.270
 down 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.850
 it is quickly worth the acys very fast 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.560
 up down down up you can see 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.750
 in command also as I show you how 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.540
 how it is done and well, you have already 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.520
 know that it is a very easy dribble 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:36.150
 do because you look up without 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:39.710
 more and very effective is very very effective 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:42.480
 this is one of the dribbles I would say 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:45.360
 favorite ones is worth doing because 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:47.070
 It is very simple and very effective more 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.460
 I repeat a lot of times but I want 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.320
 emphasize the good thing also say that this 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.090
 dribble like all the others is worth 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.000
 It will depend on the position you are in 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.890
 the field for example if you are attacking 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.270
 to the right would be right left 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.280
 and if even crisis to the left would be 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.520
 left to right is good 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.619
 next dribble is the give a touch 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.350
 upwards it goes for it we go to 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:12.000
 give three times to the right joystick in 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.860
 the direction the player is going 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.959
 worth in this case for example it would be three 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.180
 quick right touches worth 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:21.000
 three quick touches in this case would be 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.220
 a little oblique, it's good and you see that 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.750
 He lifts the ball and is effective for 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.050
 example make that volley that you have just 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.660
 watch 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.120
 or for example and if you want to flip a 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.060
 bit 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.549
 you can lift the ball you see how 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.799
 we raise the ball and well I'm going to 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:39.260
 show below that I do not know what 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:41.060
 enjoy a little bit already this already 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.370
 I did in fifa 3 and if even a contest 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.590
 to see who was able to score a goal 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.450
 in this way it's good for the moment you see 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.700
 the volley is worth serving to lift the 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:52.760
 ball to make a volley or to avoid 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:55.670
 a rival xerrada fixed this is a 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.560
 what I mean, you raise laws 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.650
 three times to the Christ upwards 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.450
 from this clear position then you give him 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.930
 to the joystick back and then 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:09.560
 you press lte and thiráis is worth there l thiráis 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:12.109
 good vale is one of those things 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.359
 wonderful of this game 

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:15.920
 it's a bit flippant and it's very difficult to 

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:17.750
 make a good but good when 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.069
 You get it because you say that ball 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.129
 submitted 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:24.650
 well the roulette and you are already watching is not 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:26.659
 try to alias tick right give it half 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.700
 Return to joystick is worth depending for 

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:30.230
 which side you want to leave but always 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.019
 starting from below until arriving 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.640
 up is worth it if you want to do it for the 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:36.950
 right then 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.990
 that's this is the link below going 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.180
 from the right to the top if 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:43.069
 you want to do on the left throw the 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.800
 christie from below going through the 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:47.810
 left and up the roulette that 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:50.569
 this is the zidane roulette is worth more 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.370
 known like this is very effective 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:54.320
 It is also valid and you can go from several 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:57.690
 rivals doing this not from one even 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:59.640
 of more than one with that dribble 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:01.920
 the next thing we're going to do is turn off 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:05.010
 and going out a hoax and going out is akin to 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:07.860
 the roulette but in the opposite direction 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:11.450
 can start from below we go to 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:14.300
 start from the side that we want 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:15.620
 make the feint not to the side 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:18.440
 opposite of we want out 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:20.780
 valència let's start for example from 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:23.060
 left to right but always happening 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:26.060
 below to exit on the right and from 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:28.700
 right to left passing below 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:30.020
 of course to exit on the left 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:31.850
 there we are going out on the right 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.740
 now let's go out on the left we're going 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:35.600
 to go back out on the left and 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.340
 good for completion also well 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:40.900
 see, we do not go to the left and 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.900
 we miss a little the goalkeeper 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:48.440
 and well, this is what has been 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:51.600
 the dribbles of three filigree stars 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:53.669
 I'm sorry if he leaves me one if he leaves me something 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:56.340
 will be some nonsense worth some 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:58.770
 some yellow some history like that I 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:00.240
 I think that's how it's all said as 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:02.760
 you always know now I'm going to leave you 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:05.340
 some examples some goals some stories 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:07.139
 It's worth to see the little things that 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:09.090
 you can do with these dribbles of three 

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:10.500
 stars remember three stars already 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:12.630
 we will reach those of five not 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:14.550
 worry calm vale life 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:16.919
 favorites if you liked it you already know 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:19.979
 as always leave you can leave your 

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:21.600
 Comment if you have any questions and nothing 

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:25.820
 more kids see you in the next 

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.820
 video a salute and goodbye goodbye 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:34.190
 here it is 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.190
 i 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:42.169
 I have to overcome that above this 

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:43.880
 He faced the rivalry you'll never see 

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:46.639
 losing the falling is not only mine 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:49.340
 assimilates the radical maneuver life carries 

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:51.949
 the signature of the legitimate so I do so 

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:54.110
 I live and here I am still the one with 

00:05:51.949 --> 00:05:56.599
 much more definable mind mini style 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:59.569
 they are deadly in the micro I am the same and 

00:05:56.599 --> 00:06:01.400
 I am the aggressive one if you believe in God I 

00:05:59.569 --> 00:06:03.229
 I am the antichrist if you look like the 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:05.479
 better software than the illusion was made if 

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:07.880
 I see at the top of the podium low 

00:06:05.479 --> 00:06:08.750
 Asphalt is set to return 

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:11.389
 powder 

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:13.310
 get ready let's go to the offensive with rhymes 

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:16.190

 without flight the competition is served and 

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:20.360
