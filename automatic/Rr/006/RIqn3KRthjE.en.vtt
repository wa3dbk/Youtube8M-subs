very quickly each of you are we going to

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.440 
very quickly each of you are we going to
see<00:01:46.860> really<00:01:47.280> an<00:01:47.399> explosion<00:01:48.030> in<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.240> gold

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
see really an explosion in the gold

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:49.940

above<00:03:07.630> 500<00:03:08.620> briefly<00:03:09.540> bakit<00:03:10.540> I<00:03:10.690> guess<00:03:10.960> the

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
above 500 briefly bakit I guess the

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.260 
above 500 briefly bakit I guess the
beginning<00:03:11.440> of<00:03:11.590> January<00:03:12.490> and<00:03:12.700> it's<00:03:12.820> back<00:03:13.030> down

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:13.270 
beginning of January and it's back down

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:17.210 
beginning of January and it's back down
to<00:03:13.480> a<00:03:13.740> 450<00:03:14.740> today<00:03:15.040> that<00:03:15.790> moved<00:03:16.090> to<00:03:16.270> 500<00:03:16.870> was

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
to a 450 today that moved to 500 was

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.650 
to a 450 today that moved to 500 was
reflecting<00:03:18.220> the<00:03:18.460> gold<00:03:18.790> price<00:03:19.060> getting<00:03:19.360> up<00:03:19.540> to

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
reflecting the gold price getting up to

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.200 
reflecting the gold price getting up to
$1200<00:03:20.500> I<00:03:20.590> think<00:03:20.830> the<00:03:21.010> the<00:03:21.370> shares<00:03:21.670> have<00:03:21.940> moved

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:22.210 
$1200 I think the the shares have moved

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:24.660 
$1200 I think the the shares have moved
with<00:03:22.480> the<00:03:22.570> gold<00:03:22.750> price<00:03:23.020> and<00:03:23.800> they<00:03:23.980> they<00:03:24.490> will

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
with the gold price and they they will

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.300 
with the gold price and they they will
move<00:03:24.850> with<00:03:25.210> the<00:03:25.570> gold<00:03:25.870> price<00:03:26.170> when<00:03:26.680> the<00:03:26.920> market

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
move with the gold price when the market

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.060 
move with the gold price when the market
is<00:03:27.810> convinced<00:03:28.810> that<00:03:28.900> gold<00:03:29.350> is<00:03:29.560> going<00:03:29.800> to<00:03:29.890> stay

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
is convinced that gold is going to stay

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.220 
is convinced that gold is going to stay
up<00:03:30.100> at<00:03:30.430> that<00:03:30.610> that<00:03:31.270> level<00:03:31.510> that<00:03:31.660> there<00:03:31.960> are<00:03:32.080> new

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:43.260 
gold to fill all the paper contracts you
know<00:03:42.310> the<00:03:42.400> question<00:03:42.790> of<00:03:42.880> course<00:03:43.060> with

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:43.270 
know the question of course with

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:45.720 
know the question of course with
everything<00:03:43.660> and<00:03:44.140> this<00:03:44.290> too<00:03:44.530> is<00:03:44.709> is<00:03:45.160> timing<00:03:45.459> and

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
everything and this too is is timing and

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.330 
everything and this too is is timing and
on<00:03:46.360> the<00:03:46.480> other<00:03:46.570> hand<00:03:46.870> I<00:03:46.990> do<00:03:47.050> suspect<00:03:47.590> that

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
on the other hand I do suspect that

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.310 
on the other hand I do suspect that
central<00:03:49.330> banks<00:03:49.600> are<00:03:49.720> going<00:03:49.840> to<00:03:49.900> want<00:03:50.110> some

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:50.320 
central banks are going to want some

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:51.870 
central banks are going to want some
inflation<00:03:50.680> you<00:03:51.160> know<00:03:51.280> I<00:03:51.310> think<00:03:51.490> they're<00:03:51.730> more

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:51.880 
inflation you know I think they're more

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.340 
inflation you know I think they're more
scared<00:03:52.000> of<00:03:52.300> deflation<00:03:52.690> than<00:03:53.050> inflation

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:53.350 
scared of deflation than inflation

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:56.130 
scared of deflation than inflation
central<00:03:53.980> banks<00:03:54.220> are<00:03:54.340> created<00:03:54.820> to<00:03:54.930> inflate<00:03:55.930> and

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:56.140 
central banks are created to inflate and

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.710 
central banks are created to inflate and
debase<00:03:56.410> currencies<00:03:57.010> and<00:03:57.390> they<00:03:58.390> can<00:03:58.570> do<00:03:58.690> it

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
debase currencies and they can do it

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.020 
debase currencies and they can do it
just<00:03:58.870> by<00:03:59.290> you<00:04:00.130> know<00:04:00.160> getting<00:04:00.550> off<00:04:00.700> the<00:04:00.850> gold

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
just by you know getting off the gold

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.020 
just by you know getting off the gold
price<00:04:01.300> so<00:04:01.600> I<00:04:01.630> don't<00:04:02.080> think<00:04:02.320> central<00:04:02.680> banks

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
price so I don't think central banks

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.170 
price so I don't think central banks
particularly<00:04:04.030> the<00:04:04.810> European<00:04:05.200> Central<00:04:05.500> Bank's

and the Chinese and other Asian central

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.040 
and the Chinese and other Asian central
banks<00:04:09.640> are<00:04:09.760> necessarily<00:04:10.270> the<00:04:10.570> enemies<00:04:10.900> of
