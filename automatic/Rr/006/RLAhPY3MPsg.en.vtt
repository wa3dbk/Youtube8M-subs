00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:07.770
 hello dear viewers will be here today 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.590
 my look at particularly favorable 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.540
 graphics cards under 100 euro we have 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.820
 ever built a few years 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:18.750
 the occasion for this survey is on the ds 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:24.359
 radeon hd 7000 730 this is the smallest 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:25.350
 Model of the tcm family brand new and here 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.880
 are the first cards ever 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.420
 have reached us are two models of 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.279
 sapphire 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.230
 they are the same at first sight 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.230
 but happened the same time the differences 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.399
 As you can see the pack is very 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.340
 similarly one sees only one on the top right 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:45.200
 certain note namely 1 gb gddr5 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:47.700
 and the other card is 2 gb ddr3 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.289
 people the one graphic card has only one 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.840
 gigabyte graphics memory or for 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:56.969
 fast gddr5 running at 2250 mhz 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:59.520
 while the other card is only 900 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.289
 megahertz has that means this 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.870
 has about two and a half times as many 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.400
 transfer rate transferrate is like free 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.650
 For example, multi sample can be evaluation 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.900
 Benefit means this card is 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.729
 probably much faster is the 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.159
 little sister of siemens stores 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.990
 because who more memory is just about 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.700
 marketing possible big number 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.409
 writing down makes the brochures 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.030
 always very good the economical one 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.310
 proved graphics cards is needed 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.780
 sees no additional power connection 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.490
 you up here as lacking what the 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.040
 Power is supplied solely by the 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.940
 slot can provide 75w 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.550
 maximum at connections 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:37.340
 with these cards everything ready what you want 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:39.380
 because that's where the blue of the 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.270
 d sub connection for older ct monitors 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.160
 there is a hdmi for current 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:46.070
 tv for example and a dvi for 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:49.190
 most pc monitor everything on board 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:52.100
 otherwise 7 of the cooler is indeed the 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.490
 same but the lot is a complete one 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.040
 other 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.000
 with the cards the gddr5 version is there 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.010
 There is no memory on the back 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.290
 here comes the ddr 3 version 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.630
 clearly as memory chips too 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:05.230
 recognize 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:07.760
 long without cooling too hot if not 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:11.960
 come now times without distinction of hd 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:14.000
 737 compared to the HD 7 750 the new one 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.940
 card was cut at the chip what 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.710
 she only has 384 shader units left 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:22.430
 The card is therefore the former 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:28.400
 smallest hd 7000 has 512 shaders so the 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:30.620
 750 she has only 384 the chip rate is the 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.740
 same with both cards 800 megahertz 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:37.100
 by default and as I said in the fdp 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:40.100
 5 version 2250 mhz memory clock that is 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:42.590
 also the same as the hd 57 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.989
 and hd 777 both have the same memory 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:48.230
 clock as I said it was special 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:50.750
 cheap graphics cards the radeon hd 37 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:54.980
 competes with the geforce gtx 6 50 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:58.520
 and 6 40 we have an asus gti 640 with 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:01.510
 2 gb ddr3 this card ends so the hd 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:04.250
 737 3 memory quite clear 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.980
 What we look at formans is to look at 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:09.220
 But before simply my view of 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.800
 this model 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:14.510
 although already several to the partners 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.160
 737 graphics cards have been announced missing 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:19.400
 a model with passive cooling as well 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:24.980
 this autec gt 430 is a curious ob 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:26.720
 that changes let's do it 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.520
 benchmarks but now it is already clear 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.670
 if you have the choice between 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:34.970
 a 1 gb ddr5 memory like this one 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:36.800
 and a 2 gb ddr3 memory should be on 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:40.390
 each case probably the other version two 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.390
 Euro cheaper the DDR five people
