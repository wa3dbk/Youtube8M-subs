00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:19.420 
creating characters it's one of the keys

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:21.570 
creating characters it's one of the keys

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:21.580 
to write a good fiction so I'm going to

to write a good fiction so I'm going to
tell<00:00:21.700> you<00:00:21.760> some<00:00:21.790> things<00:00:21.940> I've<00:00:22.390> done<00:00:22.689> that<00:00:23.380> have

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:25.990 
helped me create characters and I think

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:27.660 
helped me create characters and I think
they<00:00:26.080> can<00:00:26.110> work<00:00:26.439> for<00:00:26.830> no<00:00:27.160> matter<00:00:27.340> what<00:00:27.520> your

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:27.670 
they can work for no matter what your

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:30.120 
they can work for no matter what your
style<00:00:27.910> of<00:00:28.090> writing<00:00:28.330> is<00:00:28.720> and<00:00:29.020> whether<00:00:29.619> you<00:00:29.830> like

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:30.130 
style of writing is and whether you like

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.360 
style of writing is and whether you like
to<00:00:30.579> have<00:00:30.700> them<00:00:30.910> controlling<00:00:32.040> style<00:00:33.040> of

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:33.370 
to have them controlling style of

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.010 
to have them controlling style of
writing<00:00:33.579> leading<00:00:33.970> down<00:00:34.149> beforehand<00:00:34.780> or<00:00:34.810> if

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:35.020 
writing leading down beforehand or if

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.200 
writing leading down beforehand or if
you<00:00:35.110> like<00:00:35.170> to<00:00:35.440> be<00:00:35.640> free-flowing<00:00:36.640> and<00:00:36.850> created

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:41.860 
principles will work first one is to

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.130 
principles will work first one is to

that's important to learn to put

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.480 
that's important to learn to put
yourself<00:01:56.229> in<00:01:56.350> others<00:01:56.590> shoes<00:01:56.619> have<00:01:57.159> empathy

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
yourself in others shoes have empathy

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.959

it<00:04:02.680> as<00:04:02.830> I<00:04:03.550> was<00:04:03.670> writing<00:04:03.850> the<00:04:04.060> scene<00:04:05.280> surprised

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
it as I was writing the scene surprised

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.830 
it as I was writing the scene surprised
me<00:04:06.610> and<00:04:06.820> it<00:04:06.940> made<00:04:07.090> it<00:04:07.210> that<00:04:07.240> much<00:04:07.360> more<00:04:07.570> real

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
me and it made it that much more real

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.870 
me and it made it that much more real
there's<00:04:08.410> things<00:04:08.650> that<00:04:08.800> we<00:04:08.950> do<00:04:09.130> in<00:04:09.160> life<00:04:09.310> that

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:09.880 
there's things that we do in life that

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.850 
there's things that we do in life that
we<00:04:10.150> surprised<00:04:10.540> even<00:04:10.720> ourselves<00:04:10.960> and<00:04:11.560> I<00:04:11.620> think

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:11.860 
we surprised even ourselves and I think

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:14.700 
we surprised even ourselves and I think
you<00:04:12.010> can<00:04:12.360> bring<00:04:13.360> a<00:04:13.600> third<00:04:13.960> dimension<00:04:14.530> to<00:04:14.650> your

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:14.710 
you can bring a third dimension to your

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:17.660 
you can bring a third dimension to your
characters<00:04:15.280> and<00:04:15.610> bring<00:04:16.120> more<00:04:16.450> depth<00:04:16.810> and

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:17.670 
characters and bring more depth and

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:21.120 
characters and bring more depth and
resonance<00:04:18.670> within<00:04:19.080> when<00:04:20.080> you<00:04:20.350> let<00:04:20.560> us<00:04:20.739> see

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
resonance within when you let us see

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:23.040 
resonance within when you let us see
some<00:04:21.700> of<00:04:21.730> the<00:04:21.880> good<00:04:22.210> ways<00:04:22.390> they<00:04:22.600> react<00:04:22.900> to

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 
some of the good ways they react to

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:24.840

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:24.850 
things that we would never expect they

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:26.940 
things that we would never expect they
rise<00:04:25.060> above<00:04:25.420> take<00:04:25.810> the<00:04:25.960> high<00:04:26.020> road<00:04:26.080> maybe

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:26.950 
rise above take the high road maybe

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:29.280 
rise above take the high road maybe
sometimes<00:04:27.400> they<00:04:27.580> trip<00:04:28.120> and<00:04:28.300> stumble<00:04:28.570> maybe

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:29.290

00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.800 
memorable just so that when they walk on

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.290 
memorable just so that when they walk on
the<00:04:59.890> scene<00:05:00.100> we<00:05:00.280> know<00:05:00.430> who<00:05:00.580> they<00:05:00.700> are<00:05:00.880> we<00:05:01.210> don't

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300 
the scene we know who they are we don't

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.570
