inch<00:01:31.810> commonly<00:01:32.680> known<00:01:32.860> as<00:01:33.070> dots<00:01:33.520> per<00:01:33.729> inch<00:01:33.759> dpi

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 
inch commonly known as dots per inch dpi

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.350 
inch commonly known as dots per inch dpi
and<00:01:34.509> basically<00:01:35.350> in<00:01:35.680> an<00:01:35.860> inch<00:01:36.009> how<00:01:36.880> many<00:01:37.090> times

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 
and basically in an inch how many times

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:38.999 
and basically in an inch how many times
it<00:01:37.630> tracks<00:01:37.960> that<00:01:38.229> space<00:01:38.500> in<00:01:38.649> an<00:01:38.740> inch<00:01:38.860> so

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:39.009 
it tracks that space in an inch so

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:40.410 
it tracks that space in an inch so
basically<00:01:39.310> this<00:01:39.399> takes<00:01:39.640> five<00:01:40.000> hundred<00:01:40.299> counts

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
basically this takes five hundred counts

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.389 
basically this takes five hundred counts
in<00:01:40.750> one<00:01:41.049> inch<00:01:41.200> is<00:01:41.560> what<00:01:41.740> the<00:01:41.829> sensors<00:01:42.159> on<00:01:42.250> here

00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:42.399 
in one inch is what the sensors on here

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:45.330 
in one inch is what the sensors on here
and<00:01:42.549> which<00:01:43.329> is<00:01:43.450> very<00:01:43.719> very<00:01:44.020> precise<00:01:44.409> 500<00:01:45.039> way

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
and which is very very precise 500 way

sense it's what they call it and this is

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.780 
sense it's what they call it and this is
basically<00:02:31.300> your<00:02:31.660> CPI<00:02:32.430> counts<00:02:33.430> per<00:02:33.550> inch<00:02:33.730> so

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
basically your CPI counts per inch so

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.280 
basically your CPI counts per inch so
this<00:02:33.940> is<00:02:34.030> how<00:02:34.120> sensitive<00:02:34.480> is<00:02:34.629> now<00:02:34.810> you<00:02:34.870> can<00:02:35.080> go

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
this is how sensitive is now you can go

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.380 
this is how sensitive is now you can go
all<00:02:35.500> the<00:02:35.590> way<00:02:35.620> up<00:02:35.769> from<00:02:36.010> a<00:02:36.069> hundred<00:02:36.400> CPI<00:02:36.730> or<00:02:37.000> all

so that is a really cool feature
secondly<00:02:55.629> the<00:02:56.019> second<00:02:56.379> feature<00:02:56.500> is<00:02:56.709> a<00:02:57.190> thing

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
secondly the second feature is a thing

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.490 
secondly the second feature is a thing
called<00:02:57.430> exactly<00:02:58.180> exact<00:02:58.569> rate<00:02:58.900> it's<00:02:59.319> called

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
called exactly exact rate it's called

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.530 
called exactly exact rate it's called
and<00:02:59.680> basically<00:02:59.980> this<00:03:00.190> is<00:03:00.250> so<00:03:01.000> you<00:03:01.060> can<00:03:01.150> sink

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
do is that make the mouse really

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.300 
do is that make the mouse really
smoothing<00:03:14.379> game<00:03:14.560> so<00:03:14.829> that<00:03:14.950> it<00:03:15.069> will<00:03:15.129> just

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
smoothing game so that it will just

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:16.860 
smoothing game so that it will just
basic<00:03:15.610> sync<00:03:15.879> it<00:03:16.000> up<00:03:16.030> as<00:03:16.180> much<00:03:16.299> as<00:03:16.360> possible<00:03:16.599> so

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
basic sync it up as much as possible so

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:17.550 
basic sync it up as much as possible so
you're<00:03:16.989> going<00:03:17.079> to<00:03:17.140> get<00:03:17.230> the<00:03:17.349> best<00:03:17.470> performance

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
you're going to get the best performance

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.890 
you're going to get the best performance
from<00:03:17.890> this<00:03:18.069> and<00:03:18.310> it's<00:03:19.239> going<00:03:19.329> to<00:03:19.390> work<00:03:19.599> the

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
from this and it's going to work the

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.360 
from this and it's going to work the
best<00:03:20.110> of<00:03:20.200> your<00:03:20.319> screen<00:03:20.500> and<00:03:20.650> I<00:03:20.739> see<00:03:20.950> things<00:03:21.129> so

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
best of your screen and I see things so

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:22.949 
best of your screen and I see things so
another<00:03:21.579> performance<00:03:22.239> boost<00:03:22.540> there's<00:03:22.930> a

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
another performance boost there's a

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:23.970 
another performance boost there's a
little<00:03:23.170> one<00:03:23.290> bit<00:03:23.410> of<00:03:23.470> performance<00:03:23.590> boost

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
little one bit of performance boost

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.380 
little one bit of performance boost
nonetheless<00:03:24.190> again<00:03:24.879> be<00:03:25.030> changed<00:03:25.269> on<00:03:25.299> the

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
nonetheless again be changed on the

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.080 
nonetheless again be changed on the
screen<00:03:25.599> you've<00:03:26.440> also<00:03:26.590> got<00:03:26.950> and<00:03:27.160> I<00:03:27.790> can't

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
screen you've also got and I can't

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.000 
screen you've also got and I can't
remember<00:03:28.209> what<00:03:28.390> it's<00:03:28.510> called<00:03:28.569> but<00:03:28.989> i'll<00:03:29.859> put

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
remember what it's called but i'll put

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:31.559 
remember what it's called but i'll put
the<00:03:30.100> link<00:03:30.250> here<00:03:30.310> basically<00:03:30.880> it's<00:03:31.269> a<00:03:31.359> tool

00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:31.569 
the link here basically it's a tool

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:33.809 
the link here basically it's a tool
where<00:03:31.959> windows<00:03:32.560> by<00:03:32.859> default<00:03:33.340> it<00:03:33.579> kind<00:03:33.790> of

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:33.819 
where windows by default it kind of

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:35.520 
where windows by default it kind of
correct<00:03:34.209> so<00:03:34.480> say<00:03:34.660> if<00:03:34.720> you<00:03:34.810> tried<00:03:35.139> to<00:03:35.290> move<00:03:35.470> the

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
correct so say if you tried to move the

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:36.930 
correct so say if you tried to move the
mouse<00:03:35.889> and<00:03:35.920> a<00:03:36.160> straight<00:03:36.430> line<00:03:36.609> store<00:03:36.910> a

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
mouse and a straight line store a

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.280 
mouse and a straight line store a
straight<00:03:37.209> line<00:03:37.299> on<00:03:37.420> paint<00:03:37.630> when<00:03:38.109> those<00:03:38.260> are

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
straight line on paint when those are

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:39.930 
straight line on paint when those are
correct<00:03:38.709> that<00:03:38.829> your<00:03:39.069> movements<00:03:39.609> instead<00:03:39.850> of

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
correct that your movements instead of

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.099 
correct that your movements instead of
being<00:03:40.060> a<00:03:40.090> jerk<00:03:40.389> it<00:03:40.540> would<00:03:40.630> try<00:03:40.810> and<00:03:40.870> make<00:03:41.079> it

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:41.109 
being a jerk it would try and make it

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:42.629 
being a jerk it would try and make it
straight<00:03:41.440> for<00:03:41.650> you<00:03:41.739> and<00:03:42.190> when<00:03:42.280> games<00:03:42.489> this

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:42.639 
straight for you and when games this

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:44.039 
straight for you and when games this
isn't<00:03:42.970> good<00:03:43.150> because<00:03:43.299> you<00:03:43.599> might<00:03:43.750> not<00:03:43.780> want<00:03:43.989> it

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:44.049 
isn't good because you might not want it

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:45.210 
isn't good because you might not want it
to<00:03:44.139> go<00:03:44.230> straight<00:03:44.530> you<00:03:44.650> want<00:03:44.739> to<00:03:44.889> have<00:03:45.010> you<00:03:45.190> want

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
to go straight you want to have you want

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:46.860 
to go straight you want to have you want
the<00:03:45.430> mouse<00:03:45.700> to<00:03:45.730> move<00:03:45.910> exactly<00:03:46.569> how<00:03:46.660> you<00:03:46.720> move

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
the mouse to move exactly how you move

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.920 
the mouse to move exactly how you move
on<00:03:46.989> the<00:03:47.079> mass<00:03:47.200> map<00:03:47.410> to<00:03:47.889> steel<00:03:48.099> series<00:03:48.310> includes

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
on the mass map to steel series includes

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.539 
on the mass map to steel series includes
some<00:03:49.930> software<00:03:50.290> that<00:03:50.530> corrects<00:03:50.950> windows<00:03:51.340> and

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:51.549 
some software that corrects windows and

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:53.280 
some software that corrects windows and
said<00:03:51.670> if<00:03:51.790> you<00:03:51.910> move<00:03:52.120> a<00:03:52.209> millimeter<00:03:52.450> up<00:03:52.989> the

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
said if you move a millimeter up the

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.349 
said if you move a millimeter up the
kind<00:03:53.500> of<00:03:53.530> sideways<00:03:53.950> it<00:03:54.489> will<00:03:54.639> go<00:03:54.760> a<00:03:54.790> millimeter

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:55.359 
kind of sideways it will go a millimeter

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:57.000 
kind of sideways it will go a millimeter
in<00:03:55.480> exactly<00:03:55.840> that<00:03:55.959> direction<00:03:56.260> so<00:03:56.919> it

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010 
in exactly that direction so it

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:58.080 
in exactly that direction so it
basically<00:03:57.099> stops<00:03:57.519> windows<00:03:57.760> from<00:03:57.910> correcting

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
basically stops windows from correcting

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:59.580 
basically stops windows from correcting
your<00:03:58.299> movement<00:03:58.630> and<00:03:58.780> makes<00:03:59.019> it<00:03:59.139> as<00:03:59.200> accurate

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
your movement and makes it as accurate

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:05.909 
your movement and makes it as accurate
as<00:03:59.680> possible<00:03:59.739> on<00:04:00.190> the<00:04:00.459> mouse<00:04:00.609> and<00:04:03.030> up<00:04:04.919> profiles

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:05.919 
as possible on the mouse and up profiles

00:04:05.919 --> 00:04:08.640 
as possible on the mouse and up profiles
you<00:04:06.579> can<00:04:06.609> do<00:04:06.910> 5<00:04:07.630> profiles<00:04:07.870> still<00:04:08.349> the<00:04:08.500> mouse

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
you can do 5 profiles still the mouse

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.800 
you can do 5 profiles still the mouse
and<00:04:08.889> there's<00:04:09.880> a<00:04:09.970> yep<00:04:10.180> stored<00:04:10.450> in<00:04:10.510> the<00:04:10.569> mouth<00:04:10.660> so

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 
and there's a yep stored in the mouth so

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:12.559 
and there's a yep stored in the mouth so
any<00:04:10.959> computer<00:04:11.380> you<00:04:11.440> go<00:04:11.560> to<00:04:11.620> go<00:04:12.099> beyond<00:04:12.340> here

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:12.569 
any computer you go to go beyond here

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:15.390 
any computer you go to go beyond here
and<00:04:13.569> you<00:04:13.660> have<00:04:13.780> kind<00:04:13.930> of<00:04:14.049> two<00:04:14.319> semi<00:04:14.799> profiles

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 
and you have kind of two semi profiles

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.520 
and you have kind of two semi profiles
profiles<00:04:15.639> so<00:04:16.209> you<00:04:16.269> say<00:04:16.450> so<00:04:16.930> basically<00:04:17.260> it's

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530 
profiles so you say so basically it's

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:19.440 
profiles so you say so basically it's
the<00:04:17.919> semi<00:04:18.160> profiles<00:04:18.579> I'm<00:04:18.700> referring<00:04:18.970> to<00:04:19.120> is

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:19.450 
the semi profiles I'm referring to is

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:22.350 
the semi profiles I'm referring to is
the<00:04:19.750> LED<00:04:20.109> on<00:04:20.349> here<00:04:20.650> and<00:04:20.829> the<00:04:21.070> LED<00:04:21.370> off<00:04:21.639> now

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
the LED on here and the LED off now

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.339 
the LED on here and the LED off now
these<00:04:22.510> represent<00:04:23.080> /<00:04:23.440> profile<00:04:24.240> to<00:04:25.240> CPI<00:04:25.990> levels

00:04:26.339 --> 00:04:26.349 
these represent / profile to CPI levels

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:28.560 
these represent / profile to CPI levels
so<00:04:26.680> on<00:04:26.770> profile<00:04:27.099> one<00:04:27.280> you<00:04:27.550> can<00:04:27.700> have<00:04:27.729> high<00:04:28.150> CPI

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:28.570 
so on profile one you can have high CPI

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:30.690 
so on profile one you can have high CPI
and<00:04:28.870> low<00:04:29.080> CPI<00:04:29.470> and<00:04:30.099> what<00:04:30.190> that<00:04:30.310> means<00:04:30.490> is<00:04:30.669> that

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:30.700 
and low CPI and what that means is that

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:32.580 
and low CPI and what that means is that
if<00:04:30.940> you're<00:04:31.150> like<00:04:31.360> the<00:04:31.690> way<00:04:31.810> I<00:04:31.840> use<00:04:32.139> it<00:04:32.289> in<00:04:32.349> game

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 
if you're like the way I use it in game

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:33.719 
if you're like the way I use it in game
actually<00:04:32.770> you<00:04:33.039> just<00:04:33.220> have<00:04:33.310> a<00:04:33.340> one<00:04:33.550> touch

00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:33.729 
actually you just have a one touch

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:35.459 
actually you just have a one touch
button<00:04:33.909> there<00:04:34.539> this<00:04:34.719> button<00:04:35.020> when<00:04:35.200> you<00:04:35.289> press

00:04:35.459 --> 00:04:35.469 
button there this button when you press

00:04:35.469 --> 00:04:37.380 
button there this button when you press
it<00:04:35.500> changes<00:04:36.070> puts<00:04:36.940> the<00:04:37.000> light<00:04:37.120> on<00:04:37.240> and<00:04:37.270> off

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:37.390 
it changes puts the light on and off

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:39.390 
it changes puts the light on and off
here<00:04:37.630> and<00:04:38.020> it<00:04:38.140> changes<00:04:38.409> from<00:04:38.469> high<00:04:38.590> CPI<00:04:39.280> too

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400
