00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
start with the weight the they are just

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.560 
start with the weight the they are just
about<00:00:23.130> three<00:00:23.400> pounds<00:00:23.580> which<00:00:23.970> is<00:00:24.000> half<00:00:24.150> a<00:00:24.420> pound

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.410 
lighter than a normal rivetting which is
what<00:00:26.400> you<00:00:26.519> guys<00:00:26.609> are<00:00:26.789> pretty<00:00:26.939> much<00:00:27.000> all<00:00:27.210> used

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
to usually I mean it's a lot more front

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.220 
to usually I mean it's a lot more front
light<00:00:32.910> than<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.390> revetment<00:00:33.660> was<00:00:33.930> because<00:00:34.110> it

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
light than the revetment was because it

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.959 
light than the revetment was because it
has<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.440> normal<00:00:34.590> Phoenix<00:00:35.219> head<00:00:35.489> to<00:00:35.670> that<00:00:35.880> they

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
has the normal Phoenix head to that they

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.030 
has the normal Phoenix head to that they
had<00:00:36.120> on<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.329> standard<00:00:36.690> decks<00:00:36.899> not<00:00:37.680> this<00:00:37.829> is<00:00:38.010> a

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
had on the standard decks not this is a

coated<00:02:00.119> ones<00:02:00.270> are<00:02:00.390> a<00:02:00.420> little<00:02:00.570> stiff<00:02:00.899> to<00:02:01.049> get<00:02:01.170> in

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
coated ones are a little stiff to get in

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.789 
coated ones are a little stiff to get in
but<00:02:01.530> talk<00:02:02.070> to<00:02:02.189> you<00:02:02.250> bad<00:02:03.320> another<00:02:04.320> thing<00:02:04.590> is

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
but talk to you bad another thing is

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.530 
but talk to you bad another thing is
they<00:02:05.070> got<00:02:05.159> four<00:02:05.430> degrees<00:02:05.670> of<00:02:05.700> concave<00:02:06.180> inside

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
they got four degrees of concave inside

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.449 
they got four degrees of concave inside
the<00:02:06.659> normal<00:02:06.960> six<00:02:07.380> at<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:07.619> Reventon<00:02:07.860> sad<00:02:08.190> and

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
the normal six at the Reventon sad and

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.339 
the normal six at the Reventon sad and
then<00:02:09.149> run<00:02:09.300> to<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.450> edges<00:02:09.720> a<00:02:09.780> bit<00:02:09.810> so<00:02:10.140> it's<00:02:10.289> not

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
then run to the edges a bit so it's not

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:11.940 
then run to the edges a bit so it's not
stabbing<00:02:10.709> your<00:02:10.920> feet<00:02:11.039> anymore<00:02:11.340> which<00:02:11.610> is<00:02:11.640> all

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
stabbing your feet anymore which is all

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.650 
stabbing your feet anymore which is all
nice<00:02:13.500> the<00:02:14.500> thing<00:02:14.860> I<00:02:14.980> like<00:02:15.220> about<00:02:15.250> the<00:02:15.670> Dex<00:02:15.879> is

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
nice the thing I like about the Dex is

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.320 
nice the thing I like about the Dex is
the<00:02:16.870> paint<00:02:17.140> on<00:02:17.379> them<00:02:17.760> for<00:02:18.760> the<00:02:18.849> colors<00:02:19.150> is<00:02:19.300> a

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
the paint on them for the colors is a

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:20.759 
the paint on them for the colors is a
lot<00:02:19.540> different<00:02:19.690> it's<00:02:20.080> actually<00:02:20.500> kind<00:02:20.739> of

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:20.769 
lot different it's actually kind of

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:22.710 
lot different it's actually kind of
texturized<00:02:21.310> so<00:02:21.910> it's<00:02:22.060> not<00:02:22.180> just<00:02:22.239> a<00:02:22.540> flat

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
texturized so it's not just a flat

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.619 
texturized so it's not just a flat
powder<00:02:23.110> coat<00:02:23.440> or<00:02:23.650> flat<00:02:24.010> anodized<00:02:24.489> it's<00:02:25.480> just

00:02:25.619 --> 00:02:25.629 
powder coat or flat anodized it's just

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:28.530 
powder coat or flat anodized it's just
something<00:02:25.870> a<00:02:25.930> little<00:02:26.170> different<00:02:27.390> changing<00:02:28.390> it

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
something a little different changing it

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.130 
something a little different changing it
up<00:02:29.010> so<00:02:30.010> that's<00:02:30.400> a<00:02:30.519> cool<00:02:30.670> thing<00:02:30.940> it<00:02:31.870> doesn't

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
up so that's a cool thing it doesn't

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.259 
up so that's a cool thing it doesn't
hardly<00:02:32.349> run<00:02:32.530> it<00:02:32.620> for<00:02:32.800> you<00:02:32.890> yeah<00:02:33.700> I'm<00:02:34.000> in<00:02:34.120> right

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:34.269 
hardly run it for you yeah I'm in right

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:34.710 
hardly run it for you yeah I'm in right
in<00:02:34.390> mind

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
in mind
