00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 hello girls and boys well found on 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.540
 my channel then today make up review il 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.490
 role of a product that has me 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.040
 pleasantly pleasantly surprised 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.809
 then the saint laurent proposed 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.049
 this new product philology 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:19.529
 blur effect composed of three products 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:22.619
 of which two names liked 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.960
 one is the new blair primer is a primer 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:28.619
 the classic glass bottle inside 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:31.740
 of gold-colored mika particles though 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:35.219
 it is practically highly siliconic and al 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:38.579
 feel to this effect than to me 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:40.200
 personally from a little annoyance like the 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.030
 perception of no longer feeling either 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.000
 fingerprints for my taste is 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.579
 too silicon and for touch-ups during 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.920
 the day the compact blur that in one 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:53.489
 packaging like this then made in 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:56.160
 this way just to go to 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.469
 minimize pores even above the 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.100
 makeup remove shiny areas and 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:04.619
 guarantee you a photoshopped effect like 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:08.000
 above in the sense that among other things about me 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:11.369
 I didn't notice an effect particularly 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.010
 perfected in its pores or on the rest 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.140
 is applied to finished makeup miss eat 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.270
 a little bit the base therefore a is not a 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.180
 product that I like while in 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.640
 same line I'm in love with the new one 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.369
 lesar yen 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:31.619
 what is it is a very innovative product 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:34.770
 because it is a clint powder a come 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:39.210
 therefore called punctures like a balm 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:43.470
 natural sunkissed powder effect 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:45.720
 therefore it is a land but it is not really the 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.880
 earth is the middle ground between a 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.159
 primer perfectionist of the complexion 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.250
 a land and a powder and like all of them 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:55.770
 these things are merged into only two 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.530
 main application methodologies 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.689
 this is indeed provided 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.460
 brush on one side you have the 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.720
 brush on one side the sponge 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.670
 why 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.869
 behind you find the indications e 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:13.650
 the company says to have an effect 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:16.140
 contouring to use the brush 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.150
 so just go sculpt for a 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.490
 effect instead is in solos and therefore 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.590
 tanned all over her face take it 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:25.050
 with the sponge and applied 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.580
 from the inside to the outside in this 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:31.560
 way with the technique like the flower 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:33.300
 exceptional fondation is a product of 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.000
 whom I loved I loved 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.830
 very much the soleil tande chanel that 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.070
 unfortunately I got out of production 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:43.050
 very much sorry and I was expecting a 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.640
 product of this type but to say that a 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.440
 matera in crema is not true is 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.060
 absolutely reductive 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.850
 among other things, being a product anyway 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:54.090
 silicone effect blur is impossible 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:56.459
 make stain and has an effect too 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.990
 perfect on the complexion but much more 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.800
 natural of the products I have mentioned 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.959
 before 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:06.260
 the packaging is beautiful you have it in 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:08.820
 this way these gum with bronze logo 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.530
 mirror and this is the product like 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:12.690
 you will immediately see the color is rather 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.910
 clear and not even the clearest 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.790
 because the colors start at 2 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:21.000
 this is the color 3 actually are 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:24.269
 all rather between the albikokka and ha 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.250
 launched because it is not a cold earth 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:27.570
 from contouring can be used 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.930
 also to warm the face but it is 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:31.650
 tends to warm up the color of 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.200
 ton 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:37.080
 I chose 3 because it's colder 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:39.840
 of the 2 but there are seems to me five 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:41.730
 colors if I'm not mistaken and at one 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.400
 small bottle unlike other times 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:47.850
 not in velvet but looks like in satin and 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.769
 much more flat logo effect we go to 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:51.150
 applying it I like to apply with a 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:53.370
 natural bristle brush 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:59.580
 I used to tell you how I wear color 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:04:03.239
 number 3 which is called and epis 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:06.209
 I'll show you how I apply it 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:10.739
 I took it now I'm already touched but 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:13.459
 I have no land or just a bit of blush 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:16.799
 below the blush I start to apply it 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:23.220
 has a boy effect is very natural and 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:25.110
 very stratify bill and that is as if you are 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:33.150
 I melted with the complexion I don't know of 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:35.370
 or in a different way to me the effect 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.740
 makes the other go crazy too 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:39.900
 very easy even for people who 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.700
 start to wear makeup you know that 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:44.070
 this year in particular he is back 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:46.770
 much the free blue look does not have this effect 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:49.860
 browsers and all companies are there 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:52.880
 proposing products operating with touring or 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:55.220
 for multi-effect power 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:58.080
 etc. but this has an effect 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:00.960
 very natural and very elegant believe me 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.000
 I literally fell in love with it 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:06.210
 I find it really a product 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.979
 revolutionary because of the performances e 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:10.530
 the duration of a cream product 

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:14.370
 the improved effect of the primer 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:16.979
 color of a land that is more e 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:19.350
 stratified the product becomes more 

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:22.140
 visible now in the room consider that 

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:24.000
 it is noticeable much less also live from 

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:27.180
 alive this already has an effect as if i 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:31.229
 had gone a day at the pool but 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:32.580
 I didn't want it anyway it's very natural 

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:35.130
 so much so that it is fine also for 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:37.830
 be applied on the whole face like 

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:39.470
 almost as if it were a bronzing foundation 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:41.760
 but you have understood what I mean 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:43.410
 it can also be used very well for 

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:49.010
 for example against the nosy ve ve 

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:49.010
 I'll show you looking for a small brush 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:57.560
 indeed I get a sculpted effect but 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:06:01.690
 very natural and about me among other things has 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:01.690
 excellent durability in hours 

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:23.160
 karate how beautiful I do not know if in the room 

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:26.180
 having among other things his eyes 

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:29.370
 tried to apply it also as blush 

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:33.150
 type used with fingers and has an effect 

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:36.030
 like a blush biscuit then you more 

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:38.190
 or applied by tapping plus has a 

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:41.599
 intense effect plus pull the product 

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:44.849
 plus it literally fuses with the skin 

00:06:41.599 --> 00:06:48.599
 then the cost varies from store to store 

00:06:44.849 --> 00:06:51.810
 I paid for this if I'm not mistaken 45 

00:06:48.599 --> 00:06:52.830
 I believe, however, it is in different bands 

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:55.909
 price 

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:58.770
 now I'm not telling you the line 

00:06:55.909 --> 00:07:00.780
 be disgusting I am nobody to say 

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:04.199
 I'm saying this perception 

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:06.330
 very siliconic I don't like this 

00:07:04.199 --> 00:07:07.979
 for me it's a less silicon perception 

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:10.889
 and in addition I find the product very much 

00:07:07.979 --> 00:07:12.139
 innovative and very functional and look 

00:07:10.889 --> 00:07:15.419
 has an effect 

00:07:12.139 --> 00:07:18.210
 look you don't notice in the room 

00:07:15.419 --> 00:07:21.810
 see my warms the complexion it seems 

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:24.449
 like something that doesn't come from within 

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:26.310
 applied from outside and look at how 

00:07:24.449 --> 00:07:28.500
 heat the outline naturally 

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:30.120
 do not see dead end do not come where it starts 

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:31.680
 application of the product where it ends 

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:32.099
 because it is based is literally with the 

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:34.080
 skin 

00:07:32.099 --> 00:07:36.330
 I applied or compact second 

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:37.770
 max color and continues to like it 

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:39.449
 so much and I had to tan more 

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:42.150
 definitely buy or even a color 

00:07:39.449 --> 00:07:44.159
 darker because it drives me crazy ie 

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:45.569
 really to a product that one of 

00:07:44.159 --> 00:07:47.430
 those that impressed me the most that I have 

00:07:45.569 --> 00:07:49.169
 purchased lately I hope to be 

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:51.810
 Was it useful guys and let me know if 

00:07:49.169 --> 00:07:55.639
 you have tried it if you like it if you say 

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:55.639
 I live in a kiss to the next one
