across<00:02:52.190> the<00:02:52.400> United<00:02:52.700> States<00:02:52.730> because<00:02:53.269> of

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:53.329 
across the United States because of

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:54.940 
across the United States because of
Triscuit<00:02:53.810> that's<00:02:54.049> part<00:02:54.319> of<00:02:54.379> the<00:02:54.470> whole<00:02:54.709> thing

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
Triscuit that's part of the whole thing

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.879 
Triscuit that's part of the whole thing
as<00:02:55.129> well<00:02:55.310> and<00:02:55.609> so<00:02:56.599> you<00:02:56.659> can<00:02:57.049> see<00:02:57.230> how<00:02:57.349> easy<00:02:57.680> it

00:02:57.879 --> 00:02:57.889 
as well and so you can see how easy it

00:02:57.889 --> 00:03:00.190 
as well and so you can see how easy it
is<00:02:58.069> if<00:02:58.400> everybody<00:02:58.760> were<00:02:59.030> to<00:02:59.090> do<00:02:59.389> that<00:02:59.629> we<00:03:00.079> don't

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
is if everybody were to do that we don't

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.490 
is if everybody were to do that we don't
have<00:03:00.470> a<00:03:00.500> 40%<00:03:01.010> hunger<00:03:01.639> rate<00:03:01.819> in<00:03:02.150> our<00:03:02.780> country<00:03:03.349> we

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
have a 40% hunger rate in our country we

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.259 
have a 40% hunger rate in our country we
have<00:03:03.530> about<00:03:03.799> a<00:03:03.859> 13<00:03:04.340> percent<00:03:04.519> hunger<00:03:04.970> rate<00:03:05.120> so

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:05.269 
have about a 13 percent hunger rate so

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:06.729 
have about a 13 percent hunger rate so
we<00:03:05.359> certainly<00:03:05.659> could<00:03:06.019> get<00:03:06.170> rid<00:03:06.319> of<00:03:06.349> hunger<00:03:06.620> in

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:06.739 
we certainly could get rid of hunger in

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:08.530 
we certainly could get rid of hunger in
