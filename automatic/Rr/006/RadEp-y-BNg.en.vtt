a small rise in temperature this

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.410 
a small rise in temperature this
probably<00:02:52.100> means<00:02:52.459> that<00:02:52.640> our<00:02:52.790> heat<00:02:52.970> sink<00:02:53.270> did

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
probably means that our heat sink did

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.360 
probably means that our heat sink did
not<00:02:53.570> completely<00:02:54.020> remove<00:02:54.410> the<00:02:54.590> heat<00:02:54.770> generated

by the compression of the air if you

by the compression of the air if you
look<00:02:57.890> carefully<00:02:58.100> you<00:02:58.910> will<00:02:58.940> see<00:02:59.239> that<00:02:59.420> the

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.400 
internal air temperature of the bottle
roughly<00:03:02.150> corresponds<00:03:02.780> to<00:03:02.870> the<00:03:02.989> temperature

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410
