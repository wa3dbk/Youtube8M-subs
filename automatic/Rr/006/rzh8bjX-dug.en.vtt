he's not going to forget about me but I

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:08.390 
he's not going to forget about me but I
was<00:00:06.720> aware<00:00:07.200> that<00:00:07.230> he<00:00:07.529> was<00:00:07.649> on<00:00:07.799> a<00:00:07.830> very<00:00:08.069> flimsy

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
was aware that he was on a very flimsy

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.180 
was aware that he was on a very flimsy
part<00:00:08.880> of<00:00:09.090> the<00:00:09.210> roof<00:00:09.420> and<00:00:09.719> I<00:00:10.500> was<00:00:10.769> about<00:00:10.980> three

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
part of the roof and I was about three

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:12.980 
part of the roof and I was about three
rows<00:00:11.460> back<00:00:11.880> from<00:00:12.240> there<00:00:12.420> so<00:00:12.599> it<00:00:12.660> wasn't<00:00:12.900> the

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
rows back from there so it wasn't the

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.020 
rows back from there so it wasn't the
easiest<00:00:13.019> thing<00:00:13.559> for<00:00:13.920> him<00:00:14.040> to<00:00:14.070> do<00:00:14.370> and<00:00:14.580> I

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
easiest thing for him to do and I

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.570 
easiest thing for him to do and I
certainly<00:00:15.450> wasn't<00:00:15.690> gonna<00:00:15.870> run<00:00:16.080> down<00:00:16.350> there<00:00:16.590> so

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
certainly wasn't gonna run down there so

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.310 
certainly wasn't gonna run down there so
I<00:00:17.910> think<00:00:18.090> everybody<00:00:18.449> started<00:00:18.779> shouting<00:00:18.990> at

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
I think everybody started shouting at

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.920 
I think everybody started shouting at
him<00:00:19.470> what<00:00:19.650> about<00:00:19.830> your<00:00:20.010> mom<00:00:20.189> and<00:00:20.600> he<00:00:21.600> came<00:00:21.810> to

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.300 
to be a bit of a missed opportunity yeah
it<00:01:47.579> is<00:01:47.939> it's<00:01:48.270> some<00:01:48.509> tennis<00:01:48.990> it<00:01:49.170> has<00:01:49.409> you<00:01:50.189> know

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
it is it's some tennis it has you know

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.370 
it is it's some tennis it has you know
it's<00:01:50.520> I<00:01:51.030> think<00:01:51.479> it's<00:01:51.720> always<00:01:51.869> been<00:01:52.229> an

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
it's I think it's always been an

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.260 
it's I think it's always been an
optional<00:01:52.799> sport<00:01:53.159> in<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.729> Commonwealth<00:01:54.119> Games

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
optional sport in the Commonwealth Games

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.539 
optional sport in the Commonwealth Games
it's<00:01:54.509> not<00:01:54.659> every<00:01:54.960> country<00:01:55.470> that<00:01:55.500> has<00:01:55.860> got<00:01:56.310> a

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
it's not every country that has got a

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.240 
it's not every country that has got a
tennis<00:01:56.969> facility<00:01:57.390> big<00:01:57.570> enough<00:01:57.750> to<00:01:58.040> cope<00:01:59.040> with

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
tennis facility big enough to cope with

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.520 
tennis facility big enough to cope with
with<00:01:59.460> tennis<00:01:59.820> so<00:02:00.000> you<00:02:00.509> know<00:02:00.600> I<00:02:00.899> think<00:02:01.259> when<00:02:01.439> it

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
with tennis so you know I think when it

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.920 
with tennis so you know I think when it
was<00:02:01.619> in<00:02:01.740> Delhi<00:02:02.130> a<00:02:02.850> few<00:02:03.180> years<00:02:03.390> ago<00:02:03.630> that's<00:02:03.840> the

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
was in Delhi a few years ago that's the

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.090 
was in Delhi a few years ago that's the
first<00:02:04.079> time<00:02:04.259> that<00:02:04.409> they'd<00:02:04.500> had<00:02:04.649> tennis<00:02:04.950> for

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
first time that they'd had tennis for

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.880 
first time that they'd had tennis for
many<00:02:05.280> years<00:02:05.719> but<00:02:06.719> obviously<00:02:07.140> in<00:02:07.320> hindsight

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
many years but obviously in hindsight

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.100 
many years but obviously in hindsight
it's<00:02:08.099> a<00:02:08.129> great<00:02:08.310> thing<00:02:08.550> and<00:02:08.729> you<00:02:09.720> know<00:02:09.810> it<00:02:09.959> would

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
it's a great thing and you know it would

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.229 
it's a great thing and you know it would
have<00:02:10.229> been<00:02:10.289> an<00:02:10.530> incredible<00:02:11.430> opportunity<00:02:11.580> for

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
have been an incredible opportunity for

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.340 
have been an incredible opportunity for
for<00:02:12.599> tennis<00:02:12.930> and<00:02:12.989> for<00:02:13.140> the

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
for tennis and for the

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.170

gatta<00:02:13.500> shares<00:02:13.860> to<00:02:14.010> be<00:02:14.100> able<00:02:14.160> to<00:02:14.280> show<00:02:14.580> that

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
gatta shares to be able to show that

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.580 
gatta shares to be able to show that
they<00:02:15.330> are<00:02:15.360> contenders<00:02:16.020> on<00:02:16.140> the<00:02:16.230> world<00:02:16.380> stage

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
they are contenders on the world stage

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.260 
they are contenders on the world stage
