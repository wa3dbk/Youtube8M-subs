interested in visiting such as Southeast

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.100 
interested in visiting such as Southeast
Asia<00:02:29.590> so<00:02:30.590> then<00:02:30.740> I<00:02:30.770> also<00:02:31.100> picked<00:02:31.880> up<00:02:32.210> the<00:02:32.870> West

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110

originally<00:02:38.060> when<00:02:38.210> I<00:02:38.240> read<00:02:38.450> this<00:02:38.600> I<00:02:38.660> thought<00:02:38.990> it

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
originally when I read this I thought it

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:40.780 
originally when I read this I thought it
said<00:02:39.290> Austria<00:02:39.890> New<00:02:40.190> Zealand<00:02:40.460> which<00:02:40.580> I<00:02:40.670> thought

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
said Austria New Zealand which I thought

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.670 
said Austria New Zealand which I thought
was<00:02:40.910> an<00:02:41.030> odd<00:02:41.150> accommodation<00:02:41.840> so<00:02:42.080> this<00:02:42.230> makes<00:02:42.440> a

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
was an odd accommodation so this makes a

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.540 
was an odd accommodation so this makes a
lot<00:02:42.860> more<00:02:42.890> sense<00:02:43.540> Switzerland<00:02:44.540> Russia<00:02:45.550> the

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
lot more sense Switzerland Russia the

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.030 
lot more sense Switzerland Russia the
Arab<00:02:46.910> world<00:02:46.940> and<00:02:47.770> Eastern<00:02:48.770> Europe

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
Arab world and Eastern Europe

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.040 
Arab world and Eastern Europe
czechoslovakia<00:02:49.820> hungary<00:02:50.000> and<00:02:50.180> poland<00:02:50.300> in

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
czechoslovakia hungary and poland in

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:52.990 
czechoslovakia hungary and poland in
particular<00:02:51.560> ones<00:02:51.770> like<00:02:51.950> this<00:02:52.160> or<00:02:52.550> say<00:02:52.850> the

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
particular ones like this or say the

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.280 
particular ones like this or say the
arab<00:02:53.240> world<00:02:53.510> I<00:02:53.780> thought<00:02:53.960> would<00:02:54.020> be<00:02:54.080> really

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
arab world I thought would be really

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:55.840 
arab world I thought would be really
interesting<00:02:54.740> to<00:02:54.770> read<00:02:55.040> because<00:02:55.160> obviously<00:02:55.460> it

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
interesting to read because obviously it

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:57.370 
interesting to read because obviously it
says<00:02:56.000> Czechoslovakia<00:02:56.840> these<00:02:57.050> are<00:02:57.170> from<00:02:57.260> the

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
says Czechoslovakia these are from the

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.620 
says Czechoslovakia these are from the
60s<00:02:57.860> so<00:02:58.010> it'd<00:02:58.130> also<00:02:58.280> be<00:02:58.490> interesting<00:02:59.000> to<00:02:59.420> see

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
60s so it'd also be interesting to see

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.720 
60s so it'd also be interesting to see
how<00:02:59.750> things<00:02:59.990> have<00:03:00.110> changed<00:03:00.140> okay<00:03:01.070> so<00:03:01.400> because

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:16.040 
politically at least in this first book

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.580

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.910 
second book hopefully it didn't actually
check<00:04:33.390> but<00:04:33.570> I'm<00:04:33.660> pretty<00:04:34.200> sure<00:04:34.500> this<00:04:34.650> is<00:04:34.710> the

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:34.920 
check but I'm pretty sure this is the

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.770 
check but I'm pretty sure this is the
second<00:04:35.250> book<00:04:35.400> in<00:04:35.670> the<00:04:35.850> Dublin<00:04:36.390> Murder<00:04:36.570> Squad

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780 
second book in the Dublin Murder Squad

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.290 
second book in the Dublin Murder Squad
series<00:04:37.350> I<00:04:37.530> absolutely<00:04:37.770> adored<00:04:38.550> in<00:04:38.910> the<00:04:39.060> woods

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
series I absolutely adored in the woods

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:40.700 
series I absolutely adored in the woods
which<00:04:39.510> they<00:04:39.750> didn't<00:04:40.020> have<00:04:40.200> or<00:04:40.410> I<00:04:40.470> would<00:04:40.620> have

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
which they didn't have or I would have

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.980 
which they didn't have or I would have
picked<00:04:40.890> up<00:04:41.010> as<00:04:41.160> well<00:04:41.340> but<00:04:42.330> such<00:04:42.570> a<00:04:42.750> refreshing

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
picked up as well but such a refreshing

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:46.550 
picked up as well but such a refreshing
take<00:04:43.440> on<00:04:43.560> the<00:04:43.710> detective<00:04:44.340> a<00:04:44.370> crime<00:04:44.820> genre<00:04:45.560> the

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 
take on the detective a crime genre the

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:47.840 
take on the detective a crime genre the
first<00:04:46.770> book<00:04:46.980> was<00:04:47.070> probably<00:04:47.370> my<00:04:47.520> most

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:47.850 
first book was probably my most

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:49.970 
first book was probably my most
surprising<00:04:48.750> favorite<00:04:49.140> of<00:04:49.290> this<00:04:49.410> year<00:04:49.590> so<00:04:49.770> far

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:49.980 
surprising favorite of this year so far

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:53.180 
surprising favorite of this year so far
and<00:04:50.730> i<00:04:50.970> forgot<00:04:51.210> to<00:04:51.270> say<00:04:51.390> but<00:04:51.510> this<00:04:51.750> was<00:04:51.960> 525<00:04:52.770> and

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.190 
and i forgot to say but this was 525 and

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:55.520 
and i forgot to say but this was 525 and
daughter<00:04:53.460> of<00:04:53.700> the<00:04:53.820> blood<00:04:54.030> was<00:04:54.330> 250<00:04:55.050> so<00:04:55.260> I<00:04:55.290> think

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:55.530 
daughter of the blood was 250 so I think

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:57.800 
daughter of the blood was 250 so I think
if<00:04:55.650> they're<00:04:55.890> relatively<00:04:56.640> new<00:04:56.970> paperbacks<00:04:57.540> and

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810 
if they're relatively new paperbacks and

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:59.630 
if they're relatively new paperbacks and
in<00:04:58.350> good<00:04:58.530> condition<00:04:58.560> it<00:04:59.130> seems<00:04:59.340> like<00:04:59.460> they're

00:04:59.630 --> 00:04:59.640 
in good condition it seems like they're

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.150 
in good condition it seems like they're
all<00:04:59.730> 525<00:05:00.450> then<00:05:01.170> I<00:05:01.200> had<00:05:01.530> not<00:05:01.710> heard<00:05:01.770> of<00:05:02.040> this

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 
all 525 then I had not heard of this

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.520 
all 525 then I had not heard of this
before<00:05:02.340> but<00:05:02.730> that<00:05:02.790> is<00:05:03.060> surfacing<00:05:03.660> by<00:05:04.080> Margaret

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:04.530 
before but that is surfacing by Margaret

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:06.350 
before but that is surfacing by Margaret
Atwood<00:05:04.680> the<00:05:05.460> handmaid's<00:05:05.790> tale<00:05:05.880> was<00:05:06.210> my

Atwood the handmaid's tale was my

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.650

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:13.590 
this because when i think of Margaret

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:16.520 
this because when i think of Margaret
Atwood<00:05:13.890> I<00:05:13.920> don't<00:05:14.310> think<00:05:14.790> of<00:05:15.020> a<00:05:16.020> detective
