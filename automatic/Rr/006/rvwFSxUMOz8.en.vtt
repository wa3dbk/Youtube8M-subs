00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
580 the only thing that's that kind of

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.970 
580 the only thing that's that kind of
sucks<00:00:39.090> about<00:00:39.270> 430<00:00:39.750> is<00:00:39.870> it<00:00:40.079> can't<00:00:40.350> be<00:00:40.500> used<00:00:40.739> as<00:00:40.890> a

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
sucks about 430 is it can't be used as a

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.549 
sucks about 430 is it can't be used as a
master<00:00:41.250> it<00:00:41.520> can<00:00:41.610> only<00:00:41.670> be<00:00:41.820> used<00:00:41.969> as<00:00:42.090> a<00:00:42.120> slave<00:00:42.559> so

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
master it can only be used as a slave so

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.069 
master it can only be used as a slave so
um<00:00:44.040> but<00:00:45.030> I'm<00:00:45.149> going<00:00:45.270> to<00:00:45.329> run<00:00:45.510> through<00:00:45.809> some<00:00:45.840> of

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
um but I'm going to run through some of

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.010 
um but I'm going to run through some of
the<00:00:46.140> basic<00:00:46.530> functions<00:00:47.100> of<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.719> 430ex<00:00:48.719> to

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
the basic functions of the 430ex to

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.779 
the basic functions of the 430ex to
speed<00:00:49.289> light<00:00:49.440> so<00:00:49.710> some<00:00:50.219> of<00:00:50.250> you<00:00:50.399> might<00:00:50.550> you

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
speed light so some of you might you

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.250 
speed light so some of you might you
know<00:00:50.910> if<00:00:51.120> you<00:00:51.239> have<00:00:51.449> one<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:51.989> you<00:00:52.079> don't

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
know if you have one and you don't

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.110 
know if you have one and you don't
really<00:00:52.379> understand<00:00:52.739> how<00:00:52.770> it<00:00:52.890> works<00:00:53.160> after

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
really understand how it works after

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.420 
really understand how it works after
this<00:00:54.449> little<00:00:54.719> instructional<00:00:55.590> video<00:00:55.890> I<00:00:55.949> think

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
this little instructional video I think

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.220 
this little instructional video I think
that<00:00:56.579> you'll<00:00:56.730> have<00:00:56.969> a<00:00:57.000> lot<00:00:57.210> better<00:00:57.390> grasp<00:00:57.960> on

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
that you'll have a lot better grasp on

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.680 
that you'll have a lot better grasp on
how<00:00:58.350> things<00:00:58.620> work<00:00:58.920> so<00:00:59.399> Morgan<00:01:00.390> staroffice

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
how things work so Morgan staroffice

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.349 
how things work so Morgan staroffice
will<00:01:01.109> turn<00:01:01.260> that<00:01:01.410> turn<00:01:01.620> it<00:01:01.770> off<00:01:01.890> and<00:01:02.359> we'll

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
will turn that turn it off and we'll

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.429 
will turn that turn it off and we'll
turn<00:01:03.449> it<00:01:03.570> back<00:01:03.600> on<00:01:03.719> here<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:04.610> as<00:01:05.610> you<00:01:05.850> can<00:01:06.000> see

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:06.439 
turn it back on here and as you can see

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:09.050 
turn it back on here and as you can see
the<00:01:07.439> pilot<00:01:07.650> light<00:01:07.890> is<00:01:08.010> on<00:01:08.159> so<00:01:08.520> whenever<00:01:08.880> you

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
the pilot light is on so whenever you

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.060 
the pilot light is on so whenever you
see<00:01:09.150> this<00:01:09.240> red<00:01:09.450> light<00:01:09.689> what<00:01:09.900> that<00:01:10.049> means<00:01:10.290> is<00:01:10.590> is

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
see this red light what that means is is

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.270 
see this red light what that means is is
the<00:01:11.340> is<00:01:11.610> when<00:01:11.909> you<00:01:12.000> push<00:01:12.240> it<00:01:13.040> that<00:01:14.040> just<00:01:14.189> let

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
the is when you push it that just let

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.399 
the is when you push it that just let
you<00:01:14.369> know<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.610> flash<00:01:14.909> is<00:01:15.299> good<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:15.960> go<00:01:16.080> so<00:01:16.320> if

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
you know the flash is good to go so if

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.770 
you know the flash is good to go so if
your<00:01:16.530> batteries<00:01:16.920> are<00:01:16.950> weak<00:01:17.220> or<00:01:17.340> whatever<00:01:17.780> what

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
your batteries are weak or whatever what

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.200 
your batteries are weak or whatever what
you'll<00:01:18.930> notice<00:01:19.140> is<00:01:19.590> is<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.250> pilot<00:01:20.670> light<00:01:20.850> will

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
you'll notice is is the pilot light will

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.420 
you'll notice is is the pilot light will
take<00:01:21.540> longer<00:01:21.930> to<00:01:22.290> relight<00:01:22.799> itself<00:01:23.220> before

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
take longer to relight itself before

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.980 
take longer to relight itself before
it's<00:01:23.670> ready<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:23.880> take<00:01:23.970> another<00:01:24.330> shoot<00:01:24.750> or

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
it's ready to take another shoot or

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.240 
it's ready to take another shoot or
before<00:01:25.650> you're<00:01:25.740> ready<00:01:25.860> to<00:01:25.920> take<00:01:26.009> another

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
before you're ready to take another

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.240 
before you're ready to take another
picture<00:01:26.750> so<00:01:27.750> long<00:01:28.350> as<00:01:28.439> your<00:01:28.530> pod<00:01:28.680> lights<00:01:29.009> on

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
picture so long as your pod lights on

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.600 
picture so long as your pod lights on
though<00:01:29.490> you're<00:01:29.700> good<00:01:29.970> to<00:01:30.150> snapshot<00:01:31.340> so<00:01:32.340> if<00:01:32.520> you

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
though you're good to snapshot so if you

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.550 
though you're good to snapshot so if you
notice<00:01:32.939> that<00:01:32.970> after<00:01:33.509> you<00:01:33.720> take<00:01:33.930> a<00:01:33.960> shot<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:34.470> it

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
notice that after you take a shot and it

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.990 
notice that after you take a shot and it
waits<00:01:34.680> about<00:01:34.920> five<00:01:35.100> seconds<00:01:35.670> you're<00:01:35.729> probably

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
waits about five seconds you're probably

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.950 
waits about five seconds you're probably
going<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:36.270> be<00:01:36.390> wanting<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.659> change<00:01:36.840> those

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
going to be wanting to change those

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.330 
going to be wanting to change those
batteries<00:01:37.290> very<00:01:37.500> soon<00:01:37.799> because<00:01:38.100> you're<00:01:38.220> not

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
is ETTL and what a TTL is is pretty much

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.550 
is ETTL and what a TTL is is pretty much
just<00:02:03.119> an<00:02:03.240> automatic<00:02:03.810> function<00:02:03.990> for<00:02:04.409> your

jump back and forth right here and and

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.199 
jump back and forth right here and and
you<00:02:34.330> can<00:02:34.569> like<00:02:35.110> say<00:02:35.319> I<00:02:35.349> wanted<00:02:35.769> more<00:02:36.010> flash<00:02:36.310> I'm

you can like say I wanted more flash I'm

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:38.610 
you can like say I wanted more flash I'm
going<00:02:37.510> to<00:02:37.599> go<00:02:37.720> to<00:02:37.780> the<00:02:38.019> right<00:02:38.200> so<00:02:38.379> I'm<00:02:38.440> going<00:02:38.530> to

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
going to go to the right so I'm going to

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.470 
going to go to the right so I'm going to
push<00:02:38.709> the<00:02:38.830> right<00:02:38.950> buttons<00:02:39.340> and<00:02:39.549> these<00:02:40.360> are

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
push the right buttons and these are

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.369 
push the right buttons and these are
these<00:02:40.780> are<00:02:40.840> stops<00:02:41.230> in<00:02:41.500> between<00:02:41.920> so<00:02:42.910> like<00:02:43.180> so<00:02:43.989> if

00:02:44.369 --> 00:02:44.379 
these are stops in between so like so if

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:46.140 
these are stops in between so like so if
we<00:02:44.530> have<00:02:44.680> it<00:02:44.769> at<00:02:44.860> 1<00:02:45.069> 1<00:02:45.280> this<00:02:45.580> is<00:02:45.700> the<00:02:45.730> full

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
we have it at 1 1 this is the full

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:47.759 
we have it at 1 1 this is the full
amount<00:02:46.630> of<00:02:46.690> flash<00:02:46.900> that<00:02:46.959> this<00:02:47.290> thing<00:02:47.440> can<00:02:47.590> put

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769 
amount of flash that this thing can put

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:53.400 
amount of flash that this thing can put
out<00:02:47.890> now<00:02:48.670> you<00:02:48.730> go<00:02:49.090> to<00:02:49.680> 1/7<00:02:50.970> so<00:02:51.970> it's<00:02:52.480> not<00:02:53.230> the

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
out now you go to 1/7 so it's not the

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.589 
out now you go to 1/7 so it's not the
full<00:02:53.560> amount<00:02:53.799> but<00:02:54.040> still<00:02:54.250> very<00:02:54.280> strong<00:02:54.730> you<00:02:55.480> go

00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:55.599 
full amount but still very strong you go

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:58.080 
full amount but still very strong you go
to<00:02:55.660> 1<00:02:55.840> 2<00:02:55.989> so<00:02:56.200> this<00:02:56.290> is<00:02:56.349> this<00:02:57.099> is<00:02:57.160> one<00:02:57.430> half<00:02:57.790> of

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
to 1 2 so this is this is one half of

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.170 
to 1 2 so this is this is one half of
what<00:02:59.019> it<00:02:59.260> can<00:02:59.410> put<00:02:59.560> out<00:02:59.709> and<00:02:59.950> then<00:03:00.489> there<00:03:00.910> stops

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
what it can put out and then there stops

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.650 
what it can put out and then there stops
in<00:03:01.390> between<00:03:01.480> and<00:03:02.049> then<00:03:02.170> we<00:03:02.410> go<00:03:02.500> to<00:03:02.530> 1/4<00:03:03.239> 1/8<00:03:04.239> and

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
in between and then we go to 1/4 1/8 and

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.270 
in between and then we go to 1/4 1/8 and
I<00:03:04.989> think<00:03:05.290> this<00:03:05.440> jumps<00:03:05.680> over<00:03:05.799> to<00:03:05.950> one

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
I think this jumps over to one

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.309 
I think this jumps over to one
sixty-fourth<00:03:07.150> and<00:03:07.510> might<00:03:07.750> go<00:03:07.900> a<00:03:07.930> little<00:03:08.019> bit

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319 
sixty-fourth and might go a little bit

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:10.800 
sixty-fourth and might go a little bit
higher<00:03:08.500> so<00:03:09.190> yeah<00:03:09.340> it<00:03:09.549> will<00:03:09.670> go<00:03:09.730> up<00:03:09.790> to<00:03:09.879> 1/64<00:03:10.660> of

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
higher so yeah it will go up to 1/64 of

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.490 
higher so yeah it will go up to 1/64 of
its<00:03:11.019> full<00:03:11.319> power<00:03:12.510> so<00:03:13.510> say<00:03:13.900> you're<00:03:14.079> in<00:03:14.230> a<00:03:14.290> bright

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
its full power so say you're in a bright

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.110 
its full power so say you're in a bright
situation<00:03:15.069> but<00:03:15.190> you<00:03:15.280> just<00:03:15.430> need<00:03:15.579> a<00:03:15.610> little<00:03:15.940> bit

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
situation but you just need a little bit

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.449 
situation but you just need a little bit
of<00:03:16.239> flash<00:03:16.480> to<00:03:16.750> add<00:03:16.870> that<00:03:17.470> little<00:03:17.530> bit<00:03:17.829> of<00:03:18.010> pop

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
of flash to add that little bit of pop

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:20.849 
of flash to add that little bit of pop
in<00:03:18.730> your<00:03:18.850> picture<00:03:19.209> you<00:03:20.170> can<00:03:20.319> drop<00:03:20.500> it<00:03:20.680> down<00:03:20.709> to

settings<00:03:40.209> is<00:03:40.389> called<00:03:40.989> the<00:03:41.200> zoom<00:03:41.440> so<00:03:41.590> you're

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
settings is called the zoom so you're

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.500 
settings is called the zoom so you're
going<00:03:41.799> to<00:03:41.859> hold<00:03:41.980> down<00:03:42.130> your<00:03:42.160> zoom<00:03:42.519> now<00:03:43.329> how

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
going to hold down your zoom now how

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:48.140 
going to hold down your zoom now how
soon<00:03:44.019> works<00:03:45.389> X<00:03:46.389> I<00:03:46.660> just<00:03:46.690> put<00:03:46.989> it<00:03:47.079> to<00:03:47.230> slave<00:03:47.560> mode

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
soon works X I just put it to slave mode

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:54.000 
soon works X I just put it to slave mode
so<00:03:50.280> mode<00:03:51.280> and<00:03:51.669> zoom<00:03:52.299> so<00:03:53.260> you<00:03:53.319> just<00:03:53.470> hit<00:03:53.919> the

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
so mode and zoom so you just hit the

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.940 
so mode and zoom so you just hit the
zoom<00:03:54.160> button<00:03:54.400> once<00:03:54.609> um<00:03:55.200> so<00:03:56.200> the<00:03:56.530> way<00:03:56.620> zoom

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
zoom button once um so the way zoom

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.129 
zoom button once um so the way zoom
works<00:03:57.190> is<00:03:57.489> um<00:03:57.819> you're<00:03:58.720> going<00:03:58.840> to<00:03:58.900> start<00:03:59.079> off

00:03:59.129 --> 00:03:59.139 
works is um you're going to start off

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:01.050 
works is um you're going to start off
with<00:03:59.290> 24<00:03:59.709> millimeters<00:04:00.099> so<00:04:00.220> 24<00:04:00.579> millimeters

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
with 24 millimeters so 24 millimeters

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.250 
with 24 millimeters so 24 millimeters
means<00:04:01.269> that<00:04:01.510> it's<00:04:01.630> going<00:04:01.780> to<00:04:01.840> be<00:04:01.959> a<00:04:01.989> very

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
means that it's going to be a very

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:07.920 
means that it's going to be a very
widespread<00:04:03.750> flash<00:04:04.919> the<00:04:06.000> smaller<00:04:07.000> it<00:04:07.239> gets<00:04:07.480> so

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
widespread flash the smaller it gets so

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.050 
widespread flash the smaller it gets so
say<00:04:08.319> we<00:04:08.440> bring<00:04:08.590> it<00:04:08.709> all<00:04:08.829> the<00:04:08.859> way<00:04:08.919> up<00:04:08.980> to<00:04:09.220> say<00:04:09.519> 50

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
say we bring it all the way up to say 50

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.180 
say we bring it all the way up to say 50
it's<00:04:10.480> going<00:04:10.690> to<00:04:10.750> be<00:04:10.810> much<00:04:11.019> more<00:04:11.230> narrower<00:04:11.769> beam

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 
it's going to be much more narrower beam

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:14.129 
it's going to be much more narrower beam
so<00:04:12.370> the<00:04:12.459> best<00:04:12.609> way<00:04:12.730> we<00:04:12.849> really<00:04:13.060> explai<00:04:13.389> explain

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:14.139 
so the best way we really explai explain

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:16.529 
so the best way we really explai explain
is<00:04:14.260> the<00:04:14.349> smaller<00:04:14.620> number<00:04:14.739> like<00:04:15.099> 24<00:04:15.639> it's<00:04:16.359> going

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:16.539 
is the smaller number like 24 it's going

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:18.779 
is the smaller number like 24 it's going
to<00:04:16.599> it's<00:04:16.750> going<00:04:16.780> to<00:04:16.930> cover<00:04:17.139> a<00:04:17.289> wide<00:04:17.709> a<00:04:18.250> wide

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:18.789 
to it's going to cover a wide a wide

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:20.580 
to it's going to cover a wide a wide
spectrum<00:04:19.329> of<00:04:19.660> light<00:04:19.870> it's<00:04:20.049> going<00:04:20.200> to<00:04:20.260> shoot<00:04:20.500> it

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
spectrum of light it's going to shoot it

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.520 
spectrum of light it's going to shoot it
out<00:04:20.739> very<00:04:21.160> wide<00:04:21.459> these<00:04:22.180> bigger<00:04:22.990> these<00:04:23.200> numbers

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
out very wide these bigger these numbers

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.990 
out very wide these bigger these numbers
get<00:04:23.740> the

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 
get the

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.850 
get the
this<00:04:26.449> smaller<00:04:26.900> the<00:04:27.169> spectrum<00:04:27.560> of<00:04:27.620> lights

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
this smaller the spectrum of lights

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:28.899 
this smaller the spectrum of lights
going<00:04:27.949> to<00:04:28.069> be<00:04:28.189> so<00:04:28.400> it's<00:04:28.520> almost<00:04:28.669> going<00:04:28.819> to

00:04:28.899 --> 00:04:28.909 
going to be so it's almost going to

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:30.399 
going to be so it's almost going to
become<00:04:29.090> more<00:04:29.210> like<00:04:29.270> a<00:04:29.389> beam<00:04:29.689> almost<00:04:30.110> you<00:04:30.259> know

00:04:30.399 --> 00:04:30.409 
become more like a beam almost you know

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:31.869 
become more like a beam almost you know
so<00:04:30.860> if<00:04:30.979> you're<00:04:31.099> really<00:04:31.310> working<00:04:31.460> on<00:04:31.639> one

00:04:31.869 --> 00:04:31.879 
so if you're really working on one

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:33.670 
so if you're really working on one
subject<00:04:32.240> across<00:04:32.659> the<00:04:32.900> room<00:04:33.110> maybe<00:04:33.349> and<00:04:33.650> you

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
subject across the room maybe and you

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.409 
subject across the room maybe and you
don't<00:04:34.250> want<00:04:34.400> to<00:04:34.460> get<00:04:34.520> everybody<00:04:34.939> around<00:04:35.030> here

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:35.419 
don't want to get everybody around here

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:36.640 
don't want to get everybody around here
you<00:04:35.509> really<00:04:35.840> just<00:04:35.960> want<00:04:36.139> to<00:04:36.169> focus<00:04:36.289> on<00:04:36.530> that

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
you really just want to focus on that

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.850 
you really just want to focus on that
one<00:04:36.770> female<00:04:37.219> or<00:04:37.340> male<00:04:37.460> subject<00:04:38.530> then<00:04:39.530> you<00:04:39.740> know

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:39.860 
one female or male subject then you know

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:41.260 
one female or male subject then you know
you<00:04:39.919> might<00:04:40.099> want<00:04:40.340> to<00:04:40.370> drop<00:04:40.580> all<00:04:40.879> the<00:04:40.939> way<00:04:40.969> up<00:04:41.090> to

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.270 
you might want to drop all the way up to

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:44.230 
you might want to drop all the way up to
like<00:04:41.780> like<00:04:42.469> 105<00:04:42.889> that's<00:04:43.580> as<00:04:43.699> high<00:04:43.819> as<00:04:43.849> it<00:04:44.030> goes

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 
like like 105 that's as high as it goes

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.270 
like like 105 that's as high as it goes
and<00:04:44.569> it<00:04:44.689> will<00:04:44.840> suit<00:04:45.080> more<00:04:45.319> of<00:04:45.469> a<00:04:45.560> straight<00:04:45.979> beam

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:46.280 
and it will suit more of a straight beam

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.300 
and it will suit more of a straight beam
or<00:04:46.639> straight<00:04:47.000> ray<00:04:47.509> of<00:04:47.629> light<00:04:47.900> a<00:04:48.169> flash<00:04:49.099> of

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
or straight ray of light a flash of

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:51.640 
or straight ray of light a flash of
light<00:04:49.490> towards<00:04:49.759> that<00:04:50.000> individual<00:04:50.629> or<00:04:50.840> that

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
light towards that individual or that

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:54.459 
light towards that individual or that
item<00:04:52.580> that<00:04:52.699> you're<00:04:52.789> shooting<00:04:53.000> at<00:04:53.300> so<00:04:53.990> that's

00:04:54.459 --> 00:04:54.469 
item that you're shooting at so that's

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:59.050 
item that you're shooting at so that's
how<00:04:54.740> the<00:04:55.189> manual<00:04:55.699> settings<00:04:56.030> works<00:04:56.330> far<00:04:57.169> as<00:04:58.060> the

00:04:59.050 --> 00:04:59.060 
how the manual settings works far as the

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.600 
how the manual settings works far as the
430ex<00:04:59.690> -<00:04:59.870> so<00:05:00.110> you<00:05:00.409> got<00:05:00.590> your<00:05:00.860> when<00:05:01.340> you<00:05:01.430> pop<00:05:01.580> it

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:01.610 
430ex - so you got your when you pop it

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:03.369 
430ex - so you got your when you pop it
in<00:05:01.789> mail<00:05:01.909> you<00:05:02.090> can<00:05:02.270> control<00:05:02.599> how<00:05:02.930> much<00:05:03.110> flash

00:05:03.369 --> 00:05:03.379 
in mail you can control how much flash

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:06.129 
in mail you can control how much flash
is<00:05:03.560> put<00:05:03.740> out<00:05:03.889> and<00:05:04.129> you<00:05:04.580> can<00:05:04.729> control<00:05:05.060> how<00:05:05.840> wide

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:06.139 
is put out and you can control how wide

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:09.149 
is put out and you can control how wide
of<00:05:06.169> a<00:05:06.440> spectrum<00:05:07.009> your<00:05:07.280> light<00:05:07.490> puts<00:05:07.789> out<00:05:07.969> when

00:05:09.149 --> 00:05:09.159 
of a spectrum your light puts out when

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:11.830 
of a spectrum your light puts out when
you<00:05:10.159> know<00:05:10.250> at<00:05:10.460> how<00:05:10.969> much<00:05:11.210> you're<00:05:11.389> trying<00:05:11.629> to<00:05:11.719> do

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:11.840 
you know at how much you're trying to do

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:14.320 
you know at how much you're trying to do
and<00:05:12.409> then<00:05:12.530> if<00:05:12.620> you<00:05:12.710> hold<00:05:12.919> it<00:05:13.039> down<00:05:13.250> down<00:05:14.000> zoom

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:14.330 
and then if you hold it down down zoom

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:17.019 
and then if you hold it down down zoom
for<00:05:14.599> a<00:05:14.629> second<00:05:15.159> this<00:05:16.159> puts<00:05:16.520> you<00:05:16.610> into<00:05:16.729> slave

00:05:17.019 --> 00:05:17.029 
for a second this puts you into slave

00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:19.510 
for a second this puts you into slave
mode<00:05:17.360> so<00:05:17.690> if<00:05:17.779> you<00:05:17.870> have<00:05:18.020> a<00:05:18.050> 580<00:05:18.590> you<00:05:19.190> can<00:05:19.370> use

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 
mode so if you have a 580 you can use

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.100 
mode so if you have a 580 you can use
this<00:05:19.639> as<00:05:19.879> a<00:05:19.909> slave<00:05:20.270> so<00:05:20.509> when<00:05:20.659> you<00:05:20.719> shoot<00:05:20.960> the

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.110 
this as a slave so when you shoot the

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:23.290 
this as a slave so when you shoot the
580<00:05:21.500> off<00:05:21.680> the<00:05:21.860> top<00:05:22.039> of<00:05:22.159> your<00:05:22.219> camera<00:05:22.430> these

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:23.300 
580 off the top of your camera these

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:41.360 
which I don't ever use and I tell you

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:42.670 
which I don't ever use and I tell you
the<00:05:41.449> truth<00:05:41.659> I'm<00:05:41.870> believing<00:05:42.229> what's<00:05:42.409> not<00:05:42.500> to

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:42.680 
the truth I'm believing what's not to

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:43.990 
the truth I'm believing what's not to
read<00:05:42.800> off<00:05:42.889> the<00:05:43.009> manual<00:05:43.279> to<00:05:43.400> explain<00:05:43.759> how<00:05:43.879> this

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:44.000 
read off the manual to explain how this

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.350 
read off the manual to explain how this
works<00:05:44.180> because<00:05:44.330> I<00:05:44.509> do<00:05:44.569> not<00:05:44.839> use<00:05:45.050> this<00:05:45.229> is<00:05:45.440> is

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:46.360 
works because I do not use this is is

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.240 
works because I do not use this is is
you<00:05:47.360> have<00:05:47.419> these<00:05:47.629> two<00:05:47.690> two<00:05:48.409> things<00:05:48.680> here<00:05:49.039> and

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:49.250 
you have these two two things here and

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:50.980 
you have these two two things here and
one<00:05:49.490> of<00:05:49.610> them<00:05:49.699> helps<00:05:49.969> with<00:05:50.180> shutter<00:05:50.810> priority

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:50.990 
one of them helps with shutter priority

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:55.089 
one of them helps with shutter priority
and<00:05:51.620> the<00:05:52.039> other<00:05:52.190> one<00:05:52.400> has<00:05:52.639> to<00:05:52.669> do<00:05:53.029> with<00:05:53.900> a<00:05:54.229> the

00:05:55.089 --> 00:05:55.099 
and the other one has to do with a the

00:05:55.099 --> 00:05:57.129 
and the other one has to do with a the
flash<00:05:55.310> will<00:05:55.520> go<00:05:55.580> off<00:05:55.669> right<00:05:55.940> before<00:05:56.150> your<00:05:56.779> your

00:05:57.129 --> 00:05:57.139 
flash will go off right before your your

00:05:57.139 --> 00:05:59.469 
flash will go off right before your your
shutter<00:05:57.440> clicks<00:05:57.949> and<00:05:58.159> takes<00:05:58.339> a<00:05:58.460> picture<00:05:58.639> so<00:05:59.330> it

00:05:59.469 --> 00:05:59.479 
shutter clicks and takes a picture so it

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:00.760 
shutter clicks and takes a picture so it
gives<00:05:59.659> like<00:05:59.810> a<00:05:59.839> weird<00:06:00.110> light<00:06:00.289> which<00:06:00.500> is<00:06:00.620> really

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:00.770 
gives like a weird light which is really

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:02.409 
gives like a weird light which is really
used<00:06:01.039> for<00:06:01.250> like<00:06:01.400> low<00:06:01.669> shutter<00:06:01.909> speeds<00:06:02.240> when

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:02.419 
used for like low shutter speeds when

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:04.839 
used for like low shutter speeds when
like<00:06:02.539> you're<00:06:02.690> got<00:06:02.870> it<00:06:02.990> in<00:06:03.080> bulb<00:06:03.289> or<00:06:03.529> like<00:06:03.919> 30th

00:06:04.839 --> 00:06:04.849 
like you're got it in bulb or like 30th

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:07.809 
like you're got it in bulb or like 30th
of<00:06:05.029> a<00:06:05.150> second<00:06:05.569> or<00:06:05.979> 25<00:06:06.979> seconds<00:06:07.520> so<00:06:07.610> you<00:06:07.699> got

00:06:07.809 --> 00:06:07.819 
of a second or 25 seconds so you got

00:06:07.819 --> 00:06:09.070 
of a second or 25 seconds so you got
your<00:06:07.940> shutter<00:06:08.120> speed<00:06:08.180> open<00:06:08.629> and<00:06:08.779> it<00:06:08.870> kind<00:06:09.050> of

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:09.080 
your shutter speed open and it kind of

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:11.519 
your shutter speed open and it kind of
just<00:06:09.199> puts<00:06:09.440> out<00:06:09.560> a<00:06:09.589> ray<00:06:10.009> of<00:06:10.039> light<00:06:10.159> real<00:06:10.490> quick

00:06:11.519 --> 00:06:11.529 
just puts out a ray of light real quick

00:06:11.529 --> 00:06:15.339 
just puts out a ray of light real quick
so<00:06:12.529> that's<00:06:13.339> so<00:06:13.819> the<00:06:13.879> first<00:06:14.089> one<00:06:14.270> is<00:06:14.300> has<00:06:15.139> to<00:06:15.289> a

00:06:15.339 --> 00:06:15.349 
so that's so the first one is has to a

00:06:15.349 --> 00:06:19.689 
so that's so the first one is has to a
shutter<00:06:15.560> priority<00:06:16.870> and<00:06:17.949> I<00:06:18.949> really<00:06:19.430> don't<00:06:19.610> know

00:06:19.689 --> 00:06:19.699 
shutter priority and I really don't know

00:06:19.699 --> 00:06:21.010 
shutter priority and I really don't know
a<00:06:19.729> lot<00:06:19.849> about<00:06:19.909> that<00:06:20.300> tell<00:06:20.509> you<00:06:20.599> the<00:06:20.659> truth<00:06:20.839> I'm

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:21.020 
a lot about that tell you the truth I'm

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:23.019 
a lot about that tell you the truth I'm
not<00:06:21.050> going<00:06:21.319> to<00:06:21.379> lie<00:06:21.560> and<00:06:21.800> then<00:06:22.219> the<00:06:22.550> second<00:06:22.940> one

00:06:23.019 --> 00:06:23.029 
not going to lie and then the second one

00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:24.459 
not going to lie and then the second one
I<00:06:23.060> believe<00:06:23.270> has<00:06:23.419> to<00:06:23.449> do<00:06:23.629> with<00:06:23.719> the<00:06:23.870> what<00:06:24.169> the

00:06:24.459 --> 00:06:24.469 
I believe has to do with the what the

00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:25.839 
I believe has to do with the what the
flash<00:06:24.680> will<00:06:24.889> go<00:06:24.979> off<00:06:25.069> right<00:06:25.430> before<00:06:25.729> your

00:06:25.839 --> 00:06:25.849 
flash will go off right before your

00:06:25.849 --> 00:06:27.939 
flash will go off right before your
shutter<00:06:26.120> clicks<00:06:26.509> so<00:06:27.229> if<00:06:27.349> you're<00:06:27.469> doing<00:06:27.620> a<00:06:27.770> long

00:06:27.939 --> 00:06:27.949 
shutter clicks so if you're doing a long

00:06:27.949 --> 00:06:30.189 
shutter clicks so if you're doing a long
exposure<00:06:28.339> times<00:06:28.759> this<00:06:29.389> may<00:06:29.599> be<00:06:29.659> nice<00:06:29.930> to<00:06:30.080> go

00:06:30.189 --> 00:06:30.199 
exposure times this may be nice to go

00:06:30.199 --> 00:06:32.170 
exposure times this may be nice to go
just<00:06:30.409> a<00:06:30.440> little<00:06:30.710> bit<00:06:30.830> of<00:06:30.889> light<00:06:31.069> to<00:06:31.310> get<00:06:31.460> to<00:06:32.060> get

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:32.180 
just a little bit of light to get to get

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:33.519 
just a little bit of light to get to get
that<00:06:32.330> picture<00:06:32.539> that<00:06:32.659> you're<00:06:32.870> looking<00:06:33.110> for<00:06:33.319> the

00:06:33.519 --> 00:06:33.529 
that picture that you're looking for the

00:06:33.529 --> 00:06:35.800 
that picture that you're looking for the
long<00:06:33.649> exposure<00:06:33.949> times<00:06:34.509> anyways<00:06:35.509> this<00:06:35.659> is

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:35.810 
long exposure times anyways this is

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:38.650 
long exposure times anyways this is
