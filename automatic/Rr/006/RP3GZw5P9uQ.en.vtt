00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
be coming out on the sixteenth of the

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.250 
be coming out on the sixteenth of the
18th<00:00:35.760> of<00:00:35.940> April<00:00:36.239> again<00:00:36.450> it's<00:00:36.600> not<00:00:36.780> too<00:00:36.989> clear

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
18th of April again it's not too clear

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.049 
18th of April again it's not too clear
because<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.710> camera<00:00:38.010> lights<00:00:38.190> on<00:00:38.370> this<00:00:38.820> image

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
because the camera lights on this image

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.090 
because the camera lights on this image
actually<00:00:39.510> shines<00:00:40.050> on<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.379> date<00:00:40.649> so<00:00:40.800> I<00:00:40.829> think

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
actually shines on the date so I think

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.500 
actually shines on the date so I think
it's<00:00:41.219> a<00:00:41.309> sixteenth<00:00:41.790> because<00:00:42.120> that<00:00:42.239> will<00:00:42.360> be<00:00:42.480> a

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
it's a sixteenth because that will be a

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.240 
it's a sixteenth because that will be a
Tuesday<00:00:43.079> we've<00:00:43.440> got<00:00:43.620> four<00:00:43.890> new<00:00:43.920> multiplayer

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
dead now vertigo we could see a

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.380 
dead now vertigo we could see a
helicopter<00:00:59.250> pad<00:00:59.430> maybe<00:00:59.730> it's<00:00:59.910> on<00:01:00.030> top<00:01:00.239> of<00:01:00.270> a

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
helicopter pad maybe it's on top of a

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.479 
helicopter pad maybe it's on top of a
building<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:00.930> core<00:01:01.680> i'm<00:01:01.829> not<00:01:02.010> actually<00:01:02.160> too

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
building and core i'm not actually too

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.700 
building and core i'm not actually too
sure<00:01:02.730> what<00:01:02.940> that<00:01:02.969> is<00:01:03.090> mag<00:01:04.080> mell<00:01:04.290> looks<00:01:04.470> to<00:01:04.619> be

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
sure what that is mag mell looks to be

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.380 
sure what that is mag mell looks to be
like<00:01:04.739> a<00:01:04.920> town<00:01:05.250> on<00:01:05.460> fire<00:01:05.700> in<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.000> back<00:01:06.150> there<00:01:06.360> i

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
like a town on fire in the back there i

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.450 
like a town on fire in the back there i
think<00:01:06.689> i<00:01:06.810> can<00:01:06.960> see<00:01:07.110> a<00:01:07.140> volcano<00:01:07.650> that's<00:01:07.890> erupted

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
think i can see a volcano that's erupted

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.280 
think i can see a volcano that's erupted
and<00:01:08.610> all<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.119> volcano<00:01:09.600> will<00:01:09.869> be<00:01:09.990> lava

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
and all the volcano will be lava

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.620 
and all the volcano will be lava
actually<00:01:11.189> looks<00:01:11.430> to<00:01:11.580> be<00:01:11.700> flowing<00:01:12.270> into<00:01:12.420> the

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
actually looks to be flowing into the

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:13.789 
actually looks to be flowing into the
town<00:01:12.840> so<00:01:12.990> again<00:01:13.200> that<00:01:13.350> could<00:01:13.500> be<00:01:13.590> another

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
town so again that could be another

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.679 
town so again that could be another
interactive<00:01:14.490> map<00:01:14.700> you<00:01:14.820> know<00:01:14.939> like<00:01:15.119> haja<00:01:15.570> we

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
interactive map you know like haja we

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.600 
interactive map you know like haja we
have<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.900> water<00:01:16.110> running<00:01:16.530> at<00:01:16.650> times<00:01:16.920> could<00:01:17.520> be

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
have the water running at times could be

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.670 
have the water running at times could be
similar<00:01:17.970> with<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.390> lava<00:01:18.630> and<00:01:18.930> then<00:01:19.049> we've<00:01:19.650> got

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
similar with the lava and then we've got

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.499 
similar with the lava and then we've got
studio<00:01:20.280> which<00:01:20.460> is<00:01:20.610> to<00:01:20.729> find<00:01:20.970> a<00:01:21.090> multiplayer

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
studio which is to find a multiplayer

psyche has red eyes now I'm not too sure

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:12.860 
psyche has red eyes now I'm not too sure
because<00:02:11.879> the<00:02:12.060> zombies<00:02:12.360> are<00:02:12.390> supposed<00:02:12.660> to<00:02:12.720> have

because the zombies are supposed to have
blue<00:02:13.170> eyes<00:02:13.200> maybe

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
blue eyes maybe

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.230 
blue eyes maybe
some<00:02:14.069> you<00:02:14.220> all<00:02:14.340> we<00:02:14.459> knew<00:02:14.610> that<00:02:14.760> he<00:02:14.849> was<00:02:14.970> kind<00:02:15.180> of

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
some you all we knew that he was kind of

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.059 
some you all we knew that he was kind of
turning<00:02:15.630> evil<00:02:15.750> or<00:02:16.080> maybe<00:02:16.530> he<00:02:16.680> was<00:02:16.709> turning

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
turning evil or maybe he was turning

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.250 
turning evil or maybe he was turning
into<00:02:17.400> a<00:02:17.430> zombie<00:02:17.520> and<00:02:17.970> dire<00:02:18.540> eyes<00:02:18.750> because<00:02:19.110> of

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
into a zombie and dire eyes because of

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.720 
into a zombie and dire eyes because of
the<00:02:19.349> sounds<00:02:19.709> that<00:02:19.739> we<00:02:19.920> heard<00:02:20.099> and<00:02:20.310> he<00:02:20.370> said<00:02:20.550> and

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
the sounds that we heard and he said and

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.940 
the sounds that we heard and he said and
from<00:02:20.880> the<00:02:21.000> court<00:02:21.209> scene<00:02:21.420> so<00:02:21.989> maybe<00:02:22.260> Samuel<00:02:22.830> is

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
from the court scene so maybe Samuel is

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.740 
from the court scene so maybe Samuel is
now<00:02:23.130> in<00:02:23.370> charge<00:02:23.400> of<00:02:23.880> the<00:02:24.030> zombies<00:02:24.390> you<00:02:24.510> know<00:02:24.630> or

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
now in charge of the zombies you know or

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.690 
now in charge of the zombies you know or
maybe<00:02:24.989> it's<00:02:25.200> just<00:02:25.260> a<00:02:25.440> little<00:02:25.650> photoshop<00:02:26.069> area

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
maybe it's just a little photoshop area

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.699 
maybe it's just a little photoshop area
but<00:02:26.849> however<00:02:27.060> this<00:02:27.720> zombie<00:02:28.110> to<00:02:28.230> me<00:02:28.380> looks<00:02:28.590> like

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
but however this zombie to me looks like

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.770 
but however this zombie to me looks like
he<00:02:28.950> has<00:02:29.099> red<00:02:29.400> eyes<00:02:29.550> I'm<00:02:29.910> not<00:02:30.060> too<00:02:30.239> sure<00:02:30.540> why

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
he has red eyes I'm not too sure why

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.690 
he has red eyes I'm not too sure why
maybe<00:02:31.380> they<00:02:31.530> still<00:02:31.800> blue<00:02:32.010> I'm<00:02:32.160> not<00:02:32.340> too<00:02:32.489> sure

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
maybe they still blue I'm not too sure

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.400 
maybe they still blue I'm not too sure
maybe<00:02:32.940> it's<00:02:33.209> just<00:02:33.239> the<00:02:33.450> Photoshop<00:02:33.959> area<00:02:34.230> like

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
maybe it's just the Photoshop area like

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:35.990 
maybe it's just the Photoshop area like
I've<00:02:34.560> already<00:02:34.709> said<00:02:35.040> now<00:02:35.489> if<00:02:35.580> you<00:02:35.670> go<00:02:35.790> ahead
