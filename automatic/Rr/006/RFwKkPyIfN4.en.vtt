there's also an option for the S lock to
video<00:01:48.119> profile<00:01:48.630> that<00:01:49.289> gives<00:01:49.590> you<00:01:49.770> that<00:01:49.950> flat

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
video profile that gives you that flat

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.760 
video profile that gives you that flat
look<00:01:50.640> that<00:01:50.970> you<00:01:51.090> can<00:01:51.380> edit<00:01:52.380> the

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
post-processing later on one of the

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.680 
post-processing later on one of the
things<00:01:56.009> that's<00:01:56.220> missing<00:01:56.670> from<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.210> camera<00:01:57.539> is

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:57.690 
things that's missing from the camera is

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:00.529 
things that's missing from the camera is
actually<00:01:57.869> Thai<00:01:58.289> screen<00:01:58.910> I'm<00:01:59.910> not<00:02:00.180> sure<00:02:00.390> how

00:02:00.529 --> 00:02:00.539 
actually Thai screen I'm not sure how

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:03.080 
actually Thai screen I'm not sure how
hard<00:02:00.840> was<00:02:01.020> to<00:02:01.229> implement<00:02:01.470> but<00:02:01.920> it<00:02:02.670> seems<00:02:02.910> like

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
hard was to implement but it seems like

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.359 
hard was to implement but it seems like
all<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.420> cameras<00:02:03.780> have<00:02:03.960> it<00:02:04.110> now<00:02:04.259> and<00:02:04.590> Sonia

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
all the cameras have it now and Sonia

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.180 
all the cameras have it now and Sonia
was<00:02:05.520> in<00:02:05.810> front<00:02:06.810> I'm<00:02:07.470> leading<00:02:07.830> the<00:02:07.950> pack<00:02:08.160> with

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
was in front I'm leading the pack with

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.490 
was in front I'm leading the pack with
the<00:02:08.399> touch<00:02:08.670> screen<00:02:08.700> and<00:02:09.299> this<00:02:10.019> camera<00:02:10.260> for

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
the touch screen and this camera for

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.289 
the touch screen and this camera for
some<00:02:10.649> reason<00:02:10.950> doesn't<00:02:11.220> happen<00:02:11.310> but<00:02:11.910> it<00:02:12.060> still

00:02:12.289 --> 00:02:12.299 
some reason doesn't happen but it still

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:15.620 
some reason doesn't happen but it still
has<00:02:12.450> this<00:02:12.630> the<00:02:13.080> same<00:02:13.290> tilt<00:02:13.620> as<00:02:14.310> the<00:02:15.209> previous

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
has this the same tilt as the previous

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.850 
has this the same tilt as the previous
mark<00:02:16.140> 1/2<00:02:17.360> so<00:02:18.360> you<00:02:18.450> can<00:02:18.630> still<00:02:18.900> shoot<00:02:19.170> from

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
mark 1/2 so you can still shoot from

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:26.050 
mark 1/2 so you can still shoot from
below<00:02:21.500> and<00:02:22.500> still<00:02:22.890> shoot<00:02:23.310> from<00:02:23.790> up<00:02:24.090> high

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
below and still shoot from up high

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.670 
below and still shoot from up high
it<00:02:27.060> seems<00:02:27.330> that<00:02:27.480> a<00:02:27.540> lot<00:02:27.690> of<00:02:27.989> people<00:02:28.410> are<00:02:28.560> now

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
it seems that a lot of people are now

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.180 
it seems that a lot of people are now
jumping<00:02:28.980> from<00:02:29.910> DSLRs<00:02:30.540> so<00:02:30.900> nervous<00:02:31.739> cameras

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
jumping from DSLRs so nervous cameras

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.979 
jumping from DSLRs so nervous cameras
and<00:02:32.430> it<00:02:32.549> looks<00:02:32.700> like<00:02:32.760> Sony<00:02:33.120> is<00:02:33.329> now<00:02:33.480> targeting

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
and it looks like Sony is now targeting

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:37.130 
and it looks like Sony is now targeting
those<00:02:34.200> people<00:02:34.850> specifically<00:02:35.850> this<00:02:36.660> camera

it's a little bulky a little heavier it

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:47.900 
it's a little bulky a little heavier it
shoots<00:02:44.280> 5<00:02:44.610> frames<00:02:44.910> per<00:02:45.120> second<00:02:46.820> there's<00:02:47.820> no
