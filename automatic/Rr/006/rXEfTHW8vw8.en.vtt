00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:18.750
 the clinic is widely used for control 

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:18.750
 of doping 

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:29.260
 James is the way we have to try. 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.990
 to detect the presence of substances 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:33.969
 forbidden in the body of athletes 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.789
 they are obviously forbidden first 

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:39.339
 because it could lead to an increase in 

00:00:36.789 --> 00:00:42.489
 performance of the athlete without being 

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:44.229
 thing of his nature but I also think 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:45.789
 that perhaps mainly because the 

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:48.399
 majority of these substances 

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:50.829
 causes an injury to athlete's health 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:52.839
 so when doing the doping control 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:55.299
 you are also preserving the health 

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:57.489
 in this athlete who is trying to improve 

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:59.379
 their performance by that means which is 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:02.319
 the doping control in the 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:04.799
 Brazil it is done through a network 

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:07.390
 sample collection that is 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.710
 responsibility of federations and 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.750
 confederations 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.300
 these samples are then forwarded to the 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.100
 our laboratory and is the laboratory of 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:18.250
 doping control of the institute of 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:20.560
 ufrj chemistry that is believed by the 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.450
 world anti-doping agency to do 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.360
 this type of laboratory work 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:29.050
 receive this sample coded it by 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:31.240
 In your turn remember stay and then try 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:33.100
 this shows in the analysis equipment 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.800
 chemistry that are those of last 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.660
 generation dot lab paper 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.970
 from the view of the analysis then it is 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:43.480
 approach the universe of more or less 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:46.270
 500 different substances and which 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:49.150
 part of a maybe 15 as we call 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.610
 pharmacological classes other than 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:53.860
 substances have different ways of 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.930
 act in the body but known perhaps 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.220
 without the anabolic ones 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.470
 substances that increase the 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:02.070
 and therefore it is important that the 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:04.450
 sports that require even strength 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.860
 performance from the point of view of 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.649
 physical ability 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:11.050
 then these 15 different classes have 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:13.959
 to be analyzed and therefore you 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:16.109
 need to have equipment capable of 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:18.609
 check the presence of molecules 

00:02:16.109 --> 00:02:19.960
 completely different from one another 

00:02:18.609 --> 00:02:22.240
 and this is a great challenge 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:25.060
 and what chemistry has to do 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:28.270
 perform good clear precise control 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:31.120
 of an athlete show and the show today 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.230
 even better to be withdrawn from the athlete is 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.300
 urine 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:37.060
 first because it's easier not less 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:40.150
 invasive of you to remove this death but 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:43.600
 mainly because in the urine our 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:46.660
 Discreet organism as deigned releases 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:49.480
 all those molecules it contains 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:52.210
 that even that taurine dopant is 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:56.620
 a concentrate of prohibited substances 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:58.690
 if the athlete did it today 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.690
 account of some molecules that do not 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:04.420
 they can get out across the river to 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:06.850
 urine are trapped inside the urine. 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.490
 bloodstream also have 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:10.900
 increasingly used as a 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:13.360
 we call a matrix is a 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:16.000
 material to be analyzed for control 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:19.000
 Then, to you, who has some 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.670
 interest in chemistry and in the organism is 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.740
 important to remember is that the 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.980
 organism is made of molecules and 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:28.810
 therefore all the substance that is made 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.850
 of molecules so you enter 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.880
 your body will affect your 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:35.830
 and I think today is the great 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.230
 problem that we live that almost a 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:40.870
 public health problem is the abuse of 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:43.540
 anabolic in the academies but today we 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:46.000
 we know that the risk of abuse of these 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:49.510
 anabolic in the gym is devastating and 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.280
 diminishes the person's life and causes 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.890
 a series of collateral problems then 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.350
 the recommendation is that chemistry is 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:58.380
 excellent is fantastic but the bad use of the 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:00.910
 chemistry can cause irreparable damage 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:03.670
 both the environment and you 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:09.180
 see the own individual who has just 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:09.180
 consuming medicines improperly
