00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:07.710
 already fill it with color as we see 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.860
 occupy more colors also occupy the green 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:14.119
 which is for 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:16.219
 woven and the stamen the blue the blue and 

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:19.160
 the blues that we mix to make this 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:21.860
 blue occupy here the dark blue and here the 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:24.579
 excel clarito that he had taught them ok 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:28.309
 here I mixed it here I put it red orange 

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:29.570
 and the needles I do not know if it shows and if it 

00:00:28.309 --> 00:00:35.600
 more note 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:37.129
 ok occupy this metallic color ok 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.559
 if I'm not giving them too 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:41.149
 absolutely all the tones is because 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:44.800
 as I told them anyway we are going to 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:47.379
 be playing with the 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:52.150
 with the tones right now to make clear 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:54.670
 and dark to give it the effect 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:58.210
 from my painting that I have done 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:01.329
 you can start painting in paint 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:03.609
 you could make drawings without getting clear 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:05.920
 and dark in what you get confidence 

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:09.430
 but getting it clear and dark does not have 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:11.020
 really the least science you relax and 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:14.369
 enjoy the work ok 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:17.649
 well here since I put all the color 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.990
 since it stayed like this what I'm going to do is 

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:23.100
 that I'm going to delineate aha 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.100
 here I have my black 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:30.320
 this is also from another brand as you see 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:33.530
 it's black, it does not have any number ok 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:36.350
 well I'll put 17 on the web you 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:41.420
 I'm going to put black in bone outline it 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:44.390
 so to delimit the wings 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.920
 monocytes looks at you I teach forgiveness I know 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.680
 that you tide them to do this 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.400
 but if not how I explain it to you because 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:55.850
 then I will outline everything that 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:59.030
 obviously corresponds to below the 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:02.030
 absolutely everything that the 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.950
 monocytes because if I do it before 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.020
 then I will not have it clear in 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.750
 where does each shadow go? 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.260
 shadows go under the arms below 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:14.110
 of the tissue 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.480
 now here if you notice the incidence of 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.970
 light seems to come from below towards 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:22.269
 up because all the lights are on 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:25.000
 underneath if you notice and the shadows go 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:27.310
 like up but is with this 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.260
 mind is weird like that already seeing it well 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.690
 because it seems that it has incidence of 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.610
 light down and light incidence comes 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.959
 above then good me 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.670
 honestly I'm going to put the 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:41.610
 incidence of light from top to bottom 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.680
 so that the little heads and the parts of 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.170
 above the arms are the illuminated ones 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.930
 and obviously the shadows fall on what 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.120
 what is the tummy ok ok then 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:54.480
 high as I tell you I'm going to outline it with 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:57.030
 a super thin and black brush all 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:00.660
 the shore all the contours line up 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:03.410
 well what are the knitting needles 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:06.019
 tissues the little arms all the details 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:09.150
 So then I already have everything 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:12.709
 perfectly well delimited we can 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:15.780
 proceed to place the shadows something else 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:18.239
 here I'm going to handle the technique of 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:22.300
 place the lights and shadows dry 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:24.820
 that is, the painting that I already apply 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.470
 It is practically dry and as 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:28.710
 I'm still going to outline it, it's going to be 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:31.900
 perfectly dry if you want 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:34.510
 apply lights and shadows with the fabric 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:37.000
 wet is to say when you finish painting 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.650
 then you would go a hen and in this 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.800
 moment to create the lights and shadows 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:43.750
 the other hen and create the lights and 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:45.820
 the shadows that then paint 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.890
 it's still cool that this is 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:50.140
 usually what they teach but you know 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:51.970
 that I am quite rebellious and then 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:55.300
 the truth is that I like to go 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:57.340
 advancing ok then what I do is 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:00.610
 that later to apply the lights and 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:03.760
 the shadows I lowered a little obviously 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:06.280
 do not bottle a little paint aside 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:09.510
 from there then I already drag and 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.510
 create my effects 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:14.609
 if in any case in another video too 

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:17.130
 of those in this serial of paint on canvas 

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:20.850
 that has taught us to teach you 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:23.310
 Dragging painting and so on 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:25.770
 any way in this video right now 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.930
 nothing else that delineates you comics so that 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:31.610
 let's see together how to drag lights and 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:31.610
 higher shadows I see
