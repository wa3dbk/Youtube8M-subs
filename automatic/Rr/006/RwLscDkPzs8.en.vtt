looks really really good and I've tried

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.759 
looks really really good and I've tried
this<00:02:51.239> in<00:02:51.480> form<00:02:51.780> and<00:02:51.840> he<00:02:51.989> actually<00:02:52.290> felt<00:02:52.709> really

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
this in form and he actually felt really

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:54.830 
this in form and he actually felt really
good<00:02:53.159> for<00:02:53.310> his<00:02:53.430> price<00:02:53.639> so<00:02:54.299> I'm<00:02:54.389> not<00:02:54.540> exactly

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
good for his price so I'm not exactly

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.030 
good for his price so I'm not exactly
sure<00:02:55.260> how<00:02:55.650> much<00:02:55.769> he<00:02:56.010> will<00:02:56.459> be<00:02:56.609> going<00:02:56.790> for<00:02:57.150> but

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
sure how much he will be going for but

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.229 
sure how much he will be going for but
considering<00:02:59.040> how<00:02:59.190> much<00:02:59.340> his<00:02:59.519> informs<00:02:59.970> going

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
considering how much his informs going

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:01.750 
considering how much his informs going
for<00:03:00.420> which<00:03:00.540> is<00:03:00.690> around<00:03:00.870> the<00:03:01.109> squad<00:03:01.379> price

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
for which is around the squad price

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.059 
for which is around the squad price
Pedro<00:03:02.760> he<00:03:02.909> won't<00:03:03.090> go<00:03:03.180> for<00:03:03.629> but<00:03:03.870> yet<00:03:04.500> his

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
Pedro he won't go for but yet his

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:07.250 
Pedro he won't go for but yet his
inform<00:03:05.459> goes<00:03:05.639> for<00:03:05.849> underscored<00:03:06.450> price<00:03:06.690> so<00:03:07.019> I'm

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
inform goes for underscored price so I'm

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.619 
inform goes for underscored price so I'm
actually<00:03:07.530> hoping<00:03:08.069> that<00:03:08.400> he<00:03:08.519> goes<00:03:08.670> around<00:03:08.909> 50k

00:03:09.619 --> 00:03:09.629 
actually hoping that he goes around 50k

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:11.990 
actually hoping that he goes around 50k
maybe<00:03:09.900> maybe<00:03:10.769> I'm<00:03:10.980> being<00:03:11.099> a<00:03:11.280> bit<00:03:11.400> too<00:03:11.430> hopeful

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
maybe maybe I'm being a bit too hopeful

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.190
