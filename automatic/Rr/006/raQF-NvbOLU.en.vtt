driving<00:00:01.020> in<00:00:01.260> Africa<00:00:01.770> is<00:00:02.210> challenging<00:00:03.210> on<00:00:03.330> a

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:03.360 
driving in Africa is challenging on a

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.539 
driving in Africa is challenging on a
couple<00:00:03.720> of<00:00:03.780> levels<00:00:03.959> the<00:00:04.350> most<00:00:05.130> obvious

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
couple of levels the most obvious

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:07.220 
couple of levels the most obvious
difference<00:00:05.940> is<00:00:06.120> that<00:00:06.330> the<00:00:06.450> steering<00:00:06.810> wheel<00:00:06.960> is

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
difference is that the steering wheel is

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.080 
difference is that the steering wheel is
on<00:00:07.379> the<00:00:07.529> opposite<00:00:08.010> side<00:00:08.220> of<00:00:08.460> the<00:00:08.610> car<00:00:08.820> and<00:00:09.030> you

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
on the opposite side of the car and you

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.240 
on the opposite side of the car and you
drive<00:00:09.929> on<00:00:10.170> the<00:00:10.290> opposite<00:00:10.650> side<00:00:10.830> of<00:00:10.860> the<00:00:11.070> road

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
drive on the opposite side of the road

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.419 
drive on the opposite side of the road
from<00:00:11.820> in<00:00:12.120> the<00:00:12.360> states<00:00:12.630> so<00:00:13.429> immediately

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
from in the states so immediately

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.129 
from in the states so immediately
everything<00:00:14.880> is<00:00:15.120> kind<00:00:15.299> of<00:00:15.360> disorienting<00:00:16.049> at

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
everything is kind of disorienting at

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.769 
everything is kind of disorienting at
first<00:00:16.350> and<00:00:16.619> the<00:00:17.340> traffic<00:00:17.970> doesn't<00:00:18.359> do<00:00:18.630> what

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
first and the traffic doesn't do what

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.840 
first and the traffic doesn't do what
you<00:00:18.869> expect<00:00:18.990> when<00:00:19.619> you're<00:00:19.740> turning<00:00:19.949> right<00:00:20.640> you

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
you expect when you're turning right you

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.189 
you expect when you're turning right you
have<00:00:20.970> to<00:00:21.060> cross<00:00:21.270> the<00:00:21.390> lane<00:00:21.539> of<00:00:21.660> traffic<00:00:21.869> when

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
have to cross the lane of traffic when

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:23.750 
have to cross the lane of traffic when
you<00:00:22.289> turn<00:00:22.470> left<00:00:22.650> you're<00:00:22.980> you're<00:00:23.340> just<00:00:23.519> pulling

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
you turn left you're you're just pulling

do a roundabout which is called a key B

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.700 
do a roundabout which is called a key B
lefty<00:00:29.099> here<00:00:29.460> you<00:00:30.359> you<00:00:31.019> have<00:00:31.140> traffic<00:00:31.500> merging

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
lefty here you you have traffic merging

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.799 
lefty here you you have traffic merging
in<00:00:31.980> from<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.309> left-hand<00:00:32.700> side<00:00:32.969> and<00:00:33.300> you're

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
in from the left-hand side and you're

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.810 
in from the left-hand side and you're
exiting<00:00:34.380> from<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.649> left<00:00:34.890> so<00:00:35.489> it's<00:00:35.610> backwards

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
exiting from the left so it's backwards

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
you can't be a defensive driver here at

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.160 
you can't be a defensive driver here at
least<00:00:53.579> in<00:00:53.760> this<00:00:53.850> part<00:00:54.090> of<00:00:54.149> Africa<00:00:54.239> if<00:00:54.870> you're

driving defensively you would have to

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.250 
driving defensively you would have to
just<00:00:57.300> park<00:00:57.510> your<00:00:57.629> car<00:00:57.780> and<00:00:57.870> shut<00:00:58.050> it<00:00:58.140> off

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
whole time we've been here I've been

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.620 
whole time we've been here I've been
driving<00:01:31.530> where<00:01:31.740> we're<00:01:31.979> borrowing<00:01:32.630> ppt

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
driving where we're borrowing ppt

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.140 
driving where we're borrowing ppt
vehicles<00:01:34.170> and<00:01:34.470> this<00:01:35.100> is<00:01:35.220> Emily's<00:01:35.610> first<00:01:35.909> time

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
vehicles and this is Emily's first time

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.210 
vehicles and this is Emily's first time
behind<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.229> wheel<00:01:37.290> so<00:01:37.650> let's<00:01:37.890> see<00:01:38.009> how<00:01:38.130> it

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
behind the wheel so let's see how it

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:38.569 
behind the wheel so let's see how it
goes

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
goes

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.380 
goes
turn<00:01:39.570> signal<00:01:39.930> is<00:01:40.110> also<00:01:40.409> on<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.680> run

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
turn signal is also on the run

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.719 
turn signal is also on the run
so<00:01:41.600> if<00:01:42.050> I<00:01:42.200> hit<00:01:42.500> the<00:01:42.800> side<00:01:43.040> that<00:01:43.280> I'm<00:01:43.370> used<00:01:43.580> to

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
so if I hit the side that I'm used to

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:49.149 
so if I hit the side that I'm used to
the<00:01:44.570> windshield<00:01:45.260> wipers<00:01:45.620> go<00:01:47.890> so<00:01:48.890> I<00:01:48.920> have<00:01:49.070> to

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159 
the windshield wipers go so I have to

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:50.830 
the windshield wipers go so I have to
remember<00:01:49.370> that<00:01:49.550> not<00:01:50.000> only<00:01:50.330> is<00:01:50.510> a<00:01:50.570> steering

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
remember that not only is a steering

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:51.940 
remember that not only is a steering
wheel<00:01:50.960> on<00:01:51.020> the<00:01:51.080> wrong<00:01:51.200> side<00:01:51.409> and<00:01:51.619> I'm<00:01:51.680> on<00:01:51.710> the

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
wheel on the wrong side and I'm on the

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.550 
wheel on the wrong side and I'm on the
wrong<00:01:52.070> side<00:01:52.250> of<00:01:52.340> the<00:01:52.400> car<00:01:52.520> but<00:01:53.140> I<00:01:54.140> think<00:01:54.229> the

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
wrong side of the car but I think the

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.290 
wrong side of the car but I think the
culturally<00:01:55.070> appropriate<00:01:55.490> term<00:01:55.940> is<00:01:56.090> on<00:01:56.210> the

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:56.300 
culturally appropriate term is on the

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:16.990 
culturally appropriate term is on the
opposite<00:01:56.720> side<00:01:56.960> not<00:01:57.770> on<00:01:57.800> the<00:01:57.950> wrong<00:01:58.070> side

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.850 

how<00:02:18.000> you<00:02:18.090> doing

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
how you doing

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.780 
how you doing
okay<00:02:21.110> the<00:02:22.110> roads<00:02:22.320> are<00:02:22.500> also<00:02:22.740> incredibly<00:02:23.280> bumpy

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
okay the roads are also incredibly bumpy

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:29.840 
okay the roads are also incredibly bumpy
so<00:02:25.910> yes<00:02:26.910> take<00:02:27.600> that<00:02:27.810> into<00:02:28.140> effect<00:02:28.490> very<00:02:29.490> few

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
so yes take that into effect very few

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.030 
so yes take that into effect very few
very<00:02:30.600> few<00:02:30.720> of<00:02:31.020> the<00:02:31.110> roads<00:02:31.320> are<00:02:31.470> paved<00:02:31.620> in<00:02:31.920> this

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
very few of the roads are paved in this

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.130 
very few of the roads are paved in this
town<00:02:32.250> so<00:02:32.870> we're<00:02:33.870> dealing<00:02:34.140> with<00:02:34.170> lots<00:02:34.500> of
