00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.909
 very good girls very good guys I am 

00:00:02.409 --> 00:00:06.339
 and granddaughters how are you waiting? 

00:00:03.909 --> 00:00:12.219
 you are all very well today I tell you 

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:15.130
 a news about 343 industries and about 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:17.560
 well what he said has commented that 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:18.819
 call of duty and folk titan are in debt 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:23.109
 with halo 2 

00:00:18.819 --> 00:00:25.479
 I 've said it that way, and it's not 343 

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:28.390
 industries is frei handed fortify 

00:00:25.479 --> 00:00:31.239
 I do not care industries to tell me that 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:35.019
 my English is terrible but that's how it turns out 

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:37.420
 that the executive producer is in ayub 

00:00:35.019 --> 00:00:40.210
 assured that the great shooters of 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.429
 console are in total debt with broths 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.399
 in the statements in some 

00:00:42.429 --> 00:00:47.739
 statements to an important page 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:50.140
 ayub considers that halo 2 was the title 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:51.519
 that convinced him that the consoles could 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.370
 have their own shooters at first 

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:56.499
 person going back making halo 2 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.059
 it was something tremendously fun for me 

00:00:56.499 --> 00:01:01.210
 and I always talk about my experience 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:03.129
 personal with hello was the game that I 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:06.190
 taught that you could do good 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:09.310
 shooters in console and according to the producer 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:13.060
 which is in charge of halo halo 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:15.670
 master chief collection as he claims that 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:18.430
 think about the multiplayer and how it changed 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.980
 his life forever in this sense and 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:23.290
 he has it very clear because he sees games 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:25.900
 current as a folk titan or call of duty 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.820
 and all those titles owe their 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.610
 Multiplayer experiences is halo 2 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:33.220
 has an idealized point of view in its 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.830
 mind is perfect 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.870
 I do not know how good real until 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:41.860
 what point is right 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:44.710
 I played agile or played a lot 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:49.230
 shooters good really the vast majority 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:49.230
 of games for me I'm shooters 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.149
 the truth is that hello was a game 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.990
 totally revolutionary was a game 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:59.340
 which is that no one nobody expected 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.869
 awesome I do not know what you think the 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.610
 respect because this has a lot 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.600
 controversy and has many points 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.220
 of sight 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.259
