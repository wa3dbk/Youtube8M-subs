account<00:07:22.020> the<00:07:23.020> other<00:07:23.169> thing<00:07:23.499> is<00:07:23.889> I<00:07:24.129> think<00:07:24.189> this

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:24.430 
account the other thing is I think this

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:27.480 
account the other thing is I think this
is<00:07:24.490> retailing<00:07:25.060> when<00:07:25.900> it<00:07:26.050> was<00:07:26.289> invitation<00:07:26.979> only

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:27.490 
is retailing when it was invitation only

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:30.119 
is retailing when it was invitation only
it<00:07:27.759> was<00:07:27.879> retailing<00:07:28.479> for<00:07:28.629> about<00:07:28.930> $100<00:07:29.800> so<00:07:30.009> it

00:07:30.119 --> 00:07:30.129 
it was retailing for about $100 so it

00:07:30.129 --> 00:07:33.450 
it was retailing for about $100 so it
was<00:07:30.279> nice<00:07:30.490> to<00:07:30.550> get<00:07:30.939> it<00:07:31.060> for<00:07:31.270> for<00:07:32.139> that<00:07:32.409> cost<00:07:32.919> but

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:33.460 
was nice to get it for for that cost but

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:37.339 
was nice to get it for for that cost but
I<00:07:33.490> think<00:07:33.879> it's<00:07:34.029> about<00:07:34.949> 180<00:07:35.949> dollars<00:07:36.300> u.s.

00:07:37.339 --> 00:07:37.349 
I think it's about 180 dollars u.s.

00:07:37.349 --> 00:07:40.110 
I think it's about 180 dollars u.s.
right<00:07:38.349> now<00:07:38.529> not<00:07:39.039> sure<00:07:39.279> what<00:07:39.520> it<00:07:39.610> is<00:07:39.729> right<00:07:39.969> now
