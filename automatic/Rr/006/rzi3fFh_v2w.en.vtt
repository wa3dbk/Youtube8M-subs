 and there you are connected here in the good channel and 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.759
 cheap good supplements 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.330
 Today's video will be about that and it is 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:21.900
 here I and dabori neutral and it is a mistake 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:25.470
 I bought it about a month ago. 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:29.220
 It has not come to this as you can. 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.929
 see the package was empty at the points 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.790
 talk about the positives and the 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.770
 negative points of this product 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.480
 is there any positive point 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.489
 on him but let's go 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.600
 Let's first take it as a 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.489
 professional 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.379
 She's down here, but I'll leave it here. 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:47.610
 on the side for you as you walk 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:49.170
 things and that the product claims t 130 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.809
 Calories as the amount that is in the 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.210
 12 grams of carbohydrate that is 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.860
 a low amount 26 grams of 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.410
 protein with a very high amount 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.260
 for 1 guys price two grams of fat 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.699
 which is roque and that in two milligrams 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.909
 sodium which is also a bit 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.920
 Low and what happens I was happy 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.200
 when you purchase this product because 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.500
 because I did not know the truth does not take away 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.840
 this dark Trojan brand because I went 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.990
 search an award and I found an album 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.850
 on the internet talk about this information 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.009
 that I collected for you 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.640
 Now you see what you're talking about. 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.700
 there 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.280
 this product has 11 grams of protein and 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.520
 12 grams of carbohydrate 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.930
 I was extremely nervous but only 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.759
 I was also happy that I knew that 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.759
 I could bring this video to you 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:41.400
 here to talk about the scam that this product 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.799
 So I'll tell you guys, do not buy it. 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.590
 this product because their information 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.840
 are totally totally false 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.040
 manipulated this is a terrible thing 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.030
 for the brand of supplements for 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.979
 Any of them 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.180
 and besides this is not only this problem is 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.909
 that this item that amount 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:01.110
 very low protein amount 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:03.390
 high carbohydrate by arrived scared 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.850
 that looks like a video , and can is 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.970
 seems like this package is great but 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:11.840
 it is not with him that he gives a little more 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.390
 a span of this growing package 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.000
 he is very small very small have 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.129
 space for you to do nothing and still 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.989
 It's in here, it's okay, it's one thing. 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:23.750
 very good because well question of 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:25.970
 hygienization in a balanced package and 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.220
 this one here that was in it but that 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.830
 even concessions that have improved 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:33.290
 put the mount does not dirty your hand 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.849
 because with this package is very small 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.830
 When are you going to lay your hand there? 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:39.290
 inside in his entire music 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.700
 you came to waste a lot of money. 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.290
 long term thing 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.650
 a lot but for those who are cow's hands 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:48.380
 will end up wasting a lot on the 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:53.000
 term and another thing that I thought he 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:55.760
 have not registered and can not remember who 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.980
 told me it was pilot use if 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.329
 put a comment on him brigade and why 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.760
 speak the name of and 

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:05.390
 and I do not think it happens it you 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:07.220
 force you to transfer 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:08.870
 things with this package for the tie in the 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.220
 But here the employer to ensure 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.410
 that it is not open 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.660
 this is a terrible thing plus one 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:17.299
 problem with this email and that it does not 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.790
 well with carving this is a very thing 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:22.730
 Bad as I already said all videos 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:26.030
 the supplements all have to do with the 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:28.250
 scup so you know the right measure of e 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.959
 which unfortunately did not come to fruition 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.819
 If I had come I would not have done much 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:33.799
 difference because if the eike with crap 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:36.829
 almost also has its positives 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:40.970
 I have to highlight is the absorption of it 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:42.980
 the admission of it by the way is very good too 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:45.590
 Talk about water in milk easier 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:48.799
 It's still with Malta It decreases well if I 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:52.700
 I have to talk and another positive point is 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:54.859
 I like it and it's very good, it does not 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.120
 It's not the best I took, it's not enough. 

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:58.700
 close to being one of the best that I 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.470
 I took a very nice taste well 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.139
 cool, you make a way with him 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.849
 for example other things and is another 

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:07.970
 thing that I have for you 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:10.549
 now I do not even know are giving to you 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:14.840
 but it was written that it was imported 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:16.910
 that the United States flag here is 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:20.090
 imported from the United States but not 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:23.590
 this is imported from the bangu can only 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:26.770
 by walking by matters 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:29.770
 that's not possible for us to brand 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:31.810
 is in the river all the national brands 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:33.190
 I'll try to show you now 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:35.500
 all awards 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.000
 before posting the video because there we 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:40.570
 let us know if you like we just 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:45.040
 here are true or false and 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:46.479
 he still claims that six grams of 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.820
 versiani 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:51.340
 I'll tell you something that product that 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:53.320
 It has neither the proteins it claims 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:55.780
 Do you really think that there will be six 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:05:01.750
 gram of bcaa may have 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:04.300
 I do not know, can not I can ? 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:07.410
 quality is 100% guaranteed 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:13.960
 quality is even 100% guaranteed 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:15.789
 because our goal is to be the result 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.979
 that's right 

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:20.380
 great brand, I do not know if you noticed 

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:21.789
 but you are not similar to the peel staff 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:23.560
 that this mark is horrible 

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:25.150
 I do not advise to you if you do not 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.190
 believed in the new one that I showed that I 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:29.590
 I do not even think about talking ah but you think 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:31.660
 internet then but seems to do the 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:33.700

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:36.520

 Got it over and I told you we're right. 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:40.510
 with this invitation that I wanted to bring 

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.740
 You did not like it that way. 

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:43.780
 I recommend it for you 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:45.490
 So leave the john if you like 

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:47.260
 negative video if you did not like it 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:49.360
 explain why there in the comments 

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:52.139
 and it was this, he said until the next 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.139
 video that has a god 

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:11.470
