managing real madrid as you can see and
we're<00:00:17.609> going<00:00:17.730> to<00:00:17.760> be<00:00:17.850> playing<00:00:17.970> on<00:00:18.180> semi-pro

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
we're going to be playing on semi-pro

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.179 
we're going to be playing on semi-pro
because<00:00:19.080> I'm<00:00:19.199> not<00:00:19.289> really<00:00:19.500> very<00:00:19.740> good<00:00:19.980> at<00:00:20.100> the

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
because I'm not really very good at the

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:21.230 
because I'm not really very good at the
game<00:00:20.220> and<00:00:20.520> I<00:00:20.550> want<00:00:20.699> to<00:00:20.760> get<00:00:20.820> a<00:00:20.880> little<00:00:21.119> bit

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
game and I want to get a little bit

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.390 
game and I want to get a little bit
better<00:00:21.359> so<00:00:21.660> I<00:00:21.840> think<00:00:22.050> semi-pro<00:00:22.650> difficulty<00:00:23.250> is

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
better so I think semi-pro difficulty is

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.759 
better so I think semi-pro difficulty is
pretty<00:00:23.670> good<00:00:23.850> for<00:00:24.000> me<00:00:24.090> and<00:00:24.590> managing<00:00:25.590> real

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
pretty good for me and managing real

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:26.779 
pretty good for me and managing real

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.490 
got gareth bale who can play left back
anyway<00:01:15.150> so<00:01:15.210> I<00:01:15.450> think<00:01:15.570> I'll<00:01:15.840> just<00:01:15.869> put<00:01:16.200> gareth

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
anyway so I think I'll just put gareth

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.960 
anyway so I think I'll just put gareth
bale<00:01:16.619> as<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:16.920> first-choice<00:01:17.250> left-back<00:01:17.490> for

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
the rest of the season and marcelo can

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.770 
the rest of the season and marcelo can
just<00:01:20.460> off<00:01:20.670> like<00:01:20.850> we<00:01:21.000> won't<00:01:21.240> need<00:01:21.330> anyone

am I think his time is probably up now

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.429 
am I think his time is probably up now
you<00:01:53.220> know<00:01:53.430> he<00:01:53.729> must<00:01:53.939> be<00:01:54.000> like<00:01:54.299> pushing<00:01:54.780> on<00:01:54.899> 40

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
to keep him in the team but then

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.530 
to keep him in the team but then

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:30.419 
really weird because um actually I

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:32.629 
really weird because um actually I
suppose<00:03:30.720> it<00:03:30.900> was<00:03:30.989> fair<00:03:31.199> enough<00:03:31.639> lokomotiv

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:32.639 
suppose it was fair enough lokomotiv

moscow<00:03:32.940> came<00:03:33.120> back<00:03:33.299> to<00:03:33.419> me<00:03:33.540> and<00:03:33.569> said<00:03:33.690> they

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
moscow came back to me and said they

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:35.780 
moscow came back to me and said they
wouldn't<00:03:34.199> accept<00:03:34.410> my<00:03:34.769> offer<00:03:34.949> for<00:03:35.099> diarra<00:03:35.549> of

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
wouldn't accept my offer for diarra of

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.849 
wouldn't accept my offer for diarra of
40<00:03:36.299> million<00:03:36.480> because<00:03:37.019> he<00:03:37.349> just<00:03:37.620> recently

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:37.859 
40 million because he just recently

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:39.680 
40 million because he just recently
moved<00:03:38.190> which<00:03:38.669> is<00:03:38.819> fair<00:03:38.970> because<00:03:39.120> if<00:03:39.389> a<00:03:39.480> player

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
moved which is fair because if a player

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.449 
moved which is fair because if a player
does<00:03:39.930> recently<00:03:40.410> moved<00:03:40.620> to<00:03:40.680> a<00:03:40.739> club<00:03:41.010> there's<00:03:41.220> no

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
does recently moved to a club there's no

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:42.949 
does recently moved to a club there's no
chance<00:03:41.790> that<00:03:41.940> they<00:03:42.120> would<00:03:42.269> sell<00:03:42.480> them<00:03:42.660> to<00:03:42.780> any

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
chance that they would sell them to any

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:44.809 
chance that they would sell them to any
team<00:03:43.260> like<00:03:43.739> for<00:03:43.889> example<00:03:43.980> if<00:03:44.280> bale<00:03:44.459> went<00:03:44.730> to

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:44.819 
team like for example if bale went to

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:46.430 
team like for example if bale went to
real<00:03:44.940> madrid<00:03:45.299> and<00:03:45.449> barcelona<00:03:45.629> made<00:03:46.169> an<00:03:46.290> offer

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
real madrid and barcelona made an offer

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.199 
real madrid and barcelona made an offer
for<00:03:46.739> him<00:03:46.889> there's<00:03:47.099> no<00:03:47.400> way<00:03:47.609> it<00:03:47.819> could<00:03:48.060> possibly

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
for him there's no way it could possibly

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:50.390 
for him there's no way it could possibly
be<00:03:48.569> accepted<00:03:49.169> in<00:03:49.290> FIFA<00:03:49.650> and<00:03:49.799> that's<00:03:49.949> fair<00:03:50.160> like

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
be accepted in FIFA and that's fair like

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.770 
be accepted in FIFA and that's fair like
if<00:03:50.519> they<00:03:50.669> want<00:03:50.849> to<00:03:50.910> keep<00:03:51.030> it<00:03:51.150> realistic<00:03:51.449> like

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
if they want to keep it realistic like

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.599 
if they want to keep it realistic like
that<00:03:51.959> then<00:03:52.440> that's<00:03:52.650> totally<00:03:53.040> fine<00:03:53.190> but<00:03:53.370> we<00:03:53.489> go

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:53.609 
that then that's totally fine but we go

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:54.770 
that then that's totally fine but we go
into<00:03:53.760> our<00:03:53.940> first<00:03:54.150> game<00:03:54.359> which<00:03:54.510> is<00:03:54.629> actually

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
into our first game which is actually

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.149 
into our first game which is actually
the<00:03:54.989> Champions<00:03:55.379> League<00:03:55.470> final<00:03:55.769> and<00:03:56.040> it's

00:03:56.149 --> 00:03:56.159 
the Champions League final and it's

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:58.009 
the Champions League final and it's
against<00:03:56.400> saw<00:03:56.609> show<00:03:56.849> and<00:03:57.120> this<00:03:57.629> is<00:03:57.750> the<00:03:57.840> team

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
against saw show and this is the team

00:03:58.019 --> 00:03:59.330 
against saw show and this is the team
that<00:03:58.049> I<00:03:58.230> lined<00:03:58.440> up<00:03:58.590> wait<00:03:58.769> for<00:03:58.980> it<00:03:59.040> I<00:03:59.099> thought<00:03:59.220> it

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
that I lined up wait for it I thought it

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:00.500 
that I lined up wait for it I thought it
