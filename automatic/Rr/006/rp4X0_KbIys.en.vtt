curator a man called Samuel stuch Murray
and<00:00:23.050> he<00:00:23.500> thought<00:00:23.710> they<00:00:23.860> came<00:00:24.040> from<00:00:24.190> a

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:24.310 
and he thought they came from a

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:26.160 
and he thought they came from a
crocodile<00:00:24.520> but<00:00:25.090> he<00:00:25.150> wasn't<00:00:25.420> really<00:00:25.540> sure<00:00:25.870> so

he consulted his friend Henry Riley and
together<00:00:29.470> they<00:00:29.770> studied<00:00:30.310> these<00:00:30.490> bones<00:00:30.820> and

sheathed toothed reptiles a bit of a
mouthful<00:00:50.950> but<00:00:51.850> they<00:00:52.450> still<00:00:52.660> didn't<00:00:52.870> know<00:00:52.930> what

mouthful but they still didn't know what
it<00:00:53.200> was<00:00:53.320> because<00:00:53.710> the<00:00:53.860> word<00:00:54.070> dinosaur<00:00:54.460> had<00:00:55.059> not

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:55.270 
it was because the word dinosaur had not

it was because the word dinosaur had not

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:00.910 
dinosaur came about in 1842 when we

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:02.580 
dinosaur came about in 1842 when we
think<00:01:01.030> of<00:01:01.149> dinosaurs<00:01:01.690> of<00:01:01.899> course<00:01:02.110> we<00:01:02.260> think<00:01:02.469> of

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:02.590 
think of dinosaurs of course we think of

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.100 
think of dinosaurs of course we think of
the<00:01:02.680> monsters<00:01:03.160> like<00:01:03.579> Tyrannosaurus<00:01:04.000> Rex<00:01:04.780> and

the monsters like Tyrannosaurus Rex and

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.499 
the monsters like Tyrannosaurus Rex and
Brachiosaurus<00:01:06.040> the<00:01:06.250> these<00:01:06.759> weighed<00:01:07.240> many

00:01:07.499 --> 00:01:07.509 
Brachiosaurus the these weighed many

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:09.749 
Brachiosaurus the these weighed many
tons<00:01:07.869> and<00:01:08.259> there<00:01:08.590> were<00:01:08.710> many<00:01:08.890> tens<00:01:09.189> of<00:01:09.430> meters

00:01:09.749 --> 00:01:09.759 
tons and there were many tens of meters

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:12.029 
tons and there were many tens of meters
long<00:01:09.999> the<00:01:10.270> Bristol<00:01:11.109> dinosaur<00:01:11.619> of<00:01:11.709> course<00:01:11.920> is

00:01:12.029 --> 00:01:12.039 
long the Bristol dinosaur of course is

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:13.830 
long the Bristol dinosaur of course is
an<00:01:12.159> english<00:01:12.459> dinosaur<00:01:12.999> so<00:01:13.240> it's<00:01:13.420> a<00:01:13.509> fairly

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
an english dinosaur so it's a fairly

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.230 
an english dinosaur so it's a fairly
modest<00:01:14.229> sized<00:01:14.560> creature<00:01:14.979> it<00:01:15.609> was<00:01:15.850> probably

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
modest sized creature it was probably

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.940 
modest sized creature it was probably
about<00:01:16.420> a<00:01:16.600> metre<00:01:16.990> or<00:01:17.109> 2<00:01:17.409> meters<00:01:17.770> in<00:01:17.799> length

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
about a metre or 2 meters in length

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.699 
about a metre or 2 meters in length
depending<00:01:18.700> on<00:01:18.880> age<00:01:19.270> it<00:01:19.959> was<00:01:20.139> a<00:01:20.170> two-legged

00:01:20.699 --> 00:01:20.709 
depending on age it was a two-legged

00:01:20.709 --> 00:01:22.769 
depending on age it was a two-legged
dinosaur<00:01:21.219> so<00:01:21.759> it<00:01:21.850> ran<00:01:21.999> about<00:01:22.119> on<00:01:22.450> its<00:01:22.600> hind

00:01:22.769 --> 00:01:22.779 
dinosaur so it ran about on its hind

00:01:22.779 --> 00:01:24.629 
dinosaur so it ran about on its hind
legs<00:01:22.929> and<00:01:23.319> probably<00:01:23.740> when<00:01:23.889> it<00:01:23.979> was<00:01:24.069> alive<00:01:24.340> its

00:01:24.629 --> 00:01:24.639 
legs and probably when it was alive its

00:01:24.639 --> 00:01:26.940 
legs and probably when it was alive its
body<00:01:24.850> would<00:01:25.060> have<00:01:25.179> been<00:01:25.329> held<00:01:26.079> pretty<00:01:26.770> much

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
body would have been held pretty much

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.649 
body would have been held pretty much
horizontal<00:01:27.189> so<00:01:27.819> the<00:01:27.939> tail<00:01:28.179> you've<00:01:28.450> got<00:01:28.569> to

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:28.659 
horizontal so the tail you've got to

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:30.480 
horizontal so the tail you've got to
imagine<00:01:28.869> a<00:01:29.109> long<00:01:29.289> thin<00:01:29.649> tail<00:01:29.950> sticking<00:01:30.279> out

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
imagine a long thin tail sticking out

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.609 
imagine a long thin tail sticking out
behind<00:01:30.819> the<00:01:31.569> body<00:01:31.779> more<00:01:32.020> or<00:01:32.170> less<00:01:32.289> horizontal

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:32.619 
behind the body more or less horizontal

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:35.010 
behind the body more or less horizontal
in<00:01:33.039> front<00:01:33.369> and<00:01:33.639> the<00:01:34.060> neck<00:01:34.240> sort<00:01:34.509> of<00:01:34.599> bent<00:01:34.810> up

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
in front and the neck sort of bent up

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.580 
in front and the neck sort of bent up
and<00:01:35.229> a<00:01:35.950> fairly<00:01:36.340> small<00:01:36.639> head<00:01:36.999> and<00:01:37.380> indeed<00:01:38.380> when

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
and a fairly small head and indeed when

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:39.899 
and a fairly small head and indeed when
you<00:01:38.619> look<00:01:38.859> at<00:01:38.950> the<00:01:39.069> head<00:01:39.249> it's<00:01:39.459> sort<00:01:39.639> of<00:01:39.670> long

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:39.909 
you look at the head it's sort of long

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:42.839 
you look at the head it's sort of long
and<00:01:40.149> thin<00:01:40.420> and<00:01:40.450> pointed<00:01:41.139> the<00:01:41.770> teeth<00:01:42.039> are<00:01:42.369> just

00:01:42.839 --> 00:01:42.849 
and thin and pointed the teeth are just

00:01:42.849 --> 00:01:45.839 
and thin and pointed the teeth are just
small<00:01:43.479> leaf<00:01:44.380> shaped<00:01:44.740> things<00:01:45.099> they're<00:01:45.549> sort<00:01:45.789> of

00:01:45.839 --> 00:01:45.849 
small leaf shaped things they're sort of

00:01:45.849 --> 00:01:48.599 
small leaf shaped things they're sort of
sharp<00:01:46.179> but<00:01:47.049> not<00:01:47.259> the<00:01:47.439> long<00:01:47.649> curved<00:01:48.310> sharp

00:01:48.599 --> 00:01:48.609 
sharp but not the long curved sharp

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:50.639 
sharp but not the long curved sharp
teeth<00:01:48.969> that<00:01:49.270> the<00:01:49.359> meat-eating<00:01:49.840> dinosaurs<00:01:50.380> had

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:50.649 
teeth that the meat-eating dinosaurs had

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:52.859 
teeth that the meat-eating dinosaurs had
so<00:01:51.340> even<00:01:51.579> the<00:01:51.669> teeth<00:01:51.849> are<00:01:52.060> quite<00:01:52.240> modest<00:01:52.659> and

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:52.869 
so even the teeth are quite modest and

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:54.239 
so even the teeth are quite modest and
this<00:01:53.020> is<00:01:53.169> quite<00:01:53.289> probably<00:01:53.829> a<00:01:53.919> fairly

00:01:54.239 --> 00:01:54.249 
this is quite probably a fairly

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:56.779 
this is quite probably a fairly
inoffensive<00:01:54.700> animal<00:01:55.299> as<00:01:56.049> far<00:01:56.319> as<00:01:56.439> we<00:01:56.560> know

00:01:56.779 --> 00:01:56.789 
inoffensive animal as far as we know

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:59.429 
inoffensive animal as far as we know
there<00:01:57.789> are<00:01:57.819> quite<00:01:58.060> a<00:01:58.090> lot<00:01:58.209> of<00:01:58.389> them<00:01:58.689> so<00:01:58.959> that<00:01:59.200> in

00:01:59.429 --> 00:01:59.439 
there are quite a lot of them so that in

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:01.559 
there are quite a lot of them so that in
the<00:01:59.740> different<00:02:00.130> quarries<00:02:00.490> in<00:02:00.789> Bristol<00:02:01.299> and

00:02:01.559 --> 00:02:01.569 
the different quarries in Bristol and

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:04.169 
the different quarries in Bristol and
around<00:02:01.840> Bristol<00:02:02.319> we<00:02:03.249> found<00:02:03.520> the<00:02:03.669> remains<00:02:03.759> of

00:02:04.169 --> 00:02:04.179 
around Bristol we found the remains of

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:06.499 
around Bristol we found the remains of
maybe<00:02:04.389> 20<00:02:04.810> or<00:02:04.840> 30<00:02:05.169> individual<00:02:05.919> animals

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
maybe 20 or 30 individual animals

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.389 
maybe 20 or 30 individual animals
presumably<00:02:07.509> males<00:02:07.810> and<00:02:08.170> females<00:02:08.590> there<00:02:09.280> are

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
presumably males and females there are

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:11.250 
presumably males and females there are
two<00:02:09.550> kinds<00:02:10.030> of<00:02:10.149> skeletons<00:02:10.630> some<00:02:10.899> of<00:02:11.020> them<00:02:11.170> are

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
two kinds of skeletons some of them are

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.559 
two kinds of skeletons some of them are
a<00:02:11.290> bit<00:02:11.380> more<00:02:12.250> robust<00:02:12.760> than<00:02:13.060> others<00:02:13.300> whether

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
a bit more robust than others whether

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.000 
a bit more robust than others whether
those<00:02:13.780> are<00:02:13.840> the<00:02:14.050> males<00:02:14.260> or<00:02:14.440> the<00:02:14.500> females<00:02:14.860> I

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
those are the males or the females I

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.710 
those are the males or the females I
don't<00:02:15.250> know<00:02:15.430> and<00:02:15.670> there<00:02:16.240> are<00:02:16.270> even<00:02:16.450> some

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
don't know and there are even some

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.510 
don't know and there are even some
juveniles<00:02:17.260> as<00:02:17.470> well<00:02:17.650> so<00:02:18.040> we

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
juveniles as well so we

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.880 
juveniles as well so we
have<00:02:18.610> a<00:02:18.700> picture<00:02:19.150> of<00:02:19.270> family<00:02:20.140> life<00:02:20.350> in<00:02:20.650> a<00:02:20.710> way

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
have a picture of family life in a way

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.070 
have a picture of family life in a way
we're<00:02:21.400> interested<00:02:21.940> in<00:02:22.000> secret<00:02:22.360> onto<00:02:22.570> Soros<00:02:22.900> we

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
we're interested in secret onto Soros we

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.980 
we're interested in secret onto Soros we
work<00:02:23.290> on<00:02:23.530> it<00:02:23.710> in<00:02:24.310> Bristol<00:02:24.850> University<00:02:25.210> because

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
work on it in Bristol University because

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.440 
work on it in Bristol University because
not<00:02:26.320> only<00:02:26.350> is<00:02:26.950> it<00:02:26.980> the<00:02:27.310> Bristol<00:02:27.700> dinosaur<00:02:28.210> so

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
not only is it the Bristol dinosaur so

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.690 
not only is it the Bristol dinosaur so
it<00:02:28.570> has<00:02:28.690> some<00:02:28.930> local<00:02:29.260> interest<00:02:29.710> but<00:02:30.040> on<00:02:30.340> an

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
it has some local interest but on an

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:31.980 
it has some local interest but on an
international<00:02:31.330> scale<00:02:31.480> it's<00:02:31.750> really

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:31.990 
international scale it's really

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:33.600 
international scale it's really
important<00:02:32.470> because<00:02:32.680> this<00:02:33.070> is<00:02:33.220> one<00:02:33.370> of<00:02:33.490> the

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
important because this is one of the

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.060 
important because this is one of the
very<00:02:33.790> first<00:02:34.240> plant<00:02:34.870> eating<00:02:35.140> dinosaurs<00:02:35.860> that

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070 
very first plant eating dinosaurs that

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.700 
very first plant eating dinosaurs that

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
were around at the time they were enough

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.670 
were around at the time they were enough
there<00:02:43.240> were<00:02:43.300> not<00:02:43.510> the<00:02:43.690> typical<00:02:43.930> plants<00:02:44.530> we<00:02:44.650> see

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
there were not the typical plants we see

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.860 
there were not the typical plants we see
today<00:02:45.220> the<00:02:45.460> kinds<00:02:45.760> of<00:02:45.850> grasses<00:02:46.180> and<00:02:46.600> flowering

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
plants were not there but presumably it

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.260 
plants were not there but presumably it
fed<00:02:49.600> on<00:02:49.630> ferns<00:02:50.170> and<00:02:51.070> some<00:02:51.310> kinds<00:02:51.610> of<00:02:51.670> conifers

there<00:02:52.630> were<00:02:52.750> ancestors<00:02:53.530> of<00:02:53.680> monkey<00:02:54.010> puzzle

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
there were ancestors of monkey puzzle

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.550 
there were ancestors of monkey puzzle
trees<00:02:54.640> around<00:02:55.330> then<00:02:55.600> they've<00:02:55.990> had<00:02:56.050> enemies

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
trees around then they've had enemies

trees around then they've had enemies
there<00:02:56.860> were<00:02:57.150> meat-eating<00:02:58.150> dinosaurs<00:02:58.690> but<00:02:58.990> we

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
there were meat-eating dinosaurs but we

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.640 
there were meat-eating dinosaurs but we
don't<00:02:59.350> have<00:02:59.650> complete<00:03:00.520> skeletons<00:03:01.120> of<00:03:01.240> those

don't have complete skeletons of those

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.930 
don't have complete skeletons of those
and<00:03:02.650> there<00:03:02.770> are<00:03:02.860> other<00:03:03.040> meat-eaters<00:03:03.640> around

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940

at<00:03:04.090> the<00:03:04.180> time<00:03:04.360> so<00:03:04.750> probably<00:03:05.470> the<00:03:05.710> Bristol

million<00:04:47.330> years<00:04:47.540> ago<00:04:47.930> at<00:04:48.410> that<00:04:48.680> time<00:04:48.980> during

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:49.850 
million years ago at that time during

the Triassic period Bristol lay quite
near<00:04:53.090> the<00:04:53.210> equator<00:04:53.450> and<00:04:53.900> so<00:04:54.800> climates<00:04:55.280> were

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.400 
near the equator and so climates were

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.580 
near the equator and so climates were
very<00:04:55.580> hot<00:04:55.850> and<00:04:56.750> the<00:04:56.900> scene<00:04:57.140> we<00:04:57.320> have<00:04:57.440> to

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590 
very hot and the scene we have to

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:59.830 
very hot and the scene we have to
imagine<00:04:57.800> was<00:04:58.220> of<00:04:58.490> of<00:04:58.790> small<00:04:59.210> islands

00:04:59.830 --> 00:04:59.840 
imagine was of of small islands

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.020 
imagine was of of small islands
limestone<00:05:00.410> islands<00:05:00.890> and<00:05:01.190> and<00:05:01.370> so<00:05:01.550> the<00:05:01.670> men<00:05:01.850> dip

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:02.030 
limestone islands and and so the men dip

were actually Islands the sea level was

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:07.750 
were actually Islands the sea level was
higher<00:05:05.540> and<00:05:06.020> it<00:05:06.710> was<00:05:06.800> quite<00:05:06.980> a<00:05:07.010> tropical<00:05:07.520> sea

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:07.760 
higher and it was quite a tropical sea

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.850 
higher and it was quite a tropical sea
and<00:05:08.000> there<00:05:08.450> were<00:05:08.510> dinosaurs<00:05:08.720> toddling<00:05:09.560> around

on these islands and from time to time
the<00:05:12.200> limestone<00:05:12.380> islands<00:05:13.010> would<00:05:13.220> be<00:05:13.490> would

the limestone islands would be would

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.990 
the limestone islands would be would
form<00:05:14.480> into<00:05:14.930> karst<00:05:15.770> landscape<00:05:16.520> that<00:05:16.730> means

form into karst landscape that means

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.570 
form into karst landscape that means
cracks<00:05:17.510> and<00:05:17.840> fissures<00:05:18.100> would<00:05:19.100> form<00:05:19.370> on<00:05:19.490> the
