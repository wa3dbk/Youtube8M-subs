00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 hello to all these workers 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:06.750
 cycling is today highly 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:11.630
 first video so a video on the 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:14.790
 Tour de France 2014 and on the ps3 is 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:17.300
 so from the team I chose and there 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.580
 guillaume shimano arrow shimano in 2013 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.380
 with marcel kittel and john degenkolb and 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.930
 warren barguil who had demolished an hour 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.340
 we have two very good sprinters so we 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.740
 will try to do something to 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:33.120
 the green jersey allo yellow jersey so 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:37.160
 stalled to section the whole thing in 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:39.420
 organized two compositions one barguil 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.000
 77.1 mountain on the other hand not good in 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:45.390
 against the watch 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.360
 so we will do the best we can 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:51.870
 john degenkolb 80 spring marcel kittel 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.829
 93 bonus who is the best sprinter 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.190
 of this team 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:59.850
 so it's good I do not think of 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:03.140
 change March who seeing I do not think so 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:09.540
 we will change the number behind that 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:17.610
 he made the kits would go right so 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:19.200
 go in your started so game we're going 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.650
 to be ten kilometers from 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.979
 the arrival 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:25.110
 and so this withdrawal must be a 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.720
 kilometer from the arrival of this first 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:31.140
 luxury stage in harrogate with marcel 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.450
 kittel for what she massive so he 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.930
 is my mind voice is the borie who 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.420
 was in 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.439
 Charlie but I won the sprint 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.439
 intermediate of the pack 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:48.060
 so that's what they did at this point 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:51.000
 So I think we'll be protected 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.680
 by john degenkolb in paris he fell 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.270
 we were going to have a falling wand 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:02:01.740
 our leader a little less 151 who are 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:05.369
 fell here the past only to annuities aulas 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:08.099
 I hope to moan from and contado frank 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:16.020
 schleck andy schleck 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:18.120
 so see john degenkolb ger we 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.560
 protect it has a collective fall 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.530
 when we are over forty three 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:29.160
 platoons believed our same habitat 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:33.330
 if they use anything go to there 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:35.700
 did not understand tons of vegetables what then 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:41.120
 that the breakaway asked in the breakaway 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:41.120
 make fun go there 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:48.180
 we are perfectly protected by john 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:52.770
 degenkolb team usa men and daniele 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:03:00.050
 bennati attention and grail paul mendy 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:03:00.050
 top game momentum especially focus 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:08.120
 so take perfectly led we're going 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:10.709
 take the wheels of other sprinters 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:15.240
 what fly that launches struggling by 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:17.510
 kadrige we stay in the wheel members 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.510
 volunteers 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:25.320
 we are good we double the fairings 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:27.540
 maybe the stage win for a 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:31.739
 marcel kittel and that's the victory 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:34.260
 marcel of kittel step that is required 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:37.530
 to notice that super happy heinrich 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:41.010
 very happy with mark cavendish and andre 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:43.950
 rail want in front of christophe too 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:46.280
 fourth christophe I leave you the 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.280
 podiums 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.769
 m 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:59.830
 m 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:09.630
 prestige listeners he's in 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.920
 a sparkling form 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:13.430
 port 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.430
 m 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.639
 2 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:27.039
 yeah 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:31.419
 to death the green jerseys too but at 

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:34.770
 reer also I think our goal 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:34.770
 common with Marcel Kittel 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:43.450
 is what we liked or white unclear 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:43.450
 if the socialite was nobody 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:53.060
 austin surely I do not believe so if 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:57.320
 it's a look denied that he has less of 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:59.750
 25 years old North 25 artists and I am 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:02.140
 rather good and it's a bit long time of 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:02.140
 loading 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:06.270
 all 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:09.740
 they still need a 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:09.740
 are you 

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:18.149
 anyway the guardian 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:26.860
 on the ground will arrive there 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:36.120
 so at marcel kittel wrist that little 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:44.860
 of genk high- knot finished 12th then 

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:47.680
 had been kreuziger gaps in the 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:54.810
 first contador are there to our leader 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:58.780
 there are palaver at the end 22 of 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:06:04.389
 disburse May 12, 2012 our leader good 

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:06.060
 then to a navy 12 so ranking of 

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:08.520
 the mountain 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:11.320
 seros and their workers 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:14.080
 so when dominates the 

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:19.660
 ranking by points we have 24 points to 

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:25.360
 11 on christophe starts best 

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:29.310
 young followed by two games glue when 

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:31.740
 on skis sayan the omega pharma quick step 

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:36.840
 best team 

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:39.520
 the guigne shimano a second way the 

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:44.410
 combativeness is vosseler primo on 

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:46.330
 will see at the end of this round so I hope 

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:48.160
 that this video will have pleased you 

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:52.590
