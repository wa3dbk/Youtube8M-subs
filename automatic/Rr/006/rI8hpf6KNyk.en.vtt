can hook in the slingshot bands and then

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:34.950 
can hook in the slingshot bands and then
there<00:00:32.470> are<00:00:32.559> sledging<00:00:32.890> made<00:00:33.250> from<00:00:33.750> duct<00:00:34.750> tape

so<00:01:02.140> bad<00:01:02.440> as<00:01:02.620> mo<00:01:02.980> needs<00:01:03.250> a<00:01:03.399> badass<00:01:03.880> crossbow<00:01:04.479> so

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:05.440 
so bad as mo needs a badass crossbow so

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.550 
so bad as mo needs a badass crossbow so
I<00:01:05.470> made<00:01:05.800> a<00:01:05.830> new<00:01:06.070> crossbow<00:01:06.580> from<00:01:07.240> plywood

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
I made a new crossbow from plywood

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.710 
I made a new crossbow from plywood
that's<00:01:08.560> entirely<00:01:08.950> made<00:01:09.310> out<00:01:09.340> of<00:01:09.460> wood<00:01:09.700> with<00:01:10.690> a

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:10.720 
that's entirely made out of wood with a

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.570 
that's entirely made out of wood with a
nice<00:01:10.960> trigger<00:01:11.229> mechanism<00:01:11.860> so<00:01:12.250> there's<00:01:12.460> no

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:12.580 
nice trigger mechanism so there's no

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.730 
nice trigger mechanism so there's no
danger<00:01:12.729> that<00:01:13.090> I<00:01:13.180> can<00:01:13.330> hit<00:01:13.450> my<00:01:13.630> hand<00:01:13.899> and<00:01:14.259> you

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:14.740 
danger that I can hit my hand and you

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.030 
danger that I can hit my hand and you
can<00:01:14.920> see<00:01:15.220> that<00:01:15.970> it's<00:01:16.300> already<00:01:16.690> notched<00:01:17.140> and

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:18.040 
can see that it's already notched and

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:30.690 
can see that it's already notched and
ready<00:01:19.030> for<00:01:19.090> shooting<00:01:19.950> let's<00:01:20.950> do<00:01:21.190> just<00:01:21.400> that

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:37.030 

okay<00:01:31.700> let's<00:01:32.180> look<00:01:32.390> at<00:01:32.540> the<00:01:32.930> arrow<00:01:35.860> so<00:01:36.860> it's

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
okay let's look at the arrow so it's

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.600 
okay let's look at the arrow so it's
fully<00:01:38.350> penetrated<00:01:39.350> to<00:01:39.620> do<00:01:39.770> this<00:01:39.920> if<00:01:40.460> you<00:01:40.550> can

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 
fully penetrated to do this if you can

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.330 
fully penetrated to do this if you can
correct<00:01:40.850> it<00:01:41.120> on<00:01:41.240> the<00:01:41.360> backside<00:01:42.040> okay<00:01:43.040> let<00:01:43.250> me

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
correct it on the backside okay let me

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.560 
correct it on the backside okay let me
show<00:01:43.370> you<00:01:43.610> the<00:01:43.880> mechanism<00:01:46.300> it's<00:01:47.300> really

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
show you the mechanism it's really

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.220 
show you the mechanism it's really
simple<00:01:47.830> because<00:01:48.830> the<00:01:49.400> trigger<00:01:50.020> louis<00:01:51.020> that

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:51.230 
simple because the trigger louis that

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:56.800 
simple because the trigger louis that
not<00:01:51.500> share<00:01:53.140> very<00:01:54.140> simple<00:01:54.560> and<00:01:55.570> the<00:01:56.570> flood

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
not share very simple and the flood

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.430 
not share very simple and the flood
shelley<00:01:57.140> is<00:01:57.770> put<00:01:58.070> in<00:01:58.190> here<00:01:58.460> and<00:01:58.810> if<00:01:59.810> I<00:01:59.960> lower<00:02:00.290> it

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.440 
shelley is put in here and if I lower it

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:05.770 
shelley is put in here and if I lower it
it<00:02:01.190> releases<00:02:01.580> very<00:02:02.510> simple<00:02:02.990> yet<00:02:03.470> effective<00:02:04.780> so

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
it releases very simple yet effective so

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.380 
it releases very simple yet effective so
the<00:02:05.960> obvious<00:02:06.110> question<00:02:06.350> is<00:02:06.830> can<00:02:07.190> you<00:02:07.400> also<00:02:07.550> do

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
the obvious question is can you also do

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.570 
the obvious question is can you also do
that<00:02:08.570> with<00:02:08.630> a<00:02:08.810> regular<00:02:09.020> slingshot<00:02:09.679> well<00:02:10.399> it

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
that with a regular slingshot well it

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.580 
that with a regular slingshot well it
takes<00:02:10.729> some<00:02:10.820> courage<00:02:10.970> to<00:02:11.480> do<00:02:11.600> it<00:02:11.720> but<00:02:12.410> of

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
takes some courage to do it but of

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:13.990 
takes some courage to do it but of
course<00:02:12.830> this<00:02:13.070> wouldn't<00:02:13.370> be<00:02:13.460> the<00:02:13.490> slingshot

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
course this wouldn't be the slingshot

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.050 
course this wouldn't be the slingshot
channel<00:02:14.210> we<00:02:14.900> would<00:02:15.050> not<00:02:15.260> test<00:02:15.500> that<00:02:15.880> we're<00:02:16.880> not

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
channel we would not test that we're not

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.580 
channel we would not test that we're not
cowards<00:02:17.450> here<00:02:17.690> at<00:02:17.810> the<00:02:17.930> slingshot<00:02:18.260> channel

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590
