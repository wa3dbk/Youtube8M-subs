accent<00:00:34.920> ROM<00:00:35.070> there<00:00:35.309> with<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.579> magnet<00:00:36.000> this<00:00:36.149> is

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
accent ROM there with the magnet this is

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.799 
accent ROM there with the magnet this is
an<00:00:36.420> industrial<00:00:36.980> accelerometer<00:00:38.510> so<00:00:39.510> let's

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
an industrial accelerometer so let's

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.729 
an industrial accelerometer so let's
move<00:00:39.960> on<00:00:40.140> and<00:00:40.290> see<00:00:40.500> how<00:00:40.530> you<00:00:40.739> can<00:00:41.040> calibrate<00:00:41.309> it

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739 
move on and see how you can calibrate it

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:45.290 
move on and see how you can calibrate it
well<00:00:43.739> definitely<00:00:44.219> in<00:00:44.309> order<00:00:44.550> to<00:00:44.730> start<00:00:45.030> using

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
well definitely in order to start using

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.150 
well definitely in order to start using
everything<00:00:45.809> you<00:00:46.170> have<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.559> calibrate<00:00:46.770> it

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
everything you have to calibrate it

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.440 
everything you have to calibrate it
otherwise<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.789> number<00:00:48.090> that<00:00:48.270> you<00:00:48.390> are

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
otherwise the number that you are

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.510 
otherwise the number that you are
getting<00:00:48.780> is<00:00:48.930> not<00:00:49.140> correct<00:00:49.590> so<00:00:49.890> I'm<00:00:50.370> gonna

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
getting is not correct so I'm gonna

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.209 
getting is not correct so I'm gonna
launch<00:00:50.820> that<00:00:51.289> when<00:00:52.289> you<00:00:52.410> launch<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.829> app<00:00:52.860> as

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
launch that when you launch the app as

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.830 
launch that when you launch the app as
you<00:00:53.399> can<00:00:53.579> see<00:00:53.760> here<00:00:53.969> one<00:00:54.180> of<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.420> main<00:00:54.629> menu

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
you can see here one of the main menu

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.770 
you can see here one of the main menu
here<00:00:55.230> is<00:00:55.410> calibration<00:00:56.300> tapped<00:00:57.300> on<00:00:57.570> the

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
here is calibration tapped on the

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.360 
here is calibration tapped on the
calibration<00:00:58.199> and<00:00:59.809> you<00:01:00.809> just<00:01:01.020> need<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.370> have

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
calibration and you just need to have

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.440 
calibration and you just need to have
everything<00:01:02.789> connected<00:01:03.149> it's<00:01:03.840> very<00:01:04.140> simple

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:05.450 
everything connected it's very simple

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:08.719 
everything connected it's very simple
you<00:01:06.450> have<00:01:06.689> to<00:01:06.930> use<00:01:07.200> one<00:01:07.650> of<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.950> shaker<00:01:08.250> like

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
you have to use one of the shaker like

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.510 
you have to use one of the shaker like
this<00:01:08.939> is<00:01:09.090> one<00:01:09.270> of<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.540> industrial<00:01:10.380> I<00:01:10.619> am<00:01:10.860> I

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
this is one of the industrial I am I

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.870 
this is one of the industrial I am I
shaker<00:01:12.210> one<00:01:12.750> G<00:01:13.049> so<00:01:13.770> you<00:01:13.799> connected<00:01:14.520> through

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
shaker one G so you connected through

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.510 
shaker one G so you connected through
this<00:01:15.170> 1/2<00:01:16.170> magnet<00:01:16.680> here<00:01:16.920> so<00:01:17.159> through<00:01:17.400> the

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
this 1/2 magnet here so through the

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.910 
this 1/2 magnet here so through the
magnet<00:01:17.909> and<00:01:18.119> make<00:01:18.600> sure<00:01:18.720> this<00:01:18.900> is<00:01:18.960> on<00:01:19.320> when<00:01:19.830> you

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
magnet and make sure this is on when you

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.490 
magnet and make sure this is on when you
turn<00:01:20.130> it<00:01:20.310> on<00:01:22.070> it<00:01:23.070> generates<00:01:23.549> 1g<00:01:24.350> vibration<00:01:25.350> in

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
turn it on it generates 1g vibration in

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.590 
turn it on it generates 1g vibration in
this<00:01:25.650> direction<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:26.310> since<00:01:26.939> that<00:01:27.119> kilomters

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
this direction and since that kilomters

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.200 
this direction and since that kilomters
connected<00:01:28.259> is<00:01:28.650> reading<00:01:29.100> through<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.400> app<00:01:29.579> so

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
connected is reading through the app so

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.289 
connected is reading through the app so
once<00:01:31.110> everything<00:01:31.680> is<00:01:31.710> connected<00:01:31.979> just<00:01:32.670> tap<00:01:33.030> on

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
once everything is connected just tap on

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.100 
once everything is connected just tap on
this<00:01:33.630> calibrate<00:01:34.350> for<00:01:34.619> 1g<00:01:35.549> and<00:01:35.880> it<00:01:36.810> gives<00:01:36.990> you

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
this calibrate for 1g and it gives you

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.160 
this calibrate for 1g and it gives you
one<00:01:37.290> warning<00:01:37.530> that's<00:01:38.250> telling<00:01:38.909> you<00:01:39.090> if<00:01:39.689> you

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
one warning that's telling you if you

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.710 
one warning that's telling you if you
accept<00:01:40.829> it<00:01:41.040> it's<00:01:41.490> gonna<00:01:41.670> remove<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.299> older

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
accept it it's gonna remove the older

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.780 
accept it it's gonna remove the older
calibration<00:01:43.560> number<00:01:43.920> and<00:01:44.159> it's<00:01:44.549> gonna

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
calibration number and it's gonna

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.670 
calibration number and it's gonna
replace<00:01:45.210> it<00:01:45.450> with<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.750> new<00:01:45.780> calibration

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
replace it with the new calibration

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.319 
replace it with the new calibration
value<00:01:47.040> so<00:01:47.939> I'm<00:01:48.270> gonna<00:01:48.450> tap<00:01:48.899> ok<00:01:49.380> and<00:01:50.090> once<00:01:51.090> you

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
value so I'm gonna tap ok and once you

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.039 
value so I'm gonna tap ok and once you
tap<00:01:51.600> again<00:01:52.079> go<00:01:52.619> as<00:01:53.270> you<00:01:54.270> can<00:01:54.450> see<00:01:54.689> the<00:01:54.869> new

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
tap again go as you can see the new

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.319 
tap again go as you can see the new
calibration<00:01:55.500> number<00:01:56.340> will<00:01:56.579> come<00:01:56.790> here<00:01:57.090> and

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
calibration number will come here and

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:57.960 
calibration number will come here and
it's<00:01:57.509> going<00:01:57.630> to<00:01:57.689> be

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 
it's going to be

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.690 
it's going to be
place<00:01:58.180> is<00:01:59.020> gonna<00:01:59.260> is<00:01:59.500> gonna<00:01:59.650> the<00:02:00.220> older<00:02:00.520> one

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
place is gonna is gonna the older one

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.270 
place is gonna is gonna the older one
will<00:02:00.910> be<00:02:01.090> replace<00:02:01.450> with<00:02:01.660> means<00:02:01.840> evil<00:02:02.320> so<00:02:03.040> from

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
will be replace with means evil so from

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.190 
will be replace with means evil so from
now<00:02:03.460> on<00:02:03.700> everything<00:02:04.240> is<00:02:04.330> calibrated<00:02:04.930> and<00:02:04.960> you

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
now on everything is calibrated and you

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.620 
now on everything is calibrated and you
can<00:02:05.410> use<00:02:05.860> your<00:02:08.160> app<00:02:09.160> and<00:02:09.610> your<00:02:09.790> system<00:02:10.270> for
