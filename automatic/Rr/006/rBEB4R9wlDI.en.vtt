00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.309
 pork for using beef 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.989
 of its taste our favorite and many 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:52.940
 few people because when they bring the 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:56.870
 meat then drain in what is fat 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:01:00.559

 Spaghetti can use half a can of 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:25.610

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:35.530
 do not 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:46.190
 today there are people who already have nine 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:49.820
 figures and you do not see him in a dignified wedding 

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:54.560
 it is known if the person is to cook 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:57.230
 cook a lot so if I reaches

00:06:33.169 --> 00:06:35.830
 I love 

00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:01.639
 and remember that everything is cooked 

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:04.220
 there's nothing I can do for an hour 

00:07:01.639 --> 00:07:05.900
 what many people by habit if 

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:07.849
 you want it may be missing in the 

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:13.190
 freezer is not to cover with paper 

00:07:07.849 --> 00:07:15.949
 aluminum or you can also be in a 

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:17.360
 lid that is the mold and when you can 

00:07:15.949 --> 00:07:19.849
 have already freezer when you want 

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:21.620
 commercial this is taken out and you do not know 

00:07:19.849 --> 00:07:23.930
 wait for it to freeze a little and 

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:27.199
 then gave access to the temperature 

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:29.000
 of 350 degrees by the average of 30 to 40 

00:07:27.199 --> 00:07:30.409

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.050
 golden of what it is that everything is 

00:07:30.409 --> 00:07:35.270

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:44.240
