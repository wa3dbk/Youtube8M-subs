00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:23.070
 tutorial like psp total game youtube ha 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.830

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.830
 some good reason is not left 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.989
 start from scratch today I'm going to teach you to 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.470
 download and install your gene to release 

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:37.020
 your permanent psp in the description is 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:39.590
 the link of the official website of total p esp 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.590
 game 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:48.410
 just click on the version of your psp 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.089
 When you click on them, this will appear 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:53.160
 page 

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:55.730
 wait 7 seconds and they give you where 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:01:04.020
 says skip 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:07.230
 automatically start the download now 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:11.130
 that have downloaded it right click and 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:15.720
 extract here in my case the 6.35 gene 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:17.550
 because that's my version they will come out 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.940
 all these folders but only 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:23.720
 we will use the folder p esp we give it 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.720
 double click 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:37.380
 these two files will come out 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:39.980
 they cut and we go to the root of 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.980
 our memory 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.330
 p esp 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:56.300
 and stick once it's done 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.300
 next steps are with our p esp 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:03.060
 we go to game and we will see two 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:06.350
 files one called forget and another 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:09.909
 called fast recovery 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.909
 we start your bat 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:19.720
 we wait for the letters to come out 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:26.760
 white now we press x we ​​wait for 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:29.410
 that loads and we go to game 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:32.280
 when the gene is removed for some reason 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:36.520
 just install the fast recovery file 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:39.910
 We wait for it to load equal to our p 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:43.800
 esp is released we can check this 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.800
 because my games and my 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.120
 there is the prof gene but not what 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:54.760
 I recommend as it is in beta 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:57.700
 when the case of the 6.20 gene is 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:02.290
 put the permanent gene in the case of 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:04.480
 versions 6.39 and 6.60 the patch 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.540
 permanent can only be installed if your 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.180
 plate is not damn 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:13.079
 I explain to you the cursed plates are from 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:15.209
 psp-3000 and if your psp is one of these two 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:18.180
 models do not try it or you'll have a 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:21.810
 fancy paperweight in case you 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:24.269
 psps to 1000 is fully compatible in 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.950
 case that your psps to 2000 you have to 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:30.750
 verify that the plate model that 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:33.870
 bring your ps psa of 88 v2 or lower in 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.849

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.980
 identify the model of your plate you 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:40.139
 I leave in the description of the video a 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:43.069
 application which identifies the model 

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:46.310
 of your plate just right click right 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:46.310
 extract here 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:04:07.349
 Copy the application and paste it into 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:10.819
 Game folder to the memory stick 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:10.819
 we start and it will come out like this 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:18.360
 this is the model of your place as you see 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.340
