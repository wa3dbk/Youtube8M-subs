hello<00:00:10.230> everybody<00:00:10.559> rabbits<00:00:11.490> mower<00:00:11.759> here<00:00:12.179> and

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
hello everybody rabbits mower here and

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.020 
hello everybody rabbits mower here and
this<00:00:12.750> is<00:00:12.900> a<00:00:13.049> tutorial<00:00:13.500> for<00:00:14.040> my<00:00:14.340> lossless

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
this is a tutorial for my lossless

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.720 
this is a tutorial for my lossless
cobblestone<00:00:15.599> generator<00:00:15.630> and<00:00:16.369> what<00:00:17.369> I<00:00:17.400> mean<00:00:17.580> by

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
cobblestone generator and what I mean by

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.609 
cobblestone generator and what I mean by
lossless<00:00:18.300> is<00:00:18.510> in<00:00:18.869> a<00:00:18.930> normal<00:00:19.230> cobblestone

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
lossless is in a normal cobblestone

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.500 
lossless is in a normal cobblestone
generator<00:00:19.760> when<00:00:20.760> you're<00:00:20.880> breaking<00:00:21.270> the<00:00:21.359> piece

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
generator when you're breaking the piece

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:22.810 
generator when you're breaking the piece
of<00:00:21.660> cobblestone<00:00:21.840> you<00:00:22.260> have<00:00:22.380> to<00:00:22.500> worry<00:00:22.710> about

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:22.820 
of cobblestone you have to worry about

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.490 
of cobblestone you have to worry about
it<00:00:23.820> occasionally<00:00:24.480> goes<00:00:24.660> into<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:25.019> lava<00:00:25.289> to

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
it occasionally goes into the lava to

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.050 
it occasionally goes into the lava to
the<00:00:25.590> side<00:00:25.769> of<00:00:25.890> it<00:00:25.980> and<00:00:26.010> burns<00:00:26.430> up<00:00:26.640> and<00:00:26.699> you<00:00:26.849> lose

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
the side of it and burns up and you lose

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.339 
the side of it and burns up and you lose
it<00:00:27.210> you<00:00:27.330> actually<00:00:27.480> end<00:00:27.720> up<00:00:27.779> losing<00:00:27.960> quite<00:00:28.289> a

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
it you actually end up losing quite a

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.500 
it you actually end up losing quite a
bit<00:00:28.560> of<00:00:28.650> cobblestone<00:00:29.189> that<00:00:29.369> way<00:00:29.550> and<00:00:29.820> it<00:00:30.390> can

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
bit of cobblestone that way and it can

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.630 
bit of cobblestone that way and it can
be<00:00:30.599> pretty<00:00:30.750> frustrating<00:00:30.900> so<00:00:31.800> with<00:00:32.460> this

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
be pretty frustrating so with this

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.010 
be pretty frustrating so with this
design<00:00:33.059> we're<00:00:33.390> actually<00:00:33.510> going<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:33.870> be

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
design we're actually going to be

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.450 
design we're actually going to be
breaking<00:00:34.440> this<00:00:34.590> piece<00:00:34.829> of<00:00:34.980> cobblestone<00:00:35.160> here

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
breaking this piece of cobblestone here

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.060 
breaking this piece of cobblestone here
and<00:00:36.000> as<00:00:36.690> you<00:00:36.780> can<00:00:36.870> see<00:00:37.020> there's<00:00:37.200> no<00:00:37.380> lava<00:00:37.649> next

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
and as you can see there's no lava next

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.709 
and as you can see there's no lava next
to<00:00:38.129> it<00:00:38.250> so<00:00:38.430> it's<00:00:38.579> impossible<00:00:39.149> for<00:00:39.180> us<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:39.420> lose

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
to it so it's impossible for us to lose

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.709 
to it so it's impossible for us to lose
it<00:00:39.899> or<00:00:40.469> for<00:00:40.739> it<00:00:40.829> to<00:00:40.890> get<00:00:40.980> burned<00:00:41.250> up<00:00:41.460> and<00:00:41.790> the

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
it or for it to get burned up and the

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.000 
it or for it to get burned up and the
cobblestone<00:00:43.170> will<00:00:43.260> just<00:00:43.410> keep<00:00:43.530> coming<00:00:43.800> up<00:00:43.890> in

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
cobblestone will just keep coming up in

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.549 
cobblestone will just keep coming up in
front<00:00:44.190> of<00:00:44.250> us<00:00:44.370> here<00:00:44.870> first<00:00:45.870> a<00:00:46.050> break<00:00:46.289> and<00:00:46.469> we

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
front of us here first a break and we

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.290 
front of us here first a break and we
don't<00:00:46.710> have<00:00:46.800> to<00:00:46.920> worry<00:00:47.129> at<00:00:47.430> all<00:00:47.489> about<00:00:47.730> any<00:00:48.180> of

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
don't have to worry at all about any of

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.639 
don't have to worry at all about any of
it<00:00:48.450> falling<00:00:48.660> down<00:00:48.899> into<00:00:49.020> that<00:00:49.230> lava<00:00:49.379> there

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
it falling down into that lava there

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.650 
it falling down into that lava there
especially<00:00:50.370> since<00:00:50.550> we<00:00:50.820> have<00:00:50.969> our<00:00:51.120> slab<00:00:51.449> here

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
especially since we have our slab here

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.959 
especially since we have our slab here
to<00:00:51.989> stop<00:00:52.199> it<00:00:52.230> from<00:00:52.469> falling<00:00:53.340> off<00:00:53.460> to<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.730> side

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
to stop it from falling off to the side

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.510 
to stop it from falling off to the side
over<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.390> top<00:00:54.570> there<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:55.250> it's<00:00:56.250> really

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
over the top there and it's really

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.400 
over the top there and it's really
simple<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:57.000> build<00:00:57.149> it's<00:00:57.570> just<00:00:57.930> basically<00:00:58.289> a

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
simple to build it's just basically a

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.459 
simple to build it's just basically a
piston<00:00:58.920> and<00:00:59.129> for<00:00:59.489> repeaters<00:00:59.969> it's<00:01:00.780> very<00:01:01.199> easy

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
piston and for repeaters it's very easy

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.609 
piston and for repeaters it's very easy
and<00:01:01.829> that's<00:01:02.579> why<00:01:02.730> I<00:01:02.760> like<00:01:02.969> it<00:01:03.000> so<00:01:03.149> much<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.690> if

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
and that's why I like it so much and if

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.080 
and that's why I like it so much and if
you're<00:01:04.739> wondering<00:01:05.010> what<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.280> furnace<00:01:05.729> is<00:01:05.880> for

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
you're wondering what the furnace is for

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.240 
you're wondering what the furnace is for
that<00:01:06.330> has<00:01:06.450> two<00:01:06.720> reasons<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.710> first<00:01:07.890> is<00:01:08.100> to

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
that has two reasons the first is to

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.370 
that has two reasons the first is to
stop<00:01:08.490> by<00:01:08.640> piston<00:01:08.939> from<00:01:09.299> pushing<00:01:09.750> up<00:01:09.869> a<00:01:09.990> giant

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
stop by piston from pushing up a giant

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.340 
stop by piston from pushing up a giant
stack<00:01:10.619> of<00:01:10.650> cobblestone<00:01:11.369> since<00:01:12.270> it<00:01:13.049> can't

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
stack of cobblestone since it can't

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.620 
stack of cobblestone since it can't
Pistons<00:01:13.979> can't<00:01:14.250> push<00:01:14.460> furnaces<00:01:15.000> so<00:01:15.030> that<00:01:15.420> just

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
Pistons can't push furnaces so that just

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.899 
Pistons can't push furnaces so that just
stops<00:01:15.900> as<00:01:16.140> it<00:01:16.290> pushes<00:01:16.470> to<00:01:16.740> that<00:01:16.890> one<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:17.250> the

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
stops as it pushes to that one and the

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.820 
stops as it pushes to that one and the
other<00:01:18.030> reason<00:01:18.210> is<00:01:18.450> since<00:01:19.290> we<00:01:19.380> have<00:01:19.500> a<00:01:19.530> furnace

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
other reason is since we have a furnace

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.050 
other reason is since we have a furnace
here<00:01:19.979> we<00:01:20.040> can<00:01:20.159> actually<00:01:20.369> keep<00:01:20.520> it<00:01:20.640> stocked<00:01:20.909> up

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
here we can actually keep it stocked up

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.850 
here we can actually keep it stocked up
with<00:01:21.240> coal<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:21.659> as<00:01:22.350> we're<00:01:22.560> sitting<00:01:22.830> here

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
with coal and as we're sitting here

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.350 
with coal and as we're sitting here
minding<00:01:23.250> our<00:01:23.430> cobblestone<00:01:24.000> we<00:01:24.119> can<00:01:24.240> actually

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
minding our cobblestone we can actually

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.270 
minding our cobblestone we can actually
just<00:01:24.650> occasionally<00:01:25.650> throw<00:01:25.830> in<00:01:25.979> a<00:01:26.040> stack<00:01:26.250> of

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
just occasionally throw in a stack of

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.859 
just occasionally throw in a stack of
cobblestone<00:01:26.880> here<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:27.210> turn<00:01:27.390> it<00:01:27.450> into<00:01:27.570> smooth

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
cobblestone here to turn it into smooth

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.840 
cobblestone here to turn it into smooth
stone<00:01:28.170> so<00:01:28.710> it<00:01:29.009> just<00:01:29.220> ends<00:01:29.400> up<00:01:29.430> being<00:01:29.490> really

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
stone so it just ends up being really

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.789 
stone so it just ends up being really
convenient<00:01:30.210> there<00:01:30.540> so<00:01:31.140> let's<00:01:31.470> get<00:01:31.590> into

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
convenient there so let's get into

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.850 
convenient there so let's get into
building<00:01:31.920> it<00:01:33.110> alright<00:01:34.110> so<00:01:34.350> to<00:01:34.409> start<00:01:34.500> building

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
building it alright so to start building

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:35.960 
building it alright so to start building
this<00:01:35.070> we're<00:01:35.220> going<00:01:35.340> to<00:01:35.400> need<00:01:35.520> everything<00:01:35.820> that

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
this we're going to need everything that

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.539 
this we're going to need everything that
I<00:01:36.119> have<00:01:36.270> in<00:01:36.390> my<00:01:36.509> inventory<00:01:36.869> right<00:01:37.350> now<00:01:37.549> so

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
I have in my inventory right now so

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.340 
I have in my inventory right now so
you're<00:01:38.970> going<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:39.119> need<00:01:39.420> ten<00:01:39.780> building<00:01:40.170> blocks

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
you're going to need ten building blocks

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.600 
you're going to need ten building blocks

solid<00:01:44.579> block<00:01:44.939> I<00:01:45.149> just<00:01:45.329> use<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.780> two<00:01:46.470> different

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
solid block I just use the two different

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.770 
solid block I just use the two different
types<00:01:47.520> of<00:01:47.610> glass<00:01:47.790> because<00:01:48.149> it<00:01:48.270> looks<00:01:48.450> cool<00:01:48.630> in

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
types of glass because it looks cool in

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.960 
types of glass because it looks cool in
the<00:01:48.869> end<00:01:48.990> and<00:01:49.220> these<00:01:50.220> slabs<00:01:50.430> can<00:01:50.700> be<00:01:50.790> whatever

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
the end and these slabs can be whatever

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.340 
the end and these slabs can be whatever
type<00:01:51.240> of<00:01:51.360> slab<00:01:51.570> that<00:01:51.750> you<00:01:51.840> want<00:01:51.990> as<00:01:52.049> well<00:01:52.200> those

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
type of slab that you want as well those

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.960 
type of slab that you want as well those
could<00:01:52.530> be<00:01:52.560> cobblestone<00:01:53.130> slabs<00:01:53.340> if<00:01:53.700> you<00:01:53.790> want

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
could be cobblestone slabs if you want

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.090 
could be cobblestone slabs if you want
it<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.329> you<00:01:55.110> just<00:01:55.229> need<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.409> rest<00:01:55.799> of<00:01:55.979> these

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
it and you just need the rest of these

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.090 
it and you just need the rest of these
items<00:01:56.430> here<00:01:56.670> so<00:01:56.820> to<00:01:57.540> start<00:01:57.810> building<00:01:57.990> it<00:01:58.229> we're

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
items here so to start building it we're

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.310 
items here so to start building it we're
going<00:01:59.219> to<00:01:59.369> build<00:02:00.000> what<00:02:00.329> a<00:02:00.360> normal<00:02:00.630> cobblestone

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
going to build what a normal cobblestone

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.840 
going to build what a normal cobblestone
generator<00:02:01.350> would<00:02:02.009> be<00:02:02.219> so<00:02:02.490> we're<00:02:02.610> going<00:02:02.729> to

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
generator would be so we're going to

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.539 
generator would be so we're going to
build<00:02:03.030> our<00:02:03.180> area<00:02:03.509> for<00:02:04.500> our<00:02:04.710> water<00:02:05.009> and<00:02:05.280> the

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
build our area for our water and the

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.800 
build our area for our water and the
area<00:02:05.820> for<00:02:06.090> our<00:02:06.119> lava<00:02:07.849> like<00:02:08.849> this<00:02:09.090> and<00:02:09.300> before

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
area for our lava like this and before

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.390 
area for our lava like this and before
we<00:02:10.050> place<00:02:10.259> our<00:02:10.410> water<00:02:10.590> or<00:02:10.709> lava<00:02:10.950> we're<00:02:11.250> going

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
we place our water or lava we're going

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.580 
we place our water or lava we're going
to<00:02:11.489> put<00:02:11.670> a<00:02:11.700> piston<00:02:12.150> in<00:02:12.270> the<00:02:12.300> center<00:02:12.629> here

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
to put a piston in the center here

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.070 
to put a piston in the center here
and<00:02:13.680> now<00:02:14.040> we<00:02:14.099> can<00:02:14.430> break<00:02:15.330> the<00:02:15.510> whole<00:02:15.660> down<00:02:15.840> for

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
and now we can break the whole down for

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.830 
and now we can break the whole down for
the<00:02:16.140> water<00:02:16.319> and<00:02:17.180> place<00:02:18.180> our<00:02:18.360> lava<00:02:18.540> on<00:02:18.720> the

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
the water and place our lava on the

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.240 
the water and place our lava on the
other<00:02:18.930> side<00:02:19.170> we<00:02:19.290> should<00:02:19.349> get<00:02:19.620> the<00:02:19.739> cobblestone

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
other side we should get the cobblestone

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.059 
other side we should get the cobblestone
in<00:02:20.370> the<00:02:20.459> center<00:02:20.840> all<00:02:21.840> right<00:02:22.020> and<00:02:22.230> then<00:02:22.980> I'm

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
in the center all right and then I'm

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:24.920 
in the center all right and then I'm
going<00:02:23.250> to<00:02:23.280> put<00:02:23.520> these<00:02:23.700> slabs<00:02:24.150> over<00:02:24.540> the<00:02:24.630> top<00:02:24.780> of

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
going to put these slabs over the top of

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.410 
going to put these slabs over the top of
the<00:02:25.020> water<00:02:25.260> and<00:02:25.380> the<00:02:25.830> lava<00:02:26.069> here<00:02:26.430> just<00:02:27.300> so<00:02:27.390> we

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
the water and the lava here just so we

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:28.580 
the water and the lava here just so we
don't<00:02:27.510> have<00:02:27.720> to<00:02:27.810> worry<00:02:28.020> about<00:02:28.080> the

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
don't have to worry about the

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.170 
don't have to worry about the
cobblestone<00:02:29.220> falling<00:02:29.550> into<00:02:29.700> either<00:02:29.760> of<00:02:29.970> those

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
cobblestone falling into either of those

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.009 
cobblestone falling into either of those
as<00:02:30.450> I<00:02:30.599> said<00:02:30.780> earlier<00:02:31.080> and<00:02:32.060> from<00:02:33.060> here<00:02:33.390> I'm

as I said earlier and from here I'm

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:35.540 
as I said earlier and from here I'm
going<00:02:34.170> to<00:02:34.230> place<00:02:34.410> another<00:02:34.709> solid<00:02:35.099> block<00:02:35.370> on

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
going to place another solid block on

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.729 
going to place another solid block on
top<00:02:35.700> of<00:02:35.849> this<00:02:35.940> cobblestone<00:02:36.480> here<00:02:36.510> and<00:02:36.930> place

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
top of this cobblestone here and place

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:39.290 
top of this cobblestone here and place
our<00:02:37.890> furnace<00:02:38.250> and<00:02:38.430> just<00:02:38.640> leave<00:02:38.849> that<00:02:39.030> block

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
our furnace and just leave that block

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.199 
our furnace and just leave that block
there<00:02:39.540> for<00:02:39.750> now<00:02:39.870> and<00:02:40.790> next<00:02:41.790> to<00:02:42.000> where<00:02:42.180> our

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
there for now and next to where our

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:43.580 
there for now and next to where our
piston<00:02:42.720> is<00:02:42.840> here<00:02:43.019> we're<00:02:43.140> going<00:02:43.230> to<00:02:43.290> dig<00:02:43.440> down

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
piston is here we're going to dig down

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.620 
piston is here we're going to dig down
two<00:02:43.860> blocks<00:02:44.099> and<00:02:44.340> from<00:02:45.209> here<00:02:45.360> we're<00:02:45.480> going<00:02:45.569> to

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
two blocks and from here we're going to

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.430 
two blocks and from here we're going to
dig<00:02:45.840> a<00:02:46.080> four<00:02:46.440> by<00:02:46.590> two<00:02:46.650> area<00:02:47.130> so<00:02:47.370> for<00:02:47.730> long<00:02:48.440> two

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
dig a four by two area so for long two

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.350 
dig a four by two area so for long two
wide<00:02:49.650> and<00:02:50.190> that's<00:02:50.370> going<00:02:50.580> to<00:02:50.670> go<00:02:50.790> down<00:02:51.060> two

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
wide and that's going to go down two

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.390 
wide and that's going to go down two
blocks<00:02:51.540> as<00:02:51.810> well<00:02:51.840> so<00:02:52.739> that<00:02:52.860> we<00:02:52.950> can<00:02:53.040> cover<00:02:53.190> it

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
blocks as well so that we can cover it

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.660 
blocks as well so that we can cover it
up<00:02:53.459> with<00:02:53.640> grass<00:02:53.970> later<00:02:54.269> on<00:02:54.860> so<00:02:55.860> here<00:02:56.400> we<00:02:56.519> need

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
up with grass later on so here we need

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.390 
up with grass later on so here we need
three<00:02:57.269> redstone<00:02:57.720> dust<00:02:57.930> and<00:02:58.260> two<00:02:59.190> redstone

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
three redstone dust and two redstone

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.030 
three redstone dust and two redstone
dust<00:02:59.700> on<00:02:59.880> the<00:02:59.970> other<00:03:00.090> side<00:03:00.560> and<00:03:01.560> starting<00:03:01.950> on

dust on the other side and starting on

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.380 
dust on the other side and starting on
this<00:03:02.190> right<00:03:02.370> side<00:03:02.610> we're<00:03:02.790> going<00:03:02.880> to<00:03:02.940> put<00:03:03.150> two

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
this right side we're going to put two

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.039 
this right side we're going to put two
repeaters<00:03:03.690> set<00:03:04.500> to<00:03:04.620> four<00:03:04.860> ticks<00:03:05.040> each<00:03:05.959> on<00:03:06.959> the

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049 
repeaters set to four ticks each on the

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:07.910 
repeaters set to four ticks each on the
other<00:03:07.170> side<00:03:07.380> we're<00:03:07.470> going<00:03:07.560> to<00:03:07.620> do<00:03:07.709> two

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
other side we're going to do two

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.559 
other side we're going to do two
repeaters<00:03:08.310> again<00:03:08.610> and<00:03:08.790> the<00:03:09.120> first<00:03:09.330> one<00:03:09.450> will

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
repeaters again and the first one will

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:10.850 
repeaters again and the first one will
be<00:03:09.599> set<00:03:09.810> to<00:03:09.930> four<00:03:10.140> and<00:03:10.349> the<00:03:10.440> second<00:03:10.739> will<00:03:10.830> be

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
be set to four and the second will be

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.360 
be set to four and the second will be
set<00:03:11.160> to<00:03:11.370> three<00:03:11.700> and<00:03:11.910> then<00:03:12.870> get<00:03:13.500> your<00:03:13.739> way<00:03:13.980> back

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
set to three and then get your way back

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.280 
set to three and then get your way back
out<00:03:14.519> of<00:03:14.549> there<00:03:14.760> and<00:03:14.910> that's<00:03:15.060> good<00:03:15.299> to<00:03:15.420> go<00:03:15.599> so

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
out of there and that's good to go so

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.390 
out of there and that's good to go so
it's<00:03:16.440> going<00:03:16.590> to<00:03:16.650> stop<00:03:16.860> down<00:03:17.010> there<00:03:17.190> we<00:03:17.280> can

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
it's going to stop down there we can

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.509 
it's going to stop down there we can
cover<00:03:17.579> back<00:03:17.820> up<00:03:18.000> with<00:03:18.150> our<00:03:18.239> grass<00:03:18.540> or<00:03:18.810> dirt<00:03:18.840> and

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 
cover back up with our grass or dirt and

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:21.680 
cover back up with our grass or dirt and
that's<00:03:20.519> good<00:03:20.670> to<00:03:20.760> go<00:03:20.850> there<00:03:21.090> so<00:03:21.299> now<00:03:21.420> we<00:03:21.480> just

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
that's good to go there so now we just

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.270 
that's good to go there so now we just
need<00:03:21.750> to<00:03:21.930> kick-start<00:03:22.170> our<00:03:22.470> system<00:03:22.829> by<00:03:22.980> getting

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
need to kick-start our system by getting

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.640 
need to kick-start our system by getting
a<00:03:23.370> stone<00:03:23.790> button<00:03:24.150> and<00:03:24.299> make<00:03:25.230> sure<00:03:25.380> it<00:03:25.500> is<00:03:25.620> a

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
a stone button and make sure it is a

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.349 
a stone button and make sure it is a
stone<00:03:26.070> not<00:03:26.370> wooden<00:03:26.820> because<00:03:27.150> they<00:03:27.269> have

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:27.359 
stone not wooden because they have

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:29.330 
stone not wooden because they have
different<00:03:27.540> timings<00:03:28.049> so<00:03:28.200> we're<00:03:29.190> going<00:03:29.280> to

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
different timings so we're going to

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.039 
different timings so we're going to
place<00:03:29.579> that<00:03:29.609> right<00:03:30.060> here<00:03:30.239> between<00:03:30.390> this<00:03:30.720> area

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
place that right here between this area

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:33.020 
place that right here between this area
here<00:03:31.260> and<00:03:31.380> right<00:03:32.130> click<00:03:32.160> that<00:03:32.340> that'll<00:03:32.790> start

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
here and right click that that'll start

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.030 
here and right click that that'll start
up<00:03:33.150> your<00:03:33.299> redstone<00:03:33.540> timer<00:03:33.989> there<00:03:34.290> as<00:03:34.440> we<00:03:34.920> can

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
up your redstone timer there as we can

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.699 
up your redstone timer there as we can
see<00:03:35.160> down<00:03:35.310> here<00:03:35.750> now<00:03:36.750> when<00:03:37.019> we<00:03:37.140> break<00:03:37.290> this<00:03:37.500> top

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
see down here now when we break this top

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:40.009 
see down here now when we break this top
piece<00:03:37.920> the<00:03:38.790> whole<00:03:38.940> system<00:03:39.299> is<00:03:39.359> good<00:03:39.510> to<00:03:39.630> go<00:03:39.750> we

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
piece the whole system is good to go we

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:42.020 
piece the whole system is good to go we
can<00:03:40.049> start<00:03:40.380> breaking<00:03:40.709> up<00:03:40.769> the<00:03:41.430> cobblestone<00:03:41.910> as

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
can start breaking up the cobblestone as

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.250 
can start breaking up the cobblestone as
quickly<00:03:42.239> as<00:03:42.450> you<00:03:42.569> wanted<00:03:42.840> and<00:03:42.989> it<00:03:43.109> will

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
quickly as you wanted and it will

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.319 
quickly as you wanted and it will
generate<00:03:44.160> it<00:03:44.310> as<00:03:44.400> quickly<00:03:44.639> as<00:03:44.880> we<00:03:44.910> can<00:03:45.120> break

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:45.329 
generate it as quickly as we can break

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:47.449 
generate it as quickly as we can break
it<00:03:45.359> and<00:03:45.600> push<00:03:45.780> it<00:03:45.810> back<00:03:45.930> up<00:03:46.230> and<00:03:46.650> it's<00:03:47.190> good<00:03:47.340> to

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
it and push it back up and it's good to

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.699 
it and push it back up and it's good to
go<00:03:47.639> your<00:03:47.850> whole<00:03:47.970> system's<00:03:48.359> ready<00:03:48.750> and<00:03:49.170> it's

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
go your whole system's ready and it's

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:51.530 
go your whole system's ready and it's
pretty<00:03:49.859> much<00:03:49.920> just<00:03:50.459> that<00:03:50.670> it's<00:03:50.850> really<00:03:51.269> simple

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
pretty much just that it's really simple

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.420 
pretty much just that it's really simple
again<00:03:51.959> that's<00:03:52.170> why<00:03:52.350> I<00:03:52.380> like<00:03:52.680> this<00:03:52.859> design<00:03:53.190> it's

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
again that's why I like this design it's

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.759 
again that's why I like this design it's
really<00:03:54.269> easy<00:03:54.450> to<00:03:54.630> build<00:03:54.810> especially<00:03:55.200> early<00:03:55.739> on

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
really easy to build especially early on

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:57.259 
really easy to build especially early on
in<00:03:55.980> the<00:03:56.100> game<00:03:56.130> you<00:03:56.400> don't<00:03:56.579> need<00:03:57.030> many

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
in the game you don't need many

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:58.879 
in the game you don't need many
resources<00:03:57.750> for<00:03:57.870> it<00:03:58.079> and<00:03:58.200> it's<00:03:58.290> very<00:03:58.350> compact

00:03:58.879 --> 00:03:58.889 
resources for it and it's very compact

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:00.410 
resources for it and it's very compact
and<00:03:59.579> you<00:03:59.700> can<00:03:59.790> cover<00:03:59.970> up<00:04:00.090> all<00:04:00.239> of<00:04:00.329> your

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
and you can cover up all of your

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.170 
and you can cover up all of your
redstone<00:04:01.040> the<00:04:02.040> only<00:04:02.340> other<00:04:02.459> thing<00:04:02.730> is<00:04:02.970> if

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
redstone the only other thing is if

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:04.910 
redstone the only other thing is if
you're<00:04:03.810> like<00:04:04.019> me<00:04:04.260> and<00:04:04.319> you<00:04:04.440> don't<00:04:04.620> like<00:04:04.769> to

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
you're like me and you don't like to

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.379 
you're like me and you don't like to
have<00:04:05.069> red<00:04:05.370> some<00:04:05.609> clocks<00:04:05.880> running<00:04:06.150> in<00:04:06.299> your

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:06.389 
have red some clocks running in your

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:08.479 
have red some clocks running in your
world<00:04:06.600> all<00:04:06.750> the<00:04:06.900> time<00:04:07.109> you<00:04:07.829> might<00:04:08.069> want<00:04:08.250> to<00:04:08.340> put

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
world all the time you might want to put

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:10.490 
world all the time you might want to put
a<00:04:08.519> hole<00:04:08.790> over<00:04:09.660> one<00:04:09.810> of<00:04:09.900> the<00:04:09.959> corners<00:04:10.319> where

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
a hole over one of the corners where

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:15.140 
a hole over one of the corners where
there's<00:04:10.680> dust<00:04:10.980> it<00:04:11.250> and<00:04:11.459> grab<00:04:12.329> a<00:04:12.359> ladder<00:04:14.150> we

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
there's dust it and grab a ladder we

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.719 
there's dust it and grab a ladder we
toss<00:04:15.389> this<00:04:15.630> in<00:04:15.690> here<00:04:16.079> and<00:04:16.250> now<00:04:17.250> if<00:04:17.459> you<00:04:17.579> ever

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:17.729 
toss this in here and now if you ever

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:19.039 
toss this in here and now if you ever
wanted<00:04:17.940> to<00:04:18.000> turn<00:04:18.239> the<00:04:18.329> system<00:04:18.479> off<00:04:18.720> all<00:04:18.959> you

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
wanted to turn the system off all you

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:21.680 
wanted to turn the system off all you
have<00:04:19.139> to<00:04:19.200> do<00:04:19.350> is<00:04:20.130> go<00:04:20.340> down<00:04:20.459> in<00:04:20.669> here<00:04:21.000> break<00:04:21.539> the

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
have to do is go down in here break the

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.330 
have to do is go down in here break the
redstone<00:04:22.049> out<00:04:22.229> wait<00:04:22.440> for<00:04:22.620> it<00:04:22.710> to<00:04:22.800> stop<00:04:23.070> and

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
redstone out wait for it to stop and

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.810 
redstone out wait for it to stop and
then<00:04:23.849> place<00:04:24.090> the<00:04:24.270> redstone<00:04:24.599> dust<00:04:24.750> again<00:04:24.930> and

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
then place the redstone dust again and

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.010 
then place the redstone dust again and
when<00:04:26.000> you<00:04:26.060> want<00:04:26.240> to<00:04:26.270> turn<00:04:26.420> it<00:04:26.570> on<00:04:26.660> you<00:04:26.810> can<00:04:26.870> just

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
when you want to turn it on you can just

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:28.870 
when you want to turn it on you can just
start<00:04:27.290> the<00:04:27.350> system<00:04:27.590> again<00:04:27.980> but<00:04:28.580> again<00:04:28.760> that's

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
start the system again but again that's

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.820 
start the system again but again that's
only<00:04:29.180> if<00:04:29.360> you<00:04:29.480> don't<00:04:29.690> like<00:04:29.990> to<00:04:30.140> have<00:04:30.320> redstone

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:30.830 
only if you don't like to have redstone

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:32.350 
only if you don't like to have redstone
clocks<00:04:31.040> running<00:04:31.340> in<00:04:31.430> your<00:04:31.520> world<00:04:31.730> if<00:04:32.150> you

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
clocks running in your world if you

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:33.550 
clocks running in your world if you
wanted<00:04:32.630> you<00:04:32.750> could<00:04:32.870> just<00:04:33.050> leave<00:04:33.230> this<00:04:33.350> running

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 
wanted you could just leave this running

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.800 
wanted you could just leave this running
and<00:04:33.830> that's<00:04:34.370> no<00:04:34.580> problem<00:04:34.730> either<00:04:34.970> so<00:04:35.480> that's

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
and that's no problem either so that's

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:36.910 
and that's no problem either so that's
