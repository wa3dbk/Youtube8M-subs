to<00:01:39.440> make<00:01:39.800> because<00:01:40.040> you<00:01:40.190> can't<00:01:40.460> use<00:01:40.640> like<00:01:40.670> gluey

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
to make because you can't use like gluey

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.520 
to make because you can't use like gluey
where<00:01:41.330> a<00:01:41.360> taper<00:01:41.570> anything<00:01:41.900> you<00:01:41.960> have<00:01:42.140> to<00:01:42.290> tie
