00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
it was more difficult than you

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.090 
it was more difficult than you
anticipated<00:01:49.590> no<00:01:50.369> I<00:01:50.399> mean<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.479> sort<00:01:51.720> of

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
anticipated no I mean the the sort of

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.770 
anticipated no I mean the the sort of
conditioning<00:01:53.100> aspect<00:01:53.549> of<00:01:53.700> it<00:01:53.820> was<00:01:54.090> that's

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
conditioning aspect of it was that's

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.330

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
challenge to try and rise to and then

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.490 
challenge to try and rise to and then
just<00:02:00.630> you<00:02:00.719> know<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:00.930> first<00:02:01.110> few<00:02:01.200> times

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
just you know the first few times

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.959

sparring and getting popped in the face

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.789 
sparring and getting popped in the face
that's<00:02:03.299> that's<00:02:03.780> something<00:02:03.960> to<00:02:04.110> adapt<00:02:04.350> to<00:02:04.560> but

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
that's that's something to adapt to but

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.859 
that's that's something to adapt to but
you<00:02:05.460> get<00:02:05.610> used<00:02:05.759> to<00:02:05.820> it<00:02:05.880> pretty<00:02:06.119> quick<00:02:06.299> do<00:02:06.810> you

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
you get used to it pretty quick do you

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.330 
you get used to it pretty quick do you
think<00:02:07.110> this<00:02:07.320> is<00:02:07.439> something<00:02:07.590> you'll<00:02:07.860> carry<00:02:08.220> on

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340

or<00:02:08.700> is<00:02:08.759> that<00:02:08.879> gonna<00:02:09.060> be<00:02:09.239> I<00:02:09.270> guess<00:02:09.750> conducive

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
or is that gonna be I guess conducive

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.400 
or is that gonna be I guess conducive
that's<00:02:10.979> how<00:02:11.580> you<00:02:11.640> perform<00:02:11.879> on<00:02:12.239> November<00:02:12.599> 1st
