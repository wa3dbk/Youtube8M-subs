earlier in truth you earlier but great

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.680 
earlier in truth you earlier but great
performance<00:02:20.890> also<00:02:21.130> he's<00:02:21.940> now<00:02:22.180> the<00:02:22.239> number<00:02:22.660> one

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
performance also he's now the number one

contender<00:02:23.080> to<00:02:23.560> Juan<00:02:23.800> Diaz<00:02:24.040> his<00:02:24.489> WBO<00:02:25.090> title<00:02:25.209> and

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
contender to Juan Diaz his WBO title and

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.210 
contender to Juan Diaz his WBO title and
and<00:02:27.010> well<00:02:27.850> he<00:02:28.030> was<00:02:28.180> already<00:02:28.450> that<00:02:28.810> ok<00:02:29.530> again<00:02:29.920> ok

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
and well he was already that ok again ok

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.660 
and well he was already that ok again ok
so<00:02:30.610> it<00:02:31.120> was<00:02:31.300> probably<00:02:31.709> he'll<00:02:32.709> move<00:02:32.890> up<00:02:33.130> in<00:02:33.610> the

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
so it was probably he'll move up in the

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.759 
so it was probably he'll move up in the
other<00:02:33.940> bodies<00:02:34.390> and<00:02:34.630> very<00:02:34.840> possibly<00:02:35.050> in<00:02:35.680> a
