00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.740 

there<00:01:35.479> we<00:01:35.570> go<00:01:35.750> one<00:01:36.229> more

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
there we go one more

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.760 
there we go one more
and<00:01:38.140> now<00:01:38.530> we'll<00:01:38.740> show<00:01:38.830> you<00:01:38.950> the<00:01:39.130> next<00:01:39.520> step

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
and now we'll show you the next step

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.990 
and now we'll show you the next step
okay<00:01:41.770> we<00:01:41.890> have<00:01:42.010> the<00:01:42.130> extractor<00:01:42.640> here<00:01:42.760> and<00:01:42.940> the

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
okay we have the extractor here and the

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.520 
okay we have the extractor here and the
goal<00:01:43.150> is<00:01:43.180> to<00:01:43.510> put<00:01:43.630> the<00:01:43.720> frames<00:01:43.900> in<00:01:44.110> there<00:01:44.260> so<00:01:44.410> we

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
goal is to put the frames in there so we

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.590 
goal is to put the frames in there so we
can<00:01:44.560> spin<00:01:44.830> out<00:01:44.890> the<00:01:45.070> honey<00:01:45.220> and<00:01:45.460> but<00:01:46.270> before<00:01:46.360> we

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
can spin out the honey and but before we

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.930 
can spin out the honey and but before we
can<00:01:46.690> do<00:01:46.810> that<00:01:47.100> you<00:01:48.100> can<00:01:48.220> see<00:01:48.460> that<00:01:48.730> those

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:48.940 
can do that you can see that those

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.270 
can do that you can see that those
frames<00:01:49.720> are<00:01:50.500> capped<00:01:51.220> that's<00:01:51.640> called<00:01:51.850> capped

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
frames are capped that's called capped

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.550 
frames are capped that's called capped
with<00:01:54.280> wax<00:01:54.610> the<00:01:55.360> honey<00:01:55.540> is<00:01:55.630> underneath<00:01:55.900> so<00:01:56.440> we

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
with wax the honey is underneath so we

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.020 
with wax the honey is underneath so we
have<00:01:56.680> to<00:01:56.770> do<00:01:56.860> is<00:01:56.980> something<00:01:57.310> some<00:01:57.580> way<00:01:57.700> we<00:01:57.880> have

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
have to do is something some way we have

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:59.820 
have to do is something some way we have
to<00:01:58.120> get<00:01:58.240> that<00:01:58.390> just<00:01:58.900> the<00:01:58.990> tops<00:01:59.260> off<00:01:59.530> of<00:01:59.710> those

00:01:59.820 --> 00:01:59.830 
to get that just the tops off of those

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:01.230 
to get that just the tops off of those
there's<00:02:00.580> a<00:02:00.610> lot<00:02:00.700> of<00:02:00.760> different<00:02:00.970> ways<00:02:01.030> you<00:02:01.120> can

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
there's a lot of different ways you can

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.940 
there's a lot of different ways you can
do<00:02:01.360> that<00:02:01.390> and<00:02:01.870> what<00:02:02.470> we're<00:02:02.590> going<00:02:02.740> to<00:02:02.800> do<00:02:02.860> is

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
do that and what we're going to do is

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.590 
do that and what we're going to do is
we're<00:02:03.040> going<00:02:03.070> to<00:02:03.220> heat<00:02:03.310> up<00:02:03.340> a<00:02:03.460> knife<00:02:03.610> and<00:02:04.540> that

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
we're going to heat up a knife and that

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.690 
we're going to heat up a knife and that
hot<00:02:05.260> knife<00:02:05.470> is<00:02:05.710> slide<00:02:05.950> right<00:02:06.190> over<00:02:06.220> there<00:02:06.580> and

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
hot knife is slide right over there and

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.990 
hot knife is slide right over there and
I<00:02:06.760> will<00:02:06.910> show<00:02:07.090> you<00:02:07.150> that<00:02:07.510> process<00:02:08.790> yeah<00:02:09.790> let<00:02:09.970> me

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
I will show you that process yeah let me

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.640 
I will show you that process yeah let me
give<00:02:10.179> a<00:02:10.209> so<00:02:10.750> well<00:02:11.110> anyway<00:02:11.350> I<00:02:11.380> don't<00:02:11.500> have<00:02:11.590> to

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
give a so well anyway I don't have to

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.410 
give a so well anyway I don't have to
show<00:02:11.770> you<00:02:11.860> this<00:02:11.980> whole<00:02:12.100> process<00:02:12.280> but<00:02:12.940> you<00:02:13.120> so

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
show you this whole process but you so

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.990 
show you this whole process but you so
you<00:02:13.480> slide<00:02:13.840> the<00:02:13.959> hot<00:02:14.080> knife<00:02:14.230> over<00:02:14.500> the<00:02:15.000> over

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
you slide the hot knife over the over

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.150 
you slide the hot knife over the over
the<00:02:16.090> comb<00:02:16.300> to<00:02:16.780> uncap<00:02:17.230> and<00:02:17.530> you<00:02:17.890> do<00:02:17.980> both<00:02:18.100> sides

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
the comb to uncap and you do both sides

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.760 
the comb to uncap and you do both sides
of<00:02:18.610> course<00:02:18.790> and<00:02:19.570> then<00:02:19.840> you<00:02:20.050> put<00:02:20.260> it<00:02:20.350> inside<00:02:20.590> the

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
of course and then you put it inside the

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.040 
of course and then you put it inside the
extractor<00:02:21.250> as<00:02:22.180> you<00:02:22.330> can<00:02:22.450> see<00:02:22.600> we<00:02:22.690> already<00:02:22.810> have

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
extractor as you can see we already have

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.949 
extractor as you can see we already have
one<00:02:23.230> in<00:02:23.350> there<00:02:23.850> and<00:02:24.850> then<00:02:25.090> you<00:02:25.330> hire<00:02:25.600> somebody

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
one in there and then you hire somebody

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:30.090 
one in there and then you hire somebody
to<00:02:27.030> turn<00:02:28.030> the<00:02:28.209> handle<00:02:28.600> and<00:02:29.140> what<00:02:29.650> happens<00:02:29.980> is

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
to turn the handle and what happens is

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.630 
to turn the handle and what happens is
the<00:02:30.310> honey<00:02:30.930> will<00:02:31.930> just<00:02:32.620> by<00:02:32.770> the<00:02:32.830> force<00:02:33.220> of<00:02:33.400> the

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
the honey will just by the force of the

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.770 
the honey will just by the force of the
centrifugal<00:02:34.000> force<00:02:34.060> will<00:02:34.959> spin<00:02:35.380> off<00:02:35.410> of<00:02:35.620> this

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
centrifugal force will spin off of this

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.930 
centrifugal force will spin off of this
accumulate<00:02:37.780> on<00:02:37.810> the<00:02:37.959> side<00:02:38.230> and<00:02:38.500> run<00:02:38.830> down<00:02:39.160> and

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
accumulate on the side and run down and

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:41.460 
accumulate on the side and run down and
the<00:02:40.090> way<00:02:40.180> this<00:02:40.360> is<00:02:40.510> shaped<00:02:40.690> its<00:02:40.870> cone-shaped

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
the way this is shaped its cone-shaped

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.680 
the way this is shaped its cone-shaped
it's<00:02:41.620> like<00:02:41.709> an<00:02:41.830> inverted<00:02:42.040> cone<00:02:42.390> and<00:02:43.390> it'll

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
it's like an inverted cone and it'll

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.229 
it's like an inverted cone and it'll
collect<00:02:43.989> in<00:02:44.230> the<00:02:44.320> bottom<00:02:44.680> there<00:02:44.890> and<00:02:45.100> then<00:02:46.090> you

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
collect in the bottom there and then you

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:49.560 
collect in the bottom there and then you
can<00:02:47.220> you<00:02:48.220> know<00:02:48.340> open<00:02:48.790> up<00:02:48.850> the<00:02:48.970> spigot<00:02:49.269> and<00:02:49.390> fill

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
can you know open up the spigot and fill

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.890 
can you know open up the spigot and fill
up<00:02:49.690> jugs<00:02:50.290> of<00:02:50.440> jars<00:02:50.650> with<00:02:50.830> it<00:02:50.980> even<00:02:51.310> though

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
up jugs of jars with it even though

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.050 
up jugs of jars with it even though
typically<00:02:52.900> people<00:02:53.230> use<00:02:53.350> a<00:02:53.380> five-gallon

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
typically people use a five-gallon

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:00.100 
typically people use a five-gallon
food-grade<00:02:56.060> jugs<00:02:58.209> uncapped<00:02:59.209> it<00:02:59.420> the<00:02:59.810> honey's

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
food-grade jugs uncapped it the honey's

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:01.570 
food-grade jugs uncapped it the honey's
just<00:03:00.440> leaking<00:03:00.799> out<00:03:00.950> and<00:03:01.129> now<00:03:01.190> we<00:03:01.250> just<00:03:01.459> put

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
just leaking out and now we just put

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.670 
just leaking out and now we just put
that<00:03:01.640> frame<00:03:01.940> right<00:03:02.569> into<00:03:02.810> the<00:03:02.930> extractor<00:03:03.470> and

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
that frame right into the extractor and

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.399 
that frame right into the extractor and
now<00:03:04.640> we<00:03:05.299> have<00:03:05.450> three<00:03:05.659> frames<00:03:05.930> in<00:03:06.110> there<00:03:06.200> right

00:03:06.399 --> 00:03:06.409 
now we have three frames in there right

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:08.199 
now we have three frames in there right
now<00:03:06.590> and<00:03:06.860> we're<00:03:06.980> going<00:03:07.099> to<00:03:07.129> spin<00:03:07.340> it<00:03:07.370> out<00:03:07.549> and

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
now and we're going to spin it out and

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:09.640 
now and we're going to spin it out and
we<00:03:08.330> should<00:03:08.360> have<00:03:08.569> three<00:03:08.750> frames<00:03:09.019> up<00:03:09.349> to<00:03:09.530> keep

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
we should have three frames up to keep

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.199 
we should have three frames up to keep
it<00:03:09.739> balanced<00:03:10.129> so<00:03:10.280> it's<00:03:10.400> not<00:03:10.489> unbalanced<00:03:11.000> we

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
it balanced so it's not unbalanced we

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:12.759 
it balanced so it's not unbalanced we
should<00:03:11.360> be<00:03:11.420> having<00:03:11.569> like<00:03:12.110> this<00:03:12.290> and<00:03:12.500> this<00:03:12.590> kind

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:12.769 
should be having like this and this kind

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:15.130 
should be having like this and this kind
of<00:03:12.799> a<00:03:12.890> shape<00:03:13.069> so<00:03:13.250> the<00:03:13.340> nice<00:03:13.489> and<00:03:13.640> balanced<00:03:14.140> so

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
of a shape so the nice and balanced so

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.940 
of a shape so the nice and balanced so
now<00:03:15.260> what's<00:03:15.410> the<00:03:15.440> matter<00:03:15.560> they're<00:03:15.769> spinning

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
now what's the matter they're spinning

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:17.729 
now what's the matter they're spinning
it<00:03:16.129> out<00:03:16.220> any<00:03:16.430> volunteers

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
it out any volunteers

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:20.440 
it out any volunteers
okay<00:03:18.739> so<00:03:18.819> let<00:03:19.819> me<00:03:19.849> show<00:03:20.000> you<00:03:20.060> the<00:03:20.180> basic

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
okay so let me show you the basic

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.920 
okay so let me show you the basic
process<00:03:20.780> here<00:03:20.930> now<00:03:21.739> I<00:03:21.769> can't<00:03:22.099> really<00:03:22.220> do<00:03:22.489> this

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
process here now I can't really do this

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:32.050 
process here now I can't really do this
you<00:03:23.930> spin<00:03:24.200> it<00:03:24.579> as<00:03:25.579> fast<00:03:25.819> as<00:03:25.970> you<00:03:26.060> can<00:03:30.910> and<00:03:31.910> the

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
you spin it as fast as you can and the

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.729 
you spin it as fast as you can and the
honey<00:03:32.209> flows<00:03:32.480> off<00:03:32.690> hits<00:03:33.049> the<00:03:33.170> walls<00:03:33.379> and<00:03:33.620> then

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
honey flows off hits the walls and then

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:35.830 
honey flows off hits the walls and then
settle<00:03:34.010> down<00:03:34.129> onto<00:03:34.340> the<00:03:34.489> bottom<00:03:34.810> there<00:03:35.810> so

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
settle down onto the bottom there so

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.890 
settle down onto the bottom there so
yeah<00:03:36.970> all<00:03:37.970> right<00:03:38.120> they<00:03:38.239> call<00:03:38.390> it<00:03:38.510> liquid<00:03:38.599> gold

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
yeah all right they call it liquid gold

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.280 
yeah all right they call it liquid gold
for<00:03:39.140> a<00:03:39.170> reason<00:03:39.940> there<00:03:40.940> we<00:03:41.030> go<00:03:41.209> oh<00:03:41.390> now<00:03:42.049> we're

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
for a reason there we go oh now we're

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:45.039 
for a reason there we go oh now we're
we're<00:03:43.190> draining<00:03:43.459> out<00:03:43.730> the<00:03:43.849> honey<00:03:44.000> now<00:03:44.930> we're

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:45.049 
we're draining out the honey now we're
