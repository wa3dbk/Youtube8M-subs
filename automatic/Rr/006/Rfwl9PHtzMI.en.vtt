weighs<00:03:09.040> 165<00:03:10.040> grams<00:03:11.110> which<00:03:12.110> we<00:03:12.410> can't<00:03:12.709> see<00:03:13.280> for

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
weighs 165 grams which we can't see for

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.770 
weighs 165 grams which we can't see for
whatever<00:03:14.299> reason<00:03:15.370> it's<00:03:16.370> not<00:03:16.459> picking<00:03:17.420> up<00:03:17.540> on

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
whatever reason it's not picking up on

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.310 
whatever reason it's not picking up on
this<00:03:18.769> camera<00:03:19.040> but<00:03:19.280> that's<00:03:19.400> ok<00:03:19.670> 165<00:03:20.390> grams<00:03:20.630> for

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320 
this camera but that's ok 165 grams for

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:25.690 
this camera but that's ok 165 grams for
this<00:03:21.470> guy<00:03:21.680> and<00:03:21.950> then<00:03:22.190> this<00:03:22.459> one<00:03:22.700> is<00:03:24.400> 130<00:03:25.400> grams

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:28.370 
every one of your pictures online but i

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:31.320 
every one of your pictures online but i
guess<00:05:28.610> that's<00:05:28.820> kind<00:05:29.000> of<00:05:29.060> like<00:05:29.210> cloud<00:05:30.099> with

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:31.330 
guess that's kind of like cloud with

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:34.750 
guess that's kind of like cloud with
with<00:05:32.330> google<00:05:32.780> or<00:05:32.990> no<00:05:33.620> wait<00:05:33.800> that's<00:05:34.340> apple

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:34.760 
with google or no wait that's apple

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:38.320 
with google or no wait that's apple
icloud<00:05:35.650> so<00:05:36.650> i<00:05:37.070> guess<00:05:37.430> kind<00:05:37.970> of<00:05:38.060> the<00:05:38.150> same<00:05:38.270> thing

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:38.330 
icloud so i guess kind of the same thing

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.779 
icloud so i guess kind of the same thing
but<00:05:38.570> you<00:05:38.780> can<00:05:38.930> I<00:05:39.020> guess<00:05:39.200> upload<00:05:39.669> large<00:05:40.669> files

00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:40.789 
but you can I guess upload large files

00:05:40.789 --> 00:05:43.270 
but you can I guess upload large files
if<00:05:41.270> you<00:05:41.419> need<00:05:41.659> to<00:05:41.840> which<00:05:42.080> is<00:05:42.260> obviously<00:05:42.710> a

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:43.280 
if you need to which is obviously a

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.899 
if you need to which is obviously a
convenient<00:05:44.240> thing<00:05:45.070> other<00:05:46.070> than<00:05:46.130> that<00:05:46.430> I<00:05:46.760> don't

00:05:46.899 --> 00:05:46.909 
convenient thing other than that I don't

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:49.210 
convenient thing other than that I don't
know<00:05:47.150> what<00:05:47.300> else<00:05:47.419> to<00:05:47.510> say<00:05:47.810> it's<00:05:48.080> definitely<00:05:49.070> a
