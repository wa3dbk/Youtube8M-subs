00:00:18.229 --> 00:00:18.239 
had some amazing times there now and

00:00:18.239 --> 00:00:20.790 
had some amazing times there now and
perhaps<00:00:19.239> if<00:00:19.599> it<00:00:19.720> wasn't<00:00:20.019> for<00:00:20.140> the<00:00:20.289> flat<00:00:20.529> then

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:20.800 
perhaps if it wasn't for the flat then

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.339 
perhaps if it wasn't for the flat then
perhaps<00:00:21.070> I<00:00:21.339> would've<00:00:21.550> never<00:00:21.779> started<00:00:22.779> up<00:00:23.230> a

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:23.349 
perhaps I would've never started up a

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:27.300 
perhaps I would've never started up a
YouTube<00:00:23.560> channel<00:00:23.880> who<00:00:24.880> knows<00:00:25.439> yeah<00:00:26.439> just<00:00:26.710> one

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:27.310 
YouTube channel who knows yeah just one

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:30.550 
question why is it pink because you like

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:36.720 
question why is it pink because you like
pink<00:00:30.880> I<00:00:31.829> do<00:00:32.829> not<00:00:33.130> like<00:00:33.430> pink<00:00:33.700> and<00:00:34.410> I<00:00:35.410> guess<00:00:35.730> not

only<00:00:37.060> is<00:00:37.150> there<00:00:37.390> a<00:00:37.420> lot<00:00:37.510> of<00:00:37.690> memories<00:00:38.140> for<00:00:38.170> me

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:38.470 
only is there a lot of memories for me

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.650 
only is there a lot of memories for me
making<00:00:38.770> YouTube<00:00:39.340> videos<00:00:39.370> but<00:00:39.970> for

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:40.660 
making YouTube videos but for

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.130 
making YouTube videos but for
subscribers<00:00:41.140> I<00:00:41.620> suspect<00:00:42.660> there<00:00:43.660> are<00:00:43.810> even

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:44.140

remember<00:00:45.100> the<00:00:45.220> rooms<00:00:45.490> and<00:00:45.880> the<00:00:46.390> lofts

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:46.840 
remember the rooms and the lofts

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.350 
remember the rooms and the lofts
