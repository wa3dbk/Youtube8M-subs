and it'll vibrate and then it'll make a
noise<00:01:20.100> and<00:01:20.159> let's<00:01:20.520> say<00:01:20.700> touch<00:01:21.000> here<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.570> beam

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
noise and let's say touch here to beam

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.960 
noise and let's say touch here to beam
so<00:01:22.140> I<00:01:22.170> touch<00:01:22.470> there<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:23.430> then<00:01:23.549> it<00:01:23.640> will<00:01:23.759> load
