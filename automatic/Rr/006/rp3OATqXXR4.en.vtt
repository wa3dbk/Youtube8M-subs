00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
toxic stuff that a lot of the products

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.010 
toxic stuff that a lot of the products

have and right away I said forget about

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.290 
have and right away I said forget about
it<00:00:55.320> I'm<00:00:55.379> not<00:00:55.440> touching<00:00:55.890> one<00:00:56.160> chemical<00:00:56.760> I<00:00:57.120> had

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
it I'm not touching one chemical I had

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.479 
it I'm not touching one chemical I had
found<00:00:57.539> some<00:00:57.809> studies<00:00:58.170> online<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:59.190> talked

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
found some studies online to talked

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.400 
found some studies online to talked
about<00:00:59.850> wireless<00:01:00.539> radiation<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.109> that's

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
about wireless radiation and that's

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.100 
about wireless radiation and that's
everything<00:01:01.859> from<00:01:02.399> cell<00:01:02.730> phones<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:03.690> wireless

internet and things like that
the<00:01:08.030> fetus<00:01:08.539> is<00:01:08.719> perhaps<00:01:08.929> the<00:01:09.679> most<00:01:09.710> vulnerable

00:01:10.389 --> 00:01:10.399 
the fetus is perhaps the most vulnerable

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:19.179 
the fetus is perhaps the most vulnerable
to<00:01:11.359> these<00:01:11.600> types<00:01:11.960> of<00:01:12.109> insults<00:01:17.590> the<00:01:18.590> mice<00:01:18.920> who

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:19.189 
to these types of insults the mice who

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:21.520 
to these types of insults the mice who
were<00:01:19.340> exposed<00:01:19.759> cellphones<00:01:20.450> were<00:01:20.780> more

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
were exposed cellphones were more

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.039 
were exposed cellphones were more
hyperactive<00:01:22.060> they<00:01:23.060> were<00:01:23.119> running<00:01:23.600> around<00:01:23.719> the

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:24.049 
hyperactive they were running around the

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:26.350 
hyperactive they were running around the
cage<00:01:24.259> a<00:01:24.289> lot<00:01:24.619> more<00:01:24.799> aggressively<00:01:25.310> they<00:01:26.209> had

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
cage a lot more aggressively they had

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.209 
cage a lot more aggressively they had
poorer<00:01:26.659> memory

00:01:28.209 --> 00:01:28.219 
poorer memory

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:29.889 
poorer memory
they<00:01:28.579> couldn't<00:01:28.850> remember<00:01:29.060> objects<00:01:29.659> in<00:01:29.810> the

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:29.899 
they couldn't remember objects in the

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:32.380 
they couldn't remember objects in the
cage<00:01:30.109> as<00:01:30.920> well<00:01:30.979> as<00:01:31.280> their<00:01:31.640> counterparts<00:01:31.850> who

cage as well as their counterparts who
weren't<00:01:32.600> exposed<00:01:32.959> to<00:01:33.170> the<00:01:33.259> cellphone

00:01:33.669 --> 00:01:33.679 
weren't exposed to the cellphone

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:35.740 
weren't exposed to the cellphone
radiation<00:01:33.920> so<00:01:34.909> they<00:01:35.090> were<00:01:35.149> running<00:01:35.659> around

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
radiation so they were running around

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.959 
radiation so they were running around
these<00:01:35.990> cages<00:01:36.289> bouncing<00:01:37.009> off<00:01:37.189> the<00:01:37.369> walls<00:01:37.609> not<00:01:37.939> a

00:01:37.959 --> 00:01:37.969 
these cages bouncing off the walls not a

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:39.120 
these cages bouncing off the walls not a
care<00:01:38.270> in<00:01:38.299> the<00:01:38.450> world

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
care in the world

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.190 
care in the world
something<00:01:40.130> that<00:01:40.369> in<00:01:41.119> our<00:01:41.239> eyes<00:01:41.450> resembles

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
something that in our eyes resembles

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.139 
something that in our eyes resembles
attention<00:01:42.799> deficit<00:01:43.280> hyperactivity<00:01:43.849> disorder

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:44.149 
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:47.859
