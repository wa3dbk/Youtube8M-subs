00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 who to pay alert plus a video of the series 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.580
 supplementation for large animals 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.170
 postage 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:15.980
 ah moleque texel bonezzi now fucked 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:15.980
 Sunglasses are now at the time of day 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:41.399
 being good is continuing to talk about the 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.500
 operation of sing I'll're talking 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.660
 today I will try to do is talk the way 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.850
 more rapid practice here because 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.890
 We are talking a lot going much 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.899
 information in the video just ends up that I 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.760
 I did not understand, I'm going to say one 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.340
 simplest way and today I're 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.670
 talking about it and protecting it and what 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.469
 law types that we use merchant and 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.899
 difference between them a little 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.309
 difference between proteins in 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:10.710
 many people have this difficulty of 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:13.680
 know dust the e5 we3 www and 100% isolated 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.840
 hydrolysates of poop and millet take care of 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.159
 Everything's so fucked up so I 'm just going to explain 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.470
 a little bit for you 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.000
 the difference between the two is illogical not 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.189
 I'll keep talking about everyone here. 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.229
 It's not going to be crazy, so I'm going. 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.450
 Talk about what I use in the corner. 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.280
 And why do I use this yours? 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.409
 protein in the corner 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:39.299
 How I going to talk about these two here. 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:42.000
 today it was the trash corner and and 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.909
 pury hydroponics is a protein 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.210
 hydrolyzed an isolated protein 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.860
 I'll talk about the difference between them and 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.200
 Why did I have it in the corner and why? 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.060
 It's better to sing it in my opinion. 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.520
 in my opinion then logical in the draw 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.229
 Are you already winning in the next draw? 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.920
 one of each looks just crazy that 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:05.579
 delight is getting crazy and 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.400
 joyce my past there the draw already 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.369
 has arrived 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:12.520
 on TV so let's go there because 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:14.800
 I use the proteins or isolated or 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.840
 hydrolyzed in my cante I'm talking 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.270
 because first the following protein 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:23.170
 idealized isolate showed details for 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:27.430
 you here the employer already it comes zero 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:29.950
 zero fat lactose 0 cholesterol heaven 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.620
 zero gluten carbohydrate, ie 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:35.740
 nobler protein she is zero all alone 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.890
 has protein is the protein plus one 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.670
 little better quality and 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.560
 consequently it will have a 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.870
 a somewhat better result on the issue of 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.090
 sing to me that talking topic tire 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.530
 Can not I be using the 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.390
 post-workout other types of protein 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.100
 of course you can but as I have 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.860
 sponsorship of the ball supports me and 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:56.230
 help this brand is fuck I use the best 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.760
 of all the protein hydrolyzed in the 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.440
 My opinion is the best gift you have 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.090
 by that because of a more absorption 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.740
 fast but mostly 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.110
 kant phase at the end of the trading session said 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.910
 who was preparing was steel tired 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.680
 I used protein in the post 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.590
 training it seems that she has entered the 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.810
 Jaú bloodstream was already 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.550
 feeling better and the isolated is more or 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.470
 less the same situation she does not 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:19.000
 Come with fat, do not come, Carlos Queiroz. 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:22.090
 Do not have sugar, do not be a fuck. 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.580
 it is 100% protein isolated what 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.350
 absorption takes a little less 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.970
 hydrolyzed but there are few 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:28.870
 thing then this can also be 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.730
 used 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.170
 another advantage of using proteins 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.870
 to isolate and organize 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.640
 they do not have lactose so who has 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.130
 lactose intolerance you feel 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.230
 stew starts that rock on account 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:44.050
 of proteins that comes with 14 years 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.700
 concentrates other lenses this will not 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:49.690
 have this problem you will not have this 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.950
 problem of feeling the belly of steamed 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:56.560
 to feel 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:58.810
 I went to isolated proteins located 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.720
 does not come with a load on your questions 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:03.160
 well, but I see in interesting cante 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.850
 you take a carbohydrate after 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.130
 training 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:08.140
 It's okay, it's interesting, yes, but a friend. 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:10.540
 told me one thing will pay each 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:11.980
 protein that is not as cheap as 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:16.269
 others 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:17.799
 bigger the phone finally fucking and she 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:20.139
 could a higher quality then you go 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:24.030
 put it on protein pay man it's full of 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:27.580
 carbohydrate is not just like protein 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:30.220
 with the shoelace stuck as oil for $ 47 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:33.550
 playing then what happens is only in 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:36.090
 cable and has a very high quality in the caic 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:36.090
 Brazil 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:42.100
 So what do I tell you in the corner? 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:43.830
 and I recommend that you always use them 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:46.780
 proteins or isolated or improvised 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:48.850
 said protein time it zyxel proteins 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.800
 which are mixtures of producing more 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:52.449
 as if there were any 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:55.180
 protein that has a slow decline in 

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:58.960
 proteins are not so unattractive 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:01.780
 to take the training post then take 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:04.030
 like snack before sleeping protein 5 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:06.250
 w3 of you can use the compound can 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:08.560
 but I think it's more interesting 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:10.720
 protein in the post training proteins that 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:13.510
 I'm mainly in the typhoon in singing 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:16.000
 cassette proteins that have a 

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:18.789
 more rapid and isolated absorption or 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.099
 hydrolyzed is my opinion is there that 

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:23.500
 transpose for you I will not stay 

00:05:21.099 --> 00:05:25.870
 very confusing short weapons and 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:28.660
 dynamic fans on some subjects only 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:29.470
 Not to get boring, man. 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:33.990
 switched on 

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:33.990
 I like you for the hell of a song. 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.950
 retarded today face fucking bitch 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:43.660
 well do you want to participate in the draw? 

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:45.220
 of the doll 

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:46.479
 here are the first two products that will 

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:48.190
 be drawn 

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:50.380
 Next week I 'll talk about 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:52.690
 thermogenic and will also be 

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:56.650
 raffled some homogeneous you talking 

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:58.810
 such as l carnitine or the abdomen 

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:00.039
 Caffeine and I am also talking about the 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:02.229
 decap 

00:06:00.039 --> 00:06:03.880
 It's really cool, you can not see everything. 

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:06.099
 that I got to participate in the 

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:09.960
 draw was the following you will follow 

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:09.960
 appears instagram puts there I have 

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:16.930
 pain will not participate in the draw 

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:19.529
 there you mark in your publications the 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:22.829
 hashtag timbó 

00:06:19.529 --> 00:06:24.839
 Put there face pinball action all 

00:06:22.829 --> 00:06:27.119
 publication you do preferably with 

00:06:24.839 --> 00:06:28.619
 eco nabor things do not have to be juice 

00:06:27.119 --> 00:06:29.999
 thing only good thing is that more than 

00:06:28.619 --> 00:06:32.069
 preferably you will be participating 

00:06:29.999 --> 00:06:34.619
 automatically from the draw then 

00:06:32.069 --> 00:06:36.059
 the more you post this hashtag 

00:06:34.619 --> 00:06:38.039
 chances you have to win because more 

00:06:36.059 --> 00:06:43.919
 You 're going to be appearing and you can scale. 

00:06:38.039 --> 00:06:46.379
 Did you like the milan kaká house and 

00:06:43.919 --> 00:06:48.299
 then give away the more fights does not 

00:06:46.379 --> 00:06:50.549
 make better funny links 

00:06:48.299 --> 00:06:52.409
 preferably something that attracts attention 

00:06:50.549 --> 00:06:54.659
 Look, I'm not going with vitiligo. My case is 

00:06:52.409 --> 00:06:56.909
 spoon of the championship in which it does not 

00:06:54.659 --> 00:06:59.549
 I will leave delay for 6 in the people then 

00:06:56.909 --> 00:07:01.919
 mark there watching the stars is love is 

00:06:59.549 --> 00:07:05.659
 that instagram sees history as well 

00:07:01.919 --> 00:07:08.039
 it was not there that 88 years puts the market 

00:07:05.659 --> 00:07:09.989
 follow the white stripe 

00:07:08.039 --> 00:07:12.239
 every day the flag post every day 

00:07:09.989 --> 00:07:13.949
 I say to you guys too 

00:07:12.239 --> 00:07:14.909
 Thank you, you said that you are following the 

00:07:13.949 --> 00:07:20.299
 my work 

00:07:14.909 --> 00:07:20.299
 if you can enjoy without commitment I like it 

00:07:22.099 --> 00:07:26.669
 below share this video gives a 

00:07:25.019 --> 00:07:28.409
 Favorite morals are you helping me. 

00:07:26.669 --> 00:07:30.449
 writes the channel 

00:07:28.409 --> 00:07:32.389
 the sun is receiving updates that 

00:07:30.449 --> 00:07:34.829
 How are you betting right there? 

00:07:32.389 --> 00:07:36.689
 Thank you so much and see you 

00:07:34.829 --> 00:07:39.529
 has been talking about thermogenics and 

00:07:36.689 --> 00:07:39.529
 participate in the draw
