00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.670
 good morning in my name is to divide 

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:13.650
 leyton valverde I am secretary general 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.289
 union workers 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.300
 agricultural plantations and back where 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.300
 find most of the 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.699
 banana and pineapple plantations in 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.039
 Costa Rica well actually one of the 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.019
 major sufferings that exist in the 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.449
 plantations of union persecution 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:33.000
 that is when our workers are 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.910
 organize in a union in some 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.010
 cases are immediately dismissed 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.340
 are fired for the fact of 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.740
 belong to the union wages in 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.620
 mostly it is not enough to make 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:49.470
 different cost of living and even not 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.830
 nor the minimum wage that how to 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:55.050
 regulate the state of the minimum wage of 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:58.170
 in case it does not compensate the high cost of 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.600
 life in costa rica another situation is the 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.810
 topic of the working day we are 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.860
 talking about 12 and a half hours 13 hours and 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:09.479
 in some cases up to 15 18 hours 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.110
 of course there are health problems of 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.770
 all kinds in it 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:18.130
 Occupational accidents are frequent 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:20.290
 in pineapple and banana plantations by 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.510
 the bad conditions let's say it this way 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.580
 protective equipment for 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:26.860
 security conditions of passage in the 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.990
 in the environment of working the 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.479
 workers then there are many 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.070
 problems with the health issue is that 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:36.310
 companies have to apply many 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:39.130
 agrochemicals many times a lot 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:42.640
 agrochemicals is applied via land and 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:45.820
 airway and then that is agrochemical 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:48.130
 it is strongly toxic that they should 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.740
 demand from your suppliers that they must 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:53.590
 comply with the legislation and guarantee 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:56.070
 the health of the workers guarantee 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:02:00.460
 workers' freedom of association 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.840
 guarantee a fair day for their 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.000
 workers 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.560
 I believe that if they can do them 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.679
 they have a lot of power they are the ones 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.959
 they demand the conditions under which 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:13.630
 the product must be produced 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:15.670
 here distribute quality be them 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.720
 they believe that supermarkets here 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:21.200
 they are very demanding with the policies 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:23.840
 but they also complain a lot about 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.410
 that the prices of banana and pineapple 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:30.260
 they have get here are 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:33.670
 insufficient to cope with the 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.670
 high cost of production 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:43.600
 Well I'm happy because I participated 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:46.600
 there I could hear a little about some 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:49.990
 proposals that there are however when 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:52.540
 I hear about the representatives of the 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:54.310
 supermarkets them like they 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:58.210
 feel that there is little that can 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:00.400
 make what they need is the 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:04.120
 consumer to be good with the consumer 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:06.880
 and then like they justify 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:10.390
 like they do not take responsibility and 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:12.580
 they say that the consumer is not 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:15.550
 interested in him 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.710
 on the issue of labor rights and 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:20.380
 I think maybe the consumer 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:22.210
 I should have more information 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.310
 Sometimes the consumer may be 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:28.440
 buying a product and it is fixed nothing more 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:31.300
 in the price but maybe because the 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.310
 product does not have more information of 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.620
 the conditions under which those 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:38.440
 products I would say maybe they 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:41.170
 they could look for mechanisms or laws 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:44.380
 binding obliging 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:46.410
 supermarkets to demand that these 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:49.270
 products that they that they 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:51.400
 present the consumer are produced 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:54.400
 with better conditions for 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.590
 workers that producers of 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:59.620
 pineapple banana and other products its 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:04.330
 The biggest complaint is that here in Europe 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:06.430
 example , a lot of quality is demanded and 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:09.550
 the prices paid by the supermarket are 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:11.770
 very low and then in the end those 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:14.980
 low prices is really the one that 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:17.010
 ends up paying let's say it like that to pay 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:19.760
 the consequences 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.760
 workers
