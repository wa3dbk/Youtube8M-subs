00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
automatically entered and all that

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.580 
automatically entered and all that
information<00:02:22.819> is<00:02:22.940> on<00:02:23.120> the<00:02:23.480> sheet<00:02:23.660> music<00:02:23.840> okay

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
information is on the sheet music okay

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.410 
information is on the sheet music okay
and<00:02:24.620> so<00:02:24.950> this<00:02:25.550> is<00:02:25.700> something<00:02:25.849> really<00:02:26.239> good<00:02:26.390> for

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
and so this is something really good for

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:27.940 
and so this is something really good for
you<00:02:26.629> to<00:02:26.690> challenge<00:02:26.989> yourself<00:02:27.260> I<00:02:27.349> think<00:02:27.530> anyone

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
you to challenge yourself I think anyone

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.250 
you to challenge yourself I think anyone
can<00:02:28.160> do<00:02:28.280> this<00:02:28.459> at<00:02:28.700> any<00:02:28.940> level<00:02:29.300> it's<00:02:29.870> gonna<00:02:30.019> take

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
can do this at any level it's gonna take

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.050 
can do this at any level it's gonna take
some<00:02:30.409> practice<00:02:30.620> but<00:02:30.890> I<00:02:31.099> know<00:02:31.159> you<00:02:31.489> can<00:02:31.790> do<00:02:31.909> it

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
some practice but I know you can do it

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.580 
some practice but I know you can do it
okay<00:02:32.390> so<00:02:32.480> what<00:02:32.750> I'm<00:02:32.840> going<00:02:32.959> to<00:02:32.989> do<00:02:33.260> is<00:02:33.409> just

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
okay so what I'm going to do is just

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.610 
okay so what I'm going to do is just
even<00:02:33.830> quickly<00:02:34.129> go<00:02:34.340> through<00:02:34.480> the<00:02:35.480> exercise<00:02:36.379> for

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
even quickly go through the exercise for

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.890 
even quickly go through the exercise for
you<00:02:36.760> so<00:02:37.760> basically<00:02:37.909> what<00:02:38.360> we're<00:02:38.480> doing<00:02:38.690> on<00:02:38.810> the

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
you so basically what we're doing on the

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.530 
you so basically what we're doing on the
feet<00:02:39.140> is<00:02:39.349> a<00:02:39.860> five<00:02:40.580> milk<00:02:40.880> grouping<00:02:41.240> it's<00:02:41.420> what

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
feet is a five milk grouping it's what

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.540 
feet is a five milk grouping it's what
we<00:02:41.660> talked<00:02:41.900> about<00:02:42.020> in<00:02:42.350> the<00:02:42.830> previous<00:02:43.010> lesson

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
we talked about in the previous lesson

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.309 
we talked about in the previous lesson
it's<00:02:43.700> right<00:02:43.940> left<00:02:43.970> right<00:02:44.360> left<00:02:44.540> left<00:02:44.990> and

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:45.319 
it's right left right left left and

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:45.710 
it's right left right left left and
we're<00:02:45.530> due

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
we're due

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.950 
we're due
with<00:02:45.960> our<00:02:46.110> feet<00:02:46.350> play<00:02:46.920> it<00:02:47.040> as<00:02:47.190> 16th<00:02:47.790> notes<00:02:48.060> now

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:48.960 
with our feet play it as 16th notes now

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.510 
with our feet play it as 16th notes now
if<00:02:49.080> we<00:02:49.200> play<00:02:49.410> that<00:02:49.590> as<00:02:49.680> 16th<00:02:50.100> notes<00:02:50.340> the

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
if we play that as 16th notes the

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.790 
if we play that as 16th notes the
pattern<00:02:50.940> is<00:02:51.120> automatically<00:02:52.020> going<00:02:52.170> to<00:02:52.260> reset

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
pattern is automatically going to reset

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.030 
pattern is automatically going to reset
after<00:02:53.280> 5<00:02:53.580> bars<00:02:53.940> and<00:02:54.330> so<00:02:54.840> this<00:02:55.080> whole<00:02:55.350> exercise

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
after 5 bars and so this whole exercise

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.990 
after 5 bars and so this whole exercise
is<00:02:56.100> a<00:02:56.370> 5<00:02:56.790> bar<00:02:57.350> exercise<00:02:58.350> and<00:02:58.730> you<00:02:59.730> play<00:02:59.910> it<00:02:59.970> for

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
is a 5 bar exercise and you play it for

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.400 
is a 5 bar exercise and you play it for
1<00:03:00.240> minute<00:03:00.450> straight<00:03:00.810> you're<00:03:00.960> gonna<00:03:01.050> play<00:03:01.290> at

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
1 minute straight you're gonna play at

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.560 
1 minute straight you're gonna play at
many<00:03:01.650> many<00:03:01.860> times<00:03:02.220> over<00:03:02.670> and<00:03:02.760> over<00:03:02.820> again<00:03:03.060> so

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
many many times over and over again so

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:05.450 
many many times over and over again so
what<00:03:04.200> I<00:03:04.230> do<00:03:04.350> is<00:03:04.590> I<00:03:04.680> just<00:03:04.740> kind<00:03:04.980> of<00:03:05.070> forget<00:03:05.400> about

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:05.460 
what I do is I just kind of forget about

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.030 
what I do is I just kind of forget about
how<00:03:06.120> many<00:03:06.300> bars<00:03:06.540> I'm<00:03:06.990> playing<00:03:07.500> or<00:03:07.770> everything

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
how many bars I'm playing or everything

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.520 
how many bars I'm playing or everything
it<00:03:08.280> whatever<00:03:08.490> like<00:03:08.670> that<00:03:08.700> and<00:03:09.090> I'll<00:03:09.360> just<00:03:09.600> do

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
it whatever like that and I'll just do

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.500 
it whatever like that and I'll just do
the<00:03:10.710> ostinato<00:03:11.220> and<00:03:11.610> then<00:03:11.760> play<00:03:12.000> a<00:03:12.030> groove<00:03:12.360> over

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
the ostinato and then play a groove over

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.150 
the ostinato and then play a groove over
top<00:03:12.810> of<00:03:12.840> it<00:03:13.050> so<00:03:13.500> I<00:03:13.560> mean<00:03:13.710> what<00:03:13.860> I'm<00:03:13.920> going<00:03:14.040> to<00:03:14.070> do

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
top of it so I mean what I'm going to do

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.300 
top of it so I mean what I'm going to do
is<00:03:14.220> I'm<00:03:14.280> going<00:03:14.310> to<00:03:14.430> start<00:03:15.020> with<00:03:16.100> really<00:03:17.100> slow

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
is I'm going to start with really slow

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.430 
is I'm going to start with really slow
at<00:03:17.520> 70<00:03:18.209> beats<00:03:18.390> per<00:03:18.480> minute<00:03:18.810> and<00:03:18.959> I'm<00:03:19.350> just

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
at 70 beats per minute and I'm just

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.020 
at 70 beats per minute and I'm just
gonna<00:03:19.590> play<00:03:19.770> the<00:03:19.800> foot<00:03:20.130> pattern<00:03:20.340> for<00:03:20.730> you<00:03:20.820> and

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
gonna play the foot pattern for you and

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.150 
gonna play the foot pattern for you and
I'm<00:03:21.660> gonna<00:03:21.750> play<00:03:21.900> it<00:03:21.990> for<00:03:22.020> a<00:03:22.140> full<00:03:22.320> 5<00:03:22.590> bars<00:03:22.860> and

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
I'm gonna play it for a full 5 bars and

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.860 
I'm gonna play it for a full 5 bars and
then<00:03:23.250> stop<00:03:23.550> so<00:03:23.970> you<00:03:24.000> can<00:03:24.180> hear<00:03:24.360> exactly<00:03:24.750> where

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
then stop so you can hear exactly where

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:48.550 
then stop so you can hear exactly where
the<00:03:24.930> pattern<00:03:25.230> starts<00:03:25.620> and<00:03:25.830> stops<00:03:26.310> here<00:03:26.670> we<00:03:26.760> go

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.110 

so<00:03:49.560> that<00:03:49.590> is<00:03:49.769> the<00:03:50.040> foot<00:03:50.310> pattern<00:03:50.580> that<00:03:51.000> you

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
so that is the foot pattern that you

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.729 
so that is the foot pattern that you
need<00:03:51.300> to<00:03:51.420> learn<00:03:51.540> how<00:03:51.660> to<00:03:51.690> play<00:03:51.989> and<00:03:52.260> just

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
need to learn how to play and just

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:54.800 
need to learn how to play and just
repeat<00:03:53.130> that<00:03:53.160> ok<00:03:53.790> so<00:03:53.850> it's<00:03:54.180> written<00:03:54.300> as<00:03:54.510> a<00:03:54.540> 5

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
repeat that ok so it's written as a 5

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.570 
repeat that ok so it's written as a 5
bar<00:03:54.989> pattern<00:03:55.200> so<00:03:55.530> you<00:03:56.010> can<00:03:56.160> see<00:03:56.340> where<00:03:56.489> it

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:56.580 
bar pattern so you can see where it

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.520 
bar pattern so you can see where it
resets<00:03:57.060> but<00:03:57.510> I'd<00:03:57.630> recommend<00:03:58.019> you<00:03:58.110> just<00:03:58.320> learn

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
resets but I'd recommend you just learn

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.070 
resets but I'd recommend you just learn
that<00:03:58.709> for<00:03:58.890> pattern<00:03:59.220> play<00:03:59.700> it<00:04:00.080> continuously

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.080 
that for pattern play it continuously

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.680 
that for pattern play it continuously
with<00:04:01.350> a<00:04:01.380> metronome<00:04:01.860> and<00:04:02.239> just<00:04:03.239> get<00:04:03.390> really

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
with a metronome and just get really

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.479 
with a metronome and just get really
really<00:04:03.870> comfortable<00:04:04.320> with<00:04:04.410> that<00:04:04.470> ok<00:04:05.220> the<00:04:05.370> next

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
really comfortable with that ok the next

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:07.729 
really comfortable with that ok the next
step<00:04:05.640> is<00:04:06.000> adding<00:04:06.480> eighth<00:04:07.140> notes<00:04:07.410> with<00:04:07.620> the

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739 
step is adding eighth notes with the

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:09.590 
step is adding eighth notes with the
ride<00:04:07.950> ok<00:04:08.519> so<00:04:08.640> I'll<00:04:08.790> add<00:04:08.880> eighth<00:04:09.150> notes<00:04:09.450> with

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600 
ride ok so I'll add eighth notes with

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.320 
ride ok so I'll add eighth notes with
the<00:04:09.690> ride<00:04:09.900> and<00:04:10.170> then<00:04:11.160> the<00:04:11.519> step<00:04:11.730> after<00:04:11.910> that<00:04:12.000> is

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:12.330 
the ride and then the step after that is

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.060 
the ride and then the step after that is
added<00:04:12.630> in<00:04:12.690> the<00:04:12.720> snare<00:04:13.019> on<00:04:13.260> two<00:04:13.500> and<00:04:13.560> four<00:04:13.709> and

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.070 
added in the snare on two and four and

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:17.000
