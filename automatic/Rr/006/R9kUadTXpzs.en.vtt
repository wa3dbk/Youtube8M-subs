hey<00:00:03.840> there<00:00:04.020> folks<00:00:04.290> want<00:00:04.710> to<00:00:04.800> show<00:00:04.890> you<00:00:04.950> a

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
hey there folks want to show you a

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.490 
hey there folks want to show you a
little<00:00:05.160> clock<00:00:05.370> I<00:00:05.550> made<00:00:05.760> here<00:00:06.200> basically<00:00:07.200> this

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
little clock I made here basically this

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.030 
little clock I made here basically this
is<00:00:07.649> just<00:00:07.920> a<00:00:08.010> simple<00:00:08.610> 12-hour<00:00:09.180> clock<00:00:09.210> and<00:00:10.040> these

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
is just a simple 12-hour clock and these

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.150 
is just a simple 12-hour clock and these
are<00:00:11.870> set<00:00:12.870> the<00:00:13.020> hour<00:00:13.170> of<00:00:13.380> set<00:00:13.530> two<00:00:13.650> minutes<00:00:13.950> and

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
are set the hour of set two minutes and

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.490 
are set the hour of set two minutes and
then<00:00:14.520> this<00:00:14.670> button<00:00:14.850> right<00:00:15.000> here<00:00:15.500> does

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
then this button right here does

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.679 
then this button right here does
something<00:00:16.769> kind<00:00:16.890> of<00:00:17.010> interesting<00:00:17.580> help<00:00:18.570> me

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:18.689 
something kind of interesting help me

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:20.980 
something kind of interesting help me
explain<00:00:19.079> multiplexing<00:00:19.919> LEDs<00:00:20.310> to<00:00:20.730> my

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:20.990 
explain multiplexing LEDs to my

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.200 
explain multiplexing LEDs to my
seven-year-old<00:00:21.990> so<00:00:22.890> if<00:00:23.669> you<00:00:23.849> push<00:00:24.060> this

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
seven-year-old so if you push this

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.849 
seven-year-old so if you push this
button<00:00:24.419> what<00:00:24.749> it<00:00:24.869> does<00:00:24.989> is<00:00:25.140> it<00:00:25.230> puts<00:00:25.380> a<00:00:25.470> delay

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
button what it does is it puts a delay

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.720 
button what it does is it puts a delay
in<00:00:26.570> the<00:00:27.570> multiplexing<00:00:28.470> process<00:00:29.039> so<00:00:29.489> you<00:00:29.579> can

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
in the multiplexing process so you can

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.639 
in the multiplexing process so you can
see<00:00:29.999> this<00:00:30.210> kind<00:00:30.449> of<00:00:30.599> go<00:00:30.720> out<00:00:30.749> and<00:00:31.169> then<00:00:31.380> what<00:00:31.560> it

00:00:31.639 --> 00:00:31.649 
see this kind of go out and then what it

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:33.560 
see this kind of go out and then what it
does<00:00:31.829> is<00:00:31.980> it<00:00:32.130> gradually<00:00:32.520> decreases<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.270> delay

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
does is it gradually decreases the delay

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.750 
does is it gradually decreases the delay
until<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.680> human<00:00:34.950> eye<00:00:35.040> can<00:00:35.280> see<00:00:35.310> it<00:00:35.610> no<00:00:35.730> more

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
until the human eye can see it no more

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.350 
until the human eye can see it no more
so<00:00:37.250> in<00:00:38.250> pushing<00:00:38.490> that<00:00:38.610> button<00:00:38.850> I<00:00:39.030> was<00:00:39.090> able<00:00:39.240> to

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
so in pushing that button I was able to

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.720 
so in pushing that button I was able to
explain<00:00:39.810> to<00:00:39.960> him<00:00:40.110> how<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.800> LEDs<00:00:41.190> are<00:00:41.340> lit<00:00:41.370> one

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
explain to him how the LEDs are lit one

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.810 
explain to him how the LEDs are lit one
at<00:00:41.850> a<00:00:41.910> time<00:00:42.530> in<00:00:43.530> a<00:00:43.680> row<00:00:43.890> really<00:00:44.160> fast<00:00:44.550> where<00:00:44.730> the

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
at a time in a row really fast where the

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.440 
at a time in a row really fast where the
human<00:00:45.090> eye<00:00:45.180> can't<00:00:45.800> tell<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:46.950> difference<00:00:47.450> but

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
human eye can't tell the difference but

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.790 
human eye can't tell the difference but
it<00:00:48.630> was<00:00:48.750> just<00:00:48.840> a<00:00:48.960> neat<00:00:49.110> little<00:00:49.230> sketch<00:00:49.530> I<00:00:49.650> put

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
it was just a neat little sketch I put

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:50.840 
it was just a neat little sketch I put
it<00:00:49.890> up<00:00:49.980> to<00:00:50.070> it<00:00:50.100> on<00:00:50.220> how<00:00:50.340> it's<00:00:50.490> going<00:00:50.550> to<00:00:50.700> come<00:00:50.820> on

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
it up to it on how it's going to come on

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.450 
it up to it on how it's going to come on
video<00:00:51.210> but<00:00:51.620> to<00:00:52.620> go<00:00:52.740> ahead<00:00:52.890> and<00:00:53.010> do<00:00:53.070> that<00:00:53.220> so

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
video but to go ahead and do that so

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.710 
video but to go ahead and do that so
anyway<00:00:54.000> I<00:00:54.120> thought<00:00:54.180> it<00:00:54.270> was<00:00:54.360> pretty<00:00:54.510> neat

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:54.720 
anyway I thought it was pretty neat

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:59.580 
anyway I thought it was pretty neat
thanks<00:00:55.350> for<00:00:55.440> watching

00:00:59.580 --> 00:00:59.590 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.130 

hey<00:01:00.590> guys<00:01:00.770> and<00:01:01.040> girls<00:01:01.160> this<00:01:01.790> is<00:01:02.000> I<00:01:02.270> guess<00:01:02.960> part

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
hey guys and girls this is I guess part

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.170 
hey guys and girls this is I guess part
2<00:01:03.320> of<00:01:03.350> this<00:01:03.470> video<00:01:03.620> I<00:01:04.010> realized<00:01:04.610> I<00:01:04.910> looked<00:01:05.120> over

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 
2 of this video I realized I looked over

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:06.880 
2 of this video I realized I looked over
on<00:01:05.360> my<00:01:05.480> bench<00:01:06.170> here<00:01:06.410> and<00:01:06.500> I<00:01:06.530> had<00:01:06.680> these<00:01:06.800> little

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
on my bench here and I had these little

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.070 
on my bench here and I had these little
looks<00:01:07.250> and<00:01:07.460> pieces<00:01:08.210> cut<00:01:08.420> out<00:01:08.540> for<00:01:08.840> the<00:01:08.930> Nokia

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.080 
looks and pieces cut out for the Nokia

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.750 
looks and pieces cut out for the Nokia
displays<00:01:11.530> these<00:01:12.530> guys<00:01:12.770> right<00:01:12.950> here<00:01:13.010> I<00:01:13.370> get

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:13.760 
displays these guys right here I get

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.670 
displays these guys right here I get
from<00:01:13.910> Adafruit<00:01:14.240> I<00:01:14.330> like<00:01:14.510> so<00:01:14.660> much<00:01:14.780> and<00:01:15.080> I

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:15.680 
from Adafruit I like so much and I

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.110 
from Adafruit I like so much and I
realized<00:01:16.310> that<00:01:16.550> this<00:01:16.910> source<00:01:17.870> segment<00:01:18.290> LED

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:19.120 
realized that this source segment LED

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.010 
realized that this source segment LED
display<00:01:20.120> that<00:01:20.270> I<00:01:20.300> was<00:01:20.420> working<00:01:20.540> with<00:01:20.720> is

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
display that I was working with is

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.120 
display that I was working with is
pretty<00:01:21.320> much<00:01:21.470> the<00:01:21.620> same<00:01:21.800> size<00:01:22.130> as<00:01:22.430> that<00:01:22.750> so<00:01:23.750> I

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
pretty much the same size as that so I

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.719 
pretty much the same size as that so I
jam<00:01:25.130> one<00:01:25.310> in<00:01:25.430> here<00:01:25.640> so<00:01:26.630> what<00:01:27.020> I<00:01:27.050> did<00:01:27.170> is<00:01:27.729> there's

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:28.729 
jam one in here so what I did is there's

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:31.240 
jam one in here so what I did is there's
a<00:01:28.790> 328<00:01:29.240> here<00:01:29.570> obviously<00:01:29.930> this<00:01:30.290> this<00:01:30.620> is<00:01:31.070> cut

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
a 328 here obviously this this is cut

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.310 
a 328 here obviously this this is cut
out<00:01:31.340> for<00:01:31.550> the<00:01:31.640> size<00:01:31.850> of<00:01:32.000> the<00:01:32.090> screen<00:01:32.360> crystal

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
out for the size of the screen crystal

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.790 
out for the size of the screen crystal
the<00:01:34.280> resistors<00:01:34.670> for<00:01:34.910> the<00:01:35.619> anodes<00:01:36.619> and<00:01:36.920> then<00:01:37.280> I

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:38.800 
the resistors for the anodes and then I

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.160 
the resistors for the anodes and then I
did<00:01:39.800> a<00:01:39.830> single<00:01:40.130> resistor<00:01:40.640> for<00:01:41.150> the<00:01:41.450> :

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
did a single resistor for the :

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.920 
did a single resistor for the :
that's<00:01:42.290> actually<00:01:42.740> not<00:01:43.840> that's<00:01:44.840> not

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930 
that's actually not that's not

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.040 
that's actually not that's not
multiplexed<00:01:45.680> that's<00:01:45.920> direct<00:01:46.310> and<00:01:46.570> then<00:01:47.570> three

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:48.050 
multiplexed that's direct and then three

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:51.070 
multiplexed that's direct and then three
resistors<00:01:48.770> here<00:01:49.009> for<00:01:49.460> an<00:01:49.640> RGB<00:01:50.000> LED<00:01:50.300> because<00:01:50.690> I

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 
resistors here for an RGB LED because I

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.380 
resistors here for an RGB LED because I
like<00:01:51.229> RGB<00:01:51.590> LEDs<00:01:51.920> and<00:01:52.250> I<00:01:52.460> moved<00:01:52.640> them<00:01:52.729> to<00:01:52.790> pwm

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
like RGB LEDs and I moved them to pwm

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.359 
like RGB LEDs and I moved them to pwm
pin<00:01:53.420> so<00:01:53.810> I<00:01:53.869> can<00:01:54.020> do<00:01:54.110> cool<00:01:54.320> things<00:01:54.350> with<00:01:54.619> them

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369 
pin so I can do cool things with them

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:57.910 
pin so I can do cool things with them
the<00:01:55.670> buttons<00:01:56.030> are<00:01:56.300> they<00:01:56.720> just<00:01:57.410> regular<00:01:57.710> push

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
the buttons are they just regular push

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.440 
the buttons are they just regular push
buttons<00:01:58.250> as<00:01:58.490> you<00:01:58.550> can<00:01:58.790> see<00:01:59.119> because

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
buttons as you can see because

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.499 
buttons as you can see because
everything's<00:01:59.750> clear<00:01:59.960> and<00:02:00.369> if<00:02:01.369> you<00:02:01.670> if<00:02:02.360> you

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:02.509 
everything's clear and if you if you

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:04.840 
everything's clear and if you if you
look<00:02:02.690> there's<00:02:02.960> pieces<00:02:03.440> of<00:02:03.680> lexan<00:02:04.130> that<00:02:04.640> got

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
look there's pieces of lexan that got

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:06.760 
look there's pieces of lexan that got
cut<00:02:05.090> out<00:02:05.120> of<00:02:05.330> the<00:02:05.390> top<00:02:05.690> that<00:02:06.229> got<00:02:06.409> cut<00:02:06.590> out<00:02:06.620> of

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
cut out of the top that got cut out of

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.460 
cut out of the top that got cut out of
the<00:02:06.830> original<00:02:07.400> piece<00:02:07.720> are<00:02:08.720> just<00:02:08.959> in<00:02:09.110> here<00:02:09.380> and

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
the original piece are just in here and

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.289 
the original piece are just in here and
it's<00:02:09.560> it's<00:02:10.100> good<00:02:10.429> blinky<00:02:10.729> like<00:02:10.880> that<00:02:11.060> so<00:02:11.269> I

00:02:11.289 --> 00:02:11.299 
it's it's good blinky like that so I

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:14.440 
it's it's good blinky like that so I
just<00:02:11.420> have<00:02:11.660> this<00:02:11.799> hooked<00:02:12.799> up<00:02:12.920> to<00:02:13.330> four<00:02:14.330> and<00:02:14.390> a

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
just have this hooked up to four and a

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:20.970 
just have this hooked up to four and a
half<00:02:14.480> volts<00:02:15.970> and<00:02:16.970> away<00:02:17.390> it<00:02:17.450> goes

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.750 

again<00:02:21.980> this<00:02:22.130> is<00:02:22.310> multiplexing<00:02:22.940> slowed<00:02:23.450> down

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
again this is multiplexing slowed down

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.680 
again this is multiplexing slowed down
the<00:02:25.760> clock<00:02:26.000> is<00:02:26.150> still<00:02:26.269> running<00:02:26.330> in<00:02:26.630> the

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
the clock is still running in the

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.030 
the clock is still running in the
background<00:02:26.870> but<00:02:27.230> the<00:02:27.320> multiplexing

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
background but the multiplexing

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.100 
background but the multiplexing
multiplexing<00:02:28.910> display<00:02:29.299> is<00:02:29.480> slowed<00:02:29.750> down<00:02:29.930> so

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
multiplexing display is slowed down so

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.380 
multiplexing display is slowed down so
you<00:02:30.200> can<00:02:30.350> see<00:02:30.500> it<00:02:30.620> work<00:02:30.769> and<00:02:31.459> eventually<00:02:32.090> the

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
you can see it work and eventually the

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.150 
you can see it work and eventually the
delay<00:02:32.630> gets<00:02:32.870> lower<00:02:33.620> and<00:02:33.739> lower<00:02:33.860> and<00:02:34.070> lower

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
delay gets lower and lower and lower

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.800 
delay gets lower and lower and lower
until<00:02:35.200> I<00:02:36.610> figure<00:02:37.610> what<00:02:37.730> it<00:02:37.820> ends<00:02:38.030> on<00:02:38.120> recive

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
until I figure what it ends on recive

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.530 
until I figure what it ends on recive
very<00:02:39.019> very<00:02:39.260> low<00:02:39.380> delay<00:02:39.680> though<00:02:39.890> and<00:02:40.390> this<00:02:41.390> is

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
very very low delay though and this is

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:42.880 
very very low delay though and this is
how<00:02:41.690> you<00:02:41.750> set<00:02:41.989> this<00:02:42.140> I<00:02:42.290> need<00:02:42.410> to<00:02:42.500> put<00:02:42.650> a<00:02:42.680> little

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
how you set this I need to put a little

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.050 
how you set this I need to put a little
bit<00:02:43.010> of<00:02:43.130> delay<00:02:43.250> in<00:02:43.459> the<00:02:43.549> buttons<00:02:43.820> here<00:02:43.910> they're

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
bit of delay in the buttons here they're

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.710 
bit of delay in the buttons here they're
a<00:02:44.090> little<00:02:44.180> bit<00:02:44.360> jumpy<00:02:45.070> and<00:02:46.070> it<00:02:46.370> is<00:02:46.720> 1:40

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
a little bit jumpy and it is 1:40

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.990 
a little bit jumpy and it is 1:40
fantastic<00:02:49.750> we'll<00:02:50.750> be<00:02:50.870> looking<00:02:51.019> at<00:02:51.260> tomorrow

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
fantastic we'll be looking at tomorrow

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.300 
fantastic we'll be looking at tomorrow
close<00:02:53.000> enough<00:02:53.239> so<00:02:54.049> the<00:02:54.560> LED<00:02:54.920> isn't<00:02:55.190> programmed

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
close enough so the LED isn't programmed

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.990 
close enough so the LED isn't programmed
to<00:02:55.519> do<00:02:55.579> anything<00:02:55.820> yet<00:02:55.970> because<00:02:56.120> it's<00:02:56.840> 142<00:02:57.620> and

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
to do anything yet because it's 142 and

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.280 
to do anything yet because it's 142 and
just<00:02:59.000> let<00:02:59.120> it<00:02:59.209> show<00:02:59.329> you<00:02:59.390> that<00:02:59.540> and<00:02:59.720> this<00:03:00.170> is

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
just let it show you that and this is

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:01.210 
just let it show you that and this is
the<00:03:00.380> other<00:03:00.470> button<00:03:00.709> here<00:03:00.829> to<00:03:00.890> slow<00:03:01.100> it<00:03:01.190> down

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
the other button here to slow it down

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.600 
the other button here to slow it down
again

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
again

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:14.700 
again
restart<00:03:02.030> the<00:03:02.120> process<00:03:02.739> thanks

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:14.710 

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:16.770 

you
