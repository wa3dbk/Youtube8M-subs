00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 
surfboards and I guess I would call this

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.529 
surfboards and I guess I would call this
in<00:00:46.010> the<00:00:46.100> beginning<00:00:46.460> it<00:00:46.670> was<00:00:46.789> like<00:00:46.910> a<00:00:46.940> wild

00:00:47.529 --> 00:00:47.539

in the beginning it was like a wild
bucking<00:00:48.140> bronco<00:00:48.590> that<00:00:48.800> needed<00:00:49.070> to<00:00:49.129> be<00:00:49.190> tamed<00:00:49.579> I

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:49.879 
bucking bronco that needed to be tamed I

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:52.479 
bucking bronco that needed to be tamed I
knew<00:00:50.449> it<00:00:50.539> was<00:00:50.660> fast<00:00:50.989> and<00:00:51.260> lively<00:00:51.739> but<00:00:51.769> I<00:00:52.250> just

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:52.489 
knew it was fast and lively but I just

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:53.770 
knew it was fast and lively but I just
needed<00:00:52.699> to<00:00:52.850> figure<00:00:53.089> out<00:00:53.210> how<00:00:53.329> to<00:00:53.359> get<00:00:53.660> it<00:00:53.750> to

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780 
needed to figure out how to get it to

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.229 
needed to figure out how to get it to
settle<00:00:54.170> and<00:00:54.440> in<00:00:55.399> the<00:00:55.489> beginning<00:00:55.879> you<00:00:55.969> know<00:00:56.089> I'd

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239

that<00:01:14.870> the<00:01:15.110> transition<00:01:15.470> from<00:01:15.800> maybe<00:01:16.100> you<00:01:16.280> know

00:01:16.389 --> 00:01:16.399 
that the transition from maybe you know

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:18.969 
that the transition from maybe you know
more<00:01:16.579> high-performance<00:01:17.390> boards<00:01:17.750> in<00:01:18.380> the<00:01:18.799> loss

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
more high-performance boards in the loss

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:21.190

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:40.539 
cruise you're more oblong shapes
sometimes<00:01:39.710> you<00:01:39.860> still<00:01:39.979> want<00:01:40.159> to<00:01:40.189> get<00:01:40.280> a<00:01:40.340> bit<00:01:40.460> of

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 
sometimes you still want to get a bit of

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:41.620 
sometimes you still want to get a bit of
performance<00:01:40.759> when<00:01:41.060> you're<00:01:41.149> serving<00:01:41.299> some<00:01:41.539> all

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
performance when you're serving some all

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.120 
performance when you're serving some all
the<00:01:41.689> waves<00:01:41.869> so<00:01:42.380> you<00:01:42.439> can<00:01:42.560> see<00:01:42.680> it's<00:01:42.829> got<00:01:42.979> this

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
the waves so you can see it's got this

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.219 
the waves so you can see it's got this
you<00:01:43.640> know<00:01:43.729> kind<00:01:43.909> of<00:01:43.969> pulled<00:01:44.180> in<00:01:44.299> more<00:01:44.509> short<00:01:44.960> or

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
you know kind of pulled in more short or

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:47.529 
you know kind of pulled in more short or
more<00:01:45.710> short<00:01:46.009> board<00:01:46.219> he<00:01:46.280> knows<00:01:46.490> and<00:01:47.390> then<00:01:47.479> it

00:01:47.529 --> 00:01:47.539 
more short board he knows and then it

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:49.270 
more short board he knows and then it
comes<00:01:47.719> back<00:01:47.780> and<00:01:47.960> and<00:01:48.619> he<00:01:48.710> pulls<00:01:48.920> the<00:01:49.100> rail

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
comes back and and he pulls the rail

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.060 
comes back and and he pulls the rail
line<00:01:49.520> into<00:01:49.939> this<00:01:50.060> little<00:01:50.539> I<00:01:50.990> think<00:01:51.740> he<00:01:51.860> calls

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
line into this little I think he calls

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.639 
line into this little I think he calls
it<00:01:52.189> a<00:01:52.280> split<00:01:52.820> Swallowtail<00:01:53.539> I<00:01:53.780> would<00:01:54.350> call<00:01:54.500> like

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649 
it a split Swallowtail I would call like

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:58.420 
it a split Swallowtail I would call like
an<00:01:54.799> arc<00:01:54.979> Swallowtail<00:01:55.789> or<00:01:56.259> you<00:01:57.259> know<00:01:57.350> uh<00:01:57.430> but

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
an arc Swallowtail or you know uh but

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.120 
an arc Swallowtail or you know uh but
diamond<00:01:58.759> tail<00:01:58.939> and<00:01:59.649> you<00:02:00.649> know<00:02:00.680> he<00:02:00.799> pulls<00:02:01.039> the

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
diamond tail and you know he pulls the

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.099 
diamond tail and you know he pulls the
rail<00:02:01.280> line<00:02:01.460> in<00:02:01.609> here<00:02:01.789> and<00:02:01.880> then<00:02:01.969> you<00:02:02.659> know<00:02:02.750> you

00:02:03.099 --> 00:02:03.109 
rail line in here and then you know you

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:04.359 
rail line in here and then you know you
would<00:02:03.229> see<00:02:03.380> the<00:02:03.469> art<00:02:03.619> coming<00:02:03.890> across<00:02:04.009> here<00:02:04.100> if

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
would see the art coming across here if

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:06.190 
would see the art coming across here if
he's<00:02:04.490> taking<00:02:04.700> this<00:02:04.759> big<00:02:04.969> chunk<00:02:05.240> out<00:02:05.329> of<00:02:05.450> it<00:02:05.600> I

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
he's taking this big chunk out of it I

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.420 
he's taking this big chunk out of it I
like<00:02:06.590> these<00:02:06.770> tails<00:02:07.009> I<00:02:07.070> think<00:02:07.189> they're<00:02:07.280> really

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.430 
like these tails I think they're really

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:08.650 
like these tails I think they're really
cool<00:02:07.700> and<00:02:07.880> you<00:02:07.939> see<00:02:08.119> them<00:02:08.270> on<00:02:08.330> a<00:02:08.390> few<00:02:08.570> different

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
cool and you see them on a few different

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.330 
cool and you see them on a few different
designs<00:02:08.869> these<00:02:09.259> days<00:02:09.470> I<00:02:09.679> think<00:02:09.920> they<00:02:10.130> give<00:02:10.280> you

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
designs these days I think they give you

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:11.620 
designs these days I think they give you
a<00:02:10.399> lot<00:02:10.520> of<00:02:10.670> Drive<00:02:10.880> but<00:02:11.120> they<00:02:11.180> also<00:02:11.300> give<00:02:11.510> you<00:02:11.570> a

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
a lot of Drive but they also give you a

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.600 
a lot of Drive but they also give you a
lot<00:02:11.750> of<00:02:11.780> release<00:02:12.380> which<00:02:12.680> is<00:02:12.710> really<00:02:13.340> important

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
lot of release which is really important

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:14.830 
lot of release which is really important
some<00:02:13.730> all<00:02:13.790> the<00:02:13.850> ways<00:02:13.970> with<00:02:14.210> a<00:02:14.240> drive<00:02:14.510> to<00:02:14.720> get

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
some all the ways with a drive to get

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.600 
some all the ways with a drive to get
going<00:02:15.230> in<00:02:15.410> smaller<00:02:15.680> surf<00:02:15.920> and<00:02:16.130> then<00:02:16.280> you<00:02:16.370> want

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
going in smaller surf and then you want

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.430 
going in smaller surf and then you want
to<00:02:17.060> be<00:02:17.150> able<00:02:17.330> to<00:02:17.420> release<00:02:17.690> and<00:02:17.930> turn<00:02:18.110> the<00:02:18.260> board

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
to be able to release and turn the board

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.380 
to be able to release and turn the board
once<00:02:18.650> you<00:02:18.710> got<00:02:18.830> a<00:02:18.860> bit<00:02:19.070> speed<00:02:19.280> so<00:02:19.520> that<00:02:19.730> type<00:02:20.360> of

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
once you got a bit speed so that type of

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.720 
once you got a bit speed so that type of
tail<00:02:20.690> I<00:02:20.720> think<00:02:21.020> is<00:02:21.110> really<00:02:21.320> cool<00:02:21.650> for<00:02:22.340> surfing

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
tail I think is really cool for surfing

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.670 
tail I think is really cool for surfing
kind<00:02:23.240> of<00:02:23.330> small<00:02:23.570> to<00:02:23.750> medium<00:02:23.780> sized<00:02:24.230> waves<00:02:24.470> you

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
know I surf this problem

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.650 
know I surf this problem
kind<00:02:27.400> of<00:02:27.459> waste<00:02:27.730> up<00:02:28.060> to<00:02:28.090> you<00:02:28.540> know
