00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.240
 hello out here and love a lot 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:15.190
 thanks for turning on today there is something 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.600
 delicious for grilling or for the 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:18.730
 big pan if you like the big one 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:21.670
 Hunger packs and delicious beat steaks 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.930
 or also called important where now that 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.430
 originally came from the court 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:26.260
 I do not know exactly 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.520
 tastes super smaller in any case 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.080
 tip in advance picks you in any case 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.520
 a real feta cheese for example 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.650
 now be the cheese from the 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.239
 supermarket from the shelf he takes occurs 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.290
 mostly made of cow's milk and what's called 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:36.760
 usually it's always off 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.260
 Cow's milk is a bit 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.270
 But it does not taste cheaper either 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.860
 so very intense so I give the tip 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.500
 put euro more on the counter or 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.630
 get great c or even delicious 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.350
 Sheep cheese tastes spicier you will 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:50.410
 Do not regret it 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.149
 The preparation time is about 20 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.590
 minutes if you a little time that 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:56.020
 you like me today about 30 minutes 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.550
 then off to the pan you can do it 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.629
 It's easy to cook even after that 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.399
 wrap in aluminum foil 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:01.719
 if you have fried pretty crispy 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:04.089
 then just put it in the oven 

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:05.229
 or just simply place the grill because 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:07.630
 to stew a bit 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:09.280
 otherwise lower 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.660
 just allow the temperature to continue cooking 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.039
 in japan are running barbecue 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:13.450
 So just talk on the grill 

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:15.280
 do not live a whole bit better 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.860
 joke and I wish you 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.060
 Have a good appetite 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.670
 in the first step we need one 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.470
 medium onion and the cut 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:27.369
 we just short quickly into little fine 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:31.650
 dice then we go the onions in addition 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:33.220
 just give cattle chopped 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.080
 is interrupted something 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.250
 colorful parsley you can do it 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.020
 also like to have had before 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:42.130
 i like to leave you a little dull and in the mood 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:43.300
 when the eggs are added and then 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.190
 I'm just resting fast 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:49.030
 spice mixture with salt pepper and 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:51.670
 then paprika powder as needed one to 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:54.300
 Two teaspoons to the garden give something 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:59.440
 fresh herbs of uno or thyme and 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:01.210
 a good shot soy sauce and to 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.009
 Finally I have one or two here 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.770
 I slice in the water before 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:08.709
 just softened short too 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:11.040
 Crumb and then all right 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:11.040
 mix 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:17.170
 After that, about one minute is the day ready 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:20.230
 then we need one more now 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:22.180
 Deep duck plates are the best 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.620
 do not wash out some water 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:28.280
 liable 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:31.890
 if the pact meat spread something 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:34.220
 in feta cheese to give nicely in the 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.220
 Laying center 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:41.340
 There is still room for a small one 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:44.310
 slice and then the whole of 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.780
 outside folded inwards 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.430
 that no small groups or 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.120
 cracks occur because otherwise the fetakÃ¤se 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:53.820
 could expire 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:55.440
 so may also be closed again and there 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:58.800
 we need another pan of some oil 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:03.210
 heat up and then first of both 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:05.520
 Fry pages pretty sharp and then 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:07.590
 the deepstack on both sides for 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.600
 about ten minutes to spend 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.770
 medium heat 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.810
 I wish you a lot in any case 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:15.050
 enjoy cooking and a good one 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.050
 appetite 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.860
 I hope I could give you a little bit 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.330
 make hunger and the video has you 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.370
 she just likes to write in 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.600
 The comments also rank your opinion 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.520
 perhaps if only something or 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.660
 I have a question I try it too 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.040
 answer even if the time sometimes 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.260
 a bit short 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.790
 Furthermore , of course, there under 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.290
 worker video look if still 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.030
 needs a few suggestions or more 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.390
 have more time and watch videos 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:45.700
 want and great news end 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:48.460
 of the month, there is a new website around you 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.930
 the reading of recipes just still 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:51.940
 more exciting and visually beautiful too 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.350
 So in any case I will shape 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.850
 more often rough construction still lasts 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:56.260
 So I will not be there for long 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:57.970
 two more weeks until the end of the month 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.620
 was also already why this month 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.060
 yes and then I wish you on everyone 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.470
 Have fun watching 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.540
 do not forget to subscribe if it still is 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.100
 did not comment below 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.930
 What you did not like vacation 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:09.910
 i like criticism how much 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.390
