00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.149
 this video that was to speak of the un with images but before that I want to be 

00:00:04.149 --> 00:00:07.470
 a review of the fías want and want to exile that the e-coli 

00:00:08.249 --> 00:00:11.129
 remember kléber coli if he had ten steps 

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:14.129
 the first step of mucus except things and phosphate 

00:00:14.659 --> 00:00:20.039
 edelnor review it lukoki nasa in the liver and also the former councilor nasa in the 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.369
 rest cells 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:23.159
 and this is a step 

00:00:23.159 --> 00:00:25.730
 tp hardware store 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:26.919
 Thus 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:30.259
 this level the first step that is and is reversible 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:33.380
 if my life and actress suffers 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:38.090
 the enzyme that does the opposite happen of 1 things and phosphate talked thing get done 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.400
 one thing psychopaths and the one that is bad 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.320
 in the dinner 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:42.630
 I answered 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:44.160
 it's type 1 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.910
 the second step that go tell you the passage of fructose is phosphate brought sahagun 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:50.460
 or six of phosphate 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.800
 but we have to add that no agreement 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.910
 We are going again to use a pepe molecule 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.000
 i the enzyme that make the opposite area more fruitful sheikh yusuf home 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:06.170
 and finally the last ethical and reversible was the way 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.340
 it was the last historical step lysyj that the passage of the foc pyruvate zone 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.950
 activate yourself for the day of the photo in inalsa 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:21.160
 i the turn attend pyruvate are not direct not only an enzyme but they are going 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.190
 to accept enzymes that we are going to review 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:25.130
 then 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.620
 until motorland where even neon genesis is 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:33.460
 we are creating the glucose molecule we are not willing to destroy lycopene 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.540
 but we are 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.500
 creating the molecular north 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.580
 We can have different substrates 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.580
 but our ultimate goal is to make crazy 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:48.080
 one way may be to break down muscle tissue and eventually the girl will lead 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.330
 i the alanine 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:51.500
 to convert 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.980
 some way to throw everything 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:55.570
 and effective act 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.670
 somehow become crazy 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.749
 there are other ways lactate day lactate 

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:04.020
 is going to convert to pyruvate 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.480
 jorge lanata that I decide others 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.010
 and there must be some way where 

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:12.750
 by the way the veto that they became too fatty we have have made 

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:14.889
 and is that they said 

00:02:14.889 --> 00:02:16.619
 Finally 

00:02:16.619 --> 00:02:19.859
 for different days it will become unique 

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:22.859
 then we are going to go by each one 

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:28.309
 then the first thing we have to mine or lactate to pass to you lobato 

00:02:29.029 --> 00:02:32.579
 and how we take you from attack a molecule that they have 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:33.759
 fish monkeys 

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:37.029
 spoke thing that a molecule was loaded to more 

00:02:37.029 --> 00:02:40.450
 if we remember him from cycle three we had that he pulled high 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:44.780
 had to enter the mitochondria since the mitochondria were on top 

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:48.209
 pyruvate dehydrogenase that was capable 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.549
 you pass acetic pyruvate to 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:53.750
 and it is over to use without coconut factors 

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:57.789
 according to the phrase 

00:02:57.789 --> 00:02:59.859
 slaughter kandahar 

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:02.889
 that there was mine p fac 

00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:04.779
 cheese factory vitamin b2 

00:03:04.779 --> 00:03:07.959
 n for nothing that would be the cinema pl 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:10.959
 and pirit like that and get 

00:03:11.469 --> 00:03:14.469
 but let's start a crazy or neo genesis 

00:03:14.469 --> 00:03:17.909
 the other way then what and the canoe all instead of becoming 

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:19.219
 he explained to 

00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:20.699
 become 

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:22.389
 oksana was tried 

00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:26.969
 and what sara was treated has 4 carbon yes but this has 3 carbon so 

00:03:26.969 --> 00:03:27.759
 so much 

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:30.809
 we have to give him a charge, do not be pyruvate 

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:33.090
 and on top of that, I ask all of you 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:34.489
 carazo squares 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:37.669
 this enzyme pyruvate carboxylase 

00:03:37.669 --> 00:03:40.049
 two important characteristics 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:44.909
 the first characteristic is that he miscalculated factors historical factors 

00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:47.849
 of c 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:50.919
 where arts for at &amp; t 

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:53.129
 for biotin 

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:55.539
 today ends seven 

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:57.830
 I made it is adopted 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:59.759
 take out the coal 

00:03:59.759 --> 00:04:02.099
 but the other was headquarters that has 

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:04.750
 and that is on top of a hill 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:06.779
 what you need to work 

00:04:06.779 --> 00:04:09.899
 the presence repase tylko over 

00:04:09.899 --> 00:04:13.689
 here comes the whole inclusion of the enzyme that heals the pericos josé to 

00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:16.549
 that their function improves when according to ligand 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:18.120
 and the agency more than they are 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.919
 mandatory that they need the ligand to be able 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:22.529
 activate 

00:04:22.529 --> 00:04:26.079
 and he rest inactive from this ammunition flower of a protein 

00:04:26.969 --> 00:04:29.309
 that at rest is inactive 

00:04:29.309 --> 00:04:32.559
 iulia mind needs the aesthetic presence 

00:04:32.559 --> 00:04:35.150
 then this set and the quad 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:39.069
 on the one hand imminent to the enzyme pivato say alien to 

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:41.480
 And on the other hand 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.500
 active above piru to play box and lassad 

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:49.329
 and forces him to act and convert the pyro cat pa oksana zeta 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:52.430
 corpacci that has 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:53.969
 4 4 

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:55.689
 you take away then 

00:04:55.689 --> 00:04:59.669
 we are in the mitochondria that occurred san jose 14 and this one to pass is about 

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:01.210
 has to exit plasma success 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:04.180
 and when it is very well the cytoplasm that does not pass was not treated 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.979
 to remember x4 carbons will make it flabby 

00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:09.880
 pyruvate 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.470
 and this forum are old tour basil way to the production of glucose 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:18.520
 sara sector the cascade of ico and xix backwards and the enzyme what is this 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:23.830
 it has to be an enzyme that gives a fulop duck and those who removed carbon 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:25.900
 because it assumes pilot has three carbon 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:27.930
 therefore the enzyme is called 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:28.740
 flabby 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:30.659
 enol pyruvate 

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:32.009
 karp boxing 

00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:33.719
 machines 

00:05:33.719 --> 00:05:37.150
 and as always when fox toast 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:40.410
 they are touring therefore in the environment 

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:44.449
 the house camper voucher so we are 

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:47.490
 and the million dollar question 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:49.430
 who regulates this enzyme 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:53.440
 remember that we are in a state of war and a prolonged one therefore not 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.330
 there are crazy to therefore there is no insulin 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:01.190
 the Mexican norm are like those whose end in life this would increase the 

00:06:01.189 --> 00:06:02.219
 pretty cost 

00:06:02.219 --> 00:06:03.509
 so 

00:06:03.509 --> 00:06:05.990
 it's regular at the genetic level 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:08.219
 villa luca mont 

00:06:08.219 --> 00:06:09.180
 and villa 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:09.710
 cortizo
