00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:16.900
 stand jaguar the new f-type here 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:20.199
 presented in 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:24.620
 steurs at first a 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:27.070
 beautiful two-seater convertible 

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:29.300
 competitor of the porsche boxster 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.220
 that's what attracts children 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.060
 dream everyone 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.060
 old people like young people 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.770
 then there is design matter 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.810
 ilian callum is outdated 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.680
 one more time 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:47.950
 the great designer 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.950
 English 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:57.800
 a beautiful pencil stroke voice so 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:01:00.500
 the cabin perfectly worked 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:03.670
 also but that if a handful of 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:06.220
 passenger maintenance way audi r8 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.170
 if we can see the automatic and 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:11.520
 the boot button start system 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.520
 and stands in 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.670
 find the pallets driving they 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.270
 flying three branches instrumentation 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.270
 very classic 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:23.000
 he 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.890
 quality leather upholstery and I like 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.510
 a lot too 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:31.580
 the rims 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:35.410
 the carbon base on pirelli p 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.410
 zero the very sporty 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:43.040
 already see 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:45.200
 hold a look to devour the bitumen that 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:49.549
 in my opinion does not have that look keenly 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:53.869
 the test on super on me here is the concept 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:54.860
 The air of 260 horses is always the 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:57.380
 addictive thp 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.840
 so there it is well boosted in a 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:04.220
 matte paint with a nice fin to 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:06.289
 the back we can see here and we're going 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:09.050
 ask nicolas gourdol of motors ge 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:12.110
 wear what they think of this rcz 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.430
 is a super nice and well it's nice 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.930
 it's nice that they did that they 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.100
 did that it was a little 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.049
 waited anyway had to go 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.330
 beat with with ronan with megan 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:21.680
 more than 135 horsepower and then with chassis 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.690
 everyone pay a little of the chassis 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.340
 which was not exploited enough are you there 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.959
 delegates doc that I met philippe 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.190
 gue who on a circuit that the knife 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:31.830
 and a few months that we can see 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.850
 scroll through pbs who participated in 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.819
 development who participated in 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.010
 a lot of 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:37.810
 the cars tchi tchi psa versions 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.999
 so he participated in the 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.159
 development so I think that's 

00:02:39.999 --> 00:02:44.400
 a car a little symbolic to what he 

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:44.400
 must there too 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.959
 then this is absolutely great is 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:55.130
 full keys presents us a version 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:58.180
 Continental GT 3 A Racing Version Of 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:02.030
 its top-of-the-range gto 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:07.910
 this is the big comeback of bentley in 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:09.440
 competition on the Lamborghini stand on 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.959
 can see a very nice diaper 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:14.720
 I'm obviously talking about that of the 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:18.980
 new restyled gallardo this is here 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:20.870
 of the lp 560-4 version so nothing 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.370
 actually changes it's just a 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.590
 simple restyling 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:27.560
 besides, the front is almost 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:31.459
 identical to that of the old 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:34.510
 generation that can be seen here in 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:34.510
 superleggera version 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.330
 going 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.209
 we're leaving because we're going to believe 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.349
 includes video hostesses and it's not 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:46.560
 at all the style of the house 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:48.329
 we still passed this stage of the 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.079
 woman object is not it a little word 

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:51.079
 nothing has done
