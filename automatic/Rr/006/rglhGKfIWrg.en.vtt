so<00:02:41.130> what<00:02:41.580> I<00:02:41.610> am<00:02:41.820> going<00:02:42.000> to<00:02:42.090> do<00:02:42.209> is<00:02:42.450> going<00:02:42.690> to<00:02:42.810> put

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
so what I am going to do is going to put

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:45.650 
so what I am going to do is going to put
it<00:02:43.140> in<00:02:43.260> again<00:02:43.620> I<00:02:44.100> am<00:02:44.580> going<00:02:44.760> to<00:02:44.880> cover<00:02:45.120> this<00:02:45.360> and

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
it in again I am going to cover this and

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.210 
it in again I am going to cover this and
put<00:02:45.959> it<00:02:46.080> in<00:02:46.230> the<00:02:46.470> wrong<00:02:47.160> place<00:02:47.340> again<00:02:47.850> about<00:02:49.220> 30

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
put it in the wrong place again about 30

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.539 
put it in the wrong place again about 30
minutes<00:02:50.670> until<00:02:51.180> this<00:02:51.360> doubles<00:02:51.840> in<00:02:52.019> size<00:02:52.549> the

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:53.549 
minutes until this doubles in size the

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:56.300 
minutes until this doubles in size the
if<00:02:53.850> you<00:02:54.030> can't<00:02:54.510> find<00:02:54.870> a<00:02:55.049> very<00:02:55.260> warm<00:02:55.530> spot<00:02:55.980> to

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
if you can't find a very warm spot to

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.729 
if you can't find a very warm spot to
believe<00:02:56.519> this<00:02:56.820> it's<00:02:57.150> a<00:02:57.750> good<00:02:57.900> idea<00:02:58.110> that<00:02:58.590> you

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
believe this it's a good idea that you

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:01.880 
believe this it's a good idea that you
switch<00:02:59.010> on<00:02:59.190> the<00:02:59.370> oven<00:02:59.519> to<00:02:59.670> 30<00:03:00.060> or<00:03:00.680> 40<00:03:01.680> and

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
switch on the oven to 30 or 40 and

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.030 
switch on the oven to 30 or 40 and
switch<00:03:02.579> it<00:03:02.760> off<00:03:02.910> and<00:03:03.299> leave<00:03:03.600> this<00:03:03.840> in<00:03:04.110> then<00:03:04.829> it

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
switch it off and leave this in then it

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.940 
switch it off and leave this in then it
proves<00:03:05.370> very<00:03:05.760> quickly

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
proves very quickly

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.180
