question any theories on how an alien
gets<00:01:14.210> into<00:01:14.450> a<00:01:14.479> tree<00:01:15.100> well<00:01:16.100> like<00:01:16.970> I<00:01:17.090> said

00:01:17.139 --> 00:01:17.149 
gets into a tree well like I said

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:19.389 
gets into a tree well like I said
earlier<00:01:17.360> I<00:01:17.810> said<00:01:17.990> I<00:01:18.200> think<00:01:18.710> maybe<00:01:18.890> he's<00:01:19.100> coming

00:01:19.389 --> 00:01:19.399 
earlier I said I think maybe he's coming

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:21.310 
earlier I said I think maybe he's coming
to<00:01:19.490> visit<00:01:19.670> and<00:01:19.880> he<00:01:20.149> had<00:01:20.330> a<00:01:20.360> bad<00:01:20.630> landing<00:01:20.899> any

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
to visit and he had a bad landing any

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.350 
to visit and he had a bad landing any
wound<00:01:21.649> up<00:01:21.860> in<00:01:22.009> a<00:01:22.100> tree<00:01:22.310> I<00:01:22.340> mean<00:01:22.640> if<00:01:23.000> you<00:01:23.240> were

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
wound up in a tree I mean if you were

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.029 
wound up in a tree I mean if you were
going<00:01:23.539> to<00:01:23.630> crash<00:01:23.990> wouldn't<00:01:24.530> you<00:01:24.649> have<00:01:24.830> that

00:01:25.029 --> 00:01:25.039 
going to crash wouldn't you have that

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:28.240 
going to crash wouldn't you have that
expression<00:01:25.399> on<00:01:25.759> your<00:01:25.970> face<00:01:26.030> I<00:01:26.800> know<00:01:27.800> that<00:01:28.220> I

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
expression on your face I know that I

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.609 
expression on your face I know that I
would<00:01:28.700> so<00:01:29.060> it's<00:01:29.330> probably<00:01:29.600> what<00:01:30.050> happened<00:01:30.229> and

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
would so it's probably what happened and

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:32.710 
would so it's probably what happened and
this<00:01:31.039> is<00:01:31.280> a<00:01:31.310> pine<00:01:31.700> tree<00:01:31.729> so<00:01:32.179> what<00:01:32.330> we<00:01:32.450> have<00:01:32.690> here

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 
this is a pine tree so what we have here

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.109 
this is a pine tree so what we have here
is<00:01:33.200> close<00:01:33.740> encounters<00:01:34.369> of<00:01:34.399> the<00:01:34.640> coniferous

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
is close encounters of the coniferous

00:01:35.119 --> 00:02:00.550 
is close encounters of the coniferous
kind<00:01:35.630> that's<00:01:36.020> correct<00:01:36.350> yeah<00:01:37.009> that<00:01:37.580> sums<00:01:38.569> it<00:01:38.660> up

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.990 

and<00:02:01.560> you<00:02:01.650> have<00:02:01.770> an<00:02:01.860> affectionate<00:02:02.610> sort<00:02:02.910> of

I know the the stumps have been taken
away<00:02:23.400> into<00:02:24.030> them<00:02:24.300> and<00:02:24.480> would<00:02:25.110> chipped<00:02:25.380> up<00:02:25.590> in<00:02:25.830> a

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
away into them and would chipped up in a

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.300 
away into them and would chipped up in a
massive<00:02:26.330> commercial<00:02:27.330> wood<00:02:27.780> chipper

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
massive commercial wood chipper

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.950 
massive commercial wood chipper
unfortunately<00:02:29.310> we<00:02:30.060> got<00:02:30.270> the<00:02:30.420> photographs
