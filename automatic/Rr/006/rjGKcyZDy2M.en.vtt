that too bad you're dishonouring your

seireitei after they get up get promoted

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.649 
seireitei after they get up get promoted
i<00:02:05.310> guess<00:02:05.490> it's<00:02:05.640> just<00:02:05.700> instilled<00:02:06.210> in<00:02:06.329> them<00:02:06.360> hey

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
i guess it's just instilled in them hey

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.869 
i guess it's just instilled in them hey
forget<00:02:07.590> about<00:02:07.649> soul<00:02:08.190> society<00:02:08.580> it's<00:02:08.700> kind<00:02:08.849> of

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
forget about soul society it's kind of

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.010 
forget about soul society it's kind of
weird<00:02:09.060> because<00:02:09.149> you<00:02:09.390> know<00:02:09.479> they<00:02:09.660> were

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
weird because you know they were

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.559 
weird because you know they were
captains<00:02:10.709> down<00:02:10.890> there<00:02:11.069> at<00:02:11.190> one<00:02:11.310> point

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
captains down there at one point

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:13.580 
captains down there at one point
apparently<00:02:12.569> all<00:02:12.810> of<00:02:13.050> them

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
apparently all of them

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:14.690 
apparently all of them
so<00:02:13.860> you'd<00:02:14.010> think<00:02:14.129> they<00:02:14.310> would<00:02:14.430> still<00:02:14.580> have

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
so you'd think they would still have

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.009 
so you'd think they would still have
some<00:02:14.849> attachment<00:02:15.330> but<00:02:15.450> I<00:02:15.480> guess<00:02:15.629> after<00:02:15.870> a

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
some attachment but I guess after a

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:18.320 
some attachment but I guess after a
while<00:02:16.349> because<00:02:16.680> it's<00:02:17.010> been<00:02:17.160> a<00:02:17.220> while<00:02:17.489> they

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
while because it's been a while they

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.780 
while because it's been a while they
just<00:02:18.569> kind<00:02:18.780> of<00:02:18.900> that<00:02:19.890> kind<00:02:20.040> of<00:02:20.129> accepted<00:02:20.610> like

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
just kind of that kind of accepted like

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.280 
just kind of that kind of accepted like
that's<00:02:21.030> not<00:02:21.180> our<00:02:21.330> job<00:02:21.360> anymore<00:02:21.810> we<00:02:22.050> can't

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
that's not our job anymore we can't

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.800 
that's not our job anymore we can't
worry<00:02:23.010> about<00:02:23.099> that<00:02:23.280> and<00:02:23.640> I<00:02:24.060> think<00:02:24.090> one<00:02:24.599> of<00:02:24.629> the

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
worry about that and I think one of the

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.900 
worry about that and I think one of the
guys<00:02:25.019> the<00:02:25.319> main<00:02:25.500> guy's<00:02:25.709> name<00:02:26.069> might<00:02:26.310> be<00:02:26.340> bonds

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
guys the main guy's name might be bonds

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.119 
guys the main guy's name might be bonds
a<00:02:27.209> that's<00:02:27.569> what<00:02:27.720> key<00:02:27.930> ork<00:02:28.110> who<00:02:28.290> says<00:02:28.560> but<00:02:28.920> i

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:29.129 
a that's what key ork who says but i

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:30.470 
a that's what key ork who says but i
don't<00:02:29.550> know<00:02:29.610> maybe<00:02:29.790> he's<00:02:29.970> just<00:02:30.060> saying<00:02:30.209> bonds

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
don't know maybe he's just saying bonds

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.119 
don't know maybe he's just saying bonds
i<00:02:30.690> don't<00:02:30.989> know<00:02:31.080> my<00:02:31.200> views<00:02:31.410> await<00:02:31.650> translation

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:32.129 
i don't know my views await translation

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:33.500 
i don't know my views await translation
but<00:02:32.250> he<00:02:32.549> says<00:02:32.760> that<00:02:32.790> so<00:02:33.090> I'm<00:02:33.180> guessing<00:02:33.330> that's

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
but he says that so I'm guessing that's

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.150 
but he says that so I'm guessing that's
name<00:02:33.750> of<00:02:33.840> the<00:02:33.900> main<00:02:34.019> guy<00:02:34.200> but<00:02:34.709> he<00:02:34.769> says<00:02:34.950> they're

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
name of the main guy but he says they're

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.400 
name of the main guy but he says they're
there<00:02:35.340> to<00:02:35.489> rebuild<00:02:35.849> soul<00:02:36.120> society<00:02:36.629> so<00:02:37.290> I<00:02:37.319> guess

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
there to rebuild soul society so I guess

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:38.809 
there to rebuild soul society so I guess
they<00:02:37.769> don't<00:02:37.980> have<00:02:38.099> to<00:02:38.250> protect<00:02:38.489> it<00:02:38.610> but<00:02:38.700> they

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
they don't have to protect it but they

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:40.910 
they don't have to protect it but they
kind<00:02:38.970> of<00:02:39.000> rebuild<00:02:39.360> it<00:02:39.569> I<00:02:39.690> don't<00:02:39.870> know<00:02:39.959> wouldn't

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
kind of rebuild it I don't know wouldn't

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.650 
kind of rebuild it I don't know wouldn't
it<00:02:40.980> be<00:02:41.010> easier<00:02:41.069> for<00:02:41.310> a<00:02:41.489> group<00:02:42.269> of<00:02:42.390> people

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
it be easier for a group of people

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.150 
it be easier for a group of people
rather<00:02:42.840> than<00:02:42.989> five<00:02:43.260> people<00:02:43.440> I<00:02:43.680> don't<00:02:43.860> know<00:02:43.920> and

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
rather than five people I don't know and

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.850 
rather than five people I don't know and
they're<00:02:44.549> going<00:02:44.670> to<00:02:44.730> take<00:02:44.940> Ichigo<00:02:45.510> to<00:02:46.230> this

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
they're going to take Ichigo to this

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.789 
they're going to take Ichigo to this
whole<00:02:47.010> cake<00:02:47.250> I<00:02:47.720> don't<00:02:48.720> know<00:02:48.780> why<00:02:48.959> it<00:02:49.319> could<00:02:49.620> be

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799 
whole cake I don't know why it could be

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:51.920 
whole cake I don't know why it could be
for<00:02:50.069> many<00:02:50.400> reasons<00:02:50.760> one<00:02:51.000> because<00:02:51.239> Ichigo<00:02:51.690> is

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
for many reasons one because Ichigo is

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.380 
for many reasons one because Ichigo is
you<00:02:52.470> know<00:02:52.590> super<00:02:53.310> awesome<00:02:53.849> for<00:02:53.880> whatever

apparently was also squad 12 at one
point<00:03:46.049> I<00:03:46.169> guess<00:03:46.230> she<00:03:46.470> was<00:03:46.590> captain<00:03:46.980> before

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160

point I guess she was captain before
kirio<00:03:47.880> I<00:03:47.940> guess<00:03:48.419> cuz<00:03:48.720> she<00:03:48.930> was<00:03:49.049> talking<00:03:49.319> about

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
kirio I guess cuz she was talking about

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.289 
kirio I guess cuz she was talking about
she<00:03:49.709> broke<00:03:50.160> into<00:03:50.310> my<00:03:50.549> Yuri's<00:03:50.849> lab<00:03:51.060> and

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
she broke into my Yuri's lab and

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:52.759 
she broke into my Yuri's lab and
basically<00:03:51.569> by<00:03:51.810> touching<00:03:52.079> the<00:03:52.349> door<00:03:52.500> she's

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
basically by touching the door she's

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:54.680 
basically by touching the door she's
like<00:03:52.889> oh<00:03:53.040> that<00:03:53.639> was<00:03:53.790> way<00:03:53.940> more<00:03:53.970> secure<00:03:54.510> when<00:03:54.630> I

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
like oh that was way more secure when I

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.930 
like oh that was way more secure when I
was<00:03:55.139> there<00:03:55.410> so<00:03:55.859> I<00:03:55.889> guess<00:03:56.160> she<00:03:56.400> was<00:03:56.519> the<00:03:56.609> captain

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:56.240 
like if it was grimmjow him just like
walking<00:05:54.240> in<00:05:54.479> this<00:05:54.600> whole<00:05:54.870> society<00:05:55.470> that'd<00:05:56.220> be

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:56.250 
walking in this whole society that'd be

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:57.710 
walking in this whole society that'd be
pretty<00:05:56.520> weird<00:05:56.850> i<00:05:56.940> don't<00:05:56.970> think<00:05:57.180> that<00:05:57.510> would

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:57.720 
pretty weird i don't think that would

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:59.060 
pretty weird i don't think that would
work<00:05:57.780> but<00:05:58.169> they<00:05:58.590> might<00:05:58.740> have<00:05:58.830> just<00:05:58.919> been

00:05:59.060 --> 00:05:59.070 
work but they might have just been

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:01.670 
work but they might have just been
calling<00:05:59.520> or<00:05:59.669> something<00:06:00.060> but<00:06:00.780> either<00:06:01.110> way<00:06:01.410> i

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:01.680 
calling or something but either way i

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.710 
calling or something but either way i
still<00:06:02.640> think<00:06:02.729> it's<00:06:02.880> grimmjow<00:06:03.210> no<00:06:03.450> one<00:06:03.570> else

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:03.720 
still think it's grimmjow no one else

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.480 
still think it's grimmjow no one else
really<00:06:03.870> makes<00:06:04.110> sense<00:06:04.320> to<00:06:04.500> me<00:06:04.650> but<00:06:05.370> hopefully

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:05.490 
really makes sense to me but hopefully

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:07.280 
really makes sense to me but hopefully
