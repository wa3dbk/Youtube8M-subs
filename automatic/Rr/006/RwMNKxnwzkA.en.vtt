00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:39.780 
apple and what it can it's just voice

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:41.330 
apple and what it can it's just voice

for<00:05:41.790> example<00:05:42.270> we<00:05:42.420> are<00:05:42.570> looking<00:05:43.020> for<00:05:43.320> something

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:43.820 
for example we are looking for something

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:48.290 
for example we are looking for something
something<00:05:44.820> special<00:05:45.690> like<00:05:46.820> what<00:05:47.820> is<00:05:47.940> microsoft

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:48.300 
something special like what is microsoft

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:54.440 
something special like what is microsoft
and<00:05:48.960> i<00:05:49.110> will<00:05:49.290> just<00:05:49.920> show<00:05:50.490> that<00:05:50.520> to<00:05:50.970> you<00:05:53.270> what<00:05:54.270> is

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:54.450 
and i will just show that to you what is

00:05:54.450 --> 00:06:00.770 
and i will just show that to you what is
microsoft

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:00.780 

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:09.830 

now<00:06:01.500> let's<00:06:01.800> wait<00:06:02.040> I<00:06:05.960> think<00:06:08.180> it<00:06:09.180> takes<00:06:09.389> a<00:06:09.570> little

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:09.840 
now let's wait I think it takes a little

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:12.050 
now let's wait I think it takes a little
bit<00:06:09.990> of<00:06:10.050> time<00:06:10.410> because<00:06:10.710> it's<00:06:11.520> always<00:06:11.760> going<00:06:11.940> to

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:12.060 
bit of time because it's always going to

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:15.860 
bit of time because it's always going to
the<00:06:12.240> Internet<00:06:12.600> Maurice<00:06:13.970> okay<00:06:14.970> it's<00:06:15.360> often

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:15.870 
the Internet Maurice okay it's often

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:19.000 
the Internet Maurice okay it's often
failing<00:06:16.169> I<00:06:16.590> think<00:06:16.889> it's<00:06:17.070> because<00:06:17.280> I<00:06:17.850> have<00:06:18.450> the

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:19.010 
failing I think it's because I have the

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:22.790 
failing I think it's because I have the
german<00:06:20.010> version<00:06:20.040> and<00:06:21.290> you<00:06:22.290> have<00:06:22.440> to<00:06:22.590> talk

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:22.800 
german version and you have to talk

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:26.090 
german version and you have to talk
German<00:06:23.669> not<00:06:24.030> English<00:06:24.630> okay<00:06:24.960> maybe<00:06:25.650> that's<00:06:25.860> the

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:26.100 
German not English okay maybe that's the

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:29.120 
German not English okay maybe that's the
problem<00:06:26.370> so<00:06:26.639> i<00:06:26.669> will<00:06:26.970> just<00:06:27.169> but<00:06:28.169> okay<00:06:28.860> you<00:06:28.919> know

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:29.130 
problem so i will just but okay you know

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:33.080 
problem so i will just but okay you know
what<00:06:29.450> what<00:06:30.450> it<00:06:30.570> does<00:06:30.720> and<00:06:31.280> that's<00:06:32.280> actually<00:06:32.490> it

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:33.090 
what what it does and that's actually it

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:35.300 
what what it does and that's actually it
i<00:06:33.120> think
