00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:42.300 
ideas about sound and you can't you

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.990 
ideas about sound and you can't you
can't<00:01:42.540> really<00:01:42.810> say<00:01:43.190> this<00:01:44.190> one<00:01:44.460> is<00:01:44.490> better<00:01:44.700> or

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
can't really say this one is better or

that one is better they're all different
and<00:01:46.770> I<00:01:47.250> think<00:01:47.510> what<00:01:48.510> time<00:01:48.810> warp<00:01:49.050> is<00:01:49.170> shown<00:01:49.410> over

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:49.440 
and I think what time warp is shown over

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.900 
and I think what time warp is shown over
the<00:01:49.740> last<00:01:50.180> 10<00:01:51.180> 20<00:01:51.540> years<00:01:51.660> is<00:01:52.170> that<00:01:53.009> they<00:01:53.640> have<00:01:53.880> a

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:53.910 
the last 10 20 years is that they have a

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:58.160 
the last 10 20 years is that they have a
very<00:01:54.300> special<00:01:55.040> idea<00:01:56.040> about<00:01:56.640> what<00:01:57.330> a<00:01:57.360> big<00:01:57.750> party

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170
