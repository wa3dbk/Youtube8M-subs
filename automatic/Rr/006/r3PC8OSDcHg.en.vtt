00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
going to put out a time frame I think

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.560 
going to put out a time frame I think

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
tighter and tighter almost to the point

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.510 
tighter and tighter almost to the point
of<00:01:09.180> snapping<00:01:09.360> so<00:01:09.979> it's<00:01:10.979> not<00:01:11.100> gonna<00:01:11.220> be<00:01:11.340> long

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
of snapping so it's not gonna be long

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.480 
of snapping so it's not gonna be long
but<00:01:12.290> you<00:01:13.290> know<00:01:13.439> you<00:01:13.950> can<00:01:14.070> just<00:01:14.100> feel<00:01:14.340> the

they're<00:01:21.299> stepping<00:01:21.540> up<00:01:21.840> their<00:01:21.990> time<00:01:22.320> their

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
they're stepping up their time their

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.859 
they're stepping up their time their
time<00:01:23.189> frame<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:23.729> do<00:01:24.060> you<00:01:24.119> guys<00:01:24.270> think<00:01:24.600> it's

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
time frame and do you guys think it's

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.499 
time frame and do you guys think it's
