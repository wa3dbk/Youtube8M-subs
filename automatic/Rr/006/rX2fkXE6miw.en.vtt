00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.260
 and 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.129
 do a little tutorial today 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:17.539
 long time I had not done well 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:19.640
 here I have to change the rockwool 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:21.230
 that in my muffler where I 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.720
 will control all that we will dismount 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:28.300
 all this I'll show you how I 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:30.970
 so proceed there it's about 250 ke you the 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:33.820
 original exhaust line 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:37.629
 so for those who have never done 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:40.610
 you will need 12 years reduced it 

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:45.680
 so the oil you will do almost 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:49.100
 all with a key 10 you need a 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:52.449
 tears spring at tyr spring often 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.449
 we have a son of iron, I will show you 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:58.160
 you're going to need rock wool 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.920
 here 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.519
 knowledge of cold are born in more 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.519
 on these ever 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:13.170
 you'll have to river for 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:15.630
 put it all back in him so the 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.870
 happens happen a drill and for those 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.760
 who have never doubted you will see that 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:21.660
 on the original plane on the line 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.590
 original 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:27.240
 everything is soldered at 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.760
 inside the shot will have to take a 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:35.250
 otherwise it is not possible to 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:36.960
 remove the solder points what good 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.260
 so we will start by dismantling the 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:47.600
 refit site there a key to with a 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:47.600
 cli of eight here and there so it's gone 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.940
 and then if if 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:01.119
 1 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.119
 but this 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.350
 we are all ages side 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.410
 we do not serve it 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:26.720
 it allows us to access this disk 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.720
 is here more simply and this one 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:32.670
 we put all his side tac so to you 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.590
 have a life of the last eight of which 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:38.790
 I have a nut of 10 but I am patient 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:45.080
 you all alas have the test of 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:45.080
 folder so we will start 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:53.270
 by veronique cayla i bring you closer 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:57.160
 so their fate that here 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:57.160
 so if you know this tool there 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:04.050
 who is going great 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.050
 you take with the little hook 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:10.610
 you pull it off it takes off all these 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:14.390
 we had not said if gold 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:16.560
 you take a wire you pass it 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:22.270
 in the hook 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:25.230
 like this take a screwdriver you 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:25.230
 wind up your iron wire 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.830
 screwdriver tower like that 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.170
 Alas 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:38.370
 in fact the same you shoot and 500 meters 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:39.740
 all alone so then small springs 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.870
 but that aside 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:44.580
 so it just works for everyone 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.320
 the springs spring out of pau in half 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.330
 time all that could do that if you 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.230
 do not have the tool but the useful when 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.300
 very practical 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:54.530
 so here we have a key of 1 is produced 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.530
 we will start with that 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:59.890
 here 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.060
 here is the 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.670
 you have two small parts you 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:16.850
 can leave them normally it's good 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:19.780
 just do something to turn not the screw 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:19.780
 we put aside 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:32.750
 after we will be able to attack with that 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:32.750
 what is water 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:39.030
 so after this one 

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:42.140
 well here are the costs to block 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:42.140
 behind clues 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:46.389
 buck 

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:12.080
 then we unscrew a puck in the fridge 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:15.370
 for the rest a nut 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.370
 we have long but that aside 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:23.240
 in support the city must come alone 

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:26.720
 there he falls 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:33.490
 we take it out of its location here in 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:35.280
 gently pulling 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:39.290
 bim tag 

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:42.740
 and here you have your skin type neither 

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:42.740
 with the river 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:49.710
 twenty eight have all we'll skip this 

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:51.849
 short film after and so we go 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:54.209
 take care of this part 

00:05:51.849 --> 00:05:54.209
 agde
