00:00:04.649 --> 00:00:09.040
 hello my dear 1 I will always 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.350
 asked again and that is always possible 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.990
 how much about the calorie balance again 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:15.490
 May I eat what consumers and there 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:17.619
 I wanted to make a video today 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:20.679
 by first explaining what is there 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:23.589
 the entertainment sales 

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:26.289
 That's what you need with it 

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:28.539
 simply living in the lying does not move you 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:30.759
 Just breathe on your hair to grow 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:33.460
 your fingernails grow so the body 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:35.160
 he lives and he keeps himself that one can completely 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:39.370
 calculate very easily and that 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:44.020
 bodyweight times 20 let's go from 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:46.510
 60 kilos out of that 20 times are 1200 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.990
 calories as my body needs to 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.570
 Life 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:51.730
 But now we are here 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.440
 was now working or working at the office 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.020
 under construction right here at the houses 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.310
 Therefore, it makes as much or crashing 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.840
 we do a lot of sport that comes 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:01.870
 of course, that's it too 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:04.000
 our basic turnover thus remains simple 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:07.359
 Let's just go with the factor of 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.420
 0 5 that will be with a woman of 60 

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:12.369
 kilograms to 600 kilocalories 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.499
 you can figure that out for yourself 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:16.149
 if it just wanted to make you easy 

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:17.140
 also in the internet or you can yours 

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:18.850
 enter data 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.820
 there are so calculator the calculations then 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.250
 out 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.380
 the basic turnover is mine 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.330
 experience it is so that it mostly 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.050
 that means people are too high 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.970
 wanting to lose weight 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:32.720
 Come to me and tell me he is expecting 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:34.670
 Should be 2600 or 2800 calories 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.800
 then eat so crowe then 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.660
 either go after that and maybe 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.170
 something is reduced or it is calculated 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:44.150
 for you if you then for yours 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:46.070
 your calorie balance then tried 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:48.259
 the first because his body is totally 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:51.259
 it tried a different week 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:53.630
 with your calories how long have you been 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:55.340
 calculated for you 1800 and looks 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.770
 how to weight one after another 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.860
 week is when he has approached 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:03.229
 then you know exactly i would have to 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.960
 eat less so I go to 1700 times 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:07.640
 if you notice with klaus 700 that exactly 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.420
 or at 2,000 I want to get there now 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.580
 not set 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.470
 That's exactly the calorie balance right now 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.560
 where I hold my weight then closes 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.209
 that would be quite individual or whole 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.670
 individually consumed that you need 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:22.340
 all this can be experienced in the body 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.900
 it works that the hair grows as 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.790
 that we laugh that the teeth 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.980
 the eyes radiate 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.950
 and if you want to lose weight then 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.930
 Just reduce it from this number 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.610
 that means we too okay I want 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.180
 do not eat much less then 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.410
 every day reduces 200 kilocalories 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.390
 but do something else I move 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.860
 every day so i every day again 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:47.000
 Consume 300 calories 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:50.480
 then you have 500 kilocalories per day - 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.540
 if you calculate that 500 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.599
 calorie 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.340
 eat less each day or 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:58.170
 consume more 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.349
 of course he has there if he eventually 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.340
 makes seven to eight thousand kilocalories 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:05.549
 saved 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.590
 a kilo of fat expired so and so 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:09.720
 is the question answered how much 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.170
 calorie may i should i have to 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.269
 eat 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.099
 if that's still not enough for you 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:18.900
 have then just sign up 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:20.909
 silke effectively to punkt.de and I will 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:24.889
 there you go again writing to 

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:24.889
