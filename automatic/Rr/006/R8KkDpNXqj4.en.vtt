ideal<00:02:28.950> for<00:02:28.980> what<00:02:29.250> we<00:02:29.370> want<00:02:30.830> like<00:02:31.830> that

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:55.750

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.240 

so

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.700 

snip<00:03:00.250> the<00:03:00.370> bag<00:03:00.870> try<00:03:01.870> not<00:03:02.080> puncture<00:03:02.650> any

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:02.710 
snip the bag try not puncture any

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:04.740 
snip the bag try not puncture any
maggots<00:03:03.100> in<00:03:03.220> the<00:03:03.280> bag<00:03:03.490> because<00:03:04.480> that<00:03:04.630> makes

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
maggots in the bag because that makes

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.290 
maggots in the bag because that makes
the<00:03:04.870> pv<00:03:05.080> obviously<00:03:05.680> dissolve<00:03:06.070> that<00:03:06.940> be<00:03:07.120> ready

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.300 
the pv obviously dissolve that be ready

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.470 
the pv obviously dissolve that be ready
for<00:03:07.450> casting<00:03:07.600> I<00:03:08.460> think<00:03:09.460> if<00:03:09.580> you<00:03:09.910> don't<00:03:10.120> eat<00:03:10.240> ER

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
for casting I think if you don't eat ER

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.210 
for casting I think if you don't eat ER
and<00:03:10.720> you<00:03:10.780> don't<00:03:11.020> or<00:03:11.230> give<00:03:11.500> it<00:03:11.620> sort<00:03:11.830> of<00:03:11.950> a<00:03:12.040> good

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
and you don't or give it sort of a good

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.520 
and you don't or give it sort of a good
cast<00:03:12.490> right<00:03:12.730> away<00:03:12.970> it<00:03:13.570> tends<00:03:13.810> to<00:03:13.900> die<00:03:14.140> and<00:03:14.410> then

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
cast right away it tends to die and then

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:15.690 
cast right away it tends to die and then
you<00:03:14.560> just<00:03:14.830> wasting<00:03:15.190> maggots<00:03:15.520> and<00:03:15.580> you're

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
you just wasting maggots and you're

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:16.620 
you just wasting maggots and you're
getting<00:03:15.820> them<00:03:15.940> where<00:03:16.060> you're<00:03:16.120> damn<00:03:16.300> on<00:03:16.480> them

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
getting them where you're damn on them

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.080 
getting them where you're damn on them
so<00:03:16.840> literally<00:03:17.770> I'll<00:03:18.160> just<00:03:18.340> let<00:03:18.550> the<00:03:18.610> clip<00:03:18.880> make

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
so literally I'll just let the clip make

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:20.340 
so literally I'll just let the clip make
sure<00:03:19.240> that<00:03:19.420> I<00:03:19.510> eat<00:03:19.690> it<00:03:19.840> as<00:03:19.930> hard<00:03:20.080> as<00:03:20.230> I<00:03:20.290> can

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
sure that I eat it as hard as I can

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:21.930 
sure that I eat it as hard as I can
favor<00:03:20.890> it<00:03:21.040> down<00:03:21.160> just<00:03:21.310> before<00:03:21.640> he<00:03:21.730> eats<00:03:21.790> the

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
favor it down just before he eats the

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.730 
favor it down just before he eats the
clip<00:03:22.150> make<00:03:22.780> sure<00:03:22.930> he<00:03:23.020> eats<00:03:23.080> the<00:03:23.290> clip<00:03:23.440> every

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:23.740 
clip make sure he eats the clip every

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:25.680 
clip make sure he eats the clip every
