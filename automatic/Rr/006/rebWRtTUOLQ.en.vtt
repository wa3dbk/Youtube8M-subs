00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
people not being able to SSH I like I

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.050 
people not being able to SSH I like I
mean<00:01:49.560> other<00:01:49.920> than<00:01:50.040> that<00:01:50.250> I<00:01:50.280> can't<00:01:50.759> think<00:01:51.000> of

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
mean other than that I can't think of

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.569 
mean other than that I can't think of
anything<00:01:51.299> that's<00:01:51.659> like<00:01:52.070> difficult<00:01:53.070> about<00:01:53.460> it

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
anything that's like difficult about it

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.289 
anything that's like difficult about it
um<00:01:54.409> once<00:01:55.409> you<00:01:55.560> do<00:01:55.710> that<00:01:55.820> you're<00:01:56.820> going<00:01:57.000> to<00:01:57.090> want

um once you do that you're going to want
to<00:01:57.420> open<00:01:58.909> an<00:01:59.909> SS<00:02:00.390> agent<00:02:00.630> program<00:02:00.840> I<00:02:01.850> recommend

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
to open an SS agent program I recommend

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.429 
to open an SS agent program I recommend
for<00:02:03.570> this<00:02:03.719> you're<00:02:03.960> going<00:02:03.990> to<00:02:04.110> want<00:02:04.290> to<00:02:04.320> use

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
for this you're going to want to use

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.869 
for this you're going to want to use
winscp<00:02:04.860> if<00:02:05.759> you<00:02:05.880> can<00:02:06.619> just<00:02:07.619> because<00:02:08.009> you<00:02:08.759> got

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
winscp if you can just because you got

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.279 
winscp if you can just because you got
to<00:02:08.970> change<00:02:09.179> permissions<00:02:09.450> and<00:02:09.810> it's<00:02:09.959> really

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
to change permissions and it's really

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.160 
to change permissions and it's really
easy<00:02:10.410> to<00:02:10.739> do<00:02:10.860> with<00:02:10.979> that

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
easy to do with that

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.570 
easy to do with that
program<00:02:11.590> so<00:02:12.430> I'm<00:02:12.670> gonna<00:02:14.280> first<00:02:15.280> what<00:02:15.489> I'm

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
program so I'm gonna first what I'm
