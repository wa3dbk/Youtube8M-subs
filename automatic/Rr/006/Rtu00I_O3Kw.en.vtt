then over the next year put it together
so<00:00:21.990> let's<00:00:22.140> see<00:00:22.320> what<00:00:22.350> we<00:00:22.619> got<00:00:22.800> here

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:51.950 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:57.280 

got<00:00:52.520> the<00:00:52.640> plastic<00:00:52.850> wrapping<00:00:53.360> off<00:00:55.960> so<00:00:56.960> this<00:00:57.140> is

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:57.290 
got the plastic wrapping off so this is

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:58.630 
got the plastic wrapping off so this is
what's<00:00:57.500> going<00:00:57.680> to<00:00:57.740> keep<00:00:57.890> me<00:00:58.070> busy<00:00:58.190> for<00:00:58.400> the

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
what's going to keep me busy for the

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.080 
what's going to keep me busy for the
next<00:00:58.670> year<00:00:59.300> or<00:00:59.330> so<00:00:59.510> I<00:00:59.780> imagine<00:01:00.700> the<00:01:01.700> radius

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:02.090 
next year or so I imagine the radius

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.750 
next year or so I imagine the radius
that<00:01:02.210> had<00:01:02.360> a<00:01:02.390> steel<00:01:02.810> level<00:01:03.140> two<00:01:03.470> we<00:01:04.280> just<00:01:04.550> tend

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:04.760 
that had a steel level two we just tend

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.220 
that had a steel level two we just tend
to<00:01:04.850> adult<00:01:05.150> but<00:01:05.390> I<00:01:05.420> think<00:01:05.660> it'll<00:01:05.810> be<00:01:05.870> the<00:01:06.080> most

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:06.230 
to adult but I think it'll be the most

to adult but I think it'll be the most
difficult<00:01:06.680> model<00:01:07.370> I<00:01:07.520> know<00:01:07.610> it'll<00:01:07.850> be<00:01:07.970> the<00:01:08.090> most

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210
