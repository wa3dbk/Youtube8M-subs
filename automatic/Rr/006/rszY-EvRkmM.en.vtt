and<00:02:21.720> I've<00:02:21.840> been<00:02:21.959> cracking<00:02:22.620> in<00:02:22.709> there<00:02:22.890> for<00:02:23.069> eggs

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
and I've been cracking in there for eggs

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.940 
and I've been cracking in there for eggs
and<00:02:23.550> if<00:02:23.730> you<00:02:23.849> see<00:02:24.060> it<00:02:24.180> this<00:02:24.300> the<00:02:25.140> second<00:02:25.560> egg<00:02:25.709> it

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
and if you see it this the second egg it

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.740 
and if you see it this the second egg it
might<00:02:26.130> be<00:02:26.280> a<00:02:26.310> little<00:02:26.610> bit<00:02:26.819> something<00:02:27.540> that<00:02:27.660> you

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
might be a little bit something that you

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.180 
might be a little bit something that you
don't<00:02:27.959> like<00:02:28.170> but<00:02:28.380> if<00:02:28.590> you<00:02:28.739> just<00:02:28.890> keep<00:02:29.099> them

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
don't like but if you just keep them

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.650 
don't like but if you just keep them
whipping<00:02:29.550> it<00:02:29.670> with<00:02:29.790> the<00:02:29.910> other<00:02:30.060> edge<00:02:30.239> it<00:02:30.510> would

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
whipping it with the other edge it would

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.830 
whipping it with the other edge it would
turn<00:02:31.140> out<00:02:31.349> to<00:02:31.400> coups<00:02:32.400> so<00:02:33.390> now<00:02:33.540> what<00:02:33.720> we're

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
turn out to coups so now what we're

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:40.750 
turn out to coups so now what we're
