00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:12.770 
this is an online-based Giza GI za so
all<00:00:10.019> I<00:00:10.139> had<00:00:10.260> to<00:00:10.320> do<00:00:10.469> was<00:00:10.650> google<00:00:11.780> Hulk's

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
all I had to do was google Hulk's

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.209 
all I had to do was google Hulk's
channel<00:00:13.170> I<00:00:13.290> think<00:00:13.500> he's<00:00:13.620> got<00:00:13.740> about<00:00:13.920> four<00:00:14.190> or

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
channel I think he's got about four or

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:15.829 
channel I think he's got about four or
five<00:00:14.309> videos<00:00:14.759> on<00:00:14.940> how<00:00:15.030> to<00:00:15.059> beat<00:00:15.299> this<00:00:15.480> and

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
five videos on how to beat this and

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.050 
five videos on how to beat this and
basically<00:00:16.740> just<00:00:17.039> copied<00:00:17.400> what<00:00:17.550> he<00:00:17.640> was<00:00:17.760> doing

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
basically just copied what he was doing

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.650 
basically just copied what he was doing
because<00:00:18.180> it<00:00:18.420> works<00:00:18.600> so<00:00:18.779> well<00:00:18.810> so<00:00:20.000> the<00:00:21.000> base<00:00:21.330> the

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
because it works so well so the base the

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.340 
because it works so well so the base the
way<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:21.930> space<00:00:22.170> is<00:00:22.380> laid<00:00:22.619> out<00:00:24.199> you've<00:00:25.199> got

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
way the space is laid out you've got

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.519 
way the space is laid out you've got
double<00:00:25.650> giant<00:00:25.859> bombs<00:00:26.210> here<00:00:27.210> and<00:00:27.890> here<00:00:28.890> and

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:30.529 
double giant bombs here and here and

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:33.260 
double giant bombs here and here and
then<00:00:31.529> you've<00:00:31.679> got<00:00:31.830> your<00:00:31.859> Tesla's<00:00:32.579> in<00:00:33.120> your

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
then you've got your Tesla's in your

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.299 
then you've got your Tesla's in your
core<00:00:33.570> I<00:00:33.989> think<00:00:34.230> they're<00:00:34.410> here<00:00:34.710> and<00:00:34.860> here<00:00:35.280> and

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
core I think they're here and here and

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.389 
core I think they're here and here and
here<00:00:35.760> and<00:00:36.210> here<00:00:36.360> something<00:00:36.870> like<00:00:36.960> that

00:00:37.389 --> 00:00:37.399 
here and here something like that

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:39.260 
here and here something like that
doesn't<00:00:38.399> really<00:00:38.550> matter<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:38.879> double<00:00:39.090> giant

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
doesn't really matter the double giant

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.600 
doesn't really matter the double giant
bombs<00:00:39.360> all<00:00:39.690> you<00:00:39.780> have<00:00:39.870> to<00:00:39.960> worry<00:00:39.989> about<00:00:40.260> so<00:00:40.710> the

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
bombs all you have to worry about so the

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.190 
bombs all you have to worry about so the
way<00:00:41.760> you<00:00:41.790> deal<00:00:42.180> with<00:00:42.329> those<00:00:42.570> is<00:00:42.809> you<00:00:42.930> have<00:00:43.079> to

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
way you deal with those is you have to

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.490 
way you deal with those is you have to
take<00:00:43.410> out<00:00:43.850> you<00:00:44.850> know<00:00:44.969> this<00:00:45.120> entire<00:00:45.539> ring<00:00:46.200> of

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
take out you know this entire ring of

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.040 
take out you know this entire ring of
Defense's<00:00:47.370> at<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.579> top<00:00:47.789> and<00:00:48.030> then<00:00:48.809> what

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
Defense's at the top and then what

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.799 
Defense's at the top and then what
you've<00:00:49.260> done<00:00:49.530> that<00:00:49.829> you<00:00:50.760> can<00:00:50.789> send<00:00:51.239> a<00:00:51.390> single

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
you've done that you can send a single

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.119 
you've done that you can send a single
hog<00:00:52.289> in<00:00:52.649> on<00:00:53.090> this<00:00:54.090> side<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:54.420> this<00:00:54.660> side<00:00:54.840> to<00:00:55.829> pop

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
hog in on this side and this side to pop

hog in on this side and this side to pop
the<00:00:56.640> first<00:00:57.090> of<00:00:57.420> these<00:00:57.539> two<00:00:57.840> double<00:00:58.140> giant

what's<00:01:16.140> in<00:01:16.320> between<00:01:16.470> these<00:01:16.830> two<00:01:17.009> defenses<00:01:17.640> and

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
what's in between these two defenses and

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.609 
what's in between these two defenses and
then<00:01:17.880> kind<00:01:18.000> of<00:01:18.150> draw<00:01:18.330> straight<00:01:18.630> out<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:19.049> you

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
then kind of draw straight out and you

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.039 
then kind of draw straight out and you
know<00:01:19.740> so<00:01:19.920> I<00:01:19.950> you<00:01:20.460> know<00:01:20.490> if<00:01:20.759> you<00:01:20.909> let's<00:01:21.750> see<00:01:21.900> here

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
know so I you know if you let's see here

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.520 
know so I you know if you let's see here
redraw<00:01:22.409> that<00:01:22.439> so<00:01:23.450> you<00:01:24.450> know<00:01:24.570> if<00:01:24.900> this<00:01:25.200> is<00:01:25.380> in

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
redraw that so you know if this is in

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.410 
redraw that so you know if this is in
between<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:26.009> two<00:01:26.189> I<00:01:26.220> kind<00:01:26.640> of<00:01:26.759> wanted<00:01:27.060> to<00:01:27.180> drop

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
between the two I kind of wanted to drop

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.749 
between the two I kind of wanted to drop
it<00:01:27.720> right<00:01:28.259> there<00:01:28.530> so<00:01:29.189> that<00:01:29.220> what's<00:01:29.579> going<00:01:29.700> to

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
it right there so that what's going to

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.789 
it right there so that what's going to
happen<00:01:30.090> is<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.299> Hogs<00:01:30.509> going<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:30.840> path<00:01:31.140> in<00:01:31.530> and

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
happen is the Hogs going to path in and

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.249 
happen is the Hogs going to path in and
it<00:01:32.700> will<00:01:32.909> end<00:01:32.939> up<00:01:33.180> choosing<00:01:33.450> one<00:01:33.869> of<00:01:33.990> these<00:01:34.079> two

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
it will end up choosing one of these two

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.870 
it will end up choosing one of these two
defenses<00:01:34.770> but<00:01:34.890> it'll<00:01:35.040> be<00:01:35.130> on<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.280> corner<00:01:35.729> and

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
defenses but it'll be on the corner and

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.249 
defenses but it'll be on the corner and
it'll<00:01:36.090> be<00:01:36.180> just<00:01:36.360> enough<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.750> pop<00:01:36.930> on<00:01:37.110> those

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
it'll be just enough to pop on those

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.940 
it'll be just enough to pop on those
giant<00:01:37.530> bomb<00:01:37.650> so<00:01:38.040> you<00:01:39.000> know<00:01:39.090> that's<00:01:39.210> kind<00:01:39.509> of

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
giant bomb so you know that's kind of

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.999

air defense or it's right on the corner

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.240 
air defense or it's right on the corner
of<00:02:03.060> it<00:02:03.439> followed<00:02:04.439> by<00:02:04.790> three<00:02:05.790> balloons<00:02:06.119> here

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
of it followed by three balloons here

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.449 
of it followed by three balloons here
followed<00:02:08.250> by<00:02:08.429> two<00:02:08.970> balloons<00:02:09.300> here<00:02:10.220> then<00:02:11.220> we<00:02:11.340> go

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
followed by two balloons here then we go

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.220 
followed by two balloons here then we go
over<00:02:11.489> to<00:02:11.640> this<00:02:11.760> side<00:02:12.000> and<00:02:12.209> we<00:02:12.270> do

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
over to this side and we do

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:24.080 
over to this side and we do
2<00:02:17.239> 321<00:02:19.250> so<00:02:20.250> that's<00:02:20.430> 2<00:02:20.700> 3<00:02:21.120> 4<00:02:21.420> 5<00:02:21.690> 6<00:02:21.720> 7<00:02:22.260> 8<00:02:22.650> 9<00:02:22.680> 10<00:02:22.950> 11<00:02:23.400> 12

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
2 321 so that's 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.990 
2 321 so that's 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12

13 14 15 balloons and that should take

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.979 
13 14 15 balloons and that should take
care<00:02:27.060> of<00:02:27.480> this<00:02:27.659> entire<00:02:28.560> outer<00:02:28.950> ring<00:02:29.840> there<00:02:30.840> was

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:32.900 
care of this entire outer ring there was
definitely<00:02:31.019> a<00:02:31.500> possibility<00:02:32.010> that<00:02:32.610> i<00:02:32.640> would

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
definitely a possibility that i would

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.780 
definitely a possibility that i would
have<00:02:33.000> run<00:02:33.239> into<00:02:33.500> bombs<00:02:34.500> you<00:02:35.129> know<00:02:35.250> mines<00:02:35.489> or

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
something like that it would have messed

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.400 
something like that it would have messed
this<00:02:37.650> up<00:02:37.790> you<00:02:38.790> know<00:02:38.910> getting<00:02:39.660> this<00:02:39.870> outer<00:02:40.110> core

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
this up you know getting this outer core

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.050 
this up you know getting this outer core
taken<00:02:40.709> care<00:02:40.860> of<00:02:40.890> is<00:02:41.069> so<00:02:41.220> important<00:02:41.670> had<00:02:41.849> that
