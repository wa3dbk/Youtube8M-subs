00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:09.730
 hello good morning I'm joan veny de nature 

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:12.890
 pixel and today I want to talk about the canon 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:15.650
 70 of how you know this camera is already 

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:17.570
 the sale and it was already presented makes certain 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.970
 time but now that I could 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:22.220
 try a little with more with more 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.079
 tranquility there are things that have 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.730
 very much liked at the entrance I think that 

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:29.409
 the remarkable feature of this 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:33.050
 camera is the dual pixel that is to say that 

00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:34.690
 possibility of having a continuous focus 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.579
 while we are recording video 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:41.210
 it really works wonders is a 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:44.449
 precise soft focus and that represents 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:48.079
 a big improvement regarding for example the 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:50.059
 ability to generate in this sense the 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:51.980
 approach that I have for example with the 5 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:54.109
 from sea 3 that has absolutely nothing 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:57.710
 what to see and what the focus by movement 

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:59.210
 it is non-existent then here 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.039
 it works very well and especially with 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.410
 optical stm you already know that having this 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:06.620
 Focus motor that makes all the 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:08.630
 process is very smooth very fluid 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:12.020
 and it really is a characteristic that already 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.550
 I would like to have on the 5th of March 3 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.550
 so if you canon in some way 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:19.100
 update sign or some 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:22.430
 way you can take care of your clients 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.380
 I think many of us would appreciate it because 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.540
 it's a very interesting feature in itself 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.340
 the very well-built camera grabs 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.890
 of wonders even better also that 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.050
 the 5 of March 3 have made some change in 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.600
 what is the grip grips very well very 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.020
 well built solid if we look through 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:41.460
 example 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:44.789
 we have even something sealed in the in 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:48.119
 the lid closes perfectly well 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:51.179
 built very useful folding screen 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:53.670
 especially when we are working on 

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:58.110
 video is also touch wifi connection 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:01.729
 with a good application that we have 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:04.200
 for android and for apple 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:06.000
 very fast even some improvements 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.679
 also visually through the 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.560
 viewer in the selection of points of 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:13.290
 approach is to say yes you notice those 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:16.519
 improvements and I believe that 70 d in this 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.519
 Case is an ideal camera 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.730
 in my case it would be idea as a second 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:25.900
 body having about five of three sea 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:27.970
 full format here a sensor to psc ya 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:31.450
 you know that multiplied 1,6 with which of 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:33.610
 70 200 then by 1.6 having a good 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:36.880
 speed a good image quality 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:39.370
 a very powerful focusing system and 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:42.640
 a good construction with which it would be 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:45.060
 an ideal complement to have it together 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.040
 to a function 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.080
 If that's not the case, I think it's a 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.959
 camera and with this objective that is an 18 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.930
 135 is an objective that is not very 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:58.380
 luminous 3556 but has stabilizer 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:01.380
 of image is stm and it is a 28 200 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.840
 equivalent in 35 millimeters 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:06.750
 the ideal camera equipment for traveling 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:09.360
 very versatile multipurpose optics is 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:12.300
 pretty well built is not the 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.880
 goal that stepping papers that in others 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:17.819
 cases almost all the deans we have not 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:20.190
 had it is well built now it is not 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:22.530
 ideal light 2.8 but you can not 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:26.640
 have everything and in itself the camera as os 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:29.310
 I say some very interesting sensations to 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.549
 keep it in mind thank you very much and up 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.549
 the next
