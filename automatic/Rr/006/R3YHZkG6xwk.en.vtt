hey guys running here with another
redstone<00:00:02.340> tutorial<00:00:03.120> sorry<00:00:03.480> if<00:00:03.629> I<00:00:03.780> sound<00:00:04.140> a<00:00:04.259> bit

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.290 
redstone tutorial sorry if I sound a bit

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.019 
redstone tutorial sorry if I sound a bit
weird<00:00:04.440> actually<00:00:04.799> think<00:00:05.190> I<00:00:05.250> sound<00:00:05.430> Clara<00:00:05.759> right

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
weird actually think I sound Clara right

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:07.940 
weird actually think I sound Clara right
now<00:00:06.240> but<00:00:06.569> I<00:00:06.720> probably<00:00:07.049> sound<00:00:07.259> a<00:00:07.410> bit<00:00:07.440> nasally

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
now but I probably sound a bit nasally

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.339 
now but I probably sound a bit nasally
because<00:00:08.160> i'm<00:00:08.280> a<00:00:08.370> bit<00:00:08.550> sick<00:00:09.110> today<00:00:10.110> i<00:00:10.230> will<00:00:10.320> be

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
because i'm a bit sick today i will be

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.140 
because i'm a bit sick today i will be
teaching<00:00:10.559> you<00:00:10.860> how<00:00:11.040> to<00:00:11.099> make<00:00:11.309> an<00:00:11.550> xor<00:00:12.120> gate

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
teaching you how to make an xor gate

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.670 
teaching you how to make an xor gate
this<00:00:12.750> is<00:00:12.990> it<00:00:13.469> basically<00:00:13.910> this<00:00:14.910> is<00:00:15.560> probably<00:00:16.560> a

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
this is it basically this is probably a

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.349 
this is it basically this is probably a
bit<00:00:16.859> more<00:00:16.980> advanced<00:00:17.340> than<00:00:17.490> the<00:00:17.789> basic<00:00:17.970> things

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
bit more advanced than the basic things

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.510 
bit more advanced than the basic things
i've<00:00:18.539> been<00:00:18.690> teaching<00:00:18.840> you<00:00:19.109> what<00:00:19.740> it<00:00:19.890> does<00:00:20.100> is

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
i've been teaching you what it does is

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.349 
i've been teaching you what it does is
if<00:00:20.850> the<00:00:21.449> two<00:00:21.990> locks<00:00:22.410> are<00:00:22.680> opposite<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:24.090> it

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
if the two locks are opposite the it

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.849 
if the two locks are opposite the it
sends<00:00:24.840> power<00:00:25.080> and<00:00:25.439> if<00:00:26.340> they're<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:27.090> same<00:00:27.119> it

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:27.859 
sends power and if they're the same it

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:31.640 
sends power and if they're the same it
is<00:00:28.859> negative<00:00:29.160> power<00:00:29.580> so<00:00:30.380> even<00:00:31.380> if<00:00:31.470> they're

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
is negative power so even if they're

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.810 
is negative power so even if they're
both<00:00:31.800> up<00:00:32.130> it's<00:00:32.550> still<00:00:33.059> negative<00:00:33.390> power<00:00:33.780> and<00:00:34.820> no

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
both up it's still negative power and no

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.440 
both up it's still negative power and no
matter<00:00:36.000> how<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.300> opposite<00:00:36.960> it<00:00:37.469> sends<00:00:38.070> power

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:38.450 
matter how the opposite it sends power

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:42.110 
matter how the opposite it sends power
but<00:00:39.770> to<00:00:40.770> make<00:00:40.950> these<00:00:41.129> all<00:00:41.430> you<00:00:41.550> really<00:00:41.700> do<00:00:41.940> is

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
but to make these all you really do is

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:48.049 
but to make these all you really do is
you<00:00:43.110> get<00:00:43.290> three<00:00:45.020> put<00:00:46.020> one<00:00:46.260> on<00:00:46.500> top<00:00:46.800> then<00:00:47.789> you

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
you get three put one on top then you

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.560 
you get three put one on top then you
put<00:00:48.329> a<00:00:48.360> switch<00:00:48.750> these<00:00:49.410> your<00:00:49.680> switches<00:00:50.570> put

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
put a switch these your switches put

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.910 
put a switch these your switches put
torches<00:00:52.110> above<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.770> switches<00:00:53.100> like<00:00:53.489> that<00:00:53.730> one

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
torches above the switches like that one

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.979 
torches above the switches like that one
the<00:00:55.920> torch<00:00:56.219> their<00:00:56.730> torch<00:00:57.360> there<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:57.750> watch

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
the torch their torch there and watch

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.869 
the torch their torch there and watch
their<00:00:59.690> you<00:01:00.690> leave<00:01:01.140> one<00:01:01.379> space<00:01:01.710> oh<00:01:02.100> it's<00:01:02.640> going

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
their you leave one space oh it's going

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.789 
their you leave one space oh it's going
night<00:01:03.180> but<00:01:03.480> so<00:01:03.719> I<00:01:03.750> should<00:01:04.320> still<00:01:04.500> have<00:01:04.619> enough

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
night but so I should still have enough

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.820 
night but so I should still have enough
time<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.309> put<00:01:05.970> two<00:01:06.090> blocks<00:01:06.330> there<00:01:06.830> now

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
time and put two blocks there now

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.010 
time and put two blocks there now
connect<00:01:08.280> redstone<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:09.290> all<00:01:10.290> but<00:01:10.860> basically

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
connect redstone to all but basically

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.660 
connect redstone to all but basically
put<00:01:13.020> back<00:01:13.320> crap<00:01:13.710> not<00:01:13.920> there<00:01:14.100> you<00:01:14.310> meant<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:14.549> put

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
put back crap not there you meant to put

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.230 
put back crap not there you meant to put
a<00:01:14.700> redstone<00:01:14.970> torch<00:01:15.180> there<00:01:15.689> on<00:01:15.900> these<00:01:17.240> red

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
a redstone torch there on these red

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.830 
a redstone torch there on these red
stone<00:01:18.540> on<00:01:18.720> top<00:01:19.610> and<00:01:22.820> what<00:01:23.820> else<00:01:23.970> sweetie<00:01:24.390> put

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
stone on top and what else sweetie put

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.499 
stone on top and what else sweetie put
redstone<00:01:25.049> there<00:01:25.610> that<00:01:26.610> really<00:01:26.939> should<00:01:27.299> be<00:01:27.330> it

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
redstone there that really should be it

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.810 
redstone there that really should be it
now<00:01:28.229> coming<00:01:28.770> from<00:01:28.920> in<00:01:29.070> between<00:01:29.100> these<00:01:29.520> two

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
now coming from in between these two

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.990 
now coming from in between these two
parts<00:01:30.150> you<00:01:30.390> put<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.990> wire<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:31.829> you<00:01:32.759> put<00:01:32.970> a

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
parts you put the wire and you put a

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.600 
parts you put the wire and you put a
door<00:01:33.360> or<00:01:33.750> what<00:01:34.290> else<00:01:34.470> uses<00:01:34.920> power<00:01:35.159> really<00:01:35.369> just

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
door or what else uses power really just

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.910 
door or what else uses power really just
doors<00:01:35.850> basically<00:01:36.450> now<00:01:37.140> when<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.409> opposite

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
doors basically now when the opposite

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.030 
doors basically now when the opposite
see<00:01:38.490> how<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.670> light<00:01:38.790> so<00:01:39.150> opposite<00:01:39.540> will<00:01:40.530> post

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
see how the light so opposite will post

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.999 
see how the light so opposite will post
not<00:01:41.310> on<00:01:41.930> it<00:01:42.930> doesn't<00:01:43.290> send<00:01:43.439> power<00:01:43.649> and<00:01:43.950> they

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
not on it doesn't send power and they

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.219 
not on it doesn't send power and they
both<00:01:44.189> off<00:01:44.399> it<00:01:44.700> sends<00:01:45.060> power<00:01:45.270> still<00:01:45.750> it<00:01:45.990> doesn't

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
both off it sends power still it doesn't

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.719 
both off it sends power still it doesn't
send<00:01:46.500> power<00:01:46.680> when<00:01:46.860> they're<00:01:46.979> both<00:01:47.100> on<00:01:47.130> it<00:01:47.490> still

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
send power when they're both on it still

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.999 
send power when they're both on it still
doesn't<00:01:48.060> send<00:01:48.270> power<00:01:48.450> but<00:01:49.350> when<00:01:49.500> one's<00:01:49.770> off

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
doesn't send power but when one's off

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.230 
doesn't send power but when one's off
and<00:01:50.220> ones<00:01:50.399> on<00:01:50.610> it<00:01:50.899> sends<00:01:51.899> power<00:01:52.610> this<00:01:53.610> is<00:01:53.820> I

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
and ones on it sends power this is I

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.660 
and ones on it sends power this is I
don't<00:01:54.840> know<00:01:54.960> I<00:01:55.049> never<00:01:55.470> really<00:01:55.890> used<00:01:56.100> these<00:01:56.340> so

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
don't know I never really used these so

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.069 
don't know I never really used these so
that's<00:01:57.030> why<00:01:57.149> I<00:01:57.210> haven't<00:01:57.360> really<00:01:57.750> made<00:01:58.020> a

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
that's why I haven't really made a

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.100 
that's why I haven't really made a
tutorial<00:01:58.380> until<00:01:58.979> I<00:01:59.009> figured<00:01:59.490> out<00:01:59.579> make<00:01:59.790> one

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
tutorial until I figured out make one

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:04.399 
tutorial until I figured out make one
alright<00:02:01.110> so<00:02:01.320> thanks<00:02:01.740> for<00:02:01.799> watching<00:02:02.070> bye
