we'll<00:01:25.149> have<00:01:25.299> to<00:01:25.509> watch<00:01:25.659> that<00:01:25.719> today<00:01:26.469> and<00:01:26.799> just

00:01:27.419 --> 00:01:27.429 
we'll have to watch that today and just

before I hit the process button on this
video<00:01:29.469> I<00:01:29.859> checked<00:01:30.249> the<00:01:30.399> flaring<00:01:30.700> one<00:01:30.850> more

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:57.159 
see here in the solar wind we are very

00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:59.580 
see here in the solar wind we are very
calm<00:01:57.520> so<00:01:57.759> any<00:01:57.999> see<00:01:58.389> any<00:01:58.719> impacts<00:01:59.319> will<00:01:59.469> be

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
calm so any see any impacts will be

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.090 
calm so any see any impacts will be
easily<00:01:59.889> spotted<00:02:00.490> in<00:02:00.969> the<00:02:01.060> data<00:02:01.889> coronal<00:02:02.889> holes

at much lower power than some previous

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.059 
at much lower power than some previous
