00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:07.130
 hello very good everyone I'm s 36 and 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.780
 welcome to this new tutorial in the 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:10.850
 which I want to show what programs you can 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:13.340
 uninstall and what programs you can not 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:15.260
 uninstall many times when our 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:17.869
 computer goes slow we have then that 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.310
 feeling that we have to uninstall 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:22.399
 programs to go a little more 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:24.770
 fluid is to say the more we occupy 

00:00:22.399 --> 00:00:27.439
 our hard drive with programs then 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.669
 obviously it will go slower for that 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:30.800
 many times, as I said 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:32.720
 before we have to uninstall different 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.719
 different applications programs for 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:37.219
 go get more fluid 

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:39.949
 problem comes when we 

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:41.750
 we install the software or programs or 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:44.030
 applications that are essential 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.859
 for our for our use in the 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.929
 computer such as drivers 

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:50.120
 how can they be microsoft packages 

00:00:47.929 --> 00:00:52.039
 how can they be controllers of the 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.100
 video card sound card 

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:58.850
 of good then of controllers of 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:00.230
 keyboard and mouse all that are parts 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.319
 very important are very software 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:05.960
 important from our computer and that 

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:07.610
 we have to have them then we must go 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.780
 carefully when we install them 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.000
 different 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.770
 in our pc 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.630
 for this I have brought you today a 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.250
 application that is going to tell us that is going 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.860
 to say and applications we can 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:21.229
 uninstall and what applications do not 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:24.020
 we must uninstall this application it 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:26.210
 flame sun air mode and it's totally 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.590
 free as always will be in the 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.720
 description of the video and how I have 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.400
 commented then he will tell us what 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.920
 applications are dispensable and what 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.110
 the applications are essential 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.369
 official page as I said in the 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:41.270
 description of the video is this that 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:43.550
 have here is worth it and here what 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:46.070
 we have to do it because it will simply be 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:49.399
 click on this little button here or 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:51.860
 in this here it is worth automatically 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:54.110
 download what is the software and we 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.030
 going to let's let's minimize this by 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.820
 here to make it better is not going to stop 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.500
 this installation setup installation 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.330
 it's very simple I'm not going to teach it 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.070
 because it is extremely simple 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.080
 it is simply next 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.330
 next we accept the agreements of 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.770
 license that there is and good we select 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.090
 the destination folder where we want 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.730
 install the software 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:16.070
 german very simple once installed then 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.180
 is launched is the program and here what 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:19.370
 we would have 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:22.340
 us right now I in this pc I have 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:25.040
 right now 53 programs installed as 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.989
 you see and the applications are in a 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.659
 range from less to more that is to say from 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:32.030
 disparagement of less expendable at 

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:34.489
 essential explanations or software 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.739
 It means those who do not have 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:39.349
 to erase or we should not delete the law 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:40.670
 like for example we have the microsoft 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:43.519
 office 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:46.730
 database in line, well, the software 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:48.319
 consider that this one or sarasola 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.419
 the demos believes that this software 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:52.669
 It is software that we need 

00:02:50.419 --> 00:02:55.099
 have in our pc is worth then 

00:02:52.669 --> 00:02:58.430
 we would have here the get databa that is a 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:59.359
 program to recover the files 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.209
 data 

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:03.680
 retrieve the information and well what 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:05.659
 consider a program that we should not 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.669
 Uninstall voucher as you see also us 

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:10.219
 gives detailed information on when 

00:03:07.669 --> 00:03:12.019
 installed and well what it occupies and 

00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:15.200
 others if we would give it here in 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:17.720
 what is it we would say what programs this 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.690
 ok what this program is about 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:23.540
 we could also uninstall it by giving it 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:25.760
 here in yunist to ballet so no 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:28.250
 we would have to go to the control panel and 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.620
 well, that is 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:33.170
 enter add or remove programs 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.640
 to uninstall the software simply 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:38.090
 we could uninstall it from here 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.990
 ok we have here the speech of microsoft 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.230
 the office 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:45.280
 good in definite programs that 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:47.930
 are those of move it considered to be 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:51.530
 essential is worth the google was here 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:53.270
 we would have the different controllers 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.780
 from the n-vi dial n-vi from there for 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:04:00.709
 Experience the nvidia 3d driver 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:02.750
 vision is worth different software 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:05.360
 what are they saying? 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:09.800
 essential for the pc the plugin of 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:11.540
 of the cinema 4d the adobe flash player for 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:14.510
 playing videos and everything he 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:16.250
 come back that good because in the end they are like 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.889
 I have commented essential programs 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:21.650
 here we would have envy 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:24.189
 for the software of life and others and as 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:27.139
 you see then it goes as we go up 

00:04:24.189 --> 00:04:29.930
 we started to find programs that did 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:32.360
 that we can uninstall ok if not 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.550
 we were all the way up here because 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.860
 these programs considers the software 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:38.900
 which are essential programs is 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:43.370
 say that we can uninstall it by 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:44.900
 example this is because Monday is worth a 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.249
 software that I do not use but good what 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.649
 I have there 

00:04:46.249 --> 00:04:51.260
 either because he does not use it or because 

00:04:48.649 --> 00:04:54.590
 I have the avg 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:56.900
 the soft i'm on it considers that we should 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:58.970
 uninstall it worth or we could 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:00.890
 uninstall it and it does not happen nothing would happen 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:03.110
 ok then we have the booster drive that 

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:05.810
 for driver update other 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:08.990
 software that I do not use and therefore 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:11.030
 we could uninstall it and well then 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:14.690
 it would give no error to the operating system 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:16.430
 and it is not part of the hardware to mine that 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:17.900
 therefore, here you see that what 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:20.419
 we can uninstall and there was no 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:22.010
 problem is worth as we go down then 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:24.320
 we will continue to meet with the 

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:26.060
 programs like I said before that 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:28.910
 they are essential for our system 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:30.440
 operative for our pc is worth a 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:32.690
 little more than comment here if 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:34.639
 we give in about simply 

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:36.860
 our information about the software 

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:37.970
 in options this I recommend you leave it 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:40.460
 How is it going 

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:43.729
 and here to follow simply in case 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:46.970
 you want to share this software with 

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:48.410
 your friends or with your people nothing 

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:50.479
 little more than comment on this 

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:53.990
 I hope this program helps you 

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:56.560
 to make these decisions are not you 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:58.820
 elections that good because in the end 

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:01.100
 we can get into a mess if we give up 

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:04.160
 things that we should not uninstall 

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:05.750
 cullen so nothing with this already 

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.430
 dismissal I hope this little tutorial 

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:09.290
 I liked you above all that I have 

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:11.780
 served and if so, leave your and your
