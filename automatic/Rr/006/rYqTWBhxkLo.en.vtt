cool looking bike it's still got the

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.430 
cool looking bike it's still got the
original<00:02:30.330> spokes<00:02:30.959> and<00:02:32.180> all<00:02:33.180> the<00:02:33.450> hubs<00:02:33.989> haven't

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
original spokes and all the hubs haven't

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.680 
original spokes and all the hubs haven't
been<00:02:34.530> all<00:02:34.650> done<00:02:34.890> and<00:02:35.160> stuff<00:02:35.370> to<00:02:35.730> the<00:02:36.270> rims<00:02:36.540> look

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.830 
think they're the original rims I'm the
only<00:02:41.700> gonna<00:02:41.850> guess<00:02:42.090> they<00:02:42.269> are<00:02:42.440> and<00:02:44.690> those<00:02:45.690> are
