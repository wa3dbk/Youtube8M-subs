00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.560
 ah 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:15.639
 very good and welcome to the video that 

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:17.230
 I promised on how to make a mini monza and 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:21.880
 there has been a lot of expectation in this 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:22.840
 video and that creates a little bit the concern of 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.340
 that then it can be a little 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.630
 disappointing is not like when a 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.630
 movie puts in the trailer 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:34.210
 for this then well then what 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.400
 I want to explain a little how to do 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.410
 step by step minimum a simple 6 and 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.780
 plainly he has no more then look 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.520
 this is the seedling quoted that I did in 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.620
 the video of the cuttings when he explains 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:47.260
 let's do it is that plant a ficus 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.420
 I put a little bottle and that's how it goes 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.860
 the ficus today is already throwing 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.800
 myths below these are the leaves that 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:56.860
 maintains it is very trilling but it will sprout and 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.540
 this little ficus will be very well 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.220
 has a little known the base 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:03.070
 because of course the branches themselves are already 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:06.130
 conical although it is not perceptible 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:08.260
 so this may be the beginning of a 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:13.479
 bonsai or we can start with a material 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:15.970
 already more advanced as is how are the 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:17.260
 cuttings of thicker branches me when 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.180
 some nickname of a bonsai when a 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.420
 He painted almost always is that almost 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.420
 all 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.250
 beige and these are already is that is more 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:29.350
 great then this is that they are going to 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.509
 take much less time to give us that 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.840
 joy not here there is a dry family 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:38.440
 but usually it goes out without time like this 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:41.380
 in 99 9 then this is the start or 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:44.740
 this is the beginning of 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:47.829
 a minimum of one bonsai or of any 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.630
 thing that is the beginning then 

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:52.230
 look, I have here a little bit 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:55.740
 more advanced 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:57.210
 how is this this is a branch this I what 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.910
 I really regret that I can not do it 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.740
 because it is beautiful this branch has or is 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:04.740
 this is that you have a movement here 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.600
 totally makes one super fat and 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.780
 apart with much comedy is perfect 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.220
 apart it has here a long branch that is 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.110
 of course the sacrificial branch that 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.670
 then we will eliminate it to cause a 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.600
 sprout down below what I'm going to 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:20.940
 teach now how interesting this is 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.350
 he started making a typical twig 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.840
 Fixed branches that even have the shape 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.490
 from the typical branch that you are in a bonsai 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.720
 we cut it instead of throwing it away 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:31.260
 that we leave especially in the case of 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.910
 trees with species that are easy to 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.400
 complain as he of course in cases of 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.470
 5 a ficus micro tent separate with state 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.810
 of health look at the perfect leaf 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.850
 this tree when I raised it does not 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.400
 it makes a lot of account I also buried it 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.510
 practically whole up here fixos 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.970
 that this is very black still because 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.580
 is transplanted very recently you see 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.810
 very well anchored as always and I good 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.130
 I know this tree from the pot 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.490
 I thought it was very exquisite because 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:59.010
 I did not remember 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:03:01.690
 take this pleasant surprise then what 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:05.200
 individual raises it below so that the 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:06.850
 snow and make a radial root system 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.680
 to be formed in the form of radio 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:10.990
 struck down and that will also help 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.430
 that the tree with much more happiness for 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:14.440
 course we have to keep leaving the 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:17.020
 branches of long sacrifice that then the 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.880
 we will cut fixed then we will cut 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:20.500
 all these long twigs and we already have 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.740
 here a perfect structure to do 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:26.380
 a bonsai as is the case with this other 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:30.520
 which is exactly the same thing much more 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:33.330
 advanced already and with a bestial comedy 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:36.900
 this tree promises to look 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:39.450
 This tree promises to be a magnificent mini 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.370
 bonsai look my hand fixed the size 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.110
 that has the tree and the comedy that 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.330
 have and if you look there for you and 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:47.130
 you are a little imagination look 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:50.190
 which has the first branch here already 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:51.690
 second branch you see that these branches will have 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.060
 have to cut them very short so that 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.920
 then come back from there and the 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.350
 apex and the mother will have to be removed and if 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.210
 we fear if it is a species of which 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:01.350
 let's be sure of its flotation and I'm 

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:03.210
 sure yes to this cut tree 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:05.730
 these two branches comes back from the 

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:07.020
 same edge if we are afraid if not 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:11.420
 we are sure that we can do is 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:14.860
 pick up a branch and graft the janda me 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:17.079
 and insert it here 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:19.720
 we make a graft approximation to this 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:22.750
 longer is not here we can 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.730
 graft here at the exit of the branch or 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:26.380
 we cut the branch completely and we passed 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:28.090
 one here and we take the branches where 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.200
 we want we can get here with another 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:30.670
 here and another here we have a thousand 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.830
 We have a million possibilities 

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:35.320
 possibilities and notice that we have here 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:37.000
 a potential mini bonsai that is a 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.400
 madness we can leave it in 10 centimeters 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.490
 we can cut him off by here 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:44.260
 example and fix what we have left a 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.810
 wonder and look at the size of truth is 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:49.240
 incredible and that is achieved because it is 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:50.800
 complaining or good can be done with the 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.910
 I also elbow but I almost always 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:55.690
 I do with the one who came a long way 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:05:00.220
 time you see the snow and you see if 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:01.810
 it says snowing and it's a wonder these 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:03.250
 they are cuttings of which I have not wanted 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:05.350
 they are projects that I did not want 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:06.880
 undo because they are very close already of 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:10.030
 be finished one that you have seen 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:12.070
 very little ago that it started being like this and 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:13.340
 It has already gone mad because it is a 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:16.090
 madness is this 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:18.820
 that every day is more beautiful by the way 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:21.490
 see how it goes this is not mini size 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:24.250
 this teachers a cushion but without 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:27.249
 is already becoming a piece of 

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:29.289
 Bonsai leaf size is fixed 

00:05:27.249 --> 00:05:31.419
 because you are growing a pot 

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:33.639
 true of the highest quality to touch me and 

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:36.309
 look at the structure that has this 

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:38.679
 tree is very close very close to 

00:05:36.309 --> 00:05:40.689
 become a perfect tree just me 

00:05:38.679 --> 00:05:42.759
 they are here these branches wired a 

00:05:40.689 --> 00:05:44.949
 little out to create a 

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:46.839
 correct branch 

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:48.429
 here also bifurcate a little bit and already 

00:05:46.839 --> 00:05:50.499
 then pricked punctured punctured that is 

00:05:48.429 --> 00:05:53.709
 what is going to make the bag keep 

00:05:50.499 --> 00:05:56.739
 in this size with this with this shape 

00:05:53.709 --> 00:05:58.569
 wonderful and be a mini or in this case 

00:05:56.739 --> 00:06:02.339
 It's a shopping mall because it's about 20 

00:05:58.569 --> 00:06:04.419
 centimeters 18 or 20 centimeters a cushion 

00:06:02.339 --> 00:06:06.309
 spectacular 

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:08.649
 finalizing well in this pot we are going to 

00:06:06.309 --> 00:06:10.569
 have of course we're going to get to the very 

00:06:08.649 --> 00:06:12.729
 my boy who is that clear character 

00:06:10.569 --> 00:06:15.039
 it acquires only in crop of the year of 

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:16.449
 grow pots and of course the 

00:06:15.039 --> 00:06:20.199
 branch will thicken and 

00:06:16.449 --> 00:06:23.589
 will become a super bonsai in 

00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:25.059
 miniature and all and all you will see it like this 

00:06:23.589 --> 00:06:27.270
 What dear friends dear friends this 

00:06:25.059 --> 00:06:30.540
 video this video 

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:32.490
 this video is very short because they are 

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:35.520
 Simple, simple steps to get there 

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:37.020
 to make a minimum the structure of the 

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:39.330
 branch the placement of the branch you have it 

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:40.680
 everything in the in the videos after 

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:42.060
 get in the first videos you have 

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:44.520
 the location the risk was for a 

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:46.700
 Substrate structure guidelines 

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:51.289
 Of course super important is everything 

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:53.659
 applicable to this size a hug 

00:06:51.289 --> 00:06:57.939
 here that I see the whole melon one 

00:06:53.659 --> 00:06:57.939
 hug and until the next video
