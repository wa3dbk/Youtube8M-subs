detail<00:00:31.679> on<00:00:31.859> this<00:00:32.160> thing<00:00:32.219> like<00:00:32.669> all<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.270> other

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
detail on this thing like all the other

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.780 
detail on this thing like all the other
memos<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.170> attention<00:00:34.829> to<00:00:35.010> detail<00:00:35.579> is

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790

absolutely<00:00:36.829> incredible<00:00:37.829> at<00:00:38.700> this<00:00:39.000> point<00:00:39.270> I

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
absolutely incredible at this point I

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.780 
absolutely incredible at this point I
think<00:00:39.510> we<00:00:39.809> can<00:00:39.989> almost<00:00:40.260> say<00:00:40.829> that<00:00:40.860> Sonic<00:00:41.520> is<00:00:41.730> a

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
think we can almost say that Sonic is a

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.520 
think we can almost say that Sonic is a
Nintendo<00:00:42.660> character<00:00:43.200> and<00:00:43.410> the

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
Nintendo character and the

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.040 
Nintendo character and the
representation<00:00:44.340> of<00:00:44.489> Sonic<00:00:45.120> as<00:00:45.300> a<00:00:45.360> character

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
representation of Sonic as a character

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.470 
representation of Sonic as a character
that<00:00:46.200> is<00:00:46.379> found<00:00:46.680> on<00:00:46.890> this<00:00:47.250> figure<00:00:47.520> couldn't<00:00:48.210> be

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
that is found on this figure couldn't be

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.900 
that is found on this figure couldn't be
any<00:00:48.840> better<00:00:49.469> every<00:00:50.039> little<00:00:50.280> detail<00:00:50.430> from<00:00:50.850> the

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
any better every little detail from the

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.380 
any better every little detail from the
shoes<00:00:51.329> to<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.719> hands<00:00:52.379> so<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.649> face<00:00:52.949> is

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
shoes to the hands so the face is

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.209 
shoes to the hands so the face is
absolutely<00:00:54.390> spot<00:00:54.870> I'm<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.829> only<00:00:55.920> thing<00:00:56.010> I

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
absolutely spot I'm the only thing I

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.560 
absolutely spot I'm the only thing I
think<00:00:56.430> they<00:00:56.550> could<00:00:56.699> have<00:00:56.789> changed<00:00:57.000> is<00:00:57.329> the

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
think they could have changed is the

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.330 
think they could have changed is the
size<00:00:57.809> of<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.230> support<00:00:58.680> stand<00:00:58.980> that<00:00:59.160> holds

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
size of the support stand that holds

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.670 
size of the support stand that holds
Sonic<00:00:59.940> up<00:01:00.210> it<00:01:00.510> is<00:01:00.690> rather<00:01:00.899> large<00:01:01.199> compared<00:01:01.649> to

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
Sonic up it is rather large compared to

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.650 
Sonic up it is rather large compared to
once<00:01:01.949> found<00:01:02.190> on<00:01:02.399> other<00:01:02.579> me<00:01:02.969> boats<00:01:03.210> but<00:01:03.449> it<00:01:03.539> was

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
once found on other me boats but it was

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.479 
once found on other me boats but it was
probably<00:01:03.989> necessary<00:01:04.320> to<00:01:04.920> give<00:01:05.100> it<00:01:05.189> a<00:01:05.280> solid

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
probably necessary to give it a solid

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.240 
probably necessary to give it a solid
feel<00:01:05.850> given<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.450> action<00:01:07.080> pose<00:01:07.350> Sonic<00:01:07.950> is

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
feel given the action pose Sonic is

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.210 
feel given the action pose Sonic is
positioned<00:01:09.060> in<00:01:09.210> overall<00:01:09.900> Sonic<00:01:10.380> truly<00:01:10.950> lives

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
positioned in overall Sonic truly lives

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.000 
positioned in overall Sonic truly lives
