00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
that can destroy people in tier 1 so

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:43.369 
that can destroy people in tier 1 so
build<00:00:35.280> a<00:00:35.370> new<00:00:35.579> robot<00:00:35.940> here<00:00:37.250> and<00:00:40.399> I<00:00:42.379> usually

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
build a new robot here and I usually

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:44.869 
build a new robot here and I usually
like<00:00:43.590> to<00:00:43.739> build<00:00:43.950> it<00:00:44.129> around<00:00:44.250> three<00:00:44.640> blocks

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
like to build it around three blocks

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.029 
like to build it around three blocks
high<00:00:45.120> so<00:00:45.750> I<00:00:45.840> can<00:00:45.870> see<00:00:46.260> underneath<00:00:46.500> everything

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
high so I can see underneath everything

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.380 
high so I can see underneath everything
and<00:00:48.980> basically<00:00:49.980> I'm<00:00:50.610> gonna<00:00:50.820> have<00:00:51.059> a<00:00:51.090> very

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
and basically I'm gonna have a very

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:58.689 
and basically I'm gonna have a very
basic<00:00:52.610> vehicle<00:00:54.440> except<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:56.250> level<00:00:56.940> 4<00:00:57.590> SMG

00:00:58.689 --> 00:00:58.699 
basic vehicle except the level 4 SMG

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:01.700 
basic vehicle except the level 4 SMG
that<00:00:59.699> thing<00:00:59.940> basically<00:01:00.120> just<00:01:00.510> melts<00:01:01.109> pieces

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
that thing basically just melts pieces

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.109 
that thing basically just melts pieces
apart<00:01:02.070> like<00:01:03.110> tier<00:01:04.110> 1<00:01:04.350> armor<00:01:04.890> does<00:01:05.309> white<00:01:05.820> stuff

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
apart like tier 1 armor does white stuff

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:06.820 
apart like tier 1 armor does white stuff
right<00:01:06.299> here

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
right here

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.960 
right here
so<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:08.610> armor<00:01:09.030> is<00:01:09.299> 25<00:01:10.200> and<00:01:10.890> then<00:01:11.670> when<00:01:11.850> you

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
so the armor is 25 and then when you

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.980 
so the armor is 25 and then when you
look<00:01:12.150> at<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.479> tier<00:01:12.930> 4<00:01:13.350> or<00:01:14.310> level<00:01:14.909> 4<00:01:15.119> SMG<00:01:15.630> the

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
look at the tier 4 or level 4 SMG the

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.840 
look at the tier 4 or level 4 SMG the
armor<00:01:16.229> is<00:01:16.460> 2003

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
armor is 2003

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.950 
armor is 2003
so<00:01:18.560> yeah<00:01:19.560> it's<00:01:19.770> significantly<00:01:20.549> way<00:01:21.479> more

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
so yeah it's significantly way more

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.929 
so yeah it's significantly way more
damage<00:01:22.409> per<00:01:23.030> oh<00:01:24.030> wait<00:01:24.680> nevermind<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:26.490> damage

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
damage per oh wait nevermind the damage

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.649 
damage per oh wait nevermind the damage
is<00:01:27.090> 401<00:01:27.780> armors<00:01:28.409> 2003<00:01:29.340> alright<00:01:29.790> still<00:01:30.240> damage

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
is 401 armors 2003 alright still damage

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.200 
is 401 armors 2003 alright still damage
is<00:01:30.780> way<00:01:30.960> more<00:01:31.259> than<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.619> armor<00:01:31.950> for<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:32.970> light

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
is way more than the armor for the light

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.609 
is way more than the armor for the light
chassis

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
chassis

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.050 
chassis
so<00:01:35.659> put<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.780> pilot<00:01:36.990> seat<00:01:37.380> right<00:01:37.619> here

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
so put the pilot seat right here

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:50.500 
so put the pilot seat right here
and<00:01:40.939> hardware<00:01:42.470> the<00:01:43.470> system<00:01:44.009> gee

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:50.510 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:56.090 

okay<00:01:51.510> and<00:01:52.550> that's<00:01:53.550> it<00:01:54.080> so<00:01:55.080> I'll<00:01:55.470> come<00:01:55.710> back<00:01:55.740> in

so as you can tell the smaller the
target<00:06:02.970> the<00:06:03.150> more<00:06:03.180> damage<00:06:03.750> this<00:06:03.930> does<00:06:04.169> and<00:06:04.610> it

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:05.610 
target the more damage this does and it

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:07.839 
target the more damage this does and it
is<00:06:05.639> just<00:06:05.909> devastating<00:06:06.720> against<00:06:07.050> tiny<00:06:07.289> targets

00:06:07.839 --> 00:06:07.849 
is just devastating against tiny targets

00:06:07.849 --> 00:06:13.059 
is just devastating against tiny targets
though<00:06:08.849> it<00:06:09.000> is<00:06:09.120> harder<00:06:09.419> to<00:06:09.449> hit<00:06:09.569> a<00:06:09.750> longer<00:06:10.169> ring

00:06:13.059 --> 00:06:13.069 

00:06:13.069 --> 00:06:16.790 

and<00:06:14.069> what<00:06:14.280> I<00:06:14.310> do<00:06:14.599> using<00:06:15.599> this<00:06:15.689> robot<00:06:15.960> is<00:06:16.319> just

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:16.800 
and what I do using this robot is just

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:21.409 
and what I do using this robot is just
backup<00:06:17.840> my<00:06:18.840> teammates<00:06:19.349> by<00:06:19.830> sniping<00:06:20.419> can't

00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:21.419 
backup my teammates by sniping can't

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:24.589 
backup my teammates by sniping can't
really<00:06:21.810> go<00:06:22.080> in<00:06:22.289> and<00:06:22.500> go<00:06:23.250> in<00:06:23.370> fight<00:06:23.669> firefight

00:06:24.589 --> 00:06:24.599 
really go in and go in fight firefight

00:06:24.599 --> 00:06:26.809 
really go in and go in fight firefight
because<00:06:24.960> you<00:06:25.770> don't<00:06:25.919> have<00:06:26.039> very<00:06:26.099> much<00:06:26.430> armor

00:06:26.809 --> 00:06:26.819 
because you don't have very much armor

00:06:26.819 --> 00:06:32.059 
because you don't have very much armor
so<00:06:27.539> you<00:06:27.599> can't<00:06:27.900> take<00:06:28.110> a<00:06:28.169> lot<00:06:28.349> of<00:06:28.469> hits<00:06:30.530> like<00:06:31.530> one

00:06:32.059 --> 00:06:32.069 
so you can't take a lot of hits like one

00:06:32.069 --> 00:06:35.540 
so you can't take a lot of hits like one
hit<00:06:32.310> with<00:06:32.460> a<00:06:32.490> plasma<00:06:33.650> bomb<00:06:34.650> and<00:06:34.979> you're

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:35.550 
hit with a plasma bomb and you're

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:41.440 
hit with a plasma bomb and you're
probably<00:06:35.759> dead

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:41.450 

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:44.560 

so<00:06:42.440> thank<00:06:42.860> you<00:06:42.950> for<00:06:43.130> watching<00:06:43.520> and<00:06:43.730> go<00:06:44.390> try

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:44.570 
so thank you for watching and go try

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:47.260 
so thank you for watching and go try
this<00:06:44.630> out<00:06:44.870> yourself
