00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.729 
what is what's the best release point of
that<00:02:13.400> player<00:02:13.760> then<00:02:14.599> you'll<00:02:15.410> pretty<00:02:15.650> much

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739 
that player then you'll pretty much

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:17.440 
that player then you'll pretty much
start<00:02:16.130> hitting<00:02:16.370> a<00:02:16.400> lot<00:02:16.520> of<00:02:16.580> shots<00:02:16.910> I<00:02:17.150> know<00:02:17.270> he's

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
start hitting a lot of shots I know he's

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.100 
start hitting a lot of shots I know he's
gone<00:02:17.660> cold<00:02:18.020> here<00:02:19.390> but<00:02:20.390> let's<00:02:20.599> just<00:02:20.660> take

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
gone cold here but let's just take

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.089 
gone cold here but let's just take
another<00:02:21.470> player<00:02:22.989> just<00:02:23.989> take<00:02:24.170> off<00:02:24.349> Paul<00:02:24.680> Pierce

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:25.099 
another player just take off Paul Pierce

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:29.520 
another player just take off Paul Pierce
as<00:02:25.870> we<00:02:26.870> see<00:02:27.110> here<00:02:27.349> is<00:02:27.800> Ray<00:02:28.340> Allen<00:02:28.700> jumper

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
as we see here is Ray Allen jumper

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.140 
as we see here is Ray Allen jumper
pretty<00:02:30.530> quick<00:02:30.860> Paul<00:02:31.280> Pierce<00:02:31.640> jumpers<00:02:32.120> a

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
pretty quick Paul Pierce jumpers a

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:37.240 
pretty quick Paul Pierce jumpers a
little<00:02:32.420> bit<00:02:32.510> slower<00:02:32.810> than<00:02:33.019> that<00:02:34.540> okay<00:02:36.010> so<00:02:37.010> it's

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
little bit slower than that okay so it's

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.059 
little bit slower than that okay so it's
a<00:02:37.340> different<00:02:37.519> release<00:02:38.120> for<00:02:38.540> every<00:02:39.019> player<00:02:39.410> or

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:40.069 
a different release for every player or

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:42.220 
a different release for every player or
for<00:02:40.550> the<00:02:40.790> majority<00:02:41.180> of<00:02:41.209> players<00:02:41.420> because<00:02:41.959> some

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
for the majority of players because some

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.130 
for the majority of players because some
players<00:02:42.560> have<00:02:43.360> different<00:02:44.360> or<00:02:44.600> some<00:02:44.900> players

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
players have different or some players

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.390 
players have different or some players
have<00:02:45.260> the<00:02:45.440> same<00:02:45.860> jumper<00:02:46.489> as<00:02:47.110> others<00:02:48.110> I<00:02:48.400> think

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
have the same jumper as others I think

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.190 
have the same jumper as others I think
Andre<00:02:49.700> Iguodala<00:02:49.850> is<00:02:50.420> one<00:02:50.600> of<00:02:50.690> those<00:02:50.780> players

the<00:04:18.979> highest<00:04:19.190> percentage<00:04:19.489> or<00:04:20.209> the<00:04:20.330> high

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
the highest percentage or the high

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.080 
the highest percentage or the high
a<00:04:20.750> chance<00:04:21.260> of<00:04:21.440> making<00:04:21.769> it<00:04:21.860> possible<00:04:22.100> with<00:04:22.910> the

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
a chance of making it possible with the

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:27.490 
a chance of making it possible with the
releasing<00:04:23.870> of<00:04:23.870> the<00:04:25.240> ball<00:04:26.240> at<00:04:26.570> the<00:04:27.140> highest

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
releasing of the ball at the highest

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:43.390 
releasing of the ball at the highest
point<00:04:28.220> all<00:04:28.850> right<00:04:41.590> hot<00:04:42.590> zone<00:04:42.890> is<00:04:43.100> where<00:04:43.370> a

player is most comfortable from shooting

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.730 
player is most comfortable from shooting
and<00:04:46.070> it<00:04:46.550> also<00:04:46.730> increases<00:04:47.210> the<00:04:47.570> chances<00:04:48.080> of<00:04:48.140> him

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 
and it also increases the chances of him

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.820 
and it also increases the chances of him
making<00:04:49.610> the<00:04:49.910> shot<00:04:50.150> with<00:04:50.900> or<00:04:51.140> without<00:04:51.320> him

being hot or cold what you do is you

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:55.960 
being hot or cold what you do is you
take<00:04:54.350> your<00:04:54.560> player<00:04:54.950> and<00:04:55.250> you<00:04:55.460> just<00:04:55.640> walk

slightly vibrate ok now I'm going to

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:24.460 
slightly vibrate ok now I'm going to
check<00:05:19.190> any<00:05:19.340> more<00:05:19.640> spots<00:05:20.480> just<00:05:21.470> walk<00:05:21.680> around<00:05:23.470> ok

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:24.470 
check any more spots just walk around ok

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:26.740 
check any more spots just walk around ok
right<00:05:24.770> around<00:05:25.040> this<00:05:25.280> same<00:05:25.550> area<00:05:25.880> on<00:05:26.330> the

opposite side of the court it's

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:30.370 
opposite side of the court it's
vibrating<00:05:29.030> again<00:05:29.480> I'm<00:05:30.110> going<00:05:30.260> to<00:05:30.320> check

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:30.380 
vibrating again I'm going to check

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:35.110 
vibrating again I'm going to check
anywhere<00:05:30.890> inside<00:05:31.280> the<00:05:31.340> paint<00:05:33.640> nothing<00:05:34.640> inside

anywhere inside the paint nothing inside

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:39.159 
anywhere inside the paint nothing inside
the<00:05:35.330> paint<00:05:36.340> ok<00:05:37.340> I'm<00:05:38.150> going<00:05:38.330> to<00:05:38.390> go<00:05:38.510> back<00:05:38.540> here

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:39.169 
the paint ok I'm going to go back here

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:41.440 
the paint ok I'm going to go back here
it's<00:05:40.160> pulsating<00:05:40.580> right<00:05:40.850> there<00:05:41.090> and<00:05:41.270> check

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:41.450 
it's pulsating right there and check

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:48.900 
it's pulsating right there and check
around<00:05:41.690> the<00:05:41.840> three-point<00:05:42.380> line

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:48.910 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:50.760 

okay<00:05:49.570> nothing<00:05:49.720> around<00:05:50.050> the<00:05:50.200> three-point<00:05:50.680> line

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:50.770 
okay nothing around the three-point line

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:54.180 
okay nothing around the three-point line
but<00:05:51.430> when<00:05:51.580> I<00:05:51.610> get<00:05:51.760> here<00:05:52.360> it's<00:05:53.260> pulsating<00:05:53.890> it's

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:54.190 
but when I get here it's pulsating it's

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:57.420 
but when I get here it's pulsating it's
vibrating<00:05:54.640> so<00:05:55.540> what<00:05:56.080> that<00:05:56.110> means<00:05:56.590> is<00:05:56.920> is<00:05:57.190> that

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:57.430 
vibrating so what that means is is that

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:59.430 
vibrating so what that means is is that
if<00:05:57.670> I<00:05:57.910> shoot<00:05:58.270> from<00:05:58.540> an<00:05:58.690> area<00:05:59.020> where<00:05:59.230> he's

00:05:59.430 --> 00:05:59.440 
if I shoot from an area where he's

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.650 
if I shoot from an area where he's
comfortable<00:05:59.740> from<00:06:00.280> that<00:06:00.970> just<00:06:01.210> gives<00:06:01.390> me<00:06:01.630> a

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:01.660 
comfortable from that just gives me a

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:03.960 
comfortable from that just gives me a
greater<00:06:02.050> chance<00:06:02.470> of<00:06:02.710> making<00:06:03.100> the<00:06:03.130> jumper<00:06:03.640> now

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:03.970 
greater chance of making the jumper now

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:05.400 
greater chance of making the jumper now
does<00:06:04.180> it<00:06:04.300> mean<00:06:04.480> that<00:06:04.510> I'm<00:06:04.750> going<00:06:04.900> to<00:06:04.960> hit<00:06:05.170> every

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:05.410 
does it mean that I'm going to hit every

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:08.040 
does it mean that I'm going to hit every
jumper<00:06:05.950> that<00:06:06.130> I<00:06:06.160> shoot<00:06:06.490> from<00:06:06.670> these<00:06:06.880> spots<00:06:07.210> no

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:08.050 
jumper that I shoot from these spots no

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:09.600 
jumper that I shoot from these spots no
because<00:06:08.320> I<00:06:08.500> missed<00:06:08.800> the<00:06:08.890> first<00:06:09.100> jumper<00:06:09.430> that<00:06:09.550> I

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:09.610 
because I missed the first jumper that I

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:12.270 
because I missed the first jumper that I
shot<00:06:10.000> it<00:06:10.240> just<00:06:10.780> means<00:06:10.990> that<00:06:11.230> it<00:06:11.740> you<00:06:12.160> know

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:12.280 
shot it just means that it you know

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:15.780 
shot it just means that it you know
under<00:06:12.640> certain<00:06:13.270> circumstances<00:06:14.400> you<00:06:15.400> know<00:06:15.520> if

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:15.790 
under certain circumstances you know if

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:18.030 
under certain circumstances you know if
I<00:06:16.060> get<00:06:16.810> it<00:06:16.930> at<00:06:17.080> the<00:06:17.110> shoot<00:06:17.470> it<00:06:17.590> at<00:06:17.710> the<00:06:17.830> top<00:06:18.010> of

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:18.040 
I get it at the shoot it at the top of

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:20.670 
I get it at the shoot it at the top of
his<00:06:18.250> jumper<00:06:18.700> or<00:06:18.940> if<00:06:19.630> I'm<00:06:19.810> wide<00:06:20.050> open<00:06:20.080> if<00:06:20.620> a
