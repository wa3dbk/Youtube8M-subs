so<00:02:33.440> you<00:02:33.829> know<00:02:34.720> from<00:02:35.720> a<00:02:35.750> distance<00:02:36.200> it<00:02:36.349> does<00:02:36.500> kind

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:36.739 
so you know from a distance it does kind

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:38.619 
so you know from a distance it does kind
of<00:02:36.799> kind<00:02:37.340> of<00:02:37.459> you<00:02:37.610> know<00:02:37.700> look<00:02:37.909> like<00:02:38.150> Slimers

00:02:38.619 --> 00:02:38.629 
of kind of you know look like Slimers

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:44.319 
of kind of you know look like Slimers
floating<00:02:41.439> now<00:02:42.439> this<00:02:43.159> is<00:02:43.340> an<00:02:43.489> opaque<00:02:43.849> Slimer

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:44.329 
floating now this is an opaque Slimer

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:46.630 
floating now this is an opaque Slimer
there<00:02:44.689> is<00:02:44.840> also<00:02:45.049> a<00:02:45.200> clear<00:02:45.590> Slimer<00:02:45.980> that<00:02:46.400> is

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
there is also a clear Slimer that is

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.369 
there is also a clear Slimer that is
being<00:02:47.120> released<00:02:47.420> as<00:02:47.659> well<00:02:49.750> my<00:02:50.750> my<00:02:51.079> problem

00:02:51.369 --> 00:02:51.379 
being released as well my my problem

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:54.270 
being released as well my my problem
however<00:02:52.190> though<00:02:52.489> and<00:02:52.849> I<00:02:53.629> don't<00:02:53.690> know<00:02:53.900> this

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
however though and I don't know this

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.399 
however though and I don't know this
probably<00:02:55.280> is<00:02:55.609> more<00:02:55.819> soba<00:02:56.239> Slimer<00:02:56.569> depicted<00:02:57.200> in

00:02:57.399 --> 00:02:57.409 
probably is more soba Slimer depicted in

00:02:57.409 --> 00:02:59.500 
probably is more soba Slimer depicted in
ghostbusters<00:02:58.159> 2<00:02:58.519> I<00:02:58.790> know<00:02:59.180> some<00:02:59.389> people

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
ghostbusters 2 I know some people

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.670 
ghostbusters 2 I know some people
probably<00:02:59.900> may<00:03:00.170> argue<00:03:00.560> that<00:03:00.590> with<00:03:00.889> me<00:03:01.099> but<00:03:02.680> I'm

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
probably may argue that with me but I'm

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.170 
probably may argue that with me but I'm
not<00:03:03.739> a<00:03:03.889> big<00:03:04.040> fan<00:03:04.310> of<00:03:04.370> Slimer<00:03:04.879> from

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
not a big fan of Slimer from

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.149 
not a big fan of Slimer from
ghostbusters<00:03:05.780> 2<00:03:06.049> I<00:03:06.260> don't<00:03:06.500> well<00:03:06.739> I<00:03:06.950> didn't

00:03:07.149 --> 00:03:07.159 
ghostbusters 2 I don't well I didn't

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:09.699 
ghostbusters 2 I don't well I didn't
like<00:03:07.310> his<00:03:07.459> design<00:03:07.879> i<00:03:08.150> like<00:03:08.720> Slimer<00:03:09.109> a<00:03:09.260> lot<00:03:09.440> more

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
like his design i like Slimer a lot more

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:11.619 
like his design i like Slimer a lot more
in<00:03:09.799> the<00:03:09.889> first<00:03:10.159> one<00:03:10.519> and<00:03:10.790> I<00:03:10.849> guess<00:03:11.090> they<00:03:11.299> they

00:03:11.619 --> 00:03:11.629 
in the first one and I guess they they

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:13.449 
in the first one and I guess they they
really<00:03:11.870> for<00:03:12.200> the<00:03:12.260> sequel<00:03:12.620> wanted<00:03:13.010> to<00:03:13.129> make<00:03:13.280> him

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
really for the sequel wanted to make him

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:16.089 
really for the sequel wanted to make him
look<00:03:13.790> give<00:03:14.299> a<00:03:14.329> more<00:03:14.629> character<00:03:15.170> but<00:03:15.920> he<00:03:15.980> was

00:03:16.089 --> 00:03:16.099 
look give a more character but he was

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:18.640 
look give a more character but he was
very<00:03:16.280> large<00:03:16.670> and<00:03:17.180> his<00:03:17.299> head<00:03:17.540> and<00:03:18.230> his<00:03:18.349> face<00:03:18.590> was

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
very large and his head and his face was

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.199 
very large and his head and his face was
further<00:03:19.220> up<00:03:19.489> on<00:03:19.669> his<00:03:19.819> body

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
further up on his body

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:22.689 
further up on his body
I<00:03:20.329> like<00:03:21.230> the<00:03:21.379> Ghostbusters<00:03:21.769> one<00:03:22.310> Slimer

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:22.699 
I like the Ghostbusters one Slimer

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:25.030 
I like the Ghostbusters one Slimer
whereas<00:03:23.120> his<00:03:23.840> head<00:03:24.079> was<00:03:24.260> more<00:03:24.530> you<00:03:25.010> know

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
whereas his head was more you know

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.369 
whereas his head was more you know
further<00:03:25.549> down<00:03:25.879> and<00:03:26.180> he<00:03:26.540> was<00:03:26.660> more<00:03:26.840> like<00:03:27.049> a<00:03:27.079> ball

00:03:27.369 --> 00:03:27.379 
further down and he was more like a ball

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:29.710 
further down and he was more like a ball
like<00:03:27.859> you<00:03:28.040> know<00:03:28.190> just<00:03:28.400> a<00:03:28.519> was<00:03:29.239> like<00:03:29.389> he<00:03:29.510> looked

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
like you know just a was like he looked

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.689 
like you know just a was like he looked
like<00:03:29.810> a<00:03:29.840> bean<00:03:30.199> now<00:03:30.889> granted<00:03:31.310> you<00:03:31.430> know<00:03:31.489> it's

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:31.699 
like a bean now granted you know it's

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:34.809 
like a bean now granted you know it's
about<00:03:31.790> the<00:03:32.060> same<00:03:32.299> give<00:03:32.690> or<00:03:32.870> take<00:03:33.049> but<00:03:33.379> I<00:03:34.340> don't

00:03:34.809 --> 00:03:34.819 
about the same give or take but I don't

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:36.280 
about the same give or take but I don't
know<00:03:34.910> I'm<00:03:35.030> not<00:03:35.180> I'm<00:03:35.389> not<00:03:35.419> very<00:03:35.690> impressed<00:03:35.840> with

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
know I'm not I'm not very impressed with

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.710 
know I'm not I'm not very impressed with
this<00:03:36.500> slime<00:03:36.769> right<00:03:37.010> I<00:03:37.040> I<00:03:37.459> almost<00:03:37.970> wish<00:03:38.359> I

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
this slime right I I almost wish I

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.689 
this slime right I I almost wish I
almost<00:03:39.440> wish<00:03:39.709> he<00:03:39.859> was<00:03:39.980> a<00:03:40.010> little<00:03:40.340> smaller

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:40.699 
almost wish he was a little smaller

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:43.689 
almost wish he was a little smaller
maybe<00:03:41.120> about<00:03:41.419> that<00:03:41.780> and<00:03:42.370> his<00:03:43.370> face<00:03:43.669> was

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:43.699 
maybe about that and his face was

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:46.809 
maybe about that and his face was
further<00:03:44.209> down<00:03:44.449> but<00:03:44.829> again<00:03:45.829> this<00:03:46.310> may<00:03:46.549> or<00:03:46.669> may

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:46.819 
further down but again this may or may

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:48.400 
further down but again this may or may
not<00:03:46.849> be<00:03:47.209> the<00:03:47.419> Slimer<00:03:47.780> depicted<00:03:48.349> from

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
not be the Slimer depicted from

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:50.710 
not be the Slimer depicted from
ghostbusters<00:03:49.040> 2<00:03:49.280> if<00:03:49.730> it<00:03:49.970> is<00:03:50.030> well<00:03:50.389> I<00:03:50.419> guess<00:03:50.629> it

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
ghostbusters 2 if it is well I guess it

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.030 
ghostbusters 2 if it is well I guess it
probably<00:03:50.989> makes<00:03:51.109> sense<00:03:51.230> that<00:03:51.620> he<00:03:51.709> looks<00:03:51.919> like

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
probably makes sense that he looks like

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.869 
probably makes sense that he looks like
that

00:03:52.869 --> 00:03:52.879 
that

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:55.750 
that
now<00:03:53.629> even<00:03:54.139> though<00:03:54.230> he<00:03:54.349> has<00:03:54.470> no<00:03:54.680> legs<00:03:54.949> you<00:03:55.609> can

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
now even though he has no legs you can

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.270 
now even though he has no legs you can
still<00:03:56.030> bend<00:03:56.359> his<00:03:56.659> arms<00:03:57.139> and<00:03:57.379> he<00:03:57.739> can<00:03:57.889> bend<00:03:58.099> at

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
still bend his arms and he can bend at

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.369 
still bend his arms and he can bend at
the<00:03:58.310> elbow<00:03:58.699> you<00:03:59.299> can<00:03:59.359> also<00:03:59.569> turn<00:03:59.840> at<00:03:59.989> the<00:04:00.079> hand

00:04:00.369 --> 00:04:00.379 
the elbow you can also turn at the hand

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:02.409 
the elbow you can also turn at the hand
that's<00:04:01.190> it<00:04:01.430> that's<00:04:01.609> really<00:04:01.849> it<00:04:02.090> though<00:04:02.269> he's

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:02.419 
that's it that's really it though he's

00:04:02.419 --> 00:04:05.250 
that's it that's really it though he's
just<00:04:02.659> he's<00:04:03.470> basically<00:04:03.799> a<00:04:03.949> being<00:04:04.250> with<00:04:04.459> hands

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
just he's basically a being with hands

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:11.830 
just he's basically a being with hands
but<00:04:06.260> there<00:04:06.379> you<00:04:06.470> have<00:04:06.500> Slimer<00:04:07.180> Louis<00:04:08.180> Tully<00:04:10.840> is

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
but there you have Slimer Louis Tully is

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.050 
but there you have Slimer Louis Tully is
strange<00:04:12.440> though<00:04:12.769> that<00:04:12.799> the<00:04:13.400> Ghostbusters

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
strange though that the Ghostbusters

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:20.560 
strange though that the Ghostbusters
mini<00:04:14.629> mates<00:04:15.519> wave<00:04:16.519> to<00:04:17.650> they<00:04:18.970> they've<00:04:19.970> given<00:04:20.419> us

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570 
mini mates wave to they they've given us

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:23.830 
mini mates wave to they they've given us
like<00:04:21.130> some<00:04:22.130> wave<00:04:22.460> hours<00:04:22.969> Ghostbusters<00:04:23.630> 2

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
like some wave hours Ghostbusters 2

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.800 
like some wave hours Ghostbusters 2
figures<00:04:24.349> and<00:04:24.620> to<00:04:25.490> me<00:04:25.639> I<00:04:25.669> would<00:04:26.060> almost<00:04:26.180> put

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
figures and to me I would almost put

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:28.690 
figures and to me I would almost put
all<00:04:26.840> the<00:04:26.960> wave<00:04:27.110> -<00:04:27.410> are<00:04:27.950> all<00:04:28.010> the<00:04:28.250> Ghostbusters

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:28.700 
all the wave - are all the Ghostbusters

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:31.659 
all the wave - are all the Ghostbusters
-<00:04:29.240> figures<00:04:29.780> or<00:04:30.560> mini<00:04:30.800> mates<00:04:31.040> I<00:04:31.220> probably<00:04:31.460> would

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:31.669 
- figures or mini mates I probably would

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:33.970 
- figures or mini mates I probably would
have<00:04:31.700> held<00:04:32.330> them<00:04:32.510> off<00:04:32.660> -<00:04:32.930> wave<00:04:33.230> three<00:04:33.770> and

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:33.980 
have held them off - wave three and

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.850 
have held them off - wave three and
maybe<00:04:34.700> kept<00:04:35.090> wave<00:04:35.389> two<00:04:35.720> for<00:04:36.139> specifically

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
maybe kept wave two for specifically

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.340 
maybe kept wave two for specifically
just<00:04:37.160> the<00:04:37.340> Ghostbusters<00:04:37.639> from<00:04:38.600> ghostbusters

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.350 
just the Ghostbusters from ghostbusters

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:42.010 
just the Ghostbusters from ghostbusters
one<00:04:39.620> so<00:04:40.280> I<00:04:40.310> mean<00:04:40.550> they<00:04:41.240> could<00:04:41.570> have<00:04:41.600> probably

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.020 
one so I mean they could have probably

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:45.220 
one so I mean they could have probably
swapped<00:04:42.620> out<00:04:42.860> this<00:04:43.220> Lewis<00:04:43.639> Tully<00:04:43.970> and<00:04:44.300> even

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:45.230 
swapped out this Lewis Tully and even

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:46.390 
swapped out this Lewis Tully and even
though<00:04:45.350> we've<00:04:45.500> already<00:04:45.650> gotten<00:04:45.950> a<00:04:46.130> Louis

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
though we've already gotten a Louis

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.370 
though we've already gotten a Louis
Tully<00:04:46.610> which<00:04:46.850> all<00:04:47.060> I'll<00:04:47.510> bring<00:04:47.750> in<00:04:47.870> here<00:04:48.110> for<00:04:48.350> a

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:48.380 
Tully which all I'll bring in here for a

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:49.740 
Tully which all I'll bring in here for a
second

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:49.750 
second

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:51.730 
second
even<00:04:50.750> though<00:04:50.840> they've<00:04:51.020> already<00:04:51.200> given<00:04:51.410> us<00:04:51.650> a

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:51.740 
even though they've already given us a

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:53.800 
even though they've already given us a
Louis<00:04:51.980> Tully<00:04:52.220> from<00:04:52.580> wave<00:04:52.850> from<00:04:53.450> the<00:04:53.570> first

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:53.810 
Louis Tully from wave from the first

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:57.520 
Louis Tully from wave from the first
wave<00:04:54.050> box<00:04:54.440> set<00:04:54.800> I<00:04:56.020> don't<00:04:57.020> know<00:04:57.110> I<00:04:57.139> probably

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:57.530 
wave box set I don't know I probably

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:59.800 
wave box set I don't know I probably
would<00:04:57.950> have<00:04:57.980> swapped<00:04:58.430> this<00:04:58.880> Louis<00:04:59.300> Tully<00:04:59.540> out

00:04:59.800 --> 00:04:59.810 
would have swapped this Louis Tully out

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:04.390 
would have swapped this Louis Tully out
and<00:05:00.139> maybe<00:05:00.560> given<00:05:00.889> us<00:05:01.010> a<00:05:01.130> Jeanine<00:05:02.889> and<00:05:03.889> then

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400 
and maybe given us a Jeanine and then

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:05.920 
and maybe given us a Jeanine and then
you<00:05:04.550> know<00:05:04.669> they<00:05:04.850> could<00:05:05.060> have<00:05:05.150> then<00:05:05.300> saved<00:05:05.660> him

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:05.930 
you know they could have then saved him

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:09.520 
you know they could have then saved him
for<00:05:06.200> the<00:05:06.560> Ghostbusters<00:05:07.550> too<00:05:08.060> many<00:05:08.360> mates<00:05:08.630> but

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:09.530 
for the Ghostbusters too many mates but

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:13.690 
for the Ghostbusters too many mates but
as<00:05:09.950> you<00:05:10.100> can<00:05:10.220> see<00:05:10.540> the<00:05:12.040> Louis<00:05:13.040> Tully<00:05:13.280> here<00:05:13.610> is

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:13.700 
as you can see the Louis Tully here is

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:16.600 
as you can see the Louis Tully here is
supporting<00:05:14.180> the<00:05:14.300> Ghostbusters<00:05:14.630> two<00:05:15.110> patch<00:05:15.610> so

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:16.610 
supporting the Ghostbusters two patch so

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:18.430 
supporting the Ghostbusters two patch so
it<00:05:16.760> will<00:05:17.000> be<00:05:17.150> different<00:05:17.389> than<00:05:17.690> the<00:05:17.990> regular
