as most of you know and have probably

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:34.439 
as most of you know and have probably
already<00:00:32.800> complained<00:00:33.550> about<00:00:33.730> it's<00:00:34.180> called

dragon<00:00:34.870> honor<00:00:35.019> I<00:00:35.230> do<00:00:35.320> have<00:00:35.500> quite<00:00:35.710> a<00:00:35.769> few

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:35.860 
dragon honor I do have quite a few

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.439 
dragon honor I do have quite a few
thoughts<00:00:36.160> in<00:00:36.370> the<00:00:36.460> specialization<00:00:37.180> but<00:00:37.420> i

00:00:37.439 --> 00:00:37.449 
thoughts in the specialization but i

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:39.479 
thoughts in the specialization but i
guess<00:00:37.839> i<00:00:37.989> have<00:00:38.110> to<00:00:38.140> mention<00:00:38.500> the<00:00:38.890> name<00:00:39.190> of<00:00:39.370> it

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:39.489 
guess i have to mention the name of it

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:42.119 
guess i have to mention the name of it
to<00:00:39.640> begin<00:00:39.760> with<00:00:39.940> because<00:00:40.930> most<00:00:41.410> people<00:00:41.890> seem

00:00:42.119 --> 00:00:42.129 
to begin with because most people seem

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:44.280 
to begin with because most people seem
to<00:00:42.160> be<00:00:42.370> very<00:00:42.400> much<00:00:43.150> against<00:00:43.629> it<00:00:43.780> admittedly

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:44.290 
to be very much against it admittedly

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:46.259 
to be very much against it admittedly
i'm<00:00:44.559> not<00:00:44.739> a<00:00:44.769> huge<00:00:44.980> fan<00:00:45.070> of<00:00:45.250> it<00:00:45.489> either<00:00:45.610> I<00:00:46.000> mean

00:00:46.259 --> 00:00:46.269 
i'm not a huge fan of it either I mean

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:49.650 
i'm not a huge fan of it either I mean
the<00:00:46.449> name<00:00:46.780> is<00:00:47.140> quite<00:00:47.860> lame<00:00:48.370> and<00:00:48.789> generic<00:00:49.390> but

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:49.660 
the name is quite lame and generic but

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:51.389 
the name is quite lame and generic but
to<00:00:49.899> a<00:00:49.930> certain<00:00:50.050> extent<00:00:50.410> I<00:00:50.590> believe<00:00:50.890> it<00:00:51.129> does

00:00:51.389 --> 00:00:51.399 
to a certain extent I believe it does

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:53.790 
to a certain extent I believe it does
help<00:00:51.760> support<00:00:52.180> my<00:00:52.390> theory<00:00:52.690> that<00:00:52.870> all<00:00:53.199> future

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:53.800 
help support my theory that all future

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.520 
help support my theory that all future
elite<00:00:54.399> specializations<00:00:55.210> will<00:00:55.809> be<00:00:55.989> tied<00:00:56.260> into

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:56.530 
elite specializations will be tied into

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.340 
elite specializations will be tied into
the<00:00:56.859> story<00:00:57.480> somehow<00:00:58.480> we<00:00:58.780> then<00:00:58.989> have<00:00:59.199> the

00:00:59.340 --> 00:00:59.350 
the story somehow we then have the

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.049 
the story somehow we then have the
Rangers<00:00:59.739> entering<00:01:00.190> into<00:01:00.340> the<00:01:00.520> jungle<00:01:00.879> which

Rangers entering into the jungle which

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:02.880 
Rangers entering into the jungle which

the name has already gotten this is just
speculation<00:01:30.729> but<00:01:31.390> perhaps<00:01:31.599> Brom<00:01:32.080> will<00:01:32.380> just

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:32.619 
speculation but perhaps Brom will just

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:35.010 
speculation but perhaps Brom will just
end<00:01:32.830> up<00:01:33.190> personifying<00:01:34.090> this<00:01:34.360> dragon<00:01:34.780> hunter

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
end up personifying this dragon hunter

end up personifying this dragon hunter
aspect<00:01:35.410> of<00:01:35.500> the<00:01:35.590> Guardian<00:01:36.009> and<00:01:36.940> just<00:01:37.209> going<00:01:37.630> on

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:37.869 
aspect of the Guardian and just going on

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:40.260

a killing spree still the name dragon
hunter<00:01:40.569> doesn't<00:01:40.840> really<00:01:41.319> fit<00:01:42.039> into<00:01:42.310> the<00:01:42.700> core

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
hunter doesn't really fit into the core

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.900 
hunter doesn't really fit into the core
theme<00:01:43.300> of<00:01:43.509> what<00:01:43.539> a<00:01:43.720> guardian<00:01:44.289> is<00:01:44.590> I<00:01:44.920> mean<00:01:45.520> why

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:45.910 
theme of what a guardian is I mean why

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.630 
theme of what a guardian is I mean why
is<00:01:46.270> this<00:01:46.599> protective<00:01:47.289> class<00:01:47.560> all<00:01:47.950> of<00:01:48.009> a<00:01:48.340> sudden

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
is this protective class all of a sudden

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.960 
is this protective class all of a sudden
out<00:01:48.759> to<00:01:48.940> hunt<00:01:49.149> big<00:01:49.450> game<00:01:50.250> it<00:01:51.250> just<00:01:51.459> feels<00:01:51.640> off

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:51.970 
out to hunt big game it just feels off

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.389 
out to hunt big game it just feels off
but<00:01:52.690> perhaps<00:01:53.080> there's<00:01:53.560> something<00:01:53.830> we<00:01:54.160> don't

00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:54.399 
but perhaps there's something we don't

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:55.919 
but perhaps there's something we don't
know<00:01:54.520> yet<00:01:54.880> yeah<00:01:55.119> the<00:01:55.300> phrase<00:01:55.630> that<00:01:55.780> keep

00:01:55.919 --> 00:01:55.929 
know yet yeah the phrase that keep

I love the concept of these it's just an

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:38.170 
specs will grant the best bonus then we

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:41.430 
specs will grant the best bonus then we
will<00:05:38.410> be<00:05:39.070> worrying<00:05:39.730> about<00:05:39.820> which<00:05:40.300> of<00:05:40.330> the<00:05:40.720> core

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:41.440

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:18.130 
started a new video series that I'm

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:19.470 
started a new video series that I'm
calling<00:06:18.460> kiri<00:06:18.700> and<00:06:18.850> character<00:06:19.150> ology

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:19.480 
calling kiri and character ology

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:22.620 
calling kiri and character ology
basically<00:06:20.380> it's<00:06:20.620> a<00:06:20.950> serious<00:06:21.610> where<00:06:22.000> I<00:06:22.030> do<00:06:22.180> an

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:22.630 
basically it's a serious where I do an

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:25.110 
basically it's a serious where I do an
in-depth<00:06:23.050> look<00:06:23.230> at<00:06:23.590> the<00:06:23.790> background<00:06:24.790> stories

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:25.120 
in-depth look at the background stories

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:27.030 
in-depth look at the background stories
of<00:06:25.270> specific<00:06:25.840> important<00:06:26.470> characters<00:06:26.890> I

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:27.040 
of specific important characters I

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:28.530 
of specific important characters I
decided<00:06:27.370> to<00:06:27.550> start<00:06:27.730> off<00:06:27.910> with<00:06:28.060> the<00:06:28.090> be<00:06:28.240> iconic

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:28.540 
decided to start off with the be iconic

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:30.000 
decided to start off with the be iconic
since<00:06:28.840> I<00:06:28.930> think<00:06:29.110> a<00:06:29.169> lot<00:06:29.200> of<00:06:29.380> players<00:06:29.680> don't

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:30.010 
since I think a lot of players don't

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:32.070 
since I think a lot of players don't
really<00:06:30.250> know<00:06:30.490> why<00:06:31.270> these<00:06:31.330> people<00:06:31.570> are

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:32.080 
really know why these people are

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:34.080 
really know why these people are
important<00:06:32.590> to<00:06:32.710> the<00:06:32.830> story<00:06:33.040> into<00:06:33.610> the<00:06:33.850> player

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:34.090 
important to the story into the player

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:35.430
