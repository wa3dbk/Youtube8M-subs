these are the two communicators that we
were<00:00:14.070> talking<00:00:14.429> about<00:00:14.610> really<00:00:15.389> quickly<00:00:15.809> just

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
were talking about really quickly just

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.390 
were talking about really quickly just
going<00:00:16.109> to<00:00:16.170> run<00:00:16.289> through<00:00:16.470> the<00:00:16.560> features<00:00:16.859> this

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
going to run through the features this

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.010 
going to run through the features this
is<00:00:17.580> the<00:00:17.670> Hallmark<00:00:18.029> ornament<00:00:18.390> from<00:00:18.480> last<00:00:18.750> year

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
is the Hallmark ornament from last year

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.950 
is the Hallmark ornament from last year
this<00:00:19.529> is<00:00:19.680> the<00:00:19.830> playmates<00:00:20.779> communicator<00:00:21.779> from

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
this is the playmates communicator from

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.920 
this is the playmates communicator from
94<00:00:22.920> this<00:00:23.640> one's<00:00:23.880> probably<00:00:24.029> pretty<00:00:24.570> similar<00:00:24.869> to

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
94 this one's probably pretty similar to

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.540 
94 this one's probably pretty similar to
the<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.439> current<00:00:25.710> toy<00:00:25.859> that's<00:00:26.070> out<00:00:26.250> and<00:00:26.490> you

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
the the current toy that's out and you

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.509 
the the current toy that's out and you
can<00:00:26.730> see<00:00:26.910> that<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.240> size<00:00:27.420> difference<00:00:28.519> the

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
can see that the size difference the

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:30.800 
can see that the size difference the
ornaments<00:00:29.910> a<00:00:29.970> little<00:00:30.150> more<00:00:30.240> squared<00:00:30.660> off

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
ornaments a little more squared off

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:31.759 
ornaments a little more squared off
whereas<00:00:31.109> this<00:00:31.170> one<00:00:31.349> has<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.619> more

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
whereas this one has the more

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.090 
whereas this one has the more
traditional<00:00:32.189> kind<00:00:32.369> of<00:00:32.430> fat<00:00:32.700> bottom<00:00:33.210> on<00:00:33.360> it<00:00:34.100> but

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
traditional kind of fat bottom on it but

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.610 
traditional kind of fat bottom on it but
both<00:00:35.250> pretty<00:00:35.489> good<00:00:36.200> where<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.290> ornament

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
both pretty good where the ornament

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.319 
both pretty good where the ornament
really<00:00:37.800> shines<00:00:38.100> is<00:00:38.430> in<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.730> electronics

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
really shines is in the electronics

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.630 
really shines is in the electronics
looks<00:00:40.230> great<00:00:40.500> it's<00:00:40.680> got<00:00:40.770> perforations<00:00:41.280> all

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640

and it kind of blends in with the other

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.319 
and it kind of blends in with the other
holes<00:00:46.649> in<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:46.890> grille<00:00:47.100> just<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.090> show<00:00:48.270> you

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
holes in the grille just to show you

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:49.880 
holes in the grille just to show you

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
of them you have to open it manually but

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.100 
of them you have to open it manually but
it<00:00:51.780> does<00:00:51.930> chirp<00:00:52.199> itself<00:00:53.510> nice<00:00:54.510> bright<00:00:54.840> lights

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
it does chirp itself nice bright lights

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.520 
it does chirp itself nice bright lights
really<00:00:55.680> clear<00:00:55.920> sounds<00:00:56.309> loud<00:00:57.020> just<00:00:58.020> a<00:00:58.109> few<00:00:58.320> here

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
really clear sounds loud just a few here

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:12.289 
really clear sounds loud just a few here
this<00:00:58.800> is<00:00:58.949> all<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.100> Kirk<00:00:59.340> stuff<00:01:11.060> that's<00:01:12.060> just

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
this is all the Kirk stuff that's just

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.000 
this is all the Kirk stuff that's just
some<00:01:12.450> of<00:01:12.540> them<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.780> other<00:01:12.930> button<00:01:13.350> has<00:01:13.530> some

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
some of them the other button has some

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:37.520 
some of them the other button has some
responses<00:01:35.630> so<00:01:36.630> again<00:01:36.810> looks<00:01:37.049> really<00:01:37.140> good

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
responses so again looks really good

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.980 
responses so again looks really good
more<00:01:37.860> pattern<00:01:38.189> doesn't<00:01:38.400> move<00:01:38.700> that<00:01:39.630> probably

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
more pattern doesn't move that probably

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.770 
more pattern doesn't move that probably
a<00:01:40.049> real<00:01:40.200> drain<00:01:40.439> on<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:41.040> button<00:01:41.520> batteries<00:01:41.970> and

a real drain on the button batteries and

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.330 
a real drain on the button batteries and
you<00:01:42.869> have<00:01:43.020> to<00:01:43.110> open<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.439> cover<00:01:43.619> itself<00:01:44.070> but<00:01:44.220> it

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
you have to open the cover itself but it

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.960 
you have to open the cover itself but it
looks<00:01:44.579> great

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
looks great

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.359

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
it's got nice heft to it a little

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:48.530 
it's got nice heft to it a little
battery<00:01:47.640> compartment<00:01:48.119> down<00:01:48.270> there<00:01:48.420> on<00:01:48.509> the

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
battery compartment down there on the

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.649 
battery compartment down there on the
bottom<00:01:48.720> but<00:01:49.590> really<00:01:50.130> nice<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:51.119> playmates

bottom but really nice the playmates
you<00:01:51.810> know<00:01:51.930> it's<00:01:52.049> showing<00:01:52.350> its<00:01:52.470> age<00:01:52.619> very<00:01:53.280> heavy

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.330 
you know it's showing its age very heavy
this<00:01:54.720> one<00:01:54.990> you<00:01:55.560> could<00:01:55.649> probably<00:01:55.829> flip<00:01:56.100> it<00:01:56.219> open

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340

but<00:01:56.549> it's<00:01:56.670> really<00:01:56.790> made<00:01:57.030> to<00:01:57.119> be<00:01:57.210> open<00:01:57.450> with

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630
