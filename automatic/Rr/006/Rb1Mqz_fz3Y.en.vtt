00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:05.930
 hello to all who are my name 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:09.580
 it's sonia I like a lot I teach you 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:09.580
 make an express tie 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:19.060
 Today I'm going to show you a super technique 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:21.970
 simple that you will love it for 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:24.160
 make ties with our fingers and that we 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.259
 are perfect and in a few minutes to 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.390
 we're going to need tape 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:29.949
 centimeter and a half or two centimeters of 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.379
 wide in this case I will work with 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:35.110
 one and a half centimeter tape as 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:36.879
 come I have not cut any measure because 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.820
 we never know what measure we are going to 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:41.949
 need so let's put our 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.989
 hand in this way we will work with 

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:47.860
 these two fingers and we're going to help with 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:51.010
 the thumb we are going to take one more measure or 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:53.199
 less well up and we're going to put 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:56.170
 so the fingers are going to hold with the 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:59.450
 thumb this part of the ribbon below 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:02.540
 let's move the tape from behind 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:05.870
 and now the end is going to happen 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:08.480
 between these two fingers 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.470
 we pass it like this and the tape will remain 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:13.140
 above the thumb 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:17.010
 then we're going to pass the tape through 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:19.200
 on top of this piece here we put it 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:22.560
 well because we're going to go under 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:27.270
 from here and we're going to do that 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:33.090
 holding in this way and passing the 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:35.910
 tape well come I've gone through here of 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.740
 back and has come out here now what 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:43.440
 let's do we can already remove the 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:46.820
 thumb is going to make the knot but that 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.820
 let's stay focused 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.500
 we separated our fingers a little bit and what 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.780
 we are doing is giving jerks of 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.580
 so that we stay in the center does not 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.590
 let's go for a pull because it's going to 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:02.250
 be one side wider than the other 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:05.190
 that we are going to give thus giving pulls that 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.750
 let's see what is left in the whole center and 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.750
 when we see that it is in the center already 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.820
 we can tighten a little bit more and this 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.180
 loop is already practically ready what 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:17.580
 we take out like this we cut the ends 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:20.640
 we burned the ends and that's that easy 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.890
 we have made a perfect simple tie and in 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.720
 few minutes so I hope they have 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.090
