this edge you don't want them to be this
far<00:01:09.390> up<00:01:09.540> because<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.020> quad<00:01:10.229> a<00:01:10.260> lot<00:01:10.470> of<00:01:10.530> trouble

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
far up because the quad a lot of trouble

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.380 
far up because the quad a lot of trouble
sliding<00:01:11.250> to<00:01:11.790> make<00:01:11.939> sure<00:01:12.090> they're<00:01:12.240> on<00:01:12.270> the

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
sliding to make sure they're on the

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.350 
sliding to make sure they're on the
bottom<00:01:12.720> edge<00:01:13.080> of<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.290> card<00:01:13.560> just<00:01:13.650> like<00:01:13.920> that

bottom edge of the card just like that

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.539 
bottom edge of the card just like that
okay<00:01:15.380> then<00:01:16.380> your<00:01:16.500> thumb<00:01:16.710> goes<00:01:16.890> directly

when you grip the card between these two

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.180 
when you grip the card between these two
fingers<00:02:32.970> you<00:02:33.330> want<00:02:33.599> to<00:02:33.690> extend<00:02:34.050> so<00:02:34.739> this<00:02:34.890> card

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
fingers you want to extend so this card

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.640 
fingers you want to extend so this card
is<00:02:35.370> some<00:02:35.700> completely<00:02:36.300> clear<00:02:36.540> because<00:02:36.810> if<00:02:37.470> you

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
is some completely clear because if you

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.729 
is some completely clear because if you
don't<00:02:37.830> do<00:02:37.980> that<00:02:38.160> um<00:02:38.810> it's<00:02:39.810> really<00:02:40.050> slow<00:02:40.470> and

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
don't do that um it's really slow and

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:42.470 
don't do that um it's really slow and
the<00:02:41.190> card<00:02:41.400> doesn't<00:02:41.610> move<00:02:41.819> very<00:02:41.849> quickly<00:02:42.120> so

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
the card doesn't move very quickly so

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.990 
the card doesn't move very quickly so
you<00:02:42.540> need<00:02:42.750> to<00:02:42.870> extend<00:02:43.489> so<00:02:44.489> that<00:02:44.640> the<00:02:44.730> change

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
you need to extend so that the change

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.350 
you need to extend so that the change
happens<00:02:45.360> quickly<00:02:46.640> another<00:02:47.640> thing<00:02:47.910> to<00:02:48.030> know<00:02:48.180> is

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
happens quickly another thing to know is

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.479 
happens quickly another thing to know is
that<00:02:48.390> you<00:02:48.900> want<00:02:49.200> some<00:02:49.590> misdirection<00:02:49.890> so<00:02:50.400> you

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
that you want some misdirection so you

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:53.059 
that you want some misdirection so you
can<00:02:50.610> do<00:02:50.700> that<00:02:50.819> by<00:02:50.940> flicking<00:02:51.360> the<00:02:51.600> card<00:02:51.920> which<00:02:52.920> I

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
can do that by flicking the card which I

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:54.949 
can do that by flicking the card which I
did<00:02:53.220> in<00:02:53.250> my<00:02:53.370> performance<00:02:53.730> because<00:02:54.690> if<00:02:54.840> you

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
did in my performance because if you

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:56.180 
did in my performance because if you
don't<00:02:55.110> have<00:02:55.319> any<00:02:55.530> misdirection<00:02:56.099> the

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
don't have any misdirection the

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.530 
don't have any misdirection the
spectator<00:02:56.700> is<00:02:56.730> just<00:02:56.910> going<00:02:57.030> to<00:02:57.120> look<00:02:57.269> at<00:02:57.420> your

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
spectator is just going to look at your

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.630 
spectator is just going to look at your
hands<00:02:57.930> very<00:02:58.230> carefully<00:02:58.680> and<00:02:58.890> it's<00:02:59.459> quite

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
hands very carefully and it's quite

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.400 
hands very carefully and it's quite
difficult<00:02:59.849> to<00:03:00.120> do<00:03:00.269> the<00:03:00.390> changes<00:03:00.780> I'm<00:03:01.110> seeing

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
difficult to do the changes I'm seeing

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.949 
difficult to do the changes I'm seeing
it<00:03:01.560> without<00:03:01.830> any<00:03:02.160> misdirection<00:03:02.849> so<00:03:03.660> like<00:03:03.840> I

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
it without any misdirection so like I

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.170 
it without any misdirection so like I
said<00:03:04.019> you<00:03:04.739> can<00:03:04.890> flip<00:03:05.190> the<00:03:05.310> card<00:03:05.549> like<00:03:05.670> this<00:03:05.910> and

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
said you can flip the card like this and

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.870 
said you can flip the card like this and
then<00:03:06.450> do<00:03:06.599> the<00:03:06.720> change<00:03:06.989> so<00:03:07.950> in<00:03:08.250> full<00:03:08.430> time<00:03:08.670> it

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
then do the change so in full time it

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.320 
then do the change so in full time it

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
this is the easier alternative you could

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.610 
this is the easier alternative you could
just<00:03:15.299> wave<00:03:15.480> your<00:03:15.690> hand<00:03:15.900> and<00:03:16.140> once<00:03:16.290> your<00:03:16.440> hand

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:31.109 
able to see the card and you also don't

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:32.750 
able to see the card and you also don't
want<00:03:31.319> them<00:03:31.470> on<00:03:31.680> your<00:03:31.859> left<00:03:32.100> or<00:03:32.280> on<00:03:32.430> your<00:03:32.609> right

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
because they can just see the card so

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.309 
because they can just see the card so
that<00:03:35.940> is<00:03:36.090> how<00:03:36.209> you<00:03:36.269> do<00:03:36.450> the<00:03:36.540> snap<00:03:36.780> change<00:03:37.079> and

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:37.319 
that is how you do the snap change and

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:39.769
