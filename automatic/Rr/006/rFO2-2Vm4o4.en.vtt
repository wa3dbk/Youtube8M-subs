00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
about what we are looking at i guess the

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.860 
about what we are looking at i guess the
quad<00:00:50.489> has<00:00:51.110> taken<00:00:52.110> back<00:00:52.410> to<00:00:52.489> traditional<00:00:53.870> the

quad has taken back to traditional the
fact<00:00:55.500> that<00:00:55.590> it's<00:00:55.800> for<00:00:56.370> effects<00:00:56.789> units<00:00:57.239> in<00:00:57.420> a

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
fact that it's for effects units in a

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.770 
fact that it's for effects units in a
KAOSS<00:00:57.870> pad<00:00:57.899> and<00:00:59.090> it<00:01:00.090> gives<00:01:00.390> people<00:01:00.600> the

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
KAOSS pad and it gives people the

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.080 
KAOSS pad and it gives people the
opportunity<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:01.800> really<00:01:02.309> get<00:01:02.640> back<00:01:02.850> into

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
opportunity to really get back into

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.560 
opportunity to really get back into
using<00:01:03.989> effects<00:01:04.409> on<00:01:04.530> their<00:01:05.040> audio<00:01:05.369> input<00:01:05.790> so<00:01:06.390> it

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
using effects on their audio input so it

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.830 
using effects on their audio input so it
means<00:01:06.750> lots<00:01:07.740> more<00:01:08.010> fun<00:01:08.070> lots<00:01:09.060> more<00:01:09.270> hands<00:01:09.720> on

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.500 
means lots more fun lots more hands on
and<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.619> ability<00:01:11.040> to<00:01:11.159> really<00:01:11.549> create<00:01:12.000> some

time coming something new for a an
independent<00:01:28.229> effects<00:01:28.829> unit<00:01:29.250> and<00:01:29.630> we<00:01:30.630> have

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
independent effects unit and we have

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.510 
independent effects unit and we have
seen<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.740> kaoss<00:01:32.189> pad<00:01:32.220> go<00:01:32.670> through<00:01:33.090> a<00:01:33.390> series

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
seen the kaoss pad go through a series

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.490 
seen the kaoss pad go through a series
the<00:01:35.520> one<00:01:35.729> two<00:01:36.000> and<00:01:36.210> three<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:36.540> you<00:01:37.380> know

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
the one two and three and you know

the one two and three and you know
obviously<00:01:37.710> there's<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.310> mini<00:01:38.759> versions<00:01:39.450> and

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
obviously there's the mini versions and

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.020 
obviously there's the mini versions and
then<00:01:40.590> they've<00:01:40.770> got<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:40.979> play<00:01:41.009> also<00:01:41.729> that

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
then they've got the play also that

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.889 
then they've got the play also that
arranged<00:01:42.390> but<00:01:43.170> this<00:01:43.970> is<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.329> first<00:01:45.360> one<00:01:45.780> you

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899

know<00:01:46.020> in<00:01:46.229> a<00:01:46.380> long<00:01:46.590> while<00:01:46.860> that<00:01:47.310> will<00:01:47.460> be<00:01:47.640> a

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
know in a long while that will be a

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.780 
know in a long while that will be a
really<00:01:48.780> really<00:01:49.049> good<00:01:49.350> stand<00:01:50.040> alone<00:01:50.250> and

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
really really good stand alone and

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.590 
really really good stand alone and
independent<00:01:51.659> effects<00:01:52.049> unit<00:01:52.380> for<00:01:52.619> DJ's<00:01:53.360> yeah<00:01:54.360> I

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
independent effects unit for DJ's yeah I

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.719 
independent effects unit for DJ's yeah I
guess<00:01:54.840> it's<00:01:55.020> get<00:01:55.829> getting<00:01:56.280> back<00:01:56.430> to<00:01:56.579> its

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
guess it's get getting back to its

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.660 
guess it's get getting back to its
purest<00:01:57.119> elements<00:01:57.600> where<00:01:57.780> it's<00:01:58.469> just<00:01:58.829> hands-on

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
purest elements where it's just hands-on

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.819 
purest elements where it's just hands-on
effects<00:02:00.119> there's<00:02:00.719> no<00:02:00.840> midi<00:02:01.140> there's<00:02:01.530> none<00:02:01.680> of

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
effects there's no midi there's none of

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.530 
effects there's no midi there's none of
the<00:02:01.890> other<00:02:02.070> stuff<00:02:02.310> on<00:02:02.520> there<00:02:02.759> just<00:02:03.090> get<00:02:03.299> into

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
the other stuff on there just get into

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.319 
the other stuff on there just get into
it<00:02:03.570> right<00:02:03.810> now<00:02:04.740> look<00:02:05.250> there<00:02:05.579> is<00:02:05.790> quite<00:02:06.090> a<00:02:06.119> bit

section<00:02:27.650> means<00:02:27.920> it's<00:02:28.220> actually<00:02:28.580> got<00:02:28.700> for

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
section means it's actually got for

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.090 
section means it's actually got for

phasing<00:02:41.870> effects<00:02:42.250> the<00:02:43.250> third<00:02:43.430> section<00:02:43.730> is

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
phasing effects the third section is

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.120 
phasing effects the third section is
actually<00:02:44.420> filtering<00:02:44.959> type<00:02:45.140> effects<00:02:45.530> low<00:02:45.920> pass

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
actually filtering type effects low pass

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.610 
actually filtering type effects low pass
high<00:02:46.400> pass<00:02:46.670> band<00:02:46.970> pass<00:02:47.270> a<00:02:47.600> jet<00:02:48.080> filter<00:02:48.440> in<00:02:48.590> the

high pass band pass a jet filter in the
pitch<00:02:48.830> shifter<00:02:49.190> and<00:02:49.340> the<00:02:49.970> final<00:02:50.360> one<00:02:50.390> is<00:02:50.630> your

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
pitch shifter and the final one is your

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.350 
pitch shifter and the final one is your
delay<00:02:51.050> effects<00:02:51.530> like<00:02:51.739> the<00:02:52.430> tape<00:02:52.640> echo<00:02:53.000> the

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
delay effects like the tape echo the

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.479 
delay effects like the tape echo the
delays<00:02:53.660> the<00:02:53.900> reverb<00:02:54.290> and<00:02:54.470> my<00:02:54.950> favorite<00:02:55.370> the

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
delays the reverb and my favorite the

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:59.020 
delays the reverb and my favorite the
delay<00:02:55.760> reverb<00:02:56.440> as<00:02:57.440> you'll<00:02:58.370> be<00:02:58.489> able<00:02:58.640> to<00:02:58.850> hear

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
delay reverb as you'll be able to hear

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.030 
delay reverb as you'll be able to hear
from<00:02:59.239> the<00:02:59.450> audio<00:02:59.840> will<00:03:00.260> play<00:03:00.470> a<00:03:00.500> few<00:03:00.770> tricks

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
from the audio will play a few tricks

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.340 
from the audio will play a few tricks
with<00:03:01.310> them<00:03:01.489> and<00:03:01.700> you'll<00:03:02.510> notice<00:03:02.780> that<00:03:03.140> there

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
with them and you'll notice that there

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.949 
with them and you'll notice that there
are<00:03:03.380> actually<00:03:04.130> four<00:03:04.580> freeze<00:03:05.239> buttons<00:03:05.690> one

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959 
are actually four freeze buttons one

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:09.430 
are actually four freeze buttons one
under<00:03:06.290> each<00:03:06.320> effect<00:03:06.770> unit<00:03:07.120> and<00:03:08.120> if<00:03:09.110> we<00:03:09.260> bring

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
under each effect unit and if we bring

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.530 
under each effect unit and if we bring
up<00:03:09.620> some<00:03:09.830> noise<00:03:10.040> there<00:03:10.370> of<00:03:10.820> course<00:03:11.090> we'll<00:03:11.300> have

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
up some noise there of course we'll have

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.630 
up some noise there of course we'll have
covered<00:03:11.959> lights<00:03:12.170> when<00:03:12.560> we<00:03:12.739> put<00:03:13.010> on<00:03:13.190> an<00:03:13.340> effect

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
covered lights when we put on an effect

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.729 
covered lights when we put on an effect
so<00:03:14.239> the<00:03:14.420> first<00:03:14.630> effect<00:03:14.930> I'll<00:03:15.140> just<00:03:15.350> bring<00:03:15.560> in

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
so the first effect I'll just bring in

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:19.150 
so the first effect I'll just bring in
the<00:03:15.950> the<00:03:16.190> reverb<00:03:16.519> looper<00:03:16.970> and<00:03:17.840> it<00:03:18.769> gives<00:03:19.040> you

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
the the reverb looper and it gives you

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.250 
the the reverb looper and it gives you
the<00:03:19.370> ability<00:03:19.459> to<00:03:20.980> play

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
the ability to play

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.920 
the ability to play
with<00:03:24.260> the<00:03:24.410> unit<00:03:24.770> and<00:03:24.980> of<00:03:25.430> course<00:03:25.670> the<00:03:26.510> nice

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
with the unit and of course the nice

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:28.630 
with the unit and of course the nice
thing<00:03:26.960> is<00:03:27.290> you've<00:03:27.620> actually<00:03:27.800> got<00:03:28.130> the<00:03:28.280> effects

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
thing is you've actually got the effects

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.880 
thing is you've actually got the effects
depth<00:03:29.000> so<00:03:29.510> you<00:03:29.630> can<00:03:29.780> actually<00:03:29.900> turn<00:03:30.380> in<00:03:30.650> and

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
depth so you can actually turn in and

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.100 
depth so you can actually turn in and
out<00:03:31.010> the<00:03:31.490> actual<00:03:31.790> effect<00:03:32.240> and<00:03:32.450> keep<00:03:32.900> your

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.110 
out the actual effect and keep your

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.320 
out the actual effect and keep your
original<00:03:33.680> source<00:03:33.980> material<00:03:34.070> running<00:03:35.030> all<00:03:35.180> the

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:35.330 
original source material running all the

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:39.190 
original source material running all the
time<00:03:37.030> so<00:03:38.030> we've<00:03:38.210> got<00:03:38.390> that<00:03:38.420> effect<00:03:38.840> section

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
time so we've got that effect section

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.100 
time so we've got that effect section
number<00:03:39.470> one<00:03:39.650> going<00:03:40.070> I<00:03:40.250> can<00:03:40.640> turn<00:03:40.850> in<00:03:41.090> a<00:03:41.240> flanger

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:42.110 
number one going I can turn in a flanger

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:47.400 
number one going I can turn in a flanger
for<00:03:42.320> example<00:03:43.870> get<00:03:44.870> that<00:03:45.050> into<00:03:45.290> this<00:03:45.460> the<00:03:46.460> myths

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
for example get that into this the myths

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:56.830 
for example get that into this the myths
put<00:03:48.410> on<00:03:48.560> a<00:03:48.860> reverb<00:03:49.490> unit<00:03:49.520> and<00:03:55.390> bring<00:03:56.390> those<00:03:56.540> in

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
put on a reverb unit and bring those in

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.449 
put on a reverb unit and bring those in
and<00:03:56.990> out<00:03:57.080> with<00:03:57.380> the<00:03:57.530> touch<00:03:57.709> of<00:03:57.740> the<00:03:57.920> screen<00:03:58.340> of

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 
and out with the touch of the screen of

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:01.330 
and out with the touch of the screen of
course<00:03:58.700> so<00:03:59.270> you<00:03:59.330> can<00:03:59.630> keep<00:03:59.950> the<00:04:00.950> kaoss<00:04:01.310> pad

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
course so you can keep the kaoss pad

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.590 
course so you can keep the kaoss pad
itself<00:04:02.260> and<00:04:04.030> bring<00:04:05.030> in<00:04:05.150> and<00:04:05.330> out<00:04:05.450> the

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:05.600 
itself and bring in and out the

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.790 
itself and bring in and out the
different<00:04:05.930> effects<00:04:06.170> that<00:04:06.320> are<00:04:06.440> working<00:04:06.680> with

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:08.800 
different effects that are working with

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.940 
different effects that are working with
now<00:04:10.209> the<00:04:11.209> free<00:04:11.510> section<00:04:11.900> allows<00:04:12.380> you<00:04:12.410> to<00:04:12.770> do

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
now the free section allows you to do

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.940 
now the free section allows you to do
things<00:04:13.250> like<00:04:13.580> take<00:04:14.480> out<00:04:14.720> some<00:04:15.380> of<00:04:15.500> the<00:04:15.590> effects

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:15.950 
things like take out some of the effects

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:18.280 
things like take out some of the effects
you're<00:04:16.130> working<00:04:16.489> with<00:04:16.640> and<00:04:17.000> if<00:04:17.720> you<00:04:17.959> actually

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:18.290 
you're working with and if you actually

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:21.640 
you're working with and if you actually
have<00:04:18.799> say<00:04:19.130> just<00:04:19.370> the<00:04:19.430> reverb<00:04:19.880> running<00:04:20.500> you<00:04:21.500> can

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 
have say just the reverb running you can

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:23.200 
have say just the reverb running you can
hear<00:04:21.829> the<00:04:21.950> depth<00:04:22.160> of<00:04:22.280> the<00:04:22.400> river<00:04:22.610> of<00:04:22.790> going

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
hear the depth of the river of going

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:24.680 
hear the depth of the river of going
there

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
there

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:27.110 
there
we<00:04:25.440> wanted<00:04:25.710> to<00:04:25.740> keep<00:04:25.950> that<00:04:26.160> reverb<00:04:26.580> effect<00:04:26.970> on

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
we wanted to keep that reverb effect on

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.550 
we wanted to keep that reverb effect on
all<00:04:27.300> the<00:04:27.420> time<00:04:27.660> we<00:04:27.900> can<00:04:28.050> simply<00:04:28.380> hit<00:04:28.410> the

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
all the time we can simply hit the

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.380 
all the time we can simply hit the
freeze<00:04:28.920> button<00:04:28.950> that's<00:04:29.430> underneath<00:04:29.730> we'll

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:30.390 
freeze button that's underneath we'll

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:31.880 
freeze button that's underneath we'll
get<00:04:30.510> that<00:04:30.690> reverb<00:04:31.140> effect<00:04:31.440> of<00:04:31.560> running<00:04:31.770> all

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:31.890 
get that reverb effect of running all

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:34.370 
get that reverb effect of running all
the<00:04:32.010> time<00:04:32.390> switching<00:04:33.390> it<00:04:33.510> off<00:04:33.630> switching<00:04:34.290> it

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
the time switching it off switching it

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.830 
the time switching it off switching it
back<00:04:34.530> on<00:04:34.740> again<00:04:34.860> keeps<00:04:35.640> that<00:04:35.850> original<00:04:36.450> the

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
back on again keeps that original the

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.600 
back on again keeps that original the
last<00:04:37.080> point<00:04:37.350> that<00:04:37.620> you<00:04:37.740> actually<00:04:37.920> add<00:04:38.340> it<00:04:38.460> on

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
last point that you actually add it on

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:40.850 
last point that you actually add it on
on<00:04:39.330> the<00:04:39.510> pad<00:04:39.690> itself<00:04:39.840> so<00:04:40.500> you<00:04:40.590> can<00:04:40.710> actually

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
on the pad itself so you can actually

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.040 
on the pad itself so you can actually
just<00:04:41.040> keep<00:04:41.340> turning<00:04:41.550> it<00:04:41.790> on<00:04:41.910> and<00:04:41.970> off<00:04:42.150> get

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
just keep turning it on and off get

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:49.190 
just keep turning it on and off get
these<00:04:43.260> combinations<00:04:43.650> going<00:04:46.610> okay<00:04:47.610> so<00:04:47.960> if<00:04:48.960> for

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:49.200 
these combinations going okay so if for

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.140 
these combinations going okay so if for
example<00:04:49.260> I'll<00:04:50.100> get<00:04:50.310> them<00:04:50.430> freeze<00:04:50.730> back<00:04:50.970> on

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
example I'll get them freeze back on

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:52.970 
example I'll get them freeze back on
again<00:04:51.270> so<00:04:51.630> we<00:04:51.720> can<00:04:51.840> hear<00:04:51.990> that<00:04:52.170> fillet<00:04:52.500> reverb

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:52.980 
again so we can hear that fillet reverb

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:57.460 
again so we can hear that fillet reverb
is<00:04:53.160> time<00:04:54.410> we<00:04:55.410> can<00:04:55.560> bring<00:04:55.710> it<00:04:55.830> in<00:04:55.920> now

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:57.470 
is time we can bring it in now

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:00.250 
is time we can bring it in now
and<00:04:57.950> then<00:04:58.070> that<00:04:58.220> delay<00:04:58.840> start<00:04:59.840> adding<00:05:00.020> my

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:00.260 
and then that delay start adding my

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.260 
and then that delay start adding my
favorite<00:05:00.680> combinations<00:05:01.340> like<00:05:01.460> a<00:05:01.610> loop<00:05:01.910> slicer

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:02.270 
favorite combinations like a loop slicer

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:25.060 
favorite combinations like a loop slicer
a<00:05:04.240> flanger<00:05:23.170> remember<00:05:24.170> settings<00:05:24.530> right<00:05:24.800> for

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:25.070 
a flanger remember settings right for

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:27.040 
a flanger remember settings right for
the<00:05:25.160> delay<00:05:25.460> reverb<00:05:25.730> and<00:05:26.540> habits<00:05:26.870> which

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:27.050 
the delay reverb and habits which

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:35.250 
the delay reverb and habits which
stoppages<00:05:27.590> really<00:05:30.490> so<00:05:31.490> we've<00:05:31.640> got<00:05:31.820> the<00:05:31.970> always

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:35.260 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:52.540 

fixed<00:05:36.260> it<00:05:48.250> like<00:05:49.250> that<00:05:51.190> okay<00:05:52.190> and<00:05:52.340> then<00:05:52.430> we'll

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:52.550 
fixed it like that okay and then we'll

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:53.620 
fixed it like that okay and then we'll
bring<00:05:52.700> you<00:05:52.820> something<00:05:53.030> like<00:05:53.330> the<00:05:53.450> pitch

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:53.630 
bring you something like the pitch

00:05:53.630 --> 00:06:02.680 
bring you something like the pitch
shifter<00:05:54.050> and<00:06:00.820> of<00:06:01.820> course<00:06:02.060> while<00:06:02.360> i'm<00:06:02.510> actually

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:02.690 
shifter and of course while i'm actually

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:05.980 
shifter and of course while i'm actually
using<00:06:02.930> the<00:06:03.320> unit<00:06:03.800> I<00:06:03.950> had<00:06:04.280> the<00:06:04.630> contagion<00:06:05.630> p.m.

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:05.990 
using the unit I had the contagion p.m.

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:08.170 
using the unit I had the contagion p.m.
switched<00:06:06.320> on<00:06:06.560> so<00:06:07.100> basically<00:06:07.580> following<00:06:08.000> the

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:08.180 
switched on so basically following the

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:10.300 
switched on so basically following the
musical<00:06:08.660> the<00:06:08.780> time<00:06:08.990> emotion<00:06:09.470> effects<00:06:09.800> as<00:06:10.100> we

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:10.310 
musical the time emotion effects as we

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:23.999 
musical the time emotion effects as we
have<00:06:10.940> time<00:06:11.480> and<00:06:11.690> things<00:06:12.140> passing

00:06:23.999 --> 00:06:24.009 

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:29.200 

presa<00:06:25.389> ducky<00:06:27.009> sound<00:06:28.009> on<00:06:28.220> a<00:06:28.250> constant<00:06:28.789> basis

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:29.210 
presa ducky sound on a constant basis

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:31.270 
presa ducky sound on a constant basis
calling<00:06:29.629> the<00:06:29.750> beat<00:06:29.930> and<00:06:30.470> we<00:06:30.800> can<00:06:30.979> just<00:06:31.099> bring

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:31.280 
calling the beat and we can just bring

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:33.610 
calling the beat and we can just bring
that<00:06:31.340> in<00:06:31.669> and<00:06:31.940> it<00:06:32.419> makes<00:06:32.659> two<00:06:33.050> dissents<00:06:33.470> with

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:33.620 
that in and it makes two dissents with

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:34.960 
that in and it makes two dissents with
something<00:06:33.919> like<00:06:34.069> that<00:06:34.280> if<00:06:34.400> you<00:06:34.490> actually<00:06:34.610> see

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:34.970 
something like that if you actually see

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:38.529 
something like that if you actually see
into<00:06:35.389> the<00:06:35.479> revision<00:06:36.080> so<00:06:36.909> standard<00:06:37.909> reverb<00:06:38.300> or

00:06:38.529 --> 00:06:38.539 
into the revision so standard reverb or

00:06:38.539 --> 00:06:42.779 
into the revision so standard reverb or
delay<00:06:38.599> reverb<00:06:39.259> it<00:06:39.590> definitely<00:06:40.009> made<00:06:40.159> a<00:06:40.190> wish

00:06:42.779 --> 00:06:42.789 

00:06:42.789 --> 00:06:50.800 

and<00:06:43.789> it's<00:06:43.940> following<00:06:44.300> the<00:06:44.539> beat<00:06:48.639> and<00:06:49.810> that's

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:50.810 
and it's following the beat and that's

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:53.290 
and it's following the beat and that's
basically<00:06:51.050> the<00:06:51.440> machine<00:06:51.919> itself<00:06:52.099> got<00:06:52.940> lots<00:06:53.180> of

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:53.300 
basically the machine itself got lots of

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:55.089 
basically the machine itself got lots of
fun<00:06:53.539> functions<00:06:54.110> to<00:06:54.289> work<00:06:54.469> we're<00:06:54.710> discussing

00:06:55.089 --> 00:06:55.099 
fun functions to work we're discussing

00:06:55.099 --> 00:06:57.430 
fun functions to work we're discussing
