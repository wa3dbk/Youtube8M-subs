active debate that's going on seafood is
one<00:00:12.030> of<00:00:12.150> the<00:00:12.240> few<00:00:12.540> food<00:00:13.290> items<00:00:13.679> that<00:00:13.799> really

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
one of the few food items that really

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.060 
one of the few food items that really
has<00:00:14.490> tremendous<00:00:15.299> health<00:00:15.330> benefits<00:00:16.070> but

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
has tremendous health benefits but

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.820 
has tremendous health benefits but
certain<00:00:17.400> compounds<00:00:17.940> can<00:00:18.180> can<00:00:18.869> have<00:00:19.500> certain

certain compounds can can have certain

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.269 
certain compounds can can have certain
we<00:00:20.699> can<00:00:21.390> promote<00:00:21.750> certain<00:00:22.140> risks<00:00:22.619> too<00:00:22.830> as<00:00:23.010> well

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
we can promote certain risks too as well

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.990 
we can promote certain risks too as well
and<00:00:23.640> so<00:00:23.850> what<00:00:24.840> it<00:00:24.990> comes<00:00:25.199> down<00:00:25.470> to<00:00:25.529> in<00:00:26.369> terms<00:00:26.670> of

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
and so what it comes down to in terms of

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.429 
and so what it comes down to in terms of
the<00:00:27.060> regulatory<00:00:28.050> agencies<00:00:28.769> and<00:00:29.420> in

the regulatory agencies and in

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:33.080 
the regulatory agencies and in
scientists<00:00:31.439> is<00:00:31.560> how<00:00:32.189> do<00:00:32.250> you<00:00:32.369> Ben<00:00:32.610> how<00:00:32.880> do<00:00:32.969> you

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
scientists is how do you Ben how do you

scientists is how do you Ben how do you
balance<00:00:33.239> those<00:00:33.630> risks<00:00:34.079> and<00:00:34.200> benefits<00:00:34.969> the

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
balance those risks and benefits the

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.209 
balance those risks and benefits the
some<00:00:36.270> of<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.420> benefits<00:00:36.870> in<00:00:37.140> seafood<00:00:37.920> and

some of the benefits in seafood and
especially<00:00:38.489> in<00:00:38.760> tuna<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.750> very<00:00:40.410> high<00:00:40.590> levels

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.729 
docosahexaenoic acid DHA they have been
shown<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:50.879> reduce<00:00:51.360> coronary<00:00:52.140> heart<00:00:52.199> disease

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
shown to reduce coronary heart disease

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.450 
shown to reduce coronary heart disease
and<00:00:53.250> over<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:53.940> last<00:00:54.230> 15-20<00:00:55.230> years<00:00:55.710> show<00:00:56.160> that

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
and over the last 15-20 years show that

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.670 
and over the last 15-20 years show that
they<00:00:56.670> have<00:00:56.820> a<00:00:56.850> pretty<00:00:57.629> dramatic<00:00:57.840> effect<00:00:58.440> on

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
they have a pretty dramatic effect on

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.709 
they have a pretty dramatic effect on
cognitive<00:00:59.250> development<00:00:59.520> too<00:01:00.329> so<00:01:00.570> the

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
cognitive development too so the

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.560 
cognitive development too so the
important<00:01:01.170> they're<00:01:01.320> important<00:01:01.770> for

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570 
important they're important for

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.179 
important they're important for
expectant<00:01:03.570> mothers<00:01:03.899> and<00:01:04.350> young<00:01:04.470> children<00:01:05.010> in

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
expectant mothers and young children in

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.010 
expectant mothers and young children in
the<00:01:05.220> development<00:01:06.030> of<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.299> nervous<00:01:06.600> system<00:01:06.990> so

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
the development of the nervous system so

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.320 
the development of the nervous system so
you<00:01:07.920> have<00:01:08.130> these<00:01:08.340> really<00:01:08.760> positive

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
you have these really positive

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.660 
you have these really positive
beneficial<00:01:10.260> effects<00:01:10.680> going<00:01:10.950> on<00:01:11.070> at<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.490> same

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
beneficial effects going on at the same

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.880 
beneficial effects going on at the same
time<00:01:11.729> they<00:01:12.540> are<00:01:12.689> asked<00:01:12.869> some<00:01:13.080> potential<00:01:13.560> risks

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
time they are asked some potential risks

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.469 
time they are asked some potential risks
depending<00:01:14.340> on<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.580> levels<00:01:14.909> of<00:01:15.000> mercury<00:01:15.150> in

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
depending on the levels of mercury in

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.620 
depending on the levels of mercury in
the<00:01:15.509> fish<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:16.140> so<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:17.310> FDA<00:01:17.610> came<00:01:18.240> out<00:01:18.420> with<00:01:18.600> a

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
the fish and so the FDA came out with a

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.800 
the fish and so the FDA came out with a
list<00:01:18.990> of<00:01:19.400> fish<00:01:20.400> for<00:01:20.729> it<00:01:20.880> to<00:01:21.060> avoid<00:01:21.390> for

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
list of fish for it to avoid for

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.990 
list of fish for it to avoid for
expecting<00:01:24.409> mothers<00:01:25.409> and<00:01:25.860> also<00:01:26.670> for<00:01:26.850> young

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
expecting mothers and also for young

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.469 
expecting mothers and also for young
children<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.600> that<00:01:27.780> tended<00:01:28.170> to<00:01:28.290> be<00:01:28.439> yeah

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
children and that tended to be yeah

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:31.819 
children and that tended to be yeah
there<00:01:30.479> were<00:01:30.570> four<00:01:30.810> fish<00:01:31.020> that<00:01:31.229> were<00:01:31.320> they<00:01:31.770> were

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
there were four fish that were they were

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.649 
there were four fish that were they were
kind<00:01:32.100> of<00:01:32.189> said<00:01:32.610> they<00:01:32.759> should<00:01:33.000> need<00:01:33.299> such<00:01:33.630> a

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
kind of said they should need such a

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.660 
kind of said they should need such a
swordfish<00:01:34.259> tilefish<00:01:35.630> king<00:01:36.630> mackerel<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:37.670> and

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
swordfish tilefish king mackerel and and

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.630 
swordfish tilefish king mackerel and and
they<00:01:39.150> also<00:01:39.299> with<00:01:39.900> albacore<00:01:40.350> tuna<00:01:40.470> they<00:01:41.159> said

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
they also with albacore tuna they said

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.350 
they also with albacore tuna they said
it<00:01:41.790> has<00:01:42.110> kind<00:01:43.110> of<00:01:43.170> more<00:01:43.530> moderate<00:01:44.040> levels<00:01:44.460> um<00:01:44.850> I

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
it has kind of more moderate levels um I

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.789 
it has kind of more moderate levels um I
think<00:01:45.600> there's<00:01:45.869> like<00:01:46.110> point<00:01:46.409> three<00:01:46.590> seven

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
think there's like point three seven

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.130 
think there's like point three seven
parts<00:01:47.579> per<00:01:47.729> million<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:48.630> that<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:48.930> should

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
parts per million and that you should

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.030 
parts per million and that you should
only<00:01:49.259> be<00:01:49.470> eating<00:01:49.790> six<00:01:50.790> ounces<00:01:51.149> once<00:01:51.689> a<00:01:51.840> week<00:01:52.049> so

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
only be eating six ounces once a week so

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.940 
only be eating six ounces once a week so
with<00:01:53.159> that<00:01:53.340> there<00:01:53.700> was<00:01:53.850> a<00:01:53.880> focus<00:01:54.360> on<00:01:54.509> tuna<00:01:55.140> and

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
with that there was a focus on tuna and

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.240 
with that there was a focus on tuna and
we<00:01:56.579> started<00:01:56.909> out<00:01:57.060> actually<00:01:57.770> looking<00:01:58.770> at<00:01:58.950> again

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
we started out actually looking at again

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.359 
we started out actually looking at again
the<00:01:59.540> West<00:02:00.540> Coast<00:02:00.719> fishery<00:02:01.079> kind<00:02:01.350> of<00:02:01.439> goes<00:02:01.979> them

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
the West Coast fishery kind of goes them

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.609 
the West Coast fishery kind of goes them
really<00:02:03.119> from<00:02:03.299> mid<00:02:03.659> California<00:02:04.290> all<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:04.530> way

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
really from mid California all the way

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.980 
really from mid California all the way
through<00:02:04.950> Oregon<00:02:05.850> and<00:02:06.060> Washington<00:02:06.240> it

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
through Oregon and Washington it

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.050 
through Oregon and Washington it
it's--that's<00:02:07.680> earlier<00:02:08.160> in<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.340> season<00:02:08.550> in

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060

know full bore in the Oregon Washington

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.510 
know full bore in the Oregon Washington
area<00:02:15.360> and<00:02:15.599> we<00:02:16.590> actually<00:02:16.950> first<00:02:17.129> started<00:02:17.190> out

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
area and we actually first started out

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.670 
area and we actually first started out
seeing<00:02:17.879> if<00:02:18.030> there<00:02:18.300> was<00:02:18.420> differences<00:02:19.110> in<00:02:19.470> the

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
seeing if there was differences in the

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.940 
seeing if there was differences in the

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
areas so certain times of the year I

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.770 
areas so certain times of the year I
tend<00:02:25.410> to<00:02:25.440> have<00:02:26.010> higher<00:02:26.430> levels<00:02:26.879> of<00:02:27.120> omega-3s

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
tend to have higher levels of omega-3s

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.270 
tend to have higher levels of omega-3s
in<00:02:28.260> the<00:02:28.379> later<00:02:28.590> part<00:02:28.830> of<00:02:28.860> the<00:02:28.980> year<00:02:29.099> they

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
in the later part of the year they

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.910 
in the later part of the year they
tended<00:02:29.550> to<00:02:29.610> go<00:02:29.819> up<00:02:30.000> higher<00:02:30.480> because<00:02:30.920> the

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
tended to go up higher because the

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.290 
tended to go up higher because the
theory<00:02:32.250> is<00:02:32.400> that<00:02:32.430> they<00:02:32.730> come<00:02:32.879> over<00:02:33.090> to<00:02:33.209> the

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
theory is that they come over to the

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.000 
theory is that they come over to the
west<00:02:33.450> coast<00:02:33.690> to<00:02:33.810> begin<00:02:34.140> the<00:02:34.260> feeding<00:02:34.680> and<00:02:34.890> as

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
west coast to begin the feeding and as

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.320 
west coast to begin the feeding and as
they're<00:02:35.250> going<00:02:35.489> through<00:02:35.610> their<00:02:35.970> feeding

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
they're going through their feeding

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.000 
they're going through their feeding
cycle<00:02:36.569> they<00:02:36.930> didn't<00:02:37.170> have<00:02:37.319> higher<00:02:37.560> higher

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
cycle they didn't have higher higher

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.309 
cycle they didn't have higher higher
lipid<00:02:38.430> levels<00:02:38.819> and<00:02:39.269> then<00:02:39.870> at<00:02:40.019> the<00:02:40.110> same<00:02:40.260> time

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
lipid levels and then at the same time

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:41.720 
lipid levels and then at the same time
we<00:02:40.739> realized<00:02:41.099> this<00:02:41.220> would<00:02:41.400> be<00:02:41.489> a<00:02:41.519> great

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
we realized this would be a great

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.180 
we realized this would be a great
opportunity<00:02:41.970> to<00:02:42.480> look<00:02:42.900> at<00:02:43.170> the<00:02:43.470> mercury

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
opportunity to look at the mercury

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.309 
opportunity to look at the mercury
levels<00:02:44.519> in<00:02:44.790> the<00:02:45.030> fish<00:02:45.269> as<00:02:45.480> wells<00:02:45.750> one<00:02:46.110> of<00:02:46.230> the

levels in the fish as wells one of the
things<00:02:46.500> that<00:02:46.769> struck<00:02:47.370> us<00:02:47.580> was<00:02:48.030> you<00:02:48.720> know

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
things that struck us was you know

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.720 
things that struck us was you know
certainly<00:02:49.140> in<00:02:49.500> terms<00:02:49.739> of<00:02:49.920> mercury<00:02:50.640> is

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
certainly in terms of mercury is

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.940 
certainly in terms of mercury is
oftentimes<00:02:51.120> measured<00:02:51.660> in<00:02:51.900> pots<00:02:52.319> per<00:02:52.620> million

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
oftentimes measured in pots per million

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.000 
oftentimes measured in pots per million
and<00:02:53.190> the<00:02:53.310> FDA<00:02:53.610> has<00:02:53.879> a<00:02:53.910> limit<00:02:54.300> of<00:02:54.709> one<00:02:55.709> part<00:02:55.950> per

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
and the FDA has a limit of one part per

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.059 
and the FDA has a limit of one part per
million<00:02:56.310> per<00:02:56.640> fish<00:02:56.970> and<00:02:57.709> what<00:02:58.709> had<00:02:58.890> been

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069 
million per fish and what had been

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:02.290 
million per fish and what had been
reported<00:02:59.700> with<00:03:00.180> albacore<00:03:00.690> tuna<00:03:00.800> again

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
reported with albacore tuna again

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.210 
reported with albacore tuna again
looking<00:03:03.300> at<00:03:03.450> canned<00:03:03.780> tuna<00:03:04.200> in<00:03:04.530> these<00:03:04.800> tuna

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
looking at canned tuna in these tuna

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.580 
looking at canned tuna in these tuna
usually<00:03:05.670> a<00:03:05.700> much<00:03:06.300> larger<00:03:06.780> in<00:03:06.870> size<00:03:07.050> you<00:03:07.440> know

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
usually a much larger in size you know

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.559 
usually a much larger in size you know
being<00:03:07.800> caught<00:03:08.010> from<00:03:08.129> the<00:03:08.220> South<00:03:08.430> Pacific<00:03:08.610> that

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
being caught from the South Pacific that

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:11.930 
being caught from the South Pacific that
these<00:03:10.170> levels<00:03:10.680> were<00:03:10.800> a<00:03:10.830> lot<00:03:11.069> lower<00:03:11.250> than<00:03:11.640> I

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
these levels were a lot lower than I

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.720 
these levels were a lot lower than I
think<00:03:12.090> the<00:03:12.330> FDA<00:03:12.599> had<00:03:13.050> the<00:03:13.230> canned<00:03:13.920> tuna<00:03:14.129> levels

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
think the FDA had the canned tuna levels

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.750 
think the FDA had the canned tuna levels
at<00:03:14.909> like<00:03:15.150> 0.37<00:03:16.110> parts<00:03:16.409> per<00:03:16.530> million<00:03:16.769> and<00:03:17.129> we

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
at like 0.37 parts per million and we

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.670 
at like 0.37 parts per million and we
were<00:03:17.879> really<00:03:18.209> coming<00:03:18.450> in<00:03:18.900> a<00:03:19.019> range<00:03:19.290> of

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
were really coming in a range of

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.100 
were really coming in a range of
everything<00:03:20.129> from<00:03:20.810> like<00:03:21.810> 0.08<00:03:22.560> to<00:03:23.069> up<00:03:23.280> to<00:03:23.310> maybe

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.110 
everything from like 0.08 to up to maybe

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:29.420 
everything from like 0.08 to up to maybe
0.3<00:03:25.110> with<00:03:25.799> an<00:03:25.920> average<00:03:26.310> of<00:03:26.549> about<00:03:27.110> 0.1<00:03:28.110> to<00:03:28.440> 0.14

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
0.3 with an average of about 0.1 to 0.14

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.210 
0.3 with an average of about 0.1 to 0.14
parts<00:03:29.970> per<00:03:30.120> million<00:03:30.530> mercury<00:03:31.530> in<00:03:31.620> it<00:03:31.739> in<00:03:32.069> the

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
parts per million mercury in it in the

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.979 
parts per million mercury in it in the
tuna<00:03:32.430> so<00:03:32.760> this<00:03:32.909> showed<00:03:33.120> us<00:03:33.330> that<00:03:33.629> the<00:03:33.810> bigger

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
tuna so this showed us that the bigger

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:35.750 
tuna so this showed us that the bigger
the<00:03:34.080> fish<00:03:34.200> the<00:03:34.560> more<00:03:34.769> the<00:03:34.980> more<00:03:35.159> the<00:03:35.340> mercury

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
the fish the more the more the mercury

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.860 
the fish the more the more the mercury
really<00:03:36.390> held<00:03:36.629> true<00:03:37.129> and<00:03:38.129> that<00:03:38.670> these<00:03:39.480> fish

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
really held true and that these fish

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.920 
really held true and that these fish

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
steam the fish get a cook then you pick

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.070 
steam the fish get a cook then you pick
the<00:04:07.260> meat<00:04:07.470> and<00:04:07.769> then<00:04:07.860> you<00:04:07.980> put<00:04:08.189> it<00:04:08.280> in<00:04:08.340> the<00:04:08.519> can

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:09.080 
the meat and then you put it in the can

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:10.750 
the meat and then you put it in the can
and<00:04:09.170> then<00:04:09.800> it<00:04:09.950> goes<00:04:10.130> through<00:04:10.160> a<00:04:10.400> retort

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
and then it goes through a retort

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.990 
and then it goes through a retort
process<00:04:11.360> to<00:04:11.660> process<00:04:12.200> the<00:04:12.860> you<00:04:13.730> know<00:04:13.820> they

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
process to process the you know they

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.110 
process to process the you know they
fish<00:04:14.690> in<00:04:14.900> the<00:04:15.050> in<00:04:15.200> the<00:04:15.320> can<00:04:15.560> itself<00:04:15.950> that<00:04:16.670> tend

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120 
fish in the in the can itself that tend

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.070 
fish in the in the can itself that tend
to<00:04:17.680> bleed<00:04:18.680> off<00:04:18.920> some<00:04:19.220> of<00:04:19.250> the<00:04:19.459> lipids<00:04:19.840> and<00:04:20.840> they

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:21.080 
to bleed off some of the lipids and they

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:22.810 
to bleed off some of the lipids and they
just<00:04:21.290> sort<00:04:21.620> of<00:04:21.709> come<00:04:21.920> to<00:04:21.950> come<00:04:22.250> through<00:04:22.520> the

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
just sort of come to come through the

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:25.300 
just sort of come to come through the
through<00:04:23.570> the<00:04:23.690> muscle<00:04:24.050> and<00:04:24.410> a<00:04:24.710> lot<00:04:24.920> is<00:04:25.070> left

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.310 
through the muscle and a lot is left

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:29.380 
through the muscle and a lot is left
outside<00:04:25.760> the<00:04:26.060> can<00:04:26.450> so<00:04:27.140> where<00:04:27.950> the<00:04:28.240> cannery<00:04:29.240> is

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:29.390 
outside the can so where the cannery is

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:31.750 
outside the can so where the cannery is
off<00:04:29.660> the<00:04:29.960> west<00:04:30.170> coasts<00:04:30.590> they<00:04:31.340> tend<00:04:31.580> to<00:04:31.610> be

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
off the west coasts they tend to be

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.390 
off the west coasts they tend to be
small<00:04:32.030> micro<00:04:32.480> cannery<00:04:32.900> as<00:04:32.960> we<00:04:33.140> call<00:04:33.350> them<00:04:33.470> they

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
small micro cannery as we call them they

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.390 
small micro cannery as we call them they
are<00:04:34.430> just<00:04:35.060> taking<00:04:35.360> the<00:04:35.690> flesh<00:04:36.100> putting<00:04:37.100> it<00:04:37.220> in

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
are just taking the flesh putting it in

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.760 
are just taking the flesh putting it in
the<00:04:37.610> can<00:04:37.850> so<00:04:38.180> it's<00:04:38.330> really<00:04:38.750> only<00:04:38.960> a<00:04:39.080> one<00:04:39.410> cook

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:39.770 
the can so it's really only a one cook

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:42.040 
the can so it's really only a one cook
and<00:04:40.070> so<00:04:40.610> all<00:04:40.760> those<00:04:40.970> great<00:04:41.330> lipids<00:04:41.840> are

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.050 
and so all those great lipids are

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:44.560 
and so all those great lipids are
staying<00:04:42.260> in<00:04:42.410> the<00:04:42.530> can<00:04:42.830> itself<00:04:43.370> and<00:04:43.790> plus

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:44.570 
staying in the can itself and plus

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:46.660 
staying in the can itself and plus
you're<00:04:44.990> not<00:04:45.200> twice<00:04:45.560> cooking<00:04:46.010> the<00:04:46.190> meat<00:04:46.400> and

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:46.670 
you're not twice cooking the meat and

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:48.790 
you're not twice cooking the meat and
it's<00:04:47.090> just<00:04:47.750> really<00:04:47.900> a<00:04:48.020> different<00:04:48.410> tasting

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 
it's just really a different tasting

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.950 
it's just really a different tasting
dish<00:04:49.100> then<00:04:49.400> you<00:04:49.550> have<00:04:49.700> typical<00:04:50.150> canned<00:04:50.540> tunas

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 
dish then you have typical canned tunas

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.920 
dish then you have typical canned tunas
as<00:04:51.260> a<00:04:51.290> as<00:04:51.860> a<00:04:51.980> wonderful<00:04:52.280> taste<00:04:52.610> and<00:04:53.150> has<00:04:53.570> really

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930 
as a as a wonderful taste and has really

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.470 
as a as a wonderful taste and has really
higher<00:04:54.740> concentrations<00:04:55.580> for<00:04:56.000> the<00:04:56.090> most<00:04:56.240> part

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:56.480 
higher concentrations for the most part

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:00.840 
higher concentrations for the most part
of<00:04:56.660> the<00:04:56.870> omega-3<00:04:57.290> fatty<00:04:57.530> acids<00:04:58.300> there's<00:04:59.300> been

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:00.850 
of the omega-3 fatty acids there's been

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:03.520 
of the omega-3 fatty acids there's been
well<00:05:01.850> you<00:05:01.910> know<00:05:02.360> certainly<00:05:02.720> in<00:05:02.810> the<00:05:02.930> in<00:05:03.260> the

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:03.530 
well you know certainly in the in the

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:06.190 
well you know certainly in the in the
started<00:05:04.280> in<00:05:04.370> the<00:05:04.490> 1990s<00:05:04.940> and<00:05:05.690> and<00:05:06.020> then

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:06.200 
started in the 1990s and and then

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.890 
started in the 1990s and and then
through<00:05:06.500> the<00:05:06.650> last<00:05:06.830> decade<00:05:07.310> to<00:05:07.900> really

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:08.900 
through the last decade to really

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.910 
through the last decade to really
contentious<00:05:09.890> debate<00:05:10.250> about<00:05:11.920> seafood

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:12.920 
contentious debate about seafood

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:15.430 
contentious debate about seafood
consumption<00:05:13.340> and<00:05:13.730> and<00:05:14.300> even<00:05:15.050> to<00:05:15.169> the<00:05:15.290> point

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:15.440 
consumption and and even to the point

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:19.990 
consumption and and even to the point
where<00:05:15.770> you<00:05:16.640> know<00:05:16.760> some<00:05:17.060> health<00:05:18.700> advocates<00:05:19.700> say

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.000 
where you know some health advocates say

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.720 
where you know some health advocates say
that<00:05:20.270> once<00:05:20.690> a<00:05:20.900> woman<00:05:21.440> is<00:05:21.500> pregnant<00:05:21.770> you<00:05:22.580> know

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:22.730 
that once a woman is pregnant you know

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:25.210 
that once a woman is pregnant you know
they<00:05:22.880> should<00:05:23.390> not<00:05:23.510> eat<00:05:23.570> seafood<00:05:23.960> because<00:05:24.890> it

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:25.220 
they should not eat seafood because it

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.820 
they should not eat seafood because it
could<00:05:25.340> be<00:05:25.460> cause<00:05:25.669> danger<00:05:26.240> to<00:05:26.480> the<00:05:26.710> to<00:05:27.710> the

could be cause danger to the to the

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:30.520 
could be cause danger to the to the
infant<00:05:28.190> and<00:05:28.490> really<00:05:29.210> the<00:05:29.390> biggest<00:05:29.690> danger<00:05:30.260> is

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:30.530 
infant and really the biggest danger is

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:32.950 
infant and really the biggest danger is
if<00:05:30.890> you<00:05:31.010> do<00:05:31.220> not<00:05:31.250> eat<00:05:31.669> seafood<00:05:31.970> I<00:05:32.390> mean<00:05:32.660> time
