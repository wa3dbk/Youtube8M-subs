now<00:00:18.449> lighting<00:00:18.869> a<00:00:18.960> cigar<00:00:19.109> is<00:00:19.529> very<00:00:20.160> important

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
now lighting a cigar is very important

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.890 
now lighting a cigar is very important
why<00:00:21.350> because<00:00:22.350> it<00:00:22.500> can<00:00:22.680> completely<00:00:23.220> affect<00:00:24.180> the

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
why because it can completely affect the

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.960 
why because it can completely affect the
blend<00:00:25.289> of<00:00:25.470> a<00:00:25.590> cigar<00:00:25.980> and<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.460> flavour<00:00:26.820> of

blend of a cigar and the flavour of
cigar<00:00:27.480> on<00:00:27.720> how<00:00:28.439> you<00:00:28.500> light<00:00:29.099> it

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:29.599 
cigar on how you light it

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:32.749 
cigar on how you light it
for<00:00:30.599> example<00:00:31.199> lighting<00:00:31.890> with<00:00:32.189> a<00:00:32.219> torch

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
for example lighting with a torch

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.100

lighter<00:00:33.120> a<00:00:33.450> torch<00:00:34.140> lighter<00:00:34.500> can<00:00:35.219> get<00:00:35.399> up<00:00:35.550> to

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110 
lighter a torch lighter can get up to

lighter a torch lighter can get up to
2500<00:00:37.110> degrees<00:00:37.940> so<00:00:38.940> I<00:00:38.969> recommend<00:00:39.750> when

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
2500 degrees so I recommend when

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.450 
2500 degrees so I recommend when

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
lighter now a soft flame lighter burns

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.270 
lighter now a soft flame lighter burns
about<00:01:36.030> half<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.840> temperature<00:01:37.350> as<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.619> blue

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
about half the temperature as the blue

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.819 
about half the temperature as the blue
flame<00:01:38.579> lighter<00:01:38.880> so<00:01:39.600> if<00:01:39.720> this<00:01:39.869> flame<00:01:40.200> actually

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
flame lighter so if this flame actually

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.999 
flame lighter so if this flame actually
does<00:01:41.100> touch<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.610> tobacco<00:01:42.000> it's<00:01:42.810> not<00:01:43.110> as<00:01:43.350> big

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
does touch the tobacco it's not as big

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.249 
does touch the tobacco it's not as big
of<00:01:44.100> a<00:01:44.220> deal<00:01:44.430> and<00:01:44.729> won't<00:01:45.030> affect<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.899> tobacco

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
of a deal and won't affect the tobacco

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.920 
of a deal and won't affect the tobacco
as<00:01:46.619> much<00:01:47.009> now<00:01:47.759> I<00:01:47.820> wouldn't<00:01:48.149> keep<00:01:48.299> it<00:01:48.479> there<00:01:48.659> for

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
as much now I wouldn't keep it there for

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.010 
as much now I wouldn't keep it there for
a<00:01:48.960> long<00:01:49.200> time<00:01:49.229> but<00:01:49.829> again<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.220> same<00:01:50.430> principle

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
a long time but again the same principle

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.560 
a long time but again the same principle
toasting<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.380> cigar<00:01:53.210> getting<00:01:54.210> it<00:01:54.329> nice<00:01:54.540> and

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
toasting the cigar getting it nice and

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.870 
toasting the cigar getting it nice and
hot<00:01:55.909> ready<00:01:56.909> for<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.450> flame<00:01:57.780> and<00:01:58.880> then

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
hot ready for the flame and then

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.830 
hot ready for the flame and then
lighting<00:02:00.649> again<00:02:01.649> you<00:02:02.009> want<00:02:02.159> to<00:02:02.250> warm<00:02:02.490> it<00:02:02.640> up<00:02:02.840> so

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
lighting again you want to warm it up so

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.300 
lighting again you want to warm it up so
you<00:02:03.899> get<00:02:04.079> the<00:02:04.229> tobacco<00:02:04.409> used<00:02:05.009> to<00:02:05.189> the

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
you get the tobacco used to the

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.540 
you get the tobacco used to the
temperature<00:02:05.850> and<00:02:06.030> then<00:02:06.869> light<00:02:07.229> now<00:02:08.069> again<00:02:08.369> if

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
temperature and then light now again if

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.180 
temperature and then light now again if
you<00:02:08.580> don't<00:02:08.789> get<00:02:09.030> it<00:02:09.229> completely<00:02:10.229> burning<00:02:10.619> or

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
you don't get it completely burning or

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.760 
you don't get it completely burning or
completely<00:02:11.730> lit<00:02:12.209> any<00:02:12.510> well<00:02:13.080> construct

completely lit any well construct

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.480 
completely lit any well construct
cigar<00:02:14.280> should<00:02:15.120> correct<00:02:15.750> itself<00:02:16.230> if<00:02:16.560> you<00:02:17.220> leave

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
little bit more difficult you want to

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.710 
little bit more difficult you want to
pull<00:03:22.440> that<00:03:22.680> flame<00:03:23.100> up<00:03:23.400> through<00:03:24.060> the<00:03:24.300> cigar

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
pull that flame up through the cigar

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.690

again<00:03:25.470> you<00:03:25.620> never<00:03:25.770> really<00:03:26.130> want<00:03:26.310> to<00:03:26.400> put

again you never really want to put

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.300 
again you never really want to put
direct<00:03:27.240> flames<00:03:27.630> onto<00:03:28.260> the<00:03:28.380> cigar<00:03:28.709> the<00:03:28.740> idea<00:03:29.160> is

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
direct flames onto the cigar the idea is

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.840 
direct flames onto the cigar the idea is
to<00:03:29.490> pull<00:03:29.820> the<00:03:30.030> flame<00:03:30.300> through<00:03:31.260> the<00:03:31.470> cigar<00:03:31.850> and

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
to pull the flame through the cigar and

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.600 
to pull the flame through the cigar and
rotate<00:03:33.570> it<00:03:33.780> to<00:03:33.810> get<00:03:34.200> an<00:03:34.380> even<00:03:34.800> burn<00:03:35.040> throughout

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
rotate it to get an even burn throughout

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.510 
rotate it to get an even burn throughout
again<00:03:36.480> it<00:03:36.660> is<00:03:36.780> important<00:03:37.440> that<00:03:37.740> the<00:03:38.250> whole

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:38.520 
again it is important that the whole

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.820 
again it is important that the whole
circumference<00:03:39.209> of<00:03:39.600> the<00:03:40.230> foot<00:03:40.470> of<00:03:40.590> the<00:03:40.650> cigar
