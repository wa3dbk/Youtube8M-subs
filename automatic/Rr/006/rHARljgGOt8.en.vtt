00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:54.800 
hopefully she's not going to get too

00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:02.500 
hopefully she's not going to get too

so those are the dungeons I'm not going

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:19.960 
so those are the dungeons I'm not going
to<00:04:18.229> show<00:04:18.350> fight<00:04:18.620> and<00:04:19.070> I<00:04:19.310> can<00:04:19.459> show<00:04:19.549> whole<00:04:19.729> fight

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
to show fight and I can show whole fight

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:22.350 
to show fight and I can show whole fight
