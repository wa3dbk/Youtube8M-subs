00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:07.879
 Hi, I'm Alejandra Coghlan and you're in my 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.830
 house that is your house you are going to tell me not 

00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:12.349
 okay, that's not your house 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:14.570
 is that this space never had you 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:16.910
 invited and I just discovered that he's 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:19.550
 amazing that all Thursday super good 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:22.630
 so well this is a part of me 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:25.939
 house that we did not know is like the 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:28.760
 neighbor office that we have and good 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:31.490
 Well welcome to it and today we are going to 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.050
 practically make the last video 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:38.199
 of halloween because we already have it here 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:42.530
 on top and see what's more cute 

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:45.350
 are the little spiders of clean pipes 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:48.019
 truth is that they are very simple 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.119
 they loved it and I think it's something that's going to 

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:53.839
 be very easy and very fun to do 

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:56.479
 at home with your children this idea I 

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:59.150
 gave my niece paola thank you for hello 

00:00:56.479 --> 00:01:01.129
 this incredible I liked it very much and 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:03.589
 Well, I'll share with you how the 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:06.560
 I did good here we are working with 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:08.450
 three clean pipes here I already did 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.689
 like at the center a ball for what 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:15.229
 as the head and I'll put cover 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:17.270
 the third forgive the sixth for here the 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:21.259
 spiders have to be at least 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:23.920
 six legs there are ones of eight then 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:26.920
 This will be bigger than the 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.920
 together 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:34.180
 the important thing is that it accommodates the 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:36.550
 legs then what I did is like 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:40.870
 what to do 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:44.050
 so very marked so look how it looks 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:48.400
 it is very very marked and that is your every 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:51.040
 father and now we are going to mark him the same 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.850
 fold him like the little foot so he 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.880
 stop 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:59.130
 and look 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:03.289
 what is good and what is good for 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.289
 and so let's do all the rest 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:10.200
 this is a good and gigantic spider that 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.230

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.750

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.879
 little eyes of these crazy people that move 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:21.750
 I would see the best and the truth is that 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:24.240

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:39.740

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.740
