them and hold them back so I don't know
both<00:02:03.479> both<00:02:03.750> sides<00:02:04.079> are<00:02:04.200> pretty<00:02:04.409> fun<00:02:04.680> to<00:02:04.799> play

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
both both sides are pretty fun to play

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.039 
both both sides are pretty fun to play
because<00:02:05.399> you<00:02:06.149> know<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.570> elites<00:02:06.840> and<00:02:06.960> the

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
because you know the elites and the

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.660 
because you know the elites and the
Spartans<00:02:07.439> are<00:02:07.590> different<00:02:08.129> in<00:02:08.160> this<00:02:08.280> game<00:02:08.489> now

they have different abilities or at

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.170 
they have different abilities or at

can do the dodge roll which is in my

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:17.179 
can do the dodge roll which is in my
opinion<00:02:14.579> the<00:02:14.879> best<00:02:15.109> ability<00:02:16.109> in<00:02:16.200> the<00:02:16.260> game<00:02:16.469> but

00:02:17.179 --> 00:02:17.189 
opinion the best ability in the game but

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:19.399 
opinion the best ability in the game but
the<00:02:17.310> Spartans<00:02:17.700> get<00:02:17.849> the<00:02:17.969> DMR<00:02:18.390> which<00:02:18.689> is<00:02:19.019> my

00:02:19.399 --> 00:02:19.409 
the Spartans get the DMR which is my

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:23.330 
the Spartans get the DMR which is my
favorite<00:02:19.829> gun<00:02:19.950> in<00:02:20.069> the<00:02:20.129> game<00:02:20.280> but<00:02:21.209> anyway<00:02:22.340> so

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
favorite gun in the game but anyway so

favorite gun in the game but anyway so
there<00:02:23.459> are<00:02:23.640> differences<00:02:24.150> but<00:02:24.900> pretty<00:02:25.469> much

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
there are differences but pretty much

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.380 
there are differences but pretty much
what's<00:02:25.829> happening<00:02:26.280> is<00:02:26.489> the<00:02:26.819> elites<00:02:27.090> trying<00:02:27.329> to

battery station out of two and then it

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:43.849 
battery station out of two and then it
opens<00:02:41.879> up<00:02:42.030> this<00:02:42.239> like<00:02:42.510> an<00:02:42.780> energy<00:02:43.230> computer

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:43.859 
opens up this like an energy computer

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:46.849 
opens up this like an energy computer
core<00:02:44.159> thing<00:02:44.519> and<00:02:45.200> then<00:02:46.200> the<00:02:46.319> elites<00:02:46.590> have<00:02:46.709> to

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:46.859 
core thing and then the elites have to

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:48.470

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
capture that and carry it to like this

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.280 
capture that and carry it to like this

brought<00:03:10.109> into<00:03:10.379> the<00:03:10.620> game<00:03:10.829> so<00:03:11.280> as<00:03:12.060> the<00:03:12.209> map

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:12.389 
brought into the game so as the map

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:14.539 
brought into the game so as the map
progresses<00:03:13.019> so<00:03:13.319> does<00:03:13.500> the<00:03:13.620> equipment<00:03:14.129> you<00:03:14.280> get

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549 
progresses so does the equipment you get

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:17.990 
progresses so does the equipment you get
so<00:03:15.000> the<00:03:15.329> intensity<00:03:15.900> kind<00:03:16.139> of<00:03:16.260> increases<00:03:17.000> which

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
so the intensity kind of increases which

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.759 
so the intensity kind of increases which
is<00:03:18.180> which<00:03:18.569> is<00:03:18.599> a<00:03:18.720> pretty<00:03:18.870> cool<00:03:19.139> idea<00:03:19.319> I<00:03:19.560> like

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
is which is a pretty cool idea I like

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:23.599 
is which is a pretty cool idea I like
that<00:03:21.229> invasions<00:03:22.229> a<00:03:22.319> lot<00:03:22.440> of<00:03:22.530> fun<00:03:22.739> but<00:03:22.769> what<00:03:23.489> is

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:23.609 
that invasions a lot of fun but what is

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:26.119 
that invasions a lot of fun but what is
even<00:03:24.239> more<00:03:24.540> fun<00:03:24.720> than<00:03:25.049> that<00:03:25.229> is<00:03:25.409> the<00:03:25.620> Slayer

00:03:26.119 --> 00:03:26.129 
even more fun than that is the Slayer

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:29.240 
even more fun than that is the Slayer
game<00:03:26.519> type<00:03:26.790> which<00:03:27.540> pits<00:03:28.229> both<00:03:28.560> teams<00:03:28.859> against

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
game type which pits both teams against

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.759 
game type which pits both teams against
each<00:03:29.310> other<00:03:29.519> elites<00:03:29.849> and<00:03:30.000> Spartans<00:03:30.739> for<00:03:31.739> a

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 
points around the map that whatever team

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:42.740 
points around the map that whatever team
captures<00:03:40.799> it<00:03:40.949> will<00:03:41.340> spawn<00:03:41.609> either<00:03:42.030> weapons<00:03:42.569> or

I have to say I do wish that they had

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:00.439 
I have to say I do wish that they had
like<00:03:57.989> 32<00:03:58.829> players<00:03:59.159> in<00:03:59.489> these<00:03:59.609> game<00:03:59.849> types<00:04:00.150> and

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:00.449 
like 32 players in these game types and

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:02.479 
like 32 players in these game types and
make<00:04:00.599> it<00:04:00.720> like<00:04:00.840> 16<00:04:01.319> on<00:04:01.439> 16<00:04:01.949> or<00:04:02.069> something<00:04:02.400> to

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:08.240
