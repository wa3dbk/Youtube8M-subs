00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:11.759
 flip back and re so sit and and 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:12.230
 perform very quickly then it works 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.519
 also 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.519
 safe as previous 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.000
 but once again I want to repeat that for 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.070
 performing these technical actions 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.669
 need a special acrobatic 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.669
 preparations 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:49.350
 here with this simple element 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:55.390
 can be avoided 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:58.690
 you see a broken arm 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.410
 He is trying to lead painful reception 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.930
 bending 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:04.830
 it is the same hand over my shoulder then his 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:07.960
 turn turns 180 degrees 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.920
 flip back and safely 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.920
 out of danger 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:22.240
 see how the pain is performed 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:27.780
 taking the attacker's nail 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:32.280
 over his shoulder stab 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:34.930
 under the left foot between the attacker's legs 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:39.000
 his hand is placed on his shoulder and 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.000
 bent against natural fold 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:52.490
 and this care this position is a turn of 180 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.490
 degrees 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.900
 not 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:02.650
 after the turn is performed 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.650
