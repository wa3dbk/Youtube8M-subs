this is is that you know they started

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.369 
this is is that you know they started
off<00:00:41.370> by<00:00:41.610> showing<00:00:41.790> us<00:00:42.000> a<00:00:42.090> dense<00:00:42.360> area<00:00:42.750> showing

off by showing us a dense area showing

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.529 
off by showing us a dense area showing
us<00:00:43.559> that<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:44.129> biggest<00:00:44.460> city<00:00:44.700> in<00:00:44.789> this

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
us that the biggest city in this

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.330 
us that the biggest city in this
particular<00:00:45.750> world<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:46.649> it<00:00:46.710> looked<00:00:46.860> really

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
particular world and it looked really

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.130 
particular world and it looked really
great<00:00:47.640> it<00:00:47.789> was<00:00:47.879> full<00:00:48.120> of<00:00:48.270> people<00:00:48.719> but<00:00:48.930> it<00:00:49.020> was

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
great it was full of people but it was

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.200 
great it was full of people but it was
also<00:00:49.289> fairly<00:00:49.920> fairly<00:00:50.579> vast<00:00:50.910> you<00:00:51.030> know<00:00:51.120> when

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
also fairly fairly vast you know when

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.819 
also fairly fairly vast you know when
you<00:00:51.300> think<00:00:51.480> of<00:00:51.539> say<00:00:51.840> an<00:00:51.960> elder<00:00:52.230> scrolls<00:00:52.559> City

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829

you think of say an elder scrolls City
you<00:00:53.100> but<00:00:53.250> I<00:00:53.309> still<00:00:53.370> think<00:00:53.730> of<00:00:53.789> something

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
you but I still think of something

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.060 
you but I still think of something
that's<00:00:54.239> sort<00:00:54.899> of<00:00:54.930> regimented<00:00:55.649> looking<00:00:55.949> this

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
that's sort of regimented looking this

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.860 
that's sort of regimented looking this
looks<00:00:56.280> like<00:00:56.370> a<00:00:56.430> place<00:00:56.760> people<00:00:56.969> actually<00:00:57.600> live

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
looks like a place people actually live

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.869 
looks like a place people actually live
where<00:00:58.230> where<00:00:58.710> things<00:00:59.039> aren't<00:00:59.309> lined<00:00:59.670> up

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
where where things aren't lined up

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.700

exactly<00:01:00.120> right<00:01:00.719> and<00:01:00.780> things<00:01:01.230> are<00:01:01.440> kind<00:01:01.649> of

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
exactly right and things are kind of

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.229
