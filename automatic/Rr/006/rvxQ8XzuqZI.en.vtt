shoes you can have it's not seen that it
looks<00:00:39.380> is<00:00:39.800> more<00:00:40.010> complicated<00:00:40.490> in<00:00:40.550> there<00:00:40.760> first

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:41.270 
looks is more complicated in there first

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.390 
looks is more complicated in there first
of<00:00:41.330> all<00:00:41.450> you<00:00:41.660> have<00:00:41.780> to<00:00:41.900> identify<00:00:42.080> what<00:00:42.680> type<00:00:43.160> of

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:43.400 
of all you have to identify what type of

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.090 
of all you have to identify what type of
wearing<00:00:44.060> shoes<00:00:44.600> you<00:00:44.930> normally<00:00:45.230> have<00:00:45.410> came

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100 
wearing shoes you normally have came

wearing shoes you normally have came
classified<00:00:46.760> in<00:00:47.060> three<00:00:47.320> neutral<00:00:48.670> and<00:00:49.670> the

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
classified in three neutral and the

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.690 
classified in three neutral and the
pronate<00:00:50.270> and<00:00:50.739> overpronate<00:00:51.739> what<00:00:52.309> that<00:00:52.489> means

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:52.700 
pronate and overpronate what that means

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.640 
pronate and overpronate what that means
the<00:00:53.270> way<00:00:53.420> you<00:00:53.480> normally<00:00:53.690> step<00:00:54.110> on<00:00:54.320> the<00:00:54.410> floor

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:54.650 
the way you normally step on the floor

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:58.420 
the way you normally step on the floor
so<00:00:55.309> if<00:00:55.610> you<00:00:55.790> step<00:00:56.140> with<00:00:57.140> your<00:00:57.350> foot<00:00:57.800> sliding

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:58.430 
so if you step with your foot sliding

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.720 
so if you step with your foot sliding
climb<00:00:58.820> to<00:00:59.300> inside<00:01:00.110> so<00:01:00.739> you're<00:01:00.950> under<00:01:01.309> pronate

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 
climb to inside so you're under pronate

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:03.670 
climb to inside so you're under pronate
so<00:01:02.270> we<00:01:02.390> step<00:01:02.600> the<00:01:02.629> other<00:01:03.020> way<00:01:03.200> around<00:01:03.500> you

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680 
so we step the other way around you

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.830 
so we step the other way around you
should<00:01:03.739> lift<00:01:04.280> a<00:01:04.400> little<00:01:04.670> bit<00:01:04.759> outside<00:01:05.030> is

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 
should lift a little bit outside is

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.260 
should lift a little bit outside is
overpronate<00:01:06.530> so<00:01:07.070> then<00:01:07.520> make<00:01:07.729> a<00:01:07.759> huge

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
overpronate so then make a huge

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.810 
overpronate so then make a huge
difference<00:01:08.810> on<00:01:09.020> when<00:01:09.650> you<00:01:09.740> buy<00:01:09.920> a<00:01:09.950> trainer<00:01:10.369> for

the front of your toes it's always good
to<00:01:50.840> have<00:01:51.020> a<00:01:51.050> bigger<00:01:51.500> shoe<00:01:51.800> when<00:01:52.039> you're

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:52.160 
to have a bigger shoe when you're

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.490 
to have a bigger shoe when you're
running<00:01:52.330> you'll<00:01:53.330> feel<00:01:53.569> sometimes<00:01:53.780> swallowed

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
running you'll feel sometimes swallowed

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.260 
running you'll feel sometimes swallowed
due<00:01:54.679> to<00:01:54.890> the<00:01:55.190> stress<00:01:55.520> of<00:01:55.700> running<00:01:55.759> or

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
due to the stress of running or

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.600 
due to the stress of running or
cross-training<00:01:56.840> so<00:01:57.470> therefore<00:01:58.039> is<00:01:58.280> not<00:01:58.340> going

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
cross-training so therefore is not going

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.090 
cross-training so therefore is not going
to<00:01:58.670> be<00:01:58.759> too<00:01:58.910> tired<00:01:59.179> and<00:01:59.360> comfortable<00:02:00.100> follow

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
to be too tired and comfortable follow

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.320 
to be too tired and comfortable follow
those<00:02:01.280> steps<00:02:01.520> then<00:02:01.729> you're<00:02:01.850> going<00:02:01.940> to<00:02:02.030> be<00:02:02.119> okay

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.330 
those steps then you're going to be okay

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.200 
those steps then you're going to be okay
take<00:02:03.170> care
