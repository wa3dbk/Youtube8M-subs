00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.249 
play it real and and with your soul and
all<00:02:05.820> that<00:02:05.850> but<00:02:06.240> it<00:02:06.420> is<00:02:06.540> also<00:02:06.780> important<00:02:07.229> to

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
all that but it is also important to

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.619 
all that but it is also important to
develop<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:07.950> craft<00:02:08.910> and<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.179> stay<00:02:09.390> at<00:02:09.539> the

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
develop the craft and the stay at the

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.650 
develop the craft and the stay at the
same<00:02:09.780> time<00:02:10.050> so<00:02:10.580> so<00:02:11.580> it's<00:02:11.730> a<00:02:11.819> it's<00:02:12.150> a<00:02:12.180> balance<00:02:12.510> of

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
same time so so it's a it's a balance of

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.460 
same time so so it's a it's a balance of
the<00:02:12.840> two<00:02:12.989> but

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
the two but

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.320 
the two but
when<00:02:14.010> it's<00:02:14.160> happening<00:02:14.460> by<00:02:14.610> heart<00:02:14.850> you're

together yeah you disagree at times you
agree<00:02:50.640> a<00:02:50.670> time<00:02:50.910> but<00:02:51.090> who's<00:02:51.240> the<00:02:51.330> more<00:02:51.360> dominant

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
agree a time but who's the more dominant

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.960 
agree a time but who's the more dominant
partner<00:02:52.640> well<00:02:53.640> him<00:02:53.910> being<00:02:53.940> the<00:02:54.840> director<00:02:55.140> I

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
partner well him being the director I

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.290 
partner well him being the director I
would<00:02:56.970> say<00:02:57.360> really<00:02:58.260> I<00:02:58.650> would<00:02:59.130> say<00:02:59.160> he<00:03:00.030> ought<00:03:00.270> to

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
would say really I would say he ought to

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.750 
would say really I would say he ought to
be<00:03:00.510> the<00:03:01.290> more<00:03:01.470> dominant<00:03:01.620> one<00:03:01.950> and<00:03:02.100> I<00:03:02.400> think<00:03:02.640> he

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
be the more dominant one and I think he

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.390 
be the more dominant one and I think he
is<00:03:02.880> but<00:03:03.720> is<00:03:03.900> he<00:03:04.080> actually<00:03:04.710> I<00:03:04.950> don't<00:03:05.100> think<00:03:05.280> he

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
is but is he actually I don't think he

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.120 
is but is he actually I don't think he
is<00:03:05.430> but<00:03:06.150> I<00:03:06.270> don't<00:03:06.570> think<00:03:06.840> any<00:03:07.110> one<00:03:07.350> of<00:03:07.410> us

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
is but I don't think any one of us

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.700 
is but I don't think any one of us
dominates<00:03:09.090> the<00:03:09.240> other<00:03:09.390> you<00:03:09.630> know<00:03:09.720> it<00:03:09.900> is<00:03:10.050> it<00:03:10.650> is

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:10.710 
dominates the other you know it is it is

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:13.160 
dominates the other you know it is it is
that<00:03:10.980> it's<00:03:11.460> the<00:03:11.640> truth<00:03:11.850> that<00:03:11.880> wins<00:03:12.240> you<00:03:13.080> know

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
that it's the truth that wins you know

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.830 
that it's the truth that wins you know
if<00:03:13.380> I'm<00:03:13.560> not<00:03:13.710> convinced<00:03:14.130> about<00:03:14.190> a<00:03:14.340> certain

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
if I'm not convinced about a certain

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.580 
if I'm not convinced about a certain
aspect<00:03:15.840> of<00:03:16.110> a<00:03:16.350> scene<00:03:16.680> or<00:03:16.920> whatever<00:03:17.459> and<00:03:18.380> he<00:03:19.380> has

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
aspect of a scene or whatever and he has

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.480 
aspect of a scene or whatever and he has
a<00:03:19.890> thought<00:03:20.580> and<00:03:20.760> I<00:03:20.880> have<00:03:21.209> a<00:03:21.450> different<00:03:22.050> thought

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:22.490 
a thought and I have a different thought

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:26.870 
a thought and I have a different thought
it's<00:03:23.720> the<00:03:24.720> two<00:03:24.900> thoughts<00:03:25.170> that<00:03:26.010> argue

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
it's the two thoughts that argue

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.449 
it's the two thoughts that argue
themselves<00:03:27.420> out<00:03:27.630> and<00:03:27.900> what<00:03:28.680> is<00:03:28.800> left<00:03:29.010> is<00:03:29.280> the

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
themselves out and what is left is the

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:30.949 
themselves out and what is left is the
truth<00:03:29.640> you<00:03:30.060> know<00:03:30.090> and<00:03:30.180> that<00:03:30.450> is<00:03:30.570> what<00:03:30.720> we<00:03:30.840> go

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
truth you know and that is what we go

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:34.960 
truth you know and that is what we go
with<00:03:31.140> them<00:03:31.320> you<00:03:32.040> know<00:03:32.130> because<00:03:33.470> sometimes

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
with them you know because sometimes

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.520 
with them you know because sometimes
arguments<00:03:35.970> reveal<00:03:36.959> a<00:03:37.230> lot<00:03:37.709> of<00:03:38.700> the<00:03:38.970> hidden

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
arguments reveal a lot of the hidden

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.410 
arguments reveal a lot of the hidden
facts<00:03:40.530> you<00:03:41.370> know<00:03:41.490> which<00:03:41.670> which<00:03:41.880> is<00:03:42.090> not

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
facts you know which which is not
