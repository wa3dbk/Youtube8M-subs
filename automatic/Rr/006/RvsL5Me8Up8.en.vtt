 every Sunday and I feel a little 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:30.000
 troubled because there speaks a lot of 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:32.369
 and worship of images in front of the 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.649

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.709

 we just want to introduce you to the 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.520
 that the word of God tells us is not 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.920
 our opinion is the opinion of the church 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.290
 Adventist Church or New TV 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.970
 time really in the sights of truth yes 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.100
 The word of God 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.200
 Thank you for your participation, thank you 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.480
 Your sincerity, teacher. 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.310
 Let's apply the question, my friend, let's go. 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:34.950
 there to that question this dear 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.290
 Catholic brother is very important for 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.890
 we understand it is important to have 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.630
 in mind the meaning of the term holy in the 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.580
 Then I came back to you with a text. 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.210
 which is in the first Corinthians 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:50.520
 chapter versu2 the church of god that 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.400
 is in the sanctuary in sanctification in 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:56.190
 christ jesus called to be saints 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.750
 together with everyone who everywhere 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:01.140
 involves the name of our Lord Jesus 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:04.080
 Christ Lord of them and us and it speaks 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.340
 your greeting realize that paulo calls 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.440
 saints 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.080
 person who is a person who 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:14.450
 believe in Jesus and who is converted and who 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.450
 is in the process of sanctification 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.680
 sanctification is the process through 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:23.030
 What are we becoming each time? 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.110
 more like Christ by acting 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.010
 supernatural spirit of the Holy Spirit in our 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.140
 interior 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:32.099
 and this is a process that leads to life 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:35.280
 the whole then biblically holy is not a 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:39.420
 a person who does not have sins in truth 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:41.879
 paulo calls sinners of saints the 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.769
 first point in understanding that 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:45.750
 catholic church has the holy term 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:48.090
 when referring to an intercessor she 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:51.079
 is not a biblical understanding because 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:53.609
 biblically holy is every sinner 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:57.590
 converted into the process of 

00:02:53.609 --> 00:03:00.109
 covenant and transformation of sanctification 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.760
 another important thing is the following 

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:04.530
 will god support 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:10.049
 first we should not question 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:12.150
 humility and 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:15.420
 sincere way as many brothers and 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:18.329
 Catholics seek God and raise a 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:21.510
 must do is the Catholic brothers 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:23.760
 seek God God has revealed there 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.799
 many of them in various ways 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.169
 then we should not criticize person 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:30.419
 some she only slept for your super 

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:34.709
 creed and even if these children are 

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:36.419
 wrong but the Bible has something to 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:38.700
 to say is to teach the brothers also 

00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:41.540
 Catholics about this 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:46.709
 for example in summary of chapter 20 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:49.109
 we read that it is part of the Ten Commandments 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:51.000
 the do not love images culture for anyone 

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:53.310
 You may think so, but I do not love the 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.370
 Venero is practically the same thing 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.120
 anything that I venerated in the place of 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.730
 God 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.129
 that is becoming my idol the 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.079
 principle since 25 April is also the 

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:06.810
 veneration with certainty 

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:07.650
 then this 20 from verse four 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.590
 like this 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.840
 you will not make any idol 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:15.660
 whether it be a pagan god or the idol in 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.669
 Man form so much no picture 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.720
 anything in the sky on earth in the waters 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:22.229
 underground 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:24.599
 not sue you later telcos them 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:28.250
 you will worship because I am the Lord 

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:31.670
 your god then when we worship 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:34.550
 something in God's place that becomes the 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:35.720
 our idol and be a part of the ten 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:38.590
 commandments 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:41.720
 we do not worship culture images because 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:43.610
 to finish this answer I wanted 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.440
 read to you a text first timóteo 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:48.110
 25 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:51.290
 The text is very clear in saying that 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:55.460
 more than the beloved mother of Jesus has been 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:58.310
 faithful to God the apostles and many others 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:01.550
 people kind god uses in sheet 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:03.950
 How did God use Mother Teresa? 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:06.400
 calcutá for example to soften the 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:08.690
 suffering of this world is not 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.940
 however despite these people 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:14.419
 do good deeds they can not be 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:16.250
 object of worship or worship because 

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:20.270
 according to the first earthquake 25 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:22.640
 only one being can intercede for the 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:26.330
 humanity and volleyball for you this text 

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:28.430
 it is very clear because there is only one God is one 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:31.190
 mediator or does not open possibility 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:31.880
 for more than 11 mediator between god and 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:35.000
 men 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:39.890
 the man christ jesus and why he is the 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:43.970
 unique that has two divine natures and 

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:46.790
 human nature with its human nature 

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:50.270
 he takes us to god with his nature 

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:52.880
 of life he brings God to us and so 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:55.460
 the only one who can intercede for us is 

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:57.919
 Jesus Christ we can say without shadow of 

00:05:55.460 --> 00:06:00.740
 doubts that despite one side to 

00:05:57.919 --> 00:06:03.979
 sincerity with which our dear ones 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:07.340
 catholic brothers venerate certain images 

00:06:03.979 --> 00:06:09.880
 this procedure is not correct in the light of 

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:09.880
 Holy Bible
