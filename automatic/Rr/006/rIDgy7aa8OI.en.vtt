00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.790
 hello must boeing 777 welcome back to the 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:08.400
 this series of economic players 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.340
 once I introduce you to the cheap puc 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.240
 but before I start I have to tell you one 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.250
 thing 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.570
 oh well two things as well as to put me 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.139
 like this video to have others 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.510
 episodes 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.800
 I tell you to comment as always 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.140
 writing below another player 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.380
 that you would like to see in this series 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.779
 but the other thing I have to say is that 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.439
 in the end I decided there's been decided 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.239
 or I will continue this series up 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:37.250
 to the players, however, who will arrive at 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:39.660
 maximum of I don't know a little less than 20 thousand 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:42.390
 so once you get those that 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.460
 it will cost a little more than 15 thousand between 15 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.660
 20 thousand I stop because then it seems to me 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.670
 really too much 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.829
 that is, I don't think you have to find a 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.480
 economic player for players who 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:55.050
 in the end it's not that they cost so much 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.520
 that is, 15,000 can be found at the end 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.190
 and then nothing I remember put me 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.969
 like this video and we can start 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:05.640
 the economic stern is guarin own ad 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.710
 start and I wanted to say that the guarin 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.020
 ingame for the series a creed is one of the 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.850
 then better economic midfielders 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.830
 perino at the excellent price of 2 thousand 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.650
 credits I highly recommend it is 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.119
 fortissimo the fifa 12 and 2 rennes 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.200
 then let's start with the statistics 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:24.600
 main 76 speed bomb against 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.540
 the 79 of guarini therefore a little faster 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.119
 the Colombian plus 3 paragraph 83 of 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.150
 Guarini dribbling instead 81 so here 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.490
 the Frenchman wins the most two 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.560
 the shot instead is exactly equal to 78 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:41.640
 shooting and among other things they are all equipped 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:44.579
 of a very high power which is 89 of 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.640
 stern and even 91 for guarin 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:50.490
 all together with the long shot which is 87 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.399
 of guarin and 88 of clever then a 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.560
 great shot really chosen shooters 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:58.130
 of snipers 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:01.640
 oh well there are those who are not, however, of the bombs 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:05.270
 the defense is 73 aft against 68 of 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:08.450
 guarin bomb pass 79 against 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:11.480
 the 78 of guarin therefore one of difference 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:14.480
 nothing and finally the 88 of physicality 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.200
 that the strong point of Cuba against the 85 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.540
 of guarin 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.790
 then the stars are skill and being 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.790
 weak foot are 44 for von bagh lecce 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:25.010
 34 for guarin so there is a little less 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:29.600
 star and less for the weak foot the 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:33.010
 price instead escapes boxy 42,000 45,000 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:37.100
 playstation 30mm xbox instead healed 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:38.299
 1600 about playstation and about 2000 xbox 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.220
 but now let's go to see the 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:42.620
 in game statistics and then 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.420
 let's take a moment bobba and we can 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.489
 note that among the strong points of guarin 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:50.209
 as we have already said before at 87 of 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:53.870
 longshot the 91 of power pull the 88 of 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:57.860
 force the 84 of aggressiveness and the whole 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:03:01.489
 with 2160 statistics he invented such va 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:04.070
 instead to 2,197 the difference of almost 40 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:05.750
 but we are still at very high levels 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:07.130
 however always remaining in the 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.760
 gain statistics I want you to notice 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:12.799
 as a sheath only a statistic that 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.350
 the marking under 60 then the rest 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:17.989
 it's all orange or green instead boban 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:20.780
 and also because at 63 but with the villa 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:22.790
 youth risked for the 63 statistics 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.829
 where we have the most difference there are 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.750
 own balance and more 13 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:29.299
 difference in favor of guarin la 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:32.959
 precision on free kick 81 of 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:35.569
 guarin against 65 of pogba and marking 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:35.930
 which however does a little shy about all e 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:38.299
 two 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.220
 now you are seeing my first counter 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:41.780
 my final vote on the card 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:44.120
 I still ask you to advise me here 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.410
 under another player to do for the 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.730
 next episode of this series vi 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:48.560
