00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.580
 done says Levy time Iran was lightly 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:11.830
 has 1.7 billion 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:11.830
 the mother 

00:00:20.829 --> 00:00:26.149
 and so if the project traces its tree 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.519
 family 

00:00:26.149 --> 00:00:30.469
 but remember your research should be 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:33.050
 based on actual photos 

00:00:30.469 --> 00:00:35.839
 who would generate her fairy tale by 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:42.680
 that could say that it has goya origin 

00:00:35.839 --> 00:00:43.790
 it is not not the tram ride to work 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.500
 in our tree designs 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:49.719
 family 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:52.670
 I 'm not feeling much, have you? 

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:56.360
 Even you were so good 10 minutes 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:01:02.030
 back I'm not feeling cool either 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:03.920
 say have fun without having any where you 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.540
 You're pretending to be sick not to have 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:11.049
 to do your tree design 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:12.350
 genealogy is not that there is that 

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:16.909
 contained 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:21.079
 my family is just vaguely britain 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:23.750
 so I'm just choosing a destination 

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:26.990
 that I want but that does not mean that 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:29.540
 in fact that is an old tram the 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.940
 plans make choices also he always 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:34.490
 choose to follow tradition and honor their 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.500
 stories and if you know the background of your 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:40.640
 The heart you came from then you need 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:42.799
 tell the world and then creating my 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.650
 Uncle, we're back to this branch of the family. 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:46.580
 and therefore sharing the same 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.320
 name 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.840
 we are not related to the 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.790
 charms of the forest of not the keys 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.799
 of the world's land or even the 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.420
 charms that came from flower charm 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:59.799
 who knew there was so much charm not 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.799
 related to fairy beads 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:06.750
 after my mother was captured by 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.880
 bears she promised it would be a good 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.890
 girl and was sent to live in a 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.290
 magic village where there was already a long 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.540
 line of laila lots was declared 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:19.800
 their community as well as the Queen 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:24.380
 her mother and her grandmother before 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.380
 You say that, same story.
