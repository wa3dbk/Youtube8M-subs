00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.799
 and today is the clock 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:26.990
 her motto free is the newest entry 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:31.010
 the mega line and just shoot this 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:32.860
 they offered because here we start first 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:36.260
 with the function of the plaster on 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:39.110
 the whole thing now has a drum the 10th 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.720
 written and while in six parts without 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:44.510
 problems can already be loaded 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:47.120
 you have to go here with 81 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:50.350
 turn once around the remaining chambers 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.350
 to reach 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:57.800
 curious with the pale by the way in the 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.520
 Once here she was handicraft 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.860
 pull 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:05.470
 the drum is spinning 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.470
 Press a trigger at the front 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.000
 In addition, the plast has a continuous fire 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.220
 function what that means we have to 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.770
 just hold down the trigger 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:19.850
 and then by pressing this 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:22.550
 sky will trigger lever or clamp 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.850
 something she shares without interruption 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:24.850
 fired 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.979
 the disadvantage is a whole function 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:33.259
 however, that the performance is a lot 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:35.570
 lose as little as 30 percent 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:39.020
 instead of just ten meters the balls fly 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:41.330
 only 67 meters, we now go on to 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.520
 evaluation criteria the look is there 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.950
 five stars often confessed the red for 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.649
 really very successful and as with all 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:52.190
 glass in the mega series it is the size 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:54.140
 that makes the difference to the 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.520
 All in all then the whole thing again 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.649
 then reflected in all the 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.050
 could be back for adults now 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:02.149
 Act really super ergonomic 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.940
 are shaped and really are very 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:07.700
 play pleasantly 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:09.860
 sn is five stars and the whole thing 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.959
 in principle it really happens 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.209
 just as I said the handles already very 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:16.310
 feel good 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:18.860
 The loading is relatively easy if synonymous 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.880
 Now everything without problems on the 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.440
 piece can learn 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:25.310
 the swan mechanism, however, really 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:27.230
 very and really fun too 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:30.200
 some American youtubers have to 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.060
 an angel that this distance here 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.310
 strained condition something tight 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.660
 is what maybe for most 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.459
 agree but that depends also 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.280
 really from how to hold the handle 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:42.440
 and in my case is always 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.849
 a little more space because we have to 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.099
 now also assume that we are now 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:47.450
 actually not to play but one 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:48.590
 generally already the bass 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.319
 hold simultaneously 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.420
 there it is actually less a problem 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:54.680
 the performance of the glass that is unfortunately 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.810
 only three stars 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.930
 that is partly because it is now 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:02.959
 the gray trigger version is 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.700
 usually the prints are orange and 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:06.709
 gray color means that the 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.360
 in terms of performance, they are already somewhat slowed down 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:10.579
 which probably most of the time 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.440
 causes weaker wheels 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:13.670
 we use it in germany is it 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.700
 but so we actually 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:19.010
 only the gray deduction back baker 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.720
 versions have that is why the 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.450
 Comparison actually now with the 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.549
 others are completely understandable 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.079
 how to show shock for example 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:29.480
 things much stars from me 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:31.940
 get and the best of the mega 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.549
 line in things performance is still 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:36.139
 the magnus with five stars but what 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:37.850
 means three places in things performance 

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:39.470
 in my case, it is me 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:42.170
 usually with the blaster when i am 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:44.389
 Unpack from ten meters away 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.280
 shoots at a wall and at the wall 

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:48.620
 red wings it was now something of ten 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.489
 Just maybe two of them 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.870
 meet wall 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:52.730
 theoretically one could already be with it now 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.410
 reach the blaster 15 meters or so 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.569
 but I really would have all so 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:58.130
 Anbow but seriously I mean 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:00.410
 who then shoots at his teammates 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:01.069
 the game suitability is four 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:03.980
 stars 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:08.569
 because the whole thing really is a lot 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:10.940
 mood and ten falls the tires that 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:12.170
 really just have little blaster he 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:14.000
 is ultimately always on the 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:15.709
 game rules arrives or 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.459
 the way or what you are worth 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:20.430
 puts and 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:21.930
 with us as we play you can do that 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.880
 really use it very well 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:27.449
 then we have the modding potential and 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:30.240
 Although just for my style and for it 

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:32.789
 It's four star general for me 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:35.340
 always easier if the whole is just 

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:38.669
 actually not running with magazines 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:40.919
 because then something limited 

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:42.389
 I'm on the other side now 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:44.729
 not too many options 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:46.650
 what can grow then but the 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:49.169
 future will show and let's see what 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:51.630
 is federal altfeld here still in size 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:54.860
 so you might compare 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:56.940
 feel how big the whole thing is 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.710
 and he has to say right now 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:01.020
 although it may be here for you now 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:02.789
 now hardly makes a difference but 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:05.250
 In reality , the thing is really a lot 

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:07.259
 violent and therefore is actually 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:09.750
 as with the time of scott if you have the 

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:13.259
 Now with the current comparison we still 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:17.210
 Once again we show one as I said 

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:17.210
 six shots almost 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.169
 Yes 

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:25.920
 yes and that was it again 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:27.690
 like today and do not forget 

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:30.150
 subscribe and also my other videos 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:32.010
 to look at comments also diligently 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:34.770
 because the more the feedback 

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:36.150
 Germany is all the more German 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:38.970
 Maybe I will do videos too 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:41.360
 Hoppe had a lot of fun with it and until 

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:41.360
 next time
