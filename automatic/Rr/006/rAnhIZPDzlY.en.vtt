I<00:00:09.950> said<00:00:10.950> in<00:00:11.010> this<00:00:11.100> video<00:00:11.309> were<00:00:11.760> against

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
I said in this video were against

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.140 
I said in this video were against
talking<00:00:12.750> about<00:00:13.170> the<00:00:13.350> highest<00:00:13.730> common<00:00:14.730> factor

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
talking about the highest common factor

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.470 
talking about the highest common factor
of<00:00:15.900> a<00:00:16.529> set<00:00:16.860> of<00:00:17.070> numbers<00:00:17.310> now<00:00:18.180> there<00:00:18.330> are<00:00:18.450> a

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
of a set of numbers now there are a

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.089 
of a set of numbers now there are a
couple<00:00:18.660> of<00:00:19.110> different<00:00:19.410> ways<00:00:19.529> in<00:00:19.770> which<00:00:19.890> you

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:20.099 
couple of different ways in which you

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:22.820 
couple of different ways in which you
can<00:00:20.220> do<00:00:20.430> this<00:00:20.730> you<00:00:21.720> can<00:00:21.869> either<00:00:21.930> use<00:00:22.200> factor

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
can do this you can either use factor

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.760 
can do this you can either use factor
trees<00:00:23.160> or<00:00:23.580> you<00:00:23.640> can<00:00:24.000> use<00:00:24.180> short<00:00:24.540> division<00:00:25.020> or

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:25.770 
trees or you can use short division or

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.700 
trees or you can use short division or
if<00:00:25.920> you<00:00:25.980> have<00:00:26.160> a<00:00:26.189> look<00:00:26.430> at<00:00:26.580> maths<00:00:27.000> Ratko<00:00:27.990> UK

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
if you have a look at maths Ratko UK

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.830 
if you have a look at maths Ratko UK
that<00:00:29.010> will<00:00:29.220> give<00:00:29.430> you<00:00:29.580> quite<00:00:29.910> a<00:00:29.939> lot<00:00:30.060> of<00:00:30.510> the

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
that will give you quite a lot of the

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.189 
that will give you quite a lot of the
examples<00:00:31.710> of<00:00:32.309> how<00:00:32.550> we<00:00:32.610> do<00:00:33.059> highest<00:00:33.809> common

00:00:34.189 --> 00:00:34.199 
examples of how we do highest common

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:36.439 
examples of how we do highest common
factors<00:00:34.769> and<00:00:35.100> also<00:00:35.519> what<00:00:35.699> therefore<00:00:35.910> they're

00:00:36.439 --> 00:00:36.449 
factors and also what therefore they're

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:38.570 
factors and also what therefore they're
really<00:00:36.750> useful<00:00:37.260> when<00:00:37.710> you're<00:00:37.769> dealing<00:00:38.129> with

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:38.580 
really useful when you're dealing with

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.320 
really useful when you're dealing with
fractions<00:00:39.090> so<00:00:39.840> fractions<00:00:40.589> for

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:41.330 
fractions so fractions for

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.969 
fractions so fractions for
multiplication<00:00:42.330> division<00:00:43.049> and<00:00:43.170> also

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:43.979 
multiplication division and also

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:47.149 
multiplication division and also
equivalent<00:00:44.519> fractions<00:00:45.530> you<00:00:46.530> can<00:00:46.589> also<00:00:46.830> have<00:00:47.129> a

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:47.159 
equivalent fractions you can also have a

00:00:47.159 --> 00:00:49.820 
equivalent fractions you can also have a
look<00:00:47.430> at<00:00:47.549> the<00:00:47.790> channel<00:00:48.239> on<00:00:48.479> YouTube<00:00:49.049> and<00:00:49.379> have

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:49.830 
look at the channel on YouTube and have

look at the channel on YouTube and have
a<00:00:49.860> look<00:00:50.010> at<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.190> playlist<00:00:50.430> on<00:00:51.000> lowest<00:00:51.449> common

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
a look at the playlist on lowest common

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.439 
a look at the playlist on lowest common
multiples<00:00:52.199> and<00:00:52.470> highest<00:00:53.129> common<00:00:53.460> factors<00:00:54.000> and

multiples and highest common factors and

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.000 
multiples and highest common factors and
I<00:00:54.510> hope<00:00:54.690> you<00:00:54.809> find<00:00:54.960> it<00:00:55.110> useful<00:00:55.170> what<00:00:55.890> we're

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
I hope you find it useful what we're

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.609 
I hope you find it useful what we're
going<00:00:56.129> to<00:00:56.159> do<00:00:56.400> is<00:00:56.760> just<00:00:57.570> have<00:00:57.780> a<00:00:57.809> look<00:00:58.080> at<00:00:58.530> a

00:00:58.609 --> 00:00:58.619 
going to do is just have a look at a

00:00:58.619 --> 00:01:00.649 
going to do is just have a look at a
fairly<00:00:58.890> straightforward<00:00:59.339> example<00:01:00.269> of<00:01:00.449> how<00:01:00.600> to

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:00.659 
fairly straightforward example of how to

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:02.649 
fairly straightforward example of how to
work<00:01:00.989> out<00:01:01.290> the<00:01:01.440> highest<00:01:01.589> common<00:01:02.010> factor<00:01:02.040> of

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:02.659 
work out the highest common factor of

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:05.899 
work out the highest common factor of
two<00:01:03.659> numbers<00:01:04.220> so<00:01:05.220> if<00:01:05.460> you<00:01:05.610> think<00:01:05.760> about

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
two numbers so if you think about

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.050 
two numbers so if you think about
highest<00:01:06.720> common<00:01:07.350> factor<00:01:07.560> what<00:01:08.549> we're<00:01:08.729> looking

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
highest common factor what we're looking

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.750 
highest common factor what we're looking
at<00:01:09.240> firstly<00:01:09.990> is<00:01:10.110> finding<00:01:10.530> out<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.799> factors<00:01:11.549> of

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
at firstly is finding out the factors of

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.780 
at firstly is finding out the factors of
the<00:01:12.510> number<00:01:12.690> and<00:01:13.170> then<00:01:13.950> we're<00:01:14.190> looking<00:01:14.340> at<00:01:14.730> the

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
the number and then we're looking at the

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.710 
the number and then we're looking at the
highest<00:01:15.210> number<00:01:15.810> which<00:01:16.170> is<00:01:16.380> common<00:01:16.980> to<00:01:17.460> both

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 
highest number which is common to both

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.950 
highest number which is common to both
okay<00:01:18.720> so<00:01:18.780> as<00:01:19.410> an<00:01:19.590> example<00:01:19.710> then<00:01:20.640> we'll<00:01:21.180> use<00:01:21.630> the

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
okay so as an example then we'll use the

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.870 
okay so as an example then we'll use the
numbers<00:01:22.470> 8<00:01:23.310> and<00:01:24.050> 12<00:01:25.340> okay<00:01:26.340> so<00:01:26.730> if<00:01:26.790> we<00:01:26.850> look

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
numbers 8 and 12 okay so if we look

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.950 
numbers 8 and 12 okay so if we look
first<00:01:27.360> of<00:01:27.510> the<00:01:27.630> factors<00:01:28.470> of<00:01:28.500> 8<00:01:29.130> well<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.660> first

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
first of the factors of 8 well the first

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.490 
first of the factors of 8 well the first
factor<00:01:31.500> is<00:01:31.530> 1<00:01:32.430> because<00:01:32.760> 1<00:01:33.240> will<00:01:33.570> divide<00:01:33.990> into<00:01:34.230> 8

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
factor is 1 because 1 will divide into 8

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.540 
factor is 1 because 1 will divide into 8
eight<00:01:35.370> times<00:01:36.020> the<00:01:37.020> next<00:01:37.200> factor<00:01:37.650> will<00:01:37.830> be<00:01:38.010> 2

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:38.550 
eight times the next factor will be 2

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.440 
eight times the next factor will be 2
because<00:01:39.450> 2<00:01:39.810> will<00:01:39.990> go<00:01:40.140> into<00:01:40.290> 8<00:01:40.560> four<00:01:41.159> times<00:01:41.450> next

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
because 2 will go into 8 four times next

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.840 
because 2 will go into 8 four times next
factor<00:01:42.870> will<00:01:43.050> be<00:01:43.230> 4<00:01:43.620> because<00:01:44.100> it'll<00:01:44.340> go<00:01:44.460> into<00:01:44.700> 8

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
factor will be 4 because it'll go into 8

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.720 
factor will be 4 because it'll go into 8
twice<00:01:45.120> and<00:01:45.600> then<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.200> last<00:01:46.500> factor<00:01:47.130> will<00:01:47.340> be<00:01:47.370> 8

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:47.730 
twice and then the last factor will be 8

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:50.180 
twice and then the last factor will be 8
because<00:01:48.180> it'll<00:01:48.600> go<00:01:48.720> into<00:01:48.930> 8<00:01:49.170> once<00:01:49.440> so<00:01:49.860> notice

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:50.190 
because it'll go into 8 once so notice

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
because it'll go into 8 once so notice
what<00:01:50.640> we've<00:01:50.790> got<00:01:51.000> there<00:01:51.240> is<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:52.070> factors<00:01:53.070> of<00:01:53.400> 8

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
what we've got there is the factors of 8

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.420 
what we've got there is the factors of 8
all<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.690> numbers<00:01:55.290> that<00:01:55.320> will<00:01:55.620> divide<00:01:55.680> neatly

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
all the numbers that will divide neatly

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.830 
all the numbers that will divide neatly
into<00:01:57.210> 8<00:01:57.390> without<00:01:58.229> leaving<00:01:58.500> any<00:01:58.830> remainder

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
into 8 without leaving any remainder

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.899 
into 8 without leaving any remainder
we'll<00:02:00.840> do<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.050> same<00:02:01.229> for<00:02:01.290> 12<00:02:01.740> so<00:02:02.100> we've<00:02:02.250> got<00:02:02.490> 12

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
we'll do the same for 12 so we've got 12

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:08.389 
we'll do the same for 12 so we've got 12
is<00:02:03.180> 1<00:02:03.979> 3<00:02:04.979> will<00:02:05.370> go<00:02:05.610> into<00:02:05.760> 12<00:02:06.320> 4<00:02:07.320> will<00:02:07.620> go<00:02:07.830> into<00:02:08.009> 12

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
is 1 3 will go into 12 4 will go into 12

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.369 
is 1 3 will go into 12 4 will go into 12
6<00:02:09.360> will<00:02:09.629> go<00:02:09.780> that's<00:02:09.959> 12<00:02:10.289> and<00:02:10.670> 12<00:02:11.670> so<00:02:12.569> what<00:02:13.230> we've

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:13.379 
6 will go that's 12 and 12 so what we've

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:15.530 
6 will go that's 12 and 12 so what we've
got<00:02:13.530> there<00:02:13.769> is<00:02:13.950> a<00:02:13.980> list<00:02:14.400> of<00:02:14.610> all<00:02:14.760> the<00:02:14.909> factors

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
got there is a list of all the factors

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.650 
got there is a list of all the factors
of<00:02:15.750> 12<00:02:16.260> when<00:02:16.650> we<00:02:16.740> just<00:02:17.010> look<00:02:17.310> for<00:02:18.000> the<00:02:18.090> highest

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
of 12 when we just look for the highest

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.660 
of 12 when we just look for the highest
common<00:02:19.530> factor

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
common factor

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.540 
common factor
to<00:02:21.030> both<00:02:21.240> of<00:02:21.540> them<00:02:21.750> which<00:02:22.290> happens<00:02:22.770> to<00:02:22.980> be<00:02:23.010> in

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
to both of them which happens to be in

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.020 
to both of them which happens to be in
this<00:02:24.060> particular<00:02:24.420> case<00:02:24.980> for<00:02:25.980> so<00:02:26.489> the<00:02:26.610> highest

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
this particular case for so the highest

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:34.130 
this particular case for so the highest
common<00:02:27.810> factor<00:02:27.840> of<00:02:28.730> 8<00:02:29.730> and<00:02:30.150> 12<00:02:31.110> is<00:02:32.239> 4<00:02:33.239> all<00:02:33.870> right

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
common factor of 8 and 12 is 4 all right

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.309 
common factor of 8 and 12 is 4 all right
so<00:02:34.890> it<00:02:35.280> is<00:02:35.489> a<00:02:35.520> fairly<00:02:35.880> straightforward<00:02:36.360> way<00:02:36.900> of

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
so it is a fairly straightforward way of

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:39.199 
so it is a fairly straightforward way of
doing<00:02:37.620> things<00:02:37.830> but<00:02:37.980> just<00:02:38.310> just<00:02:38.550> take<00:02:38.730> a<00:02:38.790> little

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
doing things but just just take a little

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:41.870 
doing things but just just take a little
while<00:02:39.569> to<00:02:39.900> work<00:02:40.440> through<00:02:40.860> and<00:02:41.069> make<00:02:41.310> sure<00:02:41.640> that

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
while to work through and make sure that

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.640 
while to work through and make sure that
you've<00:02:42.060> got<00:02:42.239> all<00:02:42.569> the<00:02:42.870> list<00:02:43.110> of<00:02:43.350> all<00:02:43.620> the

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
you've got all the list of all the

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.100 
you've got all the list of all the
factors<00:02:44.400> and<00:02:44.730> that<00:02:45.239> can<00:02:45.450> be<00:02:45.569> a<00:02:45.600> little<00:02:45.870> bit

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
factors and that can be a little bit

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.320 
factors and that can be a little bit
tricky<00:02:46.440> which<00:02:47.069> is<00:02:47.250> why<00:02:47.459> really<00:02:47.760> using<00:02:48.269> a

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
tricky which is why really using a

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.120 
tricky which is why really using a
factor<00:02:48.750> tree<00:02:48.900> you're<00:02:49.200> using<00:02:49.380> short<00:02:49.800> division

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
factor tree you're using short division

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.360 
factor tree you're using short division
is<00:02:50.489> a<00:02:51.180> method<00:02:51.810> that<00:02:51.989> is<00:02:52.290> generally<00:02:52.830> taught<00:02:53.069> in

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
is a method that is generally taught in

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.059 
is a method that is generally taught in
schools<00:02:54.110> however<00:02:55.110> for<00:02:55.380> the<00:02:55.440> purposes<00:02:55.800> of<00:02:55.860> this

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
schools however for the purposes of this

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:58.150 
schools however for the purposes of this
video<00:02:56.310> it's<00:02:57.060> a<00:02:57.269> fairly<00:02:57.690> straightforward

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
video it's a fairly straightforward

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.160 
video it's a fairly straightforward
solution<00:02:59.160> that<00:02:59.400> hopefully<00:02:59.970> will<00:03:00.150> be<00:03:00.180> of<00:03:00.540> help

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
solution that hopefully will be of help

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.920 
solution that hopefully will be of help
to<00:03:01.950> you<00:03:02.250> we'll<00:03:03.000> just<00:03:03.030> do<00:03:03.299> one<00:03:03.630> more<00:03:03.660> example

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
to you we'll just do one more example

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.949 
to you we'll just do one more example
and<00:03:04.799> the<00:03:04.950> example<00:03:05.010> I'm<00:03:05.430> going<00:03:05.580> to<00:03:05.670> use<00:03:05.910> is<00:03:06.150> 15

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
and the example I'm going to use is 15

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:13.870 
and the example I'm going to use is 15
and<00:03:08.420> 45<00:03:09.420> so<00:03:10.319> again<00:03:10.680> the<00:03:10.920> factors<00:03:11.640> of<00:03:11.819> 15<00:03:12.420> are<00:03:12.810> 1

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
and 45 so again the factors of 15 are 1

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:23.300 
and 45 so again the factors of 15 are 1
3<00:03:15.530> 5<00:03:16.530> and<00:03:18.350> 15<00:03:19.580> okay<00:03:20.610> the<00:03:20.790> factors<00:03:21.390> of<00:03:21.420> 45<00:03:22.380> are<00:03:22.799> 1

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
3 5 and 15 okay the factors of 45 are 1

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:34.789 
3 5 and 15 okay the factors of 45 are 1
3<00:03:24.829> 5<00:03:26.900> 15<00:03:27.900> and<00:03:30.019> 45<00:03:31.700> ok<00:03:32.700> so<00:03:33.359> again<00:03:33.720> I<00:03:34.140> was<00:03:34.500> funny

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
3 5 15 and 45 ok so again I was funny

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:36.770 
3 5 15 and 45 ok so again I was funny
it's<00:03:35.100> just<00:03:35.130> a<00:03:35.340> little<00:03:35.640> bit<00:03:36.000> tricky<00:03:36.510> there

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
it's just a little bit tricky there

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.440 
it's just a little bit tricky there
because<00:03:37.320> each<00:03:37.530> time<00:03:37.980> I'm<00:03:38.370> having<00:03:38.730> to<00:03:38.910> work<00:03:39.090> out

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
because each time I'm having to work out

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.590 
because each time I'm having to work out
whether<00:03:40.200> the<00:03:40.500> nun<00:03:40.709> will<00:03:40.950> divide<00:03:41.370> exactly<00:03:42.329> in

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600 
whether the nun will divide exactly in

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:49.460 
whether the nun will divide exactly in
to<00:03:43.760> 45<00:03:44.760> so<00:03:47.180> although<00:03:48.180> I<00:03:48.209> can<00:03:48.570> find<00:03:48.930> out<00:03:49.200> the

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
to 45 so although I can find out the

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.580 
to 45 so although I can find out the
highest<00:03:49.829> common<00:03:50.190> factor<00:03:51.019> do<00:03:52.019> please<00:03:52.320> have<00:03:52.560> a

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
highest common factor do please have a

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.849 
highest common factor do please have a
look<00:03:52.829> at<00:03:53.130> the<00:03:53.400> other<00:03:53.940> videos<00:03:54.500> and<00:03:55.500> decide

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:55.859 
look at the other videos and decide

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:57.229 
look at the other videos and decide
yourself<00:03:56.310> which<00:03:56.370> method<00:03:56.910> you're<00:03:56.970> going<00:03:57.030> to

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
yourself which method you're going to

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:59.030 
yourself which method you're going to
use<00:03:57.390> this<00:03:57.840> particular<00:03:58.200> one<00:03:58.590> will<00:03:58.829> work

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
use this particular one will work

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.000 
use this particular one will work
because<00:03:59.640> the<00:03:59.910> highest<00:04:00.060> common<00:04:00.480> factor<00:04:00.510> of<00:04:01.140> 15

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
because the highest common factor of 15

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:09.220 
because the highest common factor of 15
and<00:04:02.900> 45<00:04:03.900> is<00:04:04.290> the<00:04:04.500> highest<00:04:05.069> number<00:04:05.489> which<00:04:06.209> is<00:04:06.799> 15

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
and 45 is the highest number which is 15

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:12.470 
and 45 is the highest number which is 15
ok<00:04:10.230> so<00:04:10.769> both<00:04:11.130> of<00:04:11.190> them<00:04:11.370> will<00:04:11.430> work<00:04:11.700> for<00:04:12.090> you<00:04:12.299> and

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
ok so both of them will work for you and

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.690 
ok so both of them will work for you and
this<00:04:12.540> is<00:04:12.600> a<00:04:13.019> way<00:04:13.290> a<00:04:13.319> method<00:04:13.859> of<00:04:13.980> doing<00:04:14.549> this

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
this is a way a method of doing this

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.390 
this is a way a method of doing this
particular<00:04:14.910> problem<00:04:15.810> if<00:04:16.769> you<00:04:16.859> have<00:04:17.010> a<00:04:17.039> look<00:04:17.190> at
