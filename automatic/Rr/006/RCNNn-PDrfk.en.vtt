00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
up the process I've got some ice here

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:35.960 
up the process I've got some ice here
I'm<00:03:30.750> going<00:03:30.959> to<00:03:31.049> put<00:03:31.260> this<00:03:31.410> over<00:03:31.620> the<00:03:31.920> ice<00:03:34.970> and

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
I'm going to put this over the ice and

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.449 
I'm going to put this over the ice and
then<00:03:36.299> cool<00:03:36.630> this<00:03:36.840> over<00:03:37.470> ice<00:03:37.650> you<00:03:38.100> don't<00:03:38.130> have

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
then cool this over ice you don't have

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:39.979 
then cool this over ice you don't have
to<00:03:38.549> do<00:03:38.670> this<00:03:38.819> you<00:03:38.970> can<00:03:39.150> just<00:03:39.180> leave<00:03:39.750> it<00:03:39.810> out

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
to do this you can just leave it out

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:41.960 
to do this you can just leave it out
okay<00:03:40.620> one<00:03:40.799> more<00:03:40.950> thing<00:03:41.130> is<00:03:41.310> when<00:03:41.579> you<00:03:41.700> leave

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
okay one more thing is when you leave

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.059 
okay one more thing is when you leave
this<00:03:42.239> to<00:03:42.660> cool<00:03:42.690> down<00:03:43.109> at<00:03:43.290> room<00:03:43.319> temperature<00:03:43.950> a

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:44.069 
this to cool down at room temperature a

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:47.960 
this to cool down at room temperature a
small<00:03:45.170> layer<00:03:46.170> forms<00:03:46.739> so<00:03:47.220> you<00:03:47.250> what<00:03:47.609> you<00:03:47.639> can<00:03:47.850> do

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
small layer forms so you what you can do

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.280 
small layer forms so you what you can do
is<00:03:48.060> in<00:03:48.180> between<00:03:48.329> while<00:03:48.690> it<00:03:48.810> is<00:03:48.900> cooling<00:03:49.079> you

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
is in between while it is cooling you

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.099 
is in between while it is cooling you
can<00:03:49.319> just<00:03:49.730> whisk<00:03:50.730> it<00:03:50.880> once<00:03:51.120> or<00:03:51.329> twice<00:03:51.359> so<00:03:51.930> that

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:52.109 
can just whisk it once or twice so that

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:55.580 
can just whisk it once or twice so that
those<00:03:52.769> thick<00:03:53.069> layer<00:03:53.280> won't<00:03:53.639> form<00:03:54.260> see<00:03:55.260> how<00:03:55.410> my

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
those thick layer won't form see how my
