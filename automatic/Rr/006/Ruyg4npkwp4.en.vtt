00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Sharp eyes - Big teeth

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.500
The Upper Cretaceous of North America

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
67 millions of years ago

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
A young Parasaurolophus runs for its life

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:39.500
The forest's thick underbrush provides an excellent hiding place

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
It is pursued by an adult Tyrannosaurus Rex

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
following the trail

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
The nearly 4 meter high colossus is hungry

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
but has lost sight of its prey for a moment

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.800
The young Hadrosaurs colour blends in with the vegetation

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.100
camouflaging it from predators

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.000
But the T-Rex's eyes are sharp

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.500
This gives him a decisive edge in the hunt

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.500
His view is directed straight-forward

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
so his fields of vision overlap and create a three dimensional view

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.500
Both eyes see the prey from slightly different angles

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.000
resulting in a stereoscopic vision

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
The seemingly undetectable Parasaurolopus

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.400
is spatially separated from the background

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.200
and is uncovered

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Heavy shaking breaks its neck quickly

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Worn and damaged teeth may stick to the flesh

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
and break off

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
The T-Rex is not affected by the loss

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
And it has a reason why

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.000
Within both jaws new teeth are already growing

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.900
For every lost tooth

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.000
a new one erups within a few days

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.000
The lost tooth stays at the scenery

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.800
It will be found 67 million years later by humans

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:51.000
A testament of events that took place here at a time before memory
