00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.480
 you are in the lead 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:36.280
 Talk about who's talking half a kilo. 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:38.710
 and welcome everyone to another video 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.450
 of 10m and today bringing gameplay 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.370
 playing the multiplayer mode 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:44.710
 you are already seeing several videos of 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:47.290
 destinations on the channel but playing mode 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.690
 cooperatively campaign right I 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:52.210
 I ended up arriving at level 20 with the 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:56.970
 character who is the hunter is on the level 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:01:00.310
 21 actually jumping for 22 more 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:02.050
 but I kind of gave you insured now 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:03.760
 Because I want to play the holder of this 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.950
 game is just the cooperative mode 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.869
 I feel sick for even though the game is very cool. 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.890
 but it ends up getting a little sick 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:11.619
 multiplayer a little situation 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.540
 different and I'm enjoying it a lot 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:15.490
 There is one thing that 's annoying me. 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.280
 A little but I want to play more to have 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.970
 really sure is this or not then 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.740
 I'd rather not comment on anything goes way 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.160
 negative for the time being in relation to the game 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.930
 huh 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.610
 in multiplayer campaign mode 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.899
 I'll bring a request later to 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.850
 you are beauty 

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:33.010
 but anyway this is a game playing there 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.299
 with the character in hunter 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:36.850
 You know that we have three 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:38.979
 characters that the titan the hunter and the 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.810
 arcane that my character here it is 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:44.080
 hunter only the way I went up class 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:46.000
 So that's a kind of stab that you 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.720
 You can give your opponents in class 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.299
 main 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.430
 You have a super pistol at this school. 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:53.470
 It has three shots and then you can dealt 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.600
 the shots on opponents every shot 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.290
 it is basically indefensible to get caught up in the 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.479
 enemy 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:00.909
 already the stab a little more complicated 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:02.890
 however it is easier for you to use 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:05.770
 because it's basically like it's 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:08.019
 with the command of the stab 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.030
 hunter is face she pull goes on top of 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:13.180
 opponent then it's quite easy for you 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:16.239
 get them right and I'll finish 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.980
 playing a lot though you always have 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:20.920
 that making the short confrontation is not 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.720
 already with the pistol you always shoot of 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.660
 far but the two options are cool 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.130
 it really is up to you to adapt or 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.739
 choose what is most interesting 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:32.799
 I confess to you that stabbing I 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:34.840
 I think it's more stylish because it gives 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:38.080
 for you to kill more guys in a space 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.410
 less time but the pistol is also 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.150
 cool 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.430
 only what I really wanted to talk about 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.680
 with you there it is about that gun that I am 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:50.180
 playing face looks at the name of the weapon 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:52.670
 platinum whisper of face this is very 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.920
 cool, I ended up burning a rifle 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.680
 automatic during campaign mode 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.600
 and I could not do it any more 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.200
 got a good automatic rifle for 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.030
 play 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.610
 I do not know if you ever play or not anymore 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.260
 the people who played must know that 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.090
 the best weapons are the weapons 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.430
 to play the 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:13.010
 destiny multiplayer that was with a 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.570
 drive rifle guess fled drive 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.690
 trees that were the pulse of 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:19.760
 reality and I was also 15 with 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:22.370
 weapons that were not automatic 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.470
 And then I have hair that gets a rifle. 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.930
 automatic that this whispered platinum 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.340
 he's really cool, cool, refuses 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.820
 it's very weak 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:34.160
 It ends up killing well but year destiny 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:36.170
 you have the option to evolve your weapon 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.240
 Are you going to play with her as you? 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:41.030
 go playing killing you're going 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:42.050
 gaining new skills and one of these 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.690
 skills 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:47.090
 the handsome one here did what simply 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:50.150
 I went to the tvs without reading because I have this 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.810
 I got caught and I'm already going there and active 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.820
 ready 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:55.850
 only that what happened one of these 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:59.630
 abilities made my gun she 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:01.880
 decrease the fire pace of her or 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:04.250
 when you're holding the crosshair it gives 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:07.070
 a more cadenced shot you can see 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:09.709
 her uncle is more cadenced, okay that's 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:12.739
 cool it's cool though when you're in 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:14.450
 short confrontation pulled the crossbar she too 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:17.150
 will keep getting milk the fire 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:19.010
 I ended up giving my 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:21.230
 single automatic rifle 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:23.390
 but there are some caveats that I can 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:25.640
 put in that half time with this weapon 

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:27.680
 because when I'm away from you 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:29.120
 pulling the sights is beauty if you think 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.490
 total you can kill the guys 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.200
 calm does not lose much shot at 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:35.330
 accuracy of her shot very well and 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:37.970
 her calm cadence is not like 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:41.270
 if it was a single shot rifle she got a 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:43.280
 lesser interval between one shot and another 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:45.710
 this in a way legal another 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:48.710
 something that is also not in some way 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:50.600
 played out that gun is because 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:52.370
 When I'm going to make a fire riff 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.410
 she takes shape 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:58.220
 fast again, that is the ability 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:05:00.139
 I put it just figured in case it 's just 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:03.440
 left her more cadenced when I 

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:06.080
 I pull the aim to put it on top of the 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:08.240
 my opponent, in the end, fighting 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:10.160
 medium and long distance tea sight and 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:13.010
 then the team gets more cadenced fighting 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:15.350
 short rip fire she dumps shot to 

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:17.180
 Damn it works fine. 

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:19.040
 stabbing with a punch in the 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:21.470
 face in fact now every one of my here 

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:22.940
 The next time I did not see it, I ended up dying. 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:24.889
 but anyway it's just a small observation 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:26.720
 I wanted to talk to you so I would 

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:28.250
 you have 10 playing do not know you yet 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:30.949
 will buy 10 ine 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:33.080
 be very careful when you are 

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:35.900
 release the skills of weapons because 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:38.060
 you may simply be spoiling the 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:40.610
 your weapon beauty and face automatic rifle 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:41.960
 good at least for me it's a rare thing 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:44.539
 very difficult to see an automatic rifle 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:46.970
 well the only one that came was the one after 

00:05:44.539 --> 00:05:48.830
 lots of hours playing and I 

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:51.169
 I ended up doing this little detail but 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:53.449
 taking this is very calm combat 

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:54.949
 short will have a beauty and combat of 

00:05:53.449 --> 00:05:56.060
 medium to long distance will you 

00:05:54.949 --> 00:05:57.470
 accustom 

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:59.660
 to stay with that shot a little more 

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:01.580
 good cadence that I wanted to talk to 

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:04.130
 you were there in today's video about 

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:05.840
 this gun on that little detail 

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:08.210
 I want to see if I bring more videos of 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:09.440
 multiplayer mode he's cool 

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:11.630
 As I told you, they have a small 

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:13.520
 Little problem but I think you already understand. 

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:14.900
 how does the game scheme work and 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.669
 once you understand this match too 

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:18.560
 Bring it to you to give my 

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:21.080
 opinion and leave you more 

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:22.400
 of this small situation beauty people 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:24.289
 Then six of you have enjoyed it. 

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:27.080
 From today's video the match ended 

00:06:24.289 --> 00:06:29.990
 here thank you very much for the company of 

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:32.560
 You'll see each other in the next video. 

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:32.560
 bye Bye
