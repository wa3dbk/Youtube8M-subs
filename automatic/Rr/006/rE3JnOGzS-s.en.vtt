00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:05.790
 hello that such friends now I'm going to 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:09.349
 talk a little more about a 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.670
 trot recommendation for street or 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:15.630
 for 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:18.930
 marlon words that are like hybrids 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.150
 that can be used to scrub and tobago 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:26.120
 well slides but also for tricks of 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:31.190
 normal skate street those are the see 

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:33.800
 see polar tail bears pones is a line 

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:37.580
 more or less new relatively new 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:39.550
 see that it's a standard touch with the 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:41.920
 kingpin back 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.410
 and this is because they are made to be 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.960
 big or louis to be a little bit more 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:53.140
 light is the trick that classic standard 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:57.000
 for for texas and this skateboarding can not 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:58.910
 be used for example as the barbarian 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.360
 Hello 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:06.730
 ripoll which is a little bit more 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:10.080
 you guys can even use 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:12.670
 for example the take job 2013 with trox 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.730
 this one that I have here is the trick 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:21.790
 standard for for skate has a 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:24.280
 measure 155 millimeters but this same 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.930
 180 model comes in different sizes 180 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.040
 millimeters for maybe a longboard 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:31.810
 wider than about 10 inches wide 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:35.670
 comes shorter maybe for a deck 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:38.310
 moscow type mini cruise something like that 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.890
 then one can choose different 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:44.490
 options I liked the design because it's 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.939
 very very well done is cast 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:51.750
 I like that this can be 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:53.270
 used this for either longboard shows 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.060
 cakes 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.960
 and it comes well reinforced to avoid 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.740
 that double 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:04.110
 comes light and looks a lot then this 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:08.100
 I also liked its finishes for 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:11.069
 example in the part of lg when one 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:16.190
 put the rim on the wheel and put the 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:20.910
 nut does not come off too much 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:23.730
 lg the lapse comes out like this and they are exposed to 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:27.180
 that is hit when it falls badly if it does not come 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:30.120
 well made to order to tighten 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:32.660
 the thread and stay so little then 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:36.090
 I really liked the finish that 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:38.310
 that they gave to this clash 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.430
 and then I recommend it a lot if 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.620
 they want this to be a little lighter 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.080
 maybe not so much turn not so much to fall 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.690
 good but yes as for walking 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.840
 in the city and not to walk so heavy and 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:54.510
 as well 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.709
 The rocks you see are a little bit taller 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.409
 so if you want a feeling a 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:01.769
 little bit closer to the ground what 

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:05.390
 I recommend the polar bears are not for 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:08.459
 great speeds are unstable but 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:12.349
 for medium and low speed they are very 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:12.349
 good then I recommend them
