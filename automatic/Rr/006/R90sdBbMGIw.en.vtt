00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:05.430
 ah 

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:09.430
 many of you ask us how 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.680
 it can be contour if my face is 

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:13.600
 round good those tips we're going to 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:16.500
 apply you're going to see some very techniques 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.500
 easy I hope it serves you 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:27.289
 how to make a contour for a face 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.450
 Round shape in this type of face is 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:31.759
 what is scarce are the angles is what 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:34.309
 we have to highlight first we're going 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:36.260
 to define in the face of marisol the 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:38.930
 cheekbones we will also define the 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.730
 jaw and we will also define a 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.920
 little the front of products I'm going to 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:47.420
 use I will use the palette of 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:49.790
 outline of anastasia is the incredible 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.920
 is that it is powder then it lasts a lot 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:55.300
 more time applied is much easier 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:57.550
 the technique is very very soft 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:00.579
 let's choose the right tone for the 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.960
 marisol skin tone very close to 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:04.000
 face this way we should 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.770
 choose the color this time will 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.080
 use the tone of the medium that is a 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.750
 tone more ash and that in the camera or in 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:13.530
 the photography is going to make my face 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.450
 be much more defined 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.280
 the tool that I'm going to use is 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.280
 this brush is number 49 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:25.020
 the way we will identify 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:27.880
 the cheekbones of the sun is simply 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.799
 touching the cavity 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.509
 palpating a bit in the middle of the 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:33.969
 jaw and it's the way I'm going to 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:36.190
 identify where it is and where I'm going to 

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:38.510
 do the control 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:41.840
 I'm going to do it in circular movements 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:44.140
 from the forward and forward 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.140
 above 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:49.280
 I love this color because it is very, very 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:51.680
 natural 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.000
 it's like those times when they hit us sun 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.070
 in the top part that starts at 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.830
 color your face and start to come out 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.240
 the natural forms of the bones is the 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.740
 way you go with this palette 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.220
 of the contour 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:08.979
 I will use the same color starting 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.979
 from Marisol's ear forward 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.820
 and down 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.650
 this to define a lot more your 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.830
 jaw and lengthen a little more your 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.830
 neck 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.650
 the movements are constant towards 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:27.750
 forward and backward that not to leave 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:29.850
 edges and leave darker areas 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.350
 if they continue in this way the technique is going to 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.340
 be very easy the result is going to be very 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.340
 pleasant for the ions 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:40.020
 the texture is very soft this is very very 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.420
 light the grinding of the shadows is very 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.970
 subtle then you can work it for 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.450
 layers so that the product reaches the 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.940
 color you need 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.709
 the same thing I will do on the fronts and their 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.840
 front is very small like marisol's 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:57.910
 you do not have to color in the end 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:00.120
 just get to the hair root 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.940
 and color it a bit 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.770
 with this same color we could 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.840
 thin your nose a little 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:09.450
 let's touch the tip a little 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.700
 remember it remember the matte colors 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.050
 and dark will give us depth and 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.120
 the colors that are clear whether 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.770
 luminous or matt will give us volume 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.960
 Well what we are going to do next 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:20.970
 let's apply in the highest areas 

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:22.590
 of the face more sun a little color 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.870
 clear to give volume and more 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.660
 definition to the face I'm going to use this 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:30.890
 Illuminator that is safe collection 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.890
 I'm going to make a small triangle 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.810
 This product has a little color 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.820
 peach will help us correct 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:43.570
 also if there is any imperfection in the 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:45.530
 Skin and we will brighten the 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:47.390
 finish is matte 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.980
 and who is and says what is going to 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.410
 absorb fat area and then there 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.810
 is going to stir the luminous finish of 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:56.709
 a cheek that looks like fat 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.709
 or skin speed 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:01.519
 It will highlight our cheekbones very well 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:08.730
 always defined cheekbones can 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:11.130
 fight the world I feel that with a 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.840
 smile with that sexy touch that they have 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:16.280
 women can conquer 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:18.380
 perfectly any objective 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.570
 ok this is the same thing I'm going to do in this 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:23.200
 part of the jaw we're going to highlight 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:23.200
 a little 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:32.390
 if we also wanted a little in their 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:37.510
 chin and on top of those 

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:37.510
 lips a little on the wall of the nose 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:49.610
 and now what we are going to do is apply 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:52.250
 a bit of blogging when we have a skin 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:53.720
 fat we get a dry skin to my 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:56.300

 it's very natural resembles a lot to the 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:05.750
 Face texture and color is super 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.790
 natural if they see the sun's cheekbones and 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:09.980
 they are super defined in case of no 

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:13.940
 know how to highlight it simply smile 

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:15.880
 a little casaol and color moss on the 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:17.800

 It is a very good option 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:32.849
 and we are joining the luminosity the 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:36.530
 contour and blues at the same time 

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:36.530
 giving a super natural finish 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:42.820
 we can work it by layers and the 

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.740
 moment when this product dries 

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:46.990
 there is a powder texture then it is 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:48.760
 long-lasting do not mix with 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:50.540
 the fat of the skin and gives a finish 

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:53.570
 super natural 

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:55.550

 since her skin seems to touch her because 

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:12.360

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:21.280
