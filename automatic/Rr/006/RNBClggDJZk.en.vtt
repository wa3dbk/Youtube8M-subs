00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
you can see that almost both sides are

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.139 
you can see that almost both sides are
even<00:01:42.520> and<00:01:42.990> then<00:01:43.990> before<00:01:44.920> I<00:01:45.490> go<00:01:45.729> to<00:01:45.789> the<00:01:45.969> next

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:46.149 
even and then before I go to the next

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:49.349 
even and then before I go to the next
step<00:01:46.509> you<00:01:47.409> have<00:01:47.439> to<00:01:47.619> take<00:01:47.799> two<00:01:48.429> hot<00:01:48.700> pins<00:01:49.030> and

00:01:49.349 --> 00:01:49.359 
step you have to take two hot pins and

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:53.819 
step you have to take two hot pins and
pin<00:01:50.350> it<00:01:50.560> near<00:01:51.219> the<00:01:51.429> jaw<00:01:52.359> area<00:01:52.689> on<00:01:53.350> the<00:01:53.590> side

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:53.829 
pin it near the jaw area on the side

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:56.340 
pin it near the jaw area on the side
it's<00:01:54.520> better<00:01:54.759> to<00:01:54.909> pin<00:01:55.119> it<00:01:55.210> inside<00:01:55.780> to<00:01:55.990> the<00:01:56.109> so

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
it's better to pin it inside to the so

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.109 
it's better to pin it inside to the so
that<00:01:56.560> it<00:01:56.649> doesn't<00:01:56.979> show<00:01:57.219> I<00:01:57.490> mean<00:01:57.909> you<00:01:58.030> don't

00:01:58.109 --> 00:01:58.119 
that it doesn't show I mean you don't

00:01:58.119 --> 00:01:59.940 
that it doesn't show I mean you don't
want<00:01:58.329> the<00:01:58.509> Frankenstein<00:01:59.200> thing<00:01:59.499> going<00:01:59.829> on

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.340 
anyway
but<00:02:01.829> so<00:02:02.829> that<00:02:03.009> I've<00:02:03.299> put<00:02:04.299> another<00:02:04.539> pin<00:02:05.109> on<00:02:05.259> the

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
but so that I've put another pin on the

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.400 
but so that I've put another pin on the
other<00:02:05.380> side<00:02:05.590> okay<00:02:06.460> so<00:02:07.390> the<00:02:07.509> next<00:02:07.840> step<00:02:08.080> is<00:02:08.259> to

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
other side okay so the next step is to

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.790 
other side okay so the next step is to
bring<00:02:08.590> the<00:02:08.800> shorter<00:02:09.190> side<00:02:10.590> over<00:02:11.590> it's<00:02:11.680> the

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
bring the shorter side over it's the

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.470 
bring the shorter side over it's the
longer<00:02:12.130> side<00:02:12.340> you<00:02:12.550> want<00:02:12.730> one<00:02:12.940> side<00:02:13.240> to<00:02:13.450> be

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
longer side you want one side to be

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.880 
longer side you want one side to be
slightly<00:02:14.290> longer<00:02:14.530> than

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
slightly longer than

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.440 
slightly longer than
the<00:02:14.950> other<00:02:15.100> and<00:02:15.700> you'll<00:02:15.880> see<00:02:16.060> how<00:02:16.240> it<00:02:16.330> becomes

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
the other and you'll see how it becomes

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.680 
the other and you'll see how it becomes
important<00:02:17.140> in<00:02:17.200> the<00:02:17.290> next<00:02:17.560> step<00:02:18.360> so<00:02:19.360> see<00:02:19.510> how

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
important in the next step so see how

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.949 
important in the next step so see how
two<00:02:20.440> sides<00:02:20.770> both<00:02:21.550> sides<00:02:21.819> are<00:02:22.000> now<00:02:22.330> on<00:02:22.510> one<00:02:22.660> side

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
two sides both sides are now on one side

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:26.190 
two sides both sides are now on one side
so<00:02:23.800> the<00:02:23.950> next<00:02:24.190> step<00:02:24.490> is<00:02:24.700> you<00:02:25.600> can<00:02:25.750> try<00:02:25.930> it<00:02:25.990> one

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
so the next step is you can try it one

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:33.560 
so the next step is you can try it one
way<00:02:26.380> by<00:02:26.740> tying<00:02:27.190> it<00:02:27.430> into<00:02:27.610> a<00:02:27.760> loose<00:02:28.150> knot<00:02:31.560> if

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
way by tying it into a loose knot if

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:44.059 
way by tying it into a loose knot if
this<00:02:34.570> loose<00:02:34.930> loose<00:02:35.410> loose

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:46.759
