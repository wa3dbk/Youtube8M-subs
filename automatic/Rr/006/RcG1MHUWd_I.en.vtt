00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 you are one of the most extreme types 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.609
 sports downhill downhill on 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.560
 cycling discipline is active 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.000
 developing around the world with us 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.620
 sportsmen still had to 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.820
 where to train now 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.280
 the situation has changed 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.049
 tells Xenia Borodkina denis 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.210
 the novel has been active for two years 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.400
 downhill am this sport has not opened 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.410
 for myself, by chance once, we saw how 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.930
 athletes ride and immediately moved to 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.880
 normal on a professional bike with 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.660
 friends just rode through the forest saw 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.099
 routes decided to ride but there already 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:37.079
 looked like normal riders 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:38.969
 ride well and decided to do this business 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.059
 in principle it is very interesting and 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:44.340
 Arrange exciting relatively recently 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.280
 season only this season is not very not 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:51.600
 success got hurt 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.760
 broke a bike and that season started on 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.809
 there were prizes for everyone 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.280
 were also there and came to that came also 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.879
 started watching 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.309
 tightened bought a bike myself better 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.150
 before that, young people trained 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.580
 yourself in the yard 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.380
 obstacles were curbs and curbs to 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.060
 improve their skills they decided 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.810
 organize a real track by 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.030
 downhill 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.340
 gathered everyone and on their own 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.869
 took the equipment initiative 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.549
 the guys decided to support the local 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.310
 social activists and deputies of the city 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.790
 Board in the competition and we have to 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.920
 yard 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.170
 there is such an urban competition 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.750
 youth policy 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.579
 various youth initiatives this either 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.920
 a set of activities either specifically 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.710
 some kind of activity so we guys 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.799
 supported because otherwise it turns out 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:42.600
 did they do it right then 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:46.079
 safe or elements for it to be 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.450
 Firstly, zone r1 is permitted here . 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.729
 forests and is it possible to do here we 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.009
 appealed to the downhill forestry this 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.540
 extreme racing discipline essence 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.180
 which is downhill 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.829
 from the mountain on a mountain bike I'm typical 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.810
 downhill trail represents 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.759
 the alternation of steep descents sharp 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.009
 turns of protruding stones and roots 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.439
 trees sometimes builds more complex 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.539
 obstacles in the form of backers and drops 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:12.010
 among athlete's speed on the track 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.629
 about twenty five kilometers per hour 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.540
 this time, and it made for beginners 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:17.409
 riders but even here there are pits and bumps 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.450
 and slides 

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:21.599
 it is made specifically to 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.620
 complicate the route 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:25.989
 the length of the track turned out 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.700
 more than 700 meters novice riders 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:30.220
 decided to try it right away 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.409
 organized the first competition now 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.760
 They will take place here on a regular basis but rather 

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:35.860
 the track will continue 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:39.720
 perfect blue borodkin
