there<00:05:41.199> is<00:05:41.380> a<00:05:41.409> little<00:05:41.710> bit<00:05:41.889> of<00:05:42.009> a<00:05:42.099> of<00:05:42.370> a<00:05:42.520> of<00:05:42.909> a<00:05:43.300> pay

get that you know the airship pass
however<00:05:49.810> I<00:05:50.470> do<00:05:50.860> think<00:05:51.190> that<00:05:51.669> it<00:05:51.909> is<00:05:52.030> also

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:52.240 
however I do think that it is also

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:55.170 
however I do think that it is also
reasonable<00:05:52.840> to<00:05:52.960> say<00:05:53.169> look<00:05:53.770> this<00:05:54.460> vigil<00:05:54.880> area

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:55.180 
reasonable to say look this vigil area

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.360 
reasonable to say look this vigil area
gives<00:05:55.479> you<00:05:55.599> like<00:05:55.780> 95<00:05:56.590> percent<00:05:56.620> of<00:05:57.039> the<00:05:57.159> stuff

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:57.370 
gives you like 95 percent of the stuff

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:59.460 
gives you like 95 percent of the stuff
that<00:05:57.550> you<00:05:57.729> need<00:05:57.970> including<00:05:58.900> the<00:05:58.930> portals<00:05:59.349> to

00:06:53.279 --> 00:06:53.289 
the same conveniences that used to have

00:06:53.289 --> 00:06:54.899 
the same conveniences that used to have
is<00:06:53.409> it<00:06:53.529> a<00:06:53.589> little<00:06:53.799> bit<00:06:53.889> less<00:06:54.069> convenient<00:06:54.399> yes
