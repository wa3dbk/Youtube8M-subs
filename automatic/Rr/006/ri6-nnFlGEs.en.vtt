00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:58.979 
so it's a large house as you've seen
from<00:03:57.069> the<00:03:57.370> outside<00:03:57.510> here<00:03:58.510> are<00:03:58.630> some<00:03:58.810> of<00:03:58.870> the

00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:58.989 
from the outside here are some of the

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:00.750 
from the outside here are some of the
rooms<00:03:59.200> okay<00:03:59.650> there's<00:03:59.860> paper<00:04:00.099> hanging<00:04:00.370> off<00:04:00.610> the

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.809 
rooms okay there's paper hanging off the
wall<00:04:00.940> and<00:04:01.830> it<00:04:02.830> doesn't<00:04:03.099> look<00:04:03.190> its<00:04:03.370> best<00:04:03.580> of

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:03.819 
wall and it doesn't look its best of

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:06.570 
wall and it doesn't look its best of
course<00:04:04.090> there's<00:04:04.900> no<00:04:05.080> pipe<00:04:05.680> work<00:04:06.010> internally

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:06.580 
course there's no pipe work internally

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:09.360 
course there's no pipe work internally
so<00:04:07.000> the<00:04:07.120> water<00:04:07.330> system<00:04:07.599> isn't<00:04:08.349> working<00:04:08.500> no

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
so the water system isn't working no

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.090 
so the water system isn't working no
