when<00:00:08.160> you're<00:00:08.280> working<00:00:08.550> on<00:00:08.610> your<00:00:08.760> project<00:00:09.240> and

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
when you're working on your project and

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.780 
when you're working on your project and
it's<00:00:09.480> time<00:00:09.750> to<00:00:09.960> join<00:00:10.170> a<00:00:10.469> new<00:00:10.769> ball<00:00:11.040> of<00:00:11.070> yarn<00:00:11.250> you

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
it's time to join a new ball of yarn you

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.150 
it's time to join a new ball of yarn you
have<00:00:12.210> a<00:00:12.420> few<00:00:12.809> different<00:00:13.080> options<00:00:13.170> for<00:00:13.769> which

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
have a few different options for which

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.129 
have a few different options for which
way<00:00:14.639> you<00:00:14.700> want<00:00:15.210> to<00:00:15.299> join<00:00:15.570> the<00:00:15.750> new<00:00:15.900> ball<00:00:16.109> of

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
way you want to join the new ball of

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.189 
way you want to join the new ball of
yarn<00:00:16.320> and<00:00:16.910> the<00:00:17.910> method<00:00:18.240> that<00:00:18.270> you<00:00:18.449> choose<00:00:18.750> will

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
yarn and the method that you choose will

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.439 
yarn and the method that you choose will
depend<00:00:19.380> on<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:20.490> project<00:00:20.939> you're<00:00:21.060> working<00:00:21.090> on

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
depend on the project you're working on

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.750 
depend on the project you're working on
the<00:00:21.660> fiber<00:00:21.900> type<00:00:22.199> that<00:00:22.410> you're<00:00:22.529> using<00:00:22.740> in<00:00:23.519> this

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
the fiber type that you're using in this

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.939 
the fiber type that you're using in this
video<00:00:24.090> I'm<00:00:24.359> going<00:00:24.600> to<00:00:24.689> demonstrate<00:00:24.949> four

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
video I'm going to demonstrate four

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.679 
video I'm going to demonstrate four
different<00:00:26.250> ways<00:00:26.369> of<00:00:26.699> joining<00:00:26.939> a<00:00:27.240> new<00:00:27.449> ball<00:00:27.660> of

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
different ways of joining a new ball of

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.000 
different ways of joining a new ball of
yarn<00:00:27.840> well<00:00:28.289> I'm<00:00:28.380> actually<00:00:28.529> not<00:00:28.740> going<00:00:28.949> to

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
yarn well I'm actually not going to

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.500 
yarn well I'm actually not going to
demonstrate<00:00:29.189> them<00:00:29.699> I'm<00:00:29.939> going<00:00:30.210> to<00:00:30.300> talk<00:00:30.480> about

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
demonstrate them I'm going to talk about

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.840 
demonstrate them I'm going to talk about
the<00:00:30.900> differences<00:00:31.439> between<00:00:31.500> them<00:00:32.219> and<00:00:32.430> give

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
the differences between them and give

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.760 
the differences between them and give
you<00:00:33.000> links<00:00:33.239> to<00:00:33.660> my<00:00:33.809> videos<00:00:34.170> that<00:00:34.410> show<00:00:34.620> you<00:00:34.680> how

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
you links to my videos that show you how

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.090 
you links to my videos that show you how
to<00:00:34.980> do<00:00:35.880> this<00:00:36.059> specific<00:00:36.540> join<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.320> we're<00:00:37.950> going

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
to do this specific join and we're going

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.240 
to do this specific join and we're going
to<00:00:38.129> talk<00:00:38.280> about<00:00:39.110> when<00:00:40.110> you<00:00:40.350> want<00:00:40.590> to<00:00:40.680> use<00:00:40.950> each

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
to talk about when you want to use each

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.090 
to talk about when you want to use each
one<00:00:41.550> and<00:00:41.850> how<00:00:42.270> one<00:00:42.600> looks<00:00:43.140> different<00:00:43.350> from<00:00:44.010> the

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
one and how one looks different from the

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:50.110 
one and how one looks different from the
other<00:00:44.579> let's<00:00:45.300> go<00:00:45.450> ahead<00:00:45.539> and<00:00:45.719> take<00:00:45.809> a<00:00:45.840> look

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.029 

these<00:00:51.120> joins<00:00:51.570> all<00:00:51.899> work<00:00:52.199> whether<00:00:52.530> you<00:00:52.829> are

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
these joins all work whether you are

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.369 
these joins all work whether you are
staying<00:00:53.730> in<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.000> same<00:00:54.030> color<00:00:54.480> or<00:00:54.780> changing

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
staying in the same color or changing

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.520 
staying in the same color or changing
color<00:00:56.570> changed<00:00:57.570> color<00:00:57.780> in<00:00:57.960> each<00:00:58.109> one<00:00:58.320> of<00:00:58.440> my

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
color changed color in each one of my

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.639 
color changed color in each one of my
samples<00:00:59.010> to<00:00:59.399> make<00:00:59.579> it<00:00:59.699> clear<00:01:00.170> exactly<00:01:01.170> where<00:01:01.379> I

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
samples to make it clear exactly where I

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.910 
samples to make it clear exactly where I
changed<00:01:02.399> to<00:01:02.940> a<00:01:02.969> new<00:01:03.180> ball<00:01:03.390> of<00:01:03.420> yarn<00:01:03.619> this<00:01:04.619> first

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
changed to a new ball of yarn this first

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.250 
changed to a new ball of yarn this first
one<00:01:05.159> is<00:01:05.430> spit<00:01:06.060> splicing<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:06.869> I'll<00:01:06.930> give<00:01:07.110> you<00:01:07.229> a

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
one is spit splicing and I'll give you a

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.990 
one is spit splicing and I'll give you a
link<00:01:07.500> here<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:07.950> spit<00:01:08.280> splicing<00:01:08.580> video

link here to the spit splicing video

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.530 
link here to the spit splicing video
it's<00:01:09.659> actually<00:01:10.080> a<00:01:10.229> way<00:01:10.500> of<00:01:10.530> felting<00:01:11.360> the<00:01:12.360> old

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
it's actually a way of felting the old

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.780 
it's actually a way of felting the old
ball<00:01:12.750> of<00:01:12.840> yarn<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.619> new<00:01:13.920> ball<00:01:14.130> of<00:01:14.159> yarn<00:01:14.310> and

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
ball of yarn to the new ball of yarn and

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.240 
ball of yarn to the new ball of yarn and
you<00:01:15.720> don't<00:01:16.049> want<00:01:16.320> to<00:01:16.470> use<00:01:16.680> this<00:01:16.920> if<00:01:17.100> you're

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
you don't want to use this if you're

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.590 
you don't want to use this if you're
working<00:01:17.430> stripes<00:01:17.880> it's<00:01:18.180> only<00:01:18.420> if<00:01:18.479> you're

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
working stripes it's only if you're

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.870 
working stripes it's only if you're
staying<00:01:18.840> with<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.530> same<00:01:19.740> color<00:01:20.070> of<00:01:20.280> yarn<00:01:20.520> and

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
staying with the same color of yarn and

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.870 
staying with the same color of yarn and
this<00:01:21.659> also<00:01:21.900> only<00:01:22.439> works<00:01:22.680> with<00:01:22.979> natural<00:01:23.460> animal

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
this also only works with natural animal

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.240 
this also only works with natural animal
fibers<00:01:24.330> it<00:01:24.630> won't<00:01:25.110> work<00:01:25.350> with<00:01:25.650> cotton<00:01:26.070> or

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
fibers it won't work with cotton or

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.819 
fibers it won't work with cotton or
acrylic<00:01:26.729> or<00:01:27.240> other<00:01:27.420> cellulose<00:01:27.990> or<00:01:28.200> synthetic

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
acrylic or other cellulose or synthetic

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.100 
acrylic or other cellulose or synthetic
fibers<00:01:29.220> now<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.060> thing<00:01:30.630> you<00:01:30.659> notice<00:01:30.930> about

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
fibers now the thing you notice about

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.760 
fibers now the thing you notice about
this<00:01:31.500> is<00:01:31.770> that<00:01:33.110> when<00:01:34.110> you<00:01:34.229> get<00:01:34.409> up<00:01:34.530> to<00:01:34.680> the

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
this is that when you get up to the

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.620 
this is that when you get up to the
color<00:01:35.009> change<00:01:35.400> you<00:01:35.700> have<00:01:35.939> what<00:01:36.420> you<00:01:36.540> would

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
color change you have what you would

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.080 
color change you have what you would
call<00:01:36.689> a<00:01:37.110> muddy<00:01:37.470> color<00:01:37.829> change<00:01:38.250> that's<00:01:38.880> why

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
call a muddy color change that's why

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.480 
call a muddy color change that's why
it's<00:01:39.270> no<00:01:39.450> good<00:01:39.600> for<00:01:39.659> stripes<00:01:40.110> but<00:01:40.829> it<00:01:40.950> is<00:01:41.159> good

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
it's no good for stripes but it is good

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.639 
it's no good for stripes but it is good
in<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.850> way<00:01:42.000> that<00:01:42.329> if<00:01:42.689> we<00:01:43.110> didn't<00:01:43.409> have<00:01:43.500> this

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
in the way that if we didn't have this

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.850 
in the way that if we didn't have this
color<00:01:43.950> change<00:01:44.369> it<00:01:44.670> looks<00:01:45.240> really<00:01:45.720> smooth<00:01:46.079> the

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.039 

back<00:01:49.860> of<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.040> work<00:01:50.159> you<00:01:50.340> can't<00:01:50.579> tell<00:01:51.049> one

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
back of the work you can't tell one

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.929 
back of the work you can't tell one
thing<00:01:52.229> you<00:01:52.320> can't<00:01:52.530> see<00:01:52.619> in<00:01:52.890> video<00:01:53.189> is<00:01:53.549> that<00:01:53.790> it

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
thing you can't see in video is that it

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.410 
thing you can't see in video is that it
does<00:01:54.210> leave<00:01:54.950> the<00:01:55.950> work<00:01:56.189> feeling<00:01:56.700> a<00:01:56.820> little<00:01:57.119> bit

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
does leave the work feeling a little bit

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.139 
does leave the work feeling a little bit
stiffer<00:01:58.020> right<00:01:58.469> here<00:01:58.950> where<00:01:59.670> the<00:01:59.909> join

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
stiffer right here where the join

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.450 
stiffer right here where the join
happened<00:02:00.630> but<00:02:00.810> this<00:02:01.020> don't<00:02:01.290> excuse<00:02:02.189> me<00:02:02.340> the

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
happened but this don't excuse me the

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.130 
happened but this don't excuse me the
joint<00:02:02.640> is<00:02:02.850> about<00:02:03.060> a<00:02:03.090> stitch<00:02:03.420> and<00:02:03.570> a<00:02:03.600> half<00:02:03.780> and

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
joint is about a stitch and a half and

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.429 
joint is about a stitch and a half and
so<00:02:05.070> those<00:02:05.700> areas<00:02:05.969> that<00:02:06.180> I<00:02:06.329> felt<00:02:06.659> it<00:02:06.840> do<00:02:07.110> feel

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
so those areas that I felt it do feel

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.010 
so those areas that I felt it do feel
felted<00:02:07.920> compared<00:02:08.429> to<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:09.330> softness<00:02:09.780> of<00:02:09.959> the

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
felted compared to the softness of the

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.940 
felted compared to the softness of the
rest<00:02:10.289> of<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:10.470> work

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
rest of the work

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.990 
rest of the work
I<00:02:11.510> find<00:02:12.510> spit<00:02:12.930> splicing<00:02:13.230> to<00:02:13.620> be

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
I find spit splicing to be

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.240 
I find spit splicing to be
most<00:02:14.150> effective<00:02:14.600> and<00:02:14.870> nicest<00:02:15.350> looking<00:02:15.560> of<00:02:16.010> the

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
most effective and nicest looking of the

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.370 
most effective and nicest looking of the
join<00:02:16.520> most<00:02:16.910> the<00:02:17.060> time<00:02:17.270> when<00:02:17.600> I'm<00:02:17.750> working<00:02:18.170> with

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
join most the time when I'm working with

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.070 
join most the time when I'm working with
an<00:02:18.800> animal<00:02:18.920> fiber<00:02:19.430> but<00:02:20.240> if<00:02:20.390> you<00:02:20.510> join<00:02:20.750> it<00:02:20.930> and

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
an animal fiber but if you join it and

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.300 
an animal fiber but if you join it and
you<00:02:21.140> find<00:02:21.350> that<00:02:21.530> it<00:02:21.650> doesn't<00:02:21.800> look<00:02:22.010> that<00:02:22.190> great

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
you find that it doesn't look that great

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.800 
you find that it doesn't look that great
you<00:02:23.090> have<00:02:23.270> other<00:02:23.480> options<00:02:25.300> this<00:02:26.300> next<00:02:26.660> option

you have other options this next option

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.280 
you have other options this next option
is<00:02:27.050> the<00:02:27.500> Russian<00:02:27.980> join<00:02:28.280> and<00:02:28.670> you'll<00:02:29.660> see<00:02:29.960> in

is the Russian join and you'll see in

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.530 
is the Russian join and you'll see in
contrast<00:02:31.250> to<00:02:31.750> the<00:02:32.750> spit<00:02:33.290> splicing<00:02:34.180> there<00:02:35.180> is

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
contrast to the spit splicing there is

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.900 
contrast to the spit splicing there is
no<00:02:35.840> muddy<00:02:36.230> color<00:02:36.530> break<00:02:36.800> it's<00:02:37.040> a<00:02:37.130> super<00:02:37.610> clean

spit<00:02:53.930> splicing<00:02:54.260> did<00:02:54.650> the<00:02:55.610> downside<00:02:56.060> of<00:02:56.209> the

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:56.270 
spit splicing did the downside of the

spit splicing did the downside of the
Russian<00:02:56.570> join<00:02:56.840> is<00:02:57.140> this<00:02:57.980> you<00:02:58.970> can<00:02:59.150> end<00:02:59.420> up<00:02:59.570> with

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
Russian join is this you can end up with

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.470 
Russian join is this you can end up with
these<00:03:00.080> little<00:03:00.590> pokey<00:03:01.040> ends<00:03:01.520> from<00:03:02.090> the<00:03:02.150> join

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
these little pokey ends from the join

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.260 
these little pokey ends from the join
and<00:03:03.040> this<00:03:04.040> you<00:03:04.220> know<00:03:04.310> it<00:03:04.610> looks<00:03:04.820> perfect<00:03:05.180> on

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:05.270 
and this you know it looks perfect on

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:07.420 
and this you know it looks perfect on
this<00:03:05.450> side<00:03:05.690> and<00:03:06.050> that's<00:03:06.290> great<00:03:06.800> that's<00:03:07.130> what's

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
this side and that's great that's what's

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.340 
this side and that's great that's what's
really<00:03:07.640> nice<00:03:07.880> about<00:03:07.940> this<00:03:08.270> is<00:03:08.480> that<00:03:08.780> you<00:03:09.170> do

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
really nice about this is that you do

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.530 
really nice about this is that you do
end<00:03:09.530> up<00:03:09.620> with<00:03:09.740> really<00:03:09.920> nice-looking<00:03:10.220> work<00:03:10.760> but

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
end up with really nice-looking work but

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.270 
end up with really nice-looking work but
the<00:03:11.750> the<00:03:11.990> downside<00:03:12.410> is<00:03:12.650> that<00:03:12.920> these<00:03:13.100> little

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
the the downside is that these little

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.310 
the the downside is that these little
pokey<00:03:13.700> ends<00:03:14.090> can<00:03:14.420> work<00:03:14.690> their<00:03:14.900> way<00:03:15.050> to<00:03:15.110> the

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:15.320 
pokey ends can work their way to the

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.350 
pokey ends can work their way to the
front<00:03:15.500> of<00:03:15.590> the<00:03:15.680> work<00:03:15.890> which<00:03:16.550> means<00:03:16.790> that<00:03:17.150> you

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
front of the work which means that you

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.150 
front of the work which means that you
will<00:03:17.570> forever<00:03:18.019> be<00:03:18.230> trimming<00:03:18.680> these<00:03:18.830> little

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
will forever be trimming these little

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.240 
will forever be trimming these little
ends<00:03:19.610> because<00:03:20.480> I<00:03:20.660> used<00:03:21.050> 100%<00:03:21.560> wool<00:03:21.950> in<00:03:22.100> this

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
ends because I used 100% wool in this

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.670 
ends because I used 100% wool in this
sample<00:03:22.700> it<00:03:22.880> is<00:03:22.940> likely<00:03:23.450> that<00:03:23.840> these<00:03:24.050> ends<00:03:24.500> will

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
sample it is likely that these ends will

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.800 
sample it is likely that these ends will
just<00:03:24.920> sort<00:03:25.160> of<00:03:25.250> naturally<00:03:25.850> felt<00:03:26.180> their<00:03:26.390> way<00:03:26.420> in

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
just sort of naturally felt their way in

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.140 
just sort of naturally felt their way in
and<00:03:27.110> never<00:03:27.830> work<00:03:28.160> their<00:03:28.489> way<00:03:28.640> out<00:03:28.880> to<00:03:29.060> the

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
and never work their way out to the

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.070 
and never work their way out to the
front<00:03:30.190> so<00:03:31.190> you<00:03:31.790> can<00:03:31.970> always<00:03:32.239> switch<00:03:32.810> back<00:03:33.050> and

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:33.080 
front so you can always switch back and

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.500 
front so you can always switch back and
forth<00:03:33.320> between<00:03:33.590> these<00:03:34.130> two<00:03:34.459> and<00:03:34.790> see<00:03:35.360> which

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
forth between these two and see which

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:36.370 
forth between these two and see which
one<00:03:35.720> looks<00:03:35.750> best

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
one looks best

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.350 
one looks best
that's<00:03:36.980> usually<00:03:37.130> what<00:03:37.370> I<00:03:37.430> do<00:03:37.550> I<00:03:37.820> always<00:03:38.120> start

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:38.360 
that's usually what I do I always start

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:39.910 
that's usually what I do I always start
with<00:03:38.450> spit<00:03:38.690> splicing<00:03:38.930> if<00:03:39.320> it<00:03:39.650> doesn't<00:03:39.860> look

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 
with spit splicing if it doesn't look

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.680 
with spit splicing if it doesn't look
good<00:03:40.130> I'll<00:03:40.310> try<00:03:40.550> Russian<00:03:40.910> join<00:03:41.090> next<00:03:42.340> okay

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
good I'll try Russian join next okay

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.840 
good I'll try Russian join next okay
this<00:03:44.690> is<00:03:44.989> the<00:03:45.560> method<00:03:45.860> you<00:03:45.980> want<00:03:46.160> to<00:03:46.310> use<00:03:46.549> if

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:46.850 
this is the method you want to use if

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:50.170 
this is the method you want to use if
