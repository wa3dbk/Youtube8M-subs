00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600
 the path of ignorance 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.600
 paved with researches 

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:09.620
 the leaf turns while the 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.210
 separatists are becoming more and more strategic 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.309
 control important trade routes 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:16.369
 marching republican troops in 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:17.960
 the dark world of the indifferent skywalker 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:19.910
 obi wan kenobi supports the 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.650
 capital to conquer barras than he 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.039
 surprisingly recalled after a short hand 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:23.720
 becomes 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:26.360
 a battalion is now subordinate to that 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.550
 command of the general pomp one 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:31.310
 Emotionally cold and ambitious leader 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.140
 Krenz brutal leadership style to captain 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:36.610
 Rex and his unit withdrew and 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.610
 in a devastating defeat 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:35.310
 the new water guys do not need to 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.930
 take the resistance of the conversion is but 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.700
 We still hold our position we 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.680
 know of a room basel in the west 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.680
 from there the defense gets its 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.340
 he could play, base, the hand 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.869
 could be cut off from supplies then 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.580
 we manage to invade there 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.140
 I will make sure that you have the 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.660
 to bring support to victims 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.250
 do not forget the whole in general 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:02.940
 version is from now on in the hands 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:05.780
 of a battalion they mark the 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.780
 coordinates and 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.489
 there is actually a base and 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.260
 he is heavily guarded at least three 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:38.720
 armored divisions merely cannons 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.720
 we will advance through this flight 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:44.480
 and your troops to a frontal attack 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.680
 provoke I fear the severest we 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.209
 Our units can only ever be found in 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.069
 let small groups advance 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:50.540
 maybe we should scout out 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:53.209
 there is still a safer way out there 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.799
 the railway and the other battalions 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:56.329
 have the enemy currently under control 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:57.470
 but they are waiting for us 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:59.150
 switch off the support point 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.260
 we should rather hurry than after 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.260
 to look for other routes 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.200
 all right all her we share each 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.430
 unit in two groups on and 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.800
 march through the gorge directly 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.410
 on the room basis on the other end to it 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.950
 will cost a lot of men in shape 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.780
 bring 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.580
 So I once asked myself if 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.660
 this world is crazy but now I am 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.700
 I'm absolutely sure 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.140
 First we had to leave the capital 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.750
 The strategy of the terror was gone 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.370
 did not come up and now who knows 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.200
 maybe it's fun 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.360
 So if you ask me I stand 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.680
 behind the plan of the channels and running 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.300
 the time of it and that is the best 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.400
 option no education no 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:47.080
 Support from the air of the white of 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.220
 the edges get interest 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:48.880
 believe that we have never seen 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.980
 to have 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.840
 jenner skywalker also has every now and then 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.530
 idiosyncratic methods and they were 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.870
 successfully 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:58.000
 yes what skywalker 14 men normally 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.610
 at the front and hangs 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.680
 not in the background as a source at 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:05.370
 a frontal attack, we are vulnerable 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.370
 delivered 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:17.810
 it would be better if you have her 

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:19.880
 appease 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:21.440
 shall I persuade her at Krems 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.180
 next suicide mission to join 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.690
 Last time we have many men 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.010
 lost 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:26.780
 Krell makes things different 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:27.140
 but he is successful in what he is 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.600
 does 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:31.220
 He is a recognized war hero too 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.570
 if he has so many folders you have 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.790
 seen his victims pay 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:37.130
 Nobody has so many dead soldiers 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:40.280
 Just like him, that's the price 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:41.900
 of war 5 we are soldiers 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.940
 We have the duty to 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.010
 follow and if need be ours 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:47.690
 to sacrifice life 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:49.130
 Do you really believe that or do you have one? 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:52.490
 not that designed to believe that 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:54.580
 I have my codecs and believe it 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:54.580
 I
