00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
see is there's a lot of crap on the

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.240 
see is there's a lot of crap on the
screen<00:00:51.270> and<00:00:51.510> you<00:00:52.140> basically<00:00:52.289> start<00:00:52.620> out<00:00:53.039> with

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
screen and you basically start out with

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.950 
screen and you basically start out with
I<00:00:53.460> think<00:00:53.640> it's<00:00:53.789> a<00:00:53.850> UMP<00:00:54.360> 45<00:00:54.570> can<00:00:55.500> you<00:00:55.590> remember

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
I think it's a UMP 45 can you remember

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.930 
I think it's a UMP 45 can you remember
it<00:00:57.960> is<00:00:58.079> okay<00:00:58.590> so<00:00:58.829> you<00:00:58.890> start<00:00:59.190> off<00:00:59.250> with<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.460> UMP

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
it is okay so you start off with the UMP

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.939 
it is okay so you start off with the UMP
and<00:00:59.969> then<00:01:00.180> for<00:01:00.329> every<00:01:00.449> kill<00:01:00.780> you<00:01:00.899> get<00:01:01.109> I<00:01:01.350> think

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
and then for every kill you get I think

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.789 
and then for every kill you get I think
you<00:01:02.190> go<00:01:02.309> like<00:01:02.340> a<00:01:02.579> hundred<00:01:03.619> dollars<00:01:04.619> or

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
you go like a hundred dollars or

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.380 
you go like a hundred dollars or
whatever<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.250> hell<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.580> currency<00:01:06.000> is<00:01:06.150> and

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
whatever the hell the currency is and

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.060 
whatever the hell the currency is and
you<00:01:06.450> could<00:01:06.630> you<00:01:06.780> can<00:01:06.930> buy<00:01:07.080> certain<00:01:07.470> things<00:01:07.500> and

badly but i thought i'd share it with
you<00:01:27.240> because<00:01:27.270> it<00:01:27.540> has<00:01:27.659> some<00:01:27.810> kind<00:01:27.960> of<00:01:28.080> cool

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
you because it has some kind of cool

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.700 
you because it has some kind of cool
stuff<00:01:29.610> in<00:01:29.759> it<00:01:29.880> so<00:01:30.450> basically<00:01:30.960> you'll<00:01:31.229> see<00:01:31.470> on

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
stuff in it so basically you'll see on

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.880 
stuff in it so basically you'll see on
the<00:01:31.829> screen<00:01:31.920> alpha<00:01:32.579> zombie<00:01:32.880> in<00:01:33.000> 20<00:01:33.450> and

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
the screen alpha zombie in 20 and

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.560 
the screen alpha zombie in 20 and
there's<00:01:34.890> one<00:01:35.130> zombie<00:01:35.579> to<00:01:35.759> start<00:01:36.030> off<00:01:36.180> with<00:01:36.420> and

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
there's one zombie to start off with and

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.240 
there's one zombie to start off with and
it<00:01:36.630> can<00:01:36.780> be<00:01:36.810> any<00:01:37.079> one<00:01:37.290> of<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.500> humans<00:01:37.920> will<00:01:38.159> be

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:00.500 
when I do all the off map filming in

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:02.950 
when I do all the off map filming in
terminal<00:06:00.950> but<00:06:01.580> all<00:06:01.700> this<00:06:01.850> is<00:06:02.090> like<00:06:02.330> it's

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:02.960 
terminal but all this is like it's

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:08.710

properly<00:06:03.350> playable<00:06:03.860> and<00:06:04.760> I'm<00:06:05.630> my<00:06:05.810> casa<00:06:07.660> so<00:06:08.660> you

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:08.720 
properly playable and I'm my casa so you

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:11.380 
properly playable and I'm my casa so you
cotton<00:06:09.530> eyed<00:06:09.890> the<00:06:09.950> screen<00:06:10.490> or<00:06:10.760> is<00:06:10.940> a<00:06:11.090> bit

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:11.390 
cotton eyed the screen or is a bit

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:14.650 
cotton eyed the screen or is a bit
actually<00:06:11.720> teleport<00:06:12.470> I'm<00:06:13.160> i<00:06:13.729> ended<00:06:14.300> up<00:06:14.390> cutting

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:14.660 
actually teleport I'm i ended up cutting

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:16.480 
actually teleport I'm i ended up cutting
out<00:06:14.930> a<00:06:14.960> little<00:06:15.260> bit<00:06:15.470> because<00:06:15.680> it<00:06:15.979> lagged<00:06:16.220> so

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:16.490 
out a little bit because it lagged so

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:20.650 
out a little bit because it lagged so
bad<00:06:16.729> um<00:06:17.800> but<00:06:18.800> what<00:06:19.070> you<00:06:19.880> do<00:06:20.090> is<00:06:20.240> you<00:06:20.360> kind<00:06:20.510> of

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:20.660 
bad um but what you do is you kind of

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:23.890 
bad um but what you do is you kind of
jump<00:06:20.900> over<00:06:21.229> those<00:06:21.349> suitcases<00:06:21.680> and<00:06:22.870> but<00:06:23.870> i

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:23.900 
jump over those suitcases and but i

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:25.800 
jump over those suitcases and but i
think<00:06:24.260> it<00:06:24.380> does<00:06:24.409> partially<00:06:25.220> teleport

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:25.810 
think it does partially teleport

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:27.420 
think it does partially teleport
you<00:06:25.930> I<00:06:25.960> just<00:06:26.320> can't<00:06:26.500> tell<00:06:26.710> you<00:06:26.860> cuz<00:06:27.040> you<00:06:27.310> know

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:32.020 
is where I epically fail at trying to

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:34.890 
is where I epically fail at trying to
get<00:06:32.139> over<00:06:32.290> these<00:06:32.530> things<00:06:32.590> I'm<00:06:33.160> like<00:06:33.460> mm<00:06:34.300> how'd

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:34.900 
get over these things I'm like mm how'd

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:37.200 
get over these things I'm like mm how'd
it<00:06:35.020> and<00:06:35.200> then<00:06:35.320> suddenly<00:06:35.650> I'm<00:06:35.950> there<00:06:36.210> so

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:37.210

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:38.640 
it and then suddenly I'm there so
there's<00:06:37.389> obviously<00:06:37.510> like<00:06:37.930> a<00:06:37.960> part<00:06:38.260> in<00:06:38.380> the<00:06:38.470> map

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:38.650 
there's obviously like a part in the map

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:41.970 
there's obviously like a part in the map
that<00:06:38.860> you<00:06:38.980> have<00:06:39.220> to<00:06:39.430> hit<00:06:40.200> if<00:06:41.200> I<00:06:41.380> don't<00:06:41.590> get<00:06:41.740> why

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:41.980 
that you have to hit if I don't get why

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:43.680 
that you have to hit if I don't get why

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:45.940 
mean it's almost like they intended it

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:49.230 
mean it's almost like they intended it
to<00:06:46.000> be<00:06:46.120> played<00:06:46.450> but<00:06:46.780> they<00:06:46.930> just<00:06:47.080> didn't<00:06:48.240> you

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:49.240
