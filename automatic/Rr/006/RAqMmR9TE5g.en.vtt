are two kinds of damages and you know

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.230 
are two kinds of damages and you know
felt<00:01:47.259> fires<00:01:47.560> are<00:01:47.829> not<00:01:48.009> just<00:01:48.219> about<00:01:48.520> the<00:01:48.969> felt

felt fires are not just about the felt
it's<00:01:49.420> also<00:01:49.630> about<00:01:49.840> that<00:01:50.170> interaction<00:01:50.920> with

the<00:02:20.420> two<00:02:20.780> thousand<00:02:21.290> files<00:02:21.470> we<00:02:22.220> did<00:02:22.459> a<00:02:22.489> small

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
the two thousand files we did a small

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.630 
the two thousand files we did a small
research<00:02:23.000> project<00:02:23.660> and<00:02:24.170> in<00:02:24.800> areas<00:02:25.280> where<00:02:25.459> they

research project and in areas where they

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.190 
research project and in areas where they
were<00:02:25.790> dense<00:02:26.060> stands<00:02:26.450> of<00:02:26.630> invasive<00:02:26.930> alien

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.100 
plants we had massive soil movement much
like<00:02:30.560> erosion<00:02:31.550> he<00:02:31.640> leads<00:02:31.849> and<00:02:32.090> that<00:02:32.840> could

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
like erosion he leads and that could

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.699 
like erosion he leads and that could
still<00:02:33.380> be<00:02:34.870> ecologically<00:02:35.870> very<00:02:36.440> very

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
detrimental to you to the mountain but

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.559 
detrimental to you to the mountain but
it's<00:02:39.769> too<00:02:39.980> early<00:02:40.040> to<00:02:40.340> say<00:02:40.489> to<00:02:41.090> what<00:02:41.239> extent

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:41.569 
it's too early to say to what extent

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:43.059 
it's too early to say to what extent
that<00:02:41.690> will<00:02:41.989> happen<00:02:42.170> after<00:02:42.530> this<00:02:42.830> fight

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:43.069 
that will happen after this fight

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:47.220 
that will happen after this fight
because<00:02:43.640> the<00:02:44.030> park<00:02:44.300> has<00:02:44.510> made<00:02:44.810> some<00:02:45.140> major

progress with fighting invasive alien
plants<00:02:51.590> and<00:02:52.180> the<00:02:53.180> problem<00:02:53.750> is<00:02:53.870> why<00:02:54.260> mess<00:02:54.530> with

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
plants and the problem is why mess with

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.460 
plants and the problem is why mess with
our<00:02:55.160> left<00:02:55.610> behind<00:02:56.120> what<00:02:56.660> that<00:02:56.840> impact<00:02:57.290> is

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
our left behind what that impact is

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.490 
our left behind what that impact is
going<00:02:57.680> to<00:02:57.769> be<00:02:57.890> on<00:02:57.980> the<00:02:58.099> tops'ls<00:02:59.080> for<00:03:00.080> washing

going to be on the tops'ls for washing
away<00:03:00.620> and<00:03:01.090> so<00:03:02.090> the<00:03:02.569> jury<00:03:02.780> is<00:03:02.989> still<00:03:03.019> out<00:03:03.349> how

what you can what you'll hear is is the

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:15.490 
what you can what you'll hear is is the
the<00:04:13.340> spot<00:04:13.609> of<00:04:13.790> pilots<00:04:14.450> and<00:04:14.690> the<00:04:14.900> pilots<00:04:15.350> and

the<00:04:17.660> coordination<00:04:18.380> i<00:04:18.470> think<00:04:18.739> is<00:04:18.859> just<00:04:19.039> ten

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
the coordination i think is just ten

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.520 
the coordination i think is just ten
times<00:04:19.549> better<00:04:19.760> than<00:04:19.910> what<00:04:20.060> it<00:04:20.329> was<00:04:20.359> 15<00:04:21.349> years

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
times better than what it was 15 years
