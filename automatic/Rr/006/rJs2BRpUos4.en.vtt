00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
because I just find that a lot easier

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.020 
because I just find that a lot easier
than<00:03:11.440> using<00:03:11.590> paints<00:03:12.310> probably<00:03:12.610> cuz<00:03:12.730> it<00:03:12.820> dries

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
than using paints probably cuz it dries

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.960 
than using paints probably cuz it dries
quicker<00:03:13.530> and<00:03:14.530> also<00:03:14.950> this<00:03:15.220> arm<00:03:15.490> was<00:03:15.760> broken

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
quicker and also this arm was broken

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.910 
quicker and also this arm was broken
