ornaments after I break this down I want
to<00:00:23.130> put<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.369> pieces<00:00:23.580> in<00:00:23.820> my<00:00:24.000> truck<00:00:24.449> for

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
to put the pieces in my truck for

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.150 
to put the pieces in my truck for
turning<00:00:25.109> so<00:00:25.320> I<00:00:25.380> need<00:00:25.560> to<00:00:25.680> start<00:00:25.949> turning

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
turning so I need to start turning

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.689 
turning so I need to start turning
tenants<00:00:26.849> on<00:00:27.800> if<00:00:28.800> you<00:00:29.039> do<00:00:29.220> this<00:00:29.340> for<00:00:29.400> a<00:00:29.609> while

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
tenants on if you do this for a while

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.790 
tenants on if you do this for a while
you<00:00:29.910> can<00:00:30.029> pretty<00:00:30.210> much<00:00:30.330> eyeball<00:00:30.960> a<00:00:30.990> tenon<00:00:31.529> but

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
you can pretty much eyeball a tenon but

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.680 
you can pretty much eyeball a tenon but
I<00:00:31.830> always<00:00:32.070> keep<00:00:32.340> a<00:00:32.489> caliper<00:00:32.880> around<00:00:33.270> to<00:00:33.450> check

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
I always keep a caliper around to check

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.490 
I always keep a caliper around to check
it<00:00:33.870> to<00:00:33.989> make<00:00:34.020> sure<00:00:35.030> and<00:00:36.030> I<00:00:36.540> shut<00:00:37.020> off<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.320> laid

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
it to make sure and I shut off the laid

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.080 
it to make sure and I shut off the laid
then<00:00:37.739> let<00:00:37.890> it<00:00:37.920> stop<00:00:38.250> before<00:00:38.460> I<00:00:38.670> check<00:00:38.940> the

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
then let it stop before I check the

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.970 
then let it stop before I check the
tenon<00:00:39.480> because<00:00:39.780> this<00:00:40.020> is<00:00:40.170> a<00:00:40.200> good<00:00:40.469> caliper<00:00:40.950> and

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
tenon because this is a good caliper and

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.639 
tenon because this is a good caliper and
I<00:00:41.129> don't<00:00:41.309> want<00:00:41.430> to<00:00:41.520> bust<00:00:41.730> it<00:00:41.969> up<00:00:42.559> next<00:00:43.559> I'm

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
I don't want to bust it up next I'm

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.200 
I don't want to bust it up next I'm
going<00:00:43.739> to<00:00:43.860> move<00:00:43.950> to<00:00:44.010> tool<00:00:44.340> writes<00:00:44.610> down<00:00:44.850> a<00:00:44.910> ways

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
going to move to tool writes down a ways

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.020 
going to move to tool writes down a ways
and<00:00:45.510> cut<00:00:46.110> another<00:00:46.379> tenant<00:00:46.980> later<00:00:47.430> on<00:00:47.640> I'll<00:00:47.820> cut

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
and cut another tenant later on I'll cut

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.479 
and cut another tenant later on I'll cut
all<00:00:48.120> these<00:00:48.270> pieces<00:00:48.570> apart<00:00:49.110> I<00:00:49.440> want<00:00:50.309> to<00:00:50.370> make

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
all these pieces apart I want to make

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.040 
all these pieces apart I want to make
each<00:00:50.700> workpiece<00:00:51.239> three<00:00:51.570> or<00:00:51.660> four<00:00:51.870> inches

each workpiece three or four inches
longer<00:00:52.469> than<00:00:52.620> I<00:00:52.920> need<00:00:53.160> so<00:00:53.430> I<00:00:53.730> have<00:00:53.789> room<00:00:54.120> to

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
longer than I need so I have room to

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.240 
longer than I need so I have room to
work<00:00:54.420> on<00:00:54.629> either<00:00:54.780> end<00:00:55.050> at<00:00:55.260> an<00:00:55.350> ornament<00:00:55.860> before

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250

I<00:00:56.309> actually<00:00:56.520> target<00:00:57.210> off<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.660> truck<00:00:59.120> you

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
I actually target off to the truck you

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.970 
I actually target off to the truck you
can<00:01:00.300> use<00:01:00.449> a<00:01:00.480> small<00:01:00.870> saw<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.260> cut<00:01:01.590> these<00:01:01.739> pieces

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
can use a small saw to cut these pieces

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.460 
can use a small saw to cut these pieces
apart<00:01:02.579> it<00:01:02.969> just<00:01:03.180> takes<00:01:03.359> a<00:01:03.510> long<00:01:03.629> time<00:01:03.690> it's<00:01:04.350> not

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
apart it just takes a long time it's not

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.179 
apart it just takes a long time it's not
a<00:01:04.530> lot<00:01:04.739> of<00:01:04.769> fun<00:01:05.100> I'm<00:01:05.309> late<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:06.890> this<00:01:07.890> is<00:01:08.070> the

a lot of fun I'm late and this is the

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.130 
a lot of fun I'm late and this is the
easier<00:01:08.520> way<00:01:08.670> use<00:01:09.090> my<00:01:09.240> parting<00:01:09.630> tool<00:01:09.750> will<00:01:09.990> make

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
easier way use my parting tool will make

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.500 
easier way use my parting tool will make
a<00:01:10.170> cut<00:01:10.470> behind<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:11.100> ten<00:01:11.369> enough<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:12.030> i<00:01:12.299> left

especially<00:01:43.310> when<00:01:43.789> we<00:01:43.939> start<00:01:44.210> getting<00:01:44.390> the

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
especially when we start getting the

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.279 
especially when we start getting the
piece<00:01:44.869> then<00:01:45.170> go<00:01:46.390> throughout<00:01:47.390> this<00:01:47.600> process<00:01:47.899> I

00:01:48.279 --> 00:01:48.289 
piece then go throughout this process I

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:50.139 
piece then go throughout this process I
try<00:01:48.530> and<00:01:48.619> keep<00:01:48.740> the<00:01:48.920> bevel<00:01:49.280> rubbing<00:01:49.700> so<00:01:49.880> I<00:01:49.939> get

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:50.149 
try and keep the bevel rubbing so I get

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:52.149 
try and keep the bevel rubbing so I get
the<00:01:50.299> best<00:01:50.509> surface<00:01:51.020> i<00:01:51.170> can<00:01:51.409> write<00:01:51.679> off<00:01:51.860> of<00:01:52.069> the

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 
the best surface i can write off of the

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:55.300 
the best surface i can write off of the
tool<00:01:53.259> this<00:01:54.259> is<00:01:54.409> going<00:01:54.530> to<00:01:54.619> be<00:01:54.740> one<00:01:54.920> of<00:01:55.039> the<00:01:55.130> last

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
tool this is going to be one of the last

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.249 
tool this is going to be one of the last
deep<00:01:55.700> cuts<00:01:55.970> they<00:01:56.149> can<00:01:56.360> take<00:01:56.600> cuz<00:01:56.899> there's<00:01:57.079> not

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:57.259 
deep cuts they can take cuz there's not

00:01:57.259 --> 00:01:58.660 
deep cuts they can take cuz there's not
going<00:01:57.380> to<00:01:57.439> be<00:01:57.500> enough<00:01:57.679> material<00:01:58.280> left<00:01:58.490> to

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
going to be enough material left to

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.419 
going to be enough material left to
support<00:01:59.090> much<00:01:59.270> pressure<00:01:59.950> from<00:02:00.950> here<00:02:01.220> on<00:02:01.310> out

00:02:01.419 --> 00:02:01.429 
support much pressure from here on out

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:03.730 
support much pressure from here on out
we<00:02:01.610> got<00:02:01.759> to<00:02:01.880> take<00:02:02.090> it<00:02:02.119> easy<00:02:02.390> make<00:02:02.959> nice<00:02:03.229> even

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
we got to take it easy make nice even

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.539 
we got to take it easy make nice even
cuts<00:02:04.810> and<00:02:05.810> on<00:02:05.959> this<00:02:06.140> last<00:02:06.439> cut<00:02:06.830> you<00:02:07.039> notice<00:02:07.369> i'd

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:07.549 
cuts and on this last cut you notice i'd

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:10.320 
cuts and on this last cut you notice i'd
almost<00:02:07.789> take<00:02:08.239> too<00:02:08.479> much<00:02:08.660> material<00:02:08.929> off

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
almost take too much material off

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.820 
almost take too much material off
because<00:02:11.330> they<00:02:11.480> start<00:02:11.780> on<00:02:11.959> the<00:02:12.080> face<00:02:12.290> i<00:02:12.470> can<00:02:12.620> see

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
because they start on the face i can see

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.680 
because they start on the face i can see
them<00:02:12.950> taking<00:02:13.190> too<00:02:13.430> much<00:02:13.580> material<00:02:13.790> so<00:02:14.390> i<00:02:14.450> roam

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
them taking too much material so i roam

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.620 
them taking too much material so i roam
the<00:02:14.840> tool<00:02:15.080> out<00:02:15.519> smooth<00:02:16.519> that's<00:02:16.790> cut<00:02:17.030> off<00:02:17.239> and

the tool out smooth that's cut off and

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.830 
the tool out smooth that's cut off and
then<00:02:17.900> run<00:02:18.110> out<00:02:18.230> to<00:02:18.440> the<00:02:18.470> end<00:02:18.650> and<00:02:18.830> taper<00:02:19.160> it

closer to the truck we're going to have
to<00:03:04.010> make<00:03:04.190> a<00:03:04.250> big<00:03:04.519> V<00:03:04.850> in<00:03:05.000> this<00:03:05.150> piece<00:03:05.450> so<00:03:05.870> we<00:03:05.959> got

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:06.139 
to make a big V in this piece so we got

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:07.629 
to make a big V in this piece so we got
room<00:03:06.319> to<00:03:06.350> get<00:03:06.590> the<00:03:06.769> tool<00:03:06.980> and<00:03:07.250> they'll<00:03:07.430> finish

already decided to make the top part to
this<00:03:15.769> ornament<00:03:16.220> a<00:03:16.370> simple<00:03:16.760> ball<00:03:17.030> so<00:03:17.780> I<00:03:17.870> can

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:18.049 
this ornament a simple ball so I can

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:20.140 
this ornament a simple ball so I can
rough<00:03:18.410> that<00:03:18.680> shape<00:03:19.040> in<00:03:19.280> as<00:03:19.489> I'm<00:03:19.670> cutting<00:03:19.880> away

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
rough that shape in as I'm cutting away

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.280 
rough that shape in as I'm cutting away
to<00:03:20.269> material<00:03:20.930> near<00:03:21.139> the<00:03:21.290> truck<00:03:22.000> is<00:03:23.079> they<00:03:24.079> get

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
to material near the truck is they get

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.020 
to material near the truck is they get
closer<00:03:24.560> to<00:03:24.859> the<00:03:24.950> shape<00:03:25.190> o<00:03:25.370> on<00:03:25.549> I'll<00:03:25.760> start

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
closer to the shape o on I'll start

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.000 
closer to the shape o on I'll start
carrying<00:03:26.420> to<00:03:26.540> cut<00:03:26.750> further<00:03:27.049> down<00:03:27.440> so<00:03:27.889> I<00:03:27.950> can
