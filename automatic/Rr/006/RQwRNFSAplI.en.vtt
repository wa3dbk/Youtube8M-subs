00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:26.770
 or as if we start with unboxing 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:31.090
 a girl of 300 days 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:34.310
 350 I got fucked up I had to take those that 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:35.810
 they did not have the same works for 500 days 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:37.640
 since he is a totally 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:40.130
 different from the line the first one that 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.650
 they took out what they can show for 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:45.170
 guys, guys, I'm going to show you here 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:49.070
 well I am dead as if it were new and 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:51.950
 such and marcelo's game there is and here 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:55.230
 is the console of 500 50 gb as you can 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:57.650
 see is completely new 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:01.480
 and over time 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:04.120
 It is worth as you can see the model 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:06.370
 is completely new is finer as 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.580
 you can see it is much finer than it was 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:11.210
 slim 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.210
 it's more 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:16.370
 without sea the connections back is here 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.920
 take from the internet from the che of me the 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:23.240
 of the optical sound sorry that if you 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:25.610
 commanded it has components 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.290
 here is an engine that I do not know why 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.240
 pussy serves 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:33.260
 and good here you have the two connections 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.850
 typical usb always this that is not 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:39.090
 move 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:42.240
 I think that covering things is worth it, so let's go 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.820
 to see this as you can see is the thing 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.360
 normal and here you have the typical button for 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.360
 happy 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.180
 in the record box but what it does is 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.010
 this 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.920
 is that solar opens and here I have 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:58.950
 the hand disk yes little sister sing you know 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:02.280
 of good current roll of 6 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.259
 I do not like that much, it's a mixture 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.229
 between the playstation 2 model with 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.910
 removed the slim but good this is all 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.259
 plastic or do not think this is from 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.110
 metal or nothing because it gives the 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:15.810
 feeling that you see but it is not here 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:19.680
 there is a button that is called that is from ps to 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:21.510
 see if you can see it there is that no no 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.550
 it's a button it's a circle with seba and 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.280
 it will be a kind of reset something of 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.709
 the console but basically the console 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.319
 it's a little bit thinner than it is 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:33.109
 the slim 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:35.740
 weighs not much less than the other 

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:39.040
 true that 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:40.420
 we assign them less as many stretches 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.040
 the only difference is already the big ones 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:46.840
 would be the little button this and that gets 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.430
 okay, this is the thing that goes 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.790
 sent we do not like anything that the reader 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:53.770
 go there as you can see because it is 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.870
 exposed to shit even though it is 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:59.350
 better to be able to clean it has more 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:01.750
 ease of appointment so good 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:06.870
 this will be a duplex boxing and without three 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.870
 there are still 500 gigs of hard disk 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:16.540
 have some boxing girls while we 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.540
 he has enjoyed the divine life
