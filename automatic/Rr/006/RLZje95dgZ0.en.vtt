00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
have in here and is in this pouch and

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:00.159 
have in here and is in this pouch and
that<00:03:56.449> is<00:03:56.660> a<00:03:57.139> spider<00:03:58.099> cold<00:03:58.430> ladybug<00:03:59.000> this<00:03:59.989> is<00:04:00.109> a

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:00.169 
that is a spider cold ladybug this is a

00:04:00.169 --> 00:04:02.470 
that is a spider cold ladybug this is a
small<00:04:00.470> knife<00:04:00.709> let<00:04:01.609> me<00:04:01.699> see<00:04:01.879> you<00:04:02.269> have<00:04:02.449> a

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
small knife let me see you have a

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.000 
small knife let me see you have a
fountain<00:04:02.959> pen<00:04:03.109> so<00:04:03.349> it<00:04:03.440> gives<00:04:03.530> you<00:04:03.680> a<00:04:03.709> bit<00:04:03.859> of<00:04:03.889> an

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
fountain pen so it gives you a bit of an

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.750 
fountain pen so it gives you a bit of an
idea<00:04:04.159> of<00:04:04.340> how<00:04:04.519> big<00:04:04.579> it<00:04:04.940> is<00:04:05.109> it's<00:04:06.109> small<00:04:06.470> but

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 
idea of how big it is it's small but

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.670 
idea of how big it is it's small but
don't<00:04:07.760> underestimate<00:04:08.030> this<00:04:08.569> thing<00:04:08.840> i<00:04:09.049> really

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
don't underestimate this thing i really

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.979 
don't underestimate this thing i really
like<00:04:09.799> it<00:04:10.159> has<00:04:10.340> a<00:04:10.370> serrated<00:04:10.760> edge<00:04:11.090> that's<00:04:11.690> nice

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:11.989 
like it has a serrated edge that's nice

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:13.629 
like it has a serrated edge that's nice
jimping<00:04:12.470> here<00:04:12.739> on<00:04:12.919> the<00:04:13.069> back<00:04:13.250> so<00:04:13.430> that<00:04:13.519> it

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:13.639 
jimping here on the back so that it

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:16.300 
jimping here on the back so that it
really<00:04:13.819> gives<00:04:14.030> you<00:04:14.180> a<00:04:14.269> pleasant<00:04:15.109> spot<00:04:16.099> for

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
really gives you a pleasant spot for

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:17.890 
really gives you a pleasant spot for
your<00:04:16.430> thumb<00:04:16.669> to<00:04:16.880> hold<00:04:16.909> it<00:04:17.269> doesn't<00:04:17.510> slide<00:04:17.720> away

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
your thumb to hold it doesn't slide away

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.319 
your thumb to hold it doesn't slide away
you<00:04:18.680> have<00:04:18.799> the<00:04:18.949> big<00:04:19.159> guy<00:04:19.370> that<00:04:19.579> spyderco<00:04:20.060> does

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:20.329 
you have the big guy that spyderco does

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:22.930 
you have the big guy that spyderco does
typically<00:04:20.870> which<00:04:21.470> does<00:04:21.829> allow<00:04:22.190> one-handed

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 
typically which does allow one-handed

opening and this is h1 steel now which
means<00:04:26.360> that<00:04:26.599> there<00:04:26.810> I<00:04:26.990> don't<00:04:27.530> claim<00:04:28.310> to

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
means that there I don't claim to

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.000 
means that there I don't claim to
understand<00:04:28.909> the<00:04:29.030> full<00:04:29.240> metallurgical

but<00:04:31.690> apparently<00:04:32.080> they<00:04:32.230> replaced<00:04:33.300> if<00:04:34.300> i<00:04:34.450> miss

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:34.630 
but apparently they replaced if i miss

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:36.960 
but apparently they replaced if i miss

this<00:04:44.110> stuff<00:04:44.410> a<00:04:44.650> lot<00:04:44.800> of<00:04:44.950> divers<00:04:45.490> to<00:04:45.640> use<00:04:45.760> this

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:45.970 
this stuff a lot of divers to use this

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.500 
this stuff a lot of divers to use this
because<00:04:46.480> you<00:04:47.470> can<00:04:47.740> actually<00:04:48.060> even<00:04:49.060> submerge

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:49.510 
because you can actually even submerge

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:51.210 
because you can actually even submerge
it<00:04:49.660> in<00:04:49.750> salt<00:04:49.990> water<00:04:50.080> and<00:04:50.410> it<00:04:50.530> should<00:04:50.710> not<00:04:50.860> rust

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:51.220 
it in salt water and it should not rust

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:53.670 
it in salt water and it should not rust
which<00:04:51.460> is<00:04:51.610> quite<00:04:51.820> cool<00:04:52.090> simple<00:04:53.050> grip<00:04:53.350> scales

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
which is quite cool simple grip scales

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.620 
which is quite cool simple grip scales
is<00:04:53.920> yellow<00:04:54.190> as<00:04:54.490> we<00:04:54.910> should<00:04:55.120> be<00:04:55.210> able<00:04:55.270> to<00:04:55.420> find

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:55.630 
is yellow as we should be able to find

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:57.930 
is yellow as we should be able to find
it<00:04:55.750> back<00:04:55.930> here<00:04:56.110> you<00:04:56.230> can<00:04:56.350> get<00:04:56.440> a<00:04:56.500> lanyard<00:04:56.940> hole

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:57.940 
it back here you can get a lanyard hole

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:00.210 
it back here you can get a lanyard hole
in<00:04:58.240> there<00:04:58.450> this<00:04:59.410> thing<00:04:59.680> I<00:04:59.860> didn't<00:05:00.010> really<00:05:00.100> have

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:00.220 
in there this thing I didn't really have

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.070 
in there this thing I didn't really have
a<00:05:00.340> good<00:05:00.640> bit<00:05:00.940> of<00:05:00.970> paracord<00:05:01.510> this<00:05:01.660> is<00:05:01.780> very

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080 
a good bit of paracord this is very

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.970 
a good bit of paracord this is very
small<00:05:02.410> so<00:05:02.590> I<00:05:02.650> hardly<00:05:02.950> have<00:05:03.130> any<00:05:03.370> leverage<00:05:04.980> but

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:05.980 
small so I hardly have any leverage but

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:10.020 
small so I hardly have any leverage but
believe<00:05:06.370> me<00:05:07.770> it's<00:05:08.770> very<00:05:08.950> sharp<00:05:09.610> and<00:05:09.790> if<00:05:09.910> this

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:10.030 
believe me it's very sharp and if this

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:11.730 
believe me it's very sharp and if this
would<00:05:10.240> be<00:05:10.270> a<00:05:10.390> full-length<00:05:10.870> bit<00:05:11.140> of<00:05:11.230> paracord<00:05:11.590> I

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:11.740 
would be a full-length bit of paracord I

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:12.840 
would be a full-length bit of paracord I
would<00:05:11.890> cut<00:05:12.070> through<00:05:12.280> it<00:05:12.310> without<00:05:12.520> any

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:12.850 
would cut through it without any

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:15.930 
would cut through it without any
resistance<00:05:13.620> so<00:05:14.620> very<00:05:14.920> sharp<00:05:15.220> serrated<00:05:15.610> edge

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:15.940 
resistance so very sharp serrated edge

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:17.790 
resistance so very sharp serrated edge
holds<00:05:16.420> an<00:05:16.510> edge<00:05:16.630> longer<00:05:16.660> but<00:05:17.380> it's<00:05:17.530> harder<00:05:17.770> to

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:17.800 
holds an edge longer but it's harder to

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.370 
holds an edge longer but it's harder to
shop<00:05:18.100> and<00:05:18.250> once<00:05:18.430> its<00:05:18.640> goal<00:05:18.820> once<00:05:19.090> it<00:05:19.480> goes<00:05:19.930> dull

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:20.380 
shop and once its goal once it goes dull

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:22.500 
shop and once its goal once it goes dull
I<00:05:20.650> carry<00:05:21.430> this<00:05:21.580> just<00:05:21.850> to<00:05:22.000> have<00:05:22.120> a<00:05:22.150> small

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:22.510 
I carry this just to have a small

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:25.170 
I carry this just to have a small
utility<00:05:22.780> knife<00:05:23.170> that<00:05:23.410> is<00:05:23.820> applicable<00:05:24.820> to<00:05:25.150> a

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:25.180 
utility knife that is applicable to a

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:27.360 
utility knife that is applicable to a
lot<00:05:25.390> of<00:05:25.510> different<00:05:25.810> situations<00:05:26.410> and<00:05:27.160> there

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:27.370 
lot of different situations and there

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:30.000 
lot of different situations and there
you<00:05:27.430> have<00:05:27.460> it<00:05:27.610> that's<00:05:27.880> my<00:05:28.120> my<00:05:28.510> EDC<00:05:28.960> ki<00:05:29.410> ki<00:05:29.680> ki

you have it that's my my EDC ki ki ki
kari<00:05:30.460> system<00:05:31.800> it's<00:05:32.800> not<00:05:33.070> really<00:05:33.250> a<00:05:33.400> system<00:05:33.850> but

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:34.240 
kari system it's not really a system but

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.820 
kari system it's not really a system but
I<00:05:34.270> just<00:05:34.600> have<00:05:34.780> a<00:05:34.810> couple<00:05:34.990> of<00:05:35.200> items<00:05:35.320> together<00:05:35.620> I

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:35.830 
I just have a couple of items together I

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:38.190 
I just have a couple of items together I
find<00:05:36.190> useful<00:05:36.610> so<00:05:36.820> the<00:05:37.030> only<00:05:37.360> items<00:05:37.960> that<00:05:38.110> I

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:38.200 
find useful so the only items that I

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.140 
find useful so the only items that I
would<00:05:38.380> say<00:05:38.590> our<00:05:38.830> survival<00:05:39.550> issue<00:05:39.760> or<00:05:40.030> that

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:40.150 
would say our survival issue or that

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:42.990 
would say our survival issue or that
light<00:05:40.420> or<00:05:41.050> the<00:05:41.110> knife<00:05:41.440> and<00:05:41.830> the<00:05:42.100> maybe<00:05:42.820> the

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:43.000 
light or the knife and the maybe the
