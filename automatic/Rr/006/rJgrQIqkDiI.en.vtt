00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.140 
bum bum bum bum bum but um so by keeping
this<00:02:11.590> straight<00:02:11.860> we<00:02:12.010> actually<00:02:12.459> kind<00:02:12.819> of<00:02:12.910> add<00:02:13.120> to

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
this straight we actually kind of add to

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.809 
this straight we actually kind of add to
the<00:02:13.830> to<00:02:14.830> the<00:02:14.950> sound<00:02:15.190> of<00:02:15.310> the<00:02:15.430> whole<00:02:15.580> thing

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 
the to the sound of the whole thing

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:18.030 
the to the sound of the whole thing
without<00:02:16.660> actually<00:02:17.200> doing<00:02:17.290> any<00:02:17.500> syncopated

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
without actually doing any syncopated

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.110 
without actually doing any syncopated
rhythm<00:02:18.220> move<00:02:20.549> so<00:02:21.549> let's<00:02:21.700> try<00:02:21.849> doing<00:02:21.940> that

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
rhythm move so let's try doing that

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.460 
rhythm move so let's try doing that
together<00:02:22.299> just<00:02:22.540> a<00:02:22.780> little<00:02:22.989> bit<00:02:23.079> so<00:02:23.260> you<00:02:23.349> can

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
together just a little bit so you can

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.000 
together just a little bit so you can
get<00:02:23.620> used<00:02:24.280> to<00:02:24.459> the<00:02:24.989> the<00:02:25.989> feel<00:02:26.200> of<00:02:26.230> those<00:02:26.620> chords

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
get used to the the feel of those chords

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.490 
get used to the the feel of those chords
descending<00:02:27.700> the<00:02:28.510> one<00:02:29.049> of<00:02:29.140> the<00:02:29.200> tricky<00:02:29.470> things

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
descending the one of the tricky things

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:30.720 
descending the one of the tricky things
which<00:02:29.799> doesn't<00:02:30.220> seem<00:02:30.310> like<00:02:30.459> it<00:02:30.610> would<00:02:30.670> be

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
which doesn't seem like it would be

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.030 
which doesn't seem like it would be
tricky<00:02:31.090> is<00:02:31.209> that<00:02:31.420> only<00:02:32.140> one<00:02:32.530> of<00:02:32.560> these<00:02:32.709> chords

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
tricky is that only one of these chords

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.580 
tricky is that only one of these chords
is<00:02:33.160> minor<00:02:33.340> and<00:02:33.430> that's<00:02:33.640> the<00:02:33.760> first<00:02:33.970> chord<00:02:34.590> and

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
is minor and that's the first chord and

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:36.979 
is minor and that's the first chord and
the<00:02:35.769> other<00:02:35.890> times<00:02:36.160> you're<00:02:36.250> gonna<00:02:36.370> stick<00:02:36.640> that

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
the other times you're gonna stick that

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:40.229 
the other times you're gonna stick that
middle<00:02:37.989> finger<00:02:38.019> down<00:02:38.379> to<00:02:38.440> get<00:02:38.680> the<00:02:38.769> third<00:02:39.239> so

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
middle finger down to get the third so

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:41.940 
middle finger down to get the third so
gonna<00:02:40.360> be<00:02:40.510> easy<00:02:41.079> to<00:02:41.230> kind<00:02:41.410> of<00:02:41.470> confuse<00:02:41.799> that

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
gonna be easy to kind of confuse that

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.800 
gonna be easy to kind of confuse that
sometimes<00:02:42.430> like<00:02:42.700> hit<00:02:43.090> a<00:02:43.120> major<00:02:43.390> chord<00:02:43.720> at

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
sometimes like hit a major chord at

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.420 
sometimes like hit a major chord at
first<00:02:46.260> something<00:02:47.260> like<00:02:47.500> equally<00:02:47.980> wrong<00:02:48.160> like

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
first something like equally wrong like

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:49.860 
first something like equally wrong like
that<00:02:48.459> so<00:02:48.819> just<00:02:49.060> be<00:02:49.359> careful<00:02:49.540> and<00:02:49.750> remember

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
that so just be careful and remember

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.750 
that so just be careful and remember
only<00:02:50.170> the<00:02:50.380> C<00:02:50.530> is<00:02:50.680> minor<00:02:50.920> so<00:02:51.340> that's<00:02:51.489> gonna<00:02:51.670> be

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
only the C is minor so that's gonna be

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.699 
only the C is minor so that's gonna be
your<00:02:52.359> middle<00:02:52.480> fingers<00:02:52.750> gonna<00:02:52.900> be<00:02:53.049> up<00:02:53.230> and<00:02:53.650> then

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
your middle fingers gonna be up and then

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:55.410 
your middle fingers gonna be up and then
it's<00:02:54.069> gonna<00:02:54.190> come<00:02:54.370> back<00:02:54.459> down<00:02:54.670> for<00:02:54.730> the<00:02:55.030> rest

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
it's gonna come back down for the rest

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.949 
it's gonna come back down for the rest
of<00:02:55.510> the<00:02:55.600> descent<00:02:56.380> there<00:02:57.690> we'll<00:02:58.690> do<00:02:58.780> a<00:02:58.840> little

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
of the descent there we'll do a little

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:00.809 
of the descent there we'll do a little
bit<00:02:59.079> slower<00:02:59.380> than<00:02:59.500> the<00:02:59.650> record<00:02:59.889> it's<00:03:00.609> not<00:03:00.639> too

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:00.819 
bit slower than the record it's not too

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:03.960 
bit slower than the record it's not too
fast<00:03:01.030> of<00:03:01.269> a<00:03:01.329> song<00:03:01.540> so<00:03:01.959> you<00:03:01.989> should<00:03:02.889> be<00:03:02.980> the

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
fast of a song so you should be the

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.009 
fast of a song so you should be the
biggest<00:03:04.269> challenge<00:03:04.690> is<00:03:04.750> gonna<00:03:04.810> be<00:03:04.930> getting

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:05.019 
biggest challenge is gonna be getting

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:06.660 
biggest challenge is gonna be getting
those<00:03:05.349> bars<00:03:05.620> nice<00:03:05.950> and<00:03:06.130> clean<00:03:06.310> so<00:03:06.459> you<00:03:06.549> can

those bars nice and clean so you can
hear<00:03:06.790> all<00:03:06.880> the<00:03:06.910> notes<00:03:07.150> one<00:03:07.989> two<00:03:08.590> three<00:03:09.250> four

more time you can hear there I'm

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.050 
more time you can hear there I'm
implying<00:03:32.200> the<00:03:32.350> backbeat<00:03:32.710> by<00:03:32.950> accenting<00:03:33.700> every

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
implying the backbeat by accenting every

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:39.000 
implying the backbeat by accenting every
other<00:03:34.380> quarter<00:03:35.380> note<00:03:35.560> so<00:03:35.770> you<00:03:36.250> go<00:03:36.370> one<00:03:38.010> just

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
other quarter note so you go one just

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.500 
other quarter note so you go one just
hit<00:03:39.130> it<00:03:39.250> a<00:03:39.310> little<00:03:39.400> bit<00:03:39.640> harder<00:03:39.940> to<00:03:40.090> accent<00:03:42.510> and

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
hit it a little bit harder to accent and

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.180 
hit it a little bit harder to accent and
that's<00:03:43.630> gonna<00:03:43.750> help<00:03:43.990> imply<00:03:44.410> the<00:03:44.470> rhythm<00:03:45.100> of

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
that's gonna help imply the rhythm of

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.580 
that's gonna help imply the rhythm of
the<00:03:45.280> song<00:03:45.490> so<00:03:45.790> work<00:03:46.660> on<00:03:46.780> that<00:03:46.840> get<00:03:47.170> that<00:03:47.290> up<00:03:47.470> to

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
the song so work on that get that up to

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.010 
the song so work on that get that up to
speed<00:03:47.710> like<00:03:48.670> I<00:03:48.700> said<00:03:48.940> the<00:03:49.060> songs<00:03:49.270> not<00:03:49.510> super

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:50.020 
speed like I said the songs not super

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:54.180 
speed like I said the songs not super
fast<00:03:50.260> is<00:03:50.590> it<00:03:50.730> boom<00:03:51.760> about<00:03:52.540> there<00:03:52.980> so<00:03:53.980> we're<00:03:54.100> not

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
fast is it boom about there so we're not

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:55.890 
fast is it boom about there so we're not
going<00:03:54.340> to<00:03:54.370> be<00:03:54.550> blazing<00:03:55.450> through<00:03:55.570> this<00:03:55.720> or

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
going to be blazing through this or

going to be blazing through this or
anything<00:03:56.080> but<00:03:56.380> the<00:03:56.560> biggest<00:03:56.740> challenge<00:03:56.950> like

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:21.240 
in the intro we've covered that we're
doing<00:04:17.169> these<00:04:17.410> descending<00:04:17.919> bar<00:04:18.130> chords<00:04:20.250> when

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
doing these descending bar chords when

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:22.740 
doing these descending bar chords when
the<00:04:21.310> vocals<00:04:21.640> come<00:04:21.760> in<00:04:21.880> the<00:04:22.030> rhythm<00:04:22.180> changes

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
the vocals come in the rhythm changes

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:26.370 
the vocals come in the rhythm changes
just<00:04:23.080> slightly<00:04:23.490> just<00:04:24.490> to<00:04:24.610> emphasize<00:04:25.380> the

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
just slightly just to emphasize the

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.860 
just slightly just to emphasize the
vocal<00:04:26.710> which<00:04:26.860> does<00:04:27.100> this<00:04:27.250> little<00:04:27.660> push<00:04:28.660> it

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
vocal which does this little push it

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.610 
vocal which does this little push it
starts<00:04:29.680> right<00:04:30.010> before<00:04:30.400> a<00:04:30.430> measure<00:04:30.640> so<00:04:30.910> 1<00:04:31.600> 2<00:04:32.020> 3

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
starts right before a measure so 1 2 3

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.310 
starts right before a measure so 1 2 3
well<00:04:33.040> black<00:04:33.310> you<00:04:33.790> know<00:04:33.970> duh<00:04:34.870> so<00:04:35.080> it's<00:04:35.200> not

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
well black you know duh so it's not

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.800 
well black you know duh so it's not
right<00:04:35.590> on<00:04:35.620> the<00:04:35.770> beat<00:04:35.980> and<00:04:36.160> so<00:04:36.370> if<00:04:37.210> the<00:04:37.570> rhythm

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810 
right on the beat and so if the rhythm

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.540 
right on the beat and so if the rhythm
guitar<00:04:38.050> part<00:04:38.229> actually<00:04:38.650> plays<00:04:39.100> that<00:04:39.340> along

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:39.550 
guitar part actually plays that along

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.080 
guitar part actually plays that along
along<00:04:40.120> with<00:04:40.330> the<00:04:40.450> vocalist<00:04:40.810> so<00:04:42.000> it'll<00:04:43.000> sound

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.090 
along with the vocalist so it'll sound

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.850 
along with the vocalist so it'll sound
like<00:04:43.210> this<00:04:43.330> will<00:04:43.690> do<00:04:43.810> one<00:04:46.169> progression<00:04:47.169> how<00:04:47.800> we

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
like this will do one progression how we

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:49.560 
like this will do one progression how we
normally<00:04:48.370> would<00:04:48.580> like<00:04:48.820> we<00:04:48.940> did<00:04:49.090> in<00:04:49.180> the<00:04:49.240> intro

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:49.570 
normally would like we did in the intro

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:51.659 
normally would like we did in the intro
and<00:04:49.690> then<00:04:49.780> jump<00:04:50.560> into<00:04:50.770> like<00:04:51.100> where<00:04:51.280> the<00:04:51.370> vocals

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:51.669 
and then jump into like where the vocals

00:04:51.669 --> 00:05:01.950 
and then jump into like where the vocals
would<00:04:51.760> come<00:04:51.910> in<00:04:52.060> 2<00:04:52.600> 3<00:05:00.479> and<00:05:01.479> the<00:05:01.600> rest<00:05:01.750> is<00:05:01.930> just

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:01.960 
would come in 2 3 and the rest is just

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.400 
would come in 2 3 and the rest is just
the<00:05:02.260> same

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:03.410 
the same

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:06.280 
the same
so<00:05:04.330> then<00:05:05.330> what<00:05:05.420> happens<00:05:05.750> in<00:05:05.840> between<00:05:06.140> each

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:06.290 
so then what happens in between each

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:08.950 
so then what happens in between each
versus<00:05:06.680> we<00:05:06.800> do<00:05:06.980> one<00:05:07.630> one<00:05:08.630> progression

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 
versus we do one one progression

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.980 
versus we do one one progression
normally<00:05:09.860> so<00:05:10.310> straight<00:05:10.370> up<00:05:10.790> and<00:05:11.060> down<00:05:11.180> so<00:05:11.840> it

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:11.990 
normally so straight up and down so it

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:14.470 
normally so straight up and down so it
sounds<00:05:12.350> like<00:05:12.380> this<00:05:12.700> one<00:05:13.700> one<00:05:14.030> to<00:05:14.180> give<00:05:14.300> us<00:05:14.390> an

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:14.480 
sounds like this one one to give us an

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:21.400 
sounds like this one one to give us an
intro<00:05:17.800> get<00:05:18.800> no<00:05:18.950> monster<00:05:19.430> that's<00:05:20.410> it's

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:21.410 
intro get no monster that's it's

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:37.600 
intro get no monster that's it's
straight<00:05:22.600> I'm<00:05:23.600> gonna<00:05:23.690> push<00:05:23.930> this<00:05:24.110> one<00:05:36.580> we<00:05:37.580> just

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:37.610 
straight I'm gonna push this one we just

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:39.820 
straight I'm gonna push this one we just
hit<00:05:37.910> I'm<00:05:38.540> gonna<00:05:38.960> see<00:05:39.140> minor<00:05:39.320> and<00:05:39.470> we<00:05:39.530> just<00:05:39.710> hit

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:39.830 
hit I'm gonna see minor and we just hit

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:45.130 
hit I'm gonna see minor and we just hit
a<00:05:39.860> quarter<00:05:40.130> note<00:05:40.250> and<00:05:40.280> off<00:05:42.310> so<00:05:43.750> it's<00:05:44.750> kind<00:05:45.080> of

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:45.140 
a quarter note and off so it's kind of

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:48.220 
a quarter note and off so it's kind of
just<00:05:45.350> more<00:05:46.220> of<00:05:46.490> a<00:05:46.640> very<00:05:47.060> slight<00:05:47.330> change<00:05:47.690> but

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:48.230 
just more of a very slight change but

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:50.020 
just more of a very slight change but
can<00:05:48.350> be<00:05:48.470> kind<00:05:48.650> of<00:05:48.680> tricky<00:05:48.830> if<00:05:49.190> you're<00:05:49.400> if

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:50.030 
can be kind of tricky if you're if

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:53.140 
can be kind of tricky if you're if
you're<00:05:50.170> not<00:05:51.170> concentrating<00:05:51.530> so<00:05:52.040> let's<00:05:52.910> try<00:05:53.090> it

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:53.150 
you're not concentrating so let's try it

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:54.490 
you're not concentrating so let's try it
nice<00:05:53.300> and<00:05:53.330> slow<00:05:53.720> we're<00:05:53.960> going<00:05:54.080> to<00:05:54.170> do<00:05:54.260> one

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:54.500 
nice and slow we're going to do one

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:56.110 
nice and slow we're going to do one
straight<00:05:55.430> and<00:05:55.610> then<00:05:55.760> we're<00:05:55.850> gonna<00:05:55.940> do<00:05:56.090> the

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:56.120 
straight and then we're gonna do the

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.240 
straight and then we're gonna do the
push<00:05:56.420> and<00:05:56.750> then<00:05:57.410> back<00:05:57.530> straight<00:05:57.890> we'll<00:05:58.070> toggle

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:58.250 
push and then back straight we'll toggle

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:06.730 
push and then back straight we'll toggle
back<00:05:58.490> and<00:05:58.520> forth<00:05:58.700> a<00:06:00.310> one<00:06:01.310> two<00:06:01.970> three<00:06:02.270> four<00:06:05.740> here

with my tail in the air um I'd really

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:43.040 
with my tail in the air um I'd really
silly<00:06:39.390> lyrics<00:06:39.830> so<00:06:41.420> the<00:06:42.420> challenge<00:06:42.780> of<00:06:42.840> it<00:06:42.960> is

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:43.050 
silly lyrics so the challenge of it is

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:44.750 
silly lyrics so the challenge of it is
just<00:06:43.230> kind<00:06:43.470> of<00:06:43.620> making<00:06:44.190> it<00:06:44.430> stay<00:06:44.610> in<00:06:44.640> the

just kind of making it stay in the
groove<00:06:45.030> because<00:06:45.210> you've<00:06:45.450> got<00:06:45.570> a<00:06:45.600> hit<00:06:46.500> and<00:06:46.740> then

two three four so if you think of a

00:06:56.130 --> 00:07:00.230 
two three four so if you think of a
pulse<00:06:56.370> one<00:06:56.850> two<00:06:57.330> three<00:06:57.990> four<00:06:58.530> one<00:06:58.770> two<00:06:59.240> three
