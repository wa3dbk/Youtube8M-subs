when you want to glue onto glass metal

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.380 
when you want to glue onto glass metal
wood<00:00:29.500> and<00:00:29.800> it<00:00:30.190> really<00:00:30.550> holds<00:00:30.880> really<00:00:31.780> well<00:00:32.220> the

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
wood and it really holds really well the

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.920 
wood and it really holds really well the
nozzle<00:00:34.390> our<00:00:35.350> cap<00:00:35.740> comes<00:00:36.070> off<00:00:36.280> and<00:00:36.900> you<00:00:37.900> just

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:37.930 
nozzle our cap comes off and you just

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:41.770 
poke that end into it and then you can

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.100 
poke that end into it and then you can
use<00:00:41.980> the<00:00:42.280> nozzle<00:00:42.820> that<00:00:42.910> comes<00:00:43.060> with<00:00:43.360> it<00:00:43.390> or<00:00:43.780> you

use the nozzle that comes with it or you

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.610 
use the nozzle that comes with it or you
can<00:00:44.290> just<00:00:44.440> squeeze<00:00:44.739> it<00:00:44.950> out<00:00:45.130> on<00:00:45.340> to<00:00:46.620> your

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:47.620 
can just squeeze it out on to your

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:55.170 
can just squeeze it out on to your
cardboard<00:00:51.450> I'm<00:00:52.450> actually<00:00:52.840> up<00:00:53.290> cycling<00:00:54.030> one<00:00:55.030> of

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:55.180 
cardboard I'm actually up cycling one of

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.610 
cardboard I'm actually up cycling one of
the<00:00:55.500> other<00:00:56.500> glues<00:00:57.989> so<00:00:58.989> what<00:00:59.140> you<00:00:59.260> want<00:00:59.440> to<00:00:59.500> do

00:00:59.610 --> 00:00:59.620 
the other glues so what you want to do

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.310 
the other glues so what you want to do
is<00:00:59.800> use<00:01:00.130> your<00:01:00.430> glue<00:01:01.000> until<00:01:01.300> you<00:01:01.719> just<00:01:02.020> don't

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:02.320 
is use your glue until you just don't

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.259 
is use your glue until you just don't
have<00:01:02.530> any<00:01:02.680> more<00:01:02.770> left<00:01:03.190> and<00:01:03.579> so<00:01:04.089> you're<00:01:04.180> going

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:04.269 
have any more left and so you're going

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:06.570 
have any more left and so you're going
to<00:01:04.360> squeeze<00:01:04.600> it<00:01:04.780> all<00:01:04.900> out<00:01:05.110> use<00:01:05.440> it<00:01:05.650> and<00:01:05.830> then

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:06.580 
to squeeze it all out use it and then

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.280 
to squeeze it all out use it and then
keep<00:01:06.790> the<00:01:06.940> cap<00:01:07.150> off<00:01:07.330> so<00:01:07.600> all<00:01:07.840> the<00:01:08.020> remaining

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.290 
keep the cap off so all the remaining

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.530 
keep the cap off so all the remaining
which<00:01:08.890> won't<00:01:09.130> be<00:01:09.190> very<00:01:09.280> much<00:01:09.490> will<00:01:10.180> be<00:01:10.270> dried

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.540 
which won't be very much will be dried

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.960 
which won't be very much will be dried

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:28.119 
drill two holes on the top to attach to

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:29.340 
drill two holes on the top to attach to
the<00:01:28.210> jump<00:01:28.450> rings<00:01:28.659> that<00:01:28.840> we<00:01:28.930> just<00:01:29.080> showed<00:01:29.200> you

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
the jump rings that we just showed you

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:35.219 
the jump rings that we just showed you
at<00:01:29.590> the<00:01:29.619> bottom<00:01:30.369> of<00:01:30.490> the<00:01:30.640> container<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:34.229> what

at the bottom of the container and what
you're<00:01:35.380> going<00:01:35.470> to<00:01:35.590> do<00:01:35.740> is<00:01:36.070> you're<00:01:36.220> going<00:01:36.430> to

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
you're going to do is you're going to

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.080 
you're going to do is you're going to
take<00:01:36.990> some<00:01:37.990> fabric<00:01:38.409> strips<00:01:38.770> just<00:01:39.760> put<00:01:39.939> your

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
take some fabric strips just put your

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.980 
take some fabric strips just put your
glue<00:01:40.299> on<00:01:40.540> to<00:01:40.900> the<00:01:41.140> middle<00:01:41.470> part<00:01:42.220> of<00:01:42.490> the<00:01:42.990> empty

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
glue on to the middle part of the empty

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:58.469 
glue on to the middle part of the empty
glue<00:01:44.229> container<00:01:46.170> put<00:01:47.170> it<00:01:47.290> in

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:02.200 

and<00:01:59.479> because<00:02:00.110> it's<00:02:00.290> clear<00:02:00.740> it<00:02:01.550> works<00:02:01.760> perfect

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
and because it's clear it works perfect

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:07.840 
and because it's clear it works perfect
you<00:02:02.360> don't<00:02:02.540> see<00:02:02.840> it<00:02:06.220> and<00:02:07.220> you<00:02:07.280> just<00:02:07.580> continue

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
you don't see it and you just continue

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.170 
you don't see it and you just continue
to<00:02:08.149> glue<00:02:08.619> I'll<00:02:09.619> probably<00:02:09.920> about<00:02:10.459> three<00:02:10.820> strips

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
to glue I'll probably about three strips

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:19.420 
to glue I'll probably about three strips
up<00:02:11.870> the<00:02:12.230> container<00:02:13.660> like<00:02:14.660> so<00:02:16.420> and<00:02:18.010> then<00:02:19.010> I<00:02:19.250> have

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
up the container like so and then I have

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.760 
up the container like so and then I have
a<00:02:19.459> skirt<00:02:19.970> where<00:02:20.720> I've<00:02:20.840> just<00:02:21.140> done<00:02:21.320> a<00:02:21.380> running

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
a skirt where I've just done a running

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.270 
a skirt where I've just done a running
stitch<00:02:22.010> here<00:02:22.430> and<00:02:22.930> I<00:02:23.930> just<00:02:24.170> actually<00:02:24.860> just

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
stitch here and I just actually just

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.300 
stitch here and I just actually just
pull<00:02:25.520> that<00:02:25.550> the<00:02:26.030> thread<00:02:26.360> and<00:02:26.630> I<00:02:27.620> glue<00:02:27.860> that<00:02:28.040> on

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
pull that the thread and I glue that on

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.550 
pull that the thread and I glue that on
to<00:02:28.670> over<00:02:29.030> where<00:02:29.510> that<00:02:29.660> three<00:02:29.959> strips<00:02:30.260> just

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
to over where that three strips just

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.750 
to over where that three strips just
were<00:02:30.770> and<00:02:32.050> then<00:02:33.050> your<00:02:33.230> top<00:02:33.470> this<00:02:34.220> is<00:02:34.370> actually

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
were and then your top this is actually

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.970 
were and then your top this is actually
out<00:02:34.880> of<00:02:34.910> an<00:02:35.090> old<00:02:35.209> shirt<00:02:35.540> that<00:02:35.780> I<00:02:35.810> had<00:02:36.110> and<00:02:36.350> if

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
out of an old shirt that I had and if

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.280 
out of an old shirt that I had and if
you<00:02:37.010> just<00:02:37.250> cut<00:02:37.550> up<00:02:37.760> and<00:02:38.000> just<00:02:38.600> do<00:02:38.780> a<00:02:38.810> little<00:02:39.020> a

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
you just cut up and just do a little a

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.410 
you just cut up and just do a little a
few<00:02:39.650> little<00:02:39.739> slices<00:02:40.070> it<00:02:40.430> works<00:02:40.910> perfectly

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
few little slices it works perfectly

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.580 
few little slices it works perfectly
over<00:02:41.780> that<00:02:41.989> plastic<00:02:42.530> cap<00:02:43.870> next<00:02:44.870> we<00:02:45.080> also<00:02:45.260> have

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
over that plastic cap next we also have

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.140 
over that plastic cap next we also have
another<00:02:45.860> craft<00:02:46.520> stick<00:02:46.760> you're<00:02:46.910> going<00:02:47.060> to
