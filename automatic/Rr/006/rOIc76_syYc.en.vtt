00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:56.200
 current versions of the mp 230 and in the 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:58.270
 m 21 10 21 20 works the same 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:01.180
 way the only thing you have to do 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:03.670

 4 and print it on each hand letter but 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.979
 with a small reduction that wants 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:26.740
 say that your impressions are no longer going to 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:29.770

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:32.410
 reduced a little bit reduced but they're 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:35.440
