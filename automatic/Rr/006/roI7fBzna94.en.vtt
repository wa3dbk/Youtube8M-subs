00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.450
 a pass filter is replaced by an in 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.400
 fed water pump 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:26.590
 the filter makes the highest 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.660
 located point in this cleaning 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:31.750
 cycle from where the water is back in 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:33.700
 The pond flows back through the filter 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.739
 allow a higher oxygen 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:39.850
 offer and work on biological 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:40.930
 therefore more efficient and more efficient 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.090
 pollutants are caused by the 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.970
 filter system in biological mechanical 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:47.500
 processes removed from the water 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:49.600
 the sponges inside the filter 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.720
 become home after some time 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.610
 for the hard-working microorganisms too 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.760
 here are numerous versions in the 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:01:01.000
 view of function and comfort of 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.650
 oasis phil tomatis cws controls the 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.019
 water temperature and activated at 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:08.020
 requires self-cleaning and pumps so 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:10.030
 automatically remove the sludge from the filter 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:13.229
 for a comfortable cleaning of the 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:16.719
 filter sponges was also taken care of 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.969
 in devices such as the biotech screen matic 

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:21.039
 provide different filter media and 

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:24.299
 large settlement surfaces for the 

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:26.979
 optimal development of filter biology 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:29.469
 thanks to the rough protection shutdown 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:30.909
 inlet of the water is in the filter 

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:33.549
 also a lesser one 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:35.170
 cleaning required a 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:37.719
 automatically driven interval 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:40.659
 Cleaning the range far away 

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:42.700
 dirt from the filter system pass 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:44.979
 Filters are at all pond sizes 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.340
 used in particular with particles with 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:47.340
 fish painting and decorating
