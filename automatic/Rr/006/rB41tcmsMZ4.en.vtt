00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:48.860 
BMW part numbers right there and right

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:55.120 
BMW part numbers right there and right
here<00:00:50.350> 51<00:00:51.350> 11<00:00:51.830> 2<00:00:52.250> 6<00:00:52.940> 4<00:00:53.300> 0<00:00:53.780> 30<00:00:54.170> and<00:00:54.440> then<00:00:54.890> the<00:00:54.950> last

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:55.130 
here 51 11 2 6 4 0 30 and then the last

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:58.210 
here 51 11 2 6 4 0 30 and then the last
two<00:00:55.370> numbers<00:00:55.640> on<00:00:55.730> the<00:00:55.820> other<00:00:55.940> one<00:00:56.090> or<00:00:56.210> 2<00:00:56.360> 9<00:00:57.220> so

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:58.220 
two numbers on the other one or 2 9 so

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.610 
two numbers on the other one or 2 9 so
that<00:00:58.730> is<00:00:59.720> over<00:00:59.900> there<00:01:00.110> those<00:01:00.290> are<00:01:00.410> kind<00:01:00.559> of

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
that is over there those are kind of

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.689 
that is over there those are kind of
rare<00:01:00.830> and<00:01:01.250> then<00:01:02.239> this<00:01:02.450> tray<00:01:02.870> and<00:01:03.550> the<00:01:04.550> only

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
rare and then this tray and the only

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:05.800 
rare and then this tray and the only
reason<00:01:04.879> I<00:01:05.059> wanted<00:01:05.270> to<00:01:05.330> compare<00:01:05.660> these

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
reason I wanted to compare these

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.160 
reason I wanted to compare these
side-by-side<00:01:07.060> is<00:01:08.060> because<00:01:08.479> this<00:01:08.869> is<00:01:08.960> kind<00:01:09.110> of

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
side-by-side is because this is kind of

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:10.690 
side-by-side is because this is kind of
a<00:01:09.260> rare<00:01:09.410> opportunity<00:01:09.560> I<00:01:09.950> guess<00:01:10.130> for<00:01:10.340> me<00:01:10.460> in

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
a rare opportunity I guess for me in

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.359 
a rare opportunity I guess for me in
fact<00:01:11.000> to<00:01:11.270> compare<00:01:12.260> both<00:01:12.650> of<00:01:12.830> them<00:01:12.950> in<00:01:13.070> side<00:01:13.220> by

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369 
fact to compare both of them in side by

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:14.740 
fact to compare both of them in side by
side<00:01:13.640> since<00:01:13.970> it's<00:01:14.150> kind<00:01:14.300> of<00:01:14.390> weird<00:01:14.600> that<00:01:14.690> I

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
side since it's kind of weird that I

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.690 
side since it's kind of weird that I
have<00:01:14.899> both<00:01:15.110> of<00:01:15.140> them<00:01:15.350> in<00:01:15.590> my<00:01:16.070> possession<00:01:16.430> I'm

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
have both of them in my possession I'm

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.570 
have both of them in my possession I'm
about<00:01:16.880> to<00:01:17.030> sell<00:01:17.270> the<00:01:17.899> OEM<00:01:18.470> and<00:01:19.100> probably<00:01:19.430> keep

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 
about to sell the OEM and probably keep

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:20.740 
about to sell the OEM and probably keep
this<00:01:19.700> from<00:01:19.850> my<00:01:19.940> car<00:01:20.180> since<00:01:20.420> this<00:01:20.509> one's<00:01:20.690> a

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
this from my car since this one's a

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.139 
this from my car since this one's a
little<00:01:20.960> beat-up<00:01:21.140> and<00:01:21.640> you<00:01:22.640> don't<00:01:22.880> really<00:01:23.060> want

to put it on a 328i that's not really a

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:35.690 
give it to someone who actually can use

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:37.540 
give it to someone who actually can use
it<00:01:35.810> for<00:01:35.960> a<00:01:36.020> track<00:01:36.259> car<00:01:36.440> so<00:01:37.070> there's<00:01:37.250> the<00:01:37.340> part

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:37.550 
it for a track car so there's the part

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.450 
it for a track car so there's the part
number<00:01:37.820> in<00:01:38.180> the<00:01:38.240> middle<00:01:39.040> right<00:01:40.040> there<00:01:40.100> and

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
number in the middle right there and

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.300 
number in the middle right there and
that<00:01:40.610> part<00:01:40.910> number<00:01:41.060> is<00:01:41.619> well<00:01:42.619> it<00:01:42.890> only<00:01:42.979> says

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
that part number is well it only says

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.109 
that part number is well it only says
two<00:01:43.700> two<00:01:44.509> six<00:01:44.720> seven<00:01:44.990> four<00:01:45.560> five<00:01:45.830> seven<00:01:46.190> but

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 
two two six seven four five seven but

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:48.760 
two two six seven four five seven but
there's<00:01:47.420> more<00:01:47.630> to<00:01:47.869> it<00:01:47.900> than<00:01:48.020> that<00:01:48.170> I<00:01:48.350> know<00:01:48.619> it's

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
there's more to it than that I know it's

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.820 
there's more to it than that I know it's
a<00:01:48.860> long<00:01:49.369> string<00:01:49.700> of<00:01:49.729> numbers<00:01:50.229> but<00:01:51.229> it<00:01:51.680> is

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:51.830 
a long string of numbers but it is

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.880 
a long string of numbers but it is
authentic<00:01:52.159> OEM<00:01:52.670> BMW<00:01:53.600> and<00:01:54.200> this<00:01:54.380> one<00:01:54.560> I<00:01:54.590> believe

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
authentic OEM BMW and this one I believe

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.090 
authentic OEM BMW and this one I believe
is<00:01:55.369> MH<00:01:55.670> on<00:01:55.850> its<00:01:56.030> carbon<00:01:56.240> fiber<00:01:56.450> and<00:01:57.200> as<00:01:57.860> you<00:01:58.010> can

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
is MH on its carbon fiber and as you can

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.219 
is MH on its carbon fiber and as you can
see<00:01:58.280> the<00:01:58.369> difference<00:01:58.640> between<00:01:58.700> the<00:01:59.000> two<00:01:59.229> they

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
see the difference between the two they

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:02.980 
see the difference between the two they
are<00:02:00.490> much<00:02:01.490> much<00:02:01.970> different<00:02:02.210> splitters<00:02:02.869> in

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
are much much different splitters in

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.370 
are much much different splitters in
comparison<00:02:03.560> and<00:02:04.340> this<00:02:04.460> one<00:02:05.140> this<00:02:06.140> one's

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
comparison and this one this one's

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.020 
comparison and this one this one's
adjustable<00:02:06.890> as<00:02:07.010> well<00:02:07.159> so<00:02:07.430> it's<00:02:07.549> got<00:02:07.670> the<00:02:07.790> four

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
adjustable as well so it's got the four

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.880 
adjustable as well so it's got the four
it's<00:02:08.269> got<00:02:08.390> the<00:02:08.479> pre-drilled<00:02:08.840> holes<00:02:11.530> and<00:02:12.530> this

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
it's got the pre-drilled holes and this

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.030 
it's got the pre-drilled holes and this
one's<00:02:13.160> got<00:02:13.400> the<00:02:13.430> pre-drilled<00:02:13.850> holes<00:02:13.970> as<00:02:14.269> well

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.180 

so<00:02:18.040> it<00:02:18.220> would<00:02:18.340> sit<00:02:18.610> like<00:02:19.170> this<00:02:20.170> and<00:02:20.769> what's<00:02:21.010> so

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
so it would sit like this and what's so

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.580 
so it would sit like this and what's so
weird<00:02:21.879> about<00:02:22.060> this<00:02:22.360> splitter<00:02:22.780> is<00:02:23.230> that<00:02:23.440> it's

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
weird about this splitter is that it's

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.580 
weird about this splitter is that it's
comes<00:02:24.250> off<00:02:24.400> the<00:02:24.489> lightweight<00:02:24.879> but<00:02:25.290> it<00:02:26.290> feels

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
comes off the lightweight but it feels

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.080 
comes off the lightweight but it feels
like<00:02:27.810> wood<00:02:28.810> it's<00:02:29.739> kind<00:02:29.980> of<00:02:30.010> big<00:02:30.220> it's<00:02:30.910> really

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
like wood it's kind of big it's really

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.589 
like wood it's kind of big it's really
thick<00:02:31.560> this<00:02:32.560> is<00:02:32.709> very<00:02:32.890> sturdy<00:02:33.190> and<00:02:34.000> that's<00:02:34.360> why

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:34.599 
thick this is very sturdy and that's why

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:36.030 
thick this is very sturdy and that's why
I<00:02:34.660> think<00:02:34.840> a<00:02:35.080> lot<00:02:35.110> of<00:02:35.319> people<00:02:35.560> on<00:02:35.680> the<00:02:35.769> track

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
I think a lot of people on the track

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.920 
I think a lot of people on the track
won't<00:02:36.400> like<00:02:36.550> them<00:02:36.700> because<00:02:37.300> I've<00:02:37.510> never<00:02:37.690> seen

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
won't like them because I've never seen

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.500 
won't like them because I've never seen
one<00:02:38.080> in<00:02:38.110> person<00:02:38.200> before<00:02:38.860> but<00:02:38.890> this<00:02:39.220> is<00:02:39.510> really

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
one in person before but this is really

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.410 
one in person before but this is really
sturdy<00:02:41.220> seriously<00:02:42.220> it's<00:02:42.430> like<00:02:42.580> a<00:02:42.670> big<00:02:43.000> piece

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
sturdy seriously it's like a big piece

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.960 
sturdy seriously it's like a big piece
of<00:02:43.480> wood<00:02:43.720> it's<00:02:44.349> not<00:02:44.470> that<00:02:44.620> heavy<00:02:44.830> it's<00:02:45.700> kind<00:02:45.940> of

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
of wood it's not that heavy it's kind of

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:47.670 
of wood it's not that heavy it's kind of
heavy<00:02:46.120> for<00:02:46.420> I<00:02:46.599> guess<00:02:46.660> going<00:02:46.989> on<00:02:47.170> the<00:02:47.290> bottom<00:02:47.560> of

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
heavy for I guess going on the bottom of

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.740 
heavy for I guess going on the bottom of
your<00:02:47.709> car<00:02:48.010> but<00:02:48.220> if<00:02:48.910> you<00:02:49.030> have<00:02:49.180> it<00:02:49.269> reinforced

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
your car but if you have it reinforced

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.600 
your car but if you have it reinforced
properly<00:02:50.200> and<00:02:50.349> it's<00:02:50.470> probably<00:02:51.010> safe<00:02:53.099> but<00:02:54.099> the

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
properly and it's probably safe but the

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.610 
properly and it's probably safe but the
one<00:02:54.790> thing<00:02:55.030> that<00:02:55.329> when<00:02:55.870> I<00:02:55.900> first<00:02:56.170> picked<00:02:56.380> it<00:02:56.530> up

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
one thing that when I first picked it up

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.650 
one thing that when I first picked it up
I<00:02:56.769> was<00:02:56.829> actually<00:02:57.160> surprised<00:02:57.579> just<00:02:58.390> kind<00:02:58.630> of

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
I was actually surprised just kind of

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.030 
I was actually surprised just kind of
surprised<00:02:58.930> that<00:02:58.959> it<00:02:59.170> came<00:02:59.200> off<00:02:59.470> a<00:02:59.500> lightweight

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
surprised that it came off a lightweight

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.259 
surprised that it came off a lightweight
go<00:03:00.760> figure

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269 
go figure

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:03.030 
go figure
and<00:03:01.390> this<00:03:02.049> is<00:03:02.170> carbon<00:03:02.470> fiber<00:03:02.680> or<00:03:02.799> weighs

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
and this is carbon fiber or weighs

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.309 
and this is carbon fiber or weighs
probably<00:03:04.260> 10<00:03:05.260> pounds<00:03:05.709> maximum<00:03:07.170> and<00:03:08.170> that's

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319 
probably 10 pounds maximum and that's

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:09.990 
probably 10 pounds maximum and that's
just<00:03:08.590> a<00:03:08.709> thin<00:03:09.099> sheet<00:03:09.459> of<00:03:09.640> metal

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
just a thin sheet of metal

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.110 
just a thin sheet of metal
I<00:03:10.420> personally<00:03:11.319> not<00:03:11.650> going<00:03:11.799> to<00:03:11.860> bolt<00:03:12.099> it<00:03:12.280> using

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
I personally not going to bolt it using

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.940 
I personally not going to bolt it using
the<00:03:13.239> brackets<00:03:13.690> you<00:03:13.930> know<00:03:14.019> OEM<00:03:14.380> brackets<00:03:14.799> all

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
the brackets you know OEM brackets all

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.530 
the brackets you know OEM brackets all
that<00:03:15.160> I'm<00:03:15.280> probably<00:03:15.430> just<00:03:15.579> going<00:03:15.760> to<00:03:15.819> bolt

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
that I'm probably just going to bolt

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.130 
that I'm probably just going to bolt
into<00:03:16.720> the<00:03:16.840> car<00:03:17.049> and<00:03:17.230> fix<00:03:17.500> it<00:03:18.030> to<00:03:19.030> a<00:03:19.540> certain

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
into the car and fix it to a certain

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:21.990 
into the car and fix it to a certain
position<00:03:20.410> because<00:03:20.859> there's<00:03:21.010> no<00:03:21.130> point<00:03:21.370> it's

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
position because there's no point it's

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.870 
position because there's no point it's
just<00:03:22.120> a<00:03:22.329> show<00:03:22.540> car<00:03:22.750> I<00:03:22.810> guess<00:03:23.200> so<00:03:23.470> but<00:03:24.400> this

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
just a show car I guess so but this

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.640 
just a show car I guess so but this
one's<00:03:25.120> a<00:03:25.209> little<00:03:25.299> damaged<00:03:25.780> so<00:03:26.170> this<00:03:26.319> is<00:03:26.470> why<00:03:26.590> I

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
one's a little damaged so this is why I

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.300 
one's a little damaged so this is why I
kind<00:03:26.950> of<00:03:27.040> got<00:03:27.160> it<00:03:27.310> in<00:03:27.430> the<00:03:27.519> deal<00:03:28.950> you<00:03:29.950> can<00:03:30.100> see

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
kind of got it in the deal you can see

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.330 
kind of got it in the deal you can see
here<00:03:31.019> it's<00:03:32.019> been<00:03:32.170> biffed<00:03:32.680> a<00:03:32.859> little<00:03:33.130> bit

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
here it's been biffed a little bit

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.259 
here it's been biffed a little bit
rubbing<00:03:34.120> against<00:03:34.299> the<00:03:34.359> curb<00:03:34.660> so<00:03:36.000> you<00:03:37.000> can<00:03:37.120> see

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:37.269 
rubbing against the curb so you can see

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:38.900 
rubbing against the curb so you can see
