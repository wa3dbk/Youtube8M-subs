begin<00:00:18.990> with<00:00:19.109> the<00:00:19.260> bubble<00:00:19.619> that<00:00:20.010> is

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
begin with the bubble that is

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.370 
begin with the bubble that is
approximately<00:00:20.490> one<00:00:21.150> and<00:00:21.330> a<00:00:21.390> half<00:00:21.630> hands<00:00:22.080> width

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
approximately one and a half hands width

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.790 
approximately one and a half hands width
in<00:00:22.619> length<00:00:23.600> while<00:00:24.600> holding<00:00:25.050> onto<00:00:25.230> that<00:00:25.500> first

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
in length while holding onto that first

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.609 
in length while holding onto that first
bubble<00:00:26.160> so<00:00:26.340> it<00:00:26.460> does<00:00:26.640> not<00:00:26.820> untwist<00:00:27.590> make<00:00:28.590> a

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
bubble so it does not untwist make a

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.950 
bubble so it does not untwist make a
loop<00:00:28.980> twist<00:00:29.310> to<00:00:29.789> form<00:00:30.060> one<00:00:30.269> of<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.480> elephant's

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
loop twist to form one of the elephant's

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.250

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.040 
ears taking care to always twist in the
same<00:00:34.500> direction<00:00:34.800> now<00:00:35.700> make<00:00:36.420> another<00:00:36.809> loop

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
same direction now make another loop

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.500 
same direction now make another loop
twist<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.890> same<00:00:38.160> size<00:00:38.489> as<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:38.879> first<00:00:38.910> and

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
twist the same size as the first and

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:49.740 
twist the same size as the first and
lock<00:00:40.440> twist<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:41.430> two<00:00:41.730> loop<00:00:42.120> twists<00:00:42.629> together

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:49.750 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.560 

then<00:00:50.530> make<00:00:50.830> a<00:00:51.070> two-finger<00:00:51.730> bubble<00:00:51.880> for<00:00:52.540> the

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:52.570 
then make a two-finger bubble for the

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:58.729 
then make a two-finger bubble for the
neck

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739

lock<00:01:16.710> twist<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.790> two<00:01:18.060> three-finger<00:01:18.990> bubbles

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
lock twist the two three-finger bubbles

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:26.360 
lock twist the two three-finger bubbles
together<00:01:19.800> to<00:01:20.370> form<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.820> front<00:01:21.060> legs<00:01:25.340> make<00:01:26.340> a

together to form the front legs make a

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:33.110 
together to form the front legs make a
three-finger<00:01:27.120> bubble<00:01:27.480> for<00:01:27.870> the<00:01:27.900> torso<00:01:32.120> make

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:33.120 
three-finger bubble for the torso make

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:41.510 
three-finger bubble for the torso make
another<00:01:33.570> three-finger<00:01:34.530> bubble

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.599 

follow<00:01:42.210> this<00:01:42.570> with<00:01:42.840> yet<00:01:43.289> another

follow this with yet another

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:52.740 
follow this with yet another
three-finger<00:01:44.609> bubble

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.200 

lock<00:01:53.470> twist<00:01:53.740> the<00:01:54.280> second<00:01:54.700> and<00:01:54.880> third

lock twist the second and third

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.660 
lock twist the second and third
three-finger<00:01:56.050> bubbles<00:01:56.380> together<00:01:56.800> to<00:01:57.400> form

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
three-finger bubbles together to form

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:10.639 
three-finger bubbles together to form
the<00:01:57.850> back<00:01:57.880> legs

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.399 

to<00:02:11.099> make<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.430> trunk<00:02:11.700> curve<00:02:12.150> simply<00:02:13.019> bend<00:02:13.290> the

00:02:13.399 --> 00:02:13.409 
to make the trunk curve simply bend the

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:15.229 
to make the trunk curve simply bend the
balloon<00:02:13.739> in<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.069> direction<00:02:14.430> you<00:02:14.700> wish<00:02:14.909> and

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
balloon in the direction you wish and

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:27.000 
balloon in the direction you wish and
hold<00:02:15.629> for<00:02:15.989> a<00:02:16.019> few<00:02:16.200> seconds

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.130 

and<00:02:27.099> that<00:02:27.790> is<00:02:27.940> how<00:02:28.090> to<00:02:28.150> make<00:02:28.420> a<00:02:28.690> balloon

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
and that is how to make a balloon

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.069 
and that is how to make a balloon
