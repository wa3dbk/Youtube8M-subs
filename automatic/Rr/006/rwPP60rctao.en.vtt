00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:05.879
 nice guys welcome back and welcome to 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.259
 this video menu is the zetalab hd ed 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.059
 here we are with another that i use 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.290
 subject to 5 I state the fact that 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.790
 we will read to do something very precise 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.099
 there is no need to go to 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.660
 find at the home of cj which is precisely the 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.119
 character of san andreas 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.800
 so let's go straight away without thinking 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.119
 then nothing 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.189
 let's say it's really a lot 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.720
 exciting for me to come back then 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.939
 Now I'll show you where, of course 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.590
 it is located the house should be from 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.050
 otherwise these parts really are 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.579
 we go so empty because of me 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.559
 remember that there was in these parts 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.270
 precisely in the southern part of the map 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.250
 there was this hairdresser who if not 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.320
 this part should be wrong 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.989
 so let's go straight away as I said 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.170
 really exciting for me because 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:47.940
 having grown up having spent part 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.620
 of childhood playing san andreas 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.500
 maybe go back to that area 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.570
 relive moments for the first time in 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.550
 which I played or really has to san 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.620
 andreas where I really spent le 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.989
 hours at the time is really a lot 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.390
 get excited so I hope it is too 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.400
 for you so I don't even know if maybe 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.439
 gives the possibility to unlock some 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.880
 goal something in particular but that 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.439
 I really do not think so 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.400
 so this is what we are here with 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:15.840
 ester we can define it this way vi 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.299
 let's say something to discover 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.229
 on the map for those who may not yet be 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.000
 aware 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.390
 so nothing I will show you now 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.159
 once again precisely where 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.810
 the house is obviously located I did 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:31.500
 too quickly then before then 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:34.619
 excuse me in these parts 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.840
 ok we can see with the front 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.920
 hope they are and that because if 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.130
 we are screwed 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:44.340
 obviously he misses so he aims 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.439
 so there should be many things 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.479
 innovative to be discovered therefore obviously 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.460
 I just know something new maybe if 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.439
 I know if you find out too 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.479
 leave me a comment below way 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.820
 such rivers organize to make us maybe 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.759
 some particular videos if not 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:02.100
 I'm wrong I want to spoil something but 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:05.219
 I had actually heard they told me it is 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.380
 present also the rich character 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:10.140
 precisely of gta iv so I don't know if it is a 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.700
 however pecorone of the genus is always from 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.940
 to see 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.950
 maybe just I know something more than the 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:19.930
 let's see we should be anyway 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:23.420
 arrived as always I was wrong 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:27.290
 as always let's try to go into the 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:31.760
 case really not like i say here ok 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:35.510
 it's not god we remembered this 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:38.390
 perfect world there is this or what the fuck 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.430
 the car the purple car should 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:45.160
 there were gangs too, these parts 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:48.440
 very cool we steal immediately of course 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:50.420
 so this is the part where it should 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:54.110
 this would be the home of cj I would not 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:57.200
 but to contradict myself I believe it is this or 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:59.480
 This is truly an our thing 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.670
 play with this graphic altogether 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.380
 different so no guys I hope 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.880
 that this video a little short of respect 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.440
 you liked the others 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.940
 so nothing the zeta sky 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.890
 blast of yes gets pissed off with a 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.450
 brand new video so good life 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.739
 leaving nice I like to be caught with 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.739
 the next beautiful video
