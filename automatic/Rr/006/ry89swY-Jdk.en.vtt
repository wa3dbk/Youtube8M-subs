the gap between console pc i think the

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:18.500 
the gap between console pc i think the
consoles<00:02:17.190> are<00:02:17.340> really<00:02:17.730> holding<00:02:18.030> Keemun<00:02:18.330> back

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
consoles are really holding Keemun back

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.420 
consoles are really holding Keemun back
that<00:02:18.720> they're<00:02:18.840> really<00:02:19.410> just<00:02:19.440> they've<00:02:19.980> got<00:02:20.220> to

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
that they're really just they've got to

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:21.710 
that they're really just they've got to
their<00:02:20.580> peak<00:02:20.819> you<00:02:21.030> know<00:02:21.120> you<00:02:21.240> look<00:02:21.330> at<00:02:21.480> battle

their peak you know you look at battle

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.870 
their peak you know you look at battle
phase<00:02:21.900> three<00:02:22.200> I<00:02:22.410> mean<00:02:22.830> that's<00:02:23.280> the<00:02:23.520> best<00:02:23.700> you

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
phase three I mean that's the best you

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.370 
phase three I mean that's the best you
can<00:02:23.940> get<00:02:24.060> out<00:02:24.150> of<00:02:24.270> at<00:02:24.360> nine<00:02:24.540> you<00:02:25.050> know<00:02:25.170> unless

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
can get out of at nine you know unless

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.050 
can get out of at nine you know unless
and<00:02:25.650> it<00:02:25.770> that<00:02:25.920> we<00:02:26.190> can<00:02:26.370> prove<00:02:26.550> is<00:02:26.730> the<00:02:26.819> best<00:02:26.970> you

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
and it that we can prove is the best you

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.949 
and it that we can prove is the best you
know<00:02:27.180> because<00:02:27.450> they<00:02:27.510> have<00:02:27.600> to<00:02:27.660> dumb<00:02:27.810> it<00:02:27.840> down

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
know because they have to dumb it down

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.199 
know because they have to dumb it down
big<00:02:28.380> time<00:02:28.560> from<00:02:28.800> the<00:02:28.890> pc<00:02:29.190> version<00:02:29.220> so<00:02:30.030> it's

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
big time from the pc version so it's

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.449 
big time from the pc version so it's
definitely<00:02:30.690> time<00:02:30.870> for<00:02:30.930> next-gen<00:02:31.410> console<00:02:31.890> and

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
definitely time for next-gen console and

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:33.650 
definitely time for next-gen console and
then<00:02:32.550> all<00:02:32.670> I<00:02:32.760> people<00:02:32.970> saying<00:02:33.120> what<00:02:33.420> could<00:02:33.540> they

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
then all I people saying what could they

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.690

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
add well all they need is a much better

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.240 
add well all they need is a much better
graphics<00:02:36.450> and<00:02:36.690> much<00:02:37.470> better<00:02:37.650> memory<00:02:38.100> in<00:02:38.220> my

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
graphics and much better memory in my

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.680 
graphics and much better memory in my
opinion<00:02:38.580> but<00:02:38.760> we'll<00:02:38.880> get<00:02:38.970> to<00:02:39.030> that<00:02:39.120> the<00:02:39.540> other

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
that's gonna be increased memory but

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.520 
that's gonna be increased memory but
also<00:03:31.769> I<00:03:31.920> want<00:03:32.250> to<00:03:32.310> see<00:03:32.549> you<00:03:32.820> know<00:03:33.180> GTA<00:03:33.660> 5<00:03:34.049> mops

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
really really big even bigger and that's

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.009 
really really big even bigger and that's
going<00:03:41.790> to<00:03:41.850> take<00:03:41.940> a<00:03:42.000> lot<00:03:42.180> of<00:03:42.239> memory<00:03:42.630> now

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
going to take a lot of memory now

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:45.110 
going to take a lot of memory now
actually<00:03:43.380> I<00:03:43.410> do<00:03:43.530> hope<00:03:43.829> not<00:03:44.310> just<00:03:44.730> the<00:03:44.850> off

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
actually I do hope not just the off

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.330 
actually I do hope not just the off
topic<00:03:45.510> a<00:03:45.720> little<00:03:45.780> bit<00:03:46.049> here<00:03:46.230> um<00:03:46.709> I<00:03:46.829> do<00:03:47.010> actually

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
topic a little bit here um I do actually

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.300 
topic a little bit here um I do actually
think<00:03:47.820> that<00:03:47.880> GTA<00:03:48.750> 5<00:03:49.079> could<00:03:49.530> be<00:03:49.709> released<00:03:50.040> on

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
think that GTA 5 could be released on

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.210 
think that GTA 5 could be released on
the<00:03:50.730> next<00:03:51.120> gen<00:03:51.239> console<00:03:51.630> um<00:03:52.290> and<00:03:52.739> possibly

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
the next gen console um and possibly

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.009 
the next gen console um and possibly
even<00:03:53.340> the<00:03:53.670> next<00:03:53.910> tray<00:03:54.060> are<00:03:54.209> call<00:03:54.420> of<00:03:54.540> duty<00:03:54.780> so

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
even the next tray are call of duty so

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:56.870 
even the next tray are call of duty so
that<00:03:55.650> would<00:03:55.769> be<00:03:55.859> pretty<00:03:56.100> that<00:03:56.400> would<00:03:56.489> be<00:03:56.579> too

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
that would be pretty that would be too

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.940 
that would be pretty that would be too
pretty<00:03:57.150> awesome<00:03:57.630> lineups<00:03:58.380> to<00:03:58.560> get<00:03:58.709> you<00:03:58.829> know

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:10.459 
would expect a hell of a lot more memory

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:12.620 
would expect a hell of a lot more memory
because<00:04:11.459> remember<00:04:11.579> the<00:04:11.850> first<00:04:12.060> starkey<00:04:12.390> can

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
because remember the first starkey can

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:14.090 
because remember the first starkey can
make<00:04:12.720> we're<00:04:12.840> like<00:04:12.959> you<00:04:13.410> get<00:04:13.650> were<00:04:13.799> like<00:04:13.920> no

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
memory in just like a little memory card

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.170 
memory in just like a little memory card
you<00:04:15.780> can<00:04:15.900> do<00:04:16.019> that<00:04:16.140> nine<00:04:16.320> i<00:04:17.039> would<00:04:17.519> also<00:04:17.640> expect

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
you can do that nine i would also expect

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:19.490 
you can do that nine i would also expect
now<00:04:18.479> this<00:04:18.660> is<00:04:18.810> this<00:04:18.989> is<00:04:19.109> one<00:04:19.260> of<00:04:19.289> the<00:04:19.410> things

now this is this is one of the things

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.800 
now this is this is one of the things

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.850 
card I just broke their their state
cards<00:04:35.550> yeah<00:04:35.760> they<00:04:36.150> could<00:04:36.810> hold<00:04:36.990> a<00:04:37.110> lot<00:04:37.500> amount

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
cards yeah they could hold a lot amount

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.130 
cards yeah they could hold a lot amount
of<00:04:37.980> memory<00:04:38.130> and<00:04:38.460> that<00:04:39.120> damn<00:04:39.480> things<00:04:39.810> are<00:04:39.990> you

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:40.140 
of memory and that damn things are you

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:41.630 
of memory and that damn things are you
know<00:04:40.230> the<00:04:40.380> memory<00:04:40.770> is<00:04:40.860> increasing<00:04:41.340> increased

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:41.640 
know the memory is increasing increased

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.030 
know the memory is increasing increased
constantly<00:04:42.150> on<00:04:42.240> them<00:04:42.390> things<00:04:42.600> and<00:04:43.530> also<00:04:43.770> they

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.040 
constantly on them things and also they

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.100 
constantly on them things and also they
could<00:04:44.220> use<00:04:44.400> maybe<00:04:44.550> USB<00:04:44.970> 2.2<00:04:45.510> or<00:04:45.540> three<00:04:45.900> point

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
could use maybe USB 2.2 or three point

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:47.870 
could use maybe USB 2.2 or three point
though<00:04:46.260> because<00:04:46.920> uh<00:04:47.190> not<00:04:47.370> only<00:04:47.400> that<00:04:47.610> but<00:04:47.670> it'd

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 
though because uh not only that but it'd

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.300 
though because uh not only that but it'd
be<00:04:47.910> faster<00:04:48.180> rate<00:04:48.540> of<00:04:48.660> transfer<00:04:48.990> and<00:04:49.320> also

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.310 
be faster rate of transfer and also

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.010 
be faster rate of transfer and also
another<00:04:50.910> good<00:04:51.150> point<00:04:51.330> the<00:04:51.480> guns<00:04:51.630> for<00:04:51.750> hire<00:04:51.870> me

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
another good point the guns for hire me

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.620 
another good point the guns for hire me
it<00:04:52.110> is<00:04:52.230> less<00:04:52.680> movable<00:04:53.190> parts<00:04:53.460> so<00:04:53.820> you<00:04:53.880> know<00:04:54.150> if

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:54.630 
it is less movable parts so you know if

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:55.910 
it is less movable parts so you know if
you<00:04:54.690> got<00:04:54.870> a<00:04:54.930> something<00:04:55.230> to<00:04:55.290> spend<00:04:55.590> the<00:04:55.710> disc

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:55.920 
you got a something to spend the disc

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.110 
you got a something to spend the disc
and<00:04:56.130> read<00:04:56.340> in<00:04:56.430> the<00:04:56.490> desk<00:04:56.700> you<00:04:56.850> know<00:04:56.910> that's

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 
and read in the desk you know that's

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.520 
and read in the desk you know that's
more<00:04:57.330> likely<00:04:57.690> to<00:04:57.900> break<00:04:58.020> and<00:04:58.170> that's<00:04:58.290> a<00:04:58.350> very

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530 
more likely to break and that's a very

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.020 
more likely to break and that's a very
common<00:04:58.710> thing<00:04:58.890> the<00:04:59.130> bricks<00:04:59.370> and<00:04:59.550> the<00:04:59.610> consoles

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:00.030 
common thing the bricks and the consoles

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:01.880 
common thing the bricks and the consoles
compared<00:05:00.630> to<00:05:00.690> you<00:05:01.170> know<00:05:01.260> something<00:05:01.620> in<00:05:01.710> the

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:01.890 
compared to you know something in the

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:03.650 
compared to you know something in the
des<00:05:02.190> which<00:05:02.460> never<00:05:02.910> really<00:05:03.180> breaks<00:05:03.360> the<00:05:03.510> reader

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:03.660 
des which never really breaks the reader

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:06.140 
des which never really breaks the reader

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:07.650 
about that is do the cut through the
