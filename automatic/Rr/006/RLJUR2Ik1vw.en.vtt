Rockets very well I didn't do a very
good<00:03:27.269> job<00:03:27.360> on<00:03:27.510> this<00:03:27.720> first<00:03:27.930> two<00:03:29.599> so<00:03:30.599> the

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
good job on this first two so the

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:32.960 
good job on this first two so the
easiest<00:03:31.769> way<00:03:31.920> to<00:03:31.950> do<00:03:32.159> it<00:03:32.280> is<00:03:32.430> just<00:03:32.459> wait<00:03:32.819> for

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
easiest way to do it is just wait for

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:33.920 
easiest way to do it is just wait for
him<00:03:33.120> to<00:03:33.239> jump

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
him to jump

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.380 
him to jump
whoops<00:03:34.709> jump<00:03:35.579> once<00:03:35.790> and<00:03:36.030> then<00:03:36.120> jump<00:03:36.329> the

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
whoops jump once and then jump the

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.720 
whoops jump once and then jump the
second<00:03:36.750> time<00:03:36.930> he<00:03:37.590> usually<00:03:37.739> does<00:03:38.069> a<00:03:38.310> kind<00:03:38.459> of<00:03:38.549> a

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
second time he usually does a kind of a

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:39.920 
second time he usually does a kind of a
skip

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
skip

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:47.690 
skip
he<00:03:40.530> jumps<00:03:40.859> once<00:03:41.540> really

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.270 

really<00:03:48.270> kind<00:03:48.480> of<00:03:48.569> small<00:03:49.080> and<00:03:49.830> then<00:03:49.920> he<00:03:50.010> jumps

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
really kind of small and then he jumps

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:56.000 
really kind of small and then he jumps
the<00:03:50.340> second<00:03:50.700> time<00:03:50.850> really<00:03:51.330> high<00:03:51.480> in<00:03:51.600> New<00:03:51.690> Year

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.980 

also<00:03:57.010> the<00:03:57.310> Gatling<00:03:57.790> gun<00:03:57.820> doesn't<00:03:58.690> bear<00:03:58.810> amount

00:03:58.980 --> 00:03:58.990 
also the Gatling gun doesn't bear amount

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:00.360 
also the Gatling gun doesn't bear amount
of<00:03:59.080> damage<00:03:59.290> to<00:03:59.440> him<00:03:59.560> and<00:03:59.770> it<00:03:59.860> can<00:04:00.040> hurt<00:04:00.190> him

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
of damage to him and it can hurt him

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.940 
of damage to him and it can hurt him
from<00:04:00.580> your<00:04:00.670> very<00:04:00.880> far<00:04:01.090> distance<00:04:01.450> away<00:04:01.600> so<00:04:02.500> you

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
from your very far distance away so you

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.070 
from your very far distance away so you
can<00:04:03.100> see<00:04:03.130> to<00:04:03.370> distance<00:04:03.730> from<00:04:03.850> him<00:04:04.030> as<00:04:04.570> you<00:04:04.900> use

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:05.080 
can see to distance from him as you use

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:44.800 
can see to distance from him as you use
it

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:46.840 

and<00:04:44.930> if<00:04:45.560> he's<00:04:45.710> walking<00:04:45.919> around<00:04:46.370> down<00:04:46.610> below

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:46.850 
and if he's walking around down below

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:49.800 
and if he's walking around down below
you<00:04:47.770> staying<00:04:48.770> on<00:04:48.889> top<00:04:49.100> that<00:04:49.280> little<00:04:49.520> building

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:49.810 
you staying on top that little building

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:52.450 
you staying on top that little building
will<00:04:50.810> make<00:04:50.930> it<00:04:51.080> virtually<00:04:51.590> impossible<00:04:51.860> for

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
will make it virtually impossible for

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:53.730 
will make it virtually impossible for
him<00:04:52.580> the<00:04:52.639> Haitian<00:04:52.880> is<00:04:52.970> a<00:04:53.060> rocket<00:04:53.389> launcher

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
him the Haitian is a rocket launcher

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.590 
him the Haitian is a rocket launcher
because<00:04:54.740> he's<00:04:55.310> shooting<00:04:55.639> directly<00:04:56.120> at<00:04:56.270> you<00:04:56.450> or

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:56.600 
because he's shooting directly at you or

because he's shooting directly at you or
not<00:04:56.840> doneghy<00:04:57.680> with<00:04:57.800> the<00:04:57.889> height<00:04:58.070> advantage

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:58.630 
not doneghy with the height advantage

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:00.970 
not doneghy with the height advantage
and<00:04:59.630> then<00:04:59.750> if<00:04:59.840> he's<00:05:00.020> up<00:05:00.230> above<00:05:00.470> you<00:05:00.620> like<00:05:00.770> that

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:00.980 
and then if he's up above you like that

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:04.420 
and then if he's up above you like that
try<00:05:01.280> to<00:05:01.310> keep<00:05:01.520> the<00:05:01.820> that<00:05:02.480> little<00:05:03.430> building

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.430 
try to keep the that little building

00:05:04.430 --> 00:06:16.429 
try to keep the that little building
between<00:05:04.730> you<00:05:05.090> and<00:05:05.240> him

00:06:16.429 --> 00:06:16.439 

00:06:16.439 --> 00:06:19.369
