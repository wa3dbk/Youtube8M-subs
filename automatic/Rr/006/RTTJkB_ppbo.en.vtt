00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
is my hair it is freshly washed but it's

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.290 
is my hair it is freshly washed but it's
been<00:00:53.160> a<00:00:53.190> couple<00:00:53.370> hours<00:00:53.640> my<00:00:54.059> hair<00:00:54.210> is

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
been a couple hours my hair is

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.580 
been a couple hours my hair is
relatively<00:00:54.780> thick<00:00:55.020> so<00:00:55.199> it<00:00:55.289> doesn't<00:00:55.469> take<00:00:55.559> a

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
relatively thick so it doesn't take a

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.260 
relatively thick so it doesn't take a
while<00:00:55.800> to<00:00:55.829> dry<00:00:56.129> it's<00:00:56.370> probably<00:00:56.730> about<00:00:56.940> halfway

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
while to dry it's probably about halfway

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.360 
while to dry it's probably about halfway
dry<00:00:57.780> right<00:00:58.050> now<00:00:58.260> but<00:00:58.829> I'm<00:00:58.920> gonna<00:00:59.070> add<00:00:59.340> some

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
dry right now but I'm gonna add some

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.729 
dry right now but I'm gonna add some
mousse<00:01:00.359> to<00:01:01.199> it

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
mousse to it

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.770 
mousse to it
to<00:01:02.010> give<00:01:02.609> itself<00:01:02.820> a<00:01:02.940> little<00:01:03.059> bit<00:01:03.180> of<00:01:03.359> texture

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
to give itself a little bit of texture

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.950 
to give itself a little bit of texture
so<00:01:03.930> that<00:01:04.350> it'll<00:01:04.830> help<00:01:05.070> stick<00:01:05.610> into<00:01:06.270> these

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
so that it'll help stick into these

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.520 
so that it'll help stick into these
actual<00:01:07.380> curly<00:01:08.130> thingies<00:01:08.610> this<00:01:09.390> is<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.869> got<00:01:10.320> to

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
actual curly thingies this is the got to

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.539 
actual curly thingies this is the got to
be<00:01:10.710> kinkier<00:01:11.670> double<00:01:12.090> curling<00:01:12.630> power<00:01:13.250> loss<00:01:14.250> and

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
be kinkier double curling power loss and

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.850 
be kinkier double curling power loss and
defined<00:01:15.270> curling<00:01:15.990> juice

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.430 

so<00:01:20.370> just<00:01:20.790> putting<00:01:21.090> that<00:01:21.180> all<00:01:21.360> over<00:01:21.420> my<00:01:21.870> hands

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:22.440

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
and then just kind of scrunching it into

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:35.560 
and then just kind of scrunching it into
my<00:01:26.460> ends

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.220

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:43.550 
big handfuls of it and then just kind of

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:45.610 
big handfuls of it and then just kind of
run<00:01:43.760> the<00:01:43.880> leftovers<00:01:44.450> through<00:01:45.140> the<00:01:45.260> top<00:01:45.440> of<00:01:45.560> my

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
all the way down I make sure that I

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.790 
all the way down I make sure that I
cover<00:02:17.470> those<00:02:18.470> ends<00:02:19.160> with<00:02:19.850> the<00:02:20.390> hair<00:02:20.680> that<00:02:21.680> I'm

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:12.240 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.200 

and<00:03:12.690> if<00:03:12.960> you<00:03:13.080> do<00:03:13.290> have<00:03:13.560> layers<00:03:14.070> in<00:03:14.520> your<00:03:14.550> hair

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:15.210 
and if you do have layers in your hair

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:17.030 
and if you do have layers in your hair
you<00:03:15.480> definitely<00:03:15.660> want<00:03:15.900> to<00:03:15.990> keep<00:03:16.170> that<00:03:16.410> in<00:03:16.470> mind

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
you definitely want to keep that in mind

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.200 
you definitely want to keep that in mind
try<00:03:17.850> to<00:03:17.910> go<00:03:18.360> with<00:03:19.050> the<00:03:19.440> layers<00:03:19.710> and<00:03:20.520> only<00:03:20.880> use

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:21.210 
try to go with the layers and only use

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:23.570 
try to go with the layers and only use
parts<00:03:21.870> that<00:03:22.110> are<00:03:22.230> at<00:03:22.380> that<00:03:22.410> one<00:03:22.980> particular

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
parts that are at that one particular

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.280 
parts that are at that one particular
length<00:03:23.880> instead<00:03:24.360> of<00:03:24.450> trying<00:03:24.720> to<00:03:24.780> mix<00:03:25.080> your

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
length instead of trying to mix your

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:31.610 
length instead of trying to mix your
hair<00:03:25.560> all<00:03:25.830> together

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.899 

just<00:03:32.129> twisting<00:03:32.790> until<00:03:33.209> I<00:03:33.239> feel<00:03:33.780> like<00:03:34.200> it<00:03:34.500> is

00:03:34.899 --> 00:03:34.909 
just twisting until I feel like it is

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:40.759 
just twisting until I feel like it is
secure<00:03:35.909> enough<00:03:36.150> I<00:03:38.209> also<00:03:39.209> must<00:03:40.019> say<00:03:40.379> these

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
secure enough I also must say these

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:43.699 
secure enough I also must say these
things<00:03:41.159> are<00:03:41.549> not<00:03:41.940> the<00:03:42.900> most<00:03:43.049> comfortable<00:03:43.650> to

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
things are not the most comfortable to

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:46.390 
things are not the most comfortable to
sleep<00:03:44.010> in<00:03:44.370> I<00:03:44.640> remember<00:03:45.390> I<00:03:45.420> used<00:03:45.750> to<00:03:45.989> use

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
sleep in I remember I used to use

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.360 
sleep in I remember I used to use
regular<00:03:47.400> like<00:03:47.849> old-school<00:03:48.269> foam<00:03:48.900> rollers<00:03:49.560> in

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
regular like old-school foam rollers in

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.309 
regular like old-school foam rollers in
like<00:03:50.760> my<00:03:51.120> middle<00:03:51.480> school<00:03:51.599> and<00:03:52.170> high<00:03:52.290> school

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 
like my middle school and high school

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:55.490 
like my middle school and high school
days<00:03:52.890> and<00:03:53.700> those<00:03:53.940> are<00:03:54.329> definitely<00:03:54.900> much

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
days and those are definitely much

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.619 
days and those are definitely much
easier<00:03:55.950> to<00:03:56.459> sleep<00:03:56.670> in<00:03:56.879> and<00:03:57.090> then<00:03:57.180> these<00:03:57.329> things

00:03:57.619 --> 00:03:57.629 
easier to sleep in and then these things

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:02.000 
easier to sleep in and then these things
are<00:03:57.860> because<00:03:58.860> they<00:03:59.129> have<00:03:59.370> like<00:04:00.650> plastic<00:04:01.650> right

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
are because they have like plastic right

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.460 
are because they have like plastic right
in<00:04:02.250> the<00:04:02.400> middle<00:04:02.730> of<00:04:03.090> them<00:04:03.329> and<00:04:03.510> the<00:04:03.959> ends<00:04:04.349> are

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
in the middle of them and the ends are

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:07.190 
in the middle of them and the ends are
hard<00:04:04.799> plastic<00:04:05.519> so<00:04:05.910> like<00:04:06.480> the<00:04:06.599> ends<00:04:07.049> of<00:04:07.140> the

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
hard plastic so like the ends of the

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.960 
hard plastic so like the ends of the
parts<00:04:07.470> that<00:04:07.530> really<00:04:07.799> like<00:04:07.950> stab<00:04:08.400> you<00:04:08.730> when

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
parts that really like stab you when

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:42.870 
parts that really like stab you when
you're<00:04:09.120> trying<00:04:09.269> to<00:04:09.450> sleep

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.790 

if<00:04:43.880> at<00:04:44.120> any<00:04:44.330> point<00:04:44.449> during<00:04:45.050> the<00:04:45.350> night<00:04:45.380> you

feel like they are kind of coming loose

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:49.240 
feel like they are kind of coming loose

right so it's now morning time as you
can<00:05:20.240> tell<00:05:20.479> because<00:05:20.720> I<00:05:20.930> don't<00:05:21.289> sound<00:05:21.590> as

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:21.800 
can tell because I don't sound as

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.550 
can tell because I don't sound as
excited<00:05:22.400> as<00:05:22.639> I<00:05:22.849> did<00:05:23.030> yesterday<00:05:23.349> but<00:05:24.349> I'm<00:05:24.440> gonna

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:24.560 
excited as I did yesterday but I'm gonna

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.890 
excited as I did yesterday but I'm gonna
take<00:05:24.860> out<00:05:25.099> all<00:05:25.490> of<00:05:25.520> my<00:05:25.699> thingies<00:05:26.300> and<00:05:26.330> we'll

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:26.900 
take out all of my thingies and we'll

00:05:26.900 --> 00:06:00.240 
take out all of my thingies and we'll
see<00:05:27.229> what<00:05:27.710> it<00:05:27.800> looks<00:05:27.830> like

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:00.250 

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:03.040 

so<00:06:01.250> now<00:06:01.550> I'm<00:06:01.760> just<00:06:01.910> gonna<00:06:02.090> go<00:06:02.360> through<00:06:02.690> and

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:03.050 
so now I'm just gonna go through and

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:05.050 
so now I'm just gonna go through and
they<00:06:03.380> kind<00:06:03.650> of<00:06:03.770> get<00:06:03.920> it<00:06:04.010> but<00:06:04.190> separate<00:06:04.730> them

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:05.060 
they kind of get it but separate them

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:12.189 
they kind of get it but separate them
with<00:06:05.480> my<00:06:05.690> fingers

00:06:12.189 --> 00:06:12.199 

00:06:12.199 --> 00:06:14.900 

some<00:06:13.199> of<00:06:13.290> these<00:06:13.350> back<00:06:13.620> ones<00:06:13.919> are<00:06:14.250> still<00:06:14.880> a

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:14.910 
some of these back ones are still a

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:17.450 
some of these back ones are still a
little<00:06:15.240> damp<00:06:15.690> so<00:06:16.080> I<00:06:16.650> probably<00:06:16.949> could<00:06:17.370> have

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:17.460 
little damp so I probably could have

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:21.350 
little damp so I probably could have
done<00:06:17.520> a<00:06:18.150> little<00:06:18.840> better<00:06:19.320> at<00:06:20.270> making<00:06:21.270> the

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:21.360 
done a little better at making the

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.000 
done a little better at making the
sections<00:06:21.750> a<00:06:21.810> little<00:06:21.840> smaller<00:06:22.290> so<00:06:22.710> that<00:06:22.740> they

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:23.010 
sections a little smaller so that they

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:33.360 
sections a little smaller so that they
would<00:06:23.160> dry<00:06:23.400> overnight

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:33.370 

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:35.800 

so<00:06:34.370> this<00:06:34.610> is<00:06:34.699> pretty<00:06:34.849> much<00:06:34.970> all<00:06:35.180> I'm<00:06:35.330> gonna<00:06:35.539> do

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:35.810 
so this is pretty much all I'm gonna do

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:37.540 
so this is pretty much all I'm gonna do
I'm<00:06:35.990> not<00:06:36.169> gonna<00:06:36.289> add<00:06:36.530> any<00:06:36.740> more<00:06:36.860> product<00:06:37.160> cuz<00:06:37.460> I

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:37.550 
I'm not gonna add any more product cuz I

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:39.100 
I'm not gonna add any more product cuz I
did<00:06:37.699> have<00:06:37.879> that<00:06:38.120> mousse<00:06:38.389> in<00:06:38.690> it<00:06:38.780> last<00:06:39.020> night

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:39.110 
did have that mousse in it last night

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:40.990 
did have that mousse in it last night
you<00:06:39.349> could<00:06:39.590> add<00:06:39.770> some<00:06:40.009> extra<00:06:40.340> hairspray<00:06:40.819> if

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:41.000 
you could add some extra hairspray if

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.149 
you could add some extra hairspray if
you<00:06:41.120> like<00:06:41.330> just<00:06:41.870> to<00:06:41.990> try<00:06:42.229> to<00:06:42.259> keep<00:06:42.530> them<00:06:42.770> going

00:06:43.149 --> 00:06:43.159 
you like just to try to keep them going

00:06:43.159 --> 00:06:45.969 
you like just to try to keep them going
a<00:06:43.520> little<00:06:43.639> longer<00:06:44.150> today<00:06:44.419> during<00:06:45.080> the<00:06:45.259> day<00:06:45.409> but

00:06:45.969 --> 00:06:45.979 
a little longer today during the day but

00:06:45.979 --> 00:06:48.279 
a little longer today during the day but
I<00:06:46.009> will<00:06:46.190> say<00:06:46.370> they<00:06:46.520> lose<00:06:46.759> a<00:06:46.789> lot<00:06:47.210> of<00:06:47.599> their<00:06:47.930> curl

00:06:48.279 --> 00:06:48.289 
I will say they lose a lot of their curl

00:06:48.289 --> 00:06:49.360 
I will say they lose a lot of their curl
throughout<00:06:48.800> the<00:06:48.979> day

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:49.370 
throughout the day

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:51.520 
throughout the day
this<00:06:49.909> is<00:06:50.000> definitely<00:06:50.240> not<00:06:50.539> a<00:06:50.930> hairstyle<00:06:51.349> I

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:51.530 
this is definitely not a hairstyle I

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:53.860 
this is definitely not a hairstyle I
would<00:06:51.710> say<00:06:51.949> everyone<00:06:52.400> would<00:06:52.789> go<00:06:53.000> for<00:06:53.360> they<00:06:53.810> do

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:53.870 
would say everyone would go for they do

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:55.960 
would say everyone would go for they do
lose<00:06:54.319> a<00:06:54.379> lot<00:06:54.830> of<00:06:54.860> their<00:06:55.099> curl<00:06:55.400> throughout<00:06:55.819> the

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:55.970 
lose a lot of their curl throughout the

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:57.159 
lose a lot of their curl throughout the
day<00:06:56.090> so<00:06:56.150> by<00:06:56.419> the<00:06:56.479> end<00:06:56.569> of<00:06:56.780> the<00:06:56.870> day<00:06:56.990> it's

00:06:57.159 --> 00:06:57.169 
day so by the end of the day it's

00:06:57.169 --> 00:06:59.170 
day so by the end of the day it's
probably<00:06:57.590> a<00:06:57.620> lot<00:06:57.830> nicer<00:06:58.039> for<00:06:58.759> what<00:06:59.000> most

00:06:59.170 --> 00:06:59.180 
probably a lot nicer for what most

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:00.760 
probably a lot nicer for what most
people<00:06:59.479> are<00:06:59.509> looking<00:06:59.810> for<00:07:00.020> just<00:07:00.169> for<00:07:00.409> more<00:07:00.650> of
