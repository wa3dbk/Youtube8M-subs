00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
see there's no DPR chip for it so it'd

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:56.309 
see there's no DPR chip for it so it'd
be<00:03:52.970> harder<00:03:53.420> to<00:03:53.450> turn<00:03:53.870> it<00:03:54.079> into<00:03:54.170> a<00:03:54.260> digital<00:03:54.440> car

00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:56.319 
be harder to turn it into a digital car

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:58.420 
be harder to turn it into a digital car
which<00:03:57.319> is<00:03:57.349> actually<00:03:57.709> quite<00:03:57.799> surprising<00:03:58.190> cuz

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
which is actually quite surprising cuz

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.270 
which is actually quite surprising cuz
most<00:03:58.639> new<00:03:58.849> cars<00:03:59.000> have<00:03:59.470> DPR<00:04:00.470> but<00:04:00.980> this<00:04:01.099> one

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
most new cars have DPR but this one

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:17.380 
most new cars have DPR but this one
that's<00:04:03.030> just<00:04:03.300> a<00:04:03.420> look<00:04:03.570> at<00:04:03.720> the<00:04:03.780> bomb
