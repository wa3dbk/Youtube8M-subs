this is unrelated to the video let me

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.910 
this is unrelated to the video let me
know<00:02:59.150> eleven<00:02:59.720> 1/2<00:02:59.900> 12<00:03:00.200> I<00:03:00.380> will<00:03:00.500> buy<00:03:00.650> it<00:03:00.680> from

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
know eleven 1/2 12 I will buy it from

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.950 
know eleven 1/2 12 I will buy it from
you<00:03:01.070> so<00:03:01.520> we<00:03:01.640> saw<00:03:01.820> all<00:03:02.060> that<00:03:02.180> package<00:03:02.600> that<00:03:02.780> came

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:02.960 
you so we saw all that package that came

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:04.510 
you so we saw all that package that came
in<00:03:03.110> soaring<00:03:03.440> online<00:03:03.770> now<00:03:03.950> there<00:03:04.100> was<00:03:04.220> two

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:04.520 
in soaring online now there was two

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.820 
in soaring online now there was two
packages<00:03:05.030> that<00:03:05.180> were<00:03:05.360> exclusive<00:03:05.780> to<00:03:06.020> in<00:03:06.410> store

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 
packages that were exclusive to in store

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.640 
packages that were exclusive to in store
the<00:03:07.310> first<00:03:07.640> is<00:03:07.850> a<00:03:07.880> wood<00:03:08.180> box<00:03:08.450> here<00:03:08.930> so<00:03:09.080> on<00:03:09.620> the

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
the first is a wood box here so on the

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.560 
the first is a wood box here so on the
lid<00:03:09.980> here<00:03:10.280> you<00:03:10.430> have<00:03:10.580> concepts<00:03:11.180> and<00:03:11.330> this<00:03:11.390> is

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:11.570 
lid here you have concepts and this is

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:13.660 
lid here you have concepts and this is
written<00:03:11.780> in<00:03:11.960> runes<00:03:12.260> so<00:03:13.160> it<00:03:13.220> spells<00:03:13.520> out

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
written in runes so it spells out

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.370 
written in runes so it spells out
concepts<00:03:14.210> and<00:03:14.390> runes<00:03:14.570> and<00:03:14.930> then<00:03:15.140> you<00:03:15.230> have

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
concepts and runes and then you have

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.800 
concepts and runes and then you have
this<00:03:15.530> very<00:03:15.740> interesting<00:03:16.400> kinds<00:03:17.360> of<00:03:17.480> puzzle

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
this very interesting kinds of puzzle

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:19.450 
this very interesting kinds of puzzle
box<00:03:18.020> aspect<00:03:18.620> to<00:03:18.710> it<00:03:18.740> so<00:03:18.860> you'll<00:03:19.100> notice<00:03:19.310> you

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:19.460 
box aspect to it so you'll notice you

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:21.820 
box aspect to it so you'll notice you
can't<00:03:19.730> lift<00:03:19.970> this<00:03:20.150> up<00:03:20.420> until<00:03:21.200> you<00:03:21.350> set<00:03:21.650> the

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:21.830 
can't lift this up until you set the

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:24.250 
can't lift this up until you set the
code<00:03:22.130> so<00:03:22.490> if<00:03:22.700> you<00:03:22.820> turn<00:03:23.090> the<00:03:23.390> dots<00:03:23.630> to<00:03:23.900> light<00:03:24.080> up

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
code so if you turn the dots to light up

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.250 
code so if you turn the dots to light up
here<00:03:24.560> the<00:03:24.890> Box<00:03:25.130> does<00:03:25.820> open<00:03:26.330> and<00:03:26.540> swings

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
here the Box does open and swings

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.530 
here the Box does open and swings
forward<00:03:27.590> to<00:03:27.920> release<00:03:28.220> to<00:03:28.880> reveal<00:03:29.180> the<00:03:29.360> inside

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
forward to release to reveal the inside

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.230 
forward to release to reveal the inside
another<00:03:30.530> fun<00:03:30.860> thing<00:03:30.890> about<00:03:31.160> this<00:03:31.550> too<00:03:31.880> is<00:03:32.090> if

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:32.240 
another fun thing about this too is if

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.030 
another fun thing about this too is if
you'll<00:03:32.390> notice<00:03:32.660> the<00:03:32.930> position<00:03:33.110> of<00:03:33.710> these

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
you'll notice the position of these

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.190 
you'll notice the position of these
little<00:03:34.280> dots<00:03:34.520> as<00:03:34.850> if<00:03:35.000> it<00:03:35.120> was<00:03:35.270> a<00:03:35.300> clock<00:03:35.630> it

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
little dots as if it was a clock it

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.530 
little dots as if it was a clock it
actually<00:03:36.620> is<00:03:36.740> doing<00:03:37.040> seven<00:03:37.520> the<00:03:37.820> number<00:03:38.120> one

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
actually is doing seven the number one

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.840 
actually is doing seven the number one
and<00:03:38.900> five<00:03:39.230> the<00:03:39.710> Seekers<00:03:40.040> released<00:03:40.370> in<00:03:40.550> July

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
and five the Seekers released in July

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:44.160 
and five the Seekers released in July
2015<00:03:41.470> so<00:03:42.470> that's<00:03:42.620> another<00:03:42.920> cool<00:03:43.280> little<00:03:43.340> thing

2015 so that's another cool little thing
storytelling<00:03:45.170> aspect<00:03:45.320> to<00:03:45.650> the<00:03:45.740> packaging<00:03:46.250> so

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:46.520 
storytelling aspect to the packaging so

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.820 
storytelling aspect to the packaging so
the<00:03:46.610> wood<00:03:46.760> was<00:03:46.940> limited<00:03:47.330> to<00:03:47.450> 500<00:03:47.690> so<00:03:48.620> if<00:03:48.680> you

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:48.830 
the wood was limited to 500 so if you

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:50.830 
the wood was limited to 500 so if you
lined<00:03:49.340> up<00:03:49.550> at<00:03:49.730> either<00:03:49.910> concepts<00:03:50.420> Cambridge<00:03:50.780> or

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
lined up at either concepts Cambridge or

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.240 
lined up at either concepts Cambridge or
a<00:03:50.870> concept<00:03:51.200> in<00:03:51.350> New<00:03:51.440> York<00:03:51.650> you<00:03:51.770> were<00:03:51.890> able<00:03:52.190> to

a concept in New York you were able to

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:53.680 
a concept in New York you were able to
get<00:03:52.490> one<00:03:52.670> um<00:03:53.060> and<00:03:53.270> then<00:03:53.420> there<00:03:53.570> was<00:03:53.660> a
