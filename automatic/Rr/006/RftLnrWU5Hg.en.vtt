00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:15.090 
scarf and it's quite obviously fake not

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:16.550 
scarf and it's quite obviously fake not
because<00:00:15.270> the<00:00:15.510> patterns<00:00:15.930> wrong<00:00:16.139> you<00:00:16.320> could<00:00:16.500> be

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
because the patterns wrong you could be

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:17.749 
because the patterns wrong you could be
fooled<00:00:16.740> to<00:00:16.949> think<00:00:17.160> it's<00:00:17.279> real<00:00:17.460> because<00:00:17.580> of

00:00:17.749 --> 00:00:17.759 
fooled to think it's real because of

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:19.849 
fooled to think it's real because of
that<00:00:17.970> but<00:00:18.599> because<00:00:18.750> the<00:00:18.960> material<00:00:19.499> is<00:00:19.650> pure

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
that but because the material is pure

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.679 
that but because the material is pure
quality<00:00:20.099> and<00:00:20.550> you<00:00:20.669> can<00:00:20.699> tell<00:00:21.089> because<00:00:21.300> of<00:00:21.599> the

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
quality and you can tell because of the

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.569 
quality and you can tell because of the
attention<00:00:21.869> to<00:00:22.199> detail<00:00:22.560> that<00:00:22.829> it<00:00:23.160> just<00:00:23.339> isn't

00:00:23.569 --> 00:00:23.579 
attention to detail that it just isn't

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:25.790 
attention to detail that it just isn't
the<00:00:23.759> real<00:00:23.910> deal<00:00:24.179> so<00:00:24.509> for<00:00:25.320> example<00:00:25.679> the

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
the real deal so for example the

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.529 
the real deal so for example the
stitching<00:00:26.249> along<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.669> hem<00:00:26.880> is<00:00:27.179> quite

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
stitching along the hem is quite

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.050 
stitching along the hem is quite
obviously<00:00:28.019> been<00:00:28.560> dyeing<00:00:28.769> it<00:00:28.890> purely<00:00:29.460> it's

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
obviously been dyeing it purely it's

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.330 
obviously been dyeing it purely it's
actually<00:00:30.779> puckering<00:00:31.259> some<00:00:31.589> of<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:31.800> material

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
actually puckering some of the material

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.600 
actually puckering some of the material
at<00:00:32.460> points<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:33.510> material<00:00:33.960> is<00:00:34.080> certainly

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:34.610 
at points the material is certainly

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.070 
at points the material is certainly
rough<00:00:35.610> and<00:00:35.970> there<00:00:36.360> are<00:00:36.510> gaps<00:00:36.750> in<00:00:36.990> the

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:37.080 
rough and there are gaps in the

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.270 
rough and there are gaps in the
stitching<00:00:37.470> which<00:00:37.590> will<00:00:37.770> quite<00:00:38.010> quickly

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
stitching which will quite quickly

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.700 
stitching which will quite quickly
become<00:00:38.730> homes<00:00:38.970> and<00:00:39.840> also<00:00:40.020> it<00:00:40.290> lacks<00:00:40.470> any

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710
