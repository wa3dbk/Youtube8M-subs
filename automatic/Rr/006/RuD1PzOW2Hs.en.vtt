never<00:02:22.250> seen<00:02:22.490> um<00:02:23.500> you<00:02:24.500> don't<00:02:24.650> want<00:02:24.800> to<00:02:24.860> run<00:02:24.980> it

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
never seen um you don't want to run it

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.490 
never seen um you don't want to run it
any<00:02:25.250> tighter<00:02:25.490> than<00:02:25.760> 25,000<00:02:26.540> total<00:02:26.960> clearance

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
any tighter than 25,000 total clearance

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.440 
any tighter than 25,000 total clearance
so<00:02:27.830> it's<00:02:27.950> 12<00:02:28.160> and<00:02:28.250> a<00:02:28.340> half<00:02:28.400> hours<00:02:28.640> clearance

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
so it's 12 and a half hours clearance

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.500 
so it's 12 and a half hours clearance

per side at this point in the build I

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.000 
per side at this point in the build I
was<00:02:32.630> kind<00:02:32.810> of<00:02:32.870> freaking<00:02:33.290> out<00:02:33.380> if<00:02:33.620> you<00:02:33.709> look<00:02:33.860> at

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
was kind of freaking out if you look at

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.020 
was kind of freaking out if you look at
this<00:02:36.160> looks<00:02:37.160> like<00:02:37.280> there's<00:02:37.459> a<00:02:37.520> bunch<00:02:37.670> of<00:02:37.790> run

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
this looks like there's a bunch of run

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.390 
this looks like there's a bunch of run
out<00:02:38.150> on<00:02:38.300> that<00:02:38.480> shaft<00:02:38.830> one<00:02:39.830> left<00:02:40.040> to<00:02:40.130> right<00:02:40.280> in

out on that shaft one left to right in
the<00:02:40.430> back<00:02:40.610> here<00:02:41.170> actually<00:02:42.170> put<00:02:42.410> a<00:02:42.470> dial

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:42.740 
the back here actually put a dial

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.540 
the back here actually put a dial
indicator<00:02:43.100> on<00:02:43.310> I<00:02:43.340> came<00:02:43.610> up<00:02:43.730> with<00:02:43.760> 80,000<00:02:44.570> and

kind<00:02:46.550> of<00:02:46.640> freaked<00:02:46.850> out<00:02:47.000> I<00:02:47.209> took<00:02:47.270> to<00:02:47.540> the

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570 
kind of freaked out I took to the

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.650 
kind of freaked out I took to the
machine<00:02:47.930> shop<00:02:48.170> have<00:02:49.160> a<00:02:49.190> check<00:02:49.550> it<00:02:49.730> the<00:02:50.420> shaft

machine shop have a check it the shaft
itself<00:02:50.990> a<00:02:51.200> street<00:02:51.500> so<00:02:51.950> I<00:02:51.980> don't<00:02:52.310> just<00:02:52.459> run<00:02:52.610> over

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
itself a street so I don't just run over

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.610 
itself a street so I don't just run over
on<00:02:52.880> the<00:02:52.970> bearing<00:02:53.360> or<00:02:53.540> if<00:02:53.750> that<00:02:53.900> burns<00:02:54.200> either<00:02:54.410> a

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:57.770 
little bit crooked on concede there is

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.330 
little bit crooked on concede there is
some<00:02:58.070> play<00:02:58.340> in<00:02:58.730> the<00:02:59.090> bearing<00:03:00.040> Adam<00:03:01.040> chunk<00:03:01.250> up

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
some play in the bearing Adam chunk up

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.340 
some play in the bearing Adam chunk up
the<00:03:01.430> front<00:03:01.550> bearing<00:03:01.880> and<00:03:02.000> elated<00:03:02.209> and<00:03:02.570> they

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
the front bearing and elated and they

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:04.630 
the front bearing and elated and they
were<00:03:03.410> still<00:03:03.620> run<00:03:03.830> off<00:03:03.950> when<00:03:04.160> you<00:03:04.220> put<00:03:04.370> the<00:03:04.459> back

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
were still run off when you put the back

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.840 
were still run off when you put the back
Center<00:03:05.090> on<00:03:05.150> it<00:03:05.300> was<00:03:05.540> held<00:03:05.989> within<00:03:06.230> 5,000<00:03:07.130> so<00:03:07.820> I

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
Center on it was held within 5,000 so I

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:10.199 
Center on it was held within 5,000 so I
think<00:03:08.000> it's<00:03:08.180> gonna<00:03:08.330> be<00:03:08.420> okay<00:03:08.720> with<00:03:08.900> the<00:03:09.050> ball

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
think it's gonna be okay with the ball

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:12.970 
think it's gonna be okay with the ball
here<00:03:11.209> I<00:03:11.360> got<00:03:11.510> the<00:03:11.630> back<00:03:11.810> bowl<00:03:12.080> temporarily<00:03:12.680> on

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
here I got the back bowl temporarily on

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.000 
here I got the back bowl temporarily on
milking<00:03:13.400> power<00:03:14.290> and<00:03:15.290> I<00:03:15.380> looked<00:03:15.560> in<00:03:15.680> the<00:03:15.800> hand

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
milking power and I looked in the hand

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.789 
milking power and I looked in the hand
bowl<00:03:16.280> you<00:03:16.459> can<00:03:16.610> see<00:03:16.760> that<00:03:16.970> virtually<00:03:17.930> all<00:03:18.230> that

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:18.799 
bowl you can see that virtually all that

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:21.490 
bowl you can see that virtually all that
runoff<00:03:19.070> is<00:03:19.400> eliminated<00:03:19.880> when<00:03:20.090> the<00:03:20.269> back<00:03:21.019> half

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
runoff is eliminated when the back half

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.280 
runoff is eliminated when the back half
is<00:03:21.830> supported<00:03:22.580> by<00:03:22.700> the<00:03:22.760> bushings<00:03:23.239> so<00:03:24.110> I<00:03:24.140> think

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
is supported by the bushings so I think

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.620 
is supported by the bushings so I think
I'm<00:03:24.470> going<00:03:24.620> to<00:03:24.709> be<00:03:24.769> all<00:03:24.860> right<00:03:25.040> here<00:03:25.450> they<00:03:26.450> also

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
I'm going to be all right here they also

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.750 
I'm going to be all right here they also
said<00:03:26.989> you<00:03:27.019> want<00:03:27.230> about<00:03:27.290> 25,000<00:03:28.130> forward

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
said you want about 25,000 forward

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.220 
said you want about 25,000 forward
clearance<00:03:29.120> between<00:03:29.269> the<00:03:29.450> color<00:03:29.780> in<00:03:29.989> the<00:03:30.080> wear

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
clearance between the color in the wear

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.710 
clearance between the color in the wear
wearing<00:03:30.820> this<00:03:31.820> is<00:03:32.000> check<00:03:32.209> through<00:03:32.420> the<00:03:32.450> hand

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
wearing this is check through the hand

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.720 
wearing this is check through the hand
hole<00:03:33.310> unfortunately<00:03:34.310> I<00:03:34.340> don't<00:03:34.459> have<00:03:34.610> a

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
hole unfortunately I don't have a

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:36.039 
hole unfortunately I don't have a
shoulder<00:03:34.970> and<00:03:35.209> the<00:03:35.299> wear<00:03:35.480> ring<00:03:35.690> so<00:03:35.900> it's

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:36.049 
shoulder and the wear ring so it's

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:38.320 
shoulder and the wear ring so it's
likely<00:03:36.200> easy<00:03:36.530> to<00:03:36.680> measure

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:38.330 
likely easy to measure

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:42.020 
likely easy to measure
the<00:03:39.330> distance<00:03:39.750> between<00:03:40.620> this<00:03:40.890> collar<00:03:41.340> and<00:03:41.760> the

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
the distance between this collar and the

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.270 
the distance between this collar and the
wearing<00:03:42.510> is<00:03:42.630> both<00:03:42.780> the<00:03:42.930> same<00:03:43.200> so<00:03:44.010> to<00:03:44.070> get<00:03:44.220> a

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
wearing is both the same so to get a

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.740 
wearing is both the same so to get a
crude<00:03:44.580> measurement<00:03:45.000> I'm<00:03:45.300> just<00:03:45.510> going<00:03:45.660> to

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
crude measurement I'm just going to

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.120 
crude measurement I'm just going to
measure<00:03:45.870> through<00:03:46.410> the<00:03:46.530> hand<00:03:46.740> hole<00:03:46.950> between

the impeller and my liner now I'm going

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.280 
the impeller and my liner now I'm going
to<00:03:51.330> throw<00:03:51.480> this<00:03:51.600> some<00:03:51.810> color<00:03:52.020> around<00:03:52.110> hair<00:03:52.790> and

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 
80-foot poems I'm just going to slug it

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.749 
80-foot poems I'm just going to slug it
out<00:04:56.419> for<00:04:56.629> an<00:04:56.689> all<00:04:56.780> and<00:04:56.990> doing<00:04:57.199> my<00:04:57.289> second<00:04:57.759> and

00:04:58.749 --> 00:04:58.759 
out for an all and doing my second and

00:04:58.759 --> 00:05:00.189 
out for an all and doing my second and
through<00:04:59.030> the<00:04:59.150> hand<00:04:59.389> hole<00:04:59.599> I'm<00:04:59.900> going<00:05:00.020> to<00:05:00.080> take

00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:00.199 
through the hand hole I'm going to take

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:03.330 
through the hand hole I'm going to take
a<00:05:00.229> feeler<00:05:00.590> gauge<00:05:00.830> make<00:05:01.430> sure<00:05:02.020> that<00:05:03.020> at<00:05:03.169> least

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:03.340 
a feeler gauge make sure that at least

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:09.309 
a feeler gauge make sure that at least
25,000<00:05:04.340> clearance<00:05:04.729> here<00:05:08.050> what<00:05:09.050> I'm<00:05:09.139> doing

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:09.319 
25,000 clearance here what I'm doing

00:05:09.319 --> 00:05:10.450 
25,000 clearance here what I'm doing
here<00:05:09.439> is<00:05:09.500> a<00:05:09.620> really<00:05:09.860> crude<00:05:10.069> measurement

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:10.460 
here is a really crude measurement

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:11.770 
here is a really crude measurement
because<00:05:10.729> there<00:05:10.849> is<00:05:10.969> no<00:05:11.120> shoulder<00:05:11.539> on<00:05:11.659> that

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:11.780 
because there is no shoulder on that

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:14.080 
because there is no shoulder on that
where<00:05:11.990> I'm<00:05:12.259> just<00:05:12.590> measuring<00:05:12.969> between<00:05:13.969> the

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.090 
where I'm just measuring between the

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:18.159 
where I'm just measuring between the
impeller<00:05:14.360> and<00:05:14.719> the<00:05:14.990> liner<00:05:16.810> here's<00:05:17.810> the<00:05:17.990> back

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:18.169 
impeller and the liner here's the back

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:19.570 
impeller and the liner here's the back
of<00:05:18.349> it<00:05:18.500> you<00:05:18.530> can<00:05:18.740> see<00:05:18.919> that<00:05:18.949> there's<00:05:19.189> a<00:05:19.250> similar

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:19.580 
of it you can see that there's a similar

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:21.249 
of it you can see that there's a similar
more<00:05:19.729> clearance<00:05:20.150> between<00:05:20.360> that<00:05:20.659> shoulder<00:05:20.990> on

00:05:21.249 --> 00:05:21.259 
more clearance between that shoulder on

00:05:21.259 --> 00:05:26.290 
more clearance between that shoulder on
the<00:05:21.349> impeller<00:05:21.620> and<00:05:22.009> the<00:05:22.780> wearing<00:05:25.120> now<00:05:26.120> with

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:26.300 
the impeller and the wearing now with

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:27.850 
the impeller and the wearing now with
the<00:05:26.360> impeller<00:05:26.659> lock<00:05:26.930> nut<00:05:27.169> cranked<00:05:27.560> down<00:05:27.710> to

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:27.860 
the impeller lock nut cranked down to

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.709 
the impeller lock nut cranked down to
equality<00:05:28.310> equal<00:05:28.610> pumped<00:05:29.000> and<00:05:29.150> a<00:05:29.240> torque

00:05:29.709 --> 00:05:29.719 
equality equal pumped and a torque

00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:31.899 
equality equal pumped and a torque
wrench<00:05:29.870> it<00:05:30.050> would<00:05:30.139> work<00:05:30.289> on<00:05:30.440> that<00:05:30.620> a<00:05:30.800> couple<00:05:30.909> of

00:05:31.899 --> 00:05:31.909 
wrench it would work on that a couple of

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:34.480 
wrench it would work on that a couple of
words<00:05:32.060> with<00:05:32.300> that<00:05:32.509> is<00:05:33.069> what<00:05:34.069> actually<00:05:34.219> turns

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:34.490 
words with that is what actually turns

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:36.490 
words with that is what actually turns
the<00:05:34.729> impeller<00:05:35.000> is<00:05:35.240> the<00:05:35.360> key<00:05:35.629> on<00:05:35.840> the<00:05:35.960> shaft<00:05:36.199> not

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:36.500 
the impeller is the key on the shaft not

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.860 
the impeller is the key on the shaft not
the<00:05:36.680> nut<00:05:36.889> and<00:05:37.190> the<00:05:37.969> rotation<00:05:38.419> the<00:05:38.539> engine

the nut and the rotation the engine

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:40.689 
the nut and the rotation the engine
tends<00:05:39.110> to<00:05:39.229> keep<00:05:39.319> snot<00:05:39.560> tight<00:05:39.830> so<00:05:40.340> don't<00:05:40.610> get

00:06:03.399 --> 00:06:03.409 
putting that ring in a lot easier so I'm

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:04.779 
putting that ring in a lot easier so I'm
going<00:06:03.529> to<00:06:03.560> cheat<00:06:03.800> and<00:06:04.069> I'm<00:06:04.159> not<00:06:04.340> going<00:06:04.520> to<00:06:04.610> use

00:06:04.779 --> 00:06:04.789 
going to cheat and I'm not going to use

00:06:04.789 --> 00:06:05.980 
going to cheat and I'm not going to use
it<00:06:04.969> I'm<00:06:05.120> just<00:06:05.300> going<00:06:05.449> to<00:06:05.479> run<00:06:05.690> a<00:06:05.719> bead<00:06:05.930> of
