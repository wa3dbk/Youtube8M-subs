 now we're going to take this cream on fire 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.430
 low 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:59.509
 now we'll be stirring here without 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:02.759
 stop until the butter is dissolved 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:04.610
 and then thicken the cream 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.830
 when you have loosened the bottom of the pan 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:10.550
 and we are going 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:14.770
 the fire has almost 10 minutes that we 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:17.360
 we are here stirring until almost boiling 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:20.300
 You can stop fiddling if you do not stop. 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:24.370
 stir defeat 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:27.200
 We have to wait to dance people well. 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.450
 here is already releasing the corners of the 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.850
 pan 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.710

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:39.050
 burn 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:42.230
 now we'll get a third of this 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:44.870
 cream still warm and let's put on 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.180
 a bowl of chocolate 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.080
 we were stirring until melting the 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.080
 chocolate 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:55.459
 Are you seeing the hot cream we are? 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:59.540
 stirring without even the most massive 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:01.280
 melted everything chocolate looks on that part 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:06.380
 the cream that remained in the pan we go 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:10.000
 put it here syndication of everything let's move 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.000

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.930
 Now we are going to talk about our portrayal. 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:21.260
 with this white cream 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:23.480
 we put on the white cream platter 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.760
 with cashew nuts 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:31.360
 this crime is at room temperature 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:34.190
 It's not hot, it 's not chocolate either. 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.989
 he is hot he is not in temperature 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:38.000
 environment 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:41.810
 if we put hot chocolate 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.239
 on top of that cream they mix there 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:46.580
 it hurts the recipe we have sperafico 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:47.450

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:55.420
 melted in the shake over 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:07.760
 so we hit the chocolate in the 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:12.290
 way and now we can put the 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:14.620
 cherry and now we'll put the 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:20.230
