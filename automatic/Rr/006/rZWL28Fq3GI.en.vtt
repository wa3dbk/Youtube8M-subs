00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:06.620
 the Netherlands is

 further 

00:00:09.459 --> 00:00:10.260

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.260
 individuals can act 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.070
 I am myself 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.630
 almost fourteen 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:21.989

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:23.859
 it can know it 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:27.089
 well there you must make me start the year 

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:30.089
 and I really started a general liturgy 

00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:33.770
 to get estimates 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.770
 and after a week later 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.530
 off again 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.340

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:46.440
 with my team 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.380
 and you come there you are young you an uncertain I was very sure that is 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.340

 well 2010 

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.940
 I decided modeling now is just a real folk festival 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:10.050
 but then smaller 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.050
 so then I wonder 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.070
 and I had no winner at that time crucifying the American in Iraq 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.700
 the campaigns against gent in gent actually went my career 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:23.780

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.020
 walking on the street 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.220
 and how long they never run again and then the number of jobs the spurs took 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.520
