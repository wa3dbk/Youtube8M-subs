00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:07.500
 heading color our all hello we 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.050
 continue to study color 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:10.910
 the whole space hit the materials 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.050
 Margulis affairs today further 

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.929
 parse the technical information this is the second 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.360
 Part of the video if you have not seen the first 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.270
 I recommend taking a step back 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.019
 and attentive look 

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:24.039
 because i want you to understand that 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:26.599
 and why are we doing our main goal 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:28.629
 disperse the light make it more 

00:00:28.629 --> 00:00:30.969
 more interesting shades of yellow 

00:00:30.969 --> 00:00:33.010
 more shades of green 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.339
 more shades of blue and others 

00:00:35.339 --> 00:00:38.149
 flowers today we learn to block 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:40.059
 some colors like red 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:40.860
 magenta 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.260
 because the girl's face would say 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.240
 so more red 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.510
 and if we saturate him too much 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.250
 given color it may be unreal 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.710
 and this is bad other colors because of this 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:53.809
 will suffer 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:55.739
 that is, we will not be able to raise and brand 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:56.840
 saturation 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.270
 today we will learn pretty quickly and 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.700
 just block this limit 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.449
 create a certain threshold a certain compressor 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:05.720
 literally like music 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.690
 which will hold red 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:09.730
 color and at the same time allows us 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:11.860
 make the rest of the flowers more 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:12.799
 saturated 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:15.319
 if you understand how to use this 

00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:17.709
 tool data tool you 

00:01:17.709 --> 00:01:19.819
 take a big step forward in cyto 

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:21.960
 collections go and boy mod 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.220
 whites by 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.660
 I specifically make a picture with a normal 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.240
 flowers and know the rum that is and 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.159
 exported 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:30.979
 normalized color according to the advice of alexander 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:33.249
 Bulbova well, thanks to him in general 

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:35.670
 normal color without contrast without 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.270
 is capable of pakistan 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:38.930
 brute force curves 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.090
 and other tools oyat rum 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.620
 we make a new layer curves xii choose 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.070
 our beer point there is a point from his 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.600
 Choose the tool of Lipetsk six consul 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.719
 klich on the neutral area 

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:53.039
 that is, an area that is not red 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:54.779
 which is inhabited which is not yellow 

00:01:54.779 --> 00:01:56.440
 which is not blue 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.900
 which is not dark which we are 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.850
 We carry the upper part of the curve of mid-dollars 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.180
 that is, the distance between sawing Pont 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:05.080
 her game 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.040
 there must be an example 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.219
 such a contrast we get 

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:11.619
 I personally love less contrast given 

00:02:11.619 --> 00:02:14.059
 case so I am a little university 

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.889
 by 40 

00:02:14.889 --> 00:02:16.669
 further hotel curve 

00:02:16.669 --> 00:02:20.059
 same pp until curve 

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:21.929
 will stick to the bottom face 

00:02:21.929 --> 00:02:23.139
 and the same 

00:02:23.139 --> 00:02:24.069
 channel by 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:26.959
 so in April, the poet and in principle, all here with us 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:27.950
 at that time rub 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.890
 mars we remove transparency 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.669
 percent 1 be as 20 

00:02:32.669 --> 00:02:36.950
 16 I do not know how much 19 before the color evaporated 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.309
 but the house belt color foliage offended green 

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:42.809
 Kokoy and earlier cotton yellow color 

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:44.170
 it's good 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.050
 but we want more we can do 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:47.119
 more 

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:49.089
 Only here to the new club of the girl and her 

00:02:49.089 --> 00:02:51.069
 face do not allow 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:52.769
 because details are lost in the third 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:54.639
 lips is lost sitting ali 

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:57.759
 but the rest of the flowers are cool what to do 

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:59.039
 OK 

00:02:59.039 --> 00:03:01.569
 we choose our values ​​18 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:04.489
 double it but not even twice 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:06.759
 times let him sing at 43 

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:09.289
 45 specifically for the lesson will do more 

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:11.459
 to be more visual now 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:12.709
 merge layers 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:15.489
 6 as a control finger and 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:17.239
 The Sverkunov historian appears 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:19.569
 removing a layer of curves hockey look then 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:22.740
 there is the nasa original and here is our layer 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:25.319
 have this idea that is very saturated 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:27.799
 we go to the channel and them since the pay channel 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:29.830
 responsible for modji antona 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:31.900
 that is, those who are responsible for us face 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.780
 girls from behind green 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.050
 channel biy is responsible for blue and yellow 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.649
 Colour 

00:03:37.649 --> 00:03:39.269
 go and match 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:41.249
 apologists image that is, we now want 

00:03:41.249 --> 00:03:43.939
 replace red channel i.e. channel 

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:45.699
 which shakes for red and green 

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:46.949
 Colour 

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:48.509
 lower that is, we want to change 

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:50.720
 put the rest here 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.860
 and change to take the channel from the bottom layer 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.230
 but it will not be easy that is on the river we 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:57.499
 choose 

00:03:57.499 --> 00:03:58.819
 layer bodrand 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:01.519
 and if we leave the normal mode he we lose 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:04.929
 205 done name lose all red color then 

00:04:04.929 --> 00:04:06.439
 there is light just awful 

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:07.999
 here is a dollar after 

00:04:07.999 --> 00:04:10.550
 so we need an overlay mode 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:12.290
 what do you think he will be 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.659
 that is, we need the mode of the gift of contact 

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:17.410
 we say we need more and green not 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:18.790
 less magenta 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:21.180
 I think you will understand it especially those who 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:22.430
 understands 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.729
 cellular business samara so 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:27.150
 one hundred percent transparency is not ours either 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.880
 need to 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:28.820
 insofar as 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:30.840
 it's too ugly 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.780
 so we have to deliver interest to them 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:33.759
 by fifty 

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:35.940
 when I press I forgot the same reception 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:39.249
 here we get how much 50 percent m 

00:04:39.249 --> 00:04:40.770
 know if it will be on the tables 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.050
 It will be too such that the picture 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.080
 because it will be enough problems 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.289
 if we change transparency leave 

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:48.950
 reception 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:50.910
 and change transparency to fifty 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:53.930
 percent we still miss a little bit 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.070
 red color that is, we need not 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:57.779
 we just want to block it 

00:04:57.779 --> 00:04:59.939
 50 percent I think the normal value 

00:04:59.939 --> 00:05:01.930
 we set 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:04.479
 green light we put a little bit 

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:06.570
 red meaning we left 50 percent 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:07.419
 red 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:09.629
 and left our 

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:11.969
 blue color and we left for that 

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:12.969
 yellow 

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:16.020
 Here again we look at the percentage of dollars after 

00:05:16.019 --> 00:05:18.759
 dollars after the veil cool we could 

00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:21.309
 block those colors that we don’t 

00:05:21.309 --> 00:05:23.079
 need the color that was for us 

00:05:23.079 --> 00:05:25.330
 dangerous bailiffs red light 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:27.830
 squeeze the coca and get that schedule 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:29.270
 we are looking at dollars 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:30.680
 after 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:31.480
 after 

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.870
 tolerance of these details are worldly 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:36.259
 green tortured light appeared 

00:05:36.259 --> 00:05:38.389
 alister more interesting more 

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:40.460
 saturated now can this pictures 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:43.460
 translate and boy mod reverse jim beam 

00:05:43.999 --> 00:05:45.610
 let's take a photo 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:48.379
 and further not only to overclock it 

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:49.919
 give it well we got 

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:52.039
 maximum number of different 

00:05:52.039 --> 00:05:55.150
 flowers and now worse our fantasy can 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:57.740
 moves in different different directions and 

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:59.919
 gets even more 

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:01.889
 and that from the flowers that will 

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:03.259
 nice looking 

00:06:03.259 --> 00:06:05.650
 and I hope you understand the most important thing 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:07.979
 it is decided respect that is again with us then 

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:10.119
 have likes mode 

00:06:10.119 --> 00:06:12.449
 produced picture of them no less and 

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:14.389
 her magenta voip mode is dark 

00:06:14.389 --> 00:06:16.669
 more magenta in the estate of green 

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:18.529
 and the same thing in the channel beat 

00:06:18.529 --> 00:06:20.269
 I hope that you understand if there is 

00:06:20.269 --> 00:06:21.899
 ask questions in the comments and 

00:06:21.899 --> 00:06:23.150
 read margulis 

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:25.090
 Best regards 

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:26.300
 attention goodbye
