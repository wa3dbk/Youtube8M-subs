Welcome to day 3 of RAWVANA Detox!

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:33.140
If you're here it's because you're on your
third day of the juice detox.

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.510
I am already drinking my delicious green juice.

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:36.610
Once again, congratulations!

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:43.540
If you don't know what im talking about please
go back to my previous videos where I explain

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.750
everything you need to know about a 3 day
juice detox.

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:54.269
Today I will show you how to make the 3rd
juice for the 3rd day of the Rawvana DETOX!

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:59.590
This juice is great because it's anti-inflammatory,
full of vitamins, minerals, you'll feel amazing.

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:08.070
This juice will be for your third day of the
juice detox and you will drink 3 of these

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:14.690
during the day, one for breakfast, another
for lunch and a third for dinner.

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:22.760
If you're not doing the detox you can still
make this, this recipe is really good and

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:23.760
easy to make.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:38.369
If you visit my channel you'll see I have
a lot more recipes of juices, smoothies, salads

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.479
and more.,
But ok, enough, lets get to work!

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:47.190
Here's what you're going to need for your
3rd juice on the 3rd day of the rawvana detox.

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:52.810
1 cucumber and it's very anti-inflammatory,
1 stack of celery and it contains the perfect

00:01:52.810 --> 00:02:00.039
balance between sodium and potassium, 1 head
of romaine lettuce which is full of minerals,

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:05.130
5-6 apples, 1 whole pineapple which helps
burn fat.

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.420
LET'S DO THIS!

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:34.650
Try one day a freshly squeezed orange juice
and then try a pasteurized juice that you

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:51.190
buy at a supermarket and you'll see the huge
difference there is, color and taste, its

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.800
impressive!
our juice is ready, going to try it!

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:55.800
mmmm, delicious!

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:56.800
Friends, congratulations!

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:57.800
You've done it!!

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:03.900

last day, I am so proud of all of you but

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:11.820

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:20.340
