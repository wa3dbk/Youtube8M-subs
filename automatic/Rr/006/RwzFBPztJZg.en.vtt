that<00:01:10.290> dry<00:01:10.680> case<00:01:10.979> it's<00:01:11.460> reducing<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.060> amount

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
that dry case it's reducing the amount

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.130

of<00:01:12.330> cheese<00:01:12.510> on<00:01:12.689> my<00:01:12.840> fingers<00:01:14.750> getting<00:01:15.750> all<00:01:15.900> much

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
of cheese on my fingers getting all much

on there I'm just sold up it does taste

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.490 
on there I'm just sold up it does taste
slightly<00:01:18.420> different<00:01:18.750> I<00:01:18.960> think<00:01:19.200> it<00:01:19.259> kind<00:01:19.439> of

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
slightly different I think it kind of

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.710 
slightly different I think it kind of
makes<00:01:19.619> it<00:01:19.740> kind<00:01:20.340> of<00:01:20.400> dull<00:01:20.610> actually<00:01:21.119> it<00:01:21.509> takes

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
makes it kind of dull actually it takes

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.359 
makes it kind of dull actually it takes
away<00:01:21.930> a<00:01:21.960> lot<00:01:22.020> of<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.320> flavor<00:01:22.590> then<00:01:23.189> tastes

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
away a lot of the flavor then tastes

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:24.830 
away a lot of the flavor then tastes
better<00:01:23.549> one<00:01:23.820> at<00:01:23.909> a<00:01:23.970> time<00:01:24.180> instead<00:01:24.780> of

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
better one at a time instead of

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.600 
better one at a time instead of
multiples<00:01:25.350> which<00:01:25.500> is<00:01:25.619> also<00:01:25.770> kind<00:01:25.979> of<00:01:26.100> weird<00:01:26.250> if

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
multiples which is also kind of weird if

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.219 
multiples which is also kind of weird if
you<00:01:26.700> just<00:01:26.850> do<00:01:27.000> one<00:01:27.030> you<00:01:27.720> get<00:01:27.840> a<00:01:27.900> little<00:01:28.080> bit<00:01:28.170> of

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
you just do one you get a little bit of

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.300 
you just do one you get a little bit of
flavor<00:01:28.409> I<00:01:28.500> think<00:01:28.590> I'm<00:01:28.829> glad<00:01:28.950> I<00:01:29.040> just<00:01:29.189> have
