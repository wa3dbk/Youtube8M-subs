00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
through the error freely and get much

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.990 
through the error freely and get much
closer<00:01:18.450> undetected<00:01:19.350> it<00:01:19.860> changes<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.520> tactics

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
closer undetected it changes the tactics

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.370 
closer undetected it changes the tactics
and<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.270> movement<00:01:21.600> speed<00:01:21.780> you<00:01:21.930> have<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.320> you

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
and the movement speed you have and you

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.570 
and the movement speed you have and you
have<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.710> learn<00:01:22.830> how<00:01:23.009> to<00:01:23.070> deal<00:01:23.340> with<00:01:23.369> the

have to learn how to deal with the
environment<00:01:24.530> so<00:01:25.530> of<00:01:25.920> course<00:01:26.100> not<00:01:26.580> much

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
environment so of course not much

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.149 
environment so of course not much
information<00:01:27.090> there<00:01:27.659> but<00:01:27.720> I<00:01:28.200> definitely<00:01:28.770> find

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
information there but I definitely find

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.590 
information there but I definitely find
the<00:01:29.310> information<00:01:29.549> he<00:01:29.939> shared<00:01:30.240> their<00:01:30.420> very

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
the information he shared their very

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.319 
the information he shared their very
interesting<00:01:31.350> as<00:01:31.500> I<00:01:32.280> love<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.820> idea<00:01:33.119> of<00:01:33.180> a

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
interesting as I love the idea of a

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.420 
interesting as I love the idea of a
dynamic<00:01:33.840> play<00:01:34.170> not<00:01:34.470> only<00:01:34.500> with<00:01:34.950> your

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
dynamic play not only with your

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.920 
dynamic play not only with your
different<00:01:35.790> run<00:01:35.939> bruises<00:01:36.360> of<00:01:36.479> course<00:01:36.689> it<00:01:36.840> gives

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
different run bruises of course it gives

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.590 
different run bruises of course it gives
the<00:01:37.170> game<00:01:37.770> so<00:01:38.280> much<00:01:38.400> longevity<00:01:38.850> in<00:01:39.150> terms<00:01:39.420> of

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
the game so much longevity in terms of

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.899 
the game so much longevity in terms of
the<00:01:39.960> replayability<00:01:40.409> and<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.579> different

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
the replayability and the different

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
example you have to take into account

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.930 
example you have to take into account
the<00:02:24.500> reduced<00:02:25.500> vision<00:02:25.799> range<00:02:26.159> when<00:02:26.459> say<00:02:26.730> it's

the reduced vision range when say it's

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.210 
the reduced vision range when say it's
snowing<00:02:27.360> or<00:02:27.540> what<00:02:27.750> have<00:02:27.959> you<00:02:27.989> so<00:02:28.470> definitely

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
snowing or what have you so definitely

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.490 
snowing or what have you so definitely
opens<00:02:29.580> up<00:02:29.730> a<00:02:29.910> new<00:02:29.940> element<00:02:30.690> of<00:02:30.870> strategy<00:02:31.319> that

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
opens up a new element of strategy that

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:32.930 
opens up a new element of strategy that
you'd<00:02:31.590> have<00:02:31.739> to<00:02:31.860> take<00:02:32.040> into<00:02:32.190> your<00:02:32.459> mind<00:02:32.670> when

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
you'd have to take into your mind when

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.490 
you'd have to take into your mind when
play<00:02:33.120> in<00:02:33.180> the<00:02:33.330> game<00:02:33.510> so<00:02:33.840> I'm<00:02:34.349> definitely

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
play in the game so I'm definitely

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.110 
play in the game so I'm definitely
interested<00:02:34.950> to<00:02:35.280> see<00:02:35.430> how<00:02:35.670> this<00:02:35.700> actually
