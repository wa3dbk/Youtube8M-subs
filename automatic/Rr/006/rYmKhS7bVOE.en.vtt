00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:11.350
 and monosodium glutamate is an additive 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:13.719
 food widely used by the 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:16.660
 food industry with the objective of 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:18.460
 enhance the flavor of your products 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.490
 taste tasty and somewhat salty 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.570
 characteristic of monosodium glutamate 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.660
 it is because this chemical compound 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:28.270
 stimulates the tongue in our children and 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:30.860
 in general in the entire population in the 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:33.590
 Taste buds taste one 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:35.510
 up there all right but what happens 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.940
 after our taste buds 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:41.510
 generate a nervous impulse towards the 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:43.010
 brain to recognize this taste is there 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.080
 in our central nervous system 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:48.080
 where the high concentrations of 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:50.660
 monosodium glutamate exert all their 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:53.260
 toxicity through success mechanisms 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:56.989
 toxic is to say in simple words 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:01:00.200
 about stimulating the neuron until 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:03.200
 it degenerates or dies even more according to the 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:06.350
 recognized doctor russell black block in 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:08.479
 his book entitled Toxins Success Points 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.090
 that monosodium glutamate would be a 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:13.310
 trigger obesity as 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:16.160
 damage the hypothalamic neurons of 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:20.030
 appetite regulating center causing 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:22.840
 an increase of approximately 40% 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.840
 the desire to eat 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.170
 unfortunately, monosodium glutamate 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.810
 is in large part of the 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.510
 food that our children consume 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.490
 time to go to school at the moment of 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:37.610
 go to a birthday or just when 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.520
 they are hungry example of them are the 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:43.520
 french fries in all its varieties 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:46.100
 doritos boys maruchan their fried soups 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.860
 dehydrated maggi and a large number of 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.080
 other processed foods this additive 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.180
 food is also used in 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.460
 large food chains that 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:58.160
 they produce fast food like mcdonald 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.740
 telepizza 'burger king' and some 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:03.110
 Chinese restaurants to enhance the 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.790
 taste of your products as if it were 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.070
 little there is also glutamate 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.709
 monosodium in some dressings for 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:12.740
 our meals example of them are the 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:14.840
 ajinomoto and the concentrated broths is 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.400
 that is why we should be alert and read 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.310
 the nutritional labeling of each 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.620
 especially processed food 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.050
 and discard from our diet 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.860
 foods bearing children glutamate 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.860
 monosodic that 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:32.000
 although children are more vulnerable to 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:34.670
 the negative impacts of glutamate 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.740
 monosodium the general population should 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.590
 Avoid products that contain this 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:42.440
 compound since they are equally harmful 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.110
 and nutritionally they do not contribute in 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.880
 nothing to a healthy diet 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:50.030
 our recommendation is clear and precise 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:52.040
 do not let our children maarten 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.440
 your neurons with this kind of additives or 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.660
 food poisons is in us 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.360
 take care of the health of the child population 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:02.590
 and not deteriorate the way the 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.590
 food industry
