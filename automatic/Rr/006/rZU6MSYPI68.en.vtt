00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:08.370
 hello we are farming 

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:11.769
 farm dash chateau 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:15.249
 behind me hereford cow 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:18.850
 about which in connection with the presidential decree 

00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:24.009
 I am more and more often asked to 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:24.910
 the fact that we start beef cattle meat meat 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:29.019
 beef 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:30.160
 which so lacked russia lacked 

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:33.190
 Soviet Union 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.530
 In principle, everything is in our hands and we can 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.719
 grow 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.680
 real marble meat is very expensive 

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:44.469
 very tasty and now you see 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:48.789
 red cows are Hereford and black 

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:49.840
 cows cows are a cross between and we have 

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:52.180
 dairy cow 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.070
 her name is march we keep her in order 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:57.370
 that our farm was milk and 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:01:00.579
 when here is this handsome come here and 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:04.660
 Dad and grandfather's affairs I sewed away from you 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:08.560
 on the shoulder something is not jinxed here when 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:09.970
 so this yashenka is covering milk 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:14.470
 the cow turns out such 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:17.380
 wonderful black and white cows but they 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:20.439
 much bigger than mom 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:24.340
 grow so interesting 

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:29.040
 crossbreed yes you see yasha land earth here 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:34.360
 so here he ruets so I have with us 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:36.460
 almost three years in three years bull 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:39.159
 which is fattening I'm lying 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:42.220
 rolls over a ton and I'm here 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:47.229
 such was the fighting bull in that sense 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:49.149
 the combat that he asks us for the calf then 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:51.540
 there he us be manufacturers and here 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:55.200
 see all the reasons he willingly gave us 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:59.380
 demonstrates you see this one 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:02.890
 little chick she weighs about 100 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:05.170
 kilogram here we have now with my mom 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:08.289
 and maybe not at his mom's trying 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:12.100
 drink milk they are very so arrogant 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:16.370
 cows here and if they see free 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:20.830
 time then milk to eat it 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:26.150
 for them the sacred 100 kilograms usually 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:28.310
 recruit and not when they are about 2 months old and 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.310
 that's just during this period you can 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.010
 wean already from mother and calmly 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:37.879
 transport to another farm 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:41.060
 Hereford cows they are more fearful 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:43.760
 Here are but in my experience dairy they 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:47.019
 more contact neck Orsk and not shy 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:50.209
 and once again I want to remind you that 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:53.329
 Hereford and the cow does not think that 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:56.209
 have it not blowing at all i have my 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:59.840
 Comrade, too, a farmer from the dry log 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:04.970
 who blows that blows these cows 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:08.060
 their milk is so rich and tasty 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:10.120
 to train weights ford given it is necessary 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:13.459
 spend an enormous amount of time and 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:17.470
 let's say so unsafe occupation then 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:20.930
 have we tried to crush five people 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.889
 managed to fix the cow and it means 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.010
 I'll take something off 

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:27.799
 we gave out well on the stream we are not the case 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:32.120
 so put a bull in front of us 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:35.959
 hereford breed he is only one 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:37.819
 month and it weighs 80 kilograms we 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:41.150
 Noticed such a tendency 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:45.760
 the cow brings more stocky more 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:49.099
 powerful gobies, unlike pervach o varnish 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.819
 weaning test 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:54.169
 his weight 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:56.870
 if the bull has passed for 100 kilograms 

00:03:54.169 --> 00:03:59.660
 it means he is quite independent and 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:01.340
 can do without a mother in our 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:04.459
 housekeeping if chicks 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:08.569
 and barrels I mean which are small 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:11.660
 born with this summer that's why i 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:15.199
 I recommend before buying yourself 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:17.630
 farm hereford breed better 

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:20.419
 come and see parents then 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:22.760
 eat on mom and dad then no longer 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:27.120
 there will be no doubt that this 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:30.840
 really purebred 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:32.270
 the fact that this real griffin would be this one 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.830
 goby 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:39.410
 weighs three hundred and sixty five kilograms 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:42.000
 we just chooses him yesterday see 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:45.720
 puberty he wants 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:49.979
 play now his age is only 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:51.330
 one year that is so coincided that in 365 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:53.190
 days he scored three hundred and sixty five 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:56.729
 kilograms is not the biggest 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:59.430
 instance are gaining the Hereford bulls 

00:04:56.729 --> 00:05:02.880
 breeds from a kilogram to a half 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:08.479
 kilograms per day many ask what 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:13.560
 we feed them we feed them with hay bran and 

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:15.630
 We can sometimes treat their oats and on 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:18.840
 idea they are so unpretentious that 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:21.479
 they can eat one straw at all 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:24.600
 also not afraid so the phone is Skye 

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:28.169
 breed all over the world is the most 

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:31.169
 common we say no one of 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:32.450
 farmers have not complained about them now 

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:36.599
 this bull 

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:42.060
 recently turned two well you 

00:05:36.599 --> 00:05:44.539
 see he is much more powerful and more of his 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:50.070
 Comrades who are sitting next to the cell 

00:05:44.539 --> 00:05:55.820
 here we have not mixed it yet but I think 

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:58.530
 that it is three times harder than the previous one 

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:59.099
 I want to remind once again that in three years 

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:02.400
 everything 

00:05:59.099 --> 00:06:07.160
 Hereford bulls weigh more than 1 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:10.130
 but at the same time they are not terrible 

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:12.770
 yes and not scary and loves to play 

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:15.920
 very friendly so advise everyone 

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:17.990
 if you decide to support our 

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:22.370
 domestic animal husbandry 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:25.000
 buy and plant a neck of Russian 

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:25.000
 meat breed
