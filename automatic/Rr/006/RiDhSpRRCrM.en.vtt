00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.640
 music that something will happen for a 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.340
 Weird thing 

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:09.920
 hey what happens if he's having the 

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:11.340
 fame or what is happening the whole festival 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:16.049
 because what's different 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:18.090
 look we have a video where you already want 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.310
 of dancing are not the same 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.860
 here they do not represent anything here they dance 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.750
 less than any of the ballet and in 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.430
 other programs being that this was the 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.240
 who fed you the one who made you 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.240
 meet your fans 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:35.370
 here I met here your face split no and no 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.370
 it's a joke 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:44.390
 and then in other good programs 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.660
 but if he's right because we in 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.460
 other programs dance with more force 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:52.040
 to finish and so because the truth 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.260
 here poor little things or is it broken by 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.600
 be here there are many people who in their 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.900
 house wants to be here shared this 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:02.600
 scenario to make money as you are going to 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:04.190
 You and it's good to dress you well but it's the 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.520
 rest of the manual believe counseling 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:10.550
 alcohol you never have to bite the hand of 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.300
 a man in europe know it or the saying 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.720
 what do I say no 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:16.700
 the phrase do not forget the beginnings and 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.380
 how we started or how did the 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.149
 casting before home 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.770
 I want you to check this to see you 

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:25.360
 same so you can see what you think of this 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.360
 that we have a video with video 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:09.259
 is moving and say like energy 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.259
 force 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:21.140
 and so with that attitude 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.890
 and how good is a choreography here are 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.980
 several and I 'm not the only one who gives loose 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:32.200
 there are also several but in this 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.920
 particular video we are seeing there how 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.920
 is dancing to release 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.980
 because there is the attitude strength of 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.599
 chicken that we do not see here in this 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.060
 scenario and there is no longer the 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:45.129
 chinese who is being here 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.200
 you started arming like this 10 

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:49.360
 I'm still here with the desire 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.459
 but it's not that right now I was a little 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.000
 sick and I have I'm taking some 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:54.000
 pills that 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:08.040
 but I'm telling you that I 'm not the 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:12.069
 only one that speaks when that video when 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:15.120
 yesterday yesterday bayern antilles from the 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:15.120
 Sunday on Sunday 

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:24.819
 certain hours the truth brothers there is no 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:26.590
 excuse or what I do this is a person 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:30.159
 Young has all the vitality strength 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.989
 energy that pill a pill I 

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:34.989
 I think that here you have to give the same and 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:37.480
 in other programs or that he hears Jason and 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:39.250
 also I who lives and I see that he is 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.780
 according to what you are saying 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:44.180
 true or that can scale 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.920
 I 've always asked him to say yes 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.050
 in fact nothing but here is a ballet 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:51.490
 he comes to dance to slacken me 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:51.490
 certainly from heaven 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:58.370
 behind a loose there is always a good 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:01.060
 woman or how is it better bird in hand 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.060
 that there is a woman 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:05.709
 I have one thing 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:08.840
 Jason I have been in this program 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:10.940
 from the beginning and I saw them grow put 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.760
 kellogg's music and grow 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:16.489
 and I say guys, I love it, it's like, 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.950
 my son I would like to send him to take care of him 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:20.060
 cover it but if you do not have to put 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:22.160
 batteries 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:25.640
 I want the two are obviously big 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:28.900
 but if you start here see the example the 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.900
 Mr. Sotelo has already left 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:39.010
 Boys 

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:49.640
 like the box for example that is a guy 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:53.300
 that always dreamed of being theater of 

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:54.800
 ballet although not like the others although 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.880
 he does not want better was the eagerness he has 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.760
 chicken llÃ­ria 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:06.830
 although the emails that no longer 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:09.200
 and dance with all the strength of this dance 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:11.300
 with force the sterile hoop of a thing 

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:14.260
 you break this program is a 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:18.740
 seedling of children talents please

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:24.410
 these games are you laughing 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.730
 you are a dancer you like to have events 

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:28.420

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:32.410
