00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
handed on this the first time I was

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.340 
handed on this the first time I was
doing<00:03:34.500> powders<00:03:35.250> or<00:03:35.640> pigments<00:03:36.420> additives<00:03:37.080> all

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
doing powders or pigments additives all

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.190 
doing powders or pigments additives all
of<00:03:37.470> that<00:03:37.850> I<00:03:38.850> kind<00:03:39.540> of<00:03:39.600> really<00:03:39.810> screwed<00:03:40.080> up

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
of that I kind of really screwed up

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.930 
of that I kind of really screwed up
because<00:03:40.560> in<00:03:40.980> all<00:03:41.160> of<00:03:41.280> the<00:03:41.370> instructional

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
because in all of the instructional

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.640 
because in all of the instructional
videos<00:03:42.300> they<00:03:42.480> don't<00:03:42.690> tell<00:03:42.959> you<00:03:43.110> how<00:03:43.290> light<00:03:43.530> of

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
videos they don't tell you how light of

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.650 
videos they don't tell you how light of
a<00:03:43.739> hand<00:03:43.950> you<00:03:44.130> should<00:03:44.340> have<00:03:44.580> they<00:03:45.180> keep<00:03:45.360> telling

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
a hand you should have they keep telling

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.080 
a hand you should have they keep telling
you<00:03:45.750> to<00:03:45.900> really<00:03:46.260> you<00:03:46.980> know<00:03:47.010> burnish<00:03:47.580> it<00:03:47.610> into

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
you to really you know burnish it into

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.050 
you to really you know burnish it into
the<00:03:48.239> nail<00:03:48.480> but<00:03:49.140> that<00:03:49.380> does<00:03:49.709> tend<00:03:50.160> to<00:03:50.670> make<00:03:50.880> it

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
the nail but that does tend to make it

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.110 
the nail but that does tend to make it
sticky<00:03:51.660> and<00:03:51.739> kind<00:03:52.739> of<00:03:52.860> pulls<00:03:53.220> on<00:03:53.549> some<00:03:53.820> of<00:03:53.940> the

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
sticky and kind of pulls on some of the

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.780 
sticky and kind of pulls on some of the
color<00:03:54.660> coats<00:03:55.110> so<00:03:55.470> you<00:03:56.160> want<00:03:56.340> to<00:03:56.430> be<00:03:56.489> really

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
color coats so you want to be really

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.870 
color coats so you want to be really
light<00:03:57.000> with<00:03:57.239> it<00:03:57.560> because<00:03:58.560> that<00:03:58.950> works<00:03:59.340> even

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
light with it because that works even

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.360 
light with it because that works even
better<00:04:00.030> in<00:04:00.630> my<00:04:00.810> opinion<00:04:01.260> so<00:04:01.890> I'm<00:04:01.950> gonna<00:04:02.130> go

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
better in my opinion so I'm gonna go

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.729 
better in my opinion so I'm gonna go
ahead<00:04:02.400> and<00:04:02.850> just<00:04:03.000> apply<00:04:03.360> that<00:04:03.630> once<00:04:04.350> you<00:04:04.500> have

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
ahead and just apply that once you have

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:06.920 
ahead and just apply that once you have
it<00:04:04.950> on<00:04:05.160> there<00:04:05.489> then<00:04:05.700> it's<00:04:06.330> a<00:04:06.420> good<00:04:06.570> idea<00:04:06.690> to

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
it on there then it's a good idea to

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:09.009 
it on there then it's a good idea to
kind<00:04:07.260> of<00:04:07.350> use<00:04:07.709> a<00:04:07.739> little<00:04:08.100> bit<00:04:08.220> more<00:04:08.280> of<00:04:08.700> a

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:12.930 
edges and the whole nail after you have
applied<00:05:10.780> the<00:05:10.930> additives<00:05:11.650> the<00:05:12.310> additives<00:05:12.760> are

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:12.940 
applied the additives the additives are

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:14.820 
applied the additives the additives are
powdery<00:05:13.630> so<00:05:13.930> when<00:05:14.139> you<00:05:14.350> remove<00:05:14.710> the

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:14.830 
powdery so when you remove the

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:18.600 
powdery so when you remove the
inhibition<00:05:15.370> layer<00:05:15.550> it's<00:05:16.449> going<00:05:16.990> to<00:05:17.370> take<00:05:18.370> off

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:18.610 
inhibition layer it's going to take off

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:21.780 
inhibition layer it's going to take off
any<00:05:18.940> of<00:05:19.419> the<00:05:19.860> pigments<00:05:20.860> that<00:05:20.889> you<00:05:21.070> applied<00:05:21.520> if

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:21.790 
any of the pigments that you applied if

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:24.150 
any of the pigments that you applied if
you<00:05:22.030> did<00:05:22.210> not<00:05:22.440> coat<00:05:23.440> it<00:05:23.590> well<00:05:23.889> with<00:05:24.130> the

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:24.160 
you did not coat it well with the

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:33.659 
you did not coat it well with the
topcoat<00:05:31.350> and<00:05:32.350> then<00:05:32.560> the<00:05:32.740> topcoat<00:05:33.220> goes<00:05:33.400> in<00:05:33.580> the

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:33.669 
topcoat and then the topcoat goes in the

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:35.640 
topcoat and then the topcoat goes in the
machine<00:05:33.790> for<00:05:34.180> two<00:05:34.360> minutes<00:05:34.720> after<00:05:34.960> I<00:05:35.139> did<00:05:35.440> that

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:35.650 
machine for two minutes after I did that

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:38.840 
machine for two minutes after I did that
I'm<00:05:35.830> going<00:05:36.010> to<00:05:36.070> just<00:05:36.250> take<00:05:36.460> a<00:05:36.700> cotton<00:05:36.970> pad<00:05:37.300> and

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:38.850 
I'm going to just take a cotton pad and

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:42.060 
I'm going to just take a cotton pad and
91%<00:05:39.850> isopropyl<00:05:40.300> alcohol<00:05:40.930> rubbing<00:05:41.830> alcohol

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:42.070 
91% isopropyl alcohol rubbing alcohol

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:45.930 
91% isopropyl alcohol rubbing alcohol
they<00:05:42.669> do<00:05:42.729> prefer<00:05:43.479> that<00:05:43.600> you<00:05:43.720> do<00:05:43.870> 99%<00:05:44.410> but<00:05:45.280> those

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:45.940 
they do prefer that you do 99% but those

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:46.950 
they do prefer that you do 99% but those
are<00:05:46.060> kind<00:05:46.240> of<00:05:46.300> hard<00:05:46.479> to<00:05:46.540> come<00:05:46.720> across

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:46.960 
are kind of hard to come across

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.110 
are kind of hard to come across
sometimes<00:05:47.350> so<00:05:47.830> I'm<00:05:47.979> just<00:05:48.190> gonna<00:05:48.340> use<00:05:48.639> ninety

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:49.120 
sometimes so I'm just gonna use ninety

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.210 
sometimes so I'm just gonna use ninety
one<00:05:49.300> and<00:05:49.690> go<00:05:50.500> ahead<00:05:50.650> and<00:05:50.830> remove<00:05:50.950> the

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:51.220 
one and go ahead and remove the

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:53.580 
one and go ahead and remove the
inhibition<00:05:51.760> layer<00:05:51.940> and<00:05:52.270> here<00:05:52.570> is<00:05:52.900> the<00:05:53.169> final

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:53.590 
inhibition layer and here is the final

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:56.190 
inhibition layer and here is the final
look<00:05:54.100> I<00:05:54.520> hope<00:05:55.120> you<00:05:55.360> guys<00:05:55.539> enjoyed<00:05:55.870> this<00:05:55.990> video
