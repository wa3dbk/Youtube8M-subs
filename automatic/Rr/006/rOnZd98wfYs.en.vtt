00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
created a virtual machine to kind of

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.320 
created a virtual machine to kind of
simulate<00:00:11.370> some<00:00:11.610> of<00:00:11.640> these<00:00:11.820> things<00:00:12.090> but<00:00:12.240> when

overwrite<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.660> operating<00:01:22.080> system<00:01:22.380> that's

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
overwrite the operating system that's

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.290 
overwrite the operating system that's
already<00:01:22.800> on<00:01:23.010> my<00:01:23.190> computer<00:01:23.610> with<00:01:23.730> a<00:01:23.760> brand<00:01:24.150> new

CD ROMs and then a network boot option

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.100 
CD ROMs and then a network boot option
and<00:01:35.040> so<00:01:35.640> what<00:01:35.910> happens<00:01:36.330> is<00:01:36.420> your<00:01:36.780> computer

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
and so what happens is your computer

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.810 
and so what happens is your computer
will<00:01:37.410> look<00:01:37.650> at<00:01:37.800> different<00:01:38.160> locations<00:01:38.670> of<00:01:38.760> your

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
will look at different locations of your

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.000 
will look at different locations of your
computer<00:01:39.300> to<00:01:39.900> try<00:01:40.140> to<00:01:40.200> find<00:01:40.440> an<00:01:40.590> operating

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:41.010 
computer to try to find an operating

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:42.950 
computer to try to find an operating
system<00:01:41.220> and<00:01:41.610> once<00:01:41.790> it<00:01:41.940> finds<00:01:42.210> one<00:01:42.510> it<00:01:42.720> will

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
system and once it finds one it will

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.310 
system and once it finds one it will
load<00:01:43.200> it<00:01:43.410> and<00:01:43.590> so<00:01:44.280> if<00:01:44.550> I<00:01:44.970> did<00:01:45.240> put<00:01:45.510> in<00:01:45.630> a<00:01:45.720> cd-rom

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
load it and so if I did put in a cd-rom

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.649 
load it and so if I did put in a cd-rom
drive<00:01:46.620> on<00:01:47.159> my<00:01:47.220> computer<00:01:47.340> let's<00:01:48.330> just<00:01:48.510> say<00:01:48.630> I

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
drive on my computer let's just say I

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.450 
drive on my computer let's just say I
got<00:01:48.690> a<00:01:48.840> cd-rom<00:01:49.200> of<00:01:49.470> an<00:01:49.560> operating<00:01:49.860> system<00:01:50.220> and

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
got a cd-rom of an operating system and

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.300 
got a cd-rom of an operating system and
I<00:01:51.000> and<00:01:51.270> I<00:01:51.750> turned<00:01:52.140> my<00:01:52.230> computer<00:01:52.620> on<00:01:52.710> if<00:01:53.100> it

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
I and I turned my computer on if it

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.250 
I and I turned my computer on if it
found<00:01:53.610> an<00:01:54.060> operating<00:01:54.540> system<00:01:54.690> already

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:55.260 
found an operating system already

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.200 
found an operating system already
installed<00:01:55.470> on<00:01:55.800> my<00:01:55.950> hard<00:01:56.159> drive<00:01:56.250> it<00:01:57.030> would

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
installed on my hard drive it would

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.180 
installed on my hard drive it would
never<00:01:57.450> even<00:01:57.570> look<00:01:57.840> on<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.230> cd-rom<00:01:58.530> because

00:01:59.180 --> 00:01:59.190 
never even look on the cd-rom because

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.190 
never even look on the cd-rom because
you<00:01:59.670> can<00:01:59.790> see<00:01:59.970> that<00:02:00.120> number<00:02:00.420> two<00:02:00.630> option<00:02:01.050> is

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
you can see that number two option is

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.200 
you can see that number two option is
the<00:02:01.350> hard<00:02:01.530> drive<00:02:01.770> if<00:02:02.070> it<00:02:02.520> were<00:02:02.610> to<00:02:02.760> find<00:02:03.000> it

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
the hard drive if it were to find it

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.969 
the hard drive if it were to find it
well<00:02:03.479> then<00:02:03.690> it<00:02:03.840> wouldn't<00:02:04.020> even<00:02:04.140> look<00:02:04.380> or<00:02:04.620> have

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
well then it wouldn't even look or have

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.770 
well then it wouldn't even look or have
a<00:02:05.010> need<00:02:05.250> to<00:02:05.370> look<00:02:05.520> to<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:05.760> cd-rom<00:02:06.060> to<00:02:06.330> drop<00:02:06.540> to

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
a need to look to the cd-rom to drop to

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.109 
a need to look to the cd-rom to drop to
load<00:02:06.960> that<00:02:07.110> operating<00:02:07.800> system<00:02:07.830> and<00:02:08.369> so<00:02:08.940> in

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
load that operating system and so in

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.089 
load that operating system and so in
that<00:02:09.300> case<00:02:09.659> I<00:02:09.959> would<00:02:10.289> want<00:02:10.649> to<00:02:10.709> make<00:02:10.829> sure<00:02:10.859> that

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
that case I would want to make sure that

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.030 
that case I would want to make sure that
I<00:02:11.159> picked<00:02:11.519> right<00:02:12.150> here<00:02:12.359> for<00:02:12.540> my<00:02:12.629> boot<00:02:12.810> menu

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
I picked right here for my boot menu

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.920 
I picked right here for my boot menu
selected<00:02:14.040> the<00:02:14.129> cd-rom<00:02:14.430> drive<00:02:15.090> and<00:02:15.359> hit<00:02:15.480> enter

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
selected the cd-rom drive and hit enter

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.990 
selected the cd-rom drive and hit enter
and<00:02:16.049> that<00:02:16.650> would<00:02:16.799> actually<00:02:16.920> allow<00:02:17.159> me<00:02:17.579> to<00:02:17.700> boot

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
and that would actually allow me to boot

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.209 
and that would actually allow me to boot
up<00:02:18.180> my<00:02:18.480> computer<00:02:18.739> override<00:02:19.739> the<00:02:19.890> settings

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:20.219 
up my computer override the settings

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:21.979 
up my computer override the settings
that<00:02:20.310> are<00:02:20.459> in<00:02:20.579> there<00:02:20.790> and<00:02:20.969> actually<00:02:21.480> looked<00:02:21.870> to

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
that are in there and actually looked to

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:23.899 
that are in there and actually looked to
the<00:02:22.109> cd-rom<00:02:22.409> first<00:02:22.920> to<00:02:23.340> find<00:02:23.549> the<00:02:23.640> operating

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:23.909 
the cd-rom first to find the operating

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:25.819 
the cd-rom first to find the operating
system<00:02:24.390> now<00:02:25.079> that<00:02:25.319> makes<00:02:25.500> it<00:02:25.620> really<00:02:25.739> easy

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:25.829 
system now that makes it really easy

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:27.500 
system now that makes it really easy
with<00:02:26.250> the<00:02:26.310> boot<00:02:26.489> menu<00:02:26.640> what<00:02:27.120> if<00:02:27.239> you<00:02:27.359> don't

find in the first menu but in my case I

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:10.610 
find in the first menu but in my case I
actually<00:03:08.849> have<00:03:09.209> this<00:03:09.359> boot<00:03:09.569> tab<00:03:09.780> here<00:03:10.079> and<00:03:10.349> I

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
actually have this boot tab here and I

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.500 
actually have this boot tab here and I
need<00:03:10.680> to<00:03:10.919> change<00:03:11.129> this<00:03:11.400> boot<00:03:11.700> order<00:03:12.030> so

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
need to change this boot order so

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:13.909 
need to change this boot order so
somewhere<00:03:12.900> you<00:03:13.019> would<00:03:13.139> find<00:03:13.379> the<00:03:13.560> boot<00:03:13.709> order

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:13.919 
somewhere you would find the boot order

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:16.190 
somewhere you would find the boot order
options<00:03:14.400> on<00:03:14.549> your<00:03:14.669> particular<00:03:14.939> computer<00:03:15.299> and

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
options on your particular computer and

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.479 
options on your particular computer and
you<00:03:16.290> can<00:03:16.439> see<00:03:16.560> that<00:03:16.709> I've<00:03:16.799> got<00:03:16.980> removable

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
you can see that I've got removable

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.429 
you can see that I've got removable
devices<00:03:17.819> first<00:03:18.209> then<00:03:18.599> hard<00:03:18.870> drives<00:03:19.139> and<00:03:19.349> then

00:03:19.429 --> 00:03:19.439 
devices first then hard drives and then

00:03:19.439 --> 00:03:21.649 
devices first then hard drives and then
cd-rom<00:03:19.949> drive<00:03:20.220> and<00:03:20.519> I'm<00:03:20.940> actually<00:03:21.209> going<00:03:21.569> to

00:03:21.649 --> 00:03:21.659 
cd-rom drive and I'm actually going to

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:23.629 
cd-rom drive and I'm actually going to
load<00:03:21.900> this<00:03:22.139> new<00:03:22.349> operating<00:03:22.709> system<00:03:23.129> it's

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:23.639 
load this new operating system it's

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:27.349 
load this new operating system it's
gonna<00:03:23.849> be<00:03:24.030> in<00:03:24.209> my<00:03:24.239> cd-rom<00:03:25.019> so<00:03:25.530> and<00:03:26.400> technically

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:27.359 
gonna be in my cd-rom so and technically

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:30.289 
gonna be in my cd-rom so and technically
actually<00:03:27.780> it's<00:03:27.989> a<00:03:28.349> DVD<00:03:28.590> ROM<00:03:29.099> but<00:03:29.669> it<00:03:29.790> will<00:03:29.940> work

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
actually it's a DVD ROM but it will work

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:32.390 
actually it's a DVD ROM but it will work
the<00:03:30.510> same<00:03:30.690> way<00:03:30.750> by<00:03:31.019> picking<00:03:31.439> the<00:03:31.470> cd-rom<00:03:32.040> drive

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
the same way by picking the cd-rom drive

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.869 
the same way by picking the cd-rom drive
so<00:03:33.090> I'm<00:03:33.269> going<00:03:33.569> to<00:03:33.629> go<00:03:34.349> down<00:03:34.560> to<00:03:34.889> the<00:03:35.430> cd-rom

00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:35.879 
so I'm going to go down to the cd-rom

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:37.819 
so I'm going to go down to the cd-rom
drive<00:03:36.389> that<00:03:36.599> I<00:03:36.629> have<00:03:36.900> here<00:03:37.169> and<00:03:37.409> if<00:03:37.560> you<00:03:37.680> look

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:37.829 
drive that I have here and if you look

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:39.319 
drive that I have here and if you look
at<00:03:37.949> my<00:03:38.069> options<00:03:38.489> at<00:03:38.609> the<00:03:38.699> bottom<00:03:38.729> of<00:03:39.209> the

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
at my options at the bottom of the

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:41.479 
at my options at the bottom of the
screen<00:03:39.569> I<00:03:39.870> need<00:03:40.019> to<00:03:40.500> change<00:03:40.859> the<00:03:41.040> value<00:03:41.069> by

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
screen I need to change the value by

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:44.390 
screen I need to change the value by
pressing<00:03:41.819> the<00:03:42.180> minus<00:03:42.689> or<00:03:42.900> the<00:03:43.019> plus<00:03:43.290> keys<00:03:44.010> and

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
pressing the minus or the plus keys and

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.119 
pressing the minus or the plus keys and
so<00:03:44.879> I'll<00:03:45.000> press<00:03:45.479> the<00:03:45.720> plus<00:03:46.019> key<00:03:46.349> and<00:03:46.709> you'll

00:03:47.119 --> 00:03:47.129 
so I'll press the plus key and you'll

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:48.800 
so I'll press the plus key and you'll
notice<00:03:47.489> that<00:03:47.639> it<00:03:47.759> actually<00:03:48.060> moved<00:03:48.359> it<00:03:48.540> up<00:03:48.659> a

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
notice that it actually moved it up a

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.990 
notice that it actually moved it up a
level<00:03:49.019> and<00:03:49.379> so<00:03:49.829> it's<00:03:50.189> actually<00:03:50.400> going<00:03:50.729> to<00:03:50.849> look

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
level and so it's actually going to look

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.199 
level and so it's actually going to look
at<00:03:51.359> my<00:03:51.599> cd-rom<00:03:52.370> before<00:03:53.370> it<00:03:53.489> looks<00:03:53.669> at<00:03:53.819> my<00:03:53.970> hard

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
at my cd-rom before it looks at my hard

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:55.999 
at my cd-rom before it looks at my hard
drives<00:03:54.540> for<00:03:55.019> an<00:03:55.079> operating<00:03:55.409> system<00:03:55.590> and<00:03:55.799> this

00:03:55.999 --> 00:03:56.009 
drives for an operating system and this

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:57.439 
drives for an operating system and this
is<00:03:56.069> what<00:03:56.370> I<00:03:56.400> want<00:03:56.759> because<00:03:57.120> I<00:03:57.239> want<00:03:57.419> to

00:03:57.439 --> 00:03:57.449 
is what I want because I want to

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:59.509 
is what I want because I want to
actually<00:03:57.569> boot<00:03:57.989> from<00:03:58.169> the<00:03:58.259> cd-rom<00:03:58.650> and<00:03:59.069> I

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
actually boot from the cd-rom and I

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:01.369 
actually boot from the cd-rom and I
could<00:03:59.819> move<00:04:00.000> it<00:04:00.150> up<00:04:00.269> to<00:04:00.299> the<00:04:00.540> first<00:04:00.780> place<00:04:01.079> and

00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:01.379 
could move it up to the first place and

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:03.499 
could move it up to the first place and
that<00:04:02.280> would<00:04:02.400> just<00:04:02.430> make<00:04:02.729> it<00:04:02.790> look<00:04:03.030> there<00:04:03.239> first

00:04:03.499 --> 00:04:03.509 
that would just make it look there first

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:05.809 
that would just make it look there first
and<00:04:03.840> that<00:04:04.199> would<00:04:04.349> not<00:04:04.859> hurt<00:04:05.099> at<00:04:05.250> all<00:04:05.370> and<00:04:05.669> it

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:05.819 
and that would not hurt at all and it

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:07.789 
and that would not hurt at all and it
might<00:04:06.000> be<00:04:06.030> helpful<00:04:06.419> for<00:04:06.540> me<00:04:06.780> but<00:04:07.319> I<00:04:07.349> do<00:04:07.470> know
