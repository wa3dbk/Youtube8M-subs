00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
works because then we'll need to be

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.010 
works because then we'll need to be

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:03.010 
and I'm not sure and I don't want
anybody<00:03:02.480> to<00:03:02.540> get<00:03:02.600> hurt

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.020

anybody to get hurt
now<00:03:03.260> I<00:03:03.290> don't<00:03:03.590> I<00:03:03.709> don't<00:03:03.770> know<00:03:03.980> if<00:03:04.040> you<00:03:04.190> know

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
now I don't I don't know if you know

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.820 
now I don't I don't know if you know
this<00:03:04.400> goes<00:03:04.640> up<00:03:05.060> and<00:03:05.209> down<00:03:05.480> now<00:03:06.440> I<00:03:06.470> don't<00:03:06.650> know

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 
this goes up and down now I don't know

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:08.290 
this goes up and down now I don't know
too<00:03:07.010> much<00:03:07.160> I<00:03:07.489> don't<00:03:07.610> know<00:03:07.760> too<00:03:08.000> much<00:03:08.120> about

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:08.300 
too much I don't know too much about

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.180 
too much I don't know too much about
this<00:03:08.540> bike<00:03:08.840> but<00:03:09.140> I'm<00:03:09.530> guessing<00:03:09.769> it<00:03:10.040> would<00:03:10.130> be

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
this bike but I'm guessing it would be

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.550 
this bike but I'm guessing it would be
really<00:03:10.910> hard<00:03:11.090> for<00:03:11.180> this<00:03:11.390> chain<00:03:11.720> to<00:03:11.870> fall<00:03:12.110> off

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
really hard for this chain to fall off

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.699 
really hard for this chain to fall off
oh<00:03:12.590> god<00:03:13.489> I<00:03:13.790> really<00:03:14.120> hard<00:03:14.540> v<00:03:14.870> got<00:03:15.140> a<00:03:15.170> chase<00:03:15.470> right

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
oh god I really hard v got a chase right

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:17.650 
oh god I really hard v got a chase right
here<00:03:16.010> really<00:03:16.670> hard<00:03:16.850> fix<00:03:17.180> which<00:03:17.330> is<00:03:17.480> why<00:03:17.630> I

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
here really hard fix which is why I

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.039 
here really hard fix which is why I
involve<00:03:17.959> it<00:03:18.320> while<00:03:18.530> you're<00:03:18.650> out<00:03:18.830> here<00:03:19.130> and

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:20.049 
involve it while you're out here and

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:22.720 
involve it while you're out here and
that<00:03:21.049> controls<00:03:21.440> the<00:03:21.590> speed<00:03:22.070> and<00:03:22.640> the

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
that controls the speed and the

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.199 
that controls the speed and the
tightness<00:03:23.030> I<00:03:23.540> guess<00:03:24.049> it<00:03:24.200> was<00:03:24.350> water<00:03:24.590> here

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209 
tightness I guess it was water here

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:28.150 
tightness I guess it was water here
that'll<00:03:26.209> be<00:03:26.299> that<00:03:26.510> you<00:03:26.630> slow<00:03:27.170> so<00:03:27.500> fast<00:03:27.830> some

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
that'll be that you slow so fast some

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.360 
that'll be that you slow so fast some
are<00:03:28.280> really<00:03:28.400> show<00:03:28.670> something<00:03:29.000> to<00:03:29.120> you<00:03:29.299> myself
