00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:05.399
 good morning to all the gentlemen and gentlemen 

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:09.390
 this is my new creation 

00:00:05.399 --> 00:00:15.640
 a little special attention then 

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:17.859
 this was one of these lights 

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:21.669
 surely you know they are lights of 

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:24.009
 emergency when their current goes off 

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:28.630
 these hours turn on automatically 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:35.770
 turned it off to what I did today 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:41.260
 he speaks almost the same functions we say 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:44.380
 the design goes well design is perfect is 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:49.680
 small compact does not accumulate dust 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:53.710
 absolutely and is very useful 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:56.230
 above all it is very useful to silent more 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:59.800
 the machine then anvil this 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:02.470
 Here is an emergency light to which I 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:06.490
 made a light and I put it because it was 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:08.950
 lightning put three LEDs and obviously does 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.799
 to light only in a certain direction 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:18.100
 however, one must also be added 

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:21.700
 beautiful radio a Chinese radio with 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:23.890
 the antenna they didn't have is therefore the 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:27.460
 cash the speaker then I put some 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:31.420
 rechargeable batteries below 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:34.840
 the road is all done well and we say 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:40.749
 which works pretty well now 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:44.439
 attack this hoskins sorry 

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:46.869
 in the useless recovery I turn to with it 

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:49.810
 red means it is not falling 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:52.149
 ok to give very bright bacteria 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:55.810
 charging the current attached 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:02:02.429
 now let's say that the current is 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:02.429
 disconnects between 3 2 1 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:12.280
 now you can't hear it with the machine 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.280
 very open 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:24.150
 that the citizen thinner to see 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:27.120
 but they did not see each other in the caste and 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:34.170
 the espresso the senna line I 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:37.050
 now I do antenna that was so 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:40.080
 the whole day that passes is doing so 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:43.250
 yes yes because the other powerful one does 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:46.190
 such a thing all messages 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:52.590
 this which is very useful however to misda 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:56.730
 certainly a lot of parliament are already 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.960
 joke will be trivial psychic gods 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.470
 facts 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:04.290
 see she is much smaller than 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.680
 this should see does not accumulate with 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:12.350
 power that there are no bare wires 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:12.350
 microcracks everything and does its job 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:20.330
 what do you want most out of life 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:25.650
 learn to simplify things for 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:28.160
 small with a modern design like 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:31.680
 I want to see or less 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:36.310
 all things electronic 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:43.150
 garish modern for me this need 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:44.710
 right now if you hang up 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.700
 the flow 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:52.060
 in short, if by itself automatically 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:54.680
 will shut down as soon as they come 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:57.890
 stick to the thing like that 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.750
 one is taking the shower transcribed 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:05.930
 cassandra necks what 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:07.160
 2 all perfectly as if it were not 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:10.010
 nothing happened 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:13.580
 you are in the rock you are doing the 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:17.060
 peace shirin saponaria off the current 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:20.209
 just stay there with a recipe by yourself 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:22.550
 it's annoying, I guarantee it instead with 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:26.390
 a company what was a little more 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:30.880
 quiet I greet you and thank you for 

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:36.700
 inventions and Dumber and more 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:36.700
 most beautiful in the world and see us and thank you
