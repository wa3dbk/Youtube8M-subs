leave it on the counter on its side and
after<00:02:18.390> a<00:02:18.420> few<00:02:18.660> days<00:02:18.840> you'll<00:02:19.050> have<00:02:19.080> something

after a few days you'll have something

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:20.930 
after a few days you'll have something
it<00:02:19.500> looks<00:02:19.530> like<00:02:19.770> this<00:02:19.980> now<00:02:20.220> my<00:02:20.370> son<00:02:20.610> likes<00:02:20.850> to

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
it looks like this now my son likes to

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.760 
it looks like this now my son likes to
fill<00:02:21.630> it<00:02:21.720> up<00:02:21.780> with<00:02:21.930> about<00:02:22.080> this<00:02:22.260> many<00:02:22.440> seeds

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
fill it up with about this many seeds

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.470 
fill it up with about this many seeds
and<00:02:22.980> so<00:02:23.070> this<00:02:23.220> is<00:02:23.370> popped<00:02:23.670> way<00:02:23.940> too<00:02:24.000> tightly

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
and so this is popped way too tightly

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.690 
and so this is popped way too tightly
but<00:02:25.350> you'll<00:02:25.560> recognize<00:02:26.100> these<00:02:26.310> as<00:02:26.550> the

and life occurs inside the seed and then

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.340 
and life occurs inside the seed and then
you<00:03:59.850> eat<00:04:00.030> it<00:04:00.210> and<00:04:00.330> you<00:04:00.420> steal<00:04:00.780> that<00:04:00.990> life<00:04:01.170> from

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
the seed that it was going to put into

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.540 
the seed that it was going to put into

making a tree it also increases your

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:08.030 
making a tree it also increases your
vitamin<00:04:06.300> and<00:04:06.420> mineral<00:04:06.750> content<00:04:06.930> in<00:04:07.800> whatever

food you sprout by two to five hundred
percent<00:04:11.540> depending<00:04:12.540> on<00:04:12.660> the<00:04:12.840> mineral

depending<00:04:13.830> on<00:04:13.920> the<00:04:14.040> vitamin<00:04:14.430> so<00:04:15.420> your

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
depending on the vitamin so your

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.660 
depending on the vitamin so your
micronutrients<00:04:16.590> go<00:04:16.709> through<00:04:16.920> the<00:04:17.010> roof<00:04:17.160> but

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:17.670 
micronutrients go through the roof but

micronutrients go through the roof but
most<00:04:17.910> importantly<00:04:18.420> you<00:04:18.600> have<00:04:18.660> all<00:04:19.049> those<00:04:19.260> live

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
most importantly you have all those live

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.880 
most importantly you have all those live
enzymes<00:04:20.340> to<00:04:20.940> help<00:04:20.970> you<00:04:21.480> digest<00:04:22.230> other<00:04:22.650> foods

enzymes to help you digest other foods

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:24.710 
enzymes to help you digest other foods
and<00:04:23.100> to<00:04:23.160> help<00:04:23.310> keep<00:04:23.520> you<00:04:23.729> young<00:04:24.000> when<00:04:24.630> your

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
and to help keep you young when your

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.659 
and to help keep you young when your
enzymes<00:04:25.110> die<00:04:25.380> that's<00:04:25.680> when<00:04:25.830> you<00:04:26.010> begin<00:04:26.310> to<00:04:26.520> die

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:26.669 
enzymes die that's when you begin to die

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:27.310 
enzymes die that's when you begin to die
all<00:04:26.880> your

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
all your

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.430 
all your
processes<00:04:27.920> die<00:04:28.100> when<00:04:28.340> you<00:04:28.460> lose<00:04:28.670> your<00:04:28.850> enzymes

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 
processes die when you lose your enzymes

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:34.680 
processes die when you lose your enzymes
so<00:04:30.440> the<00:04:30.620> next<00:04:30.890> thing<00:04:31.100> that<00:04:31.130> I<00:04:31.340> use<00:04:31.610> a<00:04:31.640> lot<00:04:32.270> is

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
so the next thing that I use a lot is

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:38.950 
so the next thing that I use a lot is
raw<00:04:35.690> sunflower<00:04:36.290> seeds<00:04:36.950> I<00:04:37.420> like<00:04:38.420> to<00:04:38.570> add<00:04:38.690> these

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
raw sunflower seeds I like to add these

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:43.840 
raw sunflower seeds I like to add these
two<00:04:39.230> granola<00:04:39.650> I<00:04:40.420> like<00:04:41.420> to<00:04:42.580> sprinkle<00:04:43.580> them<00:04:43.790> in

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:43.850 
two granola I like to sprinkle them in

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:46.420 
two granola I like to sprinkle them in
just<00:04:44.240> about<00:04:44.510> anything<00:04:44.930> and<00:04:45.380> again<00:04:46.250> you're

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
just about anything and again you're

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:47.800 
just about anything and again you're
just<00:04:46.460> going<00:04:46.670> to<00:04:46.730> cover<00:04:46.970> it<00:04:47.120> with<00:04:47.150> water<00:04:47.480> and

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:47.810 
just going to cover it with water and

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:50.440 
just going to cover it with water and
then<00:04:48.710> this<00:04:49.520> is<00:04:49.670> what<00:04:49.790> it<00:04:49.880> looks<00:04:50.030> like<00:04:50.150> after

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:50.450 
then this is what it looks like after

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:51.970 
then this is what it looks like after
they're<00:04:50.600> sprouted<00:04:51.080> they<00:04:51.200> just<00:04:51.410> kind<00:04:51.650> of<00:04:51.740> grow

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:51.980 
they're sprouted they just kind of grow

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:54.880 
they're sprouted they just kind of grow
a<00:04:52.010> little<00:04:52.400> bit<00:04:52.520> of<00:04:52.700> a<00:04:52.790> tail<00:04:53.710> there<00:04:54.710> looked<00:04:54.830> a

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:54.890 
a little bit of a tail there looked a

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:56.500 
a little bit of a tail there looked a
little<00:04:55.010> bit<00:04:55.220> longer<00:04:55.520> and<00:04:55.970> a<00:04:56.120> little<00:04:56.360> bit

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:56.510 
little bit longer and a little bit

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:00.190 
little bit longer and a little bit
bigger<00:04:56.720> and<00:04:57.670> I<00:04:58.670> have<00:04:59.150> some<00:04:59.360> recipes<00:04:59.540> in<00:04:59.960> 12

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:00.200 
bigger and I have some recipes in 12

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:01.960 
bigger and I have some recipes in 12
steps<00:05:00.410> the<00:05:00.530> whole<00:05:00.680> foods<00:05:00.890> to<00:05:01.220> use<00:05:01.430> these<00:05:01.670> and

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:01.970 
steps the whole foods to use these and

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.270 
steps the whole foods to use these and
then<00:05:02.690> lots<00:05:03.290> of<00:05:03.380> other<00:05:03.500> things<00:05:03.770> you<00:05:03.890> can<00:05:04.010> sprout

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:04.280 
then lots of other things you can sprout

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:07.540 
then lots of other things you can sprout
but<00:05:04.550> I<00:05:04.580> love<00:05:04.820> to<00:05:05.060> soak<00:05:05.420> almonds<00:05:06.110> they<00:05:07.040> swell<00:05:07.400> up

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:07.550 
but I love to soak almonds they swell up

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:10.480 
but I love to soak almonds they swell up
like<00:05:07.610> this<00:05:08.090> you<00:05:08.930> then<00:05:09.170> strain<00:05:09.890> them<00:05:10.160> in<00:05:10.400> a

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:10.490 
like this you then strain them in a

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:13.030 
like this you then strain them in a
strainer<00:05:10.820> and<00:05:11.590> dehydrate<00:05:12.590> them<00:05:12.710> in<00:05:12.950> your

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:13.040 
strainer and dehydrate them in your

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:16.150 
strainer and dehydrate them in your
dehydrator<00:05:13.250> just<00:05:13.850> make<00:05:14.000> sure<00:05:14.150> it's<00:05:14.330> below<00:05:15.160> 116

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:16.160 
dehydrator just make sure it's below 116

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.980 
dehydrator just make sure it's below 116
degrees<00:05:16.370> because<00:05:17.210> that's<00:05:17.390> where<00:05:17.570> enzymes

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:17.990 
degrees because that's where enzymes

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:20.950 
degrees because that's where enzymes
start<00:05:18.470> to<00:05:18.770> die<00:05:18.920> so<00:05:19.850> I<00:05:19.880> hope<00:05:20.120> you<00:05:20.240> get<00:05:20.390> to<00:05:20.540> start

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:20.960 
start to die so I hope you get to start

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:25.000 
start to die so I hope you get to start
using<00:05:21.610> raw<00:05:22.610> sprouts<00:05:23.140> in<00:05:24.140> your<00:05:24.470> nutrition

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:25.010 
using raw sprouts in your nutrition

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:26.560 
using raw sprouts in your nutrition
regimen<00:05:25.190> and<00:05:25.580> you<00:05:25.670> will<00:05:25.790> see<00:05:25.970> your<00:05:26.150> energy

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:26.570 
regimen and you will see your energy

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:27.630 
regimen and you will see your energy
increase<00:05:26.900> dramatically

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:27.640 
increase dramatically

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:30.640 
increase dramatically
