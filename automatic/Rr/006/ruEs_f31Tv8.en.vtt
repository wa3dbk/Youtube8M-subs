00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:55.579 
game that's kind of fishy

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:58.459 
game that's kind of fishy
so<00:01:56.579> let's<00:01:56.700> look<00:01:56.790> it's<00:01:56.969> gameplay<00:01:57.149> so<00:01:58.140> exactly

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
so let's look it's gameplay so exactly

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.530 
so let's look it's gameplay so exactly
dies<00:01:58.740> within<00:01:59.009> 2<00:01:59.399> seconds<00:01:59.790> or<00:01:59.850> so<00:02:00.000> so<00:02:00.360> let's
