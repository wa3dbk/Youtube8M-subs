 the infrastructural development Aprica Rest is not just a big one 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.409
 technical challenge 

00:00:12.409 --> 00:00:16.500
 it will first show if humanity is really morally capable of surviving 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.920
 Of course, ORF Rica should not take every step of the last 150 years 

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:24.179
 Industrialization once again have to go 

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:27.650
 but immediately get access to the most advanced technologies the 

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:28.819
 human Schimmi 

00:00:28.819 --> 00:00:31.859
 Diligence and engineering art hardly have until today 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.480
 and it starts with a very basic question 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.290
 that means in the Big Band Seeed people in Africa need 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:46.830
 First of all, for someone who has never been in Africa strange water appears 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:50.109
 they need fresh drinking water 

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:55.390
 to be able to wash and cook and end for all the necessities of life 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.110

 working closely with La Roche international the way around Epic Poker 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:09.860
 at the latest since his official presidential candidacy in 1995 he is 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.240
 became known as a political figure in France and many other countries 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:19.050
 at that time he warned on the grounds of why the 1994 forecast forecasts warned 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:24.110
 the upcoming collapse of the derivatives bubble there is China has been settling down 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.590
 many years ago for the abolition of colonialism in Africa 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.780
 the British Embraer in the form of globalization of brutal plunder 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.960
 and so-called nature reserves continued to be areas only 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.420
 Therefore, and to prevent the African countries from owning their own 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.920
 To develop and develop raw materials 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.000
 Vienna 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.280
 Ways Maximin Art also has his candidacy for the French 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.590
 Presidential election 2012 announced heart 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.290
 Gogarten o 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:02.320
 Unaware Aliona Mio on Monkeys Chart is located in the middle of Africa and 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.500
 bordering on Cameroon "Me he's Mary Blair more and of course the chart 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.409
 Ban wants ehec-keim pooh 

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:17.919
 the collection area for the THC extends it resembled to last again and 

00:02:17.919 --> 00:02:21.319
 to Algeria in the north and while he is 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:22.869
 Sodano 

00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:29.719
 Girl's Day After Effects Five Sau In 1964, CERN's area was 25 

00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:32.859
 a thousand square kilometers 

00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:36.529
 today there are only between two and two and a half thousand 

00:02:36.529 --> 00:02:37.929
 Square kilometre 

00:02:37.929 --> 00:02:42.939
 and that's a bad problem because the lake is not very deep at all 

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:46.499
 one to 8 meters waiting penalty 

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:51.110
 so it's tropical and tropical 

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:53.929
 Weather conditions much water evaporates 

00:02:53.929 --> 00:02:59.079
 will see the chart if nothing is done by 2020 or 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:02.079
 2025 completely puzzled numbers 

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:08.950
 Welser camp Rheinberg who needs July for a plan we at the 

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:13.389
 Schiller Institute has developed water from the highway through the 

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:17.900
 Chardonnay and the London India instead of leading them we can 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.230
 the water is supposed to flow directly from outside the subway directly into the Congo 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.139
 Collection area are headed 

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:29.680
 Wipro on my penis they are careful to drive the water level of 1964 

00:03:29.679 --> 00:03:31.609
 is reached again 

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:36.620
 we need an additional amount of water of 35 to 40 trillion 

00:03:36.619 --> 00:03:41.370
 Cubic meters to the current 15 million will be Mor 

00:03:43.029 --> 00:03:45.500
 what man is sitting during this new one 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.470
 the project just mentioned is an emergency plan and must be implemented immediately 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:50.809
 become 

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:55.189
 the training of African youth on the ground should be involved 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:58.739
 the trans currently projects provides 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:04.329
 Capture 100 trillion cubic meters of water per year from the rest of the area 

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:07.329
 double from the previous plan Durban 

00:04:08.279 --> 00:04:13.809
 Me and how Baumann foul this is through a channel from TiVo to the chart 

00:04:13.809 --> 00:04:18.280
 possible that will be about 2400 kilometers in total 

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:25.330
 Wiesberger on Rubin offer the canal to be navigable for freight 

00:04:25.329 --> 00:04:26.220
 be made 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:27.479
 to have 

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:32.379
 a Dan has to plant many trees and a large-leaved schoon 

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:32.970
 become 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.909
 so that the weather system is transformed 

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:37.030
 No 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:41.240
 so man will be the grapevine rapper project in the US 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.229
 to the engineer of the biosphere St 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:49.229
 Visa enjoys the very interesting is that the channel the clear big Mombasa 

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:52.520
 Axis in the African transport network will cross 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.990
 so addressed that there are no eels Zander bodies of Basta 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:00.550
 with the location from Mombasa highway you can thus at this new traffic intersection 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:03.809
 to build new industries 

00:05:03.809 --> 00:05:08.959
 Power generation with nuclear power will be part of it 

00:05:08.959 --> 00:05:14.430
 Agricultural products are processed on-site foods 

00:05:14.429 --> 00:05:19.719
 should be processed in Africa and not exported as a commodity one can 

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:24.729
 Wood and textile industries are building instead of importing textiles as they do today 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:29.729
 and of course you have to build an unacceptable industry around the 

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:33.749
 train young generation of Africans in mechanical engineering 

00:05:34.339 --> 00:05:39.000
 this combination of Opel Act replication industry 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.470
 and the education of a young generation of Africans 

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:45.470
 The tool is the key to success 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:51.699
 Answer Monet because much more than in the US and Canada you need in Africa 

00:05:51.699 --> 00:05:56.240
 a training program for the young people such as the Ecce program 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.139
 "No way" world 

00:05:57.139 --> 00:06:02.500
 to make the local people step by step independent and not 

00:06:02.499 --> 00:06:07.009
 bringing everything from outside means the consortium Aar is the one 

00:06:07.009 --> 00:06:08.479
 Africans 

00:06:08.479 --> 00:06:12.340
 the domination of their country over their production and their guards 

00:06:12.339 --> 00:06:15.699
 recover 

00:06:15.699 --> 00:06:19.029
 even still should necessarily be included in the project 

00:06:19.529 --> 00:06:23.799
 what the young people are the construction of the more or congestion so the pond clear 

00:06:23.799 --> 00:06:28.049
 should have been taught in this project for the damage very much 

00:06:28.049 --> 00:06:32.719
 the customs officer is directly involved in that anyway 

00:06:32.719 --> 00:06:37.189
 prayed that Barça alga hall and through the region along the Congo 

00:06:37.189 --> 00:06:39.680
 Sump Space where Gondorf runs 

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:44.039
 you have to make a connection between the major projects Tschanz and those too complete 

00:06:44.039 --> 00:06:46.580
 create because they are a joke 

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:48.029
 added 

00:06:48.029 --> 00:06:51.409
 and deep and there is a term Islamic belief 

00:06:51.409 --> 00:06:52.789
 is that fair 

00:06:52.789 --> 00:06:58.280
 which means as much as the order of the heavens the authorities better 

00:06:58.279 --> 00:06:59.289
 do 

00:06:59.289 --> 00:07:05.039
 And that is exactly what is needed by the youth with this project 

00:07:05.039 --> 00:07:07.190
 also a future trend 

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:11.400
 2 by colonization and its consequences, Africa has largely the 

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:14.729
 Sense of the future lost 

00:07:14.729 --> 00:07:17.759
 People try to survive the present 

00:07:17.759 --> 00:07:21.139
 even those who studied at the university 

00:07:21.949 --> 00:07:27.080
 a few have a future perspective and that should be considered 

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:29.549
 on the Main to help develop Africa
