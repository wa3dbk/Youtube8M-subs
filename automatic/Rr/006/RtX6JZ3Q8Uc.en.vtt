when you do that a regular cube it turns
into<00:01:48.540> a<00:01:48.689> companion<00:01:49.170> cube<00:01:49.409> and<00:01:49.649> then<00:01:49.799> ft<00:01:50.100> i

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
into a companion cube and then ft i

into a companion cube and then ft i
learned<00:01:50.490> that<00:01:50.520> on<00:01:50.729> youtube<00:01:51.000> let's<00:01:51.479> grab<00:01:51.570> these

learned that on youtube let's grab these
compute<00:01:52.170> and<00:01:52.500> companion<00:01:52.950> cubes<00:01:53.189> put<00:01:53.340> them

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
compute and companion cubes put them

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.700 
compute and companion cubes put them
next<00:01:53.520> to<00:01:53.670> each<00:01:53.759> other<00:01:54.409> bring<00:01:55.409> them<00:01:55.560> out<00:01:55.680> here

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
next to each other bring them out here

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.530 
next to each other bring them out here
into<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.100> light<00:01:56.280> so<00:01:56.880> we<00:01:57.000> can<00:01:57.090> see<00:01:57.270> them<00:01:57.329> nice

and<00:01:57.570> clearly<00:01:57.899> see<00:01:58.710> i<00:01:58.740> can<00:01:58.829> still<00:01:59.040> throw<00:01:59.130> them

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
and clearly see i can still throw them

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:04.010 
and clearly see i can still throw them
but<00:02:01.229> i'll<00:02:01.380> put<00:02:01.590> them<00:02:01.710> next<00:02:01.829> to<00:02:01.979> each<00:02:02.070> other<00:02:03.020> now

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
but i'll put them next to each other now
