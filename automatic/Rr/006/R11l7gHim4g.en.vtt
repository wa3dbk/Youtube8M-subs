I this is like such a unique sniper

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.080 
I this is like such a unique sniper
rifle<00:00:29.189> and<00:00:29.279> it<00:00:29.400> shouldn't<00:00:29.640> be<00:00:29.730> in<00:00:29.760> a<00:00:29.849> sniper

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
rifle and it shouldn't be in a sniper

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.389 
rifle and it shouldn't be in a sniper
rifle<00:00:30.210> category<00:00:30.599> but<00:00:31.199> I<00:00:31.320> guess<00:00:31.500> you<00:00:31.529> have<00:00:32.369> to

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
rifle category but I guess you have to

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.930 
rifle category but I guess you have to
kind<00:00:32.640> of<00:00:32.759> use<00:00:32.910> it<00:00:33.030> like<00:00:33.120> c4s<00:00:33.930> even<00:00:34.890> though<00:00:35.040> c4's

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
kind of use it like c4s even though c4's

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.130 
kind of use it like c4s even though c4's
are<00:00:36.120> like<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.360> worst<00:00:36.510> thing<00:00:36.809> of<00:00:36.930> course

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
are like the worst thing of course

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.869 
are like the worst thing of course
especially<00:00:37.320> in<00:00:37.620> black<00:00:37.770> ops<00:00:37.920> 2<00:00:38.040> but<00:00:38.760> I'm

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
especially in black ops 2 but I'm

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.299 
especially in black ops 2 but I'm
getting<00:00:39.450> off<00:00:39.570> track<00:00:39.780> right<00:00:39.960> now<00:00:40.110> put<00:00:40.290> na<00:00:40.559> 45<00:00:41.040> I

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
getting off track right now put na 45 I

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.940 
getting off track right now put na 45 I
think<00:00:42.000> you<00:00:42.450> know<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.780> best<00:00:42.989> game<00:00:43.649> mode<00:00:43.829> to

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
think you know the best game mode to

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.740 
think you know the best game mode to
play<00:00:44.129> with<00:00:44.280> this<00:00:44.399> is<00:00:44.579> momentum<00:00:45.059> I<00:00:45.180> have<00:00:45.450> seen<00:00:45.719> a

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
play with this is momentum I have seen a

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.660 
play with this is momentum I have seen a
lot<00:00:45.989> of<00:00:46.050> people<00:00:46.379> get<00:00:46.559> a<00:00:46.620> you<00:00:46.980> know<00:00:47.100> quads<00:00:47.430> and

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
lot of people get a you know quads and

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.090 
lot of people get a you know quads and
stuff<00:00:47.850> like<00:00:48.000> that<00:00:48.059> and<00:00:48.680> I<00:00:49.680> think<00:00:49.710> that's

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
stuff like that and I think that's

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.709 
stuff like that and I think that's
definitely<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.579> correct<00:00:50.910> way<00:00:51.059> to<00:00:51.090> use<00:00:51.390> it<00:00:51.600> if

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
definitely the correct way to use it if

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.549 
definitely the correct way to use it if
you<00:00:52.199> want<00:00:52.500> to<00:00:52.620> play<00:00:52.800> more<00:00:52.980> of<00:00:53.219> a<00:00:53.460> traditional

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 
you want to play more of a traditional

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:56.959 
you want to play more of a traditional
sniper<00:00:55.559> roll<00:00:55.890> with<00:00:56.039> this<00:00:56.190> you<00:00:56.820> could

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
sniper roll with this you could

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.670 
sniper roll with this you could
definitely<00:00:57.360> play<00:00:57.629> hardcore<00:00:58.050> but<00:00:58.500> i'm<00:00:58.649> sure

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
definitely play hardcore but i'm sure

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.790 
definitely play hardcore but i'm sure
that<00:00:59.480> ninety-nine<00:01:00.480> point<00:01:00.750> nine<00:01:00.960> percent<00:01:01.710> of

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
that ninety-nine point nine percent of

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.619 
that ninety-nine point nine percent of
you<00:01:01.859> guys<00:01:02.100> do<00:01:02.370> not<00:01:02.550> want<00:01:02.730> to<00:01:02.789> play<00:01:02.910> hardcore<00:01:03.210> so

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
you guys do not want to play hardcore so

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.990 
you guys do not want to play hardcore so
let<00:01:03.780> me<00:01:03.840> show<00:01:04.019> you<00:01:04.110> guys<00:01:04.140> what<00:01:05.040> I<00:01:05.070> would<00:01:05.519> use<00:01:05.760> on

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
let me show you guys what I would use on

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.899 
let me show you guys what I would use on
the<00:01:06.090> NA<00:01:06.270> 45<00:01:06.900> so<00:01:07.290> I<00:01:07.320> think<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.860> best<00:01:07.909> attachment

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
the NA 45 so I think the best attachment

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.850 
the NA 45 so I think the best attachment
just<00:01:09.180> overall<00:01:09.659> in<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.020> game<00:01:10.229> as<00:01:10.500> a<00:01:10.530> variable

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
just overall in the game as a variable

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.679 
just overall in the game as a variable
scope<00:01:11.189> if<00:01:11.430> it's<00:01:11.580> available<00:01:11.880> for<00:01:12.270> that<00:01:12.390> sniper

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
scope if it's available for that sniper

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.980 
scope if it's available for that sniper
rifle<00:01:13.140> just<00:01:14.010> because<00:01:14.310> you<00:01:14.729> get<00:01:14.970> like<00:01:15.180> a<00:01:15.210> big

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
rifle just because you get like a big

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.219 
rifle just because you get like a big
bigger<00:01:16.710> field<00:01:16.979> of<00:01:17.189> view<00:01:17.400> and<00:01:17.580> you<00:01:18.360> could<00:01:18.570> I

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
bigger field of view and you could I

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.840 
bigger field of view and you could I
would<00:01:19.890> definitely<00:01:20.009> recommend<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.640> little

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
would definitely recommend the little

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.300 
would definitely recommend the little
zoom<00:01:21.000> do<00:01:21.210> not<00:01:21.390> switch<00:01:22.049> to<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.380> second<00:01:22.740> second

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
zoom do not switch to the second second

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.160 
zoom do not switch to the second second
zoom<00:01:23.460> because<00:01:23.759> it's<00:01:23.939> pretty<00:01:24.420> much<00:01:24.600> like<00:01:24.659> using

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
zoom because it's pretty much like using

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.160 
zoom because it's pretty much like using
the<00:01:26.009> default<00:01:26.340> sniper<00:01:26.729> scope<00:01:27.210> so<00:01:27.750> definitely

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
the default sniper scope so definitely

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.810 
the default sniper scope so definitely
the<00:01:28.320> little<00:01:28.590> zoom<00:01:28.770> it<00:01:28.979> gives<00:01:29.130> you<00:01:29.220> like<00:01:29.400> a<00:01:29.430> big

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
the little zoom it gives you like a big

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.730 
the little zoom it gives you like a big
field<00:01:30.090> of<00:01:30.270> view<00:01:30.509> you<00:01:31.259> can<00:01:31.380> be<00:01:31.470> a<00:01:31.500> lot<00:01:31.680> more

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
field of view you can be a lot more

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.940 
field of view you can be a lot more
accurate<00:01:32.520> and<00:01:32.729> definitely<00:01:33.659> try<00:01:34.170> to<00:01:34.200> shoot

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
accurate and definitely try to shoot

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.130 
accurate and definitely try to shoot
both<00:01:35.220> of<00:01:35.250> your<00:01:35.460> shots<00:01:35.670> at<00:01:36.020> you<00:01:37.020> know

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
both of your shots at you know

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.200 
both of your shots at you know
consecutively<00:01:37.710> like<00:01:37.979> try<00:01:38.220> to<00:01:38.250> shoot<00:01:38.850> it<00:01:38.880> at

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
consecutively like try to shoot it at

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.569 
consecutively like try to shoot it at
the<00:01:39.479> person's<00:01:39.869> feet<00:01:40.340> especially<00:01:41.340> if<00:01:41.460> they're

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
the person's feet especially if they're

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.130 
the person's feet especially if they're
in<00:01:41.759> a<00:01:41.909> momentum<00:01:42.329> flag<00:01:42.540> you<00:01:42.780> know<00:01:42.869> you<00:01:42.930> could

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
in a momentum flag you know you could

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.010 
in a momentum flag you know you could
like<00:01:43.350> I<00:01:43.470> said<00:01:43.710> get<00:01:43.920> a<00:01:43.950> quad<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.939> triple<00:01:45.420> double

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
like I said get a quad the triple double

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.920 
like I said get a quad the triple double
any<00:01:46.320> of<00:01:46.500> that<00:01:46.649> good<00:01:46.860> stuff<00:01:47.540> with<00:01:48.540> this<00:01:48.720> gun

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
any of that good stuff with this gun

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.810 
any of that good stuff with this gun
like<00:01:49.170> that's<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.649> way<00:01:49.829> to<00:01:49.890> use<00:01:50.189> this<00:01:50.340> gun<00:01:50.579> I

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
like that's the way to use this gun I

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.350 
like that's the way to use this gun I
know<00:01:51.509> I<00:01:51.659> trashed<00:01:52.200> on<00:01:52.439> this<00:01:52.590> gun<00:01:52.740> before<00:01:53.000> but<00:01:54.000> it

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
know I trashed on this gun before but it

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.120 
know I trashed on this gun before but it
is<00:01:54.509> quite<00:01:54.810> a<00:01:54.840> bit<00:01:55.020> of<00:01:55.110> fun<00:01:55.290> to<00:01:55.500> try<00:01:55.710> to<00:01:55.770> get<00:01:55.979> like

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
is quite a bit of fun to try to get like

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.980 
is quite a bit of fun to try to get like
double<00:01:56.460> kills<00:01:56.670> triple<00:01:57.060> kills<00:01:57.270> and<00:01:57.509> quads<00:01:57.750> and

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
double kills triple kills and quads and

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.780 
double kills triple kills and quads and
stuff<00:01:58.140> like<00:01:58.259> that<00:01:58.320> in<00:01:58.710> momentum<00:01:59.070> so<00:01:59.460> if<00:01:59.640> you

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
stuff like that in momentum so if you

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.359 
stuff like that in momentum so if you
guys<00:01:59.969> do<00:02:00.719> really<00:02:01.049> like<00:02:01.200> this<00:02:01.380> gun<00:02:01.619> this<00:02:02.100> is<00:02:02.280> the

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
guys do really like this gun this is the

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:03.950 
guys do really like this gun this is the
class<00:02:02.579> setup<00:02:02.909> that<00:02:03.060> I<00:02:03.090> would<00:02:03.299> recommend<00:02:03.600> for

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
class setup that I would recommend for

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.319 
class setup that I would recommend for
you<00:02:04.110> this<00:02:04.829> is<00:02:04.979> what<00:02:05.219> you<00:02:05.610> know<00:02:05.700> has<00:02:05.909> worked<00:02:06.149> out

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
you this is what you know has worked out

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:07.460 
you this is what you know has worked out
for<00:02:06.479> me<00:02:06.540> whenever

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
for me whenever

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.800 
for me whenever
you<00:02:07.560> know<00:02:07.650> I've<00:02:07.800> uses<00:02:08.220> guns<00:02:08.460> so<00:02:08.810> variable

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
you know I've uses guns so variable

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.380 
you know I've uses guns so variable
scope<00:02:10.160> definitely<00:02:11.160> a<00:02:11.190> must<00:02:11.460> for<00:02:11.760> this<00:02:11.910> gun<00:02:12.120> the

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
scope definitely a must for this gun the

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.660 
scope definitely a must for this gun the
faults<00:02:13.260> Kobe<00:02:13.590> it's<00:02:13.800> a<00:02:13.950> little<00:02:14.040> bit<00:02:14.190> weird<00:02:14.490> it

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
faults Kobe it's a little bit weird it

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.910 
faults Kobe it's a little bit weird it
shoots<00:02:14.880> like<00:02:15.120> a<00:02:15.150> little<00:02:15.480> bit<00:02:15.630> to<00:02:16.020> the<00:02:16.440> bottom

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
shoots like a little bit to the bottom

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.860 
shoots like a little bit to the bottom
left<00:02:17.250> or<00:02:17.580> I<00:02:17.610> think<00:02:18.150> it<00:02:18.210> shoots<00:02:18.390> a<00:02:18.480> little<00:02:18.720> bit

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
left or I think it shoots a little bit

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.290 
left or I think it shoots a little bit
on<00:02:19.110> you<00:02:19.470> know<00:02:19.560> up<00:02:19.800> whenever<00:02:20.220> you<00:02:20.610> shoot<00:02:20.910> it<00:02:21.120> I

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
on you know up whenever you shoot it I

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.120 
on you know up whenever you shoot it I
don't<00:02:21.810> know<00:02:21.900> like<00:02:22.110> the<00:02:22.290> defaults<00:02:22.770> go<00:02:22.890> has<00:02:23.100> a

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
don't know like the defaults go has a

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.370 
don't know like the defaults go has a
little<00:02:23.370> glitch<00:02:23.700> but<00:02:24.300> i<00:02:24.360> think<00:02:24.990> the<00:02:25.050> variable

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
little glitch but i think the variable

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:26.600 
little glitch but i think the variable
scope<00:02:25.530> is<00:02:25.710> definitely<00:02:26.040> the<00:02:26.160> way<00:02:26.250> to<00:02:26.280> go<00:02:26.400> with

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
scope is definitely the way to go with

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.850 
scope is definitely the way to go with
this<00:02:26.670> gun<00:02:27.030> now<00:02:27.930> let's<00:02:28.140> move<00:02:28.260> on<00:02:28.410> to<00:02:28.440> the<00:02:28.620> perks

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
this gun now let's move on to the perks

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.140 
this gun now let's move on to the perks
which<00:02:29.130> is<00:02:29.280> the<00:02:29.370> most<00:02:29.520> important<00:02:29.910> thing

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
which is the most important thing

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.020 
which is the most important thing
normally<00:02:31.110> for<00:02:31.710> any<00:02:31.740> other<00:02:32.130> sniper<00:02:32.430> rifle<00:02:32.880> I

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
normally for any other sniper rifle I

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.910 
normally for any other sniper rifle I
would<00:02:33.270> have<00:02:33.480> low<00:02:33.780> profile<00:02:34.200> because<00:02:34.410> it<00:02:34.680> keeps

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
would have low profile because it keeps

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.550 
would have low profile because it keeps
you<00:02:35.070> off<00:02:35.190> the<00:02:35.220> radar<00:02:35.820> but<00:02:36.780> that's<00:02:36.930> more<00:02:37.200> for

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
you off the radar but that's more for

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.320 
you off the radar but that's more for
like<00:02:37.800> 3-4<00:02:38.250> on<00:02:38.400> stuff<00:02:38.670> like<00:02:38.760> that<00:02:38.880> and<00:02:39.060> I

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
like 3-4 on stuff like that and I

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.420 
like 3-4 on stuff like that and I
definitely<00:02:40.140> would<00:02:40.440> not<00:02:40.590> use<00:02:40.830> it's<00:02:41.040> gonna<00:02:41.190> free

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
definitely would not use it's gonna free

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.970 
definitely would not use it's gonna free
for<00:02:41.610> us<00:02:41.670> so<00:02:41.940> what<00:02:42.570> I<00:02:42.600> have<00:02:42.810> on<00:02:42.840> this<00:02:43.410> class<00:02:43.709> is

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
for us so what I have on this class is

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.660 
for us so what I have on this class is
flak<00:02:44.940> jacket<00:02:45.420> and<00:02:45.600> danger<00:02:46.560> close<00:02:46.860> of<00:02:47.190> course

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
flak jacket and danger close of course

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.030 
flak jacket and danger close of course
you<00:02:47.910> danger<00:02:48.630> close<00:02:48.900> as<00:02:49.080> a<00:02:49.110> must<00:02:49.440> because<00:02:49.650> the

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
you danger close as a must because the

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.240 
you danger close as a must because the
blast<00:02:50.280> radius<00:02:50.400> for<00:02:51.300> the<00:02:52.110> explosive<00:02:52.740> on<00:02:52.860> the<00:02:53.010> na

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
blast radius for the explosive on the na

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.660 
blast radius for the explosive on the na
45<00:02:53.850> is<00:02:54.150> not<00:02:54.690> that<00:02:54.900> big<00:02:55.200> and<00:02:55.440> I<00:02:55.920> think<00:02:55.980> Danger

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
45 is not that big and I think Danger

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.430 
45 is not that big and I think Danger
Close<00:02:56.730> will<00:02:57.420> definitely<00:02:58.170> definitely

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
Close will definitely definitely

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.460 
Close will definitely definitely
definitely<00:02:59.390> improve<00:03:00.390> the<00:03:00.510> blast<00:03:00.750> radius<00:03:00.870> and

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
definitely improve the blast radius and

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.080 
definitely improve the blast radius and
it's<00:03:01.740> going<00:03:01.890> to<00:03:01.950> do<00:03:02.130> more<00:03:02.370> damage<00:03:02.670> when<00:03:03.060> it

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
it's going to do more damage when it

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.810 
it's going to do more damage when it
explodes<00:03:03.690> so<00:03:04.350> definitely<00:03:04.890> Danger<00:03:05.340> Close<00:03:05.370> is<00:03:05.790> a

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
explodes so definitely Danger Close is a

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.870 
explodes so definitely Danger Close is a
must<00:03:06.180> for<00:03:06.420> the<00:03:06.450> NA<00:03:06.690> 45<00:03:07.200> fast<00:03:07.620> hands<00:03:08.100> fast<00:03:08.130> time

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
must for the NA 45 fast hands fast time

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.090 
must for the NA 45 fast hands fast time
is<00:03:08.910> just<00:03:09.209> like<00:03:09.450> my<00:03:09.570> favorite<00:03:09.840> part<00:03:10.800> to<00:03:10.920> use

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
is just like my favorite part to use

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.160 
is just like my favorite part to use
just<00:03:11.400> because<00:03:11.640> you<00:03:11.790> could<00:03:12.030> you<00:03:12.510> know<00:03:12.630> throw

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
just because you could you know throw

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.930 
just because you could you know throw
your<00:03:13.380> equipment<00:03:13.769> faster<00:03:14.220> you<00:03:14.430> can<00:03:14.459> switch<00:03:14.820> to

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
your equipment faster you can switch to

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.420 
your equipment faster you can switch to
your<00:03:15.030> secondary<00:03:15.480> faster<00:03:16.110> and<00:03:16.320> it<00:03:17.100> comes<00:03:17.310> in

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
your secondary faster and it comes in

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.070 
your secondary faster and it comes in
handy<00:03:17.640> a<00:03:17.790> lot<00:03:17.880> when<00:03:18.239> you're<00:03:18.360> using<00:03:18.570> this<00:03:18.870> gun

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
handy a lot when you're using this gun

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.150 
handy a lot when you're using this gun
because<00:03:19.410> I<00:03:19.470> have<00:03:19.890> I<00:03:20.580> have<00:03:21.510> overkill<00:03:22.140> for<00:03:22.380> a

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
because I have I have overkill for a

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.750 
because I have I have overkill for a
secondary<00:03:24.120> primary<00:03:24.739> ASM<00:03:25.739> one<00:03:26.130> is<00:03:26.310> my<00:03:26.430> favorite

every<00:03:56.489> class<00:03:56.700> in<00:03:56.730> my<00:03:57.000> opinion<00:03:57.239> because<00:03:58.200> you're

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
every class in my opinion because you're

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.880 
every class in my opinion because you're
using<00:03:58.799> your<00:03:59.239> exo-suit<00:04:00.239> pretty<00:04:00.959> much<00:04:01.170> once

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
every like three to four seconds because

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.780 
every like three to four seconds because
you're<00:04:03.930> just<00:04:04.200> either<00:04:04.799> going<00:04:05.070> to<00:04:05.160> double<00:04:05.489> jump

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
you're just either going to double jump

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.520 
you're just either going to double jump
going<00:04:06.120> to<00:04:06.209> boost<00:04:06.390> forward<00:04:06.780> booth<00:04:07.019> sideways

and<00:04:07.680> stuff<00:04:07.860> like<00:04:08.010> that<00:04:08.070> so<00:04:08.250> you<00:04:08.489> want<00:04:08.700> to<00:04:08.760> stay

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
and stuff like that so you want to stay

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:10.900 
and stuff like that so you want to stay
off<00:04:09.000> the<00:04:09.150> mini-map<00:04:09.510> whenever<00:04:09.900> that<00:04:10.080> happens

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:10.910 
off the mini-map whenever that happens

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:13.490 
off the mini-map whenever that happens
toughness<00:04:11.910> you<00:04:12.510> flinch<00:04:12.840> less<00:04:13.110> when<00:04:13.380> you're

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
toughness you flinch less when you're

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.170 
toughness you flinch less when you're
getting<00:04:13.620> shot<00:04:13.799> and<00:04:14.280> you're<00:04:14.790> pretty<00:04:15.030> much

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
getting shot and you're pretty much

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.050 
getting shot and you're pretty much
getting<00:04:15.390> shot<00:04:15.660> all<00:04:15.959> the<00:04:16.080> time<00:04:16.289> at<00:04:17.220> least<00:04:17.669> I<00:04:17.880> am

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
getting shot all the time at least I am

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.370 
getting shot all the time at least I am
you<00:04:18.270> know<00:04:18.359> especially<00:04:18.570> from<00:04:18.959> the<00:04:19.049> back<00:04:19.080> and

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
you know especially from the back and

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:19.729 
you know especially from the back and
stuff

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
stuff

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:22.159 
stuff
that<00:04:19.919> so<00:04:20.250> toughness<00:04:21.000> is<00:04:21.150> definitely<00:04:21.660> a<00:04:21.690> good

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
that so toughness is definitely a good

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:24.170 
that so toughness is definitely a good
perk<00:04:22.530> but<00:04:22.949> yeah<00:04:23.280> that's<00:04:23.520> pretty<00:04:23.819> much<00:04:24.000> going

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
perk but yeah that's pretty much going

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.350 
perk but yeah that's pretty much going
to<00:04:24.240> be<00:04:24.360> a<00:04:24.389> guy's<00:04:24.660> than<00:04:25.349> a<00:04:25.500> 45<00:04:25.979> I<00:04:26.370> would

to be a guy's than a 45 I would

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.089 
to be a guy's than a 45 I would
definitely<00:04:27.479> recommend<00:04:27.750> use<00:04:28.500> it<00:04:28.680> more<00:04:28.919> of<00:04:29.009> a

00:04:29.089 --> 00:04:29.099 
definitely recommend use it more of a
