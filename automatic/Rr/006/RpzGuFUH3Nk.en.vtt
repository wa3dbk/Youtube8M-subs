00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 television chain more also the 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.450
 than ever after the alleged lawsuit that 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.950
 starred in mara escala and ariel 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.290
 look for the rights of the 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.759
 albertano character exclusively for 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.650
 do not tell it the actress spoke to 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.289
 Regarding the problem there is no 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.020
 conflict between the two all life 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.840
 ariel and I discussed why we have 20 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:26.160
 years working and we always have then 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:29.820
 agreements and disagreements and this perol but 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.009
 the series continues the agreements continue 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.590
 always with nothing that can not be 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.630
 solve inside house with good 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.930
 will in the best way and always 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.850
 thinking about offering the public a 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.469
 work of excellent quality and is that 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.510
 remember a few days ago ariel 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:50.820
 Miramontes also fixed his position before 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:52.379
 our microphones unlike what 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.530
 that it is not true that there was a plea 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.960
 because he says we have a plea 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.930
 huge that estimated events and hat 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.810
 not simply this one 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.460
 we did not reach an agreement and it was then in 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:07.560
 a very unfortunate moment because 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.060
 we were about to start the 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.450
 season and this 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:15.640
 and that's what happened but no no no 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.820
 we do not reach an agreement then and 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:21.610
 finally good we are already in talks 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:25.020
 with nothing to solve it clearly 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.020
 the rights of the character are hers 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:30.580
 and this has the rights effectively 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.410
 that's how she has recited the character 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.210
 but we are no longer being 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:37.420
 renegotiating we are already reaching a 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:39.100
 agreement is the first time we have 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:45.070
 differences for it because both 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:48.010
 artistic experiments and this but 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.750
 we always always get to some 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.550
 solutions the rights of this 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:51.940
 character will continue to belong to marc 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.590
 to 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.390
 However, extend a license to 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.690
 comedian so you can execute it 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:01.630
 it will always weigh more thanking 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:03.900
 for being my partner for so many years 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.370
 and for the good thing that I could 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:09.190
 share for all the talent that has 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:11.140
 could share and well that's what 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.640
 I can say good relationship and the years 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.850
 that come from work together then 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:18.370
 Well, yes, that's another thing 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:20.340
 Also the fact that they do not see us 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.900
 together does not mean that we are 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.370
 fought 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.560
 ariel has three years that he has his 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.360
 own show I have the child without 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.010
 But ariel will not give up 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.170
 until an agreement is reached that benefits 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:35.560
 both being he who has given fame 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:38.220
 people that are asked for you 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:43.360
 will know the rights that is obviously 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:45.130
 buy it or buy it and that's just 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.349
 is what we are negotiating is what 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:50.020
 we are negotiating and we are seeing the 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:52.660
 way that she is happy and I 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:55.980
 also here but then it's something that 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:03:00.100
 the table is not legal 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:02.019
 personal lawsuits and it's not something that 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.450
 we talked and jon and we have to 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:08.920
 talk to her and I have nothing to 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:11.799
 see with this as a collaborator and with that 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.690
 people are simply in the moment 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:16.420
 if we had an agreement then if we have 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:20.210
 than talking to the right people 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:24.230
 to adjust adjust it 

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:26.300
