00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:14.200
I wonder who’s always
leaving the money in there.

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:16.440
Don’t look at me!

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.440
I don't have any money.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.240
That’s what you all say,
but when I kill you, you drop gold.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.140
What’s all that noise?

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:25.820
Why?!

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.090
Why did I keep playing
when it was clear I was gonna lose?!

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:30.700
‘Cause they hit you
where it hurts the most.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.050
In your gamer’s pride.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.260
There go my life savings...

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.380
...Since the last time I was killed.

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.450
(???) You should
have thought twice....

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:39.800
...before playing.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.000
Hey! Ignore that old guy.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.640
He feeds off
the money of naive mercebinaries.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:08.860
He’s an evil character.

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:10.420
An evil character, he says!

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:11.890
He attacked and robbed me!

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:12.960
But I got a ticket!

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.000
How many ships have you bought
with the money you steal from people?

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.360
Bam!

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.000
You know what, runt?
My business is cleaner...

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.020
...than an elf’s armpit.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.650
If you’re not good enough...

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:26.800
...go whine somewhere else.

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.500
Go kill some bugs to level up.

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.240
Oh, wait…
You don’t level up.

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:37.530
Kofi, calm down and listen to me!

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.370
You have a sword,
he has eyes. Connect the dots…

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.130
Wait, I’ve gathered up
354 coins by cutting bushes.

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.460
I’ll bet all my money.

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.620
Hum… Dude, that’s big money.

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.530
You need it to feed me.

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:55.060
I don’t care!

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:56.500
What this guy
did to me pisses me off...

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.020
...and I won’t let him come
to our town to make fun of us!

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:00.690
Someone has to teach him a lesson!

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.140
Nice speech.

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.380
I’m gonna prepare
a challenging game...

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:05.490
Wait!

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:06.700
I wanna play against you.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.770
(Kofi) A versus,
one against the other.

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.260
You choose the game.

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:12.600
If I lose, you’ll get all my money...

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:13.500
...but if I win...

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.320
...I want you to fill up my wallet.

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:17.820
My, my…

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.080
So the noob’s all fired up today.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.970
 I’ll get a two-player game ready...

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.040
...but I warn you:
if you lose, I don’t want any tears.

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.180
What are you doing?!
The sentinels have a file on me already.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:29.450
It’s for your avatar.

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.680
I’ll load a game
of “rock, paper, scissors”.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.580
Are you ready? Let’s go!

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700
/ You must pick “rock”, “paper” or
“scissors” before the music ends. /

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.200
(Lord of the Games)
Of all your options...
/ You must pick “rock”, “paper” or
“scissors” before the music ends. /

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.650
...the one that counts
is the one that is marked...
/ You must pick “rock”, “paper” or
“scissors” before the music ends. /

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:39.980
...when the music stops.

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.420
As a token of good will...

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.170
...we’ll play a practice round first..

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.130
...then the real one.

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.160
When you win the practice round
but lose the real one...

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.650
...you feel like
you wanna kill someone.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.710
/ This is the practice one /

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:01.960
/ This is the practice one /

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.200
You’re not that smart, boy!

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:05.720
Crap!

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.240
We're all gonna die!

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.080
Well…
It’s time for the real round.

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:21.690
/ This is the real one /

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.810
(Lime's mind) You know
what you have to do.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.300
W-What are you doing?!

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:37.580
Smashing all the buttons!

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:39.020
But that's not how you play!

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:40.140
In my house, it is!

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.000
/ This is the real one /

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:51.740
/ This is the real one /

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.980
Yes!

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.730
It’s impossible… It’s impossible!

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.980
I knew he could!
I knew he’d succeed!

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.530
Now go swindle to some other city.

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.050
We don’t want scammers in Startville!

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:21.940
/ Victory! /

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:38.480
(Rei) So?

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.050
I’ve lost everything!

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:42.360
It’s been just this time, I swear!

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.140
Don’t hurt my family again,
please, I beg you!

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.380
(Rei) Your words say one thing…

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.340
...the money you didn’t
bring says something else.

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.690
And your time is running out...

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:56.610
I’ll bring more money!

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:00.500
Gimme more time, I beg you,
for what you hold dearest, I beg you!

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:03.140
(Rei) I’ll give you another chance.

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:05.420
After all, you're good.

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:08.300
But you know how things work.

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.580
If a mercebinary defeats you...

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:12.770
...you have to destroy them.

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:14.960
I’ll destroy him!

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:16.620
I’ll end him!

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.040
(Rei) I’ll give you a new device.

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.040
A very dangerous one.

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:23.090
A device whose powers...

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:26.060
...could alter the course of fate.
