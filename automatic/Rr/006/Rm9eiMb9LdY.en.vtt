you're putting out of the lines are kind
of<00:04:10.010> small<00:04:10.360> for<00:04:11.360> a<00:04:11.420> lot<00:04:11.599> of<00:04:11.720> time<00:04:11.870> we<00:04:12.019> just<00:04:12.230> used

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
of small for a lot of time we just used

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:15.160 
of small for a lot of time we just used
to<00:04:12.799> just<00:04:13.069> put<00:04:13.280> the<00:04:13.430> eye<00:04:13.670> over<00:04:14.510> the<00:04:14.659> coat<00:04:14.989> the
