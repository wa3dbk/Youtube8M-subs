00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
it and break it i don't think the

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.790 
it and break it i don't think the
batteries<00:02:14.489> came<00:02:14.879> with<00:02:15.150> it<00:02:15.300> would<00:02:15.420> to<00:02:15.900> trip<00:02:16.260> to

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
batteries came with it would to trip to

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.110 
batteries came with it would to trip to
triple<00:02:17.640> A's<00:02:17.810> under<00:02:18.810> there<00:02:19.700> the<00:02:20.700> greater<00:02:20.970> the

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
triple A's under there the greater the

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.059 
triple A's under there the greater the
great<00:02:21.360> they<00:02:21.629> came<00:02:21.930> with<00:02:22.080> it<00:02:22.260> in<00:02:22.440> audience

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
great they came with it in audience

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:25.520 
great they came with it in audience
stools<00:02:23.540> apart<00:02:24.540> from<00:02:24.629> the<00:02:24.780> fact<00:02:24.810> they<00:02:25.140> had<00:02:25.349> to

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
stools apart from the fact they had to

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.780 
stools apart from the fact they had to
turn<00:02:25.890> off<00:02:26.099> the<00:02:26.250> try<00:02:26.550> me<00:02:26.760> mode<00:02:28.640> which<00:02:29.640> was

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
turn off the try me mode which was

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.940 
turn off the try me mode which was
annoying<00:02:30.000> because<00:02:30.300> well<00:02:30.810> the<00:02:31.200> screw<00:02:31.590> on<00:02:31.860> the

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
annoying because well the screw on the

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:37.089 
annoying because well the screw on the
bottom<00:02:32.660> is<00:02:33.660> named<00:02:34.560> Louis<00:02:34.860> Casey<00:02:35.069> shot<00:02:35.780> who

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:37.099 
bottom is named Louis Casey shot who

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:39.530 
bottom is named Louis Casey shot who
there<00:02:38.099> is<00:02:38.340> probably<00:02:39.120> one<00:02:39.239> of<00:02:39.269> the<00:02:39.420> most

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
there is probably one of the most

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.270 
there is probably one of the most
annoying<00:02:39.930> screws<00:02:40.440> I've<00:02:40.680> ever<00:02:40.860> had<00:02:41.010> to<00:02:41.160> unscrew

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
annoying screws I've ever had to unscrew

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.180 
annoying screws I've ever had to unscrew
because<00:02:41.879> it's<00:02:42.150> just<00:02:42.660> awful<00:02:43.050> you<00:02:43.920> have<00:02:44.040> to<00:02:44.099> have

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
because it's just awful you have to have

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.250 
because it's just awful you have to have
the<00:02:44.340> exact<00:02:45.000> right<00:02:45.420> screwed<00:02:45.810> over<00:02:45.959> to<00:02:46.110> better

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
the exact right screwed over to better

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.089 
the exact right screwed over to better
