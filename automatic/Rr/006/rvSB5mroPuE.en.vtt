 founder and president of flash restaurant 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.070
 is here and we will say it very frankly 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.089
 there is no one and I feel like I 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.770
 want to talk about one hour will tamp 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.170
 dematerialization of the restaurant ticket 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.880
 it's a changing world it's a world 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.490
 who changes we are pioneers with a 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.640
 product that is mobile is clearly 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.349
 paper or card are uses 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.179
 of yesterday with the word well that makes you what 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.529
 so-called leap froger in economics 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.420
 you make the frog jump that's 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.160
 have the same map you say but it's 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.780
 a nutty step that wants nothing 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.329
 say today the ticket restaurant 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.300
 in a map it's the 19th century 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.290
 yes of course the mobile is something 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.879
 thing that's in the hand we got it 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.039
 always with you we lose more and is 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.210
 so let's put it back in context 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.829
 title restaurant these three million and 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.180
 half of employees every day and 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.590
 today everyone has a mobile 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.789
 these three and a half million employees 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.649
 what they want is to know where to go 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.300
 lunch with whom to have lunch and 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.859
 save money every day on 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.600
 mobile that's exactly what their 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.309
 lets know where are their friends from 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.780
 invite them to know that such 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.920
 restorers he still has products 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.330
 who did not sell it who want to sell 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.340
 so he's going to have a promo he's going to win 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.600
 money every day so we're 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.340
 really about something that changes 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.990
 we are not on the transaction we are 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.320
 about the relationship on an ecosystem 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.140
 we change the model 5 billion and a half 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.790
 of 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.500
 turnover 1 the ticket 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.750
 restaurant today two values 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.280
 issue of the sum of the securities 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.380
 used you are right of values 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.770
 of invention Jacques French invention 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.479
 borel 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.690
 let's pay him tribute now 50 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:32.140
 years we are the last country 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.520
 industrialized countries spent the 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.320
 dematerialization of restaurant tickets 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.590
 why a vote then 50 years we do not have 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.110
 shake 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.430
 these are first of all it's a magnificent 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.570
 French realization as you have 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.100
 said we went to conquer the world 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.420
 there are 40 countries why are we 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.479
 not move probably because we feel 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.590
 well at home there is a structure that 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:49.990
 did that there was a big guy 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.369
 actors jane cake can be said one 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.990
 barrier to the fantastic entrance the 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:54.940
 paper impossible to make the average cost 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.380
 so low so no one will not go in 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.960
 it takes a break to do it and 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.130
 that's what we provoked good then you 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.570
 you enter everything in the mobile on 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.850
 problem is that you are 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.020
 you still have to load first 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.530
 the app for me that's very very 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.940
 simple yeah 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.890
 on the other hand for the restorer there he 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.509
 must be equipped then must be equipped for 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.180
 to be able to read my mobile 1 it's all 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.080
 bet there flash restaurant that's one of 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.269
 readings but I think it's not the 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.560
 good question how are we doing 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:20.230
 to talk about the move to a dismasting is 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.030
 a card a card it takes tpe 70% 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.320
 restaurateurs have tpe 30% my 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.000
 name painted what tpe is because 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.950
 bank deposits to cash on 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.239
 in today's competition this is the 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.590
 blue card reader but all the 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:31.420
 world has no card reader then 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.739
 that all the restaurants of the kebab 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.269
 corner they have the blue card reader 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:36.190
 while all the restorers have a 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:38.680
 phone and stay at the flash it works 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.299
 on the restorer's phone so the 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.769
 it's like you're telling me twitter 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:43.090
 walk on the phone of the rectorate 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:44.980
 restorer's phone allows him 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.480
 to cash the transaction so we are 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.400
 really about something in which 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.260
 any restaurateur at a terminal remains at 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.110
 flash in your pocket today 20 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.430
 smartphones what but a question of 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.810
 communication let them know 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.220
 because the real question is not the 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.900
 network the real question is the shot 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.920
 today we are made with 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.970
 restorers who are a bit panicked 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.160
 do not know if you saw 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.600
 the umih the snrt it's the star every 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.280
 big unions that are in the process of 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.040
 talk about a 4% card 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.810
 I do 1 75% when that 4% yes 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.400
 today a hundred cases of purebred 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.230
 who knew the right of India heard 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.430
 and that today is the real subject the 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.079
 true subject is that restaurateurs 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.370
 there are real questions about 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:21.720
 card may not be a pretty product 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.720
 ripe after 40 years of existence 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.230
 so already the card had elements 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:27.520
 fascinating because you just have to 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.840
 to say dematerialization is when 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.520
 even today and it's true it's 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.050
 a wound for all those who 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.580
 live with the restaurant tickets it's 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:35.980
 the rendering of money and all that you 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.090
 have 19 euros a day that you spend 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:37.720
 really like you want to come back 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:38.830
 in a bakery 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.450
 you can pay with a ticket 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:43.230
 restaurant you out that all that 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.230
 no but need to say a word 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.640
 sybille is his flexibilise age there 19 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.470
 euros per grid and expenses 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.910
 daily food exactly what 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.220
 which corresponds to the use of the majority 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.440
 people so for us the market already 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.090
 there he is ready to the good behind so 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.560
 all the actors say a map 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.880
 it's going to go and you say you'd give in 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.810
 the card is anything we are going 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.910
 move to mobiles 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.530
 especially as you wait tell me 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:07.090
 with their card it is actually necessary 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.620
 mobile but why it takes a mobile 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.819
 even with the people announced to my great 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.000
 surprise but I will wait a little 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:12.010
 little 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.510
 if you finally look at how you 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.760
 know where you are going to eat the map 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.950
 is not accepted by all so it takes 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:20.139
 an app with a plan that you 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:21.729
 said where to go the law would make it beyond 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:23.410
 number one of the sector he has a 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:25.030
 edenred application mentioned it yesterday 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:26.830
 yes with the restaurants plan where 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.330
 go and with the balance because we have to 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.560
 check your balance at the end of the month 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.360
 how do you know how much you have left 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.620
 well you take a screen you can 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.300
 call of course it's not very practical 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.470
 to call a phone one times 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.169
 always falls back into the same cat of 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:39.820
 schrÃ¶dinger then y'a how are you 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:41.890
 truly change our relationship 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:42.820
 is that with this relationship by mobile 

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:44.860
 the restorer 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:46.210
 because we are around the desk there 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:47.500
 in the big open space is what there is 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:49.300
 five six restaurants we will eat all 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.169
 the days at noon what is global in 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.039
 do we are talking about a 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:51.850
 new ecosystem 

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:53.110
 we are talking about some 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:54.190
 something in which we will bring the 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:55.120
 value to the restorers who are when 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:56.950
 even it's still they who make 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.360
 work so the restorer there 

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:59.979
 now he will know his employees 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.150
 will be able to offer them something he 

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:03.280
 will be able to manage the commercial relationship 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:04.960
 without having a headache I had a 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.220
 restaurateur who told me I can not 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.270
 no longer remember the first name of all 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.979
 my clients basel now has it 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:10.990
 easy he will have it directly 

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:12.490
 he will be able to know and their 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:14.110
 send good plans to manage the 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:15.310
 relationship decided to animate the community 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:17.500
 and reciprocally 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:18.820
 the employee it will send the dish of the day 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:21.130
 for example 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:22.270
 for the afternoon he has a few 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:24.100
 sandwiches who did not sell it 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:26.260
 he puts them at -30% that's good I have not 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:27.550
 ate there I go finally here we are we are 

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.560
 talking about something else in 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:30.580
 he will even manage his bookings on 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.720
 scene is actually because at noon 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:33.430
 it's still the hell he's going to 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:34.420
 maybe say are you coming at 1:30 pm 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:36.430
 or at 13:45 

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:37.960
 I make you 15% less the panoply of 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:39.790
 services and a net but there is a point 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.900
 but another point to add is that it 

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:42.340
 must it go fast for a 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:43.990
 restorer there I continue on my 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:45.340
