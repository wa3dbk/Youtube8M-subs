which is this little hood over here and

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:32.330 
which is this little hood over here and
with<00:02:30.299> this<00:02:30.540> little<00:02:30.930> valve<00:02:31.170> you<00:02:31.440> can<00:02:31.470> adjust

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
with this little valve you can adjust

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:39.229 
with this little valve you can adjust
and<00:02:33.530> move<00:02:34.530> and<00:02:34.970> open<00:02:35.970> and<00:02:36.120> close<00:02:36.209> this<00:02:37.160> hole<00:02:38.239> to

over here did you fill it's a same
amount<00:03:09.269> of<00:03:09.359> resisting

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.809 

Oh
