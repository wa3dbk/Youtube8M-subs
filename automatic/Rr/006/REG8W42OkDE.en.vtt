which uses an alphas howl alphas howl is

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.759 
which uses an alphas howl alphas howl is
the<00:00:11.940> classic<00:00:12.360> example<00:00:12.900> of<00:00:12.960> this<00:00:13.110> of<00:00:13.170> trying<00:00:13.620> to

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
the classic example of this of trying to

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.470 
the classic example of this of trying to
get<00:00:13.950> difficult<00:00:14.190> colors<00:00:14.790> on<00:00:14.910> an<00:00:15.000> item<00:00:15.330> that

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
get difficult colors on an item that

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.180 
get difficult colors on an item that
doesn't<00:00:15.690> support<00:00:15.960> it<00:00:16.289> so<00:00:16.770> let's<00:00:16.920> take<00:00:16.980> this

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
doesn't support it so let's take this

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:18.890 
doesn't support it so let's take this
out<00:00:17.369> that's<00:00:17.520> how<00:00:17.699> just<00:00:17.970> here<00:00:18.210> and<00:00:18.570> I'll<00:00:18.660> remove

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
out that's how just here and I'll remove

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.390 
out that's how just here and I'll remove
the<00:00:19.050> gems<00:00:19.260> from<00:00:19.439> it<00:00:19.619> and<00:00:19.770> we'll<00:00:20.130> talk<00:00:20.279> about

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
the gems from it and we'll talk about

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.480 
the gems from it and we'll talk about
how<00:00:20.970> this<00:00:21.960> this<00:00:22.590> item<00:00:22.920> determines<00:00:23.369> what

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
colors are going to roll now I have made

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.529 
colors are going to roll now I have made
a<00:00:25.380> detailed<00:00:25.830> guide<00:00:26.130> on<00:00:26.490> chroming<00:00:27.029> of<00:00:27.150> items

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
and how these things are determined in

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:29.599 
and how these things are determined in
the<00:00:28.830> past<00:00:29.039> and<00:00:29.189> I'll<00:00:29.250> link<00:00:29.369> that<00:00:29.429> in<00:00:29.519> the

description below for you guys if you're
more<00:00:31.230> interested<00:00:31.710> but<00:00:31.890> in<00:00:32.040> short<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:33.149> colors

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
more interested but in short the colors

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.060 
more interested but in short the colors
that<00:00:33.750> roll<00:00:34.020> in<00:00:34.230> an<00:00:34.320> item<00:00:34.649> when<00:00:34.770> you<00:00:34.800> use<00:00:35.040> a

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
that roll in an item when you use a

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.729 
that roll in an item when you use a
chromatic<00:00:35.399> old<00:00:35.760> are<00:00:36.000> based<00:00:36.510> on<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:37.440> stat

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
chromatic old are based on the stat

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.440 
chromatic old are based on the stat
requirements<00:00:37.950> of<00:00:38.579> it<00:00:38.670> now<00:00:38.790> this<00:00:38.940> has<00:00:39.120> a<00:00:39.149> pretty

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
requirements of it now this has a pretty

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.200 
requirements of it now this has a pretty
high<00:00:39.750> dexterity<00:00:40.469> quite<00:00:40.710> requirements<00:00:41.309> at<00:00:41.399> 138

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
high dexterity quite requirements at 138

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.450 
high dexterity quite requirements at 138
that<00:00:42.870> means<00:00:43.050> it's<00:00:43.260> much<00:00:43.500> much<00:00:43.770> more<00:00:43.829> likely<00:00:44.430> to

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
that means it's much much more likely to

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.160 
that means it's much much more likely to
roll<00:00:44.730> green<00:00:45.059> sockets<00:00:45.480> than<00:00:45.629> it<00:00:45.719> is<00:00:45.840> to<00:00:46.020> roll

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
roll green sockets than it is to roll

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.950 
roll green sockets than it is to roll
red<00:00:46.440> or<00:00:46.559> blue<00:00:46.739> sockets<00:00:47.190> now<00:00:47.610> something<00:00:48.090> like<00:00:48.120> a

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
red or blue sockets now something like a

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.049 
red or blue sockets now something like a
pair<00:00:49.710> a<00:00:49.890> low<00:00:50.100> level<00:00:50.250> pair<00:00:50.550> of<00:00:50.640> gloves<00:00:50.850> that

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
pair a low level pair of gloves that

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.939 
pair a low level pair of gloves that
only<00:00:51.210> has<00:00:51.420> like<00:00:51.539> a<00:00:51.600> 30-something<00:00:52.379> Dex

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
only has like a 30-something Dex

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.670 
only has like a 30-something Dex
requirement<00:00:53.579> is<00:00:53.670> only<00:00:54.270> slightly<00:00:54.690> only<00:00:55.530> has<00:00:55.649> a

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
requirement is only slightly only has a

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.380 
requirement is only slightly only has a
slight<00:00:56.039> bias<00:00:56.250> towards<00:00:56.760> green<00:00:57.000> sockets<00:00:57.300> and

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
slight bias towards green sockets and

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.029 
slight bias towards green sockets and
will<00:00:57.510> have<00:00:57.600> a<00:00:57.629> much<00:00:57.809> easier<00:00:57.840> time<00:00:58.260> of<00:00:58.649> rolling

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
will have a much easier time of rolling

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.950 
will have a much easier time of rolling
reds<00:00:59.520> and<00:00:59.609> blues<00:00:59.850> so<00:01:00.030> you'll<00:01:00.149> get<00:01:00.270> often<00:01:00.719> like

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
reds and blues so you'll get often like

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.590 
reds and blues so you'll get often like
low<00:01:01.199> level<00:01:01.530> magic<00:01:01.859> finding<00:01:02.340> uniques<00:01:02.910> that<00:01:03.420> can

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
low level magic finding uniques that can

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.060 
low level magic finding uniques that can
roll<00:01:03.780> any<00:01:04.019> color<00:01:04.290> sockets<00:01:04.710> that<00:01:04.769> can<00:01:04.949> actually

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
roll any color sockets that can actually

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.380 
roll any color sockets that can actually
be<00:01:05.220> frustrating<00:01:05.850> if<00:01:05.939> you're<00:01:06.030> trying<00:01:06.210> to<00:01:06.240> roll

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
be frustrating if you're trying to roll

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.910 
be frustrating if you're trying to roll
something<00:01:06.570> like<00:01:06.780> four<00:01:07.020> greens<00:01:07.290> even<00:01:07.650> though

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
something like four greens even though

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.100 
something like four greens even though
it<00:01:08.040> has<00:01:08.189> dexterity<00:01:08.850> because<00:01:09.270> you<00:01:09.750> can<00:01:09.930> still

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
it has dexterity because you can still

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.690 
it has dexterity because you can still
have<00:01:10.320> like<00:01:10.530> a<00:01:10.560> strong<00:01:10.890> tendency<00:01:11.130> towards

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
have like a strong tendency towards

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.760 
have like a strong tendency towards
getting<00:01:11.880> any<00:01:12.060> of<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.330> other<00:01:12.479> colors<00:01:12.930> so<00:01:13.560> how

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
getting any of the other colors so how

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.590 
getting any of the other colors so how
do<00:01:13.830> you<00:01:14.010> determine<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.520> most<00:01:14.610> efficient<00:01:15.420> way

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
do you determine the most efficient way

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.149 
do you determine the most efficient way
of<00:01:15.780> going<00:01:15.960> about<00:01:16.170> chromium<00:01:16.740> iron<00:01:16.890> like<00:01:17.130> this

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
of going about chromium iron like this

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.820 
of going about chromium iron like this
like<00:01:17.700> you<00:01:17.790> can<00:01:18.000> just<00:01:18.030> spam<00:01:19.020> chromatics<00:01:19.710> and

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
like you can just spam chromatics and

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.980 
like you can just spam chromatics and
hope<00:01:20.280> to<00:01:20.490> hope<00:01:20.759> for<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.030> best<00:01:21.180> to<00:01:21.479> try<00:01:21.689> and<00:01:21.720> get

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
hope to hope for the best to try and get

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.539 
hope to hope for the best to try and get
it<00:01:22.140> but<00:01:22.710> that<00:01:22.770> might<00:01:23.009> not<00:01:23.189> be<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.400> most

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
it but that might not be the most

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:24.830 
it but that might not be the most
efficient<00:01:23.970> way<00:01:24.060> you<00:01:24.119> might<00:01:24.330> end<00:01:24.570> up<00:01:24.630> spending

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
efficient way you might end up spending

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.270 
efficient way you might end up spending
a<00:01:25.049> whole<00:01:25.200> bunch<00:01:25.409> of<00:01:25.500> extra<00:01:25.619> chromatic<00:01:26.100> so<00:01:26.189> that

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
a whole bunch of extra chromatic so that

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.149 
a whole bunch of extra chromatic so that

brought with it very Chi master crafting

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.060 
brought with it very Chi master crafting
which<00:01:31.770> he<00:01:32.100> allows<00:01:32.340> you<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.729> specify<00:01:33.689> at<00:01:34.320> least

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
which he allows you to specify at least

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.920 
which he allows you to specify at least
some<00:01:35.579> of<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:35.970> sockets<00:01:36.329> and<00:01:36.479> what<00:01:36.630> they<00:01:36.750> will

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
some of the sockets and what they will

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.160 
some of the sockets and what they will
be<00:01:37.140> so<00:01:38.040> for<00:01:38.189> example<00:01:38.520> if<00:01:38.610> we<00:01:38.700> choose<00:01:38.990> if<00:01:39.990> we

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
be so for example if we choose if we

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.410 
be so for example if we choose if we
choose<00:01:40.350> to<00:01:40.680> read<00:01:40.950> sockets<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.909> first<00:01:42.299> two

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
choose to read sockets the first two

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.480 
choose to read sockets the first two
sockets<00:01:42.689> will<00:01:42.990> be<00:01:43.110> tagged<00:01:43.439> as<00:01:43.680> red<00:01:44.040> on<00:01:44.250> the

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
sockets will be tagged as red on the

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.910 
sockets will be tagged as red on the
Alpha<00:01:44.790> sau<00:01:44.970> so<00:01:45.479> this<00:01:46.079> means<00:01:46.290> we<00:01:46.439> kind<00:01:46.649> of<00:01:46.770> get

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
Alpha sau so this means we kind of get

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.090 
Alpha sau so this means we kind of get
to<00:01:47.720> get<00:01:48.720> a<00:01:48.750> bit<00:01:48.960> of<00:01:48.990> a<00:01:49.200> you<00:01:49.680> know<00:01:49.799> we<00:01:49.950> get<00:01:50.040> to

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
to get a bit of a you know we get to

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.980 
to get a bit of a you know we get to
kind<00:01:50.369> of<00:01:50.430> play<00:01:50.729> with<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:51.119> maths<00:01:51.390> a<00:01:51.659> little<00:01:51.689> bit

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
kind of play with the maths a little bit

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.319 
kind of play with the maths a little bit
we<00:01:52.079> get<00:01:52.200> to<00:01:52.320> lean<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.189> maths<00:01:53.430> in<00:01:53.670> our<00:01:53.790> favor<00:01:54.149> a

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
we get to lean the maths in our favor a

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.899 
we get to lean the maths in our favor a
little<00:01:54.509> bit<00:01:54.630> now<00:01:55.110> you<00:01:55.530> can<00:01:55.710> kind<00:01:55.979> of<00:01:56.070> work<00:01:56.640> out

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
little bit now you can kind of work out

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.090 
little bit now you can kind of work out
and<00:01:57.210> make<00:01:57.750> a<00:01:57.780> spreadsheet<00:01:58.140> and<00:01:58.530> make<00:01:58.740> all<00:01:58.920> this

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
and make a spreadsheet and make all this

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.649 
and make a spreadsheet and make all this
complicated<00:01:59.460> math<00:01:59.850> to<00:02:00.090> try<00:02:00.270> and<00:02:00.390> figure<00:02:00.540> out

complicated math to try and figure out
what's<00:02:00.869> going<00:02:00.960> to<00:02:01.110> be<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:01.320> strongest<00:02:01.439> way<00:02:01.710> of

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
what's going to be the strongest way of

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.560 
what's going to be the strongest way of
doing<00:02:02.040> this<00:02:02.159> but<00:02:02.610> there<00:02:02.820> is<00:02:02.939> thankfully<00:02:03.540> a

red to blue is pretty difficult on a
full<00:02:45.150> green<00:02:45.420> item<00:02:45.810> let's<00:02:46.200> see<00:02:46.320> what's<00:02:46.500> the

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
full green item let's see what's the

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:47.930 
full green item let's see what's the
most<00:02:46.740> efficient<00:02:47.190> way<00:02:47.280> of<00:02:47.310> doing<00:02:47.520> that<00:02:47.730> and

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
most efficient way of doing that and

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.250 
most efficient way of doing that and
then<00:02:48.030> we'll<00:02:48.150> also<00:02:48.300> test<00:02:48.630> the<00:02:48.750> most<00:02:48.870> efficient

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
then we'll also test the most efficient

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.199 
then we'll also test the most efficient
way<00:02:49.350> of<00:02:49.380> doing<00:02:49.470> the<00:02:49.740> herald<00:02:50.010> device<00:02:50.220> so<00:02:50.790> to<00:02:50.850> red

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
way of doing the herald device so to red

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.660 
way of doing the herald device so to red
to<00:02:51.240> blue<00:02:51.690> on<00:02:51.930> a<00:02:51.959> dexterity<00:02:52.470> item<00:02:53.010> what's<00:02:53.489> going

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
to blue on a dexterity item what's going

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.100 
to blue on a dexterity item what's going
to<00:02:53.730> be<00:02:53.820> the<00:02:53.910> best<00:02:54.060> way<00:02:54.270> of<00:02:54.300> doing<00:02:54.660> this<00:02:54.840> so<00:02:55.020> we

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
to be the best way of doing this so we

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.780 
to be the best way of doing this so we
have<00:02:55.260> four<00:02:55.620> sockets<00:02:56.040> for<00:02:56.160> the<00:02:56.280> office<00:02:56.610> house

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
have four sockets for the office house

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.390 
have four sockets for the office house
the<00:02:57.209> decks<00:02:57.420> requirement<00:02:58.020> again<00:02:58.290> is<00:02:58.440> 138

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
the decks requirement again is 138

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.570 
the decks requirement again is 138
so<00:03:00.000> 138<00:03:00.900> decks<00:03:01.170> just<00:03:01.410> there<00:03:01.590> and<00:03:01.830> we<00:03:02.100> want<00:03:02.280> to

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
so 138 decks just there and we want to

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.210 
so 138 decks just there and we want to
red<00:03:02.880> to<00:03:03.180> blue<00:03:03.510> pretty<00:03:04.140> brutal<00:03:04.470> the<00:03:05.010> best

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
red to blue pretty brutal the best

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.310 
red to blue pretty brutal the best
option<00:03:05.730> is<00:03:05.910> going<00:03:06.239> to<00:03:06.360> be<00:03:06.480> very<00:03:06.690> chichi<00:03:07.050> one

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
option is going to be very chichi one

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.710 
option is going to be very chichi one
red<00:03:07.560> one<00:03:07.800> blue<00:03:07.860> with<00:03:08.730> Anik<00:03:09.030> gives<00:03:09.300> us<00:03:09.480> an

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
red one blue with Anik gives us an

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.490 
red one blue with Anik gives us an
average<00:03:10.080> cost<00:03:10.350> of<00:03:10.940> 863<00:03:11.940> chromatics<00:03:12.660> so<00:03:13.080> I<00:03:13.110> have

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
average cost of 863 chromatics so I have

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.440 
average cost of 863 chromatics so I have
at<00:03:13.620> least<00:03:13.770> learnt<00:03:14.190> like<00:03:14.550> we<00:03:14.790> can<00:03:14.940> still<00:03:15.120> see

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
at least learnt like we can still see

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:16.640 
at least learnt like we can still see
the<00:03:15.600> difference<00:03:15.930> here<00:03:16.080> if<00:03:16.140> we<00:03:16.230> went<00:03:16.350> for<00:03:16.530> Ichi

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
the difference here if we went for Ichi

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.470 
the difference here if we went for Ichi
to<00:03:16.890> red<00:03:17.100> one<00:03:17.280> blue<00:03:17.550> we'd<00:03:17.940> be<00:03:18.060> looking<00:03:18.180> at<00:03:18.390> a

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
to red one blue we'd be looking at a

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.030 
to red one blue we'd be looking at a
thousand<00:03:18.870> if<00:03:18.959> we<00:03:19.080> just<00:03:19.260> tried<00:03:19.470> the<00:03:19.590> chromatic

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
thousand if we just tried the chromatic

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.020 
thousand if we just tried the chromatic
it<00:03:20.160> we'd<00:03:20.310> be<00:03:20.400> looking<00:03:20.489> at<00:03:20.700> something<00:03:20.880> like

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
it we'd be looking at something like

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.140 
it we'd be looking at something like
1700<00:03:21.660> now<00:03:22.170> I<00:03:22.200> can't<00:03:22.620> really<00:03:22.739> afford<00:03:23.150> 860

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
1700 now I can't really afford 860

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:25.610 
1700 now I can't really afford 860
chromatic<00:03:24.540> so<00:03:24.780> I'm<00:03:24.870> probably<00:03:25.049> gonna<00:03:25.260> stick

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
chromatic so I'm probably gonna stick

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.320 
chromatic so I'm probably gonna stick
with<00:03:25.769> my<00:03:25.920> current<00:03:26.190> alphas<00:03:26.640> how<00:03:26.790> alignment

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
with my current alphas how alignment

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.350 
with my current alphas how alignment
getting<00:03:27.930> one<00:03:28.440> green<00:03:28.860> at<00:03:29.010> least<00:03:29.250> on<00:03:29.489> there<00:03:29.700> is<00:03:29.910> a

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
getting one green at least on there is a

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.630 
getting one green at least on there is a
much<00:03:30.780> more<00:03:31.019> budget-friendly<00:03:31.470> option<00:03:31.830> so

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
much more budget-friendly option so

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:33.770 
much more budget-friendly option so
let's<00:03:32.820> take<00:03:33.000> a<00:03:33.030> look<00:03:33.209> at<00:03:33.420> the<00:03:33.600> more

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
let's take a look at the more

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.900 
let's take a look at the more
budget-friendly<00:03:34.140> option<00:03:34.500> here<00:03:35.040> of<00:03:35.190> two<00:03:35.640> red

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
budget-friendly option here of two red

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.240 
budget-friendly option here of two red
one<00:03:36.150> blue<00:03:36.420> one<00:03:36.450> green<00:03:36.690> and<00:03:37.260> even<00:03:37.980> though

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
one blue one green and even though

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:39.350 
one blue one green and even though
period<00:03:38.580> of<00:03:38.640> lightening<00:03:38.940> would<00:03:39.030> be<00:03:39.120> a<00:03:39.150> little

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
period of lightening would be a little

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.820 
period of lightening would be a little
bit<00:03:39.450> nicer<00:03:39.810> in<00:03:39.900> the<00:03:39.930> office<00:03:40.260> how<00:03:40.410> we'll<00:03:40.620> just

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
bit nicer in the office how we'll just

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:42.620 
bit nicer in the office how we'll just
stick<00:03:40.980> with<00:03:41.100> Harrell<00:03:41.370> device<00:03:41.610> for<00:03:41.850> now<00:03:41.940> so<00:03:42.180> to

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
stick with Harrell device for now so to

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.810 
stick with Harrell device for now so to
red<00:03:42.840> one<00:03:43.200> blue<00:03:43.380> one<00:03:43.410> green<00:03:43.709> same<00:03:44.130> deal<00:03:44.370> here<00:03:44.580> to

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
red one blue one green same deal here to

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.870 
red one blue one green same deal here to
red<00:03:45.120> on<00:03:45.420> blue<00:03:45.959> one<00:03:46.320> green<00:03:46.530> calculate<00:03:47.280> we<00:03:47.850> can

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
red on blue one green calculate we can

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.420 
red on blue one green calculate we can
see<00:03:48.180> that<00:03:48.360> ver<00:03:48.630> Ichi<00:03:48.959> one<00:03:49.260> red<00:03:49.530> is<00:03:49.769> actually

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
see that ver Ichi one red is actually

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.120 
see that ver Ichi one red is actually
the<00:03:51.299> most<00:03:51.480> efficient<00:03:51.959> here<00:03:52.170> just<00:03:52.620> by<00:03:52.739> a<00:03:52.769> small

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
the most efficient here just by a small

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:54.890 
the most efficient here just by a small
margin<00:03:53.280> off<00:03:53.700> of<00:03:53.880> actually<00:03:54.330> chromatic<00:03:54.690> in<00:03:54.780> the

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
margin off of actually chromatic in the

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.539 
margin off of actually chromatic in the
item<00:03:55.140> so<00:03:55.260> we<00:03:55.290> managed<00:03:55.560> to<00:03:55.620> save<00:03:55.860> ourselves<00:03:56.040> 5

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
item so we managed to save ourselves 5

item so we managed to save ourselves 5
Chrome's<00:03:56.970> just<00:03:57.360> here<00:03:57.630> so<00:03:58.170> the<00:03:58.769> this<00:03:59.040> is<00:03:59.100> the

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
Chrome's just here so the this is the

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
adjust remember this is the expected

adjust remember this is the expected
outcome<00:04:01.769> or<00:04:01.920> the<00:04:02.040> average<00:04:02.519> cost<00:04:02.820> it<00:04:03.030> can<00:04:03.150> take

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299 
outcome or the average cost it can take

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:04.820 
outcome or the average cost it can take
you<00:04:03.450> way<00:04:03.630> more<00:04:03.660> than<00:04:04.080> this<00:04:04.200> it<00:04:04.380> could<00:04:04.500> take<00:04:04.709> you

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:04.830 
you way more than this it could take you

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:06.830 
you way more than this it could take you
200<00:04:05.280> it<00:04:05.340> could<00:04:05.489> take<00:04:05.640> you<00:04:05.760> infinity<00:04:06.269> or<00:04:06.570> it

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
200 it could take you infinity or it

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.289 
200 it could take you infinity or it
could<00:04:06.989> take<00:04:07.140> you<00:04:07.320> one<00:04:07.530> try<00:04:07.799> so<00:04:08.160> the<00:04:08.820> idea<00:04:09.150> is

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:09.299 
could take you one try so the idea is

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:11.479 
could take you one try so the idea is
that<00:04:09.360> this<00:04:10.290> is<00:04:10.440> just<00:04:10.620> giving<00:04:10.709> you<00:04:10.980> an<00:04:11.100> idea<00:04:11.430> of

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
that this is just giving you an idea of
