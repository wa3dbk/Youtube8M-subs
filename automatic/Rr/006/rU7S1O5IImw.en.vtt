00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:13.670
 hello to all guys welcome to this one 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:16.309
 brand new minecraft episode 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:17.930
 treadstone then today we are here because 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.300
 I want to show something that I have 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:22.400
 discovered now just opened the 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:26.240
 launcher was a little fooling around in 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:28.970
 world in the world in the director world and ho 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.550
 discovered this then I am neither 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:37.940
 the very last snap shot came out on 14 v 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:41.920
 18 b the 18 both a and b has increased 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:49.969
 an update of the slide blocks or 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:53.500
 if there is a slide block it has a side by side 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:55.670
 block and the bomben piston operated 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:01:02.510
 roseline bloc also carries the 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:06.840
 block and this is really cool 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:09.509
 absurd then I discovered a 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.570
 a glitch I suppose it's a little one 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:15.119
 bug and you mind that when the breaks 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.750
 rexton block makes these particles 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.979
 particles of when it breaks red 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.119
 normal 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:26.459
 here I have besides to have created a 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:30.240
 new clock that I will now show you 

00:01:26.459 --> 00:01:33.270
 as it is that the bug is in that 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.649
 when this block breaks instead 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.289
 make red particles for the 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:40.860
 Lava particles the hour is one thing 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:43.530
 absolutely who knows what though it is 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.079
 definitely pretty cool 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:50.310
 then we just need to put the block here 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:52.739
 of what remains and this is no further plan 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.659
 at the general piston casino and al 

00:01:52.739 --> 00:01:56.789
 fleet that is here behind those I have 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.929
 s started the sad's arm 

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:59.929
 pigeon from behind 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.939
 you can also see that every now and then 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:08.459
 also pays for the selection of 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:10.470
 block you see is displaced with respect to 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.950
 python including this one from the block of 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:16.500
 ray ban and weak for drives beyond 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:20.190
 engage in the select tour when 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:22.950
 I will stop this clock and not though 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:26.959
 this block did not make the particles 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.959
 of the perfect lava 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:34.510
 here yes of course I forgot 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.810
 one thing and you have to do it while valcke 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.510
 ro 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:43.780
 you saw that he had the particles 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:48.400
 perfect lava works a little yes a 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:50.620
 because every now and then you file what it does 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.390
 normal particles that break but the 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:58.750
 blockade continues to exist as we have 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:03:00.340
 just saw perfect no boys 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.990
 this one was only a small one 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.730
 video to update you about this discovery 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:07.890
 that I did now I will have opened the 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:12.640
 ten minute launcher either e 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:17.250
 nothing for this need of everything I will 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.250
 greeting and hello to the next
