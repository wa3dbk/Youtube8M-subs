00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
and then i'm just gonna blend out the

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.780 
and then i'm just gonna blend out the
edge<00:01:46.049> so<00:01:46.470> I<00:01:46.500> don't<00:01:46.829> have<00:01:47.009> that<00:01:47.070> harsh<00:01:47.490> line

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
edge so I don't have that harsh line

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:48.710 
edge so I don't have that harsh line
anymore

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
anymore

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.030 
anymore
and<00:01:49.720> the<00:01:49.840> reason<00:01:50.020> I'm<00:01:50.260> using<00:01:50.320> a<00:01:50.650> different

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.040 
and the reason I'm using a different

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.500 
and the reason I'm using a different
brush<00:01:51.250> for<00:01:51.460> this<00:01:51.520> instead<00:01:51.880> of<00:01:51.940> the<00:01:52.030> same<00:01:52.240> brush

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:52.510 
brush for this instead of the same brush

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.170 
brush for this instead of the same brush
this<00:01:52.960> doesn't<00:01:53.170> have<00:01:53.380> any<00:01:53.530> product<00:01:54.010> on<00:01:54.160> it<00:01:54.370> so

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.180 
this doesn't have any product on it so

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.270 
this doesn't have any product on it so
I'm<00:01:55.420> not<00:01:55.630> going<00:01:55.780> to<00:01:55.870> add<00:01:56.050> any<00:01:56.380> more<00:01:56.500> it's<00:01:57.010> just

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
I'm not going to add any more it's just

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.130 
I'm not going to add any more it's just
going<00:01:57.460> to<00:01:57.490> take<00:01:57.550> what<00:01:57.850> i<00:01:57.880> already<00:01:58.150> have<00:01:58.510> on<00:01:58.690> and

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
going to take what i already have on and

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.380 
going to take what i already have on and
then<00:01:59.290> blend<00:01:59.560> that<00:01:59.860> out<00:02:00.070> so<00:02:00.970> i<00:02:01.000> don't<00:02:01.210> have<00:02:01.270> to

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
then blend that out so i don't have to

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.010 
then blend that out so i don't have to
worry<00:02:01.570> about<00:02:01.660> having<00:02:01.960> too<00:02:02.380> much<00:02:02.620> product<00:02:03.010> on

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
worry about having too much product on

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.640 
worry about having too much product on
the<00:02:05.020> brush<00:02:05.050> when<00:02:05.530> i<00:02:05.560> do<00:02:05.680> this<00:02:07.380> and<00:02:08.380> once<00:02:08.560> you
