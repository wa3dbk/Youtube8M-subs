different<00:02:00.400> things<00:02:00.490> why<00:02:01.030> because<00:02:01.720> you<00:02:01.930> lock

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:02.260 
different things why because you lock

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.070 
different things why because you lock
them<00:02:02.470> up<00:02:02.680> it<00:02:02.920> puts<00:02:03.159> food<00:02:03.280> on

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
and it locks in the flavor stood so he

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.840 
and it locks in the flavor stood so he
cooks<00:02:07.440> fast<00:02:07.770> that<00:02:08.040> loves<00:02:08.280> in<00:02:08.460> the<00:02:08.580> flavor

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220
