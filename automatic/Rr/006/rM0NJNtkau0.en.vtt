00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:22.340
 good afternoon, I'm all Rodriguez 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.340
 we are in sports area 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:27.340
 as I come there I am surrounded by 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.340
 armament 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.190
 several clients have asked me people from 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.800
 here from the islands and people from outside me 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.540
 have asked that please explain the 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.340
 best system to mount a sim rifle 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.930
 with heads open to almost all 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.640
 we know how to ride but a lot of people 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.290
 who does not know then we're going to make a 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.300
 video for these people that still 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.309
 does not know exactly how is the 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.650
 assembly of the head rifles the 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.420
 how to circulate 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.070
 let's explain from the beginning we're going to 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.920
 start with the classic head of all 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.840
 life the head of parallel gums 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.570
 completely closed all the life that 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.890
 we all know how it works not what 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.410
 we make the idea that we have the 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.050
 nylon hooked back and to the head 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:12.500
 it would simply come out and that you remember 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:16.460
 always one thing 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:18.940
 if we give him the exit and if we give him the 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.940
 exit 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:27.830
 if you are going to give out in 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:31.070
 example on the left side we go all 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:34.020
 remember that the thread is open head 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:38.929
 that is, head closed 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.929
 the day that always 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.960
 this happens to me for wanting to save the next 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:54.640
 always be parallel on the side that 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:56.710
 do not roll up in the Lord when you leave that 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.840
 have to be mounted the black has 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.680
 to go link if they ride on the side 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.030
 left 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.030
 the nylon outlet from down here 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:10.000
 would remove the cap here would be the 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.560
 castle and the nylon would come out here if 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.010
 on the other hand on the other hand but that 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.720
 always wants to be stuck to the harpoon that 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.390
 go always stuck to the arch 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.790
 remember that to prevent the menu from 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.739
 roll in the gums that sometimes happens 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.450
 or can cut the action and then already 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:27.190
 would be cooking back towards the nail and 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.940
 turn forward the turns that 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.940
 want 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.890
 this would be in the case of a head of 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.920
 one head closed the head of all the 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:40.950
 life of what kind is he wants to get married 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.950
 radio planet this would be one 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:47.490
 after a new type of head that 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:49.650
 It is a head that you wear bibs that use that 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:51.069
 logic are the elites who use the 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.620
 jerónimos 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:55.209
 in a head that the times is a 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.819
 head can be opened but they do 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:00.609
 the times of closed head because a 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:03.489
 Once we assemble the rubber bands 

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:05.469
 this piece this piece when stretching the 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:07.750
 gums back this piece locks 

00:03:05.469 --> 00:03:09.700
 alarcón and leaves it totally blocked 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.620
 robben us the most backward 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.260
 the more they have, the more the 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.389
 answer is a head that makes the 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.400
 Sometimes closed head but also 

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:21.519
 it acts as an open cause that 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.439
 we want here the logical thing would be to pass the 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:25.389
 nylon as we said before 

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:27.340
 raisins normal and ready I would not have higher 

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:30.599
 problem and now we're going to the 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.599
 open heads 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:36.760
 open salts we would have 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:39.410
 the salve model 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:42.080
 are the most normal we see that the 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:44.420
 model of save that in a model for 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:47.040
 always fish with double nylon such and 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.870
 how the head is assembled 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.680
 for the simple reason that if we 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:55.420
 we mount the nylon 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.420
 the tree in its place 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:04.989
 we give nylon outlet on the side that 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.989
 corresponds with nylon arrives here 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:10.250
 will not find support like it can be 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:13.489
 he is then we would have to go back 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:17.690
 backwards and once we come back towards 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:20.870
 back and let's go back then yes we can 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:23.700
 making was done and already stuck the 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:25.740
 arch we already have the joint 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:28.950
 it's a bit more complicated than 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:30.480
 conventional open heads but 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:35.660
 if you want to fish with a double nylon it's 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:38.800
 quite as it is very comfortable to ride ok 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:38.800
 and then we would see each other 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:48.800
 alsea that will head seeing that to me 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:52.150
 I like it a lot because it probably is 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:54.550
 something simpler training 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:57.550
 suppose the nylon we follow 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:59.920
 assuming the nylon comes from there by the 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:03.910
 side in this case could come better by 

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:07.300
 the side on the right side of the harpoon 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:09.090
 nylon out here would come here and 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:11.340
 we would do this 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:12.600
 and let's say back towards the nail and 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:15.180
 we would go back to the head to 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:18.000
 put them the three rolls of nylon that 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:20.010
 takes each rifle one out one 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.250
 inwards and another if he wants 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:25.110
 is that we want to mount double double double 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:27.240
 and the nylon when the nylon comes for 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:28.979
 here 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.790
 but in passing here a small trap door 

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:32.800
 fast 

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:35.830
 when the nylon comes here 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:39.370
 we would go through here below and we would return 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:41.890
 back to back in the case the kind of 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:45.080
 double in it the head of the salvamar goes 

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:47.270
 rather better than this head 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:49.610
 and that's it, and I think it was useful 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:52.870
 to clarify certain points of agreement 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:52.870
 thank you very much and see you next time
