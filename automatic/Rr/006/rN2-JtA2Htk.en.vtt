that I'm just giving some examples like

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.260 
that I'm just giving some examples like
just<00:02:18.770> because<00:02:19.160> it<00:02:19.310> might<00:02:19.400> be<00:02:19.550> a<00:02:19.580> black<00:02:19.849> ops<00:02:20.120> it

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
just because it might be a black ops it

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.000 
just because it might be a black ops it
doesn't<00:02:20.510> have<00:02:20.630> to<00:02:20.840> be<00:02:20.870> a<00:02:21.020> black<00:02:21.349> ops<00:02:21.620> 3<00:02:21.860> could

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
doesn't have to be a black ops 3 could

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.430 
doesn't have to be a black ops 3 could
be<00:02:22.099> black<00:02:22.310> ops<00:02:22.550> this<00:02:22.730> black<00:02:23.150> ops<00:02:23.360> that<00:02:23.660> or<00:02:24.140> it

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
be black ops this black ops that or it

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.050 
be black ops this black ops that or it
could<00:02:24.560> be<00:02:24.590> something<00:02:24.790> completely<00:02:25.790> different

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
could be something completely different

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.370 
could be something completely different

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
think down below in the comments section

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.130 
think down below in the comments section
because<00:02:49.040> like<00:02:49.940> I<00:02:50.060> said<00:02:50.150> in<00:02:50.360> previous<00:02:50.510> videos<00:02:50.840> I

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
because like I said in previous videos I

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:52.720 
because like I said in previous videos I
mean<00:02:51.290> it<00:02:51.380> would<00:02:51.470> be<00:02:51.560> really<00:02:51.799> really<00:02:51.920> cool<00:02:52.580> to

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
mean it would be really really cool to

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.690 
mean it would be really really cool to
be<00:02:52.819> black<00:02:53.060> ops<00:02:53.299> 3<00:02:53.540> because<00:02:53.870> sales<00:02:54.290> wise<00:02:54.739> black

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
be black ops 3 because sales wise black

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.670 
be black ops 3 because sales wise black
ops<00:02:55.970> and<00:02:56.269> black<00:02:56.480> ops<00:02:56.750> 2<00:02:56.930> are<00:02:57.170> one<00:02:57.350> of<00:02:57.410> the<00:02:57.500> most

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
ops and black ops 2 are one of the most

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.610 
ops and black ops 2 are one of the most
sold<00:02:58.100> call<00:02:58.430> of<00:02:58.580> duties<00:02:58.850> of<00:02:59.030> all<00:02:59.209> time<00:02:59.810> so<00:03:00.560> I've

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
sold call of duties of all time so I've

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:01.960 
sold call of duties of all time so I've
said<00:03:00.830> this<00:03:00.920> in<00:03:01.069> previous<00:03:01.250> videos<00:03:01.549> we<00:03:01.760> could

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
said this in previous videos we could

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.330 
said this in previous videos we could
see<00:03:02.180> why<00:03:02.510> they<00:03:02.900> would<00:03:03.080> do<00:03:03.230> black<00:03:03.440> ops<00:03:03.680> 3<00:03:03.920> from<00:03:04.130> a

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
see why they would do black ops 3 from a

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.610 
see why they would do black ops 3 from a
sales<00:03:04.700> point<00:03:05.150> because<00:03:06.080> it's<00:03:06.230> gonna<00:03:06.319> draw<00:03:06.590> a

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
sales point because it's gonna draw a

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.400 
sales point because it's gonna draw a
lot<00:03:06.799> of<00:03:06.920> attention<00:03:07.459> so<00:03:08.390> many<00:03:08.630> people<00:03:08.900> love

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
lot of attention so many people love

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.890 
lot of attention so many people love
black<00:03:09.739> ops<00:03:09.980> 2<00:03:10.250> so<00:03:10.760> I<00:03:10.970> mean<00:03:11.239> we<00:03:11.390> all<00:03:11.480> know<00:03:11.599> a<00:03:11.630> tray

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
black ops 2 so I mean we all know a tray
