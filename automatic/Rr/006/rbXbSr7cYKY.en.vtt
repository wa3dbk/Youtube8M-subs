figured it's gonna be easiest to break
this<00:00:48.480> down<00:00:48.690> into<00:00:49.050> three<00:00:49.920> different<00:00:50.030> videos

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
this down into three different videos

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.450 
this down into three different videos
that<00:00:51.239> way<00:00:51.660> we<00:00:51.870> can<00:00:52.050> find<00:00:52.230> out<00:00:52.440> exactly<00:00:52.949> where

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
that way we can find out exactly where

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.549 
that way we can find out exactly where
all<00:00:53.670> these<00:00:53.879> pieces<00:00:54.180> are<00:00:54.449> together<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:55.320> then

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
all these pieces are together and then

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.920 
all these pieces are together and then
the<00:00:55.770> final<00:00:56.219> video<00:00:56.370> we<00:00:56.910> can<00:00:57.120> put<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.449> pieces<00:00:57.660> of
