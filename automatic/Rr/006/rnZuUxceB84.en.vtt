mother's
right<00:00:34.190> and<00:00:34.400> then<00:00:34.460> it<00:00:34.640> just<00:00:34.670> sort<00:00:34.940> of<00:00:35.170> expanded

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170 
right and then it just sort of expanded

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:37.960 
right and then it just sort of expanded
from<00:00:36.290> there<00:00:36.530> and<00:00:36.680> I<00:00:36.710> think<00:00:36.920> Facebook<00:00:37.460> things

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:37.970 
from there and I think Facebook things

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.420 
from there and I think Facebook things
like<00:00:38.150> that<00:00:38.300> really<00:00:38.540> sort<00:00:39.320> of

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:40.430 
like that really sort of

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.200 
like that really sort of
spends<00:00:41.270> the<00:00:41.360> network

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
spends the network

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.550 
spends the network
and<00:00:42.510> that<00:00:43.350> just<00:00:43.559> introduces<00:00:44.129> new<00:00:44.250> players

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:45.560 
and that just introduces new players

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.590 
and that just introduces new players
I<00:00:45.650> think<00:00:46.520> I'm<00:00:46.730> playing<00:00:47.090> with<00:00:47.210> your<00:00:47.330> brother's

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
I think I'm playing with your brother's

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:48.970 
I think I'm playing with your brother's
obviously<00:00:48.050> like<00:00:48.230> leave<00:00:48.590> you<00:00:48.680> said<00:00:48.830> war

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:48.980 
obviously like leave you said war

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.150 
obviously like leave you said war
brothers<00:00:49.340> but<00:00:49.610> going<00:00:50.510> up<00:00:50.690> with<00:00:50.840> Ollie<00:00:51.070> makes<00:00:52.070> a

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
brothers but going up with Ollie makes a

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.000 
brothers but going up with Ollie makes a
bit<00:00:52.310> easier<00:00:53.200> sort<00:00:54.200> of<00:00:54.290> know<00:00:54.380> how<00:00:54.680> each<00:00:54.800> other

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
bit easier sort of know how each other

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.220 
bit easier sort of know how each other
playing<00:00:55.250> stuff<00:00:55.580> and<00:00:55.820> sort<00:00:56.600> of<00:00:56.660> more<00:00:56.810> instinct

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.230 
playing stuff and sort of more instinct

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.170 
playing stuff and sort of more instinct
so<00:00:57.620> I<00:00:57.650> think<00:00:57.830> two<00:00:58.340> of<00:00:58.490> them<00:00:58.670> come<00:00:58.850> together

00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.180 
so I think two of them come together

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.450 
so I think two of them come together
really<00:00:59.420> well<00:00:59.600> for<00:00:59.960> the<00:01:00.080> chip<00:01:00.290> chase<00:01:00.590> you

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
really well for the chip chase you

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.130 
really well for the chip chase you
always<00:01:01.670> say<00:01:01.850> only<00:01:02.090> put<00:01:02.330> one<00:01:02.360> through<00:01:02.690> and<00:01:02.960> matt

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
always say only put one through and matt

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:04.450 
always say only put one through and matt
is<00:01:03.260> always<00:01:03.530> on<00:01:03.710> the<00:01:03.800> end<00:01:03.950> of<00:01:04.040> it<00:01:04.160> and<00:01:04.339> it

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
is always on the end of it and it

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.750 
is always on the end of it and it
generally<00:01:05.180> results<00:01:05.750> in<00:01:05.840> a<00:01:05.930> try<00:01:06.170> yeah<00:01:06.860> the

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:07.760 
generally results in a try yeah the

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.970 
generally results in a try yeah the
little<00:01:07.940> is<00:01:08.300> it's<00:01:08.480> a<00:01:08.540> good<00:01:08.690> kid<00:01:08.870> like<00:01:09.200> I<00:01:09.380> you

probably a you know they're here and
everyone<00:02:57.380> else<00:02:57.560> is<00:02:57.710> sort<00:02:57.920> of<00:02:57.950> here<00:02:58.190> but<00:02:58.370> if<00:02:58.490> we

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
everyone else is sort of here but if we

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.760 
everyone else is sort of here but if we
can<00:02:58.760> stay<00:02:59.060> in<00:02:59.090> that<00:02:59.360> top<00:02:59.570> five<00:02:59.840> that'll<00:03:00.620> just

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:00.770 
can stay in that top five that'll just

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:02.950 
can stay in that top five that'll just
dump<00:03:01.010> remote<00:03:01.340> support<00:03:01.670> even<00:03:02.000> more<00:03:02.330> and<00:03:02.600> then

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:02.960 
dump remote support even more and then

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:04.240 
dump remote support even more and then
we<00:03:03.080> can<00:03:03.260> develop<00:03:03.500> it<00:03:03.800> with<00:03:03.950> the

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
we can develop it with the

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:05.740 
we can develop it with the
hopefully<00:03:04.670> from<00:03:04.850> the<00:03:04.970> funding<00:03:05.360> that<00:03:05.390> we<00:03:05.600> do

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
hopefully from the funding that we do

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.380 
hopefully from the funding that we do
receive<00:03:05.950> around<00:03:06.950> from<00:03:07.130> our<00:03:07.280> successes<00:03:07.700> and

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
receive around from our successes and

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:09.850 
receive around from our successes and
that<00:03:08.570> way<00:03:08.720> you<00:03:08.780> know<00:03:08.990> it's<00:03:09.140> all<00:03:09.290> in<00:03:09.470> being

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:09.860 
that way you know it's all in being

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.350 
that way you know it's all in being
played<00:03:10.100> in<00:03:10.280> the<00:03:10.430> high<00:03:10.940> schools

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
played in the high schools

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.150 
played in the high schools
it's<00:03:13.140> already<00:03:13.290> at<00:03:13.470> the<00:03:13.560> international<00:03:14.130> level

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
it's already at the international level

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.280 
it's already at the international level
by<00:03:14.610> international<00:03:15.150> schools<00:03:15.450> so<00:03:15.660> hopefully

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
by international schools so hopefully

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.200 
by international schools so hopefully
you<00:03:16.380> can<00:03:16.530> hear<00:03:16.650> just<00:03:16.980> generated<00:03:17.610> through<00:03:17.850> the

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:18.210 
you can hear just generated through the

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:24.950 
you can hear just generated through the
lower

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:24.960 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.020
