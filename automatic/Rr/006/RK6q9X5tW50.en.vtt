guess it says in the title that every

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.680 
guess it says in the title that every
single<00:00:40.289> time<00:00:40.440> it<00:00:40.589> says<00:00:40.769> it's<00:00:41.190> talking<00:00:41.429> about

the narrator is really removed from the

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:48.950 
the narrator is really removed from the
entire<00:00:46.699> narration<00:00:47.699> of<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:47.909> story<00:00:48.269> and<00:00:48.629> and

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
entire narration of the story and and

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.450 
entire narration of the story and and
really<00:00:49.199> there's<00:00:49.620> some<00:00:49.769> traumatic<00:00:50.100> things

really there's some traumatic things
going<00:00:50.789> on<00:00:50.969> but<00:00:51.239> he<00:00:51.359> did<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.899> narrator<00:00:52.289> doesn't

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
going on but he did the narrator doesn't

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.049
