00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.450 
modern warfare 3 they were a different
one<00:01:39.289> they<00:01:39.409> had<00:01:39.530> like<00:01:39.649> a<00:01:39.680> little<00:01:39.829> skull<00:01:40.280> with

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
one they had like a little skull with

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.190 
one they had like a little skull with
wings<00:01:40.490> and<00:01:41.030> stuff<00:01:41.210> on<00:01:41.359> him<00:01:41.390> but<00:01:41.930> they<00:01:42.020> were<00:01:42.079> all

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
wings and stuff on him but they were all

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.929 
wings and stuff on him but they were all
gold<00:01:42.530> skulls<00:01:42.979> and<00:01:43.340> they<00:01:43.399> just<00:01:43.549> kind<00:01:43.670> of<00:01:43.759> had

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:43.939 
gold skulls and they just kind of had

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:45.550 
gold skulls and they just kind of had
different<00:01:44.450> numbers<00:01:44.780> around<00:01:45.020> them<00:01:45.229> depending

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
different numbers around them depending

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:46.840 
different numbers around them depending
on what<00:01:45.770> prestige<00:01:46.070> it<00:01:46.219> was<00:01:46.369> and<00:01:46.609> stuff<00:01:46.759> like

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
on what prestige it was and stuff like

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:48.219 
on what prestige it was and stuff like
that<00:01:46.939> so<00:01:47.210> they<00:01:47.359> were<00:01:47.420> a<00:01:47.479> little<00:01:47.689> bit<00:01:47.930> different

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
that so they were a little bit different

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:49.719 
that so they were a little bit different
and<00:01:48.320> I<00:01:48.380> think<00:01:48.590> that<00:01:48.740> was<00:01:49.039> just<00:01:49.219> a<00:01:49.340> little<00:01:49.640> bit

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
and I think that was just a little bit

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:50.740 
and I think that was just a little bit
better<00:01:49.880> than<00:01:50.090> the<00:01:50.149> ones<00:01:50.390> that<00:01:50.539> we're<00:01:50.659> getting

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
better than the ones that we're getting

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.929 
better than the ones that we're getting
in<00:01:51.020> this<00:01:51.200> game<00:01:51.469> um<00:01:51.710> I<00:01:52.070> think<00:01:52.520> they<00:01:52.609> should<00:01:52.820> have

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:52.939 
in this game um I think they should have

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:54.639 
in this game um I think they should have
done<00:01:52.969> something<00:01:53.119> a<00:01:53.630> bit<00:01:53.960> different<00:01:54.020> instead

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649 
done something a bit different instead

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:56.260 
done something a bit different instead
of<00:01:54.740> just<00:01:54.859> dipping<00:01:55.189> them<00:01:55.310> in<00:01:55.460> gold<00:01:55.729> but<00:01:56.060> it<00:01:56.179> is

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
of just dipping them in gold but it is

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:57.669 
of just dipping them in gold but it is
what<00:01:56.420> it<00:01:56.450> is<00:01:56.539> not<00:01:56.810> gonna<00:01:56.960> lie<00:01:57.140> they<00:01:57.350> do<00:01:57.409> look

00:01:57.669 --> 00:01:57.679 
what it is not gonna lie they do look

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:59.590 
what it is not gonna lie they do look
pretty<00:01:57.920> cool<00:01:58.399> um<00:01:58.640> but<00:01:59.030> yeah<00:01:59.119> that's<00:01:59.270> that's

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
pretty cool um but yeah that's that's

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.480 
pretty cool um but yeah that's that's
that<00:01:59.869> so<00:02:00.049> we<00:02:00.140> have<00:02:00.259> 15<00:02:00.590> new<00:02:00.710> procedures<00:02:01.159> coming

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
that so we have 15 new procedures coming

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.130 
that so we have 15 new procedures coming
to<00:02:01.640> advanced<00:02:02.030> warfare<00:02:02.450> and<00:02:02.630> do<00:02:02.840> we<00:02:02.960> have<00:02:03.109> a
