clan<00:00:39.090> war<00:00:39.270> experience<00:00:39.840> and<00:00:40.460> so<00:00:41.460> my<00:00:41.640> clans<00:00:41.910> 160

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
clan war experience and so my clans 160

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.840 
clan war experience and so my clans 160
clan<00:00:43.020> wars<00:00:43.399> in<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.579> past<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:46.370> you<00:00:47.370> know<00:00:47.399> we

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
clan wars in the past and you know we

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.750 
clan wars in the past and you know we
didn't<00:00:48.329> start<00:00:48.510> doing<00:00:49.219> frequent<00:00:50.219> clan<00:00:50.489> wars

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
didn't start doing frequent clan wars

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.639 
didn't start doing frequent clan wars
back-to-back<00:00:51.270> clan<00:00:51.510> wars<00:00:51.750> until<00:00:52.079> like<00:00:52.469> two

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
back-to-back clan wars until like two

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.670 
back-to-back clan wars until like two
months<00:00:52.800> ago<00:00:53.239> before<00:00:54.239> that<00:00:54.660> we<00:00:54.870> only<00:00:55.199> did<00:00:55.379> one

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
months ago before that we only did one

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.270 
months ago before that we only did one
to<00:00:55.920> two<00:00:56.129> clan<00:00:56.550> wars<00:00:57.350> per<00:00:58.350> week<00:00:58.680> so<00:00:58.980> that's<00:00:59.160> why

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
to two clan wars per week so that's why

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.270 
to two clan wars per week so that's why
our<00:00:59.309> clan<00:00:59.699> war<00:00:59.879> wins<00:01:00.090> aren't<00:01:00.960> that<00:01:01.050> high<00:01:01.320> but

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
our clan war wins aren't that high but

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.100

got to town all eights and on their side
they<00:01:28.950> have<00:01:30.680> 11<00:01:32.299> so<00:01:33.299> they've<00:01:33.450> got<00:01:33.540> 11<00:01:33.659> tunnel

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
they have 11 so they've got 11 tunnel

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.469 
they have 11 so they've got 11 tunnel
tens<00:01:34.530> there's<00:01:34.799> an<00:01:34.890> extra<00:01:35.310> four<00:01:35.549> tunnel<00:01:35.970> 10<00:01:36.180> tax

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
tens there's an extra four tunnel 10 tax

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.440 
tens there's an extra four tunnel 10 tax
and<00:01:36.780> they've<00:01:37.619> got<00:01:37.799> no<00:01:38.159> tunnel<00:01:38.820> eights<00:01:39.060> at<00:01:39.270> all

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
and they've got no tunnel eights at all

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.090 
and they've got no tunnel eights at all
so<00:01:39.689> so<00:01:40.049> pretty<00:01:40.229> much<00:01:40.320> at<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.530> start<00:01:40.590> we're<00:01:40.950> at

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
so so pretty much at the start we're at

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.380 
so so pretty much at the start we're at
a<00:01:41.130> disadvantage<00:01:41.729> already<00:01:42.860> having<00:01:43.860> maybe<00:01:44.399> for

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
a disadvantage already having maybe for

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.539 
a disadvantage already having maybe for
tunnel<00:01:46.020> eight<00:01:46.170> attacks<00:01:46.590> being<00:01:47.159> ineffective

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
tunnel eight attacks being ineffective

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.819 
tunnel eight attacks being ineffective
and<00:01:48.890> -<00:01:49.890> for<00:01:50.579> Town<00:01:51.000> Hall<00:01:51.210> ten<00:01:51.479> attacks<00:01:51.780> in<00:01:52.170> their

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
and - for Town Hall ten attacks in their

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.359 
and - for Town Hall ten attacks in their
favor<00:01:53.100> so<00:01:54.020> if<00:01:55.020> you<00:01:55.229> look<00:01:55.380> at<00:01:55.560> their<00:01:55.770> bases

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
favor so if you look at their bases

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.700 
favor so if you look at their bases
number<00:01:56.670> one<00:01:58.399> I<00:01:59.719> believe<00:02:00.719> that<00:02:00.930> their<00:02:01.140> bases

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
number one I believe that their bases

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.859 
number one I believe that their bases
aren't<00:02:01.979> their<00:02:02.729> real<00:02:02.969> bases<00:02:03.479> because<00:02:03.659> I've

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
aren't their real bases because I've

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.010 
aren't their real bases because I've
been<00:02:03.990> changing<00:02:04.439> them<00:02:04.770> in<00:02:05.180> the<00:02:06.180> last<00:02:06.360> few<00:02:06.600> hours

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
been changing them in the last few hours

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.940 
been changing them in the last few hours
a<00:02:07.439> few<00:02:08.280> times<00:02:08.520> so<00:02:08.849> I<00:02:09.660> apologise<00:02:10.229> to<00:02:10.379> Tim<00:02:10.560> Yolo

the moment so we've got maxed heroes for

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:23.350 
the moment so we've got maxed heroes for
this<00:02:21.110> guy<00:02:21.319> and<00:02:21.769> pretty<00:02:22.430> much<00:02:22.519> maxed<00:02:22.879> defenses

so our up top

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.660 
so our up top
channel<00:02:26.300> 10<00:02:27.129> you<00:02:28.129> know<00:02:28.220> it<00:02:28.340> doesn't<00:02:28.519> really

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
channel 10 you know it doesn't really

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.150 
channel 10 you know it doesn't really
have<00:02:29.090> maxed<00:02:29.690> out<00:02:29.840> Heroes<00:02:30.590> at<00:02:30.769> all<00:02:30.920> he's

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.490 
have maxed out Heroes at all he's
probably<00:02:31.430> got<00:02:31.720> don't<00:02:32.720> really<00:02:33.050> show<00:02:33.200> his<00:02:33.319> base

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
probably got don't really show his base

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.330 
probably got don't really show his base
yet<00:02:33.739> because<00:02:34.010> it's<00:02:34.160> prior<00:02:34.370> to<00:02:34.550> war<00:02:34.700> but<00:02:35.390> he<00:02:36.340> but

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
yet because it's prior to war but he but

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.280 
yet because it's prior to war but he but
he's<00:02:37.489> got<00:02:37.670> around<00:02:37.880> maybe<00:02:38.269> level<00:02:38.810> 28

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
he's got around maybe level 28

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.789 
he's got around maybe level 28
as<00:02:39.530> he's<00:02:40.370> highest<00:02:40.819> and<00:02:41.319> let's<00:02:42.319> have<00:02:42.410> a<00:02:42.470> look<00:02:42.560> at

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:42.799 
as he's highest and let's have a look at

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:49.240 
as he's highest and let's have a look at
maybe<00:02:43.160> some<00:02:43.459> of<00:02:43.610> these<00:02:43.700> tunnel<00:02:44.540> tens<00:02:44.810> here<00:02:48.250> yes

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
maybe some of these tunnel tens here yes

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.240 
maybe some of these tunnel tens here yes
so<00:02:49.549> really<00:02:50.239> high<00:02:50.360> heroes<00:02:50.840> level<00:02:51.140> forty<00:02:51.829> level

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250
