00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.700
 The best thing about Cantis is - 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.520
 definitely singing and having a lot of friends. 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.780
 The camps are nice. 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.380
 As well as being allowed to appear in fine places. 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.240
 The best in the choir is guys and music. 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.760
 It's best to be in the choir - 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.860
 that you should be dealing with other people. 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.240
 Friends are really nice - 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.380
 and of course the music we sing. 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.120
 The fact that you can sing great works. 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.540
 It's really nice. 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.180
 Bach's Music - 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.520
 really interesting and it is nice to sing. 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:13.160
 It's nice to have an orchestra and a big choir. 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:16.680
 Bach's songs are pretty big - 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.340
 but nice - 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.680
 and long. 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:20.960
 Well, Bach is absolutely awesome! 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.000
 I think this is pretty cool! 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.340
 It is great to sing music that is not even performed by many choirs. 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.820
 My favorite part of the Johannes Passion is "Ruht wohl". 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.893
 The first part is really nice. 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.700
 I don't have one favorite. I like it all. 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.060
 Last part. 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:49.020
 Something short. 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.800
 Maybe the beginning of the book. 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.780
 Last part. "Ruht wohl". 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.700
 Then you know that the point gets home. 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:57.979
 Then it's over. 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:59.760
 Then you have to stand enough.
