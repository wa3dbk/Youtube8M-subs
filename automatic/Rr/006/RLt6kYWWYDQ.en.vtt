silver coin there may be okay it shows
us<00:00:38.590> down<00:00:38.770> about<00:00:38.980> 6<00:00:39.309> inches<00:00:39.430> or<00:00:39.760> so<00:00:39.940> there's<00:00:40.120> a

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.210 
us down about 6 inches or so there's a

00:00:42.689 --> 00:00:42.699 
42 is st. could be a wheat penny let's

00:00:42.699 --> 00:01:04.860 
42 is st. could be a wheat penny let's
see<00:00:42.879> what<00:00:43.059> it<00:00:43.090> is<00:00:43.210> will<00:00:43.420> spin<00:00:43.629> pointed

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
metal detector here i'm taking a break

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.640 
metal detector here i'm taking a break
now<00:03:31.319> I<00:03:32.319> got<00:03:32.560> the<00:03:32.849> minelab<00:03:33.849> e-track<00:03:34.560> took<00:03:35.560> the

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
now I got the minelab e-track took the

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.020 
now I got the minelab e-track took the
cover<00:03:35.890> off<00:03:36.040> modes<00:03:36.310> you<00:03:36.430> can<00:03:36.489> see<00:03:36.730> a<00:03:36.760> little<00:03:36.849> bit

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
cover off modes you can see a little bit

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:43.350 
cover off modes you can see a little bit
better<00:03:38.489> at<00:03:39.489> the<00:03:39.640> sunray<00:03:41.879> probe<00:03:42.879> on<00:03:43.030> here<00:03:43.239> which

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.360

better at the sunray probe on here which
is<00:03:43.480> the<00:03:43.569> pinpointer<00:03:44.220> and<00:03:46.590> of<00:03:47.590> course<00:03:47.650> the<00:03:48.010> coil

here puts it right on the coil or i can
switch<00:04:00.040> to<00:04:00.700> the<00:04:00.790> pinpointer<00:04:01.299> what<00:04:01.569> you<00:04:01.720> see<00:04:01.930> me

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:02.049 
switch to the pinpointer what you see me

switch to the pinpointer what you see me
use<00:04:02.200> the<00:04:02.319> pinpointer<00:04:02.799> in<00:04:02.799> the<00:04:02.950> hole<00:04:03.599> which<00:04:04.599> is

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
use the pinpointer in the hole which is

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.550 
use the pinpointer in the hole which is
this<00:04:04.959> here<00:04:06.390> and<00:04:07.390> it<00:04:07.569> will<00:04:07.599> get<00:04:07.840> right<00:04:08.049> right

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:45.810 
but then I also had like a pop can top

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:47.330 
but then I also had like a pop can top
right<00:05:46.139> here<00:05:46.319> that<00:05:46.440> I<00:05:46.500> just<00:05:46.680> got<00:05:47.009> out<00:05:47.160> of<00:05:47.220> the

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:47.340 
right here that I just got out of the

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:48.529 
right here that I just got out of the
way<00:05:47.460> cuz<00:05:47.639> it's<00:05:47.759> on<00:05:47.819> the<00:05:47.910> surface<00:05:48.300> and<00:05:48.389> it<00:05:48.449> was

00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:48.539 
way cuz it's on the surface and it was

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:49.850 
way cuz it's on the surface and it was
interfering<00:05:48.870> and<00:05:48.990> once<00:05:49.289> I<00:05:49.349> got<00:05:49.500> it<00:05:49.620> out<00:05:49.710> of<00:05:49.770> the

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:49.860 
interfering and once I got it out of the

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:52.129 
interfering and once I got it out of the
way<00:05:50.009> I<00:05:50.280> could<00:05:51.000> hear<00:05:51.150> my<00:05:51.300> target<00:05:51.690> down<00:05:51.840> here<00:05:52.050> and

00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:52.139 
way I could hear my target down here and

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:54.370 
way I could hear my target down here and
it<00:05:52.199> sounds<00:05:53.069> like<00:05:53.130> it<00:05:53.250> could<00:05:53.340> be<00:05:53.430> a<00:05:53.520> silver<00:05:53.759> coin

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:54.380 
it sounds like it could be a silver coin

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:58.850 
it sounds like it could be a silver coin
so<00:05:55.380> let's<00:05:55.530> check<00:05:55.740> it<00:05:55.860> out<00:05:55.949> and<00:05:56.099> see<00:05:57.680> see<00:05:58.680> what

00:05:58.850 --> 00:05:58.860 
so let's check it out and see see what

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:20.709 
so let's check it out and see see what
we<00:05:58.949> have

Sturtz<00:06:21.719> just<00:06:21.990> so<00:06:22.139> crumbly

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:37.820
