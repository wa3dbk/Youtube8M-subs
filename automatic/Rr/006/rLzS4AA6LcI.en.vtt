00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.410 
then you get to press
I<00:01:46.320> think<00:01:46.710> it's<00:01:46.829> x<00:01:47.070> and<00:01:47.280> y<00:01:47.430> to<00:01:47.490> increase<00:01:48.210> or

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
I think it's x and y to increase or

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.969 
I think it's x and y to increase or
decrease<00:01:48.630> your<00:01:48.960> over<00:01:49.409> level<00:01:49.649> so<00:01:49.799> you<00:01:49.860> either

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
decrease your over level so you either

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.679 
decrease your over level so you either
increased<00:01:50.460> by<00:01:50.640> one<00:01:50.880> so<00:01:51.119> you<00:01:51.180> can<00:01:51.360> increase

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
increased by one so you can increase

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.569 
increased by one so you can increase
you'll<00:01:52.140> see<00:01:52.380> me<00:01:52.530> I<00:01:52.560> increase<00:01:53.009> my<00:01:53.040> over<00:01:53.369> level

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
you'll see me I increase my over level

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.850 
you'll see me I increase my over level
to<00:01:53.729> one<00:01:53.909> or<00:01:54.119> two<00:01:54.180> zero<00:01:55.049> and<00:01:55.290> zero<00:01:55.320> is<00:01:55.649> basically

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
to one or two zero and zero is basically

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.330 
to one or two zero and zero is basically
like<00:01:56.340> you're<00:01:56.520> playing<00:01:56.729> level<00:01:57.570> 72<00:01:57.990> normal<00:01:58.530> over

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
like you're playing level 72 normal over

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.249 
like you're playing level 72 normal over
level<00:01:59.640> one<00:01:59.939> is<00:02:00.180> going<00:02:00.570> to<00:02:00.659> be<00:02:00.750> exactly<00:02:01.200> like

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
level one is going to be exactly like

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.459 
level one is going to be exactly like
you're<00:02:01.560> playing<00:02:01.799> it<00:02:02.070> is<00:02:02.430> if<00:02:02.579> your<00:02:02.790> level<00:02:03.119> 73<00:02:03.869> so

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
you're playing it is if your level 73 so

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.499 
you're playing it is if your level 73 so
that's<00:02:04.619> all<00:02:04.799> it<00:02:04.860> is<00:02:04.950> is<00:02:05.159> it's<00:02:05.549> as<00:02:05.939> if<00:02:06.270> you've

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
that's all it is is it's as if you've

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.529 
that's all it is is it's as if you've
leveled<00:02:06.960> up<00:02:07.170> by<00:02:07.500> one<00:02:07.890> except<00:02:08.789> you<00:02:08.910> don't<00:02:09.270> gain

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
another scale point that's all over

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.520 
another scale point that's all over
levelling<00:02:11.879> is<00:02:12.060> but<00:02:12.629> you<00:02:12.720> will<00:02:12.989> have<00:02:13.230> to

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
levelling is but you will have to

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.220 
levelling is but you will have to
change<00:02:13.860> it<00:02:14.069> on<00:02:14.250> the<00:02:14.760> main<00:02:14.970> menu<00:02:15.569> it<00:02:15.660> doesn't

you'll see this rocket launcher it says
level<00:02:39.840> over<00:02:40.530> level<00:02:40.800> required<00:02:41.340> one<00:02:41.870> so<00:02:42.870> that

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
level over level required one so that

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.040 
level over level required one so that
means<00:02:43.739> I<00:02:43.890> can<00:02:44.100> use<00:02:44.130> it<00:02:44.550> in<00:02:44.730> over<00:02:45.360> level<00:02:45.660> one<00:02:45.840> or

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
means I can use it in over level one or

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.250 
means I can use it in over level one or
over<00:02:46.620> level<00:02:46.860> two<00:02:47.010> whatever<00:02:47.700> but<00:02:48.540> as<00:02:48.780> you'll

see I exit the game I change it to over
level<00:02:53.610> zero<00:02:53.940> so<00:02:54.360> normal<00:02:54.900> level<00:02:55.140> 72<00:02:55.500> then<00:02:56.430> I

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
level zero so normal level 72 then I

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.150 
level zero so normal level 72 then I
reinter<00:02:57.120> the<00:02:57.209> game<00:02:57.390> and<00:02:57.570> I<00:02:57.660> can<00:02:57.900> still<00:02:58.380> use<00:02:58.890> I

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
reinter the game and I can still use I

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.300 
reinter the game and I can still use I
can<00:02:59.400> still<00:02:59.610> utilize<00:03:00.090> my<00:03:00.600> over<00:03:01.050> level<00:03:01.380> one<00:03:01.769> Rock

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
can still utilize my over level one Rock

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.190 
can still utilize my over level one Rock
launcher<00:03:02.700> you'll<00:03:02.850> see<00:03:03.120> it<00:03:03.330> has<00:03:03.480> the<00:03:03.750> exact

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
launcher you'll see it has the exact

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.670 
launcher you'll see it has the exact
same<00:03:04.470> stats<00:03:05.250> it<00:03:06.120> doesn't<00:03:06.690> scale<00:03:07.050> down<00:03:07.319> it's

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
same stats it doesn't scale down it's

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.440 
same stats it doesn't scale down it's
the<00:03:07.890> same<00:03:08.130> stats<00:03:08.400> as<00:03:08.519> it<00:03:08.640> was<00:03:08.790> an<00:03:08.970> over<00:03:09.180> level

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
the same stats as it was an over level

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.840 
the same stats as it was an over level
one<00:03:09.600> as<00:03:09.750> it<00:03:09.959> is<00:03:10.019> an<00:03:10.200> over<00:03:10.470> level<00:03:10.739> zero<00:03:11.040> and<00:03:11.340> I

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
one as it is an over level zero and I

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.520 
one as it is an over level zero and I
can<00:03:12.030> still<00:03:12.330> use<00:03:12.569> it<00:03:12.720> you'll<00:03:12.810> see<00:03:12.989> I<00:03:13.019> drop<00:03:13.350> it

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
can still use it you'll see I drop it

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:14.570 
can still use it you'll see I drop it
and<00:03:13.680> pick<00:03:13.950> it<00:03:13.980> back<00:03:14.190> up

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
and pick it back up

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.910 
and pick it back up
I<00:03:14.610> get<00:03:14.790> still<00:03:15.150> totally<00:03:15.569> usable<00:03:15.900> so<00:03:16.590> what<00:03:16.800> these

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
I get still totally usable so what these

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.190 
I get still totally usable so what these
over<00:03:17.190> levels<00:03:17.459> can<00:03:17.610> do<00:03:17.760> is<00:03:17.910> you<00:03:18.030> can<00:03:18.120> go<00:03:18.450> you<00:03:19.019> can

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
over levels can do is you can go you can

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.990 
over levels can do is you can go you can
get<00:03:19.410> basically<00:03:19.920> weapons<00:03:20.370> that<00:03:20.519> are<00:03:20.579> better

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
get basically weapons that are better

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.670 
get basically weapons that are better
than<00:03:21.209> normal<00:03:21.420> you<00:03:21.900> can<00:03:22.049> go<00:03:22.230> back<00:03:22.410> to<00:03:22.440> over

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
than normal you can go back to over

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.530 
than normal you can go back to over
level<00:03:23.010> zero<00:03:23.250> like<00:03:23.489> your<00:03:23.640> normal<00:03:23.790> level<00:03:24.120> 72

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
level zero like your normal level 72

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.750 
level zero like your normal level 72
character<00:03:25.019> and<00:03:25.230> you<00:03:25.590> can<00:03:25.769> use<00:03:25.950> even<00:03:26.370> better

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
character and you can use even better

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.660 
character and you can use even better
weapons<00:03:27.239> so<00:03:27.900> one<00:03:28.200> way<00:03:28.380> to<00:03:28.440> do<00:03:28.769> this<00:03:28.950> it<00:03:29.160> is<00:03:29.370> to

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
weapons so one way to do this it is to

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.550 
weapons so one way to do this it is to
be<00:03:29.790> like<00:03:30.000> to<00:03:30.870> be<00:03:30.959> able<00:03:31.230> to<00:03:31.350> actually<00:03:32.100> utilize

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
be like to be able to actually utilize

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
that might be an interesting strategy a

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:06.440 
that might be an interesting strategy a
lot<00:04:05.459> of<00:04:05.579> people<00:04:05.820> are<00:04:05.910> just<00:04:06.030> going<00:04:06.180> to<00:04:06.269> get<00:04:06.359> to

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
lot of people are just going to get to

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.120 
lot of people are just going to get to
ov<00:04:06.540> level<00:04:06.840> eight<00:04:07.049> and<00:04:07.410> try<00:04:07.590> to<00:04:07.650> get<00:04:07.829> all<00:04:07.950> the

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
ov level eight and try to get all the

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:09.979 
ov level eight and try to get all the
stuff<00:04:08.400> for<00:04:08.640> it<00:04:08.760> basically<00:04:09.239> over<00:04:09.450> level<00:04:09.810> eight

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
stuff for it basically over level eight

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:12.229 
stuff for it basically over level eight
is<00:04:10.170> the<00:04:10.230> max<00:04:10.590> and<00:04:10.859> it's<00:04:10.980> essentially<00:04:11.549> be<00:04:11.730> like

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
is the max and it's essentially be like

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:14.599 
is the max and it's essentially be like
being<00:04:12.450> at<00:04:12.630> level<00:04:12.900> 80<00:04:13.170> except<00:04:13.859> you<00:04:13.950> don't<00:04:14.190> get

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:14.609 
being at level 80 except you don't get

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:17.630 
being at level 80 except you don't get
this<00:04:15.030> skill<00:04:15.450> points<00:04:15.900> from<00:04:16.109> level<00:04:16.440> 73<00:04:17.130> to<00:04:17.220> 80<00:04:17.400> so

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:17.640 
this skill points from level 73 to 80 so

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.490 
this skill points from level 73 to 80 so
you<00:04:17.729> don't<00:04:17.970> get<00:04:18.090> any<00:04:18.239> more<00:04:18.419> skill<00:04:18.750> points<00:04:18.780> so

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
you don't get any more skill points so

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.319 
you don't get any more skill points so
that's<00:04:19.620> basically<00:04:19.979> all<00:04:20.070> it<00:04:20.190> is<00:04:20.400> remember<00:04:21.180> guys

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:21.329 
that's basically all it is remember guys

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:24.100 
that's basically all it is remember guys
do<00:04:21.900> a<00:04:21.930> digit<00:04:22.320> struct<00:04:22.560> run<00:04:22.890> accept<00:04:23.849> the<00:04:23.940> quest

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
do a digit struct run accept the quest

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:27.290 
do a digit struct run accept the quest
restart<00:04:25.110> your<00:04:25.200> game<00:04:25.440> change<00:04:25.979> the<00:04:26.220> over<00:04:26.520> level
