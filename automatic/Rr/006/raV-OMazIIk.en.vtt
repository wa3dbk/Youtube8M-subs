00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:05.670
 the un has football fans and welcome 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.610
 for a new analysis of matt forecast 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:11.429
 and the game was watching today 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:15.690
 is the game from saturday the 19th 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:17.940
 thirds 2013 15 30 alliance arena in 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.430
 Munich and it's also damn well 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.410
 the fc bavaria munich and fortuna 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.670
 Dusseldorf 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.519
 the last game I remember 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.869
 that was the 15 o'clock, the two have 5 0 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:32.160
 won at düsseldorf he is quasi 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:33.239
 four times in a row against the fortunen 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.730
 won and before that there was one 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.710
 draw 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.210
 yes to the shape curve of the bavaria you have to 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.640
 I do not think I say much 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.930
 he forms 100 percent, that is, seven 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.050
 I see victory here but it is 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.910
 of course, much more so far everything 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.230
 won what they could win now 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:55.079
 being a relative on the last weekend 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:57.809
 lackluster victory at tsg Hoffnungheim with 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.710
 1 0 by a stolpertor of federal as 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.739
 it should be different 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.219
 So almost gomez over 100 gomez of the one 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.720
 with z 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.970
 so it is good the game of Bavaria in 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.040
 the champions league is only then 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:15.540
 The week was played at home 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:17.700
 against the fc arsenal came the 3 1 im 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.979
 So it should work too 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.439
 nothing goes wrong 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:29.400
 then let's have a look at fortuna 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:31.380
 düsseldorf düsseldorf last 1 1 against 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.920
 Mainz then lost 21 at Schalke before that 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:38.009
 leads as one to zero against and one 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:45.000
 one to zero defeat at freiburg das 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:49.290
 makes 36 percent performance 6 percent 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:52.079
 performance before a degree to 1 against 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.790
 Stuttgart therefore relatively he mixed 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.430
 so a bit left of defeats 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.899
 the whole rather simons times the table to 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.479
 There are clear with Bayern Munich 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:04.619
 first with 63 points fortuna düsseldorf 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:06.090
 12 thus 28 could possibly be the 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.030
 descend swirl slide in that if 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.470
 we will see later 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.690
 previous season 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.230
 relatively easy to answer bavaria 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:18.500
 always been first fortuna düsseldorf 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:21.930
 That started well they have to be canceled 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:24.450
 at least between 14 and 15 or so 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.590
 respectively 13 and 15 and have themselves 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.990
 now a bit worked up 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.400
 the twelfth place 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:32.190
 will one then see what is left there? 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.630
 results for the fortunen and yes 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.470
 Successfully celebrate the scorer 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:39.570
 of course, with 15 hits still there 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.610
 with eleven and on the side of the fortunen 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:44.100
 Charlene and Reisinger with six 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.350
 or five still meet 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:49.770
 hurt the zaro is injured 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:51.630
 rafinha and badstuber and at the 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.790
 fortuna bonn ii and reisinger being 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.160
 their reisinger a bit heavier 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:59.850
 Therefore , the injury should weigh 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:02.040
 That's why I say bonito june 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:05.040
 now in the round what do you think 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.250
 how to turn naturally go again until 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:11.030
 can watch 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.030
 I am not quite 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:24.090
 yes I say it will be a 50 50 because you 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:27.209
 need to remember once you have it 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:29.130
 then it could be repeated 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:31.700
 maybe an avalanche then develop 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.700
 you do not know it 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:38.340
 So as you said you have heard 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:40.200
 actually unity in the round 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.180
 that the bayern rather rejects it that way 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.390
 bring it home and that too 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.390
 zero
