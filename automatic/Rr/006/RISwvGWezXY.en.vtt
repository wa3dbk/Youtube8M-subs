00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:11.580
 and then people look really good than who 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.290
 talk in the nick of time bringing another video 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.279
 this video now want to talk to you 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:20.880
 about Max measures the game that will leave this 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.859
 year is the game was announced in 2013 and 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.840
 You're promising it's going to be a great game. 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:28.230
 I was not so excited for him 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.820
 but after listening to the gameplay that only 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.800
 recently I was very excited about 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.140
 that the game he is not with that 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.180
 footprint of the game being made because of 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.219
 movie knows so I wanted to comment with 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.469
 You guys do not grow up in games there. 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.239
 which bears the name of the films that end 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.700
 being not so good I think man 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.680
 spider, the best example of this is the 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.140
 - they were recently released 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.809
 they were made in a hurry by 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.910
 movie account is whenever it is released 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.440
 a movie releases a Spider-Man game and 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.350
 The game does not end up being very cool. 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.840
 The market is getting a little boring. 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.180
 that in games like this are based on 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.909
 movies only that med max from what i saw 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.409
 It's not being based on the movie. 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.210
 so it can be based on the movie 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.220
 obviously but it is not being done 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.650
 in prayer to come out with the 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.960
 movie so you do not have a machine 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.860
 need to have this brand of movie with game 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.840
 vice versa 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.180
 This is what I thought was very cool because the game 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.119
 was announced by what I saw in 2013 is 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.400
 at the sony conference and from there to here 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.170
 it has already been postponed and sometimes this 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.400
 I found it very cool because every 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.860
 release is expected to 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.299
 September this year so it's really cool 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.040
 because we see that the producer 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.170
 planting making game on express for 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.479
 release with the film is that even 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.270
 the movie will be out on May 14th so 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.920
 May to September face is a long time 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.810
 I really hope that from now on the 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.720
 producers start to see this is that 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.340
 people to start working together with the 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.560
 film companies only that they had the 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.630
 time , for example if the 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.360
 Spider-Man Movie and Quit a Movie 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.310
 the best piece in 2017 and has a 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.990
 producer who will make the movie game 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.939
 the spider man it will be based on 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.950
 film will have the same story you 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.420
 beauty, we're basically going to see what 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.580
 we saw in the movie only that playing and 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.660
 got in control of the spider man 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.430
 Calm down and beauty 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.600
 only that the producer has a time beyond 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.760
 two years 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:18.120
 this is when production starts 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.260
 of the movie begins the production of the game I 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.600
 I give the example of the sea ​​is because people 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.090
 knows that the movie will be in 2017 so 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.740
 if they want to make a game based on 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.330
 movie begins to produce now I want 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.670
 so it's going to take a lot of time from here to there 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.980
 knows what was done with midiamax 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.900
 it was produced it was announced at 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.370
 unit in 2013 or his profession 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.410
 I was a little earlier than this and 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.690
 now in 2015 same movie being released 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.690
 It will take a few months for it to be 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.340
 released for playstation 4 xbox one and pc 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.810
 So I thought that was pretty damn bad for what I 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.550
 I saw the trailer that came out is that you are 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.520
 seeing fund found a very cool 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:52.350
 geographic question of him to use what the 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:55.200
 element of the movie really is the desert 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.880
 there the middle climate is the apocalyptic is that 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.950
 he has in the film is also in the present 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.860
 in the game the character of this 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:04.380
 feature of the mad max he had 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.210
 in weary leader create the cars this 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.620
 element you create the cars pick up 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:09.690
 piece I found it very cool because 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.700
 you besides playing there you will have 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.040
 exploring the entire map and picking up 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.870
 car parts is to assemble in your 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.520
 I found it very cool because of 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.780
 Suddenly you 're walking there, kaká arrives 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.150
 the piece that I have to put in the car 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.410
 to increase the damage of that and you put 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.480
 that piece the car gets better alone 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.220
 I found the graphic very nice. 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.440
 that the new generation is providing 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.450
 so this is already something more to come out 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.180
 Can not you see the pro 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:35.160
 detail is not only geographically in 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.110
 faces of the characters but also in the 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.640
 scenery teach game photography 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.770
 I found it very cool, what I say 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.780
 that the issue of smoke and 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:47.670
 things that are not solid for example 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:49.950
 smoke is the water that end up being half 2d 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.660
 In games he always uses a 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.030
 2d so that water for example when 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.560
 I hit under the water and 12t is not a sad 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:58.230
 Well, how are you, for example, the boss? 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:01.260
 of 4 and now it's not my max max smoke 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:03.390
 Sand coming off the ground she's well made 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.980
 in it it really looks like a 3d then this 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:07.470
 I found out much because the work of 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.210
 producer is being too deep for 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.760
 that this game is beautiful and it does not 

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:13.410
 skirt is any game is during this 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.870
 video Neverland Trailer 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:17.790
 saw why the guy talks a lot about 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.760
 gameplay about what's in the game 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:21.630
 he shows the cars shows the character 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:23.760
 development of the characters of the 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:25.290
 story he speaks all this I found 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.530
 very interesting, it 's difficult for us 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:28.510
 view games was based 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.580
 in movies even if they are good and vice 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:32.590
 versa in the house then maybe even 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.930
 be a turning point in evolution let's say 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:36.520
 so this type of game is that this game 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.780
 Be very good, I'm waiting, later. 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.730
 What a star I 'm saving 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.950
 I did not quite know that I was going to have a 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:43.030
 mad max and when I saw the trailers yet 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:45.280
 This week I was very excited. 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.930
 with the game and I really hope that the game 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.330
 Be good to show it to the others. 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:51.130
 producers who give yes to make a game 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:53.410
 based on the movie that is good not 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:55.450
 need to have this same hurry game skirt 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:57.160
 six months later a year later 

00:04:55.450 --> 00:05:00.100
 of the movie's release but he went 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.990
 based on the movie will be an advertisement 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:03.760
 greater both in the game and for the movie 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.169
 It's expensive, look, this game is good, it's good. 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:07.000
 based on that movie that came out a year 

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:09.070
 back to then this is a very thing 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.380
 Nice and I hope that the producers 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:14.110
 see more of this and have more games 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:16.660
 so it 's certainly max face that will be in the 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:18.669
 captain america's next movie will be 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:20.560

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:26.139
 imagine if a milan game that is 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:27.760
