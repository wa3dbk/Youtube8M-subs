00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:14.270
 here are two teams that are very close 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:16.280
 in the standings that clash ten days 

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:18.890
 9th welcomes auxerre 13th 

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:21.050
 it's an important derby for both 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:24.020
 dijon formations stays on five matches 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:26.090
 without defeat and wants to confirm this return 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:28.610
 to business three victories over 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:30.470
 last four games Auxerre side 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:31.640
 it's more complicated two wins 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.770
 only since the beginning of the season 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.620
 but a defeat only on the five 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:39.020
 last matches the first opportunity 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.670
 and Dijon with this little 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.489
 point deflection 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.739
 it is not paying for that Corot konÃ© 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:48.620
 insists a koned bull who will pass 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:55.100
 on the pole he has the first two 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:56.960
 opportunities of the party is the Dijonnais 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.420
 are the most enterprising on this beginning 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.800
 of party still a good center and who 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.329
 cut the trajectory of the ball 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.220
 recognizes of course the man in shape he 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:04.850
 had already had two opportunities including a 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.550
 post 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:10.100
 this time if he marks 29th minute dijon 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:12.110
 leads logically 1 0 is third goal 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.330
 of the season for the Ivorian striker 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.090
 the reaction serroise with this strike 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.230
 by far it is not framed 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.750
 it is always the best team dijon 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:23.750
 on the field again an interesting shot 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:26.030
 the strike of Roman philippoteaux and 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:29.090
 ran away in extremis by olive 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.650
 Sorin new luck on this center 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.230
 ball repelled by sorin 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.880
 the Auxerre defense always 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.020
 difficulty that suffers a lot 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.710
 adverse opportunities 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.750
 retry 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.060
 gni fique the balloon is rolled up this is 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:45.060
 not framed very little again 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.310
 franc on the pole that opportunities for 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.530
 the djonnais not a lot of success 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.650
 given the number of opportunities always this 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:58.290
 score of 1 0 is the score in the middle 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:02:01.740
 time the dijon team and private only 2h 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:04.530
 or wounded Auxerre on his side must 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.080
 play without three potential holders 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:12.300
 willy boly and suspended in vial defense 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:14.610
 and haddad to 100 wounded we were serving 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.140
 rather successful on the lawn of the 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.739
 gaston gÃ©rard stage at these last 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.840
 years a 1 0 win in league 2 the 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:23.660
 last season a 2 0 win in 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.580
 league 1 two seasons ago 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.709
 and this time it's always dijon 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.540
 who lead and who dominates but only 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:33.480
 1 0 there lies to come back with this 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:36.500
 coiled knock which rescue the 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.500
 Dijon goalkeeper 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.090
 benjamin lacombe relaxed well for 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.100
 prevent equalization auxerroise dijon 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:47.450
 who holds to the end and who wins 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.450
 the latter against auxerre 1 0
