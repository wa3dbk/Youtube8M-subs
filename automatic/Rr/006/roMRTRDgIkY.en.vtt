fourth and fifth stride they can only

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:46.990 
fourth and fifth stride they can only

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000 
maintain that for a short distance so

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.790 
maintain that for a short distance so
then<00:04:47.210> the<00:04:47.300> body<00:04:47.510> will<00:04:47.720> hit<00:04:47.870> 105<00:04:48.410> degrees<00:04:48.770> and

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 
then the body will hit 105 degrees and

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.440 
then the body will hit 105 degrees and
they<00:04:49.100> have<00:04:49.280> to<00:04:49.460> stop<00:04:49.700> they're<00:04:49.970> gonna<00:04:50.090> overheat

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:50.450 
they have to stop they're gonna overheat

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:53.530 
they have to stop they're gonna overheat
because<00:04:50.930> exercising<00:04:51.890> creates<00:04:52.160> body<00:04:52.760> heat<00:04:53.030> so

because exercising creates body heat so
with<00:04:53.870> that<00:04:54.140> then<00:04:54.440> they<00:04:54.710> have<00:04:54.740> to<00:04:55.100> cool<00:04:55.280> down

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520 
with that then they have to cool down

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:56.920 
with that then they have to cool down
even<00:04:55.850> if<00:04:55.940> they<00:04:56.030> do<00:04:56.150> catch<00:04:56.330> their<00:04:56.540> prey<00:04:56.660> they
