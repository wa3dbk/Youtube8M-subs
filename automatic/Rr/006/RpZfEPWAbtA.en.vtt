00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:04.230
 I'm here with the Road 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.230
 the appreciation for the little break 

00:00:11.409 --> 00:00:13.389
 Contract flirted 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:17.460
 dpa obviously forgot another trailer so remained engine for 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:18.329
 on 

00:00:18.329 --> 00:00:20.300
 but with the pliers 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.300
 Percent were 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.630
 dpa Alaaf 

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:33.329
 I can only say 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.120
 so also here and bands 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.280
 a treasure chest 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.280
 as such 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.600
 then, unfortunately, the given God are a slight overweight 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.410
 the two backs are made by Ernst a 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.230
 nice little cozy 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.690
 Percent protects 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.870
 the RSK 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:16.740
 the acute crisis has passed 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.520
 Dusseldorf 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.520
 innumerable possible 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.170
 he recognizes the fair trade 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.170
 there is still something translated that present many 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.960
 Thicker than water that's nice to know 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.880
 but you're right 

00:02:19.469 --> 00:02:22.669
 another gear now 

00:02:22.669 --> 00:02:25.859
 and hope that Sarah Latton had complained Stomp the Yard way 

00:02:32.109 --> 00:02:35.109
 he struggled 

00:02:57.249 --> 00:03:00.249
 50 films contract 

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:06.209
 we now have enough to see Bulgrin ZÃ¼rn as EU 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:07.709
 maybe can 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.709
 now our curiosity has risen 

00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:14.399
 Picture exactly this word choice 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:20.519
 These own goals have their own character but Hermann 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:23.519
 to experience this feeling 

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:25.900
 behind the 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.359
 in advance, TuS Naunheim has to look for the prison 

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:31.439
 once it was the most powerfull 

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:34.439
 almost as big as the sunken Prenzel 

00:03:35.469 --> 00:03:37.149
 some even say 

00:03:37.149 --> 00:03:40.149
 he was a reason 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:42.269
 now ask 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:45.269
 that he is not a friend is the style appeal 

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:50.619
 Constantini I've collected even more see than is 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:52.999
 I will not 

00:03:52.999 --> 00:03:55.999
 elicit 

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:00.129
 it would be after en 

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:03.069
 but every time 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:06.069
 we want the gold here 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.120
 I do not go that far 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.499
 why sees 

00:04:37.499 --> 00:04:39.689
 Any questions 

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:43.409
 Berlin concluded the threat has now been closed 

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:49.360
 Munich 4 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.580
 no one is free as long as the destroyer to Parsberg 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:03.689
 To push Henson's service 

00:05:03.689 --> 00:05:06.919
 Boxing - 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:09.909
 Travelers would use 

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:12.909
 the episode 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.150
 the Munich Re 

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:33.289
 pm you will do that 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:37.150
 when the door was 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:41.190
 I can not wait to find out that it is dec 

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:44.919
 I hold the regulation 

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:53.909
 one against Hanau 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:59.409
 and the yacht to the today legally loadable keeper I say I mean 

00:05:59.409 --> 00:06:02.490
 a little bit different today 

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:04.729
 so that should be judged first 

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:06.680
 for the beginning 

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:09.680
 correspond 

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:15.330
 and 

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:17.900
 7 million 

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:20.099
 enjoy 

00:06:20.099 --> 00:06:23.990
 First of all, it's easy to put on and highland war was still something for those 

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:27.199
 which is down to business and although I have internet here 

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:30.189
 but only about a rather antique 

00:06:30.189 --> 00:06:32.219
 because it just happens 

00:06:32.219 --> 00:06:34.469
 Volker Marx 

00:06:34.469 --> 00:06:37.469
 Leipzig overweight and now 

00:06:38.449 --> 00:06:43.410

 Week to upload upload 

00:06:49.999 --> 00:06:53.729
 because I can stay home under normal internet connection 

00:06:54.419 --> 00:06:58.590
 the booklet juicy next from lurz a poem completely always only on weekends 

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:01.979
 consequences 

00:07:01.979 --> 00:07:03.710
 so far so good 

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:06.319

00:07:06.319 --> 00:07:09.229
