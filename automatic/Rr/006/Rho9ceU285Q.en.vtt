00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:06.810
 hello my dear shops g2 track 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.630
 today I have to filled dates too 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.760
 do with pistachios and 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:16.199
 That's why I'm happy to show you that 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:18.359
 Here it looks like in the end and me 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.069
 Hope you like it and I'm mine 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.130
 comments if it's done 

00:00:20.069 --> 00:00:27.960
 tasted and if I am happy 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:29.699
 if you give me a thumbs up for that 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.259
 of course he needs a city filled 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.040
 because I have a kilo out of here now 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:36.630
 tUNISIA 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:40.020
 then you need 50 grams butter a 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:45.270
 Lid of these great waters and 200 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:50.580
 gram pistachios without salt and four 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:53.520
 tablespoon of powdered sugar takes first 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:55.350
 her file puts it down and cuts 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.540
 in the middle you should have been on it for a long time 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.390
 Careful that is not hurt 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:02.940
 then he takes the stone and does that 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.129
 extra and the saddle also extra me 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.030
 will make about 25 pieces so no 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.469
 whole kilo 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.539
 but I can remember that 

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:13.999
 remained a bit over 

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:13.999
 So the bill ver 35 to 40 pieces 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.360
 next to it our pistachios 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.980
 they are with shell but without salt 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.710
 dervish found norma it was 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:40.320
 not easy to find and you have to 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.540
 just peel and then you can 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.910
 I'll start doing the extra there 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.330
 peel and there is asia and then you go 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:47.760
 it continues 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.320
 Next we have to peel 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.000
 naturally mix pistachios 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.530
 I did not have any mixa on hand now 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.660
 That's why I have a blender 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.270
 The important thing is that you want 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:59.190
 he puts something around it 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.479
 be it a kitchen towel or something 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.650
 else was else you will be the whole 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.320
 crowd out 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:06.600
 and yes I have to do that now and then 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.490
 it also go further than the hacked 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.560
 We are now making pistachios out of them 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.570
 first to the side 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:15.740
 because we want the piece of butter 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:15.740
 but only 50 grams 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.680
 I want that I always fuck like that 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:28.840
 that I'm the knife in the middle investor 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:31.870
 that's 250 and then about that 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.810
 piece 50 grams just pure with it and 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:37.750
 then take a bit to melt 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.459
 we do the rose water and do it though 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:45.250
 just a cover in that's about 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:48.930
 I believe a tablespoon there is simply 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.930
 delicious aroma and tastes great 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:55.969
 then the areas it is gifted 

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:58.249
 pistachios and we do not do that 

00:02:55.969 --> 00:02:59.749
 everything pure but only a part so 

00:02:58.249 --> 00:03:02.629
 a part had to be left for 

00:02:59.749 --> 00:03:05.389
 later for the decoration and I show 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:10.760
 but you still really pure 

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:13.099
 do and how much I leave in it 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.230
 a little bit more like a vice 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:17.739
 it is really just for sprinkling 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.739
 at the end 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:30.050
 then he takes the icing sugar and does 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:31.940
 of it four tablespoons rhine with mountain so 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:33.980
 bad if a bit more power is 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:36.860
 then sweeter of it made four 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:39.380
 tablespoon is pure and important is that you 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:41.780
 that really does not let others but 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:43.460
 reacts quickly and stirs quickly 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.200
 so that it makes a great crowd and 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:48.220
 so that the aroma of rose water too 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.220
 does not go away so fast 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:53.030
 if you notice that the mass is liquid 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:55.940
 you let them go ten to fifteen 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:59.540
 minutes at best in a bowl in 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:01.370
 refrigerator cools down so sees the 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.540
 cooled mass is off then one 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.790
 got a little bit stuck 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:08.000
 then we put then first to the side then 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:10.550
 Let's examine the data 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.440
 Opening the bottom and then we take 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:13.820
 The thumbs put the thumb in the 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:17.140
 opening it in a bit more 

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:20.120
 becomes broader and yes then always the mass 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:21.620
 and lead the date and the beautiful 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.900
 it is that you can do right 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.280
 if you visit in ramadan before 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:25.790
 you can break that too 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.920
 do 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:30.080
 and yes, that's how the perceived datet looks 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.760
 designed have first to the side and 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.169
 that's what he does with it all your wiggling 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:35.260
 and when you're done, then it works 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:35.260
 continue 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.980
 then you take the rest of the 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.090
 chopped pistachios and sprinkles over 

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:04.800
 the finished latte 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:06.510
 you can also call her the dachshund one by one 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.370
 take and then get in there to score but 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:10.290
 To tell the truth, it's time consuming 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:12.360
 and that 's the way it works 

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:15.400
 then a little bit nice later 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:16.960
 you do not stay anymore 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:20.740
 so my love is now the finished 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:22.090
 Double out very tasty so I think 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:24.220
 She is very nice if you do that though 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:25.960
 you get visit or if you want that 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:27.460
 would like to pass on neighbor and one 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.610
 a little bit so that would like to be able to 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:31.630
 if she is it is great and 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:33.610
 tastes also makes sense though one 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:35.229
 a little sweet but open anyway 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:37.720
 sweet, what I also especially 

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:39.370
 Would recommend that your village left 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.780
 tip set so the a bit 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:41.800
 it is also tastier when it is drier 

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:43.720
 better is not quite 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.370
 otherwise if you have that here 

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:48.280
 I liked it then let me a thumb 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:49.030
 high and I'm looking forward to everything 

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:51.210
 next time 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:51.210
 at
