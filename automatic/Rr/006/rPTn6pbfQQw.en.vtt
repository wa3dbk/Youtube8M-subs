00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:07.600
 Yes 

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:13.100
 hi everyone knows already denied this 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.110
 your today for a new 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.190
 video of breakfasts I hope that 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:17.480
 you are all very well that you 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:18.890
 do not be too hungry if that's the case 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.779
 go get your men's food 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.860
 were pausing the video and resume there 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:23.990
 when you are well settled in 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:26.119
 your couch and as for me I'm going 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.650
 go to the opening of these boosters this 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:29.930
 is not boosters but rather a 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.550
 puck and post upon receiving subscribers 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.890
 including small letters with words 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.960
 cards and full of attention that he's 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.310
 always great fun and it's 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.660
 why I wanted to dedicate at least 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.460
 twice a week in video 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.840
 because it's the least of it 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.460
 I'm so happy that limits 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.470
 agreement may be better to open more 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.000
 boosters then we will discover everything 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:49.160
 we had today I have you 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.510
 harvested see in one video three 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.130
 receptions because it was small 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.720
 receptions and suddenly to make a 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:55.610
 rather interesting video I told myself 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:58.100
 that it would be nice to group three 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.930
 so we'll watch the first one then 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.570
 already we have a map we will read first 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.519
 the word so well we have a super arcana 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.170
 in the middle which is super well done so 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.360
 completely handmade a super 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.270
 idea and there is written I am zarkana the 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.369
 king of the canine huawei it was great 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:16.070
 then said frankly I did not know 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:18.829
 not this proverb did you have surface that 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.640
 frankly wow that's great so I 

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:21.380
 not say away from the person 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.420
 actually it's about elise to whom 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.189
 we did this drawing and the map that I 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.329
 we put on the side so we're all going 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:29.390
 read them little riddle 

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:31.069
 I am soft blue and black I have two 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.770
 heads and I am the evolution of zoology 

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:34.759
 it's okay it's not going to be very very hard 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.189
 evolution of solo chi so there two 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:39.109
 heads it's just above so it's 

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:41.329
 homeland west it's not crossed it's 

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:43.850
 the middle one it's diama tu 

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:45.560
 see the diam at our I will not find 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.539
 so born jeanne everywhere it's done 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.340
 pleasure is never my super pals no 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:51.469
 the harka is not a friend 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.810
 really my pokemon say it's more 

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:56.140
 that a friend that a link really here I 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.330
 can not say more than a million 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.100
 a link of heart we will say that before 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.450
 look at your card answers the riddle I 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.010
 think it's diane matte of the coup 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.990
 go look at the map you had us 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.369
 put a month ago still behind 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.530
 first we will look at the map so 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:10.209
 it was saying mater I found 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.920
 so here I assure you that I did not 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:14.020
 not cheated issued the card without the side 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.270
 but I have absolutely not been there 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.980
 look I hope you will believe me and 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.930
 waiting for ben to finish the word so 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.630
 for jeanne meyer youtuber that makes 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.040
 pleasure to vendome before returning the 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.810
 map him the riddle this is what we have 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.190
 is good anyway thank you to you elise has 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.540
 sowed is very pleasure and then for a 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.880
 times it's not necessarily cards you 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.190
 see it's a little game a riddle 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.200
 and it's always a pleasure 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.360
 so then we move on to the second 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.010
 reception this is calista who we 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.690
 so offered a small pack of cards 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.820
 who were two years old in one of 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.380
 receptions from machir explains amy du 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.910
 we'll see what you put us 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.330
 it's nice in any case go it's 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.170
 left 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:53.350
 we start with dark energy 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:55.450
 then a soporific spirit in the world 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:56.769
 hold that we think out of the block xy has it 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.140
 completely we start a little in 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:02.950
 platinum series then we go on with 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:04.360
 capoeira a schlachter to it's pleasure 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.650
 it is not so pokemon sees 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.180
 often only when I see him so 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.079
 almost always in the xia sawmill 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.310
 which is a salt 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:11.410
 it makes me really hot stone 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.329
 schlatter and he is too good on 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.590
 continues with a sister ray holds the 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:15.880
 box the dragons that's why 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.769
 that it is holographic it is about 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.209
 priority tickets it looks like a 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:20.709
 pokéball but in reality it's a kind 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:22.510
 I do not know what it is 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:25.209
 allows access but it feels good to 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.170
 have it at the super masonry 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:28.030
 holographic 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.380
 so I think it's the promo 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.030
 had in the guts ac is not the 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.680
 graph that we normally have in the 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.880
 plasma explosion sawmill because the 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.560
 holographic at the time these were 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.910
 traits and this one rather it's 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.370
 glitter so I largely prefer 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.799
 it's the hall and revel chart 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.630
 I love you come back to coignières then 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:44.920
 with courses she and her kemna taxes 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:46.209
 6 or four arm robberies I 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.870
 the impression here is better not to 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:49.150
 rub him 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.049
 klaus fight too well and then 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.030
 the last map 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:53.440
 oh it's not the last one by the way 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.150
 have felt a second it is about 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.310
 drakos is a pokemon dragon henry 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:59.170
 towards this friendly I prefer his 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.280
 evolution of rata still glued wanted 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.740
 sell attack it's a lot more 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.210
 balèze and we'll finish here 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:06.520
 she was sure it's a pleasure 

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:08.710
 this is dhr attack the graph too 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.820
 too good to go great so also of the 

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:12.400
 chest of dragons that was a 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:14.410
 Minister mini-series released to the public 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.060
 not to honor the exit of the 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:18.700
 dragon type in the tcg 1 it was y'a 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.150
 not so long anyway so that makes 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.370
 pleasure 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.900
 she is great I love thank you very much to 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:23.800
 3 kalisa it made me very happy to 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.450
 see the little cards that you have me 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.520
 offered it was great 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:29.500
 I loved it we still have the 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.570
 third reception this is this time 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:33.400
 de chloe who put us a word with a 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:34.840
 custom booster what would it be 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.570
 a little of a mystery song 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.360
 so we'll see first the word and after 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:41.470
 I will go to the opening of the booster 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.030
 so I will first try to 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:45.760
 remove the scotch 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:47.980
 here and we will try to read without words 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:49.000
 so what does it say hello 

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:50.650
 young people I do not know you very much 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.940
 but I still thought of you since 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:53.020
 yes the reception was also in the 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.490
 parcels of machinery must know that 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.930
 reality is almost my darling because this 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:57.580
 all the packages so much that she is 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:59.260
 idolized it's me who then have with 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.790
 little touches in its hills 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.930
 today jeanne I do not know 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:03.100
 much better though I still 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:05.320
 even thought of you there is a booster 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:07.630
 personalized for you and a small arena 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:09.070
 I draw badly bis frankly good 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:09.910
 but then not too bad look at that 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:12.220
 what do you think 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:13.630
 he is good he is not a real 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:15.400
 arcana but she tried to represent 

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:17.050
 arcana and to deny it's me I you 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:19.690
 I do not even know if I'll be able to draw 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:21.250
 almost like you I reassure you I 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:23.200
 am really not good at all in drawing 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:25.480
 so the state tried and frankly nothing 

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:27.430
 that for that it's worth the gold is then 

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:28.920
 a little ps i could also have a 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:30.880
 photo of you and marine dedications and 

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:31.990
 why not this is the first time 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:33.610
 we wonder that in normal times the 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:34.720
 request a business card will need that 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.280
 I'm going to talk but it's the least 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:38.740
 things anyway to send a 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:41.200
 little something that I know to see 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:43.150
 with her if we can do that to you 

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:45.100
 we will finish this little pokemon by 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:46.930
 the price booster opening shocks me from 

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:47.470
 war to see it is a booster 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:49.120
 custom 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:51.820
 so we'll see together what we can 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:53.410
 to have today then we find 

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:55.570
 like in a real booster a code 

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:56.860
 online I do not know if it's good but I 

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:59.170
 you still offer it to me that makes me 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:00.760
 pleasure and I do the technique of 1 2 3 

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:03.010
 1 to 2 to put the right cards to the 

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:04.720
 end hoping to have a good pick 

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:06.790
 let's go we start 

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:09.340
 today with a raptor of spades 

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:10.220
 we go on with half-naked so that 

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:11.600
 it's series cards 

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:14.330
 gasped trala made us pretty much a 

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.920
 true houston we continue with even 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:19.280
 yade 

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:20.600
 a dida volts kelly does not fall down 

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:22.220
 what will it be an opening of 

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.690
 boosters without my faithful canino if he is 

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:25.340
 too well i love it more than kelly does 

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:26.930
 is destined and future I find that 

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:29.090
 the illustration is hyper mega rich 

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:30.560
 were going really sublime kids he's 

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:33.770
 outside outside and that's where is 

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:35.450
 really his place he's going great too much 

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:38.570
 beautiful spear really too beautiful 

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:39.590
 continues with brown streets a beaver 

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:41.150
 we who builds his little 

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:42.410
 dam so still so malicious 

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:43.760
 pokemon me he makes me laugh at 

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:45.590
 early I did not like at all that our 

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:47.150
 no beaver wrongs and more time has 

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:49.160
 past and over I learned to 

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:50.510
 to appreciate it 1 frankly I love 

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:52.820
 we continue with a sister ray 

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:54.380
 the evolution da and we will finish with a 

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:55.850
 ray sister the asset of lysander so 

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:58.490
 apparently did not have to do the 1 2 3 1 

00:06:55.850 --> 00:07:00.200
 2 but it was a great booster 

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:02.030
 frankly I liked the map of 

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:03.680
 this opening for me was the case neither 

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:05.630
 our breasts necessarily you have understood 

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:07.130
 so I'm going to get together both 

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:09.110
 best cards of this poker boss who 

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:11.240
 rattac holographic probe and the dock 

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:12.770
 dinos in any case I spent a very good 

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:14.330
 moment in this morning it's nice 

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:15.830
 to open the mail because I know 

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:17.060
 not at all what to expect by 

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:18.560
 compared to booster openings 

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:20.270
 I usually know a little bit of 

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:21.800
 cards from the series while that's it 

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:24.410
 really feeling is really a 

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:26.360
 total discovery and I loved passing 

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:27.800
 this moment in your company I hope 

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:29.270
 that you will have pleased me 

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:30.590

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:33.610
