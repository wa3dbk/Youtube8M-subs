00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
pass interference on that place so why

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.789 
pass interference on that place so why

shifting<00:03:37.100> my<00:03:37.730> view<00:03:38.150> from<00:03:38.660> from<00:03:39.170> the<00:03:39.290> other

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
shifting my view from from the other

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.380 
shifting my view from from the other
players<00:03:39.860> and<00:03:40.130> picking<00:03:40.579> up<00:03:40.670> that<00:03:40.880> whole<00:03:41.090> group

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 
players and picking up that whole group

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:42.940 
players and picking up that whole group
of<00:03:41.540> players<00:03:41.810> and<00:03:42.019> it<00:03:42.140> was<00:03:42.260> hard<00:03:42.530> for<00:03:42.590> me<00:03:42.829> to

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:42.950 
of players and it was hard for me to

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.550 
of players and it was hard for me to
determine<00:03:43.489> if<00:03:43.790> that<00:03:43.880> was<00:03:44.150> past<00:03:44.870> interference

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
determine if that was past interference

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.560 
determine if that was past interference
and<00:03:46.040> it's<00:03:46.160> very<00:03:46.489> rarely<00:03:46.880> called<00:03:47.299> in<00:03:47.480> those

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:47.570 
and it's very rarely called in those

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:49.690 
and it's very rarely called in those
situations<00:03:48.320> now<00:03:48.859> what<00:03:49.010> did<00:03:49.100> the<00:03:49.130> league<00:03:49.400> or
