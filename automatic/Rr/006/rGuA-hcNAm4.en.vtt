00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:31.419 
only difference is thin line get the

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:33.600 
only difference is thin line get the

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
last feel alive at the end it goes to a

00:06:09.379 --> 00:06:09.389 
at the very end it looks like it goes

00:06:09.389 --> 00:06:12.469 
at the very end it looks like it goes
over<00:06:09.570> two<00:06:09.930> chords<00:06:10.530> to<00:06:10.740> end<00:06:10.919> the<00:06:11.040> song<00:06:11.340> once<00:06:12.270> got

00:06:12.469 --> 00:06:12.479 
over two chords to end the song once got

00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:15.469

00:06:15.469 --> 00:06:15.479 
here is B minor into a flat minor so you

00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:17.990

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:18.000 
can just do the B minor and a flat minor

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:26.050 
can just do the B minor and a flat minor
like<00:06:18.300> this<00:06:18.630> so<00:06:19.139> that<00:06:19.290> be<00:06:19.440> 24<00:06:20.040> 4<00:06:20.340> 3<00:06:20.790> 2<00:06:22.010> to<00:06:23.010> 4<00:06:23.310> 42
