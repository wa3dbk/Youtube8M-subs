and<00:02:29.370> like<00:02:29.850> I<00:02:30.000> said<00:02:30.060> before<00:02:30.360> this<00:02:30.660> has<00:02:30.870> multi

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
and like I said before this has multi

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.910 
and like I said before this has multi
angle<00:02:31.440> viewing<00:02:31.860> so<00:02:32.960> here's<00:02:33.960> the<00:02:34.200> typing

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
angle viewing so here's the typing

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.720 
angle viewing so here's the typing
stance<00:02:35.460> if<00:02:36.120> we<00:02:36.360> so<00:02:36.600> need<00:02:36.990> that<00:02:37.200> and<00:02:37.470> then<00:02:38.340> here

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
stance if we so need that and then here

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.340 
stance if we so need that and then here
is<00:02:38.910> the<00:02:40.370> viewing<00:02:41.370> sense<00:02:41.820> for<00:02:42.150> you<00:02:43.140> want<00:02:43.290> to

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
is the viewing sense for you want to

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.920 
is the viewing sense for you want to
watch<00:02:43.500> a<00:02:43.590> movie<00:02:43.620> or<00:02:43.830> something<00:02:44.930> actually

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
watch a movie or something actually

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.120 
watch a movie or something actually
works<00:02:46.110> very<00:02:46.320> well<00:02:46.680> in<00:02:47.070> fact<00:02:47.610> and<00:02:48.950> now<00:02:49.950> we're

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
works very well in fact and now we're

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.440 
works very well in fact and now we're
going<00:02:50.220> to<00:02:50.280> take<00:02:50.460> a<00:02:50.520> look<00:02:50.850> at<00:02:51.060> a<00:02:51.300> at<00:02:52.140> a<00:02:52.200> keyboard

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
going to take a look at a at a keyboard

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.900 
going to take a look at a at a keyboard
so<00:02:54.450> if<00:02:54.840> you<00:02:55.500> use<00:02:55.650> a<00:02:55.680> transformer<00:02:56.370> you<00:02:56.670> should

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
so if you use a transformer you should

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.300 
so if you use a transformer you should
already<00:02:57.120> be<00:02:57.570> familiar<00:02:57.870> with<00:02:58.260> the<00:02:58.590> fact<00:02:58.830> that<00:02:58.980> a

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
already be familiar with the fact that a

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.340 
already be familiar with the fact that a
lot<00:02:59.820> of<00:02:59.850> the<00:02:59.940> times<00:03:00.210> the<00:03:00.360> screen<00:03:00.930> or<00:03:01.320> the

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
lot of the times the screen or the

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.070 
lot of the times the screen or the
tablet<00:03:01.860> itself<00:03:01.950> is<00:03:02.340> way<00:03:02.790> year<00:03:03.150> than<00:03:03.870> the

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
tablet itself is way year than the

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.320 
tablet itself is way year than the
keyboard<00:03:04.860> so<00:03:05.190> a<00:03:05.220> lot<00:03:05.640> of<00:03:05.670> times<00:03:05.940> you<00:03:06.060> get<00:03:06.150> some

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
keyboard so a lot of times you get some

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.890 
keyboard so a lot of times you get some
tilting<00:03:06.750> effects<00:03:07.820> I<00:03:08.820> found<00:03:09.300> that<00:03:09.510> with<00:03:09.660> this

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
tilting effects I found that with this

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.780 
tilting effects I found that with this
case<00:03:10.200> it<00:03:10.410> actually<00:03:10.440> fixes<00:03:11.160> that<00:03:13.220> these<00:03:14.220> straps

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
case it actually fixes that these straps

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.720 
case it actually fixes that these straps
are<00:03:15.080> primarily<00:03:16.080> used<00:03:16.290> for<00:03:16.980> when<00:03:17.580> you're

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
are primarily used for when you're

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.449 
are primarily used for when you're
closing<00:03:18.120> the<00:03:18.510> device<00:03:18.800> so<00:03:19.800> you<00:03:19.980> see<00:03:20.130> here<00:03:20.310> this

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
closing the device so you see here this

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:23.270 
closing the device so you see here this
is<00:03:20.640> the<00:03:21.030> keyboard<00:03:21.900> and<00:03:22.170> then<00:03:22.350> connected<00:03:23.130> with

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
is the keyboard and then connected with

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.400 
is the keyboard and then connected with
the<00:03:23.400> shrubs<00:03:23.670> for<00:03:23.910> the<00:03:23.970> case<00:03:24.150> on<00:03:24.390> so<00:03:25.140> that<00:03:25.290> when

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
the shrubs for the case on so that when

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.620 
the shrubs for the case on so that when
you<00:03:25.530> close<00:03:25.890> it<00:03:25.920> it<00:03:26.400> snaps<00:03:26.820> in<00:03:27.060> place<00:03:27.090> the

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
you close it it snaps in place the

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.100 
you close it it snaps in place the
straps<00:03:27.959> sort<00:03:28.260> of<00:03:28.380> hold<00:03:28.590> a<00:03:28.680> keyboard<00:03:29.070> down<00:03:30.110> and

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
straps sort of hold a keyboard down and

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.380 
straps sort of hold a keyboard down and
this<00:03:31.440> is<00:03:31.560> see<00:03:32.100> how<00:03:32.220> thick<00:03:32.430> it<00:03:32.550> is<00:03:32.640> it's<00:03:32.850> not<00:03:33.000> too

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
this is see how thick it is it's not too

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.780 
this is see how thick it is it's not too
bad<00:03:33.600> like<00:03:34.440> I<00:03:34.470> says<00:03:34.739> is<00:03:34.920> very<00:03:35.160> nice<00:03:35.370> you<00:03:35.700> know<00:03:35.760> I

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
bad like I says is very nice you know I

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.070 
bad like I says is very nice you know I
just<00:03:35.880> throw<00:03:36.120> into<00:03:36.390> your<00:03:36.510> book<00:03:36.690> bag<00:03:36.900> or

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 
just throw into your book bag or

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.180 
just throw into your book bag or
something<00:03:37.200> especially<00:03:37.860> if<00:03:37.950> you're<00:03:38.070> not

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
something especially if you're not

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:39.110 
something especially if you're not
bringing<00:03:38.340> a<00:03:38.459> bunch<00:03:38.580> of<00:03:38.700> notebooks<00:03:38.970> because

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
bringing a bunch of notebooks because

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.080 
bringing a bunch of notebooks because
you<00:03:39.300> using<00:03:39.570> this<00:03:39.660> instead<00:03:40.250> I<00:03:41.250> find<00:03:41.730> that<00:03:41.940> the

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
you using this instead I find that the

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.660 
you using this instead I find that the
most<00:03:42.269> comfortable<00:03:42.720> position<00:03:42.930> for<00:03:43.290> typing<00:03:43.890> it

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
most comfortable position for typing it

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.130 
most comfortable position for typing it
is<00:03:44.790> actually<00:03:44.970> folding<00:03:45.600> the<00:03:45.840> flat<00:03:46.170> back<00:03:46.550> and

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:48.140 
is actually folding the flat back and

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:50.720 
is actually folding the flat back and
having<00:03:49.140> it<00:03:49.350> down<00:03:49.560> as<00:03:49.830> of<00:03:50.010> your<00:03:50.130> viewing<00:03:50.489> mode

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
having it down as of your viewing mode

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.900 
having it down as of your viewing mode
because<00:03:51.380> your<00:03:52.380> screen<00:03:52.769> will<00:03:53.040> not<00:03:53.310> go<00:03:53.550> farther

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
because your screen will not go farther

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.030 
because your screen will not go farther
back<00:03:54.239> and<00:03:54.570> there's<00:03:54.750> no<00:03:54.870> tilting<00:03:55.320> effect<00:03:55.830> to<00:03:56.010> it

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
back and there's no tilting effect to it

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.340 
back and there's no tilting effect to it
and<00:03:56.310> actually<00:03:57.090> leave<00:03:57.480> your<00:03:57.690> screen<00:03:57.900> in<00:03:58.019> a<00:03:58.140> very

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350 
and actually leave your screen in a very

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:05.440 
and actually leave your screen in a very
nice<00:03:59.299> typing<00:04:00.299> sort<00:04:00.660> of<00:04:00.750> position<00:04:02.239> sorry

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:07.760 

you<00:04:06.450> can<00:04:06.660> close<00:04:06.870> it<00:04:07.050> without<00:04:07.320> having<00:04:07.680> the

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:07.770 
you can close it without having the

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:11.440 
you can close it without having the
straps<00:04:08.010> on<00:04:08.220> but<00:04:08.550> as<00:04:08.760> you'll<00:04:09.120> notice<00:04:09.420> here<00:04:10.430> the

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.450 
straps on but as you'll notice here the

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
won't close so you just want to make

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.940 
won't close so you just want to make
sure<00:04:14.340> that<00:04:14.730> you<00:04:14.820> put<00:04:15.180> the<00:04:15.300> straps<00:04:15.630> on<00:04:15.950> because

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
sure that you put the straps on because

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:18.410 
sure that you put the straps on because
it'll<00:04:17.280> close<00:04:17.459> well<00:04:17.820> you<00:04:17.910> know<00:04:18.000> it's<00:04:18.180> going<00:04:18.360> to

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:18.420 
it'll close well you know it's going to

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:19.910 
it'll close well you know it's going to
be<00:04:18.510> very<00:04:18.570> flimsy<00:04:19.170> when<00:04:19.470> you're<00:04:19.590> having<00:04:19.860> your
