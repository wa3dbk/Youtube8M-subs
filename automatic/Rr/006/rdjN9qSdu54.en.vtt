00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.280
 what's up friends how have they been I'm 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:13.680
 ryder here leaving them a new map and 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.529
 this time a well-known survival map 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:19.040
 what is the sky blog but it is not any 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:24.710
 sky as always in the minecraft of 

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:27.439
 of xbox 360 this is one more step 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:30.050
 to the real thing as it is in the pc minecraft 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:33.890
 as you can see below there is nothing there is no 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:36.710
 water there's nothing but the island I'm going to 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:39.829
 approach everything is as in the maestrat of 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:43.020
 pc as you can see here the sandy island 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:46.090
 there is nothing below as you can see 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.340
 everything is exactly the same 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:51.040
 there's only one thing here, obviously 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:55.750
 we are not in microns of fish is not going to 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:59.480
 to be identical that is this block of 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:01.850
 lava this is why 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.710
 or can you help us as the case fits 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.960
 here you can see if I'm walking but 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.100
 there's nothing I'm walking like in him 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.200
 as in the air 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.659
 I do not know how they have done this is a map 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.520
 molded obviously and they have 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:19.710
 used to make the climb 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:21.420
 very much like the EPC as amaikak 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.110
 well if we fall from the island this 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.380
 can help for 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:30.260
 committing suicide we kill ourselves and then we can 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:33.200
 return to the island in that way 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:35.900
 Well, the map is excellent, I hope 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.910
 that you like the challenges and everything because they are 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.740
 those of normal 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:42.050
 the sky normally I leave it in the 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:47.000
 description here is the channel of 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:50.060
 creator that is or pixel that is always the 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.130
 is the one that makes the maps so molded and 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.200
 It only has a small error but 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.490
 obviously it's because we're not cinema 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.909
 crash to grow 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:03.710
 it is this 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:06.870
 this lava block can not be grasped 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:09.360
 with the juice I do not know why 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:13.230
 Well, if we break 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:15.540
 here and placed the lava here with the 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:19.590
 cube if I can remove it but I can not 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:22.290
 put it back with the cube I remove it but 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:25.500
 I left it in the inventory again 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:28.170
 in the bucket they just put it on me or here or 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.450
 can leave it in the inventory but not 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.970
 there is trouble is that that is the error that 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.760
 has but that's not good 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.150
 we will hardly need so much 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.010
 wash 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:41.610
 here we can make the generator of 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:44.010
 codeson we grab with the cube disappears 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.930
 everything normal because the rest is everything 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:50.730
 same as it has to be the escalo 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:53.230
 and I hope you like it I'm going to do a 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.550
 matter hell to see how 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.270
 it looks 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.270
 we'll see 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:08.030
 and well as you can see the leader 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:11.209
 they were more like the same in the world 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:15.230
 normal but in the leader there is also no 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:17.840
 almost nothing alone this little island is 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:20.780
 with the portal but below is everything 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.790
 practically clean because this time he is 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.760
 lobby for micro console you because it is 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.830
 much more similar now yes yes one is 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.980
 it can feel like it's in the main 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:32.269
 craft or on the pc sky block I hope 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.450
 that you like friends already know that 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:37.519
 they always let you leave their like it's very good 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:40.950
 although they do not like it appears but good 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:42.750
 I hope that changes 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.690
 something that I want to show you here the island 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:48.490
 it's like I told you before and nothing 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:51.970
 below that keep it 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:53.980
 the sand blocks if you hit one already 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:56.020
 they fit as it has to be as you can see 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:04:00.550
 adicae you have to be very careful 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:01.870
 then and well, you know, friends 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:03.730
