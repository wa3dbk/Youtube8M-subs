four point oh and a five-point Oh what
we've<00:01:35.940> actually<00:01:36.090> done<00:01:36.300> is<00:01:36.660> integrate<00:01:37.470> Android

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
we've actually done is integrate Android

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.860 
we've actually done is integrate Android
and<00:01:38.730> we<00:01:38.820> think<00:01:39.030> we've<00:01:39.150> really<00:01:39.360> got<00:01:39.570> a<00:01:39.600> winner

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:39.870 
and we think we've really got a winner

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:41.600 
and we think we've really got a winner
now<00:01:40.110> with<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.410> solution<00:01:40.860> that's<00:01:41.070> a<00:01:41.310> great

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
now with the solution that's a great

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:42.980 
now with the solution that's a great
media<00:01:41.940> experience<00:01:42.390> because<00:01:42.630> they<00:01:42.720> can<00:01:42.870> also
