00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 but as is appropriate we do not talk about 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.740
 the output of the teams we do not talk anymore 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:10.710
 of the celebration a championship since neither 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.210
 what you are asked to not be able to avoid 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.799
 that this happens are the players 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.240
 look there is a man in a suit imagine 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:20.580
 security other behind glasses 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:22.199
 sunglasses will even use with 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.369
 normality a stadium that was seen 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:29.039
 hung as expected and how many 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.260
 topics in this range of controversies 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.859
 we can start trying to get to have 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.859
 that answer 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.379
 remember a phrase from the organizer of 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.859
 this event 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:44.430
 tofoni surname he said never again 

00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:47.850
 I organize 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:50.860
 a classic rosarina easier to organize 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:54.130
 an argentina england the falklands 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:57.280
 and then another phrase 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:01:00.670
 that said if I could go back the time 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:03.850
 back neither crazy organized again a 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:06.150
 central news this was on Friday had 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:09.120
 a positive posture to give him 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.710
 and said that really no no he was not 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.480
 completely convinced that there are 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.100
 given conditions as it seems son of the 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.050
 party but that had already been erased 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.220
 a very important figure to each of 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:20.310
 the clubs that the parties have to 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.810
 make the idea of restricting the 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.460
 income visiting fans will 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.870
 allowed to have a stadium full and that 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.870
 you can play the game not even 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:30.570
 that could not even play a game 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:32.940
 no visitors incidents in the stadium 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.850
 where the game was not going to be played with 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:38.700
 a serious book and incidents among 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.380
 own fans and players boys to 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.920
 see if we understand what happened here 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:46.050
 of serious team fans invading 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.640
 the street a lot of desire do not exaggerate 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.220
 penalties therefore follows for so much you 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.020
 they're stealing in the face of the cops 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.820
 in the face of everything that the 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.040
 televising the players themselves 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.140
 now you look at me I say that all the 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.720
 situation gives for the targeted 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.090
 less leaders although good you can 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.619
 analyze your situation is your 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.479
 responsibility in regards to all this not 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.980
 but the players themselves 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.800
 are 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:12.180
 the violent ones because imagine what 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.040
 that happened also if they did not go out to the field 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.170
 of game players from central to 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.170
 say hello to people, not sure 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:21.910
 we would have experienced incidents like 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.750
 that we are seeing worse yet 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:29.160
 good if it's like that 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.850
 it's like that we totally listen to Miguel 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.370
 russo angel 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:35.340
 it seems like new central to chris 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.580
 bosh to the court although we are people 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.580
