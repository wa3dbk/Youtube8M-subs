00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
basic philosophy is that because we have

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.119 
basic philosophy is that because we have
such<00:00:50.460> sandy<00:00:51.030> soils<00:00:51.539> here<00:00:51.899> and<00:00:52.530> we're<00:00:52.860> using

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
such sandy soils here and we're using

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.580 
such sandy soils here and we're using
them<00:00:53.370> so<00:00:53.550> intensively<00:00:54.180> that<00:00:55.050> we<00:00:55.199> just<00:00:55.379> feel

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
them so intensively that we just feel

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.260 
them so intensively that we just feel
that<00:00:55.620> cover<00:00:56.039> crops<00:00:56.399> or<00:00:56.760> an<00:00:56.850> important

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
that cover crops or an important

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
component in soil amendment and yeah

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.189 
component in soil amendment and yeah
just<00:01:02.760> basically<00:01:03.120> maintaining<00:01:03.780> a<00:01:03.840> healthier

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
just basically maintaining a healthier

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.170 
just basically maintaining a healthier
soil<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.799> font<00:01:05.040> on<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.250> soil<00:01:05.580> rather<00:01:05.790> than

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
soil the font on the soil rather than

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.570 
soil the font on the soil rather than
going<00:01:06.360> in<00:01:06.659> and<00:01:06.869> clean<00:01:07.409> cultivating<00:01:08.159> massive

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
going in and clean cultivating massive

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.090 
going in and clean cultivating massive
areas<00:01:09.000> there's<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.270> lot<00:01:09.390> of<00:01:09.540> wasted<00:01:09.960> space<00:01:10.229> so

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
areas there's a lot of wasted space so

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:25.370 
areas there's a lot of wasted space so
we<00:01:11.460> cover<00:01:11.670> crop<00:01:11.909> whenever<00:01:12.210> we<00:01:12.360> possibly<00:01:12.570> can

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.550 

we<00:01:26.380> use<00:01:26.530> a<00:01:26.560> summer<00:01:26.890> smother<00:01:27.310> when<00:01:27.940> we<00:01:28.180> have

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
we use a summer smother when we have

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.800 
we use a summer smother when we have
finished<00:01:29.560> up<00:01:29.740> a<00:01:29.830> short-term<00:01:30.250> crop<00:01:30.640> like<00:01:30.970> peas

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
finished up a short-term crop like peas

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.450 
finished up a short-term crop like peas
in<00:01:31.840> particular<00:01:32.620> if<00:01:32.680> we're<00:01:32.800> not<00:01:32.890> going<00:01:33.190> back

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
in particular if we're not going back

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.460 
in particular if we're not going back
with<00:01:34.180> something<00:01:34.420> immediately<00:01:35.020> we<00:01:35.170> will<00:01:35.260> use<00:01:35.440> a

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:35.470 
with something immediately we will use a

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.380 
with something immediately we will use a
summer<00:01:35.800> smother<00:01:36.130> to<00:01:36.370> suppress<00:01:36.730> weeds<00:01:37.060> and<00:01:37.270> add

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
summer smother to suppress weeds and add

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.870 
summer smother to suppress weeds and add
some<00:01:37.540> organic<00:01:38.050> matter<00:01:38.730> buckwheat<00:01:39.730> is

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
some organic matter buckwheat is

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.460 
some organic matter buckwheat is
probably<00:01:40.210> the<00:01:40.270> simplest<00:01:40.570> summer<00:01:40.900> smother<00:01:41.260> for

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
probably the simplest summer smother for

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.070 
probably the simplest summer smother for
us<00:01:41.590> to<00:01:41.770> manage<00:01:42.040> it's<00:01:42.790> very<00:01:43.120> quick<00:01:43.420> we<00:01:43.660> seed<00:01:43.930> it

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.080 
us to manage it's very quick we seed it

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.790 
us to manage it's very quick we seed it
anywhere

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:44.800 
anywhere

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.890 
anywhere
I<00:01:44.830> think<00:01:45.520> the<00:01:45.640> recommended<00:01:46.180> rate<00:01:46.330> is<00:01:46.450> a<00:01:46.479> bushel

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:46.900 
I think the recommended rate is a bushel

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.870 
I think the recommended rate is a bushel
per<00:01:46.930> acre<00:01:47.080> but<00:01:47.500> I'm<00:01:47.680> sure<00:01:47.890> that<00:01:47.920> weed<00:01:48.310> glom<00:01:48.640> on

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
per acre but I'm sure that weed glom on

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.550 
per acre but I'm sure that weed glom on
pretty<00:01:49.240> close<00:01:49.510> to<00:01:49.690> two<00:01:49.900> or<00:01:50.110> even<00:01:50.350> more

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
pretty close to two or even more

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.020 
pretty close to two or even more
sometimes<00:01:52.710> it's<00:01:53.710> very<00:01:53.800> quick<00:01:54.280> it's<00:01:54.580> very<00:01:54.820> easy

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
sometimes it's very quick it's very easy

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.590 
sometimes it's very quick it's very easy
to<00:01:55.180> work<00:01:55.300> down<00:01:55.900> we<00:01:56.229> have<00:01:56.470> a<00:01:56.500> set<00:01:56.830> of<00:01:57.600> fairly

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
to work down we have a set of fairly

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.350 
to work down we have a set of fairly
heavy<00:01:58.840> Haros<00:01:59.320> and<00:01:59.619> we<00:02:00.400> can<00:02:00.550> go<00:02:00.729> in<00:02:00.940> right<00:02:01.150> now

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
heavy Haros and we can go in right now

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.020 
heavy Haros and we can go in right now
in<00:02:01.690> short<00:02:01.900> order<00:02:02.259> and<00:02:02.790> incorporate<00:02:03.790> this<00:02:03.970> with

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
in short order and incorporate this with

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:05.969 
in short order and incorporate this with
a<00:02:04.210> set<00:02:04.420> of<00:02:04.450> Haros<00:02:04.840> as<00:02:05.050> well<00:02:05.229> as<00:02:05.380> put<00:02:05.619> on<00:02:05.740> a

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
a set of Haros as well as put on a

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:08.520 
a set of Haros as well as put on a
winter<00:02:06.340> cover<00:02:06.910> crop<00:02:07.210> at<00:02:07.390> the<00:02:07.479> same<00:02:07.660> time<00:02:07.930> so

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
winter cover crop at the same time so

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.469 
winter cover crop at the same time so
it's<00:02:08.649> very<00:02:08.709> easy<00:02:09.100> to<00:02:09.280> manage<00:02:09.550> in<00:02:10.030> terms<00:02:10.300> of<00:02:10.420> the

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
it's very easy to manage in terms of the

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:23.470 
it's very easy to manage in terms of the
machinery<00:02:10.869> that<00:02:10.899> we<00:02:11.110> own

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.180 

we<00:02:24.480> have<00:02:24.660> here<00:02:24.990> as<00:02:25.080> a<00:02:25.110> crop<00:02:25.410> of<00:02:25.440> Japanese

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
we have here as a crop of Japanese

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.440 
we have here as a crop of Japanese
millet<00:02:26.700> on<00:02:27.600> a<00:02:27.660> piece<00:02:28.020> of<00:02:28.200> fairly<00:02:28.590> heavy<00:02:28.800> ground

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
that we're not using this year so we're

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.360 
that we're not using this year so we're

ground was well prepared when we got on

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.030 
ground was well prepared when we got on
to<00:02:41.250> this<00:02:41.400> we<00:02:41.850> broadcast<00:02:42.450> about<00:02:42.750> three<00:02:43.650> bushels

the acre which is very very heavy as you
can<00:02:46.110> see<00:02:46.730> but<00:02:47.730> we<00:02:47.880> figure<00:02:48.210> if<00:02:48.300> you're<00:02:48.420> going<00:02:48.600> to

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.570 
can see but we figure if you're going to
grow<00:02:48.840> a<00:02:48.960> crop<00:02:49.320> and<00:02:49.560> the<00:02:49.680> fertility<00:02:50.190> is<00:02:50.250> there

you<00:02:50.790> might<00:02:51.000> as<00:02:51.090> well<00:02:51.120> put<00:02:51.900> it<00:02:51.930> on<00:02:52.110> heavy<00:02:52.410> with

after plastics down the drip tapes down

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.279 
after plastics down the drip tapes down
and<00:04:56.550> we'll<00:04:56.970> see<00:04:57.150> the<00:04:57.330> clover<00:04:57.780> and<00:04:57.810> long<00:04:58.110> before

it needs the early spring moisture to
get<00:05:03.840> established<00:05:04.139> and<00:05:04.770> then<00:05:05.400> we'll<00:05:05.550> mow<00:05:05.759> it

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940 
get established and then we'll mow it

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.629 
get established and then we'll mow it
several<00:05:06.240> times<00:05:06.539> usually<00:05:07.080> when<00:05:07.259> it<00:05:07.380> gets<00:05:07.639> about

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:08.639 
several times usually when it gets about

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:10.430 
several times usually when it gets about

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250 
the help will let me know if it needs to

the help will let me know if it needs to
be<00:05:14.340> mowed<00:05:14.639> it<00:05:15.270> will<00:05:15.389> usually<00:05:15.539> come<00:05:15.930> up<00:05:15.960> to

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320 
be mowed it will usually come up to

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.170 
be mowed it will usually come up to
broad<00:05:16.650> leaves<00:05:16.949> in<00:05:17.159> all<00:05:17.250> manner<00:05:17.550> of<00:05:17.669> weeds<00:05:18.000> and

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:18.180 
broad leaves in all manner of weeds and

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.149 
broad leaves in all manner of weeds and
we<00:05:18.330> mow<00:05:18.539> the<00:05:18.750> weeds<00:05:18.960> off<00:05:19.229> several<00:05:19.590> times<00:05:19.740> that

00:05:20.149 --> 00:05:20.159 
we mow the weeds off several times that

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:23.060 
we mow the weeds off several times that
usually<00:05:20.520> suppresses<00:05:21.229> all<00:05:22.229> the<00:05:22.500> broad<00:05:22.740> leaves

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:23.070 
usually suppresses all the broad leaves

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:25.159 
usually suppresses all the broad leaves
and<00:05:23.820> sometimes<00:05:24.240> we'll<00:05:24.389> have<00:05:24.539> an<00:05:24.659> issue<00:05:24.840> in

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:25.169 
and sometimes we'll have an issue in

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:27.110 
and sometimes we'll have an issue in
June<00:05:25.380> with<00:05:25.590> crabgrass<00:05:25.889> and<00:05:26.520> we<00:05:26.610> may<00:05:26.759> come<00:05:27.000> in

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:27.120 
June with crabgrass and we may come in

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.860 
June with crabgrass and we may come in

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:35.490 
not been sprayed with anything we've

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:37.820 
not been sprayed with anything we've
just<00:05:35.699> managed<00:05:36.060> it<00:05:36.150> by<00:05:36.330> mowing<00:05:36.719> white<00:05:37.530> clover

is<00:05:38.039> probably<00:05:38.340> the<00:05:38.400> most<00:05:38.550> expensive<00:05:39.409> cover<00:05:40.409> we

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:40.680 
is probably the most expensive cover we

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.040 
is probably the most expensive cover we
could<00:05:40.860> put<00:05:41.070> down<00:05:41.310> but<00:05:42.150> because<00:05:42.509> of<00:05:42.539> its<00:05:42.780> height

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.050 
could put down but because of its height

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:45.350 
could put down but because of its height
because<00:05:43.650> it<00:05:43.770> establishes<00:05:44.280> well<00:05:44.610> for<00:05:44.880> us<00:05:45.060> and

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:45.360 
because it establishes well for us and

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.620 
because it establishes well for us and
because<00:05:45.870> it<00:05:46.050> is<00:05:46.169> a<00:05:46.530> legume<00:05:47.210> we<00:05:48.210> think<00:05:48.449> that

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:48.630 
because it is a legume we think that

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:51.830 
because it is a legume we think that
it's<00:05:48.810> probably<00:05:48.990> well<00:05:49.349> worth<00:05:49.590> it
